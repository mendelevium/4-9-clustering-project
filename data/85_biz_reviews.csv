/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",5 star rating,One of the best restaurant I have been to this year! The flavour of the food is amazing and it is a byow!!!Had their beef tartare to start and he flavour was so well balanced. Rabbit as mum aim dish and it blew my mind...I had rabbit a few times before but nothing as tasty as throne I had here. The dessert was also pretty good...not overly sweet.Service was also very good. Not one of the cheapest restaurant in town but definitely worth spending the money!I highly recommend it and will surely be back :)
/user_details?userid=3TQ356XWIEM7DDiiRhMt1w,Sylvio L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I was looking for a classy French restaurant at an affordable price for a very special occasion, when I came across Quartier General. Most restaurant charges an exorbitant price for wine, which makes this restaurant ""competitive"", as you can bring your own bottle. Street parking is available, if you manage to find one, and luckily we did. I was told that one can buy a $10 parking from the convenience store just opposite the restaurant. From the outside perimeter it was not obvious that it was a restaurant, nor was the look appealing.   Inside was quite a different matter, sophisticated, nicely decorated and emitting a warm and fuzzy feeling. We went for their $15 option to get a soup/salad and dessert.  Well worth it.  Different options and combinations you can choose from. Most of us started with a cold soup of beets and carrots, quite unique in taste, but lacks a bit of depth and consistency. Starters we ordered were: Tataki de Thon, Tartare de bœuf and Foie gras.Tuna was bland, a wee bit more cooked than I was expecting.  For the beef tartare, I prefer the one I prepare at home. Foie gras was delicious.  Overall, great starters, but nothing exceptional.   Main course we ordered were Porcelet de Gaspor,  Lieu Noir d'Icelande and Lapin de St. Tite.Porcelet was very tender and juicy, and was served with barley or perhaps overcooked risotto which was not particularly a good match. Lieu noir is an Iceland or Norwegian fish, quite particular in taste, and firm in texture compared to other fish of white flesh.  OK, but not great. I have not tasted rabbit for decades, and had a chance to sample a large bite.  It was out of this world, and exceptionally tasty.  It came on a bed of a mixture of raw vegetables, perfectly seasoned which sends nothing but harmony to the taste buds.Desserts were Churros, Marquise (chocolate cake), Cheese cake. Each of them were delicious. Overall food presentation was a feast for the eyes and settled well with our red Amarone Valpolicella and white Chevalier La Noe (BYOB of course).  Although we were provided with cloth napkins, a cloth would have been nice on our table. Service was exceptional, always present, but not intrusive, from start to finish."
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Do believe the hype. Fantastic plates. Everything was packed with flavour.We decided to come for my birthday and of course we only booked 30 minutes in advance because we were actually gonna go to Pégase down the street but decided let's try this one out.We had a nice cozy window seat booked for 9 pm right at the back which was perfect as the restaurant was still a bit loud from a larger group. The place started to empty out so the atmosphere was on point. Candles were lit on each table with the lighting set to dim which gave me the impression I was back in Paris.Our waitress was great! She explained the menu and each ingredient with such passion that I was excited just listening to her. We chose 3 appetizers the cheek, mushrooms & foie Gras. My favourite was the foie gras and mushrooms they both had really great flavours, but the jam they used for the foie gras was amazing, for sure home made and made with love. As a non mushroom eater they made me a believer. The fried egg oozing on to the mushrooms covered them nicely and was a real treat.Our mains were the duck and rabbit. The duck was perfectly cooked with a pure and a salad. The juice of the duck was perfect. The rabbit was very well cooked and the carrots were nicely seasoned and cooked as well.For dessert we shared the churro with ice cream and cooked marshmallow which was a nice treat.Best part about this place is the fact that is a byow, so that makes it a must try!"

Everything ordered tonight was amazing. And it's not gonna cost you as matches old Montréal. Dinner for two cost us $100 not including bringing our own wineRemember parking next to the restaurant can be tricky a lot of parking right next to it belongs to nearby condos so you have to read the signs.
/user_details?userid=GWC6I7DI6r4blEkuFmUaNA,Tara C.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"Great meal in Montreal. If you're looking for an intimate restaurant with strong French flare and a creative edge, this place is right up your alley.We stopped in here on a rainy night without a reservation and lucked out as they were fully booked, but, one table had yet to confirm. That was our ticket. The entire menu is written daily o a chalkboard. It's short, simple and to the point; they offer appetizers, main courses and dessert. To start, you get a choice of soup or salad, followed by your main dish. I opted for the cod - excellent dish. The execution was beautiful and the flavors throughout the dish were plentiful. My friend is pretty darn close to a vegetarian & only eats chicken and turkey. I know, I know... I feel for her, too. There was nothing on the menu she could/would eat and when addressing our waitress with this concern, she said the chef would gladly put together something, however, it's the chefs choice. Her dish came out: homemade ricotta stuffed ravioli. Almost knocked my friend off her chair, she thought they were so delicious. Everything was super fresh, delicious and the chef is not afraid to be creative and marry non traditional ingredients together. A couple of things to note:- BYO- Make a reservation- Vegetarians beware: heavy on the meat dishes Awesome experience."
/user_details?userid=GWQDGst9Faj0HesR1dilSA,Michelle I.,"Boca Raton, FL",5 star rating,"My husband and I very much enjoyed this delicious restaurant! We came on a last minute reservation and just loved the idea of BYOB. The food and service is excellent but it's a very small place. Seating is a bit tight but it's downtown so we understand. I had the foie gras which was marinated with 12 year old Canadian whisky with grilled bread, excellent appetizer. My husband had the beef tartare which was so tender and delicious. We followed with beef shoulder and scallops for myself and the piglet risotto for my other half. Everything was absolutely divine!!!! The risotto isn't too heavy which is always my concern and the piglet was so fragrant and soft. MY beef shoulder was very moist considering how lean it was but my scallops were slightly overcooked. We're not the type to ever send food back though. I want to mention you get a salad or soup with every main course which I very much appreciate. AND with there was another small salad on our main course dish which I appreciated even more!! We love our vegetables.  Overall, we would highly recommend this restaurant and can't wait to come back!"
/user_details?userid=8BswmQsehWlxnCFhVfRXNg,Heather L.,"South Burlington, VT",4 star rating,"Emailing them is the easiest way to get a reservation at this place. Calling them gets the 'we don't have space' answer every time. The restaurant is in the middle of a quiet neighborhood, but they have a row of meat and cheese places a few blocks away you can wander. They have two seating each night and they expect you to take your time. Very reasonably priced with our bill being ~90 CAD for two four course meals (it is BYOB as well). Waitress was amazing and knew the menu backwards and forwards with recommendations. Restaurant is dimly lit and very romantic. It does get a bit loud, but it adds to the atmosphere I started with the salad (simple) and the sturgeon (the special). Sturgeon is an interesting special and not something commonly seen on a menu so I had to order it - it was delicious! It was battered and deep fried to perfection. I wish there had been an American style portion of it because I could have eaten it all. Not too mushy and not too much batter. I missed my husbands appetizer because I was so entranced. He had pork - he said it was okay. The rabbit was a bit dry and boring. No pops of flavor anywhere - but it was beautifully presented. The rabbit came on a bed of popcorn and carrots - It didn't really work well together in my opinion. The carrots had a sweet glaze and the popcorn ended up chewy rather that crispy. The veal hubby ordered was fantastic. Very tender and well seasoned. Raab was the perfect accompaniment to give it a bite along with the creamy potatoes. Churros were delicious (and huge!) and a perfect way to end the meal. Overall, probably will stop by again and just order anything but the rabbit!"
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Amazing spot to go out for dinner or meet up with friends. It's a BYOB which is always fun and the food is magnificent. The service is impeccable, instead of menu the server has explained in detail each dish and answered all the questions we've had. It was Monday and oh boy, was I surprised to see the place fully packed, yep it's very popular spot so I can only guess how busy they get on the weekend. Maybe it would be a good idea to book in advance. If you're in town, definitely check out this place, I dare to say it's definitely a memorable dining experience."

And yes, they write their menu in French on chalkboards posted on the walls so you can hardly read them, but the waiters are so friendly and nice and will explain everything to you! It also helps that I studied the menu months in advance before coming here... Duck was amazing! Tiny place, make a reservation!!!"
/user_details?userid=r8dD2DJz7_FuJ4peG8uFrw,Ryn M.,"Atlanta, GA",4 star rating,"Like others mentioned, this place is BYOW, which is nice. My husband and I each got the full menus. The flavors are very fresh but I prefer a little more punch in my food. I was very excited to have the foie gras. Unfortunately, the foie gras was very bland to me and if you ate it with any of the accompanying berries, you couldn't taste it at all. That said, my husband did enjoy it so i suppose it depends on your palate.My husband didn't enjoy his veal very much but I did find the flavor of my rabbit nice, if a little dry. The crème brulé had a great caramelization on the top and was our favorite over the cheesecake."

/user_details?userid=bHO5I1mIpOnGZfMFkzQrlw,Mercedes D.,"Old City, Philadelphia, PA",3 star rating,"If I rated the meal based on the soup, salad and starters, I would give 5 stars. There was so much flavour in my beef tartare and the slightest hint of heat. My turnip soup also had enough complexity to know it was made with love. The main dishes, however, were very disappointing. My rabbit was bland, served with some sort of doughy side dish that tasted of nothing. How do you complain about something like that to such a nice, attentive waitress? I couldn't do it. Another reviewer commented that the carrots were the tastiest part, and I agree. My husband had the duck, which wasn't as bland, but just overall missing something from the dish. For the price, we thought we would be given a hearty, tasty meal. The nougat glace and the creme brulee were good, but after the disappointment of the main, it was just not enough to change our minds. I would go again for the appetizers, the ambience, and great service. The main courses, not so much."

The food was outstanding; the additional $15cad to include soup, appetizer, and dessert was very reasonable and highly recommended. The service was beyond exceptional.

Pulled up Yelp and was drawn to Le Quartier General. As fate would have it, they had only 1 table open  - the place was packed so highly recommend making reservations. We lucked out :)The menu is on a chalkboard on the wall and has great selections. For an extra $15, you get a soup or salad plus dessert. It's also BYOB - we didn't know this so my husband quickly went to the market down the road to grab a couple bottles. No corkage fee either.The food was delicious. Absolutely everything we ate was flavourful, made to perfection and the service was impeccable. I'm vegetarian and they had no problem accommodating a meal for meal which was delicious. So far my fav place on our trip to MTL. Highly recommend this place and will definitely go back!"
/user_details?userid=56_DKQpK4tT0rWLt4-DZOQ,Sam G.,"Markham, Canada",3 star rating,"I can't say that i enjoyed the dinner here, I felt like every plate is served with being healthy in mind, everything tasted very bland.We ordered the cauliflower soup, it was served cold.  Didn't like it at all, I felt like it would have been a lot better if it wasn't served cold.For appetizer, we got the tuna tataki, I felt like the tuna pieces were too dry.  Tasted very bland.The black cod entree was ok, the fish was fresh but again I felt it was too bland. I hate to give it 3 star because of all the excellent reviews, but this was my experience so I have to show it.  We went with party of 6, others did enjoy their food.  Three others agreed with my review on the tuna tataki and the cold soup.We circled around the restaurant many times trying to find parking and we couldn't.  Had to park on the big street and walked about 5 minutes.  This restaurant is located inside a residential area, most of the parking spaces requires permit.This restaurant was pretty busy but they did allowed us to bring the stroller in.  Service wise, I didn't have any issues.Note: this is a bring your own wine restaurant, not sure if they actually sell wine, so make sure you call before if you're not planning on bringing your own wine."

Is that pretty much the entire menu?  Practically!  Oh, you can bring your own wine too!  How awesome is that?"

/user_details?userid=XGqqGREMDp1UHgVi0VVGVQ,Antoine C.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"At Le Quartier General, for $50 you will be served a 4 course menu with 1 Michelin star rated quality of food. That should be enough to convince anyone to run there as fast as possible. This place is the best value I've ever seen. Not only is the food incredibly priced but it's Byob which makes it an absolute must go for anyone in the vicinity of Montreal.I am still wondering how those guys make money. I guess the fact that they're booked up every night including on a Sunday helps. Now about the food. We first started with a soup, served cold. Tbh when I tasted the soup I was like ""Fuck, that was a bad pick"".. And then I got my seared foie gras. Perfectly cooked. Super flavorful. Fantastic. The foie gras was followed by a rabbit prepared carefully with a great presentation. Very good flavors. My gf had a memorable Arctic char. The photo does not reflect how amazing that fish was. It's gotta be one of those dishes you remember for good as one of the best you've had ever. Spectacular and surprising flavors. The desserts were also awesome and the drinks we brought made the experience even more fun. What a gem!"

With the help of my waiter, I ordered the Tartare of the Day: Scallop and Meat of the Day: Bison with 1/2 frites and salad. Both were well prepared and delicious!! Service here is excellent! My waiter is attentive and so friendly!! I am definitely going to come back here for dinner as they have prix menu for dinner too!!

/user_details?userid=bewbNcbyR8QLmLfew6i34Q,Laurie S.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"Maybe because I have experienced so much better in Montreal, or maybe it is just me, but I think the meal was very below average. Montreal has a plethora of gorgeous, delicious, extraordinary restaurants, and to this date, I have only been totally disappointed once or twice. My inlaws live there, and it is always joyous to see them, I am always sad to leave. I want to grab them all and throw them in my car, abscond with them back to New York! Unfortunately, I cannot, and so have to wait until they visit me most of the time. One of my favorite sister in laws took my husband and I to Le Quartier General, and she knows her stuff, having been married to a French Chef for many years. Maybe it was the night? Maybe the chef drank too much the night before? Maybe he was absent? We all ordered the all-inclusive, which was a nice deal. I started off with the sweetbreads. Since I am no doyenne of sweetbreads, I had the wonderful opportunity to read about them recently, and from what I could perceive from the article, and I quote: ""The texture is extremely smooth, tender and moist, and the flavor is quite mild and creamy."" I couldn't wait to go somewhere to try them. Well, wasn't this convenient? A French restaurant? To my disbelief, the sweetbreads were hard. After reading about them, and being served these little rocks, I was so disappointed! Let's go on. Next course, a simple salad. Loved it so very much. Was outstanding in its simplicity, frisee and paper-thin slices of radish. Dressing was bright with lemon. Next course was the main course. After listening to our server, I decided on the pork, since it was described with lovely herbs, on a risotto base. Others had veal, my husband had the Magret (duck breast) over something, (he sat at the other end of the table), beef, etc. Maybe I just made a bad decision, but the pork was tasteless. The risotto was watery? Yes. Never had watery risotto in my life. My husband's magret though, was delicious, he gave me a tiny taste, and he said that he had had a nicely prepared piece of squash with it. Let's get to dessert. Am a big fan of churros, since my sister had lived in Spain for so many years, and I used to look forward to churros there -- there were none here, yet. Everyone received beautiful desserts... impeccable arrangements, so pretty, nobody wanted to desecrate them. Me? three small churros (hot from their oil baths), in a bowl with Hershey's chocolate syrup in the bottom? I quickly removed the churros from the bowl, onto a plate, sorry, but Hershey's is waay too sweet for me. It may not have been Hershey's, but it certainly was a dead ringer! So excited I put the first churro to my lips, took a crispy bite then realized it wasn't cooked in the middle. What a complete disappointment. I gave one to my husband, and he winced and said that it was not finished being cooked. Send it back, he said. I was too flushed from the heat inside. I wanted to go back to our hotel and go to sleep in some heavy air conditioning."

/user_details?userid=T8OR2mWMynZhdVJvQEsBhw,Amanda W.,"Berkeley, CA",4 star rating,"Went here for both lunch and dinner and I am a big fan of this place.  My personal favorites include the chocolate mousse for dessert which must ABSOLUTELY be tried and the calamari appetizer on the lunch menu.Although I loved the ambiance, service, and prices, there were a couple of downfalls in my meals.  The worst one was the rabbit dish I had for dinner was very dry.  The creme brulee on the lunch menu tasted burnt, with too thick of a crust, not something I would expect from a place of that caliber.  However, by avoiding those dishes (and maybe others I haven't tried?) you can find yourself a wonderful meal at Le Quartier General.  My cornish hen cooked two ways was delightful and I'm sure there's other treasures on the menu waiting to be discovered."
/user_details?userid=9bvlW5Gos1kxzvcM3c-12w,Don P.,"Hampden County, MA",4 star rating,"Yes, I am a fan of this wonderful little French bistro located in a residential area in Montreal's Plateau district. I would suggest if you wish to dine there think about making your reservation several months in advance of your visit as this is a very popular restaurant among the locals as well as visitors to the city. It is ranked as one of the very best BYOW Bistros in Montreal serving some of the finest locally sourced products from the region. The service from start to finish was impeccable. If you would like to have a 4 course meal order the Table d'hote which means adding $14 to any main course will include your appetizer, soup or salad, a main course and dessert and with an additional $9 that would include a foie gras app. I went with the Table d'Hote and had a Potato Celery Root Soup that was divine, the flavors were well balance and came through nicely. My one observation was if you serve soup in an over sized bowl the bowl must be heated in the kitchen or the soup cools rapidly which was the case here, however; the overall taste and flavor was masterful. I selected the Artic Char Gravlax which was superb, the fish was nicely flavored with dill without a hint of being over salted; it was served with little dollops of goat cheese and a dill basil pesto. My main course was Roast Lamb from Alberta over a vegetable couscous with kalamata olives. The lamb was cooked to a perfect medium rare; if you have never had Canadian lamb you are in for  wonderful treat. The couscous was a nice way to combine the dish; it was very tasty with the vegetables being perfect al dente. For dessert I chose the Crustard: Apple Cranberry Crumble with vanilla ice cream, a wonderfully balanced fruit combination which was not to sweet this proved to be a wonderful way to end the meal. Le Quartier Général is a top notch 4.5 star restaurant experience they do a superb job and should be on your list when visiting Montreal."

Their menu changes on a regular basis based on in-season/availability of items, but it seems that they usually have a nice variety of vegetable, fish, and meat options. Our entrees were both excellent: my husband had a steak that was cooked to perfection with the surrounding flavors melding together nicely, and I had a lamb dish served with couscous that was phenomenal.

The place looks nice, the menu looks nice and the waiter was funny, considerate and effective, anything you would expect from an excellent service. The disappointment was only in the food. First course soup or salad were both very good. Then the entrees were kind of sad. My friend got the smallest scallops I have ever seen, my boyfriend go the deer tataki wich was very thick and didn't have enough seasoning. Only my plate was good, the pan seared duck foie gras with homemade doughnut. By 1974, over two million students used computers in their classes. There was a generous portion of foie gras and tasted great, but it was an extra 10$. Then, there was the main dish. My stanstead rabbit was a let down. In my plate the carrot was more tasty than anything else. My boyfriend also got almost raw duck. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate marquise and it was pretty good.

The serving staff are top notch and will attentively explain everything to you in English so you can make an informed decision, though it certainly doesn't feel like you can go wrong....Our favourites from the night include the duck foie gras, steak tartare (an absolute winner), marieville duck (perfectly smoky and tender), and creme brûlée (creamy and amazing texture).  Best of all its bring-your-own-wine and unlike in Ontario, there's great wine to be found everywhere in MTL.All in all, this was a lovely 2 hour dining experience and make sure you reserve in advance!"

We were sitting in a corner inside the restaurant, so it's a little bit dark, but with a small candle, the ambience is quite good.They don't have menu. All entries, main dishes and desserts are written on a big blackboard. We were sitting right under it, so it's hard to read it. But the waiter explain it to us very thoroughly. My friends brought a very old wine, 21 years' old. Because of this, it was difficult to take out the oak plug. Fortunately, the restaurant is well equipped. The waiter used a tool (sorry I forgot the name of the tool) designed to open old bottle of wine, so that the oak plug didn't leave dregs in the wine. Also the waiter help us to open the bottle of wine My friend prepared a surprise birthday cake for me. They asked the restaurant to light the candle and then to cut the cake. My friends and I appreciated a lot the service of the restaurant.The food was very delicious!!! The soup of the day is very impressive with a little bit taste of coconut and ginger.

I had two of the specials: a duck tartare appetizer with orange infusion and an herbaceous creme binding it together with taro chips on top, and a sausage and shrimp dumpling main course with chanterelles and bok choy in an exquisite mushroom and veal gravy. I couldn't even talk. I just wanted to savor every bite. We finished with a delicious creme brûlée and coffee. The neighborhood is lots of fun as well. We wandered down to Ave Mont Royal afterwards. Lovely mix of residential and little shops. Definitely worth a special trip to eat here! Reservations are suggested, especially for dinner."

The hostess  told us it would take a few minutes before the waitress comes to explain the menu and take our orders, which I think is really nice (I don't know for other people, but I'd rather be notified of that delay rather than waiting and wondering if the waitress even saw us). When she arrived, the waitress was actually really kind and patient with orders. She was also very friendly, compared to other waiters who can sometimes be a little uptight in those kind of restaurants.This restaurant always does it right: the seasonal menu, the variety of dishes... from the soup to the dessert, the presentation and the fact that you bring your own wine. Everything is perfect. But make sure you book a week before! because it's pretty busy! But so worth it!"

Luckily the waitress speaks fluent English so even its a full French menu (on the chalkboard), she explains to us what they are. We had the creamy tomato soup (served cold), quail as appetizer, rabbit and veal chop as main course, creme brûlée and a cup of macchiato as dessert. Everything taste so good especially the veal chop, I asked for medium and it was served exactly how I wanted it cooked, not too rare, not too well, just awesome. Creme brûlée was a good try too. I was sick tonight so I had that ""upset"" face all night, hope they didn't think I dislike the dinner. I loved it, and I wished that they had one in Chicago.PS: they don't serve wine there so bring your own bottle."

But it took us a little longer to get into Montreal than anticipated so out concierge helped reschedule our ressies for Sunday evening at 9pm. This is a BYOB so came prepared with vino. The space is small but busy even in Sunday evening at 9! That's a good sign! The menu was meat heavy. But when we told them we had a vegetarian, they were more than willing to accommodate! Most good restaurants are prepared with one or two solid options for vegetarians. Two thumbs up! We started with the steak tartare. It was delicious!!! Hubs had the Nordic shrimp salad. Also very tasty and fresh. Mains were duck magret and rabbit for me. The duck Magret was done very well. My rabbit was super tender and yummy. Onto dessert! Nougat Glacé was the bomb dot com. My lemon Curd was really nice as well! Looking fwd to coming back here next time.

Why call it ""bistro"" rather than ""gastronomy""? Despite the constant efforts to innovate on flavors and decors, the dishes that taste like french ""grandma's cooking"" always win, and they may not succeed as well on their creative side: 1st service: Cauliflower cold soup (creative side fail): I agree with previous comments that 'i'd better have it warm'. I've had many innovative cold soups / gazpacho before and this does not enhance the flavors or give any interesting texture when serving cold2nd service:  Duck tartare (traditional side win): shallot, moutarde, wine sauce- totally classic and totally satisfying!3rd service: Rabbit (traditional side win): Like grandma's cooking, it contains lots of ""Love"" = butter+salt+wine+butterrrr. If you're looking for gastronomy, you may say ""a bit too dry, too salty and heavy"". For me, it is actually super satisfying, especially when paired with a glass of old Bordeaux. 4th service: Chocolate mousse (win/fail- too full to tell)!

Well, we were given the wrong the order and he was provided with fish instead of the pork. Disappointed. Since we waited so long, i simply switched meals with him. We told the waitress it was wrong and she blamed it on us and later left without checking in on her tables. Turns out the table next to us ordered our wrong meal, she must have duplicated the order. The manager of the evening ended up giving us ""free dessert"" BUT it was included in the $14. The service was lackluster and you end of waiting a lot.

You can choose from different starters and main dishes on the menu. The waiters will present every meal one by one in a very delectable way. The hard thing is to choose 1 only. For the starter, they also have the Tartare du moment: Once got the duck, salmon, and the deer (my favorite).You can also add an little extra to have the desert and 2nd starter. (worth it all the way) I am not a sweet tooth, but seriously it's the best desert I had (nougat glacé is a must!)For the quality, the price is more than excellent!Bring a good bottle of wine and enjoy your meal (tartare, meat, fish, risotto), with friends, bf, gf or family."

Mains:Lapin de Stanstead - rabbit thigh stuffed with rabbit chorizo with fennel, carrots, bok choy, and incredible creamed corn.  The chorizo in the middle was a bit dry and overall I just don't love sausage, but the thigh meat was perfect.  Lamb from Alberta - cream, mint, a hearty grain, and some other flavors that blended together marvelously.  Very rich - too rich for me - but Mrs. F was ecstatic. Desserts: Chocolate Marquise, Lemon Curd.  Lemon Curd was out of this world.  We were quite full by this point and the last few bites required effort.  ;)Service was amazing, the small army of servers were extremely knowledgeable about all the menu items and were quick to refill water and pour our wine for us.  The table next to ours forgot to bring wine and the server was very happy to pour them a glass from our bottle. The space itself was intimate and romantic.  I guess ""bustling"" is a good descriptor for the noise level - but in an exciting way.  The small number of tables and modest number of staff, with a semi-open kitchen, felt very egalitarian as opposed to some larger establishments.  Mrs. F observed that the cooks looked very calm.  Who wants to eat at a restaurant where the cooks aren't happy and all the servers are stressed out?  Not me."

Food: the food is the best part about this restaurant. The flavors in the sides and dishes combined perfectly were new and surprisingly delicious. I had the lamb, medium rare, and the garnish was like a slaw which had bright bits of mint and other flavors that tied the dish together perfectly. The meat was good quality and cooked to perfection.  My S.O. Had the short rib, which was well balanced with the sides and delicious as well. However, we both preferred the lamb. Both appetizers (soup and salad) were delicious as well, and the dessert (chocolate one) was sinfully rich and more than enough for 2 people to share. Service: the service was excellent, attentive, friendly, and they had no problem translating everything into English, as we don't speak French. Atmosphere: the decor is simple, sleek and homey, with a fireplace and a roaring fire at the wall. It feels almost like being in someone's home, in that you can peek  over the counter at what's going on in the kitchen.  (And all of the male staff are easy on the eyes ;).

I adore the ambiance here: right on a quaint Plateau corner, small, unassuming, perfect lighting, cool tiles and even though it's loud, it's not so loud that you have to scream to your table mate in order to be heard.

He was French, from France I believe, and he was kind enough to read us the entire menu in English even though only 2 in the party needed the translation.  The tartare for the night was duck and it was delish. For entree I did the short rib which was equally as good.  My husband did the venison which was perfectly cooked as per the chef.  The desserts were equally as good.  The lemon tart was to-die-for.

This is French cuisine of fine quality, at a price that makes food like this otherwise inaccessible to many people. For only $12 on top of the entree price, you are treated to an appetizer and dessert. The decor is clean and modern, with an open kitchen that is fun to peak into. The service is highly trained. If the French is daunting for you, worry not, your waiter will very patiently describe to you everything that is being served that day. In terms of the appetizers, we loved everything! The salad was perfectly tossed and well balanced, the leek soup was refreshing. The short rib was absolutely delicious, the veal was melt in your mouth, fish was perfectly flakey, rabbit was seasoned perfectly (the only bad thing I can say about the entrees was the rabbit was a tad dry). The desserts were not as consistently wonderful -- while the chocolate mousse was absolutely divine, once you compared it to anything else, everything else was mildly disappointing. Make reservations as soon as you can, they are often fully seated at least a few days in advance. Another great perk -- BYOB! They will bring out an ice bucket to chill your white and rose, and serve anything you bring to them with finesse."

The food was not what we expected, and definitively not worth the price. We ordered the fois gras for 20 dollars, and barely took a few bites. The rest of the dish was unfinished, inedible.

We arrived a few minutes early, and were seated promptly. My boyfriend was taking me here, and he made sure to call ahead of time to make sure they could do something vegetarian for me, as the menu is very meat-heavy. There were no veggie main courses, but a couple of starters at least. We both opted for the table d'hôte, as it was only 14 dollars on top of a plat (all of which are around 24-30$) so seemed like a good deal. We both started with the cauliflower soup, which was nice. Then I had a beet salad that I really enjoyed (I love how beets are so popular in MTL at the moment!) and my boyfriend had a tuna starter which he said was amazing. For my main, the chef concocted a vegetarian gnocchi with asparagus, different veggies, and a delicious pesto sauce. The gnocchi was really good, with an amazing texture, and the dish overall was delicious. My partner had a fish main course, again which he thought was great. We shared the Apple & churros dessert (I LOVED the apples and ice cream, could have lived without the churros) and actually got our second dessert (the chocolate cake) to go because we were too full to eat it then. Overall, the food was great, ambiance nice, and the service was very attentive despite the fact that they were really busy. Would definitely recommend to someone looking for a special night out."

The service was incredible, the food was unbelievable. The servers actually looked to be enjoying being there- and were so knowledgable on the menu. For a 4 course meal, this was completely reasonably priced, and for such quality french cuisine the atmosphere was so relaxed and down to earth.

I had a foie gras dish that was out of this world, my rabbit for my main was tender and juicy served with andouille sausage. My boyfriend had the surf and turf that was served with a roast duck leg instead of steak, which was a really nice twist and a lobster tail. Even the salads, which on a price fixe menu can be boring, were lovely-- the pickled vegetables in them added a little acidic zip.Basically, we had a fantastic multi course meal for under $100. We tipped well since there was no corkage on the wine and everything was wonderful.. The ambiance was small and humble, but I really can't fault this place for anything. Especially the value.

/user_details?userid=tB13dcZFu2fCon-th_-eDQ,Sam S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Simple and good cuisine. Well presented. Fresh produces. My favourite restaurant in Montreal.Very good value for money (about 25 for lunch / 45 for diner). You must bring your own wine.You must have a reservation.Only cons: always a bit noisy

Was annoying since we had a baby sitter for the night. All other restaurants in the area were booked up. However, the guy at front tried his best to help us find a place, eventually reserving a spot at their other restaurant.We ended up at Etat-manger, the sister restaurant, arranged by the other restaurant. The service was excellent and the food was good. They were nice enough to charge us only the main course price for the table d'hôte. So in the end our anniversary dinner was great."
/user_details?userid=yFPvJj833AT0O6Vq6HUmPQ,Corey J.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,No problem getting last minute reservation. Wonderful pulled pork croquette and nice soup to start. Steak and veal were the mains. They were good. Wasn't overly a fan of the pure but the meats were good. The dessert was just awesome. The apple dessert was quite great as well the creme Brule. Solid meal all in all. Table note was well worth it.
/user_details?userid=foC7W9iCzvopo9LVLFAvqg,Don S.,"Minneapolis, MN",5 star rating,"Not be redundant, but like everyone else, I have to give this place 5 or more stars. Excellent spot in the Plateau. Everything about it - food, service, atmosphere - is tops.Starting with the food - they offer 3 courses: appetizer, main, and dessert. Do at least the first two, if you can go for the dessert, and have a coffee. From the appetizer menu, we had the octopus tart and the scallop. The tart had three chunks of perfectly done octopus on top of a pastry along with caramelized onions, tomato confit, and microgreens, served with a sour cream sauce infused with roasted garlic. The layers of flavors were terrific, incredibly balanced, and complimentary. The sauce in particular, with little salt, worked incredibly well with the dish. The scallop app was one big, juicy, perfectly seared sweet scallop in a pea puree. Fantastic. Tasted like spring.For the mains, we had the rabbit/lapin and the duck/canard. Both incredible. The rabbit dish is a leg, prepared two ways - on the bone, and stuffed with rabbit meat that tasted of bacon. The roasted squash puree was a great accompaniment to it. Savory, juicy, delicious perfection. The duck magret is prepared to order; we had it medium rare. It comes seared and sliced, served with a rustic fruit compote, and a delicious  barley with demi-glace sauce.For dessert, we had the apple crumble and the financier. The crumble was layered rounds of caramelized apple with rounds of pastry/cookie, served with a vanilla ice cream. The financier was our favorite, almond cake with a light cheese and served with a blueberry-maple sauce. the espresso was excellent as well.They have two seatings per night, at 6 and 9. They also serve lunch on weekdays. Reservations are a must, since they have limited space, and word is clearly out. We didn't know about this spot when we arrived in Montreal but within a week, two people recommended it to us.The service is gracious, friendly, accommodating (for those of us with limited French), and extremely attentive. They manage the seatings with incredible ease. The space is comfortable, laid-back, and unfussy.Last but not least - this is a BYO spot. You bring your own bottle of wine to have with your meal. As a result, I could hardly believe it when the bill came - the meal for two described came to just over $90. Located in a quiet area off the beaten path in the Plateau, I suspect this place will be very busy for a long time. In a city where we've had great meals, this was among the best experiences we've had."
/user_details?userid=epc3A9SHHBfOwxIOCPW7eA,Lindsay W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The Spot:Walking in off the street quartier generale feels like what my dinning room would be like around thanks giving, only bigger and full of strangers.The fireplace and dim but not to dim lighting give it a warm feeling. It is a BYO so be prepared to have them offset liquor sales with paying full price for your meal.Like many other restaurants of late it has the chalkboard menu but fortunately a well verse waiter came to explain every option and there are multiple chalkboards to avoid you hovering over other tables feeling something like the family dog.What's Really Good:Now everything is very French and we didn't ask for any translations so we can't tell you if they can accommodate an unilingual but everything sounds amazing. You'll have trouble narrowing down your choices so going in groups may be the best choice. We were two and a third may have been the way to go.For the record we ordered duck tartare, bavette d'agneau, filet boeuf and a surf & turf which comprised of duck and lobster. Not to mention the soup, salad and desserts which compliment the Table d'hôte.Duck tartare was a perfect portion size, fresh and very flavorful. Coupled with mushrooms it's a MUST try. The bavette is fresh and well cooked but isn't killer and can be skipped. The entrees also came out very promptly, a pleasantry many restaurants ignore much like te bread which was wonderfully fresh. Nothin in life is worse than hard bread and hard butter.Pardon our french but the duck and lobster is the f**king shit! The onion puree that accompanies it steals te show. I nearly forgot to share the lobster claw it's THAT GOOD.We ordered the filet de boeuf rare. Its nice to get what you asked for and not med rare. The potatoes are fried in bacon grease which ma give you a heart attack but you'll die smilling.Dessert time, marquise au chocolat and creme brulé.Marquise has a fruit topping and an almond floor that reminiscent of a deluxe coffee crisp wafer. Its incredibly rich and will put an end to that diet you're working on but you only live once so go for it. Its a great sharing desert but don't be ashamed when you want it back for the last bite.The crême brulé is great but most french restaurants will nail that dish so we'll advise you to take a risk and try something else.Good luck and let us know what you think!You'll want to knowTheir menu is written in french and the wait staff will likely address you in french, don't be alarmed they're quite friendly. They're open late and will take last minute reservations so don't settle for a sloppy poutine just because its 10pm and hunger struck. Lastly, like I mentioned above, its a BYO so don't forget to make a run to the liquor store first. There are two SAQ's on Mt. Royal, one open til 10pm seven days a week."
/user_details?userid=ePY4FMzYvu0QVAeSLeHf3w,Jennifer A.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"This is the kind of place you can BYOB! This is a true french restaurant. Everything is in french and it was cute how the waitress explained everything in English for me. I came here for lunch (but I hear it's a great deal for dinner and there's foie gras). The lunch entree and appetizer was 20 Canadian dollars. I ordered the tuna tartare and it was absolutely delicious! A dish that was appealing to my eyes with the perfect amount of vegetables, a slice of a purple egg, and the tuna was moist. I felt like I was falling in love with every bite. I ordered a beef steak with frites as my entree and the beef was cooked to perfection (definitely ""medium""). The frites were delicious and loved their aioli sauce. I liked this restaurant a lot and would come back if I lived around here!"
/user_details?userid=MKibuFMkiokF_U8uoQX-Qg,Jasmin B.,"Brampton, Canada",4 star rating,"Quaint restaurant that appears to be frequented by locals. The cuisine is simple, fresh, and thoughtfully prepared.  I had the carrot soup, beef with risotto and creme brulee, and my date had the zucchini flower app and rabbit with carrot puree. The beef cut was surprisingly served on top a large bone and the risotto had a rustic preparation. The rabbit was flavorful and tender.  We enjoyed that we could bring our own wine and that it was an intimate setting -- great for a date."

It was like going through a break-up - there were tears;  I was in denial. I panicked. Thankfully, I read about QG and after a delicious three-course meal. I immediately fell in love with it. This cozy bistro nestled in the residential area of the Plateau serves outstanding French fare for a very reasonable price. I have brought friends there and they all loved it, too. You definitely have to make reservations for dinner. Parking can be a bit difficult (as to be expected anywhere in the Plateau) but it is all worth it. Did I mention it's BYOB?  I am actually a bit worried it's going to be too popular now, that getting a table would be more difficult! But, I believe in spreading the good word on great eats so - you're welcome : )"

The main course changes every time you go but it seems like the quality never changes. I look forward to going back! The creme brûlée is a must have!!!"
/user_details?userid=yHykh6VFpsH_V62bRaq3FQ,Sara C.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"eat pray love:Plateau:Really, really good food is a spiritual thing.  Truly.  So be prepared to be blessed.One week today I had a holy-er-than-thou meal at the hidden le Quartier général.  I say hidden because it's off the beaten path, as it were.  There are two things you need to know before we continue.  The first is APPORTEZ VOTRE VIN.  And in Montreal that means no fee-no fuss.  Second, reservations are mandatory.  Seatings at 6 or 9.  My sister first heard about Quartier from our hair-god.  He recommended it about six months ago.  And he has wonderful taste in food - recall Les Heritiers.  We arrived promptly for our 9 pm reservation - as did everyone else.  It is an understated restaurant with beautiful details.  Don't worry if you can't read or understand le menu du soir .  Quartier's servers are equipped to describe every delectable detail.  Our server was especially good - you can tell she genuinely loves the food.  And why wouldn't she?  They have so many brilliant dishes to choose from.  We finally settled on three different appetizers, mains, and desserts.  To share is to spread love.I recommend the table d'hote (set menu) because it's only an additional $12 (onto the price of the main).This meal had some of the most delicious things I've put in my mouth all year...pause.  Let's begin shall we?  Soup ou salad?I went with the salad because I rarely eat enough veggies.  It was simple.  Greens in a really delightful light citrus dressing.  The appetizers: Tataki de marlin bleu - lightly seared tuna with some sort of sour cream/creme fraiche goat cheese/chevre sauce and miso-glaze with some edamame.Foie gras pol (an extra $10).  One of the best foies I've had served with brioche  ""Crab Cake""  - perfectly fried crust with a delicate and subtle inside.I love foie, but my favourite was the marlin bleu.  That white creamy sauce was O-mazing.After a perfectly timed break we were served our mains: Souris d'agneau aka lamb - not the shank but from the butt - yes...It was served with barley, and not the tasteless tree-hugging barley but the flavourful rich barley.Beef 1855 Tender Loin - Medium rare boeuf with 1855 cheese atop perfect mush potatoes. Cod with fennel and cabbage - Light as air but packed with flavour.My favourite?  The lamb...perfection.The apple crumble and cheesecake were okay.  I didn't like the shortbread cookie that came with the crumble - it was rock hard.  And, um, I don't like cheesecake.Their vanilla crème brûlée, on the other hand, was magically delicious.  I let out a hallelu, hallelu, halleluuuu...iah. le Quartier général really serves something special.  It's not just the ingredients that matter, it's what they do with it.  A delicious meal that makes you climax over, and over, and over again.  That's pretty insane.  Get it on"

/user_details?userid=T40u1FJXOOYs3rmOnwGm6A,Kiera S.,"London, United Kingdom",5 star rating,"Highly recommend - might even be my new favourite restaurant in town. Surpassed expectations for the price range, with a reasonably priced table d'hote for an extra $12. Tataki/blue marline appetizer was declicious, as was the main course (veal with fois gras - one of the best meals I have had in Montreal). Crab cake appetizer was still very good, but not on par with the rest of the meal. Maybe I just don't like crab cakes in general though... Creme brulée for dessert was also amazing. Staff were very friendly and we did not feel rushed to leave at the end of the night. That said, there was one very enthusiastic waiter who kept coming by the table to re-fold our napkins when we weren't looking. Oh well."
/user_details?userid=RAwuzt8fmM-WtWul3TgKiA,Ashley B.,"Calgary, Canada",5 star rating,Qua tier general is the best dining experience we've had in a long time. I was in town for a couple of nights and A friend of mine got us a reso at 9 pm on a Tuesday night and the place was packed! We brought our own wine and no corking fees were charged! Awesome! The food was incredible and the service was even better! Every person who touched our table was absolutely fantastic.  There are no menus at this restaurant but the servers do such a great job explaining each dish for you. I can't say enough to praise this place. They're doing everything right and it shows by the crowd that is there everyday and popularity it's gained. Great job!!
/user_details?userid=RBFZ7Ys_ysnS6-RePUs9qQ,Panos P.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,Simply amazing.  Every dish was delicious from the seared Marlin and duck tartare to the aged filet and veal chop.  The service is superb.  Given all that plus BYOB (wine) it can be the best value for a very good meal
