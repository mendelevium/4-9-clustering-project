/user_details?userid=Uhe5eNNOrnmcvesspLnBDA,Joe J.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Less than a creative menu and a total dull ambiance which doesn't fit the name as you might be misleading that you will be going into a journey of exploration for a great taste but not quite! My spicy ramen wants that spicy and I wasn't asked how spicy wanted tobe! I had more Chicken skin than actual meat so I moved to the lamb shish to overcome the lack of protein in my ramen but it was undercooked and chewier than a piece of rubber, not that I tried to chew rubber before but one can imagine how it would be due to nature of rubber. No checking on the customers if they need anything else or how was the meal simply pay and leave as I usually do."

We got 1 napkin for the both of us and before we sat down she used a dirty cloth to clean the table. The menus were dirty and stuck to the table and just awful.Bathroom speaks volume as well very dirty.I ended up getting extremely sick and will not return what a mess even oyster mania can't save this place.
/user_details?userid=ElFJieKozbuAeElS8ZJLNA,Kristina D.,"San Jose, CA",3 star rating,"My fiancé and I were craving late night sushi and we got here about 12am. The vibe and the atmosphere was great! Good music good vibe. We ordered sashimi, $12.00. Veg Tempura, $6. Shrimp tempura, $6. Tonkatsu Ramen(added spicy), $15. Fresh oysters, $1.00.Overall, food was a 4.5/10. Ramen tasted like spicy water. The tempura was very crunchy () however, the vegetables were still undercooked. The sashimi was the best part, tasted very fresh and I would get that again, however it didn't come with a lot. (Forgot to take pictures of the rest because we were really hungry)Our server was the only one working but she wasn't as accommodating/slow service. Especially because there was only 3 couples in the restaurant. Didn't get enough attention."

We had the lobster roll, fried goat cheese, salmon nigiri, and shrimp tempura. I'm not sure about the other menu items, but all of the ones listed above are some of the best I have had!"
/user_details?userid=0Se8OFrPpi6wE2TY2IVTLA,Eric N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Having a late night dinner at this Izakaya. It used to very good, surprisingly this time is a bit of disappointment.The fish aren't as fresh as it use to be, black cod was way too sweet. We also ordered toro, that one is fresh but beside fresh, toro sashimi also required the chef's cutting skills... And it wasn't there at all.Ambiance wise... It's kind of strange, it's kind of quiet on Friday night for a izakaya bar located in the heart of downtown. We almost thought it was closed when we stepped in."
/user_details?userid=LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"You know when you're so excited and it's just a let down?Let me start by saying that this place has the utmost potential. The space is GORGEOUS (I would rent it for a party any day) and the hostess/waitress and kitchen staff yell the traditional welcome as anyone enters the door. The menu is a little too large for what I think they could handle, however very reasonably priced and offering a large variety of plates. The dishes themselves are crafted and look very visually appealing.Sadly, the flavor just isn't there. Of the 8 or so dishes we tried only 2 of them hit the mark. It seemed like there was 1 or 2 key ingredients missing in each dish that left the food unrefined in flavor, unbalanced or just unimpressive - this despite the fact that they were plated to perfection. IF they managed to complete the dishes as I believe they meant to, this place would be amazing.If you decide to check them out I suggest you go as a group of 2-4. You can order 3-4 dishes to split amongst you to test the kitchen that day and see if you're willing to stay and order the rest of a meal. Again, this place has a lot of potential, it's just missing that little bit of flavor to make it worthwhile."

/user_details?userid=ubmElvMljRat7jXBBZtj3g,Ming Dong L.,"La Salle, Canada",1 star rating,"The food was fine, not surprisingly good but not bad neither. Waiter was too busy to take appropriate care for customers, not her fault really, but the restaurant was not packed, it was just weird that she seems so busy all around but customers were still hanging there waiting for nothing.I went with a friend for oystermania, they said because we didnt make reservation, it will be impossible for them to have time opening them for us, but it was the last day so I had no choice but to ask for credit from Restomania. The food came at a very slow pace, usually in a restaurant you dont wait more than 20 minutes for your first food to be served, but here you may need to wait for 40 or 1 hour. I really think this is the biggest issue of this restaurant, and I wish the owner could improve their serving pace, because this is really unreasonably wasting of time.I kindly asked one waiter about why it took so long for the food, he answered because of oystermania, one cook is sent to open the oysters and japanese food usually take time to make. I do not fully agree but nonetheless, its not my business.Feeling nauseated for both of us when got out, will certainly not return."

/user_details?userid=WNIPX_y4JtIaEEWf8aR2DQ,Denny C.,"San Bruno, CA",1 star rating,"Don't bother. Food was mediocre as Izakayas go and the service was dismal. I went in on a late night after Just For Laughs festival (around 11pm) for a bite to eat. Ordered all of five dishes and it took forever to get our food, and here's the kicker... we were one of four other parties in the place so there was no reason for the food to take this long. When the food was served, the Ebi Mayo was not crisp like tempura should be, the Chicken Yakitori was like warm (and took the longest to come out), the Miso Cod was luke warm and a bit under done, the only things that came out right were the beer and the raw oysters (neither of which require cooking). The table next to us also had a bunch of complaints and had sent numerous dishes back to the kitchen. As Japanese Izakayas go, this one is a definite skip. Kudos to the young man who comped us the Yakitori and apologized for the restaurant after hearing us complain about how much time it took for two simple chicken skewers to be cooked and served, but at that point, we had passed the point of no return in our perception of this place. Needless to say, we won't be returning."
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Nice place to get the beer and some Japanese tapas. Their takoyaki is pretty good. Overall, I don't really see this place as date bar, but mostly a place to hang out with friends. It's pretty spacious so it can fit a large crowd for sure. Overall, it's a good place to check out if you're looking for a place to have drinks with bunch of your friends."
/user_details?userid=WmIqb6uCqJbxWp9k7ZU-hw,Jennifer T.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I first was really excited about this restaurant because I'm a fan of ramen and I like Izakaya. They sometimes also offer wagyu beef and not a lot of places offer that in Montreal. However, some of my friends went there before me and told me Sumi Dojo is that good. They said they don't recommend it and they think Kinka has better Izakaya food. So I scratched this restaurant out of my to-go-list..If my friend didn't pick Sumi Dojo to celebrate her birthday, I don't think I will come here. But I guess it was a good opportunity for me to taste their food instead of basing my opinion on my friends, huh? I've already eaten before coming to my friend's very late birthday dinner (9 pm) so I didn't order a lot.They have a big selection of dishes on their menu, ranging from cold entrees (salmon tartar, tuna tataki, etc.) to grilled dishes (Miso marinated beef tongue, Hokke, etc,), from fried dishes (takoyaki, fried gobo, shrimp tempura, etc.) to hot dishes (okonomiyaki, gyoza, Miso soup, Edamame, etc.). They also offer noodles (ramen, udon), desserts (green tea mille-feuille, etc.) and cocktails (sake bomb, martini, etc.) I recommend ordering different dishes and split the bill with your friends in order to not be broke and to be able to try different dishes. The portion is small and they are not the most wallet-friendly in terms of price.  There were many things I wanted to try like their Miso marinated beef tongue (Imadake has really good ones by the way!), takoyaki, spicy pork belly (but the word ""spicy"" stopped me from ordering this! If my boyfriend was there, I would force him to order this and take a bite just to taste it! He can have the rest if it is too spicy for me haha!) and soft-shell crab. I finally decided to order their Karaage and Japanese Ika (grilled squid).I was disappointed by their Karaage and Japanese Ika. They both came with a mayonnaise dip. The karaage was well-seasoned but with salt and pepper (although it didn't taste like Taiwanese salt and pepper fried chicken/Popcorn chicken), you can really taste the pepper in it. I disliked the fact that my chicken was mixed with fat (it wasn't a little bit/slim layer of fat, it was a big chunk of fat). The taste wasn't bad but it was surely not authentic Izakaya Karaage.My Japanese Ika was okay and beautifully grilled (not a lot of burned spots like my friend's squid), the mayonnaise didn't make it better or worse. The squid was quite small compared to other Izakaya restaurant I've had in Montreal.I tried my friend's Cassis Sour (Cassis, Calpico, Sake, Gekkeikan Soda) and it tasted fruity and sweet. My friend's ramen was average but she liked it. It wasn't too salty (I can't recall which one she got but she said the soup was chicken broth) but I prefer a creamier and silkier soup like Tonkotsu (pork broth). My Japanese friend ordered their pizza sushi but I don't know if she liked it or not. My other friends ordered their deep-fried goat cheese, shrimp tempura, spicy ramen (she said it is not good and too spicy), lobster roll (everyone said it was good), gyoza (my friends seemed to like it), chicken yaki udon (my friend said it was average).My friends have different opinion on their deep-fried goat cheese, they said it didn't taste like goat cheese and it was good. One of my friends disliked it so much after one bite though.The shrimp tempura came with ~6 shrimps BUT the shrimp size was SOOOO small that I couldn't figure out what it was at first! This dish is ridiculous in my opinion.. For this price, I would expect bigger shrimp size.Sumi Dojo is really loud music so it is not the best place to have a romantic or quiet dinner. There were a lot of waiters and waitresses but they aren't the most attentive. I didn't get my cup of water until after my dishes came *which was an hour after I've been seated down. And throughout the night, my cup was empty because they didn't come to refill it. I had to get up and ask them to refill it, to which the waitress said another person would do it (why can't she just do it? It is not like she is not ""our"" waitress.. She was one of the waiters/waitresses serving our table).In conclusion, Sumi Dojo would be a good place for a drink at the bar but food-wise, I wouldn't recommend. Like one of the Yelp reviews said, it ""Did not taste like authentic japanese izakaya food. Instead, the food was chinese style fusion""."
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My husband and I went there on Monday dinner time during the Mural Festival. The place is pretty empty. I have to admit we were attracted by the happy hour deal which offers discount on 4 appetizers when you order Sapporo beer any size. Those appetizers can be chosen from octopus ball, grilled chicken skewer, fried chicken and soy bean, ranging from 1 to 3 dollars, normally priced as 3 to 9 dollars. One choice per drink. The dishes we had are octopus ball, eggplant with pork in miso sauce/pan fried, eel omelette roll. We like them all. Especially the Takoyaki is the best I have tasted ( tako=octopus ). However, the miso pork was so salty that we have to order a bowl of rice, which should be a very good combination unless we are on a low-carb diet. Overall it is a very pleasant place to have a beer with friend on a summer evening."

I only had drinks but some of my friends had food and from my few bites, they weren't bad. We mostly had sake bombs and rainbow bombs, which were a lot of fun! However, the service was awful.

/user_details?userid=W2HOnMpyvGK09Th21RYqvg,Jamie J.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I usually just search up restaurants and never write reviews, but I saw some reviews that I disagree with so here I am:Sumi Dojo is one of the best restaurants that I've ever been to in Montreal. My first experience was at the Grand opening where I went with couple of my friends.  We ordered the squid, the pork ribs, and the beef tataki, which were amazing (beef tataki had this really original sauce that I loved). I also tried their ramen. It was too salty for my taste, so I told my waitress about it, and she apologized and said she'll pass the message to the chef. I went a week after, took the same ramen, and to my surprise, it was perfect for my taste. The same waitress recognized me and told me that the chef had changed it. I was pleasantly surprised at how this restaurant had such great adaptability towards its customers, one of the greatest quality a restaurant can have. As a regular customer, I can testify that I've never gotten a service that was dissatisfying. I had to ask for water time to time, but every restaurant has its busy days where the staffs cannot be at the best disposition for everyone. I can say that they definitely do their best to meet everybody's expectation. And Food.. Food is just amazing. Especially their fresh seafood, it never disappoints me. I always go visit the tray of fresh fishes, and the chef always kindly explains what they have on menu that day. At one of my first visits, my waitress told me that everything is homemade, and with the exception for their takoyakis, nothing is kept frozen. Compared to the quality and effort of the food, I find the pricing very reasonable. I prefer having freshly made non frozen food than going to other izakayas that I know that almost everything is kept frozen. Also, I recommend the jasmine panna cotta to everyone for dessert.. It is so soft and tasty, I want to order more each time. The decor is absolutely beautiful. The lights on the ceiling make this place look very hip and i've never heard a negative comment on the decor each time I bring new friends.I just wanted to share my beautiful experiences at this izakaya with everyone. I'm not saying that the other reviews aren't true, I'm sure they could have experienced bad things. But as a REGULAR customer, I can honestly say that this izakaya is so recommendable. Great for lunch, for dinner, for night out with friends, and for a romantic date."
/user_details?userid=zX0v7edWnSAo-8hEly-_1w,Niem X.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"If you decide to come here, please get the jasmine tea panna cotta. It is so good. It comes with ice cream. I think the default option is ginger, but ask for black sesame and you won't be disappointed. SO GOOD.Now, should you decide to come here? Yes. They have a nice assortment of small plates, including a lot of deep fried foods. The tonkotsu ramen ($12) is decent, but not outstanding. I would say this place is situated at least at the higher end of the $$ price range if you want a good experience. Go with at least 3 or 4 friends, order a bunch of things to share, split the bill.With that said, this place has the perfect atmosphere for a nice date. It's dark-ish but warm, feels very intimate. Our service from John was exceptional. Seriously, he was so helpful with the menu, let us take our time, provided great and (seemingly) honest suggestions, made us feel so at home. OH and if you're wondering where to put your coats, you can lift the lid of the seat and keep it in there. Space-saving wonders. With that said, I don't know how Sumi Dojo compares to the other new izakaya place up the street. It's pretty interesting two izakaya places opened up around the same time so close to each other."
/user_details?userid=OtMW3wzS-akygZm7erZ3qA,Kevin N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Service: The waitress my friends and I had was really nice and charming. Even though my some of our friends were late, they didn't seem unhappy or irritated. She can often to make sure that everything was good and proved to really know the menu when we asked questions about the drinks or the food they offered. Score: 5/5Food: I tried the chicken karaage, the tonkatsu ramen, the whole squid and the fried checken skin. The fried chicken karaage and the fried chicken skins were simply amazing. The skins were really crunchy and the chicken karaage was also crunchy and well seasoned. The mayo sauce that came with the chicken karaage elevated the taste in my opinion. The squid was good, but nothing special. Again, the mayonaise made it taste better. I was a bit disapointed with the ramen. I usually like my ramen either really salty or spicy, but I found the broth a bit bland. But the addition of what I believe to be fried onions was really nice, and the meat was good. Score: 4/5Ambiance: They played some K-Pop while I was eating, which I found weird since it is supposed to be a japanese restaurant (izakaya). Except that detail, the ambiance was really nice. The staff greeted us in japanese when we arrived and left, and when we ordered sake bombs, they smashed on a huge ass drum. Also, we ordered a sake bomb taht was not on the menu, the fire sake bomb. The decor was also really nice.Score: 4/5Dish you MUST order: Chicken karaage"

The waiting was RIDICULOUSLY long for a restaurant only had two tables (out of 20) of customer. I really had no idea why. They seriously need to hire more people to help run this place. Wagyu was so over priced (4 small pieces for $30.) Flavour was fine but not worth the crazy waiting at all. There are plenty of other Izakaya in Montreal you can go, just not this one."

We sat right next to the open kitchen and you can see them pulling out meat and fish out of plastic containers that haven't been refrigerated. Food tastes disgusting.

My friend ordered the chicken, which was greasy and filled with nerves, unchewable. The ramen soup tasted like water, it was disgusting. To top it all off, the gyoza had hair INSIDE. They were greasy, unfresh, basically the whole experience was not good.We told the manager about it, he couldn't care less. We had to explain that really, that it was simply unacceptable food, and that we didn't want to pay for the food we didn't even eat. All they did was offer us sake shots, which i couldn't even take because i was already feeling nauseous. And it wasn't just me, my friend as well.So I dont know what this review will do, but never ever go there, i lost my money and felt nauseous the whole remaining of the night."

The bar was surrounded by fireplace that made warming envoriment and warming vibe! We walked in and hostess scream 'Irasshamisae'(which means welcome) and whole staff even kitchen staff scream. We felled very welcoming! Then the chair love the idea! Every time I go Izakaya we always have to hold our jacket because it's too tight or nowhere to hang but they had a chair where you can open to put their belonging which was wonderful!Our waiter Josh? Or John I'm not too sure but he was explaining how their sauces were made with bones over night as well as their pork stock (48hours)!And also receive fresh oysters and fish; which changed every week. Homemade bacon and smoke ribs that explains the quality of the foodI used to live in Japan for couple years their food made me think I was back in Japan!Sake bomb? So much fun! You will see whole staff come out scream with you and their is one guy playing drum that makes the vibe of the Izakaya!And lastly! The service was very excellent! When other table had sake bomb the staff ask if it was alright to scream. Sure why not!!When we walked out they screamed one more time 'arrigatogozaimashita'(which means thank you very much)We had the best Izakaya experience at SUMI DOJO!!
