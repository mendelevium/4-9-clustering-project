/user_details?userid=aNS_fOw7jMRpPOoJhDTRgg,Noelle M.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,Stopped in Saturday night. My boyfriend and I were looking to get some frozen margaritas and we found this place. The decor was very nice and looked super fun. The restaurant has a nice outside section but we chose to sit. We ordered 2 margaritas that were delicious and just perfect. I ordered the chilaques and my boyfriend got the quesadilla. Everything was well seasoned and the waiter was extremely pleasant and attentive
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,I came to Mañana when I noticed their beautifully Mexican themed fabric draped tables on the terasse. I settled in to get a quick drink before an event. The pineapple margarita was hand blended and great for 10$ generous for its size too! I liked the interior decor as very traditional and bright. I am not a huge fan of Mexican food but this place looks like an authentic spot worth checking out !
/user_details?userid=lD4HStgxvpZtTCod34rZrQ,Val L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Honestly we walked in to an empty restaurant and gave it a try...reviews weren't great on Yelp (better on Google) but we had a fantastic meal! Service was excellent, waitress was so polite and helpful. Food was delicious and the portions were perfect. Plates are around 15-20$ each and a pitcher of Margarita is 30$. I don't know why people always think that paying a bit more for Mexican food isn't worth it but I totally think that the prices were fair for the quality of the food. You pay 15$ at Tres Amigos and it's terrible."
/user_details?userid=Tarq0ZDcFVm-hjiUtQsxQw,David S.,"Somerville, MA",4 star rating,"Overall :Pretty good Mexican restaurant in an active area.  If it's what you're in the mood for, this place will scratch the itch.Food :I had the Enchilada Poblana and it was good.  The mole sauce was a little more chocolaty and spicy than I'm used to, but the whole dish with rice and salad worked together really well.  I can't remember what my partner had, but she was also pretty satisfied.  Maybe not the world's greatest, but definitely on mark and with it's own style.Drinks :She had a melon margarita and I tried a pineapple one.  Both were delicious, and it seemed more like pureed fruit was used rather than just fruit juice.  I wouldn't go out of my way for one, but it was a nice companion to the meal.Service / Decor / AtmosphereEverything else was good enough that I don't remember it being bad, but not so amazing that it blew me away.  You probably won't feel put off by anything here, so if you're looking for a nice easy Mexican restaurant this place has you covered."

/user_details?userid=tAbsoPztS95_QRASN1APQg,Ja'miey K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I like Manana restaurant for a number of reasons. The decor is bright and cozy. The staff is always friendly. The portions are reasonably-sized, fairly priced and well-prepared. In the summer they have beer specials and a cute little patio looking out towards St. Louis Square. If you're feeling like Mexican and in the neighbourhood, this is a good bet."
/user_details?userid=LgUJRLI8sKyLsz66HS2p_A,Sara K.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"What a disappointment! I researched the best place to have a Marguerita and decided to try this restaurant. I wish I hadn't. I am a regular marguerita drinker and I can tell you this one was terrible. It had a horrible artificial sweetner aftertaste and no alcohol buzz whatsoever. I've never had a sweet lime marguerita before,  I always choose it because it should be sour. The nachos were microwaved. The guacamole came without any nachos to eat it with. All in all the worst use of $80 in a long time."
/user_details?userid=oTJWmhLj5mhUOK5oCE4wjw,Ernest L.,"Oakville, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been to Manana a few times and enjoyed every meal I've had here. This is one of the few places in the MTL where you can get authentic Mexican food.However, on my last visit to Manana, I  was let down a bit after ordering the table d'hote. Don't get me wrong - the salad and enchiladas were gorgeous. What disappointed me was that I was served a Costco cake for dessert. I did enjoy the cake, but Costco cake doesn't really scream authentic Mehican in my opinion. Would have given Manana 5 stars if not for the lack-luster dessert."

/user_details?userid=NxJkUZdUkn-rd4JxZqOXMw,Deborah C.,"Peru, NY",3 star rating,"Certainly not the best Mexican food I've ever had but this is Montreal after all. The service was exceptional. The restaurant itself is kind of grungy but happy and festive. The rice was strange...easily could have stood in at a Chinese takeout joint. The eggplant app was really good. Everything else, in my opinion, lacked flavor. Chocolate/flan cake for dessert was divine! Don't go with high expectations for great food and your experience will be just fine. The waitress couldn't have been nicer."
/user_details?userid=wttXAaLWDUlootaptXkLGA,Wei T.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,We had the chicken fajitas and enchiladas.  Both were tasty and prepared well.  Surprisingly it wasn't crowded on a Saturday night.

/user_details?userid=sFJjEc7ytSUV28Y7PpdMjQ,Mathieu B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The restaurant is traditional Mexican cuisine. The place is quite small. Kind of kitsch with a background of annoying reaggaton. Right there, we knew it would be an experience. We had the Chicken Quasadilla and it was really good. We took the recommendation from a ex-employee who told us that this dish was a really nice pick and pretty cheap (10.95$).It came with 2 quasadillas (kind tortilla)  a salad and some mexican rice that was quite boring. It felt like «the batch of rice of the day» meaning that mostly everybody with no talent could do better. Quite disapointed on that. But the portion were quite good and even though, from the get go I'm not a fan of mexican foods, I had a nice meal. I'm pretty confident to say I won't go back there, but it is mostly because i'm not a fan of Mexican food...but beside this restaurant and 3 amigos i haven't been somewhere else. Alright so basically it's not a really good restaurant, the service was alright, music was annoying and the chef was signing loudly which is not really professional. When I eat something, other than a Pub, I do not want to hear the Chef or some lousy reaggaton.Weird  but useful fact: men's restroom toilet is quite shaky so that doesn't feel right."
/user_details?userid=KYV3TpJiJB2LGN9umfmsHg,Shirley D.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I had a horrible experience at 3 Amigos and recently recovered...so I thought I'd give another Mexican restaurant a chance! Manana has a great atmosphere and vibe, music was fun, decor was warm and friendly! Waitress was attentive and also very kind. While I waited for my bf she kept refilling my water (i drink tonsss of water) and smiling at me. How NICE! So I started off with an eggplant appetizer, it was sauteed with cheese, peppers, beets, salad, coriander. AMAZING! The main dish I ordered I ended up sharing with my bf because the portion was quite big. It was fajitas pollo, chicken fajitas and boy was the chicken good. It's apparently hard to cook good chicken, but this place seems to do it right. It came with guacamole and beans, rice. Very filling. Extra tortilla was only 25 cents. Another plus was the restaurant knew where their fish/seafood came from. That was great, lots of restos I find don't know where they get their produce/supplies. ( We were trying to be environmentally conscious) my only complaint is that its a bit expensive. My daquiri was 7 bucks, for a virgin, it would make more sense if the daquiri had alcohol..and the other dishes were a bit pricey too. But i wouldn't mind going again. Owns 3 Amigos, for sure."
