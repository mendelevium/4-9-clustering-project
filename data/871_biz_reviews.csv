/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Love, love, love this cafe in the Village.With cubby hole bunker ""forts"" lined with pillows, playful seating, including pic-nic tables, booths and tables near book-lined shelves, cool tunes playing on the sound system, a come-as-you-are vibe (this is in the middle of the gay village after all) and really good grilled cheese sandwiches and teas, you can easily spend a couple of hours here working away on your laptop and polishing off a blog post or reading a book with an outrageous title and no one will raise an eyebrow.Other posters have mentioned like it felt like coming into kindergarten on the first day of school and I agree, there's a sense of chill joy and camaraderie here that very few cafes achieve."

The bathroom had no light and it was dark as hell, I thought freddy kruger was about to jump out at me.They also charge 50cents for a to-go cup. 3 out of 5."
/user_details?userid=5DBDr5jlsSrpiQbg6wXedQ,Alexis W.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"This was a very nicely decorated cafe that my friends and I stumbled upon on Canada Day when looking for somewhere to eat. We were immediately attracted to the bright colours on the outdoor lawn chair that drew us to entering the doors. Upon entering, the cozy seating space and never seen before theme that this cafe offers drew us to stay. I got a Vegan Sandwich was had tofu, onion and peppers in it which I thought was quite tasty and above my expectations for something vegan. My friends all got the sandwich of the day which happened to be Pulled Pork, which they relatively enjoyed. However, we later also got the spinach dip and was greatly disappointed. We were expecting a warm dish with bubbling cheese, but were instead faced with a cold healthy, perhaps Greek yogurt version of spinach dip with carrots and some tortilla chips.Overall this place is quite healthy and definitely a good place to hang out, and do homework. If I lived in Montreal, I feel like I could see myself coming here quite often.Food: 3.5/5Decor: 4/5Service: 3.5/5"
/user_details?userid=GlEhxPlaofxOOvcf-5guvw,Cindy D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I went several times to La Graine Brûlée, and each time I was accompanied by one of my little ones, children in a cafe you say? Well yes, La Graine Brulée is not only the ideal place for students wishing to study, it is also a place with relaxation areas perfect for children. There is a library with two large work tables, a place to play vintage video games including Super Nintendo and Nintendo 64 (sweet memories lol) and perfect hide and seek cabins covered with writings. On weekends they offer a brunch formula for families and have a lot of veggie food options for those who might be interested. I highly recommend the place, I have always had great service on every visit!"
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This cafe is well above the average in terms of  creative and fun spaces/places to meet, chat, hang out, read or work - oh and did I mention that they serve a mean latte. Other beverages looked good and worth trying on another visit. See cost factor noted at end.Quite an open concept, with a high ceiling in the space, but they also have several alcoves - think it's even under some stairs? - one for kids (it appears by the games and toys), a library area and various sodden cubes that you can turn into semi-private chill out, and gossip or even unique date spaces - awe how cute.They would surely get a 5, but it appears many of their beverages listed on the menu board are close to that, so let's say a 4.75 in line with the price of a mean latte."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,"1-This cafe is fun, spacious, and affordable.2-A good place to study alone or with friends. 3-They have great and many food options so you can go lots of times and never get bored. What else do I need to say to convince you? It's perfect.I've tried their spinach dip, vegetarian chili, and hummus. I highly recommend their spinach dip, it is the best thing, honestly. It fills you up, tastes great, and is vegetarian. Grab a book/laptop/your homework and settle down here.Tip: Get there early because seats fill up fast. Especially the booths. Tip 2: They have a cute lego-ish ferris wheel that spins located in the middle of the cafe. Prime Instagram material."
/user_details?userid=0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA,Joi B.,"Hudson Valley, NY",5 star rating,"I heart this place with all of my heart! A childlike sentiment for a place that makes me feel the excitement of the first day of kindergarten again (wasn't that one of the best days of your life?) I recently spent the better part of a Friday at La Graine Brûlée and while this was for the purpose of working, I couldn't help but let my mind wander a bit and yearn to get down in one of the more relaxed cubbies with a glass of (soy) milk and cookies. I never even think about milk & cookies but this urge had such an effect on me that just a few nights later, I found myself indulging in this very childhood treat when I was home. La Graine Brûlée left quite an impression.With glasses of piping hot espresso, smooth as silk, and visions of vegan baked goods dancing in my head (they have them! I sadly didn't try any), Mariko and I got down to business at one of the long tables in the creative room to the left of the register. Books line the walls and I can easily see myself getting back to work on that damn novel. There I ago again. Do you get the idea yet that you are prone to flights of fancy here?One thing I wasn't a fan of, but I understand why they do it, is the strobe effect in the bathroom. It's a little upsetting to me as I have sensitivity to strobes, but not enough that I asked them to turn it off (they will do so if you ask, as per the sign on the door. And if you're epileptic, be sure and do so). Dark lights also make me question the cleanliness in a bathroom.I've never had such a festive time while working. Thank you, fine people behind La Graine Brûlée. I can't wait to return in my free time so I can dream a little dream again."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"One of the best things to happen in a neighbourhood that deserves all the good things. La Graine Brûlée is a DIY labour of fun and delight and love by the same team that brought you Café Oui Mais Non up by Jarry Park. Like some magic phone booths I know, it's bigger on the inside, and once you're in, the unexpected mix of playful and studious vibes makes it so you may never want to leave. It's spacious with lots of cozy nooks for reading or meeting with groups. The bites are delicious and there are excellent healthy options. I love that I can have a glass of wine here with my coffee and my book, or while I chatter away on my laptop, this feels truly civilized.Love love love this café, a perfect hang. My only request would be to have a nice quality filter coffee for those of us who don't dig espresso. Meanwhile, more wine for me I guess! C'est la vie. =)"
/user_details?userid=B0Xxo-DtDejGVHQccS1iiA,Raina A.,"Mississauga, Canada",4 star rating,By far the most interactive cafe I've been to! From umbrellas hanging from the ceiling to walls covered with floppy discs (yes you read that right) this cafe won't leave you bored..or hungry!I got the sandwich du jour which my elementary knowledge of French told me it was the sandwich of the day. I could choose from tuna or pulled pork so I went with tuna. I believe it was about $7.50. I also ordered a fresh smoothie $4. Here is why this review rakes in only 4/5 stars: the food is very average. It's not bad but it's not memorable. It's a little overpriced in my opinion BUT the amazing and quirky interior makes up for it! It's a great place to go alone if you want to read a book from their mini library while sipping on a latte or to chit chat with friends under the pool floats hanging from the ceiling or even as a date night and play Mario party on their Nintendo 64.
/user_details?userid=lEqPCfb2wX7SXzm2m2DPrA,Ana L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Not your cookie cutter coffee shop, as the name was playfully picked. The funky decor and different hangout places allows groups or individuals to find their niche, in either an intimate two to three persons cube, or conversation tables, and a big beautiful table in the center of the room for working, studying, etc. The coffee is made to order perfect. I always order a cup when I pick up my lufa farms order, which they graciously host."
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Not sure what to think of this place. Unique decor and setup. I thought it was really cool that they included a corner that you can play Nintendo. I ordered an americano and got a super diluted espresso. The staff do not smile much and made me feel like I was bothering them. What I dislike the most is their choice of having the light twitch in the bathroom. Maybe it for discouraging the homeless or drug addicts to stay in there. But when you can't even see what you're doing, it can get dangerous. They did put up a sign that if you are prone for seizure or something, to let them know and they'll just turn the lights on like a normal bathroom. Unassuming, unfriendly place... but they do sell pastries from Arhoma!"
/user_details?userid=3SfiqyTQO8gP8z6XA1ekpQ,Garseng W.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Very cute coffee shop / café in the heart of the Gay Village. The decor of the shop is very bright, eclectic, and cute. There are a variety of spaces to hang out, including standard cafe-like tables, larger library-like tables, a large round table in the middle with a large Ferris wheel in the middle, little cubbies and nooks and crannies for 2-3 people to curl up. There is also a little alcove in which they have 2 TVs with a SNES, an N64, and a video tape player with a wide selection of old movies. Throughout the café there are a variety of books and board games you can use as well. You also have to check out the bathroom and its trippy strobe lights! We've stopped by twice during our trip to spend some time relaxing in between touristy activities. We had the ice coffee, the mocha, and the chips and guacamole. The drinks were pretty standard, the chips and guac were maybe a little overpriced for the portions and quality, but this place is worth a visit for the cute environment where you can easily spend a whole day working, studying, or just relaxing, along with the laid-back, friendly staff, the free, fast Wi-Fi, and the good Lo-Fi music to top it off. --Rating Rubric--5* - As good as it gets; goes above and beyond. I would come here again and again!4* - Worth checking out; a good value. No major complaints or only minor flaws that set this place back. I'm glad I tried it, but I might not come back here in lieu of trying somewhere new.3* - A few setbacks that soured the experience. Not the worst, but I wouldn't recommend it to friends.2* - Multiple setbacks that made me dislike the place.1* - I was personally offended by the people or services. Steer clear!"
/user_details?userid=buKLOXS0nVg8jhW3II3fiw,Alison L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Such a cute cafe! We were just wandering through Montreal and stumbled across this little gem and was immediately intrigued. Walking into this cafe is like walking into another world. Very cute, childhood esque decor. Think little cubby holes to curl up in with a friend or old school Nintendo super Mario brothers. The menu isn't crazy and has your usual fare for a decent price. There are lots of outlet to charge.The most confusing part of this cafe was the bathroom. There was a single bulb in the bathroom that flashed onto the ceiling. There's a sign on the bathroom that says that if you're epileptic, you should go see the front desk. Epileptic or not, I'm not sure who thought it was a good idea to have a flashing light bulb. It's too dark in there, and the single flashing light does get to you. But I wouldn't let the bathroom deter you from checking out this cafe!"
/user_details?userid=ao7Jt5QoBWO15lGdZH16Kw,Christina T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Totally out of this world! I came in expecting to see tables and chairs, probably a few decorations here and there. Unexpectedly, I saw toys and kid decorations. Was I being transported back to kindergarten where all the fun imaginable moments happen?  While working on my University project, I got myself a matcha latte with milk and it tastes divine! Despite all the loud music and the chatters, I manage to do some work near the window. For some reasons, I felt happy being surrounded by this little magical land called La Graine Brûlée. Is it the intimate boxes where you can hide from all your worries from the world that make me hook? Was it that roundtable filled with miniature toys on top that makes me nostalgic? Or was it the drinks? All I can say is... I will be back to this coffee shop for a whole day to have this wonderful feeling again."

I ordered a latté and sat in the gaming alcove to look at a guy play Mario World.Happy with the quality of my drink I ordered a Barbie with coconut milk and a marshmallow. It was ok. Not great but different.It's a must try because of the overall quality of both coffee and decor.
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Had two small coffees with my friend. Really like the deco and the set up.This place can be packed, surprisingly.They have very old Nintendo TV game and old tape film in one corner and a space for board games. I found a checker. We had a game, such a fun.The coffee is good ?! I don't have a taste for coffees so don't take it from me. The bathroom is creepy. Some may say it is a fun to go but not for me. I got dizzy with the intense flashes. I really have a mixed feeling for this place. See yourself in the bathroom and let me know."

/user_details?userid=nZUsDCm1v1tSJVWJHFEflg,Shin Ling L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is honestly one of my favourite places to go to in Montreal (and I've visited quite the few places since I've moved here last year)! La Graine Brûlée checks all the ticks - it has great food and drinks, has a great vibe/atmosphere, AND it's affordable. What the heck, perfection exists y'all. I LOVE the layout of the store, it has a child-like element to it and it really makes it feel cozy and at-home. You get to chill with friends in boxes (which my 6-feet something friend could fit into, thankfully, he always bumps into stuff so I was worried), you get to read all the weird stuff people have left on the walls, and the ambience has been good every time I've visited.I haven't had a lot of their foods but I've tried their vegan chili and their cookie, they were both really good! They are so vegan-friendly (aaaaand I realised I forgot to check if they're gluten-free diet friendly, so I'll do that the next time), they could also make my matcha latte with soy milk! And if you know me, any place that is vegan-friendly is a plus (I'm vegetarian but vegan food is gr8).The drinks are average-priced, I'd say, but the food there was cheap! I got a vegan chili for $4.5 (incl. tax), which filled me up. I'm so happy to say that I've found a gem in Montreal, and hopefully I'm going to keep finding more"
/user_details?userid=2POGD49cFMx2aKvj86y6BA,David W.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"This place is incredible - and by that I mean, amazing and genius in a way that makes you wonder why there aren't more places with a similar concept? The motif for this coffee shop is that it's like a child's play center, but for adults. It has a quirky, whimsical, and cozy feeling that makes it a great spot for lounging or getting work done. Minus one star because my hot chocolate was sub-par, even with the fun and cute colored marshmallows."
/user_details?userid=auCygWhk_cSxv5bNoLdseQ,Luc R.,"Memphis, TN",3 star rating,Tip to management- your chips are toooo salty! Chile is spicy and salty naturally so paired with super salty tortilla chips is questionable!!!! Otherwise I loved it!

As for the coffee? We only tried the espresso but it was wonderful.I think I found my new work spot"

There are lots of tables, and there's a cute little nook for playing video games and being comfy! There are a few food choices, they're decent choices, nothing overly special. The coffee and tea lattes are great!One criticism is the bathroom. It literally says on the door don't enter if you have epileptic. It is dark aside from a strand of christmas lights and there's a strobe light. I don't have epilepsy, but I honestly thought I may have a seizure being in there, so after the first time I used it, I dreaded having to use it. I really think they should just make the washroom normal. I have a headache and a little nausea after using it. And from my observations, people don't seem to look well when they leave the washroom."

What a unique and fun way to have a coffee or sit and catch up with friends. I visited this cafe for a yelp book swap event and I had a great time doing a little tour before sitting down with my coffee. The decor is on point. I kept finding cute little things as I glanced around. There are cute and unique little seating areas and a study room in the back. They also had hilarious cards on display. The chai latte I had was next level. Shoutout to the super kind staff. I would highly recommend visiting this place for coffee or to study.
/user_details?userid=OyWhTonjjiaIzjSeNPeGcA,Koji S.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Absolutely delightful decor and ambiance, with an emphasis on quirky rather than warm and cozy; the colour scheme clashes deliberately. Cappuccino is the perfect balance of bitter and sweet, while the banana-bread galette that I got was also perfect. Prices are reasonable. Has a nice terrasse. Enough seats and outlets, while WiFi is reliable. Music choice is a bit too eclectic for my taste, and the weird flashing lights in the bathroom I genuinely don't understand or appreciate - but overall I love coming here!"

This is a local fast food style.... the food for me its really desapointing ... but you have the decoration to enterteint your eyes while eating no tasty food. The price is too high for what it is... sorry i dont like make bad reviews but i just recomande to not expect to much about their food but if you want to see something different go to their washroom .... Its wierd.. but i guess can be funny .. see by yourself and be careful in the toilet..

There are different sections inside the café that allow people to sit, lie down, lean, relax, nap, concentrate, play, read, whatever you wish! I tried their allongé and it was pretty good! The staff is also very friendly and willing to give recommendations. How the café is set up is to make everyone feel comfortable, but if you are adventurous you can explore the café inside out and discover little treasures here and there. It is just so fun here that I want to come back again and again!"

You can get it either hot or cold, comes with marshmallows and it's delicious. They also have quirky merch like greeting cards or mugs."
