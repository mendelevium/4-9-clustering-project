This particular bit of Jean Talon was in need of another lunch place - Marché Soupson and McDonalds were about all I could manage before!The decor is minimalist, focusing on concrete & plants for an industrial but fresh look. It's a little cold as a result, but it seems so clean and bright that it perks up your soul anyway.The menu is a little confusing for anyone who's not super familiar with korean food - it can be hard to know what you'd like since they're all made with similar ingredients of meat + rice/noodle + mushroom + vegetables. Maybe photos would be helpful!The crockery is beautiful though. It's all either traditional plates and spoons or hand-made pottery, which adds to the trendy feel of the place. As for the food - I usually get the bibimbap, which comes in a hot stone bowl. It's not the best bibimbap I've ever had but it's still exceptionally good, I just really like bibimbap!It also comes with sides that change every day. Today it was melon & broccoli (separately!) which are both quite nice - and, I think, make the bibimbap worth $14 in total. All in all, a clean, quiet and refreshing place to have lunch!"

We were in the area and made it there for dinner. The decor is very nice, simple and very Japanese in approach. Warning: No air conditioning - so it was hot!  The simple menu has a few good options to try. We tried the bibimbap and the donburi bowls and enjoyed them. We even met the chef so it was a nice overall experience. The place was not full so we picked where we wanted to eat and the price was reasonable. The biggest issue was the heat because there was no air conditioning - but I'm sure that next summer that won't be the case. Enjoy!"

There is thoughtfulness and quality in each dish, from the imported Korean mushrooms and the housemade sauces, to the chilled soapstone cups for sake. There is a nice whiskey collection as well as balanced sakes. There are no plastic products used either, which every restaurant should be doing these days. We will certainly be back!"

This is a mix of asian cuisines. We went there for brunch and got the Jian Bing and the Bibimbap. We also had the Vietnamese coffee which was super delicious. Thank you Shammy, your restaurant is the best!!!"
