/user_details?userid=2LptcvhkcFyNXT_NZDPpaQ,Luca M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I was introduced to Harbin by some super-cool coworkers, which makes this joint cool by association before I walk into the door.Their menu is simple enough: several (but not too many) kinds of dumplings done in one of three or four ways. I usually fork out the little extra for the pan-fried version. Plus a smattering of other tasty dishes that I usually skip because: ......drum roll...Dumpling portions are HUGE and tasty! I am humongously proud of having Harbin as a close neighbour and their good-natured, attentive service is always a plus. While the environment may look sterile sometimes (if the place is not busy), in times of Covid I think that's quite an unexpected bonus.More bonus points: innovation and general whimsy. From the smiling waiter robot being taught Québécois french, through wall pictures of Harbin's old Orthodox church, to the washroom decked out as a European theatre, there's plenty of unique pieces to keep conversations going. Democratic prices, portions considered, round out the awesomeness. Harbin deserve a thumbs up, plenty of orders and lots of good karma"

I'm from out of town and I've been to a couple places where dumplings are superior, but honestly, this place takes the top spot for me at how good it is and for its price point. We went on a weekday for lunch and it wasn't crowded at all. All the tables to choose from actually. My cousin and I ordered two set of dumplings, one steamed and one pan fried. The steamed dumpling was filled with curried beef. The pan fried dumpling was pork and kimchi. Both were amazing and I would order them again. The curried beef wasn't overly seasoned/spiced and the wrapper had a slight yellow hue from the curry. The pan fried dumpling had this nice cornstarch skirt to it which add another layer of crunch. This was definitely my favorite and it was my cousin's favorite as well. If I'm ever back in Montreal, I would be back here for sure!"
/user_details?userid=e2vqfe2JpXSQGIa_aminNw,Tony D.,"Saint Leonard, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,The innovation was the serving robot which was an ok experience. We ordered their staple dish which involved pork boiled and meat fried dumplings. Along with hot and sour soup and fried mushrooms for the appetizers. Overall the taste was bland and the amount of meat in the dumplings was a little light. Restaurant experiences not only involves the food taste but the service. And at this visit the service was subpar to what is expected. Upon placing the order the waitress failed to capture the complete order. When this was mentioned to her after she had served most of the order she reacted with surprise and stated that we did not order the missing item. So we ended up eating the fried mushrooms appetizers at the end. Picture attached!!!Will this restaurant be ready for the influx of tourism when summer 2020 rolls around? That will be good to see when the time comes. 是的，我同意我男朋友說的，餃子味道實在一般，機器人很可愛。A return visit is questionable!!!!

Harbin Dumplings has a small sign on its window that really catches your eye. After researching, I discovered this is their second location. Being a dumpling spot, we decided on having dumplings. There are other options for those that don't want dumplings- the ramen looked good. It was nice to see that they offered non-pork options as well. Each order comes with 12 dumplings starting at around 12$. We ordered the shrimp as well as the lamb and chives. We got the dumplings pretty quickly, they were piping hot. Flavorwise - I like the lamb a lot. The shrimp ones were a little underseasoned. For dipping sauce, you get soya sauce and chili oil (not spicy at all). We had a bottle of grapefruit soju-which complimented nicely with  our meal. I don't see the hype about this place, but in terms of a wide assortment - they definitely win."
