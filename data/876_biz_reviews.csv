/user_details?userid=8gZwPyesnY2mDiN5E_pmzQ,Brandon S.,"Pointe-Claire, Canada",4 star rating,The pizza served is very nice. Prime AAA location. They serve a circular mini pizza in lieu of a slice for the adventurous. An innovation if you will at the same price of a slice. Although the choices are about on Prince Arthur x St Laurent you will be happy that you stopped in at Med.

Looked around on skipthedishes and this place seemed to be the one with the highest ratings that was open. We had a pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, and hot peppers, onion rings, and garlic bread. The best part of the meal was easily the onion rings. The pizza was undercooked but we were hungry so it did get eaten. The garlic bread was legitimately inedible. I'll be trying somewhere else next time I'm craving late night pizza in Montreal."

/user_details?userid=kSz3wSUHilFrXuop8QnLZA,Elizabeth G.,"Downtown, Orlando, FL",4 star rating,Pizza was pretty good when it was fresh and very cheap. It's def not good once it cools down and no longer piping hot. It starts to taste like grocery frozen pizza at that point.
/user_details?userid=mZdNkRNZcc2SStIbfyWLjw,Liena C.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Out of all the pizza places on St-Laurent, this is one of the worst. Maybe it was good once, but it would seem the quality has gone down since that time. Dry pizza (seems like they've never heard of the concept of sauce?),  rude staff, and frozen foods (in the case of my meal, not even thawed properly)...in other words, maybe acceptable if you're too drunk to go any further. If not, go literally anywhere else.Edited to add: ended up with food poisoning the next day. Do not go there."
/user_details?userid=Ik43_5LKzdd5zmbsYRWyAw,christine j.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The best quick, inexpensive, quality restaurant on Blvd St Laurent.  I'm thrilled every time with their fries, always perfect.  Their poutine is just as it should be, excellent gravy.  Their spaghetti is excellent.  Both my husband and I love it as it tastes like the spaghetti we had growing up.  The pizza is excellent.  Their cheese is really good, and toppings always fresh.  I especially like the Hawaiian pizza, and the deluxe.  This is a family run business and is open super late.  Lots of specials.  I've been going since they opened and the food is consistently excellent every time.  The pita slovaki is also very good.  Don't just order pizza from the case, sit down and have a meal, this will become your St Laurent destination.  They want to make repeat customers, which in my mind is a solid move. Don't miss it!  Just south of Pine on East side of street."
