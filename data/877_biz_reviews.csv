It was a fried buffalo chicken burger with ranch sauce &  cucumber with apple salad.. deeeelish! First time coming to this place and I would definitely go back ,however parking is such a hassle! It took us literally 20 minutes to find legal parking! But it was totaly worth it! The cocktails was really yummy and they have such a great alcohol menu! .. and the decor of this place is insanely beautiful! .. the staff was so so so friendly and very informative about their menu and you can totaly tell that they really do love some certain dishes and that says alot about the place! I'm excited to go back & try out some new things from their menu! .."

The fish tacos are delicious and the California red wine really fine! Excellent ambiance as well and good service. They just need hotter hot sauces but then again I'm Pakistani so it's hard to satisfy my lust for heat!

Though the decor was cute and the overall space inviting, the service was pretty bad. They literally ran out of food and we had to change our order twice. They also had limited non-dairy milk options making ordering coffee a bit difficult. The food itself was just ok. Had it been exceptional I could have ignored the issues associated with lack of inventory."

He also forgot to fill our glasses with water. Other than this, the food was good & fresh."
