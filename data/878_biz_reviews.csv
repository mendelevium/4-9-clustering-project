/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",5 star rating,"Got the Indie coffee passport and Allo Vélo was one of the participating coffee shops.It is essentially a bike shop that serves coffee. Surprisingly, the coffee is amazing. Compared to a lot of new coffee shops brewing new wave coffee beans that tend to me more fruity and acidic, this one brews old school italian coffee. This gives a much richer and round coffee with chocolate and nut flavor which I love.No art foam on their coffee but who cares, just simple good coffee at its best.Super cool bike shop for cycling fanatics!Beware, they are closed on Monday!"

It's so beautiful with the amount of bikes all over the shop in all shapes and sizes. There were all kinds of models that were displayed in a creative place. The shop also repairs bikes and sells bike accessories. There's a small wall that divides the shop in two; between the repair counter and store. The second part of the shop has the bikes, accessories and a coffee area. They have couches and tables for you to enjoy your coffee while your bike is under repair. It's a great concept. The staff is very polite and friendly. While my friend and I were enjoying our drinks the staff started a conversation and provided us with some facts and history about the bikes. I ordered a latte in a cup. It was a good latte but nothing extravagant. There wasn't many options for food items to add. A very fun experience at a cute shop!"

All I know, the cafe has a bike hanging on the wall. The place took me by surprise; it is a boutique of bikes and its accessories. Plus they repair the bikes too. When you enter deep into the boutique, on the left hand side, there is the coffeeshop. It's an interesting concept. While your bike is being repaired, have a cup of coffee! While you shop around for a bike, have a cup of coffee. The clerk/server was really sweet; she gave us tour of the shop and our lattes. It was bit bitter for my taste, but I was enjoying too much the place itself. We got to meet the owner, who showed his special bicycle that he used it to across Canada! Very impressive! Fans of coffee or bicyclists, do visit this place!"

You can't rent a bike for less than 5 hours. I only used it for 2 hours and paid full price ($25). The manager was so kind to let me use the remaining 3 hours the next day. To be frank, I couldn't imagine that he would accept. Isn't it amazing ! That's called great service.The location is ideal, few minutes from the Canal or the Old port! They also offer bike maintenance and reparation at a very affordable prices. While waiting for your bike to get serviced, you can enjoy their coffee on comfy couches.For amateurs, they rent or sell a nice variety of European bikes."
/user_details?userid=Z7xuJ9P_rMtBvi4aFmP7zw,Fouad B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The bike shop is also a coffeeshop, it is located in a small alley in griffintown, next to Canal Lachine.They also have an excellent service, and they are friendly. They picked our bikes from home, an hour late for our appointment, and took them to the shop for checkup. At first they said that the bikes will be ready in 2 days; we asked them if we could have them earlier to use them during the weekend. They called us 2 hours later and said that they were ready!! That was really fast!! They changed the breaks, the bicycle side stand, ..., and they adjusted the saddle and the handle bars. After that, we went for a ride on the most scenic bike track that is Canal Lachine course."
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I'm so happy to have a place like Allo Vélo in the neighbourhood. I went in with a pretty old bike wheel that needed a new tire and tube- as outdated as my bike is these guys still had what I needed in stock. Furthermore, Nick even stopped what he was doing to change the tire for me.I've been subject to a lot of B.S. with male bike mechanics in the past who treat women like we've got cotton balls for brains. No sexism with these folks- I was spoken to like an equal and hey, the coffee I had was pretty good too. I highly recommend these folks and plan on going back.Oh and the space is adorable FYI"

/user_details?userid=YcF7AgUQEIAwgnBm1V4nUQ,Manuel B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"If you're shopping around for a bike, looking to get yours fixed or looking for a pit stop while enjoying a great cup of coffee, you've found the greatest place in Montreal! I've been in after a recommendation of a good friend of mine who swore to me that the service was worth the detour. I walked in, and within 20 minutes a was convince that this was my new favourite spot! First of all, the service is amazing. Own by the nicest family in the book, they give you tip and tricks about your bike and inform you with no judgement about anything you wanna know that's bike related. I was in to change my cog and whine up learning a whole lot in the process. I came back to change my chain and because of a five minute wait, they offered me a complimentary cup of cappuccino. Small gesture, I wasn't in a hurry, but it's thing like that, that make you wanna come back time and time again. This bike shop is far from being in my neighbourhood (12 km away) but I'll only go to bike shop. The best in Montreal!"

/user_details?userid=eIQLLIikPj4tPDPWhcOltg,Joanna M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Just a short ride from the canal, Allo Vélo is a great bike shop/café in St-Henri with beautiful bikes and stylish accessories. I love their carefully curated selection of Dutch-style bikes.  I often find myself drooling over the bike porn on their gorgeous website. Take a look!Their bikes may be a bit more pricy than some other stores. As someone who cycles every day, quality and reliability are important. The staff are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. I recently took my bike in for a few adjustments and a tune-up before a trip out to Oka. I was very pleasantly surprised by how reasonable their pricing is - less than the estimate (wow!) - and by the quality of the work.I recommend them highly, and I will certainly visit again. As they say, everyone looks good on a bike! ;)"
/user_details?userid=IlZEfnNmPBEQZVsvtmfk4Q,Double D.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"The atmosphere is friendly and inviting and the staff are extremely nice and will work with you to make sure you're 100% satisfied.  That kind of service is VERY hard to find, especially in a city like Montreal. Pricing is reasonable on repairs, and they appear to be honest, however, I was quoted/promised a different price than the price I was charged when I went to pick up my bike.  They did offer to charge me the quoted price ($100) but I felt guilty not paying my full bill so I forked over the $140 anyway.  I was very happy with the 2 day turnaround time, especially mid-summer, as the other bike shop in the neighborhood had quoted me 2 WEEKS! HOWEVER, the repairs done on my bike have not held up very well over time. When I first got the bike back, the front tire was not tightened/screwed on properly. I had to go back to the shop to get that repair finalized as they must have forgotten to tighten it the first time.  In addition, it's only been a few months since I got a full overhaul done on my bike, and both tires have since had issues with alignment, and now one of my brakes and one of my cables are coming loose as well. I know there's a certain amount to be accounted for wear and tear, but overall the quality of the repairs was NOT what I'm used to and really just felt like the job was haphazardly done. In their defense, I called them about the issues and they were more than willing to fix the work for free, but their business hours weren't convenient for me so I ended up paying to have the repairs done elsewhere, and I'm glad I did as they repairs at the other shop I went to were done for a lot cheaper and the quality of work was by far superior."
/user_details?userid=_pMxeEkyK1KOvZjoTD4yzQ,My Review With A Capital R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Helpful. Repairs are done right. Friendly. Good espresso. Interesting accessories. One monday evening I got a flat, called a taxi van to pick me up. I called allo vélo to check on closing time. The guy working waited for me after hours and he fixed fixed my flat. He saved my biking week. He really didn't have to wait for me. I'm very grateful. If I were to guess, I'd say he's part of the family business. You don't see that kind of service from an employee if the boss is not around."
