I have always been a fan of Korean food, however this place takes it up a notch. I'll call their type of food ""Korean Fusion"".I've made myself a regular here about 1 year ago, hard to believe I have not reviewed it yet. First off, service is quick. You're in and out within 5 minutes. The food is fresh as it is cooked right before you (this of course depends on what you order). I always get the Deopbap Pork. The dish means covered rice and is a bowl of rice topped with a pork topping dipped in a sweet sauce. The dish is always accompanied by a nice warm miso soup. That's another thing that stands out here; their miso soup is out of this world.The staff is extremely friendly. They also offer you a loyalty card; you end up getting your eleventh dish for free. Prices are also quite competitive. A dish, soup, a side of kimchi and a drink is under 14$.And you get full...for the rest of the day, what more could you ask for? I highly recommend you try this place. They have two branches, one in the Cours Mont-Royal and the original at the Eaton Center."

My fave is the beef bibimbap and you have to get the ""spicy sauce"" which is really just gochujang: sweet and slightly spicy authentic Korean sauce that flavours the whole bibimbap wonderfully."

You ca also get all the free barley tea that you want when you're there! Remember to grab their loyalty card, free lunch after 10 punch-ins. They also have a spot near Place Ville-Marie"
