No sinewy parts here, just the most delightful, flavourful texture to hit your palette.I like too many to list, but one favorite is the Toulouse style. I like preparing these accompanied by fresh, buttered asparagus with scalloped potatoes a la Julia Child and a nice crisp, chilled bottle of Aveleda Vinho Verde wine for an elegant but simple comfort dish.A visit to the Jean-Talon market is incomplete without a stop here."

If you are visiting the market this is a delicious option for lunch, it's just a tiny counter with a ton of homemade sausages but they are always grilling some of their best and you can get them loaded up with kraut and hot peppers and mustards and a lovely toasted bun to walk around with, or park yourself on a stoop or picnic bench in the sun to people watch and enjoy the many live musicians who busk here. If you are preparing a BBQ make this a stop for sure - these are exceptional big fat tasty sausages of all kinds and flavours. I like the jalapeno and cheese and the beer sausage and you know, pretty much all of them."

You pay inside the little shop and they give you a ticket to take out to the guy or gal cooking and serving up the sausages. The bread is really a great piece of baguette and the sausages selection has several to choose from: swiss, knockwurst, semi-hot, jalapeno, and hot. There are a number of mustards and sauces, then the toppings include hot banana peppers, green olives, pickles, and sauerkraut. It costs $6 and is more than worth it. Inside the shop you'll find a number of their wonderful sausages for sale, some cold-cuts, patés and other items. We had the Maple and Bacon sausage tonight, and found it delicious, cooking it the way the helpful associate suggested. The maple flavor wasn't strong but you really got a hit of bacon, I was able to see the bacon as I was eating so they don't skimp!"

/user_details?userid=MH69cmqdMhVHirWVXmsszQ,Larry L.,"Jericho, VT",5 star rating,This shop was recommended to us by a local in the market. So glad we stopped in. We had a sausage sandwich on their crusty baguette that was out of this world. Can't wait to come back!
