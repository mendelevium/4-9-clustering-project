/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",5 star rating,"Was looking for a place to eat a nice wood oven pizza that was tasty and light at the same time.My first reflex was to turn to Napoletana in little Italy...i have not been yet. But I decided to check Yelp for advise.I landed on Heirloom which look modern and the pizzas looked amazing on the pictures. Decided to give it a try and was hoping not to be disappointed...which I wasn't! Had reservation for a Thursday night at 830pm and the place was packed with people. A mix of young and older crowd. The decor was trendy with options to be seated at the bar, banquette or regular table. We opted for the banquette.The selection of pizza was pretty good but. It extensive (some places have over 30 different pizza options) and we chose a Margarita and a mushroom pizza. To my surprise, it didn't take long for the pizza to arrive. Although the mushroom pizza was very good, the margarita set it off the park! The tomato sauce was so tasty with just the right tang to it...I would order it again! The crust was thin with leoparded marks on it....perfection...add their homemade hot oil and you will be in heaven!We also ordered a cocktail each...they were ok but wasn't amazed. Should have probably just ordered wine or a beer.Although the service was excellent, it took our waiter a while to come and take our order after we ordered our drinks...not a big deal. The place is quite noisy so not ideal if you really want to have a quiet conversation or bring very young kids (babies).Definitely recommend this place as pizzas were excellent and pricing was what you would except from a place like that ($16-20ish per pizza)."

/user_details?userid=Y_h-nrOIIZWBF-AFzdQbgQ,Matthew P.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,Looks like I never wrote my review for this place till now kept putting it off now the time to let people know the truth and I got to say he pizza here is really good every time I came and so far every pizza I took was amazing even the Vegetarian one which I can tell you I'm a meat eater they are  probably in my top 3 best pizzas I ever ate. When ever I come the service is really good to price are not crazy I find them fair 14$ to 20 plus tax depending on what you take . I highly doubt you will regret trying to eat here and if you know of any better pizza places in Montreal PM me so I can try it . Enjoy !

The menu offers an array of appetizers, pastas and pizzas all for a fair price. There is a limited choice of wines by the glass vs by the bottle. Signature cocktails and beers are also available starting at 10$.I shared a cheese platter with my friend - which was terrible-3 cold pieces of ""breadstick"" like naan pieces ? Served with your average cheese, although the honey was a nice touch the almond pieces in it didn't seem to fly. This dish was definitely not worth 12$. The pizza game was a lot stronger than the appetizers. The pan pizza was large and great for sharing. I loved my veggie pizza that was topped with zucchini, red peppers , eggplant, arugula. Their dessert menu was elaborate - I had a orange sponge cake layered with chocolate mousse.A nice venue before setting foot to the botanical gardens."

/user_details?userid=HvdgGKbv1OHmKBPKQm-xNg,Natalye R.,"Berlin, Germany",4 star rating,"The pizza here is legit good. We showed up without a reservation on a weeknight during the dinner rush and they seated us right away in the back. We ordered three pizzas, and found them all super delicious. The dough was just the right consistency -- thin, but not so thin it tore or was soggy, and the perfect amount of chewiness. The flavors on their own worked really well together (we chose veggie pizzas with artichoke, red onion, black olives, etc.) but the chili oil was the perfect addition to the pizza.The beer selection wasn't super vast so I wasn't too impressed, and the wheat beer I settled on was fine but nothing amazing. For dessert we split the dulce de leche churro shake and it was a nice treat. We ended up paying around $75 including tax and tip and I feel that is a price that was worth it. It's been a couple days and my husband is still talking about this place, so...."
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Hochelaga Maisonneuve has gentrified a lot in the past few years meaning that many restaurants have opened up in the area.  One of these is Heirloom, a pizza place.  The ambiance would best be described as casual and modern.  It gets packed on a Saturday night so be sure to reserve if you want to get a table.Pizza is obviously the focus here but if you are not craving that you can also order pasta.  There is also a small menu of appetizers to kick off the meal.  I ordered the arancini and they were just okay.  Personally I prefer mine to be filled with more than just rice and cheese because it gives them more flavour.  These fell flat in the flavour department.Following the arancini I ordered an Italian sausage pizza which had peppers, rapini and sausage on it.  My hopes were high because I noticed that they used a wood-burning oven and I love pizza cooked this way because it gives the crust a smoky flavour.  That being said this was not the case in this situation.  I liked the combination of flavours but the crust was a bit disappointing.To cap it all off I decided to order a panna cotta for dessert.  This was probably the highlight of the meal because it was all around satisfying.  The panna cotta was garnished with a berry topping and oatmeal cookies.  It made for a good combination of flavours and I enjoyed it quite a bit.Prices were reasonable for a restaurant like this.  The arancini, pizza, panna cotta and a glass of wine came to about $55 after tax and tip.  In my experience this is what you typically pay at pizza restaurants of this type.It's nice to see so many restaurants in Hochelaga Maisonneuve now.  The area has undergone quite the transformation over the years.  While I'm not sure I would make a detour to come to Heirloom I would come back if I found myself in the area."

/user_details?userid=16XDM4M2G8NvLVLLOhM1nA,Sandrine L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I live in little Italy and I didn't see the point to go that far for a pizza. It was also a bad start when we reserved for 2 on a Saturday. The person who answered the phone was a bit rude, especially when we asked if it was BYOB. The information was not clear on the web and we wanted to get the right information. So we were a bit scared to go their, spend our money and have a bad experience. I guess it was just one person having a bad day because it was a really nice evening.We sat at the bar, the restaurant was packed. We could have a nice view on the bar and the kitchen with their amazing oven. Food was delicious and met our expectations. We shared 3 entrees, including moist polpettas and arancinis, both served with a really good tomato sauce. We also shared a bottle of wine, a good and crispy thin crust margarita pizza and espressos. Everything for 100$, taxes and tip in, it was just awesome! Staff was really nice and friendly even with my friends who speaks English only. I would recommend this one for sure !"

/user_details?userid=XEqApY2jtSPdGptPsJHumg,Lucy F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Pizza is good. Pasta is good. Appetizers are good. Service is good. Basically, when you want a safe choice, this restaurant will deliver a solid meal just as long as you are not expecting to be blown away... and that is not a bad thing. Sometimes you just want a simple but good meal. Great addition to the Montreal east end restaurant scene."
/user_details?userid=V-d2ocOGoAJBS_y0_kZuxQ,Jessica C.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,The arancinis and the pizza were so amazing. Plus it's a really unpretentious place and the prizes are reasonable. I'd go back for sure!

Would recommend to all visitors."
