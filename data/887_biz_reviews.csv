We tried the Shanghai noodles which were bland, and lacked vegetables mixed in. Their bubble tea was delicious and is a must. You could have for dessert! Their take out bags are cloth which is a nice ecological touch."

We have been seeing this restaurant on Ubereats for the past 2 weeks and have finally decided to try it out. The restaurant was very clean and the staff were friendly! We tried the peanut sauce noodles, the chicken& lamb skewers, porc & shrimp xiao long bao and sweet porc xiao long bao.The dumplings were very juicy and the texture of the dumplings were soft. They were extremely generous with their fillings! As for the price range, it is very affordable. We were 2 and couldn't finish all our food. We ended up bringing our leftovers home and enjoy it later in the evening.I will definitely recommend everyone to try this restaurant if you are a dumpling lover!"
