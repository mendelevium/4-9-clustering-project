The carne quesadilla was light and a bit bland. The high point of our visit was the churros. They were AWSOME. I recommend stopping by for beer, great service and churros."
/user_details?userid=VUS9-ABMF37mbHG5aMaaZw,Gabriella F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Ribs are probably my second favourite food (after sushi) so I'm always down to try a new bbq place. This one was disappointing though. The Dixie platter at 70$ with tax is not worth it at all. Ribs - over cooked, dry, not fall off the bone, bland with a bit of sauce. Pulled pork - 50% mustard, abit dry, we had whole chunks that weren't even shredded. Fried chicken - by far the best, amazing fried tasty skin and juicy chicken. Brisket - without the fat it was dry, barely any bbq/smoky taste. The fries were very good we had a mountain of those, the mashed potatoes were pretty bad, dry crumbly. But the gravy that came with was delicious. We were only allowed 1 side + the fries. Cant comment on service since we ordered to go."

It was a bitterly cold day and so we decided to order food delivery.We ordered the half rack of Baby Back Pork Ribs and the Tinga Tacos (3). My oh my, were we disappointed. The pork ribs were extremely dry. It was very unacceptable. The sauce was sweet and smoky, but that did little to save the tough and stringy meat. The tacos were just soggy and flavourless. I wish they added some sort of savoury sweet sauce to this sad dish, but all I got were bits of dry meat. Biscuits here were good though."

We ordered the babyback ribs half rack with baked beans and Cajun fries. The ribs were really good and the baked beans were made in the same BBQ sauce and was so good. We also enjoyed the fries. The Uber eats driver just bought half a rack so we called diablos and told them about the offer and David was really kind and nice, he drove and delivered the free half rack before they closed! This was really amazing of him and Diablos!!!"

Stuffs were nice, and the environment was good as well. We ordered one smoked chicken fajitas. It taste really good compared to the many other places I had chicken fajitas before both in the USA and Canada. The portion was enough, but there was less meat than I expected. There were only a few slices of smoked chicken. Also, it was filled with lots and lots of onion, and less green and red pepper. It came with only four tortillas which I found not enough at all. It was not much spicy, so I had to add hot sauce in it. But overall, the food was really tasty, and I would love to go there again."
/user_details?userid=UFa4OjrdeVo5gYaoL24vxA,Julia L.,"Great Neck, NY",2 star rating,"I was not impressed with their food or service at all,We ordered nachos, and specifically asked for extra cheese. When the food was brought to us there was barely to any cheese to be seen, maybe a little bit stuck to the paper on the bottom. But the waiter said the kitchen insisted they put on. And then they tried to charge us for the extra cheese saying that we could have eaten it off because he didn't see it after my friend started eating her side which had beef on it. My tacos came out cold. I paid 30 bucks for the meal and could have had a better experience at Taco Bell. Overall just not impressed at all!!"

For some reason I felt like I was in a log cabin. I guess that refers to it as being small. Staff seated us immediately and ran down the menu because I was a newbie.lol. We ordered chicken wings for appetizers and that was quite bland, Main meal was Beef Brisket with Cajun fries, baked beans and cornbread. Overall it was ok except my ratings will be low. Brisket was a bit dry and could of used more marinade.  There was nothing about the fries being Cajun, normal fries. I found it expensive and portions are small. I've yet to find a smoking smoke house.... bahahaha!"

I tend to always go for a pulled pork or brisket option and this time around i settled for a half chicken and brisket combo with a side of cajun fries and cornbread. It should also be noted that i decided to order in for this order which might have affected the food quality and heat, but when the food arrived the cornbread and brisket were delicious i didnt work up the courage to try the chicken  my only negative note would be that there was not enough sauce and that left things a little bit dry. i would definitely reorder from here since there menu looks amazing and there's so much more i want to try"
/user_details?userid=rLh63PoxknAV52w5IkmcQA,Crystina S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars for this one.The BBQ is great. We got the Dixie for 2 people, pulled pork, fried chicken, brisket and ribs, cornbread and mash with a side Mac and cheese and extra biscuits. The meat was excellent, zero complaints, it was just damn good bbq. The cornbread was really nice. I find the biscuits to be a bit too salty, the Mac and cheese alright, a bit bland. Mash has a lot of pepper. My friends got tacos. This seemed silly to me. Go to a taco place for tacos, have BBQ and the smokehouse. They weren't great tacos. The lower rating was partly because of that (but what do you expect?) but mostly because of the service. It started great. Apps came out quick, so did drinks. Our 4th dinner mate was a bit late, and once he arrived, service was very slow. The restaurant is small, and it wasn't full, but our 4th has to wait a long time for a drink, food came out somewhat quickly, we ordered dessert and asked for the bill immediately because we had a show to get to, the bills came, but it took forever for dessert. We were about to walk out the door without it when they stopped us and said they would prepare it to go, which took a few more minutes. All in all, I would go here again, but not if I was in a rush to be somewhere else after dinner."

Made me a couple of string drinks and I ordered the quesadilla... I'm from Los Angeles so Mexican food is the standard flavor there... much to my surprise this was a quesadilla with a twist ; the chef had put its own spin on it and made some very flavorful marinated chicken in that quesadilla.. I came back towards to the end of my stay here just to have it again! The bartender Tamal is nice and engaging. The owner is big energy and fun to talk to as well. Try it out!

/user_details?userid=jdcHYFUNxv0frfr8inp-1Q,Valérie B.,"Laval-des-rapides, Laval, Canada",4 star rating,"was a nice discovery. We ordered the Small Dixie that feeds 2 people, but in the end it probably feeds more. The ribs had a succulent sauce as well as the brisket, which was super tender. The fried chicken was our favorite, it was not greasy, but the skin was very crispy and the spices were wonderful. And all that meat comes on top of a mountain of french fries and 2 other side choices! It was a cozy ambiance where they played oldies but goodies!"
/user_details?userid=HMNA_R_Bu1G3Ho2BBoB3Lg,Maria F.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I would give this a zero if i could. We show up as a group of 5 people to a half empty restaurant, ask if they have place for us, which they obviously do. The absolutely lost waiter talks to us, says he'll see what he can do, starts roaming around and then disappears out of sight. Reappears several minutes later just to give us this ""you are still here"" look and then says they don't have room for 5 people. No, they can not put two of these tables together. Me and my friends left dumbfounded. Surely enough we found another place to eat and surely enough none of us is ever setting a foot in this place. Make sure you are no more than 4 when you attempt to visit this joint. Or better go elsewhere where they want your money"
/user_details?userid=6aWDAw37z6zgfw-f6HXFnA,Matt B.,"Brossard, Canada",2 star rating,Way way worse than when they were on Saint Denis. I had been 3 times before they moved. Now everything is much worse. The portions are tiny. The fried chicken is bland - Kfc is better.The staff is split between people working hard and people chatting or on their phones. The waitress and bus boy had the hole room.42$ for a drink and 1/2 rack of ribs. Micro potion of coleslaw and mashed potatoes.
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We were looking for a place to grab dinner and decided to give this place a go - admittedly because the decor looked pretty cool.We sat on the terrace, and ordered a shrimp po'boy and a brisket on pretzel bun. The food took quite some time to come out. The menu did mention (as a cautionary?) that Diablos BBQ was not a fast food joint, and therefore time should be given for proper food preparation. Still, we felt that the main reason was understaffing, as the only waiter running around was obviously overloaded.The meal itself was delicious, but portions were way too small. The food lacked the oomph factor typically associated with southern BBQ, which is well known for gigantic racks of meat and other generous cuts. I guess it was a good thing because we were supposed to eat healthy that week, but what is a cheat day without overeating?Good food (wonderful cornbread!), but a bit disappointing for the aforementioned reasons."
/user_details?userid=wQ635cP5VEaEGimkcSedwQ,Peyton B.,"Hartford, CT",4 star rating,"This is the first restaurant that me and my friends ate at when we arrived in Montreal. As Americans used to subpar Tex-Mex chain restaurants, Diablos exceeded our expectations. Their menu is extensive and has something for everyone. Although the prices seem expensive, the portion sizes are very large. I had the fried chicken, which comes with Cajun fries and cornbread...did not disappoint! I wish I got to try more of their cocktails because the drink menu seemed to offer a lot of quirky cocktails."
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",3 star rating,"Southern BBQ places have risen in popularity in and around Montreal in the last few years however many restaurants are very similar in that the style is to smoke or cook the meat then slather a bunch of sauce on it. If you have a chance to travel the Southern US you will see there are so many styles of BBQ. Kansas City style is where most Canadian BBQ derives many of it's flavours from. KC style is used with grilled meats usually ribs then basted with a sauce that is more tomato base. You head down to Texas and Texas Pit is King and Brisket rules house. Memphis is known for a ribs and the options are wet or dry rub (which I prefer) with sauce options on the side some infusing bourbon. in the Carolina's pulled pork is King and more of a tangy mustard-vinegar base sauce rules. These are the styles I really know and have experienced in my pre-yelp years. So.....my experience is biased as I've had the fortunate opportunity to eat some excellent belly busting BBQ. Diablos is okay but not the best I've eaten. Mediocre at best. I ordered the half rack of ribs with mash potato and house salad with corn relish. Reason it was mediocre. Meat was not fall off the bone. If you have to work at it to chew it it's not exceptional BBQ. Secondly the sauce tasted like it came out of a plastic bottle. No BBQ house should serve what tastes like I can get at my local grocery store. Thirdly an excellent BBQ  house should have exceptional sides. These sides were okay but nothing memorable or earth shattering. To wash it down I ordered a Mojito which was one of the worst ones I've had in a while. It came in a mason jar but did not taste very good but I still drank it. Service was also a bit slow. From the time we ordered it seemed like 30-40 minutes till we received our food out on the terrace. Ribs when done right should be served within five minutes from ordering. The true professionals smoke a huge amount all day and all you need is to warm it up. If you want to read about true BBQ check out Bucky's BBQ in Greenville, SC. Or else google Dreamland BBQ in Tuscaloosa, AL. The food here is okay and edible just it takes more to impress me with high quality BBQ. Pricing is a bit higher but that's par for the course in Montreal.  I'd declare Triple Crown Dinette the best so far I've tried in MTL. Rubs is okay similar to diablos but more smoked flavour. My next place to check out is Blackstrap."
/user_details?userid=mY3NA8f6H0-i38SOjxyhFg,Dan P.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I should have followed my gut feeling as I walked through the door, but hindsight is 20/20 and I ended up eating here anyways. The waitress was lovely, but service was slow from getting a table (I had to approach the kitchen to find staff, and the manager was outside on his phone most of the night) to getting water and placing our order. Not the waitresses fault; she was alone and without help. After that however, the food came in good time. There was quite the situation at the table next to me though, where the manager and the client began to argue over a wrong order. Seriously off-putting and the compensation and attitude weren't making up for the sour taste that client was left with that spilled over to our table at witnessing the event. Further, they had to re-negotiate when the bill came! I ordered Combo #1, smoked chicken and pork ribs with cornbread and salad. The food was pretty OK - Good comfort food, done well, and tasty. For a taste of the south, I'd come again. It was truly the experience that left me thinking next time, I'll try someplace else. I also ordered the Jack fire after seeing the add on the screen. Nice flavour and a bit sweet. However like others I felt the quantity was on the low side and price was high. I wouldn't come back for drinks."
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Located on the VERY busy St-Laurent street, Diablos is quickly gaining a reputation of being the place to go to get some quality BBQ grub... and that might be true!Pros - I went with a full rack of pork ribs and they were GREAT! Also... HUUUGE! Succulent, fall off the bone goodness that filled me far more than I expected it to. The BBQ sauce was excellent. Did I mention it was HUGE? You gotta try this!- We ordered a large portion of the battered pickles and they were very good! And as a Yelper, you get 50% off when you check-in... so hey... THANK YOU YELP!- Service was efficient and friendly. Our waitress was very accommodating and on point.Cons - The appetizer pulled pork sliders were very underwhelming. I don't know if it was the pull pork or it was the buns but all in all, it left all of us wanting and comparing it to the delicious fried pickles, the difference was night and day.- I ordered an alcoholic drink (root beer float) and while it was very good, it was also small. For its price, ($8.50) I didn't think I got great value off this. I would have ordered 2-3 drinks if they were more moderately priced. - Nothing they can personally do about this last point but the parking nearby on St-Laurent... SUCKS HARD!"

It was the worst food experience I have had for a long time . We ordered the BBQ plate for 4 "" $85.00 ""  the chicken was not smoked just fried & raw in the middle, "" lucky I had my suspicions & tested it "" The beans were served in what can only be described as a condiment holder, lucky for us they were dry & burnt as if they had been saved off another customers plate & given to us after throwing into the oven for a few minutes. The ribs n this platter were about 3"" long & wait was meant to be a full rack was less than half , ""remember this was for 4 adults !!!""  I complained & was told "" why don't you just leave "" How nice of them !!!! So we did leave, I believe it was a good thing we did, I didn't want food poisoning for my F1 weekend . This place needs closing down before they make someone seriously ill .

/user_details?userid=ix5MvlspEMyAZ4Czf_VMXQ,Michael S.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Customer service was incredibly uncomfortable and the food quality was also lacking. Since these are two fairly disparate issues I'll talk about them one at a time.I ordered the Diablos Burger because I wasn't sure about their food quality and a burger is usually a safe bet, but it was incredibly dry and near inedible; I ended up using all the mayonnaise and ketchup I had for my fries for the burger. I could've eaten my boot and had a juicier meal. They also give you three times as many fries as any other side, so if you don't order them you feel kind of ripped off. Someone at my table got mashed potatoes and baked bean, both of which fit in the same size container as their fry condiments, while they pile the tray with fries if you take them.I also ordered their Mexican Bulldog (Margarita with beer) with ""twice as much tequila"" and the beer included, but no one at my table could taste any of the tequila, so either the base recipe contains a paltry amount or the bartender just watered my drink down.As for the service, the waiter gave everyone at the table cornbread instead of the biscuits we all asked for. This isn't really that big of a deal but when we told him he brought us the biscuits and made us (with our hands that we'd been eating with) pick up the cornbread that HE MISTAKENLY BROUGHT US and put it onto his plate so he could bring it back to the kitchen.So if you'd like to eat here, you have to understand that customers may have handled parts of your meal, and you must come prepared with your own bottle of sauce since they apparently don't have any. This place is empty most nights for a reason."
/user_details?userid=0KZNZKVCTpURutG_qbMKzg,Alejandro A.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Amazing ribs, friendly staff, and great drinks!The fries were well seasoned the meat on the ribs fall right off the bone.The only thing that my friend and i disliked was that the sauce was too sweet and believe me: I love a sweet bbq sauce but this one was too sweet. I also noticed the ribs were not that marinated. I tried a piece without any sauce and all i could taste was the smoke but there was no actual flavor to the ribs. Maybe a little salt and pepper before smoking them would help?"

Consistency similar to an overcooked pork chop, anyone who knows a good brisket knows the bark shouldn't be on all sides and the meat should not be grey and tough like an over cooked pork chop. This was clearly refried and stored not fresh smoke house at all.They charged $80 for a variety plate of all the supposedly smoked meats (i dont think they really smoke anything there) they say it serves 3-4 people but we were all still starving after the plate was finished. Ended up having to go to McDonalds to eat. I feel like i was robbed. They gave half a biscuit for 4 people. Sensing we were not happy they offered us a free pitcher of beer which we refused because we were way too hungry to get more drunk. Never Goring back again!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY TRUST ME!"

/user_details?userid=rtAoDZJ5RA8uakY5f6J5BA,Joseluis A.,"Revere, MA",2 star rating,"Ok guys, I want to make it clear for everyone that this place has a lot of potential as the bbq is pretty good, but unfortunately its the service that is lacking. I dont know, maybe it was because they were trying to get us out of the restaurant to close early since it was a saturday night so maybe they had plans to go out after work and we were the last one's at the restaurant. But let me give you just a little background info...when we arrived it was around 8:30 and there was only two people in the whole restaurant. I should've read that as a red flag before deciding to sit somewhere, but what I did was check the business hours on their website to make sure I wasnt going to be THAT customer to come in 30 minutes before closing. So i checked the website and I said okay we're good they don't close until midnight. So we ordered the first round of drinks and shortly after our food order. We got our drinks and everyone was happy with the taste and amount of alcohol, so I give salute to the bartender. I had finished mine and was ready for another one so I put my glass at the edge of the table. I looked at the server to try to make eye contact but this dude was scrolling on his phone most of the time, so he was not really looking our way. So later on he came to us with a pitcher of water and a few glasses and set them on the table, took that empty glass I had placed on the edge and left without asking for another drink. That automatically told me that either the bartender already left so thats why hes bringing us the water so late in the game or he doesn't know how to read customers and doesn't have that experience for customer service. It could have also been that he didn't care and wanted to get us out ASAP as I had originally said in this review. Utlimately, we had our food which again was good but the service killed it for me. If you plan on visiting Montreal, dont come here after 8:30pm because chances are you will get the same attention and i'm sure locals already know the deal with this place, given how empty it was on a saturday night."

While taste-wise I prefer 'le smoking bbq', I enjoyed Diablo's at the previous location because of the space/terrace/view, etc. Enjoying a ginormous sangria pitcher outside in the summer seemed worth the somewhat inflated prices. Unfortunately the new location is much smaller (perhaps half?) and the terrace seats around 20 people max. It's lost all its summer charm! Taste-wise (ribs and related things -- I haven't tried the Tex-Mex food) it's still ok... But now there are no reasons for me to prefer it over 'le smoking bbq'..."

The food was very good. Small portions, but good food.This place was slow in general, but for Tex Mex, it was the slowest I have ever seen by far. On top of that, it was a really weird experience. The service was very slow and confusing. They were very passive to the fact that we were customers at a table. At one point, the waiter just walked away from our table with no explanation, mid-conversation about what we wanted to order for dinner, sat people, welcomed them, and just came back like nothing happened. It wasn't terrible. It was just weird. If you have any kind of schedule or care about service, speed, or awkwardness, skip it. If you want to spend your night here and don't care about those things.

/user_details?userid=Gkxe9U9E2WR2937cjIZboA,Jason K.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Not very good, there was no BBQ sauce or mustard or any other BBQ stuff, hot sauce etc... On the table or bottles to buy and bring home. The portions are too small and everything was very oily?? Not in a fun greasy bbq way, more in the way someone was in the back going nuts putting oil all over the dishes so nothing sticks. The food seems very uninspired. I would recommend this place if you have never left Montreal or eaten BBQ anywhere else. I receive the impression that this place is catering more towards St. Laurent downtown crowd, gluten free blah blah and low carb what not, which is a very ""city approach"" to BBQ. Sandwiches were light on meat and heavy on buns and coleslaw. All the unique signature ""only here"" BBQ side dishes may as well come from a grocery store, coleslaw, potato salad, maquechoux, were all very bland, boring, very oily and not very flavorful. There was no hot sauce, BBQ sauce or spices anywhere and no ability to add any myself. It seems like a good place for drinks, maybe lunch. If you are looking for a saucy, meaty, BBQ pigout you should keep looking."

We had made reservations ahead of time via Bookenda (they were unable to find it), but they accommodated anyway. When I made the reservation, they made me aware that they did not have high chairs. Which wasn't terrible, just slightly annoying (I found out that most places in Montreal are like this)Clearly I was a tourist. We chose this place because it seemed the most family friendly, with great food. The food was truly delicious, we ordered The Dixie Normous and it fed 4 of us adults perfectly. The drinks on the other hand were ok. Nothing amazing. We ordered a Sangria pitcher, and 2 old fashioned's. Considering I live in the states, their bourbon list was pretty decent. You can't go wrong with bourbon. Except I asked them for an Old Fashioned, and it was incomplete.Overall, a great BBQ place."

Walked by, seen the sign ""all you can eat ribs""... Jackpot! Decor was mediocre, but it was a smokehouse, not the Ritz. Baby back ribs and Cajun fries were the choices to devour. Each new rib has more meat than the one before! How can they do that? oh my... Great ribs, nice and tender. only issue I had was the BBQ sauce... there was no variety. just their one sauce.  great at first, but by the time I was on my fourth, I was done. not full, but sauced out. if there was a mix up of flavours, I'd still be there."
/user_details?userid=MeJJ50cVS-ycShR5wBKtHg,Alex A.,"White Rock, Canada",3 star rating,"Came here on a Friday afternoon and the place was empty except for another table of guys. This of course allowed more time/attention from the manager(owner?); I've got to say, I don't know what previous reviewers were talking about-- the guy we met was awesome! He was very friendly, not small talk friendly but ACTUAL conversations friendly.I ordered the half rack of baby back ribs with fries and cornbread. My friend got the same except with coleslaw instead of the fries. Ribs: okay, I don't know if I just hadn't had ribs in a long time and I was just really homesick and craving... OR THOSE RIBS WERE THE BOMB! They were slathered with just the right amount of BBQ sauce (you can never have too much when it comes to ribs though) and the meat was that perfect consistently where it could fall of the bone without much effort but it hasn't. AGHHH so good! I must return!Fries: not going to lie, the ribs were so good that I don't remember if I liked the fries. But honestly speaking, fries are my favourite thing in the world and so if I don't remember these then they were probably between mediocre and alright.Cornbread: Damn. Who'd have thought you'd find good cornbread in Montreal? It was delicious! I could taste the buttery goodness in it but it wasn't at all greasy/oily. Couldn't get enough of it.Coleslaw: I'm not a coleslaw person but my friend said that it was good. It was purple though-- not sure if that's a Montreal thing?Overall: I didn't get anything to drink, just water. So all together, including tip, I paid about $30. This is normally the price range I would pay (on the higher end though) at the smokehouses back home so normally this would be okay. BUT the portions were small. Usually when I go out for ribs (or something to that variety), I'm overwhelmed by the amount of food that's put in front of me. I wasn't really wow-ed though. And I finished it. Easily. Never have I ever finished a whole meal at a smokehouse-- I usually end up having to take home a little container of leftovers.Yeah so absolutely delicious but WAY overpriced for the portions."

I decided to try it out because my friends and I wanted to eat out somewhere with a patio. They offered a set lunch menu for $15 ($17.25 with tax). The lunch menu included mac and cheese with chorizo, Diablo's burger, smoked chicken sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, 1/4 rack of ribs, etc with a choice of either fries or salad. The lunch menu includes a free beer (Sleeman) as well, but you can substitute the beer for juice, wine, etc. I got the 1/4 rack of ribs with fries. The service took a while because the waiter was working the tables and in the back as well. When my food arrived, the waiter informed me that I got the last of the ribs in the pot. So they gave me a bit of the pulled pork as well. The ribs were really good! I didn't even have to use my hands to eat them because the meat just came off the bone. The sauce was really good, but it was a bit too thick in my opinion. The pulled pork had flavour and was decent, but it was cold when we got our food. The fries were good. They were thinly sliced (a bit too thin in my opinion) and had a good amount of spice on them. I would definitely come here if I wanted ribs, but other than that it's a decent restaurant to go to. PS. They have free wifi."

But the manager seemed less than interested in helping her out. Personally, I dislike when I'm not receiving service (being seated, getting water, placing order) and there is staff on their phone. Food: was pretty good for southern comfort BBQ! I had the Combo#1, smoked chicken and pork ribs with side cornbread and salad. The ribs were delicious! Wish I had more. They were moist and tasty, not too saucy. The chicken was also moist, very good. The cornbread was light and fluffy. If return for the food, but not the atmosphere/ service. After the show I witnessed with the manager and a client, and my own service, I'd sooner try something new than come back.

We were seated immediately with menus, and our waiter was friendly, funny and came to take our drink orders quite quickly. I could taste the bourbon in my Lonesome Cowboy, and didn't find it too sweet, and priced accordingly to St-Laurent at 9$. If you find the drinks too expensive, maybe go out to eat in the suburbs? I had a Mex Barbacoa bowl and my friend had the brisket plate, which he had to wrap up to take home as it was a large amount of meat. I couldn't finish my bowl either, but it was delicious, if somewhat lukewarm due to the colder toppings like pico de gallo etc. For starters we ordered the fried pickles, which were fresh, hot and breaded in a delicious panko-like batter with a very nice dipping sauce. Better than the ones at L'Gros Luxe. The space was really bright, which was a bit disconcerting and I would have preferred actual napkins to brown paper rolls. I will be back though."

/user_details?userid=EPQNXtoYuM21sVNOXQDXFQ,Steve S.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I was very unhappy with my experience at Diablos. We went there for a group birthday dinner. Our group was about 40 people and the restaurant capacity is perhaps 60-80. We were given a fixed menu to order from of an appetizer, main and dessert. Our waitress took drink orders and brought our drinks rather quickly, which was good. It was pretty much downhill after that. The restaurant was extremely uncomfortable without any air conditioning and it was over 30 C last night. The employees were visibly sweating too. Our appetizers took over an hour to start coming out. Guests went outside to smoke multiple times hoping their food would be waiting for them, but alas no. The waitress continuously told us that the food would arrive in 5 minutes. Finally orders started being served. Many guests received their appetizers, but half of us on our table waited another 25 minutes while our friends finished their appetizers. Eventually my burned ends came and they were not very good at all, despite the waitresses recommendation. We then waited over an hour to start seeing main courses. Once again, there was a large gap of time between my plate being served and the rest of my table. The final plates to be served at my table got their mains an hour after I did. The servers offered to comp their pitcher of sangria, but I felt their meal should have been comped.I had the beef rib on the waitress' recommendation again, and it was probably the best thing they had, although I thought it was pretty average or below average. My potato salad was not good (I only took a few bites to try it). The corn bread was definitely not made fresh and was not very tasty. People at my table ordered the pork ribs and they were burned pretty badly. They were over-smoked too. The ribs were dry, lacked taste and had an overpowering taste of smoke. I am not an American BBQ expert, but I have eaten BBQ in many restaurants in the USA, and I know what it is supposed to taste like. And I also know that BBQ is prepared way in advance and so there should be almost no waiting time for the food to be served, so this restaurant was pretty ridiculous for serving times. Besides, we were a large group with a reservation, weren't they ready for the rush?The fixed menu included a dessert, but once the guests ate their main courses and the plates were cleared away, the servers didn't offer us dessert at all. Once we at our table asked if we could get dessert, the waitress asked us what we would like. There was a choice of brownie and banana cream pie. I asked for the pie and the waitress told me there was none left. This begged the question, ""Why did you even offer me a choice?"" After yet another long wait, the waitress arrived at our table with our dessert in take-away plates. So I asked the waitress if I was allowed to finish my meal in the restaurant, to which she replied that everyone had asked for their dessert to go. No one at our table said such a thing. At this point, the waitress looked pretty annoyed at me and told us she would ask the kitchen to make more brownies... Which meant that she didn't have enough brownies in to-go plates anyway! After waiting for 20 minutes, I finally just paid my bill and told the waitress to cancel my brownie. I can not confirm if that brownie is ready yet. I will not go back to this restaurant and I do not recommend it to anyone. Bad service, slow kitchen, below average food, no courtesy. And no AC! To boot, I ended up with serious indigestion all night."

We each got one of the combo plates- I got the beef ribs with smoked chicken and my boyfriend got the pork ribs with smoked chicken. My ribs were extremely fatty and had very little meat on them. The chicken was ok, but nothing special, especially after such a long wait. I got a side of mashed potatoes and cornbread. The mashed potatoes were good, but the cornbread was really dense, cold, and quite a disappointment.After a disappointing meal, I can say with certainty that I won't be returning."

This place is located on an easily accessible street. The decor is beautiful and authentic, with wooden tables and walls, a stylish bar, and Texas-style memorabilia. The menu was pretty cheap and featured authentic BBQ classics as well as some Canadian inspired meals, such as BBQ poutine. Service is bilingual and accommodating. We started off with their expensive entree portion Caesar salad which was one of the best I've ever had. The untraditional salad, served like lettuce strips and not shredded lettuce. The vinagrette was delicious and the bacon and cheese was really nice in the dish. The flavor combinations proved why this place is so successful. We also got their poutine, which was yummy, but wasn't elevated enough to fit the BBQ concept. Their steak tips were yummy, with a nice smoked flavor. Their brisket was very moist and had great contrast with the spicy Cajun fries. The pulled pork wasn't amazing, but it did have most of the authentic flavors I was looking for."

They could not.-1.5 hours in, my husband had to go to the dep to get our child a snack because her stomach hurt from hunger- many tables had come, eaten and left in the two hours we had waited for our appetizer.-2 hours in, we wanted to know if we were getting food, the manager checked the kitchen and said that it was coming right up...-2.5 hours in, our appetizer finally came. It didn't have half the things described on the menu and the chicken wings were undercooked and juices were running pink.- at that point we were finished with this place and decided to leave. The manager told us that the smoking process turns the chicken pink and that we should ""look it up"" we did and if anyone's curious the flesh can be pink, but not the juices or near close to the bone.- we wished the customers beside us that had been waiting as long as us without any food either,  ""good luck"" and left.Ugh...-"

There were a few people outside on the terrace, but you really couldn't provide enough menus? it took forever to even order.Then came the ordering. I ordered one appetizer and the mac and cheese. Because I ordered an appetizer, I declined having the 2 side dishes the mac and cheese came with. The mac and cheese on the menu said $16.95, so I was expecting a big serving. Much to my surprise, out comes the smallest and saddest little plate of mac and cheese I've ever seen. I asked the waitress, nicely, why it was so small and she said that was a ""half"" mac and cheese. I never ordered half of anything! I had to re-order the side dishes because of how little my portion was. They ended up billing me $8.95 for the mac and cheese instead, but what a bizarre experience.

In the meantime our ""server"" told us he'd be with us in one minute about 15 minutes in and then 15 minutes after that he came by and said he knows we're hungry and we've been waiting, and then walked away from us again! We debated getting up to leave and then when we saw the server go take the food order from a party that came in way after us we immediately all stood up and walked out. We then spent our $230 on food and drinks at Rubs a few doors down so hopefully the server reads this and realizes his pockets are about $45 lighter! But he didn't seem to care so whatever. Maybe we're spoiled because in NY we'd never be treated this way or kept waiting for so long without so much as a drink order or chips or something.
