The place is cozy and looked like it was quite popular. Service is a bit slow, but you just need to get the waiters' attention and it'll be ok. To begin your meal, they give you the classic sides dishes and this one gives you fish cake! My favourite banchan! Many restaurants here just give you kimchi and something else and that's it. Personally, I would recommend the set meals. It comes with japchae, pajeon, rice and your choice of whatever meat pairing.I'm a sucker for meals where you get a bit of everything, so this one was just perfect. The food was really delicious and the flavour levels were just right. Also, their korean fried chicken was excellent. Just spicy enough, sweet enough, and crispy enough. Mm!Their prices are competitive as well. You can probably get an alcoholic drink with your meal and it'll still be a reasonable bill."

We started with the Fried Chicken appetizer ($8). I actually thought it would be the Korean Fried Chicken with the sweet and sticky sauce, but it was just plain battered fried chicken with a creamy sauce on the side for dipping. I liked that the meat was lean chicken breast, and the batter wasn't excessive. It was ok, albeit a little bland. It was really thermodynamically hot though (not spicy hot at all), so be careful you don't burn your mouth, lol. They brought us 3 banchan dishes (complimentary). Kimchi, fish slices, and bean sprouts. These were ok (unremarkable).We both got the Dolsot Bibimbap ($13) - we rarely order the exact same dish, but we did this time. It came with rice, beef bulgogi, soft tofu, cabbage, carrots, bean sprouts, zucchini, lettuce (mesclun mix), and a fried egg. I was a bit disappointed that it didn't come with any mushrooms, gosari, or seaweed. The beef was lean and tender, but there was very little of it. The tofu was very soft and crumbly. The bowl was good, but it didn't have any oomph to it, IMO. It definitely needed the addition of hot sauce, which I added, and it gave it a bit more flavour. I will say that I liked that this restaurant does not use whole sesame seeds in any of their dishes, they only use sesame oil (the server told me this). I was thrilled by this because I have an intolerance to the actual seeds, so I could eat anything at this restaurant and not have to worry, which isn't always the case with Korean restaurants.Service was very polite and attentive. Our waters were refilled regularly, and our food arrived in a timely fashion. The place it not that big, and it was fairly full when we arrived, but cleared out as the night went on (we arrived a bit after 8pm).Street parking only."

The waiter was very attentive and polite, serving our orders in a timely manner without disrupting the table.The sides were rather small for a Korean restaurant; There could have been a bit more for 2 people. The combo meal offer a nice selection of multiple choices, with a seafood pancake, japchae and bulgogi beef. We also took a whole plate of japchae, which was nice and heavily perfumed with sesame flavour. The noodles were chewy enough, but not mushy. One comment was that there is a bit too much sauce, which made it oily and heavy."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Our expectations were high after seeing all the good reviews, but we were very disappointed with the food and couldn't finish it. The side dishes were delicious. The fried chicken was very dry on the inside and the batter was extremely thick and oily, which is very unusual for korean fried chicken. My soft tofu stew had a lot of beef and seafood inside, but tasted very average. The total came up to 30$ per person which is not cheap. Even for Montreal standard, the food wasn't that good. The food came quickly and the lady was very nice. The restaurant is very dark and gloomy inside even though it was daytime. The other items on the menu might have been better than what we took, but overall we didn't have a good experience."

/user_details?userid=3J8OoQEBaFQx6Ooyu3UkgA,Joyce A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The place is clean and cozy. I took the bulgogi combo which contains of steamed rice, glass noodle (which i really like), bulgogi beef and korean pancake (i like this one too). The food was very tasty. While waiting for your order they served you kimchi, bean sprouts, and another kind of spicy side dish. Food was good!!"
/user_details?userid=IiFqAnURXyM8HVW8xKsrxw,Jessica K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Lowkey Korean resto located a couple steps from Guy-Concordia metro. I ordered the spicy chicken with vegetables ($18) and it was SO GOOD. The mix of spices, chicken, vegetables and rice cakes were a tasty combination. My friend got the pan fried sliced pork ($18) and it was also delicious. Both came in large portions and additional rice. The side dishes didn't come with a lot and unfortunately you have to pay extra for any additional sides. Overall it's a very homey environment and the service is kind and prompt."

Let's see what we are having today. Today I'm trying out their chicken teriyaki combo so let's dive right into the review. The dish is nicely separated into four sections. Let's start off with the rice. I normally wouldn't imagine myself enjoying plain white rice, but in this case, the bottom of the rice was lightly pan fried while the top part was still  tender and delicious. The chicken was tender and had good flavor but I would've preferred a stronger teriyaki flavor. The pancake was very tasty  with a crispy outside and a fluffy inside. Finally, the japchae was the perfect amount of chewy.The food was very filling and everything was well-priced. Boy, was I stuffed.A huge plus was the Kpop jams in the background - it was as if they were playing my Kpop Spotify playlist. The staff were really helpful and came by frequently to check on our food and fill our water as well.In conclusion, I would highly recommend getting the combo. However, be aware that your friends may get jealous (my girlfriend definitely was). And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember, food is life!"
/user_details?userid=NkMOVXd9lb9V57tLaQ4vNQ,An T.,"Rawdon, Canada",4 star rating,"Probably my 5th time dining at this korean restaurant. I always try to order different dishes as they have many items on their menu and overall, I feel pretty satisfied. We ordered the seafood pajeon & boneless fried chicken pieces as our appetizers. I've had better seafood pajeon in MTL but it was still satisfying. The boneless fried chicken pieces were quite tender inside and batter was deliciously crispy. My bf had a dolsot bibimbap - overall taste was okay, rice was kinda mushy,  I wouldnt re-order it.  I had the korean blood sausage soup - loved the soondae and the soup had a nice meaty flavour. I would definitely go back to try their other dishes."

/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"So I'm still here as I write this review - that's how amazing this cute little restaurant is! Hubby and I have a habit of always trying new places whenever we want to go out for food, so tonight I was tasked with the job of finding said new place. I came across KimGalbi on Yelp and I'm so glad I did! We metro'd over and waited for about 20 min for a table (Friday PM ~6pm). While waiting, we got to appreciate the simple modern decor and the fact that there was only one (awesome) server managing all 7 tables. When we sat, we quickly ordered the bulgogi pancake, the bibimbap and the bulgogi main as well as the only bottle of white wine they carried. The pancake came out first along with some small complimentary dishes (kimchi, fish cakes and bean sprouts) and man was it all DELICIOUS!!! Our mains came quickly after and both were outstanding as well. Seriously nothing to complain about here. Food is fresh, delicious, and outrageously well portioned while the service is on point and the prices are totally reasonable. Definitely my new favorite Korean place in town. Can't wait to come back!!!"

/user_details?userid=QeHZjU8MrX6p0vYCqyXiJA,Christina L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"If I ever want to go to a restaurant by myself, I would probably go here. I noticed a lot of people come here to eat alone. It's a small and unassuming Korean restaurant that's cozy and quiet. It's fairly new compared to the surrounding Korean restaurants and I'm kind of hoping it'll can serve as my go to Korean place before it gets super busy. They recently changed up their menu and now offer more item choices and combo. The waiter who works there is also super nice and attentive. He should definitely get a promotion. Their seafood pancakes always hits the spot for me and their combos are a great choice if you want a bit of everything. I'm definitely not a spice girl so I appreciate how their soups are not too spicy but still flavourful. I kind of wish they would bring back their potato side dish and add kimbap to their menu though. Overall, a great choice if you want Korean food!"
/user_details?userid=xHzMNVFTb_ZErsjpTOnBQA,Angie C.,"Calgary, Canada",4 star rating,"My fiancé and I ordered the chicken teriyaki combo platter, which came with rice, glass noodles and a pancake. We both thought the food was very well-seasoned and well-portioned for the price. The atmosphere was also very nice - it's a cozy little restaurant with cute décor. The only reason we're not giving a 5 star rating is the speed of service and what we felt was a lack of attentiveness from the waitress to us... but it may have been because there were 3 other tables with big groups there. Anyway, we still really like the food so we'll be returning :)."
/user_details?userid=uX4fWGcaYIPTMQ_UMkWxIQ,Zihan T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,It's located a little bit in the back of the busiest part on St Mathieu so sometimes it seemed no customers in the restaurant. But the food there is very good. They have the big pots with soup which you can share with people. And they have other authentic Korean food.

/user_details?userid=TDALtdzPzLw8gCMCATYpxw,Tracy W.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,Hidden gem for a great Korean food fix. Location is very easily to find (right next to the metro) place is small and cozy and super clean. I love their seafood pancake because it's not too eggy and there's lots of yummy fillings and the stir fry rice cake is quite tasty.

/user_details?userid=bemY1DWj0rOLIPUBRnfkjg,John C.,"Wyckoff, NJ",5 star rating,Couldn't be happier to stumble upon this restaurant. The food was wonderful and hearing K-POP in the background was the cherry on top of the cake.
/user_details?userid=nMyxqam3Ylo9rwNNRRNcDA,Gigi R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is brand new so we decided to go check it out since my boyfriend and I are a big fan of korean food. The place was very clean and had cute decorations. Staff was so friendly, I believe they're a family business. The menu is quite big (forgot to take photos of menu :/) so many dishes for a very decent price(from 4$ appetizers to 15$ dishes) It's cool how this store gives you 5 different side dishes for free, including kimchi, some kind of omelette, fish cakes, sweet potato and i believe the last one was pickled radish(?). We got fried vegetarian dumplings and this sweet rice cake (love this one!) to start off. Food was delicious and so flavourful, the size of dish was pretty big as well and was worth paying for, I got some kind of bulgogi soup that had of course bulgogi (beef) with vegetables (carrots, mushrooms,etc) and i believe sweet potato noodles (like the ones they use for japchae), and it also came with a side of rice. At the end, staff offered us ice cream which was very nice of them! Love this place and will definitely be back for some more food!"
/user_details?userid=p-iIAeX6So38SntVavWXjw,Saewon P.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I would say that this place is pretty authentic with the free side dishes and all, like how it's done in korea. The stove built into the table for cooking the main dish and keeping it warm is pretty neat as well. The food was delicious overall, but the dakgalbi could have been a bit more flavorful. My friends and I had an enjoyable time here."
