This place does not even remotely disappoint. The prices are reasonable, allowing you to try pretty much everything without breaking the bank. I love that. My absolute fave were the 'shrimp' rolls oh my god. The flavour!!! Excited to go on a gelato spree the next time I'm on St. Laurent."
/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,"Always drive by this place but never tried until covid hit since it is hard to find a parking spot in the neighborhood.Ordered 2 banh mi and when I taste them, it didn't taste like chicken and beef like I ordered. I remembered seeing pictures of Buddhist gathering and realized this was a vegetarian place.Good vegetarian options!Although it didn't taste like meat, flavour was still pretty good and refreshing.Given the fact that most places raised their prices due to Covid-19, seems like their pricing is still pretty good. Around $4.50-$5 for a banh mi.They also serve soups and other dishes over the weekend."
/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"I had a Pina Colada bubble tea with tapioca ($4.50) at Sapa and it was great. The Pina Colada bubble tea is a milk based drink so there is no actual tea in it, despite the name. It was creamy and rich and had a very pronounced pineapple and coconut flavour to it that I loved. It had sufficient ice so it was really cold, which I also liked. The tapioca were soft and chewy and plentiful. I really enjoyed my drink. The price was also lower than at other bubble tea places. While I was waiting, the man asked me if I wanted to sample their gelato. I accepted his kind offer and tried the Pandan flavoured one. It was rich and creamy and delicious. I will definitely be getting the gelato on my next visit. He told me that they make the gelato on-site. I noticed that they had lots of other exotic flavours like taro, passion fruit and soursop (which is what I'll be getting, I already know, lol). They had Vietnamese coffee flavoured gelato too! Service was so nice and friendly. It's a family-run business, and y'all know I love supporting the little guys. They had Banh Mi and other Vietnamese snacks by the cash register as well. If this store had been there when I was living just a few blocks away I would have been a regular for sure. However, they opened long after I moved away from Montreal. I guess I'll just have to settle for visiting every time I'm back in Montreal :)"

They weren't open when we first walked by but we window shopped hard.Tropical ice cream meaning Asian flavours! How can you say no to that?Hours are kind of random. Closed Monday but everything else is 1:00pm to 8:00pm. I assume they'll change this once they sort out the kinks.Menu. There's Vietnamese iced coffees you can get with ice cream. Sounds like a magical combo.Lucky we did recon beforehand because the raspberry lychee wasn't in the display case when we came back and were trying samples. We asked one of the workers and turns out they were prepping a new batch. After careful deliberation, we settled on two but there's lots of interesting Asian flavours. Pandan, yuzu, corossol and ginger to name a few.- Raspberry lychee and passionfruit ($3.85 double scoop cup) - we shared a double scoop of raspberry lychee and passionfruit. Both were very light, refreshing and full of flavour. Good consistency although it started to melt as we headed towards the metro. My favourite of the two was the raspberry lychee.Next time I would try their soft serve but this was a great spot to grab a quick cone. Perfect for some dessert if you're on busy boulevard St. Laurent."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"Lovely place that serves lots of original ice cream flavours (nutella, Vietnamese coffee, ginger, pandan, etc). They also serve soft serve ice cream (chocolate, vanilla).  The staff is super nice and helpful. It's a family owned place and their daughter said they wanted to bring an asian taste to ice cream. I got the nutella ice cream and it tasted pretty close to the same thing. The flavour was rich and creamy an the consistency was great! I wasn't afraid the ice cream was going to slip off the cone.  It doesn't look like much but it is really a gem. Go try it out!PS: Cash only for now"
/user_details?userid=6jtPin36HXxyj5DA1z5i1Q,Elly S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"DELICIOUS VEGAN VIÊT FOOD. Just learnt that the owner just came back from Vietnam after a year of learning how to make authentic Viêt food! And they made everything vegan here! I LOVED THE BANH MI AND AM COMING BACK FOR COUNTLESS TIMES. It also had special ice cream flavours like yuzu, black sesame, ginger, coconut."
/user_details?userid=k5Lk2aA7Iz7BcHLk15itkA,Jos E.,"Bayview Glen, Richmond Hill, Canada",5 star rating,"The banhmi is delicious, spicy fresh and crunchy! But most of all the service is charming. One of the cooks/servers offered us some freshly made crepe-like biscuits while we enjoyed our sandwiches. Felt very much like I was being welcomed into a family home."
/user_details?userid=gw9AScBm8TZa0_Ekp6Acvw,Derek J.,"North York, Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Can't say anything about the other items, but do not buy bubble tea from this store. The tapioca is hard, and the tea tastes more like fruit flavoured water. By far the worst bubble tea I've ever had."
/user_details?userid=Wa8ltGy9gd7BuyXIDWUxjw,Laura B.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Delicious and affordable vegan food! Person who served us was very friendly and gave us taste tests of all the vegan ice cream just to be nice. Coming back this evening.
/user_details?userid=x1D-zZ3dxNArbY4viaDclQ,Elsa A.,"Miami Beach, FL",4 star rating,"Had the mushroom and tofu Banh Mi and loved it! Great mix of different mushrooms to add great flavour. Even though they are vegan banh mi, for $3.95 you don't even miss the meat."
/user_details?userid=5wgt_K5YtG8Vjmca4nJx0w,Aaron B.,"Silver Spring, MD",5 star rating,"Fantastic service and a wonderful pork banh mi sandwich!  In fact, this is my favorite banh mi in Montreal, and I've tried over a half-dozen places.  Better yet, it's the cheapest banh mi."
/user_details?userid=vr5BLPV0fWNgila4vp8XaA,Mario E.,"San Mateo, CA",4 star rating,"-1 star because they ran out of bubbles, and it was 3pm!!! :(.That aside, the tea was good, we ordered lychee tea, milk tea, and the Coffee with Nutella ice cream. The passion fruit jelly wasn't overly sweet like I've had at other places, and the coffee and ice cream combo was heavenly.Nice hidden gem!"
/user_details?userid=PkVxaR0TnMfDVWJqYWklEA,Shell S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I work across the street from this place and discovered it today. It's a cute little place with good service and bubble tea. :) I'll be going back soon to try their vegetarian bah mi sandwiches. The prices are really good too.
