/user_details?userid=1GkcJk9SkBdF0N37F_oCAg,Vinh C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Disclaimer: This review is based on delivery.This spot makes the best ribs I've had in Montreal. Their texture is perfect--tender but with just enough bite to provide that gnawing-on-a-bone experience. Moreover, the flavor profile doesn't hide behind any sauce (although you do get some on the side) or grill marks. The smoke really comes through. You can tell that a great deal of care goes into the cooking process.The sides are solid too. The mac and cheese is rich and creamy (mixing some pulled pork in is highly recommended), whereas the coleslaw delivers the freshness required to cut through all that delicious fat.I'd say the only disappointment was the buttermilk cucumber salad, which was a bit bland to my taste. Oh, and I wish the brisket was available for delivery. Those are minor complaints, though. All in all, the food is terrific."
/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wifey sent me out to Atwater market yesterday (love that place, I do most of the cooking in my house). It was just before lunch and I entered by the food service area so the thought of grabbing a quick bite sounded like a good idea. As I walked past all the small take away storefronts nothing caught my eye other than a sign for a smoked cheeseburger special of the day. Bummer, I just had a burger at Vallier the other day so I passed and kept walking. I made it about 10 feet and stopped in my tracks, something smelled really good and I had to investigate. Sure enough, it was Aylwin BBQ. I guess two burgers in one week isn't going to kill anyone...so I plopped down my $20 (tax and tip included) for the burger and onion rings combo with a fresh pink lemonade. Oh yeah, that's how to do it! Imagine a BBQ smoke ring on a juicy burger, I'm not sure how they do it without overcooking the burger but it was delicious! The rings were thin and crispy and the lemonade was perfect. What a great lunch, I'm a fan!"
/user_details?userid=vl8rjQpVAl-COvlmbDMQbA,Cary C.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"Deliciously complex bbq sandwich. It makes my United States roots jealous. This no frills menu was easy to navigate and frankly, a steal compares to Chicago.I tried their special brisket sandwich, recommended by the cashier. A heaping pile of tender, smokey, savory brisket is piled hight on a buttery brioche bun topped with black sesame seeds. Visually a beautiful sandwich. I dashed to the air conditioned building and started engulfging this bad boue.The sharp cheese complimented the meat well, which was blow torched to melty perfection by the chef. I love this because she keeps the meat moist and juicy while giving the cheese that browning it deserves. The sandwich leans toward the acidic side over sweet, with some spicy pickle slices. It's a Canadian BBQ rodeo on this palate, please sir can I have some more?"
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I thought this place was really good BBQ! For $16 (tax included), I got the platter which had a slice of brisket, 2 little pieces of chicken, a generous helping of coleslaw, a bread roll, and an assortment of pickles (I also got a slice of key lime pie for $4 and a pink lemonade for $3.50).Initially, my thought was: only 1 slice of brisket? Kind of disappointing. I was wrong. That slice was: (I) delicious and (II) very filling due to its really tasty fat marbling. I loved it.The chicken was amazing too! Very nice and pleasant smokiness.Everything else complemented the ""Q"" as well. I especially liked the assortment of pickles. In the end, I couldn't even finish the plate!The key lime pie was wonderful but, next time, I'll pass on the pink lemonade. It tasted fine but it clearly provided me with the lowest ""utility-to-cost"" ratio on my plate. Water may work better with this meal anyway.Will definitely come back!"

The meat super tender and juicy and could get enough of the salad.You won't be disapointed."
/user_details?userid=vnyCbur2BfmLKXFRkj2Rpw,Peter R.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"Okay, as an adopted Texan (living there for the last ten years), I can honestly say that this Texas BBQ is legit. So delicious, building on some of the classic smoked meat traditions of Montréal with some tastes of home. Brisket tacos were amazing. The Rueben (a daily special) was superb, and the salads and brisket Mac and cheese was a family favorite. We have been back three times, each time trying something new and this place never disappoints. Even their bread was surprisingly delicious. Would definitely recommend next time you're around Atwater/Notre-Dame Ouest."
/user_details?userid=B_1193M3RIVvJWuYRjmang,Jason A.,"Langhorne, PA",5 star rating,"Montréal loves smoked meat so it follows that they would be fond of BBQ, but who knew they would bring Québécois sophistication and make one of the best brisket sammies any side of the border. It gets even better 'cause they're located in the amazing Atwater Mkt."
/user_details?userid=sI-g1fmCRCMbW5_tSvOCbQ,Balu V.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,I travelled to many many countries and this is the best brisket burger/sandwich I ever had. Wow is the word. The key lime pie is outstanding too. Do not miss this place when you visit Montreal
/user_details?userid=N-5qDBcD6aLGa6zw1LsL6w,Greg S.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"Visiting Montreal from Austin, TX I found myself wandering through Atwater Market and watched BBQ brisket being sliced up and served at Aylwin's stand there.  Although it looked really good I'm naturally skeptical, like I would be of a lobster roll in Austin.  But it looked so legit that I ordered up a few slices of brisket to try, a side of cucumber slaw, and a rose lemonade and let me tell you that this was some of the best BBQ brisket I've tasted anywhere.   Very tender and moist, the brisket is well marbled and not overly seasoned so that the natural smoke and flavor of the brisket take center stage.  After eating I felt compelled to compliment the pitmaster, and suspected that she must have visited Texas before to perfect her craft.  When I told her I was from Austin she named every BBQ place there that she tried when she had visited, like Franklin's, Valentina's, Snow's in Lexington, Black's in Lockhart and others. She's obviously studied the art of smoking meat and knows what she's doing.  If you're hankering for some authentic Texas style BBQ head over to this place, you aren't going to be disappointed.  If she moved her stand to Austin you'd wait in a long line to be served.  For the record, the cucumber slaw was really tasty and fresh and the rose lemonade was nice and tart and really accompanied the smoked meat nicely. I'm looking forward to returning and trying some of the other items on their menu!"

/user_details?userid=a2c2wJ5Yo7vMVurhCeYEmw,Becca C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,AMAZING!! The barbecue is incredible. I tried the 3 meat platter with a side of beans. All of the meats were very tender and had nice flavour. The employees are very nice and dedicated to customer service. A must-try at the market
/user_details?userid=H1W35VxaegVFPj7zA27LCQ,Victoria D.,"Silver Spring, MD",5 star rating,"Got the brisket, chicken tacos and cucumber salad.  The brisket was so delicious, the chicken tacos also very good but be aware there is chili/srriracha sauce which I would've had put on the side because my son doesn't eat spicy foods.  I thought the cucumber salad could've use a little more flavor but the other food well made up for it.  Staff was quick and friendly."
