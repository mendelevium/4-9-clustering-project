We came to this place for her birthday and I must say it was a perfect place to celebrate with a group of friends.The service is friendly and pretty fast. Our server had informed us about the specials on their meals and wine, she went out of her way to make sure our dinner celebration was nice. The cocktails are yammy and I love the decor, it's pretty cool and a perfect place to meet up for drinks 5-7 or dinner. I recommend to try their pizza with beef or duck, if you're a meat-lover."
/user_details?userid=2wdHRk9mRN3zjHDS66ENbw,Doug B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A great drop in Italian/pizza restaurant along Plaza St-Hubert in Montreal's la Petite-Patrie district.  A basic Euro styled restaurant with wooden booths on one side, large central tables in the middle and standard tables on the other. The menu offers a wide variety of unique thin crust pizza options along with nicely presented entrees. The pizzas are a manageable eating size and are quite good. The The choices of toppings are unusual. I've had the Je me Souviens and Casablanca pizzas with tomato & bocconcini as a starter and enjoyed them all. Our server was prompt, very friendly and welcoming. Prices are decent. Best things: the pizzas, the relaxed European feel. Great area to walk around and shop after. Complaints: sat in one of the central tables and found the table legs and central pole made it awkward to get in and out plus a bit uncomfortable for anyone sitting there. Overall not a biggie but should be fixed somehow. Not the restaurants fault but parking can be a crapshoot in this area. I've gotten a spot right out front one time.. had to drive around looking other times. Might be best to take the metro. A good place to go though, food and price match well. You'll enjoy it."

I was perplexed as to why they shut down their Bernard location.But this is much better as it's much bigger and brighter in an area of St-Hubert that really needs places like this. They now offer breakfast and much more than just pizza.Their pizzas are top quality (my fave is the El Mariachi), I just tried the penne siciliana with Italian sausage. The fish and chips were good, but the fries were slightly burnt-tasting. They deliver and have some pizza specials, so definitely a yes for me."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"Things I find annoying: The spelling of the name of this restaurant. The use of the word artisan. The extra Z's. Why. Also: Plating of food with sauces decoratively shot around like you think you're Jackson Pollock. Why must you. Just relax.But you know what, it's a great little neighbourhood spot. Nice patio on St Hubert, cool local beer selection, tasty pizzas, and other comforting and carefully made things on the menu, and friendly prompt service."
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Four of us stopped by yesterday after wanting to try a new pizza place in town and being encouraged by the very high reviews Z Bistro has. We arrived at 8pm and were surprised (on a Saturday night) to find the restaurant completely empty. Immediately I got nervous that we had made a mistake - in coming that is. After all, most 4.5 star rated restaurants in the city are usually pretty busy on a  weekend night. Anyways, we were quickly seated and given menus. 3 of us opted for the creamy zucchini soup and we then each ordered a pizza (Z, Lucy, Bella Ciao, and the Habs). My first disappointment was the Long Island iced tea I had ordered - it was the flattest, most watered down sugary drink I've ever had (1/5 stars). Then the soups came and they were the second disappointment. Again, borderline watery and tasted purely of salt and potato - nothing creamy or zucchini-related here (2/5 stars). The pizzas were really nothing to write home about - they had a decent crust but the flavor profiles of each were a bit hit or miss (3/5 star average). Although service was great, I really don't understand what the high reviews are based on. To add insult to injury, 3 of the 4 had different digestive issues within 4-7 hours of having dinner here. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant unfortunately..."

/user_details?userid=1XdFW0RivEP2koAlRYrZYw,Lisa B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Had a wonderful first visit here. After a ski trip we were so hungry. The Marrakech was filling and tasty.  Smoked salmon sandwich was healthy and delicious. Potatoes are excellent! Service was welcoming and fast
/user_details?userid=HPxLcTHZqhD6hRKVpSPGbg,Marguerite L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I went there with a friend for lunch. Great lunch deal that offers appertizer and the main dish. The portions are big - I couldn't finish my penne and sausages - enough for two meals (doggy bag for later). Staffs seems friendly enough. Quick service.

/user_details?userid=nLL-JGqr4PaY8Rtf3fVqVw,Shawn R.,"Patchogue, NY",5 star rating,"Stopped here as we were in the neighborhood and just decided to try it out. I was so impressed by their tapas. We had the calamar grilled and the meatballs both delicious. The waiter did a great job being attentive and did his best to speak to us, although my French is not great his English was good."
