/user_details?userid=LPDOx50zUR-rEovzOhADbA,Rachel C.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,Vinh's is the best place to eat on campus hands down. The banh mi sandwiches are the best I've had in Montreal and they're SO affordable. I cannot begin to count the amount of times I've ordered my grilled pork sandwich with hoisin sauce after classes! They have NEVER disappointed and I'll really miss this place once I graduate. On top of everything else they now have a rewards card and if you order 10 sandwiches you'll get the 11th free. Beware of going during peak lunch hours though- there might be a long line but it generally goes by pretty quickly
/user_details?userid=gRTJX1byUA31E0OBqfYPIw,Veronica C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Vinh's banh mi are the best! Very affordable and delicious! It is definitely one of my go-to places on campus for lunch.
/user_details?userid=l9fGOqjEQDEN10Pog3cMng,Xena W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great place for reasonably priced food on the McGill campus. They have banh mi sandwiches, vermicelli bowls, spring rolls, steamed buns, and some desserts and Asian snacks. They also offer great vegan options like curry/soya tofu banh mi (ask for no mayo) and veggie steamed buns. The portion sizes are quite filling. The major downside is that there isn't much seating. I would come here more often if it wasn't so far away from where my classes are."
/user_details?userid=Qwrbfgn8iGcHQ5MaQfXiTA,Seasy H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Vinh's definitely gets my vote for top food place on campus! This arguably easier to find location across from Trottier gets tons of traffic during lunch hour (think: line to the door, even in the summer), but ordering, paying, and getting my food has never taken more than 20 minutes. The service is fast to the point where you may feel rushed at times, but my order has never been made wrong in the twenty-something occasions I've been there.One of my favourites at Vinh's is the beef roll with shrimp sauce, but you can choose to get it with peanut sauce instead. The vermicelli bowls are amazing; again, my favourite is beef. As for the subs, I would recommend the BBQ pork. Their portions are generous and super filling, and they serve coffee as well, which is always a plus in my book. Overall, I've enjoyed pretty much everything I've tried at Vinh's. Against popular opinion, I'd even choose to eat here over Vua - but that's also because I don't like walking back up that hill."
/user_details?userid=pV5yh55j12SWmipNv53qsQ,Thea M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"BLESS VINH'S. As other reviewers have said, this is by far the best and most affordable option on campus. The banh mi's are huge and generously stuffed, and won't come out to more than $5.My go-to are the veggie noodles which are in the fridge near the cash. My only complaint is that the packaging is awkward and messy, but it's so filling and wonderfully spiced. They also have a spice bar so you can adjust the flavor to your liking!If I'm not in a rush/not broke I like to indulge in the ""pho"" which isn't particularly authentic, but just such a nice treat on cold winter days. It's only served 11:30-3:30 though :(The only thing from Vinh's that I didn't enjoy was the steamed veggie bun. I found it to be a bit sweet which was odd to me, but I also don't really like steamed buns in general so that may be it."
/user_details?userid=RO55qRu4TvHogzSOGERxKA,Anahita M.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My favorite place to eat on campus/ OneCard!! Vinh's is located next to the RVC cafeteria and it's open til about 5 I think. I've tried their dumpling soup, grilled chicken banh mi and chicken pho all of which were delicious and not to mention super cheap ( banh mi- $5 and pho-$7). When you buy a banh mi, they give you a little green card punch card so you get a free one for every $10 you buy which is nice. Also they have a little area behind which has a variety of condiments to add to your meal. I'm a big fan of chili oil but I'd just like to warn that their chili oil is one of the hottest ones I've tried so be very wary if you're adding that your soup or anything else :)"
/user_details?userid=Zd3zd6qztBvRvr0bbdpTdg,Zahra V.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,I didn't think that I could find such tasty food on campus! This place has exceeded my expectations greatly. It comes close to some of the good pho places I've tried in the city. So far I have only tried their steamed veggie bun and the veggie pho (with beef broth I believe) and they were both pretty good.
/user_details?userid=ppUS3G3bVNNqvjAKsi1BbA,Jinny L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I'm a frequent customer, and I love the steamed chicken pho, pork bao/ vegeterian buns and the banh mi's are pretty good as well! The only thing is that they don't heat up their banh mi bread so it's always cold when you're looking for something warm to eat. They also have a good variety of cool asian drinks like mango juice and bannana cola which is awesome! Also, in this location there are very few seats so expect to get it for takeout when you're in rush hours. This place is less stuffy and cleaner in my opinion than the one in the music building so I like to go here, but if you want a comfortable seat it's better to go to the one in the music building! This place is good but Vua down on university serves cheaper, better banh mi in my opinion, but if you're lazy like me and like to stay on McGill campus, then this is the place to eat! :p"
/user_details?userid=w-gL6px0iCRb8lJcEFXzlA,Tamim S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,Probably the best food in McGill campus. Great pricing. The beef Vermicelli bowl is my personal favorite.There is often a lineup around lunch time. They accept all type of credit cards including AMEX.
/user_details?userid=Fo7QxWwvWD609BSyFBUNng,Jill B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My main point echoes what other reviewers have said: BLESS VINH'S! In the culinary wasteland that is the downtown McGill campus, Vinh's is a lifesaver! It's not the best Vietnamese food I've ever had and realistically more of a 2.5-3 star establishment, but it gets 4 stars anyways for providing the best, quickest, and most reasonably priced meal on campus. The classic sandwich is only 3.45$ and delicious! Just make sure to speak up if you want extras or chiles on your sandwich because they often seem to forget. I've tried a few other menu items (vermicelli bowl, pho) which have proven to be pretty meh flavour-wise and at least double the cost of a sandwich - stick with the banh mi!"
