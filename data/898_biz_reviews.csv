/user_details?userid=JuzGYnX2zArwZMM-5IhZHQ,Erika D.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Fantastic, homey place for Caribbean food. I'm reviewing for both Take Out (during Covid19) and dine in (pre-Covid). I have only good things to say about this restaurant. I first heard of them from Dining on a dime. I knew I had to go because it just looked INCREDIBLE and I can definitely say that this place is one of my favourite places to go to in Montreal. To be honest, everything I've had here was fantastic. I recommend their goat curry roti. It's stuffed! To the brim with potatoes and deliciously tender pieces of goat. It's super flavourful. I also love their oxtail curry, doubles and jerk chicken. The oxtail curry is soft and savoury (not spicy), and is so comforting. The most amazing part of all of these meals is the hot sauce. Their hot sauce is a punch on the tongue (in the best way possible!), super flavourful and spicy! Service is fantastic and takeout is super quick. Right now as I write this, on their Instagram they're inviting folks who are not doing well to come over and eat a free meal on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  What an amazing place!"
/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Unfortunately, my experience at this restaurant was not great. I decided to give this restaurant/counter a try since they have such great reviews. However, I was quite disappointed. I ordered the goat and chicken roti and within a minute it was ready for pick up. At first bite, I would've liked it to be much hotter as if it were cooked fresh. Also, there was an uneven proportion of meat and potato (favouring the potato) which I was not so pleased about. A quarter way through, I decided to open up the roti and go for the remaining meat. I found myself finding a couple of pieces of chicken remaining with small amounts of goat (mostly fatty pieces). The rest was mostly the dough from the roti. I also got the plantains as a side order and I knew I made a mistake when I tried cutting them into bite size pieces. They were pretty stale, as if they were cooked much earlier in the day (not fresh at all). Needless to say, I was not satisfied. The only reason why I am giving 2 starts and not one is because of the staff and their hot sauce. The staff were friendly and the hot sauce was pretty tasty."

Coming from NYC, living in Queens, NY and in a West Indian neighborhood- and I've never had such good roti. I had the chicken, goat and beef roti and all three were amazing. Ian, the owner is so great and convinced me to get a pineapple soda instead of a basic coke and it was delicious. If you want good West Indian curry this is the place to go!"

Today I was lucky enough to eat at Caribbean Curry House.  I ordered the Oxtail plate and also a small order of their Jerk chicken to give it a try.  When you first walk in you immediately feel welcome, very friendly staff with smells of delicious foods.  A small and cozy place, clean and comfortable; the very pretty and friendly girl behind the counter recommended a Jamaican soda called ""Ting"" with my meal, basically a very delicious grapefruit soda that tasted like a Fresca but with half the sugar, very tasty and refreshing.  The Oxtail plate was amazing, super tender with rice and a simple salad - side note: was very pleased to see a salad with iceberg lettuce :) it sounds weird but I can't stand arugula salads with other weird soft leaves  that have no crunch - salad is supposed to be crunchy lol.  Their Jerk chicken was fall off the bone spicy and flavourful, very happy I grabbed a small plate to give it a try.  Overall I can not recommend this place enough, I will for sure be returning again.  Side note they will be opening for Breakfast on Saturdays and Sundays so I'm eager to try that as well.  Cheers to the staff and owners this place is the shit."

/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is what I want most restaurants to be. Delicious and cheap with friendly people. We had a beef patty, a double, the jerk chicken platter and the goat roti. All were great! I didn't know what a double was, I just ordered it blindly, but it was super tasty and reminded me of samosa chaat. They forgot the goat roti initially so it took a bit longer to get that but it was worth the wait. Jerk chicken had tons of spice and flavor and the chicken was moist. I'm not in Cote-des-Neiges often enough, but I would make a trip just to eat here."
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Location: Victoria, below Jean-Talon. If you're using transit, Plamondon is the closest subway (less than 10 minutes away if you're walking). If you plan to use street parking, be sure to check the signage. The place: I can't comment on the location or service because a group of us called in our order for pick-up. The process is pretty smooth - just call them to place your order to make sure it's ready for pick-up at the time you plan to go. The goods: I should start by saying that I'm not an expert on Caribbean cuisine. In fact, the extent of my knowledge starts and ends with Jamaican patties. However, I do think I have a decent, though be it, selective palate. I'm a big fan of the Roti - I ordered the shrimp and wasn't disappointed at all. The ratio of shrimp to chickpea/potato/veg was pretty good, and the size of the Roti was definitely big enough for one person. The flavors were subtle, yet delicious - for those of you worried about spice, this isn't spicy at all. Based on my buddy's feedback (he's a regular), these guys will make it as spicy as you want, but you have to ask for it. He also says it's the best place in town to get Roti and so far, I can't disagree. Great place to grab lunch.Service: N/APrice point: The shrimp Roti was $8.95. I feel like that's a bit steep, but like I said, the portion is pretty good. Check it out and let you judge for yourselves."

/user_details?userid=Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I used to eat here off and on all the time until about 6 years ago when I moved out of town. When I came back, I had read some mediocre reviews so I had neglected to go back until this past weekend. I had the shrimp plate, which should be called the shrimp and chickpea plate. It was well-spiced and I really enjoyed the curry mixed with the rice and peas. The salad was basic, and the fried plantains (which are one of my favorite things ever) a little dry. I feel as if they make one batch and serve them all day. They have a number of fun drinks, so I had a coconut pineapple soda which reminded me a little bit of cream soda with a tropical twist - really nice.I also tried a bite of my sister's chicken roti, and that had a different combination of spices that was really tasty as well. I came back today to have one of the beef patties, and it was the best patty I have ever had! No lie. It was moist and had the perfect level of heat. The price point is perfect too, so I feel like I will be stopping in here more regularly in future."

/user_details?userid=McPdGlOf-Mv58CLMofj7HA,Craighton Y.,"Cleveland, OH",4 star rating,In town for a few days and One of the many things I love about Canada is its diversity of people which leads to diversity of food. It's been a long time since I had a good roti so that's where my search began. After browsing around I came across this place which had pretty good reviews over all. The location itself isn't that large but it was perfectly personified the family run setup.  Once waking in you'll notice the menu is on the wall opposite the counter you place your order at. I glanced over the menu already knowing what I planned to order and was quite surprised by the nice selection of food.  Even the Roti selection has many choices . This time I got 1 chicken roti and 1 goat roti. Both of them were excellent but I must say I enjoyed the chicken roti the most. Add a little peppa sauce which is displayed on the table and you have yourself a fantastic snack and/or meal. I defended will give this place another visit when I am back in Montreal.

/user_details?userid=ZGiwU16rhGvWAYUzkWL0xw,Boz X.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"What surprised me the most is that they prepare their rotis beforehand and only heat them up in the microwave (i think) for a couple seconds before serving...real turn off for me.Food: Goat roti was the best (4/5) but chicken roti (2.5/5) wasnt as tasty as you'd expect and I didnt find it to work well with the spices in the curry (it's the same curry for every roti). The beef patties have a good flaky pastry that is a bit crispy on the outside and not dried out on the inside, but I found the beef filling to be really average: had good flavors but no meat flavor, so it sucked, but at 1.35$ -ish, I didnt complain.Service:The indians, whom I suspect to be the owners, looked unhappy ad unwelcoming both times I visited. They were rude to their staff, and impatient with me."

The cashier was mellow and friendly. Will surely return and try new items.

This was not a good visit, the curry was fresh "" meaning it smelled amazing but had no flavor"" the passion fruit was amazing. So after the fresh curry I went back to ask for two roti skins and I was told that they had a rush now and couldn't afford to sell me two skins because they have customers that might want the same skins that I stood in line for.My opinion is that you can find way better West Indian places than this place I will never give them my money or time ever again."

Doesn't look like nothing at first because the place is so small (maybe sit 20) but once you walk in you fall in love with the ambiance. Great Caribbean music, all the smells come together and the staff is smiling and very friendly. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is that the service is a little slow and you have to stand in line to get your order taken.Everything on the menu is no more than 15$ and you get very good portion. Perfect use of spices not too much but just enough that you can get your spice fix. My boyfriend and his brother had a Rotti that I tried and wasn't crazy about but the jerk chicken was to die for.So since that first time my boyfriend took me there we have been back many time and its always good. This is one of the best place in Montreal to get Caribbean food."

Spice, zest, heat, tang, all at the same time!The litmus test for Caribbean food has always been how well they do their Jerk Chicken, Oxtail Stew, Ackee (fish) and fried plantains. I have not tried all these items but based on my experience with the Jerk Chicken and Chicken Roti (voted the best in Montreal) that will soon not be the case.If you can't stand spice or heat, or like your food bland, then don't come here, go to Burger King instead. Vegetarians  also have options here as they are items like Vegetable Roti on their menu.All items on the menu are $12 or less, this place is a bit small, maybe seats 20 people max, and there is a take-out counter.

I wish there had been more plantain.
