/user_details?userid=CtBx4yk_QM8ClITgw94TPQ,Simon P.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I had heard good things about Nagomi and was excited to try it. I'm sad to report that the food was pretty bland and uninspired.I LOVE ramen. It's my favorite comfort food. And we've been spoiled in Montreal in terms of ramen restaurants. Nagomi's ramen was bland and had no soul. It was boringly tasteless. There was absolutely nothing exciting about it.The sushi was OK, but again, nothing exciting. Sushi shop three blocks away delivers more creative, tastier options.All this for 70$. I was disappointed.On the bright side the place is nice and the service was OK. There were a few patrons on a rainy Saturday night during a pandemic so maybe some of their other dishes are more exciting."

Spent $70 for grilled chicken on rice and chicken cutlet danburi. Both were super salty and small portions. Fried chicken cutlet was soggy and oily. The spring rolls were pale coloured and gummy inside. Steamed Gyoza was $6.50 for 4 of the tiny dry dumplings ever. We could not even eat the food. Disgusting never going back.
