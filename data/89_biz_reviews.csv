/user_details?userid=DfHYd_XUqnI1-IUNtgzlOQ,Abigail P.,"Kanata, Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"This has been my go-to takeout/delivery restaurant for the past 4 years while living in montreal. Whether you're looking for a late night snack or comfort food for dinner you can't go wrong with Boustan, especially since there is no delivery fee and is open until 4am on weekends. My go to order is always the chicken shawarma wrap all dressed with red rice and garlic sauce on the rice for $9. Big portions, delicious food, relatively cheap, and free delivery!"
/user_details?userid=GBHgHiYLASLNUE-bELxp0w,Nathan N.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"My mother and I were on a weeklong vacation in the Montreal area because why not. Looking for good food places to eat, this place was recommended by fellow Yelpers. And oh my God. This place's food was absolutely delicious. I'm absolutely astounded at how good the food was. The food memory I have of this place is so vivid. If there is any restaurant to hit up in Montreal, it's this place -- Boustan. One of the best things I ever ate in Montreal. Maybe the best thing I ate in Montreal. This place has made me claim my fanaticism for Lebanese food.I ordered the shawarma combo plate, which is also what Mom ordered. We were both happy with our joint decision. The combination of everything on the plate was so delicious. Nothing was slacking. Generous portions of food, but boy did I want more. The food speaks for itself."

/user_details?userid=oHZwAtzy8LaIdq-dSgGruA,Lysha L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Atmosphere/Service: the place was kind of hard to find as it was downstairs in a small corner so keep your eyes open! It wasn't busy when we first arrived. But at around 8-9, the place started getting packed! it was a small spot with at least 20 seatings or so and 6 tables. Menu/food: we were given lot on a plate. And I was even more surprised when we were given a lot of meat to pair with our carbs! I've been to places where they skim on the meat but I'm glad restaurant boustan gave us a lot that I was full off just the meat itself! Also the meat wasn't too dry or too oily, tender and flavourful! You could either go with the beef or the chicken, or BOTH! Who can say no to both?!Overall: Great fast eat. Don't let the decor turn you away, nor the people serving you as they a little intimidating too. And go on an empty stomach as you're served a lot of meat and carbs :)"
/user_details?userid=M7vDDzoPNQDN2FdTcwCq4A,Eric W.,"Hartford, CT",4 star rating,"Ah, Halal and Mediterranean food. When it's done right, it's done RIGHT. Let me explain...Atmosphere/Appearance: Almost on the corner of the busy, what seemed to be restaurant row (well, one of them) is this place. Highly recommended by many articles, so we had to try this place out. It's underneath some apartments so you have to walk down from street level, but there's nice outdoor seating right outside the restaurant. Once inside I'm instantly reminded of New York City spot. The line is always long and there's a limited availability of seats. The order counter is right in front of the kitchen with that nice glass you can see through to all of the delicious you're about to feast on.Service: There isn't any for real. There is a guy that will be going through the line asking you what you want in advance so that he can prepare it in advance to speed things up. There aren't the nicest here, but I guess they don't need to be. Lol.Food: Absolutely fantastic and it's in abundance. You get SO MUCH food in the trio combo. You get rice, a salad, potatoes, beef, chicken and another kind of beef plus pita bread... I mean, it's just SO MUCH FOOD. Lol. It's easily good for 2 meals any day.Value: It was like $11.95CAD. I couldn't believe how cheap the food was! That's like $9.00 USD and you basically get 2 meals out of it! How is this possible?! Lol.In conclusion, this place is awesome at any time of the day. They're open until 4:00am so it's the perfect place for hangover food, regular dinner food, lunch or that after a night of parting food. Come check this place out."
/user_details?userid=ybt7rx15lQ5h46WrD0m0Eg,Susan L.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,"Plate has enough food for 2 people Pita is portioned for 1 person Walk up to counter, order, let them know what dressings or sides you want (hummus, garlic sauce, salad, radish, rice, etc). The garlic sauce is so good! All sides were delicious, and if you get the plate, you also get pita bread to create your perfect bite.Would recommend the chicken over the beef. Beef was tender but a bit dry. If ordering kebabs, make sure to allot 5-10 minute extra wait time.Plenty of seats. Also some outdoor seating but not sure if it is for this restaurant."
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"Boustan is a classic that needs no introduction. The amount of Boustan's in Montreal and the surrounding burbs is crazy. Expanded like crazy; I see them everywhere now. This is the OG location (since 1986).The hours are amazing. Open every day till 4:00am! What more could you want? I've been several times during my university days but for my most recent trip, we went twice. Both times were at night; once at 3:00am and the other around midnight. The quality seemed better in the wee hours but you'll likely be waiting in line for much longer.Menu is straightforward; pitas and platter options.- 2x Chicken pita ($5.65) - we got the same thing both trips. First time, the shawarma was delicious. Second time around, it was sooo salty. Love how they crisp and toast up the pitas. To be honest, I can't complain too much; it's dirt cheap and open insanely late.The perfect late night spot to get your late night cravings in. Come after clubbing or wandering around downtown. The drunker/hungrier you are, the better it'll be. 3.5 stars."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Even after so many years, this is still my to-go spot for shish taouk or late night food. It's just so good and flavorful. The hummus and garlic sauce are very good, the potatoes are soft and the chicken is not dry. The service is quick and the price is decent for the quantity and deliciousness. The best thing about this place is the opening hours. Even if it's very late, you know Boustan is always there for you."
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I must have imagined I wrote this 5 star review years ago --- glad I checked and actually wrote it today! It is not uncommon for me (I figure I'm not alone) to crave Boustan at all hours - from lunch to late night snack. With so many reviews I'm sure the garlic sauce, potatoes and 'chicken Shawarma (when sliced off the rotisserie) not actually called Shish Taouk unless it's on the skewer*' from what I've been told and from experience' in wrap or plate format have already been discussed and over examined. I believe the food they serve is exemplary, but this review isn't all about what is more or less common 'foodie' knowledge - it's really a shout out the work ethic of the staff - because those folks work hard and at many times of the day it's non-stop (there can be people in line for long stretches and then they have to be ready for the next wave). With no doubt doing this day in and day out while keeping a pleasant demeanor is commendable and not an easy feat. To that point I give many thanks, and say good job in keeping your original location going strong after all these years; plus many locals and tourists fed well. Note: I have not had a bad item on their menu and hope to try everything they offer. I'm getting there - been trying the veggie items lately and they are also tops. I'll admit it took me years to even know about and then try the Creation sandwich. It's a little rich for me, but those that like it, do seem to like it a lot; and I won't stand in their way.*If I made an error explaining the difference in styles, write me a note."
/user_details?userid=D-8kTlWjrZ-cf3iyvImezg,Sagar A.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Great food with affordable prizes. Available almost 24/7. Being a vegetarian I haven't tried any non veg food however I strongly recommend the place.
/user_details?userid=ARFM4LrI_zxogm1L29ZKng,Farrah B.,"Brooklyn, NY",3 star rating,"We were wandering for food on a busy Sunday night (about 11pm) when my eyes fell on Boustan.  It was one of the places I wanted  try on our return trip to MTL this year.  We walked into a bustling no frills Mediterranean restaurant with beautiful chicken and lamb shawarma resting on the spit. I ended up with a platter (eyes over stomach) and the BF got a chicken shawarma pita. First weird thing, they charge for tabbouleh on a platter. Then we get to the register and they charged us $1usd to $1cad! The cashier then said you can use a card. The machine looked a little suspicious as it had duck tape on the swipe and said no swipes, chips only. I was fuming but also starving, so I paid $22.15usd for a $22.13 meal. Tips are usually a part of my routine, but after this incident, I think not, after taking ""a tip"" of almost 40%.As for the food? Outstanding. All the memories of delicious tastes of Lebanon were in the platter. There were a few mysterious extremely crunchy bits and the hummus tasted like it had turned. But other than that, really delicious. I really wanted to leave more stars, but after being taken advantage of this is the best I could do. We will likely come back but with Canadian dollars and a calcultor."
/user_details?userid=gEtdFQBqJXj0MgPtANGisw,Mitch J.,"Rockford, IL",5 star rating,"With so many reviews, I can't say anything that hasn't already been said. All I'll say is this place looks like it would not be good, but it blew away our expectations. Their meat is cooked on a rotisserie and tastes delicious. We liked their chicken even better than the beef, which doesn't happen much! We got the chicken/beef shawarma plate but next time I think we'd just get the chicken because it was so good. Also, the plates are big enough for two to share--a really good value for the price! The guy who takes your order is a little gruff but other than that the service was good. We enjoyed our experience here!"

He made the food with anger and frustration. The meat was MICROWAVED. PLEASE BE AWARE They are not honest about the money. Be careful because they do charge way more than you should. Make sure to calculate the exact price before handing them any money. They don't even GIVE RECEIPTS! COUNT YOUR MONEY!!!"

Service is excellent and we ordered a couple of things including beef and chicken kebabs.Location is perfect - in the heart of downtown on a bustling and busy Crescent St. Perfect place for a quite bite after some binge drinking !!!
/user_details?userid=sieP-_A4CPXHU0ONM476RA,Kristi T.,"Kaneohe, HI",5 star rating,"Do you ever eat until you're on the verge of throwing up, refrain from throwing up.. Then continue eating? That is the experience I had with Boustan. After a sudden and complete URGE to have shawarma, I did some major googling to find that Boustan is one of the best in the area. - The service here is very up front and quick. They're generally pleasant, but I got the vibe that they just want to get to business because they're always busy, and deal with a lot of plates and wrapping that they don't have time to chit chat and be super friendly.- It's very casual, so I felt welcomed in that sense.. It's more chill than I thought it would be. I definitely would've dined but I wanted to get back to my warm hotel room- The food is prepared quickly, thank goodness! They wrap things up quite nicely and you're able to take napkins and forks after you've gotten all your food.- It's not that expensive imo, and even if it were, it'd be well worth the price, which leads me to..- THE FOOD. It's warm, it's home-y, it's full of flavor. You want to keep eating, so you do! The pita is a little chewier than I'd like, but perfect as a side. The meats are so well cooked and seasoned, you can't get much better. The white sauce.. Can you ever go wrong? Probably not. The potatoes are so tasty and crispy, a definite must have. A nice break from the heavy meat. Many people get it as a side because it's just that good. I've found myself craving a mixed plate from Boustan. It's 2am where I am right now, and I could 100%, without doubt finish a plate. Why isn't Canada closer to me?"
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Our regular order is the Shawarma Combo Plate of Chicken & Beef with a side of potatoes with their famous garlic sauce!!

My boyfriend got the chicken shawarma and he thought it was the best he's had! I got the falafel platter, which was pretty good. A bit dry but still better than many falafels I've had! They also have a vegetarian platter so there are some veggie options as well. They have both indoor and outdoor seating which is nice."
/user_details?userid=vWWas7IVzjGwLw6TyD2ikQ,Amit R.,"Huntington, NY",5 star rating,Amazing little spot for Persian/Lebanese food!  I tried the chicken and beef plate with rice and hummus.  There was also a little helping of garlic butter which was a nice touch.  The staff was very helpful and accommodating.  Highly recommended!
/user_details?userid=0EFlK44Q0u2MJn4BLItfSw,Tim P.,"Brampton, Canada",4 star rating,"First time I came to this restaurant was by pure accident and luck. Visiting Montreal and gotten drunk at late night and in need of good food I found a small gem.4 years later I learn that this small place is a local favourite. It is not hard to see why: the food tastes amazing. It's not the decor, the presentation on the dish, or the music. I would come here when I visit Montreal any time. It's that good. But I am taking one star off because I am an environmentalist and I unfortunately saw the staff put the styrofoam plate into the microwave to warm up the rice. Considering that the rice is in a container that could be used to warm it up already when they scoop it, I found this surprising. I understand that they have salad and vegetables right next to it but it could be insulated or relocated on top instead of as a part of the equipment...OR just serve on a microwave safe plate?"

Don't let it fool you. The food here is unlike anything I've ever tried. If I lived in Montreal, I would probably eat here when I'm having a bad day because they offer ""pick me up"" grub. My husband and I were visiting for a short period of time and got a recommendation from a friend who lived in the area. My husband still raves about the shawarma. I loved their veggie wrap too! Ah, and their poutine was sooo dang delicious. First time I've tried potatoes with gravy and cheese curds and I'm totally hooked!"
/user_details?userid=1Bljt-GngRP4XxkQFLnHHQ,Rod M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"When you think of shish tawouk in Montreal, Boustan on Crescent Street has to be top of the list. This is a hole in the wall type spot that has been doing what they do very well for a very long time. The resto is in a semi-basement space of Crescent street and has a small amount of seating inside and outside. There is nothing fancy here but the food is great. I believe that a couple of years ago the original owners sold the business and I was a bit concerned that there could be a change to the food. I'm pleased to say that things have remained consistent and the food is still great. I guess the only real change is to some of the staff and the fact that you now see Boustan opening up other locations around town."
/user_details?userid=y3SZACKfgAx_ZKJgO3SWiA,Athulya B.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"This is probably one of my favourite shawarma places in Montreal. I used to go here almost everyday when I used to be in University! They have amazing trio combos, the best ones for me are the beef and the creation. The creation shawarma includes both chicken and beef, egg, eggplants and potatoes. You have everything on the menu here on your shawarma. This is a particular location you need to go, not every Boustan location gives you the same service and quality of food. Only thing I'd improve would be the seating space. I'll definitely come back again and again."

/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Boustan is the king of Montreal Lebanese take out for many well deserved reasons. I've been going to the original (and best) location on Crescent for over ten years on a regular basis. The place is a destination and a reason as good as any to come to Montreal.To understand Boustan is to understand the original concept as designed by the former owner Imad Smaidi, aka Mr. Boustan. A jovial and hard working fellow who served every single dish to his customers with love and care. His standard of quality and work ethic was uncompromisingly high. Mr. Boustan would have his own method of preparing the chicken shawarma, toasting the pitas on a grill, and essentially timing the prep of every single dish so that the potatoes and rice were piping hot, while the coleslaw was cold and crunchy. The chicken would be golden brown on the outside, and overflowing with moisture inside. Sliced thick and served generously, any meat platter could satisfy even the most demanding of appetites. The garlic sauce and hummus were homemade and spectacular. There was never a charge if you wanted extra sauce or turnips. The flavour palate seemed to derive from an otherworldly source; the perfect balance of salt, fat, and crunch. This food fed your soul as much as it did your stomach.In 2012, Mr. Boustan, sold his place and I get the impression that it's changed hands a few more times since. The good news is that NOTHING has changed. They haven't changed the food, the decor, the way they prep the dishes, the menu, or the prices. It's brilliant! This place is a Montreal classic and one of a kind. It deserves its 5 stars 10 times over. My only concern is how fast they have expanded. There used to be only one Boustan. Then, there were two. Almost overnight, 15 others popped up. I've ordered from the one on Cote des Neiges quite often. It's almost the same, but not a perfect replica of the original. I know the owners must see dollar signs and are excited to cash in. Please be careful that you don't turn into the next Amir serving derivative reheated sludge using the lowest standards you can get away with. Not that I have any indication that this is happening, but expansion can be dangerous to a brand. There is great value in continuity and familiarity. I hope we'll always have a Boustan in this city."

/user_details?userid=f-v5RzTaeGthxUQjxwc_vg,Marie M.,"Lincoln, RI",5 star rating,"The food here deserves an A++I found a slice of heaven in a Lebanese fast food joint. I ordered the shawarma combo plate--the MOST satisfying item on the menu, in my humble opinion. The perfectly marinated and grilled chicken & beef platter included flavorfully seasoned potatoes, rice, well-made hummus, garlic sauce, pita bread and salad. Huge portions; best to order in a to-go box if you're not sharing it with anyone. You'll definitely have leftovers, unless you have a more than hearty appetite. The shawarma here beats any I've ever had in the past. Excellent food. Quick, friendly service. Seating available inside and outside. Very casual. Inexpensive. My husband, who is crazy about shawarma, will drive 6 hours from Little Rhody to Montreal just to come here. Seriously."

This includes two types of rice, potatoes, hummus, garlic mayo, salad, pickled beets, and pita. I opted for the kafta kebab, which took a little bit longer than their shwarma. But when it was ready, it was hot and super flavourful. I really enjoyed my food. My cousins got the pita wraps, which were quite filling and cheap. Definitely check this place out for some cheap eats that will fill you up."

/user_details?userid=79PMejA4-xLHlYWPIxAZfw,Meghna S P.,"Milwaukee, WI",5 star rating,"This was our absolute favorite for a late night bite in Montreal. I can't stress enough how amazing their food is. Boustan is located in the heart of downtown close to many fun bars and lounges, so is perfect for one to grab a bite in the evening or a late night snack. Their seating is cafeteria or casual style and the space is located underground - you need to take a few steps to go from road level to the restaurant. Their sauces are delicious and quantity is ample. One could easily share a platter with another. They use a lot of garlic in their sauces which makes it really flavorful and delicious. The shawarmas come with freshly cut meat, coleslaw, potatoes, hummus, garlic sauce and you can add falafels. If in Montreal and you crave Mediterranean food, definitely make a visit here."

Omg the portions here are huge! They are super generous! Make sure to ask for their hot sauce. So addictive. Unlike some reviews, they have always been nice to me.

It's a nice mix of the meat and vegetables - I never know eggplant in shawarma would be so damn good! We have a few criticisms for this place - there wasn't enough meat in the sandwich, there wasn't enough spicy sauce, and they didn't grill it long enough (half was warm, half was cold). However, since it was only 5 bucks, it's hard not to give such a delicious sandwich 5 stars. Worth a try!"

Went here after our first night out at 2am- didnt expect much except for it to be a spot drunk ppl went after. I asked for extra pickled beets and the guy just smiled and loaded the plate with everything. I wasnt expecting much and took one bite and wow... instant . It looks like a plate you would get at Mamoons or your avg chicken and rice dish, but its def not the case. Bouston uses this amazing hot sauce.. none that ive ever tasted before- its not like your avg Franks hot sauce or tobasco sauce.. its like a paste that is spicy but I felt like it had a hint of miso in it.. not sure how they make this sauce but OMG i wanted more. The meat they use is beef (not your typicla lamb) and chicken. I wasnt able to get the tabouleh the first time we went so i had to come back the next day and redeem myself. Forget about chicken & rice after drinking- yall need to try this magic plate of pure goodness. The next day we biked for hours and were famished- all I had in mind was bouston, bouston... and bouston. We walked in and what a warm greeting from the owners.. what was most impressive was the fact that he spit out verbatim what we ordered the night before... including my extra pickled beets! I ordered the combo plate w tabouleh this time- tasted even better then when  i remebered it the night before."

The first time was a complete accident finding this place few years ago when my family and I visited Montréal. This time I wanted to come back here because I really enjoyed their food. It is a no frills Lebanese restaurant. The space inside is not too big, the tables are really close to each other (almost feeling a bit claustrophobic), and the lines are almost always pretty long. The service is pretty straight forward - you wait in the line, order your food, wait for your food, get your food, and sit and eat. They give you quite a lot of food. Some type of a protein is on top rice, and pan fried potato cubes, you get cabbage salad, big spoonful of hummus, a huge dollop of garlic mayo, and a pita. I got shawarma combo, and my husband got Kafta arayes (instead of plain pita, they stuff 2 pitas with meat mixture). Seriously, after you eat here you get so full. There are other locations, but I went to the one near McGill Univ."

Amazing value, excellent food, superior service, slightly-sketchy looking dive to add just the right amount of street-cred legitimacy, PERFECT.

/user_details?userid=-sEcRke-8eUZLWbn0XkrCA,Sach D.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Stopped in for a late night snack during a quick trip to Montreal. I haven't done many reviews on Middle Eastern food, but honestly it is one of my favourite groups of cuisine.The pita is key, often it's unleavened and that is the case here at Boustan. Good kebab shops have huge turnover of product, which keeps the pita fresh, not crumbly, and has enough moisture to allow for a nice chew. The spices/marinade, as well as both cooking temperature and time, are clearly optimal here, as the meat is cooked perfectly with a touch of char. Flavour is excellent and authentic.Toppings are typical, and fresh.Very nice price point too... Definitely check this place out for a quick lunch or after a big night out."

Shawarma sandwich with garlic potatoes. Garlic potatoes, one word: phenomenal! A home run for $2.25 a plate which is a steal in my opinion! So amazingly good I went back for another portion. Dining room even has a TV for everyone to enjoy their food and even at 11pm at night this place was packed."

The sauce is magical, and the pickled vegetables adds a perfect tangyness and sourness that complements it extremely well. To top it all off, the pita is toasted to perfection, just the right amount of crispness.  I tried the spicy version; it could definitely use a tad more heat (but then again, that's personal preference). My friend tried the chicken wrap. Portion wise,  the creation wrap was noticeably bigger. Check it out, order a creation wrap, you won't be disappointed."
/user_details?userid=jomQTesALTTWq4wgsquq9A,Victor T.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"Not a bad place if you want a decent sized portion of food. The reason why it only gets two stars is because the way they prep their food. Microwaving rice in a styrofoam container is a big no no in restaurant etiquette even though we all do it from time to time, this was clearly unacceptable. The meats had okay flavour, rice was a little bland but everything else you would expect on a shawarma plate tasted alright."

I'm convinced the food in Montreal is better than in Toronto. We had the garlic potatoes with mayo. Wow, so creamy and fluffy and garlicky goodness. Thank god we only had a small order to share between the three of us because I could eat these for daaayyys. We also tried the Poutine made with the same garlic potatoes. Best poutine I've ever had. Period. Yup! I said it. And it's from a Lebanese place. It was so good and it didn't have the traditional beef gravy, which I do like. It was a lighter coloured gravy, tasted more like a rotisserie chicken gravy but amazingly good nonetheless. Overall, that dish was another one where I am lucky we do not live in Montreal and that we also got a small. These dishes make me want to be glutinous. Like, I don't even know what to say. Both were very good and let's be clear, they are well known for these potatoes. So I am not the first to rave about them. We had two falafel sandwiches and a chicken shawarma as well . Both delicious. The chicken was seasoned very well for the shawarma and they do this thing with the pitas where they toast them on the grill. Delicious! I prefer the falafel. All of the food was pretty delicious and my husband said the customer service was really good. Nice guys. Thanks for the amazing food experience Montreal. This place is a gem!"

The garlic potatoes are pretty addictive. I did see the employees reheat the beef shawarma in the microwave, but i'm not mad at them. I understand the difficulty and need to keep up with production.

I'm hoping my fellow Americans can find the answer to that on November 8.I should have read up on it, but didn't. Comfortable with my knowledge of Middle Eastern cuisines and having faith in Montreal's amazing history of multiculturalism, I didn't sweat the details. I only looked briefly in the direction of the orange colored dish with Shish Taouk written as the descriptor. Had I paid enough attention, I would have realized that it's Chicken Shawarma, not Shish Taouk. I have no idea why Montrealers have allowed this error to persist: Chicken Shawarma is definitely not the same as Shish Taouk. Why do people confuse the two candidates for selection as the same? Facts matter ;)In this case, thankfully, the stakes weren't high. The trio set me back by a mere 8CAD. And, while I didn't think much of the chicken pita, the garlic potatoes were outstanding. Highly recommended. Also, I thought the Baklava had great texture, even if it tasted average.Boustan is smack dab in the middle of tourist central, the prices are fantastic for the location, and it's a great value if you're in the area. But, it's just not destination dining. It's disappointing to see this as the first name come up in a search for Shish Taouk in Montreal.

Both plates came with delicious picked veggies, rice, soft potatoes, which we smothered in garlic sauce and hummus. The meat was flavorful and tender, and we wolfed our plates down. I'd give it 5 stars if the platter was $9-10 instead of $11-12 (quadruple digits is high for late night, hole in wall, sober-me-up food) but for the amount of food on it, it was a great deal."

Just married and returned to Montreal for the holidays with my husband. After a couple of pints at Hurley's I was excited for my new hubby to have the full Montreal experience and end the night with Boustan sandwiches. We visited around 8:30pm when it was quiet. Ordered our food and while watching it being prepped and other people served, I noticed that the cashier put the wrong sandwich in the bag. I questioned him as to what we had ordered and he was very flippant and short with me; tearing the receipt from the register and pounding it with his finger. I was totally put off. We took the bag and left. As we were leaving I could hear him talking about me back at the counter - yah, the white girl speaks Arabic. Lo and behold we were indeed given the wrong order. Very disappointing to be treated like this and embarrassing to have it happen after I gushed on about how great a place Boustan is. I've always been a fan and even filmed an episode for the Travel Network there several years ago. I won't be back."

After three tries, I think I am done trying Boustan.It is not bad food per se; it is tasty, it is just not worth it when you are in Montreal, unless you are stuck somewhere nearby and are low on cash. Their shawarma is nothing special or different, bread is the regular pita you would buy from grocery store or is served at Amir... In fact, the problem with Boustan is that it offers nothing more than the Lebanese shops you would find in a mall's food court in Montreal. The variety and quality is exactly as such so why take time to go there when you can just go to mall close to your neighbourhood.One thing they do better than say Amir or Basha is their falafels, I must admit. I was happily surprised that it didn't taste like coriander-soaked sand, which seems to be staple at many other fast-food-like Lebanese places. All in all: it is not bad, but it is not good either."

It wasn't warm enough though - some part were still ""cold"". That was pretty much the biggest down point in my opinion. Other than that, for a quick meal, I think it is a good place to go. The service is quick despite the lineup. I reheated again at home, and I actually better enjoyed the food."

This comes in a thin pita that's more like a rough wrap and is accompanied by some cabbage, pickled something red, maybe beets and a light garlic type of white sauce. It was thin enough to manage but more than enough and left a nice drizzle of grease running down my arm, always a sign of a finger lickin good gyro. Thanks Yelp for pointing me in the direction of Boustan, Montreal.......PS I wound up eating a second one a few hours later....always a sign of an amazing pita."
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I ordered delivery as I normally do from Boustan since it's one of the few restaurants in Montréal that actually does a decent and not overpriced delivery service. Also, the actual location is not that impressive ambience-wise, and I'm admittedly a bit too lazy to travel almost 1.5 miles by foot just for something that I'm so used to eating during late-night study sessions. I got a chicken brochette platter with a Pepsi as it's been proven to be quite a solid option in the past. The chicken was flavorful and seasoned as usual, and it goes really well with the hummus and vegetables when you eat them all together with the pita. I've always liked the pickled turnips that they put in the vegetable mix, as it has a tart flavor and adds color to everything. The garlic potatoes are always savory and provides a nice contrast between creaminess and the crispiness of the potato skin. Also, I'm not sure what they put in the rice, but it tastes really good and filling nonetheless!If you live within the area in which Boustan delivers, order it next time you have the late-night drunk munchies or are too stressed to cook - it's worth the price you pay and they give you a lot of food! It may get repetitive if you eat it too often, but somehow the cravings for it still manage to come back, so eat it sparingly."

I can definitely say that that's true. When I got in around 11 AM to have an early lunch, the guy at the counter greeted me and asked what I'm in the mood for. I said it's my first time and asked him what he recommends. He then asked if I'm too hungry and I said I'm just kinda hungry. He suggested the chicken brochette pita. I ordered the trio which comes with a side, a potato in my case, and soda. I paid ~$9 and was asked to wait at the table. A few minutes later, my pita was ready. It was fresh right off the grill and it tasted so good. I love how the wrap is toasted enough that it smells amazing but not too burnt that it tastes bitter. The chicken was also very tender and vegetables and spices all mixed very well. They open up at 11 AM on weekdays. If you wanna pay less than $10 for lunch and you're looking for a Lebanese cuisine, this is definitely the place for it. There's also a huge HDTV inside which at that time was on sports channel so extra points for entertainment."

I recommend the Chicken Shawarma with everything and a bit of hot sauce. Garlic potatoes were also a great side dish to go along with it. It is at an extremely convenient location - at the busiest section of Montreal's bar district. However, do plan your visit ahead, and don't go during a weekend night past midnight unless you are really craving for a good Shawarma, or would like to stand in line with people who are rowdy, and potential under the influence. Here's a true story, one time my friend almost got in a fight, when he was standing up to tell the person to be quiet as it got to a point when it was disturbing others. Overall, it's a Montreal-must-visit. If you are ever having a night-snack craving, or want to experience what's it like to have Shawarma with a bunch of rowdy folks, it can be a fun experience but be expected to wait in line for at least 30 minutes.Fun note: There's a photo near the check-out of both Pierre and Justin Trudeau visiting this restaurant at some point.

The service is fast, you can thankfully sit and eat if you don't want to leave. From the outside, it looks like a small hole-in-the-wall a la Chez Danny style but there are a few tables constantly vacant since most of their clientele are students that have to get back to Concordia for their following class.The selection is quite typical of Lebanese restaurants. Shish-taouk, Shawarma, garlic potatoes, etc. (You know the drill if you are from Montreal). Nonetheless, the food is still quite good and well worth the price.One thing that I'd warn against: their shish-taouk sandwiches are pretty greasy. My Lebanese friend, who probably knows every single Lebanese restaurant in Montreal, also noticed the same and called Boustan ""inferior"" and told me ""they lost the way of the holy pita sandwiches"". Don't hold it up too long or the grease will fall through the paper. I had to clean up a mess on the 8th floor of Hall because of that.It's quite typical and nothing to really gouge your eyes about.

The taste was good, and pretty traditional ( coming from a guy that spent most of his life in the Middle East) It was really quite affordable, tasty, and the order came on time at a late hour of the night.

I have no idea when this place closes or if it does because I think we were there quite late/ early in the morning. The line went right out the door it was so popular, but the people there are super efficient and the line moved quite quickly. They have pictures of famous people who have visited posted on the walls to give you something to look at while waiting which also makes it seem less long.

The shawarma combo comes with rice and potatoes, chicken and beef as well as garlic and hummus so it's like the whole nice yards with Pita. The food was really good and was extremely close to what a shawarma should taste like. Both were really filling for two people, there is a spicy sauce option for the shawarma as well.

But as a visitor to Montreal I have to say the opinions must be colored by local charm and history.They got our order wrong, they took an hour to deliver just a few blocks down, and by the time it got here the pita bread was too wet and falling apart.How was the food?Well, the chicken shawarma we ordered did not arrive, so I don't know about that one. The beef was at least solid, although as noted, its pita had disintegrated from sitting around in a steamy bag for an hour. I took one bite of the potatoes and decided that was enough.Far from the extraordinary cuisine people say it is.. Currently the top review says a good shawarma is hard to find in LA. I don't really get that because the food at Boustan is very similar in recipe and quality to Zankou in California. Zankou has numerous LA locations and their prices are lower despite being in a more expensive city.I'm going back to my Poutine tour tomorrow."

Now Boustan, WOW!  Tonight, I ordered a beef shawarma trio (includes potatoes topped with garlic sauce and a pop) and a chicken shawarma (sandwich only).  Up until tonight, I sought to find the taste of shawarma that would equal those of my memory.  Today, Boustan's chicken and beef shawarmas entered the top ranks of the best shawarma that I've ever had!To top it off, the two Lebanese guys working the food line were so incredibly industrious...working at a sustained full-tilt pace.  I dig it, our society is growing ever complacent prefer to take it easy, not these guys.If I were Steve Ells (founder of Chipotle and judge/investor of America's Next Great Restaurant) or one of the angel investors on Dragon's Den, I'd put a Boustan in every major neighborhood."

As for their beef shawarma, if it's cooking on high flame, I always get it with tahini sauce on top. Otherwise, I wouldn't risk it.

Before the mirages started to kick in, I caved in to his demands for a ""Cheap"" place to eat and we decided to try Boustans after hearing nothing but good things from another friend of ours.After carefully analyzing the menu for all of 3 seconds, I decided to get a beef shawarma with garlic potatoes. The potatoes were pretty salty but the goodness from the heavens that is the garlic sauce made it all better. Taking my first bite from the shawarma I was impressed. I love the way it is grilled and the way the flavours from all the ingredients inside come together. Considering the fact that I finished my meal faster than it took to choose something from the menu (3 seconds remember?), I would say I really enjoyed it.Definitely recommend this place and want to try it in the wee hours of the night when I just need to hit that craving.

The grape leaves were great and were covered in a tangy, mayo-like sauce that was really good. The hummus was OK and the pita it came with was a little hard and dry, but this was the main downside. My falafel sandwich was pretty good. Not quite as good as my old favorite falafel stand in New York but still good. My wife really liked here Shish Tawook sandwich. Also it was really cheap.

We stumbled upon this place and decided to give it a shot. When it comes to the decor and cleanliness, it may be a bit questionable, since this place doesn't aim to impress but rather just feed those who want a fast or late night hungover meal. You have to place your oder at the counter like every other shawarma place, but the man taking my order reminded me of the 'soup nazi' form Seinfeld. He asked for your order and assembled the food in a very strict and uniform manner with no intention to smile. Let's just say that all the negatives were forgotten once I tasted my food. It actually beat every other over-priced meal I had throughout my week at Montréal! The shawarma was warm, hearty, and simply amazing.My mum got the falafel plate, and I have never seen a falafel plate with so much variety. They had potatoes, rice, pita, salads, taboulli, and so much more all in one plate.We also got the grape vines (dolmaldes), which were great too.For an affordable meal that will satisfy any craving, and right by all the lively clubs, restaurants and shopping, this place is a must-go for sure!"

The first time I came upon Boustan, I stayed because the food smells great and there was a long line. I am glad I stayed.The sandwiches are grilled and delicious. They are cheap for Montreal standards. One sandwich is the perfect size for my girlfriend, however, I would need two sandwiches or a plate. The sandwiches are wrapped in wax paper that's easy to open and hold.For the plates, definitely go for the chicken shawarma instead of beef. The chicken is hot off the rotating vertical spit, while beef is is not. You can try both by getting a combo plate or sandwich, with half chicken and half beef. There is a version where you get three meats I forgot what it's called, a classmate ordered one of those as a sandwich.When you order a plate the rice / potatoes are microwaved on a styrofoam plate, but I can forgive that due to how great it tastes. (With the unavoidable amount of second hand smoke in Montreal, the styrofoam plate is not a huge concern to me).Anyway, try to have it all dressed with all ingredients (I have it with no onions. In addition, one of the ingredients is a delicious garlic mayo, so if you got an interview, might want to hold the garlic sauce). For the plate I usually get chicken with half tomato rice and half potatoes. Definitely try the sandwich if you don't want microwave or styrofoam touching your food."

Also tried their chicken shwarma pita. The pita was toasted warm, crunchy on the outside, and soft inside. Their mix of veggies they throw in there definitely adds more life to that pita. One thing I didn't fancy was that they went overboard with their garlic mayo sauce. Wayyy too much of that in there, but you'd hate to ask for an amended version because the main guy here reminds you of the soup nazi. Like, this ain't BK, it would almost be rude to have it your way.

It is a cafeteria style set up where you go down the line and pay at the end. They have tables inside and tables outside that would be real nice on a summer day.

Known for it's delicious Lebanese food at low prices it's become legendary with the late night set partying up on Crescent and adjacent streets.  The Chicken Schwarma sandwich is probably the most popular item on the menu. A new location has opened up by St Catherines and St Denis I believe.

This downtown area is hustling and bustling around lunch time when people are out to grab a quick bite and go back to work / study. Boustan provides good bang for your buck with different combos of meat / veggie Lebanese food. I chose this spot because we were nearby and I thought my partner might enjoy their veggie plate - which she did. I got chicken shawarma wrap and sides of garlic potatoes and tabbouleh.  The entire bill was around 20$ with taxes. Everything was tasty - and I want to commend their menu pictures of every dish for being accurate.  Now for what I didn't like - the place is not very clean (floor, tables, etc.). There are no metal utensils and no real plates - you eat out of disposables with plastic utensils. I really liked seeing into the line from behind the glass when ordering - until I saw them cleaning it with a dirty rag that brushes against the food. The cashier was too occupied with her toddler to process my payment - what's the deal with bringing kids to the restaurant? Handling a kid playing on a dirty floor and then handling food... meh! In short - although not a big chain like Amir or Bashaa they pretty much serve the same food. The experience in this location was not great, and there is really nothing special to go back for unless you are right there, very hungry, and strapped for cash."

I found out a few hours later because we decided we want more Boustan after drinking far too much with the kiddies on Crescent.  Sober - this place is damned good.  Drunk - this place is ""fuuuugin' ammmazzzzing"".  And we were not the only fans - people were asking if they could take pictures with the man behind the mystical food, Mr. Boustan.  Being drunk, we got in on the action as well.  Funny dude - as he handed our food order over, he commented that he liked my friend but not me.  This was a bit of a shock for me -- I thought I was the 'cute' one.  Oh well.Despite being drunk, I actually had the presence of mind to grab a take out menu before leaving.  Skip forward to the next night - after stumbling back to the hotel after failing to find anything appetizing on the walk back from the bar.  I find a Boustan menu on the desk and I think to myself, ""Drunken Johnson - you magnificent sexy beast - you are a genius!""  Seriously, I'm so good that I scare myself sometimes.These guys deliver until 4AM.  I repeat... 4AM!  For free!  If they only delivered to Vancouver... hmmm...."

The beef was extremely dry and salty. The chicken was a bit better but salty as well. The potatoes were also very salty. I guess Montreal folks love salt. A friend's kofta/kefta was definitely better but I kept thinking to myself, any street meat in NYC is better than this - sad.The bread was a sad excuse of a pita and that weird tangy, mayo-y sauce was just....weird. The 2 different types of rice had minimal flavor and were dry. The best part of the plate was the hummus.I guess this food can be good if you're wasted and starving but otherwise, I'm hoping Montreal has significantly better culinary options to offer than this."

Their roasted potatoes with garlic sauce were pretty good. The falafel was dry, which is what I find with most falafel wraps.

Myself and another buddy decided to try it for dinner so we would actually remember how it was.Somewhat difficult to find as it's downstairs off the street, and the restaurant beside it had a terrace that camouflaged the sign. They had a few tables outside and I'm sure it would have been nice to sit on the terrace, but it was way too hot for that, so we sat inside. A significant drop in the scenery, the restaurant itself is very simple with cafeteria trays to be served on and a dozen or so tables to sit at. THE FOOD THOUGH, any negative prejudice that had been created prior to eating was immediately removed after the first bite of my Beef Schwarma and potatoes W garlic sauce. This was like an explosion of salty, sweet, and garlicy flavours all mixed together to make the best Schwarma I've ever had. This potatoes were soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside with a generous serving of garlic sauce on top, a little on the salty side, but none the less delicious. There Schwarma was also excellent, filled to the brim with all the good stuff. End of the day I will definitely go back, probably after a night out of drinking to make sure it's as good at 3am as it was at 6. Friendly service, good prices and great food!"

/user_details?userid=3mtMXh05NnMRwJeS6BfOHA,Andrew A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Best Shwarma in town.really I shouldn't have to say more than this, but for the sake of defending my position.....First Shwarma is a Lebanese dish, meat, often chicken or beef, cooked on a vertical spit over a vertical BBQ of sorts. The meat is shaved off the outsides of the spit as it cooks ensuring you always get crispy goodness. You can either have the meat on a plate with rice, potatoes and salad or as a pita sandwich, similar to a Donner, or souvlaki.What Boustan does differently than everywhere else, is to really grill the finished sandwich over a fire, toasting the pita, this gives a unique taste.

I don't usually write reviews but I was so taken back by the rudeness and arrogance of their sandwich maker. Outdoor area is dirty - filled with literally birds and bees. Good food in Montreal is a dime a dozen so good service and cleanliness is very important. I have a business myself and if my employees were to ever yell at paying customers I'd fire him/her on the spot. I personally will never return to this establishment.

Which is great for a late snack after knocking back a few. I had the beef shawarma trio and the bf had the chicken shawarma wrap. For six bucks, they give you a lot of food. The beef was delicious, tender and juicy. The flavors were amazing. Service is cafeteria style in that you line-up at the counter, put in your order and pick out your sides.

I ordered shawarma chicken and my friend got the trios. After trying kebab in Europe, the chicken and beef were nothing. Chicken was too dry with no flavour. I had to drink half bottle of pepsi go finish the shawarma. Staff there were nit friendly AT ALL. When I said I wanted all veggies but not onion, he spoke french to tease me and gave me lettuce only.(well I saw there were tomatoes, beet roots, many other veggies). The sauce for my shawarma was tasteless, I couldnt even tell if it was sour cream. Those kebabs in europe will at least give you mustard or bbq source.For my friend's beef, more or less the same as chicken, i.e taseless and dry. More importantly, the staff was really unfriendly. My friend didnt know that he had to stay in line to wait for the food. He was yelled by the staff (bold head,short white guy) and was told to stand right there and dont move. We were his customers and he should never yell at us. He even laughed at my friend with other regular customers after yelling. WHAT KIND OF SHITTY SERVICE IS THIS????????

I understand drinks are a big source of profit, and he was mad he wasn't getting that on this sale. I can overlook that.I got the kafta arayess and my wife got the chicken shawarma. All meat comes from a big pre-cut pile. Some items go on an open grill. Most items go into a microwave there in front of you. They're busy, and pre-cutting and nuking are fast. I can overlook that.I actually really enjoyed my sandwich. The meat was spiced well. The sauce was great. The beets tasted like they were past their prime, but nothing to detract from an overall decent meal. Despite the service, this was shaping up to be a 3-star experience... then we saw one of the men behind the counter pick up some of the pre-cut meat with his bare hands, eat it, lick his fingers, and continue preparing food.

The Kafta Arayess has just about made me forget the Shawarma for good.Only two things to keep an eye on: one, the overuse of garlic mayo - I'd argue to even just skip it given how good the hummus is - and two, that you'll need a very ""Quebecer-like"" voice to keep staff on-target if you need to custom order. You can request anything you like, but with orders coming fast and frequent don't expect yours to be anything more than cookie-cutter unless you keep an eye on it and speak up!Boustan has a lot of history and the food is honestly worth going for, so don't let the new management get you down.

Food is good, prices are reasonable, I had the Beef and Chicken Brochette and my husband had the Beef and Chicken Shawarma both of which included rice, garlic potatoes, salad, coleslaw, hummus, garlic sauce, hot peppers (optional), pickled radishes, and a pita bread each. The meal was very filling, it took me a while to finish it all. I don't know why people say the workers or whoever are rude, I feel the people who work there were very polite. But then everyone has different experiences. Will visit again if I'm ever in Montreal. Again hours are great! Open late...like late late."
/user_details?userid=YC26Hxn4Y5nusICywZXAnw,jay l.,"Arlington, VA",4 star rating,"authentic lebanese food that is fast and cheap.  i was a bit surprised that the chicken shawarma is more expensive than the beef, but on second inspection, they pack the pita with much more chicken than beef.  we loved the ""wetness"" of the shawarma with the cabbage and other pickled veggies.  the garlic potatoes were absolutely delicious, and we had hummus on top of it...yum, yum, yum.i would agree that the cleanliness and hygiene of the workers wasn't the best (they would handle food and the money without using gloves/washing hands), but what do expect for $5 sandwiches?when we went, the place was packed with what appeared to be college students from mcgill.  however, we were served very quickly."

We arrived in the city just past 10:00 pm, and quickly took a cab to rue Sainte-Catherine.  The cabbie suggested that we *not* go to Amir's, but instead go to, in his words,  ""the best middle eastern"" place in all of Montreal.We did, and he was right.. although I have no basis for comparison (at least with other places in Montreal).The chef owner was friendly, and seemed genuinely interested in ""taking care of us"". Three of our party were vegetarian (one of whom was vegan). He prepared a vegetarian wrap, sans falafel (which was served on the side with rice.. .great touch).I got the chicken shawarma plate. It was as good as any I have tasted (although the saurkraut and garlic yoghurt stole the show for me).Loved it so much that we went back the next day for more.Go for the food, stay for the service !"

The new owners are OK I guess, they're not as friendly and generous, but the food still tastes good, and way better than the Amir next door. This place is especially great since they're on Crescent street, so you can go try them out like 3 am after you're done partying, the food taste soo good when you're hammered lol. But they get really packed, and the place is small and doesnt look that great, but the food makes up for it. Give them a try!"
/user_details?userid=7FyHKCJqEL8803PnBvfTpQ,Novaya Z.,"Winnipeg, Canada",4 star rating,"We ordered the combo schwarma plate (chicken&beef) which came with rice, potatoes & garlic sauce, a cabbage salad, a couple pieces of pink marinated turnip, hummus & a pita.  All this was $9.50.  We also got a falafel trio (sandwich, drink, garlic potatoes)for about $6.  All very tasty food, potatoes have nice flavour, especially combined with the garlic sauce- actually everything tastes good with the garlic sauce... The meats were decent, although the BEST schwarmas we have had , have a better smoked/grilled flavour.  The cabbage salad was my favourite part- as it was slightly tart, very refreshing, and garlicky.  All in all, a tasty experience for the money- the line never shortened the whole time we were there- always 5-6 people waiting..."
/user_details?userid=qIDy9zJfCuqxy6A3exPe_w,Jeanne C.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,"Right in the heart of the rowdy party area of downtown, Boustan is GREAT lebanese food. Chicken and rice halal is the staple in NYC, but what I find is that Boustan offers quality and taste. Their falafel and chicken schwarma sandwiches come in a very thin pita, which is awesome and doesn't make you want to puke from being too full. At around 1am or so, the place had a decent number of patrons but wasn't packed at all. The wait was short and sweet. I heard the worker/owner tell a guy that he would give him a refund if he didn't think the sandwich was THE BEST IN THE WORLD. Now how can you not go here? I miss it already!"
/user_details?userid=Vc2yGx9UEikBZVENjS_cIQ,Alan M.,"Sainte-Anne-De-Bellevue, Canada",1 star rating,RATING ZERO for Boustan! Horrible delivery and phone order service! Never faced such rudeness on phone! The delivery boy and the owner were extremely rude and ill mannered. Clearly showed a lack of respect towards women. Reached a point at which I had to return the food. Awful experience...... Never going to order food again from this place!

/user_details?userid=3M6SotlAvbIaeSGxMZokIw,Raj M.,"Seattle, WA",2 star rating,"We ordered the shawarma plate & a sandwich here during lunch hour for around $13. The food was so-so considering there are a lot of middle-eastern options around the city. The lady at the counter was a pusher - quick to tell you what you ""should"" order. We also found the ambience a bit dingy for our taste."
