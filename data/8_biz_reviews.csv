/user_details?userid=wW72FaqNPv6pdBC6AUqvcA,Hilary K.,"Vaudreuil-Dorion, Canada",5 star rating,"Well this was a 1 1/2 month long waiting period to get a booking at this fine establishment.At last, we got our day reserved to try. We booked inside seating as weather in September is quite unpredictable but their terrace was marvellous. It was quite nippy tonight but they have these grandiose heaters on each table to keep you warm and forget the weather that's outside. It's super warm surprisingly. We settled for the inside seating and it was just as wonderful , loved the vibe. As you come in, the kitchen is right near the entrance so you're blasted with all these delicious flavours and scents.Service: exceptional ! They really cater to all your needs always at our service. The food came out super quickly.. and the waiter Mark is a Gem. He made sure all our requests were answered from start to finish.I enjoyed having our utensils switched after every meal wonderful service !Food: To DIEEEE FOR ! I had the Mediterranean Sea Bass and all I can say it was the best fish dish I have had ..in a super long time. The cook was Perfection .. and Screwing up fish is soooo easy to do but this was beyond perfection I was mesmerized.We had a few side dishes super deelish as well.. their cuisine is super unique as it's authentic Syrian food. Everything we ate here was beyond and whoever is the chef definitely needs to stay.If you're thinking on coming here I strongly suggest you plan ahead and book a month in advance as it was super difficult to get a reservation before then. They're always fully booked due to maximum capacity with all the covid stuff Nonetheless, it was quite a surprising treat! Definitely recommend it !"
/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",3 star rating,"I would give 4* for the food but the price is too expensive for what you get so have to give 3* for overall rating.The food actually taste pretty good overall and service was great. Our waiter was very attentive and when we asked for a wine suggestion to go with our meal, he recommended a very affordable bottle and didn't oversell us.They make their own pita bread in-house so they always arrive hot and fresh at your table.My friend and I opted to share a seabass for the main course. When asked about the price, the waiter said $78...ok fine. When the plate arrived, it was only 2 fish fillets. I expected for that price that they would have served me the entire fish to confirm that the fish was fresh and then removed the meat for us or something. Very disappointed...how would I know you didn't serve me frozen fish fillets?Also have to say that during the pandemic, I didn't see any social distancing of tables inside the restaurant so was also disappointed that the restaurant didn't take good precautions to keep customers safe.Food was good but not wow for the price. Service was very attentive so if you want to bring a date to a nice restaurant and don't mind paying $$$ than sure go there.Many have told me that there are plenty of restaurants with better food but much more affordable...now that I've been, I confirm!"
/user_details?userid=y1zfQdoyyKaSIjIW3jV0Wg,A M.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"Damas is really great but just that tad overpriced that makes it impossible to give 5 stars. Especially the lamb chops that are almost double the price as anywhere else in town.It's still an amazing restaurant, just a tad much. The wine list is also so-so, no standout bottles in the upper range and in the more normal ranges the most interesting wines are from Lebanon, the rest is not special. Again also overpriced.The food (all dishes) are really good, it's just a shame that the price range makes it so pretentious."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,"I've never eaten somewhere quite like this. The attention to detail, presentation, service, cleanliness, and overall experience is so intentional and purposeful. They genuinely have a great restaurant and they want you to have a great time. My family and I came here for my birthday and we opted for the tasting menu which has like 10 services. I can't even begin to tell you what we ate, but we ate so much we all wanted to die at the end of the meal. They kept serving us delicious meal after delicious meal, we had to take the last 2 services to go! If you're a fan of hummus, grilled meats, fish, cheese pastries, fattoush salad, and so on, this place will satisfy you and then some. Everyone is so polite and wonderful and patient. An absolute amazing experience here and I would recommend to anyone."
/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The food at Damas is every bit as good as it's rumored to be. This is not the kind of place that I would frequent as it's off the beaten path, it's fairly expensive and the service (while excellent) was missing the kind of personal touch that draws me back to my favorite places. We opted for the early seating (5:00) on a Saturday night which might have been a mistake as several crying babies interrupted an otherwise cool vibe, maybe a later seating would work better for me. Anyway, we opted for the smaller tasting menu ($95 per head with roughly 5 services) and passed on the wine pairing. The sommelier diplomatically steered me away from a potentially poor choice and suggested a nice Italian white. I was seated next to a table that opted for the wine pairing and the selections looked great so I will opt for that service if I return.As I mentioned, the food was great. The service started with a shared salad and 4 dips/spreads that featured a variety of textures and flavors. The seafood dishes were also great with a crisp skinned sea bass and large shrimps, both of which were cooked perfectly. The meat dishes featured lamb shoulder (too gamey for my taste), chicken skewers and a fantastic grilled steak over hummus. We were absolutely stuffed at the end and really couldn't finish.Total tab for two was about $400 including tax and tip."
/user_details?userid=rn2Xc64E2-FMyauKcOT0-Q,A N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I was invited to dinner and we had the tasting menu. Long before the COVID, I have to say it has a lovely ambiance. Staff are superb and the restaurant is lovely and quaint. The food is lovely and tasty with all the different spices and varieties of vegetables and meat. We had non alcoholic cocktails! However it is quite pricey. For a group of 4 partners had wine it was over $400 . So be prepared to pay for what your getting .. not somewhere where I would frequent but it certainly was an experience."
/user_details?userid=c4lTZbA8NeZBgB1YYB6Izg,Julie C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Our first dinner out after the pandemic! It was fabulous. It was my partner and my first visit to Damas (a beautiful "" hidden gem "" in Outremont). Beautiful atmosphere and we loved how they added more trees/plants indoors to help with the COVID-19 spacing; very classy and efficient!We were advised to not go with the prix fix menu by some friends and I don't regret it. I think the prix fix menu is great since you get to try more variety but it is a bit on the pricier side. We had the fattouch salad, mouhammara, labneh zaater and the beet zabbal to start and shared the Mnazlé which is lamb stuffed eggplant with pinenuts and tomato sauce. Personally I loved the beet zabbal and absolutely adored the lamb stuffed eggplant. I'd order these two on my next visit and would like to try other items on the menu as well.Price was a bit high but we were absolutely *stuffed* and the flavour of each bite and the portion size was quite generous. I would most likely return. Atmosphere 4.5/5Service 4/5Food / quality 5/5Value / price 3.5/5Overall: 4/5"
/user_details?userid=iVXISIgh-unsJz57-qOHTQ,Sheryl L.,"Candiac, Canada",4 star rating,"I've heard a lot of good things about this place and I was even more excited to taste it because I've never had Syrian food before. As you enter you feel like you're being transported into the Syrian culture, beautiful chandeliers the patterns on the wall and even the bathroom was beautifully done.For the entrees we ordered the Pastirma,which is cured beef filet mignon,aged sheep milk with a fried quail egg on top. I absolutely Loved it. The saltiness from the beef and the soft Pitta it rested on with the garlic sauce was phenomenal!We also ordered the Qredes: Argentinian jumbo shrimps with tomato salsa and tarator sauce. You can thé shrimps grilled  or fried we chose grilled. Good size shrimp but I was disappointed with this overall dish. It was very oily, the shrimps tasted a little off. For the main course we got the shish kabab and the shish taouk. The shish kabab beef was very tender and cooked to perfection. The eggplant salad was a little bland but eating it with the other things on the plate compensated for the taste. The Shish taouk chicken and fries were very well seasoned. I very much enjoyed the  garlic sauce it came with. Its similar to what you would get at Amir but more fresh and zesty. I asked for bread so I can make my own wrap,since it wasn't offered to me like the table infront of me.But I think for the future, it's maybe something they can ask people if they want bread along with the shish taouk plate. Overall my  favourite dish was the Pastirma and the least favourite were the shrimps it just completely missed the mark. The service was good, food came in a timely matter. One thing i really liked was when the waiters brought out the food they took a few minutes to explain what was on the dish."
/user_details?userid=bmQLuo8TXU0sm7ttBn77Aw,Drew K.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"An absolutely mind blowing culinary experience. Fantastic environment. Superb service. This place is hopping and congrats to them. They have nailed this one. Made reservation for Friday night on Monday. Only 930pm was available.Good sign. Yes, I was completely loaded from the beginning of the dinner till the end. Like super duper high. But I digress....We tried the tasters menu. Every morsel of food, from the Fattoush salad to the plum dessert, was delectable.The fish and the meats section were mouth watering and oh my fucking god pants wetting.The Kibbe and Falafel were perfect. We had lots of cocktails, which were good, and the bill was $400 after tax n tip. Yup, it's one of them and it's worth every fucking dime. This might be one of the best restaurants I've ever been to - everything was just flawless. I cannot wait to go back."
/user_details?userid=2Egv8FVBX-uqsZEsko-Xvw,Joyce L.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"The best part about my montreal trip this year was being able to try out Damas restaurant ! Ordered the dry aged steak, Pastrima, and Samke Herra (sea bass). After a few disappointing restaurants tried out I seriously gave up on any expectations while eating in Montreal, At my lowest point of expectations Damas brought it right back up!  To one of the tastiest old fashions I've had in awhile, to one of the best steaks I've ever had! The sea bass was also a nice touch, but the Pastrima was a little underwhelming. We had the perfect amount of food and left super content! The server payed attention to detail and noticed that I was wandering off to look for the washroom and even guided me to it. When we got the bill he noticed the drink was barely touched since I was super full. He asked whether or not I was unsatisfied with the old fashioned? Even though I said it was great he still took it off our tab. He went above and beyond for us and the food was mouth watering! If I ever go back to Montreal I'll always stop back at Damas for some delicious food!"
/user_details?userid=mBUW9pLyf1fa3NyVJPtNMg,Steven Z.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"This was my first meal when I landed in Montreal and holy smokes, what an experience! You get the entire kitchen sink thrown at you when you order the tasting menu - 12(ish) delicious courses! The cocktails are amazing as well, definitely recommend getting at least one! Most of the dishes were super delicious, some were better than others. My favorite was the lamb chop, it felt like you can rip the meat right off the bone! The service was exceptional, waiters and waitresses were very friendly and accommodating.This was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had and anyone who is in the Montreal area needs to try it! You will not be disappointed (or hungry)!DRESS CODE: Most people dress up (collar shirt, slacks for men) but there is no dress code enforced. I walked in with a t-shirt, jeans, and nice sneakers and they did not even bat an eye!"
/user_details?userid=EOajY1L3ole3gLTCZ2xw1g,Jack M.,"West Chester, PA",5 star rating,"This was an incredible meal with well-ideated flavor combinations, wide-ranging thematic representation of Syrian cuisine, and expert execution of quality ingredients. I ordered the tasting menu and they accommodated graciously for me as a single diner (the menu is primarily designed to be shared).The meal starts with some olives which really aren't that great. I suppose they are a crudité to cleanse the palate. After the olives, things were amazing.First, there was a bowl of greens, crunchy radish, and vinaigrette. The dish was well balanced in flavor and texture. And it was massive. There was then a beef tartare that was insanely smooth and accented with Syrian smoky spices. There was a fried cheese taster that has super crisp on the exterior and a savory cheesy oily inside. Incredible.The falafel was good. Same with the eggplant. The rounds of seafood and meat were all interestingly flavored and well executed. There are too many specific flavors to remember. Their chicken kebabs marinated in yogurt were super tender, juicy, and smoky. The cheesy dessert was unique, and quite delicious. It was just sweet enough."
/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Finally got around writing my review for this AMAZING place. Located in the neighbourhood of Outremont, this place is definitively a must-try restaurant, wether you are a local Montrealer or just visiting. I went there on a weekday evening. Prior, we reserved a table about 1.5 hour before the expected time of dinner and did not have any problem.Once in the restaurant, you are welcomed with very nice decor around the restaurant, with dim lights during dinner time which creates a nice atmosphere. The staff there was also very courteous and helpful with the choices of food. As I went there with a friend with Middle Eastern origin, we both had very high expectations all we have heard. Fortunately, we were not disappointed at all. We decided on the tasting menu, which was worth every penny. It was a 5 course meal, with all meals tapas sized. We must have been served more than a dozen different foods throughout the night, and as we thought it couldn't get better, it KEPT GETTING BETTER. It was truly a real trip and will not go in too many details about the food itself because I could write a full book about it. So please do yourself a favour and go there and try it this amazing restaurant. In the meantime, I will be attaching some pictures to stimulate your appetite."

But I am literally so happy I did. First of all.. THE DECOR. Um hello! Its beyond gorgeous , you Instantly feel like you're in Morocco the energy in this place is simply incredible! The staff.. I honestly loved the interaction with our waiter and honestly anyone who came to serve us , they knew their shit to the T! Even the manager was beyond incredible his wife is actually chef de partie and we got to meet her as well! Just the loveliest couple and the dynamic of working in the back of the house and the front is just perfect. We took the tasting menu - obviously. EVERYTHING was perfect. Delicious and these flavors are out of this world. Everything just combines so perfectly.. I need to go back! Craving basically everything I had. I was so overwhelmed by the food that I actually forgot to continue to take pictures and I think that says alot! Damas .. you're the best."

I loved the use of mint, nuts, pomegranate seeds, dill, lemon, yogurt, and hummus throughout the dishes we tried.This restaurant is top notch- from the hostess to the wait staff to the line, sous and head chefs. It was a treat to sit at the bar and watch some of the dishes as they were assembled. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and the ambiance lively and welcoming.  This is a great place for special occasions or date night.We were so impressed with our new find that we are looking for Syrian restaurants in our hometown to try when we return.Highly recommend!!"
/user_details?userid=M7vDDzoPNQDN2FdTcwCq4A,Eric W.,"Hartford, CT",5 star rating,"A coworker of mine found this place and so, here we are!  I've never had Syrian food before so I was very excited to try it!  We had to make reservations a couple of weeks in advance because of how popular it was.  I mean, I have never seen a restaurant maintain a perfect 5-star rating through 312 reviews.  That's incredible.  I'm going to tell you why I enjoyed it here...Atmosphere/Appearance: This place is NNNIIICCCEEE! Set right on the corner of Avenue Van Horne and Avenue Bloomfield is this gem.  There is no private parking, so good luck finding spots on the street.  The inside it gorgeous.  It's decorated so well.  Each room has it own theme and it's so cool.  There are multiple bars you can pop a squat at in case you decide to show up without a reservation.  Lol.  We sat on the eastern side of the restaurant near one of the bars at a high top and chilled out.Service: Claudia was our server and she was excellent.  She was quick, thorough, fun and just made our experience very enjoyable.Food: So the 3 of us each grabbed an appetizer to share among one another before getting our main entree.  First was the traditional hummus.  It's served with 3 fluffy pieces of bread and was so delicious.  Next up was the Pastirma, which is cured beef filet mignon, aged sheep milk cheese and topped with e fried quail egg.  It was quite the mixture of ingredients, but they come together SO WELL.  It was very good.  The last appetizer was the Shish Borek, which are lamb dumplings, coriander yogurt sauce, Aleppo pepper butter and caramelized onions.  It was a bit messy, but again, delectable.  They just cant go wrong here!  For my entree I was eyeing the Fattet Mozat, which is lamb shank from Alberta, Canada, with shoulder rice, in Tahini yogurt sauce, a crispy pita, pistachios, cashews and ghee.  Such an interesting mix of ingredients, but like everything else... they go together so well.  The meat was so tender, seasoned well and the sides complemented it so well.  I cannot speak highly enough of the food here.Value: All prices in $CAD.  Not cheap at all, but you're paying for quality and not quantity here.  The hummus was $10.00, the Shish Borek was $$25.50 and the Pastirma was $21.00.  Prices seemed to have gone up quite a bit since I've been (according to the website), but oh well.  My entree was $41.00, but now it's listed at $46.00.  Sheesh... quite the jump for only a few months, back.  Oh well, I'm glad I came when I did!In conclusion I'd surely return here, even with the price inflation, but it is what it is."
/user_details?userid=IMHvG_ysz6akYIM-GO18kg,Andrea D.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow! Amazing first experience trying Syrian food. We started with cocktails (Aleppo gin sour was 10/10) and a plate of hummus (10/10). Mains were shish kabob and friki, both very flavourful and perfect to share ! Too full to try the desserts. Terrasse seating was spacious and relaxed. Would definitely recommend. Prices on the higher side but the experience was worth it."
/user_details?userid=Fn15PJC1yZa3okA68s1dKg,Russ B.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Let's make things very clear from the beginning. This place does NOT offer delivery unless you're ordering a bare minimum of $150 worth of food. When I asked if they would charge me a delivery fee for a smaller order, I was told to take an Uber to the restaurant, as this was something other customers typically do. What kind of ridiculous policy is that? What if I just wanted to order dinner for 2 people? You expect me to spend $30+ on Uber rides just to pick up my shawarma? Such an inefficient and unnecessarily expensive way of doing things for the consumer. Literally any other restaurant in the world offers delivery on almost all orders. What's especially surprising is that even though I was willing to pay for delivery, that still wasn't good enough for them. Basically, their policy is pick-up only unless you're willing to buy a week's worth of food. Don't like it? Too bad. This place must be doing very well if they're willing to turn away an order in the middle of a pandemic. Any normal restaurant would happily accept the business and be willing to deliver. The owner is clearly stuck in the past, and doesn't understand what a reasonable restaurant's business model looks like in the 21st century."
/user_details?userid=JXfUPmN87P2TEpM3utgdqg,Andrew K.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"Have heard a lot about this restaurant and it for the most part lives up to the hype. The restaurant is large and accommodates a large party quite well. If the party is over a certain amount of guests they require you order the tasting menu which is what we did. We did the larger tasting menu which included a couple of seafood dishes. This included a lobster dish that was quite tasty. The beef and lamb dishes were excellent as well and the hummus was on point. We ended the night with some excellent house saffron tea that is definitely recommended. The service was also excellent. We stayed for four hours for the tasting menu and took our sweet time and never felt rushed at all. Overall while I cannot comment on their a la carte menu, the meal was an outstanding experience with great flavors and service."

/user_details?userid=NNZITPgAMRppxLD1npwmgQ,Kriti C.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",5 star rating,"Beautiful decor, stunning food and amazing service. With all this going on, it's hard to complain about the price - it's so well deserved. This was the first time I tried a hummus that was so different than the chick-pea paste most places have. With all the different nuts; pistachios, cashews, and even some walnuts, it was burst of flavours. The Lamb Dumplings tasted very close to Indian Chaat with ingredients like Ghee, yogurt and cumin. It was a surprising combination of a traditionally Asian cuisine with a middle eastern twist.Fab, fresh and filling pitas to top everything off and made this a delightful dinner."
/user_details?userid=65kdUhcdbgCqc0tvfK56Eg,Jessica S.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Dang the food at Damas really lives up to the hype! We came here on a Tuesday night and it was our first meal in Montreal. We didn't want to miss out at all so we got the 12 plate taster menu (there is a 15 course but we worried we wouldn't be able to eat it all) and it was amazing!!Everything was extremely flavourful and tasty - we had the whole gambit with seafood (sea bass, shrimp) and plates of meat (omg their steak, OMG THE LAMB), their famous fattoush salad with over 50 ingredients, unlimited fresh pita, and topped off with a lovely light caramelized fruit dessert. There were so many dishes I really can't list them all here - but you seriously need to come here and try them all. Each was a treat in itself - and we were bursting at the seams at the end!The service was also amazing - our servers were super attentive, our water glasses were never empty and they explained each dish with care and some real honest love for what the restaurant serves. I didn't enjoy the cocktails that much - for $15 a piece I expect to love my cocktail but they were both meh at best (sour cherry bourbon and gin fizz). But with the food being so good, Damas is still a solid 5/5.It's on the pricier end, sure, but well worth the money (minus the cocktails). Highly recommend!!!!!"

/user_details?userid=WXOPvu53iSgej-w_0tnbSg,Grace Y.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"This restaurant is very good. We made a reservation for my boyfriend's birthday when we were in town, and we were seated at the bar, which was not the most ideal but not that bad either. My boyfriend got the rack of lamb ($62). It was pricey but also very large, with EIGHT lamb chops, roasted veggies, and baba ganoush. We also got an order of baba ganoush which my boyfriend really enjoyed. The pita pockets that came with it were nicely warm and chewy. I got the filet mignon kebab without sauce due to my onion/garlic intolerance and it was wonderfully seasoned and perfectly cooked, albeit a little not hot enough. Our waitress was very nice. We enjoyed our meal here. With cocktails we spent about $200."
/user_details?userid=xk9CWV8i_QHlI0YPQn6zvQ,Alicia P.,"Georgetown, Washington, DC",5 star rating,"Damas is the French way of pronouncing and spelling what we call in English, Damascus, the capital of Syria. I was excited to try the Syrian cuisine in Montreal, especially given the raving reviews.When we arrived, we were led to our table towards the back of the restaurant.  Each room was decorated a bit differently, but all beautiful & themed.  Our waiter described it as being similar to how royal palaces were decorated in Syria. It was a lovely ambiance!Syrian food, is similar to other middle eastern food in that it is mostly shared dishes, focuses on appetizers like dips and salads, and has complex tastes.  We ordered muhammara (red pepper dip), baba ghanoush (both the Syrian style, which is a salad - a revelation- and the more well-known dip version), grilled octopus, fattouche, pita bread, and a steak aged for 60 days...needless to say, we were in absolute heaven. The flavors were incredible! Our waiter was very helpful in walking us through the best dishes to order, and he did not disappoint! Out of all the places we ate on our trip to Montreal, this was by far my favorite restaurant and a place you will not want to miss."

/user_details?userid=vTsbejwscDEdA3Ao_aIQMg,Lawrie S.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Definitely worth the price! There is a reason this restaurant is always fully booked and make sure you reserve in advance unless you want a reservation at 4:30 or 9pm (in which case I would still suggest you go).Service was excellent and they were very accommodating to all dietary restrictions, even when we opted for the tasting menu which allows you to try 12-15 courses for $95 a person. Although they have multiple seatings a night we did not feel rushed at all. They also have a sommelier available to help you with your choice of wine accompaniment. The tasting menu will allow you to try a little bit of everything but be prepared for a lot of meat (also about 4 lamb dishes so if this isn't one of your favourites mention it to the waiter although they cook it quite well with all the spices). If not, we highly recommend the fattouch salad, mouhammara, kibbe nayye, pastrima, tatar borek, qredes and the shish taouk! Show up hungry and ready to share!"

If I could give this place more than five stars, I would.We had the $85 tasting menu and it was worth every single penny. The food consisted of 15 courses covering appetizers, entrees and desert.We had outstanding beet hummus, beef tartare, a citrus salad, Falafel with tahini, a perfectly cooked fish, shrimp skewers, octopus (perhaps a little more chewy than I'd like, my only complaint), chicken in a garlic sauce, succulent lamb chops, a bean salad, another meat dish and an assortment of baklava deserts. Three hours later, we needed to be rolled out of the place!Seriously, do not miss this outstanding meal. Do the tasting menu. Give yourselves three hours of time.

We had the fettouche salad (excellent) and hummos appetizer (hot fresh pita bread)!  The grilled shrimp was also excellent. Excellent cocktails and - the highlight - Syrian wine. I have had other middle eastern wines and am always looking to try wine from the local region. It was great to be able to try some from Syria, especially given how much turmoil the country has been in over the last many, many years. Our server was attentive and incredibly kind, allowing us to linger well until the second seating without us feeling like we were being shooed out.

I stopped by with two friends with the only time slot we could snag for a reservation, at 9:30 PM on a Sunday evening, and despite the late start, it was definitely worth it. We split the fattoush salad, the hummus platter, along with the pastirma, all of which were outstanding, particularly the salad and the pastirma. The pitas were warm and fresh (and unlimited, don't be afraid to ask for more!) as well. Our entrees were two lamb dishes, a lamb rack and a lamb in eggplant dish, both of which were excellently prepared and very different dishes.Our server, Ben, was very helpful throughout, describing and suggest items throughout the meal, along with a complimentary ginger shot at the end of the meal. This is absolutely a place to visit while in Montreal, and I would definitely come back."

From the decor to the ingredients, everything is orchestrated to create an unique experience. The service is impeccable; probably one of the finest in Montreal. Try the tasting menu, it might be the best deal to get the most out of the Damas experience. Otherwise, keep in mind that your bill will add up pretty quickly, and up might end up with a empty stomach and empty wallet."

/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We four people came here for dinner on a long weekend Sunday. I made the reservation two weeks in advance and only got 4:00pm and 9:00pm time slots left. We were warmly greeted when we entered. The table set menu is 95$ for each person, under the condition that everyone on table would have it. We were not so hungry so we went with a la carte choice. We had 5 cold mezze(30$), beef tartare(22$) Kibbeh, one grill mix for two, a sea bass(MP). These were three appetizers and three portions of main dishes. There were enough food for four people. I am glad we didn't go with the table set menu. We like all the dishes we ordered. The baba salad included in 5 cold mezze is with eggplant. It has a smoky taste. This dish was my husbands' favourite. Beef tartare has four pieces, with nuts and mint leaves. I like the taste very much. Grill mix for two offers four kinds of meat. The chicken was definitely a surprise and the lamb chop was heavenly good. The filet mignon was just OK. The fish also came with a lot of the nuts and a bed of sauce beneath.  The fish skin was crispy which was unique among other fish cuisine. Our waiter recommended to eat the skin. We paid about 85$ (tax tips included) each person. We like all the dishes we had, and they were good for sharing so we can taste more. It's also economic.  Will definitely come back."

/user_details?userid=m2JpS4Yjpy_nget3UwUaCA,Megan K.,"Santa Rosa, CA",5 star rating,"Phenomenal  Syrian tasting menu. Excellent cocktails. This was by far the lightest  tasting menu while in Montreal and worth every dime. The highlight was the 12 ingredient purslane fattoush. This is something you can't get anywhere else in the world, they have their own purslane purveyor that grows a type of purslane i personally have never tasted. It was the texture, flavor and visual of that fattoush that added to every course. The service was exceptional, our server had grace and felt comfortable explaining every component of every dish with passion. For 75$ American it's truly a steal and a generous amount of food.  As a large city that is ecstatic about different food and culture, it was a real treat to see the best of what Montreal has to offer. Even my boyfriend who isn't big on middle eastern food  thoroughly enjoyed the food and ambiance."
/user_details?userid=NDpDbLel51kGekwWhdhb9Q,Natasha R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"My husband & I have been repeatedly told by friends to try Damas, which is a Montreal staple for Syrian cuisine.  So we were very excited to go there this weekend for our date night. The maître d was very warm and staff friendly. The decor was exotic and nice. The place is huge which lead to it not having a very personal or cozy vibe. We decided to start with cocktails--he had a bourbon sour cherry fizz & I had a ginger rose fizz. Both were beautiful & delicious. We then decided to do the chef's tasting menu ($95/person)  since we couldn't decide what to order. Service 1: Beef tartare for my husband & eggplant tartare w pomegranate for me since I don't eat beef tartare with a salad & a fried cheese dumpling . This was solid fare, but very filling and nothing really stood out to either of us. The eggplant tartare was very interesting & tasty. The salad was ok. Service 2: Falafels with mint and spiced yogurt & beef strips with some hummus and fresh pita. These were delicious. The falafel was the best I've ever had. So we were starting to get optimistic...Service 3: Seafood - grilled octopus;grilled white fish; spicy grilled shrimp; lobster tails. Though this should've blown us away, we both felt these dishes were rather boring. We are seafood fans so this left us very disappointed. Plus by now we were stuffed to the limits. So when Service 4 (lamb chops & grilled chicken) arrived we asked to pack it up, which they did. We had it the next day & The lamb was as amazing. If we ever return here it'd be for the falafel & lamb. Dessert was forgettable...semolina wrapped around ricotta with honey, pistachios & orange blossom water. Not my cup of tea. The texture was too mushy and sticky and there was little flavour. We had 2 wines after our cocktails to keep pace w the endless trail of food. Total w tax was nearly $400. Overall a good but not great experience."

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Last week, I finally found myself at Damas. Yeah... I know. How could someone who enjoys so much the Montreal restaurant scene have never been to Damas before? I have no good answer really... neglect? Circumstances? I will admit that Syrian cuisine is not something that all my dining friends enjoy so that may have played a part but regardless, I finally entered Damas ready to see if the praise is well earned.Located in Outremont on Van Horne, Damas is a high-end sit-down Syrian restaurant. The space is very warm and welcoming despite its large size and multiple rooms. Lots of colour, patterned tiles and interesting lighting. The space was noisy enough which is understandable given how busy the room was. Service was sharp throughout the evening.If you enjoy more casual middle eastern cuisine, you will recognize some of the flavours here but this is a whole different level. First up was the Fattouch salad - a beautiful salad of crispy pita, lettuce, various vegetables and herbs. Very nice mix with the crunch of the pitas and the fresh veggies. I loved the addition of the pomegranate seeds for a touch of sweetness. The vinaigrette was subtle but a little balance of oil and acidity.We then had a platter of 4 different dips with bread - hummus, mouhammara, eggplant mutabbal and beet mutabbal. All four were excellent - classic creamy hummus, the sweet heat of the mouhammara and the lovely notes of beet and eggplant in the mutabbals. Perfect entry point for the meal.Our final appetizer was one I really wanted to try once I read the description: Shish Borek - lamb dumplings served with coriander yogourt sauce, aleppo pepper butter and caramelized onions. The dumpling themselves were quite good - lovely gamey lamb flavour. The yogourt sauce, while being pretty thin, still brought a nice creaminess with a touch of spiciness to pair with the lamb. The sweetness of the onions mix well also.At this point, we were already pretty stuffed but had already ordered one main dish each. Frankly, we could have done with only 2 to share amongst the four of us given the portion sizes!First was the Damas Shish Taouk - chicken breast served with picked vegetables, sumac fries, garlic mayo and house orange ketchup. Good char on the chicken. Compared to the rest of the dishes, it lacked some punch flavour-wise. The fries were good and of course love the garlic sauce!Next dish was the Fattet Mozat - Alberta Lamb shank and shoulder served with rice, tahini yogurt sauce, crispy pita, pistachios, cashews and ghee. An amazing dish - the lamb just fell off the bone cleanly. Very flavourful and tender. Tons of flavours through the sauce - some richness, some heat, some sweet. Everything to pair well with that lamb. I had some left for the next day and it was just as great the second time around.The third main was another lamb dish, the Fattet Makdous - eggplant stuffed with marinated lamb leg served with tahini yogourt, crispy pita, tomato sauce and pine nuts. Another excellent dish. More tender flavourful lamb but this time paired up with more acidity and earthiness with the eggplants and the tomato sauce. The yogourt brought some richness to counterbalance the acidity.Our final dish was Samak - mediterranean seabass served with walnuts, peppers, onions and tajin sauce. The fish was flaky and tender. Again tons of accent flavours through the sauce and the veggies. At this point, I wasn't hungry anymore but found a way to try it at least a bit!We left Damas happy and quite full. This is a restaurant that will hit your pocketbook but frankly, the quality of what you get and also the portions themselves is such that you will not leave disappointed. It took a long time to get to Damas but believe me, it won't take as long to come back.Cheers!"
/user_details?userid=XVP0dQV-BsXKzp2KN214dg,Jess C.,"Bethesda, MD",5 star rating,"My time in Montreal was limited, and we had time for one fine dining experience. After thorough research on yelp, I decided on Damas and was not disappointed. Montreal is known for its diverse population & I was very impressed with its Syrian cuisine at Damas. The interior was beautiful, but not stuffy. It was a great place to enjoy a family meal and perfect for foodies. Since we had an adult who does not eat that much we decided to a la carte. We ordered the four mezzo spread and added the labneh. Each spread was perfect.We also got the octopus and it also tasted amazing. I could have eaten the whole platter myself.We also had the Fattet Makdous 39 (Eggplant stuffed with lamb and nuts, tomato sauce, pita, yogurt and tahini sauce). That was probably the best value for quality. The dish was amazing. It reminded me of a blend between lasagna and moussaka. We finished with the Syrian sea bass which was pan fried to perfection.The service was 5 stars. Our waiter was very pleasant and helpful. The interior is also super cozy. The restaurant is in a cute residential neighborhood in Outremand, and I would not have expected such a delicious restaurant. I would only say that when they changed our cutlery, it felt like it was just being thrown down on the table without any proper order. Definitely make reservations. It is a very busy place, but the restaurant surprisingly has good sound insulation so it isn't too noisy to have conversations. There are different books in the restaurant, and if you have a larger group, perhaps request a window round table.I love this place! Would definitely go back to try their tasting menu."

I saw Damas by chance when checking some foodie restaurants and decided to make a reservation before I left (you definitely need one this place fills up fast!) my original reservation was around 9:30pm on Sunday, I checked their hours and found they close at 10pm so I made it my quest to call them the moment they opened to try to get in earlier (it's just mean to come in 30 minutes before close). Luckily we got bar seats at 7pm! Let me start with the decor it was absolutely fantastic, gorgeous chandeliers and lanterns, tiled walls, dim sultry lights and a sitar playing in the background made the vibes perfect. The wait staff was phenomenal super helpful with suggestions and always there when you needed them. Let's get to the food. We started with the falafel salad and ordered a bit of pita to go with it. The falafel was dense moist and crispy on the outside in a fab hummus sauce with beets mint and other goodies. The pita was plump warm and delicious. We shared the shish taouk and shish kebab, tender steak, juicy flavorful chicken, amazing tahini. I had two cocktails the first fruity and playful was the apricot gimlet with rye whisky, the second an herbaceous earthy Aleppo gin sour. You absolutely MUST stop here if you have to opportunity."

Having had Mediterranean foods before, we weren't sure what Syrian food necessarily was. We decided to go with the tasting menu which was 86$ per person to get the full experience of what the menu had to offer. Every dish was filled with flavor and left us hungry for more. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, and just melted in our mouths. We had fun with the puffy pita bread that came with amazing hummus spreads. All the dishes including the beef tartare, falafel, the sea bass, the lamb, dumplings were just a party in our mouths. The service and ambiance was great and we were happily surprised to see ample seating filled up by the time we left at peak dinner time. Unfortunately, we are visitors from NJ and won't be back soon, but whether you're a local or are driving through Montreal, it is sure worth the visit!"

We made reservations about a month in advance because we knew that this place had such a great reputation. The servers were all really nice and helpful.I got a really refreshing cocktail called rose ginger fuzz and my boyfriend got a Canadian beer which he enjoyed. I think I mistakenly assumed that the dishes were going to be small, so we over-ordered a bit. We shared a hot and cold mezze (falafel salad and beef tartare), which were both amazing. The falafel salad also came with fresh pita bread, which was a wonderful addition.For main courses, I got the Moujadarra (lentils with bulgor and carmelized onions) and my boyfriend got the lamb kebab.

The shrimps that came out looked amazing- sadly we did not order that. Also order lamb dish stuffed with eggplants . Very flavorful!Drinks were unique and delicious.My favorite is the ice-cream baklava. Super creamy and not disgustingly sweet like most baklava. Wish it was a bigger portion. :(Decor and ambience spot on!Our waiter was also super cool and shared a shot with us at the end.
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"While not perfect, the food here is exceptional. Prices are quite high for what is essentially simple and hearty food. Nevertheless, the decor, presentation, and meticulous care that go into each dish are commendable.The menu had certain items that I absolutely wanted to try and I didn't want to leave it to chance by ordering the tasting menu. I feel we made the right choice. While my wife and I were feasting on a large plate of dumplings and shish taouk chicken with fries, our neighbouring table who were obviously making their way through the tasting menu, were being served dainty little dishes every 15 minutes with a single lamb lollipop or a microscopic piece of fish. They were taking such deliberate and distinguished little bites of their food before placing their utensils back on the table, furrowing their brows and discussing what they had just ate as though they were standing at an art exhibit. I'd rather focus on what I really enjoy rather than have a small bite of everything. It feels more like a meal that way. To each their own. Some people see eating as chore (for real!) A meal might be more about getting out of the house and socializing while there just happens to be food involved. Some folk might one day utter the words ""I forgot to eat lunch today"". Under regular circumstances, I cannot imagine what that is like. I'm not sure I'm even the same type of species as these people. To be fair, the tasting menu at Damas might include some larger dishes, but I didn't see any of those in the hour the neighbouring table's reservation overlapped with ours.I started with the bourbon and sour cherry cocktail which was really nice but for 15$, was gone in a few sips. I switched to a lebanese beer (Almaza) which was a good call and pairs really well with this salty and flavourful food. We ordered the fattoush salad which is probably big enough for 3 people. It is easily one of the best in the city. The toasted pita and pomegranate seeds are perfectly distributed in this chopped salad. Instead of plain hummus, we got the version covered with large juicy chunks of lamb which was the absolute perfect spread to mix with the salad on the homemade pita bread they serve. We also ordered the delicious beet spread which was slightly sweet and thick.It's easy to get full very quickly here, and ordering properly can be tricky, especially if you are going in on a completely empty stomach. For a middle course, we had the falafel and the lamb kibbe. Both of these fried dishes are passable, but not memorable. The best falafel I have ever had is served at Daou. I found these falafels at Damas to be packed a little too densely, not sufficiently moist inside (likely because they are quite small to begin with before they are fried), and not adequately seasoned. The accompanying sauces for both the falafel and kibbe were non-descript and added little to each dish. After having feasted earlier on the succulent lamb with hummus, the lamb kibbe with crumbs of dry lamb inside a breaded casing only disappointed and took up valuable real estate within my quickly diminishing appetite.We closed this epic meal with a pairing of the shish taouk, garlic sauce, and sumac fries along with an order of the lamb and yogurt dumplings. The chicken at Damas is excellent, and I see why people very quickly conclude that this is as good as it gets while doling out a 5 star rating. My problem is that I have eaten at Daou (lebanese) and Nostos (greek). I know just how perfect chicken can get. Damas' chicken is moist, but lacks a deep grilled flavour. It is also far too salty and can use a little more subtlety and depth in the marinade. The fries were not memorable in any way. Yeah, they are topped with sumac, but this is a city where I can get that at several restaurants, so the novelty factor alone isn't overly impressive. The quality of the potatoes and the frying process were not up to par.The lamb dumplings were served steamed in a light yogurt sauce, topped with fried onions. This dish is delicious, but could use a little sweetness to counterbalance the naturally sour flavour of the yogurt. We couldn't finish either of the last two dishes and took the remainder home with us.On the whole, Damas feels like a nice night out, which says a lot for an establishment. There are certainly many bright spots on the menu. Some items like the rack of lamb (62$), the rib steak (90$), and the mixed grill platter (110$) are prohibitively priced and for that reason, it's doubtful I would order them. Besides, if I just want to immerse myself in a pile of perfectly grilled meat with excellent fries and sides in a no frills environment, I'll go to Daou which is perfect for a Sunday night or dinner before catching a movie. Damas on the other hand is a more drawn out experience in a setting better suited for socializing. It's nice that Montrealers have different options when it comes to middle eastern food."

These were all amazing and honestly, at this point, I couldn't eat anymore.After that, there was also the dumplings, chicken, lamb rack, and lamb shoulder. The last few dishes we had to pack away due to the fact we were so full and the meal was so long in time. Lastly, there was a semolina cheese dessert that I thoroughly enjoyed, despite bursting at the seams. From a tasting menu, I'm impressed they really covered a big part of the menu. However, the amount of food covered two whole meals for me. I think if they served smaller portions and decreased the price, it would allow guests to experience the menu as a whole without having to compromise stomach space by cutting the meal short. In terms of value, this tasting menu is worth your money! It really adds up compared to their regular menu, and you can tell the ingredients are chosen from the very best. My only complaint is dishes are quite heavily seasoned so it's a lot of salt by the end of your meal. I guess my review was 4.5 rounded up to a five, and Damas has a constant flow of reviews already, but this review is something for my books."
/user_details?userid=41A6NfRlbNEHUawOKR3wOA,Mike M.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"Does the highest-rated restaurant in Montreal live up to the hype? The answer is a near-absolute YES. All the food ranged from good to stellar, with takes on dishes that felt like the best version of them that we have experienced. The service was impeccable and environment extremely welcoming. The one star deduction is for the pricing. I don't consider myself price sensitive but when a chicken skewer is $40, there is something to be said. Even so, it doesn't change the food quality and experience at Damas, which will definitely be on the list when we return to Montreal."

Perfect for any occasion if you love good food!Yes, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the food here. This was my 2nd time. BEST fattoush I've had in Montreal! The grilled octopus was amazing. The walnut-stuffed seabass had crispy skin (insert drooling emoji) and was so frigging delicious, I wished I could eat forever. Lol!!!I definitely recommend this place, take your parents, take your cousin, take your date, or just go and enjoy a nice meal by yourself, who cares, the food is so good you won't notice you're alone"

This restaurant starts with a very cool owner/manager, great approach and charming as all yay. Restaurant atmosphere is casual with a warm ambiance, not remotely pretentious. The food is where this Syrian gem takes off. They do a salad with crispy pita flakes this is simply off the charts. An explosion in your mouth of differentiated flavor, was actually my favorite dish. The hummus will ruin hummus for your life. So well crafted, again with excellent separation of tastes. We finished with lambs, steak and chicken. All cooked to perfection. Run don't walk. Great meal start to finish. We had a table of 10 and the service was timely and attentive. YUM!!!"

What better day to start my resolution than on my birthday. I just came back from Damas, and all I can say is that I am so happy I tried this place. First of all it is beautifully and taste fully decorated, it transports you in another country. The ambiance is very charming, the staff is extremely professional and courteous. The know the menu inside out and can give you great suggestions. Now let's talk about the main subject, the food, as appetizers we had the Damas Fattoush, the pureed eggplant and the octopus warm salad. The fattoush was so different than your typical fattoush, the put a twist on it and they brought   It to a whole other level. I have tried octopus before but don't like the fishy taste and smell to it. This dish was nothing I had tasted before, the seasoning was perfect, the dressing was so delicate and tasty, a must try.As a main dish I had the shish taouk, chicken so juicy it was accompanied but sumac fries. WOW! It had a sour garlic taste to it, it was fantastic. I had also ordered a side of yogurt salad which tasted like tsaziki but better.Last but not least for dessert I had menthe tea and a fried cheese that had a bit of rose water. ToBe honest i didn't know what to make of the desert, I am still thinking about it. You know when you eat something and you don't really know if you like it or not so you keep eating. That's what happened to me. This place is not just a place to go eat, it an experience. Prices are high but you get the quality to go with it."

The fattouch salad felt really fresh and crisp. The lamb hummus was simply amazing, and unlike what I was expecting, the taste of the lamb wasn't too strong. The meat platter was simply perfect.

Was really surprised that a place with so many reviews had 5 stars, but let me tell me, after dining at this place, it deserves every single star.Service:Service here was absolutely phenomenal. Our waiter treated us like family, not like a customer. He would make recommendations based on what we preferred and put us at ease by saying ""if you dont like it we'll switch it"". He recommended an amazing gin cocktail for us, and recommended some delicious dishes and even warned us not to fill ourselves up with pita so we'd have enough room for our main dish. Food:The food was to die for. We had an appetizer dish called mouhamarra (sp?) as well as hummus, and it was fantastic. Our main dishes were a half portion of sea bass(waiter offered us half portion option) and a seven spice rack of lambs. The meat was tender and perfectly cooked and the fish was amazing.

I made an Open Table reservation here for my birthday dinner and noted the reservation as a birthday reservation. Unfortunately, they did not do anything special to acknowledge but whatever, I'm over it.We started with the Four Cold Mezzes appetizer with their fresh naan bread. My husband is not a fan of eggplant but he loved the smoked eggplant dip and said that was his favorite of the four. I enjoyed the regular hummus which was just super creamy and seasoned perfectly.I had the Fattet Makdous for my entrée which is three small eggplants stuffed with ground lamb. The eggplants are nestled in a tomato sauce which is mixed with nuts, fried pita chips, and yogurt. This dish definitely had many layers of textures going on and is something that I would like to replicate in my own kitchen at home. It was very good and even held up as my leftovers. The husband had the Fattet Mozat which is lamb shank confit over rice, nuts, yogurt, and fried pita chips. He had no problems eating it all right there. We had to try dessert even though we could barely move at that point so we ordered the baklava sampler which came with four baklava bites of two different flavors and a side of orange blossom ice cream. Everything was delicious and I'm glad we tried the four different dips to start."

We truly enjoyed our visit, from the first spiced olives placed on the table to the last bites we stuffed into our expanding bellies.We shared the 4 cold mezzes appetizer, which included (clockwise from the top of the photo):  Traditional Hummus, Eggplant Mutabbal, Beet Mutabbal, and Mouhamarra. It was served with fresh pita bread which was hot from the oven. They were all fantastic and totally distinct, with my favorite tied between the mouhamarra and the beet mutabbal. I wouldn't hesitate to order this again. We then shared the Grilled Meat Platter for Two, which included lamb chops, beef tenderloin cubes, chicken cubes, lamb kabab, grilled pita, and a smoke egglplant salad on the side. The seasoning on every item made the natural flavors of the proteins pop, and it was truly satisfying. I also had a glass of Côtes de Provence Rosé, which was light and slighty fruity. I am by no means a wine expert, but it was quite complementary to the food, especially the mezzes.In essence, this is another spot I hope to return to, there are a number of items I would still love to try - perhaps one of the tasting menus next time."
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Location: Park Ex, on Van Horn. The easiest way to get here is to drive or take a cab. Street parking is available but metered on the main street, so check their hours of operation. You can probably find parking on the side streets - just make sure they're not zoned. The place: Quite lovely, actually. The decor is warm and inviting and, I'd say, representative of traditional Syrian decor. Now, bear in mind that I haven't been to Syria so perhaps my imagination needs a reboot.  The point is, I like it and for a few hours I felt like I was away from the city. The goods: My date and I decided to share an order of the dumplings, Kibbe and the eggplant salad. The dumplings were delicious and of a good size. Very flavorful and there was enough yogurt sauce to go around and then some. We also enjoyed the kibbe and were satisfied with the two that we ordered (1 each). I'd say that if you go with the dumplings, you should consider one other mezze - three might be a bit much if you plan to order a main. I personally hate eggplant, but I tried the salad. My date enjoyed it very much, but there was this taste that I can't describe, that really put me off. Sort of a bitter, smoky taste. Oh, I had the Pommegrenade Cobbler and my date had the Hibiscus cocktail - both were delicious.In terms of mains, I was considering going for the sea bass because it looked fantastic, but the $64 price tag put me off. That, and the waiter told me that it was a 2 pound fish - a 2 pound fish, all for me. Soooooo I ordered the Shish Taouk and so did my date. I can honestly say that neither one of us was disappointed. It was DELICIOUS. The portion was quite big if I compare it to say, Greek or Lebanese chicken sticks; the large chunks of chicken were moist and bursting with flavor. The potatoes were perfect and the cherry tomatoes and pickled veggies completed the dish (watch out for those little green balls though - that sh*t is SPICY!). All this to say that every dish we ordered was perfectly seasoned and tasty.For dessert, my date had the Baklava ice cream and I went with the... I can't remember what it was called, but it had ricotta cheese and pistachios, and was nicely rolled up like a spring roll. It was pretty fabulous. Service: Great. Everyone was attentive, our water glasses were always full, and someone was always checking to see how we were doing. Price point: This is where I docked a star. It cost us $200 for two people (we each had one drink), which is steep. For example, the dumpling entrée was $22 for three dumplings, which, in my opinion, is expensive. If I recall, the Shish Taouk was $30, which is again, steep. While I absolutely agree that the food is delicious, I think the prices could be adjusted slightly. In any case, it's a great place for a special occasion and worth checking out."

/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",5 star rating,"What an amazing night, what a delicious food, what a beautiful terrace and of course wonderful company. I spent some time digging for my five stars review for the old location of Damas, but I soon realized this is pointless. Damas has reinvented itself with a class and dining there was such a pleasure. For starters our party of seven shared the fattoush salad, the traditional humus that is still like homemade, the red beet mutabbal (my favorite) and the eggplant mutabbal. The inflated puffy warm pitta bread was perfect and helped to clean those plates from everything that may have remained. Myself, I had to order my sour cherry lamb kabab, I have been raving and dreaming about it since the visit of the old location of Damas. Still very good dish, but I think I liked better its presentation in the past. The meat balls are now served over pita bread and I really prefer the version in a bowl, where the ingredients were all mixed and the pita bread was aside so I can dig in with it if I want to. Our crowd had an identical choice of main, the outstanding shish taouk, a perfect choice if you are not in experimental mood, it comes with these yummy french fries one must have. The more original choices of shish kabab and lentil with bulgur were well appreciated. My choice was a dish called bamia, lamb prepared with baby okra, plums, apricot and garlic, the meet was falling off the bone and the food was somehow so homey yet exclusively delicious. If you decide to go with it as a main choice I would recommend to have a very light appetizer as the portion is generous. Desserts were no brainer. The baklava ice cream is magic, leave some space for it. I absolutely forgot the name of my cocktail, it was a gin based, spicy and citrusy magic and the old fashioned test passed with five stars. I didn't have a chance to look at the wine list, the fine gentleman choosing the bottle had to ask for recommendation what white is close to chardonnay and we ended up with tasty white from Greece. That reminds me to honour the service as it was wonderful as everything else that night. Needless to say I left Damas well fed and overly satisfied. I will repeat this fine dining exercise very soon for sure."

Damas is a modern take to this cuisine and I held them to a high standard to meet and then exceed my expectations of them.THE GOOD :- The warm pita bread was amazing! So fresh and soft... it puffs up into a delicious empty pita bread balls that you just have a great time tearing apart and making good use of with your plates of food. We received multiple servings of it and it was highly appreciated by the entire table.- Thibault was our waiter was on point and very helpful the entire dining experience. Left a strong impression and he seemed very passionate about his job. Exceptional service, very professional without going out of his way to be charismatic. THE BAD (or just average?!)- The mojito we had was either watered down or lacked flavor, our entire table ordered it and we all collectively felt the same. It was alright but expensive cocktails need to be better than this.- The hummus was very good but what happened to the portion size? It barely was enough to be a small tasting for 3 people! Kindly provide 2 options with the smaller one being cheaper and the larger one being slightly more than the $10 price-tag you're asking.- The meat grill plate was beautifully presented. Since no one at my table likes lamb other than myself, I ate both of them. One of them was exceptionally tender and flavorful and the other was quite fatty. I was perplexed how his happened. The shish-taouk and filet mignon was perfectly done! The garlic dip! Despite being FAR too small... was exceptional! The meat grill plate came with side fries, they were good as well. However, I definitely didn't think this plate merited the $90 price-tag.- The fattoush plate was a spin to my favorite salad that I really enjoy when done right. In Damas' version, there were pomegranate in it with a different dressing.... it was still very good but I ended up craving the authentic version when I left the establishment.- The sesame falafel plate came with only 3 small falafel balls with a tiny side of tahini sauce and homemade pickle. It was good but I've had far better falafel.THE UGLY- Exceedingly expensive to the point we felt we were being taken advantage of. Our meal ended up being $100 PER PERSON and we only ordered a single drink each! AND I left with enough room in my stomach to still be somewhat hungry!Damas is a true gastronomic experience where you can enjoy marked-up plates that look great and can be highly praised by those not familiar with this type of cuisine. If your goal is to impress someone on a special occasion (such as a date or anniversary), this is the place to go as long as the other person isn't overly familiar with this cuisine.I'd recommend trying the $75 mezze plate and temper your expectations particularly if you're familiar with this type of cuisine... keep an open mind.As someone familiar with this cuisine, overall it was good but all plates came somewhat short. How exactly are 3 falafel balls priced at $16? How is a small fattoush salad $19? A meat grill plate for 2 people priced at $90? Are we for real??Nonsense. The value given (small plates, exaggerated pricing) will prevent me to come back. Competition is also better, is authentic and costs half as much to enjoy."

And they definitely accommodate those with allergies/intolerances/dislikes. It's important to point out the quality of the service too. This is more than just a supper. It's a dining experience.

My first trip was absolutely magical and they blew all expectations out of the water. I tried to recreate that moment this year and the service is just as good but the food just lacked the special touch it had back then. We were seated by the grill and the cooks were amazing but you can tell they were pumping out dishes hardcore. They have ""perfected"" their formula for large service but it just lost a bit of the slow intimacy you associate with a local gem. The lamb shank no where as good as I remembered it - the food came out in all one temperature which is disappointing because one of the most mesmerizing parts of this dish was the cool yogurt contrasting the hot lamb. The almond slivers were less so there was less textural contrast. Instead of a tender yet intact shank we had pieces of lamb that were all tender mixed in with the rice and warm yogurt all at the same temperature and almost texture. The fattoush was something new I didn't try last time, it was good but I wouldn't call home back it. Overall it's still really good but it's not as special as it was at the beginning. It reminds me of a Jose Andres joint in dc these days. Not a terrible comparison but I think anyone who's been to damas in the past would agree the food they served was the type to haunt your dreams and these days it's just ""good."""

Yes, three types of lamb and they were the stand outs for our meal, especially those dumplings! The disappointment was the octopus salad, it was good but our least favorite.  The decor was beautiful and the service was attentive like a high end restaurant. The accolades are well deserved!"

/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",5 star rating,"I was so excited to try this place after all the good reviews I read and I was so impressed ! We had a reservation for dinner on a saturday night and were seated immediately which is always nice. We were seated at the counter which was actually very comfortable and spacious. It was such a great experience. Let me start by saying the decor in this place is absolutely on point , so elegant and modern with middle eastern flair. Service was also exceptional , very polite, they made great suggestions and didnt miss a beat, no complaints what so ever. Yes, the prices are steep, so unfortunately this isnt a place you would go to on a weekly or even monthly basis, BUT the quality and originality is perfection and the whole experience is a standout.  The cocktails and food were so delicious and prepared with so much precision and care. We had a pomegranate cocktail and the Apricot cocktail , both were super well balanced and with great fresh flavour - The apricot cocktail was the winner though , it wasnt too sweet and tasted like fresh ripe apricots, cant go wrong !  We opted for the tasting menu , which I have to say was a great mix of everything , cold and hot apps, fish, meat, sides, dessert - It was a great way to try a little of everything and get the full experience ! (and I can promise you will NOT leave hungry. We got fattouch salad, hummus, Kiebe, baba ganouj,charcoal octopus , steak, chicken, lamb , sea bass, Falafel, Pita, dessert , honestly I cant even tell you what the best part of the meal was because it was all so fresh and flavourful and prepared so well, you wouldnt go wrong no matter what you order. It was fun sitting at the bar and getting to see the chefs and bartenders in action , they were so professional and so detailed in what they were doing and it showed in what was served.  We also ordered tea at the end (Turkish black tea with  mint and orange blossom ) , it was a perfect ending to the meal. BUT if you dont want to break the bank they offer deals on ordering appetisers tapas style or ordering a mixed grilled meat platter for two , their portions are generous so either way you will leave satisfied. Damas is a gem for middle eastern food in Montreal and I highly recommend this for a special night out or just to treat yourself."

/user_details?userid=bBQZxbAr331bA2Lqqvt5dw,Saul G.,"White Plains, NY",5 star rating,"Usually a five star average means a new place, and/or a padding of the average by fanboys. That is not the case here, the average is certainly reflective of our experience.Our reservation was honored and we were led to the quieter second room. My only complaint is with the high-top seating - the chairs are padded and comfortable, but I would have preferred a normal table for a 2.5 hour meal.Service was friendly and prompt from the get go. I began with a delicious pomegranate based cocktail, La Portena had her usual glass of wine. Your water glass will not go empty. That would be unthinkable.As we would only have an opportunity for one visit, we chose the tasting menu. Ours began with a lamb tartare, a sort of slider of basturma, and a large fattoush salad. The fattoush was elevated by crispy pita bits. Note - this is not one of those tasting menus that will leave you hungry.Next up, a course of  two dishes - the lightest most perfect falafel  I have eaten in more than 30 years of eating falafel, and hummus, encircling lightly cooked filet of beef - almost a tataki.Third course was a 4 dish medley. mostly of seafood - octopus, grilled sea bass, succulent shrimp and a white bean salad. The latter was almost exactly like the one served at the Turkish restaurant near my home - nothing special, an outlier here.Fourth course brought my favorite dish of all, braised lamb over smoked wheat - like something your grandmother might make if she were a food technologist - the other dish was also hummus based, but I have lost my thread on that one.Fifth course - we have the meats - or at least the large proteins - a generous portion of moist shish taouk, and lamb chops - one a double, the other nearly so. On one occasion our waiter was a little slow with another glass of wine for me, and although no complaint was had from us, comped La Portena to a good  bit more in her glass. Chi spaglia paga. (Although no spaglia, veramente)After all of this splendor, dessert was sort of an afterthought. Some filled cookies - sort of a ma'moul and something small, like kataifi. No matter, we were full and took most of our cookies home.Certainly worth the $85 charged -- 14 dishes in all --and the best overall meal of a gourmand's trip through Montreal and Quebec."
/user_details?userid=0aGFBSiEoIzf-7BX-q1l2w,David A.,"South Burlington, VT",5 star rating,"An eye opening experience. This is the first experience with food from the Middle East that I can truly consider fine dining. Opted for the tasting menu. From the first course, I experienced a reinvention of very traditional recipes and flavors that I grew up eating. The tasting menus was divided into three services.The first service consisted of cold and hot mezzes. Fattoush was traditional - no complaints. I was impressed with the individual, bite sized kibbe nayye. This was an inventive derivation of a dish typically served on a large plate for multiple people. The sauce (I presume it was a red pepper purée) added even more savoriness and sweetness. These plates were followed by fried kibbe atop a beet purée and falafel atop mint hummus. The falafel and kibbe were of course perfectly executed but the most surprising elements of these dishes were the beautiful colors from the beet and mint. They were also both incredibly flavorful. This was followed by lamb and pine nut stuffed dumplings in a yogurt sauce. That tartness of the yogurt produced an excellent contrast that balanced the savoriness of the lamb.After a short break, the next service consisted of the seafood plates. Octopus salad with onion and lime. Grilled Mediterranean Sea bass. Argentinian prawns in yogurt sauce. Salad of microgreen and white bean salad. Everything was excellently executed.The final service consisted of grilled rack of lamb and shish tawook with garlic mayonnaise. My only regret was that I was so full by this point that I was forcing myself to finish these absolutely superb courses.For dessert - plums with labne, honey, pistachio, and rose. I would be negligent not to mention their masterfully crafted cocktails that showcased traditional Syrian ingredients like apricot, pomegranate, and Aleppo pepper.Despite cold and hot mezzes being a fundamental part of traditional Syrian and Lebanese dining, I hadn't yet seen these plates adapted to a western style fine dining tasting menu before dining at Damas. In short, even after eating in highly regarded restaurants in Beirut and Cairo, I came away from my meal at Damas with the impression that this was the superlative middle eastern gastronomic experience."

We couldn't finish all of our lamb, and I love lamb!It would be very hard to pick a favorite dish that we tried but I must tell you, dear Yelp reader, that the Fattouch salad was the bomb.com. I would eat a salad every meal if they were all that spectacular. The different dips they provided with bread were so colorful and very yummy. It was had not to go overboard on them. Glad we didn't because, my oh my, the lamb and shish taouk were great. Presentation was also very lovely.Drinks were spot on. I had a cocktail made with rosewater that went very well with our tasting menu. I feel rosewater is hard to get right in drinks, but this one was well done.So something else 'unexpected' was that the power went out! Thankfully this occurred at the end of our meal. We were seated at the bar so we got to witness the major hustle the crew in the kitchen did to still get orders out. All using their cellphones for light. They started bringing out candles to all the tables. It was very romantic. Our server was very polite, funny and attentive. A+ on service.To top it off, the restaurant is beautiful!

It was actually $85 for 12-16 small courses and that was the only option. I was actually pleasantly surprised, as I was debating back and forth between the 5 course or 6 course option, and this seemed to be a happy middle ground. My server asked if I wanted to know anything about the menu, or if I wanted it to be a surprise. I opted for a surprise and I'm so happy that I did! It was a delightful and interesting foodie adventure from start to finish. Due to this, I don't want to go into specifics or post a photo of every dish - I don't want to ruin the fun for anyone else. I would highly suggest going into Damas with an empty stomach and an open mind! I felt like there was a good balance of flavours, textures, ingredients - everything! Out of all 12 dishes, there was only one that I did not like. I definitely left full. In my opinion, it was worth every penny.

Despite calling multiple times and asking whether an earlier table would be possible, we were told they were fully booked for the first seating. We arrived a bit after 8p and half of the restaurant was empty. They are probably trying hard to not upset people by overpromising but I felt bad for us and them by leaving that many seats empty.

This one is so much more fancy and i like it even more! The walls are covered in red tapestry and there are lamps of different shapes and sizes hanging from the ceiling. The food was delicious and the drinks were amazing! The arrangement and overall styling of the dishes were on point! Good job on plating!I started with a gin cocktail called the Hibiscus Sipper. It had hibiscus in it and sumac on a cucumber. It was so pretty and it was so refreshing. I then had the Aleppo Gin Sour cocktail. It came in a martini glass and consisted of gin, orange blossom, pepper, coriander and Aleppo pepper. I was worried that I would not like this drink since I'm not a big fan of coriander but it was very good and I almost like it more than the hibiscus one. I was really impressed with their cocktails. For food we started with two cold mezzes. The first being the traditional humus. It had chickpeas in the middle and it came with inflated pita bread. OMG So good! We also had the Kibbé nayyé (beef tartar with bulgor, basil flowers, seven spices and nuts). This is definitely the best I've ever had. The meat was very tasty and fresh.Then we had one hot mezze... the Sharhat (milk fed veal filet mignon deglazed with lemon, garlic and Aleppo pepper). This was good but it was the least memorable dish for me. Lastly we had the mixed grilled platter for two people. It came with lamb chops, chicken, filet mignon, and beef.... basically two of everything My favorite meat was the chicken and the lamb. The chicken was very juicy. The filet mignon was also good but I prefer the way Persians make their filet minon (aka barg). We also had a side of fries with sumac. I couldn't finish the fries because I was so full. There was so much food! Everything was so delicious! I highly recommend this restaurant! It is pretty big and gets packed so definitely reserve ahead of time! It would be good place to go with a group of friends or with date."

I left so incredibly full - promptly fell into a food coma once I got home. wI brought my sister here when she visited me over the weekend. I had heard about it this place and it was always difficult to get a reservation, so I wanted to try it with her. The menu consisted of cold mezzes, hot mezzes, Syrian grill, and Syrian specialities. There were a lot of options and they all looked super good. Pardon my spelling for some of the dishes! For mezzes we started with the fattoush salad, this consists of tomatoes, peppers, pomegranate seeds, crunchy pita bites - very refreshing and super tasty. Then the borek jibne, which was a fried dumpling filled with melty cheese. Followed by the lamb humus, regular humus with grilled lamb in the centre accompanied by freshly baked pita bread! For the entree, we had a lamb dish with yogurt and rice, the name evades me. It was also very good. The whole meal was very good, no single dish stood out because they were all very tasty. However, the showstopper was the baklava ice cream that came with two ice cream cone shaped baklava. It was so good, I was upset that the portion was so small because I could have had double it! The meal was truly exceptional, but I do think it was pretty expensive. I would reserve this for a special occasion or a meal you don't have to pay for haha. Otherwise, I would be very happy to come again!"

I ordered the chicken shish tauok which was absolutely incredible. Perfectly seasoned and cookied with no fat on it whatsoever. Service was what you expect at a restaurant of this caliber.

/user_details?userid=7LwNP-TCe1-pevp6KjYIPQ,Dan G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Best Middle Eastern food, bar none!!!Let me start by saying my wife is Lebanese (I am not) so I have eaten tons of middle eastern food over the years, both in restaurants and on my BBQ. This restaurant has moved from its location on Parc ave to Van Horne and although the decor is quite nice nothing too extravagant. Give yourself 10-15 minutes to find parking. It was a busy Friday night yet the noise level was manageable. They have a great selection of hot and cold appetizers. They also have a fixed menu which lets you try a little of everything at $75. But the whole table has to take the menu. We started with the 4 cold mezze (chefs choice) which were delicious. There was a typical hummus, a baba ghannouj Syrian style and a spicy hummus and my favorite a pureed beet dip. Yum! The hot bread they bring to eat the dip is to die for. Reminds me of the bread I have eaten on the streets of Beirut. Portions were ample enough to share with 3-4 people. We also had a Fattouche salad to share which was very good. We ended with the mixed grill for 2 (95$) but was easily enough for the 3 of us. Yes it is a bit expensive but the meat on the charcoal makes all the difference in taste. The only thing that needs to be changed is the wine list. There were only a handful of reds under $100. This is a nono in Montreal nowadays. You can find excellent wines at a decent price in many fine restaurants ($60-75$). That being said we left filled and content. Vito our waiter was friendly and charming!! Yes it is a bit expensive but as a colleague of mine said it was the best meal he had in a restaurant this year. I would definitely go back.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserR…"

/user_details?userid=QhFrsYp0YgoortuKy2Y7Pg,Amina M.,"Syracuse, NY",5 star rating,"Probably the best meal I've ever had in my life. My husband and I were on our honeymoon, and during the planning of it we thought we had made a reservation here. When we get to Montreal, I realized I had never booked the place. We lucked into a 9pm reservation on a Thursday night (which our waitress Iris called it honeymoon luck) because it is impossible to get a seat in the restaurant last minute. The restaurant itself is perfectly decorated with middle eastern upscale vibes. We get seated, and our waitress Iris (Hi Iris, if you're reading this - you were the BEST!) tells us to remind her to explain the tasting menu to us. We're SO glad we went this route. It's $75 per person, but includes a 12 plate meal - fatoush salad, tar tar, hummus, beet hummus, pita, octopus salad, sea bass, veal, lamb chops, mint tea, pistachio gelato and so much more. And Iris explained each dish's ingredients to us and why it was brought out to us in the order it was. Each course was PHENOMENAL. Full of flavor in each and every bite. Had I ordered an entree on it's own, I wouldn't have picked any of the options that were given to me. So this was the perfect way to step out of my comfort zone. The octopus salad was so juicy and tender, and the veal was tied with it. We were seated right next to the kitchen, which normally I'd hate but I LOVED watched the chefs cook and prepare each dish to perfection. At the end of our dinner, which ended up being around 11:30 at night, Iris had brought out a Syrian shot for the three of us to toast to our recent nuptials. I really wish I could give this more than 5 stars. If you're ever in Montreal, you MUST go here!!"

Apricot alcohol drink (i don't remember the name)I usually don't order salad, but I am telling you Fattouch was delicious and a must order as an appetizer- It's basically a mixed vegetable, a little peppery salty and lemon flavoured.Yes the portions are small for what you pay for.But the quality is there.

We had a bottle of champagne in the waiting area while Mark, Charlotte and Ava worked their butts off to find us a table, and it was worth the wait! First course we ordered: Fatoush salad, Hummus with lamb, Kibbe, Cheese bites - the hummus with lamb was exceptional, I wish I had ordered a second to go because there was none left. The hummus had the right consistency and flavoring - so important! For second courses we had: Shish touk, Mujadra, and Lamb stuffed pepper and the first two were my favorites from that course. Overall everything at Damas was beautifully plated, well cooked and spiced, and a pleasure to eat. To finish off our meal Ava, Charlotte and Mark came to the table and shared a drink to celebrate us finally getting a table to enjoy the meal!! A must when in Montreal."

The lentil soup was filling, and had such a great kick to it. at first it didnt seem spicy, but the spice and heat built up and it felt great in the back of my throat. i loved the touch of crunchiness that was in it. not to mention, it was a decent size. i ended up trying to the 4 meze dips as an entree, and was not let down. all 4 dips were truly the perfect texture, flavour, and size--although they put me into a coma. the beet dip was the most unique one, and id say my favorite. never had a sweet, mediterrean dip before. the pepper and nut dip was my second flavorite, it was thick but the crunch of the nuts is what i loved the most. my third favorite was the eggplant one, eggplant flavor was intense but also had a crunch and sweet and sour touch to it with the help of the pomergrante seeds thrown in it. what a nice flair! lastly, the the hummus. lets be honest here, the hummus dip was great, but compared to the other 3 this one didnt stand a chance."

But overall, we had a good time.What left a really bad taste though was when the bill came. We were a large party and we shared some plates and the restaurant's response to that was to deliver one bill and tell us to figure it out for ourselves. We then had to spend 20 minutes passing the bill up and down the table while everyone tried to figure out their share. The server ran a few credit cards through and then left before everyone had paid. So we had to wait for her to come back. We thought we were done and we left the restaurant only to have the waitress run after us on the street and tell us we'd not left much of a tip. This was due to poor math skills and/or a lengthy and confusing bill and not due t poor intentions so then we had to go through the whole process again but this time standing by the till. In the end one person just paid another large chunk of money rather than wasting any more time. Distasteful and not an experience that any of us would care to repeat. Dear restaurant: If you are so concerned about getting your tips then YOU do the math because by the end of this experience i truly believed that you deserved 0% tip on your $600 bill."

We were in the mood for a casual and not so heavy dinner, and Syrian food seemed like a good idea. I had Damas bookmarked from our first trip, so we decided to drive over and try our luck for dinner without reservations. Note, the restaurant is slightly removed from central neighborhoods.It was pretty busy for a cold Monday night, but we were seated at the bar with no wait. After reviewing the menu and speaking with the waiter, we realized... this was not going to end up being a casual meal. Everything looked amazing, and we realized/reasoned that while we could order a la carte, we'd probably come out in the same ballpark as  the tasting menu for $85.... and since everything sounded amazing, and we wanted everything, the tasting menu seemed like the obvious choice.No. Regrets. This was the way to go. 14 dishes came out, and they were all amazing. The food is bright, and not at all heavy, and the serving sizes are the perfect amount.

We made our reservation a few weeks before arrival. Located in a trendy area away from the city center we realized quickly that this establishment most likely catered to locals and not tourists. We had never experienced a more pretentious wait and table staff. For our limited time there we constantly felt under the microscope. Very uncomfortable and awkward.

For our main we were turned onto the pan fried sea bass Samke Harra by our waiter...we asked for his recommendation and he did not let us down. The market price scared me initially but boy were we happy we took his suggestion. Crispy sea bass filleted in half and stuffed with pine nuts, sautéed vegetables, capers, and tarator sauce.

The decor, the flavours, the service were all phenomenal. I haven't been to many Syrian restaurants, but I am so tempted to declare Damas as one of the best because of the fabulous time we all had.The first time I went we got the tasting menu, which was insane. You will be eating for hours and hours. Do not plan anything after as you will not be able to move. We received so much food, that I'm not sure I can remember every single item we received. I'm quite sure it included:1) Three delectable dips with fresh pitaThe beet mutabbal was not just vibrant in colour but in flavour as well. The hummus was smooth, and the baba ghannouj was delightful.2) Fattouch salad, which was light and refreshing but still bold in flavour. 4) The kibbe nayye (beef tartar) was one of my favourite things of the evening and was perfectly spiced.5) The humus lahme, was fantastic. Who knew that cubed lamb and hummus would be so good together.6) The kibbe was the best kibbe I ever had. Although I may have just had this during my second visit...7+8) The warm octopus salad was enjoyed by the two individuals at the table who liked seafood. As was the Samke Harra (sea bass) later on in the meal.9) The Sharhat, which was one of the best veal dishes I ever had.10) Lamb chops that were magnificently and perfectly cooked.11+12) There were two desserts at the end of the meal. First was the best baklava ice cream in the world, if you go you must order it. There was also knafe which was spongy cheesy deliciousness. They were both complimented by beautiful mint tea.The next time we went I got to try a few more delicious food items such as the kefta nayye (I prefer the kibbe nayye).

Which sounded great, since pretty much everything is shareable, we build our own tasting menu by combining a few cold mezzes and a few hot mezzes.Everything was outstanding! Each dish flavorful and unique. Worth every penny and more!"

It's a Kabab ;)So, I had to part with CAD 35 to find a memorable Shish Taouk in Montreal. Memorable for two reasons: (a) delicious; (b) actually Shish Taouk and not chicken shawarma erroneously called as Shish Taouk throughout the city.Damas, the French name for Damascus, serving Syrian food in an upscale setting, with equal attention paid to the decor as to the food quality, is a fantastic restaurant with some specialty dishes that you won't even find in a larger city like NYC. The menu is extensive and spans charcoal grilled dishes, other entrees, hot and cold mezzes, and desserts. You can make a meal out of the mezzes or you can even get a tasting menu for CAD 75.My server was knowledgeable of the cuisine and invested in my having a great meal. I always appreciate that deeply. But, I wanted to keep the meal light and so had to say no to quite a few of her recommendations such as the Fattoush salad, and the Hummus (despite her entreaties. But, hey: I dine at Zahav in Philly every other month and don't miss quality Hummus in my life). Instead I started with the Eggplant Mutabbal: Eggplant dip dotted with pomegranate seeds adding extra tartness and crunch served with warm and extremely puffy pita bread. This was followed by the delightful Shish Taouk, perfectly juicy and charred, served with fries dusted with Sumac. Finally, I had the baked to order Kunafa (sweetened cheese encased in semolina, covered with pistachios and drizzled with rose and orange blossom scented sugar syrup) for dessert and it was one of the better versions I've had. It's meant for two, as the server cautioned me, but I was able to eat my way through 3/4 before giving up. I was glad I strived :)The only negative was that sitting at the bar opposite the open kitchen got hot and stuffy after a while from the heat of the grill. So, probably best to find another seat in the spacious restaurant.Where Damas succeeds beyond any shadow of doubt is that it transcends the bucket people place ethnic restaurants into. Damas isn't an excellent Middle Eastern restaurant - it's simply an excellent restaurant as the throngs of diners will attest to.(4.5 stars)"

We ordered the Tasting Menu to try a variety of different dishes.1) Beef tartare (Kibbé nayyé) 7.5/10-Good start, fresh ingredients, nice balance in texture with the crunchy nuts and soft, tender beef tartare2)Fattouch 8.5/10- Very refreshing salad with a variety of fresh vegetables, herbs, spices. Really enjoyed the crunchy texture on each bite and the acidity from the dressing. 3) Sea bass? 9/10-This was delicious! The skin was really crispy, and the fish meat was very soft and moist. The sauce was not overpowering and complimented the fish perfectly4) Grilled octopus 8.5/10- perfectly grilled octopus on top of tomato, caper and chickpeas sauce. Very nice balance in flavors! 5) Eggplant, Beet Mutabbal, humus lahmé 8/10- The eggplant mutabbal had a great smokey flavor, the beet one was very creamy and even had a nice sweetness to it. The lamb was tender and juicy. All three dishes were amazing when dipped with pita!6) Fattet Mozat 10/10- This was my favorite! The lamb was so tender and juicy and it came off the bone so easily. This mixed with rice, nuts and yogurt sauce created the perfect combination of rich flavor and creamy texture7) Rack of lamb 7/10- Nice tender lamb with delicious creamy sauce. 8) Dessert 7.5/10: By this point, we were stuffed and forgot what the exact name of the desserts were! The desserts were very sweet and fulfilling. I especially liked the ice cream one with the crunchy pastry on the bottom. The other one was almost like a cream cheese filled mochi!

Luckily that day of we were able to get a table on the patio. I cannot even begin to explain how great everything was. The ambiance both inside and outside was beautiful and eclectic. Service was on point- 2-3 waiters continued to come by to check in often throughout the dinner service. Drinks were delicious- loved the pomegranate cobbler! Food- I cannot even choose my favorite- our table (of four) started with the falafel, Tatar borek, and Qredes.  Each one was unique and savory in its own way.  I wanted more of each- they were all so good! We then had the Shish Tayok de Damas and the fattat makdous. WOW- the seasoning and flavors worked so well together and the dishes were beautifully presented!

/user_details?userid=Et6YLMrlyX2PCkqtwSVAug,Sabeena S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is one of the only places in Montreal truly deserving of 5 stars. I went here for my first date with my partner and retuned almost a year later with my mom. I am always impressed by their food, service, and ambiance. The place is gorgeous! Apparently is was renovated after a fire a few years ago. The focal point for me is the ceiling and the super comfortable chairs are a bonus. The kitchen is semi- open so you can watch the chefs diligently at work. It provides a nice show for kids. They have delicious drinks too! I don't drink alcohol but they always whip something up for me, asking what kind of flavors I prefer(sour, sweet, salty, fruity, etc.). This thoughtfulness is much appreciated. The menu changes seasonally and sometimes their vendors for meats do too, so make sure to ask whether or not certain things are halal when you go. The first time I went we had delicious meat balls covered in sour cherry sauce, and lamb and baklava ice cream (honestly a must try). They were so kind to us, we were wrapped up in conversation and passionately gazing into each other's eyes for hours. They gave us free dessert and on two separate occasions, different waiters came over to tell us how ""in love"" we seemed (even we could not have anticipated such a perfect first date). We were the last ones out of the restaurant that night and they didn't rush us at all. The second time I went, we stuck to lamb as their other meat was not halal, everything was delicious as usual and we had a lovely evening. This is an intimate, upscale spot, certain to impress a date or family visiting from out of town. It is definitely pricey- two people can share an entree and have 2 appetizers for around $75, but food for three will likely be close to $150 with tax and tip. I've seen everything from families to couples at this restaurant, if you book well in advance, you can find a nice spot here."

We arrived and were seated right away. Our server, Vito, was great. He was super personable, friendly and accommodating. We started with cocktails and we really enjoyed them, especially one that had gin with coriander. We knew we had to do the tasting menu because all the reviews before said it was amazing. Definitely do the tasting, you won't regret it! Plus it's a great price at 75 dollars. The courses are served family style rather than individually. The first course was the appetizer course which was a fettoush salad, four dips (hummus, baba ghanoush, beet hummus, and a red pepper dip), and beef tartar. They were all so delicious. The beef tartar was seasoned so well that I loved it, and I usually don't like beef tartar. The dips were delicious. Some of them had pine nuts and others had olives or chickpeas in them. The salad was delicious and fresh. The second course consisted of seafood. The first part was shrimp then octopus. The sauces they came in were so tasty. Then we moved onto meat. We started with chicken, which had so much flavor for chunks of white meat chicken. Then we had lamb chops that were cooked perfectly. Last, for dessert, we had a knafeh, which is cooked with semolina and phyllo dough with cheese in the middle and topped with syrup and pistachios. I could not say enough how delicious the food was. We enjoyed every single course and were blown away by each. If you're ever in Montreal, definitely go to Damas!!"

Having said that, everything tasted good. Dessert was good but the ice cream was better than the piece of baklava. Service was outstanding, everyone we interacted with was incredibly friendly.

/user_details?userid=-OwkM7YDnPbwGxiKd7rptw,Jeff G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"As all the previous reviews have suggested, Damas is truly an amazing restaurant. The décor, the vibe, the service, and, most important, the food are all fantastic. We started by sharing a few appetizers, (eggplant mutabbal, falafel, fried kibbé, and fatouche).  If these apps were any indication, you really won't go wrong with any of the other apps on the menu. They were absolutely delicious, both visually and in terms of taste. As an aside, three falafels are served on the plate. Keep that in mind if you plan on sharing the dish among 4 or more people. You can ask for extras, but you'll be charged.(A quick recommendation... Save the fattouch for last. This salad is perfectly acidic and super light. It is exactly what you want after a heavy, flavor-filled meat meal. I promise, you won't regret the palate cleanser.)We then shared the shish taouk and the bamia, both of which were excellent. The chicken in the shish taouk was moist, flavorful, and perfectly charred. The lamb in the bamia was fall-off-the-bone tender and the sauce paired very well. So, even with all these amazing comments, why does this restaurant only get 4 stars? Sure, there were slight hiccups throughout the night, but the overwhelming issue is that I simply can't reward a restaurant that charges $35.00 and gives less than a chicken breast worth of chicken on their main dish. Or, one that gives about a quarter cup of eggplant mutabbal (dip) as a $10.00+ appetizer. The food is incredible at Damas and I'll certainly go back again. However, a 5-star restaurant is one that goes above and beyond to make sure their clients leave with only positive thoughts and the utmost praise. That wasn't the case at Damas. Small changes on the menu available on their website: -- The Fried Kibbé (plate with three lamb balls) is no longer offered as an appetizer plate. They are now sold individually as sides.  -- The prices have gone up a couple dollars."

It could have benefited from more spice or flavor.  Because one of our entrees came out a few minutes after the others, we got a complimentary dessert which looked to us like a Syrian cannoli with creamy cheese in the middle, a light crepe around the side, and the flavor and aura of orange blossom, topped with pistachio.  And it was divine.  As for drinks, I wasn't blown away by the hibiscus sumac drink I had which I found a tad sweet and one-note.  The service was friendly and attentive, without being overly so.  I loved the decor with the hanging red tear-dropped glass lamps and beautiful floral tiled mosaics.  There's a lovely outdoor patio.  It took us awhile to be seated even though we had a reservation and were told our table would be ready in five minutes.  It took more like 25 minutes.  This meal did knock me out.  I had to lie down to sleep pretty much immediately after but my oh my, was this meal worth it."

The fatter mozat is you're feeling lamb is amazing and if you want something simple the shish taouk rocks. Everything on the menu is worth trying.

/user_details?userid=2d2qfAlBXSxcIpqu067_4w,Heidi L.,"Burlington, VT",1 star rating,"I had heard such good things about this place and was really anticipating our visit. When we arrived, the food going by looked amazing. Even though we had booked in advance and told them it was a birthday celebration, they seated us at one of the worst tables, right in the very center of the room. We were in the middle of heavy foot traffic on each side of our table. We waited 35 minutes before our order was taken. We waited 45 minutes for our first appetizer. We waited another 30 minutes for our main dish. When my dish arrived, my waiter surprised me by announcing it had dairy in it. (this after he and I had an extensive conversation about my dairy allergy) So he took the dish away and instead I had to split my husbands meal. The water then offered some hummus to us, which I gladly accepted since we were both still hungry. Again, we waited 30 minutes for that hummus. When we were done, we waited 25 minutes for anyone to clear the table or ask about dessert. When the waiter finally arrived, he offered a vegan cake for dessert. I mentioned it was my birthday and he was so surprised! He made a big deal of it and said I'd love the cake. We waited almost 50 minutes for the ""cake"" slice to come. It was exactly 1/4 of an inch thick and 1.5 inches tall. It was made of sesame. It was unsweet, chalky and tasted bizarre. In addition, my stomach began to scream in pain 30 minutes after eating it. I finally had to get up and find another waiter in order to pay the bill. After 3.5 hours, we were able to find our way to the door. This place is apparently too egotistical and thinks too much of themselves. I have never had such a horrible experience."

Ever been to a fancy resto and fill up on bread because of the excellent yet small portions? This is just what might end up happening here. Anyway, aside from the skimpy portions, everything was great. Complimentary green and black olives are served immediately. The bread is freshly made and brought steaming hot to your plate at your request. This is really really good bread. The fatouche is very good and is probably one of the only items to come in a larger portion. The labneh with zaatar is delectable as well. The humous is just right. The falafel was the least noteworthy feature. The desserts here are unbelievably rich and indulgent. Rose water, pistachio and homemade cheese make for a taste explosion in my mouth coupled with a beautiful cup of sweet tea. The cocktails are creative as well. There was a rose inspired mojito and a vodka drink with dried apricots and pistachio. Damas offers a beautiful arabesque ambiance with warm lighting and delicious food. There is a sultry red fabric above with golden Arabic calligraphy. Damas refers to one of the old names of the City of Damascus. The walls are lined with intricate wooden screens. There is a choice selection of fine wines in plain view. Lanterns cast a seductive glow.Come here for a special occasion. If you want just as excellent quality but wanna skip the pricy ambiance then ... for excellent bread and labneh and zaatar and fuhl go to Al-Baghdadi on Lincoln in Concordia. For falafel go to Nilufar on Sainte-Catherine. For humus go to Art Brgr in the Plateau."

I've never had the experience before in a restaurant that changes what I think a restaurant could be. This was quiet and beautiful. It is such a beautiful amazing decor. First stop was the bar where they reminded me of the deep history of bar concoctions, they kept saying you must try this drink with gin (can't remember the name now). It was fairly non descriptor glass, with a green hue but one taste was mind changing perhaps it was cucumber. My first Syrian restaurant but beyond ethnic food this was a great food for people who eat. Some of the diners were the well heeled but others were folks you might see on the streets of Brooklyn. I definitely remember hummus, it was so good and we were so busy eating that I can't recall all we ate but the lamb tickled my tongue."

Everything was delicious; flavourful and delicately spiced. It was an effort afterwards to try to pick a favourite, but the kibbe nayye was a contender. Often with a tasting menu, the dessert is an afterthought and not really worth it; so we were pleasantly surprised that the kunefa (?) a sweet cheese pastry was so good. Our host was second generation Syrian and was a delight, his wit and explanations added greatly to our enjoyment of the evening. Would heartily recommend this restaurant."

The decor is lovely, and the staff is gracious, whether you're an anglophone or francophone. Don't miss the cocktails--especially the Aleppo Gin Sour. The hummus is amazing--creamy and served with housemade pita that arrives hot and puffy. And the kibbe is not to be missed. We also had the chicken shish taouk, which was cooked to velvety perfection and enlivened with bright flavor. A braised lamb dish was also good but suffered by comparison. We were too full for dessert, unfortunately, but they sounded tempting."

So when we were sat down in this busy restaurant and given menus with more $$ next to the items then you would usually pay for sitting in a cafe in Damascus we were starting to get a little more worried but as the dishes came out we slowly started to see that it was definitely worth the price tag. Traditional food presented beautifully and cooked to perfection. The blend of flavours was both comforting and satisfying. Large portions meant we had extra for the next day. The drinks were delicious and options for vegetarians weren't extensive but what was on offer was on point. Busy when we went so service wasn't of the same quality as the food but it was average. Would recommend it to anyone including our friends and family back home.

I was stuffed after the fatoosh salad but could not stop eating.

Despite our reservation, they took some time to get us seated as they were running behind schedule. But once we got seated, the treatment was amazing. The server was amazing as she thoroughly explained the menu. Since we had been eating throughout the day, we didn't have the appetite for the traditional Syrian tasting menu. Instead we chose the Baba Ghannouj salad as the appetizer and it was very tasty and fresh. For our entree we chose Maqlouba & their famous Fattet Mozat. Personally I loved Maqlouba a lot more than Fattet Mozat. The chicken was tender, soft and delicious. My friend loved the Fattet Mozat as the lamb was cooked very nicely with lot of flavors. Overall our experience was amazing with the food. The ambience was perfect and cozy for small groups or large party. The servers were knowledgeable and prompt.

Yet the lingering memories of Damas will surely resonate for some time... exceptional flavors and presentation across the menu. We savored every bite of every dish. (If you have someone in your party who doesn't like lamb though, you're going to have to get a little creative with the menu.) It's a good indication that the only reservations we could get were for 10pm and the place was packed even then."

To be fair however, you can't really complain because you know the prices before you order. So if it doesn't suit your budget, stay away or keep it in mind for special occasions. Now why is it relatively expensive? Because it's amazing. The quality is fabulous. Each ingredient is perfectly fresh. The best fattoush salad in Montreal is here. The grilled meats and the specialities are all equally delicious. They bake their pita bread and bring it to you hot from the oven! Now just that to me is worth 5 stars!They have a lot of staff so service is very efficient on top of being super friendly. The decor is beautiful. Only negative point: we really didn't like the lamb meatballs in cherry sauce. The meat/lamb flavour was too strong/overpowering for our taste."

I am being generous here, and I thought the food was extremely mediocre.  We ordered a salad, an eggplant mezze, fried dumplings, and the lamb shanks. The salads and the lamb were way too sour. You couldn't really taste the lamb really and it was hard to eat  - I didn't finished much of the lamb and the waiter asked if I wanted to pack it up. Needless to say, it was a no and  I'm not someone who let food goes to waste. The eggplant and the dumplings were just fine. The worse is that we had to wait 30 minutes after we finished the other three dishes. On the positive side, the wait staff was friendly.  Perhaps Syrian or Mediterranean food is rare in Montreal so people find this place special. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you are visiting as there are many good places to eat in the city."

Alan was our waiter and he was so pleasant and helpful. We loved every moment and can't wait to go back."

The faroush salad sooo good! Liked the cheese but a bit too salty but still ate and enjoyed. They kindly served us even though we were very late for reservation. Great service, fabulous food and cool decor. Highly recommend."
/user_details?userid=bCC9m7vuNKISQ-ckJ98fJQ,She H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been dying to return to the restaurant since it moved to its new location, but it could be hard to get reservations on weekends. We decided to go in the middle of the week and the place was packed. The food and atmosphere deserves a five star,  but we really didn't find our waiter helpful, because although we eventually realized that he knew the menu inside out, when asked for his initial help, he repeated all the options listed on the menu. Yes, we know how to read, but we did specifically ask for recommendations! Anyhow, it took an hour before  we placed our order and we certainly wished that could've been expedited with his help. I wish I had done my homework before eating there! For four women with moderate appetite, we were pretty full after four mezzes. In fact, we only managed to eat half of the two main courses we ordered. I think it was really because their warm pita breads were so fantastic we couldn't help but eat two of them! We  thought the mezze sizes were very decent. My favorite items were the hot mezzes. The grilled octopus and the grilled akkawi cheese were amazing. The cheese paired very nicely with the fattouche salad. The beet muttabbal was a nice alternative to baba ghannouj but I wish there was an option of three cold small mezzes that I could try out. It is true that the cold mezzes are all offered in the discovery menu, but it  was the hot mezzes that I enjoyed the most. The main courses were not quite as memorable, maybe because we were all full by then. We ordered a shish taouk that had a very tasty side of sumac fries. The rest of the plate did not stand out so much. The other main we shared was a fattet makdous that I wasn't a fan of, mainly because I personally don't enjoy eggplants. It was definitely a huge portion that could have easily been shared. I really wanted to try the sea bass, but for $70 a plate, I wasn't quite ready for it. Next time, I would order it with the $75 discovery menu.Overall, I had a very enjoyable evening. I would say that the food is fantastic and aside from the small ordering hiccup, it was a very pleasant experience. I think the sizes of the plates are perfect for sharing between four people. Without drinks, we paid about $50 including taxes and tips. Yes, it is more expensive than it used to be, but then again, prices have gone up all over town and at least you can be assured that you will have a very satisfying meal."

We were 4/people and we went to celebrate a birthday.We started with the cold mezze platter (4 dips) and each one was better than the one before. We then had a 3 mains and split them (Shish Kabob, Shish Taouk & Rack of Lamb). Shish kabob was cooked to perfection (medium rare) and mouth watering. Shish taouk was delicious and solid. Last, but not least, my favorite dish of the night, rack of lamb, unreal! All of the plates were garniahed with extremely flavourful sides.We were tempted to order a dessert and didn't know what to order, so the waiter advised us to order the sweet cheese cake with pistachios. Absolutely delectable!Even for the price, which was expensive, I have absolutely nothing slightly bad to say.Excellent dinner and evening!"

It's kind of pricey, but it was the best meal I've had in months. We had the tasting menu, a tasty bottle of Greek rosé suggested by the waiter, oh, and I started off with a martini. I went in with limited expectations as a tired business traveler and came away very impressed by what Eastern Mediterranean food can be when it's prepared and served with care and thought. Chicken, lamb, sea bass, bread, etc. -- everything was delicious. Attentive and friendly staff and festive decor completed the picture."

From the service to the mouth-watering plates, this restaurant will soon become your go-to place in Montreal. Ambiance: Intimate, gorgeous decor, soft lighting, pleasant music in the background which isn't too overpowering and allows for conversation.Service: Excellent! Water glasses always filled up, fast service, staff is courteous and efficient.Food: Decadent and savory. The perfect spice combination, meats were cooked to perfection and bursting with flavor. The star of the show was the Fattet Mozat hands down - LITERALLY falls off the bone. A word of caution, if you order the Mixed Grilled Platter for 2, be advised it really is more for 3. We were surprised at how much food came on this platter! Great choice nonetheless. Everything else was superb, even the homemade pita bread! Hummus, Eggplant Mutabbal and Fattouch salad are perfect starters (that salad had at least 10+ ingredients). Regardless of what you decide to order, you will not be disappointed. 5 stars Damas, bravo!"

/user_details?userid=VXbi8ndacawnd6kidQF8dw,Marie P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Damas. I've got only love for you. So. On a cold cold night of January we had a reservation at 9 pm at this wonderful, warm, inviting, packed of clients restaurant. As soon as you enter you forget the cold weather. The decor is classy, not too much, not m'as-tu vu, just the right amount of coziness and style. We sat at one of the bar, they have 2, I love eating at the bar, and could see the cooks grilling, prepping and treating food with all the love it deserve. After getting all the informations we needed about the menu we decided to go big with the Menu degustation. For 75$ per person you get to share 9 mezzes and a main course. My friend is gluten intolerant and they were very accommodating abt it. They even asked if there's some mezze we would like to have more than others. It's the very first time that I have a say in the degustation menu items. It's a big plus. Everything we had was just fantastic: fatouch, eggplant moutaball, beets moutaball, kybbe (cooked one not the tartar), filet mignon, octopus salad, muhammara, fried cheese, so much delicious that I have forgotten the last mezze we had...but I can assure you it was good that's all I remember. For the main course (yeah it's not over yet) we shared the rack lamb. Goodness. Heaven. Hallelujah. The meat was so tender, grilled to perfection and perfectly marinated. I almost cried. It came with grilled veggies and an eggplant salad. The sides were perfect too: light and flavourful. Finally, yes, no judgement please, we had desert  a wonderful baklava: just sweet enough and crispy like it should. It was a very nice way to finish this amazing meal. Now the alcohol. They have a very good wine list, I think it's private importation. Anyhow I drank cava all night and my friend rum and Coke. Oh yeah, we had shooters too. Go figure. The service was brilliant: everybody that works there were smiling and helpful. Really I can't ask for more. You need to go."

Cocktails are  also creative and with very interesting flavors (try the Aleppo Gin Sour or the Hisbiscus Sipper). Staff and manager very friendly. Top of our list. If we come back this will be a must stop again."
/user_details?userid=9Upn94tCK5dtosSmo6ql0Q,Sam 2.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The food is super delicious, it's a true demonstration of one of the richest and oldest cuisine in the world , the Syrian cuisine (which is the mother of the Lebanese, Palestinians ,and Jordanian cuisines )is only comparable to the Moroccan cuisine when the Middle East culinary art is concerned . while the Moroccan achieved enormous success in spreading globally, the Syrians were more conservative in showcasing their culinary treasure. The restaurant Damas Montreal does it at its best, the service is friendly, although it could be more knowledgeable and the ambiance is nice and the bar cocktails are really good. The only downfall in my opinion are the small quantities which don't represent the Syrian hospitality , for the prices that they are charging they are expected to be more generous with the food, hope the chef owner will one day take a notice of this repeated criticism , otherwise the restaurant has really earned its position on the top of Montreal's best restaurants."

/user_details?userid=MFI1QiUcPy8iHro1n3erjQ,Bill T.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"Beautiful tasting menu. Waitress helped us select a wine that would work with the tasting menu. Highlights of the tasting were the first two flights. One was a sort of deconstructed pita with thinly sliced beef a quail egg some house sauce and tomatoes. Sort of felt like a gyro pita, but way better and without all the mess of a gyro. That was probably a lame way to describe it, but it was really good. The second flight had pita straight from an oven and various dips. The beet dip and the red pepper dip were amazing. The beet dip didn't have any peanut butter in it, but it hit such a similar taste range when it hit your tongue. It definitely wasn't peanut butter, I just have never had anything like it and that's the closest comparison that came to mind. It definitely was a beet dip. The red pepper dip had a sort of chili (like the soup) flavor to it. The rest of the servings of food were all really nice. The lamb and chicken were all well cooked. I highly recommend this restaurant."

Wine by the glass was perfect. 7 course tasting menu was phenomenal, every dish was composed of multiple flavor and texture profiles, and each blew us away. Every course was a surprise, and mystery is always fun. But no great meal can be a complete experience without great service, and Allen (?Thin male with dark hair, beard, and man bun) tied  everything together with the most professional yet enthusiastic service we've ever had. Hats off."
