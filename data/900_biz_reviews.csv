Behind the restaurants there were several parking spots reserved for the customers. We had several plates to share. A tortilla soup, a fish ceviche, pupusa, a platter with fried pork and manioc to share. The soup was very good, thick and flavourful, very filling. The full portion would make a meal. I had a small one to share. The fish ceviche was sooo good. The freshly grounded black peppercorns and the lemon juice make the dish so fresh. And the chips were crunchy. Pupusa is new to me. I liked it. From the picture you can't tell it has filling inside. The fried pork was ok, and it would be better if with some spicy sauce. I would trade it for some tacos next time. Nevertheless it's my first time to try manioc, and I liked it. This place is a hidden gem."

(Yes I'm diverse in my taste )Really get the cheese pupusa dessert  that's next to the cash register, they are awesome!!!"

They have all the Salvadorian specialties you'd expect, and everything is delicious. Staff is very friendly and you really feel immersed in the culture. I especially recommand the pupusas and the ceviche. Careful though, they're not open all week and it can be a long wait if you're a group."

We tried the tortilla soup, the pupusas, and pork/chicken tacos. It was quite a lot of food but we came with an appetite. Hostess was very sweet lady from Mexico. All the dishes we had seemed to be authentic according to my limited knowledge (Wikipedia) of El Salvador. I highly recommend El Toro for something different and satisfying."
