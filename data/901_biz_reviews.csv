/user_details?userid=yACLb6lUDPjw0g5JrNwXMg,Kyle S.,"Atlanta, GA",4 star rating,"This place checks all the boxes for me. I'm taking away a star because I think the food here, though good, is not worth the price. The vibe of this place appears as though it's a coffee shop where people come to study and do work (which it apparently used to be because now there are signs saying that all seats require a purchase... so maybe college kids were taking advantage?)Anyway, I ordered scallion pancakes and a chicken katsu dinner. The scallion pancakes were flavorful, but came drizzled with a sauce that was good, but unnecessary. I like my scallion pancakes crispy and sauce less, and unfortunately these ones came out kind of soggy and sauced up. Me entree was a pleasant surprise. It came with white rice, a small salad with a really good dressing, grilled veggies, and an small fried egg roll drizzled with that same sauce from the pancakes. The chicken was fried well, and the rice had a nice hint of something that made it real good.While the food was good, it was quite pricey and I'm sure they could bump down the price by 1-2 to make it more worth my money again...The boba here though: 5/5 stars! I'm a boba snob and texture really wins me over; the boba here is cooked perfectly, and just the right amount of sweetness. The tea itself is modifiable as well, with how much sugar, and how much ice you want. I opted for 50% sugar and 70% ice."
/user_details?userid=NQjZ94NIcYVv_0-3Dd9ZEg,Maricar T.,"West Village, Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"I can't say much about the food because we barely ate. The milk tea and boba quality if superb. Regardless of the fact that they have a big menu, like 3-5 pages of many other things, the main draw is their Taiwanese bubble tea. Bubble is freshly made and the ingredients are actual brewed tea or fruit.And the size -- the large one I ordered looks like an entire pitcher. I'm not complaining -- I love it!"
/user_details?userid=8EclJ24l7H0J-GC5tvegcg,Léonie L.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,Just alright. Nothing exceptional. Way better places to go for bubble tea and food around.Super expensive for what you get. Taste is very average. I tried a few of their drinks and food. Never liked any of them.Service is good.
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"I've walked by Nos Thés a million times but have never stopped by. It started raining after lunch so I decided to wait out the storm and grabbed a drink. The inside is bright and spacious, with an upper floor if you want more privacy. Decently busy for a Tuesday afternoon. Service is fast and efficient (they take your order on mini iPads). The menu is much bigger than I expected. Lots of Taiwanese food and drink options. If that's too overwhelming, check out the staff favourite blackboard options up front. - Dark roasted oolong milk tea ($5.85 large) - got the mixed pearls ($0.50), small and large, that were nice and chewy. 80% sweet was still too sweet (should have done 50%) and less ice. It was similar to Chatime's infamous roasted milk tea but a lighter, less roasted version.They take credit here! Decent spot to grab a BBT or to hang out/study. 3.5 stars."
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I went here before mostly for a place to sit and talk to my friends and various choices of teas never failed me. This time I went here a lunch. It was also great. I had a chicken popcorn rice lunch combo which came with salad and soup. The portion is huge and I barely finished it. The chicken popcorn is crispy outside and juicy inside. I also recommend their chicken rib. It's flavourful too.For the drinks I always like the winter melon tea and rose milk tea. Love this place. So much happy chatting memories here.
/user_details?userid=Dfu-NuG1YWB96jjBLIlsrA,Krysten I.,"Honolulu, HI",5 star rating,"This is possible the best milk tea I've had in my entire life. I'm so glad I got to try Nos Thés on my second to last day in Montreal because it meant I could return on my last day, too! We walked in and it was pretty crowded inside. One of the waitresses sat us at a table quickly and we had a few minutes to scan the immense menu. There is something for everyone here. Craving some Japanese food? They have that here! Noodles? Sure! Passion fruit milk tea?? I know, I too was skeptical at first. I love milk tea and I love passion fruit.... but together?? Magical. It was perfect. I didn't even need to add boba to make me happy. The passion fruit milk tea honestly didn't look any different than normal milk tea, which I didn't expect. I definitely want to try all the flavors they offer, because it seems like they use legit ingredients. You can also choose the sugar level and amount of ice, which I'm glad they ask about instead of making assumptions. This way your drink comes out perfect every time! I also ordered the popcorn chicken, which was ok. Not the best I ever had, but people come here for the drinks, not the food.... speaking of food though, my friend ordered the mushroom medley on rice and she was amazed. It was packed with mushrooms and smothered in delicious sauce that we will try to replicate soon. Our waitress was kind and patient. This place is great; highly recommended!!"
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I needed to check out Nos Thés as the ICU nurses from the floor always order take away from here regularly. I find it intriguing as I never knew you could order a bubble tea specific to type of milk, percentage of ice and sugar content-like a regular coffee! We came here around 10 pm and it was packed for a Friday night. The server was friendly. I ordered a regular sized chai latté bubble tea with milk, 30% sugar, half ice, and tapioca balls= perfection. If you get the largest size it was a difference of around 1.75$ - I don't like wasting good so I stuck to my regular size that was plenty. I guess I'm not a true bubble tea fanatic because I still prefer my fruity Cocobun powdered bubble tea at 3.50$!"
/user_details?userid=gs1eMH4zUws1YI5RJ1_IYA,Samantha W.,"Gloucester, Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,The bubble tea here is nothing short of amazing. It is DELICIOUS and pure bliss in the mouth. Every sip was perfection. It's not too watery and not too creamy. Yum! I got the regular milk tea and my sister got the taro milk tea that they make from real taro chunks so it doesn't come out purple! Also got a tonkatsu from here which was absolutely delicious. The only ding I have for them is.. using a jalapeño in the cabbage is quite odd in a Japanese dish so it was quite surprising biting into one.10/10 for their delicious bubble tea!
/user_details?userid=VtiHkMISkk69btfo_s0cYw,Luis G.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I was missing Taiwanese food since my last trip to Taiwan. I had targeted this restaurant for weeks and finally had the chance to try it. We ordered Taiwanese sausages with rice, some noodles bowl and the beef roll. Also some fresh taro bubble tea. The menu offers many food and drink options (mostly around tea), so basically I need to go here more often to give everything a try. I didn't see any alcohol, though. Taiwan beer would be a big plus. The food is well presented and most importantly tasty. Also the staff was really kind to recommend some dishes. Must go."
/user_details?userid=KcFMI-hsr2Em7whfI4OM5g,Katya P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I have been to this tea shop twice in the past week to sample some of their bubble teas.Nos Thes functions like a regular restaurant with a sit down area and table service with menus, however you can also buy hot or cold beverages to go. The choices are extensive. If you are a tea enthusiast, you will be well served. Featuring many exotic variations, this tea house is ideal if you are looking for an ""authentic"" asian tea experience.The bubble teas that I have tried here are made to your specifications and have a true tea taste, unlike some of the powdered or syrupy concoctions other chains brew. There is definiately a herbal/floral taste to the beverages, which was a little off putting at first since I was expecting something sweeter. Most other places I go to are overly sweet so when asking for 30% sugar, the bubble tea was almost bitter. I would stick to regular sugar if you like things on the sweeter side.As for the tapioca pearls, I found them a little stingy with the amount, pricing seems to be at par with other tea chains too but the flavor and consistency was right.In all it's good if you want real tea flavor, makes me feel like the drink is ""healthier"" than your big chains but it's not my favorite.Seems like a very popular spot for students and can get pretty crowded. I like that they give you a buzzer and you can wait in a seating area while they prepare your order."
/user_details?userid=cF1oFZ2cl1xpQIsq-yA4mQ,Aretha C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of the best bubble tea places in Montreal! Honestly you can really go wrong with any of the drinks. You can give the tea leaves a whiff before you order, and it's amazing how all the flavours are already infused in the tea. Tapioca texture is also on point. In terms of food, they have a pretty big menu of Taiwanese and other fusion foods. It's a bit on the pricy side, but it's expected for a restaurant in downtown Montreal. Their noodles lasted me two meals so I'm not complaining! I wanted to get a dessert as well but it was also too pricy imo.The decor is trendy, but the atmosphere is a bit noisy and crowded. I think they just tried to pack in the tables a bit too much.Service was also efficient and friendly. We asked the server for recommendations and he seemed really knowledgeable. We got the kind of drinks we had in mind.5 stars for the bubble tea alone :D"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is so good for their...tea. Yup it's called nos thés. They have so many kinds and you can customize it to your taste. During the summer, get the cold ones. During winter, get the hot one. It's always time for tea. What's also nice is that they have tiny bubble, which other places don't. So if you can't decide between the regular bubbles or tiny ones, well get the mix! :D As for the food, everything is so good. I always take the popcorn chicken or the chicken cutlet, but they also have awesome taiwanese noodles. Yeah, don't forget to try this place if you go downtown."
/user_details?userid=bgRxnl3RHWeOsUC_WZYOeg,Shirley G.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"This may possibly be the only bubble tea place in the area. I got the wintermelon milk tea with mixed boba, 50% sugar. It was just perfect for me. I typically like to skip the boba but this place nailed it. I love the mixed option because u get the best of both worlds - tiny ones and large ones!! My friends got more herbal / fruity teas with the same sugar options and it def was more bland. I guess that's good for someone who is actually into tea and not the sugar lol. It prob took 15 minutes in line to order and another 15 to get our orders. I would come back if I visit Montreal again!Now if we were to compare this boba place to any other joint in other cities, this place wouldn't come close in comparison at all."
/user_details?userid=41XG-tkYXv7uHubdPgetJQ,Andrew N.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Nos Thes is a place that serves up authentic Taiwanese cuisines and reminded me of the Sugar Marmalade chain I'm used to back in Toronto. I noticed this place while walking along the strip of Asian stores in downtown Montreal and I remembered by friend telling me about this place when she visited Montreal. Here's my rundown:Food -I'm a big fan of lavender infused tea so I got the Lavender Oolong Creamy Milk Tea. I could taste the lavender infused into the tea which was really good. I loved how I could also customize the sugar levels of the drink. Overall, the milk tea was decent, but the downfall was the tapioca pearls. They were a little stale and didn't taste as appetizing as the tapioca pearls that I'm used to. The tapioca pearls were definitely a miss here.Atmosphere -This place is excellent for social gatherings and there's two levels for dining so you wouldn't have to worry about not finding a place to sit. You have the option of dining in or taking out and the place as a nice aesthetic to it that's relaxing; however, it can get a little noisy here since so much is going on in the store.Service -Service here is alright! Can't really judge it too much since I didn't dine in and got my bubble tea to go! The employee was nice and respectful and when you order your drinks, you get this square pad that buzzes when your order is ready. I thought that this was good to ensure efficiency in the orders and kept everything organized.Price -I paid $4.35 for the medium and added on the tapioca pearls for an extra 50 cents. I thought the price was standard, but the tapioca pearls were definitely not worth getting.Verdict -Overall, the bubble tea was ok but the tapioca pearls really made the drink not as good. This place is really nice for social gatherings and I'd imagine it being great for studying during the mid-afternoon when it's quieter. If you're REALLY craving bubble tea then this is a good option for it but I wouldn't go out of your way to try this bubble tea as there are some better options around town."

I like the fact you can sit down restaurant style have have a waiter instead of the fast food counter variety I'm used to. I enjoyed the small bubble tea I had, price tag was good. Tapioca texture was perfect. I also got some matcha cheesecake and it was quite average. Definitely would be back for some more tea but as a take-out option."

/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"Stopped by for a bubble tea recently. Got a small lychee milk tea with mixed tapioca (small and big pearls) for $5.30. I liked it.I've never had the option of small tapioca pearls before. I've had sago pearls, which are small, but these were like the regular tapioca pearls but smaller. It was cool and different for me.I really liked the tapioca at this place. They were chewy, and not too hard nor too soft. The pearls were also sweetened, which I liked. The drink had a strong tea flavour and a strong lychee flavour which I also liked. I got 30% of the regular amount of sugar they normally put in and it was perfect for me. I don't like my drinks too sweet.I got takeout and the staff serving me was nice and I didn't have to wait long for my drink. The place looks modern and clean. I would go back."
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",5 star rating,"Fantastic boba in every form.Recently I had returned back from a trip to Taiwan and wanted to experience a different bubble tea shop other than my usual (Chatime just down the block). So Nos Thes has been on my bookmarked list for quite some time. The place was live and busy with students relaxing and looking like having a great evening of conversation, snacks and bubble tea. The tea here was fresh and so many different options. So I ordered two to go. One was a roasted milk tea, the second was passion fruit green tea. Both were ordered with less sugar and they were delish, fresh and exceeding my stringent boba expectations. If high quality bubble tea is to your needs this place is the real deal. It is prime location near Concordia I'm sure we'll though of to entice all the Asian students who love boba for a quick refreshment."
/user_details?userid=55IjT0bB0883k64EhkMPrw,Gabrielle G.,"Waltham, MA",2 star rating,"Not sure if it was because of the dish I ordered but personally didn't like it. Ordered the Vasir Noodles and was really looking forward to it but it tasted pretty average. Ordered the Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken to share and it was bland. Tasted a little sweet actually, felt like it could've used more salt.My friend ordered the Fresh Taro Creamy Milk Tea and he said there were bits (like sediments) at the bottom... He's a huge fan of Taro milk teas so this put him off. Overall disappointing, though the service makes up for it because they offer to help you split your bill if you're in a large group, which was really convenient."
/user_details?userid=5pvqFOVS2wb_y81t7iE0Bw,Denise K.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This tea house is great for millennials who are NOT on a diet, tea enthusiasts and oriental people looking for something ""different""! The upside is that the place is incredulously efficient to the point of where, what and when did that just happen. Orders are taken by young oriental ladies clad in white T-shirts and black trousers and sent to the kitchen via I-pad. Thereby producing almost instantaneous meals, and you are left questioning; ""When and how did that get cooked so rapidly?"". We had the Spring Rolls, to be avoided as they are nuked and the size of a smaller adult's ring finger, and what was supposed to be Fish Tempura. The latter dish was far from what one usually refers to as fish, rather it was a rubbery substance somewhat marinated in who knows what and so lightly sautéed that it was not even warm. On the other hand, my daughter raved about the tea, and the dishes containing rice or noodles looked quite good! Avoid this place unless you are in the market for lots of carbs coupled with minimal protein."
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Confession: I'm addicted.I was introduced to Nos Thes by a colleague a couple weeks ago and I've shamelessly been back like, four times now. It's bad how into these teas I am. Bubble tea, up until this point, has sat in my memory as ""that thing I drank at L2 when I was a teenager and I couldn't hang out in bars"". We're talking about an entirely different caliber of beverage at this establishment, especially comparing to the shady and sparse bubble tea establishments Montreal had to offer in the 2000s. Beyond the vast selection of teas, I really appreciate that you can select the exact sweetness level you'd like and the size of your bubbles. Oh and the staff is consistently lovely.The snacks are also pretty good though, much like the teas, are a bit pricey for what you get.Right now my fave is the vanilla nut milk tea but I'm also fond of the milky oolong."
/user_details?userid=VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw,WhiteFeather H.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"I just discovered this place this week when a friend invited me to go out for lunch to lament about the passing of Prince. I had already eaten, so I wasn't that hungry but I did get some snacks, and I did get possibly the best jasmine green tea I'd ever gotten at a restaurant. It was steeped to perfection (and you know how easy it is to over-steep green tea), and it was THE perfect temperature for drinking. At first, I was thinking that they were taking a whiiiiiiile to bring my tea to the table, but now I understand why! They simply wanted to bring me the perfect cup, ready to sip right away. Nos Thés has a *massive* selection of teas - their speciality is cold bubble teas of every possible mixture, but they will do any tea choice hot as well. I can imagine that mid-summer, this place is totally hopping. The meal choices are also plenty. I had a little plate of spring rolls, which were average. My friend had a curry dish which was soooooo much food (mainly a whole lot of rice), but she really enjoyed it, and she's come numerous times to this place, so obviously something good is happening! I really enjoyed the whole high-ceilinged, open, airy atmosphere of the interior. It's a breathable space, which I appreciate. Our servers were friendly and in control, which speaks of competence at what they do. I think I'll be back again when I'm slightly more famished, so that I can get a better sense of the quality of the food. Also, maybe I'll taste more of what I'm consuming when I'm not choking on the loss of a pop culture icon who marked my entry into adulthood!It's amazing how these places of public food consumption become landmarks for big moments in our lives."
/user_details?userid=-YSbbY0cB0QIUZSBMCku0Q,Raymond D.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"While I've had better bubble tea, this won't disappoint, and hasn't yet for the past three years! Never had a problem with lines but waits for your drinks can get long during peak take out hours.Every time I'm here, I'd usually order a bubble tea, and I've always enjoyed how their drinks taste the best and consistent among a few bbt joints in town. My reason for a 3-start rating is because of their food and service the last time I came. Usually, the food is average but I was rather let down when I ordered the Taiwanese famous street food: Beef roll (牛肉捲餅). Normally, the braised beef, green onions/leek paired with a sweet sauce is rolled in a savoury pancake but I'm not sure how they managed to make it look so mediocre. To quote my friend, it looked ""disgusting."" The pancake looked soggy and moist and the roll wasn't even cut properly so it didn't even plate nicely. It lacked green onion and was primarily beef (which is fine) but the green onion gives it a nice kick which was missing. To add on to that, my bowl of noodles came almost 10mins after my friends dish, leaving him to politely wait as his food turned cold.Will try their food again and update my review as I've had higher hopes."

We got there without a reservation and the entire first floor was already full. Luckily, they had a lot of room on the second floor and that's where we were directed. Their menus are slightly decomposing, but I like to think of it as them being well loved. Some pages are torn and the edges are wearing off, but everything is clearly legible. There are SO MANY options! The waiter was really nice and helped me narrow down my decision. I ended up getting something with rose. 30% sugar. Sorry, I forgot the exact name!My drink was the first to arrive and my friends' drinks arrived one by one after that. However, they ran out of tea! So one of my friends had to wait over 15min to get her order (grean tea with jasmine), which was unfortunate. The food there looks really good, but we didn't get anything, because we ate beforehand, not expecting such a wide selection. We stayed for a few hours, just talking and drinking out teas. The staff was very kind and we didn't feel rushed at all. It was a great experience and I can't wait to go back!"

Food came really fast after ordering, though appetizers came after entree (don't expect this in Asian restaurants). Fresh taro milk tea with mix pearl was exceptional! I could taste the chunk of taros in the drink, unlike the powder taro milk tea I usually get. I ordered less ice and half sweet and it was perfect for my taste.The yam fries was also very good! Sweet and salty snack to go with the fried chicken nugget, which wasn't the traditional Taiwanese chicken nugget since the crust was thicker. It's still good though!Beef noodle soup and dried noodle with pork sauce were just as tasty! Good eat!"

Ask if you can't decide which drink on their extensive list you wish to enjoy.Where to start? Taro and mung bean are perennial favourites. They add fresh taro/mung bean in the drink to give it more taste and texture. Both taste great cold (no ice, please) or hot (brings out its sweetness)!If you want something different, there's wintermelon, herbal jelly latte, moroccan mint iced tea, or even yuzu honey tea. You want the strong tea flavours? Do yourself a favour and try the oolong or assam tea.Pearls come in large and small. Unsure? Try a mix of both! Ice/sugar level customizable, options in iced or warm in most of their offerings, soy/almond milk available!Bonus: Hungry? They have a large menu. From deep-fried appetizers, to noodles and curries, to matcha opera cakes. But the real star is their tea quality. Place is modern and well-lit, high ceilings, wooden tables.

It was super yummy. Tasted like chocolate milk with a little something extra. The boba beds were perfect too. There were too many. It took maybe 4 minutes to wait since they were very busy.

They use real frozen fruits (for many drinks) and good tea instead of diluted tea and flavoured powder. I guess that's an explanation for the time takes to make a drink.Food:Average-priced, inauthentic, and dare I say, revolting. We tried 3 different items from the menu, and they all tasted terrible (2/5). It seems like the chefs don't know how to use a deep frier: fried food, as illustrated in my photos, were overcooked, dry, and tasteless. The 'zha jiang' noodles, suggested by our waiter, had a skewed taste. The recipe is simple and the ingredients are broadly accessible, so how they manage to screw it up is still a mystery today.Would come back when I feel like getting my hands on a mango iced tea ehehe."

The crowd is mostly young. It is brightly lit and doesn't have any real 'ambience' but the food selection makes up for it. I don't believe they serve alcohol, but that's not a deal breaker for me. Hey have a vast selection of bubble teas and other teas.Will definitely be returning."

Decor looks more simple, and clean which I like a lot more than their old place on St. Matthieu.  Crowd is not too bad in the afternoon- around half full. I do know that it gets packed late weekend nights though. I ordered an azuki matcha Latte here and also dark roasted oolong. As always they provide tiny and regular boba - but now they also provide transparent bobas in the mix. Very interesting. I think my favourite remains their oolong milk teas (the flavor is pretty rich). And you can control the amount of sugar you want in your tea. I think their quality of tea has remained consistent over the move. I say this because I was really skeptical at first because my azuki matcha latte was a little blander than usual in comparison to when I had it in their older location. But I realized I had ordered less sugar.My friends tried the rose osmanthus milk tea and jasmine green milk tea. I really liked the jasmine green tea. Very rich. I was neutral with the rose tea because my friend ordered no sugar. I kind of like a bit of sugar in my teas . Of course there was a bit of a wait time because they are brewing tea bag by tea bag. But I suppose that our order came in faster than usual because the place isn't packed. Service here is usually quite good. Waitress are very attentive - and don't rush you like other places I've been to in other bubble tea cafes. Be warned, if you are here to surf the web - internet here is very unstable.  My only concern has always been the wait time. When it gets busy, I still have to wait around 10-15minutes.

I love the bean bag chairs in the front of the store for a more lounge environment. The bubble tea is made from real tea and they have quite an extensive collection. I do find the teas quite sweet so make sure to halve the amount of sugar. The bubbles are a good texture and left in syrup so they also bring good flavour. The food is pretty average taiwanese.

The milk teas are extremely sweet so I'd definitely recommend you order them half sweet and add sweetner if you want it more sweet2. Minced pork and rice is a classic Taiwanese dish. This was not fantastic but def not horrible. It comes with steamed broccoli which I found tone a bit random. Probably should come with pickled greens or other non-crunchy greens3. Popcorn chicken- amazing! Order this! It's fried in a way where it was not greasy and so very tasty!!! It gets soggy if you bring it home so not worth the to-go baggy4. Scallion pancake was good minus the sauce they poured on top- next time I'd ask for sauce on the sideOverall a positive experience!

Restaurant seems to be doing good thou , 3/4 packed , lots of people arriving or taking drinks for to go.Regardless , I came here with a date for food as we were starving. Thereby , we didn't take any drinks --from my experience drink wise --it's not as bad as one would think. This review will focus on the food. We grabbed a Tonkatsu plate , a braise beef noodle soup and some sweet potatoes French fries.Let's start with the Tonkatsu, rice had soya sauce added, but a bit too much . I think that was the problem, too much of everything concerning the seasonings. For example , my chicken had too much of sauce --it made the entire plate way too sweet. Even the most decent part of the plate the salad --had too much sweet sauce . Overall , the plate wasn't as great as I had expected. Although , it is sort of my fault as I took a Japanese plate inside a Taiwanese plate , maybe the food of their cuisine is better --who knows maybe another yelper could tell me about it.The braise beef soup was average. Noodles are not homemade , and thereby , they come fresh from the frozen fridge. Beef was fresh and soft --not a bad quality of beef for the plate. I think it tasted just fine. Although, the soup of the plate was not too good , clearly there was a lack of flavour --as well as it didn't taste as spicy as it did . Think there was too much MSG , honestly I feel like that is how is tasted.As for the sweet potatoes fries , they are great and long. They changed their sizings of the potatoes comparatively to their last location. They were seasoned appropriately although , I think there was a bit too much salt. The salad that comes with it could be refreshing for some, it's the same as in my Tonkatsu plate, I guess it could help yourself to not feel too bad after finishing all the fries by yourself! Overall , this appetizer was good.So conclusion, restaurant is mediocre in terms of food , I guess it could be worth it if one wants to eat small things like appetizers and grab a drinks. However , I beg to differ in the scenario that one wants to try their meals as from my experience today , it really wasn't worth it."

There were two women working the counter taking orders and making the drinks when I walked in. Since my friend and I had been walking around all day, we wanted to sit down at a table and order a snack. You can certainly order things to go though. I am Taiwanese and grew up drinking bubble tea. This place offers an incredibly wide selection of teas, mostly freshly made. There is a small selection of powdered flavors, but why would you choose that when you can get the real stuff? Like all tea/beverage stands or shops in Taiwan, you can adjust the sweetness and ice level to your liking. I had the passion fruit tea, half sugar, and less ice which was perfect. The tapioca pearls were also cooked perfectly. I can't comment on the food since we only ordered their Japanese croquettes which were perhaps a bit under seasoned but still good.  I would definitely order it again.

They provide you with enough beef slices to keep you full. I had beef slices that were both fatty and both lean, so it's luck of the draw I guess. There were also green onions and veggies in the soup which really enhanced the overall flavour of the soup. Highly recommend this dish. Note that they also allow you to add 1$ for extra noodles or $1 for hand made thick noodles. Next time if I was hungry I would add the extra money for more noodles. Mean came to $12 after tax."

Came here with my 2 asian buddies and one Latin dude who self invited himself to our little road trip. I usually get popcorn chicken back home, so I was looking forward to trying them here. I've never ate a cactus before, but this is probably what it's like. Wasn't hot upon arrival, dry, over cooked, and under seasoned. I started to question why we even came to Montreal and my head started to hurt a little, probably due to my mind being blown over how anyone can screw up popcorn chicken this badly. Also had the visar noodles. Friends got the beef brisket noodles, and the tonkatsu, which were on point, as were the drinks - they were good, but I didn't orgasm in my mouth.It was a Saturday afternoon so it was pretty busy, as a result, service was slow and the food took a while. I could tell the two Chinese girls sitting at the table next to us were beginning to rage as they've been waiting for their food for some time. Now that I think about it, they didn't seem like they liked each other too much... Maybe there was some drama going on, who knows? Girls are complicated.Anyway, being a group of guys, we didn't mind the wait too much, aside from the fact that we were STARVING AS F**K! But it was cool still. Making conversation and creeping on the other restaurant patrons distracted us from our bellies.Returned the next day for take out drinks.All in all, a good experience.

The restaurant has good bubble tea, so my friends and I come here frequently. However, yesterday we have encountered a rude supervisor named Joseph who forced our friend to order though we already ate before and our friend didn't feel like to drink bubble tea. We r a group of 5 and 4 of us ordered a bubble tea each. After placed our order, the waitress told us the fifth person needs to order too according to the restaurant policy. Everyone needs to order to be able to sit in the restaurant. The supervisor named Joseph was super arrogant and said it is a written policy. Our friend should order or else he can't stay. First of all, we were at restaurant at 14:30, the place was half empty. Secondly, if the policy said so, you should just be clear to us from the start, and we would go to another place instead without leaving our friend to be humiliated this way. The fact that the restaurant took our order and then forced our friend to spend money when he didn't want to is unacceptable. Lastly, policy can be modified accordingly. In the end, we haven't given any tips due to the horrible experience and we wish this won't happen to anyone else. Too bad you lost 5 loyal costumers."

I ordered two drinks  ; the milk tea with glass jelly and a taro bubble tea with tapioca. Both with regular amounts of sugar and ice. (you are free to choose) I also took the chicken katsu plate that comes with a mix of vegetables, a salad, a spring roll and rice. The chicken was really good but what I didn't like much was the soy sauce topping that really smelled like vinegar. If you don't mind the smell and taste of vinegar, it should be fine for you! I prefered my boyfriend's meal who ordered the taiwanese chicken leg that also comes with veggies, salad, rice and the spring roll. Overall, it was a great experience, the price was reasonable and the service was good. The waitress was really sweet and came to check up on us a couple times to make sure that everything was alright."

However the experience I had this Thursday was disappointing. I came in at around 3:15pm and ordered a large sorbet tea and a matcha opera which is enough for  afternoon tea. And then I opened my laptop, charging my phone with my own laptop, while having the tea and the dessert. At 3:55, the waitress came and gave me the bill without me asking for it or finishing my drink, and asked how I would like to pay! I mean, I would totally understand it if the place was packed or a lot of people were waiting, but the truth was there were several empty tables around me! This is the first time I've ever experienced something like this, being ""chased out "" of a restaurant! How ridiculous! I liked the restaurant, but maybe not any more."

Though it started out seeming like a wonderful alteration on the typical Taiwanese style, it got old a lot faster than I initially expected, as the mealiness of the breading got to me over time. The zha jiang noodles I had were neither spicy nor flavorful; just an overall disappointment.Where this place shines is its tea. So many places make their bubble tea sickeningly sweet, but Nos Thes offers an extensive list of full-bodied teas that strike a balance with the boba instead of just matching its sugar content.Come for the tea and skip the food."

I've had it with small bubbles and I think it's better than the normal bubbles!  I would give Nos The a 5 , but my boyfriend's dishes were on and off, the ones he chose. And also service is very slow on certain days because I think they are understaffed.  I think they need to have 2 people behind the counter. Kitchen I think is okay because food comes fairly quickly once it's ordered. But when it comes to getting the order taken, it's too long.

They had a stacked list of teas to try hot cold or with boba. Our waiter was great and of course the best thing about the place...The food!! I ordered G05 on the menu which was the traditional taiwanese spicy beef noodle dish which was amazing (not like Vietnam pho because the broth is completely different). My mom got the taiwanese popcorn chicken and it was amazing too! Nothing like American popcorn chicken because I think they mince it first and spiced it very differently. Im so glad my mom spotted this gem because it was a great experience.  Everything we got was delightful and we will definitely be going back.

A few moments later, the waitress asked me: ""oh, it's not rushing but would you like have the bill separate or together?"", because i was with someone, and then she would bring the card machine to the table ""it's not rushing but here's the machine"". I checked to see if there were a lot of people in line waiting for a seat, but no one was there, except for the take outs. She probably saw the look on our faces when she was waiting for the receipt so she asked: ""was the anything wrong with the service today??"". No Sherlock, people would love to be rushed to finish their meal. Other similar places have never done this, to me at least, and they have roughly the same amount of customers coming in.

We ordered the lunch set, which came with a savoury miso soup, an asian cucumber salad and a cup of their refreshingly awesome green tea with orange zest.

In regards to decor, it was cute and modern and I enjoyed the Jazz music playing while we dined. The place was clean and the service was excellent. I ordered the Vasir Noodles combo. It came with a soup, small salad (diakon and carrot), and iced tea. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The noodle dish was delicious! I forgot to ask what type of iced tea it was--it was so good, I would happily give up my daily coffee if I had access to it in my area. My friends and I remarked how tasty our meals and drinks were. I read a few reviews that remarked on the price. I don't feel it's pricey. My meal totaled $13.50, which I found reasonable for the size and add-ons. Overall, I loved it!

Another time I ordered some takeouts, turned out the meat was completely over fried, as in it was black, hard, inedible. I had to walk back to the restaurant and showed to the server who was very reluctant to have it remade even upon seeing the poor food quality. It'd be nice if they could strive to keep a more consistent quality with their cuisines as much as with their tea, and tend to customers' complains with more diligence."

I've spent the last five months scouting Montreal for the best bubble tea, and Nos Thés is hands-down the winner. Great assortment of teas! The food is amazing, albeit a little pricey, but I just go for the killer appetizers and tea!The only thing I want to note is that there are two different locations in Montreal and the atmosphere is very different depending on which place you go to. The Saint Catherine one near Beaudry metro is very sleek and stylish with padded booths and faux-grass walls and it is larger, so it tends to feel less crowded. On the other hand,  the Saint Mathieu location is basement-level and feels like a cozy, independent coffee/tea place with mis-matched decor and magazines in stacks for you to browse. It also gets pretty cramped when it's busy and doesn't seem to have as much staff as the Beaudry location. Either way, you get the same great menu, so you can't go wrong!UPDATE 10/2014: Nos Thes on Saint Mathieu has now moved to a swanky new location next to Concordia on West Saint Catherine! Their new place is adorable and modern, but has the same delicious tea and food!"
/user_details?userid=04EKbK86Amxc0lkifqfqgw,Brenda K.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,Chewy and delicious bobba. A very wide selection of unique tea blends. Ordered the creamy series but the tea was a little too weak for my preference and the drink was a little too thin. The drink was not as creamy as I thought! However it was surely refreshing!

I understand why:) each tea the four of us shared was fantastic. The key is to not get the Westernized bubble tea where they use the powder. We didn't try the food, but maybe next time:)"

Sweet potatoes were very unique; chicken legs were not flavorful.  We went in during the busy time; the service was on the slow side."

However, I find their dishes are a bit on the sweet side, their beef noodles soup is on the sweet side. The soup suppose to be salty. Even their Jia Jian Mein was on the sweet side. If they are a bit easier on sugar I'm sure it will be better. I will still go back for their teas."

/user_details?userid=941m7FFFBeoCRLXJZxflzw,M P.,"Charleston, SC",3 star rating,Place was loud with lots of echo. We came for the bubble tea and was surprised with all the choices! The menu was wrinkled on a clipboard and portions were small. Everything was a bit pricey too. Overall taste of product was o.k. for the price.
/user_details?userid=mLmgtTwuryDjJAQrSZ_w5w,Karina W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My Taiwanese friend introduced me to this place and now I wish it was closer to home so I could go every week... at least. I've always adored Taiwanese cuisine and this one is definitely a jewel among the plethora of Asian restaurants in the Concordia ghetto. I went there during very late in the afternoon, so it wasn't very busy and the food arrived in what seemed like less than 5 minutes. I had the fried chicken cutlet with rice, which may sound like something on a kids' menu, but it was sooo much more than a fried chicken cutlet with rice. First of all, the chicken breast meat is good in itself,no doubt having been marinated in some magical Taiwanese concoction. Then, it is wrapped in this rice krispy like batter and very nicely fried so that it's crunchy but not at all oily. The plate came with a giant serving of both fresh salad and pickled vegies, served with delicious dressing. The dressing could be a tad sweet for some people, but it's totally right up my alley. I had the time of my life dfinishing my meal. Drinks wise, I chose the honey green tea with tapioca bubbles. It's fantastic! The drink is a bit more expensive than those at other bubble tea pkaces, but no doubt it's because they use real tea leaves. Another plus!"

/user_details?userid=gjnrVDX2l_LGfMEkcKBXxg,Simon K.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Before I got here, I was told that I would be amazed by the quality of food from this establishment. The restaurant fell short of my expectations. We were promptly seated and we each ordered a beverage. I got the chocolate bubble tea, and it was pretty good. However, the food service is a bit slow. While we received our appetizer (sweet potato fries, very good by the way), the rest of the main dishes came late and not all together. In fact, I was done eating my meal a long ahead of time before my friend got hers. I ordered the Japanese curry with fried pork filet. First off, the dish was slightly cold, the breading not flavorful, lack of seasoning on the curry, but the pork cooked just right. I doubled checked the breading by sampling my friend's fried chicken, but it was the same lackluster quality. All in all, I think this place may be great on a snack level (bubble tea + appetizer), but don't raise your expectations too high for the main course."
