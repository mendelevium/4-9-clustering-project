I must say that I am not an expert when it comes to Indian food, simply because I don't eat it as much. But oh wow, that butter chicken was so good, and I don't usually like butter chicken! Their onion bhajis is a great choice to compliment the creamy sauce, simply delish. I haven't had the full dining experience yet, but I am definitely going back there again!"
/user_details?userid=TJAZ4h-YNSk9vqdEmuwaIg,Roxane V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,We really wanted to try some Indian food as we haven't tried any since we got to Montreal (over a week now). We ordered the chicken biryani and the beef vindaloo. So the biryani was not really a biryani but more like a spicy tava pulav but it was sooo good. it had Bell peppers but few pieces of chicken like maybe 3 pieces and that too a bit broken. The quantity was really less. The box wasn't full. Like maybe in between half the box and 3/4th of the box. The beef vindaloo didn't taste like an authentic vindaloo taste. It needed more spice and sourness.
