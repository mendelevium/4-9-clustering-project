/user_details?userid=6GN1-lN562HbUOBN51AeYQ,Frédéric T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Finally a great brunch offering in this part of the city! I went for the Sunday brunch and everything was terrific. I tried the breakfast wine pairing and the mimosa and both were delightful and well chosen. Everything was so tasty! The chef came out of the kitchen to ask us what we thought of the breakfast and to chat a little. Overall a great experience, a great decor and wonderful staff.I can't talk about their regular menu, but I'm giving 5 star for the brunch. At last, it's nice to see a foodie brunch place on Ontario/Papineau."

I find the atmosphere and the food quite amazing, I had some quality time socializing my loved ones after a long depressive episode stuck at home. This restaurant is specialized in French fusion food with a great wine menu. We also had a blast with the yummy dessert. Cannot wait to go back there with my dear friends!"
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We went there on a Saturday night and were quite surprised that more than half the restaurant was empty. Within the first 3-4 minutes of sitting down we were asked three times by the waiter what we would like to order to drink. You can imagine how annoying that is.... All their main courses come in a table d'hôte format with soup or salad of the day and tea or coffee. I ordered the shrimp dish with their mushroom soup and my boyfriend had the dorade fish with mixed green and fennel salad. I wasn't particularly too impressed with my dish and as for the soup it was quite bland and missing spices. As for the dorade, presentation and taste wise it was more impressive than my dish and the salad as well. I would recommend to order the dorade if you Ike fish and plan to go there- see pictures. As for the deserts again nothing spectacular, we ordered the Paris Brest since it's my boyfriend's favorite desert and no comparison to what he's had back in France.Overall a decent experience and nice restaurant. Not too sure if I would go back but glad I tried it once."
/user_details?userid=HVQKFDi-vZbawtmLMq3ZOw,Gab G.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Okay, it's difficult for me to review this place, because while the food was amazing - five stars for me, really - at the verrrry end of our meal, when the restaurant was closing up and we were the last patrons, we saw a mouse. Yikes. If you're still interested in the awesome food - hence my overall four star rating - here's what I ate:+brie+mushroom soup (comes with entree)+side salad (comes with entree)+steak frites+lamb lollipops+creme brûléeMy mom and I wanted to split the lamb, and they were able to divide the entree and salad in the kitchen on separate plate, which was appreciated. It was a huge portion and tasted fantastic. I also devoured the Brie almost singlehandedly and had a few bites of the beef - incredible. The creme brûlée was perfect. If you're still reading, here's where things took a turn. We were waiting for our check when we saw The Mouse. Not a rat, mind you, though we made plenty of Ratatouille jokes, and I would go as far as to say it was even cute. But still. In a subway: fine. In a resultant: uh-uh. We thought we were going to have to tell the waitstaff and hope they didn't think we were lying, but that little guy stuck around, so there was no shortage of evidence.Here's the thing. I took issue not with the fact that we saw a mouse - though that was creepy - but because the staff didn't do anything. We received a brief apology and some explanation about having the doors open on NYE, but come on, not even a dessert or glass of wine comped? Sorry if that makes me sound entitled, but in my experience, when three patrons (including a local) are freaked out, you do a little something to make them happy."

The atmosphere is relaxed and easy going, it's a perfect place for large groups. At the same time, it's a good place to go out for a date, it is mostly an ""older"" 30+ crowd and I love it.  Definitely recommend it if you're in town."
/user_details?userid=qJloaSkArkiUc1gZNu-hEg,Henry L.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"A very disappointing anniversary dinner. Service and food quality has gone downhill. Big time. The ""cod"" was so dry and tough, so was my duck breast. Our jaws were tired after half way of the meal. Our server was kind of cold and inattentive. Had to wait 15 mins to order, and he never refill the wine or water for us. We took the issue of the fish to the server and he just said nothing, and turned to ask the hostess to talk to us instead. Hostess did try to make it up with a free dessert (not for both of us though) but the overall experience remained bad."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Came here for a conference so can't really rate it normally like other restaurants. However, the food was very good. I had a seafood appetizer with seared tuna (but just 1 clam and 1 mussel on it), the fish and a creme brulee. They all tasted very good. I don't know what the price would be if I ordered them normally. However, the location isn't convenient so I don't think I would come back. The restaurant also smelled a bit old."
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This resto is very cute and affordable and the waiters are very nice. I had the MTL a table menu. I started with the salmon gravlax with squid ink sour cream and pickles. The salmon was cut up into thick triangular pieces cut in triangles. It was so good! It was def my favorite thing of the night. It didn't come with bread...it came with these circular mini pancake. The second dish was supposed to be rabbit saddle stuffed with Saint-Benoît-du-Lac blue cheese, apple and sparkling cider sauce but they replaced the rabbit with pork. The blue cheese was not very strong n the pork was quite tasty. That being said I preferred my date's duck confit off of the regular menu. The skin was so crispy and I liked that it came with a soup or salad. It's definitely worth it for the price. Lastly, we shared the creme brulée and the tarte tatin. Based on the reviews I read on yelp people seem to be loving the creme brulee but it was just ok. I've had better. Also I did not like the tarte tatin. The dough was very acidic. :("
/user_details?userid=4w-xY0Yc-jOvoCT4vJucUQ,Dorothy C.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,Came here for brunch because of the Mtl A Table event (similar to Toronto Winterlicious event). It's a very authentic French restaurant (no English on the menu) and waitresses are very friendly. I enjoyed my meal a lot. Both my boyfriend and I ordered the orange juice as an appetizer and egg Benedict as Main. The only thing is they are counting orange juice/ tea as an appetizer. But overall the meal is pretty big portion and filling. I would recommend this place for brunch!
/user_details?userid=vxdxGUWjR0D_-SdHMy9bTg,Kristie W.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my top two favourite French restaurants in Montreal. Classy and cozy restaurant, without feeling stuffy or pretentious. Service was excellent: the server translated in detail every single menu item from French to English for my anglophone friends, even though we did not ask her to do so.When we went, we ordered the 30th anniversary set menu that they were promoting. Appetizer- Rillettes du porc, Main - Duck confit, Dessert - Creme Brulee. Every course was at least a 9/10 in my opinion, but the creme brulee was the best I've ever had. Order the creme brulee."

/user_details?userid=Bo8yNJ-0gJH18jPpz0wXJQ,Tamara M.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Very typical French decor, a bit on the older side. The general crowd was 40+, light and relaxed ambiance. Not overly noisy which was good to keep a conversation. The service was top! Very attentive and friendly waitress. They bring you bread and butter to start off (not margarine), bread was ok. Food came quickly to our table. We ordered from the table d'hôte, which came with salad or soup plus the/coffee. I ordered the salad which was decent and other ordered the soup, which was very good. The main dish was good as well.Overall it was a good experience but nothing extraordinary which is why I am giving it only 4/5 stars. I personally don't prefer these very French-styled restaurants but that is just my preference. So if you like French restaurants this is definitely a good choice, like I said, the food is good and the service is top!"

My waitress left after serving appetizers and told me someone else would help us since it was really slow. Good: food, decent prices for food and wineBad: It was our wedding anniversary and my partners birthday- they did nothing despite me telling them well in advance. Slow, lackluster service and the place looked dated"

We chose exactly right. The food was wonderfully prepared. The ambiance was warm and welcoming. Our waiter could not have been better. He was a real pro. He was very helpful with choosing the right wine. Next time in town, we will be sure to return here."

Our apps were great; we shared the escargot and the goat cheese...both amazing!  My wife ordered the salmon salad and I ordered the hanger beef both of which were good (not fabulous). My wife finished her meal with an ""excellent"" cappuccino and ""the best lemon tart"" she's ever had. I ordered the small plate of assorted cheese, nuts, and crostini which was perfect to finish the bottle of wine. I recommend this restaurant."

/user_details?userid=FCtJ0J9ujf7qf1yMxSYPrA,Rebecca W.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Meh. The place is quite pretty and the menu might be appealing to out-of-towners that don't know about all the other great classic French bistro-style restaurants in Montreal, but if you've been to L'Express, Le Meac or even Cafe Cherrier, this place doesn't even compare.The food here was good a few years ago, but I'd have to say that it's mediocre at best now. I had dinner here this weekend and parmentier soup was bland, the steak in the steak-frites was dry and overcooked, and the cod fish was fine but nothing to write home about. And last but not least, the baba-au-rhum dessert was watery.Although the food was a let down, our waiter was friendly and on point, and there is still something kind of nice and nostalgic about the place itself. It's the kind of spot you wish could stay good forever. But sadly, it seems pretty obvious that it's not the case. There are tons of French bistro-style spots in Montreal that are WAY better. I'd pass on this one if I were you. Sorry!"

Lamb, duck, green curry shrimp, steak and fish, all cooked perfectly with lots of flavors and sauce.  Most of us ordered the wine pairings suggested on the menu and they were also well thought out.  Our waiter knew each dish and gave excellent suggestions. I would recommend to friends visiting Montréal."
/user_details?userid=Ex-QoUxevVpBPsovXWb8cw,Naoufel T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I went to this restaurant with a friend during Montreal a Table. The food was pretty well executed, nothing out of the ordinary for a french restaurant, though. I had Morue as a main dish, it came with a bed of mash potatoes and they had brussel sprouts on top. Some of them were crispy and caramelized. I had the creme brulee for dessert, little bit thick than usual but still delicious."

/user_details?userid=DG7fYMcTdl0OE6B2mRfqMA,John S.,"Falls Church, VA",3 star rating,"Although the food is still very good at Au Petit Extra, I found the service in my latest visit to be less than welcoming and not up to their usual standard.  When my friends asked for English help with the menu the server was rather crass and unfriendly.  He accused me of ""not paying attention"" as he went through and explained each item.  I told him I spoke enough French to understand the menu and he suggested I should have walked my friends through all the items!  Okay, fine, but my French may not be ""that"" good.When the food came out it was basically ""dropped"" without any followup at all from the waiter on whether we enjoyed the food or if we wanted anything else.  He only asked about the food when it came time for the check.  It was a very slow night with only about 20-25 diners.Not the best, not the worst, but with so much competition in Montreal, I may not be back."

/user_details?userid=yHaKyHVTuOZiWPKj7nqiPQ,Jacqueline A.,"Miami, FL",4 star rating,"I dined here a couple months ago and overall I was quite pleased with my experience. It's a somewhat casual Parisian style restaurant/bistro which is refined yet unpretentious. If you're used to French dining in the US you'll be surprised at how casual and economical the food is here, in spite of the excellent quality.The service was good, despite our limited French and the hostess's limited English, and the food was also quite good for this hemisphere. It wasn't quite as exquisite as similarly rated restaurants in Paris, but that's Paris.  Montreal isn't Paris, despite some illusions to the contrary. A similar restaurant in Paris is also quite a bit more expensive.The foie gras was of good quality, in a decent presentation. It wasn't quite as good as Parisian foie of the same price, but what is?I had a fish dish I really liked, although I can't recall the specifics now. I believe it was salmon in a fresh, crisp tasting green pea puree with some green vegetables like asparagus. The treatment was delicate and delicious and it was quite varied and maximal in terms of flavor.My companion's venison was also very nice, although it wasn't as inventive as my dish.The finer details are again escaping me, but I do recall that the raspberry topped dessert we enjoyed was also quite good. The wine was probably the worst value in the place, but most restaurants make their money on wine and the prices for wine in Montreal seem to be rather high overall, whether retail or restaurant.The pricing is Very reasonable; for a similar meal in the US you'd usually pay about twice what we did. That's partially because French food is viewed as a rare luxury in the US, but also because dining prices are quite cheap in Quebec, at least in Montreal. Yay for low prices, especially if they are caused partly because of separatist, secessionist idiots. :p The economy in Quebec has been in a downward spiral since the 80's because of this, while the rest of Canada has been doing fine. It translates to good prices in Quebec, especially on dining, even with the high tax rate and the high Canadian dollar.  :)This place is definitely worth a visit if you're staying somewhat nearby and if you like or are curious about French food."

The menu is prettty much exactly what you`d expect to find similar French restaurants around town. The food tasted OK. It wasn`t bad, but it wasn`t great either. I had the bavette (steak) and a cake for dessert. They messed up the cooking of the steak (they got two out of four right at our table) and took a little while to bring it back.The service was also just OK. Not terrible but also not particularly helpful. I will not go back with all of the options in Montréal and would not recommend it to anyone."

The moment I walked in I knew this place was going to be good (not touristy, mostly locals who look like they know what's up, or tourists who know what's up, any way overall good vibe.) Au Petit Extra met and went beyond my expectations. Dare I say, my dinner companions were impressed with my killer food instinct to have chosen this place. I would love to go back there."
/user_details?userid=s_ushMFjAYjIvszJW2gOhQ,Jessica E.,"Wilmington, DE",5 star rating,"I highly recommend this restaurant for a delicious French meal and enjoyable night out.  For my entree I ordered the smoked pork (porc fumée) and the inside of the meat was juicy and delicious.  The pork was served over pineapple chutney and was accompanied by coleslaw and some sweet potato slices that were somewhere between baked and fried.  Each Entree comes with soup or salad as well.  There was plenty of food!  The entrees (Or Les Plats) cost between $17 and $23, which seems more than reasonable for the quality of the food and the amount that you receive.In terms of drinks, they only appeared to have wine by the bottle and there did not seem to be much selection in the way of beer.  They had a full bar, so I imagine they could make cocktails upon request.  The menu was completely in French, but our server spoke English quite well and was more than willing to help us.  The dining area has a nice ambiance and a classy feel.  My experience here was quite enjoyable.  Definitely check out Au Petit Extra!"

Our waitress was sweet, helping us pick a wine we'd enjoy and navigating us through the menu. The food was incredible. My boyfriend had the Monkfish with Squid Ink, which was beautifully presented and delicious. I had the steak, which was the most buttery and flavorful flank I've ever tasted.

Very, very French and the best meal I've had in Montreal so far. The best meal I've had in five years for sure. Fresh, perfectly cooked, succulent, um, um what other words for culinary perfection can I think of? I can remember the complex yet light flavors of a chicken rolled with spinach, pine nuts, fresh herbs and some glorious sauce that my discerning palate could not fully place.  It was as if the chicken had fallen asleep on perfect bed, rolled around in mouth-watering deliciousness and awoke to make an appearance on my plate and was quite happy to do so. Thank you chicken. Au Petit Extra may be the city's best kept secret. Southeast of the Plateau where I live it was worth the cab fare, despite the strange location across from a gas station.

Funnily enough, Au Petit Extra reminds me more of the ""Parisian bistros"" you find in New York rather than Paris but it looks authentic enough and, more importantly, it's got the food to back it up. With its large gilded mirrors, huge blackboard menus, and lots of wood, it looks like the dictionary definition of a bistro.  All in all, I'd say it's as good as the more famous L'Express but far easier to get a table (I've gone twice sans reservation). The steak frites are particularly good."

/user_details?userid=KQ9nwr-j-23a-CSzg0shgw,Trisha K.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"We found this place on Yelp when looking for ""French, cheap and nom"" and it exceeded my expectations. My first impression was relief, when our host, and our server were both friendly, and willing to speak English even though we had our  translator crib notes in hand. (which don't help much when people speak back to you in French) I also enjoyed the casual simple but elegant atmoshpere. Not too loud or bright, but not too stuffy either. My husband and I both decided to go the Prix Fixe menu for $35 (only thirty-five dollars!!)  assuming that French and cheap would never fill up our athlete's tummys, and we would need all 3 courses.   I started with the sweetbreads, which are a rare treat considering the caloric disaster, and The Mister had Salmon Carpaccio, both were giant heaps of nom. The sweetbreads were well worth the calories! so rich, but well balanced with a julienne veg that I couldn't place. For the Second course, I had the Smoked Pork with Pinneaple curry chutney and then I died of happy.  I think my husband had steak and frites but I was too abosrbed in my porc  fumee to care. One of my most memorable bites EVER. Dessert was Fraises de pepe, and I couldn't find a translation for this, but it was fresh strawberries with some sort of liquor tasting a bit like anisette and gernous black pepper. Not a combination I would have expected but it was so fresh after my rich dinner, that I'm glad I didn't know what it was when I ordered.  perfect ending. oh- The Mister had chocolate something that he wouldn't share, as his first chocolate something in almost 6 months. He said it was lovely.  This meal was perfect combination of deliciousness, and I still can't believe we only spent $100 (with a glass of wine and coffee on top. )  We had to walk for an hour to ward off the over stuffed tummies. In the category of French, cheap and nom, I vote for Au Petit Extra."

Was visiting from NYC and wanted an authentic, reasonably priced dinner. Really glad we got to try it! We showed up on a Saturday night w/o reservations. The place was busy but not packed. We were warmly greeted by service and the waitress was kind enough to translate the French menu to English. My mom went with the smoked pork dish and I had the duck confit. We were very impressed with the smoked pork dish! Extremely full of flavor and tender. My duck was also very good and the salad it came with was fresh. A pleasant dining experience and would highly recommend it if you're looking for a nice, but not overly fancy pretentious place. The only complaint I have is that the food did take a while to come out but was worth the wait!"
