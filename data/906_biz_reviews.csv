/user_details?userid=l9fGOqjEQDEN10Pog3cMng,Xena W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Lola Rosa is one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal.  Their menu is entirely vegetarian, but almost all items can be made vegan on request. Their desserts are mostly vegan. They have a wide range of international foods on their menu. Everything comes in satisfying portions and tastes great. Service is also very friendly.Entree: sweet potato quesadilla with rice and salad. The quesadilla can be made vegan on demand. It was topped with a cheezy sauce and stuffed with fresh avocado and a spicy sweet potato puree. Dessert: vegan chocolate and caramel pie on a pecan and puffed rice crust. The pie was soooo creamy, rich and decadent. I haven't had a chocolate-based dessert in ages and this definitely hit the spot."

I enjoyed everything I ordered, and portions were very fair. Only thing to note is that the poutine is topped with about 20 mini mushrooms (not a mushroom fan!) and so beware if you don't like mushrooms. Staff was very friendly and helpful."
/user_details?userid=XODoytYipc9zy6Wx9MnebQ,Alice A.,"Sacramento, CA",4 star rating,All vegetarian menu??Why I did not discover this place sooner is what I ask myself as I stayed in Double Tree Hotel right next door!This is a cute little restaurant with table and bar seats inside and outdoor tables! They have lots of vegan friendly options and the mixed drinks look and taste delicious! (Non-alcoholic available!)I ordered the tomato pie and it is practically a size of a pizza. Tasted like pizza except the crust was crumbly and reminiscent of buttery croissant!Definitely will return with friends and dine here again when I am in town!
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I absolutely love this location of Lola Rosa in the heart of the city center! As I lean more into plant based eating for health benefits, Lola Rosa is Mecca of  Vegetarian and Vegan dishes. This location has 3 floors, 2 which are usually used. The bathroom is located on the 3rd which is a bit of a bum. There may be a slight wait if you don't make reservations but not too bad. You will be seated at desk-like tables with drawers filled with letters from past visitors, such a great way to remain mindful, appreciative and present. I think I found my favourite meal to order here, the sweet potato quesadillas with rice and salad. Always hits home as a winner and it is very filling ! The cocktails are nice too. Service is great. All in all -a fave!"
/user_details?userid=p_eViZiZwmE7R0FJnsZQDw,Victor U.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Stopped at Lola Rosa on Sainte Catherine for a quick bite for a late snack. My friend and I each took the poutine with braised mushrooms. We also shared the falafel.The poutine has a deep brown flavourful that did not make it look too appetizing, and it was also heavily salted. There is no cheese on this poutine, which I figured since this restaurant is vegan.I would come back to this restaurant to try something else, but definitely not the poutine."
/user_details?userid=NZMcnwHhSNqDjUdABIeUcg,Nicole L.,"Gatineau, Canada",3 star rating,"Really nice atmosphere but the noise level can get a little loud.By the looks of what I saw go by, I think most of their food is very good. Unfortunately I made some bad choices and ended up having a very disappointing meal.First off, I wanted a Chardonnay but they didn't have any so I ordered the Tequilola cocktail.  It was awful and extremely bitter.  THE worst cocktail...Next we ordered their samosas which were OK but bland. The avacado cream helped add some flavor.For my meal I ordered the hemp burger.  It would've been all right if they hadn't overloaded it with this horrific barbecue sauce that had way too much fake smoke flavoring.  The fake smoke flavor was overwhelming and was all you could taste.  Also - It was a small bun for the size of the burger and the bun was completely soggy with this sauce and the whole thing just fell apart in a nanosecond.  Ugh!I did try the chickpea/polenta fries that came with the burger and found them terrific.My husband had the Tunisian stew and really loved it.Our server was outstanding and without being asked, comped my meal because I didn't like it and despite being busy, she was very attentive."
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a second establishment of Lola Rosa that I am trying. Compared to the Milton street one, this Lola Rosa looks nicer and fancier. It was very exciting for me since their menu is 100% vegetarian. The service was top notch. Our waiter was very attentive, helpful and very nice. We started with a pitcher of white sangria with the mix of litchi Soho. It was outstandingly delicious. Then we had nachos topped with black beans, onions, tomatoes, guacamole and cheese. It was 10/10. One of the best nachos I ate after long time. We all had our individual dishes. The hemp burger was excellent; the quesadilla with rice was good but the rice slightly dry, and sweet potatoes samosas was ok (not enough flavors) but the chutney on the side was excellent. Overall, great experience at this Lola Rosa."

/user_details?userid=qmuCid52Y-SaJS_6v2CkNg,Cri C.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Vegan/vegetarian restaurant on Rue Saint Catherine. Big and spacious with split level seating. Plenty of tables available on a Saturday night - unlike the other location closer to McGill. Very spacious and clean, and with high ceilings.I got the vegetarian samosas with avocado creme, petite vegetarian poutine (you can get vegan cheese), a ginger/jalapeno/tequila cocktail and the key lime vegan dessert - with aquafaba meringue.My favorite things were the cocktail and the dessert. The mushroom gravy on the poutine was tasty and the portion was quite large, not sure how big the regular size is?! The samosas were aite but I wasn't blown away, the avocado creme enhanced them though. The people at the table next to me got the fried cauliflower (which looked amazing) and the daily soup. I think I'd try those it I were to return again.Staff were all friendly. Good dining experience."
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"I Came here with a friend after work for a drink and some dinner and we really enjoyed it ! We shared a pitcher of red sangria 28$, the pitcher was huge and the sangria was one of the best I've had in a long time , perfect for a summer evening ! we shared the poutine with mushroom gravy which was delicious and soooo tasty ! Then had the burrito with goat cheese rice and salad . The rice was a little hard and dry and seemed like someone just dumped a bunch of random spices into it that didn't really go together BUT the salad was very fresh with a nice light tasty dressing and the burrito was so full of flavour , black beans , creamy avocado sauce , goat cheese and lots of veggies it was definitely satisfying comfort food and so huge I can safely say we didn't leave hungry. The location has indoor and outdoor seating , nice trendy decor , it did get a little loud but still not too loud to prevent conversation. The staff was very friendly and super efficient and the prices were super affordable and reasonable. Definitely coming back here !"
/user_details?userid=ElvZiBpFMVqoZSXBBYu9VQ,Erik H.,"Denver, CO",4 star rating,"This place was quite enjoyable. Adorable and set in an older building, it definitely had its quirks. But the service and the food was very good. I ordered the burrito. Simply burrito on the menu. Nothing to change or add. My group said the beers they offered were very good but I cannot speak for them.When the food arrived, everything was presented spectacularly. It almost looked too good to eat. Straight out of some marketing campaign on television where they show you what looks amazing but is flat and tasteless when you open the package. Not this place.The taste was very good as well. The pilaf was a little on the bland side and the waitress warned us of it being very a little on the spicy side. It was spicy, but only on a 1-2 scale. Maybe medium spicy.But it was all well prepared. The restaurant was well decorated and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this place."
/user_details?userid=aEdwKSzDnHIadYuWya5y_A,Jay M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We went on a weekend evening and it is definitely one of the places of choice for a great dinner. Food:We went for Red Sangria and Mango Jito for drinks, followed by Tartare appetizer, Tomato Pie and Yellow Curry (served over a bed of rice and a wheat flatbread + avocado mayo) for mains and concluding with Maple Cake dessert. Red Sangria was very good. Mango Jito was good butn wasn't really mangoey. Tartare had a really good presentation. While the dish was nice overall, it lacked acidity which gives the punch to the bite. I would have liked to have a bit of lime in that. Tomato Pie was really good. The puff pastry was great and the pie stuffing was amazing too. However, the star of the meal, for me, was the Yellow Curry. Flat-bread was a bit unnecessary and wasn't soft either, so they may have removed it altogether. However, the curry was absolutely brilliant - great spice blend and subtle creaminess of coconut milk. The rice was good. The avocado mayo brought a good freshness to the curry - great complement. Maple Cake was the daily special (not on the menu) and really good. Not heavy or sugary. Really well made and a perfect conclusion to the meal. Ambiance: The ambiance is great. Plenty of lighting and space across the floors. It was a rush hour when we got there but still managed to find the table in no time. Service and Staff:Service was good and fast. The lady was friendly and explained the menu items where we had questions very well. Even gave some suggestions. Overall, it's a very good place for a vegan meal and recommended even for dates."
/user_details?userid=riBSZ1KXcVQ8iTfERWBnqw,Atia A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I really loved this place, and the environment inside. We had a table beside the glass window and the view was really nice. Compared to the Milton Street one, this place was fancier. I ordered ""Yellow Curry"" that came with rice. Initially I was little disappointed with the dish since it did not really looked like curry. It looked more like salad with rice, and the portion was not enough for one person as well. But it taste really good and very different than usual taste of curry. It was not much spicy, so someone who doesn't like much spicy food can definitely try it. Stuffs were really nice and friendly. Overall, it was a good experience."
/user_details?userid=rR6_a8541lEqSjFpHxsdoQ,Concepts E.,"Hamilton, Canada",4 star rating,"This was such a great meal experience! Went with the family and everyone found something that they loved. Quality: fresh flavours. Interesting variety of dishes and great ingredients.Service: despite the chaos of the festival outside of their doors, the staff are patient, so friendly, and very efficient. Tables are ready for your reservation and realistic turn around time is shared. Food came to the table quickly and satisfaction was assured from the server who visited often to ask.Price: very reasonable for what you are ordering. I cannot wait to return and recommend this restaurant."

The portions were generous and the presentation was mouthwatering. As for the taste, it was heavenly ! This was probably one of the best vegan burgers I've ever eaten.The waiters were all very friendly and courteous. We ate on the terrace but the inside was clean and charming.It was an enjoyable visit and I would totally recommend this place !"

It was our first time the trying a completely plant based meal and it was great! Nachos are a must! They speak English too so no language barriers here. Also really cool mocktails!

Loved the ambiance of the restaurant the staff member was very friendly. We ended up getting the nachos, poutine and soup of the day (cream of potato and onions). Everything was delicious! I would highly recommend this place as it has vegan and gluten free options, along with other hearty meals."
/user_details?userid=wNfopdLMKtQhuQwunHDdOg,Paula G.,"St. Louis, MO",4 star rating,"The. Maple. Cake.The most delicious thing I have eaten, FOR SURE.I am not from Montreal, but I came here for dinner with family. The service was excellent and the restaurant  super cute and hip. Excellent for any occasion.Started out the night with white sangria (delicious but not very strong).Ordered the vegan poutine and crispy cauliflower for appetizers (both are delicious but the crispy cauliflower takes 1st place)I shared the curry and the sweet potato quesadilla. The curry was my favorite, quesadilla could have used a little more bang.To reiterate, because it truly deserves it, the maple cake is unbeatable.If I am ever back in Montreal, I would definitely come back."
/user_details?userid=7wrPUBr_xc7NHvuPMKiRjQ,Nurjahan B.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Such a cute and warm place !! I loved the decorations and the waitress was super friendly with us. She kept on coming back and asking us if everything was ok I liked the service a lot. We first started off by ordering the nachos as snacks and it was legit the BOMB ohmygodddd it was sooo good and tasty and it was filled with toppings plus the give guacamole for free (it's part of the topping) the cheese on the nachos aren't regular vegan cheese (which are pretty nasty in my opinion) it's super tasty cheese I really liked it. And then came our food my friend got the strawberry and asparagus salad which we both liked because the dressing was tasty. I got the black bean burger and this is where the four stars come in; unfortunately I hated the burger I did not like the patty at all usually black bean burger are my favourite I always get them at other vegan restaurants but this one was really not up to my taste. But they served it with fries which were really good and salad. Overall my experience was good here most of the food was tasty I just wish I ordered something else :)

/user_details?userid=fcezuzF1WIbHpZciy4MTKw,A M.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"C'est tres bien! This is a vegetarian's dream. Such a creative menu. I stopped in last night at another location and was so impressed with my meal and menu options that I came back today. I may even be back tomorrow. So many great items that it's hard to pick just one. I am so glad they have a vegetarian poutine option. I actually opted to make it vegan and was impressed. The Cajun burger was my choice today and it didn't disappoint. The onion rings on there are a nice touch. If you're vegetarian and visiting Montreal, this place is a must!!!"
/user_details?userid=nzs_FcNdble0rY1equ0ukw,Tommy L.,"Pleasantville, NY",5 star rating,"All-around great experience at Lola Rosa! My partner and I went for the large vegetarian selection  and it completely exceeded our expectations. The service was great and the drinks were amazing as well (highly recommend the Sangria Orange). For appetizer, we split the Crispy Cauliflower which was delicious (we could've eaten way more of it!). For dinner, I got the yellow curry and my partner got the spinach lasagna--both were so good, we would easily eat it again! Definitely recommend!"
/user_details?userid=EtELvyDjyDggwtcmSImfaA,Steph B.,"Long Beach, CA",5 star rating,"This place was delicious. The service was exceptional even through a hiccup of spilled drinks. I would definitely recommend going here if you are in Montreal. And if you are lucky enough to have Claire and Tomas as your servers you are in great hands. They were both so personable that the whole experience was a pleasure. Plus the manager on duty, a woman whose name I sadly cannot recall, was also great! This team of folks made the night great.P. S. We got the hemp burgers and Cajun burgers which were phenomenal. The fries are ridiculously good too. Plus Tomas recommended the Lola Rose to drink which was great. Pro tip: ask for hot sauce. It's exceptional."

/user_details?userid=0FKf9_Mc5d9ATO1bN-xl2g,Laura M.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"The BEST VEGAN POUTINE in Montreal. I honestly could have eaten like 2 bowls for my meal. I also had nachos, however, which were great as well. The service was great too."
/user_details?userid=FXu1BTvGx9FmqJXPoQoXsQ,Alex M.,"Alhambra, CA",5 star rating,"Came with a group of 7 (including 2 toddlers) and I found this restaurant very kid friendly. It was spacious to sit along the booth with the highchairs and there was even room to put our strollers.  The young ones particularly enjoyed the roasted cauliflower, chick pea fries and cheese quesadilla. The Tunisian stew was full of flavour and the tomato pie was unique with a delicious flaky pastry crust. The mango mocktail and triple berry mocktail was fruity and refreshing and at only $4 each you can't go wrong. The atmosphere was busy but not loud and the server was attentive and friendly. Will be back again."
/user_details?userid=F7vcrApf-w_L4XquDBkDOQ,Jessica E.,"Albany, NY",5 star rating,"Many weeks since I've returned from Montreal and I'm still thinking about the vegan Caesar salad at Lola Rosa. Creamy tangy dressing, small cut romaine so the dressing permeated every literal square cm, house made tiny crunchy croutons, and the coup de grace - the salty, sweet and crunchy rice paper bacon! Apparently they brush rice paper sheets with soy sauce and then roast and crinkle them up. It's pure genius. Also good beer list. Definitely going to make this place a must-stop now when I'm back in town. YUM."
/user_details?userid=bJfhh1SbwlfWfXkhfoy1CA,Jeff R.,"Athens, OH",5 star rating,"They were really busy (a good sign), and we went near closing, so it took a bit to get a server, but the food was outstanding. My Tunisian ragout made the wait worth it. The servers were really friendly and our server gave us free drinks because we had to wait."
/user_details?userid=GnJ2w63izmrICmt1wNCGOA,Laurence V.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been to Lola Rosa before and really enjoyed my experience. However, they just opened this new location and I love how easily accessible it is now. The place is great, spacious, there's a terrace outside and yet even though it's modern, they kept their wooden desk-like tables where you can slip notes in the drawers. One thing I noticed is that the menu was a bit different in each locations, which is pretty great because you get to try something new every time but still get to eat their popular dishes! For someone who isn't vegan, this place made me not miss meat. For a table of 5, we shared 2 sangria pitchers which were delicious and affordable. We also shared the nachos which are always great although sometimes they put too much beans and the chickpea fries which were okay. I had the tartare which was different and really refreshing! Never had a vegan tartare and it was not disappointing. Also, I find that when I order tartare at a restaurant, I never get enough croutons and they gave me the perfect amount for the size of my dish. I tried my friend's yellow curry main dish and it was delicious and I love the spice. For dessert, we shared a strawberry crumble which was pretty ordinary. The service was okay, there was only 2 waiters and although the restaurant wasn't full, we found ourselves looking for our waiter a lot. Overall, this new Lola Rosa location in Place des Arts is great. Despite the minor mishaps, I still think this place deserves a 5 star and I would come back!"
/user_details?userid=xjZOqBiFoIk4YLNv7QTgVA,Bader H.,"Pierrefonds, Canada",5 star rating,"So this is a review from someone who's not vegan or vegetarian. The service here is impeccable and that's the reason it gets a full 5 out of 4 stars. The food was really good, we ordered the cauliflower bites appetizer which was amazing and then the quesadillas, which were pretty good. Definitely would come back here to try out more from their menu."
/user_details?userid=4bP86EzvAa0sfaxrYW5_BA,Milena P.,"Buckingham, PA",5 star rating,"I think this just may be my favorite meal ever! In 27 years of veg! We first went to a location in a university neighborhood, and the wait was too long, and since I was determined to get to a healthy meal in me, my boyfriend was kind enough to agree to try the new Catherine St. location so we walked over there. It was not packed though it had enough of a crowd, and we were seated in less than 10 minutes. My boyfriend loved the poutine, and I thought my taste of fries was great but miniscule , because every fry had gravy, and that was off limites to me due to food allergies. Soon the  main course came and they were both melt in your mouth fantastic. We had the tomato tarte - roasted tomatoes with herbes, carmelized onions on puff pastry, and the Tunisian stew- rich, complex and filling. My only complaint was that there was more rice than stew.  Sadly since there is no Lola Rosa - that I know of at least - south of the border, we have attempted to make these at home, to pretty good success. But I realize that the subtleties of French cooking have taken these dishes over the top, so it's time for me to learn vegetarian Frech cooking. Yep, that inspired. Thanks Lola Rosa, see you after the winter!"
