I chose the 1 flavor bowl (volcano) while hubby went with the two flavor (volcano and garlic). Both were delish, the barley was super yum, and the veggies were fresh. Light but filling meal - recommended!!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Got the spicy chicken bowl. You can choose the kind of chicken you want with 5 toppings. The spicy chicken was perfectly marinated but wasn't really spicy. I got the bowl with a side of avocados and tatziki. The mix was pretty good, although the rice were a bit bland and it didn't mix well with the spicy mayo. The place is pretty clean and they have free wifi. The staff were very nice and made recommendations."
/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Ordered the XL bowl late one night when was craving a light but filling meal. The chicken is full of flavour, super delicious and filled with fresh ingredients and sauces! The only downside was that for the XL bowl, I expected something larger for the price but it was just a standard size. However, I would still order from them again as they are open 'til very late and best of all, it's HALAL!"
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"I'd never tried this place before because I never bothered to figure out how the menu worked. Basically it's like a poke bowl but with chicken. You order the size you want, how many toppings you want, and how spicy you want your chicken. Then you continue down the counter and you add your bases (rice or quinoa, vegetables, sauces, etc). They add the chicken at the end on top.I got the small size, mild chicken, corn, olives, extra avocado, rice, and lettuce.The chicken was a bit dry but the rest of the bowl was great! I do think the olives were a bit too salty so I wouldn't get those again. The child size bowl was perfect for my appetite!I'd go back on one of my lunch breaks from school."

This is your typical bowl with a variety of veggies, protein and rice. I can't remember what I ordered, but the chicken tasted flavorful, juicy and tender, reminded of BBQ-ing on a hot summer day.

/user_details?userid=aruyiAQOctm4MH2zJUw3Qg,Sam E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Highly suggest to try this place if you're debating it!Such an amazing fresh healthy/yummy spot! In my top few restaurants in Montreal of the best ratio in quality-price and equally healthy as it is yummy. I love that you can customize salads, bowls with any base, poutines, such a great concept. I've only eaten one time months ago in their resto which was clean and friendly, and many orders on uber eats that were all perfectly done without mistakes.  The chicken is so so good and the marinate is incredible, I love the shisha (garlic) but it's all I've tried, I'm sure they're all amazing :)"

I've ordered their Poutine on New Year's eve for the first time and I came back on-site a week after for the Bowl. I recommend Poulet Rouge to everyone, the food ordered is done really fast and you can put everything you want in it.I always take the Volcano Chicken flavor, but I'd like to try the other ones someday. It's just that I like going with my sure value."
/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"I got takeout at Poulet Rouge and the food was great, but the dude was mean to me :(So it was my first time there and I didn't really understand how it worked. There was a kiosk where you could order and not have to talk to a person, but I figured I'd order at the counter since I might have questions. I didn't really see any detailed instructions on the wall and there wasn't even a full menu, just some menu options as far as I could tell. I knew I wanted to build my own chicken salad, so that's what I ordered ($11.89). The guy was super impatient with me. I didn't know what types of chicken they had. He listed them for me like it was a huge bother. Then he asked me ""what kind of salad do you want?"" And so I asked how many toppings do I get? And he said ""you get 5 toppings, but you have to chose your salad!"" I was confused. Then he said ""the all-dressed is this and this and this and this"" and he pointed to the romaine, kale, spinach and dried cranberries. I said ""ok, I'll have that."" I didn't know I had to choose a salad base because I thought the salad base was just lettuce. It wasn't even busy, so I don't know why he was impatient and mean to me. Whatever, maybe he was having a bad day. Anyway, I got the Lemon Chicken. I think they call it the ""Hercules."" For my 5 toppings I got the bean mix (chickpeas, dark red kidney beans, I think black-eyed peas, and some sort of white beans), green peppers, cheese, beets and cucumbers. I got the cilantro-lime dressing, on the side. I usually don't like cilantro, but for some reason I like cilantro-lime rice and cilantro-lime salad dressings. The salad looked a bit small at first but it was really filling. I was so full afterwards. The chicken was delicious. Nicely seasoned with garlic and lemon. And I liked that it was lean breast meat. And real meat, not processed meat with corn and soy and other fillers mixed in. I did bite into a few pieces of cartilage, but at least not bone. The salad ingredients were fresh and I liked the different textures of the different ingredients. The salad dressing was really flavourful, but a bit too oily. I used less than a fifth of what they gave me. I'm so happy I got the dressing on the side. I liked that the guy wore gloves when he was making my salad (and not wearing gloves when he took my money). The guys at the grill use tongs to put the chicken from the grill onto your salad, so no one touches your food with bare hands. I liked this.Would have been 4 stars if the guy was nicer to me."
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I ordered a rouge bowl XL that I created myself through Uber eats. I didn't expect much and was pleasantly surprised when the food arrived in 30 min and was so delicious!!I like that you can order predesigned bowls or create your own. I was able to select two different types of chicken so I got the spicy chicken and the shisha chicken which is basically garlic chicken. The bowl includes four chicken fillets. The spicy kitchen has a kick but isn't too spicy. You have the choice of 7 toppings so I picked kale, spinach, mixed beans, corn, jalapeño, bell peppers, Kalamata olives. I added cherry tomatoes from my fridge. I also added avocado purée and spicy mayo.You also have the choice between brown rice, bulgur wheat and quinoa. The quinoa costs $0.90 more. All in all I thought it was delicious. Personally I would have preferred more kale/spinach and less bulgur. If I had been there personally I probably could have asked for more greens. Also the menu said mixed beans but I only saw black beans in the bowl. I liked the XL because I was able to keep some for lunch tomorrow. For $1.70 more you might as well get the bigger size!!I will definitely order from here again!"

The sides comes in nice quantity at an affordable price. Service is quick and perfect when I'm in a rush.Also, it's located right next to Concordia. I'll be coming to this place pretty much everyday at lunch. ps: it smells awsome on your office table and makes all your colleagues want to try it haha."

/user_details?userid=ARFM4LrI_zxogm1L29ZKng,Farrah B.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"""Wandering hungry"" is a sad situation when you're in an unfamiliar place. Mind you, we hadn't eaten since 11:00 a.m. and it was nearing 11:00 p.m.  An attempt in the opposite direction was full of greasy meat and burgers, so, we went back to our starting point and in the opposite direction down St. Catherine (a very long street).  We ran into Adam on the sidewalk, who answered all of our questions about the 'red chicken' restaurant.  So he invited us in and we were so excited for choices.  I ordered the garlic chicken with brown rice, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers, grilled onions and the two mediterranean style sauces. The bf went with the bbq bowl just as pictured with a fountain drink. For just about $28CAD, all of this together with tax, Poulet Rouge was the best deal of the night.  As for me, I appreciated the freshly cooked and prepared, healthy options after 9pm."

The BBQ fusion flavour is a go-to if you don't know which flavour to choose. For around 10$, you get a good portion of chicken and depending on what dish you get, you can choose 2 or more toppings and sauce. The place is clean and sleek, the staff are super friendly and the food is good and worth the price."
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"Reasonably priced food with good portion size . I had a Hercules salad which comes with grilled herb and lemon chicken with salad containing tomato ,black olive, feta onion , kale and an extra of avocado. The chicken was very juicy and tasty and the ingredients were fresh. The only thing that I didn't like was that there was barely any kale in the salad and there were wayyyy too many onions. However the food was fresh, sensibly priced and filling Portion sized , I would gladly eat from here again and I would recommend it to others for a casual lunch."
/user_details?userid=JrTsaMac8BnAkLuJ3MfGzA,Aileen L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"ATMOSPHERE: Clean little fast food spot near Concordia. Perfect for students.FOOD: The food was delicious, especially for a fast food spot. Another plus side is that this is considered to be a ""healthier"" option in terms of fast foods. I had the Rouge bowl with rice and spicy chicken and it was quite good. I will definitely be coming back here when I'm in the area and need a quick bite.PRICE: Prices are very affordable. Average price is about 10$. Quality is pretty good and taste as well. You definitely get a bang for your buck here.SERVICE: The staff was friendly. When I told them about a ""bloody"" chicken piece that I had, they were very accommodating and were happy to replace it with 2 additional pieces."
/user_details?userid=r6PbQjtij6gcalYWBBrILg,Maria B.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Was starving late after work and saw this place come up on my Uber eats and figured I'd give it a go. The chicken from this restaurant is amazingly juicy and tender! My order had several varieties of the chicken and each one was delicious. I had gotten the Hercules bowl which was a lemon and hen chicken with pepper onions tomato tzatziki  and feta cheese. All of it was pretty decent sized portion. One small complaint On my order I had requested the bulgar be replaced by quinoa and paid a 1$ extra for that and I didn't get that other the that the plate was great and because it's open late it's a great opportunity to have much healthier food options  when there aren't all that many late at night.
/user_details?userid=5eo31UtyDwHr7jtraT6gTg,Jay A.,"Vaughan, Canada",2 star rating,"To be honest, the food was just smothered in sauce, gravy, and pickled vegetables -- good for a late night eats. We used Uber Eats which is great, but they forgot our drinks. We called the Uber guy, who told us the restaurant didn't give him the drinks... so we called the restaurant, who told us that the Uber dude got the drinks. Either way, we paid Uber and didn't get our damn drinks. The restaurant said they'd send another delivery out to us, but we never heard back from them. Frustrating -- cause can you imagine thinking you got pickles, but in reality, they're PICKLED JALAPEÑOS -- and your motherf'ing drinks didn't get delivered?Never again, poulet rouge, never again!"
/user_details?userid=xDg4gp_oBUudXbZz31yf-A,Helena U.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Had a greasy food craving at 11pm. We stumbled upon this place. We ordered the poutine with chicken by using the Casa deal app. It cost us around 10$ included tax. You have the choice of adding 2 toppings on your poutine. The server recommended us the corns and sweet onions. They served a pretty good portion. We shared. Really good, the chicken was tender and they grilled them fresh in front of you. I was so glad i got to try this new place. Thank you for satisfying my cravings :)"

/user_details?userid=RIM6BfaP7ex_AYzd6UemqA,Khalil P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is a new place that just opened on Ste-Catherine right next to Concordia. You first choose your type of dish and I got the poutine then you choose your flavour and I got spicy. The service was good and students get a 10% discount. What's good is that you get to add as many toppings as you want to your dish which makes it even better. The grilled chicken was really good, the fries can be crispier in my opinion but overall the taste of the poutine was really good. There's also some seating too. Overall it is a good place in a great location and I'll come back to try something else."

/user_details?userid=pmgo9Fznw9rP9l2pblHTZg,Brytan M.,"Bristow, VA",5 star rating,"This is one of my favourite places for take-out/delivery Downtown. Super close to Concordia and always packed when I have walked by. This is a bright, clean restaurant, but I always order delivery, so I can't speak to the vibe inside. If you are relatively health conscious, then you will appreciate the chicken, brown rice, and tasty veggies, all packed into one of the best bowls out there. I got the BBQ Fusion Chicken twice and the Volcano Chicken once. The BBQ Fusion is definitely the move at Poulet Rouge! For some reason I didn't get the XL, but YOU SHOULD get XL. This is a great dish to have leftover for lunch the next day. Max it out and get extra chicken fillet (2 extra should be good), because the base amount is lacking. My vegetarian roommate was jealous of how good this smelled when I opened it in our apartment! It is one of THOSE meals. I like to add the pita crisps for some extra crunch and corn for sweetness! The total price on UberEats usually comes out just shy of $20 so expect to pay low to mid-teens for food. Great pick for just arrived travellers and anyone looking for great late night food that travels/delivers well and won't turn your hotel room or shirt into a mess."

Would be nice to have more options like white rice and classic options for people who are not so much into bulgur, quinoa, etc."

They cater towards a healthier meal and they deliver. You would think healthy would decrease taste to some extent but not this place. Their dish was absolutely delicious!!

I wish they would offer more chicken options and include some beef as well. You can even order at the self-service kiosks and save some time communicating your preference to the staff."
