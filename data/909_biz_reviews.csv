/user_details?userid=2PURk5LF8GG6i7lBPA6slQ,Ashley P.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,This restaurant is very modern and the atmosphere is very up beat. The service was excellent and the chef was very friendly. The food was absolutely delicious and I haven't had anything like it. The poached eggs with smoked salmon on the bagel was the best thing I ever had. The poached egg was perfectly cooked and presented. The potatoes on the side were bursting with flavor and cooked effortlessly. The bursting crepe was very well put together and literally bursting strawberries!! It is a huge crepe so make sure to be hungry when arriving there. I definitely recommend for brunch !!!

/user_details?userid=yb7-akzavXRXUxr2AqMSHA,S L.,"Arcadia, CA",1 star rating,"This restaurant has terrible customer service and mediocre to terrible food after we compared it with another restaurant within walking distance, which helped confirmed our thoughts of this restaurant.After being given a menu, we waited for 30 minutes before an available waiter is able to take our order. Upon sitting down next to us we noticed an uncleaned table with leftover food and receipt. (That table stayed untouched in the next 1 hour)When the waitress finally came there was no apology, nothing, just a simple question of ""what do you want?""No staff offered us anything to drink, not even water for the next 30 minutes until we asked. We were given glass cups with a minor crack on the rim. Minor but could be dangerous.I ordered an eggwhite omelet but after waiting for another 30 minutes received  a full egg omelet, but that was fixed by the waitress later. The diced potato that came with the omelet tastes sweet and buttery without any seasoning.Overall terrible customer service very mediocre food. We felt ignored by the staff the whole time."
