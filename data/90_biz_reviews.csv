/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Delicious tacos with a lot of variety located right next to peel metro. We got the shrimp ceviche, the al pastor tacos, the cactus tacos, the deep fried tacos with chicken and the chocolate churros. My personal fave is definitely the cactus tacos. It was crunchy, juicy and very flavorful. The al pastor and deep fried tacos were good, but the meat were a bit dry. The waitress warned us that the shrimp ceviche would be very spicy, but it actually wasn't bad. There were only a few slices of spicy red pepper in it. As long as you don't bite into it, it's not really spicy. The churros were warm and soft. The place isn't big but it's nice and cozy. The waitress was nice and patient with us. The location is great. It is in the center of downtown, right next to the peel metro."

Their entrees are very good but there are better tacos and service elsewhere in MTL. Atmosphere is very nice and their menu is pretty interesting. I like that in addition to tacos they have several entrees and soups to choose from. They also have an extensive wine, beer and cocktail list. We ordered their shrimp ceviche, which was really good and spicy. My favorite entree was their traditional Aztec soup, it was absolutely delicious. Don't skip it, it's just $6 and a nice way to start the meal. We went for the Al pastor and fried tempura tacos, both were good but there are better tacos in Montreal.Their churros are very good though! They were hot and fresh and were served dipped in a dulce de leche sauce. Just a note about the service. It was VERY slow, we had to flag the waitress for drinks, to order our meal and then to order dessert and the bill. Also the only time the waitress actually came to our table was to ask me if I wanted a second Marguerita (since happy hour special was second drink half off). The waitress asked me twice and I said no both times. Then she brought me a Marguerita even though I had said no!? I was caught off guard so I accepted the drink but that has never happened to me before."

They were frustrated by many other Montreal restaurants were not providing the authenticity that the cuisine deserves. In fact, famous Anthony Bourdain, often mentions that top-quality Mexican food is the most undervalued, underappreciated world cuisine even though it has tremendous potential and believes people should pay more attention to it, learn more about it, and value it more. Recent surveys shows that New Yorkers pay the least for Mexican, Indian, Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai cuisine but top bills for Japanese... around 70 percent higher than at its Mexican counterparts.As we the team at La Cantina irons the kinks out, adds more decorations and builds the dining experience to the next level, I encourage you to come and support this local business! And if you're planning to host an event, the back room can accommodate up to 60 people and the front roughly another 55... plenty for a wedding or corporate event!"

La cantina is a Mexican restaurant easily accessible by Peel metro. Their food was delicious and varied. We took a lot of dishes since everything sounded so good when our waited explained the menu to us. Finish your meal with a churros is definitely the way to go! My favourites were the pastor tacos, aguachile shrimps and octopus. It is pricey for tacos compared to a Mexican restaurant located in Jean-Talon, but still very good. Good spot for lunch."

The jicama salad was delicious and generous.  The fish tacos order came with three tacos they were very tasty, the waitress was attentive and really nice.I will be back!"

The food was great (I got the poisson frit tacos... so good). One of my friends even said it tasted like home. I also loved the frozen margaritas because they were made with fresh fruit. I'm definitely going back"
