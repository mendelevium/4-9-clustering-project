This location has changed banner so many times in a short period of time that I was really curious to see the different twist that they would be coming up with.I went there on a Friday around noon, the restaurant was empty, the decor is very modern and the service was excellent from the beginning to the end. I ordered from the 26$ table d'h√¥te menu which comes with an entree and a main course, for an additional 9$ I also added an espresso and the dessert of the day which was a tiramisu.I felt it was a nice lunch option, I wasn't wowed by the dishes but they tasted good. I'd have to try their dinner menu to see the difference though. I recommend if you're in the area during lunch."
