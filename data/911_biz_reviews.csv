I initially kiiiiiiiiiind of didn't want to review this place in order to hoard it for myself, but the secret's officially out! I would go so far as to say this is the BEST PIZZA IN THE PLATEAU. The pizza crust has the texture of naan bread, the toppings are top notch and it's not cheese overkill. It's not only the best pizza, but it's also a totally hip, clean and sleek environment to elevate pizza dining to the high end (without the high price of fine dining). They have lovely cocktails, and the meats are prepped right there in their own little on-site charcuterie. You can watch the kitchen staff knead, fling and open fire toast up your pizza before it arrives at your table. Also, I'll have to be honest - I don't like dining with other people's small children and this is hard to avoid in Petit Laurier since there are many, many young families. However, the space or the calm vibe or something else in the air here makes this a complete non-issue. I've eaten here several times with plenty of kids around and it wasn't a circus! I have consistently enjoyed myself. Straight up: I've given up entirely on any other pizza place on Laurier or even Mont Royal in favour of this one."

The location of the restaurant is great. Ambiance 10/10. Service is excellent. We ordered an appetizer and two types of pizza to share between the two of us. Food is delicious. The pizza was fresh out of the oven. Quality of the ingredients are excellent. Would definitely recommend this spot for a date!"

The menu gad just enough options for meat eaters and vegetarians, salad eaters and those looking for dessert- Â and our food was delicious."

Although the original one on Bernard is adorably quaint, it regularly gets extremely busy and you often end up waiting for a table. Plus, it can get cold in the winter with the door continuously opening. This location, on the other hand, serves up the same delicious pizza in a beautiful and slightly more comfortable location. Since we often go out with the kids and newborn, space has become more of a necessity than a luxury. That's one of the reasons we've been enjoying coming to this 900. I also found the staff here delightful and quite efficient. And whoever is in charge of their music selection, did a great job on our last visit! Since 900 has a small menu that doesn't change, I strongly suggest giving their ""pizza du moment"" a try for some diversity. But in all honesty, I don't think you can go wrong here!"
