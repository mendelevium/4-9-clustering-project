There's something soothing about seeing fresh baked goods in a cafe with window seats filled with busy people. I really enjoyed the scones... fresh and made on the spot, couldnt ask for moreThe coffee is great too. I had a cappucino and was pretty surprised how massive the cups were.. even the small ones. Found an old ornate looking arm chair and got to some writing. There was a certain air of lightness here. I'm not sure what exactly it was. A huge family looking table is in the direct center of the space, with some singular seating on the perimeter and next to the huge entrance windows. It was a great place to work, and I feel in time meet people if your that kind of person who meets people that is...... lol.Would love to come back! Hope you have success team+(^~^)+"
/user_details?userid=fbRdDZciw4Y8pgujgbwEMg,Karen L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I love that La Brume dans mes Lunettes does delivery for their afternoon tea sets! It comes with 1 little satchet of tea leaves of your choice (just add hot water to steep it when it arrives), and a variety of sweet and savoury items.The scones were very yummy and hit the spot! The weird thing is that on Uber, when you get this set, there is a required ""add on"" of either a jam or cream and it costs $1. But the set itself already comes with one? So factor in an extra dollar for that required add on. Oh and I ordered this with my boyfriend and one of our sets was missing an item in the box. One of us got a lemon tart and the other didn't. Food was still yummy tho!"
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Behold, the best goddamn scones I've had in my entire life. You think I'm exaggerating, but alas, I am not. As someone who is always up for a baked treat fresh out of the oven (despite my extensive hiatus, I have indeed still been feeding myself), scones were never really up my alley. Perhaps it's because I'm used to eating them à la américain - big, overly dense, and sometimes hard as a rock. Yikes! But upon hearing that La Brume dans Mes Lunettes is essentially the scone dealer of Montréal's wider café scene, I was immediately intrigued. Of course, it doesn't hurt that I am a sucker for a decently-priced and high quality afternoon tea, so it made for a perfect excursion on a gloomy winter day.My friend and I ordered the ""Sa Majesté La Reine"" tea set with a pot of Russian Caravan tea from renowned purveyors Fortnum and Mason; everything was brought out to the tune of La Marseillaise and collective clapping, which was simultaneously hilarious and slightly embarrassing (haha). The bottom tier contained the following items: cucumber sandwiches (a classic that surprisingly tasted better than most I've had thus far), mini Montréal bagels with smoked salmon and cream cheese, and prosciutto puffs with pear and some kind of cheese (an airy bite with light tinges of sweetness). All of the items were lovely, but I especially liked the bagels. It's no secret that I normally possess a strong dislike for Montréal bagels, but this was PERFECT in terms of having a well-rounded flavor profile. I liked how the saltiness of the smoked salmon contrasted with the slight sweetness of the bread - chef's kiss! Then, we moved onto the next tier - the scones, served with crème fraîche and jam. I normally test the quality of an afternoon tea tray using its scones as a litmus, and boy oh boy did these deliver. Still warm despite the fact that we ate the sandwiches first (as one should ;) ), each one was delightful in their own unique way. The cheddar and bacon with green onion was savory without feeling like it should have belonged on the bottom tier. Meanwhile, the plain and lavender + white chocolate scones paired flawlessly with the cream and jam, which I lathered on thick atop each half. All of them were slightly chewy and moist while also being flaky, but not so much that they would become a biscuit. The only thing I would say is that I wish they served clotted cream for that quintessential English tea touch, but that's just me being nitpicky as it's clear that this place serves things with its own slightly Québecois twist. Finally, we reached the dessert tier. I thought the madeleines were a bit overbaked and dry, but they were definitely still edible! The butter tarts with lemon icing were out of this world, and the sweet and rich crust proved to be an ideal opposing force to the edge of the citrus. Full but not stuffed (or maybe it was because I only had a smoothie that day before tea time), my friend and me both thought that it was a perfect food outing complemented by fragrant and not overly strong tea. Overall, La Brume dans Mes Lunettes is a neighborhood gem that I wish were more well-known but also would secretly love to keep on the DL. I ordered a box of the tea we had plus five scones (2 savory, 1 plain, and 2 sweet) to take home. I ate the savory ones the same day... and I may or may not be reaching for a third scone right now... Wish me luck on not eating all of them within a day of purchase! They're that good, trust me on this one!"

They have a nice variety of different teas and lunch/brunch/snacks options. Needless to say you HAVE to try the scones (all home made, moist and so many different flavors..). The salmon bagels, cucumber cheese sandwich, scones were a delight! Strongly recommend! Lots of folks coming to work, read and relax. Very sweet blend of good food and cozy space!"
/user_details?userid=bUPeHBFEINhqiKj9-k4-zA,Charles N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Brightly lit by natural lighting, impressive tall ceilings, and a beautifully designed space, when you step in, you will find a remarkable english tea room with the allure of modern coffee shop that will certainly charm you!The eclectic mix of glazed plywood counters, industrial tables, architects folding lights, wooden & steel draft stools, antique piano, buttoned chairs and tungsten lighting somehow all work well together. In addition to the esthetically pleasing surroundings, a lot of attention was paid to functionality including the availabilities of many conveniently located power outlets where you can plug and charge your laptop or mobile devices. The only odd thing about this place are the paintings - slightly disconnected.I did stop by for a quick brew, made from Kittel coffee beans, which was okay but was served in unique looking jade like mugs. I also couldn't help noticing the homemade sweet and savory creations that came out of this tiny but well equipped kitchen (induction cooktops, mini convection oven, euro size dishwasher...). Everything is made on the spot except for the bread and croissants that come from Guillaume, a fabulous local bakery. This place is barely two months old and will continue to evolve. I'll definitely have to return to indulge in some of the cooking and the unavoidable and time-honored ritual of afternoon tea, complete with silver teapot, fine china, crustless cucumber sandwiches, and Yorkshire pudding -- all at an affordable price of 27$ for two -- amazing!One question remains though: why is this place named ""La Brume dans Mes Lunettes"" - is it because the fog that builds up on eyeglasses when drinking a cup of coffee, is it because of the windows that steam up on chilly fall and winter days, or is it remnants memories of tormented past love stories that still linger?"
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"All your exes and their exes are probably here because there was something beautiful about them that you loved and this place is perfect for soothing beautiful hearts that are lost or looking for love, and it's perfect for first dates or work dates or healing hangs of other kinds as well. Everything except the art is quite perfect. Beautiful furniture, layout and light. Beautiful teas made for the Royal Family, and full tea service with scones if you like. Lemon poppyseed cake like my mom bakes. Hot lunch on the menu, plugs everywhere and free wifi. I didn't have the coffee because I'm happier wrapped around a mug of filter coffee usually, and my heart dropped a bit when I didn't see it on the menu but I asked anyway and the barista said they usually would, then half smiled and said ""Americano won't cut it?"" and I sighed and admitted that no, vraiement pas, and he agreed with my secret heart's opinion that this watery espresso is actually disgusting. Great validation.Calm, beautiful, kindly spot with charming, soft-spoken, unpretentious staff who still make you feel you are in the best of hands. Already full fairly constantly from what I've seen, and with good reason."

Soup was delicious. Prices were great. Very happy with the table service - prompt, friendly, professional. Would recommend and will be returning."
/user_details?userid=QYKYfSNHAkaE4Vf0lNqBFQ,Amanda U.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"Went there on a Tuesday at 09am. Luckily we found available seating as we noted the place tends to fill up quickly. Cozy place to study, to meet a Friend for chitchat. People also came in and out for a order of coffee to go. We stayed from 09-1130, never felt pressured to leave. We went in thinking of ordering their regular menu but noted the sign indicating there is a high tea menu available. It was perfect for 2 people to share and it came with a full pot of tea, price of 30$ taxe included!The funniest thing happened when our order arrived..... along with a loud voice via the speaker announcing its high tea time. Everybody looked at our table and clapped, which is a really funny concept. Really easy to find free parking on the street. Would definitely recommend the place and would return."
/user_details?userid=0goB-Irbm8GGFsPcobs39Q,Olivia S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Adorable little café with a variety of ""high tea"" options and their amazing scones - which they are famous for!! Scones were being made and it just smelled so heavenly the whole afternoon. It has a homey feel to it, with plants atop the refrigerator and wooden tables, and it all just adds to the charm. Perfect little neighbourhood spot to chill with friends or to study."
/user_details?userid=wZPizeBxMAyOSl0M0zuCjg,Jess L.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,"Such a pleasant local coffee shop. It's quirky without being uncomfortable, with a very eclectic yet comfortable feel. The people who work here are bubbly without being obnoxious and are happy to suggest something or make something ""your way."" I only wish this hadn't been a stop in between stops on my adventure in this neighborhood. I could definitely imagine working here for many hours - as it seemed a lot of patrons were doing - or catching up with a friend. Instead, my husband and I downed two espressos in between errands at one of the tables outside. They really did the trick!"
/user_details?userid=qnZkCGvLz6AB5cQN_J_pUA,Jack D.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",4 star rating,"T'was a somewhat rainy afternoon and the boo and I felt like it was a good time to venture out of the apartment and attempt to get some work done. Looked through my trusty list of ""cafes to check out"" and had La Brume marked down. A bonus was that it was somewhat near Marche Jean Talon so we could also drop by there on the way. After picking up a few apples at the market, we continued to La Brume. It seems close enough to the Metro but far enough from crazy foot traffic, allowing a better chance for an open table, which we easily found. The atmosphere is chill and bright, the artwork and decor are strategically placed, not too overwhelming but just sprinkled enough throughout to add plenty of visual interest. The music is lively but not too loud, and the staff are friendly. The place had a bit of a romantic feel to it as well (at least the couple making out across the room seemed to think so). We got a couple Cafe Americanos and shared a cheese scone, all of which were quite tasty. The scone was savory but not too dense, which I liked. The coffee was good enough to drink black. The internet was solid, there was a cute little restroom, and we got our work done without a hitch. If I was a local, I'd come here all the time. But next time I'm in the area and need a spot to chill and get some work done, I'll definitely come back!"
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,From my understanding this is a newish coffee shop in the area.  The space is small but it is very cozy and welcoming.  On the day I came it provided a welcome escape from the cold and rainy weather outside.Since I try to avoid caffeine later in the day I went for a cheddar apple scone and hot chocolate.  The apple cheddar scone was not so great.  It was a little tough and you could barely taste the cheddar.  I actually tasted the walnuts more than the cheese.  The hot chocolate though was on par with other cafes.  Next time I visit I will probably test out the coffee.  The barista also went around the cafe at one point and offered all the customers free apples which was a different and nice touch.
/user_details?userid=QRIzeHyThRsY6_N7r4A4tw,Shaw T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Was initially heading to le vieux velo for brunch until i realized I was walking down st zotique instead of beaubien. It was time for a blitz decision given the -28 windchill hitting me right in the face, so i walked into Brume dans mes Lunettes.  I had the crêpe with gravlax, which consisted of a crêpe (thin French pancake) with an egg, gravlax, and cheese along with some roasted potatoes and a side salad. Also, I had a filter coffee, which i like black. Upon arriving, I was warmly greeted by the two friendly clerks, who were comfortable to go back and forth between English and French, in true Montreal fashion.The verdict: The crepe consistency and the filling-to-crepe ratio were both spot-on. I also really enjoyed the tangy salad dressing. The roasted potatoes were a little stale, but nothing that maple syrup couldn't take care of. Finally, the coffee was very smooth and served at an ideal temperature. I definitely recommend Brume dans mes Lunettes for brunch, although it seems that their specialty is afternoon tea, for which they offer three 'combos' made of a teapot along with traditional afternoon tea snacks such as cucumber sandwiches, scones, and lemon tarts."

Their choice of food that accompanied our choice of tea (Earl Gray) was ""sur la coche""! The yorkshire pudding with the gravlax salmon, the cucumer sandwiches, the scones! OMG, the scones were soooo good!!!! Freshly baked with jam and fresh cream... i could have ate a douzain on my own! But the best was yet to come with their small lemon cakes. I will FOR CERTAIN go back, bring friends with me and hope eveyone goes experience the formal tea and everything else they have to offer. Kudos guys, and see you again soon!"

We were actually on the way somewhere else, but could not resist to enter this little cafe because of how nice it looked from the outside. We were not disappointed when we went inside. The staff were friendly and smiling, and it looked like they were having fun working there! The place had a really good ambiance. The breakfast menu looked great. We ordered breakfast croissants, and they were of course really yummy. My friend and I were just supposed to have a quick coffee and croissant, but ended up staying there for hours because of their nice food (they were always baking or cooking something that smelled delicious!) and coffe, but also because they had the best.playlist.ever!! We will be back tomorrow!:)"

All baked goods are made freshly throughout the day filling the place with the best smells right from the oven. Their scones are amazing, they warm them and serve it with sour creme if you ask for it. The owner is absolutely fabulous and chatty and goes out if her way to make her customers feel welcome."
/user_details?userid=1hT5oewKWdp-RsZL4J0UfQ,Sarah D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Cozy spot to read or work or meet a pal or listen to the rain or simply drink coffee. Oftentimes the space is filled with people working away on their laptops and yet it doesn't feel like you're in a library. The cafe's cozy (most accurate adjective) ambiance overwhelms this which is a very good thing. The cold brew was just okay for a $4 - not very robust and just sort of average in taste. That aside, they always seem to be baking something incredibly delicious. At least so says my nose."
/user_details?userid=3ZPqUWvfhESfFGZ-lMnf1Q,Vi-An D.,"Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Canada",4 star rating,"Very cute, small, somewhat noisy café (although it was pretty busy that Sunday). The place was nice and brightly lit, with a decent amount of comfortable seating areas and a good number of accessible outlets (yes!). I spent nearly an entire day there to study, I had a good time. We only had to pay before leaving, and they take your word for what you've purchased.The food (veg grilled cheese, carrot cake, yorkshire pudding) and tea was pretty good, although not in any way astounding - but pretty overpriced. One mug of tea was 3.50$. The service was excellent, and everyone seemed very friendly and relaxed."
