There are big table for groups. The deco is nice. The restaurant share the toilet with food court, so it was very far and dirty. The cocktails we had were good. The price for drinks varied from 6 to 14$. Good spot for tourists."

The prosecco sangria was refreshing on a warm day. Service was exceptional. Our waitress was attentive and gave great advice on where and what to do around Montreal.

Not too load, not to low! The service was good. As the bar is in the very touristy spot, we didn't expect that much good service and food. The hummus was a bit overpriced but considering the spot, it was predictable.For the first round we had 2 glasses of Chandon Rosé and for our second round we had an Aperol Spritz and La Vie En Rose. All was really good. It's recommended!"
