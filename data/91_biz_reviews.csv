The fish katsu was delicious and super fresh. The fish's texture was springy and bouncy and it came with a delicious tartare sauce. The korokke was very flavorful and soft. The karaage was juicy. Everything on the menu is affordable (total of 31$ after tax and tips for 3 dishes). The service was fast and the staff were friendly. Would definitely order again."
/user_details?userid=9nj5lry5KkSal22Oo9VGvQ,Cayla L.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,New cheap eats!! Jako is the new restaurant that has taken over the previous Ganadara space. It offers a variety of Japanese-Korean dishes. The best thing about this restaurant is that: it's great for your buck!13$ for a bowl of Salmon Donburi & a miso soup is included! Donburi is essentially a bowl of rice with your choice of protein. The salmon donburi came with ikura (salmon roe) and with some sprinkle of ginger. The rice is lightly salted with some soy sauce. We really enjoyed this dish & would recommend everyone to try this!The okonomiyaki is not your conventional Japanese pancake. It is more of a pan fried udon style. This dish is a bit more salty than I would of preferred but it is packed with flavours.The karaage was my least favourite because it was very battered. I believe the sweet&spicy one would've been a better choice since it would've had the sauce to make it less hard to chew. I definitely recommend people to give this place a try! And I can't wait to go back and try different dishes.

I ordered the Dak Galbi Dolsot (5/5), which was excellent; the Dak Galbi was super flavourful and the purple sweet potato puree was a nice touch. I also tried the Chicken Cheese Katsu (4/5 - not enough curry sauce) and Tteokbokki Udon (5/5 - probably the best of the dishes I tried). Excited to try the Donburi next time! I highly recommend this restaurant to folks who miss Ganadara - it is an upgrade! :)"
