They were wearing masks and a hand sanitizer was provided upon entry. The restaurant itself was completely empty but I think they're probably doing well with take out orders. The food: oh my goodness this was so delicious! All of the dishes we ordered were delicious. They were also completely hot when we got home (even after picking up and then walking around the park in the front of the restaurant before going home to eat the food). The schnitzel was SUPER moist and flavourful, and the duck leg was tender and the cranberry sauce was perfect with it. The dumplings were juicy and super meaty. The borscht was delightful! The best part is that it even came with bread, like when you are actually there. It was awesome! Even the bread was warm. The potatoes and salad were great too for sides. Service was good! They were a bit confused but it went well in the end. I would definitely love to eat in one day, after COVID is over since the restaurant is so big and spacious!"

I was shocked to see the choices on the menu. Some of these items I would not consider, but after a leap of faith I was amazed.. for example the Herring Filet, I did not expect the fine taste, it wasn't fishy at all and I really loved it.  If yo are fan of mushrooms I loved the Julien it's baked in cream mushroom sauce but packed with flavor.  The one dish I hesitated because I've had it in the past ad a friend's place was the Borsch soup, Ican't say it's for everyone but this one was one of my favorite and I would reorder it (I have). Since I'm a mushroom lover I had to try the Chicken Kiev! Chicken filled with goodness... It melts i n your mouth. I can keep going on.. Duck rasputin will be my last but not least (more like my favorite). The service was friendly and if you go on the weekend Friday night and Saturday the owners and other performers are on stage... I really like there was not extra charge and what great environment for group of friends or a date. They did make some minor renovations, the place looks clean and well kept. COVD:During Covid I have ordered a few times and I found that its really important to help out locals and especially ones that hidden gems in your local area. I try hard to switch it up as much as I can. I would recommend you give this one a try. I did find there portions very generous and you pay for quality (and the right kind of quantity).. Those living in the Ville Saint Lauren I would recommend ordering takeout, you can order it online. Uber if you must (I find it painful to have restaurants loose a % of there profits when they have so much overhead :( but it's an option. We all need to eat and why not eat with a cause #helpinglocals"

Prices are still steap and very high the alcohol is a real rip off since you can't order by the glass only by bottles .. it's super annoying to see crazy prices on booze.However, the food was very delicious and got wayyy better from my last review. Portions increased and the quality aswellOverall, it's a great place to celebrate birthdays and parties and they have live russia entertainment on Friday & Saturdays at 8pm which sets them apart from the rest. Beautiful small venue and I recommend"
/user_details?userid=u88tOXwWGsvREODosuQIJg,Maya T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Been wanting to try this place for a while now so I did today. I thought it looked really clean and nice inside. Simple and elegant decor. While waiting for the food they gave me 2 halves of a slice of bread and butter. There were also some croutons on the table that I nibbled on. I had the beef stroganoff. It comes with rice or potatoes and a salad  (all on one plate). Couldn't decide whether to have it with rice or potatoes but the staff was kind enough to offer me 50/50. There were 3 potatoes and what seemed liked a tablespoon of rice. The stroganoff came in a little pot that was a good serving and kept the food warm. It was delicious.
/user_details?userid=LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Had super high hopes after some of the reviews online stating ""slow but delicious"". I understand what they mean when they say inattentive service, went for lunch and we were one of TWO hole tables (us a party of 2 and them a party of 4), soup of the day was bland, food was slow, and although our proteins/main portion of the main dish were very tasty, the sides were awful. No salt or pepper could even be detected on the potatoes, and that salad's only dressing was low grade olive oil. I had the pork chop and he had one of the mushroom dishes (cream and pork I think?) but it's not worth the time or money for that quality on the rest of the meal"
/user_details?userid=lHJoAYx2K8olZhUxnQgh2g,Joey C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Order from the table d'hôte of that night.For starters I ventured into this restaurant on a cold winter night.  I began with a hot bowl of this fantastic borsch.  Packed with flavour fresh cilantro and fresh spices that when combined with the heat of the soup created that perfect comfort food for a cold winters day.  As a main meal i had a Hungarian goulash, what can I say, it was simply prepared in a clay pot with fresh vegetables and potatoes.  The meat melted in your mouth assisted the beautifully assorted flavours complimenting the entire dish.  Didn't take desert that night was feeling it, so the night was ended with a nice cup of coffee.  Would definitely visit this establishment again as the staff are very friendly and warm, and if you enjoy live music, Friday and Saturday its the place to be."
