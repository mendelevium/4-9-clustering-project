/user_details?userid=CqPKiwlgPqerUKtlzmszkg,Andrea K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We were lucky to secure a reservation for La Fabrique, and were rewarded with a very memorable meal. The food was next level on many fronts - the vegetables impossibly fresh, the dishes creative and playful, and every ingredient holding its own, despite the complexity of the dishes. In delighting in the beautifully composed plates, I saw the inspiration and the pride of the craft shining through. The service was also exceptional - the server was very knowledgable about wine and very graciously swapped out an ingredient for me due to a food sensitivity. We were made to feel like guests visiting friends. I highly recommend a visit and will most definitely be back."
/user_details?userid=yInNj9eDZ1JAUIZ4n0P6Jg,Mike Z.,"Nashville, TN",3 star rating,"I guess I expected more from when I read the reviews.  While the place is very cute and intimate, the loudness of the restaurant was still great.  It's a great spot for a social gathering. Brunch had a chill vibe yet had the energy you want in a place to make you excited. I will say the front hostess was very welcoming and accommodating.  Not to mention being from the South in the States, the coat check is a whole new world for me.  It's a great idea and makes you feel like you're in for an experience.We like sitting at the bar when we go to restaurants. Most of the time, it's more entertaining to watch the bartenders make their drinks and partake in something new we haven't tried and looks intriguing, not to mention they're good about what and what not to try.We had the pancakes (which are not standard American flapjacks) and the brisket plate (which was more of a pot roast). I would say the portions are a lot smaller than you expect but they were heavy enough to fill your appetite so know that going in.I gotta say they work their tail off in the kitchen from the view we had and everyone's constantly moving, so with a place fairly quaint, the place fills up quickly and is always in constant motion while trying to keep a bright and airy feeling to the restaurant.  I would go back if I'm back in town but it wasn't a stand out experience."

Believe it or not, you will be able to bring that can of maple syrup HOME. Yes, maple syrup infused with pork fat. FUCK. YES! SLATHER THAT SHIT ALL OVER MY BODY.I would like to sincerely thank the owners and entire team of La Fabrique for allowing me to savour your new project. This is what I do best: To truly and genuinely connect with humans and understanding that going to successful restaurants isn't just about eating a good meal. Not only it is about sharing a vision, but it is also about sharing a story."

They were able to squeeze us in on thanksgiving as a walk-in and we ended up very glad they did! Very friendly waitress from France, extremely attentive. Dinner menus not brought until after drinks were ordered, very classy. The table bread is delicious - I liked the table pickles as well. Seasonal soup was delicious with nuts and croutons in the bottom of the bowl. Every bit of the meal had high marks for presentation and taste. Very nice atmosphere and lots of space for big groups or small. We would love to come back!"
/user_details?userid=3kggkuTo6mjJjVpPGBy4DA,René D.,"Lansing, MI",5 star rating,"This place has been a favorite of mine for a few yrs now.  I have never had a subpar meal or experience here.  They can accommodate the solitary diner or a large group.  The waitstaff seem to love their work.  They are never idle and they help each other always.  One takes an order, another brings your meal, and another clears your plate.  Their menu is continuously evolving, and their desserts are to die."
/user_details?userid=LYOvyedhKD3eqs4dJrp6yQ,Jackie S.,"Jersey City, NJ",4 star rating,"I think La Fabrique is more of a brunch hotspot, but I came here for dinner and had a good experience. The service is a bit slow, but the food was very good. Be careful when you get drinks, they are stingy with the liquor. Perhaps save the alcohol for a bar nearby.The fried squid appetizer was fantastic. It had fennel which I hate, but honestly, whatever they did...worked. The salmon tartar was excellent, and I recommend getting the larger portion because it comes with either salad or fries. Get the fries, they're great and there are A LOT. The braised beef shoulder entree was cooked perfectly and very tasty too. A nice touch that the restaurant does is they give you a complementary jar of pickles which are AWESOME, and cotton candy as a complementary dessert!"
/user_details?userid=-JSy3GQgsE7bp9DQ6-xxfg,Bliek ..,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Outstanding menu and wine list, somewhat unexpected given the St Denis strip. Ingredients reflect the chef's imaginative take on classic dishes, described as they are without the usual torrent of alluring adjectives. The unusual combinations generated succulent and revealing results. Our server doubled as sommelier and expertly guided us through the wine list, concluding with an out-of-the ordinary recommendation that fit perfectly with the meal. I would not hesitate to go back ... apparently the brunch menu draws a crowd."
/user_details?userid=Wcz-TUD7ma96mRX7ujTvvA,Pras C.,"Northeast Washington, Washington, DC",5 star rating,A good brunch spot with delicious cocktails and mocktails. Seating on the terrace and indoors. Attentive service and cute details like chinaware. We ordered the soft boiled eggs and shoulder beef and onion cake entrees. We were advised against ordering multiple appetizers because they are pretty large. I'll let you judge for yourself if the four croquettes look large for two people to you!
/user_details?userid=Y6JhHLPzBZ6Z5cHS1s-B4w,Rojarra T.,"Lachine, Canada",5 star rating,"La Fabrique has made it into my top 3 brunch experiences in Montreal.The restaurant is beautiful, the ambience is lively, the service is top-notch, the prices are reasonable and the food is absolutely delicious! I visited for brunch with my partner and brother and we ordered a few dishes to share between us. Although everything that we got was fantastic, my two favourites were the French Toast with Praline cream and Orange Candy and the savoury French Toast with Brioche bread, Guinea Fowl and Egg Yolk. The first dish was perfectly balanced and not too sweet. The toast was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Since the dish is rather small, I'd suggest getting it as a starter, dessert or as one of a few sharing plates.The Savoury dish was also perfect. This portion was generous and filling. The meat was flavourful and tender. Oh and they take reservations, so no long lines and no waiting! I know that their menu changes often, so I can't wait to visit again and try a few more of their brunch specialities!"

/user_details?userid=EJ5ybtY1FqieuS22LHbT1w,Claire L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"BRUNCH REVIEW : this is my second time coming to La Fabrique. It is a great choice when you are a group looking for a spot in the plateau area because you can reserve! The food and menu is great and interesting, great spot for a date or a girls brunch. However, they REALLY need to step up their coffee game. We ordered a variety of drinks and they don't have proper barista coffee. For me, I would rather see a good filtered coffee if they can't offer a decent latte. They do however offer good homemade juice options. Second point where the restaurant really fell short was in terms of service. We sat down at 11 and didn't get visited by a waiter for 15 minutes. We ordered right away, expecting it would be an issue to get the waiters attention again....and we waited until 12 to get our food. I agree that the plates are a bit more complex...but I feel they could really improve in this regard."
/user_details?userid=fevnU9WEaJTJm5QzyQIyWw,Rose H.,"Jacksonville, FL",4 star rating,"Elegant little restaurant! They change their menu every week so it is only in French. The wait staff is super friendly and read the entire menu to us in English. The translation of the description may have been a little off, but the food is of the highest quality and the attention to detail of taste and presentation is high! There may be too many tastes going on with each menu item for my liking, but it is well thought out and put together.The salmon cream cheese bretzel was delicious! Romantic, coZy atmosphere across the street from a nice park"
/user_details?userid=2RaUfJhn1KJhiQ0D1HRx4A,Riddhika J.,"Englewood, CO",5 star rating,"RUSTIC SETTING, VERY FRIENDLY SERVERS & AWESOMEEEE FOOD!One of my friend, who is a big fan of this place, dragged us to La Fabrique for brunch. First let me say that their kitchen is fabulous. They have it out in the open where you can actually watch what they are cooking and how. Second important thing is, they now have their menu is english and we went the day they started using those menu so we were even able to point out the mistakes. The server was very polite and friendly and explained us all about the dishes. DRINKS: We ordered coffee, orange juice and chai tea latte for start of the meal. The coffee is being served in small glasses that are used in India for tea serving and I was very pleased with that and above all the coffee was brewed perfectly. Chai tea on other hand was very light and I would have loved if they would have served 2 tea bags instead of just one. Juice was freshly squeezed and perfect.  FOOD: I ordered FRENCH TOAST with English custard, apple and maple glaze. I had to wait for a while but OMG it was well worth the wait. It was very unique because I had never had a french toast baked in the cute little casserole. It felt like my taste buds thanking me. I have never had such a delicious french toast in my entire life. The top layer was all caramelized maple, then English custard and french toast and caramelized apple then french toast again and bottom most layer was English custard. I could eat that over and over and would still want it. My friend had the English biscuit with pulled pork topped with egg. The meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The biscuit was very flaky and to top that off the egg was soo gooey in the center. He loved it. My husband ordered pork roast with salad and he was impressed with that. Overall, the food was really good and I would definitely wanna go back there and try their pancakes. Ohhh, I can't stop drooling! I highly recommend this place :)"

Honestly it is a great little restaurant that looks beautiful without being overly extravagant. I went there for brunch and tried their pork chops and egg on English muffin, it was really good! The portion is quite generous and the service good in general. I would recommend this restaurant to you!"

/user_details?userid=Y_2jMUKz6pvJ0JSWG3u10A,Tina T.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"Holy crap on this brunch!! On our first trip to Montreal, our restaurant try list was mostly derailed since we didn't make any reservations. So on a Sunday morning, we were hoping for the best on various places. We stopped here, on a gorgeous day, and were able to score a table on the patio (for 3) after waiting 10-15 minutes. I ordered an egg dish with cheese, zucchini, corn, and some toast. It was light, fluffy, and delicious. I tried not to demolish it and share but it was very difficult. Kana K ordered a French toast with fruit which was equally light (not in calories, of course) and delicious. Brian T ordered a steak tartare which a) I usually steer clear of and b) I happily ate a few bites of. Just delicious and well flavored. For drinks, I had a mimosa and Brian T tried a maple whiskey on the menu (chilled). That whiskey was the start of a new addiction for Brian T, haha, and maybe me too!Great service and restaurant. Must go again on our next visit."
/user_details?userid=55fCofuKVb7XP3newzmX3w,Andrea M.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,Cutest little restaurant. The kitchen is right in the center so you can watch your food being made. The service was fast and great. The salmon was delicious. I normally like mine well done and I asked them to cook it a little longer and they were so accommodating which was nice. The beef shoulder was also very good. If you are new to town or a local you should check this place out. I was very pleased and it was reasonably priced!

If I write ""Get this!"" on every food photo, I'm a big fat fan. Love this place. Genuine people working an open kitchen, full-steam ahead, in a relaxed-but-hip ambiance. Excellent service. Each dish was not only beautifully presented, but also, each dish tasted delicious. Love how they do the salmon tartare with cranberries. They take that salmon to the edge - where it's not so soft as to be mistaken for cat food (major dislike) but where it is smooth, with just a hint of texture. If ever I lose my teeth, this shall sustain me. I'd be relocating for salmon tartare. I've made crazier moves. Is this pain perdu?! Pain perdu was a not a trick, hiding under vellum-thin pineapple sheets...it was a treat! Ouefs mollets did not disappoint - ample mayo in this dish, so venture forth at your own risk. It's worth it. They take reservations, by the way."
/user_details?userid=0Pd-LScDP0zLf4ShnV8L0Q,Katie D.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",3 star rating,"We had a very large group here for brunch. Reserving the place and figuring out the menu ahead of time was quite difficult. They were extremely slow to respond to email correspondence, we had to actually call a couple of times to get to someone. We were told that for a large group we had to select just a few entrees ahead of head, but then of course never heard back and they just offered everyone the full menu the day of. The open kitchen that occupies the center of the restaurant is very neat. The tables right next to the kitchen, where we were sat, are quite close to the cooking area. The issue is probably if you lean back too much, you will touch it and I certainly hope people don't sneeze or something.The menu itself was quite interesting, I would even call some of the combinations unusual. Sometimes it's a little difficult to figure out what is being served because each item is just a list of ingredients. I wanted something lighter so opted for the French Toast. The bread itself was awesomely thick and the sides were nice and crisp. The remainder of the dish was a mix of diced fruit, some white chocolate chips and this fruity mousse. It was a strange combination with the toast and unfortunately made the bottom of it a bit soggy. I did not get to try everyone else is food, but ""interesting"" was a common theme. I could consider coffee and tea being served in glasses with no handle to be the same."
/user_details?userid=Lr8RJL9_Y5_lkgACj2l7oA,Maria B.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,The best French brunch Cuisine experience ever! We paid for the set menu Easter Brunch and it was worth every bite! They space out the courses nicely to give you time and enjoy what you are eating. The positions are perfect to keep you satisfied but not overly full. The staff is friendly and the place has a homey feel to it. Their lattes are amazing!!!! They do order two sizes (small / large). Get the large because the small is not worth it and you will be wanting more. Lol Overall - great experience and we would return without a doubt!

It was busy and we had no reservation so we ended up sitting at the bar.  Very original brunch menu. I had the pain brioché (plus homemade bacon as extra) and my friend the lamb confit. Delicious! Everything was on point -- not too sweet, not too salty. Presentation was excellent. Service was fast (there were large groups that day but they had the smarts and decency to serve smaller tables first) and friendly. The price is a bit higher than at most brunch places but you get quality and originality. Will go back soon."
/user_details?userid=_Es5HuksJfx_n-8_JgKG1A,Tiffany M.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"This turned out to be an excellent recommendation from another restaurant. Mr favorite was the French toast, which, although the garnishes change on a weekly basis, is a staple- so crunchy outside, yet so fluffy inside. Ask for the bacon to be slightly crispy/ charred and you e won't be disappointed at all! Oh, and tell Stephanie the girls from NYC said you had to have a pickleback made with the juice from their homemade pickles- amazeballs!"
/user_details?userid=ioKXr5feQNc7hiLTshlZPQ,Aaron T.,"Beverly, MA",5 star rating,Fabulous dining experience.  I had the beef shoulder (pictured) and it was one of the most flavorful and tender red meats I have every enjoyed.    La Fabrique leaves cotton candy on the house while you wait for your check!  PS  my dining parter for the night had salmon and loved it!
/user_details?userid=pPEvdh5cNfWFlBW_X_Rwdw,Cecilia H.,"Oakville, Canada",3 star rating,My colleague and I landed in Montreal late in the evening and happened to find La Fabrique by chance as we hangrily walking around in search of food. The menu was quite extensive and options were interesting. She chose the linguini (+1 scallop)  and I went for the pulled pork burger. I was surprised that the pulled pork was pressed into a tight patty! Was fully expecting the pulled pork to be strewn out and that I would have a messy night. The meat was tender and juicy. I really enjoyed the flavours! It was paired with duck fat fries with homemade ketchup. All excellent! We tried each other's dishes and both agreed that my burger was the better of the 2. My colleague mentioned that her linguini was lacklustre and was a little too heavy on a vinaigrette taste. Bonus: they serve you pickles and bread as a a free appetizer and cotton candy as a free dessert! Space set-up was interesting with an open concept kitchen right in the middle of the room. Our server was attentive and polite but a little slow (note that he was also the only server that night and there were approximately 5 tables).
/user_details?userid=CNn843UNx7Vk9RuYNMCNqg,HyunKyung C.,"Manhattan, NY",3 star rating,I went there for Montreal table. Foods I had there were oily and salty to me. It would be better if I had a glass of wine. I only liked dessert there after eating the foods and the presentation. The presentation was amazing. Staffs there kind and friendly. Also I recommend to seat far from open kitchen to some people who just like me. I seated next to the open kitchen I was too warm and I felt that the air wasn't fresh. My clothes smells like a restaurant.

First, they called us ahead to make sure no one had any food allergies since it was a set menu. It's always appreciated when restaurants are mindful as such.The layout and space is modern, cozy with the open kitchen being the center of attention. It was a great experience watching what was about to be served at your table. I'm not so adventurous with meat nor is French food my meal of choice. But everything from the rabbit ravioli to the sweetbreads surf and turf was fabulous! Service was excellent. And they spaced out the courses just right!I will surely be returning to La Fabrique upon my next trip to Montréal! It's a keeper!"
/user_details?userid=fFyCIvBwWkIHpm_usMn8qw,Thomas D.,"West Hartford, CT",3 star rating,"Well executed food but the flavor combinations just don't work.Braised beef shoulder was perfectly cooked and super tender.  However the apple and avocado did not work with the tomato base sauce that it was served with.Similar with the slow cooked salmon - very well cooked salmon but the watermelon, zucchini, etc was not a good flavor mix.Overall it was a good experience, the waiter was excellent, good atmosphere, nice open kitchen.  I would probably go back but would like to see the food improve."

Sipping on grapefruit cider mimosa, drinking coffee from little glasses (what's with Montreal and serving coffee in glasses?), and taking bites of delicious food that combine taste, texture and aroma. I got the mushroom tart. The description said braised beef. I was expecting something like a quiche with a bowl of braised beef and somewhere a fried egg, perhaps. What I got was nothing like that! On top of a thick hummus-like bean paste that was drizzled with olive oil, sat a small disc of thin-layered pastry, filled with  think later of mushroom, atop which sat two discs of super tender braised beef, and everything was topped with a fried egg. there were chunks of tomatoes sprinkled with a really tasty salt positioned under the pile, stuck into the bean paste or on the plate displayed to the world. Every bite, whether it's just one of the ingredients or a combination, was very flavorful. I took a long time to finish my meal and it was well worth it.My brunch buddy got a plate of bean stew, topped with fennel, ricotta, potatoes, and 63-degree eggs. Doesn't sound like much, but it was really really good! Definitely a good location to venture out to if you are in the city. Everything on the menu looked awesome! Try a few!"

Nice restaurant and friendly service. Love that the kitchen is open in the middle of the restaurant so we can watch the chefs in action and put together their beautiful dishes. There is also a couple of tables by the front of the restaurant with wide open window facing the street/park that could be very nice too. As we were watching the chefs cooking, we got really excited about the food. The presentation is really nice, they have that fancy egg poacher machine that make the egg look oh so beautiful. However, when we tasted the food, we were a little disappointed. It wasn't bad at all, but we just expected so much more. It was a great experience, but I don't think I will come back here for a while."

We couldn't get a seat outside, but were offered a seat inside. The atmosphere of the restaurant was super cute and dainty. I was a bit disappointed because we asked if we could sit outside when the seat became available, however the waitress said there aren't any (although the people who came after us got seated outside so I'm not sure what the matter with that is). Aside from that, service was pretty good. I got their coffee (pretty good, $2.50, but nothing special) and ordered the 'Pain Naan' (housemade naan bread with very rich goat cheese and other sauce and cucumbers on top, $16.00). The naan bread was not what I was expecting - as it wasn't the traditional gooey naan bread but rather a fluffier one. Goat cheese portion on top was great, however with the naan bread it was a bit too much and the flavour seemed to be missing something. Not sure if I would try the same thing again, but as the price was in reasonable range ($13-18) for brunch, maybe I'll come back when I visit Montreal again and try a different item."

La Fabrique had two cooks, two waitresses, and one busboy serving the entire place. (Probably 25-30 tables). The service was excellent. The waitresses smiled, made drinks, poured refills, and rang up checks as if we were the only people in there. I have never experienced such efficiency in any restaurant."

Also, any food that is deep fried, battered, cooked in copious amounts of butter or covered in syrup is going to taste good but that doesn't make you a good cook. It makes you an overpriced McDonalds. The brunch options had enough calories for the rest of the day and the vegetarian options were either a salad or one of two sugary dishes that would make a poutine look like ax kale smoothie. What about an omelette? What about eggs florentine? This restaurant just invented a bunch of super fattening dishes to compensate for the fact that they're mediocre chefs. Finally, 3.50 for a very small glass of room temperature orange juice? Unless you have the orange tree in back, this a rip off."

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Sometimes the closest restaurants to you are the ones you never check out. They sit on your ""to visit"" list and get ignored. Be it because you forget about them or get distracted by other places. This year's taste MTL allowed me to finally eliminate one such place from my list - La Fabrique Bistrot. Situated in front of St-Louis Square and a short walk from my neighbourhood, this open kitchen concept restaurant makes quite the impression when you walk in. The kitchen right in the middle of the room, beautifully wood panelling all around and tons of lighting accents. It creates a very inviting and rustic feel all without losing the fine dining element.For taste MTL, they were offering a 39$ menu that combined regular menu items with some other options. They also offered a wine pairing option for an additional 27$ for each of the meal. My dining companions and I went with this option and were satisfied with the selections - particularly the Muscato I received during the dessert course.Prior to the actual menu, we received a small bowl of squash, corn and nut soup as an amuse-bouche. Nice and rich, we were pleasantly surprised by the addition of the corn and the nuts. The corn provided some sweetness and the nuts a little salt on top of the texture additions both provided. A nice starter to the meal.The 2 appetizers offered for Taste MTL were a beetroot, carrot and orange salad with horseradish cream and ratatouille in a terrine with Vitello tomato and foccaccia. The salad was wonderfully light and fresh with a strong kick from the horseradish to spice things up. The ratatouille terrine was a very unique concept that worked beautifully and the sauce provided a nice creamy component to mix with the terrine.The first main course was a slowly cooked pork with apple, squash, turnip and sweet potato sautéed with Papineau's maple syrup and ginger. Perfectly executed, the pork just felt apart. The fattiness of the pork was augmented nicely with the sweetness of the maple syrup and the freshness of the vegetables in the dish. The addition of the cheddar on top added some nice sharpness as well. A very creative and delicious dish all around.The second main was salmon preserved in sunflower oil with miniature pepper, parsnip, onion and a carrot purée. The preparation here was a bit more straight forward compared to the pork dish but very well done. The salmon was perfectly cooked and the carrot puree was wonderfully sweet. The other vegetables were good but didn't hit home as much as the puree.We also ordered an extra side of home fries as they are fried in duck fat and served with house ketchup. Duck fat always adds a little something extra to dishes and that was no exception here. The fries had just that little extra taste and bite which was nice. The house-made ketchup had a nice tanginess to it as well. For dessert, the options were French toast with clove caramel and fleur de sel or an apple and maple syrup in a homemade yogurt cream. The French toast was ridiculous - a thick cut slice of bread with a rich and cream caramel with just the right hint of salt to balance out the sweetness. The apple, maple and yogurt mixture was quite good as well but got quickly overshadowed by the French toast. And then, once the bills came, so did our final surprise dessert - house cotton candy! Nice, sweet and fluffy without that pesky stickiness which hampers handling. A very playful way to end a great meal.From beginning to end, la Fabrique was a great experience. Having the kitchen in the middle of the dining room is a cool hook to get you in but the great food and atmosphere are what will make you come back for more. It is nice to know I have another awesome restaurant a short walk over in my neighbourhood. Just another reminder to not ignore what you have close to you. You may be pleasantly surprised. Cheers!"

Service that is genuinely kind, efficient and hospitable? Check. A restaurant that makes its own mayo and ketchup? Wow. The warm, charred bread and sour cream butter spread was a nice way to start the meal. Housemade pickles added to the wow factor. We started with the daily soup, an amazing Carrot, clementine puree. We continued with a cheese terrine melted on a slab of crusty bread. For entrées I had the succulent beef shoulder braised and grilled, dressed with Roman beans. It was out of this world good. My husband had the salmon with a side of fries. We finished with the french toast and I highly suggest that you save room for it too. The insanely delicious caramel top was a perfect balance for the salted, buttery crust of the soft bread. We were so disappointed that we couldn't go back for a second night as they do close on Mondays, but we were glad to have had the experience for at least one of our culinary adventures in Montreal."

Their sommelier graciously accommodated our party of 8 in spite of having a full house. It's a very hip, low key place with amazing food and service. Attentive to the highest degree - every detail was attended to with the warmest of attitude. We're so glad we were able to have such a fabulous gastronomic experience during our visit to beautiful Montreal."

The atmosphere was casual and full of conversation.  The large back area and table filled with a surprise birthday party followed by the group singing Happy Birthday to the birthday boy.Our waiter, waitress and neighboring patrons made our ""outsider and visiting"" experience more of a local and welcoming experience.  Everyone was very helpful and the food was better than expected.  I really hope my Non-Canadian experience helped with deciding to visit La Fabrique.  I really really enjoyed it."

I have been meaning to eat at this place for a while now, and I am happy that I finally did. Sat out on the terrace with my brother and enjoyed a very nice late lunch/early dinner. We started our meal with some delicious bloody caesars that had some port in them and were garnished with anchovy stuffed olives (yum!). Could have been a tad spicier, but other than that they were really quite good.For appetizers, I ordered the melon salad, upon the recommendation of our server and I was not disappointed! It was really refreshing on a very humid day. my brother ordered the tartine gratine, but was brought the cheese fondue. It was not what he ordered, but we didn't complain because the cheese fondue was really great! It's a deliciously breaded piece of cheese on top of a little rocket salad. We completed our meal with a second round of caesars and our main dishes: the bavette for my brother, and the gnocchi with a scallop for me. Both were well seasoned and cooked perfectly. We also ordered a beef burger to bring home to my sweetie who didn't come for lunch. It's made with braised beef and garnished with a sweet red cabbage. Really yummy! Overall a lovely meal. Delicious food, nice atmosphere, and beautiful plating. The bread and home made chivey butter that came with the meal was really great and their home made ketchup and mayo were also delicious!! I will definitely be back."

Also very tasty, great for someone who wants something salty and sweet . Oeuf moelleux - will not likely order again as it lacked taste. I usually complain that dishes are too salty, but this one was short on flavors. The lentil salad was great, but the remainder of the dish was a definite miss."

Interesting introduction as you walk in, but unfortunately your first contact is wading through ""traffic"". And though the service is a little slow, the food is quite outstanding. The complimentary pickle jar to start and cotton candy at the end are nice touches, and does nothing to take away from the artful dishes prepared before your eyes by the creative chefs (who are not hard on the eyes themselves). Tried the salmon tartar which was which was fresh and flavorful and the ""plat du jour"" which consisted of a pork and black bean tart which scallops and seasonal veggies - amazing. Didn't have room for dessert but apparently the Pain Perdu is wonderful.Will definitely go back (but maybe during the week)"

Starting with an excellent wine recommendation, our waiter continually demonstrated an expertise and attention to detail that made for a casual and professionally-productive time, all while adroitly switching between English and French in order to accommodate all four members of our dinner party.After spending a great deal of time scrutinizing the menu and its occasional, though rather amusing, translation failures, I decided that a hearty bowl of onion soup was an apropos way to begin the meal in a city still under the grip of winter. The robustly-flavored and appropriately-comforting soup proved the perfect way to start the meal.For my main and final course, I opted for the pan-seared cod with cumin and black olive mashed potato galette. The obviously high-quality fish was seared perfectly, the light char serving to hold together the flaky flesh without overwhelming its mild flavor. The boldly-flavored potato ""cake"" proved a welcome and pleasing juxtaposition to the cod, making for an  adeptly-balanced dish. The accompanying vegetables added a bit of depth to the dish without disturbing the pairing of fish and galette that was clearly the chef's focus.After lingering for a few hours all while never feeling rushed despite the rapidly-filling dining room, we departed having enjoyed a meal clearly prepared by a skilled and passionate chef intent on providing rich, satisfying ""comfort"" food in a laid-back environment."

/user_details?userid=8SdXEmce1c5R9hGSljbv1g,Shao L.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",1 star rating,"The location is nice and the setup is good, but the food and the service are not on par. I started with the Porc Terrine which unfortunately was tasteless and dry (although the portion was more than generous). The accompanying foie gras was nice. So were the starters of my wife and her mother. The main course was more miss than hit. My duck burger was OK but they definitely tried to cram to many things in it which made the whole thing unpalatable. The duck is mixed with cheese then crusted and deep-fried. Then it's put in between buns with some sort of celeri/beets salad, something resembling a bearnaise sauce and foie gras (that was a supplement that I asked for). Unfortunately the dish was way to heavy and the sauce was too strong. Something that could have been really inventive turned out to be a greasy deluxe version of a McDonald dish. My wife ordered the old-aged steack. She asked for it medium-rare and it came well done. Now that's bad. When a restaurant can not cook meat properly, you know for a fact there is something really wrong in the kitchen. They were honests with us and did not count the dish on the note but the damage was done. The deserts were OK although I am 90% sure their creme brulee was not homemade. Service was decent. The only problem was that out of the 3 waiters (2 girls and one guy), only the girls looked like they knew what they were doing. The guy kept forgetting everything and did not look like a professional waiter at all (he probably gave these poor girls more work than help at the end). So all in all, a below average experience which is all the most disappointing that some of the ideas on the menu or in the setup could have led to something really great. If you know cooking, don't go there, if you're just looking for a nice place and don't care about what you eat, this could do the trick."

Not too crowded (meaning the tables and seats were not flush against each other). I really liked the open kitchen because I like watching how food is prepared. It is kind of like watching a tv show live in a studio. We started with a potato salad, but it was no ordinary potato salad. The flavour was there, and the potatoes were not over or under cooked. The nice touch was the addition of mussels. For the main, we shared the salmon and the cauliflower, broccoli, Brussell sprout sauté. Both were delicious. The salmon was cooked to perfection (I find that most restaurants over cook their salmon so it is really dry). All I can say is that the chefs know how to prepare their dishes. Their homemade pickles were good too."

No problem getting a reservation a week in advance for a Friday night; the place was busy but not full . while we were there. Loved the gratis homemade pickles with peasant bread and chive/shallot spread. Fois gras app also successful. Avoid veal cheek main -- the Asian-style sauce was too bitter. Steak frites was better and cooked as ordered but is the most expensive menu item. Iced tea came straight from a can. Service could have been more attentive but we never felt rushed. Not a bad meal but not a destination either.

This place has the kitchen right in the midst of the tables so customers can watch as the food is prepared. It's a fun idea & I liked it at first, but I was facing one food preparer (a young, short wiry guy) preparing tartar. He spooned the tartar from a bowl into a mold & with the same spoon, scraped out the remaining tartar from the bowl into his mouth & then placed the same spoon in a metal container with water. He re-used the same spoons from that metal container (without washing the spoons or the small rinse container) & repeated this same behaviour- using this spoon to eat the remaining bits of tartar from the bowl - several times throughout the hour & a half that we were there..... Yikes! Fortunately I did not order tartar - but I found his food preparation techniques alarming to say the least..... Looks like some re-training might be in order......"
