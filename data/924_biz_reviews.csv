/user_details?userid=aEdwKSzDnHIadYuWya5y_A,Jay M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"They were out of everything except Dosas since it was almost closing time. They make dosas quite big which I didn't anticipate. But still, two dosas are good enough to make a stomach full meal. Coconut Chutney and Sambhar: Both were good. No wow factor but very much edible. Masala Dosa: It was good. The potato masala tasted great and the dosa was quite well made. Vegetable Dosa: Didn't like it that much but was okay. The taste wasn't that good - a little off taste. Maybe because it was the last batch of vegetables - not so fresh I suppose. I did a takeout and the service was quite quick. There are two other restaurants next to it and only this one had customers - speaks a bit!!! A good place for South Indian food (takeout). There is some seating available but then it is shared among the three counters, so can't really count on that."
/user_details?userid=92un-N_Cgl13qjRXYcGTng,Vivian P.,"Central, Vancouver, Canada",1 star rating,"Ordered take out from Uber eats. Quality of food was a huge issue. Chicken dosa was full of small bones and cartilage, which made it very difficult and unpleasant to eat. Butter chicken was very watery, I had never seen curry be so thin. Lamb dosa was ok, not bad, not great. I was raised in the 'motainai' culture, where we do not waste food, but unfortunately I had to throw away most it. I really like dosa, but I will not order from this restaurant again."

Its a small place shared between 3 different food vendors (kinda mini food court). I had plain butter dosa and was nice and crispy. Chutney and sambhar was good too. Nice guy running this place. Accepts card and cash."
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"South Indian food is one of my favorite. I saw Chennai Express thru the Yelp list. Finally, I went to order my food. The place is situated in the middle of downtown. It's a mini food court with three (Lebanese, Asian and South Indian) resto counters. There is bar table with four and five stools. It was lunch time; the place was booming with customers. When we got in; my first issue was the hygiene, but it is so busy, the food must be special, so I try not think about it. The lineup was busy and long, I think it took 20 minutes to get to the cash to give my order. Finally I ordered paneer masala dosa, a special of the day. Then it took another 15 minutes to get my food. There is only one cook and one person at the counter. Going back to hygiene. The cook is wearing a hair net but the cashier who serves the sauce on the side, doesn't it. That bothered me a lot. Finally, I got my food, I went across to the park, joined my friends, and ate my dosa. Despite the long wait and my concern of hygiene, the food was very delicious."
/user_details?userid=FrfHnqeGDpT3-dmhOekMuw,Rahul C.,"Framingham, MA",3 star rating,It was okay. Nothing special. Probably would not try it again. Way too many better options in Montreal (although I could not find decent Indian food options in downtown or Old town).
/user_details?userid=zsCi4yeTlJbQFTVAqgmOeA,Ramya S.,"Framingham, MA",4 star rating,"Good food, variety of vegetarian options to choose from and it reminded me of street food in India.This place is a small food counter located inside a food court with limited seating of around 5 chairs.We placed ordered for Medhu Vada, Rasam Idli and vegetable Dosa. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. Luckily found empty seats to have our dinner, as dosas taste best when fresh.This is a good place to stop by and taste South Indian food. However, I just hope they move to a more clean and hygienic place."

We visited this place 3 times during our trip to Montreal. Our family tried the masala dosa, plain dosa, chicken curry with naan and rice, chicken sukha with naan, and vada.

Try the masala dosa and chicken biryani.Only reason I held back one star is because there isn't any seating here!

/user_details?userid=1V7883W5i_F3mptabTXFIw,Sarah S.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Most authentic South Indian food I have had in Montreal. Chennai Express is tucked in a small corner of an ordinary looking shop that hosts three other kitchens (Wok to Go &a Falafel Express) near Square Phillips. It's a very humble place, not not much space to sit, not the cleanest, and can be very suffocating due to the heat from three kitchens. But that's what makes this place even more appealing. The store is reminiscent of food courts back home (South Asia). Most of the customers are people of colour and speak the same language as the owners and the place is always crowded. Chennai Express is a family owned restaurant and the both the husband and wife are super friendly. They cook the food themselves while their son handles cash counter. As for the food, everything we ordered was brilliant and really exceed expectations. We tried the lamb biryani which was freshly cooked right then. It was packed with rich spices and they did not compromise on the level of hotness. I feel the biryani could do with more salt though. The fish curry was super spicy, packed with curry leaf flavours and tasted as good as the ones back home (which is rare in a store in Montreal). The fish even had bones in it! The winner for me was the Dosa! I had a masala dosa and the potato filling and sambar was close to perfection !I love how this place is so daringly authentic. They did not compromise with their culture and taste. I would recommend this place to anyone willing to try REAL South Indian food instead of the appropriated version you find at Super Quality (owned by three white dudes who spent three months in India). Please support more family owned businesses of colour like this one which actually makes a life for a lot of families."
/user_details?userid=RJLPA5HYCPFqtUuyLKSHJw,Scott C.,"San Diego, CA",1 star rating,"Do not bother with this place. Go to Chinatown.This was the most disappointing Indian food I've had.The naan tasted and felt like it had been sitting around all day. They were all out of butter chicken, and the chicken curry was not good.The samosas were just ok, but I still had to get another meal because the rest of it was so bad."
/user_details?userid=apg4zq2NocVW49x6YQA3iA,Neel L.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This quick stop isn't great but it's not terrible either. As someone who loves Indian food, I think this place lacks flavor. I've had their chicken thali as well as their fish curry and both times, I felt disappointed. Although the thali has good variety, every bite just didn't do it for me. The curries are watered down and lack flavor and the naan is ok. The fish curry was just 2 pieces of fish, watered down sauce and a box of plain rice. The workers are nice but I wouldn't recommend coming here and I don't think I'll be back anymore."

The seating is awkward and cramped, its location attracts some riffraff, and there's a considerable wait time to be served. Butttt the food is authentic and delicious, and the staff is nice and helpful. I ate the paneer masala dosa there, and took a veggie biryani and fish curry to go. Everything was seasoned well, but not quite spicy enough even though I asked for it to be spicy. So make sure to ask for everything extra extra spicy if you really want to feel the fire."
/user_details?userid=yRB4UrgnLs3BxbVM1QQ0Gw,Sababa S.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,It's a crowded takeout place. They have good dosas. I had their fish curry with rice which was spicy and i loved it. It was authentic indian food. I also tried their lamb biryani which was also delicious and spicy for just around $8. They also serve Indian style coffee which made me nostalgic.
/user_details?userid=a9UOQC0UT1aAv_KVUgl8tA,Aakrati K.,"Redmond, WA",4 star rating,"Good masala dosa, not many options for vegetarians the in evening on weekends though. Sambhar lacked tanginess and spices but overall good bang for the buck in the middle of downtown Montreal."
/user_details?userid=P7fm_qbXyg7QvTce3B3aeg,Ron C.,"La Crosse, WI",2 star rating,Samosas were decent. Not great but not bad. Lamb curry was good. Naan was absolutely atrocious. Tasted worse than any grocery store naan you can buy. To top things off when I arrived and ordered was told it would be ten minutes. Took 40 minutes to get my order. No place really to sit and was stifling hot inside the place. Very poor experience overall. Will never go back.

We tried idlis, plain dosa, masala dosa and chicken curry with rice. Everything was finger licking delicious. The chicken curry was too delicious, not oil or cream laden!

The portions were very good and service was very friendly and fast. Can't wait to come back again when we visit next!"

I tried their Masala Dosa, Mendu wada and Idly Sambhar. Given the South Indian staff Sambhar is very authentic and tasty. I was a bit turned off by Butter Chicken Thali otherwise would definitely recommend. Four stars since seating arrangement is very limited."

/user_details?userid=94QoUiuwl4dtBsBG5E6pUA,danielle c.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Hands down the BEST masala dosa I've ever had (and I've had great dosa in metro Detroit and Queens, NY). The potato curry is so delicious; the dosa is the perfect texture; and the sambar is outstanding. Just a sublime combination of flavors. Staff is very friendly. Gets super busy at lunch, so I come in the afternoon when the wait is not long. Only counter seating available, so if you come during busy hours, it might be tough to find a seat as they share the counter with 2 other food establishments in the same complex.The place is easy to miss. It's across from Burger King and in the same complex as Wok to Go and a falafel place."

/user_details?userid=NY2Myn-9hiWR9njIHTKWXQ,Dave B.,"Chatham, MA",5 star rating,"I eat a lot of indian food here in Montreal, yet I was surprised that about half of Chennai Express' menu was totally unfamiliar to me. Rather than sticking with more standard fare (dosas and byrianias), I branched out and tried some of dishes that were new to me.I started with a pair of Medu Vada, a kind of savoury donut often served at breakfast. Actually, the donut comparison isn't apt. The dough in the Vada - lentil flour? - is more hearty than donut insides, and much less sweet. The Vada tasted wholesome, and not the least bit like junk food, despite being friend. Â The coconut chutney, served on the side, added a spicy kick.For my main dish, I had a Sambar Idli. Sambar is a soup, and the Idli are dumplings that float in it and absorb its flavour. As with the Vada, it was both tasty and filling, and had a gamut of spices that were subtly novel for my Canadian pallet.The Vada and Sambar Idli definitely both ""keepers"". I'm excited to go back and try everything else!Seating is limited to a half-dozen bar stools at a wall-mounted counter."
/user_details?userid=p1FLfFL0OR02mF8w1YsTAA,Parikshit M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,Biriyani was dry and wasn't flavorful. The black pepper spice in the biriyani was too overpowering. I also ordered an egg kothu which wasn't that good either. It was too bland to my liking. I wanted to order idly sambhar but they were out of that item that day. There are better Indian restaurants in Montreal so I wouldn't visit this again.

We went there for lunch 2 times during our stay and were reasonably suprised and pleased with both the quality of the food and the taste. The masala dosas were top notch. It is a small eatery shared with other vendors, with a few seats so be ready to take your food out and eat. Busy around lunch time and lots of people were getting thalis which looked great. Overall would visit again if in the Montreal area."
/user_details?userid=X5tMMp96lxq0Y18H33SuCg,Stephka A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Not as cheap as I expected (I was looking for a cheap dinner after an expensive lunch from the same day), but the lamb masala dosa and the ""indian donuts"" (forgive my Western ass, it refers to the first entrÃ©e in the menu) were great. I even saved a little bit of the sauces offered so I could cook with them at home. Biryani looked dry, however (judging from the people eating at the restaurant). I'd also recommend take-out as well since the lights are too white in order to be flattering for your food pics."

/user_details?userid=jMHlwDq5b2zqhV5TyyFKPA,Yojna J.,"Victoria, Canada",2 star rating,"They're great for South Indian dishes and serve it within the food court itself. The place itself is very limited and is quite small as it shares space with another 2 food stalls which is falafel express and the other Chinese food. For the amount of food you get, the price is not too bad. Just one thing I'd say is to be careful with the curries and foods as I found a hair in mine and I was disgusted by it. Probably will never return to this place."

At the beginning, you might think that this hole within a hole in the wall might be a bit sketchy, but trust me it's worth it venturing out of your comfort zone.

All we wanted was a quick bite to eat. We were blown away by the flavorful food. Chicken curry and Chicken sukka dishes are really awesome and can be prepared to one's spice specifications upon request. The Biryani is good too. We ended up going there multiple times during our 10 day visit. The person who runs the place seems very hardworking and a genuine nice guy. 5 stars.

We went there on a Monday evening before catching a movie. We have heard good things about the food from an Indian friend and had a restaurant in mind. Â Yet, in reality this is not really a restaurant - it's a space shared by three different take-out kitchens, and there is a narrow table at the entrance with bar stools for people who eat there. Â There were three of us and it was not the most comfortable way to sit and talk, but at least we didn't come as a big group :) We got butter chicken, chicken curry, paratha, nan, and uttapam. Everything was very well cooked. The owner was extremely nice, and brought our trays to us at the 'table'. The mango lassie was OK, and served well to sooth the burning sensation after having the spicy chicken curry. Â They also allowed us to go through the kitchen to the toilet in the back to wash our hands - there are no other alternatives. Overall a positive experience - I might be back for take-out, but probably won't be back to hang out with friends there. Â  Tip: They have Thali for lunch - but not for dinner."

/user_details?userid=do-0INI4HHuUJKbry4B32A,Pre S.,"Pawtucket, RI",5 star rating,"I had been to Chennai Express last night. As another yelper said the location is amiss if you don't closely look. The entrance says ' Falafel Express ' in the front. Get in right there. Also, since most of the reviews said there r 3 kitchens etc etc. I'm not going there. At the look of it, for a newbie like me, you'd be surprised. But, yelpers do not give up on u, do they ? Just as the reviews, the food is AMAZING !!! I ordered the mutton varuval, fish curry, chicken biryani. The rice wasn't available, else I would've skipped the biryani. I got the Naan instead of rice. The owner is a humble person and cooks up a quick chat while you are there. The line to this joint was getting longer in the short time I was there. I ordered mine and came up to grab a seat. While at it, the customers around me were busy gulping their dosas ! Man, the aroma was mind blowing and being a south Indian myself, I make pretty good dosas myself.. But, did I tell you I couldn't resist the aroma ?! Guess, what happened next, I went ahead and ordered a shrimp dosa to go. Yea, a foodie to the dot. He was more than happy to accommodate it quickly into my menu. The wait was quite a while, but who cares when u can sit there and breathe in the aromas from the kitchen and be assured that all your food is being freshly prepared. I wouldn't mind. I sat up and chat with a few fellow countrymen.. ;) My order was ready and I left with an eagerness to taste the food soon. My kids ( even my 4 year old ) loveddd the food. The fish curry reminded me of home ! Thank you, for that. We were traveling to Quebec after that, so I refrigerated the curry and had it the next day. Tasted even better as we are told back home, biryani and fish curry tastes yummier the next week ! How I wish we had a joint like this near my home. It was my anniversary and we had a scrumptious finish to it. Thanks, Chennai Express for making it happier ! Anyone around this place, do check it out ! You won't regret it at all.."
