/user_details?userid=89pzKs31Wl2-bKY6U3AGmg,Sophie S.,"Cambridge, MA",5 star rating,Best in Montreal if you want to splurge responsibly on these types of sandwiches. Vinh's is the cheaper close second. Wouldn't recommend Vua for any other food/drink items. Their speciality is the BBQ pork or maybe the tofu.
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Lovely Banh mi place. A very good choice for inexpensive meals.I always go for the sandwich, grilled chicken, and with some colorful dessert from fridge. There is hearty spicy instant noodle from Korea. You can add hot water there.I also like the banana ice bar with crunchy peanut. You can go the upstairs if it is full downstairs."

There is a microwave for you to heat the food up. Also available are sushi, and great shrimp onigiri (Vit people do it right). good Vit banana coconut peanut ice cream - what a treat! Will be a regular stop now in Montreal!"

For a quick, cheap (around $5) lunch this place is great. I don't think I'd take the time to go out of my way to come here, but if you're in the area and want something quick, fresh, and delicious at an amazing value, this is a great pick.I honestly can't believe the pricing is as low as it is for the quality. Then to top it all off, the staff is extremely friendly as well!"
/user_details?userid=JzP5uJjhZb0Vj8J_bn3mOg,Gwen W.,"Columbus, OH",5 star rating,"The BEST damn Bahn Mi I've EVER had. Un-freaking-believable. I am smacking myself I couldn't bring home a ginormous cooler full of these Vietnamese sub-like sandwiches and freeze them: One for each day. For the rest of my life. If there's extra room, I'd bring home double the amount. For breakfast. This quite possibly is what I'd ask for for my last meal on earth. At least an extremely close second. Got their small Grilled Chicken Bahn Mi. Extra protein ($1 extra) and avocado ($1 extra). Excellent sandwich. Seriously! The sauce they use, well I forgot to ask the kitchen staff, but it was to die for. I'm having trouble describing it, so just go check it out yourself.A few seats on their outside patio. Wonderful for people watching - man, do Montrealers love their outdoor spaces! Not very big on the inside, but their's more seating in the fast-casual joint right above them. If I could do a UYE for my Columbus peeps here, good gosh I'd do it in a heartbeat. ROAD TRIP!!"
/user_details?userid=41XG-tkYXv7uHubdPgetJQ,Andrew N.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"A hidden gem in Montreal! This banh mi (Vietnamese baguette) shop is sandwiched between a strip of local food places and can be easily missed as it's located down a set of stairs. We came here to stop for a quick banh mi break and here's my rundown:Food - -Saigon Banh Mi - This is available in 7 inches and 10 inches but to be honest, it's a much better deal to get it with 10 inches. This included ham, Vietnamese sausage (cha lua) and pate on top of pickled radish and daikon, marinated carrots, coriander, and various sauces. This Banh Mi was SO good and had so much flavour! All of the condiments went so well with each other and there's also so many different meats you can get. It's so great for those grab and go type of people. Atmosphere - It's located on the lower level of a building so you have to go down a set of stairs to access it. There's some places to sit down but this place is suitable for those who are wanting some quick takeout food. Service -Service here was very good. The employees here give such great hospitality and are very communicative. Perhaps I am a little biased since they were Vietnamese and recognized that I was Vietnamese but I did observe the employees' interactions with other customers and overall, they seemed very welcoming!Price -For a 10 inch banh mi, it was just under $5 which is a great bargain for what you're getting. This is definitely food on a budget except you're still getting quality food with the banh mi.Verdict -Highly recommend this place for some quick eats! They have lots of drink options to quench your thirst and the service here is great and efficient. They also have some asian cooking products / snacks for you to purchase on the side too. It may be a little hard to find but once you check this place out, you will for sure be returning for the food and people."

This was my first stop after leaving the airport. I went up to the counter with a cheer and a simple but friendly bonjour to the older cashier.  I received a blank stare back and am immediately treated terribly as soon as she heard me speak English.  Yelling at me when I didn't understand her thick Vietnamese/French accent in this noise filled restaurant, shaking her head in disgust, shoving the menu in my face in a rage, slamming my credit card and pen on the counter with purposeful force, letting the unsanitary credit card machine drop on top of my food, and not providing me with napkins while she did for other customers.  She has no business working in service with this poor attitude.  And this is coming from someone who lives in New York City.  I'm used to subpar service but she is on another level."

/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Cute little vietnamese sandwich place on St Denis. I've been coming here once in awhile since the opening and have never been disappointed. Along with different variety of sandwiches, they also have sushis, vietnamese street food and finger food. I really like the option of the brown baguette and the choice of 7 or 10 inches baguettes. Made to order, you can also customize your baguette for a little surcharge. The portions are really big and generous! I usually share a 10-inches sandwich with my hubby. There is usually a little line up but the service is fast and efficient. The prices are very reasonable and i believe they also hand out fidelity card for the sandwiches! Give it a try."

Even the little sushi's and premade plates. Be sure to try the chicken balls at the cash. They are amazing! Unfortunately they kept bringing the prices up since they got popular and i dont go nearly as much as i used to.
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I first discovered Vua when hunting for a catering for 100 person call center lunch.  I was getting tired of greasy cardboard pizza and demanded for the lunch budget instead. I first tried Dagwood's with some success but when I ordered Vua grilled chicken sandwich. It was game over.  Vua was an instant hit!!  Agents raved about the sandwiches. That was back in 2010. I've been a faithful Vua-er ever since. There's been some changes the last several years but I can't ascertain.  Maybe in the beginning it was more family that were running the store because it felt like every sandwich was made with TLC. Case in point, recently, I got 3 large grilled chicken sandwiches to go and two were good. I took the third one to work for lunch with the intention of making my lunch mates jealous (muahaha) but joke was on me cause when I opened up the sandwich, the only thing staring me back was baguette and chicken with 0 trimmings. See my photo.  No love for my sandwich at all (T_T) I also always get 3 basil drinks (buy 2 get 1 free) They're like bubble tea but healthier!  The basil seeds hydrate like chia seeds and are so addictive to try to chew!  One cup had moldy tasting basil seeds which was really disappointing.  I couldn't drink it.  So again, it seems like the quality was 2 hits for every 1 miss. Dear Vua owners, if you're reading this, I'm still very sad about my sandwich and drink.  I've been a loyal fan for the last 6 years but recently it's been disappointing."

/user_details?userid=XjQ1OSxbAF29WP5H9vKJSw,Ken N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Yummy! Variety, convenience and enterprising spirit, a rare combination for downtown Montreal imho. Enough said. Apparently I need to be a little more long winded to qualify as a yelp review. So here you go, more words: Sandwiches, sushi and Vietnamese dishes are made fresh. If it's more than 8 hrs old they give you a 30% discount, i.e. after 6pm-ish! You'd be hard pressed to find that kind of enterprising spirit in Montreal.Sandwiches are as good and almost as cheap as on Spedina in Toronto, or Bolsa in Westminster/Garden Grove.I've been going to their original location on St. Denis for 5 years and finally I can now go during work hours to this new downtown location. So looks like these guys will not be the typical fly by night deli that plagues la centreville. Bon courage mes amies!"
/user_details?userid=DPcJ_uf07HgSP-f-noeV_g,V T.,"Springfield, VA",5 star rating,"""Vua"" is the Vietnamese word for king, and this restaurant lives up to that name. I grew up in Toronto, now live in the US East Coast, even ate banh mi in Vietnam - and Vua ranks very close to the top banh mi I've ever had (so take my review seriously because I'm not some clueless American tourist who is new to banh mi). Service:  very friendly and the Vietnamese staff not only speak Vietnamese, they can take your order in French and English. One day I came in right at opening time and was told by the cashier that sandwiches weren't yet available, but when she saw our disappointment she went back and called the kitchen staff to have them make us sandwiches. What sweethearts! There are a few tables inside near the door, a very small terrasse with some more tables, and a shared indoor dining space with Thai Express (but is located one floor above Thai Express, or two floors above Vua). General comment: the sandwiches are loaded with liver pate and housemade soy sauce which is how it's supposed to be done in Vietnam. This ain't your typical lazy banh mi shop in North America that uses bottled soy sauce and acts stingy on pate content. This means your sandwich will drip an oozy mixture of mayo and soy sauce so watch your clothing, but don't despair - only the most legit banh mi will drip in this manner. Also the bread gets toasted before all the other ingredients go in, and ends up with a crispy exterior and fluffy interior. #1 Dac Biet sandwich: Loaded with Vietnamese deli meats, some pate, and priced 50c less than every other sandwich. Amazing value and beautifully balanced flavor with the pickled vegetables. #12 Liver Pate sandwich: No deli meats here, just a massive gob of pate along with the pickled vegetables. It looks frightening to see how much pate they use, and I was so unbelievably excited when I saw them pack in this amount of flavor.Side note, after 9pm the prepared foods (usually between $7-8) are an additional 30% off - this includes delicious plates of fried rice, steamed rice with grilled meat, and/or stir fried noodles. They just need to be reheated.Overall, absolutely solid and authentic banh mi shop in a cute and conveniently located neighborhood, I'm sure to return next time I'm in MTL.Last comment (I promise): $5 credit card minimum."

I've been craving a decent ""Bahn mi"" sandwich now for some now. I've bookmarked this place thanks to reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a shot yesterday.I was NOT disappointed! I went with the BBQ Pulled Pork and the Grilled Chicken. Both were good but the Pulled Pork was out of this world! And for what... $3 each? SAY WHAT?!?They have nice variety of sandwiches (at least 30!) as well as have bubble tea, iced coffee, and pre-made meals including sushi. If you buy a pre-made meal you get a free spring roll!!!SAY WHAT?!?The service is OK but ordering from a lady who can't understand English or French and needed repeated instructions was a bit of a put-off. So I made sure the Bahn mi was done according to my taste. The woman in front of me was irate since she screwed up her order. So beware of that.I'm definitely going to come back here.How can I say no to a $3 delicious sandwich?"

I tossed the whole bag into the garbage and came into this place, wot I should have tried first.The only thing that was weird, was the checkout line moved WAY fast-lots of people in this place. And no English! A little intimidating, especially as when I checked out, the Credit Card machine decided it was time to piss off. Got the stink-eye from a lot of folks in line,  but I made it. Wish there was a place like this close by in the States.I had: Montreal roll sushi, a pair of Vietnamese cold spring rolls with peanut sauce, and a brownie. All fabulous! And pretty cheap to boot!"

It's interesting how most of the hot entrees are in the self-serve refrigerated shelves with the sushi. There is a microwave in the shop where you can heat up your food if you're eating on the spot. The price-quantity ratio is what I found Vua does best. The sushi is also nice and soft, unlike the cardboardy dry texture and taste that a certain other sushi chain tends to offer from their ready-to-eat boxes.But the flavors arent aaaamazing as far as asian cuisine comes. This is a great affordable and tasty meal on the go type of place, a healthier fast food option. Overall I like!"

Nice little Viet shop that allows you to buy pre-made food (i.e. spring rolls, grilled chicken w/rice, desserts, spring rolls).  Cheap and large sandwiches (2 sizes - 7"" and 10""), but I thought they were just average.  I ordered the grilled pork sandwich.  The bread they use is thicker than I prefer (bc it takes up more stomach space!), they put on more mayo than I prefer, and the grilled pork was just average.  Eggrolls are NOT good, so don't order them.I had no issues w/service, but I also am Vietnamese and am just used to Vietnamese service, which can be curt and to the point."

/user_details?userid=EteGefsj2fdR5mJxi0dxbA,Linda F.,"London, United Kingdom",2 star rating,"One of those cases where I got sucked in by just quickly searching for a bahn mi place and only looked at the *stars*. If I'd read more, I'd have found the other two star reviews which mirror my own confusion about why this place is considered good. Just going by the bahn mi, I'm never coming here again. It's missing all the key ingredients of a good bahn mi. The bread is too large and there's no crispy crust. There isn't enough pickled veggies to add the refreshing crunch. Not that adding more would have helped, they were soft, rather tasteless, and sad. Barely any cilantro either. I'm completely bewildered by how the actual product was so bad considering how many fellow Yelpers seem to like this place. The only plus is it was pretty cheap. And they sell many other food options like packaged rice/stirfry or sushi meals. Although given the quality of the bahn mi...consume at your own discretion."

Despite the neverending line (it's essentially a continuous flow of people from open 'til close), there's rarely a sense of rush and the service is always exceptional. Pair this with some tremendously tasty banh mi sandwiches, and it's got all the makings of one of my favourite ""to-go"" spots. In fact, it's so good that even if I'm not hungry, I'll pick up a couple of sandwiches from here whenever I'm in the neighbourhood, just so that I can have them for later."
/user_details?userid=c2BbxDdn6QTy33682gQDvQ,Ju L.,"Osaka, Japan",2 star rating,"Holy scheisse, this place has high reviews. I pray none of them are for the Vietnamese sandwich, which was by far the worst banh mi I've ever tasted.An array of Vua's 10"" Vietnamese sandwiches are $2.95 after 9pm. What a steal! They won't toast them, though, because apparently they turn off the ovens by then. The sandwich is already pre-assembled and bagged so you can be in and out in under a minute.  We went with the classic. Unfortunately the sandwich was terrible - did they put onion gravy in it??? There was an excess of something cloyingly sweet and sticky that is completely foreign to all my banh mi endeavors. The pickled veggies inside were mushy and tasteless instead of providing crunch or tartness. The bread, of course, was spongy and cold but didn't seem like it'd hold up as toasted baguette either. If there was pate in it -sigh!- then it was swallowed up by the strange gooey sweetness. Quebec, of all places to ruin a pate! I had neither high nor low expectations for this place - just hungry! but the banh mi was just a huge disappointment on all fronts besides price.Come here if you just want to be full; 3 bucks for almost a foot of sandwich is a sweet deal. But if you actually know what banh mi tastes like, avoid avoid avoid Vua's offerings."
/user_details?userid=pFxmke6F_xduXhfu3-Qcag,Celeste M.,"Rahway, NJ",2 star rating,"I came in with a few friends and we were really excited to try their sandwiches based on all of the positive reviews. I've had many bahn mi in my day and I'd consider this experience one of my least favorite. Upon entering, you form a line and are surrounded by prepared snacks, meals and drinks. Everything looks great, but is a little pricey. I decided against a prepared meal as most of the reviews were for their sandwiches. I opted for the Saigon sandwich 10"" which cost $3.75. It's on special and all of the other 10"" sandwiches are $4.25. The Saigon has pate, Vietnamese sausage and ham with the radish/carrot slaw and cilantro. After purchasing our food we sat outside to enjoy our meals. There is no covering when you sit in their outdoor area so be cautious on sunny days as it can get a little hot. My first bite into the sandwich was all bread. This wouldn't have been so terrible if the bread wasn't hard and dry. Usually when I eat bahn mi the bread is crispy on the outside but soft on the inside, but this bread was hard and dry out the outside with an inside to match. Needless to say, I ate the sandwich open faced style as the bread tore up the roof of my mouth. Overall the downfall of this place is the following: 1) the bread to meat ratio is off. There's more than double the bread and it's terrible bread. 2) the atmosphere. It's like eating inside a convenience store. 3) The service. You never enjoy coming to a place where you feel like you're inconveniencing the staff."

/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,This place intrigued me since it is literally a stone's throw from my office and I was hearing good things about it.  For downtown the prices are very reasonable and the banh mi itself is quite tasty.  You can get a 10 inch banh mi for only $4.50 and it will do a good job of filling you up.  I went for the BBQ pork and it was very tender and juicy.  They also didn't skimp on the other toppings which I appreciated. The reason I gave this place three stars instead of four is that they handled their lunch rush quite poorly when I came.  First of all the guy taking sandwich orders wasn't following any particular order as he floated through the line and consequently skipped a few people which in turn lead to confusion at the counter.  At the cash the sandwiches were piling up and they were confusing orders so people were waiting longer than necessary.  It actually felt like there were too many people on the floor and it was at the point where it was becoming counterproductive.

There are a few small tables in the lower level shop, but if the cafe is full, there's seating outside and plentiful space upstairs.I ordered a veggie sandwich, taro bubble tea, and coconut tapioca cup. The sandwich was listed as 7"" but looked a little on the small side. The tofu/carrot filling made for a satisfying vegetarian option. The bread was denser and less crisp than the french baguettes I've had at other banh mi shops.  On the other hand, the chewier bread made the small sandwich more filling. Taro bubble tea had great flavor but the cup was stuffed to brim with ice cubes.. reminiscent of Starbuck's volume-filler trick. Minor complaints aside, Vua is exactly the kinda joint I'd like to make a daily stop in. The selection is wide and the service is fast."

Service: The service here is pretty friendly. They gave us some good suggestions and could tell that we were from out of town. They speak both Vietnamese and French here. They gave us two complimentary Cafe Sua Da which were strong and tasty! Just like how a french pressed coffee should be.Food: The sandwiches here are much more rich than the ones that I had in Orange County...mainly because they put a lot of mayonaise/butter sauce on the outside. They even offer to toast it for you. I had the Dac Biet (Special) and tried some of the Xa Xiu (BBQ pork) which were all really tasty. The pate is rich and is probably some of the best pate that I have had. They also offer some take out sushi and che along with french baked goods. You can buy some food to go (there is limited seating) or enjoy your sandwiches out in the park. We took our sandwiches back to our hotel. Bottom Line: Buy 5 sandwiches and get a free drink!"

I think my tea cost more than my sandwich (cheap sandwich, not expensive tea). Good value for a quick and nutritious lunch. The small seating area was clean but quite crowded.

/user_details?userid=aomkMAGFrL-gD6cqQjB4bw,J C.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I've had a lot of banh mi in my lifetime.  And banh mi really varies with preference and what 'region' of Vietnamese food you're most familiar with.  I was a bit skeptical given the lukewarm reviews and the McRestaurant feel of this place (it's like a Subway if Subway did banh mi) - also, it's by all the bars on St.-Denis so they aren't exactly serving a picky audience -- but decided to give it a go.Welp - I liked it.  It ticked the major boxes for me: 'chewy' baguette with a rich mouthfeel.  What was very unusual for me was that they used garlic butter in their house special, which really adds to the flavour.  I could see some people finding the garlic intrusive though.Definitely not the best I've had -- but probably one of the better banh mi spots I've go to in North America."
/user_details?userid=_v3z81xBi0ywHD14NqsNbw,Lori C.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"This was my go-to place when I needed a good, cheap Vietnamese sandwich. Although the workers usually only speak French/Vietnamese, all the sandwiches are labeled by numbers on the big screen, so it's not too difficult to communicate. About $3, and I always get the little sesame dessert balls for about $1.50. All sushi and to-go items are 30% (maybe 20%, not sure) after 9pm. They sell individual pieces of sushi (shrimp, salmon, egg, etc.) for 99 cents which I think is great if you need a small fix.Also, the milk tea + boba is kind of pricey here, but I'm also a California native where I can get it for $2. Here it's around $4ish dollars. Come here for a good banh mi in Montreal. I miss you, BBQ pork sandwich aka #7."

I had a budget of $5 and consulted the MTL Blog for a cheap place to eat that wasn't your everyday sub, and this was the result.I got the BBQ Pork Banh Mi, and it tasted fantastic. The carrots, radishes, and toasting of the bun were just right. Unlike your average sub sandwich, the banh mi's bun is light and airy but still crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. So much flavor in the bang mi! The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was that the BBQ pork was hard to bite off and chew. I got a small (7-inch) for $3.95, which was perfect for my poor-college-student budget.Also, the service was great considering how busy they were. They were friendly and quick even though they had to deal with our big group/first timers. In addition to banh mi, they had a variety of sushi and bubble tea to choose from, but I can't say much on those since I didn't order any."

The bread was toasted to perfection. They also had sushi and other goodies if sandwiches aren't your thing. My only complaint is that the tapioca pudding (che) wasn't of the consistency that it's suppose to be. It was very thick and kind of fell apart. It's suppose to be smooth and creamy but the fault in dessert won't keep me from coming back for their awesome sandwiches.

/user_details?userid=qe_Yiq-Gm60TA9cK0VfbiA,Nina N.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"I consistently liked this banh mi joint since its opening a few years ago. Located in the heart of Latin Quarter, near UQAM, it's a perfect lunch spot for university students on a budget. The Vietnamese subs are decently priced at around $5 for a 7"", and they come with many options of fillings, both Asian and some more Western (ie BLT). I always order the Saigon one (Vietnamese sausage, pâté and cured meat) and I add the spicy peppers. Conveniently wrapped in a clean parchment paper bag, it keeps the bread crispy and warm--practical when hopping back to the campus! I don't understand why some ratings are low: if you're up for milder Vietnamese street food, this is the place to go since the seasoning is less strong than most other banh mi places. The soy sauce is dosed reasonably, there is no excess of fish sauce and the sour, pickled vegetables are kept to a minimum while the mayo is spread diligently. Vietnamese food has the terrible characteristic of being too salty, but this sandwich keeps it decent, since you can ask for a reduction of soy sauce in your sandwich."

The quality of the sandwiches are quite good despite the low price. The ingredients were pretty fresh, and they don't skimp out on ingredients. It's undoubtedly a great bargain for its price.There are also other Asian snacks (such as pre-made sushi, etc.) and drinks in the store, although these tend to be much pricier than the sandwiches."

/user_details?userid=1lRbzzJ5yXGq6K0CpUCbMw,Chris B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I avoided Vua for a long time because it looked so much like a chain restaurant.  I was expecting the Vietnamese version of Thai Express or Sushi Shop. Turns out I was wrong and it's actually just an independent shop that clearly aspires to be the Vietnamese fast food franchise chain of note.At first I thought I arrived in a convenience store (and in some ways it is), but they also have a deli counter where I ordered a Saigon style 10"" Bahn Mi. Their ten inch sandwich was too much for me, next time I'll stick to the regular size.My sandwich was ready mere minutes after ordering.  The staff don't slack, they can get really hammered during lunch time and at $2.95 a sandwich, volume is where their profits lie.Most of the interior is lined with shelves and refrigerators bursting with an impressive assortment of ready made Asian goodies.  It spans from Banh Mi of course to Sushi and Bubble Tea, and lots and lots of imported snacks and drinks.  If you need an Asian fix, but Chinatown is too far away, Vua might satisfy your cravings. They even have a few tables near the entrance and a small terrace for customers.I'm not really an expert on Vietnamese sandwiches, but I have had the real thing.  While not as good as the original, they do serve up a reasonable facsimile.  Is there better Banh Mi in Montreal? Probably, but sometimes it's all about location and Vua is in an incredible spot, and at $2.95 you'll not find a cheaper lunch in the area."

You see them prepare your sandwich like at Subways.They mainly sell banh mi, but they also sell sushi but it's already prepared in advanced and stored in a fridge, there's also bubble tea, iced coffee, vietnamese desert and beverages, they even sell bananas for 75 cent each! Very smart place, you can see where they came from.There's also a 30% rebate after 9 p.m on some products that need to be sold as soon as possible such as sushi, spring rolls and other stuff I can't remember that cannot be preserved for too long.In short, this will be the perfect place for me whenever I will need a lunch to go and I don't have time to make it myself!It's cool to see a vietnamese business thriving and doing so honestly and willingly."

The sauces they used definitely also MADE the sandwich. I also tried the veg spring roll (?) by the cash register. Good, but the sauce they give you with that is way too sweet/fruity. Really above all other details, there's: I got my first sandwich here on Sunday morning. Finished it before getting on the metro. Spent 8 hours thinking about it. Came back to Berri UQAM, got two more. (One for ""dinner"" and one for when I was back home.) Service was also very nice & fast both times I went in there.

We both also wanted bubble tea but the cashier at the time said they were out of bubbles so I ended up just getting an ice coffee slush. My boyfriend ordered a yogurt-based drink with passionfruit jelly. Although both were very good, the next customer who ordered bubble tea was able to get tapioca in their drink.
