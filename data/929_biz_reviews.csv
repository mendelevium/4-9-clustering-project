Parking is tough but well worth it. Great atmosphere in the summertime. Service: friendly, Decor: chic/modern. Jacky Loved the ""Romana"" Pizza. Lunchtime Prices are cool but for supper it goes down a little harder. Give it a shot Jackys!Follow @JackyEatsMTL"
/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I tried out this newly opened location of Fiorellino located on Laurier avenue with my foodie group of friends and enjoyed it! The decor is modern and trendy..very classy looking. They have two floors and are good for groups. Service was super friendly and welcoming which always adds exttra stars to the overall dining experience. The food was absolutely delicious and beautifully plated. The food is made with local products and everything had great flavors. I ordered the squash beet salad which was delicious!  The pizzas are made in a wood burning oven and were super light and yummy!  The pasta dishes are home made and delicious as well. Coffee was great too..I had the cappucino and it was awesome! The only thing I was disappointed in was dessert. Dessert did not taste fresh..we had the zeppole as we had gone back in March. The zeppole tasted stale and was hard. Overall I would go back to this and do recommend trying it at least once.  You can always skip dessert and go to Juliette and Chocolat which is right next door!!

They have another location in Old Montreal, I gather. I dined here recently for a late dinner, at 8 pm, and w made our reservations online via Open Table (so convenient!).I really enjoyed this place! Apparently, it's quite popular, as it was bustling and busy and full when we arrived (note to the wise: make reservations if you plan on dining late). Yes, the place was loud but, to me, a vibrant atmosphere is welcome sometimes. The restaurant interior is what I'd call Euro-modern, with an open atrium-like section and an open lay-out beyond a central bar. Contemporary black and white geometric patterned flooring and modern suspended light fixtures. There is an upstairs loft-like dining space where you can watch the chefs work in an open kitchen (perfect area for a private party!). We were seated promptly and our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. And there are a LOT of choices on the menu, from the appetizers to pizzas to pastas to soups and salads. We all chose various pasta dishes. Mine was a seafood dish - and they definitely had a lot of seafood in it! The noodles were delicious, too and perfectly cooked. The dish was so big that I had to take half of it home. My cousin's dish, however, was surprisingly small (I forget what it was called. She said it was delicious, though, and it appeared to have pine nuts in it. But it was a meager serving and she had to order a salad after she ate it, as she was still hungry). My other cousin had the agnolotti, which he's had before and loves. For dessert we shared a cheesecake with a berry topping; the texture was a tad dry but the flavor was wonderful. My cafe au lait was a perfect ending to the meal!We chatted with the owner afterwards and learned that everything is made here on-site, with ingredients imported from Italy. It is very authentic Italian fare (my cousin is from Milan and is in the food business, traveling to Italy every summer. So he's pretty discerning! Me, not so much. All I know is, it was good!)."
/user_details?userid=aIqDek9d1fDEgLIAWXMGSA,Robert L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",3 star rating,Its a nice trendy place but at the end of the day it's a pizza joint. My pizza was burnt which I was not crazy about. I ordered spicy pizza but this was spicey for a baby. I want spice for an adult. Lol...anyway it's just over priced pizza for me. Would I be back?? Probably not.

The pizza is good, not mind blowing but good. The pasta dishes are good as well. The appetizers are excellent and the bread is out of this world. Service and ambiance are always on point."
/user_details?userid=yRgJ0HkDOkA0UeE09CiXAw,D D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Excellent pizza the way it should be ,great atmosphere nice clean crowd , not much choices to order very small menu, appetizers are extremely small I mean they are so small you almost can't share :) waitresses have no sense of humour they very dry personality plus extremely slow they are all airheads , I forgot her name tall shaved hair lady served us she is sooooooo slow like grandma . We are like 6 people on the table I asked her some bread she brings  us  3 slices of bread I said can I have some more please she replies you want more? :)))) I asked her some olive oil in a plate she brings me like after 10 min while olive oil was right behind her all she had to do was take it from the bar and give to me instead she goes inside and disappears :)))) they should hire better waitress, like I said they are all airheads and don't smile. Because of the location on Laurier street it's possible that location does not draw to much mediteranian clients ( maybe I might be wrong) because us  Italians Greeks Armenians arabs Lebanese etc like to eat  and at this restaurant there isn't much choice to order everything is minimal .would I go back ? Definitely for snack maybe one pizza as snack that's all . It's not a kind of restaurant where you come out with full stomach ;) . So if you have big appetite and big tummy then it's not a place for you . Name of the restaurant matches perfectly with the amount of food they serve you FIorellino SNACK BAR :))))))))"

We had Pizza which were good but never t the very best crust. Suggest getting less toppings. The avocado toast w poached eggs looked great.  Little free cookie treats at end of meal were delicious
