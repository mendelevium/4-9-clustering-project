Luckily, we knew of this cute lil korean spot that is owned by my sister's friend's family. Not only did it satisfy my craving but all the other dishes we ordered were incredibly delicious. There's a large variety of dishes on their menu and I recommend their crispy juicy fried chicken! My sister had also ordered the seolleong-tang which is a refreshing milky beef bone soup!! Amazing home cooked korean food and wonderful staff, can't recommend this place more! I want more gamjatang..."
/user_details?userid=-DOJEuvrpFDs1NKkNMGsfg,Juno Y.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,One of my favorite Korean places in town. Their service and  food s as Keats so tasty and affordable. As a Korean Canadian I approve this restaurant! Highly revoked their Soups!
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"By far the best Korean restaurant I've been to in Montreal! I haven't tried them all but this one is delicious. I was with the hardest person to please when it comes to food. My mother. Even she enjoyed everything and kept on saying how much she loves it. My "" coup de cœur "" was the Korean pancake. It came on a sizzling plate and it was so crispy and hot. It stayed that way until the end of our meal. Everything was well prepared and well seasoned. We loved the service as well. The waiter/owner is a very soft spoken man that was very sweet to us. It was definitely worth driving an hour to this restaurant and worth going almost crazy looking for a parking spot."
/user_details?userid=g1MPo8zaOKLo9QazpThPJQ,Wei T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We came here on Christmas Eve, when most of the restaurants are close.  Didn't regret ! It's a very cozy Korean restaurant. We ordered a seafood pancake, a bento box, and a pork bone soup.   Their food are good, even the side dishes are tasty  In terms of price, they are generally 1$ or 2$ higher than average, but it's totally worth it.  I recommend you guys to try it."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",3 star rating,"Not Korean so can't speak about the authenticity of the meals and flavours but I enjoyed my time here. We were a big group (10) so I was really impressed by how they handled it. Meals didn't take too long, everyone was served around the same time, no mistakes, and they were very friendly! i got the beef teriyaki and the meat was excellent. Cooked and seasoned perfectly, but the noodles were tough and chewy. I got tired of eating them pretty quickly. The rest of my party enjoyed their meals a lot too so I'd say it was a hit! Only reason it's a 4 stars is because I don't think I'd come back unless I was with someone who was really in the mood for korean food. I don't think it's my thing. however, I would really recommend this place if it is your style!"
/user_details?userid=h5eVBQ5DyrpnQOaJ9ycl3g,Shiyue X.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I came here for my friend's birthday on a Thursday and we were a party of 9. We called 2 days ahead to make the reservation and when we got there, everything went smoothly. We were seated and offered a kind of cold Korean tea that I loved! The menu has lots of pictures, so no worries if you've never had Korean food before (like me!) They have a lunch menu and a supper menu. They looked pretty similar, but supper is just slightly more expensive.They have two TVs (one playing Korean music videos and one playing Korean cooking shows ans such) which is nice to watch while waiting for the food... not that it's needed, because the food came SUPER quickly! The portions are very big! I was more than full and I could barely finish my meal! We had to pay at the counter, but that's not a big problem in my eyes. This is a family run restaurant. The parents are in the kitchen and the kids (daughter and son) are waiters. My friend actually knows the owners of the restaurant, so after her meal, they actually gave her a little birthday cheesecake! (You can't even buy it! They made it specifically for her!) Overall, it was a really good experience and I can't wait to go back and discover other Korean dishes!"

/user_details?userid=esia1Khcc0GxoiGvt7eu1g,Arra C.,"Queens, NY",3 star rating,"During my short trip to Quebec and Montreal, Canada I was craving Korean food so i was super excited to find this spot and was excited that the reviews were great! When I got to the restaurant there was a very strong odor of soju or sake. It was kinda weird but did not bother me. The restaurant is decorated so beautifully and i have to say this is the most fanciest Korean restaurant i have ever been to. The place was so clean and so classy but I was not too pleased about the food. I guess because I am from New York and me being Korean, my standard for Korean food is pretty high. I felt the food was too bland and had no flavor. Maybe this is what Korean food is in Canada but it is not something I am used to."
/user_details?userid=l5QUFf1R8FnvYivAigOAiA,Jillian G.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Chose this place for my birthday celebration due to 2 criteria 1. its proximity to our place in Plateau (an absolutely bone chilling night called for short distance traveled) 2. Craving Korean My boyfriend and I arrived around 7 on a Wednesday night to an empty crowd - a large table was leaving as we were arriving so we had the entire place to ourselves the entire evening!We were given some warm green tea to heat us up right away which helped to cure the biting cold. Our server was incredibly friendly & made suggestions to us on her recommendations. We ended up starting with some steamed dumplings which were superrrbbb!! It came with 4 decent sized dumplings & I do wish we got 2 plates. I ordered the bibimbap and my boyfriend ordered the pork bone soup (can't remember the name) - which came highly recommend from our server. Both dishes were DELISH. Heaping sizes, incredibly fresh. I'm so grateful we decided to pop in here - what a wonderful birthday dinner!"
/user_details?userid=67Aj5cW5xS6OkvNj6kcvsw,Hannah G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"One of my favorite parts of dining is experiencing an array of flavors over the course of a meal. I felt this mission was achieved during my time at Hansang. I ordered beef bibimbap and a Korean beer called Kloud and was overjoyed to discover it came with miso soup, and a selection of pickled appetizers (seen in picture). The service was pleasant and down-to-earth, as was the decor, although it was not special or much of an addition to the experience in any way. I left feeling satisfied and the price was pretty good; I paid $26 for my meal, a beer and the appetizers it came with. All in all, I enjoyed, but do not think it is a must-visit restaurant, especially if you are a tourist in Montreal for a limited time."
/user_details?userid=Xr-xohBaLoCTem7lf77_LA,Isabelle V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is a great korean restaurant on Park avenue. I've had the poulet Katsu with miso soup, tea and Sake. The dish is served with rice ans a salad (the pink salad dressing was really good). The breaded chicken was served with sauce. The service was really nice. Oh and of course, they serve the egg/kimchi/green peppers as appetizers. The ambiance is nice it's a small restaurant but good quality. I obviously recommend it."

/user_details?userid=xvh1EquIPTesUAySOnA6zA,Ava L.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,"Even though this place gives only little bit of banchan (side dishes) and we didn't feel like it was authentic Korean, it was still good as we were craving for Korean food after we had French 5 days in a row in Quebec. There was no Korean place at all in Quebec City, so we were somewhat even thankful when we found a Korean restaurant in Montreal. I'm not sure though if I'll go back to this place if and when I visit Montréal again. Maybe my expectation is too high as I'm Korean."
/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Recently went to this Korean resto located on Parc Avenue and really enjoyed the food and ambiance. Service was good except if you are a big group of more than 8, it can be a little slow but well worth the wait! This is a family run resto and is grear for any occasion. Good for groups of 10 max as well. The resto itself is small with a lovely zen-like ambiance/decor. You feel this sense of relaxation once you seat down and admire the asian inspired decor. The food was very delicious and authentic!  Each dish had a beautiful presenation and tasted yummy packed with flavors all reasonably priced!  They have an excellent table d'hote selection which includes soup/salad/ dumplings, main meal and coffee/tea dessert! We tried their dumplings, terriyaki chicken with noodles, bbq ribs... all were delicious! They also serve korean beers. Service was super friendly and they did try their best to offer us good service despite being a big group!  Will definately go back to try their other dishes..I highly recommend this resto to be tried at least once !"

Keep in mind that I'm not Korean and don't have extensive Korean culinary experience but I do try bibimbaps at different places often, this is the best bibimbap I've had so far !! Ingredients were fresh, each perfectly seasoned, the meats were good cuts, the egg on top was perfectly sizzling and gooey once I broke it to mix. Presentation was beautiful, service was impeccable! Will totally come back!"
/user_details?userid=y1jXfNPsBXQJ_vPDUFc7Fw,Daniel S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"A group of buddies and I were in Montreal for the weekend and we were getting pretty sick of poutine and bagels by the 3rd day. We checked out a couple other Korean places near our place but nothing met our standards. I found Hansang was relatively close and funny enough, right across the street from the poutine place we were getting tired of. First impressions are highly important for me, and trust me when I say this place did not disappoint. Very elegant and modern furnishing with a bit of traditional Korean artwork and other decor splashed in to remind you that you aren't here for a steak and wine dinner but some hearty Korean goodness. We came around a short while before they closed so the restaurant was more or less empty and came back the very next day for lunch before catching our trains back home. Both times were not busy at all. The service was great (except one friend who had a couple hiccups in service both times), the food was more or less exactly what you'd expect. They also informed us they had a 10% discount for students which is nice. The only real downside I'd say would be the prices are a tad high from what I'm used to, but probably what you'd normally expect if you live in Montreal. Also their banchan game is weak lolAlso: It looked like they have public wifi but I couldn't be bothered to ask them for the password."

My partner ate half of it after ""trying"" some.  I ended up eating the most of her beef ribs which were super tender. The service was very attentive and friendly considering there were two large groups before us.  We loved the Korean videos on the TVs.  Hilarious!  Looking forward to our next visit."

/user_details?userid=BxOG479iEleffbKoR_X3Mg,Tania P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This Korean loved her Korean food experience. The food was exactly the way it should taste and the service extended my expectations by far. My friend convinced me to order the octopus balls after mentioning I wasn't exactly a fan and I certainly have no regrets. We then followed with the seafood soup, which I feared would be volcano spicy. Don't be fooled by its colour. The level of hotness was perfectly mild. On to the beef bulgogi, I must underline how I appreciated the fact that they didn't use cheap quality meat like most Korean restaurants in Montreal. To finish off, we tried the red bean and green tea ice cream, which usually never fails to satisfy. Forgot to mention we had a very much affordable bottle of white wine. Voilà! You must try this place. It kicks the butt all the other Korean joints in town. :))"
/user_details?userid=lDSwCgPW0FjJL2L3IJaz9A,Audrey P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3 star rating,"Waiter was very kind to us. The food was tasty but kind of over priced. The banchan was limited and you have to pay if you want to get more. The menu is kind of expensive for what you get and the place overall isn't bad, it's just that you can find better korean food at a lower price. However, if you're in the neighborhood and are craving korean food, not a bad spot to pick."

/user_details?userid=qIqECjnASpbLf-r4tTNs9Q,Mieko O.,"Burlington, VT",5 star rating,"We stopped by here for late lunch with our toddler. We started with miso, fried vegetable dumplings, and a fried octopus. I had a bento box with pork, avocado and cucumber sushi, salad, fried dumplings and spring roll, and rice. My husband had the bibimbap, which arrived in a sizzling stone bowl. Both dishes were filling and flavorful. The service was excellent as they accommodated our daughter who was hungry and tired. A wonderful place to stop in on a cold spring day."
/user_details?userid=3gGo8mT2yozLprrIv9stEg,Talia F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Yay! I am so happy! This place has just opened - right around the corner from my place - and it's fantastic! A family run business where the husband is front of house and the wife and another chef do the cooking. The food is prepared with pride and love and was delicious. For a newly opened restaurant the service was seamless - and even more than that - friendly and generous as we were given an additional appetiser dish on the house. It was a mushroom salad with yuzu dressing that wasn't on the menu but the chef wanted us to try it - and it should be! We ordered the Korean pancake (vegetarian), the beef bulgogi, 2x bibimbaps, the tofu and kimchi stew (a fave), and the sweet potato glass noodles (another fave!) and there was plenty of food! Along with the complimentary mushroom salad, we were given kimchi, and some pickles to start and also had cold roasted corn tea (delicious!) so I would say this was a very well priced meal around $25 per person. The food was all very tasty and the portions were generous - we were 5 and we had plenty to try from each dish. They are yet to obtain a liquor license so we did not drink. I am very happy this restaurant has opened and I wish them every success! Go try it!! Let's keep this neighbourhood full of local, independent and family run businesses like this one! I look forward to returning. 3rd time here!Love it so much!!!!!"

I ordered the kimchi jigae with pork which was on the sweeter side but it sure cured a queens girls craving for Korean food. The pajeon was also delicious! Would come back again.
/user_details?userid=J3USxRf_ZWifJYIogktc6A,Minhee K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've come here many times since it opened and I will say it is one of the most authentic Korean restaurants in Montreal, especially in the Plateau/Mile End area. I mostly get their pork bone soup (Gamjatang) when I'm here because it is honestly one of the best ones I've had (and I am Korean/from Toronto). Otherwise I have had many of their stews and they've all been great. As an appetizer, I always get their seafood pancake. It's super crispy and delicious!The service here is awesome and the food is prepared with care. I have also had a birthday party here with 20 people and everything went super smoothly. They are very accommodating! I will say that the prices are not cheap. For one stew + rice meal, the average price is $16 which is considered really high for Korean stew meals. However, taking into account its location and the quality of the food, it's worth it! This place is as authentic as it gets - I highly recommend this restaurant!"

Wish there were more restaurants of this sort in town offering honest, friendly, and fresh home-cooked meals. We tried the Gamja-Tang and the Bibimbap. They were both incredibly flavorful. Unlike many other restaurants, we did not leave with a bloated feeling, only with the sweet scent of our dishes. The prices were incredibly reasonable as well. A bonus for the complimentary corn tea."

I went twice with a big group so I was able to try a lot of the menu. All was delicious. The service was quick and friendly- all family run and the Chef also trained at the Culinary Institute of America! They also have a liquor license now so you can get sake and Korean beer with your food. Dolsot bi-bim bap was awesome, as was the bulgogi, they have a seafood pancake but since we were with vegetarians we requested it veg and they were so accomodating! It was delicious. We also tried the tofu kimchi stew which was yummy and we recommend getting a side of kimchi -its a littel extra but totally worth it. Also had the yuzu creme brulee for dessert! Oh and ask for the Corn tea water when you come in - it's free but otherwise they give you the plain water and the cold corn tea is really refreshing and yummy."

For the service they were definitely number one! I was astonished with the corn tea because it was the first time I was served with it since I came to Montreal. The place was really clean and cozy with a very warm waiter. We ordered Bibimbap and Korean Ramen which were both delicious! And the Kimchi was amazing too. We'll come back again for sure!
