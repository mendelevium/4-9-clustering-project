Today was time to experience a lunch there. The place is absolutely gorgeous, a mix of the place's history with modern. It's bright and colorful and highly fancy. My knid of place. We all took the table d'hôte, everything was delicious from the simple salad to the decadent desserts, even my beet soup was stunning and tasteful. I felt the options were simple, things you know, but made i  an elevated way. Perfect! On the wine side, there was some good choice, nothing extravagant but all good quality. We didn't try the cocktails but they seemed great. I'll have to try them another time. Everyone was nice and cheerful, helpful in a natural way. I simply had a great time, thanks."

Firstly, the space is incredibly beautiful; high ceilings, marble, brass lighting, beautiful wood tables, etc. I can go on and on but you need to see it for yourself. The ambiance was great; the noise level was not too loud even though the restaurant was full, the music was fitting, and the clientele was classy. You definitely felt transported to another world if it weren't for the busy hustle of St Catherine street. Secondly, the service was impeccable! Our waitress Raphaëlle was gracious and friendly. Her recommendations on both the dishes and wines was spot on. The manager visited our table on numerous occasions for feedback on our evening. The staff paid attention to details and were courteous in compensating one of us who's food had to be redone as it didn't pass the chef's liking; she waited for a minute (yes, a minute) while we were all served. Finally, the food, although the prices may seem steep for portion, you are certainly paying for the great quality, beautiful presentation, and crazy delicious dishes; I especially loved my foie gras entrée served with brioche and cherry jam. The île flottante dessert was divine; light and delicate, just plain perfection.Overall, the evening was a win for all of us and we'd definitely put this restaurant on our re-do list."

The food was... so so... I had the foie gras (it was ok but nothing amazing). I had the lobster with asparagus, once again it was ok but so so... The problem came after we paid. The waiter who probably wanted to come back to his place early started to interfere in our discussion. I was talking about Montreal to my friend who comes from New York. He started to talk to me very arrogantly telling my friend that what i was saying was not true and he started claiming that Vancouver was way better that Montreal... Anyway it was very misplaced and i am still shocked to be honest. At the end he finished the discussion by a ""J'en ai rien a foutre!"" (I don't fucking care)... In a 5 star hotel it's more than shocking, I have to add that i was with my young boy... We paid about 600$ for a meal where I end up writing this review instead of enjoying my night... I was surprised when i learned that i can make a reservation in this place the Thursday night 1 hour before, now i understand why. This place will close soon it's unbelievable to have this king of 3rd class waiter. I was about to go back and ask for a refund i probably should have done that... One advice : Go to the 4 season restaurant or the Biiru next to this awful place instead.To avoid absolutely."

Went for lunch today and wasn't very busy for a Sunday. I had the gazpacho and the beef tartare which were both fantastic. Would 100% order them again.  My friends had the croque madame and the omelette, both of which were delicious. Service was great as well."

It was beautiful, from the decor to the service and of course the food. The side of mushrooms was insanely savory. Every dish looked and tasted amazing. What truly stood out was the expert and knowledgeable service. I ordered a Cucu La Praline for desert, which was a drink but with mousse à la praline, it was crazy delicious. We also ordered off menu a few Îles Flottantes for dessert, which is a delecacy that I hadn't enjoyed in years. Just a wonderful time for a special experience when in Montréal."
/user_details?userid=QtNdvvUyQTs7VIAVZV-2pw,Malvina L.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Food: very unique ingredients if you dont like experiencing new food dont suggest it has specific taste and the portions are not big for the price you pay. I got the polish cocktail and it was a bit too strong. Tips: they dont give you bread until you ask for it even though its free of charge. Location: very aesthetic interior very modern and classic.
/user_details?userid=1maSHx5dyZIO7-NXGerzIw,Brigitt H.,"Greensboro, NC",5 star rating,"The restaurant is a beautiful art-deco room. The beauty of the '20's has been kept. The service was very good. I have to say that the waiter was especially 'taken' by my father-in-law (or so it seemed, and barely addressed me).  The food was very good. I had the salmon tartare and my father-in-law had the cod, and we were very happy with our choices. The bread was very good, as was the butter. The glassware is just beautiful. Fare prices."
/user_details?userid=FPPXD00gg_exGRCt3xwxdg,Sandy P.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,"The room is absolutely beautiful!!! Cocktails were lovely. My hamburger was disappointing. Rather bland and the bun,  a yummy brioche bun, could not hold up to the burger and I ended up having to eat it with a fork and knife. The fries were good. I wanted to finish on a positive note so I ordered the profiteroles.Figuring it is a French restaurant and the desserts must be special. Wrong!! A waste of calories. But the most disappointing of all was the service, or better yet the total lack of it. The ladies next to us also commented about the poor service as were discussing the  features of the beautiful restaurant"
/user_details?userid=XEqApY2jtSPdGptPsJHumg,Lucy F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The food is delicious... not mind blowing but combined with the beautiful setting, you can expect a lovely meal for a reasonable price. HOWEVER, I am not sure I would go back because of my experience with the manager. Our reservation was at 2 PM. Since we had to wait quite a while for the valet, we ended up getting in the restaurant at 2:09, where we were told that the kitchen was closed. They went to get the manager who confirmed that the kitchen closes at 2:30 and that they stop taking orders at 2:15. When I pointed out that it wasn't 2:15 yet, he simply shrugged and said there is nothing he could do!?! We were leaving when the hostess who had gone to the kitchen while we were talking to the manager came to tell us that the kitchen was ok with receiving orders until 2:30. I guess the manager just felt like finishing early today. It's appalling that such a high end place is managed so poorly. In the end, I am grateful that the hostess was so kind and the service itself was great. Also, they are one of the few places that serve Paris Brest for desert and it was excellent."
