Now that I've tried a few options, it's my favourite place to eat at where I work.I usually get their deal of the day, or a plate of pasta. The deal of the day comes with a soda and they always fill it up to the max! (in fact, when I insert my straw soda always overflows)The people who work here are super nice! They greet you with a smile, prepare your food Â in no time and always make sure you leave satisfied. The man that usually serves me always asks me if I would like garlic bread, if I need more napkins, etc...The food itself is better than the other chains I've tried and it's the only place to get spaghetti. It's pretty hard to mess spaghetti up. I think their Bolognese sauce is tasty and simple. The meatballs that come in it are also ok. So far I've tried the lasagna, the spaghetti, and the poutine. I think their spaghetti is their best meal.Vanelli's is a fun change to the endless burger/hot dog joints that we see in every food court. It's good cafeteria style ish food. Perfect for lunch."
