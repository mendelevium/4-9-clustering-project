/user_details?userid=jbgGoTl11dDpcw0IYeL58g,Laurene A.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"We went to La Cage on a Saturday hoping to watch college football and boy did we get it!! They have HUGE screens everywhere, there is not a bad seat to be had. It was actually very quiet when we went, and after a few hilarious table changes due to some staff confusion about which tv would have what game, we ended up situated directly between the two games we wanted and the manager even came over to hang out and was impressed with the view himself! We ordered a plate of wings to start, and I suggest that if you like them saucy, specifically request that they be tossed in the sauce, or they will come dry. The wings were very, very small, and we overheard another table saying the same thing. Perhaps it was just that batch, but I would suggest ordering more than you think you would want. Our table had three burgers and one poke salad, all of which were outstanding! The poke salad was very large, and the dressing was like nothing I have ever had (and I eat ALOT of poke). The burgers so fresh, and the buns were so buttery and perfectly grilled. They brought us popcorn to the table, which was a nice touch, and the cider selection is really great! Don't be surprised by the bathrooms though, they are European style with individual floor to ceiling closed stalls, and communal sinks. The staff was all SO nice, and had no problem conversing with us in English. This place could get really packed during hockey season, so go early!!"

Free self-serve popcorn- extra salty so you can keep washing it down with those beers. A group of us had excellent service last night. Can't remember her name but she was great in tending to all our needs and offering various options. Overall, a decent place if you're into sports. Seating downstairs is the better option. Thursdays are half price wings night!"
/user_details?userid=LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Half priced bottle of wine after a shitty Wednesday. Free wings since the Habs scored 5 goals last game. Julie the barmaid was kind and friendly, offered the nightly special of wine and free wings to all her customers and was approachable throughout her speedy service. Bilingual switching based on customer needs and was empathetic in her interactions with her coworkers. She ran her service section flawlessly and was polite not to prod as I downed my wine like a single mom."
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I have never been impressed by le Cage venues, unless I am hockey night mode- I don't mind paying for a beer with complimentary popcorn. We came here for a girls night. Of course- we are going to be the weird crowd that orders wine at a pub (not myself but the others).The wine selection is mediocre- but the bottles are reasonably priced if you are counting on coming in a group to split the charge.They don't have much choice for rose.Food: The food quality is poor- lacking flavour, and undercooked. However- I guess I would pick McDonalds over this place.Service: It would be nice to have a waiter that respects a group of women and doesn't constantly make inapropriate sexual jokes while being served- being friendly clients doesn't mean we want to take your crap."

/user_details?userid=KDNM_tFtj1w-8s2ERTotWA,Armand S.,"Pasadena, CA",4 star rating,"This place is massive and awesome! One of the best sports bars to watch sports and have a few drinks. Strolled into this place for the GGG vs Canelo fight and it was packed!  We were still lucky enough to get a seat even though the fight was just about to start.There are TVs everywhere at every angle so you don't miss a beat.  My friends ordered and shared the nachos which were quite big, and I had their cookie sundae which was surprisingly more delicious than anticipated.  Didn't drink because of the night before, but my buddies ordered some local beer."

/user_details?userid=9UCEwWtZL_uWQEUogaXfEw,Michael N.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"If this is your first time in Montreal, you're a hockey fan, and looking for an authentic experience, you can't miss this place right next to Centre Bell!This place was a lot of fun, and one of the more unique sports bar experiences I've ever had right outside of an arena. The food was pretty good- I had the Buffalo chicken sandwich with poutines on the side and a glass of beer from a local brewery. Nonetheless, this place is all about the atmosphere, and for a hockey fan it is heaven! Gigantic TVs showing Canadiens game, everyone was wearing their red sweaters, and the place was alive!! One of the last true hockey towns remaining. Proof the sport isn't dead just yet!!"
/user_details?userid=d5z8gkezgPSLP4ANWuNBgQ,Michael M.,"Laval, Canada",3 star rating,"Unfortunately this is the location from this huge chain at a prime location in downtown Montreal inside the biggest sport and entertainment complex in Quebec that has the least desirable food. It is not always fresh and unfortunately lacks flavour. I've brought my mom with me during happy hour so we could catch up on a few things and enjoy some chicken wings and beer. The beer was amazing as always. She never drinks beer and I had ordered a Reserve Blanche. She fell in love with it and kept on raving on how refreshing it tasted and how light and not bitter it was. She is sold. They then came with a platter of 16 chicken wings that were mostly burned and placed meticulously in a way facing the parts that were overly cooked while hiding the burnt parts. For the first time in my mom's 64 year of her entire life she demanded I returned the meal. They took it back with no apology and returned a few minutes later with fresher wings.  I requested for 911 wings with blue cheese and the wings were not even near Buffalo spicy. My mom even said, those wings lacked so much kick, she didn't even need to use the napkins to blow her nose nor wipe a few tears due to the lack of spiciness. The poutine was less than ok with barely meat and gravy as they had advertised. I don't believe I will be going back to this location but I'm definitely loyal to this chainThey've made some major renovations but it still feel small inside out of all the other establishments I've been, it's definitely the smallest. PS I just realized I didn't snap a pic of the wings."
/user_details?userid=02IwduZhVcwjUt1HCf_f7g,Tero J.,"Vallila, Helsinki, Finland",4 star rating,"A hockey fan in Montreal needs to visit Bell Centre at least once, even though I'm not a Canadiens fan as such. One of the best burgers I've had for some time: Alarm. Bacon & jalapeno added just the right amount of extra taste to raise above an average hamburger. Patty was perhaps slightly overcooked but that did not matter. For 15 dollars it was not cheap but worth the price. Sat at the bar, quick'n'friendly service. A number of interesting beers on the tap, so I did not have to settle for yet another mediocre lager... Would I return: yes, for sure. Burger was fine as was the beer, not to even mention the legendary location"
/user_details?userid=jblybcmuvqhfULvuKWYo_g,Alice L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Had a Daiquiri and 16 wings! Both the flavor of the food and drinks, and the interior design of the place are very decent! And I love the 5 score-8 wings deal there! There's free popcorn too. The waitress I got  was not very nice, but it's not that bad."
/user_details?userid=ao7Jt5QoBWO15lGdZH16Kw,Christina T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Right next to the Bell Centre, this place is really great. We got a seat near a window, I ordered a Poké bowl with salmon tartare, a wine rosé, and a Shirley Temple. When the meal arrived, half of the bowl has rice, salads, salmon, and a mayo type cream included.  The wine complimented well with my meal and I was in heaven with the Shirley Temple. My meal was deducted from the 15 dollars I have received as a birthday gift. Overall, the price is decent for the location and the service was superb!"
/user_details?userid=_9YTvJUJrM0zU2nPi8H3oA,Michael D.,"La Habra, CA",2 star rating,"Got in early before Saturday's game so we had our pick of tables.  With two hours to game time ALL the tables were full with a line up the stairs, out the door, and down the block.  Message is get here early!Menu and food was very average.  There were no reference to Habs teams or stars of the past, only average bar food.She had chicken strips with fries and I had a cheese burger with fries.  Chicken was coated well but not over done.  Taste was good.  Burger was over cooked (no choice offered) but with sauce it more than made up.  Only complaint would be with the fries.The fries are skin on, non-coated, seconds.  They sucked.  The house is over serving fry bits rather than spending more for a better quality fry and serving less (bigger, unbroken to give better plate coverage).  Restaurant operations 101.Service was friendly and mostly on point.  Bottom line, there are other places to spend you sixty bucks pregame."
/user_details?userid=ScnXsbny4x6dPYTh5MeD1g,Megan S.,"Massapequa, NY",5 star rating,"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! As a New Yorker this place is the move for whenever you're in the Montreal area. I stayed in Montreal for a weekend with my family and we winded up eating here twice that's how much we enjoyed it. The staff is very nice, it's very kid friendly, and the drinks are AMAZING. Highly recommend the bloody Mary's and lobster tacos if you're into that"
/user_details?userid=Cnb-zc14XLXV0A3rri_q8w,Shazia K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"One of my favorite traditions is to go to this Cage before a hockey game to enjoy some popcorn and nachoes. Watching a game on their big TV screens is also a lot of fun. The vibe in there is always enjoyable as you can feel the hockey fever all around you. I usually don't stray from my usual order of nachoes, which are delicious. The endless supply of popcorn is a bonus. Service can be a bit slow but it's to be expected when you go right before or during a game. The waiters and waitresses have always been nice and full of energy. We always have fun conversations about the game with them. Overall, it's always been a great experience for me to dine here with fellow habs fans."
/user_details?userid=VXjL8mrmJplOFXHvZLBZqA,David S.,"Brookline, MA",5 star rating,Was visiting Montreal during the AFC championship game of New England Patriots vs Jacksonville Jaguar was looking for a sports bar and my hotel recommended here.   The atmosphere was great since the Bruins were playing as well.   Staff was very friendly and food was great.   Will be back.
/user_details?userid=JyvZRVWCxkgoDpAtQh21UQ,Jeanne S.,"Newmarket, Canada",3 star rating,Came here after a Canadiens game - food is ok but the music is loud and you will feel like you're in a dance bar. Not really a sports atmosphere.
/user_details?userid=sgO-FwBPk9ILVodd9H-QMQ,Lawrence B.,"Outremont, Canada",1 star rating,Lousy Service.  Ordered 500ml bottle of wine to start.  I have been here for 2 hours and not one person has asked if I would like to eat.  What a joke.  I get it.  It's a bar.  They don't care about food.  So why have a menu.My advice. Eat elsewhere.
/user_details?userid=5v9I0UWJGUzDxSk2uIyEpQ,Ren G.,"Windsor, Canada",4 star rating,"A great place to watch the game. They were accommodating with my food allergies, gluten and dairy, and offered me more then just a salad. I had the roasted chicken which was very tasty with fries."
/user_details?userid=hFywwFjQ4u_e15U0d8nvjQ,Alex L.,"San Diego, CA",1 star rating,"Food was terrible; ""buffalo"" wings lacked sauce - they were so dry I thought they'd brought me the wrong order.  Didn't want to finish those, so I ordered the blitz burger, which, while better than the wings, was still pretty bad.  Could've gotten a better burger at any of a dozen places in the neighborhood.Service was just as bad.  It was a slow night (only 7 of us seated at the bar) when the Habs weren't playing, and I still couldn't get the bartender's attention.  After giving up on the cheeseburger, I couldn't get her to bring me my bill until I got up and started to walk out - that finally got her attention. I wasn't waiting just a short time, either - I was holding my credit card and trying to get my bill the last 7 minutes of the Buffalo-Edmonton game.I get that it's a Canadiens bar, and 20 years in California means my French is now terrible, but the staff should be able to find time to take care of everyone when it's that slow.  And there's no excuse for the ""quality"" of food they were putting out tonight.I flew in today, and am meeting up with friends tomorrow to go to the game.  They asked me to find a place for the 6 of us to go beforehand.  La Cage has far and away the best location for that, but there's still no way I'll ever be back."
/user_details?userid=l225T13jVCNSZVSa0et_gg,Rick J.,"Delavan, WI",2 star rating,"Food Not bad and slightly overpriced.  When I visited they were short on staff. Wait staff was hustling. So  .....if your glass isn't full or the staff is direct, don't short tip ."
/user_details?userid=_NGT4E2PKQ-L4hYakaxaBw,Becky S.,"Wichita, KS",4 star rating,"I was in Montreal for work and because my hotel was just a block or two from this sports bar I decided to give it a try on night. I was presently surprised when I was seated and took a look at the menu, they have a good selection of beer and different foods. The prices were moderate and the service was prompt, it's a great place for a quick bite to eat, I recommend the spaghetti!"
/user_details?userid=Ui9yJYh6fR8hJ7hZd_yIMQ,Samantha L.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"There are a few of these restaurants. We do not normally like chain restaurants, but really enjoyed this one. We visited two different locations because we liked it so much we were craving their wings. The beer was good (and local choices) and we also ordered the black pepper and salt wings and salmon tartare lettuce tacos."
/user_details?userid=LGRg7o217VOQcAgTLHXCPg,Erik M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Had a great time here! I did not come on game night so it was amazing, fast service and hot food. The staff was really friendly and not stressed out. The jumbo TV screens had poker games playing, which is kinda boring, but I still had laughs watching it. The food was food good, and a nice little spicy zing to the chicken wings. Lots of beer to choose from which is mostly tap. The soft drinks come in a large glass mug which is great because it lasts longer. It took the staff a while to refill the popcorn machine. They only refilled it when I finished my dinner.In then end had a good experience."
