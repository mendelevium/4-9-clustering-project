/user_details?userid=aH-e0gtf7cLjqPpfC0C7Gg,Remi R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Best food and most affordable. The ambiance is nice, service is excellent. I always order their mezza platter for two, and their casa grecque filet.Also their kids meal is convenient for my son. We always go there when there is time for a nice meal, and it is bring your own wine.Also I tried their fried calmari and it was excellent."
/user_details?userid=hV5P36JyNyeBSu8zTIFntQ,Shakil A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Classic diner style restaurant with average food. The decor is a bit old school yet very comforting. I would totally bring my older uncles and aunts here because I know they would enjoy it. The food is really really average and borderline bland.That being said the price is very afrordable. Their lunch menu has items between 11-19 CAD and you get a soup and coffee with the meal. I would have given them 1 star more if the service was consistent - sometimes they would sit me and forget about me but sometimes they are really nice. Also, I think they deserve that I mention that once I left a 2000 CAD envelope by mistake and came back 1 hour later and they saved it for me!"
/user_details?userid=OP7nO0dIaYW0O6DYX8-azQ,Charles H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I had fresh fried calamari and it was delicious, the other two dishes, the fish and the beef were also really good. The wait staff was friendly and courteous and the price was very reasonable. You can bring your own beer too ! I am not quite sure it is authentic Greek food since the restaurant is in Montreal, Canada, not in Athens nor Thessaloniki, but whatever I was served was good, so good that I am giving them 5 stars and plan to come back."
/user_details?userid=EI2D5_q_qgmfuYxPmQ2KTQ,Isaac W.,"Fremont, CA",5 star rating,"Amazing food.  From the bread to the salad to the salmon and shrimp,  it was amazing.  Would go here again.  Was visiting Montreal from San Francisco and found this place."
/user_details?userid=1V7883W5i_F3mptabTXFIw,Sarah S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Decent diner style food with a little Greek touch (not an authentic Greek place). If you're someone who loves a bang for your bucks then this is a must try, HUGE portion that leave you super full. Items are around $23-$27 but comes plateful. I took grilled Atlantic salmon with skewered shrimp. The salmon was slightly over cooked but I enjoyed it nonetheless, you can barely go wrong with salmon; also came with beautiful lemon butter sauce on the side. What I really loved was the seafood casserole appetizer, really cheesy and creamy and goes so good with seafood, served hot and straight out of the oven. I might go back just for the casserole. Generally a safe bet if you're entertaining a large group because it's a type of place that can cater to a variety of tastes."
/user_details?userid=yzGsdfBz1O1Vc-QjhNQAFg,Coolie V.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I much prefer Arahova, the menu is tired and boring, the soups and creams fromCans diluted in water no thanks and the garden salad sucks that's why we must always pay extra for Caesar and the desserts suck but better this than junk food I guess"
/user_details?userid=7aLoLO-lhMqhyNlyShFLSg,Joanne M.,"San Juan Capistrano, CA",5 star rating,"Excellent, friendly service throughout our wonderful dining experience.  The ambience is relaxing and lovely, the food outstanding through and through. Thank you for providing us with a most enjoyable dinner. We would certainly recommend your establishment to anyone! Thank you"
/user_details?userid=E5nRF4bClGRgpo9JeCHfqg,Suganya H.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,I had the only vegetarian dish in the restaurant which was tomato cheese cannelloni  and it tasted really good. It's BYOW! I went with my friends and they said even the other dishes they had was good.
/user_details?userid=WHUCDaYFo7sDl0b6-2hlWQ,Silvia C.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I spent years of my life in Greece. I learnt to cook authentic Greek food. I eat, obviously, real Greek food and when it comes about Greek food...I am home :) Leaving my absolute modesty aside, I was very disappointed by Casa Greque. No authenticity at all! Even the tzatziki was a hybrid of what I know, not to mention simple dishes like Greek salad and souvlaki that were not even close to the real ones. Spanakopita was ok, but I sensed a lack of ingredients in it.I understand that you must adapt to the tastes of the customers, but I am sure that everyone, no matter the origin, would appreciate much more the real flavours of Greece.The place didn't make me say OPA, but whatever..."
/user_details?userid=GEUvYA-toCxNl3snvnaT_w,Margaux Mae A.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Ver very bad experience. I work in the restaurant industry, hence I am more understanding to factors such as slow service etc. However, this place was so bad that I am writing the review right now sitting here. I just ate the very salty calamari and waited long time for the entree. We were already standing close to the door and would just want to pay because we did not get our food yet for a long time. Then our waiter has the food on his hands and went to us. So we just sat back and my friends ate. I had lost appetite so i did not eat the entree.Whenever I'm in a resto im observant, so i know that there was a couple that came in after us, then a big group. The couple already had their entree way before we got our. And the big group are getting all their entrees when we were at the door."

/user_details?userid=EmQCQ4IbousiY35BN2_TuQ,Georgia A.,"Meriden, CT",4 star rating,"Walking around a residential neighborhood, we found Casa Grecque on Rue Prince Arthur, Est for lunch.  This was one restaurant that we ate at during our week in Montreal that was clearly a local place and it did not cater to tourists.  That was a good experience.  The service was friendly and accommodating; the food was fine.  We enjoyed our experience there."
/user_details?userid=v5F9WWMgIg6vljePjpcURw,Mu A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It was a good restaurant, we had fun. But our waiter was really rude and not helpful. But still had fun with my friends"
/user_details?userid=NqwrG7LSiUXvQMDXoA4n2g,Jeffrey F.,"Concord, Canada",2 star rating,"Blah. The restaurant is the last Greek restaurant on Prince Arthur and it should probably have closed. The salad was overdue and the dressing was tasteless. The salmon was overcooked.  The waiter was OK but not terribly attentive. There are a ton of great restaurants in Montreal. This is not one of them.  Plus, Prince Arthur has lost any of its glory from years gone by.  What a shame but time to move on."

/user_details?userid=Tbht_lTA_pm93WReSyDxxQ,J. D.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,We visited Casa Grecque tonight.  Been awhile since we have been to the area.  Food was great and reasonably priced with good portions.  Service was friendly and attentive.  We will be back.
/user_details?userid=zFlevkutYdkXpegL199dCA,Eleni S.,"Keene, NH",2 star rating,"I really wanted to like this place but everything we had was lackluster and inauthentic. We had the pikilia plate and a large order of calamari. The calamari was very salty and a bit rubbery. The feta and olives were so salty that it's obvious they skip the step of soaking them in water to take some of the saltiness away (what most Greeks traditionally do). The salmon on the pikilia plate was not fresh. The spanakopita was just okay. The tzatziki was okay and the taramosalata was very paste-like. The prices were good but the food wasn't. We found out after that this place is a chain so if you want half way authentic Greek food, avoid this place. Our waiter was nice and our water was constantly refilled but that was the only good thing about the place."
/user_details?userid=or9G0n4aNy19GndsPRMb9A,Karen M.,"Columbia, MO",4 star rating,The food was delivered and looked exactly like the menu. Very tasty large servings heavenly shrimp and potato. You go across the walkway to the liquor store to buy wine or beer with no corkage at the restaurant. They provide wine glasses. Great service!
/user_details?userid=WLvSjxof9ZmnzotJo3SjdA,Jane Z.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great food, and amazing service! We had catering from Casa Grecque for an event, and the food was exceptional and was very well received.  We tried the souvlaki, which was very tasty and comes with a large portion of rice and potatoes. Definitely check it out if you're in the Plateau area!"
/user_details?userid=Y7R9JgVcyI6k3OAQDmN8_g,Karen K.,"Kensington-Cedar Cottage, Vancouver, Canada",2 star rating,"We were looking to grab dinner and one of my guests remembered this place favorably from her youth. We ordered there 11$ special. 1 chicken brochette, 1 cheese cannelloni  and 1 calamari dinner. Brochette was ok but a bit tasteless, cheese cannelloni was meh and the calamari was passable. The rice was awful. Can't recommend it."
/user_details?userid=cqagyVkvbBB32agnJsIhVA,Ephraim D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"It's a chain BYOB Greek restaurant. Is it authentic? It's as authentically Greek as Yoplait Greek Yogurt. It's okay if you are in the neighbourhood and your friends think that Greek food is exotic. And seriously folks, why is there Italian food on the menu?"
/user_details?userid=SVqYLQGYUUIi7ysYazgFHg,Blue H.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"This was by far the worst Greek restaurant I've ever been too. To begin with, our server was rude, patronizing, and lazy. He didn't bring us anything to drink until we flagged him down and asked him for water. Then after we ordered our meal, Calamari, Steak and Chicken with a coffee, it didn't come! I waited an hour and a half for a damn coffee and my meal. You may think I should have simply flagged the man down again? I would have if that pretty boy with the greasy goatee had even showed up to see his tables, but nooooo, that would have been doing his job. Eventually I gave up on that moron and got the other servers attention. He brought our food, my coffee, and  it only took him 1 minute. Which tells you right there that the food had been under a heat lamp for awhile and our previous server was as I mentioned before, a bloody moron. The food was mediocre at best and I have no idea what the hell they did to the Calamari. Last time I checked it should be battered. It looked, smelled, and tasted like chunks of rubber.  So finally, two hours later. After dealing with this unpleasant individual. He has to gall to ask me how much I want to tip, 10, 15 or 20 percent. I took the damn machine from him and tipped him what he deserved........$1.50. NEVER AGAIN!!"
/user_details?userid=xk3bf_fvItYgRJ2lvOKZEw,Reza N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,very comfortable and warming setting.. The food is good and very big portions so that you can have leftovers the next day for your lunch... I recommand the shrimps
