You are always greeted with a smile and they ALWAYS have the best music playing... how can one not be tempted to groove while awaiting their meal/ and or latte.Not only is the service great, Brotelli make delicious pastas...I have yet to try all options on their menu, but I recommend the Al tonno ( farfale pasta with tuna) pastas are freshly made!Their coffees, Lattes, cappuccinos and other hot beverages are made with coffee beans imported directly from Rome in Italy. They also use Oat milk which gives that extra ouuumph to the hot beverage.They are opened Monday to Friday during regular business hours.Walking distance from either Peel (green line) or Bonaventure (orange line) metros.As the cold months approaches us, if ever you are in the downtown area- be sure to stop by Brotellis and indulge in their coffee alwhile enjoying some great music!"

Finding Brotelli's was a bit of a challenge since I'm not familiar with the area. It's located downstairs in the food court inside the CIBC building. There were a variety of dishes, all reasonably priced. I ordered the basilico ($12), which consisted of pesto sauce, pine nuts and topped with a heap of arugula. I added chili flakes since I love a good kick! I really wish there were more places like this. If I'm ever in Montreal, I am definitely coming back!Service: 4/5Presentation: 4/5Taste: 4/5Price: 4/5Ambiance: 4/5Overall: 4/5"

So was very excited to try as it's down the street from my work. Let me tell you, we tried two pastas and they were delicious. Noddles a little too el Dante for my liking but delicious none the less.I had the carbonara and my boyfriend had a red sauce pasta that had black olives and basil leafs in it. So good!Friendly staff, who seem like they like their jobs, great energy over all. Latte was great as well."

I need to try all their flavors.The owners are two young and friendly brothers that have changed lunchtime for me for the better.Their pastas are served in small, chinese-like, to-go containers and are easy to carry that includes a generous portion. The service is always friendly and quick and the prices are reasonable.If you have not yet been here, you are missing out. For real!"

We ordered spaghetti with tomato, parm , basil and garlic.  The cook on the pasta was great and the sauce tasted so fresh and vibrant, full of flavour even in such a simple set of ingredients. everyone loved it ! Very affordable prices , and great portion size per each box of pasta. I cant wait to stop in to the location and give more of their pastas a try !"

/user_details?userid=2hGtsrH0NpIhMWJjk60u8w,Douglas J.,"Dallas, TX",4 star rating,Kind of hard to find.  It's in a basement food court for a office building.  But worth the effort.  My wife and I had the carbonara.  Perfect al dente pasta.
