My favorites were the papaya and mango salads, the beef larb and the nem kao. The prices were very reasonable too. My only complaint is that they don't accept debit or credit. They only take cash. I would come here a lot more often if they started accepting cards."

The food was different from what I usually eat. Usually, when I go to a Thai restaurant, I'd order curry or pad thai etc. But here, they have some specialty that I've never seen in other restaurants!"
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This restaurant has been on my husband's list forever and sadly it did not live up to the expectations. Upon entering the restaurant, I was hit with an unpleasant smell that I can't pinpoint what it is. The molding on the walls (and the walls) needs some cleaning. Let's just say that a fresh coat of paint wouldn't hurt.Unlike some reviews, it's not ""cheap eats"". Our three very small sausages were 12.95$! Along with the sausages, we had the tom yum soup, a beef salad, a whole fried fish and two small portions of sticky rice. To my surprise, the rice was 4$ a portion. Way overpriced! The beef in the beef salad was very dry and the whole dish itself was unimpressive. The rest of the food was ok nothing more. I had much better elsewhere. Then why three stars? Perhaps 3 1/2 stars. Service. The only waitress for the evening was very nice and the food came out at a good pace. I would of given this place 2 stars if it was solely for the food."

On our first couple of visits, years ago, we were delighted to find authentic Thai, ample portions and good prices. It's clear that standards have changed and practices here now border on criminal. Our family was quickly seated, we placed our order and it arrived reasonably quickly. Except that most was barely edible. We had satay, pad see yew and two other dishes, all items were very familiar with. After two bites, it was clear the owners here have made significant changes. We were used to fresh ingredients, rich sauces and fragrant dishes. What we got seemed like it was from frozen. Everything was dry, bland or sweetened with white sugar. One dish was sent back outright, as being entirely inedible.Here's where it gets strange. When the bill arrived, she insisted on charging for food we couldn't eat. We got a series of excuses. Then we were told it was ""cash only"". No cards whatsoever are accepted - even though the machinery was clearly present on the counter. We had to walk to an ATM to pay for the meal and food we couldn't eat. When I re-confirmed she was charging us for dishes that were sent back, she shrugged and rang it up.We feel robbed. We will not be back.What used to be a small, hidden gem has clearly deteriorated into a shameful cash-grab, one that doesn't care about customers. Be very cautious of any business that insists on charging you for food a dog wouldn't eat and one that only accepts cash. Thai Sep won't last much longer."
/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,cash only!Went there for lunch and in general food was good. I especially enjoyed the Tom Ka (coconut soup).Service is decent although quite slow...the food doesn't come out quickly either as they only have one person working in the kitchen.I would say don't go there when you are starving!

/user_details?userid=gccZ7XmDEe6w2zk5T9cdIQ,Bihui J.,"Burnaby, Canada",5 star rating,"I absolutely loved the experience in this place, delicious food and good service. After reading some reviews online, I was afraid it would be really slow to get the food since we were quite hungry .  But it was reasonable amount of waiting time.  First, the Tom yam soup was right on point, I give it 8,  a small start up soup with two shrimps and some mash room and tomato,  then we had the sausage, I lovedddddd it, the lemongrass taste is very nice, however my husband said he is expecting  something different.  Then we moved on to the beef salad, oh my goddess. It was the best beef salad I had ,  the sweet shallots , the crutch peanut and rice crispy give such a nice texture, service with fresh fresh greens and latus.  You must try this if you haven't.  Then for a long time, I want to try the green curry, it was all worth the waiting, it was with chick I ordered. Sweet and creamy. I really enjoyed. They also have the dessert. Mango with sticky rice which I adored the texture and my husband had the fried banana with ice cream. The banana wasfried with coconut chips.    Then next time I want to try their fish. It looked so amazing from the table next to us.  And I also want to try their noodle soup."

Seriously avoid this place, unless you want this to happen to you as well. It's also more expensive than your average thai place, and the ingredients are sub par."
