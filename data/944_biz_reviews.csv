We had people from Malaysia, India, Australia, Hawaii, and Massachusetts in our group. We all agreed of all the delicious food we ate all week, this was by far everyone's favorite meal. We had a lot of food. The Saganaki, Shrimp Youvesti, and Greek Spreads to start. We then all had either a Greek salad or the yummy lentil soup.For entrees, the Mousakka and Poulet were our favorites. Of course we had Loukamades for dessert. Everything was delicious. I've had a lot of Greek food in my life, but this was by far the best of all. I highly recommend trying this restaurant! The service was great as well. The restaurant decor makes you feel you're in Greece. Well done!"

My husband and I were on the island of Rhodes exactly 1yr ago and this is the first time since then that we felt as if we were back on the island. We live in NYC and this family owned restaurant beats out anything we've been to in NY. Be sure to order the grilled octopus, it's delicious. This is a must when you are in Montreal. We will be back!"

The husband and wife duo who run the restaurant are delightful - the lady running the front like clockwork, treating all the customers like guests in her own home with care and patience, and the husband in the kitchen grilling, chopping, preparing delicious plates of beautiful food. The space is very 'greek' - feels like a family restaurant in the Greek islands, and the ambience is warm and friendly.  The meal was tasty - satisfying, healthy, good quality meats and seafood. A family style greek salad with fresh veggies and olive oil was only $17, and fed 4 people as an entre/side.  I am a vegetarian and was well taken care of, and my family had fish and lamb dishes.  Can't say enough good things about this lovely restaurant except that we hope to return soon!"
