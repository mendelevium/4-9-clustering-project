There was only one man working and he graciously welcomed me and my friends. He cooked our food promptly and everything was delicious. It was my first time trying chimichangas and now I can tell everyone I'm a big fan of chimichangas. It's basically an extreme burrito. Deep fried tortilla with a protein of your choice, mixed with the perfect blend of spices, peppers and cheese... so good. Looking forward to trying the paella and flautas next time. Don't be fooled by the low key setup, the food and service are definitely worth the visit!"

/user_details?userid=LqywrHdM-H8gSdKtGrhBuw,Andre J.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",2 star rating,"Had high expectations for this authentic Mexican/Salvadorian spot and was left disappointed.Service was slow, smell of cigarette from clients smoking outside (ventilation of the place needs an update). The food was mediocre at best, the sopa de tortilla was ok, pupusas not so much, the only thing I enjoyed was the tuja.Overall there are better places around"

/user_details?userid=ZT1pysBKkRW9tIsJMXQLhg,M R.,"Villeray—Saint-Michel—Parc-Extension, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"So let's get food quality out of the way ...it's pretty good.The place though is just gross. The utensils look old. I never ever noticed it elsewhere, but here it was really apparent. Then it gets worse.  My friend asked for a Diet Pepsi and the waiter/cook returned with a can that white stick and fizzy gunk all around the rims. We checked underneath to see the expiration date and it was over 2 years past the date (October 17, 2016).  He asked for a different can, but what he received was the same can but with the gunk wiped off. We know because we took a look again. I don't plan on ever coming back unless they get a serious makeover and an actual cleaning routine.It's a shame because the food is actually pretty good when taking price into consideration.Oh and avoid the washrooms too."

/user_details?userid=fzCFYwjrTyvCKoecPuq3Bg,Shauna F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of the best burrito plates I have ever eaten! The portions are enormous, the vegetables fresh and filling. The prices are reasonable for the portion size. I had to take my second burrito home for dinner."
/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"OMG, I love this place.  I've been here over a dozen times and have never had a bad meal.  The pupusas are the absolute best (range from $2.10 - $2.50 each).  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and they come piping hot.  You can hear them slapping the dough in the kitchen when you order them - so you know they are made fresh to order.  My favourite are the chicken and cheese ones.  I have to admit that I usually just gorge on pupusas but I have ordered other things here as well:Chicken Tamales - $2.30: Good, but nothing remarkable (I'd rather have the pupusas).  Campo Combination Plate (chicken taco, chicken enchilada, rice, beans and salad) - $12.50: Very tasty with lots of chicken.  The salad is iceberg/romaine though, not real mixed greens.  Calamari - $7.75: Tender calamari rings fried to perfection.  Not rubbery or chewy at all.  One of the best places for calamari.     Seafood Paella - $18.25: Lots of seafood: calamari rings, shrimp, fish and mussels.  Calamari rings were so tender, shrimp were large and tasty, fish tasted fresh and didn't smell fishy, mussels were a good size and delicious.  The only slightly negative thing was that the rice was a little on the dry side, but it still tasted really good.This place is on a little side street in Little Italy and looks like nothing much from the outside.  It's a mom and pop joint with tasty authentic food.  Most of the customers are Spanish-speaking and many people come for takeout.  Prices are good and portions are generous.  Service is polite and competent.  If you love pupusas and are in Montreal you have to check this place out!"
/user_details?userid=nB1k_D08ybNk_CS-a3fAyw,Chris C.,"Gardena, CA",4 star rating,"The food here is authentic South American fare and everything we've had here was very good. The decor is frightful but don't go for the ambience, the food is the prize here.Easily the best south American food in Montréal, but only 4 stars because the carne asada has been tough."
/user_details?userid=vnleJhOXxvp7b6YEMiVzrA,Chris G.,"Hamilton, Canada",4 star rating,"Really good Mexican/Salvadorian food.  Simple decor, with funny Spanish TV playing.  HUGE portions, cheap prices, friendly staff.  Pupusas are off the HOOK!  I can also attest to the enchiladas, and burritos.  Also, no fee for BYO wine.  :)Docked it one star for a less-than-great vegetarian selection, and they use some kind of Chinese veggie mix (I had water chestnuts and baby corn in my enchilada -- not exactly traditional, though still tasty)."
/user_details?userid=i-rfAdH3NLw9fzLlkc1P8w,Jay K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,There are only a couple things here that seem to be worth trying. The yucca con chicharon although the pork is slightly on the dry side but I havent had this dish anywhere where the pork wasnt. The pupasas are very good too and so is the plantain. Those are the only 3 dishes that I ever get here and they do them better than the other Salvadorian restaurants Ive been to in the city. The other dishes dont seem as interesting and arent that cheap either. Dont be scared by the terrible decor and by the fact that its always empty. If you enjoy those classic Salvadorian dishes its worth a try.

The food is very fresh and comes in generous portions, the staff is friendly and really wants to make you satisfied. It was my first time trying Salvadorian food and certainly not the last time!!! Try it!!! :)"
/user_details?userid=YP5hNfCZruMdByn6Ah6XpQ,Ari S.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Fantastic little Salvadorean/Mexican joint in Little Italy.  A hole-in-the-wall family establishment that is usually filled with large Latino groups and Mexican soap operas blaring from a large screen television. Portions are ridiculously large and cheap (the centro americano costs around $14 and is a steak that comes with rice, black beans, plantains, tortilla, etc,etc). It's bring your own wine and.or beer as well so you can't lose. The pupusas - El Salvadorean specialty, a savoury filled pancake - are also delicious."
/user_details?userid=LHlKkrkppF-HIV3MOqAKcQ,Margaret M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love this place. The bean pupusas are $2.10 and come with unlimited curtido and tomato sauce. Two are more than enough for me for dinner. The guacamole & chips are a bit pricier ($6) but are delicious and a good size to split between two people. While other pupserias in the area might have nicer decor, this place stands out for being the cheapest I've seen (without sacrificing quality) and for being BYOB. It's the best!"
