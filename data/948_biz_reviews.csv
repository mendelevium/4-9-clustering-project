The poke bowls were ready within 5 minutes of us calling - now that's speedy service! We literally called, parked, and bam we had food in our hands. We ordered a salmon and a tuna poke to get some variety. If you aren't a fan of raw fish, they have unagi, shrimp, and chicken as well. For a little bit extra cost you can choose two proteins. The base salad and rice and sauce that comes with each bowl is the same, so there's less choice than those customized poke bowl places. There are also a few other options, including spicy seaweed salad, banh mis, among others.The service was so great, the owners were fantastically nice. The total cost was about 36 with tax, and after paying with 40 they actually gave us back 5, and told us to keep the change?? Wow, this has been the first time a restaurant has tipped me...They were also very apologetic and told us that prices would probably increase soon, since their costs have been rising (no surprise there), though that is obviously totally understandeable. Very nice people.The food was very good. Dressing was sweet, tangy, and salty,  and was just the right amount. The toppings included apple, mango, seaweed salad, edamame, greens, carrot, cucumber, avocado, half a boiled marinated egg, and the fish of choice, dressed in sesame seeds. Wow! What a variety. Everything was fresh and crisp and good quality. The rice below was proper sushi rice and still nicely warm. I tried both the tuna and salmon and honestly I loved both of them. Fish was fresh and properly marinated.You should definitely check this place out!"

Turns out, they had a paper menu next to the cash register. Our mistake! The prices for the sushi/rolls come down to a bit over 1$ per piece. I had a Banh mi, which was 6$. It was quite large and very filling. They were very generous with the sauce, so the bread was nice and flavourful, but it was unevenly spread, so some bites were drenched and way too salty, whereas others were plain bread. The service was great though, the waiter was friendly and smiled a lot! He seemed to really enjoy what he does. I think if you're around and need a quick bite for not a lot of $$$, you should definitely stop by, but I don't think it's worth it to make a trip over to cdn just for that."

Was in a rush and the owner really delivered quick and efficient service. I ordered the mixed tuna and salmon poke bowl. Super delicious. There was half an egg, apple slices, kimchi, wasabi peas, mango, seaweeds, salad, carrots, delicious dressing. A god portion of tuna and salmon cubes. A great bowl for 16$.  The owner is super friendly and so nice. I would definitely come back. I was in and out in 10 minutes. Not mixed is actually 13$ which is A steal. They also have a great selection of sushi and this is what I'll try next time I come."

/user_details?userid=oRmiws9fb1nENaRlekrzaQ,Xiaoxi Z.,"Minneapolis, MN",5 star rating,This restaurant was A-MAZING! We were exploring St. Joseph's Oratory and stopped in before heading back to Mont Royal. We ordered sushi and the unagi poke bowl. Ingredients were fresh and tasted extraordinary -- all at very reasonable prices! To top it all off was a delectable home-made sauce for the sushi. Would love to come back again!!

/user_details?userid=C0yPpV_TFDrc3OSf0h2NuQ,M S.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"No taste at all. They put some super spicy sauce that I thought was soy and it killed my existing ulcer of pain. Plate looks nothing like the menu, Mango bay has almost no mango! just a tiny extremely thin bit and an extremely thin bit of Salmon, no wasabi no ginger like other such places. Will not go back"
