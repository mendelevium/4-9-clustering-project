H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"How is it that I am the first Yelper here?  My kids always called it Sam's place so I'm just going to make it official and give them a Yelp page.  I tried to look them up for a number, but instead had to walk there myself.  Doesn't really matter because their kitchen is lighting fast, no joke!  Yes, it's a hole in the wall and you have limited options but what they do, they do well. It's a fantastic and cheap take-out option. Sam is so so nice!  My kids ask to go there every week for their wonton soup and General Tao chicken which has also become one of my favorites.  I will have to make it a point to try other things. They have lunch sandwich specials which is kinda odd for a Chinese restaurant but perhaps they cater to the students at nearby universities?  I don't know but I'm happy they are around. Now all the people I've told in the elevator of my building when they tell me how great our take-out bag smells will know what I'm talking about!"
