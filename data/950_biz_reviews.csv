/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The wife and I wanted to try out some Portuguese cuisine and with a little help with my solid collection of Yelp bookmarks I found this well liked location, in the heart of lovely Old St. Rose... one of the few genuine Portuguese restos in Laval!The ambiance is pretty dim with warm colors that set a nice mood for those of you who enjoy that intimate or romantic setting. We were promptly seated in the back, warm and far away from the cold winter harshness and isolated well enough so our conversation was kept private.After some contemplation we went with the 'Prato de Carnes' (meat platter!) which consisted of chicken, portuguese sausages and pork. While we waited we were provided with a huge warm bread bun which we promptly ravaged. After 15 minutes or so, our meal was served in a huge plate filled with delicious looking meats and a side plate with french fries with homemade mayo.Let me just state that the chicken was out of this world good, so much so it completely surpassed everything else. The moistness.... THE MOISTNESS PEOPLE!... and the taste... BY GAWD the TASTE!!!! I must go back just for this!The sausages, they were good... but completely forgettable after tasting that chicken... the pork? an afterthought!!The chicken folks... the chicken!!!! Why are you still reading this?The side fries were good as well... and the home mayo were delicious... they should provide it in a bigger bowl though. :)For dessert, we went with Portuguese tarts... they were pretty tasty.The price-tag is about average and worth it.The service was decent as well.All in all, somewhere I'd def go back."
/user_details?userid=utaO5DspJm3v-lHvrXnsvw,Karen C.,"Laval, Canada",4 star rating,I live in the area and have eaten there once and take out three times. The food is good but not fabulous.  The chicken was flavorful and juicy but did not care for the fries as tasted like cooked and reheated a few times.  I prefer takeout as I find the decor dark and dingy/dirty looking. The waiter and cook are efficient and friendly.
/user_details?userid=kU7Cj94PkJnCJuu-5Cve9w,Al L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,Thanks to Yelp found this great family owned  restaurant in an old town feel. First time eating in a Portuguese restaurant and enjoyed every bite.  Food was well presented and fresh ingredients made for a delicious meal. Owner took orders and served our table. When in the Laval area put this eatery on your list.
/user_details?userid=aIqDek9d1fDEgLIAWXMGSA,Robert L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5 star rating,Thx to yelp I found this little gem of a place as we normally we go into Montreal for Portuguese food. I originally ordered Rabbit but they were sold out so I went for the half chicken which was excellent.Service was great and postion good size. Also very close to our office so I will be back.

/user_details?userid=5HiO4RFBVtAc7EY6w2mmRg,Vanessa V.,"Côte Saint-Luc, Canada",1 star rating,I was never disappointed by a portugal restaurant before.. i was in the laval area and thought about having portuguese food. My dad had the soup that wasnt tasty at all and lacked flavor. The chicken was so greasy and the sauce for the fries was almost plain mayonnaise. I asked for ketchup and they brought an old looking bottle and the ketchup was brown. They may have noticed my reaction and immediately brought a new bottle and took the other one.. just go elsewhere!

/user_details?userid=bFquREKMHZiqguAeBoSRFA,Habib T.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"What a Taste !!! One of the best grilled chicken i ever had. Ordered the spicy Portuguese whole chicken. We enjoyed it till the last bite. Very well cooked, full of flavour .  I cannot comment a lot on the restaurant as i ordered to go. A small place with simple decor, i was well welcomed and order was fast and professional. I would definitely recommend it bases on the food and will definitely dine in next time. 5 star for the freshness, flavour and taste."
/user_details?userid=82vSXGC55BOPssPCs5ea4w,Chantal R.,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",5 star rating,"This place confirmed what I already knew: In order to find good Portuguese food you have to travel away from the big city.In the Vancouver (B.C.) region we had to go to Maple Ridge for Sagres and now while living in Montreal we seem to have to travel to Laval for this place.Super affordable, amazing octopus, lovely people and the promise of Carne Alentejana next time we visit.Not to mention a great wine selection and the most amazing dessert EVER: Heavenly Cream. No seriously, you have to try it.So in love with this little gem."
/user_details?userid=RmMUQHxlr1mOcL0BM6ORwg,Nicolas A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious, big portions, and quality service. Honestly one of the best chicken I have tasted. I got the chicken sandwich with fries and a half litre of house wine. The house white wine was surprisingly good! And the chicken sandwich with spice was fantastic! Highly recommend, I'll be back."
/user_details?userid=yK3o4s_UR7qB2UHmcjKUzg,Virginia J.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,I gave this resto a 5 star rating because the service was good and the food is delicious I've eaten Brazilian food but not Portuguese food. I like that the meat is grilled with so much flavour. I plan on going back in the near future it was yummy. The waitress advised us to take the strawberry daiquiri which was good I liked my overall experience :)..
/user_details?userid=dOPuHwbAznos6ewTeg36Yg,Douglas P.,"Midlothian, VA",5 star rating,"Ordered 1/4 chicken-leg, and after a few bites, I requested 1/4 more. Delicious! House white went very well. Requested a cake to-go with 1/2 chocolate and 1/2 flan. Now I wish I had two. Highly recommended."
/user_details?userid=lbNN_t71fnNPQsIP03Q6bg,Mark S.,"Laval, Canada",4 star rating,"Small and quaint, as most Portuguese restaurants are. But this one actually delivers the experience as well. The staff was friendly, the food was spot on. Everything from the cod croquettes appetizers to the chicken was great, including grilled calamari and grilled cod with chickpeas. And all at a fair price. Too bad it's to far from home for takeout."
/user_details?userid=XAPeOzligKMhhaBswZ9xNw,George L.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"First time I've been here didn't know what to expect; I was pleasantly surprised, the service was impeccable, and food was to die for. For anyone wanting to have an orgasmic tasting I highly recommend this place.  Great presentation and the flavors reminded me of Portugal. Try the agwardent, it is amazing! I will be back!"

/user_details?userid=Yjse3CT7Bgne4KujXZmE-g,Sabrina V.,"Laval, Canada",3 star rating,"Very disappointed after going based on all the great reviews. In the half chicken plate the chicken was dry af and not very tasteful, I switched my fries for rice which was also disappointing, tasteless and plain. However my mom highly enjoyed her mussels & they did have a nice selection of wine. But the trip to Montreal is definitely worth it compared to this place. #sorrynotsorry"
/user_details?userid=n7iVC8Frz_-3P4WL8m6HmA,Bill M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I would give it a 5 if they kept the water glass full and refilled the bread and olives. The appetizers were a 3 but the food....that was a 5! I had the rabbit. It was super fantastic. But, they need to improve table service and their appetizers....but other than that, I still will go 'again' but not 'again and again'."
