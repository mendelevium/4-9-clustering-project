/user_details?userid=j0ltvDiwtLLqDwZAIvtN5g,Jeffrey T.,"East Lansing, MI",4 star rating,Great crepe place for lunch or a snack! It was very quiet when we went there. The owners and servers were very nice and helpful. The crepes were fantastic. They knew that we were coming for out out town and helped us with deciding which crepe to get. They had many choices.I got a brie and apple crepe. It was deliciously cheesey. The brie and apples were wrapped in a buckwheat crepe. It was very filling. I wished I had ordered another crepe. They offer sweet and savory crepes. I would come back again for more crepes.

/user_details?userid=DHxV66FZAgginez9AvPKZw,Alina N.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,This is a small charming cafe with great service and a very interesting galette menu.   It felt very authentic and had a really nice cozy decor.   What we liked the most were the flavour combinations in the galettes -- the ingredients were more original than in other places we'd gone to and went very well together.   My favourite was the Mediterranean galette which had a perfect flavour profile for me.  An important thing to mention is that they only take cash or interac.

/user_details?userid=F1CxK5sx7Wp1Zi3qgPjHUQ,Kimberley M.,"Kingston, Canada",5 star rating,"Being in Montreal just calls for crepes. I am gluten-free and thanks to yelp, I found le creperie based on other reviews. We were not disappointed at all; the experience was fantastic! The shop is small and doesn't seat more than 20 at a time. We arrived and were able to sit right away, but even if there was a wait, it's worth it. The menu offers sweet and savoury and there seems to be a daily special as well. I opted for the smoked salmon buckwheat crepe and altered the cheese to chèvre. Oh my! The crepe was perfect and the filling features a strong dill seasoning. It was fantastic! If I lived in the neighbourhood I'd be an instant regular. I'll be visiting again on my next trip to Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=9lHag_YTVKOa-4QE-pIgpQ,Zee K.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"I found this place after looking through reviews on other sites for gluten-free  food in Montreal. When I googled ""Une Crêpe"", I got this location. We drove around for a while looking for it because the sign now says ""La Crêpiere"". Not sure if this means they are no longer affiliated with the other location of ""Une Crêpe"", which I have never been to. I eat a gluten-free diet, and my friend that I was having breakfast with is violently Celiac-ridden. To the point that he is very, very afraid to try new foods. The women working here were incredibly helpful, and due to our mild language barrier, they at first thought he couldn't have lactose or gluten, and the chef offered to make him his very own crêpe batter (!).As it turns out, the sarrasin (buckwheat) crêpes (galettes) are completely gluten free - my friend had a modified version of the special (chicken, pesto, some other things) and I had the eggplant, sundried tomato and cheese.  Both were very tasty. I was hoping to have room for dessert but I was too full, and I was advised that the specific crepe I was wanting would not travel well (almond paste, pear and dark chocolate).    Will definitely be back, as much for the food,  as for the very pleasant and accommodating service.  There is obvious love put into the food, which is rare and delicious. Our total for two very filling crepes, after tax but before tip was only $18."

The owner makes the Crepes both savory and sweet and have buckwheat batter for the people with Gluten Allergies. All around great experience both times we went.

/user_details?userid=mT8t8hA_ElPvHgQq2pQ4oQ,Rose L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Kind of expensive for what you got. I was still hungry. I think i give up on crepes in Montreal. It was tasty, but not much food. Mostly crepe, not much cheese or filling. The service was kind of slow, but friendly, although there was limited English. Their brunch special seemed to be good value but it wasnt in the menu and wasn't suggested (even though members of our party were speaking French with the waitress) so we  didn't notice until after we ate. The interior was cute though, good if want a relaxing snack."
/user_details?userid=hP7mKqLv57veQKiFWvA0Dw,Michael T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"***TIP The ""mixte"" crêpes of half normal and half buckwheat flour were the best. And make sure to check the chalkboard on the wall. The Alsacien is awesome.*** I am thrilled that this place is right around the corner from my house. Especially since it is -15°C right now. The service is genuinely friendly and excellent. The place is warm and inviting. The food is delicious. Portions are generous. And the prices are incredibly reasonable with most things below $8 and nothing over $10. No wine or beer (sadly). Coffee is passable, but don't expect a barista.Rating Scale:1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."
/user_details?userid=DJFMq2govDVITUFHHQ3zqQ,Rad A.,"Houston, TX",1 star rating,Might be a good place. Who knows. It was closed during hours posted that is would be open. Had been planning on going for days during a trip to Montreal. Finally made our way over in the cold. Go to a more reliable place so as not to waste your vacation time.

/user_details?userid=_Ec9HMULY6am7ge_gnnvZw,Dean N.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,Got the L'Alsacienne with buckwheat. Delightfully crisp and rich. Perfect for the cold weather. Finished with a classic lemon and sugar crepe. Also got a giant 'bol' of cafe au lait.

/user_details?userid=wEZu-Hh3D_dmbIY0JZoNNA,Jubin T.,"Floral Park, NY",5 star rating,Definitely worth  it!! Yummy crepes and loved the coffee. The owner is a very friendly man too. Would have surely gone back the next day if it wasn't closed on Sunday
/user_details?userid=yIerqOdYAu3OPIYKUO9x9Q,Tania J.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,The service is very friendly and the crepes are delicious. The chef is very creative and she always has gourmet options. This is one of my favourite places for a nice brunch over the weekend.
/user_details?userid=vvEtLCJFZZFyyeKaWYjJlQ,William M.,"Greenwich, CT",4 star rating,"Really delicious crepes in a more 'authentic', non-touristy atmosphere especially given the neighborhood (the place appeared to be run by a couple).  My ham. cheese and spinach crepe was very good (and more of a thin layer of cheese which is how I requested it).  Cappuccino and hot chocolate were also very good (hot chocolate served ""European style' with minimal sweetness; you can add more sugar if you like)."
