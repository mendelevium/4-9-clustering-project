I found a piece of plastic in my soup.It didn't even put chop suy in it.Asked for extra large this time, they wanted to charge 14 dollars for it."

I went with their chicken bahn mi and it was alright. My only complaint was the pricing being higher than it needed to be and the sandwich missing some sauce. It was a little dry.It's perfectly suited for a quick lunch for take-out as the sandwiches are prepped ahead of time so you just go in, tell them what you want and you pay. In and out within 3 minutes."

So far, I've been there at least 3 times and I'm always happy with my order. I usually order the shrimp/beef/chicken Â plate. It's a decent size. This time I got a salad with grilled chicken. It was tender. Really enjoyed it. I wished they would take care of the place a bit more. I feel like the esthetics are not their priority and it would attract more people."

The staff is super nice and the food is fresh and affordable ! The aesthetics of the place weren't the best but still you could see that it was clean and definetly more of to go spot.The pho wasn't my favourite but did a better job then vie&nam or Thai express Loved their #15 wich was grilled chicken with vermicelli salad and a egg roll all for less then 12$
/user_details?userid=bxaICaGxzYHSB1MsztlGdg,Matylda K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Omg, this place is the bomb. If you're working near PVM and like Vietnamese food, you got yourself a new restaurant to go during lunch time! They do Viet subs and all kinds of soups to which I got addicted. They have 3-4 different vegetarian soups, all with a wonderful broth that do not taste chemical (my favourite is the spicy curry - note for meat eaters: they have a wide variety of meat soups as well!). Soups are around 10$, Viet sub around 5$. The restaurant has a few seats but is mainly there to take the food to go. The people running the place are always smiling and kind. As long as they'll make these flavourful soups, you'll continue to see me!"

Of course, their pho is not comparable to the one in Chinatown but would satisfy your craving. I would particularly recommend the Bun Bo Hue which is my favourite dish there. They also have desserts and side dishes. Spring rolls are very authentic (they add taro in it !) - must try."
