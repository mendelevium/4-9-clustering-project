The customer service was great. The waiter came to check up on us a few times. Super friendly!Can't wait to go back!
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,They have been around for a long time so I was expecting way better than what I got but still wasn't bad. A bit bland but I mean maybe they were having an off day ?
/user_details?userid=urvMX2_55JzYIIZXXLoOgg,Michael B.,"North Hollywood, Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Absolutely best and most authentic Mexican I have had since moving to MTL. We had the enchiladas and chips + salsa, absolutely would recommend. Beautiful presentation etc. awesome place."
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",2 star rating,"Mo wanted to try something new and found this Mexican California style place located in Pointe St. Charles. Can't say I've ever been out to this 'hood for food before so this was a first for me. We came on a Wednesday evening for dinner. Plenty of room to sit and they have some cool artwork up on the walls. - Margarita ($7.95) - oddly, this isn't listed on either menu but our waitress verbally told us their available drinks. Mo kept on adding salt into her margarita...- Guacamole ($7.25) - they brought out chips and salsa (I believe that's complimentary). We wanted to try their guac, which was the best thing we ordered, but incredibly overpriced. A tiny bowl for $7.25?  Brutal. The chips were also really, really salty. - Sopa de pollo ($3.95 appetizer) - broth was weak and lacked depth in flavour. - Enchilada ($13.95) - chicken enchilada with green tomatillo sauce, melted cheese, rice, black beans and salad. Oddly, this was listed as $12.50 on their chalkboard menu. Again, dish was way too salty. Chicken was dry and the amount of rice/beans you get is laughable. Salad was unmemorable. The only tasty thing were the beets. We wanted to like this place but honestly, it was a disappointment. Probably the worst meal during my three week trip."
/user_details?userid=c7C5QziJbx6JOnQFiOxUXQ,Youri H.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I just ate a beef burrito and now I have to roll myself home. If I make it, I'll likely be back to Café Cantina. If not, well, it was a great last meal. Either way, if you eat here, you should probably bring a wheelbarrow to roll home in. Can't speak to much because the burrito was all I ate, but judging by the contents of said burrito and by the plates that passed me by, this place doesn't mess around."
/user_details?userid=6elNm2xn9f3KS08bcK-cBw,Carrie-Ann K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Stellar service, spicy salsa, super yummy margaritas (not too sweet! #winning) - I have no complaints about this low key amazing Mexican joint. We had a steak burrito that was, true to our server's promise, the best I've had in this city. It was enormous, had tons of guac, and came with an understated simple slaw that was secretly awesome. We also got the carnitas tacos, which were fantastic. The plate comes with two filled tacos plus two extra tortillas, plus rice, beans, and salad... So you can make even more tacos with all the goodness that falls out of your taco. I will be back so often they will be like, CA, we're sick of you, stop coming here. Love it love it love it!"
/user_details?userid=4LUG6dffnqgGxE6HxJ0wOw,Tammy M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"That was fun. Unexpected. It started with a big dry Irish stout _ La Sang d'encre, from a Quebec microbrewery, to be precise, toward the end of a long workday.  Was starting to swerve while sewing, so called 'er quits for the evening, and the next thing I knew I was on my bike in Point Saint Charles with a spirited fella from Peru called Carlos, who showed me a Patricia Piccinini creature creation on his smart phone calling it a Pokemon. (...=D run on sentences Ms Crenshaw, my last literary teacher, in high school, might find cringeworthy.)Kinda surreal. I set him straight. He didnt care. The two fellas running this place were a real pleasure. Great vibes. The ambiance is perfect. Interesting and skillfully painted murals on the rear walls where I sat and where Carlos rejoined me -now wearing his beautiful Corazon Peruvian soccer jersey, and gold- to chat more in Spanish, and flirt. I had one of the special du jours: enchilada mole. I'd only had homemade mole with tamales during youthful adventures in the Sonora Desert...way before most of you yelpsters were born =D I'd wager. So not a lot to base upon. This Montreal mole was a little sweeter and thinner, but was a great accompaniment to the chicken enchiladas, beans, rice and a very sophisticated salad.  The meal was clean, excellent. Fair portion.  I really could have eaten a bit more though. Under $20 with gratuity. Pretty authentic Mexi- Cali fare from a couple of Quebecers! Thanx gentlemen!  I can see myself swinging in to eat here again.Thanx Carlos for directing me to Cafe Cantina!, (Carlos, I learn is a cook at a Peruvian eatery in Verdun, -will check that out next time at Lachine) Sound intel always welcomed."

Attention San Diego burrito shop owners, Cafe Cantina has landed in and offers a familiar flavor so hard to find in Montreal ... Quesadillas are prepared with just the right amount of cheese and crisp to it. Guacamole is smooth and fresh. Seasoned Sweet Potato Tacos are devilishly yummy. Burritos come in one size - giiiaaaaant. All in all everything is made fresh to order so you won't be disappointed.My favorite lunch pick is the Spicy Burrito Carnitas with the perfect balance of rice, beans, meat, salad, tomatoes, guacamole and creamy sauce - delicious!Owners Serge and partner Marianne lived in California for a while, operated a Mexican restaurant in France and have now carved nice niche in the heart of those seeking for the best burrito in Montreal. Stop by to satisfy your craving for the real deal - it's only a few minutes from downtown!"

Was looking for a take out mexican place and found this one.We ordered mix of chicken and beef tacos - both of us preferred the beef but the chicken was not bad. Salad, Beans, Rice - all were quite good.We liked that they were well set up for take out. Staff was super friendly.We will definitely go back again for take out."
/user_details?userid=SisbjmC3RGETDw4dzLDCYw,Diana K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Favourite Mexican in Montreal so far! Everything we've tried is amazing and delicious. So dangerous that we live less than a minute's walk away! Portion sizes are gigantic as well, so go in with an empty stomach :)"
/user_details?userid=CwFebMF23wOAepWE38XACA,Tomer N.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"Loved the Burrito ! I came with some friends to the next door pub, which doesnt serve food so we went to grab a bite and well this was next door. The food is not cheap 9-11$ per dish but it is worth it. I had the Vege burrito and it was seasoned and spiced perfectly. If you like spicy food ask in advance mine was mild and altough it was huge it was so good I could have eaten another. If I am ever in the area again I will surely stop there."
/user_details?userid=Sa0PkNg-L82B4pXaArCS5Q,Sarah B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I have passed by this place many times and finally taken the time to stop and eat. The food was amazing! My husband had the huge burrito and I had the tacos. The waitress was very sweet and I'm glad we stopped in for a quick bite

/user_details?userid=o_G9cuzzwQv5f2lCbF0Cuw,Tim S.,"Portland, OR",4 star rating,Best burrido in Montreal even if it is ridiculously expensive. Take what you can get. I often come here on the weekends after a morning at Allez Up. Good espresso too!
/user_details?userid=seR0RklSV0nbfXv31LtSxg,Stéphanie S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A nice addition to the neighborhood! Pointe St-Charles is not the place where you would expect a good taqueria, but it is! It's owned and operated by a family that lived in San Francisco and got the idea from there.Food is very good and fresh. They have ""aqua fresca"" only from time to time since the locals don't buy it, so I am trying to mount a campaign, so if you go ask for it! ;-)I had a cheese quesadilla that came with a nice plate with salad, salsa, nacho chips, a nice meal for under $10 !"
/user_details?userid=1nBWI8Y0AGK8-dk-Rjp8OQ,Erika T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,We love this place. We live upstairs and it's our go-to on no-cooking nights. Excellent burritos (carnitas and sweet potato are the best. California salad is amazing. Good guac. Love it. Pretty healthy too.
/user_details?userid=8p4JGNgZl705fByqyF6BrQ,Monyka T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Everything we've tried is very good. Menu a little limited but so far excellent.  Would love if they were open more often.

/user_details?userid=p2MN2X4gGPTk6eBmjKXIIA,Oldboy S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Nice one!  I lived in San Francisco for 6 years and this is the closest I have found in Montreal to a real taqueria.  Spicy sweet potato is rad and so is the verde.   Thank you for filling a void in local cuisine!
