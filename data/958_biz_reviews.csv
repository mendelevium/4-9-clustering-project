/user_details?userid=5ca2MkCJFAMafDrRxLMlXQ,Ash L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My Miel experience has been quite interesting:first time here, I ordered a ceviche dish that was probably the best I've ever had. When I asked what was the secret, the chef told us that it was the Vietnamese spicy sauce he put in (6 stars if I could give it!). However, the fish dish was just slightly too cooked (still good, 4 star), the chef insisted to change it after we gave him the feedback and he even gave us an extra dish for free: a pasta plate that was filling and delicious (5 star). Second time here: I ordered another pasta dish knowing it would be excellent (5 star), the ceviche dish was no longer on the menu so I tried the tuna tartare. the tuna was so good that brought back my memory of the fish market in Tokyo. Again I asked the chef what was the secret, he said that he has suppliers near Dorval that shipped him the freshest fish from Japan directly from the airport, and he used to have a chef from Japan as well (6 stars if I could give it!). However, again the octopus fish was slightly too cooked (still a solid 4 star). So overall, Miel had dishes that are out of this world despite its small misses. I suggest to give it more than one chance and order a lot of dishes to share. And it is always delightful to chat with the chef who is so passionate and dedicated! I believe that this place will continue to get better and better."

This quaint industrial chic venue located in Pointe St Charles is nicely decorated with its dark walls, light wood tables, industrial lighting and comfortable sofa seats, and offers a great laidback feel where you can high dine at an affordable price. We started with cocktails; I chose the cosmopolite martini, which was light and refreshing, made with tangy ginger and cranberry. My foodie group and I ordered an array of dishes to share and I can honestly say that everything was spot on! We tried the artichoke dish with lardo, broccoli with almonds and pear, the beet tartelette, duck hearts with string beans and crème fresh, duckling with squash and apple, the homemade gnocchi with poached egg, and scallop risotto. Every dish was spot on in terms of preparation, perfectly seasoned, incredible flavours and texture and the portions were more than generous; we couldn't help to take a doggy bag home. Unfortunately we didn't have room for dessert but the choices were soooo tempting. The wine selection was great, offering a great selection by the glass as well. The service was more than pleasant, from the moment we where greeted and throughout the service, our wait staff was attentive and personable. A thorough explanations the menus from cocktails to the food was presented and special attention for dietary changes, the restaurant was greatly accommodating. Overall, this resto made it to my top five in Montreal, and I will gladly return to try their other plates and deserts too. Hopefully, brunch will be on its way soon too!"

It's delicate food with endless flavor. It's worth every penny - so be prepared to spend a little bit. It's also super nice to sit outside, so if the weather is nice you get away from some of the chaos."
/user_details?userid=K95X5oE2-fuDZHhzFOfPUw,Meghan L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been here twice already and it only just opened a few months ago. Both times I sat on the terasse and the staff were very welcoming of my dog Jack, which I appreciated. It's a tapas style restaurant. Since I don't eat meat, it's a little limiting but there are still seafood and vegetarian options. There's a delicate balance of flavours in every dish and the food always arrives at the table at a perfect temperature. I'm not a big fan of sharing but if you like to share it's very doable. I love the artichoke, gnocci (which I believe involved orange zest), the risotto with scallops and salmon tataki. I found the oysters to be somewhat overpriced. Since oysters don't involve major prep work, I don't see why. I had a hard time deciding between giving this restaurant four or five star. I would say Miel is comparable to any of the celebrated and highly regarded Montreal restaurants such as Joe Beef or Chasse et Peche, for instance."
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"went to miel for a late lunch - in fact, my daughter and i arrived after they were technically closed and they were nice enough to let us order anyway. we ordered one serving of their pasta of the day which was prepared with pork cheeks and vegetables+ (crispy peas and corn, sauteed mushrooms and onions, toasted almonds, and shaved parmesian) and served in an aromatic and flavorful pork broth. included with the meal was either a soup (gazpacho) or salad (seemed fairly mundane - though served with a maple vinaigrette). we chose the former and it came with a house made focaccia. the latter was delicious while the former was ok but not a standout. the pasta dish was outstanding and beautiful - definitely the highlight of the meal. the restaurant was even kind enough to split the pasta dish into two portions (without us asking!).overall, i was very pleased with the meal experience here. certainly a well-above average meal for the area. will defnitely revisit."

They were serving a special chef's 5 course dinner with paired wines which we decided to try as a culinary adventure and our choice was well rewarded.  Every course was superb.   Exquisite quality...premier vegetables, fish and seafood with the texture of fluffy clouds, wines with layers of flavors, a revelatory dining experience. Visitors to Montreal, call your Uber, discover an off beat quirky neighborhood and a creative, original great chef."
/user_details?userid=N3qXiBRkGKFQc4Dup4F6dA,Anne B.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,Was excited to finally try this restaurant with it being so close to where I live. Made a brunch reservation but when we showed up we were told the chef had not shown up for work yet. We had to leave and go elsewhere. I'm sure the food is very good but that was very unprofessional. Too unreliable to go back.
/user_details?userid=Quku2Jn1u7iX6PXxbMoQxQ,Geneviève L.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The food was excellent. The menu is a bit limited and on the pricey side (the price of the vegetarian options in particular were a bit high for my taste) but I would say the artichoke was absolutely, incredibly delicious. The service was very warm, but slow, so you shouldn't be in a rush. This is not a ""I just don't feel like cooking"" kind of restaurant (at least, not for middle class), but it's a very good ""let's do something special tonight"" option."
/user_details?userid=70gUq_ngADEKYQqxgywZJA,Sami M.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,Great food and ambiance. Very welcoming. You can savour reasonable portions over more courses for a more complete dining experience.  Service was excellent as well.
