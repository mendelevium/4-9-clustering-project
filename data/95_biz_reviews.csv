/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"When it comes to brunch, I prefer to dine at home. However, Sparrow has completely changed my mind! Although this place is a bar, they offer an exceptional brunch, a combo of which I was initially skeptical about but now completely excited for. I cannot wait to come back here and try their other items on their menu. The options on their menu is large enough to satisfy anyone (in my opinion), and small enough to ensure that everything is served fresh.I shared the shakshuka with added merguez along with the French toast. These two dishes were so amazing that it was seriously hard to tell which one was better. The flavour profiles of both dishes worked perfectly in tandem and was definitely enough, portion-wise. At their price point, I can say without hesitation that the value is definitely there. Compared to other brunch-specific restaurants, it seems that Sparrow offers a more complex and true brunch meal at a quite affordable price. I cannot wait to come back here and try some of their other dishes, as they all look so good. Also, the very friendly staff made the experience even better!"
/user_details?userid=R9Cx2rilFJe-K_DQ5i2EAA,Ashley H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Buck-a-Shuck Mon-Fri is quite generous! Saves you from having to wait or potentially miss special days. The oysters are absolutely amazing and well shucked! They also come with a reeeeeally tasty vinaigrette. I also ordered the Jerk Wings and boy were they soooo good! I give my 5 stars  on food and service!

No signs of lineup the whole time we were there (looking at you l'Avenue!)I loved the Turkish coffee with loukoum. The only thing is the cup is a little small.They offer free refills on filter coffee.The shakshuka was amazing, very authentic flavors. Served with nice thick bread and options of feta or merguez. I added the feta and the portion is generous.None of the plates come with potatoes. My friend and it shared a side of potatoes and I highly recommend it. Very good and perfect size to share.My friend reported that the naan sandwich was a little dry. I think they forgot the cream cheese.They also offer all sorts of drinks, and the classics for brunch; bloody ceasar, mimosa, coffee royal, aperol spritz."

The shakshuka is seasoned to perfection and the buckwheat pancakes are fluffier than fluff and will satisfy any sweet tooth. I dream about those pancakes on the daily. Sadly, brunch is only on the weekend! Go earlier if you want to avoid waiting (they only do reservations for 10am)."

We came on a Saturday and had to wait a bit but it was worth it! This was my first time having shakshuka and I LOVED IT! Warm, saucy, and savoury especially during the long, cold winters. My friend had the buckwheat pancakes and from the bites I stole, they were also delicious --sweet, savoury, and not too heavy. The interior is cozy and nicely decorated. Service was fairly good. I will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu!"

I wanted something healthier than the typical western breakfast after a beautiful autumn run to Mont Royale and this eclectic restaurant in MileEnd hit the spot! Per the waitress' recommendation (she was the sweetest - gush) I got the house smoked trout with spinach pancakes and it was perfect! Love the beet salad and soft broiled egg with. It was a HUGE portion, especially for the price. I have to take a nap now ."
/user_details?userid=RwQUv7Cn61gTkPXcytSrSQ,Amy Yu T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Food: food was delicious, but not outstandingly so that I would rate it 5 starts. It's still basic brunch food such as eggs and bacon. The presentation is very pretty and instagram worthy. Service: the service wasn't as good as other brunch places. There was something off about their service staff who weren't friendly nor patient. Instead, they look almost annoyed at serving us. But it's always busy in the mornings there so it must not be personal and I just waved it off. Decor: loved the atmosphere and the rustic look. Overall, wouldn't come out of my way to come back, but wouldn't say no to coming back either."

/user_details?userid=u1zob4t6FYOwMme-TZxj2A,Naz T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I went to Sparrow with my cousin for brunch.They were quick to seat us once she arrived  and I understand that many brunch restaurants only seat you once the entire party arrives however  , I had to wait in a staircase ... I asked if I could have coffee while waiting, the waitress said yes but my coffee never arrived. The wait would have been nice with a warm coffee as it was absolutely frigid outside!  She ordered the Shakshuka and I got the Za'atar breakfast sandwich, however, the waitress got our orders wrong (I think she got distracted by my cousin's sunglasses as she kept complementing her! Haha). Once the sandwiches arrived , they looked good and we were so hungry, we decided to keep the order as is. The waitress was super sweet and brought us free mimosas to compensate! The sandwich was flavourful and I even had extras for lunch , later that day. Their menu features classics like eggs and bacon and breakfast Bahn-Mi or the Turkish Breakfast plate for the more adventurous crowd looking to try something new.The ambiance is very nice and the look is very rustic, a nice local brunch spot! After 5pm, it turns into a bar/ restaurant , open until 3 am.  If you're visiting Montreal , looking for a cool brunch spot - this is the perfect place but make sure the whole party is there to avoid being sent to the ""staircase""!!"

/user_details?userid=sGJvx1MTsetDzsnrHfJHLg,Aaron E.,"Orange County, CA",4 star rating,"Sparrow is a chic and refreshing​ spot to grab a custom mixed libation, wine, or craft Beer in Montréal's Mile End area. If you have never been to Montréal and were to envision what a charming​ Gastropub would look like, Sparrow is exactly the image​ in your head. A warm, dark interior with whimsical wallpaper​, wood tables, interior a ​design that is both antiquated and modern at the same time, and phenomenal​ servers both behind the bar and on the floor. I stopped in for a drink with friends​ and settled on the piney and acidic Death Valley Double IPA (8% ABV) which comes at you for $8.00 CAN. Not too expensive considering​ the tony locale and tragically hip environs if you ask me. They also offered a ""Buck a Shuck"" of Oysters which is an outstanding value for fresh Oysters - although I did not partake as we showed up after dining elsewhere. In retrospect, I wish I had stopped once more while I was in the area as I really enjoyed the short time I visited Sparrow. Oh, and the cuisine looked exemplary​ as well."

So, I came here with some friends to take advantage of the $1 oyster special.  We were not very impressed with the service. We ordered 30 oysters and we didn't receive any oysters until 45 minutes later, and they gave us 18. Not until we realized, did they bring the remaining 12. I thought this was a little strange as all you have to do is shuck the oysters, didn't understand why it took so long. After, we ordered 3 appetizers to share - calamari, turmeric rice salad, mussels with frites. All the food was very good! The prices are very reasonable as well. A final note: cocktails are very good! I had the whiskey lemonade and a Caesar, both great! My friends had a French 75 and basil gimlet - no complaints there. It's a shame that the service is a little slow."

/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is nuts on Sundays. Every hipster in town seems to be having brunch here. Buddy and I were lucky in that we were seated at the bar almost immediately. I had the Bahn-mi breakfast sandwich which was stuffed with fried eggs, slow-cooked pork belly, shredded carrots, daikon radish, cilantro and a few slices of Asian red chillies along with some sauce. I ate it right up along with side order of roasted potatoes. My friend had the buckwheat pancakes and couldn't stop raving about it. It was a giant mound of pancakes slathered with bacon. I also had a blood orange mimosa. Talk about a rich brunch. Food and ambiance were A1 but hipsters really annoy me so if I go back, it will probably at a slower time."

Would 100% recommend the Banh Mi sandwich! Egg, pork, carrot, daikon, and all the fixins. It's everything you could want and more. I tried my friend's buckwheat pancakes and they were also delicious.The place also has a great ambiance -- the interior is chic, cozy, and wooden, with a casual atmosphere.Would highly reccomend this place! We made a reservation for 10am on a Sunday, and it was already busy by the time we arrived. P.s. Grab some Fairmount bagels while you're in the neighborhood!"
/user_details?userid=yX8KBKyQAnChir0HabUcCQ,Mars N.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,Best Breakfast SandwichThe zaatar breakfast sandwich had to be one of the best breakfast sandwich I ever had.  The yogurt spread and spices gave it a Mediterranean flavor to it.  I recommend adding the delicious sausage with it.

They take reservations for brunch at 10am, so if you're an early bird (not me, and pun not intended), I suggest making one as they have long waits.I had the shakshuka with chorizo, and it's probably the best I've had yet. Great coffee as well, and I would love to come back for their dinner/bar."
/user_details?userid=fKVY_1V1aAZppot96bXoLg,Erin O.,"Lynn, MA",5 star rating,"Amazing. Went here on recommendation from a friend when my husband and I were first timers in Montreal. Inside is super cute with a great bar. We grabbed two seats at the bar and got a delish and spicy Bloody Mary and coffee. The menu had a Mediterranean/Moroccan influence which we love. I got the Zatar breakfast sandwich.. fried egg, tomato, cucumber ribbons, lots of herbs and some toasted seed spread. Came with a yummy yogurt dill sauce and on toasted flatbread bread. The plates food were served on were mismatch antique looking and pretty cool. Same for coffee cups. We arrived on the early side due to their website noting they only take reservations for the 10:00 spot right when they open and seeing reviews that they fill up quick. This was true! We arrived around 10:20 and were the first bar customers and by 10:45 bar was full and line out the door. Side note, a girl helping the bartender broke a glass on the beer tap grill causing them to have to burn and refill the ice for safety of guests. The bartender was super calm about it even though he was really busy and the manager (maybe owner) swooped right in to help in a very calm manner as well. This was nice to see as I've bartended for many years and things can get stressful and mangers (owners) can be assholes when mistakes happen and these two reacted great and made it like no big deal. Will return again!!"

I was brought here by friends for brunch and was very impressed. I get so sick of going out to brunch and paying $15 for eggs, it's far more worth it when there's something unique about the food that I wouldn't bother to make at home. Sparrow has me covered there, from Shakshuka to even a breakfast Banh-Mi. I myself ordered the Zaatar sandwich with merguez - heck YES!!!!! And oh, was it goooooood. Came with potatoes and a nice salad too, great deal.I also had the basil gimlet which was super refreshing and just a hint of sweet. My friends had the Caeser - a bloody mary variation - and ... well I forgot, but it was purple and tasted excellent too. Awesome spot, can get a little crowded but it's only because it's worth the wait!"

/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I chose this for a surprise weekend date with my boyfriend. I knew it might be crowded and difficult to have a table, so I decided to go there early. When we showed up around 10 AM, a few tables were already seated. The dining room was pleasantly decorated with vintage and mismatched furniture (I spotted a church bench!), although slightly austere due to all the dark woodwork and sobriety.We sat down close to the bar and reached for our menus. When I watch movies at home, I have the terrible habit of checking the plot summary on Internet - I just can't help it, the apprehension kills me. In a similar way, I can't help but to study a restaurant's menu carefully before going there. There's no more surprise, but there's a weird satisfaction in knowing exactly what one wants. So right away I ordered the House-Smoked Trout, and after some intense reflection, my boyfriend chose the Shakshuka. The food came as I was enjoying my classic Mimosa. The plates were absolutly gorgeous: the colors were rich, appetizing, and conveyed a warm sense of plenty. The first bites were simply scrumptious. The spinach and green onion pancakes were thick and buttery, the slices of smoked trout were thick and buttery, the generous dollop of cream was thick and buttery...Needless to say that I started feeling overwhelmed halfway through the meal - thank goodness for the beets! My boyfriend obviously wasn't intimidated by his food in any way. He devoured his poached eggs and toast in a heartbeat.It was quite a substantial - and delicious - start for our day!"

Sparrow knows how to serve you the full breakfast experience with excellence. Me and my friend had the shakshuka which was beautifully served and was full of flavour. Their filter coffee was so good that I craved it all day.The only problem today was that they forgot our donuts so we waited almost an hour for them but then they compensated by giving them to us for free. Great place, can't wait to come back again honestly."
/user_details?userid=JMP9JY5JV2HfWn8ClTBb6A,Matthew T.,"Bradenton, FL",3 star rating,"Another place that has lines out the door for Brunch, but a little less so for Dinner.  On a Sunday night, it is one of the only things open so gave it a try.  Reviews looked good, so hopeful, but the night we were there they were out of oysters which it seems like this place has the best price on the block for.  I had the burger.  It had a good crust but wasn't seasoned.  But the really good fries were and they were yummy.  My DC had the pork chop.  That was one of the best pork chops, smoky and tender that was done nicely and seasoned properly.  But it was served with what was supposed to be Aloo Gobi and lets just say  that was pretty much not worth having.  Really no flavor to it.  Wines were nice and service was good.  But just A OK, nothing to exciting."
/user_details?userid=7iZOLfdpS_iRYLR7hi6hPg,Cole S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The interior of sparrow is really gorgeous. Sweet decor, lots of beautifully aged wood, and thoughtful little touches of ornamentation. Lovely place to bring a parent/grandparent as it has a very antique old world feel to it. Also suitable for your average gang of millennial hipsters. **Bear in mind there is often a line on weekends. Their hours of operation are also a little bit different than the norm, so be sure to check if they're open before going. They have a a really great cardamom coffee, yummy but a tad small food items that go well with tea, such as a little cucumber sandwiches and such. I removed one star because from personal experience, If you going for an actual brunch or lunch, there is not many options for vegetarians on the menu. Overall, I absolutely love this place and I would highly recommend it. Even though it's crowded sometimes, there still an intimate cozy feeling once you're seated."
/user_details?userid=vNToltF1f4NLPRNHH4DEbg,Sam G.,"Mississauga, Canada",4 star rating,"Pleasant Sunday brunch place!Drinks 5/5: I'm normally not a fan of lavender flavoured things because I find they taste like soap but their lavender latte was the right amount of fragrant! One friend got the ginger honey lemonade which was refreshing. Another friend got the cafe royal which I thought was a bit strong but he really liked it.Food 3.5/5: I ordered the shakshuka and was relatively disappointed. It was literally tomato sauce with 2 eggs on top and some bread. The bread was too hard, I had trouble biting into it. The rest of my group was more satisfied with their food. Two friends got the eggs with sage which they liked except for the potatoes which she found to be on the sweet side. One friend tried it with bacon and the other tomato and they decided the tomato was better. My boyfriend had the oatmeal which had loads of toppings and was almost like eating dessert. Another friend got the house smoked trout and it was unanimously the winner of brunch! The pancake was savour and tasty and went very well with the fish and creme fresh. It came with a beet salad which was a nice touch to a balanced meals. Atmosphere 4/5: The place was very homey and comfortable. It's a fairly small space so there was quite a lineup outside for brunch. We were a group of six and we arrived at about 11am, initially they told us the wait time would be half an hour but it ended up being over an hour."

It got super busy really quickly, so make sure you make a reservation. They only take reservations when they open at 10am on the weekends. Their menu isn't your standard brunch so you should come here if you want a change from the typical eggs and sausage scene. I got the smoked salmon pancake dish and it was really good. It didn't live up to my expectations since the other yelp reviews hyped it up too much for me. The smoked salmon was fresh and their beet salad is amazing. I could have just sat there and ate their beet salad for hours. Coffee was unlimited which was a plus!"

Second time around and tried the House-Smoked Trout, which exceeded my already high expectation of a decadent dish bursting with dynamic flavor. The trout truly makes your taste buds dance and the pancake, beets, egg and creme fraiche all coordinate for a perfect, complex bite. Highly recommend for any local or visitor!!

I also really like the restaurant's decor; for some reason it reminded me of being inside of an old ship (but that could just be me).

I decided to explore around Montreal for a new brunch spot in the Mile End and discovered this classy and chic location with friendly staff and a very unique menu. I had the Smoked Trout which came with pouched eggs, roasted beets, and three pieces of potato cakes! What a meal! I really enjoyed the combination included in my brunch. The smoked trout tasted like smoked salmon but less fishy, the potato cakes came with whipped butter which made it extra creamy and smooth. The beets was cooked perfectly. Overall an epic brunch which costed me close to $22 after tax and tips.The coffee here is also amazing, it was only $2 and it came with unlimited refills! It was freshly brewed and they also had brown and white sugar for you to add in your coffee which was a plus!My friend had the steak and eggs and it looked really good. However his comment to me was it was pretty standard and had better elsewhere. However it looked good to me so I plan to try it next!Overall, we spent over two hours in this place and enjoyed every minute of our brunch. Will be back again for sure."

When there is a wait, you are treated as a customer and with respect- not just another name/number a server has to tend to2. You're given water right away without having to ask3. Someone checks in within a few minutes to get in a drink order4. Coffee refills happen without asking thanks to an observant and engaged front of house staff5. The food is made within a very reasonable amount of time so that you're not starving :)6. The presentation of your food makes you want to devour it right away without first snapping a pic, of course ;)7. The decor. Classy, inviting, comfy, and refreshing. Especially after a night of boozing8. The staff are all smiles :)I recommend trying any of Fried Eggs with Sage, Breakfast Banh-Mi, or Steak & Eggs.If you're looking for more of a traditional bfast, go with Fried Eggs with Sage. If you're a fan of Vietnamese Subs and maybe you're feeling like you want breakfast but also leaning towards lunch, choose that option. It's huge, well worth your money. If you want a Turkish twist and want Meat (and you're a fan of steak) do the Steak & Eggs.Hope this helps!"

Also tried the Turkish breakfast. Not my typical breakfast, which is nice because, just like the banh-mi, it makes their brunch menu stand out from the other brunch places.  Nothing to complain about. Okay service and good food, if only a tiny bit on the expensive side for a brunch. Overall, an excellent choice if you want to try something different for breakfast."

I find the interior decor of Sparrow less impressive than Cardinal Tea House which is upstairs, but it's still quite good. I tried their homemade trout and my friend took the shakshuka, both were really great! The dishes are really beautiful and the taste quite unique, since it's Turkish-Moroccan style, which is quite flavourful and exotic. I was a bit surprised that the smoked trout was a bit warm, which tasted quite good! My friend really fell in love for the yummy sauce of her shakshuka dish, and me too! However, I found the service below average and the food was served quite slowly. The noise level was also really high and it was hard to have a nice conversation."

Street parking only.The place: Loved the decor and the funky wallpaper. To me, the place was a cross between country meets British pub. Good vibrations all around. The food: Back in March or April, one of the staff told me a new chef would be taking over. When I took a look at the menu yesterday, I felt that the choices were limited - there were maybe 5-6 options. Gone were the Red Velvet waffles and no Polenta fries in sight. Anyway, I decided to go with the fried eggs with sage, roasted potatoes, bacon and sourdough toast, served on a board, a skillet for my eggs and all. It was a good breakfast - the eggs were tasty, though I couldn't taste the sage. The potatoes were perfectly roasted, if lacking in flavour, the bacon was super thin which I like, but a bit too oily for me. The bread was fresh as can be and damn good to boot. My date had the Turkish breakfast and it was OK but nothing to write home about. Service: Good. The only hiccup was when our food was brought to us. My date is allergic to gluten so when the waitress took our order, she offered a green salad as a substitute for the pancakes. No mention of extra costs. The person who brought our plates over gave my date attitude when she asked for the salad and started saying there would be an extra charge for this. She wasn't accommodating at all and frankly, a little rude. Pay attention when we try to explain why a substitute was requested, and that this was offered by your colleague. The person who took our order came to sort this out which we appreciated but I mean, a little common courtesy from the other chick would have been nice. It's not like one chooses to have Celiac disease. Price point: Pretty decent - my plate was about $10. However. Coffee wasn't included."

Unfortunately, at the end the waiter impolitely raised his voice about tipping (although we gave him tip, but he complained.) He has to know tipping is a privilege, not an obligation, and if someone is totally happy will give more tip. We were not totally satisfied with the service.Not going there for a second time because of being treated this way in front of my friends and other people.

Party because it was not super filling and the poached eggs. Unfortunately the poached eggs were hard. It would have been a totally game changer if it was soft boiled.

Tried the beet/carrot/some other fruit fresh made juice combination - light refreshing and tasty!I ordered the smoke trout - comes with an egg, beets, and what tastes like a seasoned pancake? At the bottom. Delicious! Haven't tried smoked trout before but was quite similar to smoked salmon.The wife ordered the Shakshuda - think poached eggs surrounded by a tomato based sauce served with some bread and a choice of feta cheese or lamb sausage on the side. We opted to try both and were not dissapointed! Interestingly the seasoning on the lamb sausage had a very authentic taste to it and the rest of the dish was enjoyable as well.Would absolutely repeat for brunch - great service, great food, and was surprised by how much I liked that beet/carrot juice combination.

I enjoyed the entré of olives and nuts and I know my company enjoyed the cheese and cracker entré as well!We also had some oysters, and I will admit I'm new to oysters from about a year and a half ago, but these were really good and I wished we had ordered more. The main course, butter chicken curry was actually very good. I would say it lacked just a bit of seasoning but the flavors were powerful yet subtle and the accompanying rice and salads were just delicious!I need to take a moment to say I tried to order the butter chicken and a full salad. He waitress wisely advised me that would be too much food, and was very accommodating when I asked for a side sized salad instead. It was a delicious arugula salad.

I got a smoked trout dish. The trout came as a rosette on top of a savory chopped parsley potato cake. Also came with sour cream and a side of beet and quince salad. Though I was tempted by the cardomom latte and blood orange mimosa I just had to have a savoury cocktail. My Bloody Mary was perfect; the sourness and saltiness seemed to balance with the spiciness. Might I add, the olive, pickle-lette and marinated cauliflower that came on the pick tasted addictive. Ugh it was just so good"

Beside sitting on highly uncomfortable low stools we were looking forward to get our foody on and ordered all different plates. Œufs à la sauge, buckweat pancakes, granola yogurt, steak and eggs, ice tea, home made OJ and 2 of us ordered their famous donuts. They have 3 flavors available:NutellaPeanut butter and jamAnd Lemon.My friend ordered 3 Nutella ( they come as serve of 3) and my other friend ordered the mixed 3 which is one of each flavors.So, I was amazed, we were a group and the waitress took zero note. We waited a long time, and the ice tea was forgotten, the OJs were tiny and the donuts: my friend who ordered the mixed ones got 3 lemons, the one who ordered 3 Nutella got the mixed ones. So clearly the Nutella was mixed up  and they gave us lemons and then the waitress got mixed up on who ordered what so we politely told her and showed her it was yellow lemon cream ( delicious by the way but oh so lemons) and she started to argue with us that she was gonna credit these but that the order was right and that we ordered jam and the lemons were jam! We were like ""are u effing kidding me"" ?! To make a mistake is fine but don't Bs us !

We arrived here around 11am in the afternoon, and were lucky enough to be seated right away. They don't take reservations, so I highly recommend coming before the brunch rush (which starts flooding in around 12pm). Our server came over with menus and water right away, and we were soon happily mulling over what we wanted to order. I ordered coffee, which comes with unlimited refills ($2), and you can ask for soy milk instead of the usual milk or cream. The coffee was fantastic, and the unlimited refills satisfied my early morning need for caffeine.My friend had been here in the past and recommended the house-smoked trout ($16). I was trying to decide between this dish and the Shakshuka ($13), which contains two poached eggs in a Morrocan spiced tomato sauce and sourdough toast. Both sounded amazing, but with the reverent reviews of the trout, I had to try it for myself. Once we ordered, our food arrived pretty quickly, in under 15 min. The house-smoked trout comes with a hefty portion of delicious smoked trout, on top of savoury and fluffy green onion pancakes, a soft boiled egg, side of beets and creme fraiche to complement. It was a huge portion for $16, and I was completely satisfied after. I was so glad I ordered this, and if given the choice, would hands down order it again. The lightness of the creme fraiche and green onion pancakes went perfectly with the saltier, more dense texture of the trout. Service was amazing throughout, food was fantastic, and I loved the hip, quiet and homey environment. I'll definitely be back the next time I visit Montreal!"

I was able to steal a few bites and it was quite delicious, albeit slightly under-seasoned.My boyfriend went for fried chicken and waffles ($15.5)- fried chicken, buttermilk waffles, sunny eggs, white gravy and honey. No complaints about this one!Sadly for me, I was the most disappointed with my own selection - pulled pork ($14) with homemade biscuit, coleslaw, homemade tater tots, and two sunny eggs. I realized then that I only like BBQ-style pulled pork, and this one just didn't appeal to me. I really should've ordered the red velvet waffles, which sounded divine.

My guy ordered the apple pancakes which were massive with applesauce on top and nice walnuts plus fresh cream. The coffee is delicious.CocktailsWonderful. The SpaceVintage vibe with low lighting that makes for a cozy cool date spot or night with friends.

I took my family out from Sunday brunch and none of us were disappointed. Two of us started off with coffee, my mother and I opted for the fresh pressed beet juice. Yum. My mother and sister got the thyme fried eggs. Looked very good, and the bacon was thick and meaty. The eggs are free range and organic, the yolks where a beautiful rich orange. I really appreciate places that advertise it on their menu and decide to use organic ingredients. It can be surprisingly rare to see in Montreal. My dad decided on the granola and yogurt. It looked amazing. A mound of thick delicious yogurt covered in fruit and homemade granola. I went for the Shakshuka with merguez sausage. It was delicious. I will be back to check out their upstairs tea room."

The store front doesn't say ""The Sparrow or Le Moineau"" instead there's a picture of a sparrow. Drawn to its aesthetics, my friends and I walked into this dimly lit, dark wood furniture joint (wooden tables, chairs, bookcases with books in French! Simply classy and extremely hipster-y.Anyway, we stumbled upon this place because we wanted to check out some local bars and have a place to hang out... and I think we hit jackpot (at least for our personalities, we were looking for cool, hipster-y hangout with not too many people). We were able to play a game of Jenga thanks to the bar (I guess they offer some board games?) As for drinks, my favorite drink of the night was the dark and stormy! It was the perfect blend of rum and ginger beer... très délicieux! Although it was a Sunday night, the place wasn't completely deserted, it had the right amount of people. The crowd consist of young twenty something hipster-y looking people.. some of which can be young professionals or mature college kids who are able to engage in some intellectually stimulating and witty conversations. Bottom line: I loved this place and would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Montreal!"

It was full and we had to wait a little before sitting which is fine seeing how other restos surrounding had over an hour waiting list. The waitresses were very polite and efficient, overall no problem with the service. The food though, was ok. Nothing special, nothing extraordinary, simply ok. Seeing how people were actually waiting in line I was expecting a lot more. But no, just, ok. My girlfriend had steak and eggs which was a very average plate and she was disappointed by their supreme coffee which really just tasted like ok coffee. I had pancakes, and was charged an extra for asking for maple syrup. I repeat, I was charged for asking maple syrup for my pancakes in a brunch establishment. Well, I tried."

Getting food + drinks together (I know, so weird to order both at a restaurant!)?

I know it sounds zzz but trust me when I say I barely did any talking during my reunion with my college best friend because I was so busy slurping up this stew. I still can't stop thinking about it! No menu or web presence means I can't recount exactly what was in it, but it was thick, hearty and very earthy with all that mushroomy goodness. The polenta fries weren't nearly as exciting as promised - just sort of flavourless. French 75 cocktail was dynamite. Not much to say about the service - it's unsurprisingly slow so come with low expectations. They did allow completely separate cheques though which is always appreciated. I will absolutely be back!"

/user_details?userid=GkbaBeSGvt-UmIcefpEARA,Andrea L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Another reviewer called The Sparrow a ""British gastropub"" and I think it's an apt description. High-quality pub food with an Indian twist (like a real pub in England, not like the usual British pub in North America) at very reasonable prices.My regret is going there for after-dinner drinks, and therefore not being hungry enough for the ""real food"" on the menu. I was there with a group of Yelpers and we snacked on fries (from real potatoes, with the skins on) served with AMAZING  homemade ketchup and homemade mayo, and hot, crispy polenta fries. My basil gimlet (gin, lime, fresh basil) was fab. Will have to try to reproduce this one at home.The atmosphere was ""funky old mansion"" with full bookcases, black-and-white portaits on the walls, and a tin ceiling.I will definitely be coming back with my dear husband for another crack at the menu. I've heard it's very popular at brunch. It might be an excellent warming-up spot during the Christmas market at a nearby park (St-Laurent & Laurier)."

My hubby had Scotch eggs, they arrived raw on the inside, he found this out after taking a big bite...mmm, mmm raw pork...They made him some new ones but he wasn't very pleased with those either because they decided against hard-boiled eggs for the center (weird decisions much?) and he found them really bland.The apple juice they offered him was very good though, and my Bloody Caesar was also nice.On top of that they do have really good service (Minus a 40+ minute wait on our food) , they communicated well with my husband and we didn't  have to pay for anything he consumed.So not all is bad..."
/user_details?userid=wdXAYS8vkh7evjt29RoLFw,Lea T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"As a Sparrow fan for the past couple years, I was completely let down by my experience with them this morning. There were five of us in the group, waiting for a table, which took a while but I'm used to that. When we finally got seated, the waitress took our drink orders while we waited for the last person in our party to arrive. The bar was backed up the whole time we were there, and it took forever to get any of our drinks -- again, I'm used to that, and we're a pretty patient group. Another waitress came by to ask if we were still waiting for the last person in our party, and I told her that we were, but that we were ready to order and that our friend had told us not to wait for her. She took the three other orders at the table, and when she got to me, I forgot my order and began to mumble, at which point she decided it would be cute and funny to COUNT ME DOWN. As in, ""3...2...1... I'm leaving"" so I blurted out a menu item and away she went, leaving our table bewildered, confused and uncomfortable. As someone who has worked in customer service before (not food service, but still dealing with long lines of impatient clients), I understand being rushed, stressed and under staffed, but that was just plain rude and condescending and wholly uncalled for. She could have just come back to our table. Again I understand that it must have been frustrating for me to tell her that we were ready to order, and then be indecisive when my turn came to give my order, but still. When our last friend arrived, the same waitress went past our table checking on other tables beside us at least six times, noticing my friend but not stopping to take her order or even acknowledge that she had arrived. From my personal experience, it is completely acceptable to tell a customer ""Hi, I'll be with you in a minute"" and not leave the customer waiting around wondering if someone is ever going to come take their order. My friend had to tap her on the shoulder to get her attention, when she was just standing behind us looking around the room. Again, Sparrow is a tight space, it was very busy, it's difficult for the waitstaff to navigate between tables, but it seemed like she flat out ignored our table after she took our orders, which brings me to my next point. Sparrow has a great ambiance, which unfortunately rests on the place being extremely loud, not just because of how packed it is, but also because of the music. The noise level is just plain ridiculous, I'm sorry, ambiance is one thing, not being able to hear/ be heard by your customers is another. Our orders got mixed up because she couldn't hear us over the music, which is fine, forgetting people's side orders is fine, but when the time came for us to get the bill it was beyond unacceptable. They mixed up our bills, as some of us were getting bills together and others were getting their own, but halfway through our meal we had ordered a second round of coffees and drinks, which the waitress didn't forget to bill us for, she just forgot to put the orders in to the bar, which was backed up. So my friend and I got our second drinks only after we painstakingly pointed out to the waitress that they'd been billed and not delivered to our table. The food at Sparrow is always good, I usually always leave very pleased with my meal, but the service we got today is enough for me to say that I won't be going back for a while."

But we waited without saying a word except for maybe the occasional dirty look towards those that kept ordering beverages even thought they clearly saw that 10-15 people waiting at the door. The waitress finally seated us after 45min wait and then... she ordered the wrong meals for us... very weird. She felt awful credited the wrong plates.

We arrived fifteen minutes before our reservation and upon walking in to an empty restaurant were curtly told ""we're not open."" Better restaurants would have invited us to sit down inside with a glass of water while we waited for them to open. Instead, we waited outside on a bench in front of a nearby store in the wind. I guess they feel it helps their hipster cred to have people ""line up"" outside the restaurant five minutes before 10. I think it's just poor customer service.When we were finally allowed inside I was struck by how over-the-top hipster the decor was, it was basically like eating in an urban outfitters store. It was also very strange how uninteresting most of the menu items seemed to me -- I am a brunch fanatic so I usually find at least a few things appealing on even mediocre brunch menus. I ended up choosing a salmon dish with cream fraiche and spinach pancakes.  The dish was okay, but I was thrown off by the strange, strong spice in the pancakes (some sort of curry maybe?), which was completely incongruent to the other flavors in the dish and jarring. I also consider it poor service that we had to continually ask for water refills."

Based on my readings online, I have clearly been missing out on some fantastic options and as such, decided to remedy the situation. About a month or so ago, I started along this path by visiting The Sparrow on St-Laurent (near Maguire) in the Mild End district of the city with a friend.Now, under normal circumstances, The Sparrow is a British gastropub which I clearly need to visit during evenings hours. The place has a great look and feel. The music selection during our meal was an amazing eclectic mix of soul, old rock, jazz which I hummed along to throughout the meal. The service was also quite quick and efficient despite the crowded restaurant (We arrived at opening hence the empty picture above... It filled up rather quickly afterwards) If you check the hours at the door, you would have no idea that they even do breakfast/brunch on weekends... It's not listed! However, they do amazingly creative and delicious fare.What you see before you is house smoked pork, eggs, apple sauce, house made tater-tots and the most legitimate biscuit I've ever had outside of the southern US. Add to that a side of chorizo sausage &amp; a bourbon lemonade and you get a sense of the kind of food this pub serves up. My friend, on her end, ordered eggs benedict prepared superbly with asparagus and which used biscuits as a replacement for the English muffins. Across the board, the food was quite delicious.If you're looking for a fun and slightly different take of the typical breakfast/ brunch meal, The Sparrow is great choice to try. Note that they only take cash, so be prepared accordingly.Cheers!"

""I wonder what could be in there?"", I thought.  The wooden banister is such a nice touch as well.  They have a bunch of really cool old photographs down at the end of the bar.  They're the type of photographs that you could look at for hours if you were peaking on psychopsilocybin.  But since I'm way to intelligent for that type of fun now, all I needed was a minute and a half to realize how cool they were.The food was really good and very reasonably priced.  The servers were down to earth and friendly.My absolute favorite thing about Sparrow, besides the name, is the wall covered in paintings of white birds.  Again this is another point of potential trip out, but for me it just filled me with wonder,  and warmed my heart.Such a nice vibe."
/user_details?userid=oSkz7bxTAoFJxgDGP5wJHg,John H.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Sparrow has been my favourite place in Mile End to get a cocktail for the last five years. But recently, I've come to realize that it is also a great place to grab dinner. The dinner menu is short but sweet, with the polish of a fancier resto while keeping most prices under $20. My companion ploughed through a plate of pork roast, South Asian-inflected potatoes, greens, and cilantro garnish simply because it was some of the tastiest pork either of us had had in a long time. The serving was generous enough for me to sneak a few bites in and get some not-so-generous looks from across the table. While I might still opt for Nouveau Palais' burger if forced to choose, Sparrow's was exactly what I wanted -- eggy roll, priced in the low teens, good fries and that telltale grease drip that tells you they're doing it right. Every time I have been, there has been at least one attractive, substantial vegetarian option that leads with vegetable protein like lentils (a harder standard to meet in the neighbourhood than you might think). So next time you are brunching or sipping a drink here, have a look at the dinner menu too. (But in moderation, because I still want to be able to get a table.)"
/user_details?userid=OJlcvrxotp8rZy3oEmM7SA,Wilson J.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,Writing my first ever review because I couldn't find the contact info to deliver this directly to the owners. Went last night (Thursday) by myself for a little nightcap at the bar. Reasonably busy but bartender is ensconced at the other end deep into communion with his cell phone. I thought it strange but whatever. Then as the minutes passed and he continued to ignore me even as he got off his phone I started to get peeved. The fact that his colleague who serves the much busier floor tried to pick up his slack and even had to apologize in his stead only highlighted the fact that it IS a fact that this bartender needs to find himself another job or be retrained to view the world as not revolving around him. In short my pleasant walk in the frigid cold was ruined by ending up at the Sparrow rather than the gazillion other bars nearby with far superior bartenders.

I stupidly waited 45 minutes to get into Lawrence, was still 7th on the list and then my stomach told me ""F*&k this noise"" and I walked a block down to Sparrow where I had what was quite possibly the best brunch of my life: eggs benedict, nom nom. It was nestled on a buttery, home made biscuit topped with perfectly cooked asparagus and just the right amount of hollandaise. There were home made tater tots on the side (SO yummy!) and the latte I had with it was absolute perfection. The prices are right, service is great and the location cannot be beat. Too bad the place was 3/4 hipster, but I was able to ignore them and look out the window."

Both of the salty dishes were fantastic and original tasting for  brunch items. The savory pancakes in the trout dish were a lovely surprise and I would love to see it on more menus around town.   The pancakes were extremely sweet for breakfast (more appropriate for a dessert). If I lived  in the area, I would definitely eat at Sparrow more often, but unlike Régine Café I wouldn't necessarily make a special trip here unless I was meeting up with friends."

/user_details?userid=E8N-hgXND7_wUGOA5u9jKA,Howard G.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"To be honest I ended up here as a second choice because the line at Beauty's was about an hour long.......that being said, next time this is my 1st choice! Sparrow is a great restaurant tucked into St-Laurent exactly in-between St-Viateur and Fairmount (which is strange since they don't serve bagels). The restaurant has a really nice neighborhood feel and a menu full of unique dishes that all have a Mediterranean/Middle-East influence. The dishes are a nice sized potion and DELICIOUS! Service was great, and if you're waiting by the door for a table they'll invite you to sit on the stairs inside and order coffee (which doesn't really make me feel better about waiting for a table). The wait was only about 15 minutes and definitely worth it.  My Zaatar egg sandwich with merguez sausage was one of the best things I've had in a while, it was just brimming with multiple flavors to create an amazing dish. My cousin had the buckwheat pancakes which were outstanding.....an adjective I've never used to describe anything made with buckwheat. One added delicacy was the 3 mini doughnuts you can order as a side-dish. (lemon, PB&J and Nutella). This was a restaurant I always heard of as one of the better brunch places in the city but never went to until now. I'm going back....who's with me??!!"
/user_details?userid=2T7IWnZjZcifxS305CprUQ,Sophie G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Went there for dinner, at a table and not the bar.Lovely ambiance, although a bit cold on the temperature side for my liking. The menu is simple, without pretense (none of those names you won't recognize).We ordered oysters and devils on a horseback. Oyster were fresh, but nothing outstanding. The other appetizer was an interesting discovery for me, very interesting mix of bacon, plums and caramelized sauce.As for the mains, they gave hearty portions. The pan-roasted trout came with some simple vegetable (a ball of carrot slaw, roasted cauliflower, and diced tomato salad) and herb-flavoured basmati rice. The pork chops came with some wedge potatoes and vegetables. Simple, but effective.Service was attentive without being over bearing. On the downside, the food seemed slow to come. The second appetizer seemed to have taken forever to appear at our table, and we waited for the mains too, long after having polished off the appetizers.I would come back to try their brunch and their alcohols, which sadly we didn't get to sample."

All around a great vibe- I wish I could go back there right now!The prices for cocktails were a little steep- $8 and not very big. That's pretty much my only complaint.

When we walked in we waited a minute or two and then asked the bartender if we had to be seated or if we could sit anywhere, thinking it was more of a dinner place - he said we could sit anywhere. Shortly after the bartender came over to us with menus which only had drinks, and then promptly ignored us for the next 15 minutes, while continuing to tend to tables around us (including customers who came in after us). We finally purchased our drinks at the bar - the drinks were, in fact, very good! However, the service was very subpar; the bartender was inattentive, short, and curt. We would be willing to try again, but on a different night/at a different time."

I will mention that they have wild chanterelles on the menu right now as they are in season.Service was much more than compentant!

My first time there, I ordered my first martini, ever.  With gin, and dirty.  The barman was a new face, and the owner was right there.  As it was not too busy, he took the time to personally show the barman the Sparrow way of making a proper dirty gin martini and it was delicious.  Every concoction be it a classic (Manhattan, Rusty Nail, Bulldog, etc.) has one downside: it is so good that you down it so fast that you need to order another right away.  The sparrow-specific cocktails are definitely also worth a try.Having not yet tried the brunch, I have at least tried the ""pub grub"" which is deliciously crafted and very gobble-able as well.Servers are prompt and professional with and amazingly easy on the eyes - which shouldn't matter; but it does ameliorate the experience on a superficial level at the least."
