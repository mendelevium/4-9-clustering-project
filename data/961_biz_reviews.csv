Had a wonderful gazpacho and vegan risotto with grilled asparagus and baby carrots as well as wonderful fresh herbs. Look it up, its tiny but way worth it."
/user_details?userid=gLSQCEhGy7-uRnNbNnVykg,Andrew D.,"Melbourne, Australia",3 star rating,"Mmmm. Not that impressed with the food here. The vodka cocktail was not bad, pretty spicy. The food was mostly bland, incomparable to Planta queen in Toronto (amazing vegan resto). The furniture also looks like some sort of ikea collection. The burger was decent, the brocolli too, everything else we ordered was very very average. Seems like they rely on deep frying the absolute crap out of things for flavour.. isn't vegan food supposedly more healthy?"

The cocktails are well balanced and full of flavor and the dishes lovely presented and absolutely delicious! Plus they have all day brunch! I want to move at Tendresse, it's that good!"
