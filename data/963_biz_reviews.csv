/user_details?userid=4VjjMQn-SsdtmDKKYUE39A,Beth M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Went last night with my partner for a special celebratory night out. Requested a terrasse spot to try to mitigate COVID risk. No problem at all.Hostess was really nice, great welcome. Our waiter was great as well. Great that he was just the right amount of chatty and pleasant, but still quick service!We both ordered the chicken fingers and fries. The food was fantastic. The only thing is that the fried layer of the chicken just seemed a bit thin, and the whole pieces of chicken just seemed to be just slightly short of perfection, expecting a bit more crispy layer to it, and not one that was as thin as a butterfly's wing.Otherwise, great experience. It was sad that there is of course, no JFL this year, so hanging in the QdS at this time just felt bittersweet, but of course, that's not at any fault of Baton Rouge."
/user_details?userid=d_uSfozaAZR4OpDNa8IiZQ,Dy M.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"My wife was craving dessert and we have always heard good things about the Baton Rouge Cheesecakes. They had a raspberry white chocolate cheesecake for $8, around $9 after tax. It was not good, it was the smallest slice I have ever seen. Also, it was nothing special to the point, I could have gotten a frozen cheesecake - whole cheesecake and it would have been better than the one that was served. It was overall a very disappointing experience and I definitely would not come here for a meal."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,A decent place to get a meal if you're in Place des Arts. I do prefer Cage au Sports though. I got their baton rouge burger and it wasn't anything too special but it did satisfy my burger craving. I also got a sangria pitcher to share but I didn't like it at all so my friend kinda drank the whole thing and it was hilarious. I probably wouldn't go back unless i'm invited to this location but it still wasn't a bad night.
/user_details?userid=l133MthZ-NDhxNM-09QMMA,Justin C.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,"We stopped in for evening drinks and a snack. Since they were closing within the hour they let us sit on the patio. Apparently, you need to order food to be on the patio-- but we ordered a snack too because we wanted to  ensure patio seating. Drinks: I ordered the mojito. It was good and sweet, the way they're supposed to be. It was a bit better than the place next door's. Food: We ordered The fried shrimp, as a snack. It was pretty good and pretty simple. It would've been a little better if they threw in some fries but the shrimp was good. About 6 pieces Our server was very nice and sociable. She even recommended a breakfast spot and a place to grab ice cream. Final Word: Cool place for a drink and a snack."

I asked the server how the margaritas were and she said great ...they were very sour and very acidic, wasted money on that too."
/user_details?userid=R76K_BIxuRLoaIXmCqMm5A,Max A.,"Davidson, NC",2 star rating,"Mediocre at best, one of those joints that doesn't leave an impression, it is neither bad, nor good.  It just is....   Based on the reviews, I probably should have gone with ribs.  Regardless, I went with a bone in ribeye,  It was okay, about what you would expect from a $30 US ($39CA) steak. It was just a unimpressive - very thin steak.  In the USA, this would be a typical ribeye orded at Logan's Steakhouse, Outback, Texas Roadhouse, Lone Star, etc........Insult to injury was the sparce blue cheese panko crust ""enhancement"", really tiny amount added --- and I have never seen brown gravy served with a ribeye, Canadian thing?  I dunno, but straight from can to bowl, nasty.     I ordered a side of mushrooms and asparagus.   Both equally bland and disappointing.    As far as the service, awful.  One poor bartender working the bar and surrounding dozen tables ain't going to cut it.   He was working is but off, but could not keep up.  I waited forever for a drink, equally long to get my meal ordered and 20 minutes for my bill."

Service was relatively quick for a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant wasn't too crowded.This Baton Rouge is located inside Complexe Desjardins but the entrance to get inside from within the mall is a bit hard to find due to some construction inside the mall so I entered from the outside on Ste-Caterine Street.Don't really have any complaints about my experience at this Baton Rouge."
/user_details?userid=uIUQqkbMiP51qxSciJWtBA,Steven L.,"Highland Park, NJ",4 star rating,"This was a cool steakhouse restaurant. The menu selections are similar to what you would find at Houlihans or Outback stateside. I was in the mood for a rack of ribs so there was only one choice.  They were fall off the bone as advertised. The bbq sauce was finger licking good, with a healthy side of coleslaw and fries rounded out the meal."
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"For years, it has been my family's favorite steakhouse (three locations, we have been on Sainte Catherine, De La Montagne and Decarie). The restaurant is huge. It has always a cozy feeling. The service always has been good. Never had any issues with any of the staff.Best comfort food. My sisters, one had her all time favorite the chicken tenders with garlic mashed potatoes; and she always asks for the pepper sauce without charge; second sister had Baton Rouge burger, which she devoured it. I had steak and fries which I asked for medium rare. You know what, it was cooked perfectly! Then, three of us, ordered peanut butter brownie cake to share. It was a huge portion; every layer of this cake super delicious. The price is a bit of high though... all steakhouses are... but the food is comfortingly delicious."

Meanwhile another table came in with 6 people they got served very quickly. This was not worth the $. Should have gone to china town"

Not sure how some people are giving this place three stars, our food was delicious and the service was phenomenal. Had the General Tao Salad, the dressing was good, the chicken was tender... loved it! The hubs had the ribs... fall off the bone deliciousness!! What a great place and our first stop on vacation!"
/user_details?userid=eses52EL9PM3Zr98zMpihA,Jad B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"If you like ribs, well this is the right place to be.I tried plenty of restaurants that are specialized in ribs, and I can say that Baton Rouge is one of the best. The ribs are juice and tender. The bbq sauce is perfect. The sweet potato are delicious. The atmosphere is nice, and the place is always crowded during the weekends. In summer, they have this nice terrasse that overlooks on Place des Arts. You can enjoy a nice cold beer !If you do not find a place at the terrasse, i would suggest the table with couch next to windows.In general the service is good over there no complaints so far."
/user_details?userid=Z7xuJ9P_rMtBvi4aFmP7zw,Fouad B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"They have a simple menu. The restaurant decoration is nice, and cozy with warm colors.I consider their BBQ Pork Back ribs as the best in town, with their sweet potato fries."
/user_details?userid=qGUUgvBwc3x144FWYCUEkQ,Brian F.,"Longwood, FL",4 star rating,"Connected to our hotel so I can't evaluate the Parking situation, but we did eat there twice!  We enjoyed the outside dining during the festival which allowed us to people watch.   The first night we decided to try their spin on some mexican appetizers.  FAIL!  Lobster Quesedilla was dry and lacked cheese or anything else.  There were other good items and the wine was good.  We also enjoyed the Creme Brulee and several other desert items.  The waiter turned out to be the same waiter at the restaurant next door. Eggspectation!  I think they are somehow connected, but he was friendly enough and spoke in English when he realized we had no French under out belt.  The next sitting was far more delicious.  Lobster roll, ribs, sweet potato fries were all made well.  Prompt service but the Old Fashioned cocktail wasn't the best I've ever had.  The waiter even looked out for me as I left a shopping bag under my table.  He quickly swooped it up and saved it for me...."
/user_details?userid=iJGsbBdESnVRmS_XY4UIVg,David B.,"Marina, CA",4 star rating,Great atmosphere and service. New items added to the menu that still need refinement. Located in a mall but well staffed. The lobster ravioli was great.
/user_details?userid=bxE4AgxoxMn5_3swjz_vQw,Manu C.,"San Diego, CA",4 star rating,Went there several times and never had complaints about either the food or the service.Meat quality is good and they have a lunch menu with a soup (it's different every day) for a good price. Service is fine. Waiters are always there to respond to any request. One nice thing is that they have a kids menu and also they give kids crayons.Overall this is a nice place if you want to have a good meal for a reasonable price.
/user_details?userid=OD6XWLJABY40qE3lpgw-lg,Jiading F.,"Champaign, IL",2 star rating,"Maybe because I went at noon, this place is mediocre at best. I had top sirloin meal and surprisingly it only comes one mashed potato side, and I have to order another steamed veggies for green. The steak itself is only ok, I missed Taxes Roadhouse for that. And finally it comes with price, the most surprising part. The top sirloin is almost the least priced of all, and it still comes at ~25 CAD, along with the greens (~4) and tax and gratitude, it costs me 46 CAD for a lunch. Maybe you can't call it bad, but that's definitely not worth the money."
/user_details?userid=uw4hqYj64A-vHmxltwJ6cA,Richard L.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,I came here for the beers at happy hour in the bar only. The bartender was friendly and the beer was good and quite reasonable at prices

My experience was indeed a 5-star one. Very nice place, huge round table for the 14 of us, super polite and helpful staff and of course delicious food. My NY Steak (Contre-filet NY) was just medium rare as ordered and went well with the sangria. Good place good company good food what else do i need? I would definitely come back sooon! Before I forget if you happen to be here make sure you try the spinach dip IT IS HEAVENLY!!"

The menu and the food styling is reminiscent of outback, however the food is better tasting. I had the prime rib and it was excellent. There was a long line to get in however they offer free hors d'oeuvres and champagne while you wait."
/user_details?userid=mHW8RaOu3BCw8YMTnLKcVA,Steve K.,"Hudson, Canada",2 star rating,"Chain restaurant so you know what expect but service was Awful, absolutely Awful.watched my beer sit at the bar for 12 minutes waiting for waitress to pick up. Decided to go get it myself."
/user_details?userid=LfMTL6hwfSKemQlz_PN4cg,Mike M.,"Richboro, PA",3 star rating,"Arrived close to 8pm and while the restaurant was full, there was no wait for a table for two. It's a good thing we knew what we wanted, however, as the only available menus were en français. I have a feeling this was due to the high occupancy of the restaurant as we've had English menus at this restaurant previously. We were served quickly, our waiter was polite and efficient.  I ordered a diet Pepsi that was served in a very small glass. If I received a number of refills, that wouldn't have been a problem, but my empty glass was simply whisked away and no refills provided. For $2.95 that's pretty unacceptable. The saving grace for this restaurant will always be is chicken tenders. I've declared them the world's best to anyone who will listen.  They are unique in their heavily applied, yet light and fluffy batter. The actual chicken is tender and juicy and I'm a fan of the accompanying barbecue sauce. Nobody went the extra mile as far as service is concerned. Very mechanical, no concern on refills, etc. This isn't to say the service was bad, it just wasn't great.  But if you order the chicken tender platter you shouldn't be disappointed. Those alone yield an extra star from me."
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Our party of four was seated at a window booth (with a great view of Ste. Catherine St. and Place des Arts, but cool - temperature wise - in winter).I was curious as to what it would be like to eat here again after many years and wondered why the 3 star yelp rating? A few of my observations are as follows in no order of importance;Coleslaw was a bit more creamy and chopped up than I recall. Still one of my fave cabbage based dishes anywhere. Our server asked if we wanted a break between courses, but was hard to find after dessert to settle up the cheque. Note: was not made clear to pay at the table (usually that's done).The manager was very present and helpful when called upon, a very good sign.Two of my go to dishes; the baby back ribs (pretty obvious as they are in so many of their ads and tops in my experience), and the other is their grilled salmon. This time the portion was smaller than I recalled, the veggies were cold (yet still edible) and the garlic mashed potatoes lukewarm. The $1 add-on spicy seasoning was fairly hard to discern. The others in our party all order their famous ribs with or without additions. They did appear, a little less meaty, a little more dry - than years past - but still darn tasty.Honey mustard chicken finger dipping sauce is excellent.The side of (3) grilled Tiger shrimp were plump and cooked firmly.The calamari starter was a little chewy and not a plate-full-portion.The cheddar dip was very rich and flavourful, plus a good appetizer to share.You can get a parking (underneath the restaurant) validation if your bill is over $65 after 5pm and on weekends (please verify the details as they could change).The 6 oz glass of 'Carnivor' Cabernet Sauvignon was super drinkable and at $12 a decent deal - many of their other glasses are $15. Several bottles seemed to be marked at $60 plus tax which I though was a little pricey, yet if the glass is $15...To finish their cranberry red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting was moist, 'delish' and sharable with each an individual fork. In sum, the three star average seems a bit harsh, but to each their own experience and rating...that's for sure."

I wanted steamed veg , so they charged me $2.50, and I got a couple of little sprigs of broccoli. Kind of small and dry. Also had the calamari, which was better . But overall I found this over priced for what you get."

The plates smelled horrendous, the food was so awful we didn't even finish it and asked for the check immediately. We simply tried this place out of convenience and basically were robbed of our time and money. I'm quite sure one of my family members is sick as a result. The ribs are all bone, the marination is not tasty and carries a terrible after taste. The salad was wilted and dry, how awful. We immediately felt bad as we attempted to try the French fries. How is this restaurant even in business ? So disappointing. Wash your dishes ! And learn to cook..."
/user_details?userid=1uI4gOsC8sSM3JS5761mPA,Gina C.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Came on a Saturday at 630. Waited half an hour until we were seated near the bar which was fine. We were just hungry so it didn't matter where we sat.JUST TO SET THE SCENE: by now it's 7pm. Happy Hour is over so the place is not that packed. Empty tables here and there. The waitress gave us our menu and water and left. The menu was in french so we asked her for English ones. She took the French ones and never returned. We waited a good 15 minute until we had to ask the bustboy to get us menus which she did promptly.It took another 15 minute for the waitress to come and take our orders. We got the prime rib and the lobster risotto. The food came out very fast surprisingly.The prime rib was a decent piece. No complaints.The lobster risotto had a good amount of lobster chunks. But holy cow. Why is there corn?! There were more corn then there were risotto. I couldn't taste anything but corn.The waitress filled everyone's cup with water except ours which was clearly empty.  Even the table right beside ours got water! She clearly didn't like English speaking people or Asians. Rude.We finished our meals and waited 20min for her to come and take it away. She offered dessert menu and we waited another 20 minute until she came back and took our order of creme brulee. Once we ordered, she came back so quickly to give us our bill. We didn't even get our dessert yet!The creme brulee was good but nothing special. We hesitated to give her any tip but we're nice people so she still got her 15%. But gosh, this is why I hate french people. She's bringing them all down!OVERALL: food is mediocre. Which sucks for the price that you're paying. Service is horrendous. wouldn't come back again. If you have a choice, opt for the food court downstairs!"
/user_details?userid=eQCfN-JqIwWU1lE9nfbG_g,David S.,"Côte Saint-Luc, Canada",1 star rating,"Just got done being sick for days after eating at Baton Rouge on Fete d'National. You would think on such a day in QC at Place des Arts that they would be serving fresh food. Wrong!We ordered two racks of ribs. Both were old, burnt and dried out. To hide this they were dripping with sauce. Cole Slaw was sour and rancid, a baked potato was cooked so long it was not edible  and the fries were cold and tasteless. When the waiter asked how our meal was I told him that he had served us garbage on a plate. Both were partially eaten and he did wipe the bill. Never again shall we eat at Baton Rouge!"

Clearly Baton Rouge used to be good but as all legends fall, they probably switched their management and food to save money from the decline in popularity. Oh yeah, and the goddamn waiter hassled me for a tip. I'm sorry sir, does your wage not pay you enough to the point where you have to ask for extra money from teenage girls who are clearly just tourists?"

Mine was supposed to be medium, but was well done and the mashed potatoes were Luke warm at best (it was still juicy & tender).  My wife's plate was delivered with no baked potato, only to be told at that time that none were left so she opted for the sweet potatoes which were string cut & lacked flavour.  At least these were served quickly.  The waiter never once asked if anything was to our satisfaction. We know of several places were the value is significantly better and will stick with those."
/user_details?userid=tq0Ue_JdziYKlMJMSL3O2w,Andrew B.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"You may ask yourself when you see this review, ""Hey, why did Andrew give this place only 2 stars?"", well let me answer that. I decided to give this place a try, when a friend and I wanted something to eat at 9pm, we chose the nearest place, because we we're tired. The only regret I have was not checking this place out on Yelp on my phone, if you haven't had the app yet downloaded, go do it. Let me start with the pros, first of all it has a nice little outdoor sitting area looking into Place des Arts. They also had very lovely and helpful staff. These are the only two things I can think about that is positive in my experience at this place. The food could have been better....much better. I ordered the tomato soup which was the soup of the day, it tasted kinda bland. In addition, I had the spinach dip that was, just okay. It wasn't fully disgusting that I would want to stop, it just it could have been better. The servings were just too big, nothing special about the dishes that made me want to go back, it was just...not good. There are better restaurants around, that I would pick over this any day. They didn't have very many vegetarian dishes as well, they had a couple, I would seriously suggest them to beef up their menu with a couple more signature vegetarian dishes. I would say, they should revamp their whole menu, and re-do their dishes to make it stand out. This place has so much potential, I thought it would be good because it was under the Hyatt regency, but I wouldn't go back until they relaunch into something better. So please, take my advice Baton rouge."

I could barely finish even thought I was hungry. The soup is recommended!"
/user_details?userid=exAWpxarik6vghkh9h09yA,Jennifer F.,"Manhattan, NY",2 star rating,"This place has great servers & great spinach dip & sweet potato fries but that's about it. I went here twice in a 3 day period for lunch, as I was staying at a hotel nearby. I tried all 3 salads on the menu and something was definitely off. The chicken seemed undercooked both times & the shrimp was a bit hard. The chicken Caesar salad had way too much pepper. The portions are large but there's more carrots in the dish than anything else so it tasted terrible. No balsamic dressing as an option either ... strange. However, I was part of a group of 15 and those who had burgers and ribs were happy with their dishes, which is why we chose to go back the second time. Perhaps they just have to work on their salads."

Great food, friendly and helpful service.Lightly battered Calamari, Ahi Tuna Salad, New York Strip loin and Ribs-Black tiger shrimps were just gorgeous.Actually, I would put 4.5 stars only because it was a bit noisy, which prevented our communication.

After a walk through Chinatown, which had a restaurant every few feet but none that appealed, I headed to the Quartier des Spectacles, a little more upscale and artsy area, and came upon Baton Rouge. Nice quiet place with 80's music and some French songs playing as well, and Stephane my waiter greeted me promptly in French and in English. I mangled my attempt at French (use it or lose it), so English it was. Special of the day was grilled grouper with fresh salsa, steamed veggies and my choice of side was rice pilaf.   Lots of other steakhouse type offerings on the menu, but the fish got my vote. While the food did not knock my socks off, it was good for the price point and the Italian Pinot Grigio that I had with my meal was really tasty. Solid three stars for the food and I'd give my server Stephane four."
/user_details?userid=vdIo1TmWDe3E_zjDYhMNzQ,Ben H.,"Pioneer Valley, MA",3 star rating,"Nice place. Great burger. Great chips and spinach dip The french fries could be much better.

/user_details?userid=WEAKuClK0BjhjHWGunMXQA,Ann W.,"Northville, MI",3 star rating,"I am always reminded by the similarities between Baton Rouge and J Alexander's. Gleaming hardwoods, massive tables and booths, low lighting, can cause a double-take. While there are also similarities with certain menu items, Baton Rouge offerings tend toward the steak and barbecue route which were popular with guests celebrating friendships and birthdays this holiday weekend.Baton Rouge is always a go-to choice with my friends because of the varied menu. This evening, we started the meal with a crowd-pleaser, the Louisiana Spinach dip. It featured chunks of artichoke hearts, in a creamy cheese and spinach sauce. Sour cream (today's had an odd gummy texture) and salsa are also served with the ring of tortilla chips. Before our meals arrived, we had finished off every chip and polished off every last bit of the dip.For the main course, I had the 10 oz portion of baby back ribs. A 16 oz portion is also available. While the ribs were fall-off-the-bone, fork-tender, they were good, not great; they did not taste as if they were smoked for several hours. Included with the meal is a choice of sides ranging from potatoes to coleslaw to cinnamon apples. I had the latter and they were below average. Instead of sweet, cinnamon apples that were chunky in texture, the apples today were over cooked and mushy.

The service was terrible, taking several minutes for us to be served once seated and numerous issues with ordering. My partner ordered a chicken sandwich and wasn't served it. We had to send back what they had served him (no idea honestly) and wait for his actually order. Surprisingly once he had the correct sandwich it was not terrible tasting despite being at a steak house. I ordered a burger, thinking a steak house could get that right. They forgot my sweet potato fries which was annoying but fine, it happens. Next, I bit into the burger and it was awful and well-done. They had asked how I would like it cooked and I had asked for medium rare. I sent it back. After waiting another several minutes I finally got a new burger. I took a bite and it was even worse, overcooked and terrible with not a single bit of red in the center. What an utter disappointment. They clearly don't know how to cook meat which is odd considering they are a steak house. Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this place."

Located right across the street from the Museum of Contemporary Art and Opera House, we were expecting inflated prices and sub par food. Well, we were only half wrong. You'll notice the warm wood decor and ambiance with an elevate area for large groups or the lively bar for hockey fans. The food is mostly American standard with a bit of a French flair. I had a grilled chicken salad with artichoke, asparagus, bacon, 3 types of cheeses and accompanied with a lemon ginger dressing. My girlfriend had an angus cheeseburger with bacon on a brioche and thinly cut fries. We both enjoyed our food but I did not like that a lemon ginger dressing was cream based rather than vinegar based. The fries disappeared before I could blink.The staff makes it a casual and comfortable place so you can expect to be taken care of. You won't likely be disappointed with what you order but at the same time don't expect to be impressed either."

My husband had been there once before and wasn't thrilled by the food, but as soon as he mentioned crab cakes, I was sold. I grew up on the east coast in the States and seafood was a staple growing up. Unfortunately, that visit will likely be my last. The restaurant is nice. very clean, cozy... great atmosphere and good music. Our waiter was fantastic (I forget his name, though). We had our 2.5 year old son and daughter who was just a few weeks old at the time. I assume because of our kids, we were given a booth on the side of the restaurant in the corner. I enjoyed where we were placed because I didn't have to worry about my kids disturbing other diners and I could nurse my daughter freely without offending anyone. Our son was given crayons and a children's menu to write on... he even received a free scoop of ice cream after his meal. Unfortunately, our food was subpar. My husband ordered the steak, which he had during another dinner date but didn't like. Why he ordered it again, I don't know but at least he learned that the steak was consistently not great. The crab cake that I so craved was just ok. There were more ""other"" ingredients than crab in the cake... typical, and I shouldn't have really expected more, but I did. I enjoyed the calamari appetizer but my husband said the pieces he chose were cold. I ordered the crab risotto (it's usually a lobster risotto but they were out of lobster that day) and I was not pleased. It came with several huge chunks of imitation crab meat. Ugh. For the price of the dish ($25+), I expected real crab... at least some real crab. It also came filled with bright yellow corn (like the kind that comes out of a can or freezer bag and not off the cob) and the rice didn't really seem like arborio. I ate the dish (minus the imitation crab meat), so it wasn't terrible, but I definitely wasn't delicious. I don't recommend it.  Overall, I'd say the restaurant's menu is overpriced for food that's just OK.If you're a steak or seafood lover like my husband and I, you're best to choose a restaurant with a higher quality menu."

Finding the waitress was a bit of a challenge.  And, my dining companion felt that she assumed I was paying, and focused her attention on me while ignoring him.  Getting a seat on Saturday night was quick, and the place inside was fine.  But, it's probably not a place that would easily get a return trip from us."

The waitress told me that lobster shells were used to make the gravy but I had this at another location. Gravy was not used.

The ice tea came in a very small glass probably less than 6 oz. it also tasted like what you get from a Lipton or nestea canned drink which is horrible. At $3 it was not a good value. So I didn't have high expectations for my chicken tenders. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!  The tenders were not dry and came with plenty of fries to complement. It was definitely an above average dish. Kudos on the chicken tenders but thumbs down on the ice tea. Thanks for staying open. Server was also friendly and courteous.

They brought him the burger before we had even gotten our appetizer, and then picked it up again and delivered it to a different table. We weren't super impressed by that. We agreed that if someone else wanted to go we would go again, but never on our own. A couple days later I was meant to go with three friends. Two of the friends happen to use wheelchairs. I had called days in advance to make reservations, asking them to note that we needed a table that could accommodate two people who use wheelchairs. All this means is we can't use a booth, and they need to take away two chairs. Should be easy. We showed up for our six o'clock reservation and were told the only table available could only accommodate one person in a wheelchair, and they wanted the other to leave their wheelchair. We refused and pointed out that they should have reserved a table that could accommodate our party like we requested, or told me on the phone that they are unable to accommodate. We agreed to wait for an available table. At 6:20 they said another table was available, but there were reservations at seven so we had to be done by then. We left and will never be going back.

She made a reservation for 8 people weeks in advance, knowing that it can be hard to get a group table on a Saturday night in the summer time. One of the girls in our group arrived very early in case that would help secure our table on time. It made no difference. We were all forced to wait in a cramped entryway until our table was ready. We were never offered a seat at the bar or anything, but more than once, a pushy waiter asked for our drink orders (without giving us a menu.) All we asked for was water because it was a hot summer day but it took ages for us to get any. Which was fine, because our table - the one we had reserved WEEKS in advance - wasn't ready and they wouldn't tell us why or how much longer we'd have to wait. People without reservations, mostly couples, breezed right past us. Still, no apologies from anyone or promises to seat us soon.

Once seated, I politely asked our waitress to speak to a manager, because I've heard that that's the best way to deal with such problems. She said he was busy but that she would try to send him over. A few minutes later, some clown shows up at our table and says ""Yeah, you wanted to see me?"" So I explained to him what had happened, how long ago we had reserved a table and what time we had reserved it for. He chose to be confrontational. He literally said ""Well, it's a Saturday night in the summertime, downtown Montreal, quartier des spectacles, what do you expect?"" Um, I expect to get a table if we reserved one. That's what reservations are for. He disagreed with me and rudely said ""what can I do?"" ...That was not an offer to salvage my friend's party. It was a way to try to get me off his back. I've seen better customer service at McDonald's. I've met homeless people who were nicer about getting my money. This manager was rude and not at all understanding. The food was underwhelming - too expensive for dishes that Baton Rouge used to do better, and poorly plated at that. The waitstaff, on the other hand, is the only reason this place deserves any stars. Our waitress was friendly and actually NICE to us, and a few other staff members were game to join in on our birthday and bachelorette games without ever making anyone feel uncomfortable. I just wish they didn't have to work in restaurant hell, because they deserve better. If it were socially acceptable, I wouldn't have paid for my meal and instead left a tip equivalent to the price of a lukewarm plate of ribs and a run-of-the-mill sangria."
/user_details?userid=BlcMdwIrZEhPiu8I497LYw,Jennifer G.,"San Diego, CA",1 star rating,This is a chain that is way overpriced with poor to moderate quality food.  The salad with chicken I had was horrible.  My husband's seared tuna seemed rancid. It was a huge waste of money.
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,The food is ok but I think if they were to cut their portions down and cut their prices as well it would be a better value.  I find you get way too much food and end up leaving a huge chunk of it behind.  It's also a little on the pricey side for what it is.  The ribs are pretty good though as is the burger.  I also find the noise level to be too high in this location making it hard to enjoy conversation with your dining companions.

When I complained they told me it was a ""roast beef"" and that this was as good as it gets. Not a good sign for the chef if he cant even cook a prime rib."
/user_details?userid=upvKwLboHJD1XXa7zW0lIQ,Mike F.,"Cleveland, OH",5 star rating,My wife and I came here late Sunday afternoon.  I had the rib steak with the mushroom side and she had the chicken Caesar salad.  Both meals were cooked perfectly and tasted excellent. Our waiter gave us plenty of time to decide and the food came quickly.  We will be back.

A little overpriced for what it is, but it is consistent. It's a good place to go with a big group of people, but honestly for the price you are better off going to a smaller steakhouse in the plateau that has a little more charm. I still give it 4 stars because it really is not bad, it's just kinda standard."

/user_details?userid=BXWKPqnxNxawjrPiuFHRFw,Lawrence C.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",2 star rating,Food was edible. I guess in Canada everyone eats their burgers med well because we were not asked. Veggie sandwich very sparse on veggies and only one side with goat cheese. Early evening and out of sweet potato fries. Food slow to come out of kitchen. Perhaps the barbecue is better but would not return to find out as no redeeming features to make me want to try again.

Every now and then I get in the mood for ribs and this place never really leaves me satisfied. This branch is WAY better than the one on de la Montagne in terms of service. Our waiter was really nice and checked up on us. Ribs were not that great, coke was majorly watered down (i asked the waiter to get me a new one but it was the same deal 2nd time around)."
/user_details?userid=8V6klkcahF59lBHCA-MnhQ,Shar B.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"I'm guessing that given the location of this particular chain restaurant & the previous reviews, that this branch is somewhat of tourist trap.  Well we dined here as tourists during Jazz Fest & have to admit we had a very good experience!  My cheeseburger was absolutely delicious as was my side of sauteed mushrooms.  The one sour note was that yes the prices are exorbitant for what you get.  Sure, we had an excellent meal but I'm guessing most of the waiter-service establishments in this area know that they've got the market covered for people who don't want fast food, & realize they can charge these prices, because people like us will pay 'em.  And we did!  But overall, we were very satisfied with our dinner here."
/user_details?userid=GHHuD-wnMGA7zg-viGD-Ig,Jim W.,"Wilton Manors, FL",5 star rating,Excellent service and very good food.  The best food we've had in Montreal.  We ate dinner on 12/23/10 and lunch on 12/24/10.  I had BBQ pork ribs for dinner and Chicken Tenders for lunch.
/user_details?userid=H2BTd9iaf9Dr8p-uspnDtg,William H.,"Portland, ME",3 star rating,"This place was very pricy for what you get. The homemade chicken fingers were quite good, and a large portion, but the pasta was outrageously expensive for the amount of food. It was a $17 pasta dish and it cost $6 extra to put chicken on it, but there was very little pasta and it wasn't even a normal-sized piece of chicken breast! The beers here were also very expensive, but that seems to be typical of Montreal."
/user_details?userid=YrKKi7No79E0ef7ADvS-Rg,Jeremy B.,"Shakopee, MN",3 star rating,"Disappointed overall. The food was OK, the service was OK, the beer list was pretty sparse, the martini I had wasn't mixed right.  The wait staff is friendly which is why it gets 3 stars from me.  I went out with the same group later in the week and we had an opportunity to go back to the Baton Rouge again for dinner and everyone wanted to go elsewhere."

/user_details?userid=YP5hNfCZruMdByn6Ah6XpQ,Ari S.,"Ottawa, Canada",1 star rating,"In one word: inedible. I generally avoid chain restaurants that feel the need to advertise on television. I didn't want to go but we were meeting some people in the area who were at the Jazz Fest. Unfortunately, this area is largely a black hole for decent places to eat unless you want to venture down to Chinatown.  Because of its convenient location overlooking Place Des Arts, it draws a lot of the tourist/festival crowd and I can only imagine that this is the only way it can stay in business (but that doesn't explain why Baton Rouge is a fairly successful Quebec chain). I've never had worse ""cajun"" food (fake cajun)  from the appetizer nachos that came accompanied with a vile looking and even worse tasting garlic dip to the rubbery ribs, overcooked steaks, dripping-with-grease sandwiches, and soggy french fries. Alas, the food is so bad, it made me regret passing by the St. Hubert chicken place right down the street (which is bad but not THAT bad). The sad thing is: for the same price you can actually eat at a decent restaurant."
/user_details?userid=53qjYo8wC3hYaAR9kxToNw,S C.,"Surrey, Canada",3 star rating,"Food was ok.  Maybe average to slightly above average depending on the item.  But the price seemed a little steep.  It could be that I'm still not totally used to the higher price of food in Montreal compared to the US, but still, it seemed a little too much for the quality.  I went there because someone else picked the restaurant, but I'd probably try to avoid this place in the future."
