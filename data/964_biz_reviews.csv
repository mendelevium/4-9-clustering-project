However, I wished there would be more filling in the tacos. I also took the sopa de tortilla (soup of tortillas) and it was so good! The avocado and the fried tortilla made it so delicious!"

/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Got some of their food from ubereats. The fish and el pastor tacos were great. The cactus and the mushroom tacos were also not bad. The nachos was perfectly crunchy and the guacamole on it was very creamy and flavorful.
/user_details?userid=CtBx4yk_QM8ClITgw94TPQ,Simon P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Tacos Frida is in my opinion one of the best tacos restaurant in Montreal. I have a few favorites, their fish taco and the conchinita, but honestly all are good. Prices are fair, tacos are delicious (I eat about 6 as a big man) and the service is great.Something else that's great about Frida: family packs for take out during covid. It's about 40$ for 15 tacos. An excellent value!"
/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here on Valentine's Day because I wasn't interested in the expensive set menus that seemed to have taken over at every fancy restaurant. Upon walking in, I was greeted by a friendly waiter and immediately felt a good vibe being there.We started with the small guacamole which was delish. The portion was perfect for a starter. Next time I will ask for it without cilantro though because I found it a bit overpowering.We ordered a variety of tacos (tinga, beef, pastor, cochinita) and also tried a quesadilla. At least for the quesadilla, they don't make their own tortillas so I subtracted a few points for that. We liked everything we tried. I especially liked the sauces in the side. They were spicy but had great flavour beyond just heat.The few downsides was that they didn't have any churros left when we tried to order dessert. They also didn't refill our waters.Overall, prices are good, food tasty and service friendly. Their brunch looks awesome also. Looking forward to coming back and trying it!"
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"In the heart of Saint Henri , a colorful Mexican restaurant offers a simple menu with delicious food.The restaurant has colorful walls; at the cash few paintings of Frida, the famous Mexican artist. The big wall has the wall paint of a Lucha Libre wrestler. The cash counter looks like a mini depanneur, where you can buy various drinks, candies, chocolates, cans and jars of food.  Of course, the restaurant doesn't have the vibe of being a restaurant only; it has a busy feeling with the line up at the cash and running restaurant service. The service is good and super quick. I tasted the most delicious guacamole after long long time with great tortilla chips. Got some Mexican drink Jarritos, flavors of guava and sangria. Delicious! For the main dish I had mushrooms/peppers quesadilla. By itself, the taste is bland but with jalapeños sauce, it got excellent kick. My sister enjoyed her tinga (chicken) tacos.In the end, I have to go to the counter to make the payments. Recommended!"

Not bad but sometimes I like my guac a little simpler. To really get the authentic taco experience you must try the pastor tacos.  It's deliciously grilled and topped with fresh cilantro and onions.  Runner up would be the fish taco.  I found the tinga ok and cochinita tacos to be a bit too oily."
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"We were meeting up with M for dinner and let her choose the spot: Mexican! She picked Tacos Frida, which I've never been to. It's close by to two other Mexican places (Victor Tacos and Le Tequila Bar) so lots of nearby competition. We dropped in on an early Wednesday evening (around 6:15pm). The place wasn't too busy but by 7:00pm, it was packed. The inside is cutely decorated and even has a mini grocery aisle for you to buy some Mexican goodies (chips, tortillas, candies, etc.).The menu is limited but that's good. Starters, tacos & quesadillas, specials, breakfast/brunch (only till 3:00pm), traditional, dessert and drinks. They also have a taco combo and plate of the day combo that seemed the best bang for your buck. Tacos themselves are reasonable ($2.75 to $3.50 per taco).Service was very friendly, patient and genuine. They were on the ball while things were slow but once it got busy, it was hard to get any drinks refilled. Go up to the counter to pay when you're done. - Paloma ($10.00) - M's cocktail made from tequila and grapefruit soda with salt around the rim. - Sauces - they bring over two containers (roja and verde) of sauces. Both were tasty. Red sauce had a slight more heat to it.- Promo FRIDA! ($10.89) - M went with two mushroom and one cochinita taco. She said the cochinita was decent (but a tad dry). Her preference was the mushroom tacos.- Promo FRIDA! ($10.89) - the taco combo comes with a small tortilla soup which had bits of avocado and sour cream. Good but a tad salty. We opted for the carnitas, chorizo and nopales tacos. First time trying grilled cactus; not too shabby. The chorizo was tender and flavourful. Carnitas were tasty but a bit dry. - Plate of the day ($12.00) - you choose your meat (cochinita) with tortillas, salad, black beans, rice and guacamole. Good presentation but again, the pork was dry. Guacamole was fantastic along with the salad. Unfortunately, the black beans were incredibly salty. Blah.Decent Mexican food but I need to try the other taco spots in St. Henri to compare."
/user_details?userid=xg_96kkO-lF9oCc1PzrQgA,Leo L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I came here with a couple of friends to try some of that good ol' Mexican food and I have to say this caused me mixed feelings. Tacos Frida, you think this place will be guaranteed. Not so fast.Pretty décor, quick and efficient staff, and they are moved with extreme politeness. We were off to a good start. Later, the Michelada and the Margaritas were prepared with love. Hands down, the best ones I've tried in Montreal. So, you can imagine we were smiling, giggling and enthusiastic.We ordered the Chilaquiles and the Plate of the Day (with carnitas). If those chilaquiles had a feeling they would've been heartbroken. The plate devoid any texture, flavor and spirit. Those chilaquiles are going to be easily forgotten. The Plate of the Day was ok, but it was uninspiring. The carnitas were also lacking something, like flavor. I had some pastor tacos, and those were by far the most depressing tacos I had in Montreal. They were as melancholic as Frida's ""Two Frida's"" painting. Pretty different from what I perceived with the energetic staff and their prodigious drinks.  Maybe I was here on a bad day. Who knows?By the end you have to make a line in the middle of the tables in order to pay. I think they should solve this issue because standing there while dogging waiters and costumers, and almost leaning over someone else's table can be troublesome.I came here expecting good Mexican food, some of that real experience but it all ended in a silent ""meh"" and an ordinary food coma."

The restaurant decor & atmosphere is very casual you almost feel like you're hanging out at a friends house but In the best way. I ordered three tacos (al pastor , beef , fish taco). Each one was simple yet so packed with flavour and only 2.50$ each ! the staff was very friendly and checked on me regularly. I really enjoyed this place it has such a friendly  neighbourhood vibe and really great food and great prices ! I can't wait to come back and try more of their food . I really recommend this place for taco fan !"
/user_details?userid=Y6JhHLPzBZ6Z5cHS1s-B4w,Rojarra T.,"Lachine, Canada",5 star rating,"By far, Tacos Frida has the tastiest, most authentic tacos that I've tasted outside of Mexico. For the longest time, two of my colleagues sang this restaurant's praises. They kept pushing me to try it, and finally I did. Hands down, it's now my favourite taco spot in the city!If you're expecting a fine dining experience with all the bells and whistles - this isn't the place for you. However, if you're looking for an authentic mom and pop experience, with warm and friendly staff, this is it.Between myself and the other guest in my party, we tried nearly everything on the menu. Though everything was tasty, my absolute favourite was the El Flaco, Smoked Grilled Beef Oaxacan style w/ guacamole and cheese. The beef was tender and bursting with flavour, and the guacamole was some of the best that I've ever had. This dish was definitely a flavour explosion - in the best possible way, of course! Also, you must try the Hibiscus Margherita - trust me.Oh, and the price is unmatched and unbeatable. There were 4 of us. We ate until we couldn't eat anymore, and two of us had cocktails. Including tax and tip, the total bill  was well under $100."
/user_details?userid=veFSHTJ9O3GoP0KhqXyfCA,Claudio S.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"The best taco place I have found in 15 years living in Montreal! Enough said. You will find REAL everyday mexican tacos, what are known in Mexico City as 'tacos de guisados', my favorites: tinga and nopalitos. Plus they have traditional mexican breakfast items as chilaquiles. Always a very good option and not expensive at all. Congrats to the team!From a Chilango."
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This small informal venue in St Henri serves authentic Mexican grub. The smell alone when you walk in will make you want it all! I ordered the cactus tacos and washed them down with a mandarin jarritos soda. The filling of those tacos was delicious; perfectly cooked and flavoured, these tacos were the real deal! At 2.50 each, you just can't beat it! The service was extremely friendly and attentive. The informal setting, with forks and napkins from a bucket, and the minimally decorated, simple table and chair setting, makes for a real fri badly neighbourhood restaurant. You can always grab goods to go as they also offer a mini grocery where you can pick up everything from Mexican candy to canned cactus. The homemade guacamole seems to be a big hit with several walk-ins asking for a container to go!"

It was Thursday evening so I didn't make a reservation but the place was full  so I think for the weekend you might want to.  The big guacamole came with homemade tortilla chips and it was delicious. We also ordered a lime margherita, which was the best margherita I've ever had! It was strong, well mixed, refreshing and had a nicely balanced salt mix on the rim of the glass. I would have ordered 2 more but at $10 each I decided to be reasonable. We ordered the fish taco, cochinita, Al Pastor and carnitas. All the pork tacos were excellent! The fish was good too but it didn't stand out. The fried batter on the fish was just ok, not airy or fluffy like other places. I really enjoyed this place, as we were leaving there was. A huge line for takeout, which is a great option! Overall, if you are in St-Henri, definitely eat at Tacos Frida but if you are able to get to Jean-Talon, lke it's name, El Rey del Taco is still the king."

I've been told that this one was opened before the other one. Here, tacos shines. The menu is sweet and short. Nothing too complicated but oh so so good! They also serve breakfast until 3 pm and their guacamole is lovely! The service is super friendly and fast. I really love their green salsa. I even bought some home. A small container (250ml) will set you back 3$ lolAn order of tortilla soup, guacamole and four tacos will cost about 24$ taxes included. Pretty good prices if you ask me.

/user_details?userid=UirqnjnmN1CLusITMx7Dhw,Dyson L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Let's get this straight: Mexican tacos are typically soft, not crispy like what you'd get at our neighbor's Taco Bell.I enjoyed my first visit to this cute restaurant. My order was a takeout. The staff was friendly and service was fast (it was outside of busy hours). I ordered the mushrooms, cactus and pulled pork tacos.  I liked all three. The cactus one was pretty spicy but I like spicy food.  The wrap was soft and the filling was ample and tasty.  They give you two sauces on the side. There is really nothing to complain about. It's honest and unpretentious food -- a healthy fairly-priced meal. Compared to all the fancy taco joints popping up here and there in Montreal, this modest but warn and cozy restaurant is a welcome difference."

Guacamole is amazing, with a lot of tomatoes and onions and cilantro. The side of guac and chips seemed a bit pricey at first but I had enough guac leftover from it to put it on my 3 tacos. Tacos were great, tortillas were warm and even slightly crispy. At $2.75 per taco, they were amazing. I had the carnitas, pastor, and the fish taco while my coworker had the carnitas, chicken and fish. We both agreed the fish was a little overdone but the rest were excellent. Her fave was the chicken and mine was the carnitas. Quick service and a comfortable, casual eatery!"

The menu is simple, and the flavours are complex and wonderful. I had two types of quesadillas: Cecina (smoked and grilled Oaxacan beef) and Tinga (chicken slow-cooked with tomatoes, chipotle, and onions). Both had wonderful and well-developed flavors with a mild level of heat (sauces are on the table for those who like hotter food). I also had home made guacamole, which had lots of fresh ingredients (cilantro, red onions, and diced tomatoes). My meal was delicious, and the service was excellent. The atmosphere is very casual.

Upon my little sister's reccomendation, I've decided to give it a try. Good: Very inexpensive tacos at $2.50, that's for sure. We ordered a special on the menu (3x tacos plus a soup). Since I don't eat meat, I've opt for the mushroom tacos and the cactus tacos and my sister picked the beef one. I enjoyed the mushroom one the most and that was kind of it. Bad: The nacho soup was strange...it just looks like a cup of oily broth/sauce that just did nothing for my appetite. It tasted as strange as it looked. I just ate the nacho plain. The cactus taco was too soft for my liking (I've had it once at 7 Lives in Toronto, so I thought it was be similar but I was a bit disappointed). Bottom line: There are better taco places in Montreal like La Capital. If I am feeling stingy, I might come back here but it is not my first go-to."

Tacos come with your choice of spicy or mild sauce. The cactus taco is yummy and worth trying. Small portions but for $2.50 a taco, it's worth it. The only one I didn't like was the fish taco... I didn't like the flavour. With the other authentic Mexican restos in the area, this one is 3rd on my list after Lupita's and Tacos Victor."

Worth it as we have one child and he loved that it was soft and easy to eat.  We also ordered the chicken, beef and cochinita tacos and though they were all quite delicious, my favourite was definitely the fish one.  Other reviewers ordered the guac and so I thought we'd give it a try.  It was also just as others have said.  Probably one of the best I've tried.  Not too much seasoning and can taste the freshness of the ingredients.  It was an added bonus that our son loved to dip the chip and lick off the guac... yup... it was that good.  :)"
