A M B I A N C ETrendy, new Dragon Ball Z inspired Asian-tapas restaurant is perfect for any occasion! After work drinks with colleagues, or a cute romantic date night! Such a cool spot! They just opened their terrace in the back! You have to check this place out!C L E A N L I N E S SVery clean and smells great! The front looks so modern and new, bathrooms are cool, and the terrace is great too!O V E R A L L   Q U A L I T YF O O DWe ordered the: Salmon Tartare Kipik (spicy), Skewer Lollipops, Gua Bao Burgers and Siu Mai #5. Everything was delicious in its own way! The tartare was a little bit spicy, we couldn't order the beef one because of my nut allergy. The skewer lollipops were alright, they came with a pesto sauce which made my pine nut allergy nervous so I didn't try it The Gua Bao Burger steamed buns were compared to but better than Satay Brothers, in my opinion. They were bigger that makes me happy. And the burger/bun kept its form while eating it! Siu Mai #5 was super tasty. We ordered a second helping after the first, hehe. Basically it's like a inside out dumpling, very tasty. Recommend eating with a spoon and drinking all the juice that comes with it!D R I N K SI ordered the Kaioken Cider, was awesome! It said it came with little berries, which I was disappointed it did not. My boyfriend ordered a beer... It was good. My best friend ordered a Los Tres Bandidos, she said it tasted very smoky, which she liked!C O S T~$25-30 per person for food + Cocktails ~$11-27W A I T   T I M E SThe wait took some time between ordering and getting our food. But not too long. You're able to have good conversations out on the terrace as it's elevated and not at street level. P A R K I N GStreet parking available but you can easily take an Uber or Taxi! L O C A T I O NThe whole area is under construction because of condos! Go check this place out ASAP!H E L P F U L   S T A F FAny of the owners are awesome people.

They have a cool list of cocktails and interesting tapas options. I wasn't super hungry but the waitress told us that for a meal, we would need 2-3 dishes each. I ordered the Harajuku girl cocktail which was super fruity and sweet. I thought for a second that I had ordered a mocktail because you couldn't taste the alcohol at all. If you like strong drinks, I wouldn't choose this one, but I was happy with it. I also ordered the Zhajiang gnocchi which I found very original. It was gnocchi with minced pork and arugula on top. There was a bit too much arugula for my liking but to be honest, I'm not the biggest arugula fan. My friends both ordered the Karaage bowl which they enjoyed but I thought there were more unique options on their menu than that.Service was very friendly and the atmosphere was trendy and upscale. Prices were standard for the area. I would definitely come back!"

We both love trying new places so we gave it a shot and were pleasantly surprised. I had the fried chicken bao which came with a cabbage and was good, but not hearty enough by itself. Luckily it comes with fries now. My friend got the salmon bowl and he loved it. Since then we've been back several times and I've enjoyed pretty much everything I've had. Their poutine week poutine with siu mai was great (amazing sauce ) and the ramen special they've had recently is perfect. Veal tartare + fries is salty and tasty. Everything is just a few dollars more expensive than I'd like it to be, especially because I always want to try a cocktail but they're as much as the lunch entrees! I splurged once and enjoyed the mule with pear sake. It's a nice space and the bartender at lunchtime is the sweetest. I'd like to check it out in the evening sometime."

The cocktails were cute and tasted delicious. Regularly priced for the area. Tapas also tasted good but need a lot to get full, so I don't recommend going on an empty stomach as it will get ecpensive. More of a date type place or going for cocktails with friends when in the old port."

The decoration is nice however was disappointed to see only a small poster of bulma although it is bulma bar.My friend had a cocktail that came in a small glass with a HUGE block of ice which meant only a few sips of the actual drink.I had 2 different beers which i both disliked as it tasted very sour.
/user_details?userid=Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"What a great find! I loved my first (but not last) visit here. I started with the Harajuku Girl cocktail...and then kept them coming all night. They are that good and I highly reccomend it if you like soju. Then we ordered a number of dishes to share. The stand out was the Ribs with Banana Ketchup, and I also loved the Gua Bao Burger with Foie Gras. The ribs were slightly sweet and moreish, I could have eaten all of them myself. The burger had different textures and the flavors popped. We tried the Spicy Salmon Tartare which was good, but not life changing. The ZhaJiang Gnocchi was the last dish and they were the least impressive - sorry! Everything else I'd order again. I'd also like to try some of their other drinks. The ambience was on point with really good music. I'll be back one day!"
/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Very cool bar with unique drinks and food options. They're great for groups or casual night outs. Although 5a7 food options are usually snack size, the portions could be enhanced. I ordered some bowl which was essentially very small pieces of fried chicken with a dipping sauce. I found that for $7, it is a bit pricey for what it was (considering the portion size).The drink that I ordered was really good. I came here with multiple coworkers and everyone got a different drink. They all looked unique and seemed quite tasty. Can't wait to go back and try another one. As for the atmosphere, it was a super chill and relaxing vibe. There was some music playing, not too loud which was nice. The waiters/waitresses were all very attentive and helpful.I would recommend this bar to anyone looking to go out for a couple nice drinks, wether it be with a significant other or some friends. Very cool and unique atmosphere."

/user_details?userid=Ae_0lIZoV_dszM4yWXyTjA,Matthew B.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"I sat at the bar solo and chatted to the bartender and part owner Brandon, what a great guy! My first two drink choices they no longer had but he asked me what I enjoyed and created a custom cocktail for me which was delicious. The food was excellent, especially the ribs. Banana Ketchup ribs sounds like the strangest combination until you try it; but then again all new concepts sound crazy at first. The Gua Bao burger was above average but nothing to write home about (slightly too chewy) and the Shrimp Po'boy was delicious and had a small spice kick to it. Overall the place had a great vibe with a wide variety of demographic enjoying their food and drink. After speaking with Brandon it's clear that he cares deeply about his job, the bar and the people's experience and he'd do anything to make sure you had a good time. Make sure you get down to Old Montreal and check this place out..."
