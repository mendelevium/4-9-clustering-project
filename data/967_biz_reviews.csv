We were able to get a table here right away. The decor and ambiance was really cute. The coffee was really good, and so were the Cesars. I also really enjoyed the foie gras skillet thing. We did have to ask twice for water, but other than that the service was pretty quick."

We started with the escargot, which was a perfect starter. It wasn't the absolute best I've had, but for the price definitely worth it! For lunch we split the cured meat board and poutine. It was a lovely way to spend the afternoon, without going overboard. I'd definitely go back!"
/user_details?userid=NZMcnwHhSNqDjUdABIeUcg,Nicole L.,"Gatineau, Canada",3 star rating,The section I was in was uncomfortable because the tables were placed ridiculously tight together so getting in or out or if someone else needed to get by meant someone had to get out of their seat.  It got old real fast.Food was fine but not exactly memorable.Service was pretty good.

We thought we'd be disappointed but everything about this place was great!I ordered a fresh juice which had grapefruit, strawberries and hint of banana. It was filling and tasty! We also ordered a few omelettes for the table between the 6 of us.Service stands out at this place and the staff and servers are very friendly, attentive and welcoming. Food too, was absolutely excellent."

/user_details?userid=iqwxXbFVDxeP-1bKShBgJw,Enrique G.,"Yonkers, NY",1 star rating,"If you are a foreigner, please stay away from this place. We were ripped off by an old French server. She added more items to the bill than what we actually had. She did not want to show us our itemized receipt. We had about $70 of food but she needed up charging us about $90. I asked if gratuity was included and she said no. I asked her my ticket several times but she would never show me. This place isn't even that good service sucks and food is not even okay. This place needs to hire honest employees."

The sandwiches come on house baguette, we loved the smoked meats, and the croque sandwiches were perfectly cooked. Highly recommend this place for brunch, lunch, and even dinner. Pleasant atmosphere, super fast food service, and the dessert variety (lots of cheesecakes) is always excellent! Good variety for the family/group stopping in. Enjoy!"
/user_details?userid=X0ff1SJD8Xvxa2p-BNyq7g,Cachie G.,"Silver Bluff, Miami, FL",4 star rating,"I was skeptical when we came here after the line at O&G was 45 minutes. To our surprise, the service was outstanding. Our server was very attentive and recommended the lemon pie (AMAZING) for dessert. I also had the Nutella crepe with berries and banana and it was also great (just not as good as the pie). Classic poutine was delicious, though I do wish I had also ordered the French Onion Soup because it looked amazing as it passed by. My husband and mom ordered the ham and goat cheese crepe which they couldn't stop raving about from how good it was! My father ordered the ham & cheese sandwich on French baguette and he also said it was great! Super meaty and cheesy (keep in mind it's a cold deli meat sandwich, not pressed or warmed). The grilled chicken sandwich with spicy mayo wasn't spicy at all, but very tasty. Overall, I was very pleased with our experience. it's a quaint little place with a very rustic, French atmosphere. Definitely recommend if you're visiting from out of town!"
/user_details?userid=R9YKpPY0Q4LMxF_muYjY1g,Uyen V.,"Houston, TX",3 star rating,"Food is good but a bit on the salty side. We ordered the assiette de villette, which comes with a variety of charcuterie, including duck confit, and fromage AND the smoked meat sandwich. Bradley had the Belgian waffle with chocolate and fruit - the chocolate (I think it was Nutella) was delish, but the waffle was dry and hard. The service was also lacking. We were seated immediately and given a menu, but it took almost 15 minutes, and a whole lot of looking around, before a waiter came to take our order. When it was all said and done, it took another 10 mins and 2 trips to the register to check out, because the girl at the register told me I had to wait for my bill before I can pay and then another waitress told me the bill was waiting for me at the register. Go figure...Given the not so great review above, if you're wondering why I'm giving the place 3 stars, it's because of the setting/ambience. It's a very cute, quaint spot."
/user_details?userid=caXrh7lsOZKYSr4iz8I3aQ,Tanya L.,"Ottawa, Canada",2 star rating,"Positives: no line, fast service, amazing interior design, nice atmosphere, delicious food, beautifully served dishes. Negatives: we got a bottle of water that was not replaced or refilled during our meal, we got croissants with coffee first (it was our dessert), then immediately after we've got all our food, so coffee was getting cold while we were eating. Plates were not removed, so the table was crowded. There were like no service at all aside from asking what we want to order."

Washed it down with a cheval blanc beer.  Everything was perfect! The staff was very attentive and personable. We couldn't have asked for a better meal for our first night in Montreal. Merci!"

/user_details?userid=KiAnPohnbVZ3pWWe-U_tww,Hannah M.,"Manassas, VA",2 star rating,"I came here for lunch because the restaurant across the street I wanted to go to was crowded. The french onion soup was weak and had no flavor and the quiche that came with it you wouldn't even know there was ham in it. There was nothing special about the smoked meat poutine, it was average. I did have a really good waffle with chocolate sauce and berries but the portion size was so extremely small that I finished my meal in less than 5 minutes. I was not impressed at all with this meal and it was expensive for what was served."

While the prices are average for the area (high), they delivered on tasty, classic French food without being an overly fancy experience.I went for the smoked meat sandwich, which was great and not too greasy. I could have eaten much more of the meat since it tasted so good. It's also worth giving a shout out to the small but tasty side salad (if you can believe it), as it was a great compliment to my meal.Not many beers to choose from but found something that was refreshing on a hot day.Pay up at the counter.Probably not something I would have picked just walking by, but I am glad we had a meal here."

/user_details?userid=59GSwMflQFllOAWvw0F5mw,Dana K.,"Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, CA",1 star rating,"Ugh the ugly one star...if the shoe fits... As my mom said ""why would I give them any stars"".I was starving and looking for a place to eat in Montreal. Apparently the starving feeling is a bit of the norm. While walking around we found this cute French restaurant. The decor was lovely and they were serving breakfast all day. I ordered an egg white omelette with vegetables and my mom ordered a tuna sandwich. Most importantly when I ordered I told him I was ALLERGIC to onions and to please not put any on my food. I even asked him to clarify what vegetables were in the omelette. He said they wouldn't put any onions in it. I also asked for some toast with my omelette but he stated they didn't have any toast and could provide a baguette instead. When he handed me my plate their were tons of onions on my salad. I looked down at my plate and he said ""so you want them to remake it. He wasn't very nice about it but I said no it's ok. I figured I could pick the onions off the salad since they were big. However, when I started to eat my omelette it was filled with onions. I had to take them all out and unfortunately got sick. (Onions inflame my intestines) Good thing I had my medication with me.Our waiter wasn't very friendly and we never saw him after he brought our food. So I was anxious to pay the bill and get out of there. I asked for the bill but he never came, so I just went up to the register and asked her to ring me out. She told me it was $42 and I thought that was a lot but I just paid.  Our bill was $42 and with tip I was over $50 for an omelette, baguette, and a tuna sandwich (not very big).  I know I was nice to leave a tip! Later once I arrived home from my vacation I saw the receipt from our lunch. They charged me $13 for the baguette. Shame on them! My mom mentioned later to me that she had told our waiter there were onions in the food and his response was ""I told her they would remake it"". Um yeah, I have no idea there was a bucket load of onion in my omelette too! We thought he meant they were going to remake my salad since it was covered with onions. To say the least, there are endless choices of French restaurants in Montreal, so we will not be back!"

/user_details?userid=J4fowZaEx8buMsEPDGFBHw,Sergei I.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,We spotted this place randomly as it was located near our hotel and we were meeting a family of four for lunch. Not easy to seat 6 as quickly as they did but they pulled it off within 10 minutes.The interior is all but one big room but it has a quaint and local feel to it. French music in the background added to the ambience.Our food was excellent as was the service. Only one drawback: no mulled wine which would have been great to take the chill out and raise the spirits even more than the good food and atmosphere did.
/user_details?userid=QiciohgD8N6vCty4vGL3pQ,Emily H.,"Louisville, KY",3 star rating,"I had walked to his area of Old Montreal to try out Olive & Gourmando, which had closed for a vacation. Whomp whomp. And hungry, I was done in by ""charcuterie"" on the window and the dried meats hanging in the front of the restaurant. I could tell that it was a bit of a tourist trap -- I was in Old Montreal, after all -- but it just looked so inviting.I wish I would have listened to my instincts and to Yelp instead of my grumbling tummy.I mean, it was just OK. (Considering I only had a few precious days in Montreal, each experience counted.)I ordered the ham crepe. It had asparagus, gruyère cheese, egg and bechamel sauce, with sliced apples on top and a side salad. The ham was tough. In my attempt to cut it, my fork accidentally slid across my plate and onto the floor. Which brings me to a big reason why I'm only giving three stars. The serving was definitely lacking. The waitress was curt and was in such a rush that she dropped my plate on my table in passing. I don't think she slowed down on her trip down the aisle by my table, and I was surprised that my plate didn't end up in my lap. After waiting about 5-10 minutes for the waitress to pass by my table again, so that I could ask for a new fork, I finally asked a nearby diner to pass me a fork from an unused place setting on his table. It was a bit cramped, and the waitress seemed eager for me to finish up and release the table, from her attitude on her last visit to my table. But on the brighter side, this meant that I got my food quickly. It seems like there are better restaurants in the area, so if I ever visit Montreal again, I'll try some other place instead of a return trip here."
/user_details?userid=LzUm_7NoJBkv_y7ywjwOlw,Eunice I.,"Quincy, MA",5 star rating,"Awesome! Liked the look of this place. It is dimly lit and has a lot going on. Think trinkets, signage, and assorted condiments lining the walls, but it seems to work. Each of us got a different sandwich and shared a white sangria pitcher. The white sangria was so crisp, soothing and refreshing and I wish I could have drank more of it. The sandwiches are more than filling, although I found the bread to be a bit hard. What I liked most, though, was just being left alone. My friends and I probably spent almost two hours there and we never felt rushed or unattended. It was a good balance of just being able to relax and enjoy the atmosphere."
/user_details?userid=_RFOFsPSWICK0vbqNg5NpQ,Sourivone V.,"Queens, New York, NY",4 star rating,This place drew us in due to the cuteness of the decor and Parisian music. We did not have to wait long. The service was excellent! We ordered drinks - white sangria and beer. We had a large breakfast  so we only wanted to get the french staples! We ordered the escargot and a mixed meats and cheese plate.Escargot- $9 highly recommend one of the best we ever had! So cheesy and lots of delicious garlic oil with parsley. Meats + cheese plate - we added foie gras so it was about $30! Wonderful we could not finished and took it to go and has it as snack later with some wine in our hotel room!This can very well look like a tourist trap as it is in old Montréal.  However we found ourselves enjoying our time here and really taking in the French Canadian cuisine.  We were seated close to the back area. The only thing that bothered me was my eyes due to the smoke so the ventilation needs to be better.

/user_details?userid=SMlpaWaTPVEeO1lVPezo-w,Andrea C.,"Braeswood Place, Houston, TX",1 star rating,"Let me begin by saying this...this was the one of the worst eating experiences I've ever gone through. My boyfriend and I were walking around Old Port exploring brunch options & stumbled upon this spot. The location itself is visually inviting and the menu looked decent so we decided to try it out. For starters, the service was absolutely abysmal. It took our waitress at least 10 minutes to get our drink order - she did not bring us utensils, water, or napkins. We noticed that the prices were disproportionate to the items on the menu ($15 for a cheese sandwich - like what?), but we assumed the end result would be worth it. We both ordered iced coffees, which tasted like Keurig-grade coffee that was diluted with ice cubes. I also ordered a juice - marketed as ""freshly squeezed"" on the menu - which was 100% purchased from the nearest drugstore. Now for the food....my boyfriend ordered a prosciutto sandwich & I ordered the egg casserole listed on their specials. I am borderline allergic to mushrooms and nowhere on the menu noted that the casserole is 50% mushrooms, 40% soggy fries, & 10% over cooked eggs. The prosciutto sandwich was a slice of prosciutto slabbed onto a stale baguette with an overbearingly thick layer of Dijon mustard - how is this worth $15? Aside from the service and food being terrible, our bill came out to be exorbitantly expensive for absolutely no reason.  We have no problem picking up a higher tab, but for food that is actually worth it.There are so many reasonably priced, delicious restaurants in Montreal -- don't waste your time, efforts, and money on this one."

I wanted to take my group which included (daughter and sons of the deceased) for a breakfast before the long day started... Looked at yelp reviews and I figured this was one of the highest rated restaurants in the area... we were one of the first guests to come here that morning... from the moment we sat here, the server started treating our group of 6 people like rubbish.... we asked for plain water and salt... he said we are too demanding.. . ended up ordering our food anyway.. as we had already seen worse on the death of our loved one... . my aunt dropped her fork so she asked for another one... and the server was again frowning and murmering words inside his mouth... most of us didn't end up eating anything... and left our food in the plates... when we were ready for the cheque, the server asked if we would like to eat the remaining papers and trash or should he clean up.??? (what a racist...) I told him ""thanks, may be you will like it."" and asked for the bill... he asked my aunt to come back in the kitchen with him so she can help with the dishes...

For instance, my son's croissant had bits of celery and mine had a smear of pastry cream. We both ordered a plain croissant with butter and jam. My husband and other son ordered a croissant that came  with a drizzling of chocolate plus a couple of blueberries and one strawberry cut up. They paid almost $15 each for this which seemed excessive. Our family voted this the biggest rip off of our entire trip. Of note, we also had come to the area to go to the cafe/restaurant located catty corner and the wait time being two hours decided that it wasn't worth it. We ended up back the next day at the original reason for venturing into this area and ate at the original intended restaurant. It was delightful.

Little I knew i won't get to taste it but will have probably one of the best croque madames created. From the entrance till exist it's a cozy feel without any snootiness. It's not your froFro fancy white table restaurant but it's nothing short of class in a warm way.Their food smells and tastes of freshness. Of course you can't beat the location. It just can't get more Parisian alike than this area. Right in the heart of old Montreal it's away from the touristy area yet not too quiet. Very good for people watching.Generous portions, especially the skillets, and not at all pricy. You'll definitely leave satisfied. The server who we were lucky to have two days in a row, was very friendly and took his time to explain the menu. Being such a gem of a place you'll expect lots of people and since they don't take reservations you might have to wait a bit. But if you get there before 11am you'll easily get a table.Just do yourself a favor. When in Montreal give your taste buds a culinary treat and enjoy their brunch. You'll be glad you did."

The place had a lovely vibe to it, and a perfect spot for lunch. I was just by myself and found this place to be enjoyable. The waiter was friendly and explained the menu and I opted to go for the charcuterie- a plate of mixed smoked meats, sausage, salami and two cheeses. The taste was delicious, and the food was ample. It felt as though I was in france. I was impressed by the style and ambiance of the restaurant, the quality of the food, and the price was not bad either.

I had the Quiche Lorraine which came with fresh fruit. I expected a piping hot, cheesy gooey, eggy fluffy and crispy bacon quiche. What I got was a lukewarm, egg dry, cheeseless, cube ham (yuck) filled flakeless pie crust. At least they were light on the salt.  But it was not fresh, almost tasted like it was frozen or sitting out too long. Maybe other menu choices were better. Just don't order the Quiche!Sadly, the fresh fruit was the only sweet part of my lunch. The decor is kitschy French; nice touch. There's was a line and the wait was about 20 mins.;not bad considering it was Saturday early afternoon.I recommend other eateries to try as there are plenty of choices within walking distance.This was our 2nd choice since the wait at Olive and Gourmando was about an hour. Both were recommended by a local tour guide. Maybe Olive and Gourmando wouldn't been worth the wait. At least next time I know!"

/user_details?userid=9UCEwWtZL_uWQEUogaXfEw,Michael N.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"Decided to try this place out while in Old Montreal because of the decorations. Needless to say that it was a particularly special atmosphere for a tourist that was very pleasant and felt like I was in the heart of Paris. All of the service was friendly and everyone I interacted with spoke both French and English. We ordered a baguette and cheese combo platter for an appetizer, which was both fun and delicious! They provided an appropriate amount of bread to cheese ratio. Then I had the Nutella & Banana crep.My reason for a less than stellar review is for a couple reasons, the first being the slower than expected service, since it took roughly 40 minutes for my friend and I to receive our dishes after the appetizer was complete. We were tourists in a foreign city trying to get the most out of the little time we had. Additionally, they packed in so many tables that it was a challenge navigating to the cash register and the exit, weaving in and out of isles made it slightly awkward disturbing people's meals. Furthermore, the density of tables in the space seemed like a fire hazard, not to mention most things were made out of wood."

The food was fine but nothing stellar. I had the croque monsieur and french onion Soup, boyfriend had the prosciutto sandwich. For dessert we split the vanilla cronut which was probably the highlight food wise - so it was a shame it took an hour for our waitress to pluck it from the pastry case to get it to us. From the time she took our empty sandwich plates to the time we finally got the check was over an hour. We didn't even see her at all for 20 minutes - and it's not a big place! If we had to do it again, we'd skip. Food was so so but the service was atrocious. Surely there are more impressive lunch spots in Old Montreal."

The atmosphere have such a lasting impression that I had to find it and go back on my next trip. This time I was able to sit down and order a meal with a friend. I got the Crepe B...(something in French). It was Egg, Swiss, Asparagus, Ham and some sauce. Excellent dish, came out pretty quick, and also came with a small fresh fruit bowl. My Capaccino was delicious as well. (Get it for there. They never taste the same in a paper cup no matter where you go.) I also tasted some Coffee Egclar that my friend ordered and it put a smile on my face. Some people on here say it's too touristy...I say, who cares! The food is delicious, authentic, and the atmosphere is cozy and perfect. It can get busy at brunch and lunch since I heard them taking reservations but we're very prompt and polite about it too waiting customers.

We also had the brownie and eclair which were ok, but I think you can get better at neighboring spots. One downside was that they were out of quite a few dessertsAmbience: nicely dim lit, warm, wooden, classic butcher window in the front if you need to look at what you're ordering before you order.

I had one of their breakfast casseroles (eggs, potatoes, mixed sausages and cheese). OMG, what a fantastic fully balanced dish. It lacked nothing. My boyfriend had one of their breakfast baguettes, complete with lettuce and tomatoes - which at first I found weird. But it gave the sandwich such a refreshing taste. The baguette was huge with crispy exterior and soft interior.The mimosas were tasty and had a slightly different OJ but in a very good way. We took a caramel cronut to go and it was THE BOMB DOT COM.

BIG MISTAKE. Not only did it take FOREVER for our food to come, when it did come, food was terrible. This is a cute spot in the Old Montreal area and I think the cuteness is what lures you in. But once you're in, the food is not that impressive. My brekkie dish had mostly potatoes. We waited over 40 minutes for everyone's dfferent egg order. Whatever it is eggs should not take 40 minutes to make. Are the eggs being hatched out back by the chickens? No excuse. The kitchen definitely doesn't have their sh*t together! The only saving grace for us was the baguette with butter that we asked for. Service was spotty. I saw that other tables that came and were seated after us got their food before us. Not cool at all."

I had intended to order the Cassolette Alsacienne which sounded delicious - a fried egg over potatoes, swiss cheese, mixed sausages, bacon, and shallots. And looking around the restaurant I saw a number of people happily eating theirs. But at the last minute I saw a crepe covered in ham with Gruyere oozing out of it and got it instead....and it was delicious. The crepe also came with a small bowl of fruit which was nice. If you are here for dinner the taste of the cheese and the scent of the hanging meats would suggest that the raclette, fondue, and charcuterie would be good choices. However I would avoid the cappuccino - it was flavorless, expensive, and covered in chocolate powder.The service was a bit haphazard though well meaning. The decor was quite charming. And the location on rue St Paul ensures a constant flow of potential customers."

The ambiance is adorable, but don't let that pull you in. We intended to eat at O+G across the street, but it was packed with a 45 min wait...so we found this  cute place across the street...it was a cold and rainy day, so we went in without reading reviews. Boy was that a mistake. Absolutely the WORST French onion soup...void of any flavor or salt...dirty water with a soggy piece of bread and flavorless cheese. My 10 year old (who has been known to eat poutine for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner...all in the same day) would not touch his poutine...even after we sent it back to be re-done. The fries were white and cold, served with cold gravy that had an off taste, and the cheese curds were cold, hard and not melted at all. We sent it back, it came back out the same way--unchanged. I asked for 3 waters along with our other beverages...we never received them, and the waitress never checked on us. After waiting for the bill for 15 min., we were told to go up and pay at the counter. They never even offered to take the poutine off the bill even though it was untouched. We were completely ignored once they brought the food. Please spend your money elsewhere where people actually care about your business and your contentment."

I didn't regret our choice in coming here because the food is nice, the place is lovely and there was no wait then. We had: Cassolette Alsacienne, omelette Savoyarde and croissant Western. The Cassolette was a bit bland. The omelette had pretty strong taste of the cheeses used (if you like cheese, this is a good one). And the western croissant was very nice - the omelet was fluffy and yummy! Finally the cannelés were lovely! Light and perfect to end the meal. I'd go back and try their meat and cheese platters, as well as their sangria (in tall glasses) - they look very enticing :) . The service was all right."

Stumbled upon this gem as we came in from the Metro and decided to walk as much of Rue St. Paul as possible. Three of us did not finish every bite on the diverse charcuterie board of bread and various meats, pates, fruits, and a tealight-melting cheese trough. Bon jour, gorgeous. An enormous brownie somehow made its way to the table, and was so decadently gooey we had to cross the Canadian border to get it. The baked goods in the case at the rear of the cafe all looked scrumptious, as did the freshly baked baguettes being loaded into an overhead tray. Some folks seemed to come in for takeaway, lining up in the back where the register is and where you pay your bill (they take credit cards). A terrific and vibrant atmosphere with self-proclaimed crazy Frenchmen, and chic decor galore. They spoke French until it was clear we were not fluent, and they transitioned into English out of pity and not snobbishness. Thrilled to have found this tasty, enjoyable spot and would recommend any hungry Yelper seek it out. C'est magnifique!"

Our server was cheerful, helpful, and always arrived at the right moment. The vibe in this place will leave you smiling and tapping your toes along with their funny assortment of music.

/user_details?userid=BytRWk8X1OelSgwwfXd8Aw,Arun D.,"London, United Kingdom",3 star rating,The main kudos that need to be given to Marche de la villette is for having vegetarian food on the menu; a high achievement for a french restaurant. I loved the atmosphere with the silly decorations and the warm lighting. The menu is expansive and victory!!! there is a  veggie option. A pair at my table got the fondue which they raved about. I had the french onion soup which was okay; nothing that would make me return. Now the reason for the 3-star review is the service. The waiters were nice but they were not very attentive. There was also a table of diners that seemed to be the owners/employees who were just being incredibly obnoxious. It created a horrible atmosphere in an otherwise charming restaurant. The house wine we got was also horrible at best. I don't think i'd go back mainly because their veggie option was average and I wasn't impressed by the service.

Twenty minutes went by before our server finally approached us. Unapologetic, he asked for our drink order; we decided to order everything to avoid another MIA server. The best part... I requested a glass of champagne, but was told they didn't have any. I asked how they make the mimosas they market on the menu? Response: white wine, SEVEN UP, and orange juice. C'mon folks. Would a true French-Canadian accept that response?! I ordered a glass of white wine and soup - despite my hunger. I was done with this place. We went on to wait another ten minutes before he approached us again and admitted he'd forgotten my husband's drink order.

I went for the first time in October after hearing marvelous things about the charcuterie (I was on a charcuterie kick at the time). My friend, Jason and I split the charcuterie plate with foie gras as well as a cheese plate (large portions--we had left overs). We both loved it! This time when I came, I got the charcuterie plate and a cronut (caramel). The charcuterie plate had changed a bit-- a couple items were replaced with new things. There was one ""deli"" style meat that I was not a fan of. Other than that I loved everything! There was a new ginger bread that they served with the foie grad that I was obsessed with. The combination was perfect! I also thoroughly enjoyed my cronut. They were a trend in the states for a bit, but sort of died out, so when I saw them on the menu, I knew I had to get one. It did not disappoint. The one negative thing I have to say is that the service did not seem to be super great/consistent. My service personally was fine, but there were people who came in after me and were made to wait before even being greeted by a hostess (they stood awkwardly in the doorway for 10 minutes with only 5-6 of the tables in the restaurant being occupied).

The bread was old and hard, it took a good effort of jaw exercise to bite it. That's not the worst, half way through the hard work, a long hair tangled out from it. It was disgusting looking and totally knocked out our appetite. We had our waitress looked at it, she marveled ""my goodness"" and asked if we want a new one instead. We could not continue to eat after this and told her no. The item was taken out the bill, but the experience lasted and memory of that curly blond hair sticking out from the roll ruined the day.

It's crowded, bustling, efficient, and kid friendly. They had a booster seat that strapped onto both the chair and the child, which was much appreciated. It has a fun, if kitschy, decor. I had the smoked meat sandwich with French fries (inside the sandwich!), my wife had the french onion soup, and my daughter had the kid's ham and cheese crepe.  My sandwich was delicious - perfectly toasted bread with lots of meat. Everything else was good too. Even my picky daughter happily ate the contents of the crepe. I recommend it for an efficient lunch break while seeing the sights."

Without a doubt, the service here was the worst I had ever experienced. Comically so! I wondered if I was in an episode of ""just for laughs"" and on camera.  Sadly, not. The prices were ridiculous for the quality (do you like to pay 5 star prices for food court food... Then maybe this is your place). And the service  made me long for the consistent banality of Swiss Chalet or similar. Where to begin? Amongst other things: - arrived for brunch at 11. Reservation was made for a party of 8. We were seated at a table for 6. And given 2 menus. A request for additional menus yielded one more. Three menus for 8 people.- our coffees arrived about half an hour after we were seated (and had asked for coffee). No milk, cream, sugar or spoons, just coffee. Requested same. And asked passing waiters for ""du lait et de sucre"". Response was a rude ""it's coming "". And it did, 20 minutes later our waiter threw two milk capsules on the table. One was empty. We asked again for spoons and sugar and he returned with one spoon for the table to share, and a snarky ""your spoon, madam"", as if it was a ridiculous ask. The spoon was a tablespoon. The first two meals arrived, followed by the next 3 or 4 each 5 minutes apart.. We had been there more than an hour.  Oh, did I mention that no cutlery came with the meals? When I finally went to the front counter to ask for forks, I was met with a very  rude ""please remain seated"". The cutlery arrived almost half an hour after the first meal was served. There are too many things to mention... My friend had ordered a basket of baguette with ""assorted confitures"" (homemade jams and jellies). She received a dry piece of bread.. no jam (or knife, but why be picky, nothing to spread anyhow). The waiters response, again 30 minutes late, was ""I think we are out of jam""... She said okay, but I don't think I should have to pay for it. He swiftly removed the bread, lest she try to get any actual nourishment.The response to our complaints was an unapologetic - we are very busy.  The waiter did, eventually offer to waive the price of 2 coffees.  I should note that we are not tourists, we are French speakers, half of our party lives n old montreal. I guess tourists who could never return are the target demographic.  PS - we never did get the round of waters that we ordered as we sat down...but you already figured that, right?"

I can't be responsible for what happens after that. We stopped in this little spot because sommmmeone (me) has a teeny bladder. Also, because it was a butcher shop and my BF is obsessed with meat. While i ran into the bathroom at warp speed, he ordered us a beverage and the charcuterie plate. What arrived stunned me. It wasn't a plate - it was a platter. A platter full of the most amazing meats ever. Foie Gras that was so buttery and incredible I can scarcely believe it. That was just the tip of the iceberg/mountain of meat. Two kinds of pate, proscuitto, pancetta, a shreddy thing, roast beef, salami, some other meat spread I couldn't identify but immediately ate and cornichones and mustard of course.In the end, one of the servers promoted this ice wine to us. His claims were spot on about how complementary it was... but at $20 a glass, we felt a little cheated. That's pricey even for Montreal and it seems like something he should have mentioned. A good stop in experience for us based on the charcuterie plate alone. Skip the ice wine. It's nice - but not that nice."

I think this is an absolute case of false advertising- if you're going to wave the 'juliet et chocolat' sign, then you've sorta got a reputation to uphold. definitely not returning for anything else; if they cut corners on something as cheap and straight-forward as hot chocolate, i don't even want to consider any other cost-saving shortcuts they take with their food."

I mean, my baguette was great, my brie cheese was great, but together they couldn't save my sandwich from the two pathetic slices of ham. Even the skinniest Frenchman would have cried, ""C'est terrible!""Yet I'd probably return again because the character of the place and the very nice employee made up for my sparsely-packed ham sandwich."

I will say the first time we came here in 2012, the waiter was a little more playful and let me speak french with him- this time the chick meant business. Which is completely fine, but in being you are in a french speaking city, it's fun to try! I was fluent by the time I left Montreal before- and this time was more hesitant. Comfort level I guess? I digress.The food is so good, so fresh and so filling! I had the quiche loriane with a mimosa. Last time the glasses were bigger, but it was just as good. I know everyone at the table REALLY enjoyed their food. Service was great- and the dessert was even better. Who gets dessert with breakfast?

Went here with a friend and we both ordered the Super Assiette which is really indeed super in terms of size and taste. We were both handed a plate with lots of fruit (cantaloupe/honeydew/pineapple/strawberries), generous amount of salad, deli meat, bacon, Alsacian style omelete, 3 small pieces of baguette, crazy good cheese (though I don't know what kind but man it was really good quality cheese), and of course I had my coffee. Now I recommend the super assiette if you're coming on a complete empty stomach and have not yet eaten a breakfast or anything at all. It is really filling but I took my time of course, talking a lot while throwing in bites here and there. The service was quite fast , and the waitress was very patient to have brought us 3 things that we wanted extra...like more baguette, more dressing and more coffee. I liked the decor of the place. Ambiance was warm and cozy. I also particulary liked the fact that it was not only a restaurant but a fromagerie and a boucherie. I was highly tempted to buy the same cheese that was served on my dish and bring it home....but alas I didn't.If you're looking for something different for brunch and you are in the old port area, visit Marche de la Villette.

The service started out fine; the waiters were friendly and chatting people up as they sang and danced from table to table. But then the time started passing and we were waiting 45 minutes just to get someone's attention so we could get the check, after already waiting 30 minutes for our food to be brought out. At first, since it was one of our first meals here, we thought it was a cultural thing, like in Europe. But the line from cultural to poor service was quickly crossed and we were getting more and more impatient as we saw people who came in after us were paid more attention than we were. Other servers took patron's empty plates and asked if they wanted dessert, coffee, etc. Our server did not. Instead, he quickly took our plates and was behind the counter washing dishes immediately afterwards (never to come back), and no other server would give us the time of day. They only seemed to say something after I put my coat on and my partner had their card visible in their hand. We had originally wanted to order a cronut and espresso, but as the time passed we just wanted to get the hell out of there. When we finally got the bill, they didn't even let us pay right there. You have to then go wait in line behind people who came in only to order takeout. Overall, the quiche was good and the decor was really really really cute, but the service was the absolute pits. We weren't the only table that looked irritated while waiting for the check, either. It seemed only large groups or french speakers were getting any attention."

/user_details?userid=OhlniZi0wrmAneNHPCM7Sg,Linda C.,"Bethlehem, PA",4 star rating,"While searching for an authentic French-flavored Montreal dinner, my daughter and I arrived in a somewhat-deserted Vieux Port section of town, hoping for a restaurant with lots of ambiance, for which Montreal is renown.  Not sure why the area was so empty at 5:15pm--perhaps it was due to the rather cold temperature, but I would think Montrealers are accustomed to that.  We wandered along the quaint Rue St. Paul, with its fabled cobble street, and stumbled upon this cozy, corner restaurant, Marche de la Villette.  The posted menu and pricing appealed to our appetite and budget, so we went inside, only to learn the kitchen was closed and that we could only order sandwiches.  That was a little disappointing because I was really in the mood for the advertised crepes, but apparently they close at 6pm and needed all that time to clean up (one can only imagine what they do in there to require all that time).  So, on account of being numb with cold, we ended up ordering the hot Toulouse (sausage) sandwich, which was served in wrapped red-and-white checkered paper, in a basket.  Not fancy but still adequate enough for our taste.  What the Marche lacks in pretense it more than made up for in ambiance.  It's a very cozy dining experience.  The tables are mostly tables for 2 yet are somewhat crowded together.  They play nice French music, presumably from the Alpine region near Germany, as the music sounded almost a mesh of the two countries' varying folk styles.  More importantly, the food was delicious.  The sandwich was served on a fresh baguette with flavorful sauces, lettuce, and tomato (it also includes pickles, though I asked for mine to be omitted).  Our water was served in plastic cups.  So, again, nothing fancy, but it was fine.  We will definitely try to come back the next time in the city so that we can sample their crepes.As for the service we received, it was very good.  Our food only took a few minutes to prepare.  French is their primary language, but both employees who helped us spoke some English and were friendly.  Also, the overall pricing was moderate (most dishes were between $7-14).  So, all in all, a thumbs-up experience."

As I waited for my food, I soaked in the atmosphere. The tables were small and close together, and there was French music playing. Perhaps it was just me, but the decor seemed a bit over the top, like a Disney version of a French cafe, but the food and service were wonderful.When my lunch was served, the platter was covered with a selection of pate de foie gras, a country-style duck pate, duck rillettes, a pate of pork and veal, prosciutto, ham, salami, a small crock of mustard, some cornichons, brie, two local cheeses, and a small green salad. This also came with a small basket of bread. It sounds like a lot of food--and it was. And it was utterly delicious.I couldn't stop eating the pate de foie gras and the duck rillettes, as well as everything else. The country-style duck pate was my next favorite, with a bit of mustard.

Our waiter kindly explained the food items, what's included in the fixed price lunch, and even took us to the deli window to point out options.My husband's ham and cheese crepe was fantastic and one of our favorite food items we tasted in Montreal. I chose a sausage/sauerkraut/potatoes dish that was good. Before our plate principal, we were served vegetable soup. It was thick, almost like a puree, but very tasty.For dessert, we got a waffle type desert (it was fun watching the woman making them) with apple and powdered sugar.

They always do their best, are friendly and if you engage them, full of personality!One of us has an obsession with their assorted meat platter which allows you to taste their many cold cuts and pates. If you have this plate, spend the extra $15 and get the foie gras pate - possibly the best out there (and we've had a lot). Our last visit saw us tip over the edge of indulgence, like the good food whores we are, when we ordered their assorted cheese platter along with the meat. They came on two wooden cutting boards with a basket of cut up baguette, and they leave you to your imagination to mix the flavours.The meat assortment includes: rabbit terrine, pork terrine, liver terrine, ham, turkey, salami, roast beef and of course we included the foie gras. The roast beef feels like it's carved fresh off a giant hunk of meat in the back, we could have rubbed our faces in it. The salami was perfectly balanced with fat and spices. The infamous foie gras pate was buttery melt in your mouth deliciousness. Top it with a slice of strawberry and let your taste buds rejoice.The cheese platter included a creamy brie, a local St. Andre Chevre (oozy creamy goodness), a Quebecois swiss and an unidentified, but wonderful, gouda-like cheese.Have fun mixing and matching the cheeses and the meats with the sides of spicy mustered, pickles, fig chutney and strawberry.Ordering both the cheese and meat assorted platters is only for the brave of heart. We are true food whores, and even we couldn't eat seven hours later. But our attempt clearly made us famous with the staff as they remembered both of us the next day. This is likely something normally shared with groups of four.Do order a glass of red wine (we had two each, the gluttons that we are), served perfectly at European room temperature - you won't regret it.If you can still stand it, do have the coffee. It's fantastic, almost nutty, rich, thick and strong. If you like cream, ask for extra - you'll need it. For those who travel, this shall not be unfamiliar as it's quite typical in Europe."

One waitress was LITERALLY dancing around, sitting at tables, talking to everyone (who she clearly didn't know), while we waited 20+ mins to place our order, an additional 45 mins for soup, then they brought 1 sandwich & the other arrived a solid 20 minutes later. One waitress sat at the table next to us & struck up a conversation with the woman dining alone & apologized for not taking her order quicker, she'd been there maybe 6 minutes. we were separated by inches (they really squeeze you in) & waited well over 90 minutes for 2 sandwiches; nobody apologized. oh, & they brought the wrong sandwich (you'd think they'd know the difference between a croque-monsieur vs. a croque-madame,) but i wasn't about to waste another minute. in all fairness - the sandwich was really good.My BF is the sweetest man on earth, he doesn't complain, but even he was pissed. we tried to pass it off as ""European"" but i don't care where you are, its super-annoying to watch people walk in well after us, get served, eat, pay their bill & leave -- while we were still waiting on friggin soup."

/user_details?userid=DumxScxhxu4bk5Hwzq6EGA,Kassia M.,"Kitchener, Canada",1 star rating,"This restaurant is unique in that it is the only restaurant I've ever left and then immediately gone to find other food. I also feel bad to write this as a Yelp review without having talked to the staff in person, but there is no way to explain how truly crazy it is inside and how little you see your server.Was  planning on going to another place in the neighbourhood but it was closed, and was attracted to the very charming exterior of this restaurant. Looking up the reviews later, it seems like this is a pretty hot and cold place, and my guess is when they are busy their service is heavily impacted. I can definitely see how this would be a good restaurant if the service was better, the atmosphere is fun and the menu is creative.Unfortunately, the day we went was very busy. We were seated immediately and given the crowd our server was fast with taking our orders/ bringing coffee. The issue came later - probably about 20-30 minutes after ordering our breakfasts. The server came to me (not my partner) and said my order couldn't be done, they were out, could I have a bacon croissant (instead of the vegetarian cassoulet I had ordered). I told her I was vegetarian and asked her if there was a veggie option instead, she told me she didn't have time to wait for me to decide and ran off. I'd totally get that if this was my initial order and I was making her wait, but this was her coming to me maybe 30 minutes after I ordered and asking me to on the fly come up with a second order, without a menu or anyway of knowing what dishes I could eat. I called after her that was fine, I would have a vegetarian omelet (the only other veggie dish I remembered).Then the food came. Ends up it was my boyfriend's western croissant that was cancelled, not my cassoulet (which made her bacon croissant offer way more understandable, although I wish she had taking 30 seconds to explain this at the table). Before we started eating our server did check in, and we told her we needed cutlery. Once we had the cutlery she did not come back to check in, if she had I would have explained to her the mix-up, as well as the fact that my vegetarian cassoulet had chunks of ham throughout it. My boyfriend ended up eating the cassoulet (not great, even ignoring the meat chunks) and as I really hated the omelet he ate that as well. Our server never came back except for 2 seconds to drop off the check with a ""love you guys, thanks!"" Would never recommend going back, at least not on a busy day."

The food was okay, but we didn't have a good experience. First of all, I got a very visibly dirty mug for my tea at first. The waiter apologized and he brought me a new one. Then we overheard the ladies at the table next to us also weren't getting the baguette they asked for, so she just cancelled it as she basically already finished her food and never got the baguette. Then at the end, another server (female) just took our plates away and stacking each thing one by one on the other table (where the ladies that asked for the baguette sat). So those ladies and us shared a confused look and glances as that is a very rude thing to do. You can't just take empty plates from one table and start stacking them on other tables before you get a comfortable grip of them to take back to the kitchen. That was very awkward. I had the Croque Madame and my fiancé had the asparagus crepe. He thought his was standard, mine was not bad, but nothing special. Had much better ones elsewhere. We probably won't go back."

The interior, remodeled within the last couple years, is also nice and intimate. We shared the charcuterie and cheese boards, which came accompanied by a nice little salad. The items are from their house-made charcuterie, and the cheeses were a good selection, and fresh. The pates and rillettes were fantastic - the rabbit, the pork, and especially the duck. What we had was traditional and good, but I wouldn't say outstanding compared to what we've found at, say, Marche Atwater. The house red wine was just OK, the service was friendly but sporadically attentive, and the price was steep. Maybe this is more of a winter place; I remember having the French onion soup and charcuterie, among other things, during previous cold-weather visits, and loving it."
