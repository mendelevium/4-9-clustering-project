/user_details?userid=xZz56LNb1L1HUt2qb7rRBA,Roseanne N.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Happy Lamb Hot Pot is one of the most solid places worldwide for hot pot. My experience here was overall positive considering the service and food we received. We came here on New Year's Eve, and not surprisingly, had to wait in line. Fortunately, the wait was only 20 minutes. We opted for the classic AYCE with duo broth pot, and ordered some extras on the side: lamb skewers and a soy milk pitcher (usually they offer this free at a drink station in the Toronto location). The lamb skewers were only $2 and they were huge. It was savoury and delicious. I highly recommend it. The quality of their meat is just okay, but I was quite satisfied overall. The lamb had a good fat to meat ratio, while the beef was to a lesser extent, but still quite tender. I love Happy Lamb most for their rich and flavourful broth. It's not too watery or too overloaded with spices. I was pretty content with my meal here at Happy Lamb, and will definitely return in the future!"
/user_details?userid=YfxcaQ_Z6z8eGdT_NDN1uw,Xm D.,"Lexington, MA",4 star rating,"This is our go-to place for hot pot every time we visit Montreal for many years. This is the place we would wait for hours to be seated before. There is a large variety of food to choose from. However, it looks like it is under new management for our most recent visit.  The spicy soup base is not as tasty and flavory as before. It is a little disappointing. I would give it 5-star for the menu under previous management a year ago, but was struggling to rate the current one between 3 and 4 stars. Maybe 3.5 stars. It was not busy at dinner time in a Friday night when we walked in.  We were seated right away. The servers were nice, but we had to serve the water ourselves...... a few items we ordered including some veggies were out of stock, very disappointing.All in all, it is not the same as before, but still a pretty nice place for hot pot."

I thought it was very expensive for the quality of the food. I paid 120$ for 4 people for lower quality food. This was probably the worst hot pot I've had. And I've had many! The service was okay. They forgot to bring a dish after I reminded them twice, and they still didn't bring it."

/user_details?userid=Pzft5lIw1gBKyGFVHubwnw,Songyi W.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"$22 all you can eat hot pot with amazing broth and amazing lamb? Hell yes!Their clear broth is among the best I've had in US and Canada. It's so good that one can enjoy it without any dipping sauce. And the lamb - sliced super thin and ultra tender. It takes less than 10 seconds to cook and just melts in your mouth. For $22, I would say they have a pretty nice variety of selections - anywhere from tofu, veggies, to mushroom, beef, fish balls, shrimp, rice cake, and noodles. But my two favorite items other than the lamb were the handmade noodles (remember, get that instead of the udon! Way better), and the quail eggs. I would be living in paradise if I could only having the lamb, the noodles, the quail eggs, and some veggies cooked in the rich broth everyday! A lot of people on Yelp complained about the service. However, I didn't have any issue with service (maybe they have now improved?). The two male waiters who helped us were both friendly and attentive and our orders always came within a couple minutes. Now I just wish I lived it Montréal so that I can come back more!!"
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I love hot pot and today I finally decided to try this place and despite some mediocre reviews I was pleasantly surprised. The hot pot broth is exactly what I had in China, you have a choice between the regular and spicy one. The service was quick and nice despite it being a little bit busy due to the cold weather. It's definitely a great place to come with friends, I mean hot pot is the most fun way to have a delicious dinner. I'm coming back here real soon."
/user_details?userid=yWqZfB6sybmqUtQXJT18CA,Cindy W.,"Manhattan, NY",3 star rating,"This hot pot hits the spot if you're craving it (on a cold wintry day), but honestly there's better hot pot out there. It's average.Their sauce bar is average. I thought the consistency of the sesame sauce was too water-y, and they only have the basic ingredients. I appreciate the complimentary spring rolls, sesame balls, and fried dough. Because we came at the beginning of lunch just before noon, they were still setting up.It's a fixed price for lunch and dinner (dinner menu has more options, like fish fillet, which wasn't available at lunch :( ). Special items can be added on for a price. Soup base is average, could be a lot more flavorful. Beef quality is meh--we got 2 separate orders of the same meat, but they looked different. Fried taro is meh. I love frozen tofu in hot pot, and it was fine. Their spinach was extraordinarily fresh, and I highly recommend it. Hand-pulled noodles are super delicious too.Everyone just went up to the counter to pour their own waters, but it's an AYCE place so customer service is not the selling point. Manage your expectations! Still delicious!"
/user_details?userid=1kNsEAhGU8d8xugMuXJGFA,Calvin S.,"Winnipeg, Canada",3 star rating,"Little Sheep is a relatively well known hot pot place in Toronto, so seeing this place in Montreal definitely made me decide on dining here, especially since it was a cold night.Their lineup procedures weren't well defined at all, but basically walk upstairs and form a line along the cashier to the rear of the restaurant. On a busy night you'll probably be lining up for 15-30 minutes, if not more.Not sure if it was the holiday season or something, but many of their broths were not available that night. The restaurant only had the spicy broth, clear broth, or the yin yang broth. I honestly really wanted their tomato broth...anyway, had to settle with the yin yang broth I guess.Food quality wildly varied. Their seafood such as squid and handmade balls were really good. However, their lamb didn't taste natural at all, and one of their beef types (there are two, the other one tasted excellent) also tasted off. Everything else for the most part tasted average to above average.Don't expect good service here. Efficiency trumps everything here, so you'll be fending on your own. For Montreal Chinatown I guess it does its job, but I've certainly had better hot pot before."

I've been to the Brossard location and the Chinatown location. They both have different styles. Brossard is modern and casual, and the Montreal location is a little more for a night out with friends, and you can dress up. On the second floor of the building, depending on when you go, hard to find parking. You'll need to go up the stairs and I didn't see any handicap access ramp or an elevator.  The place isn't that large but can accommodate a group.Brossard location, you have to leave your table and choose your own foods to cook, so there's limited staff to help.Montreal location has a very friendly and helpful staff.  You choose the foods that you want and they bring it to your table. They had a few different food choices such as garlic beef, so be sure to ask what they have that Brossard doesn't have. All of the food was really fresh and the portions to share were very adequate. There can be a fee if you waste too much but they didn't charge us so it seems quite within reason.The meat was a lovely quality, they have lamb and chicken as well. There's an extra lamb shank that you can order outside of the all you can eat price. The lamb shank was very good, a little small to share with more than one person. It was well seasoned and we all tried it and enjoyed it. The handmade noodles were so yummy, we all enjoyed the ramen noodles and please have the long flat rice noodles, so chewy, just lovely! There are plenty of sauces too! The Sake came warm and they poured it for us and directed us to keep it on the heating plate, yaaaasss!The desserts at this location were very dried out, but in their defence, we arrived an hour before closing. But they had Sesame cakes, so delicious, that were perfect and soft, almost gooey. I could have just eaten sesame cakes for dinner!  Brossard location didn't have sesame cakes.We had a fun evening, and they have some hard liquor, beer and Sake, where Brossard only has beer.The website says that they have Mochi, but on close examination, I see they don't have it in Canada. I also asked to make sure, and they didn't even seem to know what Mochi was.At closing they came to us with last call for food and drinks. We left with full tummies. Would definitely go back to this location before tee Brossard location. Mainly because I enjoy getting dressed for dinner and going downtown. If I were going for a lunch with kids, I'd go to the Brossard location instead.Afterwards we had bubble tea at a little place just outside their door. Try the green tea and peach with lychee jelly! I asked for more green tea and less peach, very sweet if not. Great place to bring friends and family for a new experience."

As soon as you walk in, your nose will be overwhelmed with the amazing smells of their hotpot broth. Be warned though: your clothes WILL smell like hotpot when you leave! FOOD: Delicious and fresh. I love their lamb. Also, their menu has a LOT of variety which is really cool. For a buffet style restaurant, I'm really impressed with their portions, quality and variety. I would definitely recommend this spot, especially in the winter time. It warms you up and fills you up!PRICE: Nice price for the amount of food that you can eat, the variety and the quality. SERVICE: Pretty good service. It's a busy restaurant so it's a little bit hard to flag a waiter down."

/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I have been to over five different locations of the Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot, including the headquarter restaurant in Inner Mongolia (China). In Montreal, service is probably the restaurant's biggest weakness. Waiters/waitresses are overworked and don't seem to care much about customer service. The first order typically comes the fastest, so order ALL of what you want from the very beginning. There's no guarantee for the following orders - it might take 15 mins... or 40. If the food hasn't arrived after a while, enquire about it. Last time we went, our second order was simply forgotten, and the waitress shrugged when asked about it. Given the number of times that it happened, I began to suspect that delaying/losing orders is a sneaky way to decrease overall food consumption.The food itself is consistent, as Little Sheep is a chain store that uses pre-prepared packages for the broth. You can even buy it in Chinese groceries and make hot pot at home! Because all-you-can-eat lamb is so awesome, the non-existent customer service is usually tolerated.Prices are not cheap, but its definitively filling. I wouldn't recommended this place if there was anything better nearby, but I guess it's ok for sudden hot pot cravings."
/user_details?userid=o_IEnOVNuir0QNVkANzyXQ,Esteban Y.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Waoh, when a friend invited me here, I was not expecting this amount of food lol. Basically you have a hot pot in front of you with an amazing tasting broth where you can cook all sorts of stuff: beef, chicken, broccoli, mushrooms, wontons, fish balls, shrimp (the shrimp! So fresh it almost looked alive), dumplings, noodles etc etc etc, you name it, I can't even remember what we put, we ordered everything, it's all you can eat (or at least the menu option that we ordered). So if you are hungry and want to have a Mongolian hot pot rich in flavors and ingredients, I really recommend this place. They will have the normal broth and the spicy one. I would recommend to get half and half, and probably ask to go easy on the spicy side if you are not used to hot spicy food."
/user_details?userid=zzKsgIF472IyDpJxmHDIpw,Rana E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is my fav place. Their broth is amazing. Very deph in flavor, and a soothing aftertaste, pleasant on it's own, which is very fun to drink at the end of the meal. My sis was starting a cold, but it got zapped away from all those herbs in their broth. Awesome comfort food. Spicy Heaven.I bought their broth package from a grocery store that had this restaurants logo on it, and it was not the same at all. It was just the basic base :""oil, salt, fermented soy beans, berries, and chemicals"", the restaurant adds a lot more herbs to their version, and you can clearly see it. I inspected a large seed in the restaurnts broth, even bit into it, and it was a eucalyptus seed, which explains why it zapped my sis's cold. They probably put in a lot of other herbs too, which is why I always feel so good after :3 I love their broth xpA lot of fun variations in their menu, even when they've ran out of certain items. Their lotus root and cow stomach (lower/softer tripe?) are my fav items, never tried them before experimenting here xpTheir blood pudding was bland, and their baby squid was tough as well as their rice cakes because I don't know how to cook all of these lol So better order what you know about. But after looking on youtube, I'm going to try the rice cakes again, and cook them much longer.They refill your pot with non-spicy broth (always on time for us). Since we always get the half non spicy and half spicy broth, which is usually very spicy (yet amazing), I think next time I want to try to ask for the same half divided pot, but both sides with their spicy broth so i can separate the seafood from the land meats. Their non spicy broth is good, but I prefer the fire broth cause it has a nice kick to it :) Would be nice if they could place all the large chilli peppers in a tied mesh bag though, as well as their other large seasoning pieces, so it's easier to find our smaller added items. (Fk it, I'm emailing them lol)Like all AYCE places, they ""forget"" parts of our order, but after awhile, I caught on why. We order too much in one order, so it makes sense that they try to ""help"" out by leaving some out so that we're not stuck with force feeding ourselves so we don't get stuck with paying for left overs that we can't take home. Was annoying at first, until I actually appreciated it by the end when I would get too full to finish. It's just best to go slow and try not to order too much on each round.They have a ""make your own"" diping sauce area. Not labbeled though, which is bad for me, cause I don't know what I'm doing, and made a disaster. I had to beg the waiter to make me one, and what he brought me was BOOM awesome! I tipped him extra just for that to encourage them for the next time my dumbass comes in lol or at least label it. I guess they never had a problem with labeling because the people who go there already know what everything is, since it's not knew to them.This may be my fav place, but my family doesn't like coming here as often as I do because they don't like loosing food in the broth and having to find it. It would be nice to have a type of ""net"" to hold small items together so that we can stop them from overcooking easier or at least put them on scewers, I don't know. I wonder if they would let us bring our own...Seating is comfortable, service is fast as long as the place is not full. Careful about ordering a lot, it's hard to fill the small tables, so pace yourself since you don't want to waste anyways. Suggest to save the noodles for last, to get the flavor of all the ingredients you added.The ""Buffet"" station is where you get your desert, make dipping sauce, and free soft drink refils. Desert are simple crispy pastries, but good with the heated sweetened condensed milk you get to pour yourself, nothing to really brag about, just helps with digestion after. But the best round pastries run out, so I don't suggest you go late if you care for it.Because I'm tempted to eat so much here, it's better to go early and spend the rest of the day burning off everything eaten. If you're not a big eater, 30$ is a lot of money but worth it if interested in having many diff items that are normally separated because they're expensive. This is a nice place to take your time and eat slow in, really enjoy your conversation with your peers and have fun managing the food in the hotpot.I wish we could take the remaining broth to go home with, it's that good! But they don't allow it, probably because they rather people pay to eat there. But for someone like me who doesn't eat out often, it would have been nice, instead of them throwing it out.I would love it if they had the stretchy type of rice cakes here! I think they can be frozen, so I'm sure they could manage it."

It is an all you can eat hot pot place, you can order anything on their menu but you will never get what you ordered. Instead, the waiter will bring you something you never ordered. We sat down, checked a few things on the menu, waited for over 30 minutes, and only got a small portion of sliced lamb. We asked the waiter where are the other things we ordered, and were told that if we order something like spinach, lettuce, or tofu, we could quickly get them; however if we order things like shrimp, mussle, meatballs, we would have to wait longer. We waited for another 20 minutes or so, and got a small plate with two tiny shrimps, two tiny shrimp balls, two mussles,  a few pieces of mushrooms, and two beef balls we never ordered. The beef, fish balls, and a few other things we ordered never came. We tried to place another order. The same story: we got a small portion of sliced lamb and the rest never came. We lost patience and thought we would just order some veggies that the waiter suggested could come out faster. Checked a few veggies and tofu, then got a basket of randomly mixed veggies that didnt match our order. It seems to me that no matter what you order, they will just bring you whatever they want to provide. We finally were charged over $70 for two small plates of lamb and a basket of random veggies, which totally not worth it. I would like to warn everyone to avoid this place."

The restaurant was only 5% full as we were there, the young lady insisted to put us in a awkward place for our party of 5 with a toddler. The explanation was that otherwise the toddler would be injured and they cannot be responsible for, which was the most rude and not considerate explanation. When she started to bring food, she rudely put the three plates of raw beef and lamb on the table on top of our plates and chopsticks which got our chopsticks fallen all over the places. She did not apologize at all. After I called her back since my chopsticks were put on the raw meat, I needed a replacement, she impatiently brought me a new one. I also explained to her that please avoid putting the raw food right infront of my 2 year old, she said that you could replace it yourself. The food is so so. The overall service was bad cause we had to self serve for many things, water, soy milk, etc. and had toask for food for many times before they bring them."
/user_details?userid=iqQBsjqOF9xgIAbsZ2sAZA,David M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Was really excited about eating here for my birthday party. The food was good and the place gets pretty busy. The experience was nice and it's fun to learn a new variation of Asian food. The cleanliness is a little off, but it's typical for Chinatown.Having 3 teenagers with us, they barely ate because they read the sign about wasted food and became extremely cautious to the point where they pretty much skipped the food to eat ice cream and cake.While I understand the concept of not wasting food, sushi buffets will charge you $1 per piece not eaten. This place will charge you a full $19 for 200 grams of wasted food. The whole concept of a buffet is that it's a way to try foods you would not normally eat, there is unfortunately going to be some waste, but I can say I have eaten at so many buffets now, that I can now know exactly when to stop and eat everything on my plate.But a 15 year old or somebody who ogles the buffet and might be full earlier than expected should not be punished for that. Or somebody might pick an item and not like it.I only made one trip to the raw food buffet and there are a lot of items i skipped because I had to eat more than my share of food since others could not finish.My suggestion is to go with people who will eat a lot, and go for the lunch buffet, it's $12 instead of $19, my 2 star review is the Overall impression and as good as the food was, the lasting taste in my mouth is the poor wasted food policy."

We spent about 2 hours in total. Service was quick and efficient. Little concerned about the raw meat being handled though.. Raw cuts of lamb, beef and especially chicken were just served as is and the waiters didn't seem to wash hands after touching the plates they were served in. Offered menus etc casually. The flavors... amazing at first.. but after an hour of the broth boiling, the flavors just seemed (as expected) to taste only of MSG :( But anyway, the experience was fun and we had a good time! Got so stuffed! My boyfriend even tried the desserts! (I was too full) He liked it very much! Some of the eclair like things barely had any cream fillings but there were some with a decent amount.. So inconsistencies there.. Same with egg rolls.. Too much of wrapper and barely any filling.. Note: The broth is charged extra from the AYCE. AYCE during the weekends is $20.99 per person for dinner. So it should be about $50 for 2 people roughly. There's fountain soda serving canada dry, sprite, nestea, coke, fanta and diet coke. Included in the AYCE along with the desserts and condiments. They do mention charging an extra person's AYCE prices if the leftovers are over 100grams in weight. But during a busy night like Saturday night, they barely check since there's a wait at most times. They don't seem to take reservations either.So bottom-line: worth a visit for the experience. Enjoy while the flavors last! Recommend garlic beef and chicken :)"

/user_details?userid=V6MsTK2hkVOMqilpcZpb1A,Yu Z.,"Brossard, Canada",3 star rating,"Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of hot pot. There is nothing more satisfying than throwing ingredients into a flavourful boiling hot broth and watch it cook as you anticipate what it will taste like in your mouth. The concept of AYCE makes it even more exciting for me. However, Montreal's Little Sheep is a let down for this promising idea. I am not a very picky eater but I do expect food to be fresh and make me feel safe about eating it. The meats were fresh enough, but on the other hand, the veggies weren't all washed. I suspected dirt on them. Make sure to have the pot boiling before putting anything in, do not eat raw food. The seasoning bar was ridiculous... Sesame sauce was diluted with lots of water, I had to add 2 teaspoon of salt and soya sauce to make it taste something. No ingredient was labelled, it was such a struggle to mix the dipping sauce. Someone give me advice on how to differentiate salt/sugar, vinegar/soya sauce without looking weird and tasting them :(. Anyways, the make-your-own-food experience is something to try out, and if you're YOLO enough, do give it a try. Taste wise it's not that bad because the broth is still good and tasty. Price is high for what you get as of quality of food. I'd say service is better than average Chinatown restaurants, orders came quickly at our tables.  I will not be back before a long time, I would rather try other hotpot locations in Montreal."

The three most important things for a delicious hotpot are:-robust broth (so I recommend only ordering their spicy herbal broth)-fresh vegetables and thin sliced meats-a well-made dipping sauceThe well-made sauce portion of a good hotpot meal relies solely on you, the patron, to make at the sauce bar.  No one is going to hold your hand through this process, but I can attempt to give you a quick recipe for a good one;  2:12 hot chili oil with bits, 2:12 soy sauce, 1:12 sesame oil, 2:12 scallion/chives, 2:12 cilantro (a must have), 1:12 vinegar, 1:12 paste/minced garlic, 1:12 ginger paste.  There is also a sesame paste sauce that can be made using diluted sesame paste, but I like spicy.Don't be afraid of the watercress, and try making a hard boiled egg.  The cooked egg is delicious peeled and then dipped into your dipping sauce.There is also a small buffet portion set up that has things like spring rolls and sesame balls.  But, I found these items not to be very fresh.  There is also an all-you-can-drink soda and juice fountain that actually has some delicious sweetened soy milk on tap and orange juice."

I discovered this place several years ago and have been visiting ever since. Gone is the buffet-style, you'll now find the whole restaurant has been renovated and re-designed. You now order each item from a menu that you fill out, and the overall quality of the items has gone up from what I remember. Everything tasted fresh (beef, lamb, shrimp, squid, mussels, vegetables, tofu, fish, sausage, noodles) and was presented quite nicely. What you lose by not being able to pick 1 piece of an item, you gained in quality. You can still self-serve soft drinks and mix up your own dipping sauce. There are also desserts available with no charge (ice cream, sesame balls, canned fruit) and some items to buy for an additional charge.Overall I think this system is an improvement and am already thinking about going back in a couple of weeks."

I've been here once before and had a fine time but last night I went here with a few friends and the service was not on par with paying in total with 15% tax 33.05$. The server let us know that half and half pots were not available for small sizes, and I opted for ""medium spicy"" which was still quite spicy, bright red in colour and chock full of red peppers which I very much regret. My vegetarian friend waited ~30 mins for the first set of vegetables to show up. The restaurant seemed very understaffed and I had to look around and wait very long to get a server to notice us, so much so that the contents of my pot actually started burning at the bottom and creating smoke (not steam) due to them not coming around and pouring more broth in. At that point there was a huge line of walk-ins and it was clear the few staff that were there wanted us out. Honestly for 33$ my meal was not worth it, having late food and being stressed about the lack of waiters coming to refill the soup, plus my burnt pot did not make my experience that great. I will hesitate for sure if any friends want to come here again with me."

My sister and I come here so often that our parents have decided not to join us anymore. I love the variety of food offered and I really love the fact that it's all-you-can-eat. I think the lamb meat is the best and is super tasty with their broth. It used to be a buffet-style where you get up and serve your own food but they changed it to ordering it on a slip. It's still all-you-can-eat but the portions they give aren't always accurate so you have to keep asking for more.I usually get the individual small pots when I come here which is very cute and personalized. It gets a little difficult when the party is too big so I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're more than 6 people. The yin yang broth (half spicy half non-spicy) is excellent and you get the best of both worlds. It's rare to find all-you-can-eat Xiao Fei Yang restaurants so enjoy it here! I've eaten at this chain in three different countries and Montreal has the only locations that are all-you-can-eat.

/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Given the facts that Montréal's Chinatown eateries are mostly disappointing and that this place was recommended to me by my Chinese friends (like, people who were actually born and raised in China, unlike me), there's not much I can do to complain about this place. Yeah, it's definitely not as good as gourmet hotpot chain restaurants in China like HaiDiLao or those that give you your own personal pots that are super cute, but for an AYCE place, the quality is actually somewhat there. My friends and I come here pretty often when we want to stuff our stomachs until we can't walk, and every time has been pretty consistent.We always get a half spicy/half non-spicy broth combination. The spicy broth isn't actually spicy at all for my taste, which is slightly disappointing (especially since I grew up with hotpot using only extremely spicy broth), but then again I've found that to be a recurring problem in most Montréal Chinese restaurants anyway (which will be discussed in later reviews). Then, we stock up on a bunch of meat selections - lots of lamb (my favorite!) and beef slices, beef meatballs, fish balls and fish tofu, and garlic beef are only some of them! We also get different varieties of vegetables and soy-based products, such as regular mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, winter melon, leafy greens, and fresh tofu. Of course, rice cakes and fresh handmade noodles are also in order and really soak up all of the broth really nicely. The only other thing foodwise that I have to mention is that the snack bar can be pretty inconsistent regarding freshness - the cream puffs and palmiers can get pretty soggy or stale, but normally the matuan (sesame balls stuffed with lotus paste) and spring rolls are hot and chewy/crispy! In addition, the sauce selection is actually quite good, and you can make your own combinations into which you can dip your cooked food.Since my friend group and I are basically regulars at Little Sheep, we will be back again. It's definitely one of the better restaurants in a mostly mediocre Chinatown."

Service is good, but since it's all you can eat, a little self help will go a long way, like grabbing the paper menu by the front desk after you're done with the first round and mark selections for your second round order and give the marked paper menu to a waiter. The beef is not that great, but the lamb was outstanding. I would highly suggest trying the Sichuan kimchi (pickled cabbage): whomever made it knows what it's all about and I had two plates. Bit of advice: steer clear of the soft drinks and desserts until you're full, otherwise it's easy to stuff yourself with sodas and pastries.

If you want high quality, delicious, and healthy ingredients, this is the place to go. The service was attentive, super fast, and kind. At one point, my jacket slid off the chair without me noticing, and our server picked it up for us. He was also really attentive with adding broth to our pot when it was running low. He did not rush us at all. I ate here for a good 3 hours, and by the time I finished, both my friend and I could only sit in stunned silence (from contentedness and fullness). We ate: platefuls of lamb, beef, wood ear, marinated beef, marinated pork, kelp, taro, watercress, A-vegetable, potato, hand pulled noodles, clear noodles, shiitake, enoki, and white mushrooms, pork blood jelly, chicken, pork skin, rice cakes, cold dishes, and tonnes of other things. The desserts were also heavenly - oh-so-light cream puffs stuffed with mango custard and cream, spring rolls, super light palmiers, plus perfectly balanced and still warm Chinese rice balls with sesame and red bean. All this was for the lunch all-you-can-eat of $14.99/person. The soup that all this was cooked in was also excellent: legit, no MSG, balanced broth with a whole bunch of real traditional Chinese ingredients that aid with health and digestion benefits. My only wish was that I had a bigger stomach. By the time I rolled out of the door, I honestly felt so satisfied on all fronts (taste, quality, health of ingredients, service, and FULLNESS) that I literally felt like I was floating on a cloud. By the way, the decor is excellent: super modern and clean, with modern traditional Chinese accents. Washrooms are also very clean. All in all, a perfect place for people who love food, and healthy food at that. Great for pairs or groups of people, especially voracious eaters. Only thing is, wear something not too nice because it will smell like wonderful hot pot after."

For a walk on the wild side, meats included chicken hearts and liver even tripe.  And for the starch-loving gal like me, why , 7 different types of noodles was akin to a choir of angles singing.Instead of bringing it to the firefighting wok master, you instead bring all of the rarities to your table where a ""hot pot"" of broth is boiling happily on your own personal burner.  You can choose from regular, hot, or super spicy broth.  I'm a chicken, so it was an order of regular for me and my brave husband chose hot.  They bring the order ""yin/yang"" where you have a pot divided in two with your respective broth choices.  Then, you drop in your fixings and wait for the bubbling action to cook your dinner, strain it, and garnish it with whichever dipping sauce you deem fit.Essentially, it's fondue with an Asian twist.  And I'd never want Mongolian any other way.If you're in Old Towne Montreal, this is a MUST.  It's close to the Metro and easy to recognize with the fuzzy sheep sign logo in green. (Most signs were red or yellow, so it stood out)The restaurant was very clean, staff extremely polite and helpful, and the food was perfect.  I'm sending a snow of emails to get this chain (voted to 100 chains in China as well as one of the top 500 restaurants in a country that surely must have over a billion chains) in my neck of the woods.Best.

I told the host our feedback - she didn't seem to care, smiled and nodded.  Better hotpot down the street - kagayaki, with more respectful staff."

That's all I can say for the experience I had.I went there for my dad's birthday and the waiter guided us to a table in the other room of the restaurant that had this kind of cold atmosphere (whereas the other part of the restaurant was lively and well lit). The waiters were quick and efficient, didn't make much conversation, like at other restaurants in Chinatown. The food was good, nothing special.

/user_details?userid=1lRbzzJ5yXGq6K0CpUCbMw,Chris B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This is the same Little Sheep Hot Pot that has spread across China becoming the Chinese equivalent to say Olive Garden or maybe comparing it to Sizzler's is more accurate. Even though this is the same restaurant, it's been ""localized"" for better or worse. To begin with, it's buffet style. Grab your plate and walk up to the front and pile on the food.  Seafood only makes an appearance for dinner, which is why the evening price is quite a bit more. The front has a section of fountain drinks to choose from and a variety of pre-cooked snacks. The pre-cooked stuff is OK when fresh, but mediocre to bad once the egg rolls, onion rings and other items get cold.The selection of vegetables is acceptable, but again this is where the ""localization"" impacts things. The veggies and mushrooms are all very safe, nothing is too exotic and this can of course be extended to the meats and seafood which all remain very acceptable to western palettes. This is probably the best hot pot restaurant in Montreal but is pretty mediocre as far as ""authentic"" hot pot is concerned. During my last visit some of the seafood was called into question and we were getting a pretty awful stench from an unidentified location. I'll go back for sure and I'll even recommend it to others, but remember you are dealing with raw meat and seafood and vegetables in a buffet environment so be on-guard for any suspect food."

Sometimes, your meat will come in frozen, but that's ok, it's still good.I only ever eat the veggies, because I am not super adventurous and am worried about the seafood, but I am sure its excellent! I enjoy the little bite sized things they have on the buffet too (spring rolls, asian donut-type bread - DELICIOUS, some kind of samosa looking thing, onion rings, etc.You serve yourself (servers come to bring more meat, add broth to your hot pot and troubleshoot any induction hot plate issues that may occur) So expect to get up for water and food often.The price is a little on the expensive side in my opinion, especially for dinner (which has the same choices as the lunch menu) but it is a buffet and quite unique, so once in a while is ok (about $50 for 2 - dinner buffet)This is a little gem in China Town and I recommend going with anyone from your significant other to an entire group, this type of dining allows for conversation and is interactive, fun."

Price was $20 all you could eat but when something isn't to your standards then all you can eat doesn't do much for you. The service was horrible. We waited over a half an hour to get anything. No broth no veggies no meat. Nothing.  There were people there who arrived after who got theirs within 10 mins. I was so upset. I ended up grabbing cups and plates from a different table myself. When I asked our waitress why it was taking so long she just said ""okay"" smiled fakely and walked off. I am a very generous tipper but when service is as horrible as that, I do not tip at all.

Drinks are unlimited in refills, as is food.

Or, at least, not at this place. I was skeptical of the freshness of important food items such as shrimp and fish (not to mention the chicken livers), although I assume the florescent pink beef and lamb slices had so many preservatives in them that nothing could possibly spoil. Of course, I couldn't bring myself to eat the stuff.In short, being adventurous with food can sometimes be a bad thing, and in this case it was a waste of money for two hungry people, who left the restaurant unfulfilled and slightly nauseated.If you're up for the challenge, I recommend going with someone who knows what they're doing as a guide....perhaps there's a better approach to dining in this particular realm. I also recommend that you make sure that you can first handle the smell of the various seasonings in the broth before you commit to an all-you-can-eat experience.Best of luck to you!"

After touring the Basilique Notre-Dame, my boyfriend and I wandered through China Town and stumbled upon a bright neon sign with a cute little lamb. We weren't quite sure what we were getting into but decided this would be the place to eat. Neither one of us had heard of hot pot and we were quite intrigued by the convection stove tops at each table. (This was before we discovered Korean bbq) The waiter brought out a menu with pictures...first you choose your broth- regular or spicy. I like trying anything new so we got both. Then you have your choice of different raw meats to put in your pot. They bring out this huge pot with a divider so it contains both types of broth and let the broth simmer while you stock up at the buffet. They have every kind of vegetable, noodle and seafood you can think of; local as well as unidentifiable. As overzealous newbies, we each filled our plates with just about everything and piled it into the soup. The meat is brought out raw and cooks in the broth, much like Pho'.  The regular broth is not regular at all, it was very well seasoned with whole spices right in the pot. The spicy was screaming hot, but that is how to should be. It was all amazing and very, very filling.The quality of the food was great, the dining experience was really fun and I would recommend this place to anyone going to Montreal.  I heard there is a Little Sheep here in San Diego, so soon I will stop by there as well :)"

Ask for the super super spicy  broth if you are daring :D and my favorite way to eat hot pot is to star with meat (lamb) .After about 2plates of lamb, I start with veggies and frozen tofu (be warned some of their labels have the weirdest translation).

Located in Montreal's China Town, we were taken for a little tour in the dirtiest part of the city (and this city is probably the cleanest city Ive been to). You could instantly recognize that this was a hot spot by the many people flocking in and out of the establishment. The first thing I liked about this style of hot pot is that its buffet. Unlike most hot pots where they serve you a certain selection of veggies that they hand picked for you, you get to choose exactly what vegetables and how much you want to put in your pot. That being said, I am not really sure how fresh the veggies are being displayed open deli style right near their front entrance. Hordes of children and families were running around using their hands when utensils were not readily available and I did not see one staff member come out to replace stale food. We were told that we HAD to order the beef/lamb combo (I don't eat lamb) which left my boyfriend having to eat the whole dish. This wouldn't have been a problem if we didn't see the sign on the table that said if we wasted 200 grams of food, we would be charged another 15,99$ So basically, he filled up on food he didn't want just so I could eat the food I did want. I was not very happy about that but he seemed to be okay with it. Overall, I would have given this 2 stars because it wasn't that fantastic.

I only cook the meat in the spicy broth and everything else on the other side. This place also has a wide selection of vegetables, different types of tofu and mushrooms as well as a variety of noodles to select from. You can also help yourself to drinks at the soda fountain and they have an array of delicious desserts. I think I ate five or six freshly made mini sesame balls. I loved everything about this place from the quick service to the clean and modern look of the dining room. And the best part was how cheap it was for a buffet.
