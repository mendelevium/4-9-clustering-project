It was the best Korean fried chicken (KFC) I've tried compared to Mon Ami on Saint Catherine, Dawa on Sherbrooke, and The Basak on Guy.The skin and meat just fell off the bone, and the chicken was still crispy and hot after I lugged it home. I liked that they kept the box open so that the heat wouldn't collect and make the chicken soggy.It wasn't spicy enough for my tastes (I rarely find anything marked ""spicy"" spicy enough), but the seasoning was superb. And this entire chicken came with a salad.I was able to split up all the pieces into three meals. Thank you Sopoong for the best KFC I've had so far!"

My husband and I were eyeing this place for a while since new restos are such a novelty nowadays. We called in for pickup and service was friendly and fast. It looks to be a family owned business and I remember passing by while they were putting on the signage and being super cute giggling excitedly at seeing the windows done. The place itself is truly beautiful with lots of ambiance lighting and natural look at makes it very inviting. Sadly, loads of chairs and tables in the main areas that won't see some use for a while.We ended up ordering the dak galbi lunch special and the soondubu chicken dumpling lunch special. Except, I got a seafood soondobu instead..  oops, gonna chalk that up to new resto opening nerves. I am such a sucker for bento style, cafeteria trays, and plane food because of all the little sides and things you get to try. So it was with glee that I opened up that dak galbi and snuck bites out of it while my husband was digging in. And banchan (side dishes)!! Gosh, I love a good selection of banchan so that's a definite plus. Verdict? It's good. It's healthier tasting than a lot of Asian places and the seaweed salad was excellent. But... slightly too sweet for me, though I'd still happily eat it anyways. Good amount of spice, not too oily, and lots of veg. Rice cooked perfectly, and I love that my rice had a bit of black and white sesame seeds. Nice little detailed touches. Soondubu itself was a bit watery and bland for me. Kimchi could use more time to ferment in my opinion but lovers of fresh crisp kimchi will probably appreciate it. Prices are decent and fairly good value for your money.Overall a nice lunch and we're thankful for the big portions.We wish you the best Sopoong!"
