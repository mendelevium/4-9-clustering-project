/user_details?userid=90fyHymYCrcnfsAn7CDGXw,Stefanie R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I ordered from here at least three times over the last couple of weeks and the food was always fresh, hot and plenty. I only ordered vegetarian dishes so cannot comment on the meat or fish dishes. The Palak Paneer was very nice with pieces of fresh ginger (nothing from a can). The Chilli Paneer was a nice surprise. Never had anything like it before. Though the second time I ordered it, it was too salty. Another dish i usually don't see on other menus is the Shahi Paneer. Super creamy and tasty. The naan bread could be a bit less crispy but the taste is good. Happy to order again."
/user_details?userid=rrheeDQXeB3anWMNvDibSQ,Seth Q.,"Deep Creek South, Chesapeake, VA",1 star rating,Waited an hour for my food after it was supposed to be ready. Rude staff at the counter as well! Would've been fine had I not gotten home and discovered a wet mush of pakora crumbling apart and curry with 0 heat and was cold!
