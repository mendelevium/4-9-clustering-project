They have a beautiful selection of teas and their presentation is very dreamy. I love their natural, wood, mix matched furniture. The ambiance is sombre inside but you have the option of sitting outside as well. They have a food menu as well. It is not halal as per the staff. The staff is very welcoming. Parking is difficult because it's downtown."
/user_details?userid=jrEiNGTP_s7i8XSGCek8Hw,Helene C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This Persian cafe is a hidden gem! The atmosphere is warm and cozy. On the wall, they have all these jars of herbs and flowers used for their teas. The Persian fragrance tea comes in a glass jar. The flower pink petals of roses and green leaves are so beautiful! The roses may have a slight bitterness.I couldn't decide which cake to choose. After my cousin ordered the saffron cake, I decided to order the orange cake so that we could taste both of them. When the cakes arrived at the table, wow! The portions are generous! The saffron & rosewater cake is what you need if you love sweet desserts. Soaked in rosewater syrup, this cake is moist with a nice aroma of roses. On the other side, the orange & almond cake is less sweet with a fruity side from the slices of oranges.I loved this cafe so much, I will definitely be back again!"

I like the Iranian bread, but the rest of the plate(eggs, saussage, tomato slices are just something you can get from anywhere else at lower price). In general, it's a bit overpriced for the food offerred."
/user_details?userid=IiFqAnURXyM8HVW8xKsrxw,Jessica K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my favourite cafes around McGill/concordia area to study or chill, especially when you're longing for somewhere cozy and homelike. Whenever I crave some Persian tea or goodies, Cafe Aunja is my go-to. While the drinks and food are somewhat pricy, every drink I've had has always been delicious. My favourite drink is the Persian Fog and their saffron cake infused with rose water is an absolute must-try. I get it every time. Even when I'm not hungry. I've never heard a disappointed review. Try it!!It's typically pretty full  so I recommend going earlier if you want a good seat!"
/user_details?userid=YUlBxBTPMPM3mawg4Opuvw,Haque I.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"In the last 4 months I tried this place 4-5 times. The first time I was super impressed with the interior design and vibe of the cafe. I guess I was tired of 6 years of Starbucks and Peet's and their cousins  in Palo Alto. Anyway, coming back to the café itself, they have nice collection of different drinks. I tried latte and Persian fog here. The Persian fog is kinda fancy but it's way too sweet for my taste (disclaimer: I don't use any sugar in my coffee/tea in general). The problem is one of the main ingredients of this Persian fog is saffron syrup and that's the source of sweetness. I tried ordering it with less amount of saffron syrup but it was still sweet with less amount of saffron flavor - which kills the whole purpose. They have pretty awesome cake collections. I tried the almond one. In terms of study place, I have mixed feelings. Due to the compactness inside, it can get pretty loud and noisy. Also there is no guarantee that you would get seats to study in one table if you go in 2+ size of group.Overall it's a nice little cafe for socializing but I would be hesitant to go there to take sip on the coffee while studying something deep."

Everytime I come to Montreal, this is one of the first places that I make sure to visit.The food is savory, delicious and authentic. It does take a little time (10-20 min) but it is definitly worth it. From their rice pudding to the saffran cake, Cafe Aunja has made it certain that I experienced a Persian culinary experience in the best way possible. I  actually get annoyed because I don't know whether I should order my favorite items or try new things. Most of the time, I end up doing both. The location is very convenient: downtown Montreal. The cafe is quiet and peaceful, and has a nice atmosphere to it, although I do wish the chairs were a little more comfortable. :) Merci Food: 4.9Service: 4.5Ambiance: 4.2Overall: 4.625"

The last amazing tea I had was in Italy, but this pot of tea is much better and more flavorful. The service is extremely friendly and courteous. I highly recommend this place for the tea alone.

Pretty busy with the hustle and bustle of students passing through.Soft music in background as I ordered a cappuccino with dessert. I consider myself somewhat of a javaphile so I will give this a thumbs up. The bigger selection is with their Iranian teas which is interesting. The food is not something I would order with a visit here. I found it to be over priced but considering the location it's expected!"

It smells amazing and it's lovely to see a tea place thriving. I'm usually stuck drinking tea in cafes so, it's a welcome change of pace. There's a myriad of selection plus! cute tasty desserts. A must stop for all tea lovers, especially if you want to try something straight from the Middle East rather than the tired English Breakfast. Herbal tea drinkers are very well catered too so, don't hesitate to drop by for a warm tea pot."

Like first impression, the place is cozy, very well decorated and warm. They offer coffee, tea, sandwiches and desert. In the begging I was confused between the tutti frutti tea & the persian tea and finally I opted for the last one !! the mixe of persian rose, orange blossom, lemon and honey is just perfect. I'm happy that a friend of mine invited me to discover this place and I'll definitley return for another cup of tea and sure I'll recommand it to my friends."

Wow! They also offer other breakfast plates with sausage, feta and walnuts, as well as a full lunch menu. Cafe Aunja is a warm and conformable spot with equally warm service.

/user_details?userid=Br9bkJqjKms9BjvKWZsgwA,Ali K.,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",5 star rating,"Cafe Aunja is little cozy cafe in the middle of Sherbrooke Street close to many museums and attractions in Montreal. You can find a lot of Persian pastry, herbal fusions, teas and sandwiches. There are vegetarian and vegan options in the menu. In the middle of cold winter evenings you can trust their suggestion for a good warming Persian herbal tea which makes the rest of your evening. Their sandwices come with Persian bread and they are delicious. There are two options for the soup, the lentil soup is vegan and energetic (ask for Barbaro bread with that). If you go there in summer, you can try smoothie or cold drinks. Don't forget to try shole zard (rice saffron dessert, it is vegan and very healthy)."

Ordered a latte which was very good and half an avocado sandwich which was pretty healthy but a little bland. A sprinkle of salt would have helped.

We ordered a big tea pot which came with some biscuits. A variety of teas to choose from.After consuming our big pot of tea, we asked to add boiled water to the remaining mix of teas and herbs! Cool, wasn't it?! So we had more tea (well a bit less tasty but fine) to sip while enjoying the company."
/user_details?userid=bX-l7noPmsEK5n3a_4ciow,Zeb L.,"Columbus, OH",5 star rating,"Cafes like this are just one of the many reasons I miss Montreal so much. This places manages to hit a perfect checklist of things I want in a coffee shop, and I'll run through some of them.A: Good working environment. Despite being in a fairly small place, there is a lot of seating, it is fully economized (no wasted space here), and it still doesn't feel like everybody's elbow to elbow. There's also wifi.B: Solid tea and coffee options. The tea latte was a favorite of mine, and you get a shocking amount of beverage out of that little teapot. But some of their non-caffeinated options are just as good: water flavored with lemon and a variety of spices is surprisingly good at waking you up without leaving you jittery.C: The orienting theme is Persian, which comes across in the decor. It's not overly stylized, but it doesn't feel sterile like so many other cafes.D: The baked goods are seriously on point. I had a rosewater and saffron cake that was perfectly balanced in terms of flavor, with nothing too overwhelming or at risk of smothering the other flavors, and that is a difficult combination to pull off.E: Having sandwiches available for purchase. Much as I love baked goods and coffee, eventually the human body needs something more substantial to function. And the sandwiches aren't like the bland crap you find in so many other places, but are actually well-made, with appropriate levels of condiments. Even the bread is good.Maybe I'll move back here."
/user_details?userid=Vj9w53PUuysV9Nu767Tw4g,Cecilia L.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,Such a good vibe in this cute cafe in the heart of Montreal's downtown. Background music is kept at a low volume so it's easy to have a conversation and the decor is so cute! Coffee was a tad expensive ($10 for two iced lattes) but quite good. Didn't try any of their food but they had some beautiful looking baked goods lines up by the cash register. Definitely check this place out if you're in the area!

Although a little overpriced, it's nothing too different from other overpriced cafes and their drinks are very unique so I say it's worth it. I love their London Fog because they serve it with dried lavender on top, which adds a nice touch."

/user_details?userid=VWECnpBZkQtBJThq0Bmyew,Leema J.,"Minneapolis, MN",4 star rating,"A quaint coffee shop with a warm atmosphere. It is decorated with random pieces of furniture that contribute to its cozy/warm vibes. Personally, I ordered a latte (which was delicious) but it seems that the tea is what you must get here. The tea is served in mason jar-like containers that hold various tea leaves and whatever else will make the tea (fresh ginger, lemon wedges, honey etc). There was a Persian tea of some sort that looked particularly enticing. The sandwiches here look amazing as well. Evidently made with fresh ingredients, they appeared generous in size and fulfilling in content. Beware that the spot is busy, and thus quite noisy with the chatter of patrons within. The place seems short-staffed, so I think it was hard to keep up with the number of orders. Consequently, it took longer for tables and spaces to be cleared out if customers didn't do it themselves. For those unfamiliar with the shop, it's worth noting the unusual payment system. You wait in line to place your order, and once you're ready to pay, you get back in line to pay. A bit inefficient to the American consumer (such as myself) but it works, I guess!"

Their tea mixes are absolutely delectable, i love their ginger tea that come with honey as well as the persian summer drink with cucumbers (I forget the name) and the jujube tea! The warm teas are a tad too sweet so I just keep asking them for more and more hot water and it still tastes good after the third cup!They have amazing pastries as well, my favourite is definitely the almond pear cake, just the right amount of sweetness. I've tried their brunch as well, very very good, it comes with many side dishes (baked grapefruit, cheese) but it is quite pricy ($20).Overall very cute place to study, do work, meet friends, date, etc."

Even their dishes are cute! I've come here to work or study and despite being a popular spot, it's pretty quiet & cozy!Their prices are slightly higher than the average independent cafe in Montreal but it's honestly marginal. They have tons of different types of tea so definitely check it out if you're a tea snob. I really like their tea latte. Good service, too!Cafe Aunja also hosts many events and they set up a hafseen in March for Persian new year.If you're visiting Montreal and staying downtown or visiting the Montreal Fine Arts Museum (Musee de Beaux Arts), I definitely recommend checking out Cafe Aunja.

The prices are not super cheap, but they are well worth the price. The first time I was there, I got to sit at the window seat with really cute plants next to me, with this beautiful cup of tea. It was so nice! And the service was really great too, the cashier kindly explain the menu and recommended according to what I wanted that day.

I ordered the Persian fragrance tea because I thought it sounded interesting. It ended up being hot water with a bunch of floating flowers and loose leaf tea. To be honest, it was quite overpriced and not worth it.Food wise I was a bit more impressed- I ordered the lentil soup and a roast beef sandwich. The soup was definitely home made and delicious. I just wish there was more of it. The roast beef sandwich was really rich and was quite a generous portion. It did leave me with a bit of a stomach ache though because it was so rich.In terms of a place to study, I don't think I'll be coming back here. The other customers were really load and kept bumping into my chair. Also I found it overpriced for what I got. Definitely a cute place for a coffee date though!"

It was like finding an oasis in the desert - although in this case it was more like finding a quiet and relaxing spot amidst chaos, booth babes and the smell of gasoline. It has now become my ritual, every time I stop in at Concordia, I get a latte here. And it never disappoints. The cafe is run by Iranians, which offer excellent coffees and teas as well as pastries.

Even though the ambience is still really nice, I disagree about the competitive pricing. Their drinks are definitely more expensive than elsewhere in downtown or plateau. I had their latte last time which tasted fair but I took their cappuccino this time which was super disappointing. It was served in a mug so I thought wow they are definitely serving coffee worth $4.00 but then I realized that 3/4th of the mug was literally foam. I know capuccino is supposed to be foamy but this was too frothy for me, I didn't get any real taste of the coffee. Actually I don't even know what I tasted, it wasn't coffee or milk or water. It didnt even smell that great and I added like four spoons of sugar to try and make it taste better. My brother took home made iced tea and couldn't finish it because the drink lacked flavour. My mother took homemade lemonade and I think they used lime instead of lemon because her drink was quite sour. They also don't have splenda. Still a great looking place but never returning back after this experience, sorry."

/user_details?userid=XxNd-LIlQE-K3cCajrFmtw,Mei Y.,"Tokyo, Japan",5 star rating,"had relaxing tea time for an hour and more. just looking from outside, you can know that this is a right cafe to try. all you can blend tea to share for 2-3per (7.50$), delicious fresh cake, cute cups, comfortable sofa, relaxing but fashionable atmosphere, lots tables, artistic website.i totally felt in love with this Iranian style tea service. you choose your pot, then mix your favourite herbs, dry flowers, fruits, teas, by yourself. all stuffs are so neatly and so beautifully presented in glass jars that you feel like you wanna try them all. i will definitely come back, for coffee next time:)"
/user_details?userid=zDbx3y1VEMIfd2H8gMLnBQ,Marie M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I am a fan because this café is really heart-warming. The place has a nice decoration and a enjoyable atmosphere. You can find books, a lot of tea boxes, chess (not sure) games, a couch and an old keyboard. Also, it is so close to ConcordiaI have been there 3 times, and I must say, my heart likes the place better than my wallet does... Indeed, the latte and the home-made lemonade were actually good (although I am usually not a huge fan of lemon things).  The tea I tasted was ok but could have been better if I had received good advice from the waiter (who did not look like he was passionate). Still, I will try not to go too often, as the prices are not the cheapest, but, well, I guess you also pay for the atmosphere and the cute little tea set they serve you in."
/user_details?userid=-IA6B9ErDJzXQl2NSBl85Q,Jenny B.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"2.5 stars. The place is really cute and cozy but the prices are a bit too high in my opinion. I got the hot chocolate which tasted good. It had a bit of a twist since I think they put cardamom in it. Maybe that's why they charge over 4 dollars for it, I don't know, but it was a good experience overall."
/user_details?userid=GZDBgqqE1Bp5WXS-_5EgzQ,Marianne C.,"Lachine, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great rustic, cozy, kind of bohemian vibe. Perfect if you're looking for a small, familiar place to study or get some peace. Not loud, but not completely quiet because it's a small space, but the comfort of the space makes up for that very easily. The food is great, not to mention their different pleasant drinks they offer. Nothing like any other café you've seen. They offer water and syrup based beverages, a couple being saffron syrup, hibiscus syrup, and rose as well, which are all super refreshing and tasty. Most importantly the ambiance is super unique as it has a home-y feel to it, with cozy couches and comfortable seats. If I could describe the setting in a more understandable way I'd say it's sort of bohemian, with a natural and earthy feel (no earthy scent though don't worry lol), and also extremely student friendly with many books displayed on the shelves all around the café. There is also free wifi. Regular coffee options are of course offered as well, for the less daring of the traditional Persian drinks. Again, they offer very good sandwiches and pastries, as well as ethnically different desserts as to what would be expected in other cafés, which is greatly appreciated. Great for after a long day at school, at the Museum of Fine Arts as it's only a short walk away, or simply a big day of walking around in the city. Would definitely recommend, and I come every time I come downtown :)"

It is beautifully decorated and has a nice vibe to it. The menu is good and the teas/coffees themselves are also good. A bit pricey, but worth it!"
/user_details?userid=Um-SfzKnn3KRcvDRWbS8Dg,Sepehr H.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Awful Place, Awful Service!Rude hosts, bad service, aggressive and unprofessional staff. The staff are untrained and have no idea about running a business. The staff are so aggressive they don't welcome costumers and while taking orders give attitude to the costumers. Their service is so bad it takes 45 mins to 1 h to have your order taken and another hour to receive your order wrong. They host private events during the public openings which makes the costumers so uncomfortable. The food quality is very low to be said and heavily competes with their service level. I strongly not recommend this place if you want a good food, good service and fun as these people are totally against all."
/user_details?userid=QeZMxNe-3wfmPpBhUW_Nuw,Chaman K.,"Fremont, CA",5 star rating,Very nice selection of teas.  The ambience is very warm. Perfect place to grab a hot cup of tea and sit back relax or read on a cold winter day.  Love the fact that they hive the option to mix and match their teas.
/user_details?userid=33l-DN8MYeyHk-K9dXXpZg,Esther G.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"A beautifully decorated Iranian tea place in downtown Montreal, near Concordia campus.Decor: The high point of this place is its beautiful inviting decor. Warm string lights and wooden floors, chalkboard menu and vintage furniture. Bookshelves.Drinks and food:I've only tried the special tea drinks: ginger & thyme and a mint tea. They come in mason jars and are very tasty.Hours: open til 10 p.m. Yay! :)Work-friendly:There are a few plugs for laptops, wifi is good. The chairs are mostly wooden. During the day, the atmosphere is quiet and work-friendly. There can sometimes be events at night. Staff and service:I've had mixed experiences with staff. One time service was super slow and they forgot to bring our order. But other times it was prompt. Again, one time the cashier was pretty unfriendly, but other times staff have been chatty and friendly. The owner is friendly and involved in the community and likes to host events (ex. readings, Nuit Blanche activities).You order at the counter, then pay at the end as you leave."

Great service, tasty food, and cute ambiance! Their sandwiches are delicious and the summer tea drinks are unique and refreshing. The waiter even gave us a few smaller drinks to try on the house. A little on the pricy side but well worth checking out if you're in the area."
/user_details?userid=4s_ZvmdpimzjhGRPPBNyaA,Kevin H.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,This place is great! I've only been here once but the atmosphere is perfect. It really charming and cozy. It wasn't noisy at all and it was the perfect place to talk. There was plenty of space when I went and the tables weren't cramped. They had a wide selection of teas as well as espresso and coffee. I would highly recommend this place!
/user_details?userid=tVl9JkeuEHGFH_ArkDKLCg,Emily H.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"I came with a friend to study here.  However, the waitress forgot my order a couple times. In between, she came and asked if I had ordered anything (she forgot my order). I had to remind the other waiter for my soup. We were asked to move tables, quite coldly. Overall, not an enjoyable experience."
/user_details?userid=AaNVt0_Y8q5h6O5Kmk5nMQ,Mari S.,"Manhattan, NY",3 star rating,"The place has a cute ambiance and you'd think they'd have a samovar if they were Persian but I think the place kind of does its own thing. Although the place does have Persian culture events, which is good.Other than that it is a rather overpriced, I spent 6.33 with tax on a ""tea"" that was literally some dried spices with a splash of rose water in a jar.I guess it's okay if you're in the area and looking for something different, I just wouldn't want to spend that much on a drink, but they have cheaper options."

What a charming little place. It's definitely unique in its own way. If you like to have a tea or coffee and enjoy a comforting environment while reading a book or doing some work this is the place.
/user_details?userid=4X09ImE0Gh13CbSH1yDwdQ,Curtis D.,"Quincy, MA",5 star rating,"TRULY ADORABLE, FUN AND UNIQUE. This cafe offers a wide variety of hot/iced drinks you won't find anywhere else. Everyone in my party was incredibly impressed by everything in the cafe. Although the floating herbs in my Persian fragrance were at times distracting, the beautiful artwork and super cute (and jazzy!) atmosphere definitely made up for it. Absolutely check out this cafe after a day at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, or any other time!"
/user_details?userid=TsD6a1t08IcH1E6hq2GprQ,Joanna A.,"Lafayette, CA",5 star rating,Very warm and welcoming atmosphere. I had a short stay in Montreal and I visited this place. I really loved it. Get some herbal tea. You won't regret it.

Cuz holy moly, a small pot of herbal tea for 5 dollars? It was just chamomile! But I did spend two hours here reading and it was quiet and there are lots of outlets."
/user_details?userid=7SlXP7iFs73YctXW6lNO3A,Atefe R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The place is AWESOME!! I love it more than any place in Montreal. I feel comfortable and relaxed whenever I am at Cafe Aunja. The owners are so friendly, when you enter the place they smile at you and during their service they behave as if you are at one of your best friend's place. They have a creative choice of mix and match that you can mix any kind of tea with additives of your choice! I love to seat there for hours and hours and read books or talk to a friend in a cozy environment. I love this place and it's my first choice whenever I want to feel home while not going home!"

I was a bit disappointed in their mint lemonade, I expected it to be blended together, but it was just a lemonade with mint leaves in it (which is good too, but not what I expected)."
