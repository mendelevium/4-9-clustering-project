It could've had a smokier flavor, but it was truly delicious. Served with a side of homemade slaw & a bottle of water, it was just slightly overpriced.Considering it's in the heart of Vieux Montréal, right on the waterfront, it's a good deal."
/user_details?userid=hwSSM8Jn29dXRW4ym-roDQ,Mel T.,"Hoboken, NJ",4 star rating,"I heard that smoked meat was something you should eat while in Canada. My BF and I were exploring Old Montreal and needed a lunch spot, so a quick Yelp search helped us find Smoking Meat. We ordered the smoked meat trio and the poutine with smoked meat. The smoked meat trio includes a sandwich, cole slaw, and water. I've never had Canadian smoked meat before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought it would be a lot smokier, but I'm glad it wasn't. It reminded me of NYC corned beef sammies. The poutine with the smoked meat was also great. This was definitely enough food for two people, especially since the poutine is so heavy.We actually thought we ordered the smoked meat plate, which includes all of the items from the trio, plus a pickle and more french fries. When we asked them about it, we realized that we probably just ordered the wrong thing. However, they brought us out some extra fries (which we definitely didn't need), but it was really nice of them to do so. It was a nice textural change from the gravy-soaked fries we had been eating.Overall, it was a great meal - but definitely not something that I could eat that often."

So I found the Smoking Meat on Yelp!  Luckily it was a short walk. The Smoking Meat specializes in Smoked Meats and with their sandwiches you can choose either smoked beef, pork, or turkey. We all chose The Smoked Meat Trio with Beef.  While waiting I started talking with one of the Staff and she stated all the meats are local to Quebec and there are no preservatives or hormones used in their meats!  The Trio came with bottle water and cole slaw as well.  I couldn't wait to get back to eat the sandwich, it smelled so good!  We were not disappointed, this sandwich was incredible!!!  The Meat was tender and juicy and very flavorful!  Everyone was surprised how great it tasted!  Smoking Meat deserves more than 5 Stars !!"
/user_details?userid=itNrmwmb2Tm-LKkh2kbBAg,Val D.,"Honolulu, HI",3 star rating,"This restaurant is over ratedAlthough they are the only restaurant in the area within the older town of Montreal, near the Notre dame, I didn't think their smoked meat was as great as I tasted in the outskirts of montreal.The smoked meat was salty, oily and expensive, the poutine wasn't the best either.  Such a small portion that was expensive, probably because it was in a tourist area.Don't think I'd eat here again unless I can't get out of the older montreal area because there's other places much less oily and more reasonable."

If you want to taste quality local smoked meats Made by locals... This is definitely the place for youA breath of fresh air and a tourist trap areaService and food was excellent
/user_details?userid=Z8MQ8HXITQj0715Nmia2yQ,Neha M.,"Garfield, NJ",5 star rating,This was my favorite meal in MontrealMoist juicy pork stuffed between two thin slices of bread.  It doesn't come with any dressing but I asked for some mustard and it went perfectly with the sandwichIncluded for around $13 you get a bottle of water and a side of cole slawIt doesn't look like a lot of food but they include a lot of meat so it's very fillingA few spots to sit outside and you can sit inside as wellHighly recommended!!!!
/user_details?userid=BRrCcN_zCw2cRH4I28JlwQ,Melissa H.,"Draper, UT",4 star rating,"This place is about the meat and. I thing but the meat. All side dishes are just showing up to the party. The meat is the party! My husband and I both got smoked meat sandwiches in a combo that comes with forgettable coleslaw and a bottled water. Then, we want back in and got smoked meat poutine because the meat demanded to be eaten. Yes, this is a tourist-trap location, but we two tourists were blissfully trapped there gnoshing on artery-clogging goodness while we waited out a sudden summer thunderstorm, and we were happy to pay the price (the price being a lot of money). To be frank, I haven't had a lot of smoked meat exposure, so I don't have a lot to compare this place to, but I still dream of that smoked beef sometimes."
/user_details?userid=kwMCA3SdLXHa2wYicwRtYw,Rima Q.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5 star rating,"Best smoked meat I've ever had. We had the beef sandwich and poutine. Hands down best smoked meat we've had in a while, highly recommended. Meat melts in your mouth and us very flavorful. Staff was very friendly and the place was clean. I can't wait to come back and have some more."
/user_details?userid=tergDCzIUaILntLpGrR0Sw,George L.,"Juneau, AK",5 star rating,"Best Montreal smoked meat sandwich I've tasted on this visit.  Unlike Schwartz's disappointing dry lackluster smoked meat sandwich, the smoked meat sandwich here was really truly amazing to the taste buds at first bite."
/user_details?userid=mHcIAmrQzswxZv58lOQZLg,L SCculmum C.,"San Clemente, CA",1 star rating,"This is NOT even close to the best smoked meat in Montreal, nor is the poutine very good.  And the service needs a lot of improvement.We arrived here at noon wanting to get a quick bite of the famous Montreal Smoked meat.  No one else was in the restaurant, we ordered 2 sandwiches and a poutine and sat down.  They were clearly not prepared for even 2 orders at noon.20+ minutes later, we had yet to get our sandwiches, while a number of other people came in and paid to sit and wait for their sandwiches. When the food did come, the fries were undercooked with bland poutine sauce that just created a bland, mushy mess.  The smoked meat was NOT the best smoked meat by a far cry, as well.  Tender, but served out of prepacked pouches, heated up in hot water, then cut open onto the bread.  Over spiced compared to your typical Montreal smoked meat.  Go to Dunn's or Lester's or the Montreal Pool Room (old icon.)For Poutine, go around the corner to Montreal Poutine."

/user_details?userid=3ef9du3AsQtCwK1Z_CuLpg,Howard H.,"Flushing, NY",4 star rating,"I'm surprised I'm the first person to review this place.  Located just off the main entrance to the  Old Port of Montreal, it's easy to miss this establishment.  I've heard that smoked meat is a Montreal specialty and this place gave me my first taste.  Not disappointed.The menu gives you 3 choices of smoked meat (beef, pork and kobe beef).  Each sandwich comes with cole slaw (made here with mustard as a base, not mayo) and is carved to order.  There is also poutine and artisanal soda if you're interested.  The smoked beef was excellent and tastes a lot like pastrami for those looking for a comparison.  The best bite though was the smoked pork which was akin to having a mildly sweet honey ham but without all the salt.  Each bite was great.  The poutine was also slightly different here as they used whole roasted new potatoes instead of fries.  As can be expected in a tourist area, the prices are probably higher than if you had something similar in other parts of Montreal ($14 bucks Canadian per sandwich) but its reasonable for the area and honestly tasted better than anything I've eaten in the general vicinity.  Thumbs up."

Place is clean with ample seats, menu in English or French.We had the sandwich plate, beef. It was a little disappointing to see the meat on our sandwich came from a vacuum sealed bag... but it was still tasty. Just would love something more fresh. Everything was pre-made but it still took 20 minutes to get our food and the place was empty. Fries were served cold.We ordered white sangria, but were given red. We had to ask three times for the water that was included with our meal. Honestly save your money and go somewhere else."

/user_details?userid=JnfDqQIweAiHp2Rop3BIzQ,Martin G.,"Sunnyside, NY",4 star rating,"We stopped in to have sandwiches and a couple beers in Old Montréal. We tried the beef and pork; they were both excellent. We also ordered the potato wedges - these were mediocre. A couple of bottles of water were included at no cost. Overall it seemed a bit overpriced, but as tourists in Montreal it was worth the experience for a convenient and tasty lunch."
/user_details?userid=8FYweH-M6tZf1sCibob8qg,Kasia A.,"Southampton, PA",5 star rating,The best! If you are looking for a traditional Montreal smoked meat STOP right here! This is your place! The meat was fantastic! Melts on your mouth absolutely delicious!!!

/user_details?userid=kBFb2l1OmfQ-zLOR1d112Q,Chris H.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,I was looking for a place to try Montreal smoked meat near the convention center and decided to pick up some sandwiches here for lunch. The place was empty and I see a counter with what looks to be individual packets of meat. I think surely this place isn't just selling prepackaged meat and claiming that it's any good. Sure enough when I ordered my sandwiches I see the guy behind the counter rip open one of these packets for each and put it on some bread with mustard....and it's incredibly delicious. I've had plenty of corned beef style sandwiches before and this was something unique. The meat is incredibly smoky and spiced really well. But the most important thing is how tender it is. The beef just absolutely melts in your mouth in a way New York pastrami doesn't. It was wonderful.I can't comment on the service or anything else on the menu but these sandwiches were great and highly recommended.
/user_details?userid=ubvRnIVr3uaYoPyC2hiY1Q,Craig P.,"Theater District, Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"Some excellent lunch with the family on our road trip. The smoked meat here is ridiculously good. Friendly staff, cool overhead music, and delicious food. The smoked meat poutine with either a beer or the bulls head blood orange soda and you're set. Quality meat with a great hickory smoke and the potatoes are baked... a nice alternative. Thanks for a great lunch."

He made the best sangria that ive ever had.My husband and I shared a pork plate and it was the juiciest and most flavorful meat ever. The seasoning is unusual and it left me wanting more. We travel alot and since hubby is paleo, we're always eating smoked meats but this was the bomb!!Please go and support this young business!!"
/user_details?userid=5l4PETuuSGccqwM_uf_3YA,Jordan S.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"With all my visits to Montreal and what people have been raving about it as the top 3 to get in mtl (poutine, maple syrup, and smoked meat) so I defiantly had to see what the hype was all about. I came here and ordered a smoked meat sandwich and a beer and ahh man let me tell you, coming from NYC with our roost beef and ruebens, this by far was awesome. The meat was tender and soft as if they cared and loved for it before shipping it to the store. Honestly, when looking at it, it looks like a regular sandwich but that 1st bite full of flavor makes you want to buy another one before even finishing the entire sandwich. *fyi I had smoked meat poutine at another place the following night and the meat did not compare with the sandwich"
/user_details?userid=8AzFQas1NEZM4PIdQqI5ig,Jason S.,"San Jose, CA",5 star rating,"Wow, what a great place! All 3 meat options are amazing, the beef is my favorite though, pork would be second then the turkey. Friendly staff and nice patio seating with a view of the water (kind of). I'll be back for sure... if you're looking for a good smoked meat sandwich in old town, this is the place!"
/user_details?userid=V3MobZ-Bvg-hnp7Y-QPcOg,Aarani P.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"This place was great.  We were in town from Toronto for the weekend and one of my friends insisted that we stop by here on our way back home.  It was about noon on a Sunday and I was surprised that the place was empty. I would have thought a place like that would be packed in that part of town on a weekend. Between my group of friends, I think we tried it all: beef, pork and turkey, and they were all delicious.  I tried the turkey after eating half my own pork sandwich so the taste was a lot more subtle and I felt like I could only taste the mustard but my friend that only had the turkey loved it. The sandwiches are authentic, just comes on rye with the meat and mustard and it's served with a bottle of water and coleslaw. Comes to $16. And if you really love it, You can even take some meat home with you!"
/user_details?userid=ykqBmi8ecMj2REig7pkRKA,Vincenzo L.,"Northford, CT",3 star rating,"Came here because it was pouring rain out and didn't have tons of options. We wanted poutine and they offer it with smoked meat on top. Their poutine isn't made with fries, rather, full potatoes. Not a poutine expert, but I didn't love it. Flavor was missing something and there was too much gravy. They do have a great Kobe beef selection."
/user_details?userid=YbVm1NjsrNJbfISERRzXmQ,D'Arcy C.,"Scranton, PA",1 star rating,If your looking for a good meal keep walking. This is not smoked meat that Montreal is known for.  Yelp fail on this.
/user_details?userid=UZkry_l-m_YOUljklzLZEg,Sinclair S.,"Makiki, Honolulu, HI",5 star rating,"You have to stop here: hands down, the best beef sandwich I've ever had; and I've had a lot of beef sandwiches. The beef is the softest and tastiest beef I've ever tasted; you don't even need teeth to eat the meat - it's that soft - the taste is incredible, and the after taste is just as amazing. It will leave a lasting impression on your soul; I'm not kidding. Here's why it's like nothing you've ever had: they smoke the local, organic beef, then cook it for 72 hours, using a space-age technique that will blow your mind. Buy a smoked beef sandwich from Smoking Meat, and you will never forget it."
