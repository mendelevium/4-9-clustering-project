/user_details?userid=ahDxPzmaQuSOQtQMvZryZw,Anthony B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Ordered from UberEats while in quarantine. I got the 4 piece combo which is a lot of food, but amazingly it's priced at $16! The chicken pieces were huge! It had 3 thighs and 1 drumstick. Plus a small portion of friesYou can choose seasoning between classic or spicy. I did spicy and it wasn't overwhelming. Despite being in a box through delivery, the chicken wasn't soupy and still was extra crispy which I did not expect at all. You can choose multiple sauces like gravy, honey mustard, thai. I did honey mustard which was good but I don't think they give you enough. Thankfully I ordered extra ($1)"
/user_details?userid=jQUVYLCDNeZKyZsb_GPT6Q,Darren S.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Consistently inconsistent.  It's a shame, the only food served here - fried chicken - is really good, but they're often out of the only product they sell.  Once I got to the service window (street level) and unexpectedly interrupted a game of cards, between employees, only to be told it's a 15-20 minute wait to make more.  This was at 5pm and I would have expected them to be prepared for a dinner rush.  Chicken wings, tenders, pop-corn chicken, and traditional fried chicken are really well made, but don't get your hopes up - this place is unfortunately, consistently inconsistent.  I'd have given this place five stars, based solely on the fried-chicken they sell, but I have often been disappointed when they're unprepared or ready for their clients.I write this review respectfully, in the hope that it is received as constructive criticism, because I'd like to see this place stick around.  But until they choose to work on their reliability, try the St-Catherine Street location - they've been reliable when this branch inevitably comes up short."
/user_details?userid=iVXISIgh-unsJz57-qOHTQ,Sheryl L.,"Candiac, Canada",3 star rating,"I was really indifferent about this place - is heard some good things and some bad things, but I finally caved and decided to try it for myself. Sad to say really not that great,i was stuck between a 2.5-3. I was only tasting so I took 2 pieces for 5.75$ plus tax makes 7.$ there was 1 thigh and one breast. They have a choice between regular fried chicken and spicy fried chicken. I took the spicy fried chicken. The chicken was warm and crispy on the outside, it wasn't spicy so much as zesty. One thing I noticed was the inside of one the chicken pieces was still a little red/pink,so not fully cooked. (I know USDA says you can still eat but I rather be 100% sure my chicken is cooked)I definitely rather Mon Ami fried chicken. But if you live around the corner or you're in Chinatown and you have an itch for fried chicken then it'll do. Just make sure to tell them to fully cook the chicken. (Ain't no one out here trying to get Salmonella)."
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Let me tell you about this wonderful place that's in its soft opening right now: the chicken is hot and juicy as soon as you bite in, and the crumbing is crispy and tasty. It's not too greasy under the skin, and not too salty either. We had the spicy version, which had a comfortable heat level. The place is tiny, but is cheerfully branded with its vibrant yellow color and cheeky name. A real contender for best fried chicken in town! Much better than KFC! Not cheap but give it a try - we didn't regret it for sure.Note: soft opening special price: two pieces for 5.75$"
/user_details?userid=I7Fmd8WQA0FozWOEZQNdkw,Lana S.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,In a little hole in the wall place in Chinatown there is this chicken place. First off the wait for this chicken took forever. It's fine since it seems like they cook it as you order so you know it hasn't been sitting there all day when you come to order it.There was also a bunch of people ordering chicken at the time so they were kinda backed up. I waited prob like 20 mins for my popcorn chicken to come out. The chicken comes in this brown bag hot and fresh. Man this chicken is the best I've had in a long time. It's juicy and crispy and seasoned very well. I ate up every piece. You also get a lot for the price you pay! I even ate some the next day cold and it was still pretty amazing. Yummm def. Will come back here next time I'm in town !
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Very unimpressed by this place. After reading the few good reviews about this place, I finally caved and went in to order 2 x 5$ deal. I chose regular and spicy. The spicy isn't hot spicy but rather very peppery. The chicken was so salty and barely had any batter on it. One piece even came pink (not fully cooked). The service was horrible and truth be told, I just wanted to cancel my order but my parents wanted to try the food. NOT COMING BACK"
/user_details?userid=qfCHqKbLR48haYCM3As_AQ,Alex F.,"Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Tiny little shop in Chinatown Montreal. I saw a couple people lining up at this shop, that's why I got curious and stayed. I bought a box of chicken with sauces. It was tender, juicy and crispy on the outside. Definitely did not expect that! I enjoyed it at the park next to the shop."

First of all, I don't know about you but when I see someone taking money with their hands and then grab the food with those dirty hands without GLOVES, it is a HUGE NO! I said it is okay for this time ill take a bite even with no gloves, THE CHICKEN was litteraly pink inside, i was so shocked and fuming so I threw it, I couldnt take any picture to show you guys. So yes I wasn't happy :( lol"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Tried the spicy chicken wings during their soft opening. It was crispy on the outside, not too oily and perfectly spicy. You can get it with different sauce such as sweet chili or honey mustard. The staff were nice. Although the service was a bit long, you know that they made it fresh. The place is very small and doesn't have any seatings."
/user_details?userid=_qdT_krST291RmFc6x6kaQ,Nate S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,This chicken is *amazing*. I'm originally from Texas and I would almost prefer this fried chicken over any fried chicken I could get in Texas. The plum seasoning is genius and the breading is just perfect. I hadn't really liked the coleslaw in Montreal since moving here. I've found that it is the polar opposite of what you would get in a traditional southern meal. But Le Coq Frit nailed it. It is savory with just enough acidity. If you're in the mood for fried chicken this is the place to check out.
/user_details?userid=GbDfPbqp7gKRwbn116KDSA,Ben K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The chicken.... is A-OK. To fries... OK. Everything is OK. OK? The spicy chicken had a hint of spice, Sichuan peppercorns perhaps? Interesting twist. Still a tad greasy for my liking. Fries were crispy. Spicy mayo is nothing special, coleslaw unremarkable. But OK.Chicken: 6/10Fries: 5.7/10Spicy mayo: 3.8/10Coleslaw: 5.5/10I decided to do an experiment. How would I feel biking up Berri after eating a 3 piece combo with a bag full of Chinese groceries? I'll save you the trouble by doing it myself. Well, wait no further, the results are in!! Feelings of self-worth: 4/10Attractiveness: 3.7/10Breath: 8/10General pleasantness of odour: 7/10Desire to improve myself: 3/10Ability to defend self in case of zombie apocalypse: 0.6/10Flatulence: 7.4/10"
/user_details?userid=--hnxy9WqKkqy3EgyLawYg,Saurabh S.,"Washington, DC",2 star rating,Ordered a four piece combo today. Great Service!They really have the spices down. The batter was crispy and everything. Here why I am giving them 2 stars.2 pieces out of 4 had pink and uncooked meat in the middle. I had to throw them away. P.S. Please use a pair of tongs/gloves to handle food
/user_details?userid=bH--sW5TemoGHFDS5mkUbQ,Jazzy13023 J.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Chicken reminds me of Popeyes . It was nice and spicy . Got it at the special price . The chicken wasn't cooked on the inside . It was still a bit pink . There's nothing I hate more than chicken that is not cooked . I bought 2 pieces . Only one of the pieces wasn't cooked all the way through , the other piece was . There's long line ups right now but not sure for the future ."
/user_details?userid=0xyal1lbo7EiPs0s29k8Lw,Jon W.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"Was listed as open on Victoria day, it wasn't. I wish they would update their listing. The portions are excellent and the quality is great! They removed the ""combo"" of fries and a salad, and now it's one or the other. I enjoyed it. I'm not a spice lord, so when my friend convinced me to try it with spice, I went for it. To my pallet, it didn't allow me to enjoy it as much, so next time I'll try it in the traditional style."

Go to china town and cop yourself some of this
/user_details?userid=3FrXYUTywEhmO8rTMq18XA,John J.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Montreal has a serious fried chicken problem. I could go on and rage about the lack of truly good fast food fried chicken a la churches chicken, popeyes, etc..Le Coq Frit is therefore a welcome addition. They have pretty good fried chicken, as well as chicken tenders and popcorn chicken. I haven't tried the wings but you can't really go wrong with either. I always take it spicy. It's not actually spicy, but it is well seasoned and flavourful.The fries unfortunately are greasy and lacking. The coleslaw is also pretty disappointing. I find that the staff frequently forget things or make mistakes. They're always forgetting sauces or putting the wrong ones (sauce isn't free by the way).Note that there is no seating inside, in the summer, you can eat it in the benches outside. During the winter though you'll probably be taking it home or ordering delivery."
/user_details?userid=CtBx4yk_QM8ClITgw94TPQ,Simon P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"That is some tasty fried chicken. I had the popcorn chicken and the fingers - both were excellent. I couldn't really tell the difference between both, maybe the fingers seemed like a chunk of several popcorn pieces together? Doesn't matter. I loved it, planning to go back for more. Loved the garlic and spicy powder too."
/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,No frills fried chicken. This place is about the size of my closet with no seating and no real room to wait for your order. They give you a number and you wait out in the street. They only serve dark meat for some reason. I ordered spicey wings which are similar to Popeye's but smaller and not quite as spicey. The wings were decent but nothing worth writing home about and the experience of ordering and odd waiting queue was sub-par.

/user_details?userid=dDbQF6OqEGkl0KtppbKtMw,Kat T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Every friend of mine claims this place makes the best fried popcorn chicken than everybody else. But I beg to differ! First, they use too much batter to make them, it may be different than KFC because they make the popcorn chicken different sizes and shapes, but all I'd tasted when I had bought it, was the batters!"
/user_details?userid=xjZOqBiFoIk4YLNv7QTgVA,Bader H.,"Pierrefonds, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow this place is now my go-to. I was so impressed by the wings that it fulfilled every last craving I had for Popeyes (in every province other than here for some reason). I did see that some people weren't fans of their fries, so I skipped on those. I asked for the spicy, which really hit the spot in terms of spice. Overall, it was super crispy and tender."

I'm so glad that I can just have some amazing fried chicken so close to McGill. They have spicy and regular fried chicken, both are amazing. They have some great popcorn chicken and chicken wings too which I simply loved! Sometimes I go three times a week, LOL!"

/user_details?userid=SW6vc_EBzRhCuJkuVguj2g,Rob N.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,Just walked in during regular business hours and I was turned away. They said they  had too many orders to take any more.  What a joke....won't be going back.
/user_details?userid=StLnPVD9lap9CmRVOcscCg,Jake P.,"Terrebonne, Canada",1 star rating,"Worst customer service ever. First off the two employees were bickering in the place making it very awkward, and unprofessional. They ran out of everything except for the chicken. Which was good by the way. However, what really made me want to give them one star was that when they split our order because it was one spicier than the other they put the non spicy chicken in a brown paper bag, and the other in the right container. I'm sorry, but we paid for those chickens we should've gotten them in equal containers. Also there was no cutlery or even napkins. At that point I don't care if its good if they can not even give the basic necessities why should I believe that they are operating in according to health laws, and that they aren't grossly committing negligence which could get me sick in the long run."
/user_details?userid=VXH0NBv_QSC8ygQLDbEqow,Mandi L.,"Marlton, Evesham Township, NJ",5 star rating,Stopped by with my boyfriend to get a quick bite of fried chicken. I asked if we could switch their $5 thigh and drumstick combo to just drumsticks since we were exploring Chinatown and they were so sweet and accommodating even though they were running out of drumsticks. Some of the best spicy fried chicken I've had. Will definitely come back when we get the chance!
