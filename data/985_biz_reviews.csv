The aged beef skewers were smoky. The Agedashi Tofu, sweet and flavourful. The KokoSando chicken sandwich was crispy, cheesy and packed with veggies, and was perfectly complimented by the Â Furikake Homemade fries. The tiger rolls were full of fresh fish and and had an abundance of fresh veggies.A few small things to iron out, but overall a pretty tasty experience.Instagram: @kokochiizakaya"
