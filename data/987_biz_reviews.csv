/user_details?userid=pwIZ8XOrHgBNZaqLsfke3g,Kathy D.,"Fort Pierce, FL",5 star rating,"Absolute 5 stars on all points,freshness, food quality, service, cold beer! This diner is an icon of Montreal and has been in business since the early 50's. My husband and I both had the club sandwich loaded with fresh chicken, bacon cooked perfectly, lettuce and tomato on white toast. The beer a Molson export was icy cold and delicious. The fries were freshly made and great. Coleslaw was the perfect deli slaw. We will be telling all our friends about this treasure."
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The food is ok. Nothing out of this world but the portions are quite generous! They open quite early during weekdays and if you're thinking of having lunch there (weekdays) expect the place to be loud and full. With all the construction workers! Service is...BLAH. They could use an upgrade in that department. As for the prices, i would say it's fair. My husband really enjoy their smoked meat poutine. Breakfast is cheap... Like i mentioned. This place is an OK place :)"
/user_details?userid=xc3rLVAjv7TwzEbWDYNuNw,Alan S.,"Brookline, MA",5 star rating,"A really nice place with great food ( we had breakfast) great staff, and great everything else.  For breakfast if you go early enough, I think, before 8:00, they have a super unadvertised special of eggs bacon sausage toast and fruit. My wife who hates everything says she'll go back in a heartbeat, so it's got to be good."
/user_details?userid=ZJ4WgwHAiZ7E-V__bnmeUg,George A.,"Estero, FL",5 star rating,"The owners are fresh-obsessed, so you will find that reflected in the ingredients and taste.  A full menu provides something for everyone.  Popular for a reason."
/user_details?userid=N00DJ1BXSSXAQYdn-qVPLg,Greg C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Consistent quality food with exceptional top notch customer service.  My favorite take-out for chicken brochette and a perfect slice of homemade sugar or pecan pie.
/user_details?userid=-M6KuotrnLBTX426Hjie6w,Elviera H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We try this restaurant as it is only accross the street from our building. The pizza was loaded with all kind of meat, generous topping but somewhat its dry. The picture of the smoke meat looks better than the food itself... But the waiter was super friendly."
/user_details?userid=PRbWvEUHs6OATosoVzsK2A,Jacob R.,"Richmond, VA",5 star rating,Very good food for a very good price. Diner style food and excellent service. One of the best diner style restaurants in Montreal
/user_details?userid=4ksA9js7Bvm4P7PCEUJMVw,Sandeep J.,"Brampton, Canada",5 star rating,"The food was delicious and the staff was great and helpful. Pancakes were even more delicious. No complaints at all, and I'd recommend going to this place for breakfast to anyone."
/user_details?userid=Fi8oTWODfqN9aJu3Yd-2dQ,Jeffrey M.,"London, United Kingdom",3 star rating,"This place doesn't look like much from the outside.Heck, it doesn't look like much from the inside either.But the food wasn't half bad!I ordered the Steak Hache, which came with:   Salad -- bland lettuce, nothing to write home about.   Bread roll -- prewarmed :)   Steak -- FANTASTIC.  Onions were grilled just right, the brown sauce was the right amount of unhealthy and umami, and the steak was cooked perfectly.  Also, their potatoes -- SO GOOOOOOOOOOOD.  I was so full, and that much meat (8 oz I think!) for just $8 at a sit-down restaurant ... heck yeah man.They also have weird 'Chinese' dishes, like smoked meat fried rice.  My dad always wanted me to marry a Jew lol.Apparently it's a Greek place, and kebobs are their specialties.  Take advantage of their dinner and weekend deals -- cheaper meals during special hours =]And the waitstaff speak English AND French!  I know it's Montreal, and this isn't anything special, but it's really refreshing.  My waitress also didn't switch to English even though my accent is pretty severe.  Extra points =]"
/user_details?userid=TWhElI-jmqXb5Z-AbZyTAw,Douglas M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Was staying at the hotel next door when I moved to Montreal.  I had just got in from Australia and was jet lagged as all else. Started going there right early. Great breakfast and the women who works there is really nice. By the second day she knew what we wanted to drink and had it on the table. I still walk twice as far to go there even though I live in Old Montreal.
/user_details?userid=kzoDmxs4_XuzGwIbXWMBoA,Eugene B.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,Great spot to pick up a French-style breakfast in Montreal. Prices are reasonable and the waitress was very nice! Full of locals and hospital employees from across the street. Will definitely be coming back on my next visit to Montreal!
/user_details?userid=0bd82GICAfFnLWYlZpMsXQ,Casey D.,"Los Angeles, CA",2 star rating,"Good lunch deals: $9-$13 for main course with coffee, dessert and soup.But food was less than average.Despite that the place was packed with locals."
