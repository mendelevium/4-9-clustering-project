/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This place reminds me of the food that you would get in a shopping mall food court. The food here isn't good. It's not discussing, just bad. I wanted to try something new for lunch and while walking on St Denis, I came across their menu outside. A bento meal seemed like a good idea. A little bit of everything. I was so disappointed. The salmon was dry and over cooked, the rice was mushy and the avocado pieces in the rolls weren't fresh... Granted it wasn't expensive but I've eaten better at a better fare. Service is nice though but I won't be returning here."
/user_details?userid=Mf2qbfUmZePsH8ytO_DGqQ,Jacqueline K.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,Don't know if this is the only restaurant along Saint-Denis or the Latin Quarter for that matter that specializes in this cuisine but the service as the majority of the rest of French Montreal demeanor presumably is as is its so post to be :( ....... but the miso soup was ok and at a reasonable price.

The service was very quick and the inside of the restaurant was nice and clean.The food was very good and only a bit more expensive (a few dollars) than what I usually pay for."
