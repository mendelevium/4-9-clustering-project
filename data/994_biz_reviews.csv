They offered a tapas style menu that was incredible. The chef was waiting outside for us when we arrived, and she gave us a warm welcome to the restaurant. The server was attentive, and described the food in a way that divulged her passion for the menu. This was a farm to table event, where all the ingredients were fresh locally sourced produce. We ended up getting several items on the menu, as well as a mojito (""the fidel"") and a spiked lemonade made with Sumac (""sumacade""). We ordered the kale chips, the quail, a tasting platter with several cheese, their weekly special, their quail egg with kale chips and a Portuguese-style custard tart for dessert. This was truly an experience. The food was prepared quickly, and everything was so flavorful. I especially enjoyed their cabbage, which was julienne'd and incredible well seasoned. Their bacon was thick and juicy, and the fats just melted away. Lola was really nice and it was great getting to talk to her after the meal.This is a fantastic project, and I absolutely loved the experience."

Being a fan of pop up restaurants, I decided to check it out with my social foodie group after seeing it on Eater Montreal. I started off with a mojito made with authentic Cuban mint and organic cane sugar; the cocktail was flavourful and refreshing, although it could have used some more alcohol. My second cocktail, a sumac lemonade was tasty but also lacked some punch. The rest of the group tried some local wine which they thoroughly enjoyed; and at 36$ a bottle, who can blame them! As for the food, we shared a variety of plates including a tomato salad with whipped goat cheese,  carrots with almonds, cheese and raisins, pasta with a basil and kale pesto, pepper and eggplant dips with focaccia, and deep fried pickled fiddleheads with maple. Every dish was excellently prepared, and although some dishes may have lacked in presentation, the flavours and textures were just plain delicious! We so enjoyed the fiddleheads, that they whipped up the same recipe using garlic scapes instead when we wanted a third serving; this was off the menu but the garlic scapes were better than the fiddleheads, if that was even possible. For desert, we had a choice between a pumpkin panna cotta or zucchini bread; we tried both. The panna cotta was so yummy, and the zucchini bread sweetened with their own artisanal maple syrup was delightful. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our evening, and left the restaurant content, full and our wallets still full; the quality and flavour of these plates were not only affordable but really delicious! We also enjoyed learning about Terra Perma, their land, and offered activities and products. The bad part of a pop up is that it will not be around for long, but we agreed that the delicious menu featuring fresh ingredients, creative flavours, and textures, will surely be remembered."

From the friendly service, to the delicious food, it was a unique culinary experience.My favourite part was meeting the lovely owner Laurence, who is lively and so accommodating. I enjoyed getting to know her story while waiting for our food.We ordered a bunch of tapas-style plates and were left impressed. You can really taste the difference in the ingredients. Our favourite plates of the night were the pesto pasta, kale chips, cheese board and panna cota dessert. Delicious!! If you find out that terra perma is hosting another pop up resto in Montreal, do yourselves a favour and go!!"

The restaurant was very quiet and the staff was very attentive. All the options on the menu looked delicious, so we had a really hard time picking the ones we were going to try. We ended up getting the kale chips, the quail, the tasting platter, the weekly special, the quail egg, a dessert and two drinks (the fidel and the sumacade). We were wondering if it was going to be filling enough, since we were rather hungry and these are all tapas. Spoiler alert, we were SO FULL!!! The kale chips were well seasoned and super crispy. the goat cheese and the beet puree that came with them were delicious. We could barely resist licking the plate! the Tasting platter came with relish, cabbage, bacon, cheese, 2 types of veggie dips and huge pieces of bread. Everything was INCREDIBLE!! I can't even describe de flavour. You really have to try for yourself. In the dishes that we ordered, three of them had a side made with cabbage and bacon. You'd think that after eating it three times we'd get sick of it, but NOPE! It just tastes better each time!!!I could go on and tell you how great the food is, but the truth is that you really have to try for yourself. I promise that you won't regret it! Chez Fabergé is a project by Terra Perma. They grow and cook the veggies themselves. It was great talking to Lola after the meal and getting to learn more about this project. They're only open for a limited time, so go go go!"
