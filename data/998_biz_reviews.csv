Luckily it wasn't so busy, given everyone has been staying home! I was just walking by and I saw that they had a smoothie bar which was great and what I wanted! Then I saw that they had popsicles and my mind exploded! The flavours are out of this world and only $4 a pop, it was definitely worth trying! I had the mango lime and it was divine! Not too sweet but all the flavours were there! It was so good! I can't wait to go back for the pina colada flavour!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Delicious and refreshing popsicle. It's the perfect summer snack while walking around old port. They have many kinds to choose from. We tried the passionfruit one as well as the blueberry lemonade. They were both very fruity and natural. Definitely worth the price and would go back to try them all!
/user_details?userid=7PTwhPEM7VWclYIS_1dSiw,Jéssica C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is super cute and a great little pit stop if you're walking around Old Port! The waffles cost around 5-6$ depending on how much stuff you put into it. The ldy that seems to own it is super nice and friendly! You might hve to wait a bit if ahe's alone though, which disn't necessarily bothered me and my friend.I got the dark chocolte banana waffle and I was pretty hppy with my choice! If you want it very ""chocolatty"" make sure to ask for extra (which will cost you an extra $ hehe) because they don't really put a lot.The dough was sweet enough though! My friend got Nutella with banana and peanuts and she was also very happy with her choice. Also the cute little shop will keep you fairly entertained if you have to wait! Take some time to take photos on the cute swing (which I'm a big sucker for!)"

Beautiful little store a little warm but the pretty decor made up for it.We had a Excellent experience as we were not sureWhat to pick and what toppings would go with what. Answer is all ! I had salted caramel with blueberries and peanuts. Salted caramel and berries withPeanuts what's not to like, all served on a warm waffle.They aren't very big but they are soFull of flavour it makes up for it.The boozie pops are next on my list, they had a lotOf flavours but the lemonade one stuckOut to me most with berries !18+ over course because they're 5% :)"
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Very cool spot in the heart of old Montreal. Their main specialties are waffles and wide variety of gourmet popsicles. It was a hard battle to pick between their delicious waffles and their fresh popsicles but I ended up going with the mango and lime lovepop. It was absolutely heavenly and there was a perfect ratio of mango and lime zest. I will definitely be back for more and the next items on the list to try are: the waffles and matcha-coconut, kiwi and mojito lovepops. If you're in the area, don't hesitate to check out this cute little spot and satisfy your taste buds :-)"
/user_details?userid=LlMfTEapbG0ikzdoqA8oGQ,Alexia B.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"This place just opened up around February!The decor is very cute/clean and would please any foodie instagrammers. The waffle was cooked well and the flavor really hit the spot! My only concern is that their concept is ""waffle on a stick"" but the waffle isn't easy to eat with the stick. My stick fell out so I just used my hands in the end. I'd recommend asking for a fork and knife if they have it. The drink selection was really interesting/good. I had a matcha drink with no sugar and loved it! They also have a selection of coffee. They have alcoholic popsicles!!!! I didn't get to try one but definitely will be returning this summer to have a few.Overall I'd recommend it to a friend and return but had to give it 4/5 stars because their ""waffle on a stick"" concept didn't really work for me. Maybe if there were two smaller waffles that were easier to pick up and eat like a lolipop it'd be better, but they were just too big."
/user_details?userid=wWHeaOS28fnCnFN1Pmo3xg,Shaan A.,"Thornhill, Vaughan, Canada",4 star rating,LAPOP has a cool concept of waffle pops dipped in chocolate with toppings. I saw this in old Montreal and was intrigued to try - but I didn't want something too heavy...luckily they had these adorable ice pops. The shop is a bit hard to find as it is on a street with lots of construction. Nonetheless I ventured my way in. The staff are super friendly and the store is clean and aesthetic. You'll definitely find an ig worthy spot with the interior or old Montreal streets as the background. They have an abundance of flavours...the most popular being mango lime and blueberry lemonade - but I was really curious to try the kiwi one. It was made with fresh fruit and looked absolutely delicious. Essentially it was like eating a mushed frozen kiwi with a much smoother texture. I'd definitely go back to try the other flavours!

My friend and I sat in their cute nook and ate our waffles and cappuccinos, and that moment was one of our favorites of our trip. We text eachother dreaming of those waffles to this day. Not only were the toppings fun, but the waffle itself was SO GOOD!! The people that worked there were friendly, welcoming, and happy we were there.Wish I lived close to Montreal so I could go back every weekend!"

/user_details?userid=cGPjhJTgbAYGPJmcg80Jbg,Eugenia L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Yesyes, loved it here. It was scorching hot outside in Montreal and this was the perfect treat. They have boozy popsicles (6% alcohol), fruity flavours and milky flavours. I tried the blueberry lemonade which was a little on the bland side but the blueberry coconut was the winner here. It was so rich a creamy. The coconut milk added such a refreshing flavour and just made the blueberry pop. We also got it dipped in chocolate (free of charge).  The girl that was working there was also so nice and helpful which made the experience even better."
/user_details?userid=16XDM4M2G8NvLVLLOhM1nA,Sandrine L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The concept of this highly Instagrammable place is really cool. Plus I am really into waffles ! Yes but no. I am a sweet tooth but his is really too sweet. I limited myself to only one garnish and it was a big sugar rush. I prefer my Belgian waffles without any garnish, it's sweet enough. And good luck to eat it and still have an Instagrammable face after that, it's a bit hard to eat without making a mess. Happy I tried but not my favorite thing."
/user_details?userid=LpSrR5iFL5A6i6wLHtpAQw,Kyle W.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"This place is awesome! Waffles on a stick, with a choice of four dips including chocolate, Nutella, maple and salted caramel. Then you get your toppings. The waffles themselves are amazing, and the dips/toppings are amazing. They also have ice pops and boozy pops. Do yourself a favor and check them out!"
/user_details?userid=bl1JDFFbqbuX7CFwGJU__A,Eliane L.,"Chambly, Canada",5 star rating,"Very delicious, cannot be disappointed by this little amount but good food. What's amazing about this place is that when it's hot outside there is a refreshing cold LApop and when it's cold out there's hot warm waffles on a stick. Really nice people. Very good, and must go!"
/user_details?userid=Sz95o6SqWfp8pC_TTSa6Jg,Ahmed M.,"Stilwell, KS",5 star rating,Enjoyed the ice pops - watermelon and a mango/lime. You have to try one!!! They're great during this spring/summer weather. Free pineapple infused water is a nice touch and the service is very friendly. Will definitely try other flavors on our next visit to Montreal and maybe try the waffles.
