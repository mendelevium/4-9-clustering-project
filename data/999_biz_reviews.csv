Went here on a Saturday night recently with a friend and sat at the bar for dinner (which I love to do). You get a great view of the amazing open kitchen and get to see the chefs prepare everything. So cool. The food was amazeballs. I had the charcuterie platter with homemade marinates and croutons as a starter. It was delish. The rillettes were amazing and it's a perfect starter dish for 2, or even for 1. I then had the beef tartare and was sooooo happy I ordered this. I kept seeing the chef prepare these and couldn't stop drooling. I asked for very ""relevé"" and it was soooo good and made to my taste. My friend had the oignon soup which was served in a very unique way (with bouillon on the side)... but don't stop there if you go for dinner, there seem to be so many incredible dishes (fish and chips looked crispy and delightful and the oyster platters looked yummy). The wine list was excellent, and as we learned from our friend at the bar, it is changed on a weekly basis. Love that. We took a suggestion from the sommelière at the bar and it was delish. I strongly recommend this restaurant if you're in the area of Rosemont or even if you're not close at all... It's worth the detour."

I finally found an occasion to go and I was very happy with the atmosphere and decor. The servers as pointed out by another Yelper are robotic. Shallow smiles as to say ""you are not good enough, to garner my attention or you are taking up my time"".  Please get over yourselves ladies.  There is a fine line between an air of polite poshness and being snooty. Time to find the balance.The food was very good.  I ordered the grilled heart of romaine that came with cherry tomatoes, bacon, toasted slices of baguette, Parmesan cheese, and Caesar dressing.  It was aromatic and worth every bite.The main dish was the mushroom risotto with asparagus.  It was very hot, enough to make the server Yelp in pain due to the heated plate. Then I decided to touch the plate as well.  Yeah...it was hot.The only suggestion is to hold back on the salt.  Otherwise, it was very good.3 / 5 stars for the food. Loss of a star for being snooty."

Great atmosphere that isn't too stuffy (I liked the classic rock in the background), but will provide lovely food. Highlights-- Sincerely the best pasta dish I've ever had (when no one was looking, I may have licked the bowl).- Perfectly cooked steak with delicious (but not overpowering) seasoning and sauce.- Cocktails were well-made and super tasty.- Wait staff was friendly and helpful, taking the time to translate the menu and answer any questions. Also helpful with beer suggestions.- Even though we were the last ones in that night, there wasn't even a hint of that understandable impatience many places have.The place has fine-dining portion sizes, but everything is very reasonable for the quality you're getting. Go eat here now. Now."
/user_details?userid=MQSdV8IxlBoKZvaC-kRjsg,Nana P.,"North Babylon, NY",3 star rating,"Over priced , crowded , cramped and noisy . I had a steak of some sorts and I couldn't chew it . My friend had mussels and there was very little sauce or juice to moisten them with . Her husband ordered the baby back ribs and they were by far the best choice at our table , they had an unusual spice ( cumin) and were tender and meaty ... otherwise this meal was not memorable ."
/user_details?userid=g05jfdQIwe_ANt75NprQkw,Karine L.,"Redondo Beach, CA",5 star rating,"I was recommended this place by my cousin who simply adores this restaurant and is a regular so I went to visit and asked where we should go eat, she was very fast at answering Bistro Chez Roger! We walked to the restaurant so I am not sure about parking. We sat at the bar which looks like a dinner enjoying the chef at work. I was very impressed with the decor and lighting, it felt very warm and yet ""Branche"". If you know me or read my reviews, you already know that I always sit at the bar so I was very excited to find the long diner type bar. We ordered the fish, the shortribs and ribs. I got to taste all 3 meals and they were all very delicious. The fish was flaky and well seasoned, the short ribs couldn't have been more tender and the ribs were simply falling off the bones. The service was awesome, our server was very keen and giving us great recommendation. We all know that bad service can ruin the night, it was not the case, it's was the opposite.I was very pleased with this recommendation of this place and can't wait to go back and try more food!"

Decor is neat, food is decent, the price is right and I guess ignorant service is part of the deal.Service is not terrible, but forgotten stuff, cluelessness of our waiter, her fake, robotic smiles and overall slowness and mix-ups were very annoying.The real question: can we expect better service at this price? And my answer is: probably not, but...My advice to the boss: simplify you menu, educate your staff, stop pretending that you're higher-end than you really are and everything will feel much smoother for us, your customers."
