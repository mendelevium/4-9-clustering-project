Olivia's fried chicken is out of this world! The skin is crispy and crunchy, not oily from the frying, and they offer a bunch of different sauces for dipping (honey mustard and onion soya are my favs)! They also have sides as well such as potato salad (you need this one), coleslaw etc.Service was good too, because I had ordered an order of the boneless as well as the bone in chicken and could not decide on which sauces I wanted, they gave me one of each :) Also loved that when they packed the food they made a hole in the corner of the box so the chicken doesn't get soggy - small detail but for take out it's an important one! Definitely recommend if you're in the area!Check out my insta for more pics: @bonappetitmesamies :)"

It was still crispy even though I got takeout. The honey mustard dipping sauce was good -- but I would totally try to sweet and spicy next time (went with someone who doesn't like spicy). The portion was perfect for two hungry people. Definitely want to try more on the menu."

The boyfriend and I ordered a ""dipped fried chicken - bone in"" and it comes with 1 side. We chose the macaroni salad. For sauce we went with the sweet and spicy. At first I thought the macaroni was super small. But by the time we were done the meal, we were beyond stuffed. We even had a few pieces of chicken left over! For delivered fried chicken, I was surprised how crispy it arrived. I can only imagine if we had it fresh at the restaurant!"

I called 30 min prior to pick up and a friendly guy answered the phone.  He took my order of the boneless fried chicken with sauce and salad on the side.  I checked if that was enough time and he said yes.  I got there pretty much on time.  There were two annoyed delivery guys who'd been waiting 10 or so minutes for their orders.  I stepped in an waited and oddly there was nobody at the front... I stood and waited while a bunch of people seemed to be trying to get stuff in order at the back.  After a dozen of minutes of waiting, finally a guy who came still wearing his jacket from outside asked if we'd been served. I got my order a few minutes after but no apologies and by the time I got home, the order had cooled down.  Not sure if it was cause of the wait at the resto or my drive home.  Since these guys are well rated, maybe it's one of their off days? Anyway, they didn't look like they had it together that day.  Now for the food. I liked the crispy chicken--the batter is very lightly seasoned but fried perfectly.  I think the chicken on it's own would need more salt, but that's probably the idea of the sauce. It goes excellently with the honey mustard sauce. The boneless chicken for $23.99 is a big enough portion for two people with a few pieces left over. Coleslaw is made with a vinaigrette but a little on the oily side. If you're a sauce fiend like we are, you'll probably want to add an extra sauce to go with the rest of the chicken pieces. Overall, I liked their friend chicken and sauce. Maybe the customer service was a bit off on that day so I'd still give them another shot and hopefully the chicken will be ready on time!"

They even have various flavoured mochi which are worth a try for dessert. I've ordered it several times and gotten many people to try it, it's a winner. My fave order: boneless chicken + sweet and sour sauce + fries. Yum!!"
/user_details?userid=VUS9-ABMF37mbHG5aMaaZw,Gabriella F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Amazing crunchy moist tender chicken! I saw some reviews that said the boneless meat was dry but I completely disagree. It was insanely good! 1 boneless chicken order was about 10 big pieces. We got the sweet and spicy sauce + the garlic soya sauce. Both were extremely sweet. I have a big sweet tooth but I can imagine that those who don't will find the sauces abit much. I do recommend buying a second sauce because 1 sauce container wouldn't have been enough. The potato salad was good nothing out of this world. It's too bad I thought each order came with pickled radish or something I saw many picture with little pickled pink things but I didn't get any.

/user_details?userid=qfCHqKbLR48haYCM3As_AQ,Alex F.,"Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Was excited to try their fried chicken since I saw it all over social media and people kept posting pictures of it (Instagram). I bought 2 portions of boneless chicken since they were out of bone-in : 1 sweet and spicy & 1 garlic soy. Maybe because I had a long drive home (around 25 mins), but the outside was a bit soggy and not crispy. Their sweet and spicy homemade sauce was not what I expected of korean fried chicken (which usually are spicy). The garlic was very good if you like garlic (they put a lot in it). It comes with a small portion of marinated radish and cabbage. While I would order this for say-a Superbowl afternoon- i lived closeby in NDG, I would not make a long drive purposely to eat their chicken. There are other authentic places that make better sweet and spicy sauce fried chicken (dakgangjeong) in downtown Montreal. If it's your first time and you are near NDG and looking for some fried chicken, go ahead! It can please that craving. But if you are looking for a good sweet and spicy korean style fried chicken, then this is not your place."
/user_details?userid=Tc6p50wHoUpMVQgvVmhZPA,Anum N.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",2 star rating,"The chicken was extremely oily which ruined our experience for us. We ordered chicken burgers! And strips and bone in.Chicken burgers was so oily the oily was all over the buns, they used brioche buns but the buns were not fluffy and were pretty flat but that would have been okay if the chicken was good inside! It was extremely oily and they used cheese sauce not real cheese and then mayo so you can imagine.The strips were good taste wise and the bone in chicken had some flavour too but we have to take all the coating off due to it being oily and heavy.I gave it two stars for the the fact that chicken strips were not overly salty!"
/user_details?userid=DwuLtfL0_A-Kk4EwO10Rww,Sylvie Q.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The name says it all. It is authentic fried chicken. It isn't what you are used to when you see korean fried chicken so if you are like me and you prefer chicken full of sauce and more taste, go somewhere else but if you want to try typical korean fried chicken, this restaurant is a good option. You definitely get that crispiness! They have different flavors of mochis. They were big & good too."
/user_details?userid=oiCMdMpOJRhdc3iBzL_U5A,Andrea W.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"I ordered boneless chicken from here today, the guy on the phone was very kind in explaining how their servings work. They seem to be a new addition to the neighborhood. The price might sound a little steep but they give ALOT of no less chicken, enough for two people with leftovers. The chicken is tender, juicy and the breading is so light and airy! I've never had tenders like this before. The dipping sauce I got was garlic/soy, consisency was just right not too overbearing either. Return customer!"
/user_details?userid=XEqApY2jtSPdGptPsJHumg,Lucy F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I tried their boneless chicken plain and dipped with the garlic/soy. Both were absolutely amazing. So far, it's my favorite fried chicken in Montreal. Super crunchy without being overly oily. I live 45 minutes away from the restaurant and even the dipped chicken remained crunchy by the time I got home. Enjoy!"
