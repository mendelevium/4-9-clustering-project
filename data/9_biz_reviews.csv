/user_details?userid=xp4dDQt-SH4MoiELGCQQqA,Carman C.,"Markham, Canada",3 star rating,L'Avenue is one of the most highly rated and talked about brunch places in Montreal. It consistently has a long line up no matter what time or day of the week so I was fairly excited to finally try it. Our group of four had no trouble getting a table on a Monday morning when the restaurant first opened.Food 3.5/5We ordered the Saint Petersburg and Mac+Cheese Waffle. The Saint Petersburg is a smoked salmon eggs Benedict served on a latkes potato waffle instead of an English muffin. The potato pancake was okay but wasn't crispy as I hoped and instead was just a soggy hashbrown. The salad would have been nice to balance the greasy hashbrown but the lemon in the dressing was too over powering.The Mac+Cheese Waffle is a spin on the classic chicken and waffles. The fried chicken was coated in BBQ sauce that was overly sweet in my opinion and was too much to eat on its own. The mac & cheese waffle was fairly bland and was lukewarm when it was served. Service 4/5Overall I feel that L'Avenue is overhyped but would try it again if there was no line. The food portions are extremely generous and would recommend sharing a dish between a couple.

They have a great variety of different types of breakfast. Trust me you will want to order everything on the menu! Each dish comes with a fruit kebab. Everything tasted amazing and the price is good. I ordered a chorizo eggs benedict and a cup of cappuccino. The egg benedict was cooked perfectly. (The yolks were very drooly! The best indicator that it is a good eggs benedict.) The hollandaise sauce was delightful, not too overpowering. I also really liked the potatoes!! Very crispy and had tons of flavour! The cappuccino tasted like a normal cup of coffee you would get at a cafe.Overall, great food, good ambiance and awesome decor! Make sure to check out the bathrooms! There is usually a 30-minute waiting line but it is worth waiting. I highly recommend going there!Chorizo Eggs Benedict ($18.34)Cappuccino ($4.57)"

They have a wonderful selection of fresh to go meals. Phenomenal coffee and all kinds of desserts and chocolates, OMG the chocolates, that's what I call an exotic selection worth checking out!"
/user_details?userid=3J8OoQEBaFQx6Ooyu3UkgA,Joyce A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My friend and I's first time to eat here and we had no idea what to order. The menu is so overwhelming. Lot to choose from. I decided to take a Californian Egg Benedict and I didn't regret a bit. It was delicious. It has avocados and smoked salmon  which I am so happy about. The side salad was good as well that finished it as well. The interior is about street style. Above us was a motorcycle, the wall was not just plain paint but with abstract shapes and colors with touch of graffitis. My belly was so happy and thrilled. Will definitely come back!"
/user_details?userid=h5eVBQ5DyrpnQOaJ9ycl3g,Shiyue X.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Came around 10am on a cold Thursday with a group of 5. Pros: - Good service: our water was refilled quickly, our waitress was really friendly and attentive. Whenever we asked for something, she brought it over instantly.  - The water was really good! I don't know what it is, but I found it absolutely delicious. There's no special taste or anything. It tasted like pure, delicious water! (Or maybe I was just dehydrated?) - Really good fruit skewers: the fruit was extremely ripe and sweet - Good food, huge portions! Not much to say. The food tastes delicious and the portions are very generous. * Pro tip: get the braised ham. AMAZING! - Decent price: the whole meal cost me 25$ and it was more than enough food to cover breakfast and lunch! Cons: - Small space: it doesn't feel cramped at all inside, but there's not a lot of seating, so there was quite a bit of wait outside. - Too much food, so you feel fat afterwards? I don't really have any other cons! (They're more than happy to pack up your leftovers) Final thoughts: delicious, great place, but try to come earlier to avoid the wait."
/user_details?userid=jDeGeFlTTY6C_m9fYVFMdg,Marilyn R.,"Fanwood, NJ",5 star rating,"BEST BRUNCH PLACE IVE EVER BEEN TOO!!!I'm such a huge brunch lover and my boyfriend wanted to check this place out because of their high ratings and it was the BEST thing we've ever done! If you're in Montreal, you HAVE to come here, hands down. There usually is a wait but trust me, it's so worth it. I would come back to Montreal solely for this brunch spot! The customer service here is impeccable as well. Our waiter was very attentive and gave us great rrecommendations. Even the decor here is awesome! The food: We first ordered some Hot Chocolate to warm us up from waiting outside and damn was it so so good. It even came with a piece of chocolate on the side which was such a nice touch! We also got fruit skewers which was a surprise because using anything fruit related is extra in NJ/ NY and it was complimentary, so fresh and sweet too in the middle of winter... MIND BLOWN... As the entree I got The Indecisive which was seriously so well fitted for me because I wanted a little bit of everything with someone sweet such as my Nutella French toast. My boyfriend also got the Steak and eggs which he really enjoyed. I tried some of the steak and it was really flavorful! I can't say enough about this place but it definitely became my number one brunch spot I've ever been to! 100% recommend coming here!"
/user_details?userid=RoO8V10M8wLrJT-JnuNVig,Julie C.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,"My first stop for food during my Montreal trip and it surely didn't disappoint! My friends and I got here a little after it opened and got seated right away. The menu includes an endless amount of options even for the pickiest eaters out there. I was drawn to the Eggs Benedict from the mouth watering pictures that I was seeing on Yelp. I was stuck between the Steak and Eggs Benedict or the Californian Benedict but ultimately went for the Californian Benedict because it included avocado. For all avocado lovers out there this is for you!The Californian Benedict was hands down one of the best Eggs Benedict I have ever had in all my brunch experiences! It was packed with avocado, a generous amount of creamy spinach, smoked salmon and hollandaise sauce. With the Benedict comes a fruit stick and a side of potatoes. The potatoes were well seasoned and crispy on the outside. Just a note that the portion size is pretty big and can be something that you can share! In terms of service, shout out to our waiter for being so patient with us while we were deciding what we wanted to order. The ambiance of the restaurant was nice but I would note that the tables are rather close to one another. Highly recommend this spot to anyone who's looking for some delicious brunch!"

/user_details?userid=8Ggt4vDYC73pv5wfYTPJsw,Zoejaiwah F.,"Fort McMurray, Canada",5 star rating,"Probably the most surreal, surprising and amazing breakfast restaurant I visited during my entire Montreal trip.Try the billionaire bacon, it's worth it.The server dared me to try and finish my entire meal, I finished everything with the exception of the hashbrowns.The service was top notch as per Montreal's standard and the environment was nice, a bit small but worth while nevertheless.Visit visit visit this place if you are in Montreal and you fancy yourself an amazing breakfast experience."
/user_details?userid=97YdD8tkMkUSvGUw6_u4GQ,Rebecca C.,"Oakland, CA",3 star rating,"More of a chain breakfast place for the mass market with huge portions.I am not a huge fan of egg benedicts so this may be a bit biased. The poached eggs tasted too sour to me. I got the shashuka with chorizo instead of beyond meat and it was served with poached eggs (the same as egg benedict), I like the baked egg version much better. Tomatoes weren't bursting with as much flavor as the tomato from farmers market and it needs a little bit more spice. It was also a bit too watery and not dense enough. The best part of the dish was the toasted sesami bagel from st viateur with butter on top. These bagels tastes so much better toasted!They no longer serve duck benedict (not enough scale for one dish as we were told) which was disappointing for my sister.Service was great. The fresh toast was so so as well, fluffy but lacked structured at the edges. The topping was ok. Definitely big portions for what you pay. The service was great."

During this vacation I found myself in Montreal Canada enjoying a new country and people. My group and I had a great time here. I stumbled upon this restaurant and told my group we had to try it out. I'm so glad we did. From the walk in to the point we left we knew we made the absolute right choice! We ordered:- Damn good fried chicken sandwich - The detox smoothie - Gym dude omelette with potatoes and wheat breadOur server Leonie was nothing short of amazing. I want to take the time to share that she took her time with us in explaining the restaurants menu items and gave us some of here professional tastebud opinions on what to eat and drink. She was very nice and treated us like locals. Thank you for making us feel at home. The food was fantastic and so was the detox shake/smoothie. We will be coming back here next time in Montreal!!"
/user_details?userid=Y5ILp4yzjuQBcijChEksgw,Michelle M.,"North York, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Wait time: close to 1.5 hours because our group consisted of 7 people. Arrived around 11:45am and got seated by 1:15pm on a Sunday. At the end of the meal, we almost forgot about the wait time - the whole experience exceeded our expectations.My meal: the Indecisive (picture included). I asked for all Swiss cheese and they delivered. No complaints about everything else on the plate. Strawberry Nutella French toast was amazing. I wish I had room to finish everything. The rest of the table: ordered a variety of Benedict's and was highly recommended. Plan accordingly so you won't be disappointed. L'Avenue will always be a place to visit when I visit Montreal again."
/user_details?userid=fbRdDZciw4Y8pgujgbwEMg,Karen L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Did not think it was worth the wait or the price. And I also didn't like the taste of my eggs benedict. Maybe I should have just ordered a regular eggs benny, but they seemed to have cooler toppings available so we went for those. At $18-$20 for a fruit skewer and a standard eggs benedict though, I'd opt to go elsewhere. Decor and washroom is cool though!"
/user_details?userid=whLu9QCqs-MXTtCJrHNRHg,Peter S.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"I went here when I was in Montreal for business last year. The ambience is epic, portion sizes are huge, food quality and service are perfect, and the washroom... unlike anything I've ever seen (make sure you go to the washroom when you eat here lol). Only down side is the line is massive if you try to eat here on a Saturday or Sunday morning, and in the winter it is cold if you are seated near to the door. Since they are so busy there are people constantly entering and exiting, and since Montreal winters are freezing the front section of the restaurant is definitely a bit chilly."
/user_details?userid=dIh3-PmA8UN3nRSHrGZLbg,Corey P.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,"Still standing as one of my favorite breakfast/brunch spots in MTL! Never disappoints. This time, no line! Definitely a plus."
/user_details?userid=fdOuKZghNqoaA-Z8kn7_qQ,Jamie Y.,"Irving, TX",5 star rating,"Definitely worth the wait! We got to L'Avenue around 11am, and there was a line out the door. But don't let that scare you because the line goes pretty fast. I think we waited about 20 min. Once you are in the restaurant, you are greeted by mural wall and nice décor. Even though this is a busy place, everyone is very nice and accommodating.Now onto food... We ordered sweet and savory egg benedict/ Bobby does Dallas. OMG. They were soooo good! I don't know what they did to the French toast, but it was the BEST French toast I've ever had. Also the maple syrup was definitely a good addition. Bobby does Dallas was also very tasty - it had good BBQ flavor that brought the whole dish together. If I ever go back to Montreal, I will visit this place again...for sure! Now that I am writing this review, I am craving for their awesome food."
/user_details?userid=JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,Amy Z.,"Newmarket, Canada",5 star rating,"Ok this place has such high reviews for a good reason - I'm not a huge 'going out for brunch/breakie' kind of person.. mainly because mornings and I don't match. My friend, a local in Montreal told me we had to be there for 8am for no line... excuse me?? (needless to say, we didn't make it for 8am.. we arrived probably by 8:45am and really lucked out as we didn't have a line and got sat right away)Service is spectacular!!I ordered the huevos rancheros - AMAZING! The toppings on the burrito were perfect and the avocado was really something else. It was super cheesy and yummy on the inside too. Came with a side of potatoes that were possibly the best potatoes I've ever had? Crispy, seasoned but also had a great texture. Yum!My friends ordered the eggs benny - definitely super buttery and described as the 'best hollandaise I've ever had in my entire life' - it looked mouthwatering and to die for. They had so many types of eggs benny.. jeez what a great fattening but delicious way to start the day!! The meals all come with a starter of fruit and the plates itself are HUUGE- I didn't even finish my food as I was stuffed.Oh, do yourself a favour and take a nice IG photo in the bathrooms ;)By the time we finished and left, the line went down the street outside - probably an hour long wait or so! get here early if you want your noms."
/user_details?userid=SNQ0dHxmxsFJYu_lOYLi4A,Ardeshir R.,"Buffalo, NY",5 star rating,"Waiting for about an hour under the rain was kind of worth it here. This place started to impress the moment we stopped by. We went here for breakfast and when we got there around 10 am, there was already a long line. We asked the staff if we needed to leave a name or just stay in the line and they were very friendly and responded while giving us an umbrella as it was raining.We tried the chorizo Benedict and the full breakfast, and they both were amazing. The side salad was great too with a hint of seaseme oil in its dressing. The dishes were served with homemade potatos and a skewer of fresh fruit. They even gave us a basket of various hot sauces when we asked for one. The restrooms are quite psychedelic too!"
/user_details?userid=JXfUPmN87P2TEpM3utgdqg,Andrew K.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"Place is a hip restaurant, best for breakfast/brunch. Inside the decor is flashy and energetic and the spot overall is trendy and popular. We arrived early with a group of 5. Some of us ordered eggs Benedict, others the omelette. Regardless of what you order, they give you a skewer of fruit to start with. Perhaps the eggs benedicts are what seem to be the most recommended here; the Californian I had was a combination of smoked salmon and avocado.  The eggs Benedict is heavy on the sauce so if you aren't big on that I would recommend mentioning that in the order. They feature an indecisive option that comes with savory and sweet options. The carrot pancakes are quite interesting, perhaps not as good as normal pancakes but still worth a try. The fruit smoothies were also delicious as well. Overall 4/5 for a decently well balanced breakfast experience."
/user_details?userid=DVevJSUXRG1ddLxHrsTtRw,Michelle C.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Why can't more breakfast places put this on their menu?! How many times are you at breakfast and you can't decide between the pancakes or the eggs? The french toast or the hash? The indecisive: you get a lil' sweet, you get a lil' salty. Best of both worlds! We came right when they opened on Sunday morning; if you come within about 20 minutes of opening time you'll get a seat, otherwise you're likely going to have to wait until second seating (which may take a while since these breakfasts are huge and take a while to consume). The tables are very close together, I don't mind since I like to ogle other people's breakfast choices when they come out and decide whether or not I have order regret. They didn't have menus in English yet, I guess they just changed their menu up and haven't printed/created an English version. This was kind of a bummer since it makes deciding much more difficult; you can make out/guess most main dishes (pancakes=pancakes) but I had some trouble with translating the sides/toppings. My husband got the chorizo benedict; it was larger than I expected, with the hash-like topping of peppers, onions, and chorizo spilling over the edges of the english muffin and filling the plate. The hollandaise was tart and creamy, the eggs poached to perfection. It was served with a salad that was dressed with some sort of asian dressing; sounds weird but my husband seemed to enjoy the combo. I got the indecisive with dulce-de-leche french toast. It was topped with a brown sugar/pecan glaze and whipped cream and also seemed to be 'crusted' with some panko. No where near the crispy perfection of La Passe Composè's french toast, but I appreciate the effort and still happily consumed the the whole thing. It came with potatoes which were garlicky and covered in delicious thyme, the only thing that would make them better is if they were crispy instead of soft. My eggs were poached perfectly, as well, and the bacon and sausage were also done well. Service was attentive, prompt and polite. They offered us all the sauces we could ask for and will bring you out a tray of hot sauces if you want. Most of their entrees are $15-20 CAD which is incredible for the amount of food/variety of food you get. PS. Blacklight party in the bathroom. Just go."

The Bobby at Brome lake had undercooked cruncky potatoes and was a bit on the bland side. The pecan French toast is burnt and greasy, it doesn't have the whipped cream topping and the pecan is so stale it tastes like it was toasted last week. Literally everything I ordered was terrible. I know it's a pandemic and it's hard on the restaurant business, but it can't explain this lack of quality."

We saw a group of 8 attempt to get in and it wasn't fun for them. I'd go back again if not for waiting in the line. If you want to go here, be prepared to wait outside. at 3pm on a Saturday it still took over 20 minutes of waiting for 2.The service was super quick once we got inside. The menu is pretty varied, we ended up getting their signature Steak & Eggs Benedict and California Benedict which was salmon and spinach with poached eggs. We also got a smoothie and both dishes came with Spears of fruit which was a nice touch.The food was expertly prepared and unlike anything I've had before. The steak and eggs Benedict was absolutely delicious and had the most incredible stewed sauce. It also had mushrooms that were melt in your mouth consistency.It think we ate and got out faster than the wait to get in haha"

/user_details?userid=ZGTuCOVq7I4bsyypXAFcLw,Diana C.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Eggs Benedict (Saint-Ambroise): delicious! Our server was kind enough to split up our dish on to two plates without us asking since we said we were sharing. I think we ended up getting double the amount of potatoes. The meal also came with a fruit skewer for the both of us which was a nice surprise a chance for me to get my five servings of fruits in the morning. The hollandaise sauce was yum, the egg was runny, the mushrooms were creamy, and it was a pretty large benedict. Potatoes were seasoned well and they have a variety of hot sauces you can ask for if you want an extra kick besides ketchup.We added a side of Nutella French Toast to our meal and it was delicious as well. There was nutella, strawberries, and then WHIPPP CREAMMMMM! The french toast was an extra add-on. Nutella Coffee: tasty but not a strong Nutella flavor. Came with a piece of dark chocolate on the side and latte art. The eggs benedict were enough to split between two people. I wanted to come back the next day but alas time was not enough.Oh yeah, go to the bathroom. It's like a tell tale heart in there. It's weird, blue lighting, dark, and I'm not sure what is going on but there's a screen playing an animation and a large ceiling to floor mirror in front of the toilet as you sit down and see yourself but at least the sink blocks your body so you're not just awkwardly watching yourself sit on the toilet."

They have a second location in St. Henri. We dropped in on a Tuesday morning (10:30am) and were seated almost immediately. Timed it perfectly because by the time we left, the line was huge. Servers are friendly and our waiter was fantastic. Constantly refilled our drinks and made sure we were well taken care of.The menu has so many options: coffees, milkshakes, exotic juices (aka. fresh smoothies), teas, freshly squeezed classics, complete breakfast, omelettes/famous eggs, pancakes/French toast, eggs benedict, sandwiches, salads and burgers.- Coffee ($1.50) - cheap and free refills- Mango, pineapple + lychee ($7.77) - it's a massive drink so be smart and share. The fruit was fresh and thick. A bit hard to suck up with the paper straws but you get used to it eventually. - The indecisive ($17.77) - 2 free range eggs with a side of fruit skewer, grilled breakfast potatoes and choice of bread (we went with brown bread). We also picked our two savoury (bacon and homemade sausage with herbs) and one sweet (pecan pie French toast). The French toast was bomb! That caramel butter on top was unbelievable. Potatoes were excellently seasoned. The egg, bacon and sausage were pretty standard.Definitely understand why this place is so popular. Come early otherwise be prepared to wait in line."

Went there with bunch of friends on a Sunday morning and luckily we didn't have to wait. We were there by 9:15 am. By the time we left at around 10:15 there was a huge line outside!The staffs are super friendly and they went above and beyond to ensure we were having a great time! Me and my wife ordered smoked meat benedict and chicken benedict along with filtered coffee and a latte. The choice of fruits in the fruit stick was also excellent and thoughtful. The side potatoes with our dish was optimally cooked with the optimal amount of black pepper! We thoroughly enjoyed our time and if you get filtered coffee they will come and refill it when it's over. I didn't know it when I ordered so I was kinda surprised and of course happy :)

I knew we wanted to eat here, but they don't take reservations. We woke up early to come prepared to wait on Sunday am. We only had two other couple in front of us and waited less than ten minutes. I was so impressed with the service and chefs. You can tell they take so much pride in their work! They are well dressed and every plate is spotless and beautiful. My husband got an eggs Benedict dish with chorizo. He ate every bite and when requested potatoes instead of salad our server brought it right away. Anytime he usually orders eggs Benedict, he usually complains they are rubbery. Not this time! I got the Indecisive with scrambled eggs, ham, bacon, and carrot cake pancakes. Perfect for me because I love savory and sweet. It came with a delicious baguette and I took half of it home. I NEVER take breakfast home."

/user_details?userid=AQnb4AxKfk-cHM3lNs0Fdg,Asher H.,"Jersey City, NJ",5 star rating,"The best breakfast place we visited during our 4 day stay in Montreal. To me L'Avenue isn't a place you go for breakfast often (Even though we came here on back to back days.) Its an indulgent treat, with hearty portions; bold, decadent sauces and spices that should be best saved for special events. I would recommend one of the several Benedict options but everything that passed by our table looked delectable. As others have mentioned, the wait can get a bit long on the weekends, so try to go as early as possible to the opening time."

Like the closest I've been to a diet this year is erasing food searches from my browser history..LoL YELP always comes through when searching for the best places to eat. L'Avenue was definitely one of the highlights of my trip. Yes there was a long wait but the food was absolutely worth it. If you have nice friends like me then they will stand in line for you while you shop for shoes at the Aldo right across the street. I wouldn't suggest this place for large parties because space is very limited and my party of 3 skipped over several larger parties that were waiting long before us. Everything we ordered was amazing but the Caramelized Banana with Captain Morgan rum French toast was out of this world delicious. I also ordered the Indecisive (so me). You get a little of everything. While my friends had the Bobby Does Dallas and the Duck Benedict.  And after stuffing our faces until we were about to burst, we walked to Mount Royal Park to burn off all the calories. Will definitely be returning on my next trip to Montréal."

There was something on the menu for everyone! The sangrias were amazing and got the job done, the white was by far a favorite. I understand why people line-up for the wait. The food was amazing! While I was not really a fan of the beer battered ham because it was sweet, I did love the breakfast potatoes-- so rich and herby! The staff was incredible. They were very accommodating to our large group and she went above and beyond to answer all our questions. I don't think I have many positive experiences where big groups are handled seamlessly. We didn't wait long for the food and not one order was wrong! Thank you L'Avenue!"

We ordered 1 carrot pancake and the sauce was really good.

We mentioned to him that it was my dad's birthday and he was so nice.We all got different types of plate, from omelettes to pancakes, and your normal american style breakfast. When our waiter came with our plates he has put a candle in my dad's waffles making it extra special.This is the type of service that really warms my heart, something taking a couple of extra minutes to make someones experience special.The ambiance was nice, it was a hip place with some great music selection. My brother was into the music and at one point he was trying to figure out the singer suddenly the waiter came by with a piece of paper. It was the bands name and title of the song.

What more so you want? We ordered a side of skewer and potatoes. I also ordered their fruit shakes which one cannot afford to miss, if you are here. The coffee was pretty decent too. So the fruit- shake was like a giant bowl and so good and balanced in sweetness.The potatoes- oo lalala the most delicious house potatoes I have ever had. Well done potatoes with rosemary and parmesan seasoning and some secret flavours made them just so amazing!The pancakes were so fluffy but so soft, they just melt in the mouth! I ordered the s'mores one and they were delicious and fancy :)The meal also came with slice of cheese , which was of decent grade too.Eggs were large too.Everything was a simple regular breakfast menu item but they made each item exceptional.

Went with my cousin on a Monday morning around 10:15am and there was no lineup! Seating is cramped unless you're in a group of three and you get seated in a small 3 person sectional tables. Service is great, the servers are very friendly and even though they are busy they try their best to be attentive and fast. I ordered a regular breakfast to test out their renown breakfast potatoes and get a feel of their basics. I got an egg, beans, and bacon. The beans were an additional $3 (way too expensive for the quantity). The eggs was fine, bacon ok, and the potatoes were very unique and original but I wouldn't say they are my favourite. I got an oreo milkshake as well and those suckers could easily quench the thirst of a family of 4. It is HUGE. Very delicious as well. Great consistency and good ratio of oreo/vanilla ice cream taste.My cousin ordered the coconut/caramelized bananas/nutella pancakes and honestly they gave her so much food to eat I thought would collapse in a food coma at the sight. I think the prices are fair for their brunch meals because they give you so much food but they give too much food and most of it can't be kept for later. I would rather it be cheaper and they give less. One meal is enough for 2-3 people. It just seemed like such a waste. I wouldn't say I didn't like it, I just didn't love it. They have a creative menu and great service but if I had waited more than 15 minutes it wouldn't be worth it.But i'll definitely come back and try their lunch options."

Avoid the line-up, and you will be VERY pleased.Again, I was on vacation and as always I decide to go have brunch. Ordered my regular, eggs Benedict. It was really good, but the potato was average.

The biggest tip here is to come early. The line becomes insanely long after 9am. We ordered a classic eggs benedict and an indecisive breakfast with sausage and ham. The eggs Benedict was super indulging! The hollandise was definitely packed with a load of butter making it amazingly creamy and flavourful. It is also complimented well with a salty pulled ham. Although the Benedict was great, the potatoes are the reason I would keep coming back. Flavoured perfectly with various spices, the potatoes give you a reason to keep eating. I think I finished my potatoes before my Benny's! My friend had the indecisive and the star of that plate is nonetheless the French toast. Made with extra thick and FRESH bread. The creme fresh is also an amazing touch as it is most fresh than sugary complimenting the sweetness of the toast. Overall, this was an amazing experience which also led to us visiting l'avenue at the other location on notre dame!"

Split it if you can! There is so much food. I would highly recommend the Nutella coffee. It's something much better than just mixing Nutella in your coffee and I wish I got another cup to go.

The home fries that come with most orders are FANTASTIC. I can honestly say that those are the best potatoes I have ever had. They're so flavorful and addicting. The Duck Confit Benedict is absolutely amazing. The eggs are cooked perfectly, over a bed of sweet and salty duck and onions. The Beautiful Truffle is also wonderful. The sautéed mushrooms soak up all the delicious spices and oil that they are cooked in. The Nutella French Toast is crispy and soft at the same time, and just the right amount of sweet. Bobby Does Dallas is also very good if you like barbecue sauce. It is a skillet with potatoes, mushrooms, and steak tossed in barbecue sauce, topped with scrambled eggs.There are a ton of menu options from sweet to savory, and they even have the ""indecisive"" which allows you to have both. The prices are good, especially for the portion sizes. The plates are definitely be sharable if you aren't too hungry.The wait to get in and get your food can be a bit long, but it is well worth it.

We arrived around 930 on a Friday with no issues getting a table immediately. When we left there was a good size line outside so definitely try to come early.The interior is funky and the menu has a game show theme to it. To eat I had the wild mushroom and lardon benny and my friends ordered the indecisive and a 2 egg breakfast. We were also given a fresh fruit skewer prior to our food arriving. I am a sucker for eggs benny and l'avenue did not disappoint. The hollandaise was delicious and the eggs were poached perfectly. It was served with seasoned breakfast potatoes which were also fantastic. My friends also enjoyed their choices with no complaints. They also had mimosas with unique flavors. I tried a blueberry basil mimosa for scientific research purposes. A definite must stop in Montreal for breakfast and brunch lovers. Also check out the bathroom- definitely unique.

The decor includes numerous mannequins and a menu with photos of various Canadian celebrities and random characters hawking the brunch specialties, including French toast and pancake offerings, Eggs Benedict variations galore, as well as burgers and sandwiches.  Portions are generous and include a skewer of fruit with pineapple, strawberry, cantaloupe, and orange. A well rounded drink menu included coffee, coconut milk, mimosas, and Bloody Caesars.  Our order:I'll Take It All - $17.66. The kitchen sink of entrees that includes a pancake, French Toast, Sausage, bacon, baked beans, homemade crotons, pulled pork, pate,  and two eggs.  It's a great dish for sharing and sampling a lot of variety.  Everything was tasty including an incredibly fluffy pancake and  French toast that just tasted so good with the maple syrup. Duck Benedict - $16.92. A very Canadian variation on the Benedict with tender and savory duck confit meat combined with perfectly poached eggs, Hollandaise sauce and caramelized onions.  Very filling. The house potatoes are delicious too and they provide both mayo and ketchup for dipping.

THIS PLACE IS OUTSTANDING! Like, I still don't even know where to begin. Should I discuss the amazing customer service, trippy/ eclectic bathroom, or finger/plate-licking food? I'm not sure!Let's start with the service! Based on the reviews, it mentioned that the wait would be long and the house would be packed, which I thought would mean less-than-great service. However, it was quite the opposite. We had a friendly employee come out every 10-15 minutes to let us know how long it'd be before we could enter the restaurant and be seated. Once inside, we were brought water and asked if we'd like bread and fruit as our appetizer, which we were much obliged.The menu: extensive AF! There's something on there for everybody. Vegetarian friendly, as well! After 7 minutes of flipping the pages back and forth, I decided on the ""undecided"" portion of the menu, which meant I could choose a savory and a sweet dish for my combo. I settled on the Whole Wheat Carrot Cake Pancakes with a Maple Syrup and Cream Cheese Sauce for my sweet, along with the Roasted Potatoes for my savory. I can't forget to mention that a side of fruit and cheddar cheese came with the entree, too! By the time my entree came out, I was half asleep at the table. On the verge of a food coma! No exaggeration. The food was outstanding. Haven't had such hearty and scrumptious pancakes like that in a while! It was such a delicious brunch!Oh, I gotta mention the bathroom. Yes--the restaurant's bathroom. It is part of the frickin experience, man! You go in there and you feel like you're in rave or interactive arcade or escape room or Japanese light show/art exhibition. It's pretty dope and funky! Nice photo op.My friend also enjoyed her time at L'Avenue. She isn't gluttonous like me, so she stopped eating after the starter and saved her entree for dinner that night. I can't wait to come back and visit this gem.

I had expected there to be long lines already considering how popular this place was. Parking was a breeze to find although there was a detour right next to this restaurant, so we had to loop around but no big deal. Our waitress originally sat us in the back booths where there were no graffiti, but one of the reasons why we came here was for the cool graffiti wall so we asked her to seat us at the tables in the front of the restaurant. She was so friendly and happily fulfilled our request. My friend and I spit the smoked meat eggs benedict ($2 upcharge to have them split it into two plates each with a side of potatoes) and nutella coffees. As everybody has mentioned, it comes with a fruit skewer, which was much needed! The fruits were so fresh and delicious. Great way to start the meal. The eggs benedict was great overall but I've definitely had better hollandaise sauce as this one tasted a bit too sour for my taste. The smoked meat was very flavorful - I could eat that all day, ugh. I enjoyed the potatoes a lot as well!

With my group of six, we enjoyed a variety of beverages : nutella coffee, hot chocolate and the matcha latte. The latte I tried myself was delicious. The foam on top was the perfect blend of creamy and flavourful. Even their water was somewhat elevated, which was infused with watermelon! With my team of 6, 5 of us got the eggs benny : steaks and eggs, montreal smoked meat and the classic. Hands down, the CLASSIC is the way to go! The ham was the most delicious piece of meat i've ever tried. The montreal meat was good as well but I didn't like the seed-like sauce on top. My friends enjoyed their steak and chorizo eggs benny's as well. Each dish comes with potatoes and those were extremely flavourful and delicious!

It's just going to blow your mind. Without a doubt this is one the places that I have to go to every time that I'm in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=HUkLmF3TUDZQRw7kfw0Pxw,Kartik G.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,The best breakfast place in Montreal. I would definitely travel to Montreal to just to eat here. Montreal is a city with good restaurants and this place stands top among them. I went multiple times during my stay in Montreal. French toast is the best and it's the best I have ever had. The eggs Benedict is to die for. Their hollandaise sauce is too amazing. I would say this is a must try place to eat. The staff are also friendly. The only downside is the line during weekends. Sometimes you have to wait 1 hr to have your meal. But I would say it's worth it.

It is definitely a bit of a wait but they have a great aesthetic, friendly service and most importantly delish food. I got the indecisive which should really be available at all restaurants for people like me who can't seem to choose just one thing. I got the carrot cake pancakes, two poached eggs, sausage, bacon, home fries, a fruit skewer and a bagel....all for what, $18?!? If that's not a steal idk what is."

Don't be surprised if you see a line up, it has become the norm and to be honest ... the food and service  are so good that I don't mind it! They have a vestibule and they've made some space inside to make the wait a little more bearable in the winter time! My Favourite drinks are the Matcha Latte and Moka! You always get an entree of fruit brochette and their water is watermelon infused! Yum! I highly recommend the beautiful truffle and the breakfast burrito , for a little extra ($4,50) you can add steak in the burrito and it is AMAZING! The ambiance is great, the music is a little loud at times but not unbearable and the decor is very edgy and different! A must brunch spot in Montreal!"

Those L'avenue potatoes are on point! The serving size is A+ I ended up having that as my only meal for the day and wasn't feeling hungry at all after the big brunch!You can also see the menu was designed with cautious and care, you could even see that there are some thoughts put in the order of the fruit skewers! Definitely a must try in Montreal. The service was fantastic too! Everything was just amazing, I think nothing could really compete with the food I had here! Good job guys!"

I'm kidding, but not really.And of course, the food is awesome too. Huge portions, and a customizable menu. For a party of three people, we ordered two dishes, which was more than enough. We got the indecisive (with carrot cake pancakes, roasted potatoes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and bread) and the shakshuka (a tomato dish with poached eggs).If you're like me, and want an excuse to eat CAKE FOR BREAKFAST, try the carrot cake pancakes! They're deliciously spiced, and you can tell yourself you're being healthy because they're made with whole wheat flour. Not normally a cream cheese gal, but the maple cream cheese frosting on the pancakes it to-die-for. Just beware they're pretty sweet.The Shakshuka was meh. Tasted a lot like marinara pasta sauce with veggies and egg. Not very flavorful. Each order comes with a fruit kebab, and you also get yummy fruit-infused water. My friend ordered their exotic strawberry juice, which ended up being very thick, like a smoothie.This place is popular, and thankfully we only had to wait ~15 minutes for a table. The atmosphere is casual, hip, and bustling. If I return to Montreal, this place is definitely on my list of brunch places (along with Sparrow!)."

I would say the wait is a good 45min-1hr. Once you get through that painful experience, the real good stuff begins.  The service is pretty quick and friendly.The food portions are insane. Let me say this once, I highly recommend you share dishes, do NOT order more than one dish per person, you will go into a coma.You can get a bunch of different pancake and egg dishes. The pancakes with bananas and dulce de leche are amazing! They have a bunch of variations, but be prepared to take a nap after all that food.If you get a chance, check out the bathrooms. they have a funky decor, won't say more  as it would spoil it."

SUPER Delicious although I was already full at 2 bites. I took Matcha-Vanilla milkshake and a poached egg mushroom plate. The milkshake doesnt have much matcha flavor(they only sprinkle a bit of matcha on top of the shake) so I was a bit deceived, because it only tasted like liquid ice cream, I wish there was more matcha flavor(8$). 2 people couldnt finish the milkshake it was too much even if half of it was whipped cream The plate I took was super creamy but it was good. Very cheesy. Took it home and my bf turn the leftovers into pasta (DELICIOUS!!). There is so many option I want to try everything. Very close to the metro. When I went I was very lucky to not have to wait a long time because I know there is always a line. AND we got the booth which i'm very excited! I don't know if thats how the hostess roll but when we were waiting in line (inside) the hostess told us to wait outside. I understand, but he should have asked politely (it sounded like he was kicking us out) and it was super duper cold that day so not a good start, at least we were satisfied at the end! The waiters and waitress are super professional and I can see that they know what theyre doing."

The menu has a variety of choices of sweet and savoury foods, or even both for the indecisive (like myself)! You get the best of both worlds :). I got scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, and Nutella French Toast. Everything was delicious; so full of flavour - including the watermelon infused water!

My favourite thing about this brunch place is their sweet and savoury plate (the indecisive) because I can never decide what to get. The dishes are priced from $15-$20 but the portion size is pretty big so you should be full from breakfast to lunch with no snacks until dinner (or even no dinner at all). I highly recommend getting the braised ham (it's like pulled pork) and the sausage. For the indecisive, I recommend getting the carrot cake pancakes. Their eggs benedict is also very good. I usually get the eggs benedict if I don't get the indecisive. Must try! Beware of the 30-45 minute wait on the weekends if you go from 9:30-12pm."
/user_details?userid=4xyYBC5MIe-GfDj6kAdAFw,Ivan H.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"Location/ServiceOne of a recommended restaurant to visit in Montreal. It looks a bit small on the outside, but inside has sufficient tables to serve at least 50-60 people. Street parking is available around the lot. It is a very busy restaurant - so make sure you either come early or make a reservation ahead of time if possible!Inside decor was very homey. There a lot of different colours that brings out a nice vibe. The main attraction would definitely be the washroom. It's glow in the dark, with a lot of graffiti and interesting drawings. Be sure to check it out while you're there!Service - really loved our waitress. She was so nice, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu items. I asked a lot of questions and she was able to answer them all, gave recommendations and often check on us to make sure we're okay.FoodDrink - I ordered the Nutella Coffee, which by its name it's literally coffee with Nutella. You have to stir the cup often cause the Nutella tends to stick to the bottom. But it's like a regular chocolate mocha to me, but the hazelnut brings a different taste to it.Food - ordered the Bobby Does Dallas. It's 3 scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese, topped with black angus steak, mushrooms, sauteed onions and BBQ sauce. Did I say it also came with a side of potatoes? Just listing out the items was a mouthful. The portion were huge - definitely able to be shared. I really liked the scrambled eggs, very fluffy. The steak was cooked to the right level, complimenting well with the BBQ sauce. BBQ sauce is a no fail - it may be a little bit on the sweeter side, that's why I thought having the potatoes there helped balanced it out.Tip - the order comes with a complimentary stick of fruit (the healthier stuff) and a choice of bread, which I choose baguette.Overall, very nice experience here at L'Avenue. Everything was nicely done, staff were great and a vibrant atmosphere. Would definitely come back again when I'm in town."

Duck confit eggs Benedict - yum. It has carmelized onion so I needed to add a hit of salt to balance it out, and then it was great. Poached eggs were perfect. The potatoes are perfectly seasoned. Big portioned. The menu is creative. Service was amazing from the gentleman that was our server, I wish I knew his name to give him props (clean cut young man, brown hair, thin, of average height). It's so busy there and the servers are running around. But every time he was with us, he was super cordial, answering questions, and never appearing to be in a rush, interactive.

I've never had to wait more than 30 minutes for a restaurant in NYC so I said ""this shit better be worth it"", and boy was it! We got in and had delicious fruit smoothies that are served in margarita glasses with cute umbrellas.I had the French toast drizzles with jack Daniel sauce, coconut flakes, bananas, and caramel.  I think about that dish sometimes when I feel depressed. It was the best French toast I've had in my life. Others in my table had the steak and potatoes and I basically ate half their food for them because it was so good. The portions are hugeeee and the food is cheap!

All the waitstaff are dressed in white dress shirts and ties, chefs too. It's inviting, and despite the rush and commotion, still very easy to chat with your table.The menu has a variety of sweet and savoury options, all with unique twists on brunch. Be warned - the portion sizes are massive. Regardless of what you order, they bring a fruit skewer as an appetizer. They have a variety of eggs benedict to choose from, as well as simpler menu offerings such as eggs and bacon. They also have a variety of drinks, from mimosas, to refillable coffee, to boozy espresso beverages.Overall, this place is fun and has a fantastic spin on brunch.

When we arrived to the restaurant there was a huge line up. We had gone on a Sunday. We decided to join the line thinking it would move quickly as the waiter that took down our names said it would be 20 to 30 minutes. The line actually moved much slower than we thought it would. We waited for over an hour before we got a table. It was chilly outside so the wait felt much longer. It would of been nice if they handed out some hot beverages to everyone in line. I've seen other restaurants do this before.   The inside of the restaurant has a nice vibe. There was a motorcycle hanging from the ceiling that was pretty cool. My friend and I order the Mexican style meal to share. The portion was big enough for two. The food was amazing. Had a lot of flavour. Definitely one of the best brunches I've ever had. Every meal comes with some fresh fruit so that was nice. Overall the food at this place was great and I'm glad we checked it out even though we had to wait in line for a while.

I did not know about the washroom before entering, it is very psychedelic inside with the glow in the dark graffiti art (so bring your phone inside!). Near the washroom is a clear water container with sliced watermelons inside, makes the drinking water look aesthetic.

I heard the wait for larger parties towards the back of the line was over an hour.The inside vibe is ""trendy"" and ""hip"" with ridiculously huge portions of food sitting in front of people struggling to conquer their entrée. The prices are higher than other places but you basically get two meals out of whatever you order cause it's just that big.If you don't speak French, don't be discouraged by the non-translated menu on the website, they have English menus inside the restaurant. I ordered the French Toast with strawberries, blueberries and bananas topped with a dolce de leche whipped cream. The hubby ordered the Bobby Does Dallas.

But once we got our food, it was worth the wait. I decided to try their chorizo eggs benedict along with a orange juice mimosa, while my friend decided to try out the indecisive plate with 2 eggs, bacon, homemade sausage and a strawberry and banana French toast along with their pineapple and mango exotic juice! First off, their potatoes are seasoned so good! The eggs benedict were cooked perfectly and the sauce and chorizo were so tasty but a little heavy! As for the mimosa, it was a little strong, but if you mix it well enough it's quite good. Then, the indecisive platter is quite traditional but the French toast was very good, with a generous amount of strawberries. Lastly, the pineapple mango juice was huge in portion and so delicious - perfect for sharing.Overall, the atmosphere of this place is very lively and the waiters are quite friendly.

I want the recipe for their home fries because they are wicked! The pancakes with the cream cheese icing was spectacular and didn't require maple syrup at all, but I very much appreciated the real deal on the table. Matthew had the mashed potato omelet and it was gigantic! It also came with hash browns and a baguette. Instead of the traditional coffee, I went with hot chocolate (which was forgotten for a while)-- adorned with a strawberry and whipped cream, it was so decadent!

/user_details?userid=M-5hySJzM-12cwLwFWX09g,Kelly C.,"Oakland, CA",5 star rating,There's quite a line forming outside but I'd say it's worth the wait. Our server was really attentive and provided excellent service. I ordered the Californian Eggs Benedict and it was more than filling. I would recommend L'Avenue overall if you're a breakfast/brunch lover.
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My favourite breakfast/brunch spot!! Best part about living 2 mins away from the place is being able to go super early and never having to wait in the usually painfully long line!! The menu has a lot of options to suit everyone's tastes and preferences. Last time we went there for brunch, we ordered a few things for the table. We got the French Toast with Caramelised Bananas, coconut, rum sauce and Nutella. The Huevos Rancheros (Breakfast Burrito). And the Classic Benedict with Beef Strips. Everything was perfect as usual. Their french toast is a must try!! Also portions are huge so it's better to order and share!! Service is great."

/user_details?userid=3SfiqyTQO8gP8z6XA1ekpQ,Garseng W.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"By far our favorite restaurant during our trip in Montréal! Our host says that there is always a wait on weekends, but we came in on a weekday near the dead time for a typical restaurant (~2pm) and it was still pretty busy! Luckily, the place has a text-based wait list so you can roam down Mont-Royal and visit the cute thrift stores instead of standing around waiting. The restaurant has a very cute aesthetic. It felt like we were in Brooklyn; there was hip-hop/rap music, the walls are covered in street art-style murals, and the bathrooms were their own pieces of art with wall-to-ceiling artwork and a TV playing a trippy video.We had the following:1. Fruit skewer - comes with every meal, with 5 different pieces of fruit. A nice touch!2. Dragonfruit smoothie - very bright and fruity drink, naturally sweet. A great way to start the meal. 3. Carrot cake ""crepe""- these were actually a stack of 3 American-style pancakes instead of what you think would be a crepe. Extremely bold and rich carrot cake flavor that was sweet and well-spiced.4. St. Ambroise omelette - a huge omelette with a generous portion of braised ham. It was a very hearty choice that really hit the spot! The meat was juicy and flavorful, and the rest of the omelette stood up well against the meat. The staff were very nice, and the prices were moderate; not cheap, but the food was of great value. Overall, we would definitely come back to try different options!--Rating Rubric--5* - As good as it gets; goes above and beyond. I would come here again and again!4* - Worth checking out; a good value. No major complaints or only minor flaws that set this place back. I'm glad I tried it, but I might not come back here in lieu of trying somewhere new.3* - A few setbacks that soured the experience. Not the worst, but I wouldn't recommend it to friends.2* - Multiple setbacks that made me dislike the place.1* - I was personally offended by the people or services. Steer clear!"
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"If you want the best pancakes your existence has ever experienced, then you need to come to L'Avenue and order the rum banana pancakes! They are seriously the most heavenly pancakes you'll ever taste. A large stack, topped with the most delicious rum sauce as well as a ton of caramelized bananas and some dehydrated coconut chips, this dish is literally everything. I've never swayed from placing this order when we do come here but have tasted other dishes from my hubby/friends and can say that the rest of the food served at L'Avenue is also delicious (but nothing as delicious as these pancakes). Beware of the consistently long lines, and try to come off peak hours if you can (you'll still wait but not as long). Otherwise, quick service, fair prices and super cool bathrooms (it's a weird thing to say but go check them out when you're there). Can't wait for my next visit!"

Paid street parking is available. There was a lineup outside the entrance when we went on a Sunday at around 11AM. [SERVICE] - 4/5Our server, Benoit, was wonderful. We had to wait quite a long time for our food to arrive, but that's probably because they had a full-house and each dish was made with care and perfection.[DÉCOR] - 5/5 Retro, fun, and had a ""Film"" theme. Booths were very cozy and all chairs looked comfortable. The bathroom was so cool because it used black light and had graffiti art on the walls! [QUALITY] - 5/5The dishes tasted homemade, had fresh ingredients, and had great presentation! [ORDER] - 5/5- I'll Take It All - $17.66: had the 2 eggs and bacon. Cretons (pork spread) was deliciously savoury. Homemade sausage and homemade baked beans tasted wonderful because they were made from scratch. Pancakes were thick and fluffy. Eggs on the French toast did not soak all the way through, but were still pleasantly sweet with maple syrup. Breakfast potatoes were well-seasoned, and fruits were fresh. - Rainbow Eggs Benedict - $17.77: had 2 perfectly cooked poached eggs. Smoked salmon was soft and fresh. Cream cheese, and Hollandaise sauce were rich and decadent. Capers added a hint of lightness to the dish.- Nutella Coffee - $4.95: made with imported Italian Nutella, and had a delicious balance of sweet and bitter undertones. I would definitely recommend getting this beautiful drink.  [OVERALL] - 5/5 A wonderful place for brunch. The ""I'll Take It All"" had such a large variety and portion of different foods. I also had one of the best smoked salmon benedicts from a brunch place! I would definitely recommend this place for its wonderful ambiance and delicious food."

/user_details?userid=f_ljbAxla0oc7z3zRgXnpw,Sarah W.,"Cambridge, MA",5 star rating,"What can I say but amazing. It's been weeks and I am still thinking about our meal there. First of all, I love that they have an undecided option where you can mix and match a combination of sweet and savory items. So often at brunch I want a pancake rather than a stack of pancakes to go with something salty, so right off the bat this checked all the boxes. We both opted for the Undecided because we wanted to try as many things as possible.  The pancakes were the most amazing pancakes I have ever had in my live. They were gluten free and I think corn based, probably the best thing on the plate! Homemade sausage was surprisingly fresh tasting and not overly salted. Everything else was stellar. Brunch came with lovely watermelon-infused water. We also got a latte which wasn't overly sweet but could have tasted more of coffee. Service was great and really efficient considering how busy and packed they were. People raved about the bathrooms which I didn't understand until we got there. They are a fun experience, I won't spoil it for you but it's worth checking out. We stood in line for 40 minutes and it was absolutely worth it. If you live in/are in Montreal, go. Stand in line. Believe the hype. There are few places that live up to it and this one certainly does."

I wish I had ordered differently, what I got wasn't necessarily bad but it was pretty basic. I got a two egg scramble with cheddar cheese, home fries and bagel. I have been most impressed with most brunch spots in Montreal, with how they serve fruit with the meal, L'Avenue did the same. The eggs were done all right, but nothing spectacular. Coming from New York, I have pretty high expectations as far as bagels are concerned. This bagel did not disappoint, it's much smaller than the New York bagel, and also a tad sweeter. The home fries were amazing. The star of the show for me however was the chai latte, the portion was generous and the flavors were amazing. If I ever come back to Montreal I would definitely visit this place again."

/user_details?userid=-1wbglcr6x1qrUbqP1YAIA,Kimmy N.,"Brampton, Canada",5 star rating,"After a long road trip to Montreal from Ontario, my partner and I decided to stop here for food. We were super hungry. There was a line outside the place, of course. You go to one of the notoriously popular brunch places on yelp, so what do you expect, right? We didn't mind waiting about 15 to 20 minutes to eat here. It's one of those bucket list places we put on the list beforehand. It was really busy and service wasn't very attentive. But mind you, we came around 45 minutes til closing and it was PACKED. We got our food in a timely manner, though. Really appreciated that considering we only had about 25 minutes to eat before they closed. Talk about a close call!  I got the smoked salmon eggs benny - holy mother of God this was the most delicious thing ever! It hit all the notes and it was heavy. In the best way. I don't think I ate another meal after finishing my eggs benny. They give you a fruit skewer thing but pff, this blew everything out of the water. I don't think I finished my potatoes because I was so full but they were really delicious.I didn't know about the infamous bathroom here so when I walked in, I was a taken aback. It's a wonderfully cool but frightening place! Kinda reminded me of a David Lynch situation but a lot more modern. Still really weird. But I liked it!"

I've tried a few other trendy breakfast places around Montreal but this one really wins my heart, every single time. Every person I've suggested to come here loves this place as well. I really think if you could go to one brunch spot while you're in MTL, this is the one. I've tried a few items on the menu (and from my friends' plates), and they are killing it. I've been coming to L'avenue for a few years now and I don't think I will stop anytime soon. Everything is delicious and everything they create just works so well together. Therefore it's hard recommending something. Their service is really good and the atmosphere and the design of this place is really something special. This place is also pretty known for their restroom so don't forget to check that out ;)."

/user_details?userid=2bSX1ipFgI7AnWHvvjK2Yw,Jackie C.,"Berczy Village, Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"this is one of the most popular brunch spots in Montreal and of course being in the area I had to try it out seeing all the 5 star ratings! upon arrival there was a huge line up already outside at around 12 am and we had to wait around 40 minutes outside in the cold until we were able to get inside. my feet were frozen!! it was one of the longest times I've ever waited to be seated but the food was well worth it. the interior of the restaurant is very unique it does not have a constant theme and its pretty random. A must see spot when you go here is actually surprisingly the washroom ! its completely dark but has glow in the dark paint on the walls to illuminate the area. anyways we were seated in a booth for our group of six people and being famished we ordered quickly. I of course went to yelp to find out what I should get because I didn't want to get the wrong choice having waited so long. expect to spend around $15-$20 here. I ended up getting the classic eggs benny ($15.5) and a small hot chocolate ($3.5). the food arrived quickly considering how packed the restaurant was. we first got a fruit skewer with a variety of different fruits which was a good starter. All the food looked so delicious and had big portions. the class eggs benny was an amazing choice on my part. It was easily one of the best I've had with its perfectly pouched eggs, creamy and flavourful hollandaise sauce and the star of the show was the braised ham. IT WAS AMAZING! very unique because it was packed with flavour, it taste sort of like barbecue which is an understatement but not sure how else to describe it. my friends who got bennys as well got the steak, chorizo and montreal smoked meat and they were all amazed by the taste too. As for the potatoes at the side, I never had anything like it ! They were boiled i believe or baked and included a lot of seasoning, it was soo good and filling. the hot chocolate I thought was cute and had a big sweet strawberry but it wasn't amazing. You could skip this but it is a better than an average hot chocolate. after tasting this place, I wish they would open one in Toronto! I would say this is a must go if youre looking to visit montreal :)"
/user_details?userid=mIdcqoBOgMAxTQn-qZj6kg,ChingWa C.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"For years I thought the Bongo Room in Chicago had the best pancakes in the world, but this place definitely blew my mind with its pancakes. I would definitely recommend sharing an order of pancakes with 4 people as I am worried that this will give you heart attack if you try to finish the whole thing yourself. We got the caramelized banana with rum topped with Nutella and coconut. Just writing about this is making me drool. I don't like rum in my dessert so I was a bit concerned at first, but THIS IS AMAZING. The pancakes are so fluffy, and the banana sauce was so smooth and flavorful. The coconut flakes added some chewy texture to the whole creation. The appearance, texture, flavor, aroma, and everything else about these pancakes are absolutely mind blowing. We also ordered other things and tried pork pate for the first time. That was also very interesting and we ate that every day for breakfast at the hotel after such discovery.We were lucky to have gotten a table since our flight landed early and we got there at around 9a. It was one of the coldest weekends there (MLK weekend) and when we walked out of the restaurant, there was a line outside."

The water they serve is infused in a huge container with watermelon. Their brown bread and homemade sausage is a homerun for sure.So, about the bathroom sich that everyone speaks of... yep - it's pretty darn cool. Loaded with graffiti and a black light to set the mood. And then there's that clock project where the minute hand is erased every single minute and drawn again. Pretty coolconcept and definitely a cool vibe. One thing to note - we came here on a Friday morning and in line for about 45 minutes.

Let me explain...We got there on a weekday, about 15 mins post opening so we are able to get a seat no problem. The decorations were pretty awesome and they served water infused with watermelon (mmmm tasty). We looked at the menu and ordered. Here's where it started to go downhill....Each meal does come with fruit kebab which was good. But we waited SOOO LONG for our food. From ordering to getting our food, it was about 45 mins I'd say. They might've been understaff, and I think I only saw 3 chefs in the kitchen, which granted, is not many for how many people were in the restaurant. But I wasn't expecting to wait that long, especially from a restaurant that is highly reviewed. I got the chicken eggs Benedict and the eggs Benedict itself was very good. But the chicken was so dry and tasteless. I ate everything but the chicken. My boyfriend got the carrot cake pancakes which was yummy but very heavy. I will say the bathrooms are quite awesome. Definitely check it out. Would I come here again next time I'm in Montreal? Final verdict is I would want to give it another try...since it is so highly rated."

Be prepared to be full with your selection. There is always a bit of a line outside but it's totally worth the wait. The decor indoors is super fun and can get a little loud but if you're into that kind of busy atmosphere you will love it. The only downside was being seated next to the washrooms.

I ordered the chorizo eggs benedict and it was delicious. They're very generous with their portions! I couldn't finish the whole thing. You get your money's worth, every single bite felt like a stop to heaven. Also, the service is great, my waitress was very nice and friendly and the ambience was great. I don't think this will make me want to wake up early every morning to get breakfast, but it's nice to know that there's some place worth sacrificing your beauty sleep once in a while ;) L'avenue is probably one of them.

Even their bathroom was insanely cool, playing tricks on you when you enter. This breakfast lunch spot is a combination of a hip lounge and urban diner. It's crazy busy in there, but the staff is on top of things. Our server was fantastic and the kitchen did an equally excellent job quickly cranking out our indulgent meals. Loved the carrot cake pancakes, the banana Nutella with rum sauce pancakes were out of this world, poached free range eggs poured yolk when pierced, potatoes tasty - not one complaint. The smoothies looked like giant frozen cocktails, but they were healthy mixtures. They are extremely generous with the portions and even with their fruit, providing everyone with a healthy fruit kabob to start. There was a line late morning on a Tuesday, so I would imagine weekends are at least doubly long. Believe the hype, it's worth the wait."

The waiter's customer service was good, we ordered our food and got them pretty quick. We ordered the classique eggs Benedict, steak & eggs Benedict, and chocolate banana toast(couldn't finish it, got it to go). Everything was in big portion and flavorful, however, we got food poisoned. We had to rush to bathrooms after an hour of eating there, we couldn't eat anything for the rest of the day and the day after. We did not eat anything before eating there. The service was really good, the food taste good, flavorful, and in a big portion, hence, the 3 stars. Just wish we didn't get food poisoned and ruined our time in Montreal."

A lot of people recommended this place and after two fails (line up was too long so I end up going somewhere else) on a freezing cold day of winter I got in.Another 15min to get seated and the place looks awesome to me already, paintings everywhere and a bike hanging out from the ceiling.The service was good, place was super crowded. I got a ""Bobby go to Spain"" (3 scrambled eggs with sauté chorizo, spinach and mushrooms on red pepper sauce over potatoes). The meal was huge I barely finished it but it tasted right and thoughtful. Bottomless coffee was good too.Now I don't know how I feel about waiting every time I go to L'Avenue but definitely try it and you will want to come back there."

This place gets really busy by 11am so get in early if you want to avoid the long wait. Enormous portions on their dishes, I would highly recommend sharing. The sweet-savoury-crunchy is a must try. It's crusted French toast, cheese, poached eggs, ham, and hollandaise sauce. ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. Huevos rancheros burrito is fantastic as well. The carrot cake pancakes are super moist, but the real star is the cream cheese icing. Crab cake Benedict is also a nice spin on the classic brunch dish. Definitely a must try when you're in Montreal. Wake up early so you don't have to wait at least an hour in line."

Everything about it, the decor, the menu, the service, everything exceeded our expectations. We had a large party of 14 girls on a Saturday for my bachelorette party. Some girls went earlier in the morning to stand in the line and get our name in, which is highly recommended. They waited about 45 minutes and by the time the rest of the group got there, we were ready to be seated. It was insane as there was continuously a line outside, so make sure to get there early.The menu had everything you can imagine - from food to drinks. We ordered a lot and sampled each others. I personally got the huevos rancheros which were good, but I do have to admit, it is more of a breakfast burrito than huevos rancheros and that was unexpected. Every drink ordered from the chai latte, to the almond latte, to the bloody Cesar to the green smoothie was so delicious too. Each meal even came with the freshest fruit appetizer! To top off our great experience, the staff was so friendly and accommodating and the bathroom was a very cool site to see. The location is also great, as after brunch we walked a bit to Mont Royal for a hike. I definitely recommend!"

A hipster diner with great service and a fun, artsy vibe. Yes, the bathrooms are epic with black lighting, day glo paint, and creative, tattoo style art. Worth a visit. For food, we ate on a Monday morning at 10:30am and the place was busy with a short wait. We started with watermelon infused flat water and a massive and otherworldly good nutella and raspberry milkshake. My blueberry and basil mimosa, new for me, was a pleasant surprise. All breakfast appears to start with a skewer of fruit - pineapple, melon, canteloupe, grapefruit, and watermelon - which was yummy and by far the healthiest thing we had as we embarked on a large breakfast journey.For entrees, the Sugar Shack is a massive, lumberjack portioned platter with perfectly made pancakes, pork bbq, paté, baked beans, fried eggs, and freshly made bread for the toast, an incredibly well prepared feast. Every component was excellent. I ordered the huevos rancheros, which was also terrific and a very large portion: too much for me to finish and with a nice green sauce and pico de gallo on top. The breakfast potatoes were fantastic, too.We were full for many hours and walked from Mile End to the old city, the port, and the Golden Mile, 22,795 (8.6 miles) steps to be exact, to get remotely close to working off the meal. This is a must visit while in MTL."

There's atleast 10 different benedicts to choose from (I was in Benedict heaven), tons of omelettes, sweet pancake/French toast options (& not your typical sweet flavors - all very unique), and much more. Oh - & the drinks. Fresh juices, fun coffee combinations (Nutella?!), milkshakes, teas. We went with 2 matcha lattes, the traditional Benedict for me, the veggie goat cheese Benedict for my sister, and 2 carrot cake CREAM CHEESE icing pancakes. Just gained 5lbs typing that. You also get a fruit skewer to start - a simple, but appreciated, touch. The lattes were unbelievable, benedicts to die for & the carrot cake wheat pancakes had me melting in my chair. Also - their normal pancake entree comes with 4 pancakes.. not to be taken lightly. You can ask for just 1.. or 2.. or 3 as a side to your entree, if you need that sweet + salty mixAll in all.. don't miss this stop!"

I just love the decor. Very nice and psychedelic painting. Even the restroom have its own touch. Check the pics I posted. There are lots of great drinks and cocktails.  We ordered l'indecis eggs tour style bacon , beans, sausage, the usual but it is very tasty. You can feel the mix of flavor in a single platter. Their pancakes looks like homemade ones from scratch without any pre-made ingredients. You can taste the difference between what l'Avenue serves and what the other commercial restaurants offer.I would add that their portions are amazing, big and very generous. I would highly suggest this restaurant for a traditional breakfast on a winter or summer day and also to discover new tastes.I like the waiters and the hostess. They are professional.

I got the ""a little bit of everything"" breakfast which was good but I would say the French toast and pancakes were better than the rest of the breakfast. Drinks were good. I had the Bloody Cesar which is a Bloody Mary with a bit of clam juice mixed in there. It's a Canadian thing and I enjoyed it. Inside the atmosphere was busy. Lots of noise and a lot of things going on which is what you would expect in a somewhat crowded and popular brunch spot. The bathroom is really cool too. It's kind of like a club in there with a night light and drawings on the walls. I think next time I will try a different rendition of eggs Benedict. There are so many to choose from.

L'avenue continues to astound with their extremely top notch dishes. I wish I could pin point one dish and say it's a must try but this place has it all. As amazing as this is, I am always tempted to jump over to the next table and dig my face into their dishes as well (please be warned) Orange juice is fresh, chorizo eggs Benedict is what I forced my friends to order. The raspberry Nutella milkshake was from another magical world. I extremely loved the service as well, even while at the queue they kept us informed on how long it would take. I'd recommend everyone to surely go here, but plan it out and go early so you wouldn't be stuck waiting and starving. This place is the epitome of a perfect restaurant experience and I hope it continues to be the same.

I've ordered the sweet, savory crunchy Benedict the last two times I was there and highly recommend the dish. The carrot cake pancakes were another highlight I've had. So good. I do have a complaint for the kitchen though. We were there yesterday around 10:30 a.m. and my sweet savory crunchy Benedict was not thoroughly cooked. The French Toast part was soggy and dense in the center and even worst, it was tepid. So eating the egg/milk mixture raw was rather unpleasant. It was very busy yesterday (as usual) so I think the cooks were just rushing a bit. The food came out fast which I appreciated but would have preferred to wait a bit to have a fully cooked dish. I didn't tell the waiter my food wasn't cooked all the way through because he was just busy and I didn't want to bother anyone. Next time I will probably just ask for the French toast part to be extra well done. I actually brought half the dish home and finished cooking it myself. It was yummy even as leftovers. The portions are so huge, it's really two meals for me."

These spicy sweet mouthfuls of wonderful came with a cream cheese sauce, which was a little overkill, but I still put maple syrup on it because once I commit, I go all the way. My latte was really good too but I'm still thinking about those pancakes. I love that the bathroom is an experience.

The potatoes were really good too and we got a side order of the carrot cake pancake! Life hack! Too bad you can't get side orders of the French toast!

Looking for a brunch place, I ended up choosing L'Avenue. There was a small waiting line around 10am on a Wednesday morning. We were 2 and waited for about 10-15 mins before being seated.Inside, the tables are very close to each other so you might bump into the person next to you. As I was very hungry, I ordered the ""Take-It-All"", which consisted of 2 eggs, 1 sausage, 2 pieces of bacon, pulled pork, beans, potatoes, crouton, a french toast and a pancake for about 18$ before taxes. Needless to say, the portions were huge and finishing the whole plate was a big task. As for the flavor itself, I found the mix between the different parts of the plate mixing very well together with a mix of salty and sweet. The best part in my opinion was the french toast. Would recommend if you need your brunch fix, but beware, come early if you don't want to be stuck in line waiting!"

A bit of a distance from where I was staying but trust me, it's worth the drive and the wait! I arrived during the week around 11ish and the restaurant was packed. It was about a 10-15 minute wait. The restaurant is very narrow so seating can be a bit tight if seated at a table. To start, I ordered the strawberry and watermelon mimosa. It tasted very healthy and although I could see the bubbly, I thought no alcohol was in it... Until I got to the bottom of the glass. Lol. It was delicious. For my meal I ordered the first meal under Bachelor #1 (if looking at the menu- sorry forgot the name of it) which came with French toast, 2 range-free eggs, bacon, breakfast potatoes and a bowl of fruit compote. I asked the waitress what range-free is and I still couldn't comprehend the difference but they tasted like regular eggs in my opinion. Nonetheless,  the meal was amazing! The homemade Canadian syrup was perfect with the French toast. The potatoes were another fav,  bacon cooked just right and not burnt and the fruit were fresh & added a healthy ending. There was no way i could get to the toast or finish the rest of my potatoes (& I LOVE potatoes). From glancing around, I can't imagine what a weekend crowd looks like or how long the wait time is.  I also noticed they serve water infused with fresh watermelon. There is a full bar. The waitress was very attentive and delivered service with a smile. The menu was pretty comical and creative and some of the names resembled other cities/countries around the world. I would highly recommend this place if you're in the area and looking for a breakfast/brunch spot. It's worth the drive/bus ride and the wait! Kudos."

The bacon was a 1/10 (flavorless, thin and just breaks apart when you lift it). The maple syrup had no flavor as well, but I guess thats what makes it work on pancakes that already have so much going on with them. Service: 7/10. Nothing special. Not bad. We did have to wait outside during brunch hours due to overcrowding. The dining area is also very cramped. You'll find yourself sitting extremely close to other people while eating.If I ever do come back to montreal, i may re-visit this spot (if Tim Horton's runs out of maple bagels).

Luckily, all the stores on Avenue du Mont Royal were putting on a massive sidewalk sale, so we checked that out for a bit while we waited.I ordered two eggs with a choice of ham. It also comes with fruit and potatoes. I love that the fruit skewer they give you ain't the syrupy prepackaged stuff you get at most places. It's a legit skewer. Also the potatoes were fantastic. I couldn't stop shoveling them into my mouth even after my tummy said it was full. Egg and ham were good, as expected. For under 10 CAD, I was ultra stuffed--- this place is an amazing deal for breakfast! Service was also friendly but not intrusive.My only con is that the tables are literally inches apart. You can 100% eavesdrop on your dining neighbors' conversations even if you don't want to. Need to use the restroom? You'll need to be exactly 3 inches wide in order to squeeze past the tables.Now onto the restrooms...a general rule of mine is to never bring my phone to the bathroom (e-coli y'all) but this was the one exception. I just had to document the neon graffiti! The restroom had a tough, urban vibe without the worry of stepping on used needles or discarded spoons. I was bummed that they didn't have the peeper clock turned on though (I checked both stalls).Overall, I'd say it's worth it to check out L'Avenue for the fruit skewers, potatoes, and their vibes and friendly service."

/user_details?userid=n2UJWrrHir7dWL7pyFO8Rw,Ji L.,"Fulton, MD",5 star rating,"Came here on a Monday around 8:45 am -- it was our last hurrah before driving back home to Boston. There was already a line; Thankfully, we were at the front of it and able to be seated quickly.My husband ordered a ""I'll have it all"" (which as the name states comes with everything: a fresh fruit croquette, eggs, bacon, sausage, beans, potatoes, french toast, and pancakes served with maple syrup) and I ordered the ""Mister Seguin II"" (eggs benedict with hollandaise, goat cheese, spinach, mushrooms, and potatoes). Oh man. Where do I start? Everything here was absolutely AMAZING. This was hands down the BEST brunch of all time (and I'm an avid bruncher). After this place, I feel like I don't need to brunch anymore. It satisfied every brunch need. If I had to pick my favorite of favorites, I'd go with the pancakes and french toast -- both were just so FLUFFY; next would be their crispy and savory potatoes and sausage. My one critique is that the tanginess of the goat cheese was too much in my Mister Seguin II (I would order something different next time -- like a platter of pancakes with a side of potatoes and sausage :)).Thank you L'Avenue for making me INSANELY happy. This brunch was Epic. Interior: modern, street grudge with exposed brick and graffiti; Please stop by the bathroom -- it's THE coolest (just do it). Service: attentive, helpful, and friendly."

My wife and I came here before taking a trip to Mount Royal. Their breakfast menu is pretty darn big. Full range of choices for whatever floats your boat. They have free range eggs here and gluten free options. Big plus... There are lots of choices for egg benedict's here. We are both egg benedict fans. Wife got the mushroom benedict and she was happy with it. I ordered the classic. It was good but it had an extremely intense ham taste. It was a little too sweet for my taste buds. I wouldn't order it again. It has friendly service and the decor is hippyish. I would definitely return to try out other items.

Our food was delicious, I would get something different though next time. The French toast was AMAZING and I've been craving it since. The coffee is a little brunt tasting however, but it is bottomless for about 1.50. Also, the mimosas are delicious :)"

We didnt eat in a rush and the quality of food is very good.We ordered: Beautiful truffle - recommend to share among two or three people. Truffle omelette is flavorful and there were loads of different mushrooms.Duck benedict - love their benefit pouched egg. Duck is well cooked but its not for everyone. For me,  it's a bit dry but my friends love it. Order it if you love duck!Service:  friendly and helpful staff, that's how they keep their customers to stay in line even they have to wait for 1 hour"

I gave it a 4 star and not 5 only because the long lines take some out of the experience. Try the amazing natural shakes, out of this world egg benedicts and outstanding pancakes.

The chicken was good but the mushroom was exceptional. Since they serve potatoes on the side, they should tone down the potatoes or even take em out of the chicken benedict. The fruit platter that came with the entre was a great touch. Also, make sure to visit the restroom. It is really cool!!"

For starters I'm not a huge brekfast person so in order for me to feel this strongly about brekfast food says alot! My friend & I waited on line outside for about 45 minutes which was the only downfall but it was well worth it!! The inside of this place is so stylish and upbeat. The food is phenomenal. I got montreal smoked meat eggs benedict with a watermelon mimosa and my friend got the Huevos Rancheros dish. It was comparable to a mexican egg wrap. She got the watermelon mimosa as well and they were delicious. Even looking at the dishes of the people sitting next to us my mouth was watering!!! Everything looks amazing. I will definitley be returning to this resteraunt next time im in Montreal and I already recommended it to some friends that will be traveling there soon!!!

Waiiiiiit you're not here for the decor are you? Here's how my food experience was : Food is good! The Smoked Salmon was a delish! Not too dry, right how it should be. The Bobby does Dallas was #2, I'd recommend the smoked salmon over the Bobby does Dallas. It had too many mushrooms in my opinion. The juice from the mushrooms was the main taste that you get while chewing but still a unique taste! By the way, EXPECT TO WAIT OUTSIDE BEFORE GETTING A TABLE. Even before noon... That tells a lot about this place right? I will definitely come back (so my girlfriend can visit the bathroom which I heard is really beautiful... but yeah! She forgot to go see how it looked like last time so I have to go back)."

We also had hot chocolate which was served with whipped cream and a strawberry. My girlfriend ordered what was essentially a club sandwich but with a fried egg instead of chicken, and she also rates her dish with 5 stars.

My friend and I went here on a weekday morning around 8:45am and we were seated right away. We both ordered their Steak and eggs Benedict. It was recommended to us by the waiter. He said it is their signature dish. Although it was tasty, it was way too rich and filling. We could have easily split one dish. I also ordered a Raspberry, Strawberry and Liche juice. It was huge and way too filling. I only drank a quarter of it because if I drank anymore i would have been stuffed. We also ordered Hot Chocolates. They were good.I would definitely come here again next time I am in Montreal, but will order something completely different. They had a lot of great sounding items on their menu. If I had any more time left in Montreal I would have made my way one more time to L'Avenue, unfortunately we leave tomorrow. Their bathrooms are really cool. They also give you watermelon infused water, which is a nice touch. I also thought the prices were pretty reasonable being how filling and hearty everything was.Give them a try."

We had thought about eating here earlier, but was scared off by the super long queues the day prior. We figured there wouldn't be as long of a wait on a Monday morning, and we were right. We were seated almost immediately upon reaching the restaurant.Aside from the eclectic decor, the menu offers plenty of different options to suit most palates. I got their truffled mushroom omelette, which I thought erred a little on the bland side, though the mushrooms themselves were delicious. The potatoes that came with my dish were also good, but at this point in my trip, I kind of never wanted to see another potato again. Portions were gargantuan so I definitely felt like I got my money's worth, but I thought the food would've been jaw-droppingly awesome considering how long the queues had been just the day before, and presumably every weekend. I'm not sure I would've waited for more than half an hour for the meal I had been served, to be quite honest, so I was especially glad that I didn't have to wait when we actually ate here.Service was excellent, though, and the bathrooms were also quite interesting. Oh, and every entree comes with fruit skewers and watermelon flavored water. 3.5 stars, really."

I thought the carrot pancakes were sweet and delicious. They were fluffy pancakes and tasted like delicious carrot cake. It is definitely the type of brunch plate for someone with a sweet tooth. Another thing they really know how to make well is their French toast! I enjoyed their French toast with Nutella and strawberries. Another French toast plate that was super impressive is the one topped with green apples and cheese with the perfect maple type sauce to go with it. SUPER YUMMY. I am not a big fan of their coffee, but the amazing service and decor really does make up for the coffee and line ups. Either way, line ups do mean many people are waiting on good food ;)"

While on line, I kept thinking that it was not going to be worth it or that I was just setting myself up for disappointment. But no, it was everything I wanted in a brunch.I ordered the chorizo benedict and it was amazing. I don't even know how to describe it other than amazing. It was the perfect combination of flavors. I had a bite of my friend's French toast and it was the best French toast I have ever had - it was crunchy and soft at the same time like I don't know how that was possible.Do not order the strawberry raspberry drink. It's in a lot of photos because it's cute and pink, but it is VERY overpowering with basil. I was not a fan. I think their drinks are not as great as their food.Decor is very interesting - lots of graffiti (especially neon-colored in the bathrooms - take photos!) and bikes decorating the wall. Service was AMAZING. Given that there's a LONG wait outside, I somewhat expected to be rushed. But they did not rush at ALL. They were so patient. Food came out quickly. The waitress was very helpful and answered all of our questions.Definitely worth the wait if you're in town. I'm not sure if I would suggest going at 8 AM cause this is a LARGE meal to be eating that early in the morning, but you could go that early if you're super hungry and want to avoid the wait."

When we got the menu my partner and I where amazed with how many items there where on the menu. I already had my eye on the French toast with strawberries, blueberries and bananas with a dulce de leche whipped cream so I ordered that. The first thing that came was two at fruit skewers that were a good start to the meal. When the main course came and I took my first bite of the French toast it was unbelievable.

We waited over an hour (as expected) to get a table here. Luckily the weather was beautiful, and they had free fresh lemonade for anyone in line. The space was a little cramped, and once we were seated, we still had to wait for menus since they didn't have enough.I had very high expectations for the food because everyone raved about it being the best brunch spot in Montreal. My bf and I shared a smoothie, which was okay, but it had too much raspberry flavor, and I didn't taste whatever else the waitress described it having (supposedly strawberry, basil, etc). What was nice though is that they give you a free plate of fruit on a skewer. I got the steak and eggs benedict with potatoes. The potatoes were probably the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had- they were cooked perfectly and had a hint of salty and sweet flavor to them. For my steak and eggs (and mushrooms) benedict, it was delicious. However, my poached eggs were overcooked and they didn't ooze out like they were supposed to. This was a little disappointing, but overall I still enjoyed my meal here."

The ambiance is hip and modern, and the menus are super cute. Was generally super fun to look around, and the bathrooms were memorable. I stared around the room for a few minutes after I finished my business just to read everything on the wall. The food. Bruh. The food. It's delicious. The fruit skewer we got in the beginning was super fresh and a great start to a meal. Also - the maple syrup. For any uninitiated Americans like me and my boyfriend, that maple syrup will change your life forever and leave you continuously disappointed by the pathetic sugar-water that Americans call ""maple syrup."" The syrup was so delicious, and had a slight vanilla taste. I could chug that shit endlessly. There's a lot of food as well.It was so good that I recovered enough to come back two days later.So, take the time to wait for L'Avenue.

It definately lived up to it's reputation as being one of the best breakfast places in Montreal. I recommend going before 10:30 am if you are a group. The max group they can fit is a table of 8. After 10:30 the line risks to be longer but well worth the wait! The resto itself is cozy and orginally decorated with graffiti like painting on the walls. The service is super-friendly and welcoming. Now to the food ..absolutely mouthwatering!  The eggs Benedict dishes are truly unlike any other I have tasted and truly wonderful.

I don't think I've ever waited at a brunch restaurant on a weekday (that's how I knew it must be really good). The menu is both incredible to look at (just trust me) and full of way too many incredible looking food options. It was so hard to decide! I ended up getting the fruity breakfast- two eggs, bacon, French toast, fresh fruit, potatoes, and a toasted baguette. It was so much food! The French toast was so buttery, and honestly the best of my life. PLEASE order their French toast!!! The potatoes are so flavorful and delicious. They serve real maple syrup in a can and a really fun fruity jam for the toast. Everything was flawless! Literally my only complaint would be that I got too much fruit haha Everyone I was with was so thrilled with their food - it's 300% worth the wait!

Too bad for us, we went on one of the busiest weekends of the year, and waited 1.5 hours for brunch. Despite the good food, I probably would think twice before coming back again.I ordered the Indecisive, which comes with 2 savoury items (I chose the sausage and baked beans) and 1 sweet item (Nutella strawberry french toast for me). I thought the savoury items were mediocre, with the baked beans a bit cold for my liking. The standout item for me was definitely the french toast - the combination of toast, fresh strawberries, nutella, whip cream, and maple syrup is heavenly. I devoured it eagerly, despite the big serving portion. In hindsight, I did not feel like the dish was too unique, but I know there are more creative french toast options in their menu. I also heard great things about their eggs benedict here and it's a shame we never got to try it. I find my time to be too precious to wait in line for that long again, but certainly I would recommend coming here right when they open at 8am."
/user_details?userid=k8-idtcrxLOqocWI8PM3VA,Joshua L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Day 1: Let's go to L'avenue for brunch. We show up and there's like 20 people in line. ""Nahhhh we don't do lines, we'll come back tomorrow""Day 2: We walk our pompous asses back only to find about a 100 people in line (some even getting very touchy with each other in line. I get that brunch is a sexy thing but come on, it only made me hangrier. Respect the art of brunching am I right.)Finally getting a table after what felt like eternity with Rico Sauve and his sidepiece going all Selena Gomez à la ""can't keep my hands to myself"", things were looking rosier. The menu has everything you want and nothing you don't, but these guys thought of it all and offer the generous ""indecisive"" option. French Toast: Well what can I say, as thick as a good steak, but soft and pillowy like the dreams I should be chasing. (Instead I'm stuffing my face at brunch) Maple syrup comes in a full can, butter comes in cream form, and fruits come clutch to make you feel like everything you're eating is good for you. The Indecisive: Pretty ironic actually that they still give you a few choices for the indecisive. That being said, salted pretzels on a stack of pancakes could not be ignored by us. Perfection in pancake form can be found here at L'avenue. Salty from the pretzels, sweet from the maple, pancakes porous enough to soak up the dulce leche; and with potatoes, sausages and ham...we could have fed a village with all the food we had. It's also notable to mention that once the food in the table, there was silence for a good 15 mins, and then there were groans of how stuffed I was, and then I finished the remaining half of my plate cause you know, I was bound to get hungry again in a few hours, and we didn't want that now did we. Service also exceptionally good considering how packed and busy this place is. If service here can be this good, it makes me wonder how I can't even get a coffee above 40 degs at Denny's.Bonus: Super trippy UV neon glow-in-the-dark bathroom. Not for me though, I prefer my hygiene to be in the middle of the light spectrum (ie fully visible)"

We found L'Avenue just through a few google searches and were immediately seated upon arrival. What's funny is we chose the place because it looked like it would have a good burger, although once we walked through the restaurant, we realized that everyone was ordering eggs benedict.When we looked at the menu and realized that they had an entire page dedicated to eggs benedicts, we realized this was one of their specialty. My boyfriend ordered the classic benedict and it came with the BEST ham I think either of us have ever tasted. I ordered some sort of benedict that came with spinach and goat cheese. Both were SO good.The meal came with potatoes on the side and a fruit skewer as an appetizer. Both my boyfriend and I commented on how fresh the fruit tasted compared to other restaurants. Our server was amazingly attentive and our food arrived quickly.I'm not sure that I would change anything about the experience. This place is worth a visit. My boyfriend said that he would eat breakfast every day of this trip there and be completely happy."

In the end, I picked the eggs benedict with duck confit, which also included fruits.- eggs benedict with duck confit: the portion is really big, I could barely finish it. The potato that came with it was SO FREAKING GOOD! Probably the best potatos I've had in my entire life. The potatos still holded its shape but the texture is similar to mashed potatos, and the seasoning is just so on point. The eggs were great too, but I found the duck confit too sweet.

Great food and drinks, solid service, dope bathrooms and there's free WiFi for all those Americans with their phones on airplane mode like me.

It comes with savory potatoes, which only adds to the meal. Each dish also comes with a fruit skewer, which is greatly appreciated.I also love their smoothies. Not too sweet and super fresh.

I ordered the Nutella French toast with the rum sauce and my girlfriend got a mixed plate of various brunch fare. They give you a little assorted fruit skewer before your food arrives. Adorable. The food was seriously amazing. I didn't think I would finish all of it, but I did and I was immediately ready for a nap. The French toast was so fluffy and airy, the sauce was very sweet without being too sweet, and they gave you a bunch of bananas to boot. My girlfriend really enjoyed her food as well. The only thing that was less than perfect (terrible, really) was the mojito. I don't know what the bartender did to my drink, but it was almost 3/4 full with straight mint, stems and all. It tasted like what I imagine Shrek's swamp water tastes like. Just way too minty and bitter. All in all, the food is great and the place is really cool. Make sure to check out the bathrooms."

Not a lot of nuance in their food.My voracious eater of a bf felt like he was going to puke afterwards, partly because it was a lot of food, but partly because it was just really oily and heavy.Again, good for a hangover for sure.

The breakfast potatoes was very good, one of the best ones I've had. The scrambled eggs in the Dallas was cooked very well and was perfectly fluffy. I usually hate scrambled eggs because of the runny texture but this one was almost like a fluffy omelet. The duck beni was on the sweeter side but was delicious as well with a runny yoke."

The menu was huge and featured pretty much any breakfast option you could think of including omelets, French toast, bagels, huevos rancheros, shakshuka, breakfast poutine, and so on. It was overwhelming and difficult to decide what to order because I wanted to try everything. I eventually settled on the Duck Benedict with was phenomenal! The toasted English muffins were topped with perfectly yolky poached eggs, tender duck confit, sweet caramelized onions, and flavorful grained mustard hollandaise sauce. The side of roasted potatoes was savory and filling. The dish was huge and, unfortunately, I could not physically finish everything.

It was big enough to share and was a great mix. Then, the eggs benedict with steak and mushrooms ($17.77); which was our favourite. The perfect mix of hollandaise sauce combined with the egg and steak. Definitely would recommend. We also got the Bon Ben Moi Je Prends Toute! (Ben, I'll have everything!)

They also serve watermelon water which was my first time having - also amazing. The wait was a while.. but that's only because we came around 1pm with 9 people. Def worth coming back if I stop by Montreal again!"

The line up might be a turn off, so come early! We arrived at about 9ish and still waited almost 30 minutes. They also provide you English menus, so if you want you can request for one, or if the server hears you speaking English they'll hand one to you lol. The smoked salmon benedict was cooked to perfection, and the hollandaise sauce was really creamy. I'd say it's a big portion but I devoured mine because it was that good!

We each ordered a variant of the infamous eggs benedicts. We tried the duck confit, crab cake, and salmon versions. The salmon was just ok, while the duck confit was tasteless and dry. The crab cake was the best, or it just seemed that way because it was just better than the other two benedicts.Usually I don't comment about appetizers that I didn't order, but the fruit plate was not good. The pineapple and melons were unripe and tasted extremely sour. I also understand this is a popular and busy place, but it doesn't justify subpar service. Our server was extremely slow and somewhat disengaged. During the middle of our ordering process , she went to help another table and then returned without apologizing. Okay, and then she asked us to repeat our entire order again since she forgot to write it down the first time. We had such high expectations of brunching at this Montreal icon, but from our experience, we are reluctant to ever come back."

Service is friendly, decor is modern and upbeat, portions are Goliath massive, and the food is delicious. We're so glad we picked this spot for breakfast during our touristy weekend in Montreal. First, note that there's a wait. And they don't take reservations. We arrived right when it opened at 8:00 AM (we're morning people) on a Saturday morning and there was already a lineup. We waited about 5 minutes or so, and we were seated at a booth towards the middle of the restaurant. Second, if you're driving. Street parking is free on Saturdays before 9:00 AM. Luckily, we finished eating just in time - otherwise, you will have to pay (watch for the signs indicating the times you can and cannot park).Third, the food. The menu is entirely in French, but our server wisely knew we were tourists and translated what we needed. We had a) the French Toast with apple slices and bacon (which sounds weird but it totally worked), b) Eggs Benny with cheese, mushrooms, and other veggies. The food was delightful but sizes were so big that we found it very difficult to finish everything (share, if you can!). Everything came with a fruit skewer, which was fresh and delicious. We also ordered tea and a Nutella latte (which was okay, didn't really taste the Nutella). Overall, the food is great, service is top notch, so if you can, COME EARLY to avoid a wait for a table.For two people, with tax, and tip, we paid around $40.00. A hearty breakfast and a great start to a touristy day."

We got a table right away, and quickly received 4 mountains of delicious, eggy foods that probably took years from our lives but it was worth it. I got the truffle omelette (yum). My parents both got Bobby Visits Spain (I think that's the translation?) and looked overwhelmed but overjoyed. My boyfriend went for the Indecisive option and had eggs, sausage, and carrot cake pancakes. All of it was unreal. Plus, service was friendly and the ambiance was fun.

/user_details?userid=cTCoz9LPdwEDiMNNMPfbUw,Rachel K.,"Portland, ME",3 star rating,"We visited this place for brunch on our first full day in Montreal. I guess we got lucky because we were seated immediately. On our way out there was a line of people waiting down the block and apparently, that's common. We were here for the food, but I have to confess I was completely distracted by the atmosphere. We were seated in the back near the coffee station and it was possibly the worst spot in the entire restaurant. On one side we were an inch from the next table... so close that I felt like I was practically dining WITH them and on the other side servers were passing us constantly. It was distracting and chaotic and honestly, made it very hard for me to enjoy my meal. I wish we would have requested a booth and would advise doing so even if it means waiting longer.Now, on to the food. It was yummy and plentiful! My honey and I both got versions of their eggs benedict. He got the one with duck and mine had mushrooms and goat cheese. I enjoyed mine, but with the combination of the goat cheese and hollandaise sauce it was really rich. I had a hard time eating even half of it. The potatoes were delicious. My favorite part of the meal was probably the plentiful coffee and the free fruit skewer they give you before your meal arrives. I had never seen that before and thought it was a really nice touch! Our server was attentive, but not overly friendly. I could tell he had a lot of tables and was trying to be as efficient as possible. Overall, a good meal, but I wonder if this is one of those places where the buzz is better than the actual experience....PS- They now have menus in English so no need to worry about that if you don't speak French!"

A popular place in the area was closed for brunch only for us to find out at the restaurant doorstep. Major bummer, right? We scrambled around for a decent place and were led to L'Avenue. A line was forming out the door so we too, had to fall in. Half an hour later of standing out in the cold, a table opens up for two. Booyah! We walked in to a warm and vibrant atmosphere of brunchers and their libations in hand. It was the weekend after all! My friend and I were more than happy to join in the fun. The place was packed, loud, and colorful! It felt like one big party was going on inside and I loved every bit of the vibe in the room. Our server was very French and so was the menu. No English menu available. Sure I could read some of the ingredients but who was I kidding?! I was starving and had no intention on doing a refresher of culinary French terms. Our very kind and quick server explained the menu to us so graciously and led us to order two kinds of eggs benedict that we will remember for quite some time...STEAK and EGGS. Wow! It was a beautiful plate full of promise. One bite and I was in heaven. Meat was tender and amazingly flavorful. The hollandaise sauce was fantastic. The egg, ohhh the egg! I cut into it and it was oozing with yellow silky yolk all over my plate. What a sight that was to behold. EGGS BENEDICT on FRENCH TOAST. Ahhhmazing! The perfect combination of sweet and savory in every spoonful. The toast was fluffy with a nice touch of ""coconutty"" sweetness while the ham, egg, and sauce had enough brine to let each ingredient shine. Yeah, that rhymed! Can't decide which one I like better but these two Bennies are without a doubt the best I've had, just yet.Servings are quite large but they're so good you'll end up finishing it anyway. My friend and I had one of each since an order comes with two pieces. Perfect sharing item, indeed. Both came with delicious rosemary seasoned potatoes and fresh fruits on the side. How complete can that brunch be? On that note, let's not forget how fantastic their mimosas were. Freshly squeezed OJ with some pulp and the right ratio of champagne to juice. Cheers! To wait out in the cold was a pain but I would have done it all over again on this same trip if only time was our friend in this city. I highly recommend!"

Food was great but not sure if would be down for another hour wait When you come to L'Avenue du Plateau, every order comes with a fruit skewer, watermelon infused water and amazing service.Disclaimer: the menu is only in French and pretty much ordered using yelp suggestions.Decided on the original eggs benedict which comes with pulled pork. Seemed like at least half of the restaurant orders this and it did not disappoint. Eggs were perfectly runny and the english muffin was warm and fluffy and the pulled pork succulent covered by this amazing sauce.Next up is Bobby does Dallas. This comes with eggs with cheese, sautéed onions, really well seasoned garlic potatoes and few pieces of steak. This comes with bread and is perfect for those looking for a hearty and filling meal.Also tried the french toast with bananas, nutella, rum sauce and coconut shreds.Almost didn't get this because how good can French toast get? We already had 2 entrees for 2 people but we thought we waited an hour for this so might as well get some extra food for the drive back to Toronto. IT WAS SO GOOD. I unquestionably have a sweet tooth so while some people might think the French toast is too sweet, it was perfect to me. The toast was fluffy and drenched in deliciously sweet syrup. My favorite part was the coconut shreds.The portions here are huge and 3 was definitely aggressive. I think even with only 2 things we would've had leftovers.PS: Don't leave before checking out the bathroom. Promise you've never seen washrooms like it before."

Thank goodness, on Saturdays, breakfast is served from 8am till 4pm.If you come during the week, you can also enjoy salads, sandwiches, poutines, hamburgers, milkshakes, martinis, steak, stews, curry, other pub fare!For over 20 years, l'Avenue is best known for their Eggs Benedict of which favorites are the Chorizo, Steak and Eggs or the 'Tout l'Monde à Poële' variations. I went for the third option. Wow, the two gigantic portions were just sitting in front of me waiting to be devoured. The eggs were perfectly poached, oozing with golden yolk as you dug your way in, beautifully dressed with sautéed Champignons de Paris, Pleurotes, Portobello mushrooms and lusciously coated with creamy hollandaise sauce. The eclectic atmosphere and excellent service from a dynamic team of smiling waiters, especially Jezabel, who was so patient with me most definitely adds stars to the experience. Kudos to owner Johnny Di Tomasso, a meticulous planner and team builder! Will I return to try the Chorizo at L'Avenue? I sure will and so should you.

The dinner, dessert, and cafe scene are definitely its stronger suits. But on this day, that all changed. We stood in line for about half an hour, which isn't all that bad because you meet people and become friendly with the crowd pretty quickly. Once inside, we all tried our hands at different breakfast drinks. My buddy got some mimosas, another ordered a coffee, and I opted for a delicious mango, lichee, pineapple smoothie that tasted oh so fresh (despite it being the last week of January)!The lingering memory of their decadent French Toast is still on my mind.

For example, finding the best burger, the best pizza or the best taco joint, etc... Well, if you're making that list for Eggs Benedict, I think you may need a pit stop at Restaurant L'avenue in #Montreal.We snuck in before a 30 minute wait and grabbed the last table by the door in this ever so hip, yet a bit small restaurant. With only French menus, I did decipher a few things, but our lovely waitress in a hurry let us know that they are known for their Eggs Benedict. We ordered up 2 sets of Bennies, his with Montreal smoked meat, swiss, mustard and of course hollandaise and mine with mushrooms, garlic aioli, bacon and hollandaise. They arrived about 15 minutes or so later. Cold. Boo, but silver lining is that they were still some of the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had.That hollandaise sauce was superb. So light and airy, with hints of lemon, but oh so rich and creamy with the perfect consistency. The flavor combo of the mushrooms, bacon and garlic confit was heavenly and oh so different in the best way possible from the rich and salty bites of smoked meat covered in dripping yolk. If it was a tad bit warmer, the dish would have been unquestionably one of the best things I've eaten in a while. If this wasn't enough, the dishes were accompanied with perfectly seasoned breakfast potatoes and a skewer of delicious fresh fruit. I was stuffed to the gills by the end of this proper brunch and although Eggs Benedict are quite gluttonous, I didn't feel too heavy or guilty.So this leads me to why this review was not five stars. Our service lacked a bit, hence cold food. Not sure if this is a regular thing here, but they were severely understaffed. Granted it was a Monday at 11am and they were slammed, but with only 2 servers for the 50 people seated, I'd imagine that was why our food was cold. Another negative was that the coffee sucked, comparable to dirty diner coffee with the creamer packets on the side.The other dishes being served look magnificent and in a foodie city like Montreal, when there's a savage line on a Monday late morning, you know whatever they're serving must be good. Bonus: One of the coolest, if not THE coolest bathrooms ever. Worth the trip even if you don't have to pee."

There was a lot more food than expected on the plate! Cost was on the pricier side but I think it's worth it given the extra presentation and fancier menu options (helloooo free range eggs!!). My friends also had the crab cake Benedict and it was also good! Both the duck and the crab cakes were really dense though (but rich and tasty) but that's probably why we were so full after eating just one. I'll be back to try out the other menu items!

We were both very happy with our fruit plates. Very big portions too, although you wouldn't think so looking at some of the dishes.

Street art and graffiti was prominent everywhere, and yes I am talking about L'Avenue. The bathroom was literally graffiti with blacklight everywhere.So the food. My god the food. Wait, lets start with drinks. So I ordered a hot chocolate to start, and it took a while to get to my table (besides the fact that it was super crowded). I asked the waitress and she said it was coming, so when it did, I was stunned. This isn't your Swiss Miss instant hot chocolate. This was decedent, delicious, and full on chocolate. My god I'd go back just for that. I also ordered a mango type of juice, and it was HUGE. They really don't skimp at L'Avenue. I shared it with the 4 people at my table because I couldn't finish it. So back to the food. I ordered an eggs benedict with the smoked meats, hollandaise and a side of potatoes.....get this. And only this. This was to die for, absolutely. It was like trying Montreal in one bite....every time. It was too good. We all got different things, ranging from sweet/savory french toast eggs benedict, to a little bit of everything (I'm not sure if that is what its called, but its ok).So all in all I can't stress how good this place is! 2 hours was definitely worth the wait!!!!! Can't wait to go back!"
/user_details?userid=Vlmh843lBNReVAyEJLWfRg,Stephanie D.,"BAYSIDE HILLS, NY",5 star rating,"This place came highly recommended by a friend.. and just about everyone who's been to Montreal. This place was so good we ended up coming here twice. GET THE DUCK CONFIT EGGS BENEDICT. Or anything eggs benedict. The first morning we ate here we got to the restaurant at around 10(?) and there was already a long line. The wait can get very long too as people like to sit around and chit chat and take their time here. When we finally got in, we already knew what we wanted and ordered the duck confit eggs benedict and steak and eggs benedict. We were actually looking for the crab cake eggs benny but the server said they didn't serve that anymore. Me and my bf both agreed the duck benny was the best. The slightly salty duck paired with caramelized onions and a gram-worthy poached egg was perfect. His steak and eggs were a bit runny and by the end of the meal, looked like soup. Still tasted ok though.The next morning we got here 5 minutes before it opened. No line yet but we could see people hanging around the shop slowly shifting towards the entrance. 8am we walked right up to the door with probably another 3 couples/families and got seated right away. By the time we left at 9:30 the line had formed. This time we ordered the Indecisive for me - 2 savory items (bacon and ham) and 1 sweet (nutella french toast) . French toast was so fluffy - pair that nutella with the salty bacon or ham and heaven. My bf got the I'll Have It All which is like sampler, a little bit of everything. Today's breakfast wasn't as amazing as yesterdays but still very delicious. Btw, portions are HUGE. We definitely should have split the I'll Have It All. Also, their potatoes are so well seasoned I didn't care if that whole cup of starch was what probably filled me up but I finished it all. Service is a little on the slow side. A little hard to flag someone down for whatever it was we needed. Before you leave, don't forget to check out the trippy (and kind of intimidating to pee in) bathroom!"

I believe they are open at 8am but we were there at 9am , knowing fully this placed would be so packed. However, once we got there, we were seated in about 5mins (perhaps because we are only a party of 2 and it's easier to squeeze us in). You can ask the menu to be in English and you have got to try their smoothies. I had the strawberry raspberry lychee smoothie and it was HUMONGOUS. so I had the sweet and savory eggs benedict. Holy smokes..even typing this weeks later still make my mouth waters. It was absolutely delicious. Then again, it has a huge portion. The eggs benedict menu comes with potatoes and fresh fruits. For the speediness of service, don't you worry for waiting too long. These waitresses are great and very fast in their service. For the amount that we paid, it was worth every penny."

This place is THE BEST Breakfast/ Brunch I've ever had in my LIFE and I think it will remain the best till I live. This restaurant has set the expectations bar just toooo high for me.It has long queue all the time; from the time it opens till the time it closes. So be prepared to wait in line for 20-25 mins before you will get the table. And please do wait otherwise you will miss something out of the world. You will miss one of the BEST MEALS you will ever have in your life.I wish this place was in Toronto and I could have had easy access to this HOLY GRAIL.When you go inside you will see that all the tables are jam packed but the servers are very nice they will make you feel comfortable and get you seated.Do checkout their washrooms they are FANCY!!After the server gave us the menu, I realized everything on the menu sounded so interesting that I wanted to try out everything because you guys know that I live in Toronto and can't come here everyday to have breakfast.So, I decided to ordered the dish called ""Indecisive"". Yes, they do have a dish by this name because they get customers like me everyday who wants to taste just everything on their menu.Indecisive comes with 2 choices of savoury choices and 1 choice of sweet choice. It also comes with 2 free range eggs of your choice, breakfast potatoes and fresh fruit brochette. My husband ordered steak and eggs. This also comes with fresh fruit brochette. I also order Mango, Pineapple and Lychee Exotic juice.Before our food arrived they served us fresh fruit brochette. All the fruits were actually freshly cut and good quality.They arrived our food with coffee and the exotic juice I ordered. Steak and eggs that my husband ordered was delicious and cooked to perfection. Coffee was great too.I had ordered scrambled eggs with bacon, homemade sausage and French Toast. Sausage was mind-blowing, Bacon was nice and crisp. And I literally don't have words to explain how good or great or out of the world that French Toast was. I have never had and I guess I never will have a French toast as good as it was. It was crisp from the top and as soon as you take a bite in your mouth it melted as custard. Really felt like I was having a super high quality custard which has a crisp top.You need to try this place and experience it yourself. No review can tell you enough about this place."

The place was very busy, the waiters seemed overwhelmed at the start but caught up with time and was able to serve us in a proper and decent manner...

/user_details?userid=8NbMi68s2deHfgWRZlDpog,Veronica P.,"Chino Hills, CA",4 star rating,"L'Avenue du Plateau is a popular breakfast place in Montreal and is primary known for two things: Humungous portions and their bathrooms.I had read that this place is very popular and that people start lining up quickly, so we made sure to get there early as we had a flight to catch later in the day.Upon entering, we were quickly seated. Decorations throughout the restaurant are quirky and eclectic. Some of the decorations include a huge can of maple syrup hanging from the ceiling, a mannequin, a bicycle mounted on the wall, and street art adorning the walls.The French Toast with Caramelized Bananas, Nutella, Coconut and Rum Sauce will certainly get your diabetes on in a hurry. Six super thick slices of breaded is loaded with bananas, what seems like a jar of Nutella, coconut shavings all swimming in a pool of rum sauce. If that wasn't enough, they give you a side of extra sauce to boot. The flavors went well together, but was a tad on the sweet side. My only complaint was that the French Toast was not as soggy as I like, which is the norm. I found that although I ask for French Toast super soggy, most places only comply about 1% of the time.The Montreal Smoked Meat Benedict replaces the traditional Canadian bacon with tender smoked meat. The result is a more meaty, and slightly saltier end product. That's a winning combination in my book. The Hollandaise sauce was nicely prepared and the eggs perfectly poached. The potatoes were also good, but could have been crispier.The Steak & Eggs Benedict was piled high with tender cuts of steak and meaty mushrooms covered in a black pepper heavy Hollandaise sauce. The result was another winning combination.Each dish also comes with a side of huge cuts of fruits impaled on a skewer big enough to kill Dracula, unfortunately I seem to have deleted the picture.The bathrooms are also a must visit even if you don't have to use it. Just perusing the art is worthy enough for a visit.For a fun and friendly atmosphere with good food and large portions, L'Avenue du Plateau is a must visit."

Came here for brunch and left wanting to make this our brunch spot for the remainder of our trip (and to plan a visit to come back for more). The staff was really friendly and helpful/ The food was delicious - I went with the breakfast poutine which was more than filling enough. They also have exotic fruit drinks (think smoothie), milkshakes, and a range of brunch and burgers. We spent 30 minutes flipping through the menu and wanting to order everything on it since each meal sounded very good. They have sweet, savory, and healthy options depending on your preference. As an added bonus, each meal comes with a skewer of fruit and the watermelon was soaked in the water that they serve.Additionally - this place is really eclectic. The menu cracked us up as they split up meals based on personalities. The bathroom was trippy (black lights, graffiti, a strange clock), that is worth visiting even if you don't need to use it. Overall, a great experience and a place we will return to."

My one complaint was that the chicken inside the omelet was a bit flavorless. I would have preferred the chicken to be seasoned rather than just boiled. I think that would have upped it to a 5. Got a beautiful fruit skewer to start the meal too! We also had the indecisive plate and tried the mac n cheese pancake with BBQ sauce - very southern flavor.

We had to wait a little over an hour for a table, but it was well worth it. Before I continue, a little disclaimer - I've waited this long for many a new restaurant, most of which are usually average quality, so the long wait is not a negative for me as it may be for others. There were many English speakers around us, our server spoke with us in English the whole time, and we even got an English menu. All of the staff we interacted with were super friendly and helpful when answering any questions. We got the Nutella latte, a vegan coconut milk and maple syrup coffee, carrot cake pancakes, and the chicken eggs benedict. The coffees were decent, nothing amazing. The food, however, was super tasty and a great value. The prices were comparable to (and even a bit cheaper) than other similar brunch places I've tried, but the quantities and flavor were far superior to most. The carrot cake pancakes were soft and not too sweet - my only complaint is that the plate was way too big to finish. The chicken eggs benedict came with a small Chinese salad and LOTS of potatoes. The potatoes were very well seasoned and the chicken was only lightly seasoned, so they complemented each other perfectly. The chicken and eggs were cooked perfectly, not too dry or overdone. Again, the portion size was pretty big. We weren't able to finish everything, so our server asked if we wanted to take our food to go, which was great.I would definitely recommend trying this place if you're in the area, as long as you're prepared for a 1+ hour wait."

This kept popping up as THE BRUNCH SPOT to dine at in Montreal. I love Montreal and I love brunch, so this was a no-brainer. My girlfriend and I painfully waited outside for 45 minutes but had peace of mind knowing we would soon enter the greatest brunch spot in the area. Upon entering, we were quickly seated, given water and menus. We ordered a hot Latte, an Iced Latte, and a Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice to start. The Orange juice came out quickly and we were assured the rest of the drinks were to follow. We then proceeded to order our entree's. I ordered the Bacon and Cheddar Omelet with a bagel, hash and fruit and my girlfriend ordered the sweet and savory benedict.My omelet was one of the worst ones ever eaten. It was flavorless eggs left to burn in a pan and flipped once with no seasoning. Eating it felt like a chore. There was no flavor, it was so strange. The bagel was freshly baked from a local bakery, however, the bagel was flat and flavorless. The best part of my meal was their complementary fruit.My girlfriends sweet and savory benedict was interesting. It was breaded french toast topped with ham and a poached egg. The first few bites were interesting. It tasted good given the diverse flavors. The dish fell short and should have contained powdered sugar or more sugaring within the breaded french toast. It had a great crunch but fell short of being 'sweet'. Halfway through our meal, my girlfriend's latte finally came out. It had a strange chemical aftertaste. My iced latte wasn't served until after my meal was finished despite numerous inquiries about it. The iced latte was again, flavorless. It was a watered down latte. I saw several disgruntled customers complaining about service around us, despite having a large staff presence. Overall, I had an unpleasant visit. I would not go back. With that said, many others had positive experiences and I would encourage those who are curious to try it for themselves!"

Prefect combination of sweet, salty, and savory. Beware, this food is extremely rich. We were both stuffed eating only half a plate each, and could have easily split just one."

The service is quick and friendly - though by the end of the meal you know they're trying to turn the table since there are hungry crowds to feed. The portions are humongous and the menu is so long you'll get confused trying to decide what to order. It's not a bad kind of confusion thankfully. I would recommend being savvy and splitting an omlette or giant breakfast plate and then ordering a smoothie or any of their giant drinks.

I went with a group of about 8 for a friend of mines birthday (that was actually the entire reason I was in Montreal to begin with) and we found this place on Yelp! We already knew about the long line so we decided to take it in shifts. A few people would wait while the rest would wonder and explore. So we make it inside after waiting for a little over an hour, and wait a pleasant surprise. The decor is super fun, colorful, and full of American satire. The menu, like most things in Montreal is in French but the waitress, Elise I believe her name was, she was a doll! She explained and translated everything. Everyone on my party ordered different variations of the egg Benedict. I have never tasted something so delicious and flavorful yep beautiful for breakfast/brunch ever. We went on to enjoy or food and two bottles of champagne we ordered for mimosas. I'm going to assume Elise overheard our convo about the birthday celebration because at the end of the meal she brought out a complimentary round of shots! What a sweetie! This place was amazing!

I fell in love with brunch all over again. The banana nutella, coconut rum pancakes were fluffy and chocolatey! And their crème brulee French toast are thick slices of bread that have a beautiful crystal sugary crust on the outside. Absolutely one of the best French toasts I had up to date. IT remained fluffy, moist and the crust on the toast remained crunchy even after all the maple syrup I poured on it. Unfortunately L'avenue does not do savory dishes very well I have to say. Potatoes need to be crispier and have a crust on the outer skin, and in my opinion I feel like its always undercooked. The baked beans are too tomatoey, it doesn't have that sweet savory maple syrup bacon flavor I oh so love about it. The duck confit was lacking a lot of seasoning, and hollandaise could use a big pinch of salt. The sausage is super dry and the herbs and flavoring was a little weird for my liking. This is where L'avenue lost a lot of pointsOverall, I will be returning to l'avenue and they will get their extra star with a little more love in their savoury dishes.

Also had the mango-pineapple-lychee juice (which was actually a massive smoothie, with a tiny umbrella!), so refreshing.

But it was an extra busy weekend in Montreal and even the waitress said she had never seen the line as long as it was pre-11am. Anyway, we stuck it out because L'Avenue comes highly recommended from locals + tourists alike. Kudos to the Second Cup coffee shop on the corner because they fo sho benefit from all those patient enough to wait in that line. Anyway, back to the french toast. I ordered eggs benedict with caramelized onions + cheddar for my main, which was delicious no doubt! But my bf and I ordered the plain french toast to share for dessert. We took one bite each (BANGIN') and took the rest home, which I assure you only tasted better later in the day after soaking in all that delicious, Canadian maple syrup. They use the thickest slices of brioche...so soft + fluffy but still crispy on the edges. And no joke, it tasted like a Krispy Kreme pillowy glazed donut. KK obvi is the top of the line when it comes to donuts so basically, that is heaven in french toast. Talk abt setting the bar high.While I am not one to believe the hype and wait in obscene lines, I would do it again just for that french toast.P.S. Service is very good!"

L'Avenue is a diner-like restaurant similar to Jackson Hole in New York City. They have a pretty unique decor around the restaurant. Before the entree comes out they give you fruit skewers to start off your meal. It was a nice refreshing way to start off your meal especially with the watermelon-infused water. I got to try the Smoked meat eggs benedict -- AKA pastrami eggs benedict. The smoked meat was so tender and flavorful, it had me savoring for more. The dish also came with home fries that were seasoned perfectly. I also tried the french toast that came loaded with berries & fruits on top. It was also very delicious, especially when you drizzle it with the canadian maple syrup that they provide you in a can. Portions are huge so come in ready to eat! Excellent brunch spot for sure."

My girlfriend found great Yelp reviews on L'Avenue. We walked around the corner to it and were impressed with the stylish, contemporary décor. The menu is all in French. Our skills are low. However, our waitress was helpful and described everything to us. We ordered from the Benedict section. There is a huge selection of unique, carefully crafted options. We ordered the duck (coin coin) and chorizo benedicts. They offer a gluten free option which is on portobello mushroom for $2 instead of English muffin. This is what we chose for both. Before our benedicts came to us, we were each served a big surprise skewer of fruit. Perfect! The benedicts came and they were huge. They also came with great potatoes. The duck one was savory. Lots of flavour. The chorizo one was very tasty. The sausage was a bit chewier than I prefer, but I enjoyed the flavour. We would have been fine ordering one Benedict between the two of us instead of one each. Even with my big appetite, they were way too large for us to finish and we left a lot on the plate.

Prices are reasonable. Food is delicious. And they carry my favorite brand of coffee. This is definitely a must try when visiting Montreal. I was not disappointed. If you are going to come here for brunch, make sure you get here early. I was fortunate enough to come just as they were opening and there was already a line outside. I was seated immediately but by the time that I was done, the line outside was relatively long. So worth it though."

They really do deliver! not just because the people there are so nice!Although we did wait in the cold on a Saturday morning for around 1.5 hours, I can assure you that the food is worth the wait. The eggs bennies are poaches to perfection and the hollandaise sauce is so smooth and creamy. It's pure heaven on a plate. The potatoes are seasoned nicely and everything just goes together really well. It was the best brunch I have eaten. There are ones in New York that are comparable but I would say that the flavours are not as ""full of life"", if that makes sense. It's fresh but still extremely satisfying. I think I'm going here each time I go to Montreal!"

I went here on a Thursday for brunch with a friend and the reviews were right, this place is amazing. The waiter explained how they really put an emphasis on ensuring the best quality food, and this showed when we got our food. I arrived before my friend and was worried I would have to wait for her before I could get seated (there was only one couple in front of me when I arrived) but I asked the waiter and he said I didn't have to wait and seated me right by the window. He was very friendly and helpful. I had the French toast with bananas caramelized in captain Morgan rum, with Nutella and a sauce (which a believe had rum also) with real pieces of coconut on top. The flavors went so well together and weren't overly sweet tasting. The portion size was big, I wasn't able to finish my plate. I was surprised this place was even able to accommodate my friend who has so many restrictions (doesn't eat gluten, vegetarian, and lactose intolerant). She ordered the eggs Benedict with all vegetables, substituted the English muffins for portobello mushrooms ($2 charge) and swapped out her potatoes for a salad ($1 charge). I had read someone's review saying the bathrooms will give you nightmares, so of course I had to check them out, and they're awesome. There was a lot of water on the floor though :/ I will definitely be back here. I'd suggest going on a weekday before 11am to avoid a huge lineup."

The kids loved their french toast, and I loved my omelette (which was prepared with a lot of love, one can tell these things).I would recommend L'Avenue for brunch provided the wait is not too long. And if it is, the wait will very likely be worth it :)"
/user_details?userid=JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,Zachary A.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"5 out of 5 brunch for sure.  Well worth the wait. The menu is extensive and the whole vibe of the restaurant from the interior to the music to the black light bathroom is so unique and so Montreal.Each meal begins with a complimentary fruit skewer that is better than most fruit salads.  Additionally, we ordered a pitcher of sangria to split, which included even more freshly prepared fruit in the glass.  For meals we tried the salmon Benedict, carrot cake pancakes, and steak with ham and sausage between the 3 of us.  To begin, the Benedict Hollandaise sauce and the carrot cake glaze were some of the richest sauces I've ever tasted.  Insanely delicious but a tough hang with the amount of spread and food involved.  Outside that, the breakfast potatoes were #1 on my favorite potatoes of all time.  Great seasoning and large chunks were a perfect side.  The eggs in both dishes were cooked as expected and popped perfectly.  To top off our already good meal, they offered gluten free options at no additional cost.  Throw in some fantastic baguette with the egg dish and this meal was absolutely incredible.Service is a little slow which leads to the lines but they let you sit and gab and drink without any hurry so you don't feel like you're forced out of the restaurant upon finishing your meal.  Just get in line and wait an hour...you won't be disappointed."

This restaurant is walkable from the market and had the longest and slowest moving lines! But we were so glad we waited and were patient!The food was phenomenal and so was the service! The menu choices are enormous for a brunch and there are mix and match of savory and sweet items too!We stuck to the basics and ordered eggs benedict and savory truffle french toast with mushrooms. We also got a strawberry and watermelon cocktail and a matcha vanilla milkshake. I guess everyone gets a fruit skewer to begin with and in another 5 minutes or so we had our drinks. Our drinks were really refreshing and delicious. The food also arrived quickly and I cannot fully justify how good the Benedict were in writing! It was the perfect poach accompanied by super delish hollandaise sauce! And the side of roasted potatoes were to die for!! My husband also loved his french toast!Our server was super nice and I totally would come here again!"

We asked if we can order only one smoked salmon Benedict eggs to share. The staff was really nice and told us they can help to separate the food into two parts and both of us can have fruit and fries by adding only 2$. We certainly say YES. When the food coming into our table, we felt so   satisfied because it looked so gooood!!The hollandaise sauce was very creamy, the egg was boiled perfectly, fruits were sweet and fresh, fries were not greasy.

/user_details?userid=CFAt6ZkKuBoTHGy1oBZJKQ,Alena Daniela K.,"Prague, Czech Republic",5 star rating,"Indeed, there is a heaven in this world. I had wanted to visit the place a loong loong time and recently I did. I was mad at myself for not trying it out sooner. If you walk down the street it is practically a hidden gem, not shouting out loud: ""Hi theeere, here we aaare!"" Which I liked. The place serves mostly breakfast meals but it is not a rule as there are things like hamburgers as well. But since I visited the place I have to say the word ""breakfast"" has a totally new meaning for me. I ordered pancakes with nutella, bananas, coconut sauce with a sprinkle of rum. I have to tell you (and I swear) that I have never ever had a better breakfast and a pancake before in my entire life!But that was before I tried the omelette with a ham, champignons, red onion and pepper (I believe so) my boyfriend ordered. My oh my, never ever have I had such a piece of paradise in my mouth before. Not even the pancakes. We also ordered home made squeezed pineapple juice which was amazing and the watermelon water was a blast as well. All that for an amazing price since the portions were so huge we had to take out the rest. So basically I had the pancakes for lunch that day, a dinner later and a breakfast the next day. All that for $38 for both of us. And the staff was so nice we left them the biggest tip we have ever left so far - $15. And I still thought it was not enough because they work hard like hell to accommodate all your taste buds and breakfast eating habits.  The only downside of the place is that they do not have an english version of the menu. Google translator - God bless you! Even so I am giving the place 5*/5*. And believe me, if I could, I would give the place 6* out of those 5*. Have not had a better dining experience in a very loong time."

You even get a small plate of fruit before your breakfast arrives.The portions are VERY generous. I ordered the Beautiful Truffle and my plate was overflowing. It was delicious.

/user_details?userid=ZqsPhFWH41lG0JaaVOC-4Q,Jeff K.,"Baltimore, MD",5 star rating,"5 stars for killer food, amazing ambiance, and a bathroom that is an experience on its own. I went here after being recommended by a friend, and seeing the great yelp rating. I knew it was a ""must visit"". By no means did L'Avenue disappoint. I usually do not care for service, unless it is bad, and the great service here really put me at ease (staff speaks both French and English). Ambiance was great, they play nice jazz music during brunch and it helps with the overall enjoyment. Like I said...the bathroom is amazing and made it worth the trip. Make sure you use it. All of these non-food items would give this establishment a 3.5-4 star rating. Regarding food. The eggs Benedict seemed to be what everyone was eating. So I do not doubt they are great, but I was specifically told by a friend to ""not be swayed by the eggs Benedict, get the pommes caramelisé"".  I will admit, I was almost swayed... Thank goodness I wasn't. The pommes caramelisé with French toast may have been the best breakfast I have ever had (TOP5DOA). The French toast was airy, and the cheddar and bacon versus the caramel taste was to die for. Please don't be swayed... This meal was the hook line and sinker on the 5 star. 5 stars for a ""must come back"" restaurant."

I, of course, went to yelp to read some reviews and try to get us to go to a nice breakfast place. I saw this was highly recommended and we decided to try it. There is a bit of a wait, but it's worth it. Typically you wait a little longer depending on how big the party is. For a table of two, it was about 20 minutes. The amount of food was huge and everything was delicious. My boyfriend ordered chai latte and orange juice, both were delicious and the orange juice was freshly squeezed. I ordered a cappuccino (which was also delicious). They also gave us waters that tasted of watermelon. It was really refreshing. Our waitress was friendly and made sure we were happy with our order.

/user_details?userid=HWLr60IBXAy9HD23W3Xmfg,Lesley L.,"Willowdale, Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Je suis triste -  I wish L'Avenue was in Toronto.  We came here at around 10:30am, arriving to a lineup of roughly 8-10 people ahead of us, which moved relatively quickly (maybe a 15 minute wait, at max?).  Appreciated that despite the short wait, there's a cooler with ice water available at the front of the line for any overheated guests waiting for a table. Which takes me to the next point: seemingly superfluous details are far from lost.  Himalayan pink salt sits in the table salt shakers instead of regular ol' stinky salt.  Water inside comes from a huge, clear plastic cube dispenser, with whole rounds of watermelon floating inside to flavour the water.  Cafe latte glacee, which I thought would simply be caffe latte poured over ice, actually came in a large glass and blended, like an iced capp but much less sweet. A free skewer of fresh fruit will serve as your appetizer, regardless of whatever dish you might've ordered. My pick for the day was the eggs Benedict ""Tout L'Monde a Poele"": Two huge mounds of sautéed mushrooms, bacon on English muffins topped with two poached eggs. Sadly, a couple of our eggs were overcooked. The hubs had the eggs Benedict with the truffle...before I ate the tiny bit of black truffle shavings on top, because I'm a monster like that.  The hollandaise, while I have to admit wasn't the best I've had, was also not the worst - it actually tasted of butter. Both bennys were delicious. My tips:- Menus are in French, I'm not sure whether or not they have English menus available.  If this puts you off, I suggest reading their menu online so you can Google in advance. - If French is not your forte, when greeted by waitstaff, make sure you reply in English.  If you answer in French, be prepared to speak French the rest of the time you're there. - Come early-ish! Pretty much anything past 11 and you're in line for the long haul. Portions are large, so warm up your belly before you come here.  Bon appetit!"

I wasn't sure about the ham till our waiter recommended it over the sausage without hesitation. I am glad that I went with it since it wasn't what I was expecting! More like pulled pork than a slice of a ham. Also, I am from Vermont so I thought I knew maple syrup pretty well.

We got in line just in time before it got too crazy (before 10am). The menu was in french only, so I brushed up on some of my high school french to make out what was on the menu. The decor in the restaurant was unique. They gave us a fruit ""appetizer"" which resembled a fruit kabob. It was good. We got one of their mixed fruity drinks/smoothie, which tasted good but nothing memorable. I liked that their water was watermelon infused, it tasted refreshing. *Disclaimer* I think I'm a little spoiled since there are many fantastic brunch places in Philly. I had a very tasty french toast topped with fresh fruit! One of us got the cappuccino which was rich and came with a small piece of chocolate. We ordered  several savory brunch dishes which was good but again nothing too memorable. The service was just okay. I think one of the most memorable things was strangely their blue lit creepy bathroom. We saw several people go in at once to take pictures. It was unique... but again slightly creepy.

/user_details?userid=DHf9CQk0YUZoQ8Mhsuu3xg,Lindsay M.,"La Mesa, CA",5 star rating,"Ahhhhhhmazing!! Is all I can say. Best salmon egg benedict I've ever had. They give you fruit to start with, which was very lovely and delicious! Great way to start the day. My friend and I were visiting Montréal from Massachusetts and we stumbled upon this place on Yelp. Saw the reviews and needed to go! Be aware that you will most likely wait in a line, but if you're with one or two people you can get in sooner. The menu is in all French (had to google translate some stuff) but the waitress helped us find what we wanted. My friend got the Idaho omelette and she said it was the most intricate omelette she ever had haha so many flavors and ingredients!! I got the salmon benedict and almost died. Literally. It was so good!! The hash browns are home made, too and they put some seasoning in it that will make you want more. This place is the spot for breakfast/brunch!!"
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Every time I've been here, L'Avenue has never failed to make me feel warm and satisfied on the inside. Although Montréal is a brunch mecca of sorts, what separates L'Avenue from other brunch places that emphasize quantity and quality is the sheer variety of menu offerings that they have. How they manage to make everything stay fresh and taste good with that many ingredients on hand is beyond me, but it works! I almost always opt for their Eggs Benedict dishes, and this time I ordered the Monsieur Séguin II - an Eggs Benedict with goat cheese, spinach, and sautéed mushrooms. In my opinion, I think Eggs Benedict is fascinating because it never looks like much food at first glance, but that's because the ingredients are all piled on top and really makes your palate become exposed to a variety of flavors in one bite. The gooey egg yolk mixed with the creamy chevre and the meaty mushrooms was a perfect combination, and the spinach carried a sense of lightness that balanced out the umami of the other components. The breakfast potatoes, which weren't overlooked by any means, was the icing on the cake. By the time I finished, I was so stuffed that I forgot about my neglected blueberry and basil mimosa, which was tasty in its own right. L'Avenue puts a lot of champagne in their mimosas, and for me, the more booze, the better! Thankfully, it didn't overpower the sweetness of the blueberry and the freshness of the basil.Of course, no visit to this place is complete without a stop in their bathrooms. Although I didn't go this time, I'm guilty of taking mirror selfies surrounded by the cool and quirky mismatched neon colors. It's a rite of passage in Montréal, no?"

The wait time was the only ridiculous part of the experience to be honest, but I had read reviews before visiting so I was expecting a wait time of around 20mins. The food however was pretty great and presentation was lovely. I had a server named Alex and he honestly was amazing. Very fast service (especially considering how busy it was), and I saw him also bussing tables whenever he had an extra second. Many servers would take that little minute they have to check their phone but he was very hard working, so major props to him. It's because of servers like him, it makes the experience so great!Overall, I would say the restaurant should think of ways to keep the restaurant flowing faster so people aren't waiting an hour outside for food."

The entire restaurant gave off a very chill and ambient vibe, I loved it. The portions were HUGE but our party of 4 wolfed down everything! I ordered eggs Benedict and one of my friends ordered the steak eggs Benedict. Omg those were the best egg Benedict's I've ever had, no joke. They were delicious!

/user_details?userid=RpG_9KuJKrvwymua9L8VuQ,Francois M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,The pancake with caramelized apples and bacon was way too sweet and too greasy and this is definitely not worth 20$. I think they try to overdo it on this one and they imagine a plate with cheap ingredient to make money. I took the steak and egg the steak was way to cook. I like my potatoes crispy. Infortunately what they did there it's that they broil them in water and they fried them a little. The potatoes tasted water. You have to put them in an oven and the way you keep your potatoes is not right. Hollandaise sauce was not so good. I've been going to this restaurant since 15 years and I think the quality went down a bit for the price. It's cool they leave you the can of maple syrup on the table and you have pink salt from Himalaya but I rather have quality in the main dish that all this extra.

The place is very cramped, Scooting into my seat i almost knocked over water of table next to me (big butt say wut). Anyways, menu was pretty decent, they are known for Benedict's. Girlfriend ordered the duck Benedict, unfortunately she was left very displeased. There was practically no duck, it consisted of 85% sauteed onions. By the time she was done,(only ate one portion, picked through the other) her plate was full of onions. I ordered the smoked meat Benedict. It was ok for the first few bites, but it just seemed to get saltier and saltier, i couldn't finish my second second either. Best part of the experience was the bathroom and the potatoes.

Eventually, someone came to help us at which point we had to wait an additional almost 5 minutes for them to ""prepare a table"" despite there being multiple fully set tables for 2 in the restaurant. Finally we were seated and received menus. My friend is vegan, so after she looked over the menu she realized there is very little she could order, so we got up and left. On our way out NO ONE stopped to ask us ""is everything okay"" or ""have a nice day"", which was honestly the cherry on top for the bad service we had already received."

The meal was flavourful without being in your face salty, although admittedly I did order a French toast benny which leaned towards the greasy side. During this meal, I had the fortune or misfortune (depending on how you view it) of finding a hair in my food. The waiter was notified and my lunch was given to me on the house no questions asked.

The coconut coffee was great and a great lactose free alternative. I had the indecisive but got a little too adventurous with the pork cruto which was a cold wierd meat. The French toast was the best I've ever had. It was this magical thick cut toast that had the French toast exterior but a nice fluffy interior. It was slathered in Nutella and strawberries and whipped creme. Definitely recommend this place as the go to brunch in Montreal.

Boyfriend got French toast with his poached eggs and said it was the best he's ever had. Service was great. Tables are a little close but not awful. Bathrooms are a trip haha! Definitely the weirdest bathrooms I have ever been in. My plate was great but there were A LOT of mushrooms and no sauce. I would have rather had the eggs over easy so they gooey yolk made a sauce, or just more of a sauce in general. Without it, my plate was a little dry. And too many mushrooms. But the flavors were great! My boyfriend loved his dish. Sweet and savory eggs Benedict. Also, GET THE NUTELLA COFFEE. Amazing. I recommend this place! Get there early and go during a weekday because I heard the lines can get really long. We didn't wait when we went (around 10/11 on a Monday), but there were people waiting when we left."

I ordered the pancakes with strawberries, blueberries, bananas and dulce de leche whip cream. Servings are HUGE! My hubby orders the eggs Benedict with smoked meat and he devoured it!

There was an appetizer of a fruit skewer, and I had the little bit of everything meal. (I can't seem to remember what it was called) Also, make sure to check out the bathroom before you go!The reason I give it four stars and not five is because we waited for an hour and a half on line. Granted, we were a group of 7- but no one could give us an accurate wait time. Finally, after an hour and half in we decided it would be smarter to spilt into two groups. Secondly, our waiter was very overwhelmed with the amount of people in the restaurant, so much so that he forget two of our drinks. (We were three people)However, I would definitely eat here again- just remember they get super crowded super fast."

And 1 of us got the regular eggs benedict which also tasted good! They also gave us complimentary fruits on a kebab. We also got 2 exotic drinks: ORANGE, FRAMBOISES ET BLEUETS and MANGUE, ANANAS ET LITCHI - both were sweet and tasty. this staff was very attentive, came back to ask if we liked the food but we were still taking pictures of the food, haha!

I had the Benedict - smoked meat eggs benedict and it was absolutely amazing. Probably the best eggs benedict I've ever had. The potatos were alright, I wish they were a little bit crispier. The portions are pretty generous and come with a skewer of unpeeled fruit (I am the type to struggle with this so it made me a bit sad).The cafe mocha was on the sweet side, but thats exactly how I like it. Overall, it's a really great place for brunch."

I will literally wake up hungover at 7am on a Saturday morning so I can avoid the long lines that start around 9am. And I will ignore the fact that I have to google translate half the menu each time I go because it's in French. The food makes it all worth it.I mean, I don't even like eggs benedict! But I do here. Fruit for breakfast? Way too cool for me. But sure, I'll have a fruit kebab at L'Avenue. Coffees? Great. Mimosas? Yes! All different kinds of fruit drink combinations? Check. Omelettes? Large and delish. Their side roasted potatoes are insane. Among my favorite foods in the world. Am I gushing? Yeah I am and you will be too when you try them. I can't say enough good things about this place. Who do I speak to about opening up one of these joints in NY?"

First off, they taste fresh and delicious and secondly they're HUGE. I have a hard time finishing them.The only thing that sucks about this place is the line-up. I wish they would expand and add more tables given they are so popular. The wait on the weekend is minimum 30 minutes."

The food is good but definitely not better than some more local gems, the price is much higher than other more traditional places. i would suggest you to skip the line and try another place."

/user_details?userid=zTHK_nlgh8Bz_AXPksPKng,Will R.,"Minneapolis, MN",5 star rating,"Absurdly good. Absurdly good. The sort of meal and food that makes you wish you had 3-4 stomachs, so that you could just eat everything on the menu.      On a recent trip here with my family we ate an epic multi course breakfast-brunch. I don't use the word epic lightly. There is the starter course, a fresh fruit spread for each person, with a bevy of different fruit selections. So fresh and so good, yet there is snow pouring down outside the window, surreal yes, but also delicious.      For our mains my mother and I opted for savory, I had a duck confit benedict. It was as amazing as it sounds. In fact, I would say it's the best benedict I've ever eaten. It was a sublime version of the dish. My mom had a simple breakfast with eggs, bacon, and a salad. But, all were excellent, and cooked/prepared perfectly. My brother's order was epic. He ordered both the carrot cake pancakes and the french toast. Both dishes again, were amazing. I usually don't go in for sweet breakfast, but these two dishes were perfect, not too sweet with just the right amount of syrup and whipped cream atop them.     Beyond the food there are the drinks- fresh juices and cocktails abound. Want an Irish coffee? They'll make you one better with a dose of maple in it. Want some beer? How about a 2 for 1 deal, yeah that's right I had two IPA's here for about $7. Can't get that sort of deal anywhere stateside, and at brunch no less.      And finally the service. This place was slammed the day we came, with a line down the block. But, you'd never know from how cool and collected the waitstaff are. Our server was near telepathic in regards to our table, not to mention that she was also incredibly beautiful. But it wasn't just her, everyone working here treated you as a special guest. It was just a great atmosphere to dine in, especially compared to brunch hotspots in places like NYC and PDX.      If you want amazing food, great service, all for a good price you must stop by here at L'Avenue. Good things will await you for sure!!!!"

Excessively large portions of food that you can't finish in a single sitting make it a great brunch spot after a long night out.

The place gets busy very quickly, so I recommend arriving early, or get reservations. When you are seated you are given a complementary fruit kabob, and the water was fused with watermelon. I had a green tea matcha latte, which was amazing, and for my main dish I had the chicken and waffles. The sauce is a general tao sauce, which gave the dish a different flavor. If your ever in the plateau area, defenatly give L'avenue a try, best to walk up the street and stroll up the mountian."

We waited 45 minutes to be seated which we are used to from all the brunch spots in Melbourne but after we were done with the meal and asked ourselves ""was it worth the wait"" ... no it wasn't.The food was above average for sure comparative to the very very weak brunch scene in Canada. But there was nothing in the menu that was note worthy, just the standard brunch variety, but done a little better; add a few ""unique ingredients"" and call it a menu. Their benedict tasted good but quickly became dull and repetitive with each subsequent bite. The coffee was good but once again not something worth waiting for. Overall I'd say this restaurant doesn't give the wow factor a 45minute wait commands but if the wait isn't an issue this place is still a great place for a regular brunch meal!"

It's a pretty expensive breakfast (our meal was about $80 for four), but they are using very good ingredients, and the portions are hhhuge. Everyone were super happy with what they got, and only my dad and I were able to overcome the entire plate. The coffee is good, and they also make nice fruit juices and shakes.

/user_details?userid=S_wlsi3NYVYK-SGk-Iq72w,Jacklyn N.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I cannot say enough amazing things about the classic Eggs Benny, by far the best Eggs Benedict I have ever had. Classic Eggs Benedict usually comes with typical processed cold-cut ham. However at L'Avenue they have a beautiful, succulent slow cooked, glazed shredded ham that they put on the Eggs Benny, which makes it out of this word yummy. I opted for the gluten free option (which offers either gluten free bread of Eggs Benny on portabello mushrooms), the gluten free bread was quite yummy and did not take away from the taste factor of the eggs benny. I also had an americano style coffee, which was also exceptionally good. Overall I would definitely return to this place, but would caution fellow yelpers about the potentially long line. I went around 9:30am on a Saturday and the place already had a huge line up outside, however it is well worth the wait!"

Next we split the Dejeuner Cabane a Sucre - A safe bet for a filling breakfast with both savoury and sweet components. Another absolutely to-die-for brunch at L'Avenue is in the books.

We visited this restaurant for brunch and had to wait in line in -20c weather for 45 mins haha. Believe there was only one table large enough to handle a group which was already taken so we were seated separately and we were ok with that. Turned out the wait was well worth it. The menu was simply awesome with wholesome organic and non GMO ingredients combined in the usual classic favourite brunch dishes and fresh juices. Everyone starts with a skewer of fresh fruit which was a nice touch. The staff were smiling and joking in spite of the crowds and the perennial running around from one table to the other. Service was good. The washroom was interesting due the display of loud neon in darkness inside so definitely pay a visit :) Rest of the decor was very tastefully done. We are definitely coming back on our next visit to Montreal.
/user_details?userid=985_A0PdZmfbVB1wdlHPzA,Vanessa Z.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"We got here at 1:30pm on a Friday. There was a line but it was not long; we only waited for about 15 minutes to get in. 1. Interior: Quirky and interesting decor, very packed, hard to get out of our seats because the tiny tables were way too close to each other. The washrooms were actually a must-see. Too bad i did not bring my phone when i used the washroom. I wish i actually took pictures of it hahaha. Loved the whole retro theme.2. Food: A plate of fruit screwer came first. We waited for 20 min to get our food (all waiters and waitresses were busy) but thankfully we weren't too hungry. I got À la bretonne egg benny and my mom ordered La biquette omelet. We were both big fans of the food as it was cooked perfectly. 2 things I really need to point out here: - THEIR POTATOES WERE AMAZING. you would not need any extra dipping sauce on the side as they are already well seasoned with many herbs that i cannot name. POTATOES POTATOES POTATOES - THEIR PORTIONS WERE HUGE. I could only finish half of my plate and my mom tried really hard to work through 3/4 of her omelet. we ended up having the leftover with some poutine for dinner.3. Service: My sketchy french would only embarrass myself so the kind waiter served us in English. I forgot his name but he was really friendly and professional (and he wore a bow tie!!). It was a bit difficult to get noticed by the waiters and waitresses as there were just way too many people dining at the time but they tried their best to speed up everything so i had no complaints."

I've had most of them and my favorite is the one with lardons and mushrooms. Can't remember the name. The staff is also very friendly. I don't know if it is common practice, but they comped my friends meal for her birthday. I recommend this place to anyone from singles to families. If you get there when they open there's no line. But if they've been open for a half hour or so you'll likely find a line. Even in the dead of winter. But that says something about how good it is."

On weekends you can expect to wait at least 30 minutes, or even an hour! I'm not kidding!!!So, if you love food, and you are willing to wait, this place is the best option, if you don't care that much, well, there's other places around the area.If you are visiting Montreal, I recommend it definitely, but go earlier than 10 so you don't wait that long :)"

I liked this place so much that I ate there twice when visiting Montreal. The 45 minute wait in line is worth it! Everything about this place is awesome. First of all the decor amazing! There's all types of cool art to look at. They also have a really cool concept for the menu. It's a game show menu, very creative! The star of the decor is the glow in the dark bathroom. Talk about DOPENESS at its finest! I would've stayed in the bathroom for hours if it didn't look weird lol. Now for the food and drinks. Everyone gets a fruit skewer to start. They have this delicious Nutella coffee, that comes with a piece of dark chocolate. They also have smoothies, exotic juices, and different flavored mimosas. All the drinks tasted super fresh. This place is known for its egg Benedict dishes. I'm not a huge fan of egg Benedict but the steak and mushrooms one was delicious! I was very pleased with it. My friend ordered the ""Mac and cheese"" pancake and it was mouth watering good. It tasted like delicious baked macaroni and cheese in a pancake. I'm very picky about my Mac and cheese, and trust me when I tell you that you must try this if you're a Mac and cheese lover. I'm actually  thinking about it now as I'm writing this review :-). The best thing about all of this is the prices were super cheap. This place would be at least $50 if it was in NYC. You get so much bang for your buck here. Do yourself a favor and add this to your to do list if you're in Montreal."

My 4 friends and I waited in line for 2 hours on a Saturday for brunch, so our expectations were extremely high. Let me tell you that it's really as good as everyone says. The inside of the restaurant has a really cool and hip vibe to it. As weird as it is to talk about on Yelp, their bathroom is an experience of its own.I started off with their smoothie with the mango and lychee. Wow, this itself was a game changer. It was so good and fresh, but it was not too sweet. The cup itself is huge, so it would be a good size to share with someone. For my entree, I ordered their combo plate that comes with eggs, pancakes, and 2 sides. For my sides I had the potatoes and ham. I'm not even a big fan of ham, but this was incredible. The potatoes were definitely the best potatoes I've ever had. For the pancakes, I had the chocolate pretzel pancakes. They were perfectly fluffy and topped with crunchy bits of pretzels and drizzled with chocolate. It surprisingly wasn't sickeningly sick or rich due to the crunchy/salty pretzels. Everything was so flavorful and cooked to perfection.My friends and I all agreed that this was one of the best brunches we've ever had, if not the best brunch ever. The service was also great. They are pretty quick with the food and attentive to your requests. This is a must-do in Montreal!"

The menu is vast and offers an insane variety of choice for everyone's taste from brunch to dinner choices.I took what I usually take , ""Bon Ben moi jprend toute"" , it was very good , definitely a huge meal I'm actually surprise I finished it this time. My bread was a little bit hard , and I couldn't really appreciate it's taste with the creton. However, pretty much everything else was the perfection . My scrambled eggs was delicious, I had a large portion of delightful sausages and bacon. The mashed potatoes are really good, I will admit that.

I follow a strict diet (keto) and need to eat clean when I travel so that I'm not off the rails when returning home and getting back into my normal workout routine.   I compensate that by eating clean while on the road and walking as much as possible instead of taking taxis or subway.  As for this restaurant, there is a generous breakfast menu and that's what this place specializes in as their hours of operation are 8am - 4pm.  I ordered a Gym Dude omelette which included cheese, grass fed chicken, mushrooms, etc and a heaping serving of mixed salad in place of breakfast potatoes. Wow!!!  A fruit skewer came along with this meal as well, before the omelette was served.The serving size was generous and the meal was absolutely delicious.  This is a place to come with someone instead of alone, There are only tables and booths, no bar stools at the kitchen or anything.But make no mistake about it, if you're looking to have an excellent and high-quality breakfast meal in Montreal, this place should be at the top of your list.

We soon learned why....we ordered the french toast and one omelette dish with 2 smoothies and grapefruit juice. The portions seem small through pictures but they are HUGE. The smoothie alone is a meal. I've never come across a french toast I couldn't finish.....no matter how much I ate, the portions didn't seem to decrease. L'Avenue defeated us.

Breakfast.  I used Yelp to locate the best place for a birthday brunch and L'Avenue was the number one hit.  Every review recommends an EARLY arrival on the weekends, and I can confirm that arriving before 10am on a Saturday is the best route for fast seating (ask to be in the back away from the door/draft!).  Quirky hipster ambiance (with suspended bicycles and massive maple syrup canisters) will make you feel like you're one of the cool kids.  Professional nom-worthy menu (with benedicts and waffles and omelets) will make you feel like one of the fat kids (in a good way).Order up an adult milkshake (with boooooooooooze) then tuck in and get ready to let your pants out.  The homefries: perfectly seasoned.  The waffle with nutella: what dreams are made of.  The omelet: large enough to feed a small family.  It's a large menu with something for everyone and prices that won't break the bank.Whatever you do......go to the bathroom.  The coolest pee experience you'll ever have (unless you've used those one-way-mirror public potties....in which case this will be the SECOND best pee experience!).  No more hints.....just enjoy...."

Regardless on what time you get to the restaurant, you're guaranteed to wait for a table. You're looking at a wait time of anywhere between twenty to forty minutes, typically. On a Sunday at around noon, however, you're looking at almost two hours. I had actually considered getting out of line and getting something else but after an hour of waiting, I was pretty dedicated. When we finally got in, the service was quick, but not rushed. The staff was as attentive as they possibly could of been given the sheer amount of people in the restaurant. We both ordered the Sucré Salé. It arrived and it was absolutely amazing. The egg was poached exactly how I'd asked them, the French toast was perfect and the hollandaise sauce was sublime. The potatoes were so good. And they weren't greasy like your average breakfast potato. Overall, I'm impressed with the restaurant. A good breakfast in a really trendy restaurant."

I started off with their adorable tropical smoothies. I got the lychee, mango, pineapple and it was huge and topped off with a cocktail umbrella. Super yummy and fresh! This place is known for their eggs benny and I can tell why. I'm not a fan of runny eggs but my boyfriend cut me a part a piece of the caramelized pork, egg, and hollandaise sauce and I heard angels sing when I took a bite. I opted to get the ""indecisive"" brunch with salted pretzel dulce de leche pancakes, scrambled eggs, wheat toast, bacon, sausage, and potatoes. Everything was pretty good but the eggs Benny really took the cake. I can tell people come here for the ambience as well. The place is super funky with their watermelon water.

Let's get shitfaced tonight after such an amazing breakfast on Christmas eve. This is, honestly, the best restaurant I've ever been to. All those positive references are so right. We arrived at 1pm for breakfast, we were 2 people and waited not even 5 minuted until we got seated in an amazing place in the back of the restaurant. I was totally overhelmed of how awesome this place is, there were many people in there, the food looks nice, and so does it taste. And the portions are huge, and not overpriced. The toilet is the most fancy one i've ever seen, you have to move your ass in there or you will regret it. If you can't, take a coffee and get some free refills first. I have no idea how my meal was called, the card is only in French, but a surprise is a good thing sometimes ;) and I was not disappointed - that thing was like a whole family dinner on a cut in half whole bread - and the Mokka was really good as well. $22 before tip for mokka and that complete breakfast. Fruits with real maple sirup as a free appetizer makes everything perfect. Just, go in there, you have to! Only the waiter didn't show up often, but he's excused as there were so many people. And all the other waiters looked friendly and were really busy as well, so yeah. Go there."

However, at one point during our wait the hostess pulled a group of two (I'm assuming her close friends by the way they greeted each other) from the back of the line and seated them first; I was quite disgruntled considering there were over ten people (and multiple groups of two) in front of them in line.I loved the music they were playing - songs from the late 90s and early 00s. The wall decorations and the menu spoke to the overall charm of the place. The servers were friendly, upbeat, and contributed to a very welcoming atmosphere. Each patron gets a fruit skewer to munch on while they're waiting for their order to arrive which was very nice. I ordered the breakfast poutine: potatoes, sausages, veggies, and cheese curds covered with spicy hollandaise sauce and a poached egg. It was delicious - the first few bites at least. There was a layer of oil that had pooled at the bottom of the dish where the potatoes were: it diluted the sauce and made the dish rather unappetizing after a bit. The large portion of food meant I packed my leftovers in a doggie bag while taking care to leave the oil behind - food was still yummy after being in the fridge for a bit. Overall I enjoyed my experience because of the ambience of the place. Not sure if I'd be back for the yummy albeit oily food."

It was very good. My only complaint would be that they didn't put enough potatoes in the breakfast poutine. Be aware that the potatoes are not fries... they are thin potato wedges. My date had the sweet-salty eggs benedict. I'm not usually a fan of sweet and salty things but it was good!! It consisted of two poached eggs on French toast which was crunchy because it was covered with panko. They also put some maple syrup for the sweetness. Then on top of the French toast was a piece of black forest ham, gruyere cheese and Hollandaise sauce. The water is infused with watermelon and it tastes so good and fresh. The décor is so cool... especially the bathroom!! So go check it out!!"

I've been here multiple times and it remains a favorite brunch spot for me.The line is almost always guaranteed to be huge on weekends and stat days. Big groups can wait up to 45 minutes. The menu has changed over the years but the classics remain on there. A collection of morning smoothies to start and the best steak and eggs Benedict! Everyone who works there is very nice and service is great.

Their portions are HUGE and their potatoes are heavenly  seasoned (a little seasoning goes a long way) and  I have yet to try a benedict that I didn't like. If you re fan of sweet salty food like me, I heavily suggest the sweet and salty with maple syrup french toast benedict! Their mushroom and lard benedict is amazing as well as their crab cake one! I suggest asking for the hollandaise on the side seeing that the benedicts are quite heavy and it can get hard to eat after a while. PROS: Huge portions, great potatoes, great benedicts, cute atmosphereCONS: Huge waiting times (expect 2hr wait during prime time)"

Walked right in on a Wednesday around 10:30, had our choice of seating. Was greeted by many smiles & asked menu language preference, a kind nod to non-Francophone speakers. Watermelon infused water & regular coffees arrived promptly as did a fruit brochette with ripe sweet fruit. Sister ordered eggs Benny with pulled pork, I had sale/sucre Benny. Both perfectly poached eggs, runny yolks. Hers on an English muffin was ample pulled pork, tender sweet, great maple flavour, covered in decadent hollandaise. Mine was 2 panko coated French toast, melted cheese topped with Black Forest ham with 2 poached eggs, covered in same decadent hollandaise. Both plates had lots of potatoes but seriously we had no room, we were so full. They also leave a full can of maple syrup on the table. Our server was super friendly and we were so happy to have visited today."

But time has changed- the only reason i come here is because it's my weekday morning spot within 10min from home. When it comes to weekend though, i can name a restaurant that does just a little bit better than L'avenue for each dish I've tasted here: Wild mushroom truffle omelette: a similar dish on Le Pain Perdu's daily special (1min walk from L'avenue) does it better - less greasy & more tasty. Chicken Egg Benedict: It's good but even Allo Mon Coco, the chain that's all over Montreal right now, can achieve similar result & satisfaction.Duck Egg Benedict: Not closely as good as the one at Passe Compose or La Fabrique. Maybe the egg-related dishes are not their specialty? However, isn't it a all-day brunch restaurant? I have to admit that the service is good, price & quality ratio is great and the decoration is more funky than most of the others- especially the washroom - well worth a visit and pay attention to the clock!! :)"

My friends and I are all very picky eaters and usually do not walk away from a meal completely satisfied. This is one of the few times we did. Everything - from the complimentary fruit they served at the start, to the amazing smoothies, to the meals - was perfect. We waited 40 minutes to get in around 12:30pm Saturday and I'm not even complaining. We asked people ahead of us in line if they had been there before and whether we should wait or not. Every single person told us that it's worth the wait 100% and I'm so glad we did. Definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Montreal."

Compared to Régine Café and Passé Composé, l'Avenue is really average, and the price is pretty much the same. It's rare that I cannot finish a brunch plate because I always prepare myself for brunch with an empty stomach, and I didn't finish my dish at l'Avenue. Their fruit brochette was nice, but the actual brunch let me down. I think it is a bit overrated and the food didn't wow me. I find the interior decor quite cool but quite unfitting with the clientele, they have a lot of graffiti and neon on their walls, but most clients are coming in family. However this place is always packed, so make sure to go there during the week or you would have to wait forever to get a table."

To my surprise I got a free plate of fruits (cantaloupe, watermelon, etc) and the egg benedicts came with yummy potatoes. Both the dishes were absolutely delicious. They have watermelon flavored water, and feel free to check in the back for their water tank with large slices of watermelon in it. The ""grafitti"" walls and decorations are also a sight.

Also, I ordered a soy cappuccino which was very awesome! :)Another good part is that they have free wifi without any password. The service was mediocre though..

Now, there will be a line outside, and you'll have to deal with it...but, you probably won't wait more than 20 minutes or so. Inside, the wall is covered in fun graffiti and a motorcycle hanging from the ceiling (don't worry, it won't fall if you're sitting under it...hopefully). The music also makes the environment, the playlists are fun, with good energy.If you're an Eggs Benedict fan, this is the place for you, they have a wide variety of Benedicts to choose from. I figured they knew how to make a great crepe too, so, I went for the Whole Wheat Crepe with cinnamon baked apples and cottage cheese. Each dish is also served with their signature fresh fruit skewers. The crepe was delicious, light and had lots of flavor. The skewers are the perfect accompaniment as well, fresh and perfectly portioned. And of course, real Maple Syrup.Oh, and whether you need to use the bathroom or not, you have to go inside (yes, it's black lit). Best party bathroom. Ever."

After striking out at the must try to get in spot close by I checked the places I had bookmarked and this place was the closest and had no wait on a Friday night.The interior is striking to stay the least. I was dinning alone so didn't care and just wanted something to fuel up. The burger seemed like a decent option so I decided to go with the Kobe style beef version. I was asked how I would like it cooked and I asked for chef's choice (medium rare)The service was poor actually as the server had to be flagged to get things going. On to the burger looked hefty so will get you going I guess. Devoid of taste and barely spiced I would say one can do a lot better. Fries were nothing special either.

You know the place is legit when their sides are amazing, so of course the eggs benedict & french toast were off the wall. Flavorful and complex without being overwhelming, and the french toast was basically bread pudding.. which I love. I'll have dessert for breakfast any day (and I had half of it leftover for real dessert that night too).I don't know if this place caters to American tourists or what, but their portion sizes were GINORMOUS!

The menu is kitsch and fun, and the entire restaurant lives up to that aesthetic. We loved every minute and L'Avenue will be top of our list to visit next time we're in town."

But it was definitely worth the wait.The decor was very retro and quirky. And the washrooms... Well those graffiti in neon paint certainly were fascinating and bold, along with that clock screen. I had studied the foods from other reviewers and pictures and thought I knew what I wanted... Nope! Had such a hard time deciding since everything sounded amazing, especially the egg benedicts. Eventually I settled on the egg Benedict with portobello mushrooms, bacon and arugula. I thought the fruit skewers that came before the meal was lovely and helped cleanse my tastebuds (especially that grapefruit!) before the main attraction arrived. The eggs Benedict... Wow! I didn't know where to begin! I love how plenty of ingredients (portobello mushrooms, bacon and hollandaise sauce) were provided and piled on top of one another. I wish they had put more arugula instead of just a few tiny pieces that were barely visible or could be tasted. Other than that you can taste the flavour and how well everything works together. The potatoes were a little bland, which is easily remedied with salt and pepper or dipping it in the hollandaise sauce. But it wasn't all that interesting to say the least. The hollandaise sauce got a little heavily and was weighing me down a little when I was making my way through the second benedict. Still delicious though."

My friends finally had the time and we decided to go here for brunch. We saw the line and almost was giving up, but we actually only waited 15 min which isnt that bad for that line! Once we get in you first notice their decoration, and then the loud music. It's not the best place for people who are looking for a quiet brunch place, as it could feel like you are in a club. But the food is amazing! They serve you fruits once you sit which I think is everyone's wish: to have food right away!Also, my friends kept saying I should go to the restroom, cause ""its an experience"". I had no idea why they were saying that till I actually went. I won't spoil it, but just saying if you go there, go to the restroom as well..Would definetely recommend here, nice food, good for chilling with friends, and you get the ""restroom experience"""

Although they are known for their eggs Benedict i was feeling pancakes so I went with the strawberries and Nutella with homemade whip cream. It was so decadent and delicious. My husband went with the steak eggs Benedict and I now see why that's what they are known for!!! Their exotic juices are so fresh. Portions are pretty big so definitely consider sharing or not eating for a while after. Service was a bit slow but the staff was very nice. Make sure you get their early because the line gets very big very fast and we went on a Thursday.  Would definitely come here again!

Eats:- Steak and egg Benedict with garlic potatoes.....amazing. The special sauce with the poached egg added to the flavor of the angus steak. I would highly recommend it to the steak and Benedict lover. Side of potatoes and garlic was great to dip in whatever sauce was left- my wife had the Shakshuka which a middle Eastern inspired dish with sausage, peppers, poached eggs and sauce in the middle of a huge round warm bread. - both dishes came with a side of fresh fruit in a skewer Drinks:- Latte was really good served in a big cup- house water was good and refreshing. It's served from a large dispenser with several pieces of fresh cut watermelonLikes: - service is really good- house water is good- menu is huge with lots of unique things to choose from- prices are reasonable for the portion you get- atmosphere is cool and the bathroom even and a cool look to it - Great spot for breakfast Overall I don't have any complaints about l'avenue.

From all the rave reviews ut's obvious the food is good, the bathroom is cool, the decor is hip- but what really impressed me was the super friendly unpretentious service despite how crazy busy they were. The server took the time to explain the menu since it was all in french and we did not speak a lick of it. She was attentive throughout and seemed to really make sure we were enjoying ourselves.

We paid $35 tax included for that meal.   It's an enjoyable meal anyhow.  We will go back again."

Luckily, my food was so delicious that I can recall what I got and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. We waited a LONG time for a table - if you go here, prepare to wait. I was here in the summer (July) and the line stretched about three storefronts. The fresh lemonade they had for those waiting was a nice touch. Upon being seated, we were almost immediately given a skewer of fruit - again, a nice touch after waiting so long and being really hungry. The coffee was nothing to write home about, but the bloody was pretty good. I had the classic Benedict for breakfast and it was DIVINE. The ham was pulled and the hollandaise was perfect. It was served over thick toast. My date got the sweet-salty-crispy Benedict. On a plate drizzled with maple syrup, panko french toast with ham, Gruyere, poached eggs topped with hollandaise - he enjoyed it."

I'm serious.I tried the Eggs Benedict, which was good, however, I forgot to order it with ham and got a brisket type meat instead which I was less fond of.The second time I got a combo of eggs, ham, bagel, fruit skewer, and potatoes and fell in love. It's everything I've ever wanted in brunch.My boyfriend got the blueberry, banana, strawberry french toast both times and when I asked him what I should write he enthusiastically said, ""Best f***ing french toast I've ever had... twice.""The staff is super friendly and speak both French & English, and the place is very trendy.

As other reviewers have pointed out, you start with a skewer of fresh fruits, which is a nice touch. The portions are huge, so come hungry.  Also check out the washrooms.  You'll see why."
/user_details?userid=fT-D4Ayjv-aAyLQC8ErvYQ,Mari H.,"Oakland, CA",4 star rating,"We stopped by Monday afternoon for an extended weekend brunch and were not disappointed. I've never seen so many benedict's! It also seemed to not be the busiest, which probably made our experience so-much-better. There's not a lot of waiting area that wouldn't put you hovering over another table.I got the duck confit (coin coin benedict). The presentation was all you could ever want from your brunch. There were potatoes and a fruit skewer. My only complaint is that it was all a little under seasoned. Salting duck confit at the table might be viewed at as a cry for help.The bathrooms are one of a kind for sure. Black lights, wall mirror, graffiti, wild life nature programs playing on a flatscreen tv in the bathroom make for a memorable experience for sure. Though you may want to consider who you bring here for this reason. It's also a bit loud for 11am. Grandma might not appreciate. The menu is French only, but most items are so simple and universal that if you're foodie enough to be eating in this place, it should be fine.It does seem that it might be better to be a regular here... or if you're in a hurry, to get a cold sandwich. One or the other. The couple next to us got some sandwiches (equally as beautiful as our bennies) about 10 minutes before our order came.All things considered, I'd definitely put this on my breakfast list for the next time I return to Montreal."

However, what I enjoyed the most had nothing to do with it. You see, we were sitting at this booth which happened to be right in front of the washrooms that have kinda ambiguous bathroom signs, so you're never quite sure if you're going into the right bathroom. We spent an hour and a half looking at people trying to figure out what bathroom was which and hoping they got it right. People would stand there, stare at one door, stare at the other. Some people would just go back to their table, defeated. Some others would just eenie-meenie-miney-mo it and hope for the best. When I saw the line outside and then waited for like an hour, I was expecting good food, but this really blew my mind. Best brunch ever. This is what I call added value."

I came the first time with my daughter and after seeing the line outside I didn't think it a good idea to wait out in the cold with her. However, I dragged my husband the second time out in the cold just to see what the hype was about. We waited about 25-30 mins outside on a Saturday morning. I ordered the Breton eggs Benedict and my husband got an omelet. My favourite part of the meal was the potatoes and smoothie. Unfortunately everything else was underwhelming and I think it's mostly due to all the hype this place gets. The French toast was good but felt so heavy after a few bites. Overall the food is good, but not better than many other brunch places Montreal has to offer."

Between the drinks and the food, everyone at my table of four thoroughly enjoyed their meals, and the next time I'm back in Montreal, I'll definitely be hitting this place up again!

It is served in an iron skillet and is cooked to perfection. Most dishes I slowly become sick of and am happy not to finish, this dish i was sad to leave part on my plate. The smoked meat Benedict was good as well, smoked meat is not really my thing, but my G/F enjoyed it.The best surprise with brunch was the appetizer. Unbeknownst to us, each item ordered comes with a fruit skewer which includes a variety of fruit and is a great start to your meal!The line is pretty insane on weekends and most other days.

Bonus, everyone gets a fruit skewer!I will definitely be back to try another variety of eggs Benedict. You can sub the English muffins for portobello mushrooms!Great for those avoiding grains or gluten.I wish they would opt for free range, organic, eggs (even with the large amount traffic) instead of the omega 3."

This place can get quite busy but my friends and I managed to snag a table for three within seconds! (This was around 11 AM on a Thursday).The decor was very disco-esque and 80s. There were booths and tables and the restaurant was very narrow but has a lot of space at the back. The service was friendly but not attentive. They would check in on you once in a while but that's okay, I ain't too picky about that. I just have to make a comment on this but their washrooms are super cool! Glow in the dark lights made the whites of the washroom illuminate and glow. It felt like I was at a disco party. The toilet paper was also glowing which made me think that the toilet paper that I used was magical."

We once waited over an hour (as a group of 6) the day after New Years in below -10 degrees Celsius weather. That's how committed we are to this place. I usually order an omelette with special additions (spinach, bell peppers, ...) and it's no trouble.Since my first time, I have brought non-breakfast people, family friends, boyfriend's family, and they have all returned multiple times (without me which I find hurtful!)When a young cousin came to visit for Osheaga, I took her here. Her favorite band and main reason for attending Osheaga had posted a photo to Instagram from the bathroom of L'Avenue earlier that day. It was celebrity and Gen-approved."

Hot! The main wall is covered in graffiti, and you can find a funky motorcycle suspended from the ceiling. I refer to their 'facilities' as the 'disco bathrooms' but you can check them out for yourself to see why :)While we were waiting, the waiter brought over two fruit skewers, which we thought was a nice touch. The place was pretty packed so we welcomed the snack. I started with a smoothie (strawberries, raspberries, mint, basil) and it was delicious. Super fruity and served in a giant fish bowl glass, topped with (another) fruit skewer. So good!  They have a pretty extensive menu and I finally settled on La Biquette - an omelet stuffed with veggies and goat cheese, and accompanied by potatoes and yes,  another fruit skewer. My omelet was huge - way too big for one person and I felt that it was a bit of a waste to make such big omelets only to leave half of them on your plate (I know - who complains about a portion being too big, right? Me, that's who!). That said, I didn't realize that it was a 4-egg omelet until my friend pointed it out so next time, I'll ask for a 2-egg omelet and hopefully they will be able to accommodate. The omelet was well-stuffed with veggies and cheese but if you didn't grab some cheese with those veggies, it was a little lacking in flavor. The potatoes were very tasty.L'Avenue is a hot spot, so expect a line-up. We got there around 11:30 on a Saturday, and didn't have to wait too long for a table."

Just the right amount of savory and sweet.  The French toast was amazing, pure sugary bliss and all of the flavors blended just right.  The line is a pain, but the wait is worth it!"
/user_details?userid=izdAXYjPdwaztxuT6C7GvQ,Jane S.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,Hands down my favourite brunch place in Montreal. I love this restaurant for the creativity they've infused into the simple breakfast foods. I had a french toast egg's benedict and the sweet salty combination was to die for! I would come back in a heartbeat if they could figure out a way to expand- more seating or an outdoor portion would be amazing. This place often has a HUGE line on the weekend (min 1 hour wait) so I would go on a weekday where it's a bit more comfortable. I went on a Tuesday morning and it was still a poppin' place for brunch. What I love about Montreal is you can get a good brunch any day of the week. Party hard play hard right?

Consider that my view of this place isn't tempered by the hour-long wait some of you might endure if you attempt a walk-in at peak hours.This place is totally packed, and they'll cram you in like sardines to make full use of their space. The steak and eggs benedict are phenomenal, though service is overworked, and therefore a bit spotty. We kept getting lucky, but I couldn't help but notice the couple that came before us didn't get their food until after we were done with ours.Seems like this place is in dire need of an expansion to a larger space, though maybe I'm missing the point of a popular brunch spot. Maybe to some people it's only worth it for the exclusivity."

I agree with other reviews - this place is the best place to go for brunch in the WORLD, not just Montreal. It would be rather difficult to top my experience here. L'avenue can probably persuade you to move to Montreal. My brunch visit hit the spot and was so good I still remember my first bite of the Monte Cristo, I'd probably drive six hours just to eat here. I'm so glad I did my research before visiting this city, otherwise I wouldn't have lined up to try out L'Avenue. The line-up could be discouraging to some, but it's worth the wait! Your stomach will thank you after! The Monte Cristo is two pieces of French toast (crispy on the edges) that weren't too eggy nor soggy on the inside, sandwiching Swiss cheese and ham. Then this is drizzled in maple syrup, and comes with a side of home fries or salad. This was the best I've tasted ANYWHERE. Portions are also enormous for the price! Service is also fantastic! We didn't speak any French, and the servers were equally as nice to us, explaining in detail what was in the menu. I'm already planning my next Montreal trip, and this time I hope to have brunch here more than once! I still gotta try their eggs benedict, omeletes, chorizio sausage... *drooling*  I'm their #1 Fan!"

As far as I could tell (and between the four staff I interacted with) every employee was bilingual. We went on the Monday after Osheaga and waited for approximately 50 minutes, then another 30 or so for our food. I truly hate waiting, but this was worth the wait. The food was divine. My boyfriend and I both had the Steak and Eggs Benedict, absolutely to die for, and one of, if not, the best Benny's I've ever had. I saved the leftover potatoes, mushrooms, steak and hollandaise and made an incredible hash. Bonus: the coffee is only $1.48. Tried and true: when you're good at one thing, stick with it, perfect it, and do only that. L'avenue is the *best* at breakfast, and completely worth five stars.

/user_details?userid=U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,Michael U.,"Las Vegas, NV",2 star rating,"For our final breakfast - and perhaps the biggest curveball of the trip to Montreal - we settled on L'Avenue even though I'd heard very mixed things; some claiming that its only appeal was that locals found it to be kitschy and ""American"" while others claimed it was worth the often interminable waits, lousy service, and French-only menus as the restaurant served the best breakfasts in town.  No stranger to early arrivals for great food but not particularly sold on the Eggs Benny-centric menu (apparently not as ubiquitous in Montreal as in the United States) we waxed and waned on L'Avenue until the last minute and in the end, after a very late night at APdC we decided ""why not?"" and arrived thirty minutes after they opened the doors.A hip restaurant - long and narrow with reclaimed wood and spray-painted exposed brick plus vinyl, motorcycles, and oddly positioned manikins the dominant features aside from a long bar and partially open kitchen - our arrival at L'Avenue would be met by a largely open dining room with perhaps only three tables already seated and greeted at the door by a young woman who's English was only slightly worse than my French we were led quickly to a table near the front where Vinyl-album style menus (French only) were provided and drink orders were placed - deux café et une lait - the former acrid, luke warm, and rarely refilled while the later was first delivered as café au lait and later completely forgotten until the server was reminded...not a good start.Seated and listening to the music overhead as I translated the menu for my mother and aunt it would be some time before our server returned and after the drink order we set to simply pointing out our options on the menu to be sure all went well - a successful strategy as it would turn out, though it would take twenty minutes before she returned to inform me that the poutine I'd selected could not be ordered until after 10am and another fifteen minutes thereafter before our plates would arrive along with an unexpected $1.50 side of bacon that no one knowingly ordered (and was subsequently removed from our bill after speaking with an older woman who explained to us that our server was 'new'.) Moving on to the reason we'd originally selected L'Avenue, namely the food, the humor of the previous day's fail extended on when my aunt's mixed fruit pancakes turned out even worse than those at Beauty's and although the Blueberries, Strawberries, and Banana all proved fresh and tasty the cakes themselves were not only doughy but shockingly dry to the point of nearly being inedible.  Again refusing to utilize any maple syrup (I'm rather certain a blend rather than being pure) despite the fact that these 'cakes were clearly in need all we could do was laugh - another fail from the only person I know to have ordered dry pancakes at Hollywood's Griddle Café this disaster simply seemed appropriate.Moving on to the bigger and better things, my mother's selection of Caramel Banana Crepes served with a fruit skewer would prove to be a good choice while also surprisingly light as the dainty crepe was doubled over and folded around raw bananas lightly tinged with warm salty caramel.  Again paired with an accompaniment of high quality fruit despite the later winter/early spring I particularly enjoyed the toothsome whole wheat texture of the crepes, though I think we'd have all preferred the bananas to at least be warmed.For my selection, without doubt the most decadent of the group, Chocolate, Caramelized Pear, and Maple Caramel Pancakes would arrive with the same lackluster texture of my aunt's selection but with an ample layer of Belcolade bittersweet chocolate disks, sautéed pears, and a half-cup of buttery pear jus mixed with maple syrup and salty caramel over top there was no semblance of 'dry' on this plate, just a whole lot of richness and a distinct lack of subtlety where a little went a long way; the best item of a nearly $45 breakfast after tax and tip where the only real 'highlight' was the bathroom - a really cool bathroom - but not a bathroom warranting a $15/pp admission price."

Best I've had. Every aspect of the dining experience was just better than anything I've had here. Dining space, a lot bigger, food quality, service, serving size, you name it, it's better. I got the version with chorizo which was great, but had a taste of the classic with pulled pork which was even more outstanding. Even the side of potatoes the benny came with was really good.  I can imagine this place being ridiculous at peak hours though because we went on a Wednesday morning and it was almost packed.

My husband and I took a trip to Montreal for the long weekend and decided to come here for brunch.  First, HUGE line out the door.  It was freezing in montreal that weekend and it was no fun lining up outside.  It seems to be the trend in Montreal as most places we went to that weekend seemed to have a line up out the door! Regardless, this place was totally worth the wait in the cold. Inside, it's a bit cramped but I don't mind being cramped as long as I'm not waiting in the freezing cold...so good for them for maximizing space usage in their restaurant! The menu is completely in French and despite me having taken French well into my senior year of high school, I was pretty rusty and was pretty thankful for Mr. Google translator! haha I ordered the eggs benedict with panko crusted french toast.  It was the perfect blend of sweet and salty.  So good...best eggs benedict ever!  My husband ordered the steak and eggs benny.  Very different flavours in the two dishes but very well developed flavours.  We enjoyed both thoroughly.  We also loved the skewer of fruit!

There is a reason for the wait, and so if you have the luxury to come at an off peak time, then take your chance! They have a huge page of eggs benedict concoctions! Our large group had a number of eggs benedict, and none of them disappointed. I also thoroughly enjoyed the potatoes and the salad that accompany it. I always appreciate when the sides receive as much attention to flavor as the rest of the dish. I also liked the skewered fruit that precedes the meal. The portions are quite large, and you will not leave here even remotely hungry! I struggled to attempt to finish my potatoes... they were so tasty. Perhaps I shouldn't have ordered my milk shake, but it was so delicious, I still don't regret it. THIS IS A PLACE TO WHICH I MUST RETURN!"

Came here for brunch on Saturday around 3 ish and  was expecting a huge line but there was only one couple in front us! Woo hoo! We really lucked out! One of the waiters was about to seat us in a tiny table in front but decided to move us to a booth in the back for my friend and I! Can you say VIP treatment? It only got better from there! Our server was so attentive offering up suggestions for a good brunch since the menu was in French. I ended up with Eggs Benedict with Salmon, a fruit kebab, and some freshly squeezed orange juice. Firstly, I can proudly state that this was the best brunch I have ever had and I consider myself a professional bruncher! Not only was the meal plentiful but the quality of the ingredients was superb. My friend had an omelette with goat cheese and it was amazing, I have never tasted an omelette like that in my life. Price is about 15 bucks for a meal but that's a steal for the amount of food and the amazing quality you get. Plus the service is fabulous, something that a lot of restaurants seem to forget about. Our server always came back to ask us about our meal and kept the coffee flowing.After all this was done I have to say the hidden or not so hidden gem has got to be the washroom! Yes the washroom! It's like stepping into another dimension with black lights and graffiti. That has got to be the most unexpected/creative washroom I've ever been in. So fun and entertaining don't forget to snap some pics while in there!"

First thought: YUM. Second thought: HUGE! I was delighted!The menu is all in French, but our waiter was more than happy to translate for us. We all started off with a mango-pineapple-lychee concoction ($7, but sooo big) and ordered a variety of Egg Benedicts - their specialty!Unlike most of the restaurants we ate at during our time in Montreal, the food didn't take forever to come out. The presentation was simple but the food was amazing! My chorizo egg bennie's yolk was perfectly runny and the chorizo added a bit of spice to the meal. The highlight of the dish was definitely the potatoes! Perfectly seasoned and soft - I could eat those as my entire meal! My gf's bennies weren't runny though :( However, L'avenue will gladly make you another one so make sure you tell 'em!The huge fruit skewers that came with every entree was a great refreshing treat. I'm talking chunks of watermelon, grapefruit, banana, pineapple - the works! The BEST part of L'avenue though, has to be their crazy black light bathrooms. MUST SEE! Love this placeee :)"

I would actually move in if they would let me so I wouldn't have to wait in line. The lines are long.....but soooo worth it. The food is mind-boggling delicious. I'm not a true believer in magic but I kind of feel the kitchen is full of witches and wizards using spells to create foods that bewitch my taste buds.......you think I'm exaggerating?? go try it for yourself. Forget the food, my bowl of latte was the best I've ever had, I asked the waiter what was inside and he just smiled and wouldn't give me a straight answer. Everything that either came to our table or passed us by on the way to another table looked incredible. They give nice sized portions and good service. I had the Caramelized Banana French toast with Captain Morgan Spiced Rum, Italian Nutella and coconut.....who even thinks of putting all these amazing flavors together in one awesome dish?? Witches and wizards, that's who......see what I did there, came full circle on that one.  I like the fact that they've done a great job appealing to everyone....they even have several gluten free options. One of my friends ordered a gluten free eggs Benedict that was outstanding. We had alot of food.....the pancakes were great, the Reeses milkshake was to die for (although it didn't come to that fortunately), MTL bagels, homemade sausage, crispy bacon and all for about $70. When you consider how amazing everything was and the absurd amount of food we had for just 3 people, it was very reasonably priced. I sincerely hope they open one in the Westmount/NDG region........they'd be packed. Try this place, you won't regret it!"

The French toast was fantastic, topped high with lots of fresh banana, strawberries, and blueberries. The servers here were great - very friendly and attentive!

All three dishes had generous portions and tasted excellent.The eggs benedict are perfectly done, runny when broken and with a very tasty sauce. The french toast was delicious - light and fluffy, and the corners of it sugar coated. Steak, smoked meats were all delectable as well.

/user_details?userid=pFxmke6F_xduXhfu3-Qcag,Celeste M.,"Rahway, NJ",3 star rating,"This is basically the place to be for breakfast/ brunch. A friend and I were hungry and in the area. We had heard wonderful things about the menu and were dying to try out the benedict selection.  We came by around noon on a Saturday...BIG MISTAKE. The line was about a 1.5 hour wait time. We were already hungry so we decided against it and chose another place. On Sunday, we woke up early and came around 9:30am and there was still a line. This time we waited about 45min before we were seated. Once inside we realized why there was such a long line/wait time. The place is tiny! We were seated in very close proximity to the tables around us. So close in fact that we could share menus and actively discuss our daily plans. If you're not as social as me and my companinon, this might be a huge deal breaker. I ordered a chorizo eggs benedict and I must say it was lackluster. There was plenty of food but not a lot of flavor. The chorizo was the main contributor, which was kind of the downfall as sausages in general are rather salty. My friend however loved her dish. She ended up ordering the famous French Toast Benedict and was thrilled with the sweet and savory combination. Overall, if you're okay with lines, cramped seating and you order the French Toast Benny, you'll have a five star experience! I'm happy I tried it, but there is an abundance of breakfast spots in Montreal to try so I don't think this one will make the list next time I visit."

The kitchen is at the very front of a restaurant, which I believe was done on purpose to have all the people waiting in line salivating.

You must get the smoothies! They are HUGE... like you should probably share it with whomever you are with because it is practically a meal in itself. I had an oreo milkshake with my breakfast on our last day (ya, aren't I a healthy eater ;)) haha. The milkshake was so thick and wonderful - like your dream frappe-ish milkshake. One note - be prepared all you non-french speaking Americans (like myself), the menu is in French.. no english here buddy. I had a benedict with french toast the first time. You know me - I love that sweet and savory. ;) It was really good and the food came out quickly. The breakfast potatoes are BOMB... no but really they are so good. Of course the maple syrup is real... obviously, this is Canada folks, and it comes out in cute little cans. My breakfast on the last day of our trip was a ham and cheese crepe.

My coffee came with a small chocolate on the side, the table water was watermelon-infused and the maple syrup on all tables was the real, authentic good stuff. On to the menu, which offers limitless options. It really is hard to choose, but the good news is, you can't go wrong. We had eggs over easy (cooked perfectly) with a side of Montreal smoked meat (when in Rome...), crispy breakfast potatoes and then, the pièce de résistance, the carrot cake pancakes (there were several other contenders including the salty pretzel pancakes).We also had the ""gym dude"" omelette, which is very much my kind of brunch food. Egg whites with chicken and mushrooms, with a side of huge delicious salad. Perfect for the health conscious, brunch-loving, weekend warrior who wants to eat more than steel cut oats and greek yogurt, which is also in the menu in case that happens to be your jam.Service was fantastic.

/user_details?userid=zd-g93ldnxOu3pdjOlyUOw,Jon M.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Visited this place twice over a span of 3 days in late August where I ordered three different egg benedict dishes (which inconveniently escapes my memory right now) just to feel a range of emotions from elation, awe, guilt, gluttonous intent & action, envy and some wrath for having left. I'm sure there were other deadly sins in the mix too.IT'S ALL GOOD! My glowing review is a drop in the proverbial ocean of great reviews L'Avenue du Plateau deserves. The line that forms is worth the wait but the staff does well in ensuring that people get their seating in a reasonable amount of time. Want a shot of whiskey while you await your order? Consider it done. Our waiter offered us shots which completely caught me off-guard but were gladly downed upon delivery.I was fortunate to try L'Avenue when a street fair took place before school started. So it added even more fond memories to our visit.I plan to drive from NJ back to Montreal so that my wife & kids could witness for themselves the wonder that goes by the name of L'Avenue du Plateau."

I had the truffled eggs on toasted brioche with mushrooms and it was YUMMY. There's always a line and I had walked by thinking: My goodness the food must be good and cheap!I was not disappointed. I'd love to go back and try their Eggs Benedict or basically anything on their menu (except Crepes.. I can eat those at home).SO SO SO good.Menu is only in French, the receipt was kind of weird, it looked like I had already paid (?) and I was full at the end which is saying something (I usually need two breakfasts' to feel full)Oh.. and the bathrooms are very cool.

However after waiting one hour (in the rain, no less), I was extremely disappointed. The coolest part about the entire restaurant was the decor and I do not mean the bathroom! The menu is based on TV game shows which is a cute theme, but the food was only, dare I say, just ok. It was by far the most mediocre breakfast/brunch food that I have ever had in my life and I have traveled and eaten in many parts of the United States and many other countries. The waiter was slightly pleasant but he also seemed a bit rushed and irritable and when we asked questions about the menu. The smoothies looked good, but did not try one since the food was not very impressive.The prices were high especially for the food, service and the long wait. I would not recommend waiting hour in line to eat here, especially in the rain and hate that I did so. I did appreciate that they brought umbrellas out to us so we would not get so wet. I'm not sure why they have such high ratings, perhaps me and my party ordered the wrong food,  but in any case I will not be returning."

The water is infused with watermelon, which gives a very unique taste. The decor is very hipster and unique. (make sure to check out the washrooms) Every table has a huge can of maple syrup and the service is incredible, the waiters are willing to wait on you with a smile regardless of your needs.

Came here for brunch (love brunch!) and was NOT disappointed.  I came here on a weekday around 1pm and waited for about 15 minutes for a table.  I would have waited longer if I had to.  This place oozes of hipster cool (yeah, I said it...), the food is delicious, portions are huge (American portions - for good or for bad, I'll let you decide), extensive menu (in French only) and fast service.  A tattooed mannequin keeps you interested while waiting outside, a graffiti wall greets you inside and a motorcycle overhead reminds you that only cool places have them. I would have ordered the latte in a bowl but seeing others with it, I knew I wouldn't be able to have an actual meal with it.  The bowl itself is as large as my head. I had the ""Bobby visite l'Espagne"" which was 3 scrambled eggs over a large plate of sauteed chorizo sausages, mushrooms and spinach which was over fried potatoes.  Ah-mazing.  So, so, so good. Albeit heavy (at a place like this, you're silly to expect otherwise) it was delicious.  Did I mention that it also comes with a fruit skewer & two slices of toast (or a small baguette)? My fiance got the Arc et Ciel which was eggs benedict with smoked salmon with a layer of cream cheese (!) and potatoes. Mmm....and this also came with a fruit skewer. The food came faster than we expected considering how packed this place was.  Seeing other tables with the other items they ordered made me wish I came here the day before for brunch as well.  The smoothies are gi-normous but look incredibly fresh and delicious. I wish I could pack this place up and bring 'em home. Love."

The line up outside is crazy, especially on a cold winter day. We waited about 25 min in the cold. You have to line up before you even see the host. Only once you actually get in do you get to ask to get a table.I ordered the Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. I don't think I enjoyed this as much as a did last time. I was a bit disappointed. The benny was good, but I found my dish a bit cold, and one of my eggs had broken when I received it. The hollandaise sauce on it was nice and creamy. I liked the potato hash that accompanied the benny. Serving a plate of fruit first, is smart so it didn't seem like we waited too long for our food.My boyfriend got the chirizo benny, which I actually enjoyed more. The chirizo added a nice element to the dish.The servers are super busy (there was only 3 of them, plus the 1 host/bus boy) and the place was super packed. But they were friendly. The service wasn't the fastest, but that was to be expected with the place so busy. The coffee was good, it was strong and served hot.Decor: 4/5I liked the funky decor of the place. Very artsy and colourful. There is motorcyle hanging from the ceiling and a manequin on display. The washroom is cool with the black light  and graffiti art. It's certainly the most unique restaurant washroom, I have ever visited.  I liked the food...but not sure it was worth the 25 minute wait in the cold."

It was one of my more memorable dining experiences in Montreal. The brunch menu consists of typical omelets, french toast, and breakfast foods, but the specialty of the house is the eggs benedict. I'm normally not a fan of the runny Benedict, but I did enjoy the chorizo benedict a great deal. The atmosphere is artsy and hipster, and the crowd tended towards the same. The music was great. It was a great meal and a fun place to people watch. We arrived around 1 pm and had no wait or line.The bathroom was awesome. If you miss it, you will be ""blue"".One area for improvement for this restaurant is the service. We were seated quickly, but then left for at least 7-10 minutes without any menu or assistance. When we requested something, the waiter would disappear for long periods. I realize that we Americans tend to get into a rush at restaurants, but the service bordered on the neglectful. If I have to hunt down a server to request a menu, something needs to be addressed in terms of attitudes or staffing. Once we had the food, I was delighted."

We waited around 40 mins which is not too bad given it was a sunday afternoon. I love their watermelon infused water and their baked potatoes taste amazing, but other than that, it is not as amazing as others said. I ordered the steak and egg benedict, too much sauce poured on it and way too greasy. I usually love rich and heavy food, but the sauce doesn't go well with the steak and mushroom. My friend ordered ""gym dude"" omelette. It's okay but a little bit watery. The salad dressing is too oily, but taste good. For the portion, I'd say it's okay. At least you can't share one dish between two unless you eat like a bird. I finished mine without problem, and also tried my friend's omelette, salad, and a slice of bread, yet not feeling full. As breakfast, it may be a bit too much, but as lunch, very reasonable portion. Overall, great service and ambiance. Food is good, but not worth waiting for over 30 mins."

I used to really think Cora's was really good. Don't get me wrong Cora's  is still good, but after you try this place you'll understand why. The bread and butter of Restaurant L'avenue is their Eggs Benedict, they are AMAZING.  To tell you the truth, after hearing all the reviews about this place I didn't even bother to try anything else. And once it hits your mouth... there's no turning back. L'avenue's Eggs Benedicts come in a variety of flavours (about 12). They range from classic to asparagus to chorizo to ""steak and eggs"". While we're on that subject, their steak and eggs are actually Eggs Benedict... with a steak in the middle.I ordered the chorizo Eggs Benedict and decided to swap and share with my friend's steak and eggs. Each order comes with 2 Benedict's and a ramekin of rosemary infused homefries. I can tell you now that both of the selections were fantastic. I'm not even sure which one my favourite is. They're both amazing.       The hollandaise is freshly made and is topped generously on top of a pouched egg and English muffin. The steak isn't really made to order in terms of ""doneness"" but it's pretty much a fast fry steak. I don't know if it's on purpose but some of the rosemary potatoes got in the Benedict as well, which made it even better. You really know something is made well when you don't need condiments to go with the food. The potatoes are baked with a Rosemary infused oil and are delicious. Beware, it is really heavy and filling. I had a bit of trouble finishing everything. In a 3 day trip to Montreal I had to visit Restaurant L'avenue twice.  In fact I would easily eat here every day (if I had an unlimited bank card). In Montreal?  Go here.

This well Yelped establishment certainly lived up to the hype. My friends and I all ordered benedicts. I had the salmon one. While the flavor of it all was great, I would have liked a bit more smoked salmon on my plate. Everyone else at the table thought their benedicts were great. The thing that actually impressed me about the plate, was the fresh fruit salad that came with it. This is not your mama's canned fruit salad, or some crappy little mint leaf garnish. Im talking full on bowl of probably 8 different fruits in a big bowl type salad. It was great. To go with the good food, was not only a friendly server, but a manger who went out of his way to offer us sight seeing ideas when he was busy running a packed restaurant. This place was busy the entire time we were there. Staff was very friendly and food was delicious. Be sure to hit it up in you are in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=pcLoscTnpczsVbEurAxrGw,Harry K.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"If time is not a constraint than the food is well worth the wait if you're looking to enjoy excellent French cuisine for breakfast or lunch. I had the duck confit omelet and can easily say it was one of the best omelets I've had. It was cooked with brie and green apples, the flavors blended together very well. The side of baked potatoes complemented the dish perfectly. Furthermore, L'Avenue has got the coolest bathrooms of any restaurant I've ever eaten at.I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for breakfast/lunch in Montreal, but not in a rush."

We both had the same dish, the eggs Benedict bonette, it's a vegetarian version of eggs Bennie. It was loaded with vegetables, so delicious, easily the best eggs benni I've ever had. Service was good, waiting time was 10-15 minutes which I expected. The reason I gave it 3 out of 5 stars is because the potatoes were sub par, and for me personally the breakfast potatoes are the most important part of the meal."

They make you wait in line (literally, even if it's pouring) outside and underestimate (say 20 minutes instead of 1 hour) the wait as well. I guess I'm spoiled because in Chicago, they take your cell number and give you a call when it's your turn, or give you a buzzer you can walk around with, or even have an app for their restaurant that tells you where you are in line AND when it's your turn. But here you can't move out of the line for the entire duration. Why? It's so silly! And food wasn't worth the wait for me. But then again I may be spoiled. :)"

Not a long one but still waited 20 minutes for a table. My brunch plate came with an assortment of fruits on a metal skewer. I really enjoyed the fruits because they were very fresh and sweet, and really opened up my appetite. The plate I ordered, Déjeuner du Ritz ($15.89), was tasty but I could only finish half of the eggs because there was just too much of it. The whole thing was very heavy and filling. The arugula salad, which was really just plain arugula, did very little to cut the richness. The croissant was nice, fluffy and flaky, and I basically stuffed as much egg and salmon and caviar into it as I could but I still had a lot left. When I left L'Avenue the line was almost three times longer than when I first got there."

Didn't have to wait that long may be about 5 mins for the guy to clean the table. As soon as you walk in you can hear the music blasting. Let put it this way you can call this a day club. They were playing way better music then most club in Toronto. The setting of the restaurant was pretty cool. My girl friend and me look at each other and said this will be a hit on King West in Toronto. Anyway, if you don't know by now. This Restaurant is located on the French side of Montreal. Don't expect menu etc to be in English. The server know enough English to take your order or just point Haha  :-)The Food was GREAT. My girl friend had some fruit juice and some yogurt fruit meal. I had some chicken egg benedict. It was AWESOME. Might be little spicy for some. But perfect for me. They had a bar there. Beside serving fruit juice I think they guy was serving booze too. LOL talk about those party frenchie. Don't expect to get 3.99 for breakfast special here :-) For two of us I think the bill came up to be around $40.00 with tips. Its worth it.

/user_details?userid=sPjCQDOvYjmMRL3H2crCoQ,Samantha S.,"Glendale, CA",5 star rating,Clean hipster restaurant with really large portions. So big that they even suggested that we have our children share the French toast instead of order a plate each. ( this would never happen in America where they push you to over order! ) our waiter was very kind and treated my children like young adults - I appreciated that he didn't talk down to them. We went in a Sunday morning around 12noon and only had to wait 10 minutes. My husband and I shared the breakfast poutine which was just delicious with poached eggs and breakfast potatoes. The only thing that was confusing for us what the difference was between table syrup and maple syrup- no one seems to ever use the table syrup so why even have it? Why ruin your food with sugar water? I think they should just do away with it and always have sirop d'érable (maple syrup) on the table. This is Quebec after all!  Don't miss this restaurant when you're next in Montreal!

Almost ran away once we paid. Bathrooms are cool but look a bit icky. Also, they shouldn't be cleaning the tables while you're eating.

For our entrees, I ordered the classic eggs benedict on gluten free toast.  The pulled pork they used in it was a little too sweet for me, but everything was made perfectly.  I noticed the scrambled eggs on my friend's plate and they were like textbook french culinary school perfectly cooked scrambled eggs.  I know it sounds silly, but I was very impressed by this.  Another friend of mine ordered french toast with Nutella and whipped cream.  That plate was serious.  It had the thickest slices of challah I've ever seen.  The decor was awesome, including a hanging motorcycle, colorful globe-shaped lights, and a blacklight/graffiti art bathroom.  You seriously just need to see it for yourself.  Everyone at our table was more than satisfied with their experience at L'Avenue and it was definitely that, more than just brunch."

The tables are packed in too, real tight that have to be, if they weren't the line would be even longer.After placing your order you're given a skewer of fresh fruit, everything on it was good even the pineapple which I normally don't like. Everything tasted very fresh to me.The menu by the way is in French only, they do not have English versions, I know enough French to figure out mostly what everything is. My dining companion on the other hand might have been looking at Klingon thankfully the waitress spent her time explaining what everything was and ensuring that he ordered what he wanted which for some reason I now can't remember.As for myself I ordered a strawberry banana smoothie and eggs Benedict with duck on them. The smoothie was great but it's really difficult to mess a smoothie up. The eggs Benedict on the other hand was just okay the mustard with it was too overpowering in flavor for me.Overall L'Avenue is just a 3 because of the wait you're inevitably going to have to endure and the fact that my food was just okay overall.There are a lot of amazing restaurants in Montreal, next time I'm going to give another one a try."
/user_details?userid=4nfJXm-V6gWTF7koXJLVuA,Janet N.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"We needed a breakfast that could stand up to our dinner the night before at Au Pied de Cochon, so we headed to Restaurant L'Avenue and weren't disappointed. Like Schwartz's, L'Avenue opening for business attracts a lineup of people waiting to get into the restaurant, so be sure to dress for whatever weather Montreal is experiencing - and be prepared for the possibility of sitting next to a door that's opening and closing constantly as the hostess checks on the line and finds seats. (If it's cool out, wear a sweater.)We were greeted in French but every server spoke English (we're learning, but we're not there yet). As we'd seen recommendations online for the eggs benedict that's what we went with, but all of the breakfasts that came out looked great - huge portions, though! Don't treat yourself to a pastry before you go for brunch (and perhaps going after stuffing yourself at PDC the night before isn't the BEST idea...)We started off with two excellent lattes (in glasses, not bowls, which I sort of regretted... I could definitely have finished a bigger one on that chilly morning). After watching a few people receive gigantic, elaborately garnished smoothies I have to say it would be hard to turn that down on a hot summer day.Next, our fruit skewers, which seem to come with every breakfast, arrived. And they weren't your typical boring breakfast fruits - sure, there was honeydew, but also pineapple, papaya, grapefruit, strawberry and an exceptionally delicious date. Be aware that the fruit is cleaned minimally - peels and pits were on everything, so don't chomp down with reckless abandon.I had the chorizo eggs benny, and wow, was it ever good. He had the smoked salmon and it was also delightful (and much lighter), but the combination of chorizo, peppers, spicy potatoes, creamy egg yolks and Hollandaise was really something. (In other words, I wouldn't have switched. Ha!) The potatoes were great, which is a litmus test for me at brunch - there's no excuse for boring potatoes - and although I'm typically disappointed with Hollandaise sauce that isn't home made (it's never lemonny enough or they underseason it) this was pretty good.Also, I don't care if you have to go or not: be sure to visit the toilettes. If we're looking for breakfast in Montreal again we'd definitely come back!"

She completely forgot our drink order (which is fine, it happens).  But when she realized her mistake--she asked for drinks a second time and we reminded her that we had already ordered 10 minutes ago--she just let out an ""oh"" and walked away.  She pretended like she didn't hear me when I attempted to get her attention (she was 3 ft. away and definitely heard me).

/user_details?userid=5jGKW1CPY0ltwFJdWBpBuQ,Tara V.,"Saint-Hubert, Canada",3 star rating,"I'm a little neutral towards L'avenue. Although the food was good, I feel that people overhyped it. I checked reviews before going and I was prepared for the 45 minute wait for the food (even for just a milkshake) but they all mentioned that the wait would be worth it... I would have to say otherwise. The cheesy eggs were almost too cheesy. The steak was overlooked (in my opinion, I'm assuming some people prefer it well done) and my boyfriend had a normal plate of eggs and bacon but the eggs were not seasoned. I was a little disappointed and I'm not sure I'll return.HOWEVER, a plus, they give you a small complimentary fruit plate the moment you sit down.POSITIVE: I loveddddd the oldies music, I was just picturing waiters on roller blades the whole time, I loved the vibe.CON: It is PACKED. It's not the best location to have a conversation. Side note: CHECK OUT THE BATHROOMS! Absolutely awesome."

/user_details?userid=4s_ZvmdpimzjhGRPPBNyaA,Kevin H.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Probably the best eggs benedict that I've had in Montreal. They had a wide selection of different eggs benedict dishes ranging from $12-20, depending on what you want including Steak, Churrizo, salmon and etc. The dish comes with delicious potatoes as well. The eggs are poached perfectly and the hollandaise sauce tastes amazing. It was quite filling and well worth the price. The dish is also served with a beautiful fruit skewer. They also have other brunch dishes, although I haven't gotten a chance to try them yet.  However, they have shakes, smoothies and other dessert items that I felt were overpriced. For example, a chocolate shake was about $7 or so? So I opted to order coffee which was reasonably priced and they refill it throughout the meal."

The side of potatoesand portions are good. Decor is nice. Unfortunately, it's downhill from here.The remaining Benedicts are soso. The Latte, burger, salad and omelette were meh.Service is curt most of the time. Waiting lines are chaos from what I've heard -I never bother waiting in line as the place isn't worth it- and are pretty long on the weekends.I stopped suggesting this place due to all of the above.If you're up for a hot drink after, Art Java cafe across the street serves good -but overpriced- Lattes."

It is so life affirming a meal especially after a long hard week.1 hour wait to share the glory. It was well worth it.We were in town for Osheaga. Heard loads about this place before but never had the chance to visit. This time I went twice. Each time the eggs benny was stellarThe first one I had was the Chorizio Sausage, the second time was the steak Eggs Benny. Utterly amazing, the most tender steak and the best roasted flavoured chorizio sausage you will ever put in your mouth. Usually the home fries are nothing to write home about but they were stellar. They were roasted in garlic / oregano and other spices. I loved the fruit skewer it just made it seem all the more exciting to eat. I also ordered the infamous Bacon Cheddar Apple pancakes...These things changed my life, I dont think I have ever put anything in my mouth so wonderful save for past lovers...amazing.Dont be naysayer or a lazy bum.

Before leaving, we went here for brunch.The restaurant's interior is so artsy, graffiti on the wall and a replica of Harley-Davidson motorcycle hanging! It was so cool! Their menu is in French and no English translation, so it might be hard for people who doesn't understand French. But their servers can speak perfect English for sure they can help.The food was excellent, my girlfriend had an apple pancakes and I had chorizo! It was ONE OF THE BEST BREAKFAST we've ever had! L'Avenue is like heaven! If I live in Montreal, I would go here frequently for brunch! When we went here, it was a snowstorm, but there's a huge line outside! We were lucky we went there early like around 10 am didn't have to wait for a table. Imagine that, even on a snowstorm people patiently waited outside for a table at L'Avenue! So come early! Oh, the frontside of the restaurant is kind of tight, so be careful when squeezing in between two tables and taking your coats off, you might accidentally elbow someone or their glass of water. Also, they tend to play their music a bit louder, which I didn't mind, but if your preferred environment for your morning meal is more quiet Downton Abbey-style, then this place is not for you.I highly recommend this restaurant!"

Judging from the line up I waited in, it's also a favourite of many others. They offer delicious food for every meal, including a coveted breakfast and delicious and creative lunch and dinner options. I was especially enamoured with their sesame and tofu salad. Unfortunately, the veggie burger was a bit mealy and bland. I would also imagine this is one of the cooler places to go in Montreal for food. Even their weird heavily curtained entrance seems to shun the outside world. The lighting and decor is awesome, especially in the bathroom. It basically feels like a red lit cage with various art on the walls and intense movies playing on a TV in the wall by the sink (Party Monster was playing while I used the facilities). On that note, if you take kids here, you may want to make sure they pee before arriving."

Best breakfast I've ever (or probably will ever) have. I had the Chorizo Eggs Benedict and I can't even express how delicious it was. Those potatoes are the best potatoes of any kind I've ever had. I'm still upset I had to leave some in the bowl because I was so full from the amount of food. Even the English Muffin at the bottom of the eggs benedict was somehow mindblowingly good.My guest had french toast with his meal which I was able to try and it's sweet fluffy deliciousness was something to behold. I don't even like french toast that much! He also had a latte which was also made incredibly well. And the regular white toast must've been in-house made because it was also incredible. Somehow this place took white bread and a latte and made it something worth commenting on.Also, the rumours are true about the bathroom. Take a visit even if you don't have to go.

My friend and I went on a Sunday morning at 9:30, and there was already a ~30 minute wait. Once we sat down, the tables are close together, but the restaurant has a great, upbeat atmosphere, and it's fantastically decorated. Our server was wonderful - friendly, and engaging, despite how busy it was. Throughout the meal, he was very attentive. We ordered the mango, pineapple, lychee smoothie and it is so refreshing and not too sweet. The smoothies are huge, so plan to share :) Once we placed our order, they brought over fruit kebabs, which were a great appetizer, especially while we waited for the food. We ordered 2 eggs Benedict - the smoked meat one and the duck confit one, and both were delightful. The smoked meat was savory, but not the most incredible smoked meat I've had in Montreal. The duck confit was delicious, but the caramelized onions did make the dish sweeter than I expected. However overall, these are some of the best eggs Benedict I've ever had with incredible and ample hollandaise, and perfectly poached eggs. The roasted potatoes are full of flavor!If I lived in Montreal, I would definitely make this a regular weekend spot. I can see why people are willing to line up for it! Also, be sure to check out the bathroom!"

My first attempt at L'avenue for brunch was on a Saturday at around noon...the line was almost down the block....psssshhhhffftttt...next. The second time was on a Sunday at around 11:30...line...next.     Third times a charm. I was up early on a Sunday, not sure why, and made it there for about 10:30. No line, I was seated right away. I then had the pleasure of watching the madness develop as I sipped my morning Mojito. Within 20 minutes the place was crammed like the new guy on 'C' block and a line had formed outside.      Their breakfast menu is vast...in point of fact...the menu is vast but I was there for one reason...Hollandaise. My server, despite my many attempts to converse in my mother tongue, refused to speak to me in English, which was disappointing but the sauce made up for it.    I had the steak and eggs Benedicty thingamajig, it was awesome. Smothered in a beautiful nappe Hollandaise with poached eggs that broke and ran like Ben Johnson.       Their home fries had a nice bite to them, the portions were huge and the fruit brochette they sent us to start was pretty dang fresh. You can see the Sri Lankan guy making them in the window, if you decide to wait in line....but you would have to be bat shit crazy to wait in line, outside for breakfast in Montreal.

No line, No wait, No one was there yet. As expected they did get a lot busier as time passed. We saw them turn a few people away. Our meals were great. We had no complaints. My husband really enjoyed his dish, as did I. The fruit skewers are a big bonus. Their potatoes are specially seasoned. They eggs were great along with everything else.I would have *loved* to try a fruit smoothie, but at $6.95 a pop, I decided to skip. For those who get upset by the wait: For this restaurant, you either need to EXPECT a line up and don't give 'em flack for having to wait, OR you go super EARLY. The place is very popular & well-known, weekends are the busiest days, and they don't have ample seating space - so it makes sense that when they are busy there are line-ups."

The toppings on the english muffin were pretty generous and I wish I could have finished it all.  The presentation was nice  too - it came with a little pot of home-fries (good, not at all greasy) and a nice skewer of melon and other fruit. I also stole a bite of chicken eggs benedict - it was delicious! A good choice for someone who likes a little bit of spice and heat.  The steak eggs benedict was also really good.. with a spicy twist on the classic Hollandaise.

He loved his French toast . The best eggs Benny I ever had. Today we both had the eggs Benny . He had the classic and I the one with asparagus and red onions and mushrooms.  Simply the best hollandaise sauce ! The classic didn't have the usual slice of ham but ham braised in beer . It was more like pulled pork. The potatoes it comes with are just as good but one never gets to finish them because it's so filling. The skewer of fresh fruit that comes with it is  so fresh. They have great looking smoothies and delicious fresh squeezed juices. Don't miss this place. No wait if you get there before 9:30 Ina weekday.

So at 4:45am when I just decided to get up and get breakfast at this place that is famous for its breakfast. Even the Prince and I couldn't get a spot on a Sunday without waiting for an hour and a half. The restaurant is called L'Avenue and in the window they have a mannequin dressed like a Forever 21 hooker with tattoos painted on. The best was the brass knuckles over a rose in the armpit. The worst, well actually it's a tie for the worst; there was the leopard print that took up all of her forearm and the Trophy Girl written over a big diamond on her stomach. Delightfully tacky.The mimosas were pretty good, if you're not afraid of pulp, and they make them with rosé champagne (although I didn't verify if it was actually real champagne). I had the huevos rancheros which is my fave breakfast dish but I don't think that it did this place justice. Waaaaaay too much guacamole on top, which is a very frequent restaurant error. And I'm not used to having my cheddar sliced instead of shredded on top but that's just me. The meal was definitely of American proportions with a healthy serving of breakfast potatoes and a large portion of fresh fruit.There's a poster at the entry with 3 male waiters in silver speedos advertising Mimosa Thursdays 2-for-1. The cutest of the trio, Jeff, ended up being my server, imagine that! And he really went out of the way so that I enjoyed myself. The place got really busy later on even though it was Monday. They don't have a website, so obviously word of mouth advertising is strong.I'll definitely go back and try something else."

Funky decor with the music to match with. As Montrealers, we tend to take all the breakfast restaurants we have for granted. Even our breakfast chains like Cora and Eggspectation are fantastic. I lived in California for a few years and there was this IHOP near my place which was always packed...an IHOP for God' sake!

I hardly ever write these things. First off, you should know that there will be a wait (even at 10:30 on a Thursday).  Not too bad at that time, maybe 15-20 min. Not sure about weekends. It was a short walk west from the Mont-Royal metro station. We had three awesome smoothies to start with big fresh fruit garnishes. They were all good and all tasted really healthy. Even my son's apple juice was fresh made that morning. Each of us then got a beautiful fresh fruit ka-bob before our meals. Big and healthy, yum. I had the eggs Benedict with salmon. Loved it!  It all tasted so fresh and perfectly cooked. The shock was that there were two of them!  This is a meal that will stick with you a very long time. I hardly touched the hash brown potatoes. They were also great but I just didn't have room. My wife had the eggs Benedict with mushrooms and bacon. Again, huge, fresh, and tasty. This was a little more ""earthy"" than mine but she's not a big seafood person. Whatever you're taste, they have a lot of options. The kids had pancakes. As far as pancakes go, these were way above average. And they serve them with authentic Canadian maple syrup. They just seem healthier. Once again, the portions are huge. Four pancakes per order.

Their omelettes are really fluffy, their eggs benedict heavenly, and their potatoes are probably laced with some really addictive drug because they are just so amazing!I used to come here every few weekends and wait in line...I haven't been back for a while now since moving away from Montreal, but I still dream about this place.L'avenue, I am coming back for you one day"
/user_details?userid=gME3JBaJ0Ekj-zMjpDi8eg,Elame G.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,This place is so delicious!  They go all out in their presentation And the portion sizes are huge. I ordered the classic benny (the hollindaise sauce was so buttery and delicious and the pot of potatoes were to perfection) it also came with a big skewer of fruit that out shines cora's any day. If you're looking for a great way to start your day definitely come here. The only reason I didnt give this place 5 stars is because their service could have been better..but honestly i think it was because we didn't speak french.Oh and I decided to take the advice of others and check out their washroom...its cool check it out.

Every dish comes with a cup of all-so-tasty red skinned potatoes, so soft, creamy, and flavorful. And that's just the side potatoes. I had the truffle omelet..comes with tons of mushrooms and spinach...a bit salty but so flavorful. And everyone gets a fruit ka bob! How unique and healthy! They had a whole eggs benedict section, which I was thinking of getting since they seem to specialize in them.The menu's in French which is pretty cool to me. The waiter was happy to translate it in to English for us.Get there early for breakfast. Went on Labor Day, around 10:15am. In 10 minutes, the line went from us 4 to maybe 20 people! What makes everyone feel uneasy is that they don't take down your names when waiting. A young busboy looking person comes out and makes an acknowledgement of your face.Love this brunch place!!

It is pouring outside3:00 pm: we are inside.A baroque place with street art influences overhung by an actual motorcycle attached to the ceiling and rocked by an electro DJ set. Loud vocal chords are recommended to communicate. Then comes the food... and I am full at 3:30 pm. Honestly, very rich menu providing you with unique egg combinations such as benedicts and chorizo. Juices are amazing and I recommend the orange-yogurt-maple sirup freshly squeezed mix. And next time I will get these Mimosa pitchers for sure. Your hangover will not resist to such a heavy brunch and a very pleasant service.However, numbers speak for themselves: you will wait a long time unless you go there during the week. More, waiters might prioritize their tectonik practice over getting tables ready in timely manners. Yes, I witnessed an extremely deep V-neck taking actually 15 minutes to clear a single table while dancing. Perhaps economics would be welcome here.Anyway. FULL. I WANT MY LARRY."

You gotta go there at least once!  They do not take reservation, and you probably have to wait for half an hour to 45 minutes, but it is totally worth it! Food - we got the steak and egg benedicts and something ""complete"" (it's like the house complete breakfast meal). I'm not going to go into detail, because a lot people had already written a very good comment on it.  If you don't live in Montreal, and you don't get to go back very often, this is your first time, you need to get the steak and egg!  For the complete breakfast, it is good because you get to try almost everything is on the menu, there's a french toast, pancake, sausage, the rosemary potato, cheese.... I was so full when I get to touch the french toast and pancake, man~ it was the best french toast i've ever had and i need to finish it.Their portion is huge, so go with an empty stomach, or small-eaters can share a plate and still may not be able to finish. Coffee - I ordered the big bowl mocha, it was alright, more just for fun. Their juices are better if you want to get a drink. They are all freshly squeezed."

The first minus was a huge wait, we stood in the line for about 45 minutes. I don't mind the wait if the food is good. The second minus was that they don't have any English languague menus, so we had to rely on the recommendation from the staff. The final minus was the food. Not sure if it was just a bad day, but the food was not seasoned at all. There was no salt, pepper or any other seasoning in their food. We ordered duck confit omelet, and eggs benedict. Nothing was good, and definitely will not be back."

I was a fan even before arriving in Montreal.I got off at the Mont Royal metro and eagerly walked down Mont Royal looking for the L'avenue sign. Surprise, surprise there was a wait... I got there at about noon on a Saturday. With rain & hail, it wasn't pleasant. Nonetheless, I waited it out because I've beent old that the wait was worth it. I ALMOST gave up at the 40 minute mark, and even went to the nearby Second Cup to refuel. I'M SO GLAD I WAITED. I ordered the Steak & Eggs benedict, and it was to DIE FOR. You get 2 perfectly poached egg, over Angus Beef steak and hollandaise sauce... with delicious potatoes.  Best eggs benedict I've ever had. So, end story, if you can go during an off-time (i.e. weekdays), then go to L'avenue for brunch. And if you can only go during a busy time (i.e. weekends), then STILL go to L'avenue for brunch.

I opted for  the eggs benedict with hot italian sausage served with a side of seasoned potatoes and a fruit skewer.  A word of warning - everything on the menu is in French but the staff is helpful and as long as you have a basic understanding of the latin roots ""sausage"" ""salmon"" ""Omega 3 oeuf"" you should be fine.  The mixture of tastes was euphoric - I haven't had eggs benedict like this in awhile.  The portions are well sized even for my American appetite.  The only cons I can think of are the cramped quarters (probably not the best place for parties over 4)."

I ordered the Banana-Papaya-Mango smoothie and it was probably the best fruit smoothie i've ever tasted.  It tasted so smooth and natural and not too sweet.Now back to the mannequin... we sat near the door where the mannequin is displayed and the kids ended up entertaining the folks in line with their giggling and the ultimate finger to the boner maneuver... i think the video will be on YouTube any day now...Overall, great food and atmosphere!"

Our waiter was awesome, can't remember his name but he took care of us, gave recommendations and sent us on our way with some parting shots.

I ordered the eggs Benedict with chipotle sausage. It was my first time ever trying     this dish and I must say I blown away when I had to the first bite . In the states when you're given water it's either flavored with a lemon or cumber, but at this restaurant they flavor it with watermelon and you can actually see the wedges in water dispenser, I thought that was cool. They serve large portions, so one might be leaving with left overs. This restaurant is pretty popular in the area, so you need to head there early when they open because you'll be waiting in a long line to wait to be seated."
/user_details?userid=vl43zR4ljqPt8qxqJvrKMA,Sam E.,"Tampa, FL",5 star rating,"Go. It is that simple. This was our last breakfast during a Montreal vacation and was probably the best meal we had. Went during the week and got there around 9ish and there was plenty of seating but by the time we left the place was full. We were only offered French menus even though we only speak English, probably the only negative I had here. Waitstaff was friendly and offered to help us with the menu (they spoke English as well). This place is very fresh fruit oriented so make sure to start with a smoothie or juice of some kind. We didn't really know this and just ordered orange juice but to our delight it was fresh squeezed. I ordered the Eggs Benedict on french toast (had to try it) and the wife ordered pancakes with fresh fruit on top. After a couple minutes I was given a skewer of fresh fruit but my wife wasn't, not really sure why and it wasn't placed in the middle (if I could have read the menu probably would have made sense). Eggs Benedict on French Toast = so, so good. Probably the most unhealthy thing I've ever eaten and I loved every bite. I could tell the French Toast was really the star so next time I would probably just get that. One of, if not the best French Toast I've ever had. Comes with real maple syrup.Pancakes = very good. Neat decor and definitely check out the bathroom (really). Would go back here next time I'm in Montreal."

Wife had their classic eggs benedict over braised pork. I went light with smoked salmon on a bagel with tomato salsa, homefries, caper berries.

I approve most other positive commentsThe NOT SO GOOD: I'm a fairly regular customer (once or twice a month) and I've noticed some slippage in the service of late. Waiting lines are long, not just because the place is popular but because service is slow. Recently I spent more than 2 hours in total, from my arrival in the waiting line to my exit...this is breakfast, shouldn't be this long. I've noticed cooks arguing pretty loudly with waiters, not a good sign. Waiters forgetting to bring coffee, etc (they do appear understaffed and overwhelmed).BOTTOM LINE: I love this place (still) but they need to get their act together on service. I've seen plenty of people leave the waiting line. Not a big deal when times are good but could nonetheless backfire on them if they don't take care of it. Sometimes I'm reluctant to go if I'm really hungry because I know how it goes."

Get there early if you can, as it gets really busy.  Make sure you go into the bathroom and instagram that ish."

Ha!, Canada",4 star rating,"here you'll find a young crowd, upbeat (but not annoyingly so) electronic music in the background, large graffiti mural lining one wall, and one of the earlier starts in town, opening at 8am.the meal starts off with a metal shish kabob of fruit.  it looked great but most of the fruit was under ripe.  i'll never understand why under ripe fruit seems to be the gold standard of every brunch place i go to. it gets much better when the main courses arrived.  i got the eggs benedict with cheddar and a compote of onions and my friend got eggs benedict with goat cheese and spinach.  i found mine to be a little too heavy but with those ingredients it wasn't going to be anything BUT heavy.  luckily my friend couldn't finish her eggs benedict and i got to have some of hers.  the difference couldn't have been greater, hers was ethereally light and far superior.  maybe my favorite thing about the presentation of the main course was the little red cocottes filled with potatoes.  the lid kept them nice and warm throughout the meal, and it was so cute i could barely stand it.  make sure to check out the bathrooms when you're here, because if you've ever wondered what it would be like to have a tiny nightclub in a bathroom, now is your chance.  sort of.  there's backwards graffiti on the wall that you can only read when you look into the mirror, and, when i was there, a television behind a chain link fence playing footage from a beastie boys concert.  all lit up by some kind of black light or something.  clearly they had a lot of fun designing this."

The restaurant was crowded but no line up at all. Not being much of a breakfast food person (not a huge fan of eggs and don't eat meat), I was a little hesitant to try this place. Luckily, l'avenue was highly recommended by a friend - I'm very glad I came!I, myself, had the California omelette and my table had pancakes and the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. The omelette was seriously one of the best omelettes I've ever tasted! It was very big and cheesy. The potatoes were nicely seasoned and the skewer of fruits was so fresh and sweet. Two slices of toast were also included. I only finished half of the omelette- I was really hoping for a bigger appetite because it was all so good!I would definitely come back the next time I'm in Montreal! Be sure to check out the washrooms, they're pretty neat :)"

L'Avenue is cutting edge cool, techno music blares in the background regardless of the time of day, the waitstaff all have funky hairstyles and tattoos, and oh yeah... the food is pretty awesome as well. L'Avenue's menu is extensive they offer delicious pancakes , crepes, waffles, smoothies, omlettes... they even have a lunch menu... and if you fancy an alcoholic apertif you can order whatever you want because they have every sort of alcohol imaginable. Whatever you order make sure to get the potatoes... they are to die for."
/user_details?userid=7FyHKCJqEL8803PnBvfTpQ,Novaya Z.,"Winnipeg, Canada",5 star rating,"WOW!  This place is the place to be for breakfast- we tried to come early (10am) but still had to wait about 20minutes before being seated.  Much easier to get a table for 2 rather than for more as the restaurant is not very large.  We decided on a coffee & moka ($4- very YUMMY) to start and fruit skewers were (watermelon, cantalope, pineapple, prune,honeydew, grapefruit) brought out promptly.  Nice presentation.For our mains- we had the eggs benedict on french toast and the eggs benedict with smoked salmon.  The french toast was AMAZING!  it was coated in panko and deep fried I think- the egg was perfectly cooked, not too hard and not too runny, with just enough hollandaise- a bit of black forest ham and gruyere-- all atop a puddle of maple syrup like stuff.  The sweet and salty combination  was perfect for a person that hates to have an all savory or an all salty breakfast.  Plus the toast itself was melt in you mouth good- never had toast this tender!  The smoked salmon version also was quite tasty- good amount of salmon, LOTS of sauce, and tasty little capers.Potatoes- good, but we've had better- At Stella's Cafe & Bakery in Winnipeg, they have the same flavouring BUT they are crispier and more tender.  We like crispy! The decoration here was better though- interesting graffiti art on the wall, and trippy bathrooms-A+ the best bathrooms I've every visited. Very surreal effects....Decent price for the quality of of food- about $14 for each of the egg dishes- Servers were pleasant & helpful- Would come again!"

The spiced potatoes were lovely and all around this was probably the most delicious breakfast I've had in the world. The place itself has a lot of character and the waitress quickly switched to English when my French was so awful. The bathroom was a surprise- beautifully graffitied with an embedded tv showing Sin City. I will miss this place. It was so good I went back a second time for a second breakfast during my 2 weeks in Montreal, and had an omelet. Fluffy and beautiful, and the potatoes were still amazing. I travel a lot and I've never had a breakfast this good. (I admit, my friend had some eggs benedict that came on top of French toast, and she definitely chose best- some of everything they do well.) I think I'd ask for this as my last meal if I ever had to choose one."

After waiting in line for nearly an hour, we reached the front only to have one of the waiters pull a girl and her friend out of the line and into the restaurant, seating them in front of people who had been waiting for ages. When confronted with the blatantly unfair treatment of the other customers, the waiter was unapologetic and attempted to explain his behavior by stating that the woman was his girlfriend. Girlfriend or not, skipping the line is simply bad business, and unfortunately, we won't be eating somewhere that treats it patrons with such blatant disregard."

Then we sat down on a table and the waiter looked at us like we were monsters and he said let me check for American menus. Then we waited for a while and the people who got in at the same time as us already got their food and we didn't even have our drinks yet. Then a few mins passed and we got a fruit kabob then my whole family except me got their. They got coffee and  Nutella coffee then a few mins passed again and there was this huge milkshake with an Oreo in it. It was huge! It was really good. Then it happened again. Everyone gets their food except for me and my sister. Then a min later our food comes out and it looks amazing. The bacon was so good it was cooked perfectly. And I usually don't like scrambled eggs but those eggs were perfect. It really brought out the egg flavor. The sausage was so good it tasted like heaven but overall the food was cold even the coffee. It was okay I probably won't come back.

We had two full pitchers of sangria while waiting and got proper trashed and roudy. As an apology for the obscene wait, we were given a shot of something (jameson?)...which i suppose was nice. The food finally came and it was fantastic. Dare i say it was worth the wait? Anyways, i thought that they would give us a discount. but they didn't. I did make a trip to the bathrooms, though, and they're pretty awesome. They have blacklights and white grafitti, stenciling all over the walls. Awesome.

From the moment I got there, I was impressed with the off-beat decor. There was about a 20 minute wait for weekday brunch and it was worth every minute of it. Their America crepes are good too, but know that this means pancakes, not crepes. We made this mistake, but can't really complain because it was done so well. My wife got a chicken sandwich, because she does not fancy eggs. It was good for what it was, but nowhere near as special as their Benedicts."

My food was a little less hot than it could have been because they waited to bring all our orders out at the same time.

The one sign that we were in for something good was the fact that the restaurant was packed on a Tuesday evening. I ordered the chicken marsala, and my friend ordered the chicken curry. After a longish wait (the slow service was our one complaint), we were presented with large plates of amazing food. Seriously, on the first bite, we were both stunned at how good our meals were - fresh, flavorful, and delicious.
