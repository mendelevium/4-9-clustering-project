The smoked meat sandwich was delicious. The smoked meat was so flavourful, juicy, and melt-in-your-mouth tender. We were not hungry when we got in there, but we ended up ordering another sandwich after finishing the first. So good.No line and you get to sit down. Highly recommend!"

This place feels like a time warp when you walk in. It is exactly how I remember it always was. We would stop in at the Main for smoked meat and pickles after a night out. I've been wasting my time going to other smoked meat places trying to satisfy the craving because I hate having to find parking on st Laurent. This is well worth the trip and I will be back again because now this is all I want to eat forever.  I always get the medium fat, my husband gets the fatty and he loves it! Even the coleslaw tasted better than other places... I can't put my finger on what is different but it made me so happy!They've got steaks, salads and take orders to go. Apparently they cook on charcoal so ordering a grilled fish or meat would be really good and I'll definitely be back to try a steak! I'm so mad at myself for not going back sooner. I forgot how amazing this place is and it should be on everyone's list."

It was also less crowded here, not loud and the service was excellent. Wish I could get this all the time! It was very hearty. Not dry at all. The bread was soft and a great addition."
/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"If the line is too long at Schwartz, you need a beer with your drink or you have people in your party who want something other than smoked meat then go across the street to Main Deli for an equally delicious meal. In my opinion the smoked meat is almost just as good, but their menu is so much more expansive and they serve alcohol. In addition to the meat I love the potato pancakes which are pretty large and can come with sour cream or apple sauce. The liver appetizer is good and comes with a huge portion. Two people I went with last time got the turkey club sandwich and loved it. I've only ever been here kind of late but it's never been too busy and the service is friendly. If I lived closer I would probably come here more often. It's a great deli experience !"

I walked from our air bnb and made conversation with the guy at the counter. He suggested if wanted something not too heavy, go with the combo, and that is what we did. A smoked meat sandwich and a small order of poutine. 'Twas perfect for two not looking for a full, heavy meal at 10pm. The meat was so juicy and succulent on fresh rye bread, and the small poutine was perfection. And this was take out mind you and ready in 5 minutes! Not the cheapest meal; all in, with 2 Quebecois cherry cokes about $25, but we were full and so satisfied. Overall, they say Schwartz's is king, but they say there always a line and it's pricey. I gotta say this was A+ in my books, no line, opened late, and great service!"

We ordered smoked meat sandwiches, cole slaw, and pickles. Everything was delicious! The smoked meat was so tender, flavorful, and juicy.The food itself was definitely worth five stars, but the customer service was really lacking.Honestly, even if Schwartz's is better, I would pick not having to wait for the same meal I can get across the street any day."
/user_details?userid=Tfax4LzbITBQ4Ysupbeq7Q,Emi R.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"I'm a tourist, so I don't have any room to comment on ""best smoked meat in Montreal."" But as a meat enthusiast, Main Deli was absolutely incredible. My friends and I showed up to Schwartz's on a hot summer's day only to find a line down the block. I found Main Deli on a local blog ranking smoked meat, and since it was right across the street, we bailed from the line and headed over. We made the right choice. The atmosphere was awesome, clearly a hole-in-the wall spot that caters mostly to locals but is also happy to have tourists join them. The waitstaff was patient while we all assembled ourselves and settled in, and then explained the menu and all of the ""upgrade"" options for sides. We all got Ruben platters, and then upgraded some of our sides to poutine and onion rings. Let's start with the meat. Oh, the meat. It's tender and juicy without being greasy or fatty, and literally melts in your mouth as you bite into it. Of course the portions are huge, but you won't want to stop eating it. I'm glad I got a Ruben because there was just enough cheese and sauerkraut to balance out the bread and meat. The sides were all great. The poutine had a well-flavored pizza coating every single fry, and plenty of curds to munch on. The onion rings were a surprising stand-out -- if you don't want to go all the way with poutine but still want to mix it up, you can't go better then these. And the coleslaw was a sleeper hit! It was more like a yummy cabbage salad with lots of vinegar, and was a welcome bite of freshness to break up the meat. All in, I paid $33 CAD for more delicious food than anyone could eat in a day and a Diet Coke, and enjoyed every bite that I could get in. I have no idea what Schwartz's is really like, but the food and vibe here seem a lot better than standing in line."

They also have a much more extensive menu than Schwartz's with a variety of steaks, sandwiches, soups and poutines. I particularly enjoyed the matzoh ball soup. One star deducted because on our second visit, we arrived right at opening and they were not yet prepared To serve smoked meat because it was cold. Otherwise we had a very good lunch there."

Quiet, deli-style sandwiches among other delicious-looking dishes. The smoked meat sandwich was huge and piled high with smoked meat and a swipe of mustard (the pics are of the 'regular' size...would be shocked to see the 'jumbo' they also offer). The flavor was perfect! The sandwich itself was an entire meal (only thing missing was a pickle spear). Definitely delish and would come again if we were staying in town longer"

/user_details?userid=B4NKveWfUJbuIysiVMbzYA,Andy O.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,It is my first time to try Montreal smoked meat sandwich and both me and my friend knew we chose the right place. This place was recommended by my local friends over Schwartz.They did not skimp on the meat. The meat itself was tender and taste really smokey. They have a choice of medium fat which is more meatier than fat but still very good (I just prefer more fats but its just me). The coleslaw is perfect: not too sour and very far from what you get on KFC (in a good way); its the perfect compliment for the sometimes overpowering smoke flavour.  The fries with gravy is like poutine minus the cheese curds.Overall this shop sets a very high bar for all the other shops I would like to try. Good value for money too. It will be interesting to see if Schwartz is all worth the hype.

You avoid all the lines for better smoked meat sandwiches and delicious poutine! It's funny to see people getting off the bus, running over to Schwartz's to lineup as we casually walk across the street to Main Deli.Its a small place but has lots of seating. The restaurant seems a little dated but I think that's what they're going for. You can order take-out for this place too!We got the regular Smoked Meat Sandwich and a Classic Poutine. The sandwich was perfect, everything like I remembered and better than when I had it 2 years ago. It was cooked perfectly with the right amount of flavour and softness. The poutine was also yummy with freshly made crispy fries, cheese curds, and a tasty light/less salty gravy. I absolutely loved this place and I would recommend this over any other smoked meat places in Mtl!"

It is in plain sight right in front of Schwartz's, which I gave a few tries but never seemed to grasp why it became so popular, but doesn't receive enough attention it deserves.The meat is just so moist AND flavourful and the chopped liver is to die for, although their lunch special deal is not as good as it used to be.Of course, don't forget to order a Black cherry coke and put a lot of mustard with your smoked meat. Simply heaven!"
/user_details?userid=1kNsEAhGU8d8xugMuXJGFA,Calvin S.,"Winnipeg, Canada",4 star rating,"+.5 for serviceYeah I've done the whole Schwartz's thing and do believe their smoked meat is good. Therefore why better than to try out Schwartz's arch rival across the street, Main Deli?Main Deli IMO has a more diverse menu, focusing on more than just smoked meat. I personally like it that way, though I can understand others who think it lacks having true specialties. While I definitely had their smoked meat sandwich, I also tried other items such as their french onion soup and hot dog.Their smoked meat sandwich was certainly very good, pretty much the same level as Schwartz's and Smoke Meat Pete. However, I actually thought their highlight was the french onion soup. It is the most delicious french onion soup I've ever had, and I've had a lot in my life. The cheese is very thick and flavourful, and the soup itself is delicious in itself. Good amount of croutons inside as well.Service is very good, and the environment is definitely more laid back compared to the rushed service you get at Schwartz's. Honestly I would recommend everyone to visit Schwartz's just once, but you get an equally good deal here without the wait in line."

I happen to glance at the menu in the window and noticed a vegetable poutine! It was early morning and definitely not the right time be eating such a thing, but I just HAD to try it! It was the only vegetarian poutine I had seen in all of Montreal! I thought this was too good to be true...I entered the retro looking diner-esque place and asked the hostess if the gravy was vegetarian. It indeed was. I was sold....About $12 Canadian later and the huge portion of deliciousness was in my hands. Peppers, onions and mushrooms with very tasty gravy and cheese. I totally forgot to say no to that. I actually completely missed it in the listed ingredients as I was just too excited to try poutine! Vegans, it's totally avoidable as it's larger chunks which can just be taken off, but just ask for it without. I was thrilled with this very hearty, flavorful comfort food treat! Highly recommend for any fellow veg head out there! It was absolutely delicious!! They are really known for the corned beef sammys, smoked meats of all kinds and other classic Jewish delicatessen foods such and matzah ball soup, latkes etc. I hear it's actually a great, less crowded alternative to the hotspot across the way. Perhaps hubs will this place a try next time instead!! I know I'll be back! The newspaper articles and decor shows that they are very well established in the business. Give it a go if you haven't already!The outdoor seats were so perfect on a beautiful autumn morn!"
/user_details?userid=ALB49rGOnyVV3WQySgNkCw,Angela L.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"3.5 stars Went to Main Deli Steak House with the expectation that it would be better than Schwartz - all the reviewers say so. Delicious smoked meat without an hour of standing in the frigid street and maybe our own table seems like a dream.  Started with the Matzo ball soup which was lightly seasoned, rich in flavour and just the thing for a cold winter evening. The sandwiches were good - stacked symmetrically with a generous amount of smoked meat. However, it lacked the balance between lean and fatty, so the sandwich turned out to be slightly dry and salty. Still, it was yummy.Overall, great service, old-timey atmosphere and none of that hour long wait nonsense. But, I would look elsewhere for the perfect smoked meat sandwich."

The longer we waited in, the more we realized that we should just try the smoked meat and then head over to the Main across the street for a bigger meal. So glad we did. Not to knock Schartz's. But I think in the mass quantities they must deliver, their quality suffers.As for Main? Wow. Amazing meal!Started with the borscht, which was delicious. Then had their Reuben with fries, slaw and pickle.Hands down, one of the BEST, JUICIEST reubens I have EVER had. Seriously. Mazal tov, Main! I LOVE your food!Update: On second thought, Main's Reuben is the BEST Reuben sandwich I've ever had!"

/user_details?userid=zJsi98zizZs9wMkaiRD89w,Steve W.,"Brooklyn, NY",1 star rating,"I'm going to counter this one star review with the fact that we came here twice in 2017 and had a good experience, the fact that this is still one star should give you a decent indication of just how bad this experience was, however if you're interested in the details, please read on...To start with we were met with indifference, it wasn't particularly late, and it's Montreals busiest weekend of the year, so every business is embracing that, apart from this place.We were giving about a minute between having menus thrown at us and being asked 'yes?' Which we assumed by the look and tone of the 'waitress' was her way of asking us what we would like. We ordered some latka to start, more as attempt to give us time to actually read the menu more than anything else.The 'latka' arrived, way too quickly, clearly reconstituted from the day, imagine a hockey puck thrice fried in old margarine, then deep fry it in week old oil and you'd be about there.For our main course we ordered the poutine with ground beef, and the 'q' burger.The 'poutine' was some sad old fries that clearly couldn't wait to die, covered in a brown runny liquid that nobody in their right minds would ever call gravy, ever. It was topped off with 'ground beef', which was clearly an old chopped up burger which had a suspiciously similar texture and taste to the hockey puck latka.And then come the 'q' burger. This burger was the equivalent of your tinder date date sending you pictures of Marylyn Monroe and turning out to be Marylyn Manson, which would be awesome if that was what you were expecting, but not when you're preference leans towards the Monroe end of the Marylyn spectrum. It was totally devoid of any of their 'famous' bbq sauce, it was drier than the Sahara during a drought, and the 'bun' on which it was served had the consistency of bread that has been at sea for a week and washed up on a beach.As if the 'cuisine' wasn't bad enough, the 'waitress' decided to call my wife all kinds of names in French assuming that we wouldn't understand, and describe anyone going to, or coming from a formula 1 race as morons. We are not fluent, but we know enough.Just to add insult to injury, rather then removing the burger that was nothing like the thing they advertised from the bill, she added herself a tip without asking.So in summary, if you like really shit food, dreadful service served up by someone who should have been put out to pasture a decade ago, and enjoy being insulted behind your back too. Then you've found your spot.Make the most of soon though, this establishment has no place in what is a vibrant and wonderful city, and I for one will be happy to see it go."
/user_details?userid=ngS7nhw10RJcxsIH7lBonw,Avril D.,"Long Beach, CA",2 star rating,Not my favourite place for a Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich. I've tried now 3 different places for the Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwiches. I went with my family who was in Montreal one person who lives here raved and suggested we try it. Even though I am a fan fave of Rueben's. We were seated in the diner which wasn't the greatest for me. As well there is a $3 min for each person to eat. Even if you wanted to share a monster of a sandwich. We decided to eat out since the day was nice. Our sandwiches sat at the service window for 10 minutes. I also tried to go at 4 am and get a sandwich but they were closed when they were supposed to be open until 5 am. Overall I was not impressed with the texture of the Smoked Meat. Save your money and go to Rueben's. It's much cleaner and friendlier then this place.

It was actually almost packed but they only had 2-3 waiting staff and boy they couldn't be ruder.  First of all, no one told you or seat you since all of them were so busy servicing folks already there.  We helped ourselves to an empty table (with dirty dishes on of coz）and our waitress complained at us for not being patient.  But judging from their speed, we could've stood there until dinner time.  Took the lady 10 mins to get the menu, then another 10-15 to get tap water, and then another 20mins to get our food while missing quite a few components of some of our combo meals.   By the end, I wasn't even willing to stay there for any longer even to get my missing food.  During the time there, we witnessed a few confrontations between local/QC customers and the waiting staff, the waiting staff and dude (chef with bare hands touching the smoke meats!!) behind the counter.  Had it not been so bad in service, could've been a nice spot to watch street drama.  DO NOT go to this place if you were just dodging the line at Schwartz.  For the time we spent to finish our meal at the this place, we should've been able to line up at Schwartz and got the hyped up food.  Instead, stupid us will now leave Montreal with an unanswered question: how good the Schwartz smoke meats are..."

It was a late Friday night and the restaurant was not that busy. My sandwich was literally ready to go in like 2 minutes, so I am very happy with the fast service. The server who took my order was very nice. My sandwich was ""medium"". Although the size is a bit questionable in a general sense, the meat was stacked enough. Since my experience with Schwartz was so disappointing, I have no reference point. One bite into this sandwich, you will feel that this is VERY peppery. The presence of peppercorns in the sandwich is so strong that all you can taste is peppercorns. I usually like black pepper as a condiment but this was almost too much. The meat was soft and moist enough. By its texture, it looked like brisket. I don't know if smoked meat sandwiches in Montreal get any better than this, but I am ok a journey to find a better one."

It was a stroke of good fortune!I had the burger with smoked deli meat which was juicy and intense with flavor. It was a great burger on its own and was amazing with the extra meat. I asked for the fries as poutine (love me some poutine) and they brought me a side of gravy. They would get 5 stars if they had the cheese...

Anyways, I have the say that I did enjoy the cherry cola and the portions were huge, but the service wasn't too great.  Perhaps it's just that I'm not a huge fan of smoked meat but I found that this place wasn't as cramped as Schwartz (I went the week after) and there was no long wait.Also, it was really nice that we weren't jammed packed into a small table unlike at Schwartz. (The 7 of us were packed into a table meant for 4 there!)  I liked the coleslaw and the gravy but I found the fries almost too crispy."

The surprising jewel is their coleslaw!Worth a try, especially when scharwtz doesn't have room.  It is more family friendly."

Perfect smoked meat sandwich, fries, stash of cherry Cott's, sour pickle, good coleslaw (a bit sweet for me but just a touch). They decor is old school and a bit diner/dive. I don't care. You come for the food and it's legit. Maybe it's a memory, or you're having a new experience, but you picked the right place. Old-school Jewish deli menu, and stuff to soak up the alcohol if you're out late at night. I don't understand why people line up at the place across the street, but let them.

Then you will, and you must, order the deceptively simple smoked meat sandwich. It's a thing of beauty my friends. Expertly carved and miraculously seasoned with a witches brew of clove and all things nice. The yellow mustard cuts the richness and the soft rye bread is like a warm jewish handshake. Quite simply- it's the greatest meat put between two slices I've ever had. I told the dude cutting the meat that it was the tastiest sandwich I've ever had, to which he replied by slipping me a plate of more delicious meat for 'the rest of your beer.'  You must go here."

It was unexpectedly served with mustard (not mentioned on the menu) so my husband asked for new bread and I took the mustard-y pieces to make myself my own sandwich. (There was so much meat on the sandwich that we actually took it apart to make two new sandwiches.) We ordered medium leanness but wish wish we'd ordered it leaner. For the record, it *was* the expected amount of fat for medium leanness.The maztoh ball soup was very good. It wasn't Second Street Deli (NYC) or D.Z.

We made the mistake of ordering it fried instead of boiled and it was just *too* fried. It was also a small portion - not that it mattered since we didn't really want it.

When I walked in it was about 1030 and there was an awkward silence from her with a delayed ""Yes?"" In a tone that was as if they weren't open for business? They seemed to still be getting ready for the day but I mean if you don't want customers before 1100 then why open at 1000? Anyway service was pretty lackluster though the sandwich and other food was good. When I went to pay she wouldn't break a 50 for a 25 dollar check, inconvenient but not a huge deal. Only the way she communicated that reminded me of Consuela from Family Guy. Finally when she gave me my change I looked around for a tip jar and before a single second had passed she mumbled ""was the service not good?""  Overall just weird, awkward, and almost passive aggressive service that left me feeling uncomfortable.

I miss you immensely.Stopped by on a Tuesday evening at 3am after a night at the pubs. The place was about 20% full . Service was extremely quick and friendly. My first trip to the Main was probably 30 years ago with my parents as a young boy. There was always a debate in my family - The Main or Schwartz. The main usually won because it was less busy. This is obviously still true today and why I picked the Main on this evening. I do think Schwartz smoked meat is slightly better than the Main (better spice mix on the outside of the brisket).... But not by a whole lot and certainly not enough to wait in line for. First up - Matzo Ball Soup and it was delicious. Two huge Matzo balls served in rich chicken broth. A great meal starter on a cold evening. Next - The Smoked Meat Special including sandwich, soda, fries, pickle and coleslaw for $12. The Smoke Meat was served medium, just right for me. As good as I remembered throughout the years. All the meal add-ons were equally good, loved the fries and dill pickle.I do find The Main is starting to show it's age a little but some might refer to this as ""old school charm"". Nevertheless; I think the place could use a fresh coat of paint and updating.In the end, The Main is always worth a visit if your craving a Smoked Meat sandwich any time of the day / evening.   BK"

/user_details?userid=bW9Im3L8FG_8ZORBoFl8UQ,Diane S.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"TL;DR: Worst meal we had in Montreal. For the love of Montreal, avoid this place. The smoked meat is dry, the poutine nasty, the vibe fake. Listen to the bad reviews here.This was our last meal in Montreal, and the worst. We came here to try and combine our need for more poutine and smoked meat before the drive back to Toronto. We opted for the (you guessed it) smoked meat poutine, but also a pickle and the coleslaw. Poutine: Every element of this dish was poor quality. Don't listen to the people trying poutine for the first time, what do they know? The smoked meat was dry and relied on the gravy. The fries were under cooked and dense-potato (a good sign they were not blanched), the gravy was supppper salty and a bit corn-starchy thick, the cheese curds were still tasty, but the worst quality of all cheese curds we ate in Montreal as they had no squeak.The pickle was a normal jarred pickle, I doubt they are homemade and they didn't even select a high quality brand. The coleslaw was lettuce heavy and had clearly sat in the dressing for a while as it was pickled and lacked much crunch. Service was friendly enough but the whole vibe was forced like they were trying to live up to the ""you gotta eat here"" T.V show. Maybe it was the American family eating near us, but it was the first time all trip I didn't feel like I was in Montreal.

So, I decided to visit it's No. 1 rival across the street, Main Deli. The decor was very dated, and I'm not sure if that was intentional, but common for many of the businesses in Montreal. Parking consists of metered street parking, and bicycle parking.It was later in the evening when I arrived, around 20:30 and the place was not busy considering it was Family Day. I ordered the staples: A Classic Poutine, and a Smoked Meat Sandwich, with a cherry cola to wash it all down. I also tried their French Onion Soup just for the sake of it.French Onion Soup. All the traditional ingredients and flavours were there. Beef based broth, onions and bread all underneath a blanket of cheese. The soup is known to be salty with the onions giving it a sweetness, but it was a bit too salty for my tastes. I also prefer flavoured croutons over bread as it takes longer to break down and it's not simply a soggy mess of starch when you eat it, but I won't punish them for sticking to the classic recipe. The Cheese was done nicely, melted and seared on top. Still, I've had and expected better. 2 stars.Classic Poutine. Fries, Cheese Curds, and Brown Sauce. A dish as common as mashed potatoes in Montreal. With limitless variations of the dish, I always tend to gravitate to the classic just to ensure I get a good taste of the Brown Sauce (gravy) as this is key to the entire dish in my opinion. The cut of the fries was very consistent, an indicator that they were not hand cut, and the potatoes were prepared with the skin on. They were slightly on the greasy side (an indicator that the oil was not hot enough, need changing, or that it was fried in lard) and reminded me of classic fish and chips type fries. The gravy was nothing special, your typical salty beef based brown sauce. 2 stars.Smoked Meat Sandwich. This dish came with fries, coleslaw, and a pickle. I ordered a medium (fat ratio) cut and it came as requested with a fair amount of fat to ensure flavouring. Unfortunately, it still did not stand out. The closest comparison to Montreal Smoked meat would be New York Pastrami, but even then they're worlds apart in terms of texture and flavour. Montreal Smoked meat is uses Beef Brisket, a stringier meat; whereas Pastrami uses the Beef Navel (the meat adjacent to the Brisket), a more tender fattier cut of meat (closer to the belly and similar to where you would get bacon from on a pig). But if you steam the brisket properly, the meat will break apart very easily. It'll still be stringy, but it will also be super tender, and this is where the texture comes in. American Pastrami is more marbled with fat and has a more dense texture.Enough of the technical jargon, back to the review.. Montreal Smoked meat is all about the rub during the smoking, salting, and curing process. The smokiness should be intense, and the flavours from the rub should complement. In my opinion, Main Deli came up short here. The meat was salty, but lacked any depth in flavour from the spices, and came up short in smokiness. 2 stars.Despite my review, Main Deli is a huge local favourite, but tastes are highly subjective, and I'm sure my opinion is that of the minority. I suggest that you try for yourself and come to your own conclusions. In the meantime, my quest to try Schwartz's will simply have to wait until my next trip back..."

I liked that they take credit cards, but this does NOT even come close to competing. Stand in line and wait for the real thing. Before getting to the food, the waiter and the cook were having some sort of fight and cursing at each other under their breath. The waitress was very cold, I'm assuming because of this, but it made me feel pretty uncomfortable. Not a pleasant environment to eat in at all. I ordered coleslaw, French onion soup, and a smoked meat sandwich. The coleslaw was not to my liking and I left it mostly untouched, but I'll chalk that up to personal preference. The French onion soup was ok. I wouldn't order it again. Then the smoked meat sandwich came out. The meat was not as juicy or flavorful as Schwartz. It's heavier on the pepper flavor if you're into that. Schwartz also makes their own mustard which to me is a big part of what makes the sandwich so good. The sandwich here wasn't terrible, but certainly mediocre in the flavor department.Unfortunately to make matters worse, there was a piece of a styrofoam container in my sandwich. When I told the waitress about it she kind of blew it off. The cook offered me a couple extra pieces of meat to make up for it which was considerate, but ultimately I was disappointed overall due to:-feeling uncomfortable due to the staff fighting -waitress attitude -the food not being very good-styrofoam in my sandwich If this was a direct comparison to Schwartz I would give this place 1 star and recommend you don't even bother, but as an objective review of only the sandwich I'll give it a 2 as it is mediocre substitute (assuming the staff isn't always cursing at each other and there isn't always inedible additions to the sandwiches)."

/user_details?userid=aZ1N_QVhGnofla6HcLTGTA,Tony L.,"Jersey City, NJ",3 star rating,"When you come to Montreal, you have to try their Smoked Meat sandwich. I've previously been to The Main's competition on a number of occasions. I decided to try The Main (regarded as the #2 in Montreal). First of all, the big difference I noticed, was the wait time for a table. There was no wait. As soon as we entered, the employee who greeted us said we can sit anywhere. We went around 11:30 on a Sunday. There was only one other customer in the restaurant when we entered so we had plenty of options of where to sit. The Smoked Meat sandwich, I thought was a 3 out of 5. If I did not previously had The Main's competition before, I would give the sandwich a 4.5 out of 5. Now I understand the reason for the long lines across the street. The Main's customer service was amazing. The server we had was very friendly and always checked in on us. Another plus of the restaurant was the free Wifi. Being an American tourist, I shut my mobile data off when traveling in Canada, so it was nice to catch up on some emails and enjoy social medial while I waited for the food to be prepared. Unfortunately, I do not think I will return to the Main for smoked meat sandwiches. Albeit their sandwich was good, but I believe the one across the street is better."

No line up, no abrupt service, not nearly as crowded. Schwartz's is definitely the most touristy of the smoked meat joints in Montreal, but Main Deli seemed to draw a smaller crowd of regulars, the servers seemed to know many clients by name. The menu consists of different sandwiches, and classic Jewish dishes like Matzo ball soup, chopped liver, latkes etc. My boyfriend ordered the smoked turkey and I ordered the smoked meat with a side of poutine and the iconic black cherry cot soda. The slices of meat are thicker than they give you at Schwartz's and the meat is tender and moist, mmm. The seasoning is peppery and delicious. As with any Montreal smoked meat sandwich, the sandwich was like 90% meat with two pieces of rye slapped on either side, super filling. The smoked meat plate came with a slice of pickle, I'm not a pickle fan so I can't comment on how it was. My poutine was also very good. My boyfriend loved the smoked turkey.

What I find sad however, is the fact that the smoke meat sandwich is not edible without the help from the pickle. coleslaw, and heavy mustard.Despite the terrasse, the servers didn't seem particularly happy/proud about their job (prolly wishing they had as many customers as Schwartz since they serve same quality food). And my order of smoke meat platter took over 10min to get out of the kitchen (and I was the only ordering customer). But yeh, people should still consider the Main Deli next time they find themselves waiting in line under the hot summer sun for Schwartz.

We thanked him. A little skeptical, we walked to The Main to check out the menu. As we were looking at it an older couple walked out and essentially told us that they had been coming to The Main for decades and that Schwartz pales in comparison and is only a tourist trap. By this point we had made up our mind and excitingly walked into the cute yet lively dinner that would soon give us one of the best meals Montreal has to offer.We shared a poutine and both had the smoked meat sandwich. Both were out of this world, the poutine was arguably one the best poutine's I've ever had and the smoked meat sandwich melted in your mouth.

/user_details?userid=cL5jML80rWAyzC1z_v4HWw,Clarence W.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I once wrote a glowing review of The Main, which was my favourite spot in Montreal. But man, have times changed. Unfortunately, the original owner of The Main passed away a few years ago, and it was purchased by a new group. They've made a lot of changes since then, and not necessarily for the best.What was once a chill environment with a classic Jewish deli vibe, is now a brightly-coloured sports bar-esque joint with large TVs and bright lights. It's tacky and bizarre.As for the food, the good news is that they kept a lot of the old staff, so the food is somewhat consistent. Although, apparently the smoked meat is no longer made in house, and some feel it doesn't taste a good as the old brisket. BUT, the big issue is that the food prices skyrocketed while portion sizes have shrunk. I understand that food costs have gone up over the past few years, but everything on the menu is 30-50% more than it was 5-6 years ago, and some items have even doubled in price! That is a massive leap. Couple this with the fact that the smoked meat sandwich and poutine sizes seem to have shrunk quite a bit, makes this place not the value it once was. In fact, it's pretty damn expensive now for what you get. My friends and I were diehards of The Main and would meet there all the time. Now? I've been once or twice in the past year. I can still enjoy a meal there, but it's just not the same. The old adage persists: if it ain't broke, don't fix it."

I heartily recommend the pierogies - or as they're called on the menu, vareniki - with sour cream. Ask for them fried! (Note to the Russians/Ukrainians/Belarussians reading this: they aren't actually vareniki, they are more like the Americanized pierogies.)The atmosphere inside is a little greasy spoon-ish, but their outdoor terrace is absolute dynamite when you're in need of a greasy snack after drinking all night."

They were tasty but I wasn't expecting them to be deep fried, so they were a bit greasy for my liking. They came with delicious fried onions and sour cream. I also shared the super-special with my DC. It comes with a smoked meat sandwich, pickles, coleslaw, fries, and a soft drink (or coffee or tea). The coleslaw is quite refreshing and is oil and vinegar-based instead of doused in mayo. Like. The meat was also delicious and the portion was generous. We upgraded the fries to poutine which was the best idea ever. Loads of melted cheese curds and gravy that reminded me of Swiss Chalet (in a good way). Note that there is a $3 sharing charge, however since I ordered my own side dish, they didn't mind us sharing. Cheap, yummy, fast, and open late... I would definitely come back.

But every time I walked past those places (like Banquise, too), there was always DOZENS of ppl queueing in the street, even in the snow! Anyway, I kept getting told about The Main, that it was better/Leonard Cohen used to go there etc, but kind of just stuck to the idea of Schwartz's. Anyway, over a year passed because I never found myself wanting to queue for a basic sandwich in 2014. I know what smoked meat is, eaten it tons, I just wanted the novelty..Anyway, so, last night, walking past Schwartz, I see the same queue of tourists and just think, ""Ugh, not tonight."" Plus it looks bright and kinda clinical and fast moving inside and we were in a lazy mood. But then, walking past it, I noticed The Main opposite the street, with.... pretty much the exact same stuff. However, they also had a beautifully lift street terrace, and attentive friendly waiters, and tons of simple, stripped down smoked meat/mustard. Plus, Montrealers have been telling me it's better, and that Schwartz's was more touristy. So, we just said, let's do it.We were given an awesome table, with a great server, where we were able to sit and watch the queue at Schwartz's while sipping on red wine (something they have that Schwartz's doesnt). I ordered the special: SM Sandwich, Fries, Pickle, Coleslaw. It arrived shortly after, and it was totally lovely.We had a great time, and it was so easy, and so lovely, and some of the best smoked meat I have ever eaten, very lean and nice. I will never bother going to Schwartz's now. I have found my place if I want that kind of thing. Friendly, open, spacious, more options, outdoor terrace, alcohol, same exact food, plus more, history of famous clientele, etc. Why queue? Like Banquise, I will boycott Schwartz's now, more out of principle. Although I actually tried Banquise, to much disappointment. I find it quite rude to mislead tourists and make them queue for something that is famous for being unglamorous; like making tourists queue for pizza and hot dogs in the states. Smoked Meat/Poutine are not fine dining queue type of foods, they're tourist traps. If there's a queue in the snow outside your shop, expand, or work faster, it's not the 1920s.The Main all the way.. What Le Main has that Schwartz's doesn't is customer appreciation and convenience."

Well... the price was about all that was right. For the food, the fries and coleslaw were very good, but unfortunately the main events were just okay (smoked meat sandwiches for my boyfriend and I, burgers for our two friends). For anyone who knows smoked meat, it should be cut against the grain and fairly thinly. Instead, the Main Deli serves it cut extremely thickly, which makes it tougher. We also both noticed a slightly sour taste which we've never had in smoked meat sandwiches before, and didn't particularly enjoy. Friends thought the burgers were fine, but nothing to write home about.As for the service, as many have noted, it was abysmal. We had to ask the busboy for absolutely everything, as our waitress was nowhere to be found. It was the busboy that greeted us. The busboy who asked our waitress to come take our drink order. And our food order. And to bring out the bills. She literally did not check on us once. When we paid, our friends did not tip her, and she actually had the audacity to look at them and tell them the tip was not included. They said they knew that, and she didn't have much to say to that.

You know it works wth numbers.. our table was 31 go ask the origInal waiter who took our order and check with with the kitchen. after a long wait my bf recieves the ""main platter"" sliced smoked meat slopped on the plate. When you say ""main platter"" you expect it to look like a platter. We could have ordered the main special and it would have been the exact same thing only the special comes in a sanwich and not on the plate. So now I still didnt get my food. I orded the burger. It was good but my meat was white. I didnt even bother to ask why . Finally she brings it and stands there and appologizes like over and over again. Keep in mind we never complained once! So now after all this I really started to get annoyed by this whole thing. Anyways you can tell these people have no excpirience in waiting but hey everyone deserves a chance. So now we finish our meals thank god! And I asked our waiter if he can put the left overs to go ( I tend to always bring my left overs to the homeless) I ordered another drink to go with that order asked him for napkins and cutlery.. we head to the cash to pay where it was always there to pay he tells us kindly its in the front we pay.. keep in the mind the front where we went to pay was the entrance to the place. Who does that? I literaly had to wait outside so that the staff can go in and out with the food because obvipusly we were in the way. When I got my bag to go they simply put my sandwich in a paper and didnt even wrap it and put it back in the bag. I asked the waiter for a container or you know even a fkn brown bag!! He said they didnt want to give it to him..now I got fkn mad I come to your restaurant spend my money order extra to take to go and you cant even give me a fkn brown paper bag?!?!?! Is this a joke?? I went up to the owner asked him for a paper bag he had the nerve to roll his eyes and gave me one. Normaly I would blast him but you know what they dont give a shit. They think by buying something classic like this that they can just walk in here and change things around is going to work? No its not. We sat right infront of the line ,orders weren't coming out proprely ... people weren't getting what they wanted it was terrible. I know I am never going back there. It was a terrible expirienceFood was not the sameThe staff needs to go back to school to learn how to wait tables.Goodluck dear old restaurant."

As he has never been, I felt challenged to make sure I got in as much of Montreal as possible, trying not to leave anything important out. Starting with St.Joseph's Oratory on our first day, The Olympic Stadium on day two, and St.Laurent street on day three, obviously with intentions to bring him to Schwartz's, but where else? And we did.We went to Schwartz's for lunch, he had his experience, but we walked out of that door unsatisfied with what we had just filled our belies with. I didn't feel that it was the best smoked meat Montreal had to show for... especially not for someone who had never had the stuff before! So, we make the conscious decision to walk across the street for smoked meat sandwich number two, yes number two! No 30 minute break in between and no walking off our first meal before we embarked on another. We dove right in.No line up, but one customer inside, room to breath, nice atmosphere. ... Ok, not too shabby, but we're here for the food.We both ordered a smoked meat sandwich, figured the best way to compare the two deli's would be to order the exact same thing.Two luscious looking over-stacked smoked meat sandwiches were placed in front of us, and I am pretty sure we both drooled a bead of saliva down our chins. One bite was all it took... ok, we couldn't stop to talk after one bite, but after a few bites when we came up for air, we both knew that THIS was the smoked meat sandwich that would make our trip to Montreal complete. Meat so juicy and seasoned to perfection, definitely more flavorful and moist then Schwartz. And the bread was fresh and soft, it didn't tear apart the roof of my mouth like the one I had eaten no more than 30 minutes ago. At least a 4 - 4.5 on 5.And the staff was also friendly and helpful, which is always a great bonus!Will definitely be recommending it to all my new Toronto friends who are planning a trip to Montreal!

She told me it was 'rye bread'. Which is confusing because of course, gluten is found in rye. She insisted it was gluten free. I thought perhaps they made their own gluten free rye bread. I ordered the sandwich and it clearly didn't look gluten free. I asked to see the bread they use. She showed me the bag and listed in the ingredients were 'enriched flour, rye'. NOT GLUTEN FREE AT ALL!!!!! I explained to them that this is not gluten free and they proceeded to show me the calorie count and say 'see? Gluten free!' They have no idea what gluten is so I explained they are making people sick by claiming their bread is gluten free. They didn't seem to care and waved a hand in my face and walked away. They also had no issue letting me handle the bread with my hands and would serve this to other people.When I left, I told the lady I would only pay for the fries, not the sandwich. She brought me to the table and said 'you ate the meat!' which I did. I explained yes, I ate the meat but was upset they told me their food was gluten free. A lady who was friends with the owners said 'that's stupid!' to which I replied 'no, that's not stupid. I have an autoimmune disease which attacks my intestines if I eat gluten. You assured me there was no gluten in the meal you served me which would make myself or another Celiac person VERY sick.' The male owner asked me to pay for the meat. I said sure. The female server said '$9.25!' Ridiculous! I said 'the sandwich was only $8!' She literally tried to rip me off. I gave her $5 and left. What a terrible establishment."

Yelp rated Main very well so we decided to try-what a great decision that was. First of all they have a patio which makes everything better on a beautiful summer day.  From there on everything else was also perfect... the waitstaff, the corned beef, the poutine, the strubs pickles, the coleslaw, the beer, the hot peppers!  The old man owner behind the counter; I thanked and complimented him on a great lunch and he humbly acknowledged.

I'm not particularly a fan of smoked-meat sandwiches, but I couldn't resist the reviews I saw and read, so I decided to have my birthday dinner there along with 30 accompanying friends.My order included smoked meat sandwich (sided with sours and poutine), a side order of potato latkas (with sour cream), blonde beer and a strawberry cheesecake. I was  satisfied with the food. However, I had either underestimated my appetite or the portions of the food (the latkas were quite big). If my stomach wasn't limited, I would've love to try everything on the menu. There was a great variety of side-orders and main dishes, but the surprising part of the menu was the low price, especially considering that this place is a Montreal landmark,. The best part of the experience, however, is the awesome service that I received. Diane, the co-owner of the restaurant, whom I've only met through a phone reservation prior to this, was very warming and welcoming. And the staff was quite friendly, approachable and fast on the service.The Main, I believe, is known to have one of the best  Montreal smoked-meat sandwiches , but I recommend it to anyone who just wants a nice choice and variety of deli food at low cost, in a friendly and comforting atmosphere."

They actually offer a more complete traditional deli experience in many ways; a broader menu, preparation varieties, and the often overlooked joy of actually being able to sit and enjoy ones food. The food itself is a mixed bag.  The smoked meat is decent, but really does not compare favorably to ""you know who"".  Other items range from faithful renditions to Disney-like replicants; yes, there is such a thing as animatronic kishke!  I'm often in the position of recommending this place outright to friends and acquaintances who I feel will simply not enjoy or understand the perma-queue, forced communal dining, and hurry-up offense that is the manifestation of customer service across the street at Chez Schwartz.    If it really,truly is all about the smoked meat then by all means, cross the street and wait on line. But, if you want to relax with a family or a late night group then The Main is certainly a worthy stop on the tour. If The Main were located as it stands in any other city in the world ( except New York, of course) it would probably win BEST DELI on a a perennial basis.  Unfortunately, for them they are located across the street from a legend."

And sadly they were a little too charred for my liking.  But then again, sour cream masks everything.Of course the main event was the Main Super Poutine.  While pricey at $10 plus, it was o.mazing.  You take good old fashioned french fries, a lot of Quebec cheese curds, gravy and then throw on slices of smoked meat and you get big bites of yummy.One-out-of-two is good.  The fact that we ate and got out while the line at Schwartz only moved two people is gooder."

/user_details?userid=tx9GgDurlLFwjKgvdhI4eQ,Cheryl P.,"Port Washington, NY",1 star rating,"Possibly one of the worst meals I've had in recent memory, and possibly ever -- and I'm not one prone to hyperbole.My family and I were in Montreal last summer, and ate at Schwartz's which, as kosher-style deli goes, we found pretty close to sublime. But as I really didn't feel like dealing with the long wait again, and having read good things about Main (the smoked meat as good or better than Schwartz's, the portions huge, even the poutine far better than average), I figured why not give the place a try?Our waiter, a very personable young man, seated us immediately and took our order. After a good half-hour, we were still waiting for our food. He came by and apologized, saying that he wanted to wait until everyone's selections could be brought out at the same time -- and please note that we were a party of THREE. After several minutes, he delivered to our table my husband's fries and my son's onion rings (clearly the frozen variety) -- but nothing else. I asked him if there were some issues with the coordination of the counter staff (deli meat) and kitchen (other hot dishes), and he said that they were ""a bit short-staffed since the new owners took over"" a couple of weeks earlier. I had no idea that there were new owners, but that didn't excuse the fact that when we finally were served our main orders, my husband's smoked meat sandwich was a pink-fleshed bland mess, and while the roast beef sandwich my son ordered was okay, the ""au jus"" part of it was so overwhelmingly salty that it actually burned the back of his (and my) throat when we tried it. That says a lot, since I actually LIKE salty things. But the piece de resistance was my order. I can forgive that perhaps kishke (stuffed derma) might vary regionally, but it was basically unseasoned white bread stuffing  baked inside a casing. But to be told that I was lucky because the first and last poutine of the day would be mine because they only had enough cheese for one serving was the epitome of WTF -- even more so, because there WASN'T enough cheese for one serving, and not even a half-serving, had such a thing existed. That said, under normal circumstances, the poutine most likely would have been the highlight of an otherwise marginally-disgusting meal. Faint praise, I know -- but that's the most positive thing I can say.I realized, of course, that being told I was in luck about the poutine by our waiter was his attempt to make light of what was probably a very embarrassing situation for him, and we couldn't and didn't take it out on him. As I've noted, he was very personable and likable, and it was no fault of his that he had the misfortune to be working in a poorly-run restaurant serving food that ranged from barely edible to somewhat  passable. I have no choice but to give it one star, as that is the lowest rating one can give here on Yelp, but if I could, I would give it none whatsoever -- and preferably, a negative."

The service so horrible that we were finished our sandwiches by the time the french fries arrived, and that was part of a continuous dance of food that kept on arriving from the kitchen in drips and drabs. The brine pickle had no crunch and the cole slaw was overly sweet. The kishka wasn't kishka.. no carrot, no onion, was there even matza meal in there? What did they do? (My grandmother is turning in her grave from having witnessed that kishka!) And it wasn't cooked enough to make the skin have any crispiness.The owner had a loud arguments with customers in front of us. And bacon and cheese on a deli menu? There is just too much on this menu.

Some friends of mine argue that they are even better but I think they are just being willfully perverse in order to upset conventional wisdom. But I dare anyone to take a blind taste challenge between the two and tell me they can taste the difference. They also have a nice array of Jewish comfort food and are open into the late night.Perhaps the masochistic experience of waiting in line for so long and being treated like crap makes people feel Schwartz's is more authentic and thus better.

I got the super special: smoked meat sandwich, pickles, coleslaw, and fries. I wasn't exactly crazy about the fries (I usually like my fries more crispy), but everything else was great. I usually don't like pickles, but the pickles here were really good.

Sadly that was not what I got at Main Deli. I ordered the smoked meat and to my disappointment the smoked meat comes in big slices instead of chopped up. When eating a poutine, you want something simple, good and fast that you can get the perfect cheesy, stringy bite on your fork. And added toppings on the plate should enhance the poutine for whatever meat your craving. So what i wanted was a perfect bite of cripsy potatoes, cheese curds, thick flavorful gravy and a few pieces of medium smoke meat. Not only was the meat disappointing but the sauce was so unbelievably salty my face cringed after every bite. I eat very salty foods but I wasnt able to finish the dish. My friends know that I don't ever leave a good poutine uneaten and unfortunately i was waving my white flag for Main's overly salted smoke meat poutine. If it wasn't for the late night hours I would not be here by choice. Right now La Ligne Rouge's poutine is still the one to beat in Montreal."

So, we tried it. It was my two kids (ages 6 and 8), my wife, and me. We ordered a bunch of stuff to share. First came the poutine with smoked meat, a side of fries, and two bowls of matzo ball soup. The poutine was the best we ever had, and let's not offend any grandmothers and say ""the soup was the best we ever had in a restaurant."" The fries were pretty good. Coming off a diet for the trip, we half-heartedly agreed that we could have ordered just that and been satisfied. But no, this was vacation, so we also ordered the famous smoked meat sandwich and a side of babyback ribs, which came with a sausage (really, a hot dog). It ordinarily also comes with liver, but this was for the kids, so we ordered it with two hot dogs instead. My wife said she'd just have a dainty bite to taste the sandwich, just in the name of science. While we waited for this to come, I took the kids to the restroom (somewhat grody, hence four stars). When we returned, my food had arrived, but I found just half the sandwich left, and I received the sheepish but surprisingly unapologetic report that it was ""really, really good..."" The kids thought the ribs were the best they'd ever tasted, including Red Bones in Somerville MA (I think not...) and a little barbecue joint we sent to in Mississippi (no way...). They were a little sweet for my taste, but it was for them, so I call them a success. The smoked meat sandwich is one of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever had. And I'm a New Yorker. If you haven't had it, Montreal smoked meat is very much like pastrami. We had no choice but to polish off a second.  (This time, she just had a dainty bite.) They gave us a world-class pickle and side of coleslaw too. All in, this excellent pig-out lunch cost $60--about right.  Schwartz doesn't need to be any better."

When out order was taken, the original server was confused (I'm assuming from all the bickering going on with the kitchen staff). The restaurant wasn't very busy, but it was very unprofessional. We asked for a side of sweet potato fries, not only was it terrible and flavorless, but the rest of the meal of chicken, ribs, and liver steak was even worse (I have no idea how they could have sunk even lower than the fries). The ribs and chicken had been doused in some sort of sweet gravy to mask its obvious dryness and general lack of flavor (I'm sure it was burnt too, but at that point, no one could tell). So even though we were hungry, we decided to not consume more than a few bites (we couldn't....it'd be like saying.... 'Hey I want good poisoning!'). Besides that, the bread at the beginning was hard and dry, the regular fries epically soggy. We left the entire meal, having consumed the only saving grace....the glasses of water.

The smoked meat had a delicious crust of whole cloves and other spices, and we had a choice of lean, medium, or fat. Mike and Vince got theirs lean and I got mine medium, but both ways, it was really nice that it wasn't greasy. Mike got the smoked meat sandwich, Vince got a smoked meat platter, and I went with the smoked meat poutine, which was a tasty combination.

And for under $10, you really can't go wrong... especially when you haven't had to stand in line for 20 minutes."

Gravy obviously made from painstakingly reduced beef stock, rather than thickeners.  Deliciously sauteed red peppers. Fresh curds. A serious step above your average Montreal poutine."

Iced tea used to be in a can, now it comes from a machine, slaw has changed and smoke meat is cold, too bad I really liked this place before. Guess will get in line across the street or head over to Outremont."

I was not disappointed. As others have stated, you can brave the line-up across the street at Schwartz's, or you can come in here and sit comfortably at your own table and enjoy tender smoked meat that is as good or better than the competition's. As a bonus, their poutine is also outstanding; I had a combination meal of a Smoked Meat sandwich with a side of poutine and a can of black cherry soda, and walked out satisfied and happy."
/user_details?userid=lZgIq71kUEWfmdAuLvtiog,DJ M.,"Van Nuys, CA",5 star rating,It's been almost 2 years since I went here and I still think about their smoked meat platter. Coming here was accidental as we intended to go to Schwartz's but I was too hungry to wait in line. All I have to say is what a fantastic consequence!  We almost had the whole place to ourselves which means I can happily stuff my face with poutine and slices of smoked meat in peace.

Well it was late!"

/user_details?userid=Z-yRxHhGksKAlnRlx8pB2g,Casey W.,"Seattle, WA",3 star rating,"A quick business trip had me looking for Montreal's famous smoked meats that I've lusted for since discovering Ben's 10 years ago on F1 weekend binges.  Main get's high marks for authenticity and decor, nice simple and authentic diner/deli feel. I got the smoked meat platter, the meat was good, but not as tender as the beloved Ben's. Coleslaw was nice, fries were good. Didn't blow me a way, but reminded me of yet another thing I like about Montreal."

/user_details?userid=vtP1Sne6TwBhhHSLZojPcA,Jeff C.,"Laurel, MD",3 star rating,"Having always acknowledge the rivalery (however fictitious) between Schwartz and Main, I stepped out of the Schwartz's long line for a comfy meal at Main.  First, the place is not even a third full.  I sat down and ordered my smoke meat.  The bread is softer than Schwartz's but less flavor.  The meat succulent, juicy and melts in your mouth.  However, the spice is overpowering the flavor of the meat (or is the flavor of the meat lacking?).  It's missing that Schwarts flavor of meat that makes you instantly recognize the smell and the taste.  So I believe this is a case of classical (or whatever you call it) conditioning where people remember the taste and smell of Schwartz's meat better than Main. Doesn't mean Schwarts' better, just that I want Schwarts' flavor, and Main's succulent melt-in-your-mouth quality on the meat.  I hope Schwarts' can use less line, and Main can use less spice.  The pickle at Main is not very impressive either.  Guess I have to return for the long wait in line."

/user_details?userid=nwn-39vTU5OP1H6iiqMPyQ,Chris B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,better than schwartz's. great for late night dining. sometimes the fries taste like the deep frying lard (i'm pretty sure they ain't using veg oil) needs to be changed...

/user_details?userid=gjnrVDX2l_LGfMEkcKBXxg,Simon K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Firstly, I think this place has been over-hyped by ""You gotta eat here"". Food here is good, but not great. Service is a bit slow and the decor has a slightly dirty atmosphere. I was sitting for a while before a waitress took my order. I got the ""Special"" (Smoked meat sandwich with fries, coleslaw and pickle). Food came at a reasonable pace (you can see them plating and slicing your smoked meat). Portion size is smaller than what I am used to for smoked meat (Bread was smaller and there was not as much meat as other places). However, quality of food was overall good. Meat was well-flavoured (not as good as Schwartz but not a bad alternative; Especially if you do not want to wait in line out in the cold). Fries were freshly cut and fried. Coleslaw was okay, and it was served with an entire pickle. It is also a place where you can get smoked meat to go like Schwartz. Overall, not a bad meal for the price."
