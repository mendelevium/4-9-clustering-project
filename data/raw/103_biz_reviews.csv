/user_details?userid=jpF5VxuG9moPTZzDfAPuSA,Tram L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This was one of the restaurants on my list, for a LONG time. I finally went with a friend for dinner because it's gotta happen!The place is nice, it is certainly smaller than I imagined, I guess the name ""plaza"" influenced me. The staff was friendly and funny. We sat at the bar and ordered some cocktails to start while obseerving the opened kitchen (i love watching the action!) For food we ordered the veal heart & razor clams, chopped liver and a Foodchain salad. WOW!!! The texture in the veal heart & razor clams was so amazing! You have the sea taste & chew of the clam, then the slightly more dense & meaty chew of the heart slices and then the crunch of the greens & the fried toppings. The salad was very refreshing, lots of bright tasting elements of apple, radish, spinach, etc and the nuttiness of sesame seeds. The chopped liver was a contrast to the other two dishes: rich umami on buttery brioche toasts with bursts of berries and cheese And that wasn't even all... We ordered a squash ice cream with popped rice & curry and a glass of their  suggested wine pairing. *bring hands to face in awe* I WOULD TOTALLY DO THIS ALL OVER AGAIN!!!!!!!"
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here after my graduation for dinner with my family. My parents were very familiar with the chef and the restaurant as it has been featured in many articles and radio shows. The concept is eccentric. The decor is unassuming at first but once you sit down you realize ""oh. So that was an Elmo plushie sitting alone at that table over there. There's a makeshift air plane on the fan and an upside down dollhouse on the ceiling."" It's very entertaining to try to spot all the Easter eggs. The menu is also very out there. Portions are bigger than an entree but smaller than tapas. It's meant to be shared and for four people, we were told to order around 8-10 dishes. My parents went for the tasting menu which is $85/person. I went with the lamb tartar, the Caesar salad, and the Creton Big Mac (menu of the day). My sister got the lamb navarin and the cheese mushrooms. The food is well presented and the service is impeccable. The servers really know their stuff. The attention to detail impressed us all. My parents said the wines they chose to pair with their meal was excellent. On my end I think some meals were a hit and some were misses. I really loved the tartares, just wish there was more of it. The popcorn and tuna was the standout. Absolutely delicious. My Caesar salad was huge but it was lots of assorted vegetables and the sauce was a bit too sharp for my taste. The creton Big Mac wasn't at all what I was expecting. It was supposed to be a toast with creton reinvented but it was tiny and didn't taste like anything. My sisters lamb was amazing would recommend. My parents also got some fish and it was great too. For desserts we shared a tartatin, a puff with blueberry cream, some dark chocolate pie mousse thing, and some ice cream. Again the desserts were hit or miss. Didn't have any particular standout but the puff was pretty good. What really sets this place apart is the service. In my opinion that's what you're paying for. And then you're paying for a unique menu with out of the box textures and flavours. As well as an ambiance that's unlike any other. It was a full house on a Monday night despite the construction on st Hubert! That's saying something."

A delicate interplay of flavors combine to make every dish in the tasting menu a medley of perfection. The tasting menu ($85) is fresh, inventive and absolutely delicious. The ambiance is very playful, yet contemporary, with Elmo, an upside dollhouse, a smurf and a bear in an airplane, alongside a grandfather clock and other fine decor. If it's your birthday, they come up wearing animal hats, and/or they may play Star Wars music and put a fun hat on your head with sparklers on top.The playlist is amazing. They got some good beats. The service is down to earth and unpretentious. You can see why this restaurant is in the top 100 list. It deserves every accolade it receives. I was blown away by every dish. The food is to be savored. It is perfection."

Casually having dinner while making eye contact and realizing P!nk is in the house with her bodyguard few tables away from us. Then our waitress ends up telling me that we are currently having 3 celebrities at Montréal Plaza like it's not biggie.In all honesty the reason why I am a reoccurring client at Montreal Plaza is because this is definitely a fine dining and perfect date experience without having to be pretentious. Is this french cuisine? Nouveau cuisine? What I can confirm is that they strive on delivery quality local product with a modern twist. Montreal Plaza is definitely high up there in my list of ""must try in Montreal""."

This place is unpretentious and inviting. They don't take themselves to seriously which is the best part. Serving dinosaurs with your meal. The waiter was knowledgeable, funny and efficient. The decor is relax. The food was fresh, different, innovative and most importantly memorable. Usually I won't go back twice to fine dinning places twice...but let me tell you, this place makes you want to come back to relieve the entire experience. Thanks Montreal plaza and to your team!"
/user_details?userid=IYP5YVCGN37hsQOm8YJoPA,Arunabha C.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"My wife and I went to Montreal for our honeymoon and had the pleasure of dining here. I was initially attached to the idea of getting a reservation at Joe Beef but that was unsuccessful, and through some digging, found out about Montreal Plaza. We could not have left that place any happier.To begin, service was great, friendly, prompt and attentive. And they did an excellent job of explaining the dishes. We ordered 5 dishes (1 small, 3 medium and 1 large) along with 2 desserts. We started with the pork croquettes and fish tartare. Both were outstanding. The pork croquettes had a delightful texture and the pork was tender and extremely flavorful. Neither of us are huge fans of tartare, but this particular dish was terrific. After that we had their interpretation of fish and chips and a dish called the lobster volcano. Lovely, tasty, savored each bite. We topped it all off with a mushroom and cheese dish and 2 extraordinary desserts. Our bill came out to the equivalent of about $180 US. And we ordered a bottle of wine. My favorite meal of the year and we've been to multiple Michelin star spots here in nyc this past year. Can not recommend enthusiastically enough."
/user_details?userid=zZjNwaX7KKCWhs7sovzwCQ,Ki Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"The dining experience at Montreal Plaza is very memorable. First off, I dig the interior which is simple and clean, yet they sporadically but purposefully placed zany and quirky items and decorations around the premises that add the personality. I.e. a giant rooster head, an Elmo doll, and an upside spinning table suspended from the roof.Now to the food. We elected for the 4 course menu, in which it wasn't exactly a prix-fixe but instead the waiter asked us what kinds of food we liked and then basically went to the kitchen so they can build out our 4 course meal based off our preferences.I can't remember everything they described, so I won't try. But what I will say is that they delivered on appealing to our taste buds and stomach's desires. We told them we like more meat/proteins and less carbs in our meals. They delivered and then some. Great balance and flavor in each dish. And the entree dish was amazing. Melt in your mouth piece of braised beef with a nice uni butter to top it all off. Atop well-seasoned sushi rice. The dessert was refreshing and both fruit based which we appreciated. It was definitely a unique dining experience but I'm sure their regular menu items are very good too and hope to one day try them next time I'm in Montreal.And last but not least...The service was amazing. Very friendly, very attentive, and timely."

/user_details?userid=iJ_sn6RfwO5unR9YgFTd4Q,Camille R.,"Côte-des-Neiges, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Best restaurant hands down I've been to in Montreal. It was my second time. First time was in 2017 and it blew my mind once again. Every single dish is just perfection. We ordered a lovely bottle of white wine to accompany the food which was called 65 rosiers. Very crisp and delicious. When you see cannelloni on a menu you would expect pasta but this one was nothing about pasta - it was stuffed with halibut and the outside was a delicious fresh cucumber. Then tastes and textures were out of this world. Then the chicken liver mousse and foie gras was lovely. The meat tartar was so special with the little popcorns giving it a unique texture. Wow. Then we had the cavatelli which was in delicious sauce with mushrooms. So good. We also had their famous brussel sprouts dish which comes on a huge stem and it is very impressive. The Parmesan on it was just amazing. Almost tasted like a super rich Mac and cheese and this is a vegetable !!! But the piece de resistance is the welk gratiné ! I had it the last time and it was just as amazing this time. The melted miso butter and the little bread that comes with it. Mouth watering dishes. It's very hard to get a reservation so plan ahead! Took me a month and a half to get one. Service is perfect and the ambiance is stellar. Prices are on the high side. For 3 people with a bottle and a trou normand came out to just under 300$ tax and tip in
/user_details?userid=PYbjreZpONNMp25uRSPB-A,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"KenScale: 8.5/10When I was looking for restaurants that my wife Jun and I would visit in Montreal on a recent weekend trip, I naturally wanted to find a place that is unique to the city's dining scene. Due to the limited number of stays, I need to make sure I hit all the right restaurants. I randomly looked up on Google any best Canadian restaurant websites, and found that a place called Montreal Plaza consistently came up in these lists. I asked my friend's girlfriend (both were traveling with us), a French Canadian from Quebec, if she had heard of the restaurant, she said no, which made me both excited and nervous. After walking around the city on a freezing Saturday afternoon we showed up at Montreal Plaza not expecting what the meal would be like. The first impression of the restaurant was somewhat bizarre. The décor looked like a copycat of one of the branches of The Smith in Manhattan, and the dining scene was chaotic too, with a birthday celebration happening at a table nearby with Star Wars music. On our table, Jun was greeted by a Muppet doll from Sesame Street. For all these quirks, is Montreal Plaza to be taken seriously? My best meal during the trip in Montreal (and Jun agrees) happened at this restaurant.Interestingly, the co-chefs of Montreal Plaza came from Toqué which Jun and I had just visited the previous night. Compared to the classical approach of Toqué, however, there was no particular culinary boundary at Montreal Plaza. The daily changing menu doesn't have the lavish descriptions of each dish the way Toqué presented to us (in French). A lot of the dishes listed one element, followed by a question mark to suggest that the kitchen is not afraid to put different ingredients together in a way that is completely unexpected. Take, for instance, veal heart. It came with calamari underneath shredded vegetables, and you have to actually scoop up from the bottom to dig up the heart, which I gladly did after realizing how delicious this dish was. Lamb tartare, with a Lebanese twist using raw kibbeh, was also quite outstanding in its texture, while Jerusalem artichoke and cheese would be a great hearty dish to have for a winter meal. For a more traditionally French take on the menu, by all means order veal blanquette that was rich without overpowering my taste bud. What would go into yakitori at Montreal Plaza? Beef bacon and duck heart that was smoky and quite deliciously seasoned on the outside. Complement this dish with Brussels sprouts and you have one powerful combination of meat and vegetable that would be hard to resist. For desserts, carrot cake for two was delightful, as was the poached pear, but I couldn't stop thinking about each bite of decadent sucre a la crème block that would probably get me to sugar overdose if I had too much of it. Overall, I was highly impressed with the unpredictable ingenuity of the kitchen's approach effortlessly blending different ingredients, techniques and culinary traditions.Montreal Plaza is a popular restaurant in the city so booking in advance is always recommended. There is full bar with some potent cocktails that will keep you warm on a brutal winter night. As noted above, the restaurant's dining environment is disarmingly casual and makes you feel like you are eating at a boring chain restaurant, but don't let its scenery fool you that way. That boisterous atmosphere perhaps epitomizes Montreal Plaza's approach to cooking: there is no set rule or order, just a lively experiment with food for something refreshingly unique in a city's dining scene already saturated with traditional and modern Quebec/French cuisine. I'm not sure when I will visit Montreal again, but would really love to visit Montreal Plaza again to see what will be on the menu next time. It's a good bet that what I see in the menu at that time will not look anything like what was on the menu on my visit."
/user_details?userid=2eXPa1f6nP57rA5AeTV8Rw,Jules L.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Just got home from and incredible dinner at Montreal Plaza. It was my birthday celebration with my family and we had a wonderful experience. Food was amazing, the Brussels sprouts are something special, I would go back just to order that and chill at the bar. The meal was exceptionally delicious, the energy was lovely and the staff was great, so I'm giving 5 stars. I can't not, I really strongly recommend this place. BUT, I do have two very minor pieces of constructive criticism. firstly (and this is a personal preference thing) it felt like the pacing was a bit slow and the time between courses dragged at a certain point. We had two rounds of shared main courses and waited about 7 minutes too long for the second dish. Secondly, we ordered the carrot cake for two, which comes with a warm maple sugar caramel sauce to be poured over, for dessert. Unfortunately when this was served, no one called our attention to the sauce boat and so we only realized it was there after having eaten the carrot cake! It was still delicious but definitely clear that this sauce would have pushed it over the edge and it would have been nice to have eaten it as intended. I will be back and next time I will know about the dessert gravy boat!"
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Tbh, I was expecting more from a restaurant that holds the 11th spot on Canada's top 100 (2017). Don't get me wrong. This place gets a four stars in my book but not a strong four stars. The food was good and well executed. We shared four dishes. The famous whelks with miso butter (a take on the escargots in butter). It was my favourite dish. Then we got the razor clam Chinatown style. It was ok. We were expecting something warm (hot) and not a cold dish. It was unexpected. That was my least favourite dish. We also got the cavatelli with foie gras sauce and duck. Very rich and filling. And last but not least, we ordered the meat for two which was the skirts steak that was cooked to a perfect temperature! We were full!!! As for the service. It was good but but I guess it's the kind of service that one would expect to get when the prices are so steep. I personally have had a better time at other restaurants but hubby really like it here."

Let me warn you the food portions are very small much like tapas size but let me tell you these small plates will awaken all the taste buds in your body. The service was great, every waiter/waitress attended our table with detailed explanation of food items and overall questions! There was a good loud hype music playing but wasn't annoying and you can hear your table well enough. The overall experience we had here was excellent, I can't wait to come and try other dishes."
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"By far one of my favourite spots in Montreal! After a third visit, I can say that the food, the wine, the service, the vibe, and the venue, are all consistently amazing every time! Firstly, the venue is just gorgeous! A mix of modern, classy elegance, and touches of rustic pub. The long marble bar as you enter the restaurant sets the tone till you catch glimpses of toys and corky decor pieces; the pub style chairs and rustic long windows add country charm to the space. The food is just delicious! The menu includes daily specials of seasonal and fresh produce as well as their set menu of everything from salads to pasta and meats. We shared a multiple of plates including oysters, fried zucchini blossoms, salad, razor clams, and a duck and tuna main with greens, vegetables including beets and peppers; everything was beautifully executed, nicely presented and so flavourful. The service from start to finish was perfect; our waiter was friendly and engaging, and helpful with helping us choose our dishes and wine. The feel of the place with its varied clientele and  90s music in the background, gives off a laidback feel to a chic space where you can share a great meal over an amazing selection of wine and still feel like you're at home. I honesty can't say enough about this place; this restaurant has set the bar high for any other restaurant in Montreal providing a menu and venue that is fantastic and accessible to all; kudos to the infamous chef and his staff!"

The music is ""club level"" loud, which is too loud for dinner. The food is somewhat pretentious. It appears that more effort is put into the presentation than the preparation. We were a party of 10 for the tasting menu. I don't recall how many course 6 maybe 7. Very difficult to carry on a conversation at a large table when the music is so loud. Presentation of the food is whimsical and fun. Most course were good, nothing exceptional. Deserts were ok."

Every item brought to us was better than the last! The atmosphere is very quirky and the way they celebrate birthdays and anniversaries is so fun.  This is a must try in Montreal as the experience/ambiance is just as good as the food which is rare for most restaurants.

Great flavors, perfect portions, well balanced dishes,all local produce and seasonal. The service was attentive and excellent. The ambiance was cozy, casual but modern. We estimated that if we hypothetically ordered each dish of the tasting menu a la carte, it would have cost $110. Well worth it!"
/user_details?userid=ufco-sxD9Org0AMxagNgQw,Shawn H.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"We had an awesome dinner here. We had a group of eight, went a la carte, and ordered a bunch of stuff to share:- Zucchini flowers (2x)- Saucisson + melon- Sea urchin (2x)- Razor clam- Beef tartar- Yakitori (3x)- Lobster + bone marrow- Fish tartar (2x)- Meat tartar (venison)Plus desserts:- Blue meringue- Fruits puff pastry for two- Frozen cakeI can't say there was a single thing we didn't like (we ate every last bite of every dish), but our absolute favorites were the fish tartar, sea urchin (you basically drink it out of a glass), and yakitori (basically lettuce wraps with huge chunks of game meat inside). I personally also loved the razor clam, and the blue meringue (basically blue cheese + meringue) was so weird and so good. This was our first meal in Montreal, but really felt like we got an authentic experience here -- this is different kind of food than you'd typically find back home in New York, and all so good. This will definitely be on my list of places I'd like to come back to next trip to Montreal."

Our meat main course of lamb was ok but not wonderful and certainly did not justify the price, while our starter of papaya crab rolls and dessert of honeycomb peppered pineapple were indeed special. Hit or miss is part of the charm with a creative small plate place like this, though I have experienced greater consistency for sure, and the bill at the end, $270 with tip for a light dinner and 3 drinks for 3 people, was painful, and worse, we were still hungry."
/user_details?userid=aV6m_LEsPoZLXFKI770oEA,Mike S.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,"Montreal Plaza is a relative newcomer being open less than 1 year at this point. Located within the Plaza St. Hubert, a beautiful partially covered stretch of streets home to 400 various businesses. We stopped in on a Monday night, since many worthwhile restaurants in Montreal are closed. It proved to be an excellent choice.It was a beautiful night so we chose to sit outside on the many picnic tables - seating could be a bit communal on a packed night, but we had one all to ourselves. We selected a rose wine and the waiter brought out the bottle to show us and allowed us to try it, which was cool. Our server went over the entire menu, which was vast. We had some choices in mind, and were ready to order then he mentioned they have tasting menus at different tiers - we went with the $80/person with the thought we would be served featured items. Our only request were oysters and we received some delicious ones along with two tartares one with scallops the other venison to compare and contrast. Both good, my wife unexpectedly preferred the venison. Next up was the tomato + herbs, which was a sliced tomato reconstructed with greens and dressing which simply tasted like glorious summer. The shrimp sandwich came with this. The fried shrimps were perfectly fried, but I thought this dish was a bit of a miss with the shrimps being on the smaller side and not a fan of the thin fried ""bread"".The next and final course was the poultry for two that was an incredible platter of perfectly cooked, amazingly delicious chicken with whelks and various roasted vegetables. A slightly sweet sauce with peas and strawberries were poured over as it was served. A strawberry dessert finished off the night.I am glad we did the tasting menu because it was items we would not have selected otherwise. I was hoping it would have been smaller samples of more dishes. My only criticism is that it would have been less expensive to order each of these items individually and it also made for a long dinner. The waiter was cool and gave us the bottle price for our wine when we hit 5 glasses - so it worked out.I would recommend this place - especially with a group because there are so many dishes meant to be shared. The service and food here is top notch. For us it was an fantastic introduction to the way they do things in Montreal and I must say, Montreal Plaza does it right!"

We took the tasting menu, they have three price points, $60, 80 or 100 per person.  We chose the $80 option and were very satisfied with the value.  They are very good about taking dietary requests into account.  We were one of ""those"" groups, with a vegetarian, a preggo, and someone with several food intolerances, but they accommodated us all without difficulty.  Decor is fun and funky, music was on point, service was fantastic, food was amazing.  It was my birthday, so there was a lot of very good wine involved, so no pictures and the details of the meal are honestly a little hazy.  We got to try about 7-8 different plates including dessert, and they were all fabulous.  It's a little pricy for a regular visit, but an amazing spot for special occasion dinner.  The location is a little odd, on a strip of St Hubert street surrounded by prom dress shops, but absolutely worth the trip!"

Anyhow, the ambiance looked nice and I decided to try it anyway, secretly thinking I would hate it.Well I was wrong. Absolutely loved it. The food is amazing. The service is attentive and friendly. The place is lovely. Here is a list of what I tried and my impressions on each dish:Salmon tartare: excellent, well seasoned.Cannelloni (celeriac and salmon gravlax): beautiful presentation and taste was surprisingly complex and wonderfulTempura cod with apple slices: delicious and perfectly fried (not oily at all)Fish (accras) soup: delicious rich broth... just so incredibly comforting.Caesar salad with mortadella: this dish really didn't do it for me... the iceberg lettuce was slightly cooked and I really disliked that wilted lettuce texture. Wild mushrooms and cheese: seasoned to perfection under a warm coat of slightly melted Charlevoix cheese. Wonderful execution that elevated simple ingredients to a work of art, really.Veal blanquette: WOW. This was perfect... I have no other word... I can eat this everyday forever. Thank you for creating this. Prune iced cake: beautiful presentation although I was a little underwhelmed by the flavours... but at this point, I was too full to care.Sorry my review was so long, but I had to be thorough considering I was initially set on hating this place.

/user_details?userid=A7YlcidsiAZzU-tCSsrTSg,Anny T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I've finally tried Montreal Plaza after reading many raving reviews! I was excited because there aren't a lot of fancy options around the area so it was a bit different. It was pretty filled up on a Tuesday night at 7:30pm so I was glad to have called for a table ahead of time. Good: The decor is beautiful, it has an updated modern bistro feel and the room is very lively (a bit loud, we had a pretty noisy table next to us). The service is fantastic, they took the time to explain the menu, although I thought it was a bit unnecessary for the waiters to have to explain the entire menu for first time clients, because I tend to tune out after the first 15 seconds. The plating and creativity is what you would expect at a high end restaurant, and the food was definitely Instagram worthy. To be perfectly honest, I thought the desserts were the best part of the meal. Bad: I really wanted to like this place. I had such high expectations for this restaurant, but unfortunately the food fell flat for me. The first two dishes we had was the tartare with popcorn (which was too salty) and the beets with goat cheese dish (too much cheese). Neither dishes stood out, but the portions were pretty generous. Then we got the fried brussel sprouts and salmon with fried bread. The salmon tasted fresh, but the brussel spouts was a bit tedious to carve and tasted a bit weird. At this point, we were really full, thinking that the four plates were the 4 courses. We were wrong...we had to skip the 3rd course and go straight to desserts, and take the 3rd course to-go (note: one of the plates was a bluefin tuna and my mom said it was really good.)Bottom line: I was pretty underwhelmed so I'm not likely to return, but at least I got to experience it!"

I love how the restaurant was spacious and classy yet casual. It was almost a full night but you never would have noticed from the excellent service you got.Food-wise, we ordered the sea urchin cream with artic char, whelks au gratin, radish cannelloni with pb sauce, hamachi tartare and chicken liver mousse. We loved everything except the cannelloni. Instead of pasta, we got rolls of thinly sliced radish drenched in peanut butter sauce. I thought the dish was very average,  and highly contrasted with the other plates which were extremely well-seasoned and tasty. The whelks really stood out. They were buried under a mountain of crispy panko and garlic herb butter- just what I needed before a week of holiday feasting ;)The menu seems to change often- lots of Yelpers were raving about the brussel sprouts in their reviews but they were already off the menu when I went a few days ago. All the more reason to come back!"

Normally, I would skip this because you can have buttered corn at home. We were blown away. Every dish that followed was just as amazing. And for added whimsy, some of our dishes were played on dinosaurs. Finally, before dessert the team brought out a massive firecracker to celebrate the birthday.

With drinks and dessert you're looking at $100+. I just want to put that right at the top, because if you are thinking, hey let's grab a lovely chill meal at these picnic tables on St Hubert! Then you might have the wrong price point in mind and be shocked. That being said, the food, service and vibe are world class. We sat outside and it was lovely, but I do think I'd prefer to be inside next time, it's such a fun, joyful, classy but high-spirited atmosphere in there, it feels amazing. Plus fewer pigeons.We just went for a couple drinks and bites, on a whim since we were able to get a table outside without a reservation. We shared the stuffed zucchini blossoms (which were like crazy crazy good) and the okonomiyaki and the zucchini with blueberries. The okonomiyaki was made with fresh corn and chanterelles, which were lovely, but the portion was so small and thin I found it disappointing compared with other versions I've had of this usually-heart-warming dish. The zucchini with blueberries were super interesting and playful, tiny sweet zucchini, tart fat berries all hot and in an oil with rock salt - tasty but in a kind of weird way, which I love. I like being surprised by food, especially vegetarian dishes. The cocktails were delicate and perfect, I would love to go back and try every single one. And the service was exceptional. Attentive, friendly, welcoming, personable, and yet managing to give the feeling of a special occasion, up-market experience. Some of the best service I've ever had in Montreal. All in all, we had a magical moment here. But we spent about $50 each and went home still sober and still hungry, so personally I will just keep this place in mind for vurry vurry special events."

We ordered three courses and as we waited for our dishes we were served with bread and butter.The plates were definitely about art and presentation which makes it more fun. The most memorable dish was the broccoli on cob.  The dish was huge but eating it was fulfilling even though it's considered a ""light dish.""They still need to iron out a few kinks since we waited a long time for the last two dishes. They both came out at the same time so it felt rather rushed.  If the dishes were spaced out evenly in between, I felt it would have been a flawless execution.  We'll see what they will have in store in their 6 month and one year mark.  I am looking forward to more innovative surprises at Montreal Plaza"

Every meal was more imaginative and flavourful than the previous one.Dishes I still remember are raw salmon rolled in daikon, a great piece of bone marrow, a really great escargot dish, and the fried Brussel sprouts.Service was great, and the atmosphere was very pleasant. I'm personally a big fan of the eclectic decor and music they played.Price-wise you get a lot of bang for your buck in my opinion. 2 bottles of wine and a lengthy tasting menu for 2 people will always be pricey but it was worth it."
/user_details?userid=_CuIx4Uyw8rjRbASC1TZHA,Wassim E.,"Irvine, CA",2 star rating,"Quite disappointing experience given the hype. I think we expected a lot more of this place. Ordered the tasting menu ($80) and frankly expected a little more. A couple things that were a let down:-Dessert was a little bland and very hard to share. We were a group of 6. It made more sense for a couple to share but not so much for a larger group.-It looks like they forgot to bring us one plate (Brussels sprouts) with main dish (meat assortments). We've noticed it after we had our dessert as all other tables that ordered the tasting menu had it. It's surprising that a restaurant of this caliber would have such a ""faux pas"".-main dish which consisted of multiple meat and fish pieces could have offered slightly enough pieces for each member in the party to try one. For instance, there was small meatballs but it had to be shared. It would make more sense to have a small piece of each meat sample than to have to share those small pieces. It's not like the meat pieces were large.For having done many tasting menus and shareable menus at other reputable restaurants, we've all found this one to be rather disappointing. We all felt like we didn't get our money's worth. It obviously doesn't help when they forgot to bring us one of the plates."

/user_details?userid=_IKbwxa7BhTj8bCflp61XQ,Marie T.,"Westminster, CA",3 star rating,"I was so excited to try out this place with my girlfriends upon our friends recommendation. Apparently, it was the new ""it"" place to go enjoy a nice dinner in montreal nowadays.Our experience was very disappointing for the following reasons. Before I list what went wrong, let me just say that the place is GORGEOUS, SPACIOUS (except for the restrooms) and surprisingly, somewhat ""kids-friendly"" for ""fine dining"".What went wrong:1) SERVICE - friendly staff, BUT lack of attention to detail: our waiter was not very present, when he was present, it felt rushed. The other staff member that presented our dishes pointed fingers too closely to our food, almost touching it. Overall, service could have been better. Missing the finesse that a place like that calls for.2) CULINARY EXPERIENCE - We ordered the tasting menu and a mousse de volaille + foie gras to share. The mousse was delicious!!! Super smooth and delicious. Note - this was extra and was not part of the tasting menu. The tasting menu was disappointing. We thought that it was over seasoned - a tad too salty - and personally, there was too many herbs thrown in each dish for me - lacking the balance and finesse I was expecting from a place with this tenure [ex Toqué chef].  DESSERT - with the tasting menu, we were offered 3 desserts - 3 different variation of sorbet/ice cream. Although it was good (not great), we felt like there was a lack of effort, since it would have been nice to get at least one pastry or something different. 3) THE DETAILS (or lack thereof) - There was a dead mosquito in our water glass. (not cool!) AND there was some weird yellow residue in our wine glass .... 4) THE RESTROOMS - There was a LONG line in the restrooms... because there are only 2 single toilets for the whole restaurant (huge restaurant)! And the restrooms are somewhat mismatched with the rest of the decor - because it was very ""simple"", a bit dirty and missing the ""wow"" factor to be consistent with the rest of the restaurant."

Montreal Plaza is a true representation of passion and love for cuisine, beverage and quality.  The efforts here are intended and truly out shine many that strive to be the same caliber.  Their operation is calculated while feeling refined with a sense of ease and a casual, welcoming vibe.  I also have to mention that the ambiance, fostered by a simple, but classy aesthetic and fine tuned lighting is PERFECT.  I was in love from the moment I walked in the door. I am looking forward to my next Montreal Plaza experience as well as sharing it with others who travel to Montreal."

On a recent visit I found the food very good but the service - I was seated at the bar - somewhat offhand. I had to ask for bread, and the response was a half slice of decent bread plunked on a small plate. Isn't bread a 'standard feature' of good restos? Also the glass of champagne I had was almost lukewarm. Even though it was fairly early, the noise level was already quite high. Not recommended for a quiet or intimate dinner."
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My two friends took me here for my birthday. We each had the tasting menu which was $80/pp and consisted of eight shared plates plus two desserts. Please note that you do not get to pick what dishes you get served but the popular items on the menu do seem to be included. I left the restaurant feeling full and very satisfied. We each had one drink. I had the tequila Caesar. It was smokey and rimmed with steak spice. One friend had a cider and another had the Simon cocktail which was made of bourbon and pear juice with a cute little pear on top. The cocktails were very good. My only complaint was that there was a little too much ice in the cocktails . We started with the cold tomato soup. For starters I don't like cold soup. For me soup has to be warm and there cant be fruit in it!  The soup had chunks of tuna, fruits (blueberries, raspberries) and vegetables (tomato, broccoli, zucchini). It was very pretentious. My friends and I were worried that we made a mistake coming here but after the soup it got a lot better. We had the beef tartare + razor clam, sea urchin + tuna, venison tartare, and the tempura zucchini flowers. The tartares were very good. The tuna tartare had spicy mayo and rice crispies in it with blueberries on the side. The tempura came with a creamy white and green sauce. It was delicious!!! Inside the zucchini flower there was duck!! Then we had the beef done two different ways. One dish consisted of beef cubes cooked medium rare with mushrooms and potatoes and the second was braised beef in a dark sauce with strawberries. We then proceeded to have the whelk gratin with miso butter which resembled escargots in cheese and garlic with bread. The waiter told us to really squeeze out all the lime onto the gratin and so we did but then I found that the lime was a bit overpowering and probably would have been better without it or with very little of it. For dessert we had a deconstructed cake. We were told it was sponge cake but it was more of an angel cake. It was fluffy and sweet. It included three scoops of raspberry sorbet and one scoop of cantaloupe sorbet. My friends loved, loved, loved the cantaloupe sorbet!! Besides the sorbet there was also strawberries, raspberries and blueberries. The second dessert was rhubarb sorbet with shortbread cookies, slices of rhubarb and strawberries. It was our least favorite dessert. It was very bitter. The rhubarb sorbet would have been better served as a palate cleanser rather than as a dessert. Because it was my birthday,  the staff came out with a huge squash and put two sparklers on top. They came out and sang and wished me happy birthday which was  very nice.Overall the restaurant felt very homey. The decor is very old school... dolls, and antique looking furniture. A lot of their dishes had tuna , fruits and fennel in it. Each dish was beautifully presented. I would have given Montreal Plaza five stars had it not been for the cold tomato soup."

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"To enter a restaurant is to enter the mind of the chef, to experience what he or she wished you to experience - and I'm not just talking about the food. The influence of the chef is seen in all aspects of their restaurants - it is the subtle elements of decor, music and atmosphere that make David McMillan and Fred Morin's cool ode to rustic Quebec in Joe Beef work. Same goes for Chuck Hughes and Danny Smiles and the hip coolness of Garde Manger and Bremner or the friendly neighbourhood British pub feel for Derek Dammmann's Maison Publique. There are many examples across Montreal but the key is that the restaurants feel as though they are uniquely from the chefs that run them. We are spoiled in Montreal to have so many wonderful and unique chefs. The challenge is simply to experience all of them!For the occasion of our anniversary, I decided to bring my girlfriend to Plaza St-Hubert of all places to visit a restaurant that seemed to have the right level of finesse with that wonderful unique element that I love so much about Montreal.... in this case, from the mind of Charles-Antoine Crete, Montreal Plaza.Started up by Crete and his partner Cheryl Johnson, Montreal Plaza is Crete's first big project since he left Toque where he was Normand Laprise's right-hand man. The restaurant, designed by Zébulon Perron, is quite the space. Equal combination fancy bistro and family chalet. You are wowed by the white-painted bean-board walls and ceiling, the frosted-glass lighting across the ceiling, the marble bars and the open kitchen but then you are amused by the old grandfather clock, the teddy bear, the upside down doll house and by-plane used on the ceiling fans, the greenhouse and the ""workshop"" space. The bathroom area has one of those light-up nature frames with nature sounds on the ceiling! The space is bemusing but wonderful all the same time. The music the whole night was 90s rap and hip-hop so my girlfriend and I spent the night singing along to Nelly, 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg and R Kelly. I can only imagine how weird that contrast could be some but for a couple of 20-somethings, it was a awesome element to our evening.We must start with the drinks as the beer list had the Anna from Hill Farmstead brewery in Vermont. For those who known about beer, you understand how exciting that was.... and how great of a Honey Ale it was. I'd had been wanting to visit the brewery and try one of their beers for a while now. This was a very pleasant surprise to start our evening. For the rest of you, I encourage you to check them out if ever you have a chance.Foodwise, we decided to start with something neither of us had tried before: sea urchin. In this case, grilled sea urchin served with lardon, green onions and fried shallots within its shell. Beautiful presentation and lovely taste. The urchin was firm at first but then melted in the mouth - rich and creamy sweetness. The addition of the lardon and the shallots added a hint of smokiness as well. A awesome first try at Uni.Our second starter was salmon tartar + crispy - a lovely slightly creamy salmon topped with lettuce and puffed rice as the crunch to the dish. The fish texturally was beautiful and tender. The binder of the tartar provided some richness and a touch of bite to the dish. The use of the rice for some texture was creative and added some crunch.We were feeling adventurous with our mains. Our first was blood sausage and apple - served with a jus de viande, lettuce, onion rings and some fresh cranberries. The sausage was wonderful - rich and savoury. The sweetness of the apple and the tartness of the cranberries paired very nicely. The onion rings were a weird add to the plate but the combination of their sweetness and their crunch made them a surprisingly perfect addition.Our second main was equally as unique in its combinations - sliced deer heart and calamari served with red cabbage, red onion, hay and popcorn. The play between the gamey deer and the fishy tender calamari was pretty interesting although I wished they had been a bit more deer in the plate. The popcorn was another fun play for texture and some sweetness.Once we got to dessert, my girlfriend wasn't that hungry so she only ordered one of their Cannelés. Nice hint of vanilla and rum with a fluffy interior and nice crust on the outside. An excellent pastry. I, on the other hand, went with the glacé aux pommes cake - layers of frozen apple and cake sliced very thinly and served as almost a blooming flower. Beautiful to look at and very tasty as well.Montreal Plaza was a perfect spot for our anniversary dinner and a lovely look into the minds of Chef Crete and his team. Great food, great atmosphere and wonderful service in a unique space. You don't associate Plaza St-Hubert with fine dining but this becomes a worthwhile member of Montreal's best.Cheers!"

I tried a bite of the venison tartare and crispy and the pork skewer - both were good. I ordered the polenta and Saucisson and rib eye beef skewer. The polenta was melt-in-your-mouth delicious with prosciutto and watermelon on top. The beef was fine - presented well, but I preferred the polenta. Really great homemade bread with butter brought to the table as well. For dessert, we tried the special frozen yogurt and the fudge. Both were nice.
