/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Decent food and great service but very pricey. We shared several dishes and I also got the 1st base cocktail. Most of the dishes were pretty good. My personal favorites were the thai sausages, the chicken skewers and the stuffed chicken wings. The beef skewers were a bit overcooked. The mee siam was too sweet. The fermented fish sauce on the beef steak was too fishy for me but one of my friends liked it. The portions are pretty small for the price. In order to be full, you will probably have to spend over 40$ per person with a drink. The service is great. We didn't wait too long for the food as they came one at a time. Our waitress was very nice and friendly. The place itself is nicely decorated and had a good vibe. Although the food was decent, I don't think I would come back. We already tried half of the menu and nothing in it makes us want to go back and eat again."

We were 4 and we decided to Order several dishes and share. We started with the papaya salad which was very tasty. The imperial rolls were amazing. The drum sticks were very tasty and had a great  kick to them The Chicken and beef were very tender. The Mee Siam noodles was also amazing. The special tonight was Shrimp in red curry sauce which was also great. To finish this amazing meal we had friend bananas and Mango sorbet with pink chilli salt . This was a sure hit . We will be back!

Authenticity and leveraging the asian cuisine. If you love your food with that extra kick, with amazing cocktails(My trick is to always request double shot)- THIS restaurant is the money maker right here. Trust my word, wear leggings, feast like no tomorrow and thank me later. Must order: Bone marrow baked with hoisin butter and black pepper sauce garnish with fried garlic and pickled onion and coriander serve with homemade vanilla donut. You'd definitely want this kind of fat in your life."

We came here around 6:30 pm, group of 5. Our waiter was great but the ""your drinks are coming"" got old quickly. I had to cancel my second drink because there was only one bartender for a full house. On top of that, we had to order from another server because we couldn't flag down the waiter.Although, service was made up by offering a dessert on the house (I am glad they did). However, it's pretty simple supply= demand. Get another bartender!"

Not much of decoration but few neon lights makes this place funky.Middle of the week; it was busy and happening here, but sadly there was one waitress taking everyone's orders. Therefore, the service was bit long. Since we had a fantastic group to enjoy this event; we didn't feel that much the long wait.In nutshell, 12 people ordered their own dishes and every single person enjoyed each dish very much. I had a cocktail after very long time; I took litchi Gentleman; my drink showed up on fire. It was a party... we all got excited just watching my drink's fire to go down slowly. It was wonderful drink, not too sweet and not too strong. Perfect... just for me!I had the fried papaya salad, slightly spicy, and it was my favorite dish! It was so good, I could have ordered more. Then I had grilled calamari and mee siam (fried vermicelli with vegetables). Both were absolutely delicious. Then for desert I had fried banana; it was a bit different than what I ever had. It was softer texture and the whip cream was more creamier. It was a wonderful restaurant: everything was delight. Definitely, we will be going back."

My wife and I went to Montreal for our honeymoon. I wasn't craving Cambodian food, but I heard about Les Street Monkeys so I had to visit. Born and raised in Long Beach, I was surrounded by Khmer people and food everyday. Going to Les Street Monkeys felt like home and a typical Cambodian gathering. Everyone was fun, social, and welcoming. The food and drinks were delicious! Tota (owner and head chef) and Les Street Monkeys staff, thank you for the hospitality and wonderful experience! We fell in love with Montreal, so we'll definitely be back to visit Les Street Monkeys!"
/user_details?userid=XbiKsujS_qxU3xsr0xUqmQ,Cin C.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"The atmosphere of this place is a club meets a cocktail bar meets a tappa restaurant. I can see it going from a place to have an intimate relaxed dinner to a bustling energetic bar depending on the clientele of the night. We were here on a Friday late night for dinner and found it mostly empty. There were several tables quietly enjoying their dinner and drinks, so we grabbed a table and did so also.The food are in tasting portions, meant to be shared at the table. Everyone gets maybe a bite-or-two and the dish will be gone. For example, the sausage stuffed chicken wings ($10) comes with only three wings and some pickled veggies on the side. But they are well seasoned, perfectly cooked and shows a lot of thought and preparation. The rest of the dishes are in the same vein. Small dishes, pricey for the portion, but well executed. I think we ordered around 7-8 dishes for 4 people and we were not hungry but definitely not feeling full by the end of the night. Extra star for making a great unique cocktail that packs a punch! Check the drinks menu for specials."

The restaurant isn't too big, dim lights with some neon lighted decor and very loud music. It's an open concept so you can watch your food being cooked at the bar. The food was absolutely delicious!! Very few restaurants know how to season a fish well and here it was amazing!! I had the fish over salsa. I also ordered the fried papaya salad which was just as good! Honestly we were all salivating. I asked for spicy and my mouth was on fire! I also ordered their ginger mocktail, really good! However I wouldn't order it with a spicy meal lol As for dessert I had sesame doughnut which I didn't like as much. My friends had a banana dessert which I preferred. I found the music too loud which made it hard to converse with the people around the table. The restaurant was packed and it seemed like there was only 1 waitress taking the orders. I have some food allergies which I informed them of. What I really appreciated is they took that into serious consideration. I was the last person to receive my salad. When asked the waitress why, she said the cooks wanted to make the other salads first, clean the dishes and then make mines. I would definitely go back here!"
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This spot has been in my radar for a while seeing that I always enjoy tapas style restaurants that offer  you the chance to sample many dishes. I organized a Meetup dinner for a group of 12 where we'd get a fixed menu at a fixed price and chef's choice on the items. From the moment I called in for the reservation, the staff was exceptionally accommodating and polite, ensuring me this would be a great experience, and it indeed it was! We were served an abundance of food, 11 total, to share amongst our group and not one dish wasn't a complete pleasure! We sampled the ceviche, eggplant salad, papaya salad, imperial rolls, marinated beef, chicken skewers, mushroom dip, Thai sausage, curried fish, fried vermicelli, and lamb chop; everything was plain outstanding! All the dishes were well prepared and nicely seasoned; heavy on lemongrass, fish sauce, chilli and basil, representative of Cambodian street food as our waitress who happened to be Cambodian assured us, the dishes were just plain delicious! I also got to taste some of their cocktails, including the Pimm's Juice and Tota Margarita. The Pimm's cocktail was light and palatable. The margarita, with crushed grasshopper and red worm, was interesting but I found it too smoky for my taste. The service, from start to finish, was great; our dishes, served over three servings, came out of the kitchen at the same time and the staff took time to explain our dishes, much to the delight of the group. The venue, with its graffiti wall, light wood tables and black chairs, including the long bar with ample seating and open kitchen, was slick, modern with an industrial vibe. Although we've heard the venue can get loud, we were all able to carry a conversation even though seated under a speaker, and the place was full on a Friday night. I highly recommend this spot for its amazing and tasty food, great service and awesome vibe. Definitely going back asap!"

I started with a saffron infused iced milk coffee, which they serve in a pouch. Loved the taste as the spice wasn't overpowering but still there for colour and flavour. Our table got the Cambodian sausage plate with fried egg, the crepes with pork, the pork belly soup in its savoury rich broth and nems. The portions of the plates are good, and the flavours are great (consistent with the evening vibe)."

/user_details?userid=tRG6XJuf3lVeWzd4NUWbdg,Bear K.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Atmosphere: - Nice decor- Lively environment- Can get overcrowded at busier timesFood:- eggplant salad: (cold salad), topped with deep fried onion straws which was nice mixed into the salad. - Raw beef dish: Beef came warm which was nice, the dish itself was rather simple and wasn't the highlight of the meal.- Amok fish dish: this was our favourite, the fish comes very lightly breaded with a delicious coconut curry and had toasted coconut shavings for added flavour. Highly recommend this one.- Stuffed chicken wings: flavourful with a ginger kick, another dish that we would recommend. - Grilled squid: this was our least favourite; the squid lacked marinate/sauce and was over cooked. We could have done without it. - Recommendations: 2 dishes per person should be enough food. Drinks:- a little expensive. ""Second base"" drink was good, nice presentation. - Dr kong drink was interesting (tequila, pineapple) what made this drink unique was its spice. Although a unique flavour, It's something to get used to.Service:- excellent service - The whole staff is friendly and knowledgeable of the food- Our waiter was very pleasant"
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We have reached July which means we have reached time to celebrate my birthday. As I have gotten older, I have gone away from a party to celebrate. I prefer just a nice dinner with friends either home or at the restaurant. The challenge, as always, is to find somewhere that works for a group - where we can easily share and where the cost to my friends is reasonable. I hate forcing my friends to splurge at my expense. Well, for this year, I decided to stay close to home in Verdun to try our hand at some Cambodian cuisine at Les Street Monkeys. The menu is described as Cambodian-style street food. The portions are small and designed to share. The menu is mostly Cambodian but they do venture in cuisine from other south-east Asian countries. As a party of 5, we decided to grab a bunch of stuff to try. First up, we ordered their pork and taro fried imperial rolls. Solid rolls - a nice crunch on the outside. Inside, the filling was plentiful and very flavourful.Next, we had the shrimp ceviche marinated in a lime, fish sauce and wasabi dressing. The waiter warned us the dish was quite strong in wasabi and wow was it ever! It hits you right in the nose once you take your first bite. If you can handle the heat, the dish is excellent. The shrimp is very tender and the addition of the radishes and the scallions provided some lightness and crunch. We couldn't say no to a traditional papaya salad but sadly it wasn't a big hit. Texture was nice and had tons of sweetness and acidity but it lacked some punch in terms of the heat. Most of us agreed that Satay Brothers' version is better.Our next dish faired better. The Khmer style fried chicken drums - fried chicken with a shrimp paste, kaffir lime leaf, lemongrass and garlic sauce - were excellent. Great crunch but the chicken remained moist and tender inside. The sauce stuck nicely on the drumsticks and provided a nice garlicky punch.The positives continued with the eggplant salad - grilled eggplant tossed with a dressing made of lime, fish sauce, rice powder, dried chili, mint, Thai basil and cilantro. The eggplant was nice and soft and the dressing was super flavourful - packing a punch both umami and sweet. Everyone really enjoyed this one.The Mee Siam - fried rice vermicelli with a soya and crab paste sauce mixed with red peppers, chives, onions and bean sprouts - was solid and a nice compliment side dish to the rest. The fried rice had a nice little crunch to it that you want.I am a big fan of bone marrow so when I saw the Phnom Penh bone marrow dish, I had to order it. Bone marrow with butter, hoisin sauce, kampot pepper, fried garlic, marinated onion and coriander leaves served with bone broth and vanilla Chinese fried bread. Nice flavour again to the dish - a good balance of sweetness and heat. The vanilla bread was surprising as well for now well it fit with the bone marrow. The only negative was the lack of much marrow on the bones - would have loved to see more there portion wise.The biggest hit of the night was the Amok fish - lightly breaded cod with a red curry sauce with coconut milk, red peppers and fried taro strings. The fish was super flaky and tender and that sauce was excellent. Tons of flavour to pair with the fish. The dish lasted all of a few minutes on the table.Our final plate was the stuffed chicken wings - boneless wings stuffed with thai sausage and brushed with turmeric, kaffir lime leaves and lemongrass sauce. The sausage stuffing had some heat and stayed tender within the chicken wing. The lemongrass sauce brought some acidity which paired well here. Excellent dish.Les Street Monkeys was the perfect spot for a group dinner. Everything was easy to share, very flavourful across the board and very reasonably priced. Food-wise, it cost us about 35$ each to cover everything we ate. That is a great deal for the quality of food we got. Cambodian-style cuisine is not something that is present readily in Montreal but I am happy we got to try it and that it is so close to my place if a craving ever hits!Cheers!"

When our party of five showed up a little bit earlier we were immediately accommodated at out table and given full attention. Food is delicious, we are in love with the fried cod with red curry and the shrimp ceviche with wasabi. Don't get me wrong, actually everything else is delicious, including the cocktails. The IPA mixes with fruit we tried are very refreshing. Outstanding service, our hosts took the time to address every question we had. Location wise this restaurant is great, close to my house, few blocks from metro station and parking is very easy.  Must try!"

Their cocktail menu is impressive and I really enjoyed the presentation of the drinks! Their dishes are small but they can fill you up easily if you order the sticky rice to compliment the yummy dishes! Some dishes are a bit spicy so if you can't take heat, ask for less spice! I highly recommend the Amok Fish and Beef Laab. The ambience is really dope and the interior decors make the place feel chill. The servers and bartenders are nice and there is an open kitchen for you to see how they prepare the food. Seems like a great place to hang out with friends or enjoy a fabulous meal with someone special."

The chive pancakes were delicious, as were the various soups and platters my dining companions ordered. They also have creative desserts, cocktails and smoothies, and delicious daily specials.

Definitely worth the trip to lovely and lively Verdun to try this place out, especially if you appreciate great-quality, authentic food that is unique to this restaurant. Service can be less than speedy, but that is because there is only one cook, and he absolutely rocks, taking care to devote his attention to every detail of every single dish.

/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Wow. Now, this was a treat.Arriving at Les Street Monkeys on a quiet-ish Sunday evening in Verdun, I was pleased to find a tastefully-designed and sizeable space and a decent amount of people dining, but not so many that we needed a reservation. Throughout the course of the evening, we sampled the majority of the menu and were thoroughly impressed with presentation, taste, and in general, the uniqueness of the plates.The only dishes that were lost on me were the papaya salad (I'll be honest and say I'm thoroughly spoiled by living so close to Satay Bros and their famous papaya salad) and the fried chicken. While the fried chicken was still pretty delicious, the seasoning was a little too much of a punch to the face for my sensitive white girl sensibilities. Other folks at the table were pretty jazzed with it, however.Above all, I have to say the service was absolutely top-notch. Our server was attentive, gregarious and seemingly an all-around good guy. He made for the kind of dining experience where I felt bad he wasn't sitting down for dinner with us."
/user_details?userid=IMbTPsOTTY5xs5VhHSm4mA,Louis G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"As a Verdunois born and raised, it is such a pleasure to see a restaurant such as Les Street Monkeys open on Wellington. The perfect place to go and to share dishes and discover Cambodian cuisine. It should be noted that the restaurant does accept reservations and in fact recommends them, as it gets quite busy.DECOR:The restaurant replaces an graffiti-ridden empty space on the edge of the commercial part of Wellington with a mix of urban street elements, industrial decor and clean elements. A long wooden bar runs along the somewhat narrow space from the entrance through the bar to the open kitchen. A pipe and lightbulb chandelier and light strips integrated to the ceiling and a decently sized front window give the space a good amount of light, and  illuminate the mural that runs along the wall across from the bar. The atmosphere is lively as there are no empty seats in this restaurant; the music is at a reasonable level. SERVICE:The service at the restaurant was excellent, with a small hang up in service (which is to be expected in any new restaurant) was quickly corrected. The dishes we ordered were brought out at a good pace. DRINKS:We ordered 2 drinks, their twist on a Moscow Mule called ""Je Kampote"", and ""Le Vieux Verdun"", a cognac cocktail based on an Old Fashioned. Both were well-made, delicious and of generous size. Though their signature cocktails are probably what most people will go for, they have a decent wine and beer offering, as well as a fully-stocked bar.FOOD:On recommendation of our waitress, we got 5 dishes to share for 2 people: the papaya salad, the pan-seared trout with tomato salsa, the wasabi shrimp ceviche, sachko tuk prahok (rare beef slices in a fermented fish sauce) and grilled squid. All the dishes were excellent, well-balanced, with the strong flavours of fish sauce, lime, garlic and lemongrass perfectly balanced. The stand-out dish was by far the pan-seated trout, which was one of the most flavourful pieces of fish I've ever had. For dessert, we shared the dessert of the day (only dessert option), warm sticky rice in a coconut lemongrass sauce, with toasted coconut flakes and mango. OVERALL: at 95$ +tip for 2 people with 2 drinks and dessert, this restaurant is a must-try!"

We shared a few plates and sat at the bar.The portions are small and it's pricy for what you get. Some plates were a hit and others were a miss.We had the fried imperial rolls with pork and taro which were good. My favourite dish was the beef skewers. I also enjoyed the chicken wings stuffed with Thai sausages. We also had the fish amok. It was thin slices of battered cod in a red Thai curry sauce. It was tasty but very small. I wish the plate had been bigger. My least favorite dish was the papaya salad. Usually we like to eat papaya salad but this one had way too much fish sauce and tasted as if there were pieces of dried fish in it. We both couldn't eat it. It was such a waste. The drinks were interesting. I started with the Je Compote. It is made up of gin, sake, ginger, lime and Thai basil. The ginger was very overpowering  but I didn't mind it. If you don't like ginger don't order it. I also had the Mary Khmao which is their version of a Bloody Caesar . It contains Belvedere vodka, fish sauce, homemade squid ink, Worcestershire, hot sauce, tomato juice and Clamato and rimmed with steal spice. I think this place has potential if they make their portions bigger and if they fix their papaya salad to make it less fishy. I will not be back."

My opinion is that satay brother is better overall for their food, much more variety compared to street monkeys.I've been there twice, and honestly don't think I'll be back for a third time.

We saw Cambodian on Yelp nearby and decided to check Les Street Monkeys out. It was pretty loud and rowdy when we got in, but that's understandable as it was a late Saturday night. Although I prefer quieter places, I loved the vibe of the place. Very urban and lively. We ordered 4 dishes and a drink to share. Every dish was amazing and very flavourful. It was just the two of us, but I think it'd be better with a larger group so you can diversify and try all of their tapas-like dishes. The drink menu was also very intriguing. Service was amazing! They were very informative and told us everythign we needed to know about their menu. One of the dishes were given to another table by accident, but the server let us know right away and gave us shots on the house for the inconvenience. Definitely would come back and try the rest of their menu."

The chicken drums were good, a bit sweet, but I would have preferred them to be a bit more crunchy. The mee siam was underwhelming. A bit too sweet and I didn't like the texture. The wasabi shrimps were really good, even though the wasabi really hits you. We also had the sticky rice with mango, I believe it is a must!When you go, don't forget to look at their daily specials!"

The location is off the grid in an up-and-coming neighbourhood. The decor is set with a trendy vibe. There is a long bar and several tables for dining. Make reservations if you can it does get pretty busy. We started off with some cocktails and ordered everything from the menu appetisers and entrees. The portions are quite small so be sure to order enough for your group. And definitely ask for the side of sticky rice.

Went on a sunday evening with friends to give it a try: place is well decorated, nice vibe. In my opinion they have too many employees doing nothing except standing there talking to each other, checking their phone and even giving each other shoulder massages (sigh)    The food: if you're really hungry or eat a lot expect to spend at least 40-50$ a person because the portions are incredibly small. We had eggrolls, papaya salad, beef and chicken skewers and fish amok. I notice that we had only 3 eggrolls instead of 4 i don't know why, ( i saw pictures of people having 4) but thats not my case. They were good for 2$ each egg rolls, nothing famous. Skewers 9$ for the plate, so 3$ each skewers; they taste good a bit dry overdone on the beef ones, the chicken tasted better, but still nothing famous. Papaya salad was a nice portion and tasty well balanced, they let you decide how spicy you want it. Fish amok was by far the best meal to me. Coconut creamy flavours, thin fried taro chips, it was a nice portion. I could eat 3 of those if they weren't 14$ the plate.Overall: Disappointed, I don't think I'm going back if they stay the same. I feel like most people who went for the first time share the same opinion or else the place would be more crowded. It's also the kind of place where they act very friendly and all only with people they know  ( i saw free drinks given at the table next to us). This place is still promising but if they don't change a thing about their menu and the way they treat every customers,they won't come back unless they're friends. The concept of the restaurant is very original and could be the top place of Montreal everynight, but there's something wrong with the way they handle the restaurant business. Time will tell in a year or two if they still on the map.John Keller"

Great cocktails, fast service and the food was amazing! Notably the cod with red curry, lemongrass chicken skewers and fried papaya salad! We sat in front of the kitchen, and given what we saw, I would try everything on the menu! Reasonable prices and good music as well. We will definitely be back!"

Their poor stew was incredible, stuffed chicken wings, fried vermexelli salad was beyond belief. Everything we we had was amazing if you like Thai and Vietnamese this place is for you. Not to mention the staff were super friendly and really seemed like they wanted to make sure you enjoyed your time. I could swear they each owned a stake since they clearly cared so much. Cool ambiance and great music and the food came out fast and hot. Make a reso since they were packed even on a -30 night."

/user_details?userid=L_DhUhGi3V5rdKQRbd1p6g,Bianca E.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try this restaurant for a few weeks and finally, on our third attempt at a reservation we got a table at 7PM on a Wednesday. I have to say... this place is wonderful! The staff is very inviting and answer any questions you have about the food, even giving us a chance to talk to the chef. He even let us know the methods to some of the recipes! I had two drinks, the Mary Khmao and the Je Kampote. The first was a very strong and came with a piece of calamari as a garnish, which was really cool. It was a little strong for me so I let my boyfriend have it and ordered the Je Kampote which was very refreshing and different... would order again. I found the drinks a little expensive but delicious nonetheless. The food was phenomenal. My favourites were the fried papaya salad, a special of the day and the wasabi shrimp ceviche. If you can't handle spice, don't order it! The spring rolls and eggplant salad were amazing, as well as the red curry fish. The only one we weren't fond of was the beef dish with fermented fish sauce.The service was amazing and very accommodating. Thumbs up for our waitress, we didn't get her name but she made the experience that much better. Will definitely return!"
/user_details?userid=mHW8RaOu3BCw8YMTnLKcVA,Steve K.,"Hudson, Canada",5 star rating,"I want to say this place is awful so it doesn't get to popular but it is the total opposite..... great tasting food and maybe some of the best service around these days!Starting with the food, must try the trout and the shrimp.... excellent! The service is way beyond good, everybody, even if they aren't your server ,waits on you including the chef/ owner.The atmosphere is new, young, can be a little loud but worth it ,as the food is excellent and very reasonably priced . Put this together with servers who are proud of their restaurant and happy when a customer is happy ( a rarity these days in the Montreal resto scene of pretentious chefs) this is a must try place and has become our favourite."
/user_details?userid=3d5u2LsMg7kiQGqWXCl63g,Denis B.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"It is absolutely fabulous in all respects- great food and drinks, fun decor, wonderful service and a super vibe all around. I have travelled throughout Asia, including Cambodia. I love everything on the menu at Street Monkeys  especially, the shrimp ceviche and the trout with tomato salsa. They also serve the best fried banana desert I have ever eaten. At most places the dough is thick but here it is light, barely there. The bonus is that they are close to the Lasalle Metro station so no need for a car."
