/user_details?userid=Xxg4YL81jUooeWbTflCFxw,Brigette C.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Food: The menu is limited but has an excellent Korean and Japanese choices given it is an ""express"" restaurant. I ordered Chicken Katsu and I was given a small beeper, it buzzes and flashes a red light when your order is on the counter ready for pick up.  They prepare their food fresh and the portions was generous to my surprise. You can even watch them prepare your food. The Chicken Katsu is moist and the breading gives that sweet crunch sound with every bite.Value: The Chicken Katsu is 11.55 and I can say that it's worth every penny. The freshness and the huge portion is just right with the price.Service: The cashier assigned when I went there spoke little English but she was able to assist me just fine. Ambiance: I often pass by this quaint little store which is about three blocks from my place and decided to give it a try. Outside (during the summer), there are a number of seats outside while inside the restaurant; there is a bar by the window which seats about 6 people, two tables on the side for two persons each and a long table in the middle for at least twelve people. It seemed a little bit cramped up but manageable.Overall: I will definitely go back to try other food on the menu. Might even get my lunch there today."

I got my chance today at lunch time and it was busy on that day! I think a lot of people caught on without Yelp raving about it.  This place served a mixture of Japanese and Korean dishes by Koreans. The cashier can speak a little French and English, the service can be a bit slow at time especially during lunch time. They provide a piece of beeper, it flashes when it is your time to be served. I got the poke bowl and it is so good and so fresh! I saw how it was made and yes, they don't put all their ingredients on their counter. They cut it one at a time, so it will be fresh when you get it. Nonethless, this little hidden place is a hit in the neighborhood. They caught on before the Yelp community."

/user_details?userid=2e28JJz9pZ-Ha45sXc78dA,Gabriela P.,"Saint-Hubert, Longueuil, Canada",5 star rating,I went in randomly but loved the concept of it. The staff was nice I liked that they gave a key that flashed once my food was ready and the food giving the price was amazing ! My poke bowl wich had a variety of quality ingredients came with taxes included to 14 $ wich is more affordable then a lot of other poke places with way less quality sides . Will definitely go back if in the area !

They serve what might be the best pork katsu I've had in Montreal, with juicy meat in a crisp and surprisingly light crust. My colleagues had other dishes and everyone was happy with their meal."

The decoration is cute and services are friendly. Its honestly better than what I expected. Options are a bit limited, however, it is an express and if you're just craving for some fresh korean and japanese comfort foods then you won't be disappointed. All this for a very affordable price. Must try!"
