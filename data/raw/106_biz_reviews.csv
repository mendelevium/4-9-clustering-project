/user_details?userid=HNLqssXZrbxMtW-_4b1M8Q,Shane B.,"El Paso, TX",5 star rating,Delicious burrata and truffle pizza and excellent beer list.Went with co-workers and all enjoyed and would come back.Service was friendly and enjoyable - fun area to walk and grab a bite to eat!!Prices seemed elevated but so do most in Montreal.
/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"3.5 starsI came here to eat on the terrasse on a weekday. They currently have a promotion going on (happening gourmand) for an entree and main for 25$. The choices are pretty limited, 3 options for each course. From what I remember, the happening gourmand deal used to offer dessert as well so that was a bit disappointing.We ate outside and I am pleased to say that they provided adequate distance between tables. However, our waitress was only wearing a face shield and not a mask. This is my main reason for giving a 3.5 star instead of a 4 because I think waitstaff should definitely be wearing masks, especially at a touristy place in the old port. I got the arancini as an entree with a meat sauce and cheese. Delicious!!! For my main, I got a cheese pizza and was also impressed with the flavour. They give you a little bowl of chilies in oil on the side which is much classier than the chili flakes you might get elsewhere. Overall, the happening gourmand deal isn't as good as it used to be but the food is of high quality and the location is excellent, right in the heart of old Montreal. I would love to come back but am hoping the waitstaff are wearing their masks properly next time."
/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"What a great surprise!!! Wifey and I were looking to grab lunch on a shaded patio today. I knew the places on rue Saint Vincent would be in the shade so we decided to swing by BEVO today for the first time. It certainly won't be our last!The menu was packed with Italian staples with a focus on pizza and fresh pasta. Barb went with the Caprese salad and I tried the spicy pepperoni pizza. Both dishes were excellent, very fresh and classic examples. The waiter suggested hot peppers in the side, which I used sparingly but quickly discovered drizzling some of the spicy olive oil on the pizza made for a nice upgrade. The pizza was loaded with ingredients and I was a fan at first bite.Service was excellent with both the hostess and the waiter being very friendly and helpful. Total tab with tax and tip was about $70 which represents a very good value in my book."
/user_details?userid=Cii6oPxzWa0WfVtHiXfCCQ,Ken J.,"Livonia, MI",4 star rating,"It's towards the end of summer in Montreal.   People are grasping how much the warm weather is still lingering around.   When we approached, we saw that the patio was open, and there were numbers of people still seated out there.   Our group of 6 took to the patio after being seated by the hostess.  From there it was all down hill.   They had one server working the entire patio, which apparently spurred a number of people coming to the place shortly after we did.   The patio was shortly full of patrons.  We had an extremely long wait time for our drinks, food, bill... and everything in between.   I would have hoped that the restaurant would have noticed that the patio was where most of the people were, and sent another server to help take care of the traffic.   I hope that this was a one time thing, and that is why I don't like trying to leave a review on a place that I've been to once.   It could have been a small isolated incident... but it's the one time that leaves the biggest impression on myself.  Once we did get the food, it was good.   Atmosphere was great... like I said, there were a number of people still trying to hold onto what summer had left."
/user_details?userid=oR5az_eNCnfN7e49H3ONhg,Rebecca H.,"Worcester, MA",4 star rating,"Of all of the seemingly popular w/ outdoor seating places in Montreal, this one appeared to have some of the best reviews on yelp. Normally good food and tourist trap don't socialize in the same sentence however in this case, they are very intimate. The line outside indicated that there was going to be a wait. We decided to leave our name and go grab a drink or two somewhere else to kill time. Surprisingly, they did have a table for two available, just not outside. This was a Friday night at around 8pm. We wanted to cleanse our palate with some Montreal concoctions prior to dinner so we left and returned about an hour later. Unfortunately we were FORCED to order olives which also came with a delicious creamy dip and warm pita bread along with our drinks at cleanse-our-palate place. Under normal circumstances, we order appetizers to accompany our entrees but this olive plate precluded our plans. We're sharing bitches so, in a place such as BEVO, a pizza/pasta combo hits all of the spots we're aiming for. We ordered the caprese pizza with mozzarella, fresh tomatoes, basil, and olives (we're sluts for olives on pizza, mmmm). The tortelloni con ricotta and spinach (I can just hear the italian accent in my head as I type this) looked BOMB: tortellini stuffed with ricotta and spinach in a creamy pesto sauce. Not shockingly, they actually ran out of the tortellini but offered to give us any other pasta type in the pesto sauce. We chose fettuccini. We tackled the pizza first. It was delicious. The crust was perfection. The bread was soft and thin. The cheese and tomatoes with sprinkled herbs and olives provided a flavorful and refreshing waltz on my tongue. The fettuccini was a whole other story. The pesto was SPECTACULAR. It was the perfect combination of pesto and cream. The noodles were al dente with a nice bite and engulfed in a delectable and delicious sauce that allowed the herb-y essence to shine through. I'm drooling over the thought.This place was awesome. One of the servers gave me attitude when I asked for the check despite our table not being one of hers. More prompt service would make this place even better but regardless, it's definitely worth a trip."
/user_details?userid=FJL0x-PVW9u6WGE1iZe3Bg,Ravi C.,"Jersey City, NJ",2 star rating,The place looks cool from the outside.  Neat little seating in a small street in Old Montreal.  It had a lot of reviews on yelp so we decided to give it a try.The food was good.  The 2 stars is because of the service and the time it took for out food.We ordered promptly and waited.  We understand that certain meals take long than others so we requested part of our meal early.  That part never showed up.  Our meal showed up 1 hour after we ordered at a time when few people were in the restaurant (other patrons who sat down 30 min after us were already eating). The waitress did not acknowledge any of the things missing or even offer to fu with us during our meal.  This experience was unfortunate because the place is seemed to overall pretty good and probably would have warranted at least 3 stars.
/user_details?userid=_YyQF6B2vJqYf1FnCyXv9A,Emile L.,"Edgewater, NJ",4 star rating,Pizza here is really good. Comparable to John's on Bleecker street. Wood fired pizza. The pasta was also very good and reasobly priced. The interior is also very interesting as it is located inside of an old Montreal building.
/user_details?userid=JaVb-a7VzHKV-vtaft-u9A,Stella W.,"Tucson, AZ",5 star rating,"The whole experience at this restaurant was phenomenal. The ambience, the food, and the service were all top notch. They have a massive stone pizza oven in the back, so the pizza was really well cooked. Inside is nice and air conditioned. The waiter was very kind and helped us order, as we don't speak any French. The pizza was very cheesy-- they did not skimp on anything. If you are looking for a delicious lunch or a romantic dinner, this place is perfect."
/user_details?userid=gPzSsjn4oFXS5uW4MyjLZA,Lauren F.,"Providence, RI",3 star rating,"This place was okay. The drinks were decent and the service was good. The pizza was filling but the crust was very soft- tasty but not easy to eat after it sat for more than five minutes, as the toppings kind of soaked in and it got a little bit soggy in the middle. We were starving and I'd definitely had worse so it did the job. It is open late on weeknights and is in a gorgeous area, and was reasonably priced. We got a nice window table and the view was lovely."
/user_details?userid=BjeyTXxk61rAdWyHiLHg9w,Sehrish N.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Service was great! The staff is so nice and I mean everyone. There are2 floors and a bar area. I've been here twice and both times I sat on the main floor. They have the cutest napkins. Both times I had the truffle pizza which I thoroughly enjoyed, arancino (deep fried risotto ball) but with no meat and a marinara sauce. For dessert I had a Nutella pizza all of this with a berry mint virgin mojito. The resto is in old port, you have to walk around to find it in the side streets but totally worth it. Only downside was the construction in the area, parking is extremely difficult in that area and music was just too loud. Initially the hostess was forcing us to sit at the bar. We repeatedly explained we don't drink alcohol so we'd like to sit in the main area, she was waiting for someone's approval but eventually we got to sit on the opposite side."
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One more restaurant for the event of Happening Gourmand! This is my 3rd time at Bevo! I still love this place! Beautiful brick walls; medieval chandeliers; vibrant atmosphere, and great music choices for the background.Excellent service. Our server was enthusiastic, funny and helpful. He has excellent choices of recommendations. The food was unbelievably amazing. Started with a glass of white Pinot Grigio (my favorite). My calamari was perfect due to excellent spicy marinara sauce. Bosco in Blanco is my favorite pizza due to sliced truffle. My desert was tiramisu; it was really too sweet for my taste but thankfully it was a small one. I always enjoy this place... can't wait for next time!"
/user_details?userid=VtUOooYJwI6ZEm9PnzoZ7Q,Dave B.,"Beacon, NY",4 star rating,"Wound up here for a few drinks and a casual dinner, and came away very pleased. Just some fried calamari and a couple of pizzas, but everything was dead on point and no qualms at all about recommending the place. Yeah you're in the middle of the tourist area, but tucked away a bit. A great stop in the early evening. Attentive servers, good food, terrific location."
/user_details?userid=fw7GQ34xVS3cZpuV5UmMFA,Irene D.,"Deux-Montagnes, Canada",4 star rating,Last time I was here was six years ago and I remember the service being horrible.My experience this time around was not the same.Our waiter was very friendly and on the ball. He was absolutely wonderful.The calamari was really good and the rest of the things we ordered were good.The atmosphere and the music was fantastic and I would recommend it here if you're in a big group or simply looking for a fun evening.
/user_details?userid=SuSi8Rh1SdVKHFNkLbfgyg,Ronald T.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5 star rating,"Came here after going to a local rooftop bar with my girlfriend, and the pizza was really really good! I think our views on the pizza was a little skewed because we were extremely hungry, but nonetheless I would recommend the pizza here. We're actually from New York so we've been exposed to arguably the best pizza, and this pizza did us right. We didn't explore the inside because we decided to sit outside. It was also like 1AM so we couldn't see how this spot would look like during very active hours. However, the service was great, the food was great, and I highly recommend it! Especially if you're looking for a late night option in Montreal"
/user_details?userid=GlEhxPlaofxOOvcf-5guvw,Cindy D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I love wood-fired pizzas, so when I finally took the time to visit Bevo, I had to try one of theirs, I ordered the Bosco in Bianco which is composed of roasted mushrooms, mozzarella and black truffles with a pitcher of sangria.We were seated on the terrace, but let's say that sangria and fine weather brings not so friendly wasp so we had to ask to be seated inside. The waitress gave us excellent service and even offered us a cocktail of her own creation, which was very very good."
/user_details?userid=xsq3s4YK_ACt_aSjWoKH8w,Mack M.,"Swartz Creek, MI",5 star rating,This place has quite good pizza.  Great location in old Montreal.  Our server was very good and kept our beverages topped off. The Nutella dessert pizza was off the hook. Everyone loved that one. Plates were clean when we left!  Highly recommend.
/user_details?userid=RcpiJkkiT5_9UqXz_O1QqA,Konstantina P.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Bevo is an Italian restaurant in the old port of Montreal serving an variety of Italian dishes like pasta and some creative dishes like veal poutine. But most like I, would come here for the wood oven pizza! We shared three different pizzas amongst the group and all agreed, that the crust was perfectly thin and chewy, and the toppings were perfection! We all raved about the Parma in Bianco; this pizza was topped with prosciutto, roquette and parmesan cheese and although it was simple, was flavourful and savoury, perfectly balanced with the sauce. The venue itself is nice and informal, with stone walls and an industrial decor, and highly popular with the tourists. It can get a little loud due to DJs playing music later at night, but the friendly service and good cocktails would soon make you forget the noise."
/user_details?userid=KFsbACIHXQxyff_W6CN1LA,Karen H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Walking in Old Montreal can build up a good appetite. I am a lover of Pizza and always looking for new place to try out. The ambiance here is trendy. I was impressed by the attention we received from the staff which gives the ratings a boost. I started out with the wedding soup which I'm a big fan of, and is one of the best I've had. I ordered the salami pizza. My side dish was the arugula salad topped with Parmesan shavings with balsamic dressing. Both dishes were delightful and tasty. Spicy oil with peppers is a complimentary choice. The space is quite large with two floors. A side bar with a great vibe if dropping in for drinks only. A open space where the pizza man is standing next to the wood burning stove for your eyes. I always enjoy playing the role of a tourist when coming to Old Montreal even thou I live here. Always a pleasure! A definite return for me and this pizzeria!"
/user_details?userid=qHouXe4vskJfljxziw3Oug,Upasna D.,"Bellevue, WA",4 star rating,We went at around 9:00 pm and were given a table immediately. They have good vegetarian options. We ordered ricotta and spinach tortellini and margarita pizza. Both the dishes were delicious. We felt the tortellini quantity was less as compared to other places I have been to.

The terasse was beautiful for a September evening. We ordered a pitcher of white Sangria**** that had a pineapple juice base (doo different and refreshing) ; for the main course I had bosco in Bianco pizza**** (black truffle, mushrooms and mozzarella) garnished with Parmesan -my stomach screamed Bellisimo! The service was impeccable - thank you Kayla!!! Looking forward to coming back!"

I've been looking for an authentic style Margherita pizza for the past few years, all the way from Toronto, and can I tell you I've finally found it?!The ambiance of the restaurant is nice, on the darker side, however it gives it that upscale touch. Server was on point as well!We'll definitely be returning soon."
/user_details?userid=RwQUv7Cn61gTkPXcytSrSQ,Amy Yu T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I would come here more for the ambiance and the accessibility than the food. It's located in Old Montreal and they take reservations (based on my last visit). The food is okay, the pizza I had was quite bland compared to other Italian restaurants, but it's a great place to grab drinks. We also ordered entrées that was pricey and tasted average. Just because of the ambiance and decor of the restaurant, I would give this place a 3.5."
/user_details?userid=tgb-mmxGynwZ_Nec7StKTw,Emily M.,"Strathroy, Canada",5 star rating,"This is one of the best meals I have eaten in Montreal and completely worth the wait! The atmosphere feels European as the restaurant sits in a narrow cobble stone street with a great patio. And the best part, the food. My family and I ordered a small antipasto platter and a caprese pizza. With a delicious thin crust, beautiful cheese and tasty olive oil, I highly recommend this place!"
/user_details?userid=EpAiAAZFpahoQroXhFaVbA,Zuly V.,"Costa Mesa, CA",1 star rating,"We had just arrived in town and were hungry and exhausted from our road trip. BEVO Bar + Pizzeria was conveniently located down the street from our hotel we thought it would be a great start to our stay in Montreal to check out a local restaurant vs. hotel food. Our party consisted of 6 people and we were seated immediately upstairs (no wait? yay!). It wasn't a busy night, but somehow it took our server 15-20 min to take our drink order. When he returned with our drinks we had to wait another hour or so to place our order - ordered several appetizers, 3 salads and 4 pizzas. When we received our pizza some were COLD... I assume they were ready for a while, but no one to bring them to us. Overall our food was okay nothing out of the norm - I would have returned though minus the horrible service and in-laws cold pizzas. Our server was taking shots with the table next to us, most of the party had circus soleil attire - assuming they worked for the circus. I don't know if it's customary to drink on the job here and honestly I don't care, but attend to paying customers. Done with our food, drinks and water cups on empty we waited for well over 30 minutes to get our check. Our server was gone, I proceeded downstairs to waive someone and I see our server hanging out in the bar. REALLY?!?! At this point I ask for the manager and request my bill. Manager gives me the bill and it read over $2,300.00!!!! Canadian currency or not that was a HUGE mistake! If I hadn't noticed he would have swiped my card. I immediately had him fix the issue and he profusely apologized. Overall food was nothing out of the ordinary to have to put up with an intoxicated server and lack of customer service. Literally we lost 3.5 hours of our time!"
/user_details?userid=794_lJawWPtLMBLN7X0qZA,Mariam A.,"Bayonne, NJ",2 star rating,"We were craving some Italian food while visiting old Montreal so we made reservations here for dinner. When we arrived, it took quite a while for the hostess to greet us and even though we had reservations, we had to wait another half an hour for a table. One seated, the server was never around and it took another half an hour for her to take our order and almost an hour for our food to come out. We were missing items when it finally came and the server kept helping other tables while ignoring us for long periods of time. It almost felt like we were being singled out for some reason but we didn't let it ruin our night. I had the mushroom pizza and my friend had the risotto, both of which weren't that great. I wouldn't skip this spot if you're in the area, especially since there's tons of better Italian restaurants to choose from."

I was exploring old Montreal and wanted a pizza so I stumbled into this place. Bevo feels like a upscale nyc bar. I was surprised this was a pizza place. The ambiance is awesome for a date or just a drink with friends. The pizza was really good! Thin crust like back at home, the sauce and cheese ratio was excellent and just the right amount of toppings. The pizza choices here weren't crazy and they kept to the classics. They do offer a build your own too. The waitresses are all dressed up and friendly. Bravo BEVO keep it up and the next time I visit Montreal, I will definitely be back!"

/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"I had been hearing so many good things about Bevo and I have to say i'm happy I was finally able to give it a try for myself ! They mainly serve Italian dishes like Arancino, Risotto , pasta and pizza etc. They have a nice selection of classical and more out of the box options to choose from. Pricing wise, it is very reasonable, especially with consideration to the fact that the portion sizes are great and the quality of the food and service is there. Our server was friendly and attentive to ensure that we had everything we needed. The decor inside is casual but still very pretty  with high ceilings, exposed brick and chandeliers. Great for a date , for groups or for families.The only thing was that for such a big space they do try to have as much seating as possible, so while it doesnt feel crowded in when you're sitting down at your table, it can be tough to circulate through some section. we did get our chairs bumped into more than a few times by some of the other guests. (Keeping in mind that this is a small detail and did not ruin the overall experience)I had a peach bellini that was absolutely delicious , not too sweet and so refreshing ! Their veal poutine is a great choice , tender braised veal and their own spin on the gravy , so well spiced with lots of stretchy tasty cheese and perfectly cooked fries. The flavour was great but not overpowering so you can enjoy every bite to the end without being overhwhelmed.  And of course , a pizza addict like me couldn't come to Bevo and NOT try one of their pizzas! I had the Formaggio Di Capra E Spinaci (goat cheese, spinach, tomato sauce& sun dried tomato). The dough was nice and thin ,cooked in a wood oven, it had great texture flavour, and a great balance of all the delicious toppings! All in all this was a great experience in all aspects , definitely coming back here again !"

They ruined it completely, there were tiny flies buzzing around outside and inside the restaurant. Service was slow and it's way too expensive for a tasteless experience. I would never go back and would discourage everyone from trying it out as well"

/user_details?userid=C-zRQRICTNk6zaxnQ1VdmQ,Joby M.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"One thing I've noticed while visiting Montréal is that every food establishment has pretty slow service compared to the US. Maybe there are too many tables per server or they just aren't in any real rush. I don't know. But since it was consistent throughout everywhere I went, I didn't let that affect my rating here, because everything other than the speed of service was beyond all expectations. The restaurant looks great inside, plenty of space. The staff was all very friendly and welcoming. The food was awesome. Our group of five all had various pizzas and they were all so delicious. Pick whatever you want off the menu, I'd be surprised if you don't like it. I'm not sure if I'll be coming back to Montreal, but if I do I'll definitely be returning to eat here."

But really? This pasta entree for $19 + tax?? and you get 4 pcs of it? I wish we were told by the waitress that the serving is going to be like this when we told her me and my friend were sharing.

I will say our first visit was way better than the second visit (which is why my rating is a 4 instead of a 5). On our second visit, we were asked if we wanted to sit at the bar or where the pizza was being made. We thought at the bar we would get faster service, boy were we wrong. But onto the main attraction the food, it was really good. We try on vacation to not go back to places more than once but the food during MTLaTable was so good that my husband wanted to go back again and it being close to our AirBnb was another added bonus."

If you're looking for the best pizza in Montreal, look elsewhere.The crust was very well done with the perfect thickness and chewiness, but the flavours of both the mushroom and margherita pizzas fell short. The mushrooms overpowered the pizza and were rubbery and a bit bland. The only thing that saved that pizza was the truffle flavour. The antipasto platter we ordered as a starter was also disappointing. On the plus side, our service was great."

Arrived around 7PM (19:00) and were told that there was a 30 min wait. An hour and 15 minutes later (after only a little bit of strong arming), we were seated. The atmosphere was pleasant and the food delicious, but the potion size of the pasta dishes was abysmal. I guess the point is to order multiple courses, but that would take the meal from pricy to overly expensive. Also, drinks aren't free refills, which seems a bit cheap in this day and age.Overall, I don't regret eating here, but had we known about the wait and  portions we would've gone elsewhere."

I had read good reviews about this place so I was pretty excited. When we finally got our food, I was disappointed to see that there was barely any sauce with my pasta dish, the Rosata penne with prosciutto and mushrooms. It's as if they scraped off the bottom of the pan to get all the remaining sauce. I don't think this was worth 19$."

Came here coz the reviews looked good but once we got in, they placed us near a really loud/drunk group. We were starving and 2 of us ordered pizza while the other 2 ordered pasta. The gnocchi I got was $21 and the portions were ridiculously small and not worth $21. There was nothing in there except sauce and dough, no basil or anything so it tasted super one dimensional. I don't know how people can think this is acceptable for $21 because I can make something better at home and I was not even full and had to go somewhere else after. Really disappointed at the food and price. The pizza looked better but taste-wise it wasn't anything memorable either. Guess if you like the loud vibe and overpriced food come here, otherwise don't bother."

Not only is the decor visually appealing, but the DJ spinning tracks aside the bar set for a great date night atmosphere. The service from beginning to end was attentive, while our conversation remained uninterrupted throughout the night (except to deliver each course timely).My wife and I are burrata aficionados, and the execution here was top notch. The cheese had the right balance between being creamy inside and slightly firm on the surface, and it was seasoned just right with cracked black pepper and sea salt. The verde salad and was a nice complement, and our waiter's recommendation to pair with their house tomatoes was well received.I'm a huge fan of Neopolitano style pizza, and this pizzeria did the genre justice. Each ingredient was distinct and full of flavor, and every bite made it more clear that the meal was made from scratch.This is one of those places where you're tempted to return the next evening.

The pasta was done perfectly and the pizza was nice and toasty! I though the pizza could've used a bit more flavor but overall, no complains!It would have been a 4 star rating but have to knock it down 1 star due to the fact we were there for their Burrata and Truffled pizza and they didn't have either!

Then the service was delayed with a delay of 40 minutes between the apps to the main course... for spending over $450 bucks at this place, we did not get good service.

We settled on BEVO, because they had a vegan option for my wife. I'll be honest with you, I have a love and hate relationship with this place. First, prices are typical for a touristy area like the Old City. Food was tasty, but somewhat overpriced. I had Tortellini con ricotta e spinaci (tortellini with spinach and ricotta), which cost $19. Now, if they served 7-8 of them, I would not have a reason to complain. However, they served 4 tortellini. **FOUR** for $19. That's $5 for each tortellini. This is ridiculous! Sure, they were INCREDIBLY tasty, I admit. The chef did a wonderful job....but $5 per tortellini is a rip off IMO.Service was alright. Nothing to write home about. The patio was ok too. Not too noisy and steps away from the main street with souvenir stores.Perhaps this place is great for drinks at night, since they have a pretty cool decor and bar inside, but in terms of food, I'd rather go to a different place next time, which has a better ratio of value for money."

The prices are great, the beers cold and the food, well I'm just getting started. So to start, the charcuterie plate was lovely. Bigger than I thought it would  be for an app, I really liked the sundried tomatoes and artichoke hearts. (I ended up using them as pizza toppings) My pizza was hot out of the oven, and just as I remember it from the last time I was there, chewey and thin underneath the hot cheese and slightly burned at the crust just the way I like it. The pasta was a little dry for my taste but the simple clean flavors of parmesan, tomato, and pasta was well executed. For the real star of the show, the hot peppers sitting in the hot oil. For me, this blows NY chili pepper flakes out of the water. I don't know why I can't get those in NY, they're much more flavorful and spicy. Also I don't remember the beer I ended up trying but it went very well with the pizza."
/user_details?userid=ytEvh__0tsi73NU1DazMsQ,Joe G.,"Cedar Grove, NJ",1 star rating,"I'd like to start this review off by saying I hate giving bad reviews. Rarely do I ever see the need to give a place such a negative review. The one star is because one appetizer was half decent and the server removed one item off our bill that was inedible. We were seated in the bar area, which was extremely bright, red lights illuminating from the bar, irritating to the eyes. It was not a pleasant dining experience. Loud club music played throughout the restaurant and the volume greatly increased at 7pm. Our server was quick to take our drink orders and then disappeared for a while before returning to take our dinner orders. Once our food arrived we did not see our waitress for a long period of time while we sat with empty water glasses. The gentleman at the table next to us actually  went to the bar to refill his water. As for the food..we ordered 2 appetizers (beet & pear salad and the arancini) and two pizzas (margarita and mushroom with prosciutto). The beet and pear salad was under seasoned, if seasoned all. The arancini was the best item we had. The bolognese sauce had good flavor however the risotto cake was dry and spongy. The crust of the margarita pie was cooked well. The mushroom\prosciutto bottom so so badly burnt it left a terrible bitter taste in our mouth. It was inedible and our server took off of our bill.  When it was time to pay, it took an awful lot of time for the server to bring our bill over (15-20 minutes at least) and she was nowhere to be found.  When she finally appeared she apologized for being absent for the duration of our meal and hoped we enjoyed our visit. We wished her a happy new year and she responded by saying, ""Yeah, happy fucking new year""."

We were steered to Bevo because of the great reviews (and because hubby loves pizza) and we were not disappointed. We came around 8:30 on a Saturday night and, judging by all the full tables, were expecting to have a wait but were happy when we were seated right away. For apps, we ordered the calamari, which was cooked and salted perfectly. Also, the waiter recommended that we try the Arancino (risotto ball with meat sauce). So good! Wish we ordered one to take home. For an entree, we shared a pizza. Note that these are 10-inch, 4-slice pizzas so they are okay to share if you have appetizers, but not otherwise. We had the pizza with prosciutto, portobello mushrooms, and mozzarella. Delicious! And that's coming from New Yorkers! For drinks, the old-fashioned is good and strong, if you're into bourbon. Try the berry mojito, if you want a cocktail. I also had a prosecco Sangria, which tasted similar to a mimosa but with a kick. Overall, we loved the ambiance of Bevo. There was a variety of age groups here and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. Seems to be a good place for groups - as we saw a bachelorette party and a birthday party being celebrated here. Also, they played great music!"

They have a great outdoor seating area perfect for people watching. The beer and wine list is good. This is a great spot to sit and grab some good pizza and drinks. My only knock against it is at night on the weekends the music is blasting and it almost has a club vibe to it, if that's not your scene find another place to hang out.

Mostly a pizza/pasta place and their pizzas are usually recommended but I was not feeling pizza that day so went for Veal shank plate with tomato sauce and risotto. It was so good. I am a sucker for tangy tomato flavours in general so this was a win anyway. But for optimum experience, I used their chili sauce (usually meant for pizza) to complement the subtlety of tomato. The meat was tender and risotto was perfect. The portion did justice to its price, I was over filled. I would actually suggest charging less and reducing the portion size because an overwhelming serving can reduce the enjoyment from flavours. I also tried my friend's pizza which was mind blowing; going to try the pizza there next time."

They were not up to par to the standards that Bevo set on the first night we came, so for our last meal in Montréal, we decided to go to Bevo again. First off, the pizza we had was outstanding. Hailing from New York City, I've had my fair share of Italian food and was not prepared to be blown away by Bevo like I did. My boyfriend and I shared a Margarita pizza with prosciutto cotto. He also had a berry mojito. The second time we ordered the same pizza and I had the penne with rose sauce with crispy prosciutto and mushrooms. It was possibly- actually no. It was definitely the best pasta I had in the northern hemisphere. Not only does this place have great food, the service is outstanding. It can sometimes lag due to busyness, but the wait staff is always polite and friendly. I highly recommend anyone who is coming to Montréal to dine here.

My partner and I went in around 6 on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was fairly quiet. We had been sightseeing all day and were dressed for the cold weather. The hostess sat an older couple in front of us and sat them in the front part of the restaurant. She then sat us in the back, and I mean the back away from other customers. It was obvious what she doing. My partner and I are in our mid-20s and she was clearly stereotyping. We had the same experience with the waitress. She greeted us, mumbling her hello, didn't even say her name. She filled our drinks took our orders and that was pretty much it. My partners water was empty before the meal even came and it was only refilled when another employee did it. The food itself was decent, but the service didn't make it worth it. For the record, we ALWAYS tip 20% or more. I know that servers rely heavily on the tips. In this case she did not get the 20%."

The music selections were perfect and matched the energy of the place almost too well. Our party was so moved by his silky smooth beats we bought him a few drinks during the course of the evening. The purposeful yet appropriate first pumps, dance moves and spins were the icing on top. He literally made our night.Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is an audiophile.

Perfect texture to the dough, the sauce had spot on flavor, cheese was good too. I got a simple cheese pizza just to see what BEVO was all about. Bravo!For my main I had the spinach and cream tortellini - so damn tasty, very well made. A little small, but for the kind of resto BEVO is and it's location I feel you're expected to have 3 courses here.Next had the tiramisu, was delicious.

It's also slightly over priced. i think the way to go is to split a bunch of dishes like our group did, makes it much more affordable and you get to try a bunch of things! was a little disappointed with our pitcher of sangria..just wasn't that tasty and seemed too watered down. my friend's berry mojito also tasted a bit off. the pro's...our waitress was so, so sweet and accommodating to our group's dietary restrictions (some vegetarians) and made it extra special for the bachelorette we were celebrating. (Ask for a special shot ;)) The restaurant is also a beautiful venue and HUMONGOUS. Loved the decor. My friend and I split a standard pepperoni pizza which was delicious and i surprisingly even enjoyed the couple of bites of my friend's carrot soup which i was not expecting to like. (creamy and the carrot wasn't overwhelming.) Tried some truffled mushroom pizza which was amazingggg. The tortellini with riccotta/spinach was also tasty. So 5 stars for food, service and ambiance but probably a 3 for the drinks and prices. Easily fixable in my opinion! I'd recommend this spot to anyone coming from out of town...in a central area right in the middle of old port. loved walking around after (there was a cute little alley of cool art and jewelry right near by, def worth checking it!)"

When it came up as an option on OpenTable, I made reservations right away. Located in the Old Port of Montreal, it offers a very cozy and friendly atmosphere. To begin, we ordered my boyfriend's go-to-drink Rye & Ginger and I ordered the ""Godfather"" which is scotch and amaretto. Our drinks lasted for the entire meal- they hit the spot.We then ordered the PIATTO BEVO charcuterie platter with marinated vegetables, served with fior di latte mozzarella. We ordered the small platter and it was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend could not stop raving about it & honestly, we didn't know how we would have room for our main courses. The small platter is definitely enough for two people.For the main course, my boyfriend had the FILETTO DI DENTICE-red snapper filet, salsa cruda, fine herbs. He thoroughly enjoyed it and said it was very light. I ordered the PORCHETTA AL FORNO-roasted pork loin with fine herb white wine. As soon as it was put in front of me, I started salivating. The smell alone was amazing. I was unable to eat the whole thing since I was so full from our appetizer but I cannot wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. It was absolutely delicious.The restaurant itself is beautiful. Stone buildings, beautiful chandeliers, a wonderful bar and you can see your pizzas being made in front of you in their wood fire stove. The service was amazing, our waiter was incredibly friendly and approachable. It was fast and there was not one bad thing to be said about it. While plate costs around $30 each, the portions they serve you makes it worth it. Overall, it was an amazing experience.

We made reservations and were sat immediately when we arrived. The main dining area was a bit tight causing the wait staff not being able to get to tables which made it a bit uncomfortable. Also, the second floor seemed to open up as a lounge with loud music which made it difficult to have a conversation with your party. The food was okay we got a couple of pizzas.

Nice loungy atmosphere with a great live DJ but conversation was still very much possible. The restaurant has 2 floors, and there is enough space between tables that you don't feel like you're eating your neighbour's dinner. Waitstaff is very attentive but leave you your space (no pressure for ordering, or eating quickly), and are always sure to fill up your glass whether water or wine. The prices are quite good given the location and quality of the food. The food was very fresh and delicious! We ordered the mixed olives, caprese salad and margherita pizza with arugula, as well as sharing a bottle of prosecco. I would very highly recommend. We will be back for sure!"

D.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"My partner and I arrived to Montreal early May 2017 for a 5 day stay (partly business and partly pleasure).  We stayed in the Old Port area which is historic and beautiful.Being vegetarians and foodies, we not only desire food that is meat-free, but we seek micronutrients, primarily in the form of vegetables.  Salads are fine and we do eat them, but we also like to eat copious amounts of vegetables.  They are not a garnish for us, they are the center of our meals.  This requirement is not easily met in certain cities and/or countries.  As wonderful as French food is, it can be difficult to eat anything short of a salad, potatoes (assuming they are not cooked in animal fat) or possibly another starchy option, like 3 small raviolis in a cream sauce on the appetizer menu.  Not criticizing, just stating the reality.  Hence, we seek restaurants that can meet our needs and sometimes, as was the case this time, become a bit redundant by eating at the same restaurant repeatedly.We found Bevo on both Tripadvisor and Yelp.  Then, as it turned out, our hotel staff told us it was a part of the same ownership group as themselves and also recommended it.Although we found no separate vegetable section on the menu, I saw that some of their meat options came with spinach so I figured they would be willing to create a side of spinach for us.  They were in fact accommodating and it was large and delicious - photo attached.  During our 4 dining experiences there, we also ordered the tagliatelle with tomato sauce, tagliatelle with mushrooms and truffles (not on the menu) and white pizza with mushrooms and truffles.  We also ordered the arugula salad w/shaved parmesan and the burrata which came with tasty grilled crostini.  We kept meaning to take photos but unfortunately, we jumped right in and by the time we thought of it, plates were half full.  The one thing we captured before digging in was an order of the side of spinach (likely to only excite other veg-heads like us).  I will attach it.  Others have posted those things we ordered with the exception of the custom pasta with mushrooms and truffles.Also, the staff was especially lovely.  A special shout out to to our servers in order of our 4 meals there: Alexi, Sophie, Cynthia and Cassandra.  All 4 were accommodating, warm and attentive.  We also very much enjoyed our chats with the hostess Martina and other staff that gravitated towards us and chatted us up (we generally went to eat at 1600 so the restaurant was not yet busy).  Some of those we met and enjoyed were: Yanni and Billy and although we only waved and received a wink from Mathieu, the chef, we appreciated him for his skill, flexibility and talent.  All those we spoke with expressed either directly or indirectly, their enthusiasm working there and expressed positive feelings towards those who employ them.  One even stated, ""It's a very good group to work for.""  That feeling of goodness came through so evidently in their attitudes and professionalism which seemed effortless.  We really enjoyed everything - the food, ambiance, staff and again, the flexibility.  Dear Bevo and the ""Group"" who employs - job well done.  Your employees are happy and therefore they make the clients happy.  What ever you're doing, it's working."

The main course, think it was penne with prosciutto more than made up for it. Only thing that was a negative was the front staff/manager? Even though we were a group of five and the restaurant was 85% empty, they were trying to sit us in a small table for four. Basically had to argue with the guy to get us a larger table.

Had a tiramisu for dessert, I never had ""nonna's"" made one, but this could be it. Just felt like hearty homestyle dessert. I also found one of my fav Chardonnay's, a treat on top of it all.

At least the server came back to inform us about it before serving it to us. The seafood pasta and lasagna were both delicious. Ordered a pizza to share as it had great reviews, but wasn't that impressed with it.

Since we did not, we were told we could be seated in the bar area, despite the entire first floor of tables open. Not only were we seated in the corner, but under the staircase by the cleaning supplies. It felt that all non-local dinners were seated in the corner. The food was average pasta and Italian dishes, with the pasta seeming to be purchased and not made in house.

I am a bit of a risotto snob and this one was delightful. I was also advised to order the Nutella pizza however I was just too full. But it looked wonderful.

Although I find their menu to be rather small, I do have to consider the ""quality over quantity"" saying when it comes to BEVO. Take their Margherita pizza for example, such a simple pizza (cheese & sauce) but the pizza crust was so good & ingredients so fresh that it didn't matter. They even have a great wine list to choose from (go for the white).The staff...well...a little cold & horrible English skills. Given that the Old Port is a tourist attraction, this surprises me. Had the staff been a little friendlier & had their noses turned up a little less, I would've given this place 5 stars!"

Being a vegan it is often difficult to come to Italian restaurants because butter and cheese is put in a lot of items. There was a specific pasta and sauce that was designated as vegan and our waiter Giancarlo helped me put the vegan pasta with a delicious plain red sauce that was to die for. Giancarlo was kind, witty, and an excellent help. My boyfriend and I do not like oaky wines and he helped us pick a delicious white wine to go with our meal. Also the homemade bread here was TO DIE FOR. I think I had to have had 10 slices it was just too good. This place is a must see in Montreal!"

Oh and definitely make a reservation before coming.The margarita pizza was actually delicious. Not the best ever, but definitely delicious and a perfect meal to go with the upbeat and trendy atmosphere that this place presents. We ended up staying here a lot longer than originally planned both for drinks as well as for more pizza.

First of all I want to point out how fantastic their staff is. Myself and three friends came in on a Sunday night while visiting Montreal. They were fully booked for reservations but the staff was able to do some finagling to get us seated. Our waiter was super professional and extremely friendly. I enjoyed the steak special and my friends all got pastas. To start we all split one of the margherita pizzas which was delicious and the perfect size to split 4 ways. Additionally, the wine selection was fantastic and the prices were right. The only reason this lost a star was because when I asked if the pasta was fresh/homemade, I was informed that it was dry pasta. Unfortunately I feel that a restaurant of this quality really should be using fresh pasta. The gnocchi was fresh, but I just feel like you need to fully commit to the fresh pasta. While I understand the main focus of this restaurant is the pizzas, having fresh handmade pasta would really take this place up a notch. Worth the time that goes into making it for sure."

Deep fried risotto balls crispy on the top and soft inside, topped with meat sauce.   Antipasti was ok. Meatballs were delicious too. Now for the pizza's........Not one of  the best pizza's I've had, but they were good. We tried the Bosco in Bianco, Capriciosa & Cotto E Bocconcini.  The crust is flavorful. Woodfire makes these pizza's delicious, Though I prefer the crust to be a bit extra burnt.  The Capriciosa was interesting as I'd never had a boiled egg on the pizza. It actually tastes really good. Also ask for the spicy oil. That adds a lot of flavor to it.Definitely worth a visit ...... Again & again......

A group (8?) of us wandered in for dinner and our expectations were beyond met! The server was phenomenal, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was wonderful. Bevo has a very ""trendy"" vibe, so we were afraid it would be pretentious, but were happily mistaken! In fact, we had such a great time, my local chapter decided to host our national social there. I will say we had a few issues: I felt the space we were given was small, and it was right at the bar, so it was high-traffic with the servers for the whole restaurant coming through; it was also right at the door, so I felt I was always on top of the maitre'd. Food was amazing as expected, but drink service was on the slow side, even with 2 dedicated servers. Food service was good--we had a variety of items, and they were very good about putting out a few trays and replacing them with new items through the evening rather than bringing everything out all at once.It's also popular; both times I've been here (evening), there have been plenty of patrons, but I only felt crushed during the social. i don't recommend Bevo for a night drinking beer in a t-shirt and jeans watching hockey, but I do recommend it for dinner and drinks with friends, before or as your night out."

I would have preferred a bigger piece of basil with each tomato but that is a personal choice. The cheese makes this dish and it made it well.We also had a risotto with cheese and meat sauce to start. I was hesitant since I'm not a risotto fan but this was good....so good my 4 year old was asking for more. Perfect mix of all flavors.I had a Bellini to drink and while it was great it was $11 for such a small portion. I would have rather spent the money to get a ""bigger"" drink like a Caesar.... Didn't stop me from drinking 2 though!My main meal was a Salame Pizza (basically a fancy way of saying pepperoni! I liked it. The pizza was thin crust, well cooked and the pepperoni had a bit of a kick to it. I didn't finish it because I was full with the apps and drinks.The service was very attentive and the decor of the place was great. The bathrooms needed attention though.

The outdoor was on a side street patio and was more roomy than typical urban outdoor venues.  Inside had nice decor. The food was delicious.  We got a prosciutto Margarita pizza with mixed berry mojitos.The mojito was interesting tasting with a fizzy soda taste,  but the fresh fruits added great flavor. The pizza was great,  flavorful,  crispy but soft on the side... It's that perfect equilibrium for brick oven... And this is coming from a kid that eats NJ pizza everyday... I was a bit scared because of the difference in water,  but bevo gets it right.. The service,  the atmosphere and the food make this place a must go to."

First of all it was overcooked penne, not spaghetti and the sauce tasted like a can of cheap Ragu sauce from the  grocery store. The rest of us enjoyed our pizza while my boyfriend ate  his mush of a pasta. On top of that the price of said spaghetti bolognese was $18!Very disappointed"

I've been raving about how amazing it was all night and day. They have a good wine selection too, I had a glass of their Toscana red (first on the list, can't remember it's full name), my friend had a glass of their white Chardonnay.Considering it was a Saturday night in Old Montreal, it was definitely loud and packed, as expected. Keep in mind this is a Restaurant & BAR. With a few bachelorette parties going on, it was quite the funny sight as well.

I can't remember the name of it but the portion size was extremely small and she didn't seem to enjoy it much.  The best part was we told the waiter we were celebrating my friend's bachelorette and he wouldn't let us leave without having a tequila shot, on him!

If this review is too harsh, please keep in mind that it is being  written on the toilet, your $25 pizza forcibly removing itself from my body. The place is nice, excellent ambience, and initially I was completely happy with the meal. This feeling of satisfaction deserted me as soon as the food arrived. Not only was my pizza not what I ordered, it was completely mediocre. I would have complained, but I was in a professional  setting and didn't want to make a fuss. The crust was dry, and totally flavourless. Toppings meh.  I found myself wishing I was in another place, eating another pizza. I also wished that my bill wasn't $25. I came home unsatisfied, knowing I wasn't going to return. I wouldn't have cared enough to write this review if the experience hadn't stayed with me. I'm fairly confident that your pizza is responsible for my gastrointestinal distress as others had exactly what I ate that day minus what I ordered."

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I like a good pizza. Scratch that - I love a good pizza. It has gotten to the point where I am experimenting at home making my own... and getting decent success as I keep working out the kinks. It's not perfect but in the meantime, that is what good restaurants are for, am I right? Last month, following a wonderful few hours at La Mondiale de la Biere enjoying many many brews, my friends and I got the hankering for some pizza. Thinking about the options closest to us, I figured a visit to BEVO in the old port was in order. So we casually walked over ready to enjoy some good Italian cuisine.Located just off Place Jacques Cartier in the heart of the Old Port, BEVO visually is in keeping with many of the Old Port establishments - a mix of the old brick and stone foundations of the area buildings with some more modern elements to add some glam. In this case, BEVO uses red tinted glass around the atrium, a very large chandelier and an tile entry wait which includes a glass wine cellar. The first floor has a huge bar area where the backbar is lit up in red and the front of the actual bar is just a light box. Add an area where there are 70s-style hanging bubble chairs and you have a spot that is clearly a solid happy hour zone.On this occasion however, we were there too late for happy hour and too early for any late-night bar scene. The two dining areas are more straight forward than the bar - wooden tables and chairs, paper tablecloths with cute info-graphics about pizza making and red checkered napkins for that little old school Italian restaurant touch. On the first floor, the wood-fired pizza oven is visible for all to see and gets you excited for what is to come.Our first starter was salsiccia e Rapini - a house made sausage with garlic rapini. The sausages were delicious although a little small for my liking. Rapini is one of those vegetables you either love or hate - personally I am a fan of its bitterness. The combination of bitter with the garlic made a nice partner to the fatty sausages.The second starter was arancino - saffron parmesan risotto balls with meat ragu and mozzarella. The risotto ball itself had a good crust to it and that didn't come at the cost of drying out the risotto itself. It still had nice creaminess although I really didn't get any hint of saffron personally. The meat ragu draped over it had a nice meaty richness to it and paired very well to the ball itself. Like the previous starter, I just wanted more!Because one of the friends with me doesn't eat cheese (i know, i know.... i've tried to show him the error of his ways) we did order one non-pizza main dish: the cavatelli bolognese - dumplings, meat ragu and fresh parsley. Excellent plate of pasta - same delicious meat ragu as before with the perfectly cooked cavatelli. A little bit of parmesan would have been nice but that was a lost battle from the start in this case.Now we arrive to the main attraction: the pizzas. First up, I got the parma in blanco - prosciutto di parma, arugula and reggiano. This is probably my favourite pizza type when dealing with classic thin crust pizzas. The salty rich prosciutto, the pepper arugula, the sharp reggiano and a little bit of olive oil... a perfect balance of items on top of a pizza. However, all of that is wasted if the actual pizza isn't up to snuff. BEVO doesn't have that problem. The wood-fired oven gives a nice crispness to the bottom but allows for just enough rise to create some chewiness. A wonderful pizza.The other pizza we ordered was the cotto e bocconcini - prosciutto cotto, portobello, tomato sauce, mozzarella and bocconcini. Same solid crust as my pizza although this one had been cooked a little more as the extra charring around the edge demonstrated. The melted bocconcini brought some more creaminess compared to just the mozzarella and the earthy portobellos added some contrast from the prosciutto. Another excellent pizza.BEVO is a solid experience from beginning to end. Solid starters, delicious pizzas and good pasta. All the beers from Beerfest prior eliminated our desire to test the cocktail and wine lists which seemed interesting. There was also the temptation of the nutella pizza for dessert but we decided to pass. Just gives me another reason to return. If you are looking for a good pizza in the Old Port or just a place to go enjoy a drink and a quick bit, BEVO is worth your consideration.Cheers!"

My wife started with a fennel and orange pecan salad, it was adequate. I had the calamari which were solid but nothing to write home about.The cons and this one is the big one. The main dish we chose to eat is the pizza, my God what a letdown. Why I wanted to go to this restaurant in the first place was because there pizzas were cooked in a wood burning oven. Their was such an uneven cook on the crust, part of it was burnt, while the other part was raw. Isn't pizza their bread and butter, how is it that they completely screwed up what their known for.

Cheese and carbs and toppings, I like it!  I tried the Emilia Romogna, intrigued by the meat raggu, and yum yum yum!  A really hearty and tasty pizza!  Was it as good as pizza I've had in Italy?  Maaaaaybe.  Was it some pretty good pizza!  Definitely!  Everyone else seemed to really love their pizza as well, whether it was a simple margherita pizza or a more involved pizza.Bevo got more bonus points when at the end of the meal they brought out a dessert pizza for us to share, on the house!  It was exactly what it sounds like: nutella on a pizza base.  Simple and tasty. One thing that Bevo is missing is a good house wine, brought out in big carafes.  It's fine to offer a large wine list, but sometimes you just want an inexpensive and delicious wine to wash everything down, and you don't need a fancy bottle to do that.  A house blend would be perfect.So overall, I will keep Bevo in mind the next time I want to have a nice yet casual dinner in the Old Port."

Loved the pizza - including the slight charring from the wood fired stove (I think others have considered the lovely charring as ""burned""). Our 6 yr old was entranced watching the pizza making - good for her and gave us some quiet time too. The gnocchi with sauce on side was a kid-meal hit. Adults enjoyed the penne with rose sauce and pancetta and a pizza with more pancetta and mushrooms."

The waitress got us a table outside and that was great, but the service was awful. We ordered an appetizer that didn't come until the two entrees did (olives, nothing fancy). Our sodas were flat and warm and she didn't bring us the ice we asked for. The waitress kept forgetting to bring what we asked her for and was not friendly at all.

Recommended by friends and having received a top rating in the ""Bitches Who Brunch"" blog, I was excited to try this place. We had the house salad (monstrous, lightly dressed, and fresh) as well as the arancino to start. The single giant rice ball was nicely fried and had a deep cheese flavor and great crunch. It was served with a superb meat sauce that was not the usual ground beef bolognese. This sauce was rich and substantial. It makes me want to go back to try the pasta dishes! Topped with a cute pile of micro greens, the arancini was both delicious and pretty.The pizza was somewhere between a thin and thick crust with a delicious flavor and wonderful oven crunch. We added pepperoni to the basic marinara pizza. The pepperoni was richer and fuller tasting than most. It was also pleasantly spicy. Mmmmm!The space is fun, the service is polite, and the food is good despite being in an area full of tourist spots of dubious quality. Try Bevo. You'll love it!"

Some people in Quebec get bratty if you don't speak French fluently, but not here. They were more than welcoming to English speakers and the servers were also helpful in making recommendations about the menu.The saffron risotto balls are not to be missed and could be a meal in and of itself - so huge and also amazingly tasty. The pizza - just get the salami. If you like salty and you like meat, there is no question. I think this might be my first review using balls, salty and meat in the same paragraph! And, I'm leaving it so even more testament to how fantastic BEVO is. You have to sit in the hanging chairs. They are really cool. Will be back to bring my husband for sure!"

I informed the hubby that we were not to have dinner because we were going to have the best pizza of life instead (even though waiting for dinner till 11pm is painful).. We were looking forward to it so much so that we told the people sitting our table about these amazing reviews. Needless to say, when the pizzas came, we were extremely excited. As soon as I took that first bite of my mushroom pizza, my face fell. What?? THIS is the amazing pizza?? Pizza Bravo in NYC makes pizza way better than this.. Geppetto on Notre Dame makes better pizza... Oh, the disappointment...... There was really nothing to the pizza. I thought it was just mine, but when I tried hubby's Capricosa I felt the same. People at the table who tried our pizzas said the same. Oh, the sadness.. This is what I starved myself for? Absolutely not worth it. Drinks were nice and strong - I stuck with a blood orange Cosmo the entire night (and by 'a', I really mean 3 or 4.. Lost count :p) while my hub experimented with the berry mojito (not good), the chocolate martini (not the best I've tried but not horrible), and the old fashion (not my style but he liked it). Two pizzas and 6/7 drinks later, our bill was $100.. So I'd say that the prices are decent for the Old Port.. Overall, I would give this place 3.5 stars but since I can't do that, I'll be generous and round up to 4. Cool ambiance, fast service, good drinks, decent prices, and meh food..hmmm I think I should press submit before I change my mind and round down! :)"

So we  pointed out some empty tables on the main level, then he said he was too busy to set those up for us... It became clear that he, for some reason did not want us there. Not sure if it was the American thing or because was are a mixed (racially) group.

But it turns out it doesn't matter because we ate well and paid less so I'm happy I went.We all ordered from the happening gourmand menu, which include entrée, main and dessert. For entrée I had portobello mushroom with asparagus with fontina sauce and fried calamari, then grilled veal and Osso buco  for mains and chocolate praline cake.The portobello and asparagus were well done, with the sauce blend very well with everything. The fried calamari was also very nice, the meat was tender and the batter was light brittle and soft, it melted nicely as you bit into it.The Osso buco was the best dish of the night, it was fall off the bone. It was served with a cheese risotto and top with a nice tomato sauce. The portion was huge but I couldn't stop eating it.The veal was a bit dry and no sauce made it very boring to eat...The chocolate cake was very rich, a bit on the sweet side, but you definitely feel the chocolate.It was an exceptional menu for the price, 23-33$ depending on what extras you took. The quality of the food surprised it, I would definitely come back even without happening gourmand. They also have a pizza oven so can't wait to try that out."

It was some latin fusion where every ""song"" sounded exactly the same. After about ten minutes of suffering through this garbage I went to the hostess and asked who is in charge of the music. She went to get the manager to inquire what could be done. At this point stiff Billy blank faced approached me and I returned the blank stare. He finally inquired as to why I was at the hostess station and I told him that I was requesting a change in the music. He explained that everyone had their preferences in music. I explained to him that every ""song"" sounded exactly the same with that heavy bass repeating over and over and over and over. SICKENING. So I guess if you don't mind heavy bass repeating thousands of times while you are dining this place might be for you. If trash garbage music is your thing then this place is definitely for you.

Can't speak to the other wines on their list but they get the lowest quality California wines and then charge WAY more markup than other restaurants. We ordered an Italian wine just so we wouldn't know how badly we were being ripped off. We ordered a pizza with mushrooms and prosciutto. What we were served was a pizza with like 4 mushroom pieces and HAM!!! We brought this to the waiter's attention and he went to talk to the chef. The chef sent him back out with a plate that had both prosciutto and ham on it, and he informed us that yes, the prosciutto-looking stuff on the plate was, in fact, prosciutto, but that the ham on the plate was just ""another type of prosciutto"". If ""prosciutto for suckers"" is a type of prosciutto, then I guess he's right!To their credit, they didn't charge us for the pizza, but overall it ended up being an incredibly overpriced and mediocre meal."

The first thing that I thought was... hardboiled egg on pizza? That makes as much sense as mango in a maki roll; preposterous, I declared. Not really, I like weird things - I once sprinkled vanilla ice cream with crunched up bits of BBQ chips, don't judge me, try it! So she cut me off a slice. The savouriness of the generous topping of sausages went really well with the toothsome bite of the roasted mushrooms. The overt sweetness of the tomato sauce was apparent through the cheese and egg.I didn't know what to think about having chopped up eggs on my pizza. I bit into it and the strangest thing happened. The waitress came over and asked how everything was, and before I knew it, she threw her apron into the air, the other servers pushed the tables aside and the manager jumped down from the second floor via swinging from the oversized chandelier in a choreographed dance. They broke out into song about how eggs have been shunned by the other pizza toppings for so many years and was fighting to find its own identity. It all ended in a rousing crescendo where everyone paused, threw their hands into the air and yelled, ""EGGS!"" No, not really... but eggs on this pizza really stood out - the powderiness of the yolk and that overall taste of egg was the kicker that tied everything together - how I never tried this before, I don't know."

We called the restaurant and spoke to Cynthia.  Although it took a little convincing and some begging, we got our reservation time moved up so that we could make it fit into our plans.  When we arrived at the restaurant, we were greeted by our server Angelica.  She was absolutely amazing.  She really went above and beyond to get to know us and what were celebrating.  She even gave the bachelorette a small treat to make her feel special.   It was so wonderful to get the kind of service that we do not see in the states to often.  Thank you BEVO, Cynthia and Angelica for a wonderful dinner experience."

I ordered a cotto e bocincini pizza which was really tasty, the only thing is I asked the waiter if this was the dry prosciutto and he said yes but it was prosciotto cotto which I know now is like thinly sliced ham. It was loud though because of the music so the waiter might have misheard me.

Staff was friendly and entertained and engaged us and other kids with pizza tossing. They were accommodating with ordering requests (ie:Pasta with butter, no basil topping, etc) and our kids loved the food as the adults did too. Though we went on Thursday evening, where it was DJ night, and the music was loud! But, it drowned out our kid's noises!I ordered the Veal Milanese, it was enjoyed by my son and me. The calamari was enjoyed by all my kids, real calamari (not the weird even rings you see served at some places). We also had the Rosato Penne with Proscuitto. The proscuitto was a bit hard, but the pink sauce was very nice. Margarita pizza was delicious and enjoyed by my child. I was expecting it with round slices of mozzarella, but they used shredded and looked like a new york pizza. Also, had the beet salad and was delicious, big appetizer portion. They asked if we wanted goat cheese and we agreed without realizing it was additional cost until the bill came. Nevertheless, it as still delicious We would go back!"

They can accommodate a group. We were 9 people. The place is loud and it's hard to have a conversation with someone sitting right across from you. Has a cool trendy atmosphere. The portions are a good size. I got the chicken and it was pretty good but not amazing. My friend's sword fish was pretty good. I would probably get that next time. Apparently the pizza is also pretty good.

It was 715pm we had no problem- appetizer, dinner, dessert done by 830!"

/user_details?userid=p4pUKVV0f5NRMymxI5Nljw,Eugene B.,"San Francisco, CA",2 star rating,"On  Monday January 2, I arrived at 9:02pm for a 915pm reservation for 3 people. The waitress requested that we wait while the table was prepared in the dining area. After a few minutes the table was ready. However, she asked if we would like to sit at the bar. We politely declined. She then indicated the table would be ready at 915pm and to leave and return at that time. Meanwhile, it was about 9:07pm. We left and walked around Old Montreal for a few moments and returned at 915pm. When we arrived, she politely escorted us to the same table that was prepared earlier. Very awkward. Not to mention the pizza appetizer was amazing, but the main courses Lasagna, Gnocchi and Pescadora were cold when they were brought out. Overall, between the hostess and the selection of food I would not recommend this place. However, our waiter was fantastic. I hope Bevo-Pizzeria uses this feedback constructively to improve the overall restaurant experience. Great Potential."
/user_details?userid=GTQELxzW72_ZiV-iU84Ebg,Katy M.,"Amherst, MA",2 star rating,"I ate here with my family while on vacation for a few days in Old Montreal and was somewhat disappointed with my experience. The ambiance was chic but unpretentious, and there was plenty of indoor and outdoor seating so we were seated quickly.Service was only fair - our food was prepared quickly but it took a long time for our waitress to check in with us, which only happened once or twice during out dinner.We shared a risotto ball appetizer, which was tasty but went quickly for three people. For entrees, we ordered a seafood scampi, chicken supreme, and pasta dish with ricotta and crushed tomatoes. The scampi was fairly good, but the seafood was chopped into tiny bits and it was hard to differentiate scallops from shrimp from whatever else might have been chopped up and added in. The tomato based sauce also did quite mesh with the fish flavored in the dish. The pasta dish was okay but lacked flavor and seasoning. The tomato sauce tasted pretty much liked crushed tomatoes from a can with no seasoning, and there didn't seem to be much cheese. The chicken supreme looked completely unappetizing and wasn't as advertise at all. Rather than an herb-crusted chicken breast with a side of asparagus, it was a huge chunk of bone-in chicken (with skin and no herbs or crust to speak of) over a bed of whatever green stuff they had laying around the kitchen - a mix of flavorless green beans, spinach stalks, and 2-3 stalks of asparagus.Additionally, for the quality of food and service we received, we grossly overpaid - the entrees seemed super overpriced (even accounting for the exchange rate from USD to CAD) and weren't particularly tasty.Overall, this place was just decent and a tad overpriced. We all agreed that we would not make an effort to return here, particularly with all of the other food options in the Old Montreal area."

So this is going to be short and sweet.There are few restaurants in our beautiful city that actually know how to make Pizza. Like, REALLY make pizza. The way it should be made. The way it's made in Italy.Bevo is one of them.Let's just say that while stuffing my pretty little face, I was anything but a lady. And using the excuse ""where I come from we eat it with our hands"" didn't quite have the desired effect. Rather, Mr. Haze just rolled his eyes, and ducked his head out of sight of confused neighbouring tables. To summarize: the sauce is outstanding, the cheese is amazingly fresh mozzarella and it's so perfectly thin... the piece de resistance, the wood-burning oven- what a beaut.DO NOT get me started on the Nutella pizza (I ate the whole thing to myself). There is nothing, NOTHINGGGG better. Ideal mixture of salty and sweet, and gooey and crispy, and chocolate and bread, and ... and... and..Looking back I could tell you that the service was beyond friendly and attentive, that the music was rockin', that the crowd was good lookin' and that it had a great post-dinner party vibe. But last night, at exactly 9:37 pm, none of that mattered, it was just me and my Pizza Pie all alone in that big ol' restaurant. THAT'S AMORE."

We killed half an hour or so at the bar while sipping on a Godfather and a Vespa Martini for my friend. There are great views of the place from the bar, cute waitresses and clientele, many more ladies than guys. We eventually were brought upstairs, at the end of the gallery with direct views of the pizza oven which was quite cool. The walls are stone and irregular which add to the ambiance. Well what started out like a quite nice experience turned a bit annoying, after the waitstaff realized they forgot our pizza order yet told us they were simply ""busy"". Probably not the truth.. it was already after 10:30pm and the restaurant had emptied out quite a bit by that time. Either way, not the end of the world but not cool either. The pizza was quite good though but it would have been nice to see some sort of gesture to compensate for our one hour + wait. Maybe it was just a fluke? Est-ce que tout est correct? Ouais.. presque!"

Ordered the prosciutto, arugula, and Parmesan pizza and was not disappointed! The waitstaff was attentive and friendly.

I wouldn't;  order that again just because it was a little much for me, but that's my own fault. A lot of reviews said the Nutella pizza was good.
