/user_details?userid=ynUz4wN5kAaucP2VAp6oDQ,Joel L.,"Kirkland, Canada",3 star rating,"I walked by the rotisserie without having booked and they were kind enough to accommodate my last minute order as I had been craving Portuguese chicken for quite some time. The spices were good but I had found the chicken a bit over cooked and not tender which is a shame. I'll have to retry this one to make sure hoping there is potential. Covid rules were followed literally as I ordered, paid and had the order by the door with a mask in both ends on."
/user_details?userid=KFsbACIHXQxyff_W6CN1LA,Karen H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Decided to be in this area again and met a friend at the same time. We built up an appetite by walking all day and certainly not a shortage of Portuguese food in the area. This place is still takeout only and that wasn't a problem. We ordered chicken thighs, French fries, salad and sausages. We took our order and took a walk to the Park on Parc Ave. Big and beautiful and everyone was having fun. We found a picnic table and we ate and ate and ate everything up. Lol. I do enjoy at this time trying out different Portuguese Resto's,  they are all pretty good with little differences, that's what will change the review. Our walk back to the car included a pit stop  at Bilboquet ice cream. What can I say...Till the next t time, act responsible and stay safe!"

Chicken is not dry, does not have a lot of bells and whistles but the quality of the food is good.  You can smell it from outside and there arent crazy lines/wait times like some of the places out there"
/user_details?userid=4d83aLIuStq3aR2vVNYy2A,Jimmy S.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,This place is around the corner from where I'm staying which is convenient. There isn't much signage for this place so it's possible to miss it. I decided to get 1/2 chicken that came with fries and salad. Chicken is cooked Portuguese style and it's very juicy. My friend got a steak sandwich and liked it. It took 15 mins for them to make it and they don't accept credit cards. It is cash only.
/user_details?userid=EOajY1L3ole3gLTCZ2xw1g,Jack M.,"West Chester, PA",3 star rating,"The chicken sandwich had an excellently executed chicken and bread. The chicken is juicy and tender. The bread is robust, yet soft, with just enough of a crust to give an interesting texture.However, the chicken had way too much salt. This dominated the flavor profile of the bird. With a nice mayo-based sauce maybe this could have been overcome. But the saltiness was so profound I can't give more than 3 stars."
/user_details?userid=YcaO4xCNgt123pNHsJkS_Q,Zachary H.,"Louisville, KY",5 star rating,"You walk in as a normal human being, you walk out still mostly normal but with such deep scents of smokeyness in your skin you'll probably never get it out.  Portugalia is a rotisserie chicken sit down restaurant you don't really get in USA#1, with full service and menu and the food being cooked and the aromas flying about the restaurant.  Go there, order some chicken, eat some of their fantastic bread, and have a beer or two. You deserve it."
/user_details?userid=N4ZdcLNwGL9fzFiqtR1YqQ,Justina N.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Yum!! I'm here visiting and when I was looking at a menu at another restaurant a local man told me not to eat there. When I asked where he would recommend he instantly told me to get a chicken sandwich from here. So I read the reviews and got a whole roasted chicken, chicken sandwich, ribs and fries.  ALL WERE DELICIOUS!!!! The fries could use some salt but the meats were succulent and tasty!!!  This is not. A great picture of the ribs but I recommend them. They are clearly grilled and not. Oiled like other places do to save time.I called for take out because I have little kids and make sure you call early. He told me 30 m but it Took 40. I'm. It complaining as it was really hot and fresh. Staff is so nice!!!! Go!"

Have to say when it comes to chicken sandwiches, this one is very good too. All I had was the sandwich. Delicious bread. Deliciously spiced chicken. Really enjoyed it."
/user_details?userid=qnZkCGvLz6AB5cQN_J_pUA,Jack D.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",4 star rating,"For this trip to Montreal, it was my personal mission to find my favorite Portuguese chicken spot. And overwhelmingly my folks here recommended Portugalia. So the other night, the boo and I scheduled a dinner there. Because of traffic and other unforeseen obstacles, we arrived a little late, but the staff was kind enough to fit us in. Part luck, part hospitality. The setup is kind of interesting: the entrance is the kitchen/take-out area, and around the corner is the dining area complete with a bar and hidden restrooms. Because I was so intent on trying the chicken, we ordered (huh?) the ribs! I wasn't mad because they were amazing. We also ordered a mixed meat plate that included the chicken, some sausage, and a seasoned pork patty. Everything was amazing, though next time I'd get a chicken plate and a rib plate. What sets Portugalia apart from other places is that they use a dryer seasoning and a little less grease, which to me allows one to taste the meat and char more. That being said, I would probably pick this place over others I've tried. The service was also superb, the staff attentive and informative, and again quite accommodating based on our tardiness. I definitely recommend a reservation if you prefer to eat in, though the take out doesn't seem like a bad option neither."
/user_details?userid=21KBztSv78iJlnIKFgMDIw,HM M.,"Centretown, Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,We waited in line about 30 mins. However the chicken was great and the poutine was quite good. The tarts were amazing. Overall worth the wait. The price also seemed decent. The staff was also friendly. Hard to get a spot here to sit and eat.
/user_details?userid=Ot0aYEaOVe144ljMmG8YZQ,Rebecca S.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,Best grilled seasoned meats hands down! The owner is a fun character too.  Very welcoming & delicious spot.
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This to me is the place to get your Portuguese grilled chicken craving fixed! Grilled to perfection, the chicken is charred just enough for you to have that smokey aroma. Juicy, tender, moist, melts in your mouth and oh so delicious! Order a few hours in advance your chicken to go because they are that busy and famous! Especially after featuring on A La Di Stasio show. You'll be asked if you want it mild or spicy. I always ask for extra spicy lol! You can also dine-in since they have a sitting area but not a lot of people do that. Service is ok. Nothing else to say about that. Oh ya. I also suggest their chicken sandwich. It's also very good! The prices, in my opinion are fairly reasonable. You'll be full and still have money to go clubbing on the Main ;)"
/user_details?userid=yT_QCcnq-QGipWWuzIpvtw,Imran N.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Really good chicken, steak, quail and lambchops. What makes it good is the real charcoal grill. The warm bread and olives they serve with the meal is also a nice touch. The sides of salad, rice and fries are nothing special. The salad is an overdose of white onions. What kills this place is how long it takes to recieve your order. It's about 45mins - 1 hour from the time you place your order and the time you receive your food. Tip: The bathrooms are a behind a secret trap door. See if you can find it."
/user_details?userid=Yn-ODU13uFNO_p0HZWZuXg,Nance M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Honestly, with so many portuguese places in montreal it is hard to choose. I usually go back for the service and the ambiance. It's a lot like portugal. The chicken is delicious. The fries are just the right amount of spice too. Love that they serve Superbock beer! The only reason I give it 4 stars is the fact that they serve Kraft ""italian"" salad dressing on their salads.  Besides that, great place."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"The chicken is moist and delicious and there is a secret door and super chill friendly service, hence the 4 stars. But I have to be upfront and say that usually it'd be an automatic 3 stars or lower for giving me salad with kraft (or no name) 'Italian' salad dressing on it...in a restaurant...in a Portuguese restaurant. Still in this case somehow I overlook it without hesitation. Freaking delicious chicken, crispy fries, chill family friendly environment. And a secret door. 4 stars for SURE."
/user_details?userid=hHoQiZcy0pSzM9nzdDPMEg,Jade S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"absolutely amazing, i dont know why am i so obsessed with their salad but man... ribs are delishhh and the chicken sandwich is also very very good... i agree that the food takes a little bit of time.Its a family owned restaurant and no matter how long the wait is i will return because the food tastes always great. Just writing about this restaurant i am salivating."
/user_details?userid=Ex-QoUxevVpBPsovXWb8cw,Naoufel T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I am not a big meat eater in general, I went to this place with couple friends visiting. The sandwiches were delicious, we sat at the bar by the entrance to watch the chef cooking. There are couple other good chicken options in town but this is definitely in the top three best"
/user_details?userid=D3N6XvOxMrvaE2pjvjAYFA,Paul L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Best Portuguese chicken in town. But the worst service as well. Hours vary, you have to pay cash for takeaway, interac only if you eat in (which you are supposed to know, according to the staff). Tons of attitude, they act like a bunch of gangsters ready to rumble. I hate the place but love the chicken."
/user_details?userid=GERRIWMslcP4-O6mLErPSQ,Melissa F.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,Good chicken.Everything else is just noise.  Just get your food to go - there isn't much in terms of ambience.
/user_details?userid=t5x15lo8kicUKnyUeQkaCA,François L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"The chicken is pretty good, but the service ruins it. At the takeout counter, I ordered a sandwich at 5:50, it was ready at 6:30. Yes, it takes them 40 minutes to make a sandwich, seriously. They like to believe it's because they're popular, but in fact it's just because they're so badly disorganized, and they spend more time fooling around than actually working. Fries were cold. Salad dressing was store-bought Kraft vinaigrette. The kitchen is so dirty, you're lucky if you don't get salmonella.There's about a dozen Portuguese restaurants in the area where they can fix you a good sandwich in less than a minute, without the attitude, and for much cheaper. So do yourself a favour and leave these clowns alone."

/user_details?userid=g37Y_WmgPcJI9bf_kPV2Og,Elise K.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,"My foodie boyfriend brought me here in Montreal for some good eats.  Indeed the food was excellent, but the service was lacking.We split a chicken, fries, and a salad.  The meal was also served with delicious Portuguese bread. (The bread is the best part)....We were seated right away and the decor is cute.  I hear the carry out is really good, but I've never tried it.  The service problem is as follows...We wanted to order squid, but it takes 40 minutes... so we ordered chicken... it took 40 minutes.... should have ordered the squid!  We were a bit ignored as there were family members in the restaurant.  I had ordered a diet coke, but some how was served a sprite.  We also ordered coffee after our meal - that took another 30 minutes of balking just to get.  Good food, bad service!"
/user_details?userid=i-rfAdH3NLw9fzLlkc1P8w,Jay K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Used to be my go to place for Portugese. Service here is pretty rude and terrible, been coming here for years but yet they seem to always try and find an excuse to not let me in! I do love most of their meats though. Fries are very similar to Mcdonalds fries. If service is important to you dont come here , but if not its worth a try."
/user_details?userid=8W8LDl9XHwpNE4Izsx3TpQ,Max L.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"I travel to Montreal every week and this place has become one of my few staples.The chicken and fries are fantastic (as most other places in the neighborhood are), and very consistently so.  Not a single person that I have introduced to this place wasn't eager to find another excuse to come back ASAP.They only take cash, which is a bummer, but seems pretty standard compared to other places.You can actually sit down and order the food like a regular restaurant OR call ahead for a delivery (usually takes about 30-45 min) and pick up. Dining in is great, as you get the Portuguese beer, bread and olives to keep you busy as you wait for your order (grilled calamari is out of this world! but sometimes requires 40min (worth it) to heat up the grill).These guys are straight out of Portugal and know what they are doing.  I plan on putting their chicken head to head with Romado's to see who is Montreal's true chicken champion!"

/user_details?userid=6cQJOSVk5wWy4brYoYmGnw,Oggie B.,"Somerville, MA",4 star rating,"Great no-frills Portuguese at a good price. A little difficult to get the lay of the land first.  When we visited in Sept 09, they were having some issues with the city as far as getting a new sign put up, so it was hard for us to find the resto.  Then, when we walked in, we were greeted by a huge grill loaded with chickens (they do a mean take-out business, it turns out).  The dining room was actually tucked in around the corner, a new addition to their grill/store-front.  But once we were in there, it was a pleasant little place to have a meal.We didn't try the rotisserie chicken, which is apparently the draw.  Instead, my dining companions and I focused on their other meat offerings: the steak, the mixed (pork) grill and the chourico.  Everything was excellent and authentic.  And maybe it's because I'm a Bostonian and just used to paying a lot to dine out, but the prices were ridiculously  low.  Service was casual and friendly.  Can't wait to take my parents here, if they ever agree to come to Montreal with me again."
/user_details?userid=6-1XSOw9dZ1KTbzCnSXC_w,Nikolaos N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I recently read a review of this establishment in the mirror, which gave it a sub-stellar review. So I decided to give my two cents on the place. I went after a Moroccan friend of mine recommended it to me claiming it to have well priced, well cooked, and well seasoned meat. So we gave it a shot.Food Quality/Price - 3.5/5I had the assorted meats which included pork, quail and beef. I was asked if I wanted in spicy, and I did so ask for it that way. I believe it was well seasoned and well cooked. The portions were ample and the prices fair.Ambiance/Service - 4/5I was very surprised by the ambiance and service. The unlike the mirror, I found the mural to be cute and appropriate.  And the hidden the bathrooms was a nice added charm. Overall - B +I would definitely go back. If good cheap meat is want your after you'll get it at  Rotisserie Portugalia."
/user_details?userid=LZUdcQyLL7O7muaL6Dzalw,Dave B.,"Douglas, MI",5 star rating,What a great find! The tapas are wonderful. The grilled calimari (takes 45 minutes) is so worth the wait. Order a bunch of other things and it will show up as the highlight of your meal. The quail is excellent and the chorizo was a treat. I wish we were here long enough to try more dishes. Service was excellent and very casually friendly. It was also the most affordable meal we have had in Montreal.

Don't try to eat there, it's very very small, crowded and noisy."
