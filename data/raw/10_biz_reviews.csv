/user_details?userid=h5eVBQ5DyrpnQOaJ9ycl3g,Shiyue X.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've never been to the physical location, but during this pandemic, my need for Poutine went sadly unanswered, so I ordered some. Boy oh boy had I been missing out during the past 4 years of living in Montreal! The poutines I've had since (la Royale, le Fred Caillou and le reggae) have all been surprisingly different and amazingly delicious. The food comes in those small, square takeout boxes which made me feel disappointed because it didn't seem like a lot. Oh was I ever wrong! That small box is jam packed to the she and leaking out! Once I got it out on a plate, it was almost overflowing! I've tried their hamburgers too and if that's not the cutest, juiciest little 5$ burger, I don't know what is. Basically, I finally understand the hype and I've been craving it almost daily since. Looks like it's time to order a Poutine!"
/user_details?userid=2LptcvhkcFyNXT_NZDPpaQ,Luca M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Poutine loyalties and rivalries in Montreal run deep but I won't partake in those, and will enjoy a good, filing poutine when I feel that unmistakeable urge to consume comfort food. La Banquise is good enough to warrant me forcing my visiting friends to walk a couple of kilometres in any weather and potentially stand in line, in order to sample their creations. I have even driven there from home for pick-up, and had a chance to appreciate their sci-fi pager-pod order notification system. Efficient and no-nonsense.Let's begin with the obvious: unless you know your stomach stretches like an accordion, don't order a large poutine for one. Proficient out-of-town eaters have gazed with awe,  reverence and maybe a touch of incredulity on my large T-Rex upon its arrival at the table.Vegetarian tastes are abundantly catered for and the atmosphere is wonderfully complemented by an alcohol license and the consequent Québécois beer selection. Nothing that would impress a micro-brewpub, but a good complement to the carby comfort food before you nonetheless.Considering the enormous customer  throughput and selection, I think La Banquise is worth a trek from anywhere within a two mile radius, and an Uber ride from most other places. Whether it's your dinner spot or you budgeted these calories into your evening by having a light dinner and first rounds of beers somewhere else, come one, come all.If you're dining in: come, eat, be merry and get out, as there's plenty of people waiting!"

The poutine was layered with toppings, not just on top. And lavishly sauced, yes please! Can't say I've ever had so many weird choices of unexpected toppings and flavors that just still leave my mouth watering. Even reheated as leftovers was still bomb. Service was friendly and fast regardless of the line being out the door and packed like sardines on a cold pre-Covid Montreal night. A total experience and can't wait to go back"
/user_details?userid=KcFMI-hsr2Em7whfI4OM5g,Katya P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Been in Montreal forever but never tried this joint until recently. We got two large orders of the ""Scooby"" and ""Savoyeur"" poutine. They feature toppings like bacon, minced beef, fried pickles, ceasar sauce or sour cream.I was at the take out counter and saw only two container sizes, regular and large. The regular seems too small and large ended up being way too large for one person, and I can usually eat a lot. $40 later for two orders, this is on the expensive side for fries. The toppings were generous, but the cheese curds were not. You get a mountain of fries and something about the sauce is just lacking in salt, it is slightly too sweet for my liking.Perhaps this is the kind of thing to consume in moderation, it left me with a sickly feeling and just not worth the price or wait to get your food.Try it once if you must but if you love poutine, there are a lot better choices elsewhere."
/user_details?userid=fbRdDZciw4Y8pgujgbwEMg,Karen L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Such a staple to bring friends who are visiting Montreal to. However, the line ups are kind of crazy which is the main reason for my lower stars. On a hot summer's day or a colder winter day, it's rough when there isn't a way to make a reservation or grab a number (and return later on when a table frees up). And most of Montreal's either a pretty hot or cold day save for the 4 weeks or so of spring/fall each year. The food itself is good and the portions are hefty. They also have a wide variety of toppings that's pretty novel."

We love coming here as it's so close to home. Love their Fred calliou and the the shootout! So flavorful with all the meats and we get some extra gravy/sauce. Their servers are so sweet always!

How can you go wrong with crispy fries, gravy, and meat?!Well, to begin with, my meat and gravy were overly salty, for me... But still edible.What gave me a bad taste was the customer service to be honest, and I'm not sure if it's just a Montréal thing, but since I didn't speak French I felt like I was left on the back burner.Maybe I will visit this place again when I touch up on my French.Can't say I hated the place, but also can't say I loved it, so I'll be fair and stay in the middle."
/user_details?userid=XODoytYipc9zy6Wx9MnebQ,Alice A.,"Sacramento, CA",4 star rating,"Authentic poutine!!And they have a vegan version? Hell yass. There is always a line but totally worth it! This place is pretty party friendly as you can bring your group of friends to dine here. To top it off, the prices are very reasonable with most items under 10. I ordered a regular sized and my SO ordered the large sized poutine. The gravy was definitely the star of this show. The vegan cheese was a bonus. If you have not had La Banquise poutine, then you have not yet had real poutine. Come check it out!"
/user_details?userid=Dt_h4Dt0lVblqRxLLV25YQ,Julie L.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"You can easily spot La Banquise from the light yellow exterior and the line up on both sides of the entrance. One queue is for takeaway and the other is for seating. The takeaway line usually goes quicker. I'm told their prime time is 3am, after everyone is done with the bars and clubs - so prepare for the wait if you're planning to hit up this place after a night out. Once seated, the servers will take your order and kindly ask for you to pay the bill first to make things easier since they're so busy. Here is why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5. When the server brought our receipts over, there are two tip amounts indicated on the receipt for you to choose from. One of the members of our party had just enough for his poutine and a little bit of change, but not enough to cover the minimum tip amount. The server pointed this out right away saying that he has to pay the minimum tip amount (and he wasn't exactly nice about it). I personally didn't like the idea of this. Although I'm sure 99% of us tip everywhere we go, tip is customary but it is not mandatory. It is based on the service, which tbh wasn't that great.Now onto the food - they have over 30 different variations of poutine. It'll be hard to choose but guaranteed that they'll all be delicious. It's fries, gravy, cheese and a bunch of other toppings - cheap, greasy food! What's not to love? :P The first time I went, we all got our own poutine and it was way too much. The portions were huge. This time around, I got a regular to share with my boyfriend and it was perfect for the two of us."
/user_details?userid=X_y7ie2wPylfH9McMcJULg,Joel J.,"Queens, NY",3 star rating,"Was lucky enough on my trip to Montreal to have 2 well reviewed poutine places right nearby. We came by here to try their poutine since we saw such good reviews. I had already tried the chicken one from Ma Poule Mouillee so decided to try the beef and hotdog one from here. It came out fairly quickly and we went home to try it out. I thought the food was good but a bit too salty for my taste and didnt seem like anything too special. My friend liked his but also didn't seem too crazy about it. Other thing would be that it was sitting in the container for the 5 minute ride home. I dont think it would make that much of a difference but maybe that affected its taste? Seeing all the other reviews, I feel like I need to give this place another shot at some point to try other poutines that they have. Would consider swinging by again."
/user_details?userid=DkvaAV7F4Y_rw040k0XGvQ,Wilma R.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I don't typically like poutine but the fact that this spot is open 24/7 and has so many different poutine creations swayed my opinion. I came with a group of friends after being at the club and the wait was around 15-20min to get in (there was a lineup outside). By the time we were seated and had ordered, the line had doubled, so the place is obviously pretty popular amongst locals. I ordered La Taquise which was sour cream, guacamole and tomatoes and I loved it because I love tacos lol. The ""regular"" portion is huge, I took some home because it was too much, even with my hungry self after a night of dancing. They also have regular breakfast and general dishes on the menu if you're not keen for poutine."
/user_details?userid=RJH925_Ci598EuRx9JoGwA,Kathy X.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,"When in Montreal, eat poutine! I came here with a group of 6 friends for lunch on Saturday and it was approximately a 40-minute wait. The time went by pretty quickly and could tell that the staff was really efficient in getting people in and out. The interior is actually somewhat roomy - They really use the space well. There are brick walls, yellow and orange color scheme, along with winding tree branches on the ceiling. It's wacky and colorful decor, with a comfortable and bustling atmosphere. Once we were seated, I asked our waiter if he would be able to charge my cell phone because we had a full day of sightseeing planned after lunch. He accommodated the request which I very much appreciated.The menu of poutine options is quite extensive. I had a tough time choosing between La Royale (pulled pork, bacon + apples) and La T-Rex (ground beef, pepperoni, bacon + hot dog sausage). I asked the waiter for his opinion and he suggested La Royale because that is a unique combination that won't be found anywhere else. I am not a fan of gravy over my fries, so I ordered it sans gravy. All of us got the regular size poutine option, which was still humongous! There was a ton of deliciously crispy french fries, melty cheese curds, a fair amount of pulled pork which was tasty, tender and full of flavor. The bacon wasn't crunchy enough for me and I didn't feel there were enough apples in the dish. I believe I would have been more satisfied with La T-Rex. I was able to try some of my friends' poutine and I enjoyed the one with hot dog sausage. The hot dog was really juicy and seasoned well. I didn't really like the one with smoked meat - The combination of the meat and gravy didn't agree with me. I would probably try another poutine restaurant next time I am in Montreal, but I wouldn't mind returning here to have the La T-Rex!"

Honestly, I wasn't impressed. It was really bland. I think this place is overly hyped out. So let's give a second chance, I decided to order through UberEats this spring season. The experience of the poutine this time, was slightly better. I ordered La Taquise, which is vegetarian. Topped with Guacamole, tomato and sour cream. I felt the taste was missing the zing. The Banquise is super popular, so I assume their other poutines are good. As their vegetarian options, they need to bring couple of notches up with its flavor."

/user_details?userid=Q2euBRlNqfn4C1D635hNnw,Eric L.,"East Brunswick, NJ",4 star rating,"I have had poutine more times than I can remember as a former resident of Montréal. From the cafeteria in the engineering building at McGill to burger King on St. Catherine's across from the Bay. There is just something happy about this wonderful French Canadian comfort food. It certainly made me happy when I was feeling anxiety about taking finals as a student. Having deeper pockets these days, the Bank is my go to spot for poutine when I'm in Montréal. Having had the poutine here and then a few days later at anothee well regarded eatery (Radio Cafe in Beaupré Quebec) really helped me to appreciate just how good the quality of the poutine is at the Bank. They weren't remotely comparable.The smoked meat poutine remains my favorite. Something about how the smoked meat flavor enhances the poutine gravy taste without adding a ton of grease like sausage would. On a carefree non health conscious day this might be my favorite meal in the world. The vegetarian poutine was also tops, especially if you add some chopped spicy peppers to the dish. I had to take a star off my review for our waitress, however. We had leftovers yet she stacked our bowls one on top of another. I called her out regarding contaminating our food and yet she still denied wrongdoing. ""The food doesn't touch"" she said.I know the Bank gets super hectic and is probably a tough place to work but cmon!"

Thanks for the recommendation, I'll give that a try if I'm ever in the mood...haha...Well I tried it tonight  and the poutine was delicious. The fries were crisp and tasty, the gravy  was silky smooth and tasted great, even the sliced hotdog on top was good. OK I see what the excitement is about.

Sooo many different types of poutine.. there are other food choices as well but if you're not coming for the poutine then don't bother. Usually a long line up but the turnover is quite quick and our table of 6 was seated within 20 minutes on a busy Sunday evening. Service is fine. Every time we visit Montreal, this is a go to spot. Can range from $9-20 depending on toppings and size (regular or large). French fries are fresh. Only downfall is parking is not great. Limited street parking."

I had my heart set on the classic but my eyes wandered to the La Matty. It was delicious. For the classic, I wish they added more cheese curds and gravy since it was on the drier side. The fries for both were on the softer side (I prefer the fries a little more well done). Your order arrives to the table along with the bill, which will need to be settled prior to stuffing your face."

Go straight for the Classic Poutine, or better yet, if you're vegan, get the Classic Vegan Poutine! Whether or not you're vegan, both options are AMAZING. We didn't understand why having fries for a meal was a thing, so we ordered a burger as well. For our first meal in Montréal, La Banquise was a major win! The gravy and the cheese curds... omg. If you like creamy things, you're gonna love this! The burger should not be overlooked either! The way they make the patty competes with how good Shake Shack makes theirs!The place is tiny, you have your kitchen which you can see, the dining room, the small waiting area, and the pick-up area.

The ambiance is a little tight because this place is always full. So no private conversation.I always go with friends or partner because we let each other try and have different combination. The price are affordable the place like I said is always full but its also tight. They have a very small restaurant and the space is limited. Every time I went to place was packed and people were waiting outside including myself. You hope it dont start to rain.The tables are very colourful and full of art.

The poutine was pretty good, and for the smaller size, it was pretty damn sizeable so beware. The gravy wasn't too thick and gelatinous (cough, smokes poutinerie, cough), I felt it was a touch sweet though, possibly because of the onion in it. Either way it was super good. The hot dog I ordered steamed, with no toppings cause I'm boring. It was also fairly good, nothing revolutionary obviously.I'd recommend La Banquise if you're looking for a poutine fix anytime day or night."

Full, really full. Heaping portions of poutine.La banquise, which translates ""the ice"" in French (I've also been told it means ""benches"" in Québécois) has nothing to do with ice, and even the soft drinks don't come on the rocks. La Banquise, despite the name, is all about the hot poutine.I took on a large portion of La Festival: Ground beef, swiss cheese, hot peppers & topped with onion rings.  Or, shall I say, drowned in a half-pound of ground beef, BLANKETED in Swiss cheese, covered in another layer of tongue-warming peppers, and enveloped in a top-layer of big, thick, crispy onion rings. While I would preferred a little less gravy, but the taste was superb. My wife had the Montréal Burger: Smoked meat, swiss cheese, pickle, tomatoes, lettuce, mustard, on pretzel burger bun. It's awesome. Schwartz's better watch out ... this stands toe-to-toe with their smoked meat sandwich.  And, oh yeah, hers came with a gigantic side of poutine.As for poutine, no one in Canada (IMHO) matches La Banquise in volume, taste, or selection (30+ types of poutine.

Is it the best that Canada has to offer? I can't say that it is or isn't but it's not going to disappoint that's for sure. It's like having a bad slice of pizza, you'll still eat it because how bad can the worst be? This is no where near the worst and you'll gladly enjoy every bite of it. I honestly can't say that I've ever even had bad poutine because it'll always be good enough to want to finish it anyway. There are no short comings here and the portions are pretty ridiculous in the best possible way. Be prepared to wait if you're dining in, this place usually has a line, but to-go ordering is a breeze that you may want to opt for if it's a nice day. Overwhelming choices of toppings to choose from that it'll satisfy anyone's picky eater of the party's heart.

A lot of local friends have told me there are better spots for poutine in Montreal but this is ""THE SPOT"" for late night after drinking and partying go to place to fill up on some greasy food. They are also open 24H so another reason why they are the spot for after hours. When you pull up there are usually 2 lines at the door one is for their take away counter and the second line is for dine in. When I arrived at 4am the dine in line was less than 4 people and the take away was about 15 people. The restaurant is a little crowded with lots of tables and if you have a big group be prepared to have the group split up into different tables. I ordered their poutine called the T-Rex which has sausage and ground beef in it along with the usual squeaky cheese and gravy. The gravy was very great tasting not too salty but the sausage was a little salty but I but I don't think it bothered me too much after a night of partying. They offer 2 sizes a regular and large, I opted for their regular and good thing I did because their large was served in a bowl like the ones East Side Mario serves their salad in.I will be back for some more poutine and try their other offerings of poutine."

My Canadian friend recommended this place to me, so I was pretty excited to visit. I came here in the pouring rain close to midnight on a Saturday night, and it was hopping. I figured that was a good sign, but I was wrong.I ordered La Royale, which features pulled pork, apples, and bacon. The apple adds a good tart kick to the otherwise carnivorous dish. The whole thing was too salty and heavy. The cool combination of flavors did not overcome the deficiencies in the fries, gravy, and cheese curds.I only got to try one of the poutines here though, so it's also possible that I managed to order the one thing here that's sub-par."

But your choice of toppings are what make this dish at La Banquise! I am a big fan of the hot dog and ground beef. I would recommend ordering a regular size because IMO one of these can feed two people.Service is super friendly and despite how crowded and busy this restaurant can be, they were all so attentive to us.

The poutine itself is good, however I probably wouldn't come for the classic poutine but to try a crazy variety of special types of poutine. I order la taquise, which was essentially poutine with guacamole and sour cream which was pretty good. All the meat poutines are good and probably better choices than the non-meat ones.

First couple bites were really good, but at the end it kinda hard to finish. **Take a small portion*** trust me, I'm a big guy, and there's things are filled to the top. Take a large portion for 2, but don't get cocky and take a large for one person. Have nothing to complain about this place.

The restaurant was packed and there was a huge line out the door. If you don't want to wait an hour outside in the cold, I recommend ordering take out. You should get your food in 10-15 minutes. I ordered the Grand size, and it was huge. It could easily feed 3 people. Since it was my first time having poutine, I don't really have anything to compare it to. There was plenty of hotdogs, cheese and gravy. The fries were not overly crispy at all, and the flavor of the gravy was mild. The hotdog quality was not as good as nathans or sabrett. What really made me upset was my food was ready, and was sitting there for 15+ minutes. I called in my order, and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. I got there within 15 minutes, and it still wasn't ready, which was fine. I paid and stood nearby so they would call me when it was ready. There was a takeout bag behind the register for 20 minutes. People who ordered their food after me (in person) got their food already. When I confronted them about my order, turns out it was that bag that sat behind the counter. No apologies, at all. My fries were lukewarm and soggy by the time I got back to my hotel that was 5 minutes away. I was very disappointed. Overall, this is the type of food you would eat after going drinking. The quality is what you pay for. You get a lot of food for your buck. I recommend calling in your order, but make sure they dont forget about you."

Also ordered a pogo which is just a corndog to you and I because my friend liked them, too. Lots of colorfully painted walls and tables.  Loved the feel there.  They even had branches sprawling on the ceiling itself!  Friendly wait staff. We left stuffed.

Quebec, in general does poutine well and here at La Banquise is no exception. I don't know how they cook their fries, but good poutine starts with a solidly good fries, cheese curds (that squeaks!!) and correct thickness of gravy.On this visit, my friends and I ordered:1. The Taquise (guacamole, sour cream and tomatoes) - light and fresh taste2. The Elvis (ground beef, peppers and mushrooms) - it didn't look good, but more than made up for it in taste3. The Panoramix (smoked meat, mushrooms and sour cream) - highlight of this visit. Anytime smoked meat is added in anything while in Montreal, I usually try. This did not disappoint!!! I was a bit iffy about the addition of sour cream, but it cut through the heaviness of smoked meat and gravy.There's always a line up here, so be prepared to wait. The staff are amazingly efficient and friendly.TIP: come between meal times, the line is manageable. We came around 3pm on a Saturday and only waited 20 mins."

My friend got our poutines to go when we saw the long wait for a table. I got the Le Mart which had hotdog, bacon and mushrooms. You get a fairly large portion even for the ""regular portion"". The poutine came piled high with all the ingredients. I had to eat down till I got to the fries and cheese curds. It was delicious! The gravy is thick and the cheese curds were plenty.

There's more than 30 types of poutines available but they also have burgers, hot dogs, salads, breakfast, desserts and drinks. They even have their own beer. - La trois viande ($16.00 large) - ground beef, pepperoni and bacon. This was really salty. - La Rachel ($14.40 large) - green peppers, mushroom and onions.

They make their own vegan gravy :') We ordered the Rachel, which was like a normal poutine but with onions, peppers and mushrooms. Fantastic. An amazing drunk food. I woke up the next morning wanting more. There was a perfect amount of gravy and cheese. The balance was great and they give you a lot of food for the large. (The photo may not be too pretty, but it was so so good)For a large, it was around 16$, which isn't too bad. Personally, I think the large is worth the money considering the small is pretty small.

Overall, no complaints. La Panoramix was equally good with the extra toppings adding extra flavor that all worked well together.They serve beer here (and cider) so, we both ordered a bottle.

There were three people already seated on the inside. We ordered our drinks and poutine. I ordered La Sud-Ouest (Southwest) and my friend ordered La Classique (the classic), but then changed from cheese curds to mozzarella. La Sud-Ouest has bacon, red onions,  guacamole,  onion rings and a chipotle sauce. The onion rings were surprisingly crispy on top of the guacamole and with the chipotle sauce drizzled on. That means that they were cooked to order. The guacamole was very creamy. I usually like chunkier guac, but it actually worked best as creamy for the poutine because of the other ingredients.

I was surprised to see a big line up outside a poutine restaurant. We got inside in 15 minutes. You have option to either sit inside or backyard patio. We decided the patio, as weather was amazing. They don't serve beer in patio, only inside. They serve over 30 varieties of Quebec's classic dish. My wife is vegetarian, so we decided to share a large vegetarian poutine. I must say it was finger licking good. Who doesn't love soggy fries with chewy cheese curds? It was a perfect combination of perfectly done fries, fresh cheese curds, gravy and sautéed veggies. We both loved it, it was very yummy and satisfying. I also tried ginger beer( non alcoholic), that was the best ginger beer I have ever tried, it was so refreshing. I will definitely go back and will recommend it to everyone. Because you have to try poutine at least once when you go to Montreal, so you might as well try the BEST !"

Open 24/7 I could see this place was popular with both daytime and nighttime crowds, a beacon of hope and refuge for the drunk, stoned, or all of the above.More than 30 poutines are available for feasting. As a first-timer I was restrained in my order, opting for the classic poutine, known as La Classique. No poutine here is for the faint of heart (or stomach) but this was a way to get my fix without tempting cardiac arrest on my first night in the city. I had a week of Montreal binge-eating to tackle, after all.As one would expect, the mix of hot, crispy, and salty fries topped with cheese and thick gravy was delicious. The cheese squeaked and the sauce was plentiful and not overly salty. There was a smoky aftertaste from the gravy that La Banquise is lauded for. The fries were piping hot, as expected from a place that has a bustling crowd and has to keep the food and drinks flowing at all hours of the day and night. The regular portion was formidable and was in fact large enough for sharing. ""Let's get a burger as a side dish"" is something that came out of my mouth when ordering, so we did. The standard Cheese Burger was small and simple and having a taste vaguely reminiscent of the McDonald's burger lineup. Based on other Yelp reviewer photos perhaps one of their specialty burgers with additional toppings and different meats would have been better, but the volume of food would have been overwhelming.To wash all of this goodness down I ordered a Lemoncocco, a non-carbonated drink with lemon and coconut flavors. For those going the alcoholic route there is a large menu of local microbrews, including La Banquise golden pilsner ale.I wondered about the name, as 'La Banquise' has to do with ice and they're not serving ice cream here. Apparently they did in the beginning, however, back when they opened in the 1960's. The poutine element came in the 1980's and was a hit ever since, prompting them to expand their menu significantly in the years that followed.As someone not used to eating poutine, it was a little surreal to look around and see everyone face-deep in a plate of fries for dinner, especially when they were smothered in even more stuff like guacamole, hot peppers, and multiple varieties of sausages. The dining room itself sports vividly colored walls and cactus and flower-themed table art which adds another creative and endearing layer and may help explain how La Banquise manages to stand out and attract lineups year in and year out in the heart of what's probably the world's most competitive poutine scene. La Banquise's reputation makes it a must-visit on any trip to Montreal, and if there's any place to enjoy poutine whether a first timer or an enthusiastic fan of the dish, it's here."

Amongst the loud crowds, they would notice you speaking English to your friends, and kindly offer you English menus instead of the French ones.The food however was a little underwhelming? My vision of poutine is crunchy fries soaked in gravy and melting curds. But the curds were hard, solid and stuck together, not even melted. The fries weren't even good... neither crunchy and crispy (for the parts that weren't soaked, nor thick and chewy). Disappointed for a place that specializes in fries.Note that your clothes will smell like grease after so wear something that's easily washable."

That's when they told us that they cannot accommodate us and the only way they would serve us was if we went back to the takeout line which went all the way past the storefront.And the best part was that the classic poutine came with very flimsy fries and mediocre gravy (or sub-par, but that might just be because I was bitter about it).PS This was my second visit. I really didn't enjoy the poutine on my first visit."

/user_details?userid=I0qUNP9bMUNvlE7fWhvgsA,Stephanie Y.,"Austin, TX",3 star rating,I believe this place is considered a tourist trap but we didn't care- we wanted to try their crazy poutine concoctions! We got the reggae to go and headed to the nearby park to eat it and enjoy being outside. I liked that it was different from regular poutine but it also made me crave the classic. Overall it was a good size but I wish there were more toppings for a more balanced fry ratio. It was a nice place to try but not the best poutine. If you want the best poutine ever then you have to go to ***Paradis BBQ*** I know it might seem strange to go to a chicken spot for poutine but seriously...if our Airbnb host did not tell us about it we would have never known. Their chicken and mashed potatoes are amazing too but their POUTINE omg.

/user_details?userid=ovlGqjFBz2mSgHObWSIUOw,Jamerson W.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"Maybe it's psychological. The anticipation of standing in line for 40 minutes increases both the appetite and heightens expectations, leaving the customer in a state of euphoria or setting her/him up for utter disappointment. I definitely fell into the former category. First let me say that, although it was rainy and cold as nipples, I adored Montreal. It reminded me a lot of Chicago, which is my favorite city in the universe. And every great city has to have a hook. For Chi, it's deep dish pizza. For Montreal, it seems to be poutine. And La Banquise reminds me a lot of Giordano's, the popular deep dish pizzeria. They didn't invent it, but they sure did popularize it. La Banquise is fun. Graffiti decorates the walls, while pop culture decorates the tables, and epic pop music (so bad, it's good) decorates the airwaves. Our experience was part art diner, part sing-along, and part heart attack on a plate. The tricky part is that we don't eat meat, yet they are clear on what's vegan, what's veggie-friendly, and what has meat parts. So, that was our main motivation in going here. I got the veggie burger, which was satisfying enough, but clearly no one goes to La Banquise for a burger. The poutine is the focal point. We got one that wasn't listed on the website, but dons the wall. And it was soooooo good. Maybe it's just because cheese and gravy makes everything taste better. If they opened up one of these in the states, I'd be there in a heart...beat."

The place was packed despite it being 10 PM - apparently this place is always busy. I placed my order for takeout because the restaurant was full and also there was no AC inside... On the day I went their fridge had broken down so they didn't have all the ingredients to make every type of poutine, but they had their basics and I just wanted the classic...they have vegan and vegetarian options which are made with mushroom gravy - and if you want vegan cheese curds they have that for an added price. There is quite a bit of a wait to get the food - I would say at least 10-15 minutes, but it's well worth the wait. The poutine is prepared fresh and tastes amazing. The fries were crispy, the gravy was hefty and satisfying, and the cheese curds were salty and perfectly mixed together. Definitely check out this place if you have time!"

The service, décor and even the nice stone tiled bathrooms get a three, but per their 'famous' dish that people stand in line for (almost all the time) - pretty disappointing. In summary, the fries were fine and even above average, but then it just goes sideways. The gravy was blah, and was hard to find as maybe it contained a half or small ladle's worth. The cheese curd was the most disappointing part of it; a minimal portion, too dense and no 'squeak' factor. I don't think I have to go on much further to justify my rating, and yes I'm aware it's on most tourism lists, and surely fits the bill as a late night junk food place - being open 24 hours and all. Again, the overall is more than a two star experience, but I think that it needs to be pointed out that there are many many better Tradition Poutines around town, and dare I say across the country.

Most recommended La Banquise. I found out why. Craving some smoked meat, the logical choice of poutine was L'Obelix. The cheese curds are the star as they start to melt from the heat of the fries and gravy. Paired with a local provincial beer, it was the perfect meal before catching a hockey game at the Bell Center. I enjoyed it so much, I went back again later in the week to try another poutine (La Rachel-green pepper, mushroom, onion). I think I was deprived a guiltless pleasure in my youth."

With poutineries all over the city it can make it challenging for a visitor to find the best spot. After reading a few reviews la banquise was the winner for me and my friends. We arrived around 11:30 with no line at all which was great. We sat got sat immediately to what seemed like the last open table in this super busy spot. It has the vibe of a diner being open 24Hr and  a menu of basic crowd pleasing food. What is not basic is the long list of the many poutines they offer. The portions are really big and with me not being a huge gravy fan I decided just to steal a couple bites off my friends poutine. She ordered the classic poutine and I ordered a hot dog with cheese. The food came out very quickly and it was good. Like I previously mentioned I am not a huge fan of gravy so the amazingness of poutine is a bit lost on me. But for what is it it hit the spot. I asked for my hot dog well done and it wasn't crispy at all but it was still tasty. When we left the line was very long to get in so if you are planning to check this spot out come a little before the lunch rush begins or prepare to wait.

I hadn't planned on going up towards Plateau area, but La Banquise brought me there in search of Quebecois take on Poutine. This place was definitely a fed the masses kinda place, and quite honestly, I don't know if I enjoy this place sober, or if I would have enjoyed it a bit more after a long drunken night of shenanigans. I tried the Panoramix. It was a toss up between that, or the Scooby, which the person next to me ended up ordering, and I was a little jealous. I ordered the Panoramix as I didn't get a chance to add a smoked meat place into my trip, so in killing two birds with one stone-- It sufficed. It's a gargantuan amount of food, even for the smaller portion. It really indulges the US quantity in portion sizing. It was a beautiful day, so we fully took advantage of the back patio along with a lot of others. It did not disappoint! The servers were also very courteous and kind, despite me trying my hardest, but ma francais est terrible!La Banquise hit the spot, and the best part is that Parc la Fontaine is less than a skip away, so go work off some of that gluttony with a walk around the ponds!Overall it was a good experience-- I don't know if I would have condoned waiting for a long time to eat here, and it certainly isn't busy during the week days."

It is definitely more expensive poutine, but well worth it for the amount of food you get and the ingredients they add. I actually preferred La Reggae because of the guac and it was somewhat lighter than La Matty. I would definitely recommend something with a guacamole or sour cream topping. The only reason La Banquise loses a star is because it is ALWAYS busy. Expect to wait at least 30 minutes for a seat inside. The place is very casual and has a very generic interior, but great for groups. However, I ONLY recommend being seated at the restaurant for the patio during the summer.

(why settle for anything but the best,  amirite?!) Unfortunately,  I assumed people would be done eating by 730pm, and when I arrived,  there was a line up out the door.  Luckily, there are 2 separate lines; one for dine in and one for take out (there is clear signage indicating this on the door and on the window. As you're facing the door,  right hand side is the dine in line, your left is the take out line). The take out line was much shorter and it meant I didn't have to stand out in the freezing cold, so I chose to take out instead.  They have a pretty extensive menu, but I opted for the classic poutine. You have your choice between regular and large sizes (take out containers are made of cardboard btw, for all you environmental minded folks).  I ordered the regular size,  and they fill the containers pretty generously,  so I was quite satisfied afterwards. Didn't take long for me to get my poutine and go.  By this time,  everyone that was waiting to be seated was at a table,  probably because most of the diners were finishing up their meals and leaving.  As I was leaving,  there were still lots of people walking in.  The place is open 24/7, which is awesome for those late night grease fixes. I picked at some of the fries while it was still warm.  Fries were crispy, which is a must when drenched in La Banquise's thick, flavorful gravy.  And the curds! Deliciously squeaky! They do not cheap out on the curds and it was all melted by the gravy. (unmelted curds are my pet peeve) I wish I had this fresh in the restaurant,  as I feel like getting it as take out took away from the experience,  ...and the wind chill cooled my poutine off pretty quick that I'm sure it was way better hot.  I'd come back again to try this out the right way. Cash (US or CAD) or debit only.  They don't accept old 50 dollar bills either.  Free wifi available. About 10 min walk from metro station. (Mont Royal stop)"

They also have other dishes like burgers, chips, etc. I went to La Banquise 3 times and I was never disappointed. I'll recommend these poutine dishes with smoked meat and some kinds of meat. Really a good choice.A bonus point for La Banquise might be its cozy atmosphere during the winter, open 24/7.And obviously, there will be a long waiting line. Anyway, enjoy your meal! It's a must in Montreal."

It was especially delicious after having a couple of drinks, hah. Came around 1:30am which our Uber driver said was the perfect time v. 3am when all the bars let out. We had the La Maim & La Panoramix. Personally, my bf & I liked the La Maim better. The sausage used paired nicely in the combination. We each ordered regular size, ate all of the La Maim since we wanted this most fresh, took home leftovers of the Panoramix, and 100% ate that the next night. One criticism is it was a tad too greasy and lost a bit of the fries taste, but it was too good I didn't mind it as much.Loved the spacious seating! Be sure to bring cash in the local currency & be prepared to pay ahead of receiving your meal."

The tables are close together and the noise level is high but it all plays into the Banquise atmosphere with stellar music as well. The poutine is hands down the best. My hubby had the smoked meat poutine and it was a fresh slice of heaven. I had La Matty which had peppers, onions, mushrooms, and bacon and there was a different flavor xombo with each bite...delish! We opted for the regular and I struggled to finish.  Definitely worth a visit!!"

The Montreal stout here was great!When I visit Montreal in the future I will still probably find other poutine places to compare instead of coming back here though.Overall a definite must for a first timer in Montreal!Oh yeah, a very odd thing here...each time you purchase a beer, or another food item on the menu, you have to pay immediately (yes this is a full sit-down service restaurant). So every time I ask the server for another beer, I have to pay with cash or with a Canadian debit card immediately! I've never seen this anywhere else in the world i've traveled to!No American debit/credit cards accepted and no Canadian credit cards accepted. Only Canadian Cash or Canadian Debit cards accepted."

I've lived in poutine country (upstate New York) for 10 years now but didn't see how this fat-on-fat extravaganza could do anything but clog your arteries. But the Classique opened my eyes as well. The salty beef (?) gravy, firm cheese curds and excellent fries were in perfect harmony, much like lettuce, tomato and onion on a nice greasy burger.By way of comparison my teen, a fries fanatic, ordered the Savoyard with bacon and onions and couldn't finish it.

I know there are limited on street parking.La Banquise have 30 different poutine to choose from and an additional vegan cheese and sauce! Their poutine ranges $7.95 to $19.65 depending on the size and which toppings you get. A regular size honestly fills you up - there were 9 of us and all of us can't even finish a regular size. If you get a poutine with meat on it, they load it up with a lot! I got the La Taquise and it wasn't as heavy as the other ones as it has guacamole, sour cream and tomatoes. Honestly, it could be better as the cheese curds weren't melted even thought I mixed it with the gravy. If I were to come back, I'll definitely share with someone."

The options range from the classic to ones with a fusion of flavours from different cultures.VERDICT: I recommend but expect to wait in line.My friends and I ordered the Rachel, the Reggae, and the La Savoyarde. All are delicious. The Reggae was my favourite as it had a lot of freshness from the avocado and tomatoes. As a result, it did not feel as heavy as the others. The Rachel was more savoury to me than the La Savoyarde. The onions are grilled very well with a delicious caramelised flavour.The service is quick and efficient. We arrived right around dinner time and only waited 10 minutes to be seated. Our server was very friendly and attentive. Casual vibe filled with locals and tourists at any given time of the day."

The gravy was amazing and all the toppings were tasty.  I recommend ordering the regular size if you are by yourself as they are quite generous with their portions.  By the time I left the restaurant, there were about 20 people waiting in line outside.

After we got seated and ordered I noticed there was a fast wave of people coming here. There's a lottttaaa stuff on the menu and you might get overwhelmed so check up yelp for pics for reference. The waitress we had was very attentive and checked up on us every so often and filling our water. After 11pm I think is when they tell you to pay after you order - makes sense. They have no problems splitting the bill as well. I ordered the regular bougaloo which is the pulled pork poutine with coleslaw and a huge slab of sour cream on top of it. This place has huge portions. I couldn't finish my poutine! I wasn't a fan of the sour cream, only had a bit. It was too heavy for my liking. The coleslaw I didn't like at first, but after mixing it with the sauce, I think it tasted better so that combo was good. The pulled pork was good and had a lot of flavour. Fries.. not bad. I've had better fries at other places but it was still good. As for drinks, I got a ginger beer (non alcoholic) and it very refreshing with the poutine. Fair warning: it is more on the spicier ginger side.  Overall, good food and service. I'm glad I finally got to try the famous poutine place in Montreal! Will come back to try other poutines and I love how it's opened 24 hr!"

The gravy was great and our cheese curds melted too and were really stringy! We also got a burger to share ""all-dressed"". We didn't realize that meant it came with mustard (instead of ketchup) so we didn't really enjoy it.The service was ok, no one really came to refill our waters but the food made up for it.

/user_details?userid=JwWYSaemJJR1-Sba-a8_7A,Miles C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Their poutines are perfectly good for a poutine, yes. But for the life of me, I just don't understand the complete obsession with this place or poutines in general, so perhaps I'm not even the best candidate to write a review for this. Yes, everybody loves poutine at 3am when drunk, and on a winter hangover day, or sporadically maybe a few times a year. They are particularly good at Banquise, so I will grade simply for that (good to me basically only means how squeaky and fresh the cheese remains on top - otherwise I've never really tasted a deviation from standard poutine taste.)But really, it's only worthwhile to come here and get a poutine when drunk, as a novelty to show out of towners, or on the rare occasion when you just really need one. If I wanted a burger, I'd go many other places. It's not a spot I return to very often, not only because it's always extremely busy and a long line on many days when honestly, a poutine is a poutine and many places in Montreal make theirs just as good as Banquise."

We were able to finish it because we had not eaten in like 8 hours but be warned it is a massive portion, suitable for 2 people, and it does not do the poutine justice to eat that much due to palate fatigue of the richness, the salt etc. Delicious food, worth the wait as the line moves quickly.

My wife and daughter loves this place! It was a challenge to get there this time. We arrived in Montreal in the middle of the lunch rush hour on a Friday afternoon and found it difficult to get to the Banquise because of construction and road closures. Rue Rachel is currently closed in front of the Banquise right at the moment (Mid August 2018). So we decided to try the next day on our way out and found it easier during the Saturday morning traffic to get there and find parking. Thankfully, La Banquise is 24 hours. My wife ordered the La Matty dejeurner with 2 sunny side up eggs, sautéed onions, mushrooms and green peppers along with the poutine. This dish was flavourful with the sautéed vegetables and eggs taking away the saltiness of the poutine. I ordered the Clasique to go while my daughter ordered La Bacon.

The cheese on top of the poutine was not melted which would have elevated this dish. The fries themselves however did exceed my expectations as they were fresh and crisp. I was worried the fries would be limp and soggy which I am pleased to report they are not. I wanted to stick to the classic poutine to get a real feel for this authentic dish however I noticed most of the other diners had their poutine all ""gussied up"" with a ton of toppings and may have not really tasted the gravy and cheese.The Banquesi Burger was just ok. Nothing special and next time I would skip the burger. Service was great and the place was kitschy and worth a visit."

I was super excited to check it out and even skipped dinner, hoping to fully maximize enjoyment. Seeing the line out the door confirmed its popularity. It was packed at 10 pm, even before the bar crowd got there.La Banquise definitely has the biggest menu of poutine i've ever seen. There are 20+ different options and includes many toppings that you would not normally think about putting on poutine (ie. guacamole, smoked meat, coleslaw). For the poutine-phobic, there are burgers and breakfast items as well.I ordered ""La Rachel"" which included green peppers, mushrooms and onions. While all the ingredients worked well with each other, I found it bland and underseasoned. Maybe it was my fault for not ordering a meat topping, but I thought the gravy could be more flavorful.  Good poutine, but definitely not the best i've ever had. I probably should have opted for the classic, or picked one with a flavorful protein topping. Pricing was good and portions were large. I found it weird that you had to pay up front before receiving the food. Maybe too much dine and dashing?  Anyways, I was a bit disappointed but I think it's still worth checking out to get your poutine fix."
/user_details?userid=wzA2spUhc2G1yQNNJsS8EA,Nisheet G.,"Largo, FL",4 star rating,"I don't know what else can be written about La Banquise then what's already been said. When in Montreal, you must try Poutine. What is it? In the simplest terms, it's french fries topped with gravy and cheese curds. It might sound weird and repulsive but there's something magical about crunchy, salty, and gooey goodness. Where can you find Poutine? Well, almost every restaurant sells it. However, like burgers, some restaurants do a great job at it while some are terrible. La Banquise, for me, was the best Poutine that I tried out of 5 other places.Here are my ratings based on different criteria:Quality of food: Excellent. There is just about every combination and topping that you can get on your Poutine. When I asked my waiter for his favorite, he unquestionably said La Reggae. Since he had been working there for years and sounded like he knew what he was talking about, that's the one that I went with. La Raggae comes with: ground beef, guacamole, tomatoes, and hot peppers. The guacamole was super fresh and the hot peppers really were hot. The fries were freshly fried and had just the right amount of beef on them. My Poutine was delicious!Decor: okay. With a place that is so popular for Poutine, I was expecting more history on either the restaurant or the products it sells. Sadly, there was nothing that special inside to see. There's also an area to sit outside on asphalt but you can't have beer there.Cleanliness: good. The staff did a good job keeping the place neat and tidy.Service: okay. My cup of water was filled only once and the waiter didn't ask how my food was or if I needed anything else. He did bring me the check really fast when asked.Speed of food preparation: slow. Although this is a very busy restaurant, the 3-4 ingredients that it takes to make Poutine should not take a 30 min wait.Price: a wee bit on the higher side. My Poutine was around $12 USD which was a little bit on the higher end.If you're ready to wait in line and have a so-so service experience, this is probably the best tasting Poutine place in Montreal."

I've got no issues with it. I'm just not an overall fan of poutine as a main course. It's filling (but not satisfying as a full meal) and the service is good. My friend and I share a small classic poutine. They have a lot more menu options for the more adventurous though!!! They also have cheeseburgers and hotdogs, which we didn't try.The gravy was warm and the fries were substantial. Does poutine's gravy usually melt the cheese curds? Seems like it doesn't, but if I made the rules, I think it should. We went on a very snowy day and were seated immediately."

The burger was okay, but the fried pickles and poutine were amazing! I was a bit skeptical about the poutine at first because it looked like it was doing too much, but now after I've tried it, I regret not having ordered the larger portion.

/user_details?userid=UoE2BDcztaO4tY5AagwSlA,Ed H.,"Riviere-des-Prairies—Pointe-aux-Trembles, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Okay so poutine is a staple of my diet since its basically a carb coma in a bowl with some awesome little invention called cheese curds that make everything you hate in the world fade away into obscurity for 25 minutes until you finish your little bowl of heaven and then go back to the mundane shitshow we have to call ""life"". I must mention we have a dude who is deathly allergic to wheat with us and we called in advance to see that it is gluten free here and the person on the phone said ""yep"" so we came here, otherwise we wouldnt have bothered with the enslaught of drunk asshats and short staff buffoonery that enaued.So my girlfriend took me and a group here (like 12 people) and the staff immediately threw a hissy fit about the size of our group, forcing us to sit at two opposite ends of the establishment - 6 at one table, 6 at another. Like we had no problem waiting for two adjacent tables, but it was their rush to get our money that split the group. We ordered. Literally just poutine. Just mess me up with potatoes, gravy and cheese, but then they tell my friend that the sauce is gluten free but the rest of the restaurant isn't because they use the same fryer for everything. So why did they advertise and confirm on the phone they are a gluten free place? To get a quick buck or to basically annoy me, I'm not so sure.Our poutine arrives and its adequate at best. Basically you can get better poutine at Le Belle Pro, but this is a sit down place so they upcharge you. Oh and my friend found a kitchen screw in her poutine. How, idk, but they have a saying in Hawai'i which is ""broke da mouf"" meaning its good, and I think this place took it literal instead of figuratively or the place is just falling apart period.Moral of the story is this place is an expensive joke and best left in a corner or shared with people you hate from out of country.  Way to ruin poutine, guys."

We came on a Friday night around 9pm, and the line was well out the door, however the line for eat in moves rather fast. We waited about 20 minutes before we were seated. It has a college-vibe - loud and young.Food: Ordered the regular classic and la fred caillou. Regular classic is fries, cheese curds, and gravy. The Fred Caillou was gravy, fries, cheese curds, ground beef, two types of sausages, and smoked meat. The fries here are OUTSTANDING. Crispy and flavorful, I would get them alone next time. The classic was good, although the cheese curds were a bit more rubbery than what I'm accustomed to. The gravy is smooth an adds a good touch to the fries. The Fred Caillou is a meat lover's dream, however it is incredibly heavy. I enjoyed the spicy sausage though. They also have a nice variety of sodas and beers (I love you, lemoncocco)Services: Canadian dollars or debit only. ATM in the front before you get seated.

Tried the breakfast poutine: ""la cassoulette"" loaded with sweet sweet bacon (plus sausages) and 2 eggs that screams a typical hearty breakfast, but poutine style. It met all my expectations. The potatoes were the bite size, smothered in a rich savoury gravy! Cheese curds were good but ordering an extra serving appears it be quite costly. Decor and ambiance was funky and cozy, loved it!!! Service was fast and pleasant. Never thought I'd say this, but poutine at 7.30am in the morning at la banquise was a surprisingly great way to start my morning.

The fries were well-seasoned but not overly salty, and had a nice crispness. The poutine portion was great; the regular would be a very hearty meal for one, and the large could easily fill up 2-3 alone. We also had the Chevre and the Montréal burgers; the former had a wonderfully creamy goat cheese that was delicious with the burger, while the latter was a great representation of Montréal's smoked meat. The burgers themselves were on the smaller side, but not to a fault; when combined with the regular poutine, it was just the right amount of food for us two. The place in general had a nice ambience and the waiter was very friendly, although he did awkwardly stand by our table with the bill while we pulled out our cash to pay. I would definitely come here again, especially knowing that it is open 24 hours.

I got the fully dressed hot dog which I wish they listed what fullydressed was on the menu but maybe I just missed it. The hot dog was good. Nothing spectacular. We went by the recommendation of the waitress for our poutine but I wish we stuck with a classic. I don't prefer guac on my poutine. It was really hot. My water was served with limited ice and refilled without ice. The poutine options were great, so many but with the diner feel and the push people in, push people out ""feel"", it's not something that hits home for me."

Apparently, word has caught on since there can be a long lineup that spills outside, but the Staff is efficient and keeps the line moving. Two things to remember when you line up: there is an ATM right inside at the corner of the hall (immediately to your right through the front door). Convenient! The other, is that it's a very narrow space where you line up with no sitting room. When my aunt and I got to the front of the line, we were given the option of inside or outside. You can consume alcohol inside but not out, so since were weren't, we opted for outside patio since it was sunset on the longest day of the year with a nice breeze! Our waitress spoke broken English but my aunt spoke broken French so we got along just fine! I wish I knew the waitress' name, but she was also quite helpful in directing us to the nearest Metro station as we were purely on foot. To the food: amazing!!! The menu is in both languages (yay) & I opted for the ""Trio"" of a delicious chicken burger (the veggie option was out of stock) and paid about $4 extra for authentic Poutine instead of regular French fries which I had been meaning to try all week. The combo included a soda as well and wow! My aunt and I were BLOWN AWAY and went to foodie heaven! The Poutine was perfectly gooey and the chicken burger had this amazing special sauce that had a sweet, mustardy taste to it that I've never had before. My only regret is that I live too far away to go back on a regular basis! One last thought is how aesthetically pleasing the outdoor patio is. Strung lights across the top perimeter and cozy tables in a garden setting is perfect, particularly in warmer weather. The interior definitely had a rock n roll bar/pub type atmosphere and everyone has having a great time. A must-go if you're ever in Montreal.

Don't let any of this fool you. The poutine here mimics the best. It might be the best.The fries are half crispy, half saturated. The cheese curds are evenly distributed. The gravy is rich and a little sweet. For the wait, I would recommend just taking it out. This will give the components a chance to steep together in the bag on the way home.I didn't venture out of the standard classique, but I can say that the base of any variety will be good.Worth"

Location: they are located near a park so if you want to eat outside. Inside plenty of seating. Washrooms are clean. Price: decent considering you get so much. Will definitely come back!!"

Whenever I have someone visiting me in Montreal I always bring them here due to the large selection of poutines (and they even have a vegan one). As someone who lives in Montreal however, this is not a restaurant I come to often. There's almost always a huge line, even in the winter, and the service is very lacklustre. The waitress and waiters definitely want to get you in and out in a swift manner, and if I am taking too long finishing up eating my food and leaving I feel very rushed and uncomfortable. Sometimes you just want to sit and enjoy your food you know? As for the poutine, I always get the same thing, ""La Festival."" It's a poutine with Swiss cheese, ground beef, hot peppers, and onion rings. I LOVE what I get, however this visit the onion rings were VERY small, compared to the amount I usually get, and I felt like I didn't get my money's worth. Otherwise it was really delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to any tourist visiting in Montreal. It's a cute restaurant and it definitely has personality. I can attest that there is no poutinerie quite like La Banquise so definitely give it a shot!"

We sat outside in the back patio area. The waiter took a while to take our order and once he did we ordered a small poutine to share. They had many variations and we chose the one with guac, tomatoes. It felt like it took FOREVER (said like the Sandlot) to receive one small order of poutine, which I thought was ridiculous. I ventured off to the bathroom and that stunk like sewage. Yuck!! Tried to hold my breathe Once we received the food we started nibbling away. It was ok not great.

The gravy was good and wish the fries were better covered with it.I think my biggest qualm is the quality of the fries. Eating them by theirselves heavy, a little dry, and on the toastier side.

close-to-perfect concoction. I would definitely recommend La Banquise for the classic Canadian

The law--what kinda law that needs another permit to allow ppl to drink outside of a building--won't allow you to enjoy nice food and beer on the patio with an awesome weather.

Honestly, though, I think you should only order Poutine when you visit La Banquise.  I look forward to trying more of their Poutine menu in the not too distant future.Do yourself a favor and drop in to La Banquise.  You can visit any time of the day because they are open 24 hours!   They aren't a fancy diner, but their Poutine sure is scrumptious!!"

These didn't. They were soggy and just nothing impressive. I did get a side of grilled onions, which really enhanced the fries, so I can see how if you're into piling cheese, gravy meat and all kinds of stuff on your potatoes this place would be a go-to.

I came for poutine, but easily got seduced by the veggie burger on the menu. Not to fear, La Banquise provides a burger and poutine option. How clever. You can do basic fries, a classic poutine (gravy and cheese curds), or dress it up to a poutine special for a few more bucks. Of course I went all the way and ordered the veggie burger with La Taquise--a Mexican spin on poutine with guacamole and sour cream. The veggie burger is your standard soy patty and sesame bun, topped with coleslaw. It's quite the filler. The poutine side is a hefty portion and food overload.

I have had both the reggae poutine and la taquise. Both feature guac which is amazing on poutine but la taquise is vegetarians and the reggae has meat. We learned on our first trip that you can't order alcohol on the terrace so made sure to specify that we wanted a table where we could get beers the second time we came.

They've created an entire spectrum of poutine that goes beyond just gravy, cheese curds, and fries; a variety of which would appease all sorts of palates. The poutine portion of their menu is incredible. There are all sorts of combinations, even specialized ones like an all vegan one (Veganomaniac). I really wish I was able to try them all but the standouts for me were the:The T-Rex - chopped steak, pepperoni, bacon, sausage, hot dog.The Reggae - chopped steak, guacamole, diced tomatoes, hot peppersBougalou - pulled pork, creamy cabbage salad, sour creamThe Shoot Out - smoked meats, spicy sausage, pepperoni, baconThe Duleton - chopped steak and onionsI also highly recommend coming with a large group. Fortunately I was able to roll with a deep crew of dining companions and we were able to order all sorts of food for everyone. There may be a wait depending on the time of arrival, but thank goodness this spot is open 24 hours a day.At one point they were a divey spot, but after a change in ownership a couple of decades back, followed by a huge renovation, this has become an eatery that plenty to offer. There is now burgers, sandwiches, soups, salads, and a separate brunch menu. A big plus for drinkers: they also have a ton of craft brews.Service is also good for what it is. They deal with a lot of knuckleheads on the weekend and minus the ambiance of young folks, it's also not a bad idea to come in and order takeout. Drunk or sober, be sure to bring your appetite."

I asked both waiters for the Poutine in a bigger bowl/plate First guy said he'd just give me an under plate, when I asked specifically for a certain bowl (the one the large comes in) and then when it didn't come with an under plate I asked the girl who dropped it off for the bowl I wanted and she brought me a smaller plate. I finally just said forget it, because all I wanted was not to make a mess on the table and to be able to mix my Poutine how I wanted.

Made sense.Thing is, Poutine for me, doesn't need 10 pounds of stuff on it. It's perfect the way it is. I can't remember the name of what I ordered but it had all the makings of Poutine (cheese and gravy) but it came with a mountain of ground beef, sliced hot dogs, and slivered beef salami. Now look it was still good. But I found myself picking around everything just to get to the gravy cheese and potatoes, which were amazing lollll.

The wait unfortunately was about 10-15 minutes and we finally got our food. OH. MAH. GAWD. IT WAS SO GOOD. I never thought I would ever hear cheese curds squeak but it did!!!!! I love the squeakness so much, the gravy was beyond amazing, I don't know what they put into it but mhmmmmmmm it had the gravy taste but hints of spicy and sour. The potatoes were cooked perfectly and weren't starchy at all with some subtle sweetness. Definitely try it out but some of the locals told us the place is overrated, meh lol"

We ordered the just classic poutine and it was exactly what I expected it to be. Soggy fries covered in gravy and cheese curds....I really don't get why people go crazy over poutine haha but again that is just me. Ordered some side dishes like jalapeno poppers and onion rings which made the experience a little bit better.....I suppose if you are visiting Montreal and you really want to give poutine a try, do give this place a try since everyone seems to be crazy about their poutine!"

/user_details?userid=7nBwHdgvBPr3duNwROsFmg,Leah X.,"Brampton, Canada",4 star rating,We came here twice on our trip to Montreal. The first time we got the large Reggae poutine to go because the line to dine-in was very long. It was huge and delicious and more than enough for 2 hungry people.The second time we dined in and bought a hamburger combo and a regular poutine. I was a bit disappointed in the poutine because the gravy wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese curds. I had to ask for extra gravy twice and it came luke-warm. The burger with double patties and cheese was great! I'd recommend taking your poutine to go to avoid the long line ups.

No one ever came to check in to give us waters / drinks or ask for our order. We waited patiently for about 20 minutes while people around us got asked their orders, served water and their meals! The table next to us came in a little before we did and they had their meals served and we still haven't even been checked in on!We flagged down 3 different waiters, who kept telling us that our waiter would be with us shortly. It's one thing if we just sat there and did nothing, but we actually tried to grab someone's attention - apparently not one of them was actually our waiter. I get that maybe our waiter then is maybe just too busy but one of those three should have been able to notify him / her. Still nothing after waiting for about an 45 minutes so we just left.

We went with a standard order, a chorizo and an onion & pepper mix.  They key here is the potatoes; they obviously serve a lot of them and they chop and cook them right such that the gravy doesn't drown them.The line out the door moved quickly.

/user_details?userid=qGSrT9FfUZAgY-Jm2Co9sQ,Roger K.,"Clifton Park, NY",4 star rating,"They were at the top of a list of where to have poutine in Montreal.  Most every review I'd read said to be prepared to stand on queue and wait for your turn.  I was flabbergasted and thrilled, after walking for 50 minutes to get there, to see no line and to be seated immediately at approximately 6 pm on a Thursday in June.How many ways are there to make poutine?  An infinite number!  My plan was to have a virgin version so that I could experience it in its true simplicity. But with a menu offering up more than two dozen variations I found myself weakening and giving in to several of the deliciously sounding descriptions.  The only thing I was certain of was that I would only order a regular portion and not the large portion.  I had seen a regular being served at the table next to us and questioned if I could even finish that amount.I settled on La Rachel ($8.45/13.20) with green peppers, onions, and mushrooms.  In some ways, it was almost like having breakfast without the eggs.  The fries were crispy on the outside with some brown edges, yet yielding, and soft on the inside.  I first enjoyed a few that had not touched the gravy and they reminded me of the ones that my Mom made years ago.  The gravy was very good and also reminded me of what Mom made for our mashed potatoes.  The cheese curds are on the chewy side to add an additional texture and maintain that texture even with the hot gravy.  The peppers and onions were likely sliced on a mandolin and properly cooked.  The mushrooms added one more wonderful flavor.My wife ordered La Taquise ($10.25/15.70) with guacamole, sour cream, and tomatoes.  After tasting my dish, she said that mine had more flavor.  Hers was good, but lacked the oomph that my had.  The tomatoes did not further emphasize the flavors of the fries and gravy, nor add any character to them.  The guacamole was very average and might have benefited from some chunky texture, but that might have conflicted with the curd texture.It would appear that Canadian restaurants and bars favor selling Canadian brewed beers.  We had bottles of St Ambroise Pale Ale ($5.70) and Alchimiste Ecossaise Scottish Brown ($5.30).  Both were quite good.Service was polite, efficient and friendly.  Minimal translation was needed and the place is open 24 hours.  They do not take American Express, and only take credit cards from Canadian banks."

/user_details?userid=C6_ViNwMNnLHDbbtCwDZuA,Kat J.,"Jersey City, NJ",4 star rating,"There was one food I knew I had to try in Montreal and that was poutines. I am still kicking myself for not going to a Poutine-dedicated shop during our trip to Vancouver last fall. So before we left for Montreal, I made sure to google the list of best poutine in the city. La Banquise topped most of those aforementioned lists. So the first thing we did after checking into our hotel was to set out for La Banquise!We got here at 4pm, so there was no wait. We weren't too hungry, as such we decided to share a hot dog and a poutine dish. First things first, we had the Spicy Sausage Hot Dog. Holy cow, or shall I say holy dog, it was honestly one of the best hot dogs I've ever had. To be fair, I am not a connoisseur of hot dogs, in fact I rarely order hot dogs. But out of the few that I've had, this was way up there. The sausage had the perfect amount of spiciness, and the coleslaw was pretty kickass. Lastly they toasted the bun, which is a huge plus in my book, I hate soft soggy buns that fall apart when you bite into it. Now onto the main event, the poutine. We shared La Festival, which had ground beef, Swiss cheese, hot peppers and onion rings. It was ... Kind of a letdown. For a place so well known for poutines, the one we tried was just average. The ground beef was bland and there wasn't enough gravy. However the four onion rings on top were kind of amazing, and cheese curds are always fantastic. Overall I think the poutine deserved three stars while the hot dog gets five, so I averaged it out to four.  The service was fast, efficient and friendly.  Definitely worth a visit when you come to Montreal."

The gravy was surprisingly less salty than expected and not too thick and not too thin. Cheese curds were satisfyingly squeaky. There are two lines - right side is for dine-in and left side is for take-out. Docked one star for absolutely disgusting bathrooms.

The poutine with hot dog was a HUGE disappointment (the hot dogs were no better than oscar meyer wieners and added a strange flavor to the gravy; they certainly were not all beef; I would recommend NOT to order this) and the cheeseburger was one of the worst that I've had (the meat was dry; not even the bacon could redeem this). To add insult to injury: The seating arrangement was pretty terrible -- they made what was one table into two, to seat us and another family (we couldn't get up without having to ask them to stand up). To date, the best Poutine experience that we've had was NOT in Montreal; it was at Saus in Boston.We were glad that the service was at least friendly and our waitress happily helped convert our US dollars into Canadian.

Yet I do still give them one..till I find a better poutine place.While their poutine is tasty with all the gravy and fixings, I found them very very greasy. In fact, I exacerbated my sore throat the next day after digging into all the fried stuffs. Not sure they changed the oil after each batch of fries....Anyhow, the fries are definitely full of flavors! I love the generous amount of smoked meat and gravy. The smoked meat and gravy has a pretty strong black peppery flavors. Also, if you are a not a big fan of sodium, beware - the sodium intake can easily jump up 10,000 mg after this dish. Definitely on the salty side, but I do not mind it as I am a complete sucker for salt or any umami awesomeness. Portion is humongous! I only ate 1/2 of the portion and packed it to go. I managed to eat it as a 2nd meal later on.Bottom line - Come here ONLY if you:First time visitor of Montreal and are looking to check off poutine from your listDon't give a damn of a Paleo diet, Atkins diet, or any dietNot in a rush.

I particularly liked the reggae poutine. That paired with a grilled cheese was my breakfast on my last day in town. It is not busy during the day but the line starts to build at night.

I found this place on yelp, and my uber driver in Montreal said it's a must, so I decided to give it a try. I have had poutine before, but never in Canada, so I said why not??Luckily for me when I got there there wasn't as big a line as expected (likely because it was an off hour on a weekday), which I didn't mind at all. I sat pretty quickly and tried to digest the many poutine options on the menu. My friend and I decided to try two kinds: The Festival, and the Fred CaillouNow both of those (and probably anything you order) were heavy. The Fred Caillou is definitely a lot of meat, and can be a bit much. The Festival was a bit better (the guac tempered some of the heaviness) but still was a lot to take. I think in total we finished maybe a 1/3 of the food. There were definitely people who ordered and ate an entire plate by themselves ... hats off to them. I think if I were to go back I might try either just the plain poutine or something with more guac and sour cream to temper the heaviness of the gravy/cheese. The Taquise might be a good option.Note: they do have non-poutine options here (burgers, sandwiches, etc) so if you want poutine and you're with someone who doesn't, you can still come here. Also note they only take cash or Canadian Debit (bc apparently that's a thing). so prepare for that. Overview: good flavor but very heavy - don't expect to finish your food!Stay Cheerful ;)"

Since I love fries, why not? We made the trek to La Banquise and the street was quiet due to the snow and construction, but everyone who was out were headed to this restaurant!There was a line but it moved quickly. You can see the kitchen near the entrance spewing out poutines. There are two sizes available, regular and large, and let me tell you that a regular is quite big! We got seated and the tables are quite close together so prepare to get cozy with your table neighbours. We ordered a regular to share since we had just eaten lunch. The toppings, gravy and cheese curds were good but not mindblowing. The most disappointing part was that all the fries were soggy (and it's not because of the gravy), which I didn't understand because the kitchen was mainly churning out poutines so I expected the fries to be fresh.Not too memorable for me, but maybe just the quality dropped when we went. Other people here on Yelp had better experiences."

Which they are suppose to be, the slightly disappointing thing though, was that their bacon was very thin, it looked like they used Maple Leaf instant bacon in their dishes. The most pleasant surprise was that our waiter came back to check on us to see if we needed anything, even though he was super busy.

/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I think that poutine is a very personal thing. For me, it brings back memories of cold winter days in Quebec City. There, the local institution is Ashton, and it doesn't get much better than that.Poutine is straightforward food. It's messy and cheap. Comfort food implies familiarity, and with that in mind, I think the carnival of toppings that made La Banquise famous is unnecessary and distracting. Their fries and gravy seem to be of secondary importance and quality, whereas in my book these two elements are the heart and soul of poutine, respectively.This doesn't make the place any less impressive to poutine noobs. Everyone I introduced to the place came out happy and full. I have tried three of their poutines to date, and can now fit an entire regular T-Rex in my poor stomach.Overall a great place, but there's definitively better poutine in town."
/user_details?userid=-ZqPTpx9TyyvdAWbajdilA,Jessica S.,"San Diego, CA",4 star rating,"Wow. When people say, ""Be prepared for a wait"", they ain't lyin'! We wandered over to La Banquise on a Monday mid-morning, after a grueling hike up Mont Royal. We were sweaty, probably stinky, and absolutely hungry.Everybody said that THIS was the place to go for your poutine fix. And they were right - the sheer variety of poutine plates boggled the mind. But, I'm getting ahead of myself.There was quite the line when we arrived, which we expected. It wasn't horrible - we were all inside the establishment, instead of trailing out onto the street, as I'd heard can happen. The front register area was kind of a cluster, because there's one door with a random glass piece in front of it, which meant that people had to step to one side or the other to enter, which caused a bit of a bottleneck. The register was also right there, so people who were ordering their food to go would end up blocking those entering or exiting.The host stand is partway into the lobby area, and though they were packed, the two working the stand did a good job of keeping everyone in line and handing out menus to those who needed some reading material while they were waiting. Their menus aren't quite as bad as something like the Cheesecake Factory, but they're close. So many poutine choices!We were taken to a table on the patio (no alcoholic beverages allowed out there, in case you're curious), and a waitress was standing next to us before we were even settled. We both ordered water (I tell you, that hike to, up, down and from Mont Royal was beastly!) and set to trying to decipher the menu.We eventually decided: La Mart (hot dogs, bacon and mushrooms) for me and La BOM (bacon, onions, merguez sausage) for him. It sounded good at the time. We briefly contemplated having ""true"" poutine - nothing cluttering the original version - but neither of us ended up doing that. We endured quite a wait for the food, but given the place was packed to the gills, it didn't much surprise us. But once the food finally came out, we were stunned. We'd seen plates pass us by - the small variety and the large variety - and made small remarks about each in turn, but once they were set down in front of us...wow. The small was HUGE! Needless to say, neither of us were able to finish our meals (and I absolutely had eaters-remorse afterwards, knowing that all that walking/hiking and my 3+ mile run around Mont Royal were basically negated by that one plate). But...I mean. It was pretty tasty. I love hot dogs. I try not to. The French fries were perfectly cooked, the gravy was tasty without being overly salty, and the mushrooms added a nice texture without detracting from the plate. Plus, the cheese curds were melting and gooey, and the perfect complement to all the other stuff going on on top of my plate.Meanwhile, the hubs was slowly plowing through his plate as well. He enjoyed his, but did remark that the merguez sausage was a little too overpowering for the dish. He snagged a couple of my hot dog pieces and said that he would have preferred that. Conversely, I snapped up a merguez sausage piece, and thought that the bite from the spices really woke up the dish.To each their own, I guess.Anyway - the waitresses were all super friendly and accommodating, which was nice. I know they were busy running hither and tither, so the fact that they didn't rush us along or make us feel unwelcome in any way was nice.If I wasn't at my poutine-capacity (for the rest of my life, I think), I'd absolutely consider going back to La Banquise to try the original version."

The poutine here is made of great fries, cheese curds, and gravy, but we ordered la veganomane, which has homemade vegan gravy and vegan cheese and it was incredible. The cheese was squeeky and amazing. It's a really filling dish, so share it if you're just having it for late night food or a snack.

They had a menu dedicated to poutines and special seasonal poutines.I don't know which local first told me about Resto La Banquise, but somehow I heard that Resto La Banquise was the best poutinerie in Montreal. We walked quite a distance on a hot day to enjoy it and our efforts were rewarded.It was an off-beat time but Resto La Banquise was bustling. Other groups arrived at the same time as us and many tables were occupied. At first we were confused and waited in the wrong queue. There are two lines: one on the left for ordering take-out and the one on the right for seeing the host(ess) to be seated. No matter - we were seated soon after arrival.The server was amicable and warm. We enjoyed the regular, classic poutine as well as the seasonal Just For Laughs. In both, M noted a hint of sweetness to the fries themselves - a welcome addition to combat the savory richness of the toppings. The fries could easily be cut; however, they also maintained their integrity well enough to be stabbed with a fork and lifted. Sometimes fries become soggy, break, or fall apart after absorbing delicious gravy.The gravy was beautiful. It wasn't as thick as I'm used to. It was thinner and more like a broth than a somewhat gelatinous sauce that I have come to call gravy. It was delicate but still rich. It melded with the fries rather than sat on top of them.The curds were squeaky fresh. My teeth literally squeaked as I chewed them. They were creamy, firm, and salty.In addition to those regular toppings, the Just For Laughs poutine also had roasted red peppers, guacamole and sour cream. We appreciated those additions. The vegetables lent a welcome freshness to the otherwise indulgent savoriness that is poutine.We also enjoyed an apricot beer and a hard cider along with our poutine. We were given the bottles and plastic cups in which to drink them. The cool beverages were refreshing after our long walk and then they were a great way to follow up a bite of poutine. The inside of Resto La Banquise was comfortable but not cool. It was not quite an escape from the uncomfortable heat outside so our cooling drinks were crucial to enjoying our experience."

So it became our first stop soon after arriving in the city on a rainy Thursday evening. There was a 20-minute wait, which wasn't too bad and gave us time to explore the exhaustive menu of poutine possibilities, from the classic to the meat-heavy to a Mexican version.We went with two small orders: the classic and another version with bacon, steak and sausage. It was plenty of food for two, and it was in fact delicious, and very decadent.Keep in mind, though, that many quality poutine options abound throughout the city, and you're just as likely to find dishes just as (and possibly even more) tasty at other establishments. We even had a great poutine layered with smoked meat in the Old Port area--and I thought it was even better than Banquise!

/user_details?userid=NtyZOPiEDsrEIZAYlEVmWg,Marlene M.,"Arlington, VA",4 star rating,"I'm picky when it comes to french fries.  I wouldn't call myself a snob, but I do like them cooked a certain way - golden brown and salty, with crispy edges and soft (almost soggy) centers.  So when I read that Canada's national dish was basically a plate for french fries smothered in gravy and cheese curds, I got admittedly excited.  And on the last day of my 4-day visit, I headed over to La Banquise for what's considered to be the best Poutine in town.  I walked in around 3:00pm and the place was as packed as if it were peak lunch or dinner time. Lucky for me though, there was no line and I was seated immediately.  The interior of the restaurant is cheerful and warm, with walls and seats painted in bright yellows, oranges and blues, exposed brick and artificial grass in some parts, and a ceiling covered in branches.  There's also a nice little terrace in the back.  The restaurant is lively with a wait staff that actually appear to like their job.  The wonderful smell of fried-something was everywhere.  The menu is a laminated book with an entire page dedicated to poutine. And there are a LOT of choices: the hot dog poutine topped with pieces of hot dog; the mexican with hot peppers, tomatoes, and black olives; the T-Rex with the ground beef, pepperoni, bacon and hot dog combo.  Apparently you can get pretty creative with this dish.  Somewhere in Montreal there is apparently even a restaurant that serves poutine with lobster meat.  But since it was my first try, I decided to go simple and order the classic - fries, cheese curds, and the Canadian version of ""BBQ sauce"" (AKA, gravy).  The fries were perfect - the cut, the color, the texture with the crispy edges and the semi-sogginess from the gravy.  And the squeaky cheese in the center, nice and solid.  The gravy was thin and just enough.  It was all delicious and for 6.25, a great value for your money."

Great decision, as the line moves relatively quickly (we probably waited around 25-30 minutes), with the added relief that half the people waiting were in a second line for take-out. The other important thing to note is this place is CASH ONLY. They have an ATM inside, but it's something to prepare for so you don't get caught off guard. We were warned about the temptations of getting a large when you're hungry, so we all ordered regular sized poutines. I ordered the Shoot-Out, someone ordered the Galvaude, and I'm pretty sure the last one was the Elvis. All were tasty, but my Shoot-out was by far the stand-out. So meaty, creamy and delicious! There's honestly not a lot else I can say about it besides GET IT. Fries were perfectly cooked, cheese was perfectly squeaky, and all the different meats were piled high on top. For many people, this would be enough for two meals. I was especially hungry, though, and had help from my two friends throughout the meal, and was proud to finish it.

/user_details?userid=bH--sW5TemoGHFDS5mkUbQ,Jazzy13023 J.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"best poutine place to visit in Montreal but be aware. There is always a line up. They have a good choice of up-to 30 poutine. I like visiting with family because it has vegan options but also meat eaters option. This is a must top if you are visiting Montreal and need a poutine fix.  As a local, I've visited them at 4 p.m and at 4 a.m. both times can be busy . It's crazy they don't expand. Parking can be a bit tough. A good way to eat their poutine is to walk up Montreal, and then decide to eat the poutine.  They always have long line ups. They should expand. This is the reason I have deducted a point. They should have online ordering, and then you can pick up the poutine. I hate waiting in line.  Trust me, if it's 4a.m. you will be waiting for 30 minutes outside.  If it's 1 p.m. you will be waiting the same time on a Saturday."

The portions are large so just get the regular, unless you're sharing. They have the classic which is fantastic. The curds were perfect and I like the gravy they use. My husband made a point to note that the fries on their own were good and the layers of flavors made it all perfect.

This was only my second time having poutine (the first was at a bar back home in NY and suffice to say it was just ok) and I don't think I want to tarnish my memory by trying any other poutine moving forward. The portion was HUGE (I was alone so I had one half for lunch at the restaurant and the other half cold at the airport waiting for my flight...it was still good cold fyi) and the service was friendly although a bit slow since the place was busy. I came here on a Wednesday afternoon and there was no wait since I was dining solo but they get a lot of foot traffic so I can imagine the lines that form on a Friday/weekend. Back to the food itself. My dish tasted like a Philly cheesesteak which I'm into and I highly recommend it if you are into that sort of thing as well. The fries aren't seasoned, but the beef/cheese curd/gravy to fries ratio is enough where you won't have a dry unflavored fry. They were also not soggy despite all the gravy, which is key. Though poutine isn't for anyone on a diet, it's definitely worth it as a cheat day meal. Honestly the best 10 bucks I've spent so far."

The fresh tomatoes added so much flavor to the dish. We also ordered a greek salad, which was tasty, but a bit on the pricey side.Highly recommend. End of story.PS.

You can't go wrong with a plate of greasy poutine late at night. By far, my favourite is the La Taquise, which comes with guac, sour cream, and tomatoes so it's almost healthy.

Because it was February it was pretty cold, however, there are heaters outside for those queued up in line. Once inside we were greeted by very friendly waitstaff and delicious poutine. I had the traditional with beef and my fiancée had the traditional with bacon. Both were crazy good. The fries were perfectly crispy and the gravy savory with a little hint of sweetness which was both unexpected and really good.

Located right by Parc La Fontaine, this place is open 24H and caters to dine in diners and take out diners. The sit in line up is usually longer while the take out line up is shorter but you can expect to wait a good 10-15 minutes for your Poutine to be ready. They have a wide variety of options ranging from a classic Poutine to more extravagant choices like La Reggae which has ground beef, guac and banana peppers. If you come in the morning, they also have breakfast Poutines or you can upgrade your breakfast potatoes for a classic Poutine (+$3). Serving size is quite large for the Poutine. A regular is a good snack size if you order multiple dishes but if you want a meal size to share, the grande is fairly good (especially with all the toppings)! What I love about this place is not only the delicious Poutine but also the location. It's right next to the park which makes it super easy to grab a Poutine to go and then head to the park for a mini picnic. A must try in Montreal but be weary of the long line ups in the evening.

There is something about the fries that is different from other places that makes it so good!

The lineup is usually pretty big too but in fairness you don't usually end up waiting too long since they're pretty good with quick service which helps to turn the tables faster.  The decor inside is very casual , the better option is to sit in their outdoor terrasse (Its nicer and less hectic). Service wasn't the friendliest but it was quick and the prices are fair.  The poutine itself and portion size is also good, they offer a decent amount of options from classic to more creative as well as build your own. They're generous with extra toppings, the fries taste fresh not frozen and they're cooked perfectly, they use cheese curds (which is a must for authentic poutine) and their gravy is tasty as well. The Merguez on top was also super tasty and they were very generous with the amount. The poutine with the guacamole, sour cream and tomato was okay , the toppings were very fresh and the fries and sauce under were good but the combination of the two just doesn't really pair well together, at least in my opinion. My issue was that there was more of the extra toppings and that there wasn't really too much cheese except the sprinkling at the top and there wasn't really enough sauce to bring it all together and heat up the cheese.  All in all this is a fun place to stop in for a quick casual bite to eat if you're in the area but I wouldn't necessarily say its a must if you're visiting Montreal and are in search of the best poutine."

Chipotle sauce added a kick of flavour on top of all the fattiness.My friends ordered La Chicks, La Savoyarde, and La Veganomane. I'd recommend La Chicks if you have a particular craving for breaded chicken, but it doesn't offer more than that. The Savoyarde was also really good.

Sometimes when you have too many options, it becomes difficult to make decisions (at least that's how it works with me). We chose this place because of the amount of reviews.. and it was only A-OK. However, that may be our fault for ordering the ""plainer"" option. The grand size of ""Taquise"" seemed like the perfect choice for us. It was topped with tomatoes, guacamole, and sour cream. We probably should have ordered something with lots of meat and gravy, something packed with flavor. But then, I can also argue that anything with guacamole should be amazing. So 3 stars it is, but it is worth going back to, especially since they're open 24/7!Make sure you use your google translate and get in the correct line: dine in or take out. There's a line of people outside, but they're just waiting for their take out orders. We got lucky and arrived before a line formed for dining in.

For the second night in a row, I decided to get another poutine dish. This time, I had opted to get the vegetarian sandwich (which, funnily enough, was located under the healthy options. I'm not sure how a sandwich with mayonnaise and fried eggs would belong under any healthy option menu, but it was there) and a side of their La Rachel poutine. My friends and I also shared a large salad, and I got a bottle of their namesake brew.My thoughts on the meal? The sandwich was good, the poutine was tasty, (though, I thought the poutine was better at Poutineville), and the beer was fine. I can see why the place was so popular and I did like that they offered plenty of things aside from just poutine. Not a bad spot, and it seemed to be quite popular with the locals as well."

/user_details?userid=ih1yeJe1auoH9ARSPHxfMw,Chris S.,"Forest Park, Springfield, MA",3 star rating,Delicious poutine and I appreciate that they have vegetarian options. This place either needs to expand or to have another location to meet the flow of people who want to sit down. Luckily they had a take out line so we got some food then sat elsewhere. I would of easily dropped more than what I spent on takeout for drinks and everything but this was a lost opportunity for the restaurant.

Just start talking about football.I'm pretty disappointed by this poutine. It was essentially gravy fries with chunks of cheese that were too hard. I'd rather just eat cheese fries or gravy fries, or gravy fries with MELTED cheese on top. Maybe I'm just too American to appreciate it.

I had the L'Ensoleillée Breakfast Poutine, which included your usual breakfast meats (ie bacon), and a sunny-side up egg on top. Huge portion and was definetly not able to finish it in one sitting.

Indeed, the poutine was good (if a plate of French fries with condiments can ever be called good) and the environment was very much made of locals. The line upon arrival was long, but it moved fast enough. I was slightly put off by the fact that it's cash only and they only accept Canadian debit cards (weird). If you want to come here for lunch, don't forget to get cash first! As far as the portions, the small is actually pretty large since it's fries. I couldn't even finish it, and I'm used to large American portions of everything. Overall, it was worth it just to say I tried a plate of poutine.

/user_details?userid=OTzAgRLafzhclnCVc2wuZA,Gordon Y.,"Northwest Calgary, Calgary, Canada",5 star rating,"This place was recommended to us by the waitress at L'Avenue. We ate 5-6 hours before, but hiking Mont-Royal in the devastating rain and getting a foggy view of the city really turned our apetites up. It started getting hot and raining on and off. We waited outside in line for about 45 minutes at 3pm. The line actually goes quite fast as alot of people get take out. I offered to take turns sitting on the bench with Cho but he decided to be a man and said ""I dont need no bench!"". When we got in we sat below the air conditioning which was dripping but the servers quickly wiped it up. Theres lots of choices- from vegetarians to meat lovers alike. The prices and values are amazing, $8-11 for a regular poutine and $13-16 for a large poutine. I ordered the Taquise (Guacamole, tomatoes, sour cream) regular size while the Korean beast ordered a large smoked meat. I could barely finish the regular, it was that filling. My bros a monster and he barely finished the large, keeping in mind we ate our butts off 6 hours ago. I'd say for a regular couple, you can order one large and you'd both have enough food. Unless you're like Cho...220lb pounds of Korean juice.Tastewise both poutines were great! Fries were crispy outside and soft inside. The smoked meat was delicious as always. Lots of flavour in the gravy and large cheese curds to give some texture. Stay tuned for 24 hours in Montreal with Cho!Service- 5/5Cleanliness- 4/5Atmosphere- 4/5Food- 5/5+Location- 4/5Would i return? Yes!"

They have a huge section of poutines, and what's great is you can easily add on or remove certain ingredients. The more meat you get on your poutine, don't be too surprised if it tastes a bit salty.

Have you ever eaten cheese that made squeaky sound?? Well, I can now say, yes I have. It does not taste good. The fries were filled with oil and drenched in gravy topped with squeaky cheese.

The selection is limitless on how many combinations of Poutine you can have! It is the chipotle of poutines! We really enjoyed the calliou and the reggae! Both were great choices! The reggae gave a healthy option of vegetables and meat while the calliou will be able to satisfy any meat lover out there! Drinks are on the pricey side, $2-3 for a soda and the poutine is around $13~ average. If you bring a date, the total meal could be up to $35 with tip and tax!

It really didn't matter to us, because we were there for the poutine.My husband and I shared a large classic poutine ($12.50). I really don't know how their fryers pump out so many delicious fries, but somehow they do it. The fries are piping hot and somehow still crispy. There is something quite special about the flavour of the fries and gravy... a sweetness that can't be explained. You just need to go here to try it yourself.

Walk, to La Banquise, of course, since that seems like the most logical decision! But seriously, go there after the late-night après-clubbing rush so you can avoid the hordes of drunk students who make the long line seem even longer. There was literally no one else when I walked in, something that surprised me considering that when I went in the spring of last year, it was packed to the brim.I decided to try one of their unique twists on poutine instead of the usual ""La Classique,"" so I ordered ""La Taquise"" since it seemed the most appealing and not doused in meat like the other ones. One might not think that gravy and guacamole go together, but they surprisingly tasted really good! I just wish the guacamole contained more chunks of avocado instead of being totally pureed, but it helped some of the cheese curds stay in their solid form instead of conglomerating in a gloppy mess. The sour cream and tomato made the poutine more refreshing and provided a nice contrast to the hot gravy, making the dish all the more interesting. I ended up finishing the whole plate, which says quite a bit since they fill it to the brim with fries and condiments. They definitely are not cheap when it comes to giving you lots of food.La Banquise is definitely worth the hype in my opinion, and their poutine offerings are some of the highest quality available in Montréal. Now, if only they had a delivery service so I wouldn't have to order Chef on Call if I'm too lazy to walk and need a poutine fix... (Hint: it's not that great)"

A quick Google search will always present this place in the top 3 poutineries of Montreal and when you see the menu of over 2 dozen kinds, you can understand why.I never officially had poutine before, but the concept of fries, gravy and cheese curds (poor man's mozzarella) is simple to understand. The gravy here has a good flavor and the cheese curds give a mild salt factor. The T-Rex version with added bacon, hot dogs and ground beef is a carnivore's dream (duh).For these dense dishes a regular should be sufficient for 2 sharing, unless you're starving. My only dislike about the concept of poutine is the mushy fries. Just my personal preference for crispy/non-soggy fries.By the way, the onion rings here are skinny and super crunchy as a good side order. Service is incredibly friendly as well."

We were seated right away. If you don't want to wait hours for a table, visit during off-peak meal times (it's open 24 hours anyway).First, if you're driving. We found free street parking right by the park located beside the restaurant. But note, parking is only free during certain times of the day (I think our particular spot was only available before 3:00 PM). Make sure you read the signs!Second, the food. Carbs galore but it was worth it. Our server suggested getting the onion rings as a side to our poutine, with honey as a dipping sauce. GET THIS! The best onion rings I've ever had - fried to perfection, thin and crispy, and the honey was a cherry on top. For poutine, we got the T-Rex poutine which was full of ground beef, pepperoni, bacon and sausage. This was delicious but not the best - the meat and fries could have been crispier but overall, a decent choice.A great poutine experience in Montreal.

We got La Mart (large for $13.25) which contains hot dog sausage, bacon and mushroom. It was a generous portion of food and we had difficulty finishing it between two people. There's something different about the fries (it's sweeter than other poutines I've had) which makes it so good!I would definitely come back here for a cheap eat if I'm back in Montreal."

Naturally we knew we had to get in on this not so hidden gem. We waited approximately 40 minutes until we were seated. We ordered 1 large poutine (for those that don't know, it's a bowl of fries covered in gravy and cheese curds) with bacon and hot dog. We also got 2 burgers and 2 beers. We were stuffed. The burgers were average but the poutine was awesome. The fries were cooked well, the gravy was just the right amount and the cheese curds - well it's cheese so it was amazing.We were so impressed that we returned the next Dr and ordered 3 different poutines to try. All 3 were great and had its own special kick to it - peppers, tomatoes, smokiness. There were only 2 of us so we took half of it back to the hotel and enjoyed it as drunk food the next evening.

Maybe with a group it would be more fun, to get a few different items and share them, or maybe if we had more time to spend in Montreal.

/user_details?userid=kFtpOzWygqAENd6oKrkefw,Marissa S.,"Irvine, CA",4 star rating,"So we had to try poutine while in Canada. I already bookmarked this place before getting here and true enough this was one of the places our concierge at the hotel suggested to get some in the city.Before even walking in, I could already smell the thick aroma of grease in the air. What was I thinking, right? Fried food galore! Very hip and casual atmosphere. The place was loud and packed with a younger crowd mostly in groups. Tables are tightly situated right next to each other. We could hear conversations to our left and to our right but that didn't bother us. It was rather amusing. After perusing the menu, I decided to get their POUTINE LA SAVOYARDE: bacon, onions, Swiss cheese, sour cream atop a bed of fries covered in ""gravy"". Yes, Americans call it that but I hear Canadians prefer to call it ""brown sauce"". Ok, so it's delicious, but not out of this world amazing. In fact, it's quite overwhelming. Halfway through, I was already forcing it down my throat. It's heavy! No wonder we had people stare at our table when they saw our food. The poutine was only a side dish for my friend and I, while everyone else had it as their main order. And yes, we each had our own poutine! I got the HAMBURGER STEAK as my main entree. This, too was fried and oozing with the goodness of its juices. The patty was well-seasoned...very yummy! I enjoyed this so much more than the poutine.Friendly staff and service. Only complaint was the wait for our food. Others who came after us got their orders before we did. Maybe because we had main entrees and they all got poutines only? I guess... Cash only here with an ATM machine inside but they also accept USD. So thankful for that.Oh and they're open 24/7! Probably because this is good drunk food. Hah!"

However, after being advised that poutine is one of the must-try items when visiting Montreal, I researched poutine places and this was one of the top choices. It is not located in downtown Montreal, but a few stops away when taking the metro.It is quite a walk when getting off the metro. I was very surprised to see that a line outside the store front was already formed as I make my way towards the end of the line. The wait on the line flew by pretty quick, I don't think I waited more than an hour. - it depends on whether you decide to take out or sit down. The line starts to split into the take out and sit down section. Different type of poutine was painted on the wall, but it was still a bit difficult to see since people were lining up along the walls. As there was 1-2 parties ahead of me, I was finally able to reach for a menu and confirm what I  wanted. The menu was very extensive and definitely made it harder for someone who has never tried poutine before since I did not even know where to started. After a hard contemplation,  I finally opted in for the La Miam (ground beef, merguez sausage, onions, tomatoes and Swiss cheese).The styrofoam take out box can get a bit messy which is wrapped in a brown paper bag. Luckily, I asked for a plastic bag; it was a bit dirty, but I'm not complaining since it literally dripped everywhere in the paper bag. It was entirely filled with toppings and the fries were deeply hidden, which I had to dig for. The fries were not how I usually like my fries: crispy. It was pretty good with all the different types of toppings. It definitely gives you the feeling of wanting more because of all the toppings blended  together on top of fries. Seriously who can pass on fries or in this case, poutine?"

I highly recommend La Festival and La Scooby. The hot peppers are not too spicy and the large portions are good to share with two people as a meal.

She said we could either move inside or she could take the beer back, but the beer was already opened! We moved inside. I joked about having gone without avocado for too long as a Californian, but it's true. I really, really missed guacamole, which led me to choose La Taquise- guacamole, sour cream and tomatoes. My sister got La Mart- hot dog, bacon and mushrooms. We thought they were both ok, and I was actually grossed out by the guacamole, which was more reminiscent of store-bought guacamole.

It seems really small outside but it's pretty big on the inside, crammed with tables. It took a while for us to get the waiters attention, probably due to the fact that is was busy like hell.Besides the craziness, the poutine really hit the spot. We ordered the pulled pork poutine and the Matty. Maybe it was just me but the potatoes has a tint of sweetness to them, which was really good. The pulled pork poutine was a little sweet and the Matty was more to the savory. For 4 people, we order 2 regular size poutine. It's was just enough for a snack.

Eh...- That was my first impression of poutines. I didn't have much expectation for the food and I actually love, loved one! Poutine is worth to try, and if it is, here is the place. La Banquise is not simply the tourist spot- you must try, it's worth a visit. Good for night out with beer. I'd recommend ordering some beer and salads too. It's good but could be greasy so needs some refresh. Also, the portion is large (or even though you think it's not, it's hard to finish all). So you may not need to order many like one plate per person."

The thing is that: this place does not have the best poutine in Montreal. There are a lot of other places who make better ones. The poutine in La Banquise is kind of greasy, and the potatoes are not the best. on the other hand, the huge amount of toppings they have is impressive. Everything makes sense if you realize the place is open 24/7 since 1968, so you cannot expect ""the best poutine in Montreal"". They are iconic, the atmosphere of the place super agrees with the neighborhood in which they are, but you gonna have to face a line to get in (which usually does not take long) and you gonna smell like fries for a while after. I recommend for tourists that want to explore Montreal, but if you are looking for fancy poutine do not go there."

The burger was on the smaller size but for that price ($4.90) it was understandable. The poutine was not as good as I thought it would of been. The poutines I've had in Toronto are much better. The gravy was just a bit under warm which made the cheese curds still hard and cold. I much rather have my cheese curds warm and melted in.Good place if your in the area and want something quick to eat.Pro: open 24 hrs. Con: main dish (poutine) didn't measure up

While most poutine parlours I have been to are usually a take-and-go, or in a more run down environment, La Banquise has a tasteful collection of various poutines that you can go, and the dine-in experience is fun!Portions are fair, but it can be a bit pricey if you go with the large, but well worth it if you are hungry. For meat lovers, I will recommend the T-Rex, which comes with ground beef, pepperoni, bacon, hot-dog and sausage. If you are hungry, and want a good poutine and lots of meat - this is the perfect choice!I am still looking for a ""to-die-for"" poutine restaurant in Montreal.

He ordered one of the varieties with multiple meats on it. It did not look appealing, actually it looked terrible, but apparently it tasted fine. I had a burger which was...meh.

Our group of six really wanted to try the poutine dishes. I don't eat meat, but the vegan-style poutines didn't really tempt me, though I'm sure they are delicious as well! I was in the mood for something a bit lighter. I ordered the veggie burger, which came with a toasted bun, delicious coleslaw, and a thick layer of melted mozzarella cheese atop a veggie/soy patty. It was a small yet filling portion, with a variety of textures, and tasted indulgent enough that I didn't feel like I missed out on the crazy poutine concoctions, though they did look good! You can also sub the veggie burger in for any of the other burger combinations for an additional $1.50.

I do have the tendency to have eyes bigger than my stomach so to make matters worse, I got the large. They don't call it a T-Rex for nothing. It was enormous. Homer Simpson enormous. Massive amounts of meat that were glistening in grease. Look, I love me a good poutine but this was wayyy overboard. I felt like I was sweating meat grease by the end of the meal - and not in a good way haha!

Anyway, it was 11pm and I was all ready to go to sleep when he randomly tells me to get ready to go have the best poutine I will ever eat... I was sceptical but went along with it.Being a Friday night, we queued up for about 40-45 minutes until we got a table. I instantly loved the place and its ambiance! From the unique timber decorated ceiling to the vibrant colors and images that filled the walls. It was crowded and noisy but that is what made it so special.Whilst deciding on what to order (I couldn't make up my mind!) I glanced around the place looking at some huge poutine creations... It really was a difficult choice! We decided to go for a vegetarian poutine and I absolutely loved it! It more than satisfied my cravings as the greasy fries somewhat resembled the vinegar soaked chips in the UK but these were better as the gravy and accompaniments just added that extra oomph! I highly recommend going for a spicy ensemble (add hot peppers to your poutine) as it enhances the gravy flavors!The service was excellent despite the crowd and price wise it is reasonable too.As someone who so far had not liked any poutine since moving here 8 months ago, this place has truly converted me and I cannot wait until our next visit!"

I ordered the Reggae poutine with extra mushrooms and it was gooood. The guacamole and tomato were cold so it makes the dish taste refreshing and not too heavy. The guacamole was a bit too creamy... The hot peppers add in a nice hit. The fries were just on point, not too soggy or overfried. We got the regular poutine and I couldn't finish it all. Surprisingly, the poutine did not make me feel too heavy with all the fries.

The servers were all charming enough and the food arrived with haste but once it was time to leave, the servers were like my car keys: nowhere to be found. Now of course, the food. How could I forget. I ordered a banquise burger, which to be frank, was incredibly average. Not bad, mind you, but I wouldn't vote for it. I found the house sauce on this burger to be quite good, but there just wasn't enough of it. Obviously I need to mention the poutine. I ordered the one with chopped up pogos in it, and it was quite good. I wasn't surprised as the poutine is the attraction of la banquise. I suspect that many poutines (from their long list of choices) are pretty gnarly, which allows anyone who's been there to return many times with varying experiences of their meal. I imagine I would have easily tried them all had I grown up in that neighbourhood. Overall, the food was plentiful and dare I say delicious, and for a very reasonable price to boot.

I think the place is terrible.There are always long lines, service is highly impersonal and you are rushed in and out, and treated like a huge inconvenience.The poutine with guacamole sounds interesting but it is terrible - processed mushy packaged guacamole. I tried this one when drunk at 3am when almost anything tastes good. Especially a poutine. This did not taste good at all.The last time I visited I left my phone and when I called the next day I was told to call the 'office' who don't seem to ever pick up the phone. After anxiously waiting all day, someone FINALLY let me know that they DID have my phone! It baffles me how the people answering the phone weren't aware that there was a phone in lost and found should someone call about it.It appears this place has just gotten too big and it has no local, traditional Montreal feel it just like they have capitalised on their name too far.Do yourself a HUGE favour. Go to Chez Claudette instead. That restaurant is the real deal and their poutine is a million times better than la banquise. Vegetarians, ask the guys at Chez claudette for their delicious lentil gravy and homemade hot sauce. Friendly, fresh (you can see the cooks here) even with a great little patio. Avoid la banquise everyone."

I decided to console myself with a ""Taquise"", a generous portion of poutine, plus guac, sour cream and tomatoes and let me tell you...it's cold. Yep! The guac + cream + tomatoes are cold, so the cheese curds underneath don't melt, and then what's the point of it all, man! The fries are delicious, but the gravy can get very salty.

When our waitress brought us our bill, she told us they only accept Canadian credit cards and cash. We had neither and needed to use the ATM. It would have been much nicer for her to tell us this BEFORE serving us. My sister had to pay for me since my card did it work in the ATM; if I had been alone, I'm not sure what I would have done.

I learned the hard way, when they didn't take my Chase Freedom credit card.Food: I think sizing is important to mention. Between 4 people, we ordered 2 large poutines and it was more than enough. We ordered the B.O.M. as well as the Fred Caillou. Both are good.....if you like merguez sausage. I'm not poutine connoisseur by any means but I would recommend this place. Keep in mind that the combination of merguez sausage, bacon, and gravy in the B.O.M. caused the dish to be quite salty. Fred Caillou was also very salty, due to the combination of smoked meats, merguez sausage, and gravy....kind of like a beefed up version of the B.O.M. So if you're looking at ordering the B.O.M. or the Fred Caillou, I'd suggest ordering only one or the other due to the fact that they're so similar. Try the Bec Cola...it was unique. Very sweet. Maple Syrup soda is a good way to wash down all the poutine! Service: Fast and quick. Try to avoid the weekends.....when the line can wrap around the building. Would I come back? Probably not. I feel like it's a one-time thing. But if you haven't gone before, you should definitely go! It's a must do in Montreal."

I liked the chèvre burger as I thought it was well-balanced and the bun was nicely toasted. Funny enough we both agree their smoke meat sandwich is better than Swartz. However, we both agree the poutine was meh. Their fries were unflavourful, gravy was unmemorable and the cheese curds/fries ratio was pretty off. In my opinion this place is way overrated. If you want a really good poutine I'd recommend Gibeau Orange Julep.Also, just a heads up you must pay in advance if you go after 9pm. Also no alcohol in patio after a certain time.

Because if you're from here, you'd default to Poutineville if you were really out of ideas.It's not cheap, the service is consistently slow and terrible, and it's just overall not a great poutine. Average fries, average gravy, pretentious attempt to make a big deal out of the dish with unnecessary combinations. A case in point is their contestant poutine for this year's Poutine Week (an annual poutine contest in February). It's some sort of Mexican theme attempt with pepper sauce, canned corn, and an uninspiring fried jalapeño on top. The only 4 pieces of curds can be seen from the picture. And in case you're wondering, yes they put a mountain pile of sour cream on top of a soggy iceberg leaf. There are no points for creativity if execution is a failure.I normally restrain myself from giving 1 star for mediocre food when the establishment can redeem itself with good service or atmosphere. But when it's being proclaimed as the best in town and it can't deliver something half-decent - now you're really asking for it. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that it's open 24h.

The inside was very neat, their decor was rustic, but it was a bit tight. Their drink menu was big as well, my wife tried a coconut/ lemon drink called Lemoncocco. I was a bit skeptical at first but it was refreshing, wish they sell it back home. We ordered two poutines: La Reggae and La Sud-Ouest. Both poutine topping added different flavour to the standard poutine. The La Reggae ground beef and hot pepper add a good protein and heat. The La Sud-Ouest had the onion ring, sautéed onion, and chipotle sauce made it sweet. Both had guac., the guac. was a bit of a paste consistency than chunky avo. The fries was a bit soft and was okay. The topping made it up for fries. They have other food on the menu but all customer that i saw ordered poutine.

Quite salty but not bad.Try it yourself."

/user_details?userid=jSMsKAjIxCizGKn8l2wb_Q,Sheena J.,"Paramus, NJ",5 star rating,I was visiting from New Jersey and was recommended this place as the best place to get poutine fries in Montreal. We went around 4-5pm on a Saturday. We didn't wait too long and the fries are really good! But come early because when we left there was a line out the door. The restaurant itself isn't that big so I can see how the lines can easily become long. I definitely recommend this place.

Sorry I really don't find it delicious...  I prefer fries to go with ketchup, and please don't give me so much fries one time...People at Montreal plz don't be mad at me XD.

Definitely a restaurant that speaks for it's popularity. Upon arrival, there was a wait to be seated. We did go at lunch hour which made sense to the long line up. Not to long from our wait we were seated in one of the cozy corners of the dining areas. Ordered a tasty beer that I wish I remember the name of and one of the poutines. The pouting I ordered I should have considered the topping option as I was anticipating a hot poutine plate but with what I chose the poutine was served somewhat cold due to the excess amount of sour cream. I still enjoyed it and enjoyed it even more the next morning from the leftovers. The atmosphere was cool as the place a neat decor style of everything. Overall I would go again but order something different."

Ever since I had planned my family's trip to Montreal, I knew that I was going to come here and have my first poutine. I could. not. wait.We finally get here. My husband, me, and our two kids, one of whom is about 2 years old. We waited about 20 minutes on line. (Got there a bit before 6 pm.) I got to peruse the amazing poutine menu and fantasize about all of the different ways I could enjoy my first poutine. Should I go classic? Mexican? Italian? Veggie? Meat-fest? And then came the magic moment when we were told that there was a table for us. Yes, yes, yes. Here we go.  The 2-year-old basically became possessed as soon as we sat down at the table. Menus were placed in front of us. The 2-year-old swatted them right to the floor. The nice waitress brought over a kids menu with games and a jar of crayons. The 2-year-old alternatively threw the crayons on the floor, put some in his mouth, and then knocked over his water. And screamed and cried. Other restaurant patrons looked over to assess who exactly was destroying their dining experience. The waitress came over and apologized in advance for what would be a long wait for food as there were some complications in the kitchen that night. If ever I wished that a spaceship would materialize and suck me up into the night sky...We order. Four small poutines among us of different varieties. I choose a classic and a veggie version to share with the 2-year-old, figuring that one of those will satisfy his discriminating tastes. We wait for the poutine. The 2-year-old has become a heartless monster, hell-bent on destroying the atmosphere of the entire restaurant. So many things are flying off the table at this point, I can't even keep track. We resort to trying to distract him by giving him salt and pepper to taste. He likes it. What the...The poutine comes. Oh   my    gahhhhhhhhh, it looks so good. I take a bite. It tastes soooo good. I just want to dig in and stay in that moment forever. I am there. And then I am not, because the 2-year-old starts throwing poutine on the floor. So the rest of us basically cram poutine into our face holes as quickly as we can, ask for to-go boxes for the rest, and beat it out of there, not daring to look at any of the other patrons.Sigh.The next day my husband took the kids for the day. I heated up all of the leftover poutine and enjoyed it by myself. In peace and quiet."

We tried eating as much as possible and couldn't finish. Both were delicious and we were surprised to see everybody around us finish their poutine. Bec Cola was interesting as it was flavored with maple syrup. 10/10 would recommend.

Yep, I learned the hard way when I tried to order it at a Dairy Queen and the employee looked at me like I was a stupid American), my studies have shown me that the cheese should be squeaky when you bite down on it.The cheese in the poutine at Resto La Banquise did just that. Granted, this was my first time trying poutine so I really have nothing to compare it to (not including that Dairy Queen fiasco) but something just felt right. Was it the steamy hot gravy caressing each fry? Was it the smell that wafted through the air and into my heart? I don't know. All I know is that this place got it right.We only had enough time (and room in our stomachs) to try La Classique (the regular one) but if I ever come back to Montreal, I would surely try one with meat. Preferably bacon because c'mon...it's bacon!Tip - the regular size was enough to split between four girls since it is pretty heavy. Unless you're in training to become the next star of Man v.

/user_details?userid=cI4HOmEOCT8ig5e9nQsAwA,Joanna A.,"Dorval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It took far too long, but I can now proudly say that I have been to La Banquise!  Located at 994 Rue Rachel East in the Plateau, La Banquise is perfect if you're a tourist coming to Montreal, or a Montreal resident who has not been to this restaurant yet.  Don't make the mistake I did- GO.  Right now.  It was absolutely delicious and perfect for a night out with friends.  It was almost a year ago when I posted about going to Lola Rosa with our friend Ruedi, who was visiting from Switzerland.  You've guessed it- we were able to spend more quality time with him and this time, my best friend Ali was able to come too!  None of us had ever been to La Banquise before so this was a great opportunity to go.Haven't heard of La Banquise?  Well, it first opened its doors in 1968 and first served poutine in the 1980's.  When poutine was first added to the menu, they only offered two different kinds- the classic poutine and the italian poutine.  Fast forward to 2015, they offer no less than 30 types of poutine!  The restaurant which was originally a small ice cream shop, went through major renovations in 2006 to accommodate the growing amount of customers.  It is open 24 hours a day, which is great for those late night food cravings.  They also serve great breakfasts.  For now though, I'll talk about our experience.When we first arrived, we saw quite a long line of people waiting to get in.   Of course, it was a good sign, especially since it was raining and people still wanted to wait.  It took about 20 minutes for us to get in but because of the good company I was in, it didn't feel long at all.  When you walk in, you get to glance at some of the poutines offered which they display all over the walls.The venue is very bright and colorful.  You're in quite close vicinity to the other diners and the noise level does get pretty high because of everyone discussing the numerous meal possibilities.  It gets even harder to wait for your meal when you see your fellow diners receiving their delicious looking meals.Even though I had looked at the menu earlier on in the day, it was still VERY difficult to choose.  We all ended up choosing different dishes so we could sample one another's poutines- which made making a decision just a tad bit easier.  Once we ordered, we were asked to pay right away, even before getting our meal.  It took less than twenty minutes to get our food and once we did- we barely said three words to each other because we were enjoying our meals so much.  Here is what we had:Ruedi got the ""La Savoyarde"" poutine which is bacon, onions, swiss cheese & sour cream.  La Banquise also offers trios which consists of a burger, drink and fries.  However, you can replace the fries with a poutine and the soda with a beer of your choice. I don't know how anyone could resist the urge to replace the fries with a poutine... if you can do that, that is major willpower.  Ruedi chose the ""Costaud Burger"" - 2 patties, cheese, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, pickle, house sauce, all on a sesame seed burger bun.Ali got a large ""La Matty"" poutine which has bacon, green peppers, mushrooms & onions.  As you can see, the portions are quite big and although we are chicks who love to eat and CAN eat quite a bit- it got to the point where even though we had been eating for almost fifteen minutes, it barely looked like we made a dent in the food.  The prices are definitely good for what you get.John got the same burger as Ruedi, the Costaud Burger but for his poutine, he chose the ""L'Astérix"".  This poutine has smoked meat, mushrooms, sour cream & pepper sauce.As for myself, I got ""La Banquise"" Burger, which has 1 patty, mushrooms, fried onions, swiss cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, spicy sauce, all on a sesame seed burger bun.  The poutine I chose (after much consideration) was ""La Reggae"" - ground beef, guacamole, diced tomatoes & hot peppers.  Absolutely delicious.  I will now either have to recreate this every time I make a poutine at home or come back to La Banquise because no poutine will ever compare to it.  I had a few bites of my burger, a ton of poutine and I got so full, I gladly took the rest home.I definitely recommend this restaurant to any poutine lover.  They also have vegan options, healthy menus, kids menu and other assorted meals.  The food was so good, that I came home and ate most of my leftovers right away."

Needless to say it was delicious and packed full of the toppings, gravy and curds.  Must try when in Montreal!

After seeing the long line outside we convinced ourselves that it must be worth the wait. We painfully waited an hour+ in the freezing cold. I think because of the wait we had pretty high expectations but the overall experience was average. The service was great but the poutine was okay. We tried four different types and nothing amazed us. I had too much gravy on mine and my plate was too small for the large amount of poutine. This normally wouldn't be a bad thing except I couldn't mix all of the elements together for fear they would topple over and just felt very messy. I would go again if there is no line but would not wait in those conditions again. Recommend they fix or install more heaters outside for the waiting crowd in the cold.

I can't rave about this one enough. We also ordered a Montreal burger and that was the biggest detractor from the meal. The condiments were too strong and had a pronounced horseradish flavor that completely overpowered the sandwich.

Every time I'm in Montreal, I've always stopped by this place. It offers a variety of poutine with vegetarian options, and it's 24/7. What more can you ask for! Personally for me, the portions were really big, even when you just order the regular size. Then again, it could've just been filling. There's also the 'healthy' options (aka not poutine) for those of you who aren't a fan of gravy on fries. This surprised me when I had a friend who just wasn't into it."

The wait probably wasn't that long to get a table, but at the time, it felt like it. They're good at handling the line though.Lots of different choices on the menu. The six of us got three different kind of poutine to share. I think the group liked the classic er or original or something the best. I'm giving them 4 stars because it seems like everyone I was with really enjoyed the food, but I'm kinda feeling 3 stars for myself because I don't think poutine is really my thing. It's a little busy with all the toppings. But it's not La Banquise's fault, that's me, so 4 stars!"

However it was the reco from my Montrealer tour guide that sealed the deal for me setting on La Banquise as a destination.I ordered and recommend Le Miam which has ground beef and merguez sausage along with the classic gravy. However I kind of wish I tried the classic or T-Rex. If you are visiting its worth the wait for a manger (eat in) to drum up your anticipation, however it is much (much, much) quicker to order it a emporter (to go). There are two (2) separate lines. The day we went the a manger line was 15 minutes wait outside to enter the 15-20 minute wait inside to get a table. The emporter line allowed you to walk immediately up to the register.I've only known about poutine for 5 or 6 years. Must have been living under a culinary rock. Tried it for the first time in Canada on trip to Toronto in 2010. I think a few restaurants have put it on the menu I'm the U.S. However nothing previous compares to my experience at La Banquise."

We actually went in the morning right before our trek back to Buffalo..We didn't try the original but we opted for ones that I thought I might like and were more my taste buds. We got three plates total and we didn't even finish the ones we got ourselves, it was ALOT of food! Honestly most of it tasted the same because of the fries and gravy are all the same and the topping is what makes it different. The gravy and grease from the fries sometimes over power the toppings you had but you know your in for a good taste when you feel your arteries start to clog.

It's embarrassing that they brought our food and took it away without us paying first. We had a really rude waitress who was condescending and made us almost walk out. The only reason we stayed was because it was late and we paid for an uber to get here. It's a risk if you want good food but extremely crappy service.

/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Location: On the Plateau. The closest subway is probably Mont-Royal, street parking available (metered). But, if like me you prefer to burn off the calories BEFORE you stuff your face, I suggest walking from Point A to Point B. The place: La Banquise is of a decent size but it's not extra-large and seating is a little cramped. Be prepared for someone's arse to accidentally meet your face. Also, keep in mind that you're not going for the decor, which may or may not remind you of the 80s or 90s (and HEY - how about those Backstreet Boys in the background?!). When we got there, we didn't have to wait for a table, which is rarity in these parts. Of course, we chose a random time of day to get our poutine on (around 2pm).The goods: I wasn't feeling adventurous when I went so I got the Classic. My friend opted for the chicken and peas with vegan cheese. I'm aware of the Banquise's fab reputation, however though very good, I can't say I was blown away by my poutine. Did I enjoy it? Yes I did. The fries were good, the sauce was good - it could have used a little more cheese. I was pretty satisfied with my overall experience but if I were given a choice between La Belle Province and La Banquise, it would be a tough call between the two. All of that said, they ARE the poutine specialist and they offer a variety of crazy options so you should definitely check'em out.

/user_details?userid=cSNER_qF_bb1t7kN0kZ44Q,Christina L.,"Arlington, VA",4 star rating,"This was recommended to me by three locals, who all said this had excellent poutine, and one of the best in the city. I ordered the Le Classique, which is just the fries, gravy, and cheese curds. It seems a bit expensive to me: $6.95 for a plate of fries, gravy and cheese? It seems like it would cost them $0.50 to make something like this, but I'm not a poutine expert, nor have I eaten it a lot.To me, the poutine was just okay. The potatoes tasted sweet to me, the gravy was a bit runny and the cheese curds were kind of hard (I expected them to be softer and more melted). This was only my second time ever eating poutine, so you can take my review with a grain of salt. The fries were crispy, which was good, because soggy fries are never a good thing.My friend got the poutine with the smoked meat ($9.15) -- also pricey in my opinion, but she said it was the best poutine she had ever had.While I liked my poutine, I think there's probably still better elsewhere and I'll be on the hunt for it next time I return to Montreal.  I would still come back here and try the other flavors; best to come with 3+ people so that you can share different flavors.

Maybe if I were a hungry college kid at 3am it would have been good, but the quality of the toppings (when not meat- can't speak to the meat) is horrendous. Pretty sure it's crappy canned tomatoes, sliced black olives, the limp and sour grease-trap onions strings, flavorless guacamole, and the tiniest bits of cheese curds ever. It tasted like a clueless college student's ration pile. Such a disappointment. We picked through to try and find some more cheese curds or bites that would taste decent but I almost fished it were just naked fries and ketchup, it was that bad. We left 90% of the plate on the table and left feeling heavy and drowned from the stomach out. On top of that, they only take cash or Canadian debit (don't even get me started on this) so be prepared for that or be prepared to fight through the line of 18 year olds to get to the busted  and sketchy looking ATM and pay those fees.  Oh, and if you come after 9 (I think we got there at 9:03) they make you pay at the beginning... so as to avoid dine and ditchers. So strange... as if you'd be able to get out the completely blocked doorway anyway. But not strange was how the service totally dropped off after we paid.

So we got the 2 hotdogs platter w poutine. Fully loaded hotdogs were terrific! Poutine was UNTERRIFIC to say the least. Unsalted, cheese was tasteless, gravy cold and bland, and fries were just okay. I have to note that they had a number of poutine options (like in the pic) that looked decent. That being said, place was hopping and service was really efficient and friendly enough.

/user_details?userid=EXkM65SRwSYFe8eEjH8KPw,Kevin K.,"Queens, NY",1 star rating,"Hey, go ahead and ask me why I hate the poutine at Resto La Banquise?  Well, that's a very good question.  Let's go over the basics of Poutine.  It's fries served with a brown gravy and topped with cheese curds.  Yeah, it doesn't make you friends amongst Cardiologists, I have heard Quebecois refer to it jokingly as ""Montcalm's revenge"", but hey, sex is both funny and kinda disgusting, but who doesn't love getting it on, right?  Right. Poutine is the culinary equivalent of dirty itchy smelly sex that leaves you sweaty all over...so bad and oh so good.  Anyways, In order for poutine to be dirty sex satisfying, a competent establishment should meet several criteria for quality in such a simple (but by no means easy) product:  a) The fries must be crisp on the outside, savory and soft with some moistness on the inside, and not too thin so it'll hold up to an onslaught of gravy.  It should also be salted so it tastes good by itselfb) The gravy should be hot, flavorful and thick, so it'll provide a lipsmacking base of umami.  A good gravy reminds you of a good consomme...you can sip it by itself.c) The cheese curds should be room temperature, or at least it should not be cold.  It should squeak with milky freshness when you bite it.  It should be an ideal vehicle for absorbing and retaining the gravy flavors, and the population numerous enough to act as a meat-like counterpoint to the soft, crisp but bland potatoes.d) All 3 ingredients should form a sublime union, the resultant product a greater sum of its parts.  It should be both crisp and soft, potatoey-and-gravy-meaty, refreshingly cheesy - Quebec cheese curds, Nova Scotia/Ontario potatoes, and their confederation in a good, salty and flavorful, very warm gravy, enough to warm you up on a cool day.And Resto La Banquise...failed on all counts.  Let's start with the potatoes - thinnish potatoes that are inexplicably sweet (did they put sugar in there?  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING), which does not crisp up at all.   There's the gravy - a bit too thin, not much flavor, does not taste good by itself, and in the case of my serving of La Classique?  It was barely lukewarm.  The cheese?  Cool/cold - feels like they just took it out of the fridge.  It's supposed to be returned to room temperature prior to serving so it'll not cool down the gravy/fries when you put it in.  On top of that, it's not an entirely generous portion of it to mingle well with the fries and gravy to make it work.  I wonder if the line cooks preparing poutine hates its very existence and want it to bury it alive.  How else would you explain adding all those crazy toppings onto it to make it appealing to the obvious out-of-towners?I am disappointed by this supposed landmark, a pretender to the pantheon of culinary achievement, one that does not hold up to scrutiny.  The ingredients of greatness are probably there (the steamie hot dogs from Lesters were delicious, the seating is comfortable and the service is passably good), but their poutine needs work.Do not make limp fries, add sugar, dump pieces of cheese curds straight from the fridge, pour weak gravy on it and serve it lukewarm.  That's like asking the guys at Wilensky's to cut the sandwich, for the counterman at Schwartzs to cut the viande fumee thin and lean, or for the staff at Le Centre Bell to hoist a Bruins flag.  You don't go to St. Viateurs and ask them to make a salty doughy New York style bagel. You don't do stuff like that in Montreal and expect to get away with it.I suppose you want a good alternative for Poutine - okay, here's my suggestion: Patati Patata on Rue Rachel and Rue St. Laurent - there's a reason why they are constantly busy.  They have higher turnover, they also show their Poutine respect by making the fries crisper, the gravy thicker/more flavorful, and their cheese curds are not as cold.  The amount of curds were well balanced and the results blend better into the mix.  This is not to say that their poutine is the best, but they are definitely better.  Rotisserie Romado on Rue Rachel and Rue Buillion will do a good version as well, with lots of crispy salty fries, lots of fresh curds, and their gravy is actually spicy.  Damn the lines and order some with your chicken, and get some Sumol or Guarana.  As for this place?  I don't know.  I guess you should try it just to see how bad Poutine could be, just so you can hanker for much better ones somewhere else."

It was sooo good! They had so many options on their menu and I didn't know what to get. I stuck to the original poutine, but I was very curious about the guacamole on poutine so I got that as a side on my poutine. I didn't realize that the guacamole, tomatoes, sour cream poutine (Mexican Poutine I believe) did not include gravy. So eating my regular poutine with additional guacamole was definitely interesting. It wasn't as gross as it seems. It was actually quite tasty. I would say don't mix them like me unless you make the mistake of doing it or just love weird combinations of flavours. I definitely want to come back for their poutine with ground beef and onions! The line was pretty long. I came in with a group of 11 and they accommodated for us! The wait was about 20 minutes, but by the time we left the was a line out of the door and onto the street! PS. Don't expect to eat anything healthy here.

However, I stopped visiting for a while because I found out that I have celiac disease, which means no poutine sauce.However, fear no more!  The vegomane sauce (vegan poutine sauce) is now gluten free!  You need to be very specific with your waiter to ensure you do not get a vegomane poutine (unless daiya dairy free cheese is your forte) but celiacs and gluten intolerant people can now rejoice again!  Fries are made in a dedicated deep fryer.  I would be leery of their add on ingredients however, as I think they fry everything on the same surface.ENJOY!"

I liked the very casual atmosphere- the store quickly filled up with locals/regulars (there was a line when we left!) To me, locals lining up is a good sign.My boyfriend ordered the BOM (bacon, onion and merguez sausage) and i got the T- Rex (ground beef, bacon, hot dog sausage and pepperoni)- we ordered regular sizes, but out came these mountains of fries, cheese curds, and MEAT. I couldn't finish mine (but I'm very proud to say I was damn close to finishing it), so if you're going for two, maybe a good idea to just get the large portion.The poutine was FANTASTIC- fries were fresh (with a good mix of crispy ones and squishy ones that've been doused with gravy), cheese curds were starting to melt a little, and the meats were fresh off the grill! Wash it all down with one of their local beers.And its open 24 hours! Yet another reason to move to Canada... Healthcare, Hot PM, and heaps of poutine!"

La Banquise did not disappoint at all; it was delicious and for the price, let's get another! I ordered the poutine with bacon and added guacamole because why not? And it was delicious to the point I wanted another one. The place is decent, it is CASH ONLY but they do have an ATM inside for those unlucky ones carrying around credit cards.

Once arrived however (30 minutes later), we were greeted to two lines. If you are on the line which is going with the flow of the passing cars and taxis, that line is to sit inside the restaurant and pig out. The line opposite (going against the flow of traffic), is the take out line. Took my friend and I a couple of minutes to realize this but once we did, we were set.Everyone was professional from the security out front to the cashier who took my food to the one hottie who handled me my food( she reminded me of Agent Hill).Anyway once we got our grub, took a cab back to the apartment and dug in....good lord, this was deliciousness.  I had something called the ""le matty"" which came with poutine fixings but with addition like bacon, green peppers,onions....

I was dissappointed with my meal there a few years ago but I decided to give it another shot. This place, after all, is frequently acclaimed as the best poutine in Montreal. I strongly disagree. While La Banquise certainly is a Montreal mainstay and a cultural hub, it is by no means the best poutine. In fact, I'd call it mediocre. The gravy tastes as if it were made from a powder. The fries are OK but they are a far cry from the Thrashers fries I devour by the handful along the east coast's boardwalks. My friend and I shared the chicken patty poutine. While a generous portion, the dish lacked star power. Topping the average poutine were two pieces of microwaved patty chicken. Like the kind you get in the supermarket frozen aisle. I was almost offended that anyone would call this place the best. Banquise does share an impressive variety of poutines. But who cares? The cheese and gravy mask almost any flavor regardless. Skip La Banquise."

Admittedly, we couldn't see a sign for the shop, but the massive lineup(s) were definitely a beacon you could easily rely on to assure you, that you were in the right spot.Yes, I did mention lineups plural because if you didn't know that this spot was a restaurant you'd think that between the two separate lines (one of takeout, one for dining in) and the 2-3 massive black t-shirt wearing bouncers, that you were outside of a popular nightclub.The wait time to take out took forever. Not because they were slow, in fact, they were turning out orders pretty quick but the lineups were lengthy. After about 30-45 minutes it was finally my turn. Keeping it simple, I went with the Poutine Classique, just cheese curds, fries and gravy. I was so hungry by the time I ordered that I blacked out and ended up ordering the 'grande' aka large - big mistake, that is a massive 2 pounds of poutine.I chowed down as much as I could but had to leave the rest sitting on my countertop once I got home. It was massive,That said, the next morning should have been gross to even consider looking at the poutine leftovers, let alone eating them, but they totally held up and were friggen delicious!Big fan of the food these guys are doing and looking forward to returning for some of their more intricate poutines!Eatcrest Out!"

I ordered the Taquise Poutine which has tomato, guacamole, sour cream. It was ok.Its great that this place offers various styles and toppings of poutine but the ingredients are also mediocre.

I was begrudgingly dragged out of bed and into a cab by my friend to go to la banquise around 3am. Although I resisted at the time, our trip would have been incomplete without the late night visit. 24/7 poutine is an amazing concept. I seriously wish someone would bring it to the U.S.  Crispy fries with cheese, or really whatever toppings your heart desires? Who wouldn't love that? The drunken experience could be comparable to IHOP, but with a slightly cooler crowd and much better food. We tried the classic poutine and a chicken sandwich. Both were crispy and flavorful and cooked to perfection. I also got a cup of coffee to keep me awake. I tend to be a coffee snob but it was surprisingly good. As a tourist it was interesting to sit back and people watch the young crowd. There wasn't a line when we got there around 3am, but passed by quite a few people waiting as we left.

I was expecting quite a bit as well seeing the long lineup. When we finally got seated, the server was a bit slow however we can understand given the busy area. We ordered 3 different poutines, including a regular, and a onion rings and burger as well. The price seemed not bad given the portions we were provided. However this is about all i can say in terms of positive for it. overall i find that the poutine was not very spectacular it was pedestrian at best. The mixture of ingredients was simple thrown on top, and the gravy which is basically the life blood of what poutine is, was simply bland and not special. it seemed they simply were intent to throw as many things as possible, not carrying how the flavour would match. The smoked meat that was placed in one of the pountine was simply not good. They needed better smoked meat. and the burger was average at best. The onion rings were nothing to scream home about it was about the only thing where i would say they did not give a good sized portion. This place seemed good at one thing which was give you a good portion for the price in terms of poutine. Other than that, they take an awfully long time to cook poutine, which doesn't make sense, it is fries with gravy and cheese on top. There really isn't a complicated process to it. i have to say i was very disappointed at a place that was labelled by so many as the best montreal has to offer in poutine."

Fries, gravy, and cheese curds (plus exotic topping improv including meat and peppers) made the most delicious dinner after a day of traversing the city - knocking me off my very sore feet.At first thought, you would think it's too easy: lard on top of lard under lard = tasty. But, it really is so much more. Any nacho jockey can throw batches of saturated fats together in a grease sauce and call it a specialty. But, at risk of sounding like a pretentious foodie, the taste is actually rather complex: smokey and salty, crispy and saucy, and oh so cheesy. If you go to Montreal and miss this place, you should be forced to donate the $10 that you would've spent to a charity and provide someone else with the kind of happiness you willfully neglected."

We also tried the bugaloo, which had decent bbq pork flavor. The regular size orders of poutine are served on a plate that's too small to hold the contents, making it hard to eat.

It was so good we had poutine from here three times during our week long visit.     I had the poutine savoyarde au poivre, the traditional poutine and a poutine with chicken and bacon. Each variety was better than the last and made my stomach very happy. The beer selection features beers made in Canada, many of which I had never seen or heard of before. It was exactly what I wanted. I love immersing myself fully into the culture of those around me when traveling. I loved the beers so much, I just wish I could find some of these small breweries beers here in LA.    The service was awesome, even when I mispronounced au poivre and the waitress thought I had said avec pee.

However, each time I queued to eat inside I felt the wait was painless and moved along in good time.There's seating in the back outdoor dining area but you aren't allowed to order alcoholic beverages outside so naturally we opted for a table inside.Service was friendly and they functioned like a well oiled machine taking our orders and presenting our food in the blink of an eye. We received the bill promptly when requested, and like every restaurant outside the US we  paid with our credit card at the table. They have an excellent menu of unique poutines. Since we were stuffed to full capacity trying to eat two regular plates in our last visit, this time we opted to share one regular sized plate. We had the L'Asterix ($10.80 for regular/$16.35 for large) which includes smoked meat(a Montreal specialty), mushrooms, sour cream & pepper sauce.

We had researched on the best poutine places in Montreal and this restaurant came up multiple times. Maybe because of that I had very high expectations for the food. I am a vegetarian and I really liked how they had multiple veggie options. However, when the food came, it was not hot and the fries were soggy. The restaurant was very busy, so I am guessing that was the reason for the soggy fries. Overall, it was not as good of an experience as I thought it was going to be."

I was the happiest person ever!!Anyways, the fries are crispy even with the gravy; the poutine was tasty and very good!

The line was long, but we were only 2 so got to skip ahead of many people - woo hoo! This is my first time having poutine so I have nothing to compare it to. However, this place has TONS of options. I'm glad I tried poutine, but not really sure that I need to have it again. It is a TON of food - I couldn't finish mine and neither could my friend. I got poutine with ground beef, guacamole and tomatoes though there are tons of options as previously mentioned. Tip: Be sure to have cash as they only accept Canadian bank credit cards, but will accept CAD or USD cash. Highly recommend CAD though as the exchange rate was not good."
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Overrated is the first word that comes to mind concerning this very touristic attraction. It's good but let's be honest folks, it's simply not THAT good. Simply put, there's far better poutine to be had elsewhere in Montreal.Thus here's a review of a Montrealer for other Montrealers as well as tourists coming to town on what's what.La Banquise is a 24 hours, eat a variety of pre-established poutines to your heart's delight. The price tag has steadily gone up over the years with small sized STANDARD poutines close to $6 and the larger ones around $10. Obviously, it's far more expensive if you go all out with their toppings so it's not unusual to pay close to $13-15... FOR ONLY FOR THE POUTINE. They also offer other fast comfort food but let's be honest, you're coming here for the poutine... RIGHT???On a positive side, the portion sizes are generous. The standard plate should feed most people. The big plate is quite a treat.My major issue with La Banquise is not the price-tag, nor the service, nor it's ridiculous popularity as the GO TO place for poutine in Montreal but simply put... that it's simply a relatively weak poutine. The gravy just isn't that great and the fries aren't right. At least, that's my opinion.In more detail, the gravy lacks substance as it's probably made by the barrel for the non-stop flow of clients coming in and the fries are too thin. Frankly, I'm unsure if they're the best quality of potatoes possible for consumption. Are they even hand cut? It just BLAH, fries that are fried too quickly and they are quite soggy when received. Fries often make or break a poutine plate and this won't do. At least for me.I always recommend to folks to try to visit smaller mom & pop places that make a wicked poutine or perhaps even Poutineville if they want a popular place simply because one can make their very own poutine. Their gravy more consistently good and more importantly... the fries are the right kind with other options that exceed the standard poutine experience that I recommend to everyone willing to have THE BEST POUTINE! Heck, if your cheese curds aren't squeaky, you ain't getting the best poutine!!!I've been to worse Tourist traps in my life so feel free to experience it yourself but be warned, it's simply not the best Montreal has to offer...far from it. So for those of you coming to Montreal, Yelp search poutine and check your other options, La Banquise isn't the best place to have poutine.No, this isn't a ploy to shorten the line-up. :)"

Definitely give La Banquise a try if you're in the neighborhood but if you're not a fan of waiting in lines, then you may want to consider one of the many other poutine shops in town! :)"

For my taste, not enough cheese. It was very busy; we went around 4pm and the place was nearly full. They have a small selection of some local beer, and they have their own house beer (a pilsner). I'd imagine the poutine would be better at 2am after some drinks, seeing that this place is a 24 hour restaurant."

/user_details?userid=zIXUuzj1c819jQLkqTfBBQ,Annie D.,"Mississauga, Canada",1 star rating,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS.What an absolute disappointment of a place!I don't think I have ever had such a negative experience at an eatery in my life.It started off fine. We were seated in the outside patio area (which is cute and saves you from the stuffiness of the interior seating). The waitress was friendly enough. I let her know that I don't eat beef but liked some of the flavour combos with beef and so was going to substitute the beef for merguez sausage which I told was lamb. So I ordered the La Reggae substituting the beef for merguez sausage and after a 30 minute wait I got my poutine, with merguez sausage and beef!! So when I bought up the issue to her, she looked confused and asked me  what I wanted with the biggest dose of attitude. She kept insisting that I had asked for both beef and marguez sausage which was astonishing. Then she disappeared.After about 15 minutes another waitress came over, after I flagged her down. I explained the situation that I don't eat beef and that I wanted the La Reggae with the sausage instead. She then informs me that the sausage is also beef. OK! Well then I asked for the La Reggae with bacon. Keep in mind that this was now altogether more than 1 hour since we had come in and my friend was almost done her poutine. Not an word of apology. No sense of urgency. Nothing.I chalked it up to a miscommunication. But my bff who speaks French said that it was pretty clear that I said I didn't eat beef, so there was no way the 1st waitress should have mistaken that for an addition and not substitution.Twenty minutes later, I got my La Reggae with bacon and when I say bacon, you literally could not see the bacon, even after I moved around the fries and the mountain of guacamole. So after trying to flag down the waitress for another 10 minutes, I asked her where the bacon was. She proceeds to point at a shard of bacon in the guac and says that ""There is the bacon, when you substitute you get 3 pieces of bacon."" This was opposed to the heaping mountain of bacon you get if you just order the cheaper La Bacon which people around me had. Don't you think that would have been pertinent information to maybe tell a customer!?!? The attitude was just flowing out of this waitress like you could not imagine. I tried explaining the situation again and pointed out that I'd been here 1.5 hours trying to get my order right and was told ""what you want me to do"". To say that I controlled my anger in that situation and left ASAP after paying $13 for mushy fries under a mountain of tasteless guac, would be an understatement.Now my friend who had her order arrive properly, was also very underwhelmed. She used to worked in McDonalds back in her youth and told me that the dark color of the fries are due to reusing old oil which is very unhealthy. She found the poutine to be average at best.I feel like that this place is a tourist trap, counting of their high reviews as a way of lowering service standards.I had much better poutine at the A&W afterwards."

The cheese isn't as plentiful as one might want but the fries are spot on.Also it's not a spot to sit and chat as they are always busy and those waiting at the entrance for a table were staring at us with hungry eyes.

And by guacamole i mean mostly this and fries under. I remember going there a few years back and they would have a better sour cream ratio. I ordered a steamed hot dog as well but the bread was dry and old.The poutine was delicious tho. My husband got La Danse, which was chicken, onions, and pepper sauce, he ate all of it because it was delicious.When you order after 9pm they make you pay in advance after you've ordered the food.

I had decided before we entered that the perfect Poutine to really experience this affair to the fullest would be: T-rex with topping of gravy and guacamole. Grande for two of us to share.And i was not disappointed. It was a jungle of meat and fries and each forkful was a slightly different concoction.

Now, I can't really say that its the best, because I haven't tried them all, but wow, this was amazing!Far off of the beaten path of tourism we trekked to La Banquise after finding numerous recommendations online. We were not disappointed. The place has a decent-sized dining area as well as outdoor dining in the back. Service was quick and pleasant.I ordered the Savoyarde Poutine which was your standard poutine, topped with bacon, grilled onions, swiss cheese and sour cream. The cheese curds and swiss got nice and melty under heaps of fries and gravy. It was so delicious that I never wanted to stop eating. Unfortunately, I hit the wall of my stomach's limitations and had to stop. This was the regular size, so I'm afraid of what the large size would have looked like!Husband ordered the Boogalou Poutine with pulled pork, creamy coleslaw and sour cream. He graciously allowed me to try this and it was so so good! He also could not finish, but we both certainly tried!Husband also had a local beer, Coup de grisou which was thoroughly enjoyable and I had a nice Limoneta San Pellegrino which was a refreshing compliment to my poutine. Every time I have poutine, I grow more and more disappointed that most American's have never tried and do not understand the perfect combination of deliciousness that they are missing. Our ""disco fries"" never even come close to the pure magic of crisp fries, perfect cheese curd and piping hot gravy.

We sat down around 2:30 on a Wednesday. Most of the tables were bustling by the time we left. Classic poutine: cheese curds, gravy, fries. Vegan poutine: shredded vegan cheese, vegan gravy, fries.  Fries were a great slightly crispy on the outside texture and soft on the inside. Good for grabbing all that gravy and cheese. Good ratios for all the three ingredients to have together - wasn't too much or too little of any of the flavors. Would happily recommend to vegetarians or meat eaters."

It has many type of poutine even vegetarian poutine! I choose vegetarian poutine which comes with cheese, bell pepper, onion, mushroom & sauce. Poutine was super great and you definitely check here out when you visit Montreal.  I know this place is quite popular but we didn't wait a line because we arrived before dinner time (5ish?). After us, many people waited a line and the place was packed. So, rule of thumb, just avoid prime time, would be helpful if you don't want to be in a long line."

I expected to be in love with poutine here when I finally put it in my mouth. I should preface,  I'm a vegetarian so not all poutine caters to me and I therefore may not have ever really developed the taste for it.  The vegan sauce is why we selected La Banquise for our poutine quota.  I actually don't know if I truly get the appeal of poutine.   That being said,  I  had already has some I liked in Quebec city so I figured my peeps out west may just be screwing it up.   Anyways,   I got a grilled cheese and a Rachael poutine with vegan sauce.  I regret all the vegetables... wish I had tried the plain as grilled veggies added nothing for me.  Also,  I was over my poutine after a few bites and it was disappointing to feel the need to eat most of my plate. The few bites were good and all but I was still over the whole meal very quickly.    The grilled cheese was nothing special but well executed... I almost would have rather a second of those and some stolen fries from my husband.  I don't think the poutine was executed poorly... I just don't think poutine is in my blood.   I also felt wickedly ill for several hours following my poutine and that's not really worth it (some food is though...).  Hubs had the 3 amigos (or something like that) and does say it was the best he'd ever had.... he also liked my Rachel with the vegan sauce so it wasn't just my gravy.   Thus,  there is a hope for you and La Banquise and maybe it's worth the line and the potential dietary upset for a taste. One thing to note.... debit or cash ONLY here.  If you bring only credit you'll be washing dishes ;)I would try Montreal poutine again but I think I would pass on this place due to it's excessive popularity and my limited interest."

We also had La Miam (ground beef, onion, tomato, merguez sausage, swiss cheese) which was heavier than the first and the tomatoes didn't do much as the pieces were too large. Also had a bit of Hamburger Steak - not bad. There was a long wait when I arrived at lunchtime but they were all just waiting for take-out, so make sure to ask & check.

/user_details?userid=skbZO4vHHHA-ejA_BUwKjg,Jeffrey C.,"Silicon Valley, CA",3 star rating,"POUTINE, part deux. (The first sample was at Frite Alors, a Montreal chain).La Banquise gets a wink and gun for being one of the classic Montreal poutineries (yes, that's an amazing word that exists in real life). But if we're taking votes, I preferred my Frite Alors experience. Like fellow legendary food establishment Schwartz's, La Banquise can get a ridiculous wait. Unlike Schwartz's, I don't think it's worth the investment.For the wait averse, there's a to-go option at La Banquise, which we took advantage of rather than waiting in line. After ordering, we waited a short 10 minutes and hailed it to the nearest stoop to dig in.Again, my take on poutine is to get the base model, no fluff. Give me frites, give me curds, give me gravy, call it a day. Thus, it's hard to produce a truly electrifying poutine, since the differential tends to be the unnecessarily piled on toppings. It's like ordering a New York slice with seventeen ingredients, or Texas BBQ with five kinds of sauce. Don't do it.Anyways, the easiest way to screw up poutine? Start with fries that are too soggy to withhold the gravy dairy onslaught. Unfortunately, that's where La Banquise didn't hold up. Gravy? Good. Curds? Good. Fries? Not so much."

Thankfully it wasn't too cold out and the wait was approximately 30 mins. It was a bit odd as right after we ordered, the server told us we had to pay right away as it was after 9pm. I have never had to do that before! I honestly thought he was singling us out but another table beside us had to do the same thing. I guess they've had bad experiences in the past for those who leave without paying after a certain hour? We ended up tipping afterwards.Got to try the smoke meat poutine. It was delish!

Compared to the poutine-savvy, Quebecois population of Montréal, my poutine knowledge is slightly lacking at best -- other than the fact that I know how to pronounce it correctly, I've only had it a few times in my life at bars and restaurants that serve it as a niche menu item/appetizer because well, it's incredibly easy and cheap to make (Put together scraps of a chef salad, a burger entrée, and a faux-thanksgiving meal and voila! Poutine.)Despite me being a novice to the cuisine, I can tell when my taste buds are telling me if I'm eating something crotch-grabbingly delicious, in the same way my ocular nerves are telling me that I'm being exposed to something that ""shocks [my] conscience,"" (that's Rochin v. California (1953) for us yanks, Canada v. Schmidt (1987) for you canucks) and Poutine La Banquisois was one that definitely left me in shock and awe.As per recommendations, I ordered La Classique and the T-Rex with a friend. Even before I had a chance to get half way through my can of Coke Diete, the two massive plates of fries and assorted meats, piled up to heaven with cheese curd and golden brown gravy graciously descended onto our table from the very attractive server's hands and was staring us right in the face.For those of you familiar with Frank Yang and his irresponsible culinary escapades, (the one where he eats over 4000 calories in a few hours for the sake of bulking) there has not been a better ""eat me, eat me!"" moment in my life both on and off the dinner table so far.Disgusting visual images aside, cheap and delicious poutine in a very relaxed atmosphere, served around-the-clock by beautiful women in the beautiful city of Montréal.

Silly me, I went back a couple times over the years (including a couple months ago), trying a different poutine every time, in order to understand why French Quebecers swear by their culinary Gods that poutine at la Banquise is the best (in the world). On average, the fries seems overcooked and fried at low oil temperatures: the fries are greasy, hard, and not crispy. The gravy is generally too salty and tasteless. The toppings come in below average portions, but they got their cheese curds right.I guess it can become a good choice for curing hangovers since it's open 24/7, when you're too drunk to taste the difference. In terms of pricing... it generally comes down to 15$-20$ (taxes, tips included), which is not worth at all, considering its quality and quantity. I'd rather get McDonald's."

We went on a Saturday around mid-morning and waited maybe 15-20 mins. for a 4-person table. The interior of the restaurant is cramped in a busy diner fashion, with bright colors, mosaics, and mirrors everywhere. There were groups of 20-somethings alongside families with kids, which made for a festive atmosphere.The menu is crazy expansive, with many kinds of poutine alongside other breakfast and lunch fare, even salads, if you're not up for completely clogging your arteries. We wisely ordered just two small poutines for the table, alongside lighter lunches. One was le B.O.M. (bacon, onion, merguez sausage) -- intense! But we actually preferred the other, which was the vegan version of le Classique (just straight up gravy and cheese curds). It was flavorful and had a better balance. The sandwiches and salads we got outside of poutine were fine but unremarkable.Would I come here on a regular basis for a snack on my own? Maybe not.

The ambience of the place was great. The waiters were gorgeous, so as the food . Best thing is they don't wear the uniform as the regular food chains. The menu has the history of the restaurant , that started in 1963. Let me tell u, a place packed on a Monday night at -9 with blowing snow, u seriously need to visit this place . Ordered 4 different items so as to share with my friends. One thing I can say, there poutine was great with all the cheese curds and gravy . If you are a group of 4 people that don't mind sharing food with your friends, each of u should order different poutine and taste it . It's really nice. The menu has different beers that goes along with the poutine . Try them ."

There was a bit of a wait on a Saturday night and the line extended out of the restaurant, but it thankfully moved quickly to get us out of the cold.We ordered La Elvis which had steak haché (ground beef), mushrooms, and green peppers on top of poutine (fries, cheese curds, gravy). It was as tasty as it was gut-busting! Although a bit disappointing because:1) The regular size is not as big as I had imagined from reading reviews. Order a large if sharing with another person.2) The fries could have been crispier. While I understand there should be an allowable soggy-ness factor from sitting under all those toppings and gravy, I would have enjoyed it more if the untopped fries on the sides had more crunch!Overall it fulfilled my obligatory duty to eat poutine, but perhaps next time I'm in Montreal, I'll check out another spot."

We got the poutine to go, which may have been our mistake. It was the last day there and we were literally packed up to go and decided to make a stop before our long travel home. I got the corn dog poutine, and I guess the server misheard me because they only put corn dogs and nothing else...no onion or bacon as they list on the menu. And it was SO soggy, not crunchy at all like I've had at every other place. I should have checked. But then my boyfriends chicken poutine had a really weird taste like the chicken was cooked in a sauce that was completely different from the gravy and it was so off... strange. We would definitely go back and try it again, take our time and order a few. It was super busy so we were rushing too. I'll give it another try for sure. The gravy was delicious though."

We knew what to expect (aka not a culinary orgasm) but we were a bit disappointed - that poutine tasted... cheap. We then (not the same day!) tried the chicken and chorizo poutine from Ma Poule Mouillée, and I would totally recommend going there rather than at La Banquise - fries are better, meat is better, sauce is better and cheese is better (do you see some kind of pattern here?)So all in all, I understand the convenience of a 24/24 poutine spot, with plenty of poutine variations to choose from, but if you want a good poutine, there are better spots in Montreal..."

Perhaps not the best poutine I've ever consumed, but delicious nonetheless. The location is good for post Parc Lafontaine frolicking, or night out poutine cravings.On my most recent visit I discovered I'm starting to feel old. The music was just a little bit too loud, the tables a little bit too close. And the music being played reminded me of what I would have had on my iPod as a teenager ... Because iPods didn't exist back then. The clientele though was a mixed bag, ranging from teens to a couple to older people, so it wasn't the fellow patrons that made me feel old.  The poutine though?  Still delicious!  Some things never change."

/user_details?userid=PtlEx6RrQXHBMZ_1c9mLzg,Alex J.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Poutine has always been a staple of Montreal fast food. This little dinner opened in the 60's and has since become the most talked about poutine restaurant in the province. ?Even people from out of town quickly gravitate to it once they reach Montreal.Sure a few have tried to imitate La Banquise by creating a multi-poutine menu with dozens of varieties. But none have ever come close to La Banquise and none ever will. Some even try to franchise themselves, opening a slew of restaurants under the same name to try to make themselves more recognizable, but again, they are only second rate to the original poutine master.I have to admit that in the dozens of times I have gone to this fabulous restaurant, I have never tried the regular poutine (fries, gravy, cheese). I have always tried a different type of gastronomic perfection, my favourite being the Taquise: a regular poutine combination plus guacamole, diced tomatoes and sour cream. As most who read this will likely imagine, it can be difficult to accept. But the moment you see it presented, in its glorious stacked ingredients beauty, you know you're in for a treat. And the taste is unbeatable. I suggest adding a little Tabasco sauce if you want that extra edge.The price is extremely reasonable . The only thing that could be improved is the service, but this is to be expected for a place as popular as this. If anything, they could extend their kitchen and double their waitresses on Friday and Saturday nights, but hey, if you're there at that time, chances are that you've had a few drinks already and you won't even see the time go by."

I know it probably seems very touristy, but I did want to find some awesome poutine in Montreal. I've had poutine before, but I've been told you can't really get great poutine outside of Quebec, and I wanted to see if that was the case. So I put out a request on Twitter asking where to find good poutine. I got a response back saying La Banquise, so I thought I'd check it out.Resto La Banquise is apparently open 24 hours, and when I got there around 2pm it was busy. It seems like it's probably busy almost all the time. I got a seat outside, in a nice courtyard area, and proceeded to order poutine. First any good Canadian will be able to attest to the fact poutine needs hot fries (preferabbly fresh cut, which these fries seemed to be), gravy, and arguably most important of all cheese curds (the squeakier the better). If you're visiting Montreal, or Canada just know real poutine uses cheese curds, not grated cheese or cheese sauce.The restaurant was really busy when I was there, but it seems to be the kind place that's always busy. The waitress was very friendly, and my poutine came out perfect and pretty fast. Definitely a good place if you're craving some poutine, or if you've never had this delicious delicacy."

Their base is french fries (with a unique sweetness), the gravy was excellent, and the cheese curds were perfectly squeaky. Being from SoCal, we love guac on all things, so we thought 'since we're getting creative with poutine, let's add in a favourite'. The dish came and their regular size was still too large for two people to finish. The toppings on the T-Rex were fun and had good flavour; the hot dog was a fun twist.  My favourite part? The fries themselves! Slightly sweet, cooked perfectly, fluffy texture.

La Banquise is cited by pretty much everyone as THE place to try poutine in Montreal. So off I went, stomach rumbling.What a let-down. There's a line out the door that, while somewhat fast-moving, is jumbled and stressful. The menu is overwhelming, but I settled on the T-rex (poutine topped with ground beef, hot dogs, bacon, and some kind of sausage). It came out looking incredible, but tasting like nothing. How can a pile of so many meats be bland? Honestly! I had to drown it in Tabasco just to feel like I was experiencing something. (That's a sad sentence.)I paid and left, feeling extremely disappointed. Did I really fly all the way from New York City to have shitty poutine? They serve up better poutine at Harlem Public or Jacob's Pickles in Manhattan! Luckily, Montreal's poutine reputation was redeemed by the AMAZING bowl of goodness being served up at Le Saloon Bistro Bar in the Gay Village. Got my fat girl noms ON at that place.But La Banquise... man... I'm sorry, but I don't get it."

The regular size is a good portion and likely enough unless you are feeling very hungry. I shared two poutines and although the toppings were exciting, one of the combos felt like it had been thrown together ""just because"" and seemed a little gimmicky. However, I didn't get to try more than two items so I can't say for certain! Regardless, I definitely enjoyed and would recommend the Elvis! I came here for lunch on a weekday, just missed the line, and got seated right away.

It has a very casual vibe, almost feeling like a upscale fast food joint. There was fun music playing and all the staff would sing along while running back and forth between errands.The menu had many, many options that were very customizable. I chose the La Maty, a mix of bacon, green peppers, onions and mushrooms. I added ground beef as suggested by the waitress.My friends who is a vegan was delighted to see that there was a vegan poutine, which he thoroughly enjoyed. The food was good and very filling, I believe that this place is popular because of the heavy options and the exciting environment. I don't know if I would argue that it was the best poutine I've ever had, as it felt more like a dinner than a traditional poutine.

There were so many options and different varieties. We ordered the shoot-out to share, which includes smoked meat, spicy sausage, and bacon. It tasted amazing.

The service wasn't remarkable nor was it slow. We were seated quickly and swiftly by a friendly waitress that seemed to know only very rudimentary English. She's hardly to blame since it's located on Le Plateau and half of the residents there look at me like a booger is hanging out of my nose whenever I start a conversation in English.The meat happened to be better than the actual poutine. The fries were above average but there were more stretchers in the restaurant than there were bits of cheese in my poutine. In my honest opinion, the gravy was inferior to many places I've been to. It wasn't anything close to the thick petroleum tar you get at Decarie Hotdog but it was cheap, thick and tasteless.The meat was in substantial quantity and it felt like they neglected the rest of the poutine because of it. The hot dogs are cheap and most likely came from Super C's 8 for 2$ packages that sit on shelves for months before a poor sod tests his luck at not getting an indigestion.The selection of poutine is huge though. You'll find one for you.The atmosphere and ambiance is nice. Everyone was happy, the restaurant is cozy and surprisingly well aerated for such a small place. We sat approximately 5m away from the kitchen fryers and the air heavy with grease.Kudos on it being 24 hours though.This is honestly more of a tourist attraction than anything."

However, it might be a little overrated knowing that it's possible to find the same quality or even better in the area.The restaurant is so popular that it's often crowded and depending on the time of day or the night, you might have to line up.

They have a number of poutine options that add things like onions, bacon, sour cream (basically the Savoyarde, which is what I got), guac, hot dogs, etc. you can also just go for the classique poutine. The portions were huge, so if you're getting other food like a burger, you could probably just split the order of poutine with someone. I also ordered the Chevre burger and replaced the meat with a veggie patty. The veggie patty was really good, didn't taste frozen, and the burger in general came our beautiful and looked like a picture in a burger ad. The burger came with a really good sized slab of goat cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, and their special sauce. The food was delicious, but we just could not finish it all, so we ended up taking it to go.

Well, that's not true, it IS amazing at 4:00 in the morning when you have a belly full of beer.I don't want to be the one to say ""poutine is just poutine"", but it kinda is.A mandatory stop if you're doing a poutine-a-thon, but if you're only interested in trying out poutine in Montreal, I'd go to Chez Claudette.

La Banquise never disappoints, unless you are looking for a healthy option at this very indulgent restaurant. I prepare myself before I endeavor to eat here, mentally and physically. I eat healthy for days leading up to my meal, I have a light breakfast, maybe no lunch before I embark on a plate of poutine, and I prepare my mental state for the fried goodness that is an experience at La Banquise. They have infinite options to try and their gravy is vegetarian based (super plus for the halal eaters!). I always order a plate of poutine, to SHARE, because let's be real, nobody actually finishes their own, and a side of the mixed appetizer platter which has delicious onion rings, jalapeno poppers and others. The best thing about La Banquise is that it's open 24/7! That means, if you have the munchies late night, are caught in a snow-storm, or just in the mood at 3 am, you have a place to go. The only negative is perhaps that you have to queue up to get a table here, a small price to pay, for honestly the best poutine in town."

How the hell do people in Montreal stay as thin and svelte as they do with places like Resto La Banquise perpetually having a line?Question 2: How the hell can you have a menu with only about 25 different types of poutine and a few hot dog and hamburger options and perpetually have a line?Question 3: Why hasn't the poutine crazed infested NYC (I know it has been tried in the LES but, really, that's it?).Questions I pondered after waiting in line in the freezing Montreal winter cold for 25 minutes, being cramped at a table for 2 and eating 2 small orders of poutine: one, the classique, the other, the smoked meat with pepper sauce.Surrounded by Quebecoise families (all skinny and French speaking may I add) and tourists alike, this poutinnerie has been deemed best poutine in Montreal. Hmmmm. I wouldn't say that. But, it was solidly good and there is definitely a poutine wow factor with the amazing long list of varieties from Mexican Poutine topped with guac and sour cream to the pizza topped with pepperoni, mushrooms and peppers.I preferred the classique version over the smoked meat and pepper sauce version though having the combo was definitely a smart move. Too much of the same taste would have been old and definitely not worth the calories. The smoked meat however wasn't filled with flavor and was a bit of a let down.In and out in like 30 minutes filled to the brim with delicious gravy covered fries with cheese curds = 4 stars. Worth the wait for the poutine? Hmm, I don't think so. Worth the wait for the tourist factor and feeling part of the local scene and being able to say you've dined here to locals? Yep."

It's open 24 hours.. and hey! you have the La Fontaine Park just in front (During the summer it must be awesome to order and sit by).As far as poutine, I do believe that they are overrated. The gravy is good and their fries are just okay (nothing that would amaze you). You well have a lot of choices to pick from the menu, that's a fact.According to me..

It was delicious. The smoked meat was perfect, not dry. The fries were still crispy & the cheese curds still chewy. The perfect poutine consistency. The serving was way too big in my opinion, not sure how anyone could finish the large. La Banquise also serves burgers & other food items. Can't imagine ever having room for other food besides poutine. They lose a star for the beer menu. I was hoping to wash down all of that gluttonous poutine with local Quebec beer."

The waitress pretty quickly realized that we never tried the food before and then was very helpful with recommending the size to order. We tried two different sauces and where very happy with how it tasted. I would say it was a good Pountine but I have to admit that I don't have any comparison. The crowd at the restaurant was very laid back and you could see all kinds of people - business men and women, families, tourists and just friends hanging out.

The poutine sauce is vegetarian (according to our friendly server) and there's other choices for sauce including pepper sauce and gluten free vegan sauce. Plus you can add extras and other toppings so all the poutines are pretty much customizable. There a long wait outside at night- but it's definitely worth the wait.

Basically, it's poutine with beef, corn and caramelized onions. Pretty simple recipe, but it tasted very delicious. The large is easily a meal for 2 or 3. It's big and will set you back about 15$. Ended up eating outside under a tree in the rain because I walked here from the metro.

I loved the decor and feel of the place. We ordered 3 different poutines- original, hot dog, and beef/mushrooms/green peppers. We also ordered a hamburger and 2 side salads. The food took a really, really long time, and the service was also pretty slow in general. However, the wait was totally worth it! We ordered the regular poutine size, but they were BIG. None of us finished our plates. The burger was small but delicious and cheap, about $3.50. The side salads were pretty basic, but one of my friends didn't like the seasoning they used. The poutine was delicious. They mostly just throw the additional things (hot dogs, mushrooms, etc.) on top of the original poutine. I loved the hot dog poutine.Definitely worth a trip if you're in search of some delicious poutine and a cute restaurant! When we left, there was quite a long line- so go early!"

With a never ending list of ingredients chucked in such as avocado, smoked meats, bacon, sour cream, you name it, you'll be spoiled for choice. The regular or small size definitely filled me up and could potentially be shared between two people, seriously filling stuff and especially great for a late night out after drinking.

But before you enter this establishment to try their famous poutines, you might want to join a gym and make sure you stick to a strict diet for a few months afterwards. But more on that later.We went clubbing all night. We were drunk. We were hungry and needed to sober up on a Saturday night; actually morning, it was 3:30AM. We carefully made our way over to this place and low and behold, a friend that we thought we had long lost a few hours before was in front of the line waiting for us. We cut everyone and proceed to be seated about five minutes later. Sweet.For those who might be left out in the dark, poutine is a local specialty from Quebec and consists of fries covered in cheese curbs and gravy. It's not a healthy meal but tastes delicious.The three of us ordered three different poutines - shut up, we know it's unhealthy but we had to try it! - we settled for the T-Rex Poutine (minced meat, pepperoni, bacon and smoked sausages), the Obélix Poutine (smoked meat) and the Frank Poutine (merguez sausage). We paid right after ordering and just minutes later our three plates arrived. After feeling a great deal of shame, we devoured each plates, each bite slicing our dignity (we had little left at that point) and we were left starring at the empty plates, embarrassed. We had each consumed a ridiculous amount of calories at that point, enough to discourage us from cabbing it back to the hotel; we instead walked all the way back which took over 30 minutes.Months later I'm still burning that stuff off but hey, it was well worth it. Just make sure to try it if you haven't been, it's a must visit place in Montreal.

I opted for take out of a small order of their speciality poutine L'Astérix (smoked meat, mushroom, sourcream, and pepper sauce) Now that's a lot of toppings and let me tell you it was. As open the box, it looked like a pile of random put together with no disregard of what's in it. The smoked meat tasted like rubber and undercooked for my taste, when mixed with the pepper sauce, that spice taste made it a bit bitter in a way that you couldn't even taste the cheese curds properly. By the end of it is my want for this diminish, bit my pocket and frozen hands disallowed me from not eating it so I had no choice but to finish it.

We super lucked out and walked in just before the line filled out to the door and down the block. They have packed every possible space in this place with a seat. Little did I know this place was a total institution in Montreal.I got the vegetarian poutine with hot peppers (not too hot) and mushrooms, a small (which by anyone else's standards is a large)... and I'm so, so glad that I did, because I probably would have stuffed my face with the large if it was sitting in front of me.

You can be sure they take American cash if you don't have Canadian, but you can also be pretty sure you're paying the Canadian price in American dollars (i.e. +20%). Not sure why I'm surprised.

We went at about 530 and there was a line up but it was nothing compared to the line up we saw coming out of the restaurant.I ordered ""the reggae"" which was not on the menu but my friend from Montreal highly recommended it. IT WAS DIVINE. I am also a huge lover of guac so this poutine was everything I could dream of and more. The service is okay but the place is so busy. The servers however, are super friendly.

There are much better places to get poutine in Montreal (Poutineville! - way better quality and so much more choice than La Banquise).The quality of the food and service has gone completely downhill at La Banquise. The last few times we went (at various times of the day and night) we weren't super happy with the service and food quality, but it's not exactly fine dining, so we didn't really bother too much about it, but after my experience there today I will never go back.My husband and I went in for breakfast just before 10am. There were only about 5 other tables in the restaurant, and at least 4 people working in the kitchen. We ordered our food, got coffee and watched for an hour as everyone else got served, including two tables that arrived after us, before the waitress finally came to tell us there was a mistake with our order and it would only be a few more minutes (at about 10:40am). Not only did we watch as the other guests were served, BUT we also watched as various kitchen staff members left the kitchen with their own plates of poutine and other things both before and after the waitress came to tell us this news.After another 15 minutes, our food was still not there, so we decided to leave and go to Poutineville since they open at 11am. To top it off, they actually charged us for our coffees before leaving and didn't seem to feel badly at all about what had happened!! Terrible customer service. Seriously, never again."

Even takeouts required 10 mins+ wait. So do your homework and figure out what you want before ordering is a smarter way.I ordered a regular sized classic poutine (without meat) for takeout as the wait for dine-in was too long. It's a big portion, so don't order large size if you're not super hungry. I loved its piping hot gravy over fries, but wished the cheese curds were layered inside the pile of fries so they could be more gooey (cheese curds were a bit too cold) Don't get me wrong, they were still delicious regardless. Next time I should try the meat choices (TONS OF CHOICES TOO). Heard they were even better. It's not expensive either. Open 24 hours.I'm hungry now, LOL.3.5 stars"

I really wanted to finish it, but it was a lot! You get your moneys worth.  They had both indoor and outdoor seating. I couldn't tell if the indoor had ac so we decided to sit outside. Their outdoor seating was cute but small. I felt pretty hot sitting outside. Luckily, I was distracted by my poutine! The service was good, but not excellent. They also sold some craft beers.

Now let me tell you we were not disappointed. The poutine experience starts from the minute you walk in the door. It was a little bit busy, but you get to watch them make the poutines while you wait so time flies by.You get to your table then make sure you grab a beer they are all locally brewed and delicious. Next up... The poutine, now you may think wow so many options, trust me I had a tough decision deciding. First of all my brother wanted to share, however you defiantly need your home so I refused. I got the rachelle poutine with green peppers  onions mushrooms and let me tell you I finished every last bite on the plate regardless of how full I was. My brother got the classic and it was mouth watering. Don't be afraid to ask a stranger for a bite or two in order to try it out. The entire atmosphere and servers were all wonder.And don't forget no matter how full you are make sure to stop by for smoked meat sandwiches and bagels,after all that's what Montreal is for"

It was darn tasty, but to me poutine is still just something to have in Canada; I'll never crave it elsewhere.The clientele is a hearty mix of locals and tourists, and there's no shortage of photos or Instagram'ing going on at the tables.

I get it this place is busy and they are trying to get as many people in as possible. It was just uninviting service set up.  What if you want to order more drinks or food? Don't they want you to stay and spend money ? The poutine was subpar. Would only go to this place because it's open late.

I don't know how people spend more than half an hour here, so why the hour wait? It's not the loudest place ever, but that's because the music isn't turned up. Everyone else's voices echo over your table.The poutine: Bleh. BLEH, I say. The curds melted right in, no squeak at all. The fries were average to good poutine fries, I'll give them that, though not crispy the way I like it. The sauce was almost sugary, not at all what I want to taste on my poutine.I got the T-Rex. Let's see... it had bacon (half a strip at most, probably less), ground beef (plenty), pepperoni? (none), and hot dog (half a link at most, probably less). What it had a TON of was strips of what seemed like either Canadian bacon or SPAM (yes, I shit you not), that tasted like burnt plastic.Sorely disappointed by just about every aspect of this visit.

I then learnt to order one without onion on my next visit. It was filled with sausages, ham, a lot of meat. It was good for the first bite and then i would feel sick of the taste. I struggled to eat half of it and then ask for take-away for the rest of them. Surprisingly, when I heated them up in the oven the next afternoon, they taste awesome. Perhaps it's because it wasn't hot enough when it reached the table. Or maybe they used good ingredients but because there were too many people, they didn't put in as much effort in cooking their usual standard. Service wise, they were courteous and great."

/user_details?userid=U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,Michael U.,"Las Vegas, NV",5 star rating,"For our last stop in Montreal, both in this long-winding post and literally, I couldn't leave the city without trying the poutine and although we'd just eaten a filling breakfast at L'Avenue we made our way to La Banquise - what better than cheese curds, fresh frites, and gravy at 9am...or any time, 24/364?While many in The States may not even be aware of what poutine is, the staple Montreal comfort food has apparently been around since the 1950's and featured prominently on most menus in the city in one way or another ($2 at Burger King, or $23 at APdC) I was told by no less than 5 people that La Banquise was where to get it - in one of no less than 30 varieties.  A seemingly small place from the outside but much larger within I found the restaurant without difficulty and entering the doors was greeted by a small line as the open prep kitchen stood to the right with seating on the left.  Given a few moments to make my selection from a menu on the wall or laminate version for dining in I was greeted in English and after placing the order plus a few minutes preparation time I emerged to the street with a Styrofoam clamshell of Poutine Classique.Clocking in at $6.25 for what seemed to be about 6 pounds of food my first bite of the poutine more or less confirmed my thoughts about what good, classic gravy, fries, and cheese would taste like and while not as upscaled or refined other versions I'd tried in the past the words ""comfort food"" rang through with aplomb.  Rich, starchy, salty, and at times crisp while at others silky the gravy was simple yet perfectly seasoned with plenty savory and a touch of sweet while the cheese curds were presented squeaky fresh yet slightly melted from the heat of the crisp, yet somewhat oily fries.  A food no less comforting than mac n' cheese or spaghetti and meatballs this was one Montreal icon I could definitely embrace and with 30 options I'd gladly return on future visits...perhaps for a ""real"" breakfast, as they serve that (with a side dish of poutine) as well."

We ordered two larges that was enough to share for 3 people. I would recommend getting two dishes that are completely different from each other because they tend to start tasting the same after awhile! You may want to get a coke or some kind of soda to wash down all that fat that you're eating... delicious fat though! We just had water and while it helped, I don't think it did the job.I can't remember which two poutines we had, but I'd say any one of them are good. We got the regular/traditional one and one that had all this meat. The meat one was a bit overbearing because the sausages were huge and very filling. I'd recommend something lighter if you're small like I am and you're sharing just to try it for the first time.Definitely get here early because a line sure does build up quickly! We parked on the streets in the neighborhood ... not sure where else to park!"

/user_details?userid=zR3DaF7rc37xSvI9DbU8fw,Dale P.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,We have been coming to Montreal a few times over the years and have tried a different poutine restaurant each time. I can say that La Banquise is the best hands down. The different types are poutine are a great selection and prices are reasonable. I was thinking at first to get the large size as the regular looked small. I was wrong..it may look small but I was full towards the end. I won't try any other poutine places as this will be our go to place every time we come to Montreal.
/user_details?userid=Pf2lMKHB8Gb5OUxVjMkRTw,Bronwyn A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"So here's the thing, the best part about La Banquise is not the actual resto, but grabbing poutine to go, a couple of beers at the dep next door, and then heading to Parc LaFontaine. I am NO poutine expert, by any means. Everyone (clearly!) has their own (very strong!) feelings about poutine. Mine aren't that strong. But I will say, I found the gravy at La Banquise to be somewhat lacking. It was sort of grease, very similar to what you have at a Saint Hubert. But I've had poutine before in totally nondescript corner diners (like Le Fameux on Saint-Denis/Mont-Royal) where the gravy is actually part of the dish, not just a gel to hold the fries to curds to the fries, gravy with the faintest hint of nutmeg and plenty of pepper, gravy without too much salt, gravy you remember. I've also had crispier fries. Fries that don't sink under the weight of delicious gravy and squeaky melting cheese curds...So, the fact that you can get better poutine in random diners, better than this place that specializes in poutine, is kind of a draw back.HOWEVER, we went here because we had a good friend in town and it is ABSOLUTELY something you should do if you or someone you love is visiting Montreal. It's a thing. You stand in line, you marvel at the menu (what! you can get poutine with guac on top! what!) you wait for your order, you get sassed by the sort of unfriendly staff, you look at other people's plates (whaaa! that girl has a corndog on top of her poutine!) and you look at your own plate (how the heck am I going to eat all of this...?) you feel victoriously stuffed and spend the rest of the week biking around the city and eating salad, and it's just a thing that you have to do.So do it. You may not fall in love with poutine, but it's a lot of fun."

/user_details?userid=M2jbX4QqUtyrPzXmv5StLw,Daniel J.,"South Orange, NJ",4 star rating,Never been here to eat in as the line is always long but I've gotten take-out and it has never disappointed. It's open 24 hours so this is the place to satisfy your late night cravings. One of my favorite poutine places because they pour gravy on the fries and then they flip the to-go container over and pour more gravy on top of the cheese curds and toppings so that you have 360 degrees covering of gravy. The take-out line has not usually been as long as the dine-in line but it CAN turn into a decent wait so depending on the time of day you may have to be a quite patient. Luckily every time I have been here has been around 2 AM so I've only had to wait around 15-20 min. max for my food.

/user_details?userid=DVhrMMjptaGyUYxyNj9gtQ,Kristine S.,"Jersey City, NJ",2 star rating,"Well, I guess poutine is not my thing... at least, Resto La Banquise's take on poutine wasn't. I know there are lots of foreigners and locals alike who love and swear by this restaurant, but I'm just not a fan.My thoughts on the regular poutine: I wasn't a fan of the gravy. I thought it was bland and watery. Combined with the fries, the poutine was very heavy and soggy. I think it would have been better paired with fries that could withstand the gravy so it won't turn out gloppy. I agree with another reviewer: the poutine had some sort of strange sweetness (not sure if this was the combination of the ingredients, or just one ingredient). Portion sizes were massive. We asked the waitress for her recommendation on portion sizes, and she thought that between two people, we'd be able to eat a small poutine (for a meal) and regular sized poutine to share, plus other food. My boyfriend ended up eating his small size, but we barely made a dent in the regular size. For sure, a regular size would be able to be shared with at least three people.I did enjoy my Montreal style hot dog though, a ""steamie"" on a buttered and toasted hot dog roll.The line was pretty long to get seated but it moved. Around dinner time, we managed to stay in line for about 30 minutes. We opted to sit outside in the patio, where we were serenaded by some early 2000's pop and hip-hop music! Totally geared towards the younger crowd. For foreigners: they only take local Canadian cards (No Mastercard/Visa), so cash is best.Hopefully my next trip into Montreal I'll find another poutine place to try out."
/user_details?userid=-_2h2cJlBOWAYrfplMU-Cg,Billy K.,"Philadelphia, PA",3 star rating,"3.5 starsNot willing to say it's the best poutine in Montreal but its very good. Many poutine options to pick from but I went with the classic. Two sizes but the regular is big enough for most. Fries are on the greasier side with dark gravy and lot's of big cheese curds.A true poutine connoisseur knows the cheese curds should be at least partially melted if the gravy is hot enough. Unfortunately this was not the case on my visit - the gravy was luke warm at best, and the cheese curds cold.It should be noted that they have a kick ass beer selection - La fin du Monde, Cheval Blanc and multiple selections each from Boreale, Belle Gueule and St. Ambroise.They now ask you to pay your bill before they bring you the food. This is a little odd but I imagine they get their share of drunk folks sneaking out without paying.PS - it's 24 hours - perfect for Montreal since the bars only close at 3am.BK"

It's at least twice as fast, I get to avoid the noisy and overcrowded tables, and the poutines are just as generous.The portions are huuuge. The poutines are very rich with gravy and the portion of cheese and meat on each one is more than worth the price. The fries are nothing spectacular but they were also excellent. I would recommend being a bit adventurous and wander outside the Classic for some of their more exotic offerings since that's what they're known for."

Resto La Banquise is set up somewhat like a fast-casual restaurant: you can order your food to go, or you can sit down in relatively cramped quarters and have your food served to you in a jiffy. I got a combo meal that involved a burger and a classic poutine. I would highly highly recommend not getting anything else but the poutine. The burger buns tasted strongly of popcorn, like artificial butter was slathered onto it, and the burger itself was dry and bland.The poutine, however, was the real star of the show. The fries had a great crisp-to-fluff ratio, and had more crisp since the fries were cut shorter and skinnier than say, Pommes Frites in NYC. I wasn't a fan of the curd cheese, but I think I'm just personally averse to the texture of it. The gravy was quite delicious, though. The entire dish was well-composed of different textures and flavors, and if I ever visited Montreal again, Resto La Banquise will certainly be one of my pitstops."
/user_details?userid=eucOP3DrBLLkTNYGhDcPMw,Chris D.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"So many poutine choices and no matter which one you get (ok I haven't tried them all...) you will be impressed. Under 15$ to get stuffed to the gills with hot cheesy brown sauce goodness. There is quite a long line late at night, dinner time on weekends but I've never waited more than 30 minutes. If you're fortunate enough to be there during the 3 days of Montreal summer then I suggest the take out line, which is much shorter, and crossing the street to Parc Lafontaine.Finally if you have any inclination whatsoever for some heat put tabasco on your poutine. It only adds to the flavour, doesn't subtract.  One of the few 'famous' Montreal restaurants I come back to regularly."

I have never seen so many varieties of poutine, and they are very filling, very tasty and very messy. Also, pretty affordable!My favourites are La Elvis (mmmm mushrooms and beef) and La Taquise (MMMM a huge glob of sour cream and two heaping globs of guacamole). If you're looking for fat, this is the place to find it. Every once in a while, a good helping of grease is good for the soul. The helpings are ample and the hip servers and cooks make it a cool place to go. I loved going on a Friday night, when the music was blasting and the cooks were all singing away at the tops of their lungs, obviously having a really good time doing their jobs. I like positive energy being put into my food. The wait is not long at all for take-out, and even less of a wait if you're eating in-restaurant.

I was told about La Banquise and was so sad that I wouldn't get to go. During my last trip, I searched ""vegan poutine"" and LB came up! You have no idea how excited I was.VEGAN POUTINE: I came expecting the fries to be soggy (Duh, covered in gravy), but for some reason I was still surprised, it feels like the fries were never crispy though. But I know some people LOVE soft fries, so I'm just not one of those people or I wasn't on the day that I went. The vegan gravy is very tasty, I forgot how good gravy can be. I'm not sure if you've ever tried the gravy that comes with some frozen vegan meats, but it's usually pretty watery or just not very gravy like, how I remember meat gravy to be. Most of the time it's just an herby/spicey thick sauce. But the vegan gravy here is so yummy. The vegan cheese is like a lot of other vegan cheeses, which is kind of not that great but what can you do. They also have tabasco sauce which was awesome because I was in the mood for some hot sauce.$9CAD and you get a huge plate of it. I was sad I couldn't finish, but took the other half and gave it to a homeless man I saw later (hopefully, he didn't notice it was vegan! Or hopefully he did and loved it!)THE PLACE: I went on a Saturday at 1:30 so obviously there was a line out the door. But it's useful to note that there are two lines: the one on the right is for dine-in and the one on the left is for take-out. If it weren't raining, I definitely would've gotten mine to-go and ate it in the beautiful Parc La Fontain which is right there. The place is open 24/7 by the way. It feels very diner like inside, which is awesome and perfect for a poutinery, I'd say. They serve a selection of beers here, which seems like a great poutine pairing."

""Its the most quebecois place to go to at 12:00 AM on a Sunday evening in the Plateau DISTRICT. "" This is a real original poutine gourmet cuisine experience. The type of place you overhear modern people talk about, while lining up in some crummy Toronto poutinerie at 2:00 AM.  The ""Classic Poutine"" was excellent. I found the sauce sweeter to previous poutine experiences and the waiter said this was because it's real cooked-down turkey gravy and fresh cheese curds, and fries. The tables were all beat up and the washroom was in a a bit of a state. Overall a good experience but I won't be bringing it up in line as I wait for shitty poutine in Toronto.

It was definitely my first thought but the group I was with was not in the mood to relocate and I'm grateful. Apparently there is always a line so don't walk away! So this one hour looking line actually moved quick, we actually got a table in close to 20 minutes. Not bad, and they give you menus as you wait to you can decide on a meal.... so many choices.I ended up getting a poutine called La Trois Viande, which as the name suggests is a poutine covered in 3 different meat (how could I not?). Ground beef, bacon, and pepperoni!!! I washed it down with a new beer for me called La Block. Both delicious. My group shared a Cesar salad and that was also insanely good.

There is a menu on the wall so you can think about what you want to order while you are in line. There are more than 28 types of poutine to choose from - From la hot dog to la boogaiou to la t rex and much more. With so many options and limited time to choose I decided to settle with the classic poutine.The service was good in terms of taking the order and the actual poutine itself takes around 15-20 minutes to make. Considering there are so many customers 15-20 minutes was okay. As the place was packed with many customers already with no seats left we decided to get takeout.The staff were very hard working, friendly,, constantly making poutine and ensuring the floors were clean. 15-20 minutes later we got our poutine. Portion was huge and looked pretty good at first with lots of cheese curds and gravey.Eating it was a different story though unfortunately :/. I was looking forward to eating the melted stringy cheese curds but when I opened the box the cheese curds were still cold and squeaky. Gravey was somewhat too salty as well and fries did not taste fresh.Not sure if I would come back but maybe it was a one off kind of thingMaybe we just got the wrong batch of fries and cheese curds? :)"

The gravy is tight, the curds are squeaky, and the fries are a touch on the crispy side. The small size is just enough to fill you up for a few hours. The large size is definitely an artery clogger and should only be reserved for comfort food or letting yourself go moments. Add a burger if you're really going to fall off the wagon.

I'd even go as far as to say that the vegetarian gravy is better than their ""normal"" gravy. I've let anyone I've taken there try it (some serious carnivores) and they've all agreed that it's superior in every way.They also recently started offering vegan poutine made with the vegetarian gravy and Daiya vegan cheese. I'm not a fan of Daiya, so I can't tell you if it's any good or not, but the gravy alone is worth the trip.They're open 24 hrs (one of the few places I've found in MTL) but parking there is *terrible*.

But the fries were a little on the sweet side. Not quite sweet potato fries but sort of in between, which I think didnt complement the gravy and other salty toppings. I asked the server if it was a montreal poutine thing but it was apparently only a resto banquise thing. Either way it was strange. I got the ""3 amigos"" poutine which comes with three kinds of hotdogs and they gave a generous portion of all toppings.

My boyfriend and I visited La Banquise in two separate occasions and I have to say my first visit was my favorite. Being a New Yorker we weren't very well versed in French as that was the main language there but no worries everyone was still able to communicate in English and we had no problems having our orders taken. But even now writing this review about two week after our visit I can still taste the poutine and wish I could go back and have some more. My favorite part of my visit was definitely the cheese curds and the fries were doused in just the right amount of gravy. A must visit place if you're planning on visiting montreal! The plus side is that they're open 24/7!

Poutine is fries covered with gravy and sprinkled with cheese curds. It's EXACTLY how you'd expect it to taste =P The ambience of this place is really chill and it seems like a fun place to hangout with buddies (especially if you're drunk). I liked the bright colors and the mismatched décor; appeals to the younger crowd as it seemed like everyone was under 30. On to the food...the fries are really good! Unfortunately, that was the best part. The gravy was very wet and the taste got old fast so we ended up picking only the dry fries after awhile. If you want poutine with meat, I recommend getting the steak NOT the hot dogs. The hot dog was very rubbery and seemed like the cheap of the cheap stuff. They do have some decent beers too.We would not return, but it's only because poutine is not our type of food. This place is doing something right because the locals LOVE it."

Their fries are crispy and delicious and really unlike anything I've had before. Veggies were cooked perfectly and the cheese curds and gravy were like a little slice of heaven. We ordered the regular size poutine and I found the portions to be quite large, but I am certainly not complaining about that since they were able to wrap up whatever you don't finish. Perfect food if you're hungover and very reasonably priced.Staff were very friendly and they all spoke English which was helpful for someone who speaks no French. I was pleased with how attentive the staff were - I never had to wait for water because they were always coming around with pitchers of water to fill us up if we were running low.

We're taking you out for poutine first thing. It's the best."" As a lover of all things food I was excited to try this regional favorite, but nervous it might not meet my expectations.Nick recommended I stick with the poutine classique as the added ingredients on the specials would mask the flavors of the gravy/cheese curd*. I was absolutely ravenous after my 7 hour drive and dove right in. The hype was well deserved. Rich brown gravy complements the fries - slightly crispy on the outside perfectly soft inside -without overwhelming. Warm, chewy cheese curds round out the dish perfectly. All three elements are critical but none dominates. The perfect bite has all three. Hungry as I was, I ate George's leftovers in addition to my regular size order. He had ordered the tre viande (""three meats""). It wasn't bad at all but made me glad I went with the classic for my first time. The ground beef hash was bland and didn't add anything and the bacon flavor was almost completely undetectable. Thankfully the tangy sausage strips (cut to look like fries) stood out and really added to the standard poutine elements without trying to take over. There's other stuff on the menu but I wouldn't come for anything other than the poutine. After a certain time in the evening they make you pay right after your order because they get a lot of drunk dine-and-dashers.  Cash is your best payment option."

I get that fries will get soggy with gravy... but the parts where the gravy didn't cover them... they were ALREADY soggy. The fries should not be already soggy and mushy before adding sauce or gravy. Not the worst poutine I have ever had but will not be going back. Where the food failed the service matched ... it was just as bad. We could not figure out how this place stays in business. I suppose this resto fills a need....Let the tourists and the hipsters enjoy the ""coolness"" factor and pay more than they should for mediocre product and lackluster indifferent service.I'll stick with classic, well made and un- snobby poutine from an old school casse croute, TYVM."

I had, of course, a poutine. And I had, of course, the T-Rex. Why? Why not! It is a mountain of meat on a poutine! While they do not skimp on the meats, they did skimp a little on the cheese curds. Therefore, you might want to ask for some extra cheese curds. But overall, it is amazing. And yes, the pictures posted on Yelp are a true interpretation on how insanely over-the-top their poutines are!But one of the real gems of this place is their breakfast. Just a warning, if you go on the weekend, they don't start serving breakfast until 7 AM (hard for us early birds, and no, I am not 87 years old). Just like their poutine, their breakfast is over-the-top as well as reasonably priced. I had three eggs, three strips of bacon, two sausage links, toast, French toast, homefries and some type of spread that is big here in Quebec (have no idea what it is called), with a coffee and orange juice for only $12 total. And, again, the portions are huge. While everything was great with the breakfast, I recommend the French toast.I highly recommend La Banquise for either breakfast or dinner.

It was very good and even the small portion was enough for 2 people. My girlfriend got the shepherd's pie which I was surprised to see on the menu. It was pretty good albeit missing a couple of the standard veggies. We went in the morning and it was very chill which was nice. The decor is really cool and I can see this place really being a local hangout spot. They also had a bunch of different kinds of poutine as well. It says on Yelp that they take credit card but they actually only take debit card which we didn't know until we got there. Kind of a bummer but not their fault. I can't say whether it was the best poutine in Montreal b/c it was the only one I had but it definitely was very good and a lot of food. We will come back our next trip to Montreal.

I got La Classique, wolfed it down, and then felt very sick for about ten minutes afterward. But that's why you don't wolf down poutine-- I should have known better. Be warned: portions here are large! I agree with the person below who thinks three poutines for four people is just the right amount. We went mid-afternoon on a Sunday and there was a short line, but we were seated quickly and got our food promptly as well. My only complaint was that the place is a bit cramped and after we were finished eating our waitress kept checking back to see if we were all set with the check. It felt rushed!"

Everything else is a gimmick. If you really really feel the need to 'choose your own adventure' go to one of the Poutineville restaurants - I've had much better food and service at their restaurants than here.On top of it all, there's often a big queue to get in to this place, and in case you didn't read the rest of my review; It's just not worth it."

After planning a day of walking around the neighborhood, we made our way over to La Banquise. I had no idea where we were going except for the little map I had in my bag, but I could tell we were in the right spot when I saw a line going three buildings down from the entrance.Is this going to be worth it? Will the line move fast? Neither one of us were particularly hungry so we figured we could afford to wait. Not knowing the tourist:local ratio, it still seemed like it must be a good place to go if the crowd was so big just for dinner. The line moved quickly, and I think we were sitting at our table within 20 minutes of getting there.They tease you by bringing out other peoples' orders first (you know, in the order in which they were taken), so you get to see/smell all the deliciousness before you have your own dish in front of you. Beau ordered the classic, I ordered the vegetarian with peppers and onions. Holy crap. It was heaven on a plate. So yes, the line moved fast, and yes, it was worth the wait. We both could only eat about half of our dishes (both ordered regular size), but were able to grab the leftovers for our hotel fridge.Would definitely recommend!"

We needed a table for nine and I was sure they'll say no, but they accommodated us without any issues. We were there on a pretty hot day, and the place was very warm.

Ground beef, peppers, mushrooms and asked for jalapenos. When i got my order the plate was so hefty. Didn't think a large would be that large considering other things I've seen in Montreal. The flavors were amazing. The gravy was nice and rich and not too salty. The fries held their own and the cheese was above average. The ground beef seasoned just right and there was a great balance of vegetables and just the right amount of jalapenos to make it spicy but not overbearing.So good I ate it in the park next to it in the rain under a tree.

It was raining cats and dogs on Saturday, but my hubs and I biked here anyways and arrive pretty soaked at about 11am. The place was full but we got seated pretty quickly.There were other diner type foods on the menu like sandwiches, but we really only came for the poutine, and judging by what the other tables have ordered, others came for the same thing. We got La Danse and L'Obelix, which was a chicken with bacon and onions poutine and a smoked meat poutine respectively. The  regular size was quite large and definitely more than enough for one. The La Danse poutine came with a lighter gravy than the L'Obelix poutine, we preferred the darker gravy. The poutines came with lots of topping and cheese curds, and was dripping with gravy. The fries had a home fries taste and texture to them. Overall, we like it but wished that the cheese curds were more melted and that the whole dish came out hotter, it was warmish hot and not pipping hot.When we left around noonish, there was a line to the door for seats, so I guess we got lucky and avoided the huge rush. Overall, I would return to try other poutine dishes here, there were lots of options and you can customize your poutine with whatever topping you want.

I realized halfway through and freaked out, stopped, but then realized I should just pull through. An old French man watching all of this unfold pointed straight at me with his index finger I swear he was performing the cruciatus curse.Walking into the restaurant I was still a little bit shaken and wasn't really sure if I could properly enjoy my meal with the thought of that man judging/hexing me for my honest mistake. But most of my apprehension melted away when the three plates of poutine we ordered hit the table. Out of the three types that we picked (the original, one with pepperoni and ham, and one with beef and peppercorn sauce) I definitely preferred the original. The flavors and the textures quite simply worked better here than in the rest. In general, I think the entire experience could have been improved if the fries were hotter and crispier, the gravy had more flavor, and the water had ice in it. The lasting impression was that La Banquise seems like one of those places that started out as an awesome local joint but eventually devolved into an average touristy trap. But I was happy to get some poutine while in Montreal and by the end of the meal I wasn't thinking about that scary old man at all."

Best poutine I've had, ever, never mind Montréal. However, given how crowded it gets, I'd go on the Terrace in the summer or take it to go for the parc across the way. It was my first time so I had the La Classique with vegetalienne sauce. It is the only place I've been to that had a tasty vegetarian option let alone multiple options to try.

The best poutine place in town. Whenever I have a craving for poutine, I come here. I don't bother trying other places anymore because I always end up saying: it's better at La banquise. There are 2 pages of different kinds of poutine but my favorite is the ""La mart"" with bacon hot dogs and mushrooms. The small plate is a good portion and price is good. The only downside is the long line-up and it can get very very loud depending on the crowd. Also, they don't take credit cards but that's pretty much a lot of business that is super busy. Interac and cash only."

Definitely worth trying. I recommend the peppercorn gravy.However, it loses one star from me because of the stressful dining experience. You have to line up for a long time after 6pm, pre-pay for your food later at night (their way to combat dine-and-dash), and, because of the perpetual queue outside, you feel immense pressure to eat quickly and GTFO. Funny thing: legend has it that the restaurant hurts property values in the vicinity because of the intense grease smell that permeates within a two-block radius. Those who work there probably put on weight by just breathing the air near the kitchen.If you want poutine that is almost as good, with a much more relaxed atmosphere and a better drink list, try Poutineville.

That said, this place was so delicious. We had to wait in a line that went out the door, which I assumed was a good sign. It was extremely busy so it felt like the wait staff took a little while to notice we were there, but once noticed, service was friendly and fast as it could be for such a busy time of day. There is a fun vibe to this place--I wanted to take one of the flower painted tables home with me. They had beer, which is never a bad thing, and we immediately received warm tap water (why is all the tap water in Montreal warm?) We ordered the T-rex and the Mexican (I forget what it is in French). Both were delightful. While the toppings were meaty and perfect, I actually found myself saying that a classic poutine would've been enough--it was that good. Portion size was enormous, but I'm not complaining.

Considering that it was a rather busy Saturday night, we were seated almost immediately. I believe they accept cash only. There is a small ATM on-site, located near the door.My friend ordered the ""Three Amigos"", which is a poutine topped with three types of sausages. I chose a Club Sandwich made with turkey meat and opted to upgrade my side of fries to a standard poutine. Although there seems to be a variety of local and microbrewery beers available on the menu, we ordered soft drinks with our meals.Between the background music and the chatty crowd, the atmosphere was a bit loud for our tastes, making it a bit difficult to have a conversation across the table. Some of the decor is a bit kitschy, as we were seated under a pillar with a large artificial branches with a few oranges hanging down. Our waitress looked like a throwback to the 80's -- complete with big hair, bright scarlet red lipstick, overdone makeup, skintight black leggings, short booties and a huge bejewelled Madonna-style cross necklace! Luckily, she seemed to be the only one of the sort; the rest of the wait staff were dressed very casual and normal in style.Our meals arrived relatively quickly; although I had to ask for mayonnaise (which is unusual in Montreal, most places almost always bring some with Club Sandwich orders). I also had to ask for a knife for my mayo, as we were only served with napkins and forks.I am rather picky about my poutine and I was rather disappointed by the ""standard"" one served by La Banquise, as it wasn't exactly to my preferred tastes.There are several sides to poutine lovers -- some absolutely demand the grease-drenched soggy fries, others prefer slightly floppy fries with theirs, and I am one of those that prefer my fries to be somewhat crisper and still have some shape to them.The poutine had somewhat floppy fries and were a bit more greasy than I prefer. The sauce was a touch heavy and almost chunky in texture. At least the cheese curds were fresh, if not overly generous in quantity.My dinner companion was fairly satisfied by his poutine, however he mentioned that what ""made it"" was the variety of sausages that topped it -- otherwise it was a rather standard fare poutine for Montreal.For most people, the ""regular"" portion is more than enough; only order the large is you are *really* hungry or are sharing between two people.Overall, we were slightly disappointed by La Banquise; mostly because we had heard such marvelous things about this place. If you have never experienced poutine, or have not had much variety in types of poutine, I could see how this place would seem heavenly.However, as a long-time Montrealer, it was actually only a little above average -- the only major saving grace was the variety of styles of poutine offered on the menu. The prices were a little on the high side, especially for the more standard poutine styles -- you can get better for less money elsewhere in the city.We're not sure if we would bother returning, as neither of us were particularly impressed by our dining experience."

I thought there was a slight disconnect of flavours between the smoked meat and the poutine... but maybe i was just crazy. I liked eating the two entities in different bites, instead of together. I also tried bites of La Végétarienne (the vegetarian poutine) and I'd have to say the vegetarian version of their gravy tasted legit! Definitely not a place I would come to two days (or multiple times in a week... or multiple times in a month), but not because it isn't good food, but because my body probably wouldn't be able to handle all the poutine-goodness too often."

I'm really having a hard time deciding what I think about Resto La Banquise. On the one hand, I definitively enjoyed my poutine here. On the other hand, I almost always enjoy poutine and its hard to me to think that the poutine here was exceptional. The poutine was above average and I thought the selection was great, but I think they know that they're popular and thus the prices reflect it. in the end, the combination of taste and price has lead me to give this a sound 3 star restaurant. Worth a trip if you really want poutine, but nothing go out of your way for.For the record, i got the classic and the B.O.M. The classic is the standard fries, gravy and cheese curds. The curds were chewy and great. The fries held up to the gravy and didn't get soggy too quickly. And the gravy was tasty but nothing special. The B.O.M has bacon, onions and a spicy lamb sausage. The sauce is sweeter and spicer, or maybe it just picked that up from the sausage...not totally sure. This was definitely my favorite as it was unique and more memorable."

I use to think it was the best vegetarian poutine in Montreal but, after trying many others, it's hard to keep thinking that.Yea, it's pretty darn good but there's something about their sauce that will make you feel sick after eating it. I don't know what it is, maybe it's MSG in the sauce, the overly sweet taste or just the fat levels being so high. For a lack of better words, It really doesn't taste ""clean"". It's a bit like eating Cheetos: it tastes great but you know it's really bad for you and that you'll regret it later. And just like those neon orange munchies-satisfiers you just won't be able to stop shoveling Banquise's poutine down your throat because it really is addicting... like crack.While I'd never associate poutine with ""health food"" - who am I kidding, it is what it is right - there are plenty of options in Montreal for poutine that are much healthier and won't make you suspicious of what ingredients are in the sauce.Anyway......I better stop writing there because the more I write about Banquise's poutine, the more I crave for it. Ugh. I can hear voices in my head, one is clearly drooling while pushing me to go back for more pleasure - and regret - and the other is screaming: ""No! Don't do it! You know it's baaaaaad for you!""And clearly, because I rated Banquise 3 stars and not 2, the former has registered a win... yet again.To enjoy, in very small doses."

I knew that I had to try all of the regional specialties, and with poutine up at the top of the list wanted to make sure that where I tried it was goooooood. Yelp to the rescue (as usual)! The list of places that popped up had Resto La Banquise as number 1, so with that decision made we bookmarked its location and after a loooong day of walking around and exploring, found ourselves standing behind a local family who had come there for dinner as well. It's usually a good sign if a restaurant is already 1/3 full when its on the early side of dinner time, and there are so many locals and local families dining there. We were seated immediately (and by the time we left, a line had formed) and quickly looked through the long list of poutine creations.I had to try the classic as my first taste, but we wanted to try something else and opted for the Kamikaze since SPICY is my middle name. We got regular sized plates, which were still huge! Piled with french fries, topped with cheese curds slathered in gravy (and in the case of the Kamikaze, slices of hot peppers, onions, and merguez sausage), they seemed monstrous in size - and then a guy next to us received his LARGE order o_OBoth were tasty, but we couldn't finish either of them. By the time we were stuffed full, it honestly looked like we had barely touched either of them. I've certainly had better gravy, and the fries themselves were pretty good but not amazing (I wish they had been crispier on the outside given the gooeyness of the gravy). Its a very cute place, VERY family friendly, and clearly popular. Prices aren't terrible - IF you know what you're getting yourself into.

Hopped in a cab and told the cabbie to take me to the best poutine in town. He drove immediately to La Banquise and was he ever right. Maybe im not used to having such a wide selection of poutine in Vancouver but i would move to Montreal if i could eat like this all the time. Got the poutine with hot dog while my friend got the ""healthy"" poutine with chicken and peas. Trust me, dont try to be healthy. Fries and gravy and curds arent evert going to be considered healthy so stop lying to yourself and just indulge in the delciusness that is poutine!! Plenty of seating in the restaurant but a bit of a wait to get your order. I kind of wish i could bottle the gravy and pour it on every meal i eat."

Not the best poutine I've ever had; the curds were really rubbery and the fries were pretty soggy. They don't skimp on portions though so if you're hungry you'll be well taken care of. The table was stick and a bit gross, it was super crowded but service was good. Glad we visited but felt over full after too big a portion (regular size)."

They make it practically any which way you want. A couple hours after landing in MTL, we decided this is where I should have my first poutine experience.  It was about 1pm or so, and there was no horde of people waiting to be seated but we were left waiting at the host area for a good sub 10 minutes while servers walked back and forth, passing by the very obviously waiting US numerous times.  Minus a point for that. We were finally seated, a nice little booth by a window overlooking the outside.  The menu was a bit overwhelming, not necessarily because it was written solely in french (I have a fair aptitude of the language), rather because there were so many options! Now I'm undoubtedly a carnivore, no ifs ands or buts, so I had to get myself a meaty dish of poutine.  We ordered the Poutine Mart (bacon, smoked sausage and mushrooms) and Poutine Italienne (meatsauce).  The dishes are large, even their regular sized plates. And their poutine is oozing with toppings.  The fries were cooked well enough, lacked that bit of crisp that I generally like. The gravy was a  nice rich brown gravy. Fair amount of cheesecurds, but you can never have too much of that anyway. I was disappointed in the lack of bacon, and the fact that they used hotdogs (i think) vs smoked sausage. Overall, not bad, but not what I was expecting.The 2nd dish of poutine with the meatsauce was pretty good. The cheesecurds were melty and the sauce was reminiscent of a filipino meatsauce, with a slight sweetness to it. Prices are moderate, under $10 a plate.Would definitely return to gain some redemption for my first experience, as I'm sure they can pull off something magically and deliciously fattening."
/user_details?userid=hr6tmq1Od89o8LANdFBJlg,Steve K.,"Washington, DC",2 star rating,"The poutine was good, but the service was atrocious. Although the pick-up line seems shorter than the dine-in line, it looks like the kitchen prioritized those dining in. It is easily a 30-45 minute wait for pick up, which is unacceptable for a simple dish like poutine where the main ingredient - fries - is made in bulk. In my opinion, the food isn't good enough to offset the gross mismanagement."

My friends took me here when I used to visit and now that I live here I bring my out-of-town friends when they tell me to give them the real poutine stuff. It's a mouthparty and has vegetarian poutine to boot. Good luck choosing from the tonnes of topping options, they all sound delicious, but I recommend keeping it simple. Cheese + gravy + fries. That's all you really need. The rest is just fluff... tasty fluff, but still.""Keep it simple, stupid"" should be a poutine rule... I just made it a rule.It's 24 hrs and almost always busy here, so there may be a bit of a wait for a table but you can always order take-away if you're impatient. I'd avoid going for that 2AM late night fix on weekends after drinking and dancing... unless you like lining up out the door and in the street waiting to get in, surrounded by drunk young'uns and woo-girls like at that bar you just left because you felt old... no? that's just me? ok, nevermind.I mean, I love poutine, but is it really worth all that? (that was a trick question because it clearly is, since I suffered through it once, whilst gibbled, just to get my hands on some... and lived to tell the tale.)Service is quick and efficient, slightly rushed even if they are really slammed, and the portions are huge at fair prices. I can barely finish their ""small"" serving. The only downside for me is location; it's out of the way unless you live in the Plateau area.Regardless, you should give it a go at least once... especially if you're visiting.

The nice servers at the establishment all spoke French and were very helpful and it had a nice ambiance.  Definitely would recommend."

We got the regular size which is decent sized and I have no idea how so many couples got the large and managed to finish it. (Such as the couple next to us). It perplexes and amazes me. Anyway the poutine was great (as expected) and I especially loved the fresh chunks of cheese curds.

Granted, the place have become somewhat of an institution like Schwartz's and plenty of the bar crowd comes here for a late snack. However, the difference is that I like smoked meat and not so much poutine (It was my first in like 30 years!).The poutine itself (I took the one with pepper sauce) was fine but not spectacular compared to some I had in the ""bois-franc"" region (birth place of poutine) in the 70s.A worthwhile experience but not one I will redo anytime soon."

/user_details?userid=Lb37hatAjI3fgHEh2lMNEw,Josh K.,"Jackson Heights, NY",4 star rating,"Poutine: Great when it is fresh, absolutely disgusting looking and heavy after a 20 minute bike ride back to your house.I came here to top off my 24 hour tour of Montreal before heading back home to NYC on the Amtrak Adirondack (an experience best left untried, in my opinion.) I decided I could not leave Montreal without tasting Poutine. So after getting a bit lost on my Bixi bike I finally ended up at la Banquise at about 10pm on a Sunday night. As expected, it was fairly packed, and I did have to wait about 30 minutes between getting there and actually being able to tuck in to my poutine.I have to say that most poutine places in NYC do not get the cheese curds right. They are usually an afterthought and sometimes they just kind of chuck them in from a prep bowl that sits out all day (I'm looking at you, Pommes Frites in St. Mark's Place). This place does. But you cannot avoid what happens to them if you let them get cold.So, it was AWESOME... until I got full. I decided to burn some calories off by biking back to the hostel but by then the whole thing was a congealed mess. I ended up having to chuck it, having no one else to pawn it off on.Moral of the story. Eat excellent poutine here and make sure you eat it on site. Do not take it to go!!!"

Sure, you can get poutine almost any way you want, but the fries are not out of this world or anything and it's not like putting ingredients on top of a bed of fried potatoes is very difficult to prepare. Considering this place has so many positive reviews, I expected it to be pretty good, though was not even as tasty as poutine you get at a chain like Frite Alors!Not to mention, once you load poutine up with all manner of things, is it really poutine anymore? I guess like pizza purists, who say only the Margherita is a true pizza, I think I have to agree that poutine is only poutine when it's classic - with gravy and cheese alone. Anything else is just poutine with crap on top.I probably would never have gone here if it were not for the people who wanted to go there, and I definitely won't be back. I would give this place a lower rating if it weren't for the fact that you can get vegetarian classic style poutine.Aside from the food which was only meh, it's super crowded in here!

/user_details?userid=CJmtS1Uk1KSsY2MWol_E7g,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"After a hearty late evening of drinking at Le Lab, my friends and I wandered over to La Banquise, which we had walked by earlier and had known was where there was some good poutine being served. Even at 3 AM, there was a pretty solid line out the door to get in - which gives you an idea of how much the inhabitants of Montreal either like their poutine or like La Banquise. We were probably in line for around 20-25 minutes before we got seated, but after that, it's very much a speedy journey until you get your poutine, as the servers are running around frenetically trying to serve and move people out as quickly as they can. You pay for your bill before the food arrives (in case you should be too inebriated to remember to pay), and the food comes out quickly - which, for this kind of joint, you can't ask really any more of.As for the poutine itself, I've only had it once before in Toronto, but this was definitely better stuff. You really can choose from a whole bunch of different kinds; in the end, we got one of the vegetarian ones (I believe it was the with guacamole and sour cream), as two with meat (La Jaco and one of the others with spicy sausage in it). The meat ones were really all about the savory greasiness of meat mixed in with french fries and cheese curd, which adds an interesting texture (if a taste that I'm not terribly good at recalling) to the dish. La Jaco really does a good job with the mushroom goodness, which adds a nice distinct flavor and depth to the greasy sauce that you'll be dipping your bites in. I really liked the vegetarian one, though - it's extremely fatty, but I don't think there's another occasion I'd take to eat sour cream. It pretty much tastes like a taco without the meat, but it's really hearty nonetheless.You can pretty much show up here anytime, as I think it's a 24-hour restaurant, but if you walk by in the evening, you'll definitely see how popular it is. Don't expect incredible service or even necessarily great quarters (we sat at a table that fit 4 but ended up having all 6 of us), but you're here to get your grub on. Probably a must-see if you're insistent on trying some truly local cuisine...and you can take out if you really don't feel like waiting."

First thing when u enter this place the awful smell of fresh hits u so hard, it wud have been good if we made a U turn from there but we also waned to be adventurous on our first trip first say out in Montreal, so we headed back into their so called outdoor space with all plastic maple trees n plastic plants n flowers which was the 2nd blow. But again decided to be patient n ordered one of their dish from their extraordinaries La Folie n to our disbelief it was one of the most disgusting thing we had eaten. Greasy as hell, well we should have known it.... Potato fries/ French fries topped with some sauce, corn, cheese, sour cream, sausage, onion n peppers..... Who eats lumpu, limpy, soggy fries.....well u get the picture right. I know it's a local favorite, but sorry it does not appeal to many people n travelers to Montreal please be aware n don't fall into the Poutine trap, if u want to try, go on a full stomach, so u don't end up eating this bad food. If you are someone like us try just for the heck of it but don't even think of finishing it, cause am sure you won't. There are many foods to try when in Montreal, so it's ok to give this a skip.

I think what really sets this restaurant apart to try poutine is the HUGE VARIETY of different toppings that you can add on top of the gravy and cheese.  That in itself makes their poutine much better, and almost a basic medium to have any number of other ingredients.  We ordered 3 plates:-Traditional-T-Rex-PizzaSince I'm not a fan of poutine, traditional sucked for me.  The extra meat they throw on top of the T-Rex made it much more palatable.  And I have to admit the Pizza Poutine tasted a lot like a pizza... go figure!Then we saw the couple next to us order a TURKEY N PEAS plate, and a Taco plate.  BOTH looked MUCH better than all 3 of ours.  We decided to get the Turkey and Peas.  Its easy to miss on the menu, but BY FAR my most favorite one.  It really wasnt the soggy fries and gravy I was tasting anymore, it was the turkey with gravy.  So no wonder why its such a great combination.Service was really slow here.  I can blame it on the language barrier too, but they just didnt seem that friendly to us.  And the line was long for dinner time.  So be warned to try to come early.  However, they are open 24 hours, and I suppose for locals, this must be a great spot to go for Late Night cravings."

I did enjoy lying to myself that the vegetables made the poutine a healthier dish. Still, it was very enjoyable, but frankly, I still prefer carne asada fries. I rather have the yellow shoe string fries and cheddar cheese.My family also ordered an omelette Merguez (Merguez sausages, mushrooms, and onions with green salad and wheat toast) and  BLT sandwich on wheat bread with salad. The omelette was very good while the BLT was pretty average.The cups for water were pretty small, but they give you an entire pitcher, so you don't have to keep asking for refills.All in all, the price was great for the portions I received.

On my recent trip to Montreal, I made this my first spot to visit.  What a disappointment it was!Service here is terrible, and it absolutely ruined our experience. My boyfriend I had just finished driving from Boston to Montreal and were starving. We didn't have time to exchange our money to Canadian, but we figured the place would take credit cards since it's such a tourist favorite. The minute we ordered the waitress came back with the bill. We didn't make much of it, but she kept coming back and pestering us about the bill. So we decided to pay, but we hadn't even received our food yet. I gave her my credit card, but she wouldn't take it because she said the restaurant does not take American credit cards. We explained to her that we had a Visa and everyone takes Visas. She then changed her story and said that the machine that takes credit cards was down so that's why they couldn't take cards. It was cash only, but we told her we didn't have any only american, which she eagerly said she would take. I didn't to do that, but we were starving so we gave her the money. I understand since it's busy and she wanted to get paid that she didn't have time to convert the correct change. But we definitely did not receive the correct change, and she took much more than was on the bill. We figured we didn't need to leave a tip because she had already taken most of it and more.When we finally received our food, I was so disappointed, not at all what I remembered. The food was terrible. I had the T-Rex and it was just lukewarm. We left a little defeated, and then the waitress ran after us telling us that tip is not included. We tried to explain to her that she took more money when she gave us the change in Canadian, but she didn't understand or wanted to take more of our money. When my boyfriend asked if we could speak to a manager she quickly declined and let us go. Overall the entire interaction with her was incredibly sketchy and I do believe we were taken advantage of because we were tourists. Later during our trip we talked to a lot of locals who said that this is not the place to go for poutine, I would try other places if I were you."

The best time to come is for dinner or late evening so that what we did. We headed here around 8:30PM and didn't have to wait long to get a booth.The place was playing some French hip hop tunes which was pretty cool to listen to. We got our waters and menus and here's what was ordered:-Large size poutine - 3 Amigos ($12.40 CAD): smoked sausage, pork and beef sausage and Merguez sausage was the addition to the standard gravy, cheese curd and french fry dish. It was okay...I couldn't really find the 3 different sausages...only found 2. The sausages tasted like hot dogs and I found the addition of 3 meats a bit too salty for me.-Regular size poutine Classique ($5.80 CAD): the standard poutine dish. I enjoyed this more than the 3 Amigos. The simpler the better! I didn't know  what to expect with cheese curds, but I thoroughly enjoyed them and am now wondering...what exactly are cheese curds?-Cider Mystique ($6.25 CAD): I asked the waitress if this was a fruity cider and when she simply said ""apple cider,"" I knew I wanted it, even though it was more expensive than their beers. Light and fruity...it was tasty, but I still enjoy Lambic!The portions are adequate. We had 3 people and were able to finish both plates of food. The regular size is a good portion for one person. If you have a group of people, the larger size is probably better. Don't forget, it's basically a dish of fries so you will get full fast...especially if you're downing a cold beer!They do serve other items than just poutine and the place is open 24hrs so it's a great place for some comfort, filling food. Apparently, after 9PM you're required to pay the bill before eating vs. paying the bill after you've eaten.This is a great place for groups and when you just want to relax and kick it with some friends.

I mean, I would have no issue with the price point if it was as spectacular as people say it would be. I ordered the ""pepper sauce"" with spicy sausage and banana peppers.i know right?....sounds delicious on paper for sure but the recommended pepper sauce had peppercorns that were not properly crushed, the cheese curds were massive clumps sitting right in the center away from the sauce, so it didnt even melt properly, and the amount of banana peppers exceeded the amount of fries. I mean I'm sure the recipie isn't hot peppers, cheese curds, gravy and a sprinkle of potatoes now is it? To be honest, I've never written a bad review because I can literally enjoy anything, especially being east indian, my stomach can handle the spice.  However the drive back to Toronto was filled with acidity and indigestion.  More over, when I asked to take it out in a box, I was handed my package, then asked for it back because the guy in the kitchen ""forgot"" to do something. After handing it back to him, he drops the box, takes it back in the kitchen, does what he needs to and hands it back over to me. After getting in my car and driving off, I start feeling the paper bag leak on my lap! So basically the guy didnt even have the decency to give me a new box after dropping it. I know I should have double checked but hey I thought it is common sense to do that for a customer especially when you slam the box on the floor in front of them! Guess I have high r expectations..... oh and I forgot to mention, the guy went to add extra hot peppers! The only couple good thing I can say about it were the actual fries, but if you go wrong deep frying potatoes,  then there is a problem. The ambiance was also nice and the poutine orders looked delicious from a distance."

I visited once in the beginning and just before leaving, and both times were excellent. I have heard that everyone has a different opinion of the best poutine, but I think that is because there are different aspects of the poutine experience to like.I would say La Banquise excels in variety. Their menu is extensive - I tried the 3 Amigos and La Kamikaze. Both were awesome. The service was quick and the servers were polite. The location is right by Parc du Fontaine, which is nice to chill at after such a filling meal."

/user_details?userid=3FDhMd2logLHCJajVLF-9g,Rocco A.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"We were told that this is the best place for Poutine in Montreal. We were not let down at all.First Impression: Visiting Montreal in December we waited in the cold at 6pm for about 40 minutes to wait to be seated. Once we were able to get in and get a table I felt like I was at a 50's American diner. The kitchen is in plain view and the cook staff can be seen dancing and grooving to the music that was pumping through out the establishment. The waitresses are young and mostly pleasant. Service: Waitress are busy with the high demand and constant line of this 24 hour shop but I do give them credit as they seem pleasant and attentive. They greeted the table quickly and food came out with in 20 minutes of ordering.Food/ Poutine: I was not coming here for the burgers or anything else on the menu (though their menu is diverse and I saw a burger being served to another table that looked delicious), I was coming here for the poutine and ordered mine with the crispy chicken on top of the standard gravy and cheese curds. I ordered a regular which is more than enough for one person to make a meal out of that serving. The large looked enormous. Everything about it was delicious, the fries were not soggy and the heat of the gravy and now melted cheese curds created the perfect combination. DO NOT take it to go, eat it hot and ready as that is when it is best.  Overall the gravy is the best part of the meal and I was finding my self dipping my chicken in the gravy. The Gravy is very rich and heavy!Pros: Delicious Poutine, Fun Atmosphere, Friendly Staff, Adequately pricedCons: Long line, crowded waiting areaOverall: I would come here again. Easily a three star rating. The 4th star was giving mainly because of the quality of the food."

/user_details?userid=JKQmuH6PKCDXpeZYK3BmnQ,Mister O.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Had wanted to try this place for quite a while, so when a rush trip to the Ulysse travel bookstore found me at the corner of Rachel and St-Denis at suppertime yesterday with all my chores done, I decided that supper was going to be poutine.Showing up at 1730 hrs on a Saturday, I was thinking that Montrealers don't eat this early and I'd have no problem getting a seat.  Well, I was wrong.  There was already a short line inside the door, and the place was heaving- with children.  Seems that parents of  pre-schoolers *do* eat this early, and they bring their spawn in great number.  Managed to be seated immediately, though, by dint of only needing a table for one.  Got the second last seat in the house, as it turned out, in a dark corner.  Water glass (already filled) and menu hit the table as I was seated, a nice touch.Despite my being in a wretchedly difficult place to reach, the waitress was quick to worm her way to me and take my order.  Asked for a regular-sized classic poutine, a Banquise burger with Dijon instead of the usual orange sauce, and a St-Ambroise.  Did not have to wait long for it all to arrive;  just long enough to notice the extremely repetitive dance-techno music being played just a little too loud over the already considerable din in the room.  It was pounding out a deeply tribal message, and that message was ""please chew quickly and get out, so we can sell some more of this stuff"".  Just a little too obvious a musical psy-op, for what's basically a hip diner.  Dinged them a star while I waited for my oats.The food and beer all arrived at once, exactly as ordered.  Poutine portion was definitely generous;  my plate was heaped, and almost overflowing.   Burger was a proper size for the price, and well-garnished.  Both tasted fine, while neither being spectacular.  Both, unfortunately, were only warm, and not hot.  Given how quickly they arrived, this was disappointing.  Fries fresh from the fryer and sauce kept on a proper simmer, especially, should have been screaming hot, at least at the very core of the mound.  But the wait at the kitchen push-through and the trip to my table somehow managed to suck the bulk of the heat out of my supper.  My cheese curds were barely melted.  Another star lost, right there.Restrooms (I tried two) both had trash on the floor, and both had the slipperiest, soapiest floors I've ever put boots on.  The cracks in one bowl's rim must be from someone's teeth.With all that said, this place isn't without definite merit.  Both the placière and my waitress were alert, memorably courteous and pleasant in the middle of an obvious rush, and good at their jobs.  And the food is taken seriously, ingredient-wise. It tasted fine, after all.   The people-watching was excellent, too, at least while I was there;  it seemed like I was surrounded by groups of good-looking twenty- and thirty-something brunettes, all animatedly catching up on old times and planning new adventures while gleefully pounding pure cholesterol into their smiling faces. The table of sleekly black-haired girls next to me was speaking entirely in an oddly-tinted Spanish.  My idle moments between mouthfuls weren't exactly devoid of wallpaper.But the not-hot burger and poutine, the roomful of rather loud children, and the 1980s behavioral science music selection... Yes, I'd eat here again, but not without a deliberate motive.  Oh... When I left, the line was out the door.  Be forewarned.Anyhow.  Banquise:  Been there, done that."

This dish was amazing and I was regretful that we ordered the regular size and not the grande. The La Banquise beer was very tasty as well.

/user_details?userid=JbgLgoy754EeQrWoQBLX1Q,Jenna M.,"Melbourne, Australia",3 star rating,"Seriously people, we all know that Montreal is known for three things: bagels, smoked meat and poutine. Maybe it's also known for its French culture, but that's besides the point. We are talking about food here! People used to tell me, ""Look, you don't know what poutine tastes like until you try it in Montreal."" My retort was, ""Where's Montreal, and what the schnitzel is poutine?"" I admit, this was many many moons ago. Since then, I have not only eaten poutine many times (I did go to university after all), but I've also had it in one of Montreal's most famous poutine eateries - La Banquise. On to the bigger question. Does this place live up to its applause? Well, it does and it doesn't. Let's be honest here, ANYTHING tastes good at 2am when you've just had ten drinks. But, in all honesty, the poutine here is a good time. The line out the door, however, is another story. The menu is loooong and all the types of poutine have names like T-Rex, Elvis, and Frank. I usually get the classic poutine (boring, I know) and leave the bacon, green peppers and beef to other meals that I eat. La Banquise also offers up breakfast, but I'm not sure if anyone ever orders it unless it's to ask for eggs benny on a poutine.So, will I return to this famous Montreal house of poutine? Probably. I just need to get a buzz on and eventually convince them to name a poutine after me."

Great atmosphere.I enjoyed a Cidre Mystique while I eagerly awaited my poutine. I ordered La Taquise. A Mexican poutine? What?On a small plate that held so much more than what you'd think, comes my poutine. Covered in dollops of guacamole, sour cream, and diced tomatoes, it's a ""Frenchcanexican"" treat. Dipping the oil-brown 'frites' in the sour cream proved to be my favourite bit. The Cidre Mystique paired surprisingly well with it, followed by a quick swig of water.I'm a mechanical, gastro-adventurer, so I eat in a certain process in order to satisfy my taste buds the most. So as follows: poutine, cider, water, repeat! Your dish will warm you, your cider will excite you, and your water will cleanse you for another go.They've got a great selection of music here, too. At one point, you hear Johnny Cash, then Daft Punk, then hardcore rap? I don't know how they made it all work, but they really did!Not even half of my regular sized portion is gone and I'm already full, so I don't suggest getting a large unless you're sharing with a friend. They've got two large columns of different poutine that you can choose from. Additional sauces are available if they don't originally come with your choice of poutine.If you're foreign and eating here, don't make the same mistake I did; La Banquise does not accept credit, nor foreign debit. If you have Canadian debit, you're fine. I ended up having to come up with the idea of giving the waitress my driver's license as a sort of promise that I'd be back in a jiff after going to an ATM to withdrawl Canadian dollars (they accept USD, but I preferred CAD). Banque Laurentienne has ATMs that will accept any card, withdraw CAD, and they only charge 2$ as with any ATM. The waitress was very understanding and didn't make me feel like a bumbling fool.La Banquise is a very nice place to go if you're wanting to take a little time to yourself in the afternoon and indulge in wonderful, cheese-curd-covered goodness."

This place is open real late, so if you're looking for a place to clog up your arteries after bars close, then this is the perfect place to go.They only take cash, but no worries, there's an ATM Machine if you don't have any. If you don't have debit though, well, you're pretty screwed. The service is fast, the place is big and clean, and I've never met an unfriendly waitress there. My favorite is the Poutine Frank, which is a poutine with Merguez sausages, but the Poutine Dan Dan (pepperoni, onions, bacon) and the Poutine T-Rex (bacon, pepperoni, ground beef, sausages) are also awesome.If you're visiting Montreal, make sure you check this place out; and if you live there and haven't experienced this place yet- well then, maybe you ought to consider not calling yourself a Montrealer anymore."

The one with the merguez is probably the best, although if it's your first poutine, just go classic. Service is good, prices are on the high end but not insane, and they have a good selection of local beer to boot.

We are lovers of food and really wanted to go somewhere that had a distinct food culture. We found a food mecca in Montreal. One of the items on our list of must-eats was poutine, a native dish to Quebec. To us, it just sounded like something we needed to get our hands on!We tried poutine for the first time at this little diner for a late dinner. We were less than impressed. After doing our due diligence and scouring the web, we came across La Banquise. So on a gorgeous day, we took the metro out to a quaint little neighborhood and walked a few blocks to La Banquise. This was definitely your typical dive, metal tables, benches and random art work and mismatched pieces as décor. The place was packed on a late afternoon, but we were seated relatively quickly. I can see how this place is such a draw, especially for a late night crowd, and with the bonus of it being open 24 hours.We ordered a large poutine to share, and had it topped with hot dog, bacon and mushrooms. Yes, you can add additional toppings to your poutine. What came out was a gigantic plate filled to the brim and loaded with fries, gravy, hot dog slices, bacon, mushrooms and cheese curds! It may not look like the most appetizing plate, but it was divine! The cheese curds were melting and provided an even more decadent touch to the dish. The fries soaked up the gravy and the bacon and hot dogs gave each bite the needed amount of sodium; it was very savory. It was real treat, and worth my cholesterol shooting up a few points!"

Resto La Banquise was at the top of my ""best poutine in Montreal"" searches, so I was a little worried that it was simply an institution and was rated accordingly. We went on a Friday afternoon just after the lunch rush and were seated immediately. The server and hostess were very friendly and graciously communicated in our mixture of English and French. Another women (perhaps a manager), also checked on us once and made sure everything was good, so five stars for the service.We tried two of the regular sized poutine plates and had two Quebec beers. The ""La Bacon"" was rich and hearty with a generous portion of bacon. The ""Poivree"" was also excellent. We stuck with the traditional cheese curds on both. The amount of sauce on each was inconsistent (much less on the pepper than the bacon), but that was OK and gave us a chance to decide how much sauce we liked. The fries were crispy and well done.The IPA and the Hefeweizen were fairly bland, but were nice with the poutine.Since this was my first poutine experience, I don't really have a great frame of reference; Resto didn't overwhelm me with flavor, but it was a lively atmosphere, great service, and tasty food."

There was a line when we arrived, and we waited a little longer than usual because we had a large-ish group of 6, but we were seated within 20 minutes and eating shortly after that.

The T-Rex is quite popular, although I've never had it, which is loaded with a variety of meat.

/user_details?userid=hR6dUJqimBHwIKssts6VOQ,Lillian C.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"I made a quick trip to Montreal over the weekend, so to get my fill I tried two different within the span of 30 hours. My trip to La Banquise was my second poutine trip, and last meal in Montreal. First of all, it's cash only so if you're not into carrying a lot of money around when you're visiting another country, there's an ATM at the front. I ordered the ""La Taquise"" with ground beef added and the vegan boyfriend had the vegetarian poutine with peppers and olives. For a regular, you get a heaping mound of golden brown french fries covered in gravy, cheese curds, massive amounts of guac and sour cream (and the bits of beef I added) so there's no need to order anything else. What I should have realized that the cold guac and sour cream would not help your curds melt so for the curds were solid. From what I understand, the best part of poutine is the gooey ooey cheese curds and my previous (classic) poutine was a melty masterpiece. So, I have to admit- the cheese was underwhelming in La Taquise because it's a mild cheese, and they stayed solid so if I had to do it again, I would have gone for the poutine with the hot dog bits. From what I understand, poutine is Canada's equivalent of chili cheese fries so don't worry if you think having poutine with hot dogs is ""trashy"". The vegan equivalent sans cheese curds has a brown gravy that tastes like marmite- it was pretty delicious, but of course on the salty side. The fries were not a win with the boyfriend though because he thought they were greasy. So if you're not a fan of thick cut, soft greasy fries you might not like poutine. I personally love soft fries! I don't really eat fries at home because I don't like the cardboardy crispy yellow sticks prevalent here (With the atrocious cornstarch batter to keep them crisp. )"
/user_details?userid=S0wtyMwO-7-zzTO8EISvRw,Di F.,"Harrisburg, PA",3 star rating,"Of course, when you're in Canada, you must stuff yourself with some artery-cloggingly good poutine. My bf and I decided to share a small plate of poutine cause we had planned an itinerary around food and didn't want to ruin our appetite for other stuff with too much poutine. We ordered La Matty, which was poutine topped with ""bacon, poivrons, champignons, et oignons"" (bacon, peppers, mushrooms, and onions). My bf had had poutine before; I hadn't. He said it was great poutine so I'll have to trust him on that. I just thought it was great heart-attack food in general! My only two complaints are that the fries were a bit too soggy and there wasn't enough bacon. I was expecting crunchier fries; even though they're being doused in gravy, it doesn't mean the fries need to be wilted. Then again, this could be the way Canadians like their fries. Coming from the States, I like my fries with some integrity of crisp. I was also hoping the gravy would have more of a kick; Instead, it was a bit watered down and unflavorful. But, again, maybe I'm just used to American gravy, which can sometimes be overseasoned. Overall, it was still a good plate of poutine.My bf also ordered a shepherd's pie and two beers: First, the house special, La Banquise, which was too light for his tastes (so I took it instead), and then a L'Ecossaise, a reddish brown beer with hints of caramel and toffee which sat well with him. The shepherd's pie was only ok, nothing exceptional.Food: 3.5/5 -- good, though I wish the fries were crispier, the gravy more seasoned, and the bacon more plentiful (then again, these may just be US preferences)Service: 4/5 -- great! welcoming, friendly, attentiveAtmosphere: 3/5 -- clean, open, brightly-colored space, though a bit noisyOverall: 3/5 -- good"

You can't go wrong with the combination of fries, cheese curds, and gravy. I've been to Montreal three times without trying this local staple. I made it a priority on the fourth and most recent trip, but it was not without difficulty. The adventure began at Rôtisserie Chalet Bar-B-Q, which we were told had both amazing chicken and poutine. After we sat down, the waitress informed us that they didn't serve poutine and never did. But, she did recommend a diner two doors down that did serve it. Befuddled and a bit embarrassed, we walked over next door. The diner was mostly empty and I didn't have a good feeling about the food there. Fortunately, they carried free wi-fi, which I used to find the most popular place for poutine in Montreal, Resto La Banquise. We promptly made a quick escape when the owner just so happened to take a bathroom break. Two consecutive walk outs were uncomfortable, but that was not going to stand in our way of trying authentic Montreal poutine.Four miles later, we found ourselves in Resto La Banquise, a 24 hour diner that is dedicated to serving a variety of poutine toppings in addition to breakfast and sandwiches. When we stepped in, I knew we were in the right place. Left and right, there were plates of poutine on every table. Out of the 28 varieties of poutine, we picked 3 to try: the Rachel, T-Rex, and the Classique. It was prepared very quickly and our plates arrived in a few minutes. My favorite was the Classique because you can really taste each individual component: the sweetness of the fries (Canadian fries are sweet for some reason), the savory gravy, and the mild flavor of the cheese curds. The Rachel had green peppers, mushrooms, and onions, which was flavorful, but overwhelmed the cheese and gravy. The T-Rex is just a mess of meat, which included ground beef, pepperoni, bacon and hot dog sausage. It was salty and my least favorite of the three. I can see why this local fast food dish is so popular. After a day (or night) out in the city, a big plate of poutine is sure to cure any craving. Our love of fatty comfort foods is sure to add a few notches onto our belts, but in this case, I will gladly go up a size to indulge my stomach."

We queued for 30 mins on a cold Sunday afternoon (you always queue apparently) but seating was democratic and well-managed. They do 20 plus types of poutine, and most are a riff on the original, plus add-ons. I had a Savoyarde with bacon, onions, emmenthal and creme fraiche, my wife decorated hers with merguez, and another companion had a less successful iteration bedecked with breaded chicken bits. Portions are generous, they split the bill per diner in advance (student tourists must be a significant client base), and it's cheerful. You can't pay with foreign cards so bring cash."

None of that New York Fries quickie from a food court. It has to be something I would feel dirty just thinking about. Something that could match a 10 piece Church's Chicken late night! La Banquise Resto 24h is open 24/7 - yes, even at those ungodly hours when your drunk or crave a heart attack! In the heart of Plateau District, a little off from the Latin Quarter.

I like this apricot wheat ale a lot in addition to the Belgium Fruli (Strawberry beer). Boreale beer - named after Aurora Borealis. The label features a polar bear above the word Boreale. I found it rather bitter. More so than Asahi Black. The restaurant itself may not be the prettiest, but the staff are friendly. You can expect a fast turnover even though there may be a wait. I wish I tried a few more poutine places so I can compare. But we were pretty satisfied. There is no reason to discount this place just because it is busy.

My only word of advise when taking an order to go, is to double check your order before you leave. I certainly will be doing it whenever I take my food to go. I've had at least 3 orders prepared incorrectly over the last couple of months and there's nothing worst when you take an hour of your time to pick up an order only to find out they did not prepare it correctly. Just recently placed an order with extra cheese and extra sauce only to find it was prepared without cheese and sauce. Really! No one found it strange preparing a poutine without cheese and sauce! Maybe a bit more concentration from the cooks and a little less talking and singing.  Nothing worst then when you're looking forward to a plate of great poutine only to find out there was some disconnect between the order being placed and being prepared.

After a long day of (literally) walking up and down Mont Royal, we decided to stop in for a quick bite. In my head I knew what I wanted, but of course I had to take an eternity browsing the menu. The poutine section alone covers an entire page! But I settled, and patiently awaited my poutine--the BOM. Being from the states, more importantly the south, I'm no stranger to dishes piled high with meat and cheese. But this was like nothing I'd ever tasted before. Well, it was my 2nd poutine of the week, however the first was not even able to compare to this masterpiece. I washed it all down with a local beer, which was so good I wish I could get it back home.

Sure, people try to imitate you all across Canada and in small pockets of the United States but nothing beats a poutine in your home province. There are, of course, fierce debates as to which establishment has the best poutine in La Belle Province and La Banquise always pops up as one of those places that has some of the best poutine in Québec.I love La Banquise because it serves up some high quality poutine* at all hours of the night. The curds are pretty good and their many poutine combinations/types seem to work pretty well. You can have a classic poutine if you'd like or you can be adventurous and try poutines such as the Duleton (minced meat and onions), poutine galvaude (basically a Hot Chicken sandwich in the form of poutine) or the B.O.M. (bacon, onions and Merguez sausage... sort of like a heart attack waiting to happen). It's definitely not fine dining but after a night of drinking with friends, I don't think fancy food is what one craves.Last but not least, La Banquise is so cool that Omnikrom (and TTC) feature it heavily in the excellent ""Danse la poutine"".* - Just because we're in Québec doesn't mean that there isn't any poor and disgusting poutine, either."

Anyway, les gens du coin all said this was the spot to pop your poutine cherry, with its extremely long list of poutine plats and 24-hour 'round the clock service. So we plunked down around midnight and ordered a monstrosity... I believe it was called the T-Rex? A heaping plate of cheese curds & fries, doused in a deluge of gravy and in this case, topped with a couple animals' worth of meaty bits. To be honest, the meaty bits were pretty gross. I LOVED the cheese curds, and the fries with gravy were...well, fries with gravy. Tasty, but you never feel good about eating such nonsense. In retrospect, I would've been -much- happier with the ""Classique"", sans meat. I'm going to give this place 4 stars because I imagine if you LIKE poutine, or you're a first-timer like I was, you can't get better dished up 'round the clock in Montreal than at La Banquise, nor can you get more varieties. However, it misses a 5 star review because it has just about the nastiest bathroom I have ever encountered, anywhere. Truly, it was awful.

The portions are huge and they have so many variations of poutine that my friends and I all had trouble deciding what to get. We each got our own regular sized poutine and a large original poutine just to try.We tried the Matty, Elvis, T-Rex, and the Mexicaine. All of them had the gravy sauce and the cheese curds which were chewy and delicious. The Matty and Elvis were pretty similiar except one had bacon and the other beef. In my opinion the T-Rex was a meat feast which was too much for me, but if you're a meat lover this is the one to order. If I were to go back I would order the Mexicaine with the tomatoes, guac, and sour cream, just because its refreshing to eat fresh vegetables on such a heavy dish. My only negative point is that they didnt put enough vegetables in their poutine (such as bell pepper or tomatoes in their respective dish).

For the adventurous eater la Banquise offers 25 variations with a slew of toppings, from Bolognese sauce to bacon, peppers and mushrooms.The place has a wonderful neighborhood feel to it and due to its local fame attracts droves of Montréalers, a quick glance around and you see teenagers on dates, truck drivers on break from miles on the road, and families enjoying a warm plate on a cold Montreal night. The staff is friendly, the prices affordable, and the portions are intense.The potato may have originated in the Andes, but it fits in just fine in Quebec. If you ever find yourself in Montreal la Banquise offers a wonderful taste of French Canada."

/user_details?userid=cL5jML80rWAyzC1z_v4HWw,Clarence W.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Ah, the famous La Banquise. Home to Montreal's strangely beloved and most overrated poutine. I've tried different varieties of their poutine many times and still don't understand the love it gets. Sure, you can get a bunch of toppings, and yes, it never closes...but is that really enough reason to elevate this place to legendary status?Personally, I find that the fries are always overcooked and cheap tasting, the toppings are abundant but of low quality, and the curds are decent at best. And to be honest, almost every time that I've eaten a poutine there, I felt sick afterward. Yet I would always find myself coming back because of its proximity to my house and my sometimes lowered standards from drunkeness. Some of the other items I've had on the menu, such as the hotdogs, hamburgers and club sandwiches have been pretty good though. This combined with the great atmosphere and solid service at La Banquise, raised up my review to 3-stars. The poutine though? Don't believe the hype.

The poutine here is the best! The fries are thick, drenched in hot gravy with a good amount of chewy cheese curds. The breaded chicken was tender with crispy breading,  chopped in little pieces and truly a delicious touch to my poutine. The downfall about this place is that you may suffer through the service.

Don't let yourself be tempted by other menu items-- definitely not worth it-- and go for the Quebequois staple of crisp, freshly-cut fries, brown gravy, and melted cheese curds. La Banquise does it right with about twenty varieties and a solid base to go on. The fries are crisp enough to stand up against the herbacious turkey (or chicken?) gravy and chewy, gooey mild curds. Add on a melange (is that correct French?) of excellent toppings ranging from sour cream to corn dogs. Our suggestion? Try the Poutine Matty with green peppers, onions cooked 'til soft and translucent, sauteed mushrooms, and crisp bits of bacon.This gluttonous eastern Canadian specialty comes in two sizes-- large and larger. Canadian and American. Petit and grande. Take it as you will.Service is friendly and responsive to special requests but doesn't follow up with things like refills on water. The host stand often ends up unattended and there always seems to be a wait... even at two in the afternoon.

If you're claustrophobic or can't stand sitting next to others while you dine, I would recommend getting your poutine to go!After reviewing the menu of over 30 poutines, I settled on Le Matty: onions, peppers, mushrooms, and bacon. My husband got La Savoyarde: bacon, onions, swiss, and sour cream. Our food arrived quickly and was piping hot and fresh. The regular size portion is HUGE, we definitely could have split one. This being my first poutine experience, I thought it was pretty tasty! The fries were hand-cut style and cooked to a dark golden brown. The cheese curds were melted slightly, and the bacon and veggies were grilled. The addition of the sour cream on my husband's went really well with the fries, gravy and cheese! My only complaint: I was a bit under impressed with the gravy as it did not taste homemade. I was glad I got mine with the veggies and bacon because they added some of the flavor that the gravy was missing. I would like to try poutine again with a creamier homemade gravy. Overall, it was a good experience, but don't expect gourmet flavors here! It is what it says: gravy, cheese, fries, and toppings, nothing more or less!

If you like Poutine or want to try Poutine for the first time this is a good option as there are so many varieties plus its open 24hrs. Downside is that it is also super busy and you often have to wait for a table.I've had a couple of different varieties-one with 3 different kinds of meat and one with 2 meats and some green peppers and onions. Both were tasty and filling but like with most experiences with Poutine it can end up being a bit sickening by the end and Poutine is never eaten for its looks usually anyway. It is a fairly reasonably priced meal though at about $10 you get more for the same price if you eat in then if you takeout but I found the takeout serving size was a bit more achievable.  If there is a long wait and the takeout line is short I recommend taking it to eat in Parc Lafontaine and you can watch the duckies.Overall, a nice but somewhat sickening meal but if the line was around the corner I would probably go somewhere else unless its your first poutine experience."

My boyfriend had the t-Rex, which was meat galore-- ground beef, pepperoni, bacon & hot-dog sausage. He loved it. We of course shared a classic poutine, and I got the Reggae-- ground beef, guacamole, diced tomatoes & hot peppers. It was enjoyable, but I liked the classic poutine the best. The gravy was not salty at all, and the cheese curds were quite yummy. I also had the exquisite berries smoothie, which I didn't particularly love. It wasn't as sweet as I anticipated.

La Banquise is arguably the mecca of this classic Quebecois dish and offers variations on it with countless toppings as far as the reasonable mind can think.  It's not uncommon to find lines well outside the door, especially late at night on weekends.  Though the carb/fat heavy nutritional composition of this dish is not what I would personally go for these days, it's an obligatory stop for anyone visiting Montreal - whether you've had poutine before or not.  There simply isn't a place where you'll find poutine of the sophisticated variety that you find at La Banquise."

Last time I was there, I wanted to try their steamie hotdog, but unfortunately their machine was broken. We were there around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon and there was still a 10-minute wait, but the poutine was well worth it. Note that they do not take credit cards.

I had the classic poutine because I figured that was really the only way to see what all the fuss was about. Not gonna lie, it was pretty good!

We both ordered sandwiches and an order of ""classic"" poutine. The sandwiches were huge and all the ingredients were very fresh. We were a bit intimidated by the giant plate of poutine,which we've only had once before Stateside. However, it was delicious in all its gravy goodness.

Luckily, on a recent trip to Montreal, I was able to satisfy that craving like never before. There were three of us, and we each ordered a small poutine (classic, Hawaiian, and 3-meat). That was kind of a mistake, since between the three of us, we finished only one of the MASSIVE plates. I ate until I couldn't eat any more, and kept eating some more. The crispy fries, the beefy gravy, and the squeaky cheese curds made for a perfect combination of gooey, cheesy, salty, and yummy. Although they do have over 20 different variations of poutine, I think the classic is really all you need- at some point, the extra stuff just gets in the way.Sure, it's small and packed with French-speaking college kids, the decor is weird in a pseudo-European way (a fake tree dominates much of the ceiling), you will leave smelling like a fry cook (and, if you are anything like me, with the top button of your jeans undone).

Kitchens were already closed in most places so it seemed to be one of very few places to eat (it's open 24 hours, how convenient--AND dangerous). It's your typical MTL greasy-spoon specializing in poutine, which is something the city does very well. There are about a million poutines to choose from, along with staples like burgers, all-day breakfast, etc. I didn't want to overdo the grease factor as it was quite late and I had my food itinerary set for the next day (what can I say? I'm nerdy like that) for which I wanted to ensure I had room in my stomach, but we ended up each getting a burger (~$5) and the two of us shared a large poutine (~$10). The burgers were standard diner fare--no going wrong there--with the usual toppings and condiments available. For the poutine, I chose the Savoyarde which is a new item that does not appear on their regular menu, and anyway, the original poutine can be had anywhere so I thought we ought to try something new. The very thought of the Savoyarde brought back memories of a recent trip which included stops in France, so it was a must for me. It turned out to be an original poutine topped with their version of Savoyarde toppings which include things like bacon (instead of lardons), sour cream (instead of the cheese and cream combo), and some mushrooms (not a lot). It was good enough, and definitely hit the spot on that cold night.The food (at least from among what we had) would normally elicit about 4* tops but the service and atmosphere (young and hip; definitely a post-bar kinda place) take it one star further. This place, with its menu and clientele, really capture the Montreal vibe. La Banquise is in a French part of town but the friendly servers were able to communicate in English just as well (useful for the many tourists I noticed), and they did so very happily, unlike in some establishments. *ahem* Food is cheap, servings massive, and our order arrived pretty quickly considering the place was PACKED.

I tried both and was slightly disappointed not because of the potato, cheese curds (plentiful) or toppings but the gravy, which tasted like instant bouillon mix.  I am from Toronto area and have easy access to New York Fries. Its gravy taste more like demi-glace.Also, I ordered a V8 expecting a regular 12-oz can (355 ml) but when the waitress sent the 5.5-oz can (162 ml) i was speechless.

There was something in our water, however they replaced it immediately with a fresh pitcher. The menu was quite vast with variations of dressing a poutine.We all got different flavours, such as a the kamikaze, matty, hotdog, pizza etc. The toppings were all fresh and tasty however, the poutine itself as a whole was fairly disappointing. This could be because of the cheese curds, as they were firm and cold and not soft and gooey-(what we're used to and enjoy) The cheese squeaked in our teeth which is apparently what good cheese on poutine is supposed to be like, however it wasn't our cup of tea.

Stopped by with family, recieved good service and relatively no wait to get in (it was a Sunday afternoon, so that helped). The menu is glorious. A variety of toppings will overwhelm you upon first viewing. When you get your order, you will experience that tenfold. They really stack their toppings up. I generally like only a bit of topping, like NY Fries does, but La Banquise smothers their crisp fries with a heaping serving of topping. If you're a fan of decadent poutine, this will be right up your alley. If you're more into a surplus of fries, the rest of the menu besides La Classique might be too rich. Some family members and I ended up ordering our meals to go. We spent the later evening polishing off the mouth-watering remnants. Yes, even their cold fries were good (albeit still too rich)!Since the trip, my sister has been craving their poutine.

We didn't get the impression that our waitress even noticed, and she responded with an excuse about our order being complex (a salad, a regular poutine and a poutine with guacamole and sour cream on top). When we tasted the food our jaws dropped. Wow this was an impressive poutine. Definitely worth the wait. Their gravy is excellent, the guacamole was even above average and the salad was fresh. The only complaint about the food was that the curds weren't melted so there was something wrong with the temp. Perhaps our order sat unnoticed in the kitchen? Who knows.

The service is fast, the portions are more than you'll ever need (definitely big enough to split), and they have a bunch of fun variations on poutine involving everything from smoked meat to peas. The vegetarian poutine was the only disappointing thing. My wife doesn't eat meat, and I know that veggie poutine can be done better than this since we've had it at Potato Champion in Portland. My other complaint is the silly, tiny waiting area, which is a confusing mess if you come for take-out and only slightly less of a mess if you're waiting for a table. The place seems busy at all hours, so they should figure this out. But this is clearly the place to go for the local heart attack delicacy, and I recommend it to anyone visiting Montreal."

So I went to see what all the hype was about and to be honest, the food was not exceptional but was not terrible. It would not be a place I would go to with purpose, but I would fine here if I happen to be in the area. The restaurant is somewhat small and cozy, very little space (in the dining area and bathrooms) if you were there with a large group of people  the restaurant also has somewhat low ceilings as well. It's nice that the restaurant is open 24/7, because it offers convenience for those who want a late snack/meal, those who want to eat after a late night out, or for those who work a night shift and want to eat dinner in the morning hours after the work shift ends. I have to admit, one of the things I disliked is that the music was too loud and I could barely hear what my friends were saying to me, let alone listen to my own thoughts. All in all, this restaurant was not exceptional but was not terrible. It is kind of out-of-the-way for me to dine here, it is unlikely that I would come back."

Poutine is basically a plate of fries mixed with cheese curds, gravy & your choice of toppings.We ordered the Poutine Classique (no meat) & Poutine Dan Dan (bacon) from the menu for about $7 each.

Reading the reviews, I guess the poutine is perfection at Banquise.  Are the fries as crispy as they can be under the heavy gravy?  Yes.  Are the cheese curds ""squeaky"" and chewy?  Yes.  Is the gravy beefy and greasy?  Yes.  Does the selection include bizarre additions (pineapple and ham, hot dogs and mushrooms, etc)?  Yes.  Will all these ingredients reform in your stomach like an enormous brick?  Definitely.  Will your friend from DC complain from belly pains all night long?  Perhaps.Maybe if you grew up on poutine, this stuff hits the spot.  Maybe if you were drinking all night and need a greasy meal, this is your haven.  I am glad I experienced my first poutine at Banquise.

I was surprised by Montreal on all accounts. The metro was clean and easy to get to, the weather was amazing for a November afternoon, and the poutine...was...one of the best fast food items I have ever had in my life. I got the one with black pepper sauce (a must get!), ground beef, onions, and mushrooms all smothered by a thick coat of gravy. Unhealthy? definitely. Finger-lickin' good? For sure. I finished 3/4 of the plate by myself...pretty impressive if I say so myself...and finished the remaining 1/4 after I got back to the hotel hours later.

There are about 14 staff members cooking, cleaning and having breakfast. Including one french chap of mixed race who is dancing and singing to Bob Marley! (very cool IMHO). The wait staff wasn't too comfortable in English so they suffered through my bad French. (Doesn't ANYONE speak Gaelic anymore.lol) The menu that the server dropped off was only for breakfast. The server then seamlessly handed off my table to a young lady that had just arrived. They did it so well too. I was impressed. So going with the flow I ordered a complete breakkie. 3 Eggs over easy, ham, bacon , sausages, creton, toast and fresh fruit. As well as OJ and tea. JESUS WEPT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The meal was perfect. The eggs were not overdone at all.
