/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I am really impressed with Cadet's takeout during the covid-19 crisis. Ordering is through bouillon bilk and pick up is at Cadet. Each dish takes under 5 minutes to prepare and comes with instructions. Although their menu doesn't mentioned allergies, alot of their dishes can be made gluten free, just ask when you call to place an order.As entrees we ordered the boeuf saisi and crabe dishes. The beef was so we'll prepared and I loved the soy vinaigrette that came with it. The crabe was lovely, it was already shelled for you and served with a simple salad so that the crabe remained the star of the dish. From the marché section we ordered the foccacia and lobster bisque. I would highly recommend ordering these dishes! The lobster bisque was delicious and only cost $15 for 1L !!?? The focaccia is incredible, I wish I could just eat Cadet's focaccia all day long!For sides, we ordered the broccoli spaetzle. You just have to try it up quickly in a pan. It's served with a sort of ranch sauce and was delicious. I've already ordered takeout twice from Cadet, highly recommend you give it a try!"
/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,"Sister restaurant to Bouillon Bilk but not quite comparable.This is more like tapas style...small dishes to share. The decor is elegant and classy and the bar area with all the wines in display is pretty impressive!Went there for lunch time with a customer and we order 3 dishes to share. The crab salad was delicious, cauliflower was a bit too overpowering with all the seasoning on it. The short ribs were tender but kinda tasted like the cauliflower which was a bit disappointing. Service was friendly as expected from a restaurant of this class.It is on the expensive side but if you are going there for business than it's fine. If you need to choose between this and It's sister restaurant, go to Bouillon Bilk. Not bad overall."
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I wish I was taken here for my birthday instead of the other restaurant lol! But since it's quite reasonable compared to other restaurants with the same caliber, I could come here just because I want to splurge and indulge without it putting a hole in my wallet!Quite a fun night celebrating my husband's birthday. The service was excellent and the wine list is very accessible. You can get a 2L of chianti for 113$!!! Imagine that! We were reasonable and had a very good 57$ bottle of Italian red. Now onto the star of the show. The FOOD. Let me mention that I was worried that we didn't order enough food but I was so wrong! The focaccia was such a great surprise. Not your typical bread. It came grilled with cheese on top with this spicy piri-piri like dip. The cod fritters were crunchy and light as cloud. They were very generous with the oysters mushrooms with the Fleur des Monts cheese and the whole dish was just so delicious and delicate. The beef tartar was by far the best I've ever had and I've had plenty in my lifetime! Oh and the pièce de résistance. The fried sea bass with a Vietnamese influence was so enjoyable to eat. I loved everything about it. To end this amazing night, I ordered the chocolate tart, peanuts and mascarpone to celebrate the birthday boy. It tasted like an adult version of a very VERY fancy Reese peanut butter cup. I can't wait to come back!!!"
/user_details?userid=h8xK7S1xXUBP2qXW0ZPxxA,Laura R.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This restaurant is owned by the same owner as Bouillon Bilk. Let me preface this review by saying that Bouillon Bilk sits in a class apart- very few restaurants rival it. Thus, Cadet, though it boasts some amazing flavourful foods, does not compare to the five stars of its sister restaurant.We ordered many dishes that are meant to be shared, such as oysters, artichoke salad, focaccia bread with spicy sauce, beef tartare, halloumi salad, and scallop ceviche. Everything was flavourful, and the standout for me was the artichoke salad!To finish, I had the bread pudding! It was amazing. Also, the pineapple cocktail was great as well.The look of the restaurant is trendy and modern. Service was very personable and they have English menus, which is wonderful to see.Very few restaurants are open on Sunday night in Montreal, so this is a good bet!"
/user_details?userid=wo-35mPu8v1qrcAAx6aegA,Mikaela K.,"Detroit, MI",4 star rating,"Cadet is the more casual sister restaurant to the popular and legendary Bouillon Bilk. Cadet has a romantic, yet laid back atmosphere with a true wine bar feel. The waitress explained that the restaurant is known for small plates and that dishes are meant to be shared. We decided to order several dishes for dinner. We started the meal with the Beets and Mackerel. The beets came roasted and atop a delicious paste that was reminiscent of a hummus. The dish is adorned with fried halloumi cheese and sprinkled with a dried cherry and hazelnut dust. The salad is a magical combination of sweet and salty with an earthy flare from the beets. Up next was the mackerel. The fish was pan seared and cooked to perfection; the skin crispy and the inside flaky yet moist. The fish comes atop a mango and kimchi style salsa. The salsa was tangy and sweet and was the perfect highlight to the light fish. We then had the Brussel sprouts and chicken thighs. The Brussel sprouts were reminiscent of Easter dinner on a plate. The veggie is cooked perfectly, crispy but toothsome, and topped with a shaved ham and sprinkled with blue cheese, walnuts and grapes. This vegetable dish is hearty and perfectly balanced. The chicken was also cooked to perfection; juicy, tender and atop a piri piri sauce. The protein was finished off with a healthy sprinkling of peanuts. This was the only dish of the night that had an Asian fusion flare. If you are looking for amazing foodie creations from the team behind Bouillon Bilk but want a more laid back atmosphere, make sure to check out this hidden gem in the Plateau."

He was able to offer suggestions and spoke fluent English for those of us struggling with our French.  The food was absolutely fantastic and we were all able to taste one another's.  From rib eye to duck, to pork cheek,   to lobster rolls,  everything was cooked to perfection.  We would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting the area."

Wonderful service and mouthwatering small plates. Broccoli, späetzle, labneh, pistachios was a standout as was the Pork cheek and clams. And the bread pudding...Short cider list but we enjoyed a Swedish apple/pear variety. Pacing was excellent- never felt rushed in spite of a dining room at capacity."

Impressed with the mix of ingredients and spices. Highly recommended. We live in New York, travel and try different food and this place is definitely one of our favorites."
/user_details?userid=hUpOVNrFtc-_3-oSZvzRpQ,Mia V.,"Honolulu, HI",4 star rating,"Came here the other night for dinner and absolutely LOVED IT. Ordered a wide variety of dishes and everything was amazing. Flavors were inventive and unique, but paired very well. There wasn't a single thing we ordered that wasn't delicious. Presentation was also very good. Only complaint is that lots of dishes came out one after the other, leaving less time to enjoy each dish when it came to the table. After the first round of food came out, we were left waiting for the next dish for a while. After the main entrees came out, the wait for the dessert menu and check was also very long. Overall though, Cadet is an amazing restaurant and I will be returning!"
/user_details?userid=xz5-2fSiTyAzLybdB9tU7w,Nic Q.,"North Hatley, Canada",5 star rating,"What a great place to go right before a show. We got there at 6 and the place was packed, not single table free. They know everyone is going to show and get you out without feeling rushed at all.We really enjoyed our dinner, the artichoke salad, broccoli, beets, cod croquet and their special of the day which was calamari, ham, beans and maple syrup, kind cabane a sucre style. Make sure to leave room for desert, we were too full before the dessert of the day which sounded fantastic but had their bread pudding.I wish they and many other restaurant move away from terrible YP/Bookenda reservation system. Their app never works properly and even the website searching is bad."
/user_details?userid=P6S7G1dex1QIhWntV_f0IQ,Cecilia D.,"West Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"This joint is winning on all levels! The fact that it's open late to accommodate the Place Des Arts crowd, the innovative cocktails, the easy reservations, the gracious staff and the delicious food. We came here after hearing the magnificent Herbie Hancock, and it did not disappoint. Let's start and end with the food. Everything, from the focaccia bread with spicy dip to the veal liver, was superb. Even the simple fruit compote covered cheesecake at the end, was sublime. Pleasantly surprised that a couple of the dishes were Asian inspired with sprouts and a sweet-sour combo, it was indeed refreshing on a hot night.You need to eat at this tapas joint. You will not be disappointed."

I like trying new places and for our wedding anniversary decided to go there. We went there on a Sunday night wasn't full but wasn't empty. Service was amazing. The plates are shareable. We took the focaccia, potatoes plate, a Brussels sprout with other veggies and ribs. Each of the plates were  amazing. Def going back and making this our anniversary spot.  Sorry no pics, but my belly is realllyyy happy haha go try!"
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My wife decided to surprise me this week with a date night. All I knew was that we were going to eat somewhere but she kept it a secret until we headed out. After a short metro ride, we found ourselves in the Quartier des Spectacles district at Cadet, the second restaurant from the group that started the excellent Bouillon Bilk. I had mentioned Cadet to my wife at some point recently - I mention many restaurants throughout our conversations so I didn't remember exactly when I did so props to her for the wonderful idea.As mentioned before, Cadet is the second restaurant from the team behind Bouillon Bilk - chef François Nadon and Mélanie Blanchette. They are known for refined and imaginative dishes with great vine choices in a chic and modern minimalistic setting. Cadet fits that description to a T but with more of a sharing plates approach. Cadet has been called a wine bar in some reviews but I don't think that really gets at what Cadet does. It is more of a ""Tapas"" bar than a traditional wine bar but regardless - the wine list is extensive and the menu lends to sharing. We were recommended 5-6 dishes between the two of us.The meal started off with a pair of cod croquette served with a buttermilk and dill dipping sauce. Some of the best we have had in the city - fully packed with tons of cod filling with a great crunch on the exterior. The dipping sauce had a subtle dill flavour and the creamy richness paired well.The next dish was the kind of ingredient combination that this kitchen is known for and that from the outside, seems odd a bit but man it works so well : Broccoli with späetzle, labneh and pistachios. Great mix of textures and tons of flavour all around. I particularly loved how the labneh and späetzle - two items I had very little experience with - mixed together. A big hit for us.The next set of dishes stayed along a similar path. First, parnsip served over rösti with sauerkraut, sour cream and  juniper berries. The crunchy rösti served as a nice base to pair with the vinegary mixture of parsnip and sauerkraut and the cooling nature of the sour cream. We both really enjoyed this dish.The next one on paper was super weird: Crab served with pineapple, sour cream, green onions, chips and lettuce. My wife didn't love it but I really enjoyed it. There was some heat to this dish from somewhere so the use of the pineapple and the sour cream creates a nice contrast on each bite. The next dish was our disappointment for the night - fingerling potatoes served with chimichurri and mayonnaise. Compared to the rest of the meal, this dish lacked kick in all phases. The potatoes were too big and lacked the crunch you really wanted. The chimichurri didn't have the acidic bite so the contrast between that and the creamy mayo wasn't as interested as he had hoped for.The final dish made up for that slight disappointment. The best of the night: seared blood sausage served over basmati rice, squash, pumpkin seeds and green chili. Such a great usage of blood sausage. So unique and so very flavorful. The richness of the sausage, the crunch of the seeds, the heat from the chili, the calming nature of the rice. Loved every bite of this dish!Cadet was as hoped for: an excellent setting with great food, great wine and spot-on service all night. My wife did very well with her surprise choice. Now I need to up my game for the next date night! ;)Cheers!"
/user_details?userid=HXOfPXPMvdXNpQ_l0RRjKw,Jeffrey S.,"Midvale, UT",5 star rating,"Such a lovely set of circumstances led me to Cadet. It started several years ago, wherein I was destined to come to Montreal. That's beyond the scope of this review, but important to note in the story. With that as context, it seemed like such good fortune for me to have dinner here two weeks ago.I was road wary, having waited several years to visit Montreal, followed by several hours waiting for a delayed plane. By the time I arrived it was dark and late but the weather was absolutely perfect. After checking into the hotel, I headed out to finally, FINALLY really arrive.Hunger took over my mind, despite the lights, people, and energy on the street. Not two blocks from my hotel on Saint-Laurent, I fired up the Yelp app and it pointed me right in the direction of Cadet. Another block and I was there, my eyes confirming what the app was saying: it's completely underspoken, soft, cozy, warm, and perfect.I walked in and was greeted by a full house. At this point, it was after 10pm and people were sipping their wine and laughing, and in that soft light it seemed like there was no place else I should be. As a solo diner I opted to sit at the bar. The delightful bartender (Katherine? Oh dear... I have forgotten her name) took really good care of me, and helped me feel right at home. She helped with a few recommendations and then let me be. But was polite in conversation, even to a guy like me who wasn't drinking.Broccoli with spaëtzle with a creamy schmear of I dunno what? Yes, beautiful. But that beautiful eggplant, served sliced the long way, was amazing. Just right. Just the right size. It was a special that night, but if they've got it, you need it. They looked to have a great wine selection and know their way around a drink. I didn't get dessert, but now kinda wish I had. If you're looking for a great place to share a meal with friends, and especially with a date, this would certainly fit the bill. Great smaller plates, drinks -- the whole thing was a perfect welcome to years of pent-up desire to visit Montreal."
/user_details?userid=TVVhN_MV6ShoToC6nfeukw,Julie B.,"Menlo Park, CA",4 star rating,"We were looking for a French restaurant so our hotel sent  us here. However, I don't think it's classic French. It's much more exotic. Luckily, the food was very good. We both had the duck and I had the beet starter. It's a cosy place and we chatted with neighboring tables about what they were eating. Wish there were photos on the menu, or better descriptions.The wait staff could not have been more helpful.Great place!"
/user_details?userid=7LwNP-TCe1-pevp6KjYIPQ,Dan G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Tapas a la francaise!!I was worried when e got to this restaurant as the greeting at the door by the hostess was a bit cold. But once seated and our server took us through the menu choices and we were comforted. He knew the menu inside out and made some great recommendations. We ordered the cod croquettes which we not greasy and quite tasty. The spicy mayonnaise was very good but not very spicy. We also had the fried ravioli which was perfectly cooked with a dipping sauce. We had the fingerling potatoes which were also very good. All this with a couple glasses of red were perfect for a cold wet evening.tripadvisor.ca/ShowUserR…
/user_details?userid=z6R6cACJ4pJprFhdBeNh2Q,Jeffrey A.,"Iowa City, IA",5 star rating,"I am shook. Y'all I can't stop thinking about this food. Was it French? Was it Asian? Was it Canadian? Does God exist? Is he a Quebecois line cook on the weekends?From the hip vibe and the fact that everyone who works here is suspiciously attractive, to the why-haven't-more-places-done-this menu that applies the tapas approach to non-Spanish foods, I was gobsmacked from entry to exit.The portions were honestly generous for the tapas style, and even so Every. Single. Bite. was PACKED with flavor, texture, and beautifully plated to boot. Because on the eighth day of creation God watched Food Network and was inspired by the funky plates and stuff.Come hungry and save room for dessert. Or don't. Purge in the bathroom and come back for more. You'll thank me later."
/user_details?userid=tWBLn4k1M7PLBtAtwAg73g,Jay M.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Montreal has an issue with Monday's and restaurants being open in the downtown area. Luckily, I found Cadet and made a reservation for a table during a recent visit. The general approach to their menu is sharing plates, with a mix of influences in regards to their cooking. From fresh baked foccacia, a crazy good vegetable curry, broccoli spatzel with labneh, piri piri chicken thighs, pork belly with chicarron, notice the complete lack of theme here?While this may seem a bit of a hodge podge of ingredients and influences, the flavours were all so impressive and varied that I think it actually works to it's benefit. I literally cleaned the curry bowl out with the foccacia - the flavour combos were unreal.Interior is classy, servers are on point, local beer selections, wine menu with moderately priced options, we were impressed from start to finish with the experience. 5 stars without a doubt."
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Cadet was one of the new places on my list to try. Bouillon Bilk, their sister restaurant, is unbelievably good so I was hoping for more of the same with their new spot.We made a reservation for two but turns out we didn't need it. When we arrived on an early Sunday evening, we were one of the first people there. Cbear was super worried that we would be under dressed (considering how fancy Bouillon Bilk is) but Cadet seems to have a much more relaxed vibe to it. Not to say it isn't gorgeous, it is, it's just more chill. Think casual chic.Our waitress was great and service was excellent. We sat by the window to people watch the night away. Man, Montreal has some interesting characters, especially in this neck of the woods.Menu - clean, simple, just like the restaurant itself. We were told that the menu starts on the lighter side of things and gradually moves to heavier, stronger tasting dishes. Click here and here if you want a closer look.It's all about small plates here. Our waitress recommended that each person order 2-3 plates. The way they brought out the dishes was well paced and thoughtful. Hope you like sharing because this is what differentiates them from BB.- Cocktail and cider - I didn't take any notes on the drinks but they were both good.- Scallop ceviche ($18.00) - with cherry pepper and cucumbers. Holy crap, this was fantastic. The presentation is breathtaking - it comes out on massive shell and underneath, there's about 6 pieces of fresh, succulent scallops. Came with a side of taro chips. Perfect vehicle to make mini scallop chip bites.- Dumplings ($16.00) - interesting to see dumplings on the menu. Very Asian influenced. Shrimp on top and pork dumplings underneath. Not quite sure what they're trying to do with the pairing - the shrimp had a creamy sauce while the dumplings had a sweet soy based sauce. Eaten separately, it was fine.- Lobster ($16.00) - with potato, lemongrass and mayo. The lobster was tasty although there could have been more chunks. The lemongrass foam was the most interesting part of this dish.- Beef short rib ($16.00) - with avocado and sprouts. The sauce rub was sweet and sticky. I liked the use of avocado in this dish. I would never have thought to pair the two together.- Ouppet ($3.00) - I've never had a real Whippet before (sorry, my childhood lacked in the junk food category) so I can't compare it to the OG. I wasn't sure if I was going to be a fan of the ouppet but it grew on me. These are made in house. Marshmallow on the inside and chocolate outside. Probably worth a try for nostalgic sake.Overall, we enjoyed our meal. When we went (back in June), they had just opened so I'm sure they've fine tuned and tightened up the menu since then."
/user_details?userid=hFvLG_m26hYMx1UGQSpaEg,Jo N.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"The decor of this restaurant is beautiful, nice place to take someone special on a date. The lighting gives it a romantic feel to it. This place is open late, good for small dishes but if you're coming for a full dinner, this is not the place. There is not much that will be filling. Their tapas are extremely small and pricey for the portion. However, they have a special menu that they don't tell people about. You can order 1kg boneless short ribs for $100 or 1.2kg for $120. The portion was smaller than expected. We ordered this and shared among a group of people. It was not filling at all. It would be good for 2-3 people I think. However, the flavour was good though.  Maybe if shared with a smaller group it would be filling. But for $100-$120. It's kinda not worth it. You're better off going somewhere else."

This restaurant is so conveniently close to our favorite hotel, the W Montreal by the Victoria Square. We enjoyed the dinner right before attending a concert at the Mtelus which is nearby too!

Our waitress was gracious and patient as we tasted a wine we weren't sure about ordering. We shared everything and the portions were extremely generous. the highlight for me was the short ribs marinated and sauced with flavors both sweet ad savory. All the vegetables we tried were exciting combinations of cauliflower, artichokes, mushrooms, potatoes. Each plate was a discovery of how the main ingredient paired with other flavors in a thoughtful and creative way."

It's incredible and very convenient for us tourists to have nice dinner places like this that are open so late! Since I was on the mend from a bout of food poisoning we ordered only a few dishes to share -octopus, cod croquettes, fluke ceviche, watercress salad, and beef tartare. I enjoyed all the dishes despite my stomach troubles.  The cocktails were also very yummy - we had the last word and an old fashioned, both nicely made (not too sweet and with a good kick of alkie just how we like it).Service was great and I would definitely recommend a visit."
/user_details?userid=ERbvtBequSV6YQaaHunAVA,O G.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Nothing like this in LA. Or rather, a lot of places in LA are like this, serving small plate items with fancy names, but without the accompanying great flavors, style, decor, service and attitude that seem effortless here. And the tapas plates here were actually decent sized. Sadly and stupidly I didn't document the meal, thinking I'd be able to look at the menu later. Well, 2 weeks later the menu has changed, so other than a incredible veggie curry like you've never tasted, a delicious lamb dish with shockingly good herbs and spice combos, a great chilled smoked salmon plate, I can't remember the other dish we ordered, other than it was also a veggie dish and also great. But I do remember the insane chocolate cake desert.The chef seems to be a genius in mixing and blending flavor combos you'd never think of. And, I washed it all down with a typically excellent local Montreal brewed beer. It was right around the corner from our hotel and was one of the few places open on a dreary, chilly, rainy Monday night. The warm yet minimalist room welcomed us in and we were seated rapidly in a barely occupied room. But as the evening continued, it filled rapidly and soon was almost full, both the tables and the elegant dining bar. Also shockingly affordable, at least with the advantageous $US exchange.I took no photos either! Flog me! (look online)I'd eat here once a week if I lived there. That darn good!"
/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",5 star rating,"Cadet is the perfect spot for a birthday celebration. Modern, comfortable, not too noisy, dim lights, but it has kind of energetic atmosphere. The service was perfect, attentive, non intrusive, timely. The food was a pleasure, ordered by preference follow my favourite dishes. The gnudi are must have: light and puffy, the squash sauce with pumpkin seeds and bacon made the dish heavenly. The arctic char blini are magic and the octopus was cooked to perfection. I stole a piece of pastrami and a potato with chimichurri sauce from the plates of the birthday girl and they were yummi. The watercress salad is fine if you need something green to chew on, the combination with endive and feta cheese was enjoyable. The only disappointment is the fluke ceviche, the spicy mayonnaise simply eliminated the taste of the fish, which I find essential in ceviche. My dessert pick is the cheese cake. We had a glimpse at the kitchen from our table and observed a structured well organized production of wonderful dishes that were subject to strict quality control. Besides the good food Cadet has an exemplary beverage list. All that contributes to a fun time with good friends, making it perfect restaurant for a special occasion! Nice choice NLM!"

I agree with the earlier excellent reviews especially one by Jeffery A.They transform simple dishes like the fingerling potato  to something beyond divine. Same goes for broccoli  . We tried their special pork belly, clams with cabbage  that was superb.Wine pairing suggestions were also phenomenal. Our host was excellent and service impeccable. Makes me understand better the quote from ""Kate and Leopald"" -""Where I come from, the meal is the result of reflection and study, menus are prepared in advance, timed to perfection. It is said, without the culinary arts the crudeness of reality would be unbearable. ""Bottomline - Will definitely visit this Restaurant again and again!"

The tartare is one of the best I've had in the city. Great level of spice(ask for it to be spicy... you won't regret).  The 2nd course was cod and it wasn't as good as I would have liked. Overall a good experience nonetheless and I'll definitely be back.

We were blown away by the entire experience. The ambience of this place was incredible: Candlelit tables, great music selection (Frank Ocean, Tame Impala, Anderson.Paak, Childish Gambino) and a very knowledgeable wait staff. Our waiter (didn't get his name, but he was tall and blue-eyed) was great. And I haven't even gotten to the food! Everything was delicious! We ordered several ""small plates"" which are tapas-style, and one ""big plate"", which for us was lobster. It was one of the best bites I've ever had. The lobster melted in my mouth. After each bite I shook my head in disbelief. We finished up with dessert, which was outstanding as well. There's some kind of aphrodisiac in the food here. Needless to say, we enjoyed our experience and would recommend to anyone visiting Montreal!"

/user_details?userid=3OoOcwDTSjhbisfUqV5tfw,Ysa C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I had walked by this mysterious restaurant so many times on my way to dance class. It was always full house, but there was no name on the restaurant door and people that were having dinner there seemed so relaxed and comfortable, as if I was peaking through the windows of somedy's house. I recently learned that this restaurant was Cadet, the sister restaurant of Bouillon Bilk that I love. I knew I had to try eat, better sooner than later.The dishes are in the form of tapas, meant to share. They usually recommend 3 to 4 per person. We were 4 and we got 10 in total and it was just enough.We got: The watercress salad, the grilled octopus, the cod, the calmars,the pastrami, the broccoli, the beet salad, the mousse de foie, veal bavette and the lemon cake.All the dishes were extremely tasty and very well executed. My favourites were the watercress salad, the cod, the grilled octopus and the lemon cake (which was simple but yet perfect to end the meal). Bill ended being $33 per person without the drinks. Service was very low-key but very efficient and on point. The ambiance is contemporary and cozy despite the simplistic decor. It was just right. I would definitely go back!"

Coming from NYC, we were amazed by how affordable everything was. $14 CAD for the duck confit which easily would have cost $35 in new york. we got the Beets (one of the best flavor combinations we've ever eaten), Broccoli (incredibly delicious ajd comforting), and duck (rich, hearty, and so so good). The cocktails were also incredible. The only downside would be that the wine was underwhelming (the red wine was also served ice cold which was strange) and the beer selection was minimal. But other than that, a delicious and homey spot well gladly come back to before we leave."
/user_details?userid=rX0MVNZ4wrtI7fw_D8HRag,Sandy W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I had a recommendation from a friend to try this place since it's the sister restaurant of Bouillon Bilk which is one of my favourite fine dining restaurants in Montreal. It is more affordable and the dishes are a less complex but still well composed. The menu items are divided by different categories such as vegetables dishes, seafood dishes, and meat & poultry dishes. I recommend getting maybe 4-6 dishes to share between two people. The portions are rather small so be prepared to order more than 4 dishes if needed. My most memorable dish was the lobster salad. My friend and I felt that the beef tartare was good but on the sweeter side of what we are use to. The broccoli and spätzle dish was really delicious! The chocolate cake was pretty big and reminded me of a Black Forest cake but with raspberry. So make sure to have room for that if you plan on ending your meal with that!"

Decided to meet up with some friends for a nice meal when I was in town. My friend suggested Cadet. There is no sign outside of the restaurant so its easy to miss. The restaurant decor creates a nice ambiance and the staff is extremely welcoming/professional. The menu comprises of many small plates. We ordered a bunch to share including some of the specials of the night. The waitress also had brought out a complimentary dish from the kitchen which made us feel special. Will definitely be coming again next time I'm in Montreal.

The cheesy crust was a great touch. - Marinated salmon - Great dish. All the taste of a lox bagel, minus the carbs.  - Octopus with chickpeas - succulent, delicious.  - Chicken thighs with piri piri sauce - The chicken was moist and tender, and the piri piri sauce reminded me of a mix between Thai peanut and BBQ sauce.  - Smoked pork, escargots, gnocchi - Skip this one! This is the only dish that wasn't a home run. The escargot and smoked pork were fine, but the gnocchi were dense and hard-- not light and airy like I expect gnocci to be. The parmesan cheese in this dish was too sharp and overwhelming, overpowering the delicate flavors.The small plates are definitely large in size. We selected 5, but could have gotten away with 4. We also opted for dessert - a pasty with ice cream that was absolutely delicious.Cadet is definitely worth a trip. The food is outstanding, and the price is extremely reasonable for the quality and portion size."

We started off with some cocktails and ordered the beets, beef tartare, broccoli, and octopus. This was the perfect amount of food. Everything was clean, flavorful, and made well. The beef tartare and octopus were my favorites. I wasn't a huge fan of the broccoli with spaetzle, but I think spaetzle just may not be my thing.Overall a solid place with good vibes!"

/user_details?userid=la8PBQf9DlvECkrqsDRmHA,Dong H.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"On the spectrum of ""small plates"" these were definitely on the larger size so, comparatively, a great value for the price. We ended up ordering seven items and were super stuffed by the end of the meal. We began with the focaccia & a fried zucchini/baba ganoush appetizer. Next came the fingerling potatoes, which were okay, but could have used some salt, and the brussel sprouts, which came in a sauce that reminded me of American Orange Chicken. Tasty, but once I thought of the orange chicken comparison I couldn't stop. The next round was the oyster mushrooms, which were topped with some filler lettuce, and the smoked pork with escargots, super salty fried gnocchi and lemon confit. To finish we chose the bread pudding, which thankfully wasn't very big because we were so full. Highlights: Bread pudding, great wine by the glass pricing"

Was able to get a table for two without reservations and with a little time restraint. Chose to sit at the beautiful long bar with intimate lighting. Excellent and knowledgeable service.Do not typically enjoy trendy small-plate joints as the food is often too contrived and overrated. Cadet is an exception with hardly any missteps. Panzanella takes the incredibly fresh and ripe seasonable sliced heirloom tomatoes mixed with a garlic aioli that is not heavy and whipped delicately next to the vinaigrette dressing. Crispy croutons to pair. Thinly sliced duck breast wrapped with cucumber lends an Asian flare with sesame cashews and pear on top. Perfect little bites. Craving more. On the Asian theme, highly recommend the pork dumplings with creamy shrimp salad. In your own kitchen, this probably would never work but Cadet takes two dishes that have nothing to do with each other and marry with flavor and texture. The dumpling dough is thick but not gummy, helpful to keep the pork intact as you take a bite. The soy/vinegar-based sauce is slightly strong mixed with the mayo-based shrimp salad.Finish the meal with ouppet. Malomars on another level."

When we informed the waitress of the specific allergens before ordering, she was cavalier about the matter and seemed uninterested in the details of the specific food allergies. After taking our paper note to the kitchen which detailed the allergies, the waitress came back and told us that everything was fine. But after eating a few bites of the lobster--the ingredients of which were all but clear to the waitress-- my wife had an allergic reaction, which intensified after we left the restaurant and resulted in a hospital visit. Fortunately the new CHUM medical centre is located a short cab ride from Cadet.  If you or someone you are dining with has a serious food allergy, I simply can't recommend this place."
/user_details?userid=JB82DwkKQ8LpQ59QkXVxSQ,Sonia S.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Let me start off by saying that my husband and I have high standards when it comes to food. We live in NYC, and I was raised by French parents. I have a sensitive palette :) So on our first night visiting Montréal, we naturally decided to have dinner at Bouillon Bilk-a very highly rated restaurant close to our hotel. Unsurprisingly, the place was full and we were told that without a reservation the wait could be an hour. Fortunately, the host suggested we check out their sister restaurant, aptly named Cadet (which means second child in the family for my non-francophone readers). We shrugged and figured why not? So we walked the one block to Cadet- and WOW. One of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had. Our waiter, Arnaud, was very friendly, efficient,  and answered all of our questions. He even gave us several suggestions re events going on in Montreal to check out- which is more than I can say for our hotel's front desk. The food was excellent -they pair ingedients that you wouldnt normally see together but all the dishes work- for example strawberry with pepper, fluke tartar with soybeans, terrine with pistachios... The beef tartar was my favorite dish, and the marinated beef was so light and tender. The raw oysters came with 3 separate sauce jars- strawberry, lemon and spicy. Each dish was presented and explained in detail when it came to our table--5 star service but with a comfortable, not stuffy atmosphere. Prices are also very reasonable. I was shocked to find out theyd only been open for 3 days- normally at this nacent stage even the best restaurants are still trying to figure themselves out and dont really have their sh*t together. I even spoke with Elise, the manager who was friendly and very open to feedback. My one critique is that the host of Bouillon Bilk had no information about Cadet other than this location and we informed Elise of this. Ive always wanted to write a Yelp review but aleays procrastinated. When I saw that Cadet had no reviews yet, I figured this would be a great way to break my Yelp cherry."

The highlights for me were the broccoli, cod and short rib dishes. I cannot eat seafood so missed out on all that, but the table loved the shrimp-topped dumplings!The desserts were excellent overall, but the crust on the rhubarb tart was a feat to break up (even with a knife!). Bring strong arms/hands if you are thinking of giving it a try! The sundae was amazing, and very generous; you could definitely split it at least two ways. Relaxed vibe, worth checking out!"

We had focaccia with a tomato sauce, the broccoli which other reviewers have described, roasted mushrooms with shallots and greens, veal with chorizo and pearl onions, and a black pudding with celery root and apples. The black pudding was probably the most interesting dish--- it was in balls, rather than in sausage like I've normally seen it and had celery root noodles with a Dijon remoulade. Everything was excellent, but the vegetables were better than the meats overall. We had a pecan tart with coffee ice cream for dessert that was phenomenal.Some reviewers have complained about the size of the portions. I felt like these were normal small plates portions, but I did think that the sizing was uneven. For example, my husband couldn't finish all of the veal, but I ate all of the black pudding myself and was still hungry (so I ate some of the veal).Also, for a wine bar, I was not super impressed with the wine selection. I was served red wine in a white wine glass, and it seemed like there were more roses on the menu than reds or whites, which was especially odd since we went in January. Overall, while I would probably give this 4.5 stars because of the wine, I'm rounding up because the food was so good!"

The waiter recommended two to three plates per person.  We started with the oysters. It came with three types of mignonette... a strawberry one , a piri piri one and a lemon one. Then we had the fluke tartare which I really didn't like. It had bean sprouts and raspberry. I didn't like the taste of the fish on its own and I actually liked the taste of the fish better with the raspberry. My favorite dish was the beef tartare. If they had a bigger size I would go back and just order that. I also really enjoyed the pork and shrimp dumplings. There was sour cream on top.  I also liked the duck breast with cucumber and cashews but my two brothers didn't. One brother really enjoyed the broccoli. I've never had broccoli like that before... there was labneh (yogurt) , pistachio and spätzle (egg noodles) . This dish to me tasted like those cheesy goldfish crackers!!

/user_details?userid=bCC9m7vuNKISQ-ckJ98fJQ,She H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Flavourful and savoury.  That's how I would describe our recent experience at Cadet. I love trying out new places, but I think Cadet just made it onto my list of restaurants to keep for return visits and out of town guests. We were there on a weeknight and the restaurant wasn't extremely busy and thus not too noisy. The service was attentive and friendly. We were told to pick 2-3 plates each and we decided to go with most of the waitress' suggestions. The foccacia bread came highly recommended and it's a great way to start the evening. It comes with a spicy mayonnaise that just opens up your palate and prepares you for the rest of the meal. Next, we tried the cod nuggets, grilled calamari salad and grilled mushrooms. The fried cod nuggets were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I loved how well it paired with the bed of pickled coleslaw it was sitting on. The calamari salad had an Asian twist to it that I enjoyed, but I didn't enjoy the fishy aftertaste as much. The grilled mushroom was my least favorite dish of the evening mainly because I didn't enjoy the cheese it was paired with. The next 4 dishes we had were all amazing and I would suggest that you get them all, if your stomach allows for it. First, the smoked pork with snails and gnocchi was a very tasty dish sprinkled with pistachio. Next, the grilled octopus with fried chickpeas and hummus is also worth trying. My favorite of the evening was the broccoli and spaetzle. The crispy noodles hidden within the dish were a lovely surprise. Finally, the special of the night was a curry made of kabocha squash and udon. It was a little harder to split  but I would gladly order it again if it were available. By then, we were stuffed, but we decided to split one last dessert and it was the best decision of the night. Their bread pudding is to die for! It is soaked in the most delicious caramel sauce and you really can't go wrong by finishing off the evening with such an amazing dessert. I really enjoyed my evening at Cadet. I loved that the portions were sizeable and had we been four people, we could've still easily shared each plate and had a decent tasting portion. We tried 9 items on the menu and without drinks, spent about $30-35 before taxes. For the quality of food, I think the value was great. It wasn't too salty or greasy, but wonderfully flavorful. I would happily return to Cadet in the future with friends and family."
