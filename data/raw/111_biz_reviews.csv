The food and service were awesome. The boudin and the confit de canard were delicious. The tartiflette was also very generous. Highly recommend, one of the best BYOW in Montreal."

Since we were a group, we didn't have a choice but to take the group menu. I think that it can be expensive depending ok what items you choose for a 50$ menu. Especially if you're vegetarian like my SIL. She had a small green salad, a pasta dish with basic white mushrooms (not wild) and a very small piece of cheese for dessert. I had the boudin as an appetizer, the pork chop as the main and the cheesecake  for dessert. Both my appetizer and main were ok but the dessert fell short. Service on the other hand was impressive because there was only two waitresses for the whole restaurant (it was packed)! I don't know how long this restaurant has been opened but it needs a bit of tweaking in my opinion."

The area is cute as they have nice lights on the street similar to st-laurent street but parking is brutal. It is a bring your own wine which is nice and the saq is right across the street from the bistro. I had the boudin as an entree and the duck confit. I loved the boudin entree. Very soft texture and wonderful taste - you wouldn't think your eating blood sausage. The duck was well done and tasted good the side dish of potatoes was also excellent. The salad left to be desired. My friend tried the foie gras entrée and I got to taste it but was not impressed at all - the foie gras was hard and cold and not creamy like it's supposed to be. I also tried a bite of the crab cakes. It was good but I'm happy I had the boudin.  Also I tried some of the bucatini tartufata which was very good as well but soooo oily. A little too much oil was left in the bowl at the end. But the tartufata was a very nice surprise - I've never had anything like it. Tasted a bit like an escargot in garlic. For desert we had the panna cotta and the blueberry cheesecake. I enjoyed both. Service was good but would I come back? Don't think so. I've had better food overall and nothing really stood out to me.
