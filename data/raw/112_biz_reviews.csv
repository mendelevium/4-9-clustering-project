/user_details?userid=5dqRk_v2pi-U4q3nRamkHw,Damond F.,"Manchester, NH",5 star rating,Stopped in for lunch while in Montreal. Was seated quickly and service was great. We got the lunch special which was a burger and fries. It was delicious. My wife was thrown by them serving mayo as the condiment for the fries. But it made the fries taste so much better. Next time we are in town can't wait to try some other versions of their fries as its their stable.Also they use disposable paper straws so drink your soda fast! :)
/user_details?userid=GHnnA42a8rRNXhhdQLM9Rg,Ria K.,"Fairfax, VA",4 star rating,"For my first poutine experience in Canada, I couldn't have been more pleased. Frite Alors has so many variety of poutine that it was difficult for my friend and I to choose, but we eventually settled on the La Montréalais and La Menace Nucléaire, and got the dessert poutine to finish- far too much food for the two of us, but no regrets.La Montréalais was piled with meat for which we had heard Montreal was famous for, and each bite was satisfyingly meaty and smoky, with the signature cheesy squeak that is signature of a good poutine. La Menace Nucléaire was surprisingly delicious and the flavors were quite authentic- as a Korean, I was more than happy to munch on delicious kimchi and bulgogi as a poutine topping. The bulgogi was sweet, as it should be, and the kimchi tasted stir-fried beforehand, also giving it a sweeter, more rounded flavor profile that is friendlier to those not as accustomed to the taste.The dessert poutine was a little disappointing- I was hoping for something more compelling, but it felt very much like my child self dipping fries into my milkshake- there wasn't much connecting the fries to the ice cream.Would I go back? Absolutely- I would love to try the other flavors, and it's a shame we didn't have a chance to return while in Canada."
/user_details?userid=jqqB8hWF8kIrv2-qWt23xg,Kristen L.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"The portion sizes are massive, the space is super chill with absolutely no pretension, and the poutine SLAPS. Frite Alors has an extensive poutine menu, so whatever you're in the mood for, they will likely have. The menu items are pretty creative and elaborate, which is definitely a huge plus if you're in the mood for some non-traditional poutine. The milkshake was just the right thing to complement that exceedingly decadent meal."
/user_details?userid=xpcb1eyHT44iT2pi_WdeWg,Derek D.,"Salt Lake City, UT",5 star rating,"I got a classic poutine to go, which may have been some of the best I had while in Montreal. The fries stayed reasonably crispy even though I waited a bit before eating. The gravy wasn't overly-peppery like some of the others I had. Overall, pretty satisfied I'd say."
/user_details?userid=tuD4f7RtaCuLn32jLiGTGw,Eunice L.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious poutine and the service was on point.  When I saw that our server had a Back to the Future shirt on I knew this was gonna be a fun place. This place actually bills itself I found this place on Yelp and it was super easy to walk to from the main train station: Berry-UQAM.  Once inside the hardest decision was trying to decide on what to eat because there were so many different flavours and foods available (Belgian style fries, poutine, burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches).  As this was a midday snack, I opted for a ""La Vladimir"" poutine that also came in a petit (small) size.  My fries came drenched in gravy with some classic cheese curds a fork stabbed through the middle ready to go.  The server was great I initially asked for a table and ordered in French but then she spoke French back to me and I didn't realize she was asking me what I would like to drink so she switched to English without skipping a beat. She also checked if everything was OK after our first few bites and topped up our waters regularly.  I wasn't expecting that for a casual poutine restaurant so her efforts were much appreciated.   Thank you for a delicious poutine experience."
/user_details?userid=yBzusnZmw_QcETaUyVfWdg,Grant L.,"Burlington, VT",3 star rating,"Pretty much what you would expect for a french fry specialty place with burgers and some other sandwiches. They have a very nice selection of flavored mayonnaise for dipping french fries. Good selection of burgers and other sandwiches. Service was very good. Reasonably clean. Specifically, burgers were overcooked and dry. Fries were reasonable but not outstanding. No alternatives to french fries such as sweet potato fries or onion rings. Serving sizes were generous."
/user_details?userid=APph4_qUbOWCeoS3dwX5Zw,Lauren D.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"For my first trip to Canada I knew I poutine had to be one of my first meals. I had seen Frite Alors on Yelp before my trip and it just so happened that where we stayed in Montreal was right around the corner from this location - so it was an easy decision for our first lunch after arriving.The restaurant is charming and casual, definitely kid-friendly and relaxed. We sat at the counter and got some drinks .. the cider was yummy! And the waiters were friendly enough. The poutine was yummy - I obviously did not have much to compare it too but in my mind, where can it go wrong? Fries, cheese curds, gravy and meat! Yum. Definitely a good casual spot to try."
/user_details?userid=XeocR5Pv87pMtgq_4Naxmg,Chesa C.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"My first poutine in Quebec came from Frite Alors. While walking to my work activities, I kept noticing their cute sign since it seemed like the fries were screaming ""frite alors!"" at me. When the server came by, I asked her what her favorite poutine was and she quickly and confidently responded with the taco poutine (ground beef, spices, grilled onions, avocados, tomatoes, sour cream, Mexican spicy sauce and nachos). My colleague ordered the la cochonne (fatty bacon and onion, fun fact: I found out cochonne means whore). My favorite loaded fries type-a dish is carne asada fries from San Diego, which consist of crispy fries (thinner than what you'd find in poutine) topped with guacamole, sour cream, carne asada (steak), pico de gallo, salsa, and shredded cheese. The fries are served hot, so if you keep the to-go box closed for a minute, the cheese will melt deliciously on top.Overall, the fries were a great consistency but I'm not sure if the blend of flavors with the taco poutine work for me. It reminds me of a Canadian version of carne asada fries, which just meant a thicker fry and gravy and cheese curds added to the above toppings. I wasn't crazy about the gravy flavors combined with the Mexican ""spicy"" sauce (salsa) and the texture of the curds was a little out of place. I put the spicy in quotations because for my spice lovers, it wasn't very spicy at all. I loved the cochonne though! The bacon and the onions were delicious with the fries and the curds.RESULTS:- For me, this place is a 3.5 rounded up to 4. I would take my review with a grain of salt though because I have not eaten poutine many times in my life.- Good place for poutine (though, not the best) and the cocktails are reasonably priced.- Quick and kind service!"

We ordered the classic Vladimir and the General Tao's. Both good, but General's was the standout-- we cleaned that plate. Place was relaxed, yet tables were filling up on a Saturday night because of the popularity of the area. Would have loved a more unique cocktail menu to go with the poutine."

/user_details?userid=-ZqPTpx9TyyvdAWbajdilA,Jessica S.,"San Diego, CA",4 star rating,"We chose this restaurant at random, based on a handful of factors. It was close to our hotel; it was close to a metro station; they had things other than poutine on the menu; they were open.We needed a quick but hearty meal before heading to a music festival the morning we stopped here, and in that we weren't disappointed. The restaurant was one of few along the Rue Saint-Denis that were open at the time, and we didn't really want to spend too much time wandering when we had a trip to manage.So, we entered the establishment and walked up the stairs to be greeted and seated by one of the waitresses working that day. She gave us a small table next to the windows, so we were able to watch the street wake up.The menu, as I mentioned, featured items other than poutine, and though that was my requirement for the day, what did I end up ordering but a variation of poutine! We placed our orders - a Mexican version for me (meat, salsa, guacamole and salsa, complete with one tortilla chip), and the L'eau à la Bush for him (steak, onions and mushrooms). Much as we wanted to add a beer to our order, we both abstained and went with just water, instead. We were planning on being in the sun at the festival all day, after all, and wanted to be as hydrated as possible going in.The restaurant is rather large, and very bright and airy, thanks to the large windows. It was nice sitting there, enjoying the breeze and people-watching. I enjoyed that part very much.Our food came out pretty quickly, and I was surprised by the servings. Initially, I thought they were kind of small, but once we dug in, I realized how deceptive looks can be. There was a lot of food there!So yes, they were fries, and probably not the healthiest of choices, but it was pretty dang good. My version was like a taco on fries, plus the brown gravy that seems to be everywhere. I didn't think I'd enjoy it quite as much as I did, especially given the fact that I didn't think brown gravy would pair with things like sour cream and guacamole. Silly me.My husband's meal was a bit more ""typical"", with meat and sauce mixed in with his fries. He enjoyed his tremendously, and put a pretty good dent into his bowl. I didn't do quite so well with mine - it was a lot of food, I tell ya! - but I certainly was full by the time I tapped.The waitress was friendly, and kept coming by to ensure our water glasses were full, and to check  on us. It was nice, considering there were only three other tables occupied at that time. Overall, it was a good, quick, cheap experience that filled us up and helped us prep for the day ahead. Random it might have been, I am glad we ended up here."

Nothing to note as far as decor ....It's a place for a quick bite and I had to have the poutine before we left ... after all it's the food of my people ( I am half French/Canadian) The staff was very friendly and curtious. The only thing is that it was cold out that morning and they had all the front awnings open, like open to the cold, outside air... so dress warm!"

Frites Alors was my favorite of the two poutine places we stopped at on this trip to Montreal. Boyfriend got the sausage and onion poutine. The gravy was really good - thin but not too watery, super flavorful and delicious. Cheese curds were good, and the onions were red which are my favorite kind, and I thought a nice touch that elevated the whole dish. The only disappointment was the sausage - the flavor was there but it was REALLY spicy, too spicy for me. I didn't want a full poutine so I just went with frites. They have a ton of different flavored mayonnaise/sauces which I just loved. I got the béarnaise mayo which was more bearnaise flavors and not the sauce itself so slightly disappointing, but still good.The service was good and there wasn't a line or wait to get in - always a plus. I'd go back!"

I split a L'Hambourgeois outfitted with a ciabatta bun, subbed the salad/fries option with a side of classic gravy-curds poutine. While I'm no stranger to poutine, my stateside experience has always been some elevated gastropub reinterpretation. It was nice to go classic. The fries were deliciously crisped and held up well against the gravy. As for the burgers-- move aside ketchup-- they're dressed from their lengthy sauce list. I also got a separate salad order and was impressed by the freshness. Who raves about a salad at a fries place?

Nicely painted camels on the walls, cute pictures and fonts on the menu (bonus points as i'm in graphics!) and friendly waitress. Fries are crispy and crunchy, and great experience overall.I had Le Rudolph Burger, which is moose meat (or so the menu says elk) with onion sauce (a lot of it! my hand was dripping with it), dijon, cheese, and pickles (which i took out). They don't stinge on the condiments. I never had moose before, the texture is like beef, though it's not beefy in taste. It doesn't have the gross bits of tendons and fat in the burger like beef does. It's meaty and leaner I would say. There's not a distinctive taste to it, really. Interesting try, very filling. it was a lot of moose/elk lol.I dipped my fries in Pistou-Rosé, which has mayo, basil, dried tomatoes, oil and pine nuts. Don't regret it. It tastes greattt- kind of like hummus dip which I liked better than the other sauces like Aioli, which had more mayo than flavour.A quirky thing i'd like to point out is the soap. Absolutely love the scent! Been trying to find the scent everywhere for years but couldn't; it's like a nice berry fruity mix. If anyone knows where I can get the soap, please let me know :P"

The Tunisienne ($9) was better, smothered in crumbled spicy merguez. Ohhhh poutine. After a long, foodless train ride, this Montreal favorite did the trick for filling our bellies with greasy, comforting goodness - though I really, really wished the toppings were hotter. A ""small"" size is heavy enough to be a meal for one person. I finished an order all by myself, and consequently felt like I hated everything and wanted to lie down. The food was 3 stars - try the Tunisienne. I'm giving 4 stars because our waiter was insanely friendly and helpful. He gave us food and beer suggestions and we got to try some local Quebec brews immediately! Blanche de Chambly is good if you like light, citrusy Belgians.

The pulled pork was cooked and sauced excellently. At no point did I feel the pork was dry. They used some kind of sweet sauce, which combined with the poutine's gravy to make a sort of sweet poutine, which is unlike any other poutine I've had before. Would I have it again? Probably not, but that's just because I prefer salty poutine.The fries were cooked Belgian-style, which in my opinion is the only valid way to do fries for poutine. (Thin fries, e.g. McDonalds, don't hold up well to gravy.) The fries were cooked very nicely, with a very crisp exterior and a soft interior that wasn't undercooked."

I never set foot in this place again because I was trying to get healthier. In any case, I brought my parents in after my mom mentioned something about a craving for fries three months ago. Man what a disappointment it was. The fries were terrible..I was embarassed that I had even raved about them to my parents in the first place.... Either their standards have changed from 4 years ago, or we were uucky that day. Either way, can't give more than a 3! Sorry!"

/user_details?userid=GkbaBeSGvt-UmIcefpEARA,Andrea L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"One of the neat things about Montreal is that even fast food is made with quality ingredients and served with alcohol. When you have that ""beer and a burger"" craving, you don't need to go to the local pub, you can head to Frite Alors!.I give this place four stars...Star #1 is for the local microbrews and homemade iced tea. All yummy.Star #2 is for the burgers. They're served on good-quality buns and there are lots of delicious toppings. (Unfortunately for dairy-free me, lots of those toppings are cheese. Oh, how I miss cheese).Star #3 is for the frites. They are skinny fries served in a paper cone, à la Belgique. They are served with your choice of homemade mayo. I can recommend the aïoli, the Frite alors, and the Béarnaise, which tastes even herb-ier if you request vinegar for your fries. Someday I have to try piccallili, which I love with crackers and cheddar but have never thought of trying with fries.I always go in promising to have salad instead of fries (or at least half-half) but the frites are just too yummy to pass up. Also very filling. Star #4 is for the crayons and brown paper ""tablecloth"". I am so easy to entertain.The atmosphere is casual but classier than a fast-food chain. At this location in the Quartier Latin, we often see groups of university students. It's not a quiet spot for date night but it's an affordable indulgence when you want some artery-clogging goodness. Service is a bit hit-and-miss. Food and drinks come promptly but it's sometimes a challenge go flag down the server for the bill or a refill on drinks."

I know it was brunch but I couldnt help but get myself one of their beers from a local brewery! Quebec is a light year ahead of Ontario in terms of beer, and I definitely enjoyed being able to get good beer just about everywhere.

The restaurant is spacious and cozy, the service is efficient and the servers maintain a friendly composition. Their french fries are made to perfection, yes... they are a little greasy on the outside but perfectly crispy and tender on the inside. I got the Mexican sauce to go with it, which was a good balance between sweet and spicy and is one of the few non-mayo based sauces. I also had the veggie burger, which tasted just about right. I enjoyed the entire meal, it hit the spot. Being a fan of Belgian beer, I would've liked to kick a few back, but I had already drank prior to going there, so I was set for the night. Maybe next time."

Although the place was pretty much dead with only a few patrons, we didn't care cause we were so hungry. Anyways the hot waitress seated us promptly. I'm not sure if it's Montreal but almost all of the waitress seems to be cute and hot at the same time. Anyways, the best thing about this place is the Poutine, it's basically french fries mixed with a smooth creamy texture gravy sauce added with bits and pieces of mozzarella cheese. It is absolutely to die for this dish. The burgers were pretty good too as the meat was tasty and the buns were a bit different than the usual sesame seed buns that Americans use.

St. Denis, being on the east side of the Main (St. Laurent Street) the staff is mostly French speaking - but they are incredibly accommodating and willing to speak as much English as they can.  Overall - nice bunch.Food: The burgers at Frite Alors are simply fabulous.  They come in a straw tray and are quite generous in their proportions.  These burgers also come with Frite Alors' famous fries and a choice of dipping mustard.  In fact, burgers aside, Frite Alors is often fun to visit simply for the fries!  Prices are reasonable, and this makes the place a definite bargain.Put it on your to do list!"
