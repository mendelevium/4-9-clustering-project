Now, one more can be added to the list: Bar Bara is the new kid on the block, but clearly no stranger to making great food. My boyfriend and I happened to walk by the night after they opened and decided to give them a try for dinner that night. We picked up the Focaccia of the day, Cacio e Pepe linguini and shell pasta with a lamb ragu as well as 2 corn muffins that looked lonely sitting on the pedestal on their own. The focaccia was INCREDIBLE and the pastas were delicious - I can only imagine they would be that much better served fresh. But what was truly surprising were the corn muffins that we had the next day for breakfast - a unique texture, not too sweet and with the addition of hazelnuts and raspberry jam in the centre added just the right amount of tartness and crunch.We enjoyed it so much that we returned the following night just to load up on more pastries! We wound up getting another corn muffin as well as what can only be described as a peach danish and - the greatest discovery of them all - a puff pastry filled with caramel. Again, not too sweet and, when reheated in the microwave for 15 seconds, made the caramel inside melt... too good.If they're this good with takeout, I can't wait to try them when they're open for dining."

I ordered some of their delicious plates for delivery including their polpettes, pasta, and their brownie dessert. I am happy to report that everything was just perfect! The order arrived perfectly assembled and still warm! The meatballs were the best part; I can't remember having hearty flavourful polpettes like these before. The tomato sauce was tangy and delicious. The pasta literally melted in your mouth; they surely did not skimp on the cheese and butter. As for the dessert, my regret was that I ran out of milk, cause that chocolate brownie was sinfully decadent and milk would have helped wash it down. Can't wait to check them out in person and discover some of their pantry staples too!"

Cool boho vibes and friendly staff. I had their famous vegetarian focaccia sandwich. It was absolutely delicious to the last bite. Extremely generous with a variety of grilled mushrooms, eggplant and cheese and other toppings wrapped in their in-house Â baked focaccia. Leaving my belly very satisfied.Definitely pass by and check them out! There's something for everyone and they are planning on having a terrace once the weather gets better so stay tuned ;-)"
