We were hanging out in Jeanne-Mance park and wanted a no fuss picnic so I called them up 20 min on advance with our order to have them warmed up and ready for pick-up. The gal who worked there is really nice and friendly despite being the only one managing the shop on a busy day.  They ran out of their popular steak and mushroom but honestly, they're all amazing. With the little pie holders, you can easily grab and eat on the go. We ordered the steak, bacon and cheese; the steak; the beef & cheese; the butter chicken; the steak, bacon & cheese; the classic beef and the mushy peas.  Favorite flavors were the butter chicken and the steak bacon & cheese. The kiddos really like the sweet mushy peas.  The crust has a hint of sweetness to it and is so buttery and satisfying. The filling is comparably good. You get chunks of steak in the filling! They taste and smell so good. It's like bakery meets hearty kitchen.Our friends enjoyed them so much, they asked me to grab them a bunch of frozen ones. Since it was a warm, sunny fall day, they had sold out of almost every popular flavor since people were spending time hanging out in the nearby park. The frozen ones are tax free so grab them for the next time you have a pie craving. You can also get Aussie or Kiwi goodies on the shelves. Definitely recommend you try this at least once!"

/user_details?userid=8HafK5cS8pWCWNQTIG8iJw,Uyen D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Tried these Australian pies for the first time today. After going through the other reviews I decided to go with beef & mushroom and butter chicken. I chose the hot individual pies but they also offer them cold or frozen. The pies were very good. The beef one was like a hearty stew inside a buttery flakey crust. The meat morsels were generous and tender. I preferred it to the butter chicken- even though the latter was still tasty I found the Indian flavours a bit tame.I can't wait to stock up my freezer with their pies now that I've had a taste. The store is small and cute, offering homemade desserts like caramel bars and passion fruit cookies as well.  There's a section filled with Australian snacks that I'd love to explore next time."

You bite into the crust, it smells like butter, flakes escape in the wind, the comforting flavor of rich beef stew fills your senses as the perfect dough gives way... Honestly, I couldn't get around how satisfying eating my first pie was! Which is why we immediately went back, 20 min later, to grab a larger one for dinner. Oh and one for the road. We had the Bifteck/Cheese, Lamb/Curry and Bifteck/Mushroom.The flavors of Bifteck/Cheese and Bifteck/Mushroom is very similar, as they share the same ""base"" stew.Can't wait to try the other kinds! This is a new, exciting addiction!"

I thought the Thai Curry was great but didn't go too well as a pie. The steak and mushroom had this amazing sauce with nice chunks of meat and mushroom but I felt like the meat lacked a bit of flavour.Overall, I've had better pies in England (yes, I'm aware that this is place is Australian lol), but this place was still great, and I would come back again if I were craving meat pies.The outside had a nice amount of flakiness with the inside having this nice, buttery, slightly chewy texture.I also like that they have a hot, refrigerated, and frozen section for pies to suit your needs.The staff was very pleasant as well."

/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow - Talk about great comfort food! These meat pies really hit the spot especially when the temperature outside starts to fall.I remember when I was in Australia years ago and tried out the sausage rolls and meat pies in Sydney and was not terribly impressed at the time. So when I heard this place opened up and saw kangaroo meat pies, I wasn't in a rush to try anything. That completely changed last night. Yes, it's well-known that this is one of Hugh Jackman's favorite spots whenever he's filming in Montreal and if you get the trio special (a small pie, a side and a drink), it is quite cheap and filling. And the sausage roll here is quite good. You can tell they use real butter in the crusts they make which encase these pies. Light, flakey and tasty. The fillings aren't short on flavor either.  With choices like Indian lamb or chicken curry pies, minced-meat pies, steak and mushroom pies, pies with meats, bacon and eggs, you'll eventually find one that you'll like. I bought a few small-sized frozen pies to take home and had the Ned Kelly mini-pie this morning for breakfast and I'm hooked. The family sized pies run about $18-$20 .Apparently they also have Aussie desserts like Pavlovas, but I saw the Sticky Date Pudding offered last night.They also sell Australian products on the side like vegemite, Tim Tam cookies as well as products that are more common in Commonwealth countries like Cadbury Flake chocolate bars. Yum."

They were nice, very safe, no outgoing flavors, just very safe, which I usually hate, but this was done fine.Bottom of the crust was a little under-cooked for both different days, though the rest of the dough crust was nice and pleasant.I don't think I would order something as chunky as the Nelly pie, because it was hard to cut into all those different big chunky pieces with a butter knife.The veg curry pie was nice, easy to eat, and very pleasant, didn't make me smell bad when I went back to work. I liked how salt was not it's main flavor, and I could taste other things."

We had a bit of a tasting day at the office, including the beef, curry, bacon, and more. All were quite tasty and packed with flavour. And the puff pastry was on point. The pies are pretty small, so you'll need around 1.5 per person. Unless you go with the lunch special, which includes a pie with a side (mushy peas are a must!) and drink. Keep room for dessert, as they have all kinds of Aussie specialties. If you're looking for a different and affordable lunch, I totally recommend this spot."

My boyfriend has had the mac and cheese and says it's the best he's ever had. I really want to try the milkshakes and the pastries soon!The service is always top notch. Friendly and helpful.

/user_details?userid=nyl_1VcRIAyI55bb_scpdw,Mary T.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"I went to Montreal to train fellow colleagues for a couple of days. After work on my final day, I decided to pull out my Yelp app and figure out where to go for dinner. I found this place, added the address to my GPS, and drove off. I love pies. I've never had an Aussie pie. I'm adventurous. When in Montreal... haha!I lucked out and got a parking spot right in front of the store. I went to pay for parking. The dispenser asked me to enter the parking number. I looked. I couldn't find it. I guess that parking was free, so I walked into the store. You can eat there. However, there are two tiny tables that are high like bar tables. Instead, I checked out the selection of pies and dessert. I was in heaven!The store sells warm pies. Perfect! I bought a couple and decided to spend a quiet night eating them in my hotel room, which had a kitchenette. I got the steak and mushroom, and steak and cheese pies. To go, I grabbed a twelve-pack of frozen sausage rolls. The woman asked if I had a cooler. My car always has a cooler. I guess that this fact alone proves that I am a foodie! I reassured her that my hotel room had a full fridge. I'd freeze the sausage rolls before driving back home. She seemed relieved. The woman at the counter was helpful and friendly. I paid by credit card and left. I returned to my hotel room and noticed how carefully the pies were wrapped. A cardboard insert protected them from any bumps. Each pie was carefully labelled in its own bag. It was a nice touch that was highly practical. I tore into the steak and mushroom pie. It was divine! The pastry was flaky and buttery. The pie filling was generous and delicious. I loved the mushrooms. They complemented the steak well. I then ate the steak and cheese. So good! It's comfort food wrapped into a neat, flaky pie. Yum!I haven't tried the sausage rolls yet, but they are safely in my freezer. I am going to guess that they are equally as yummy as the pies. When I'm back in Montreal, I need to add a pie run with my bagel run. What a wonderful gem of a place!(194)"

A little bit cramped on the inside but it's a good spot to go to for a quick bite.FOOD: Honestly, they have the best pies that I have ever tasted. Their lamb curry one is amazing. It's packed full of flavor, the meat is super tender and the crust isn't dry at all. Everything about it was to my liking and I would definitely come back to try their other flavors.PRICE: Price are inexpensive. The small pies are about 6-7$ (note that they are pretty small in size!) and the big pies are about 20$. Although I'd recommend getting the bigger pies, you won't regret it.SERVICE: The staff there is very friendly. We didn't know that we had to call ahead of time to get preheated pies so we waited at the restaurant for about 30 minutes (but we didn't mind at all).

/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Oh man that was some good pie.  I was hearing lots of good things about Ta Pies, a casual eatery specializing in Australian meat pies, so I was very curious to give it a go.  It's a tiny and unassuming shop on Parc Ave that packs a lot of punch.  In  addition to having meat pies they have vegetarian options and Australian desserts.  You can also buy frozen pies to take home and heat up later.They have a really good selection of pies so it was hard to narrow down my choices but ultimately I got a steak and cheese pie and I was happy I did.  In addition to a flaky, buttery crust the meat was very tender.  This was accompanied by a side of macaroni and cheese which was okay but not the best I have ever had.  Dessert was a yoyo, a kind of shortbread cookie sandwich with a passion fruit buttercream which was awesome.  I really enjoyed the passion fruit filling.In addition to serving excellent food they also have fantastic customer service.  The people who work here are super friendly and the woman who served me was good at making recommendations and helping me narrow down my choices.  They also very kindly replaced my mac and cheese free of charge when I accidentally knocked it onto the ground despite my offering to pay for a new one.  I appreciated that.The prices were very fair for the neighbourhood.  I paid about $15 total for all the food I ordered and a bottle of water which wasn't expensive at all when you consider the quality of the food and that you are in a neighbourhood like the Plateau.  Hugh Jackman had it right when he gave Ta Pies his endorsement.  It is awesome!"
/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Ta Pies definately deserves a 5 star rating! I recently tried out this wonderful gem located on Parc Avenue and was blown away by their tasty and flavor packed austrailian meat pies! The spot itself is small but they do have a small counter spots and outdoor terrace so you can eat there. The owner is super friendly and so helpful in explaining each of their pies. Now for the pies..brace yourself as they have so many wonderful pies to choose from...the most popular ones are the classic beef and butter chicken. They also have a wonderful curry vegetarian pie. My fav was the classic beef which was out of this world! One word..delicious!! All their pies come in individual portions or regular pie size and they have frozen ones which are perfect for takeout!  I truly recommend trying this spot at least once! Will definately go back!

We were not as easily impressed as Wolverine.Ta Pies is a tiny spot. We received the offer of two pies from the hot case for the price of one since they were closing in less than an hour after we arrived.No one loved the food. The kids had the classic beef pie filled with (shocker!) ground beef. The husband and I shared the veggie pie with sweet potato curry. It was fine. We waited 20 minutes for them to warm up the butter chicken pie. That was the best of the bunch, but still not worth a return visit.We ended our meal with an Afghan cookie and a Lammington to go but they were pretty unremarkable."
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I'm giving this place a 4.5/5 rounded up! Even at 4AM on a Wednesday (don't ask me why I'm up this late), I still salivate whenever I think about Ta Pies' absolutely delectable pies and side dishes. Although there is not much in terms of ambience at this location, the deliciousness of the food makes up for that by all means. As I've mentioned before, I'd rather have crappy ambience and amazing food rather than vice versa.I ordered the steak, bacon, and cheese pie in a combo with a side of mac and cheese and a drink. In addition, I also got a Lamington for a dessert since I never had one before and wanted to try something new. As soon as I cut into the pie, I was met with a waft of the most savory aroma and the crinkle of what appeared to be good-quality pastry. Every mouthful of meaty, smoky, and cheesy goodness made me crave for more, and it was surprisingly cheap for a nice steak-based meal. Combined with the tomato sauce in the filling, you really cannot get it any better than that. The mac and cheese, despite my initial doubts over how it seemed more watery than I would normally prefer, was still cheesy and had a bit of a kick to it as a result of the addition of certain vegetables, and the breadcrumbs on top were the perfect accent to a classic comfort food. The Lamington, in my opinion, was a bit drier than I would've liked it to be, but then again I did go in the evening when there were only three of them left on display. I did enjoy, however, the combination of chocolate, raspberry (?) jam, and coconut that surrounded the outside, so I can only imagine how good it would have tasted had the cake been more moist.Overall, Ta Pies is a great place to go to if you want a cheap but definitely filling meal that is somewhat rare to find outside of its home continent. Who knows? I might stop by in the near future to grab some frozen pies to bring back home with me..."

This was their poutine (OK, this and maybe fish&chips) - cheap, filling, and available everywhere (literally - even gas stations stocked these in heaters, but you never knew how long it was sitting there...). The Mtl version is great - not as dirt cheap as the original - but of good quality, and still quite affordable.

We talked to the owner who told us these are gourmet pies, house-made puff pastry made only with New Zealand butter, which she told us does not at all compare to fast-food hand pies in Australia. I had a lamb roganjosh, hubby had curried vegetable, plus we had a side of roasted veggies. Lunch for two about $17. This is outrageously good food at a cheap price. Highly recommend!!! Follow up: we decided to not forgo dessert: Lamington cake, a sponge cake with raspberry filling, dipped in chocolate, rolled in flaked coconut for me, Afghan cookie for hubby, which is dark chocolate and corn flakes, topped with chocolate ganache and half a walnut. Both were marvelous, a fabulous end to a wonderful meal. Total price $27 for lunch and dessert, a bargain!"

/user_details?userid=cD_hpkvErXCyQHBQzv8KYQ,Atif I.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"No place in Montreal captured my heart quite like Ta Pies did.Ta Pies is an Australia/NZ influenced bakery that focuses on a really well defined value proposition: present traditional ANZ comfort food with a more contemporary interpretation at an extremely affordable price. It's a very tightly run ship and the first time I went there one of the owners excused herself as I debated between all the temptations in front of, and around me, to run into the kitchen and put a batch of Anzac biscuits (rolled oats, coconut, and golden syrup) into the oven. Hey, I like that they're focused on controlling overheads: it will keep prices down.I truly had no idea what I was getting into. I'd heard about the popularity of the meat pies down under and so requested the Butter Chicken (served with a side of, somewhat boring, mashed potatoes) to be heated up. Contrary to most other bakeries that reheat in a manner that detracts from the enjoyment, this one was done to the exact second where it was piping hot as I cut into the pie, but the exterior hadn't been made soggy by the moisture. As I had my first slice, I realized that what was inside was actually an Indian chicken curry (with tomato, yoghurt, and ginger). Completely unexpected, even if the name should have tipped me off. I actually found the combination fascinating: much superior to any ""Dum Pukht"" interpretation in Indian dishes (that cook the meat inside a layer of bread) given the crispy, flaky, buttery exterior of the pie, and the distinct layers of pastry dough. Fantastic! There are many options spanning: steak sausage, beef, bacon, lamb... you must definitely try the meat pies. I'm glad I did, despite Hugh Jackson's ringing endorsement ;)No meal is complete without dessert and so I was curious to try as much as I could from their unique desserts. It was a hot day and so the owner recommended: Hokey Pokey ice cream (vanilla ice cream with small lumps of honeycomb toffee). I tried it a few days later and thought it was ok. I didn't understand why it would be so popular in NZ till i researched and realized that many New Zealanders remember making hokey pokey in science at school to ""observe the dramatic chemical changes when baking soda is mixed with golden syrup and sugar"". Fair enough, I can respect nostalgia.Instead I had two delightful desserts: the Lamington (vanilla sponge cake filled with raspberry jam, dipped in chocolate and rolled in coconut) and the Afghan (dark chocolate cookie with corn flakes). Both were 5 star experiences with an interesting twist: the Lamington, an Australian specialty cake traced back to 1900 (and amusingly discovered in 2014 to have actually been invented earlier in NZ as ""Wellington""!) was extremely light, soft, and moist. The Afghan cookie (the origin of whose name is still a mystery and could end up being controversial in coming years) had all kinds of interesting plays happening with the chocolate cookie and the dark chocolate icing with the walnut adding a texture element to it - till a few seconds into eating it you realized another gravel-like consistency in it: thanks to the addition of corn flakes into the baking mix.As I turned to leave and had a good conversation with the owner, she inquired how I'd heard of them. Yelp, I replied and she beamed at all the glowing reviews here. I couldn't figure out the name, was it short for good bye, as in Ta Ta? No, she said. It's slang down under for ""Thanks a lot"".Ta, then... (4.5 stars, rounded up)"
/user_details?userid=3mRdO02gSlFZfjNqNRawsg,Brandon Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,The person in the front was super nice and I got my food quick. The Ned Kelly is quite tasty but not really a fan of the baked egg on the inside. I think a soft boiled or poached egg would have been FAR superior because it would have oozed out into the surrounding pie and presented an even better flavor. The Mac and Cheese was also good. Would come back to sample  the other pies.
/user_details?userid=u140UcK66QZWCWTpawz5Pg,Amy B.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"4.5/5It was a pleasant and welcome surprise that we happened by Ta Pies after the restaurant we'd originally planned to go to for lunch was closed for the entire week (with little notice). I say their loss and our absolute gain! Walking down avenue du Parc towards Mont Royal, I recognized Ta Pies from a long time ago, having previously bookmarked it in my head (but inevitably forgetting about it, as one would expect). I wouldn't have bookmarked it in my head if it wasn't good, so I told my partner, hey, why not? We were due for a big dinner before 6, so what seemed like a casual, light lunch seemed like a really good idea.The space is small and packed! First impression, let's see - the owners have accents from the land down under; Milo & Tim Tams are for sale; plus Hugh Jackman is in a picture (with the owners) on the wall. Yup, it's as authentic as they come! My partner and I had the following warm single-portioned pies to start: the butter chicken, which packed plenty of meat and is currently my partner's favourite; and the steak and mushroom (which is less flavourful than the butter chicken and a bit drier, but still delicious in its own right). Because the space is pretty tight - we had to wait a bit before we got a spot, and even when we did end up seated by the bar seats near the entrance, we had to make sure we weren't blocking anybody (to the washroom in the back). In that sense, it's probably best to take these pies to go.For around $7 a pie, they were pretty filling and definitely good value. The pie crust is light and buttery & the filling packs a punch in flavour! Pretty damn good pies! We were sorry we didn't have a cooler in the back to take some of the frozen pies back home to Ottawa (a mistake we won't make again, I assure you), so we did the next best thing.We took out another two pies to go: another butter chicken and the lamb rogan josh, which is my personal favourite (as it has a bit of a kick, but not too spicy). It didn't end up being a ""light"" lunch, but it sure was tasty! No regrets; we'll be back (and with a cooler next time!)"

Following other reviews, we called in advance so they could be heated, but one additional tip: you can probably call 30 minutes in advance for the personal size pies we got, but for the larger family size, they need more notice in order to have it baked and hot and ready by the time you get there.We also got dessert: one ""passion fruit yoyo"", which is two layers of passion fruit pastry with cream in between, and one ""afghan,"" a cookie with walnut, dark chocolate ganache, and corn flakes. Both were excellent.Definitely go there while in town."

I thought that my steak and mushroom pie was missing something, it was just a little bland. Maybe adding cheese would have helped! Regardless, both pies had buttery, flaky crusts. One pie each was a satisfactory lunch for the two of us, making Ta Pies a good bang for your buck. The shop is pretty tiny, but is decorated nicely. A must-visit lunch option while in Montreal."

Enough pieces of cubed meat and that dark sauce.... mmmm, didn't bother to check what else they put in there because was too busy enjoying the perfect balance of this pie.

They have fresh and frozen varieties and single serving pies from $5.00-6.50 or giant family pies for averaging $15. With a salad or soup on the side it would have been a filling, comforting meal. On it's own a nice, hearty snack!They also have a great selection of sweets including this cake that I was told was Hugh Jackman's favorite when he was in town shooting Wolverine. A very light sponge cake (not too sweet) called a ""LAMINGTON"" with a bit of jam and dipped in chocolate/coconut. It might sound odd but it was SOOOO GOOD.

More of a store front for taking out pies that can be either bought fresh or frozen than it is a restaurant. Have excellent pies, and claim to be the best anywhere as per Hugh Jackman. Ordered an original beef and cheese, as well as the lamb which had a curry type sauce. Added sides of mushy peas and mashed potatoes, both with gravy. These were clearly microwaved and slightly below proper temp. The pies had a wonderful flakey pastry on the outside. Both had great tasty fillings, but the lamb one was special. Great flavour. My issue here was both had very little actual meat. Because of this, make sure to order a side of gravy and mushy peas to eat with. Really complimented the pies. The mashed potatoes on the other hand were sub par, and rather low on flavour. Didn't really taste like potato due to being microwaved I imagine. Would eat here again, but these aren't the best. Peaked Pies in Vancouver are significantly better, for example. Still, a tasty comfort food for lunch."

Mine steak/cheese, and hers a vegetarian. And they were lovely. The pastry was super yummy just like good Aussie pies, and filling was good too. Not exactly the same (not better/worse, just different) but still really nice.I'll definitely stop here every now and then for a casual pie to go as I walk through the park down to Sherbrooke.(Note: Australian pies etc aren't ""cuisine"" in Australia, they're just a common fast food, like poutine.

/user_details?userid=voDqNNoB-9KLlczLhRqStA,Kylie P.,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"Being Australian its hard not to have mixed expectations for a pie shop selling Aussie cuisine.Aussie pies are hard to beat and TA succeeds fairly well at nailing the Aussie meat pie. There is a wide variety of flavours many of which I have never seen in oz like Butter Chicken but still taste amazing whilst nailing the flaky pastry. We purchased the Steak, Bacon and Cheese; Butter Chicken and the Shephards pie varieties. I enjoyed them all although my bf was a little disappointed with the shephards pie.TA also sells a variety of Aussie desserts including Pavlova and Rum Balls. I decided to purchase a Tim Tam Meringue which I was fairly disappointed in as the whole pie crust was burnt and quite hard to bite into so I wouldn't recommend purchasing them.Overall it is a fairly good representation of some typical Aussie food that can be a little expensive at $5-6 for a pie but well worth a try if just to get my Aussie food fix."

C'était agréable, car en soirée la rue n'est pas extrêmement passante. ---These little meat pies are tasty. I tried the lamb and curry and also the steak and cheese pies. Salad was fresh. There's a wide variety of meat pies, and desserts look good. Service is fast and friendly. The place is small and the decor is too basic, but there is a patio outside by Avenue du Parc, where we ate.

/user_details?userid=ZNJJNS5VKwyKkpuAkvrMaA,Shannah K.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"As an Australian I was excited to find this gem when visiting Montreal. And wow it did deliver! I left feeling like I'd been back home for a little while. Here's why:- I had the classic beef pie, and possibly the best meat pie I've ever had. The pastry was amazing and surpassed that of pastries in Australia, perhaps the french influence. Tomato sauce and some Australian brand chutneys were freely available.- My boyfriend noted the pies are surprisingly filling for $5-6 each.- They can show you how to do a Tim-tam slam, for those interested in Aussie culturalisms.- They offer 'lemon lime and bitters', an Aussie mixer drink that trust me, is pretty hard to find in north America.- The girl at the counter has worked as a barista in Australia, and the quality of the coffee really reflects this.- The traditional sticky date pudding was great, but difficult to chose from the several dessert options including pavlova and Tim-tam tiramisu.- When buying a take-home pie for later, I noticed the bill pleasantly reflected that advertised prices included tax - not sure if this was the same for our eat-in meal. The take-home pie was also amazing.This place will be on my radar for every time I return to Montreal, and really shouldn't be missed. If you're an expat missing home, or interested in seeing what real Australian food is, this place is a must."

I stopped by TA on the way to the park and was pleasantly surprised, actually impressed. Anyone familiar with New Zealand and Australian meat pies will have high expectations, like I did, when seeing a sign outside this semi-whole-in-the-wall spot advertising meat pies. TA delivered ... very hot and very fresh, which is the opposite of a complaint, just difficult to wait for it too cool sufficiently before eating. The pastry crust was PERFECT and the fillings delicious.    The space is small, very small, and definitely not a dinner destination or for a meal of any great length. I'll reiterate, if you're familiar with how things work in NZ and Australia and how to order and eat meat pies, there's no surprises aside from being 100% satisfied with the food. I'll be back ... soon"

We discovered this place a week after our trip to New Zealand, and we have not looked back. It's a great place to get a mince pie, or my favourite a mince and cheese. The business is run by a husband(Don) and wife(Melanie). Don having been a professional chef in New Zealand and later Australia,met Melanie and they married and moved to Montreal. The pies made using local ingredients, and come very very close to the pies of Russel or Lake Taupo NZ!They have a large variety of pies that you can take home frozen. Either individual or family size.  Often they have specials, such as a pie of the week or a baker's dozen promotion. The frozen pies also transport very well. Putting them in a cooler bag or small cooler box we were able to give some to my cousin in Calgary who married a Kiwi. He gave his approval of them. They also make great flat whites, and are not too expensive.On weekends Don will usually have a rugby or Aussie rules football game on the TV.In the summer time they have a pie eating contest - I believe the current record is 8.5 pies in ten minutes."

A friend did research where to eat and find this place! Ta Pies is great for all things pies and desserts! They sell Australian products like Tim Tam (the best!), Vegemite, Milo, etc. They also have Tim Tam Homemade ice cream which is divine! Best thing ever created. So, friends and I were there to take out and bring back to our hotel. The lovely lady at the counter said a whole pie would take 35 minutes to be ready, which was fine with us. She was very nice and explain to us what each pie was and what tim tams were and how to eat them (even though I already knew). After 10 minutes of deciding, or what felt like 10 minutes, we got a spinach and cheese pie. The place is quite small, you can eat inside or outside on the patio. We went to the park that was a block away instead of waiting inside the shop. I think she was waiting for us cause the pie was under the heat lamp. She gave us a bag, plates, and forks. Onto the actual food tasting, the crust looked so crumbly with buttery goodness! It was great. It was definitely a different type of dough crust that I'm used to. It wasn't flaky, but it a couple layers. I really liked it. Lots of filling to go with it too. Very filling."

The sweet potato curry and classic potato top get honourable mentions, too. Finishing off the meal with a TimTam Tiramisu adds something really unique and decadent to the whole experience, too.

I would've loved to try the curry meat pie though). It is pretty good; I like it with ketchup on top, but they have other condiments on the side for you before you sit down in one of their high chairs (there are only a couple tables).

The pie portion looked small, but was actually very reasonable. The lentil soup turned out to be more of a chili (it was so thick we could eat it with a fork), but was nevertheless very flavourful with a touch of spiciness. The other pies were tried were equally as great, with a consistently good crust and tasty fillings. Great place, definitely want to try some desserts next."

Their fillings are juicy and their crust sufficiently crisp and easy to break into without leaving that dry taste in your mouth. I've tried their classic meat pies, the vegetable curry, and the beef and mushoom. They're all good. I just wish that the pies were bigger because one is definitely not enough for a meal. For a more authentic feel, have your pies with mash and gravy on top. It's fun to eat and tastes wonderful. The place is tiny, so go there on a nice sunny day and enjoy your pie at Jeanne-Mance park."
