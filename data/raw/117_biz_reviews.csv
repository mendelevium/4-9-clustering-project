I ordered a platter for 2 and it came with brisket, ribs, beef rib, chickens and other side condiments. The quality of bbq hit the spot. Server amazing lady. Very professional, charming and making sure we all were well fed there. Price seem to be higher I hear but for 2 we spent 100 Canadian dollars and we were extremely happy not only by the quality foods but also the outstanding service. Defiantly eating American Foods in Montreal again"
/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I'm from Georgia and always looking for good bbq. I haven't tried too many in Montreal , but Rubs is definitely the best of the ones that I have. The meat is smoky, flavorful and moist like it should be. The sauces are good, although they have said that they're out of the Carolina sauce both times I've been there which was disappointing as Carolina sauce is my favorite kind. The Texas platter is a great deal. It gives you a good bit of ribs, brisket, pulled pork and chicken . I don't normally get chicken at a BBQ place because it could never be as good as the pork/beef options but their chicken is not dry and pretty tasty. The brisket needs a little salt for me but I like my food pretty salty. Pulled pork is solid and the ribs are good as well. Service varies a lot depending on how busy they are, but the waiters are always friendly. We were surprised at how much we liked this place and will certainly continue to come back."

The fries and the sauces were also sublime. - Good prices: 15$ for the ribs and 15$ for the fried chicken - Nice view when sitting by the window: optimal conditions for people watching Cons:- ???????"

/user_details?userid=LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"$15 rib special on Sundays. We sat on the terrace and each had a beer and split the plate. Sauce was great, food came super quick, bartender and busboy were friendly (although lackluster knowledge of the menu offerings). Not a place you'll go to eat vegetables but a great local BBQ option. I look forward to a football Sunday beer with the boys here."

We were craving tasty BBQ ribs so came here for dinner on Friday.  The ribs and cocktails were good but baffulo chicken tacos were too dry and salty. All meals were with huge portion of fries.

Both were great and under $10.We ordered the mac&cheese appetizer, which has 5 different kinds of cheese but was a little to starchy. We decided to order the special #poutineweek poutine with 14 hour smoked and braised brisket, fried onions, bbq sauce and avocado & cilantro mayo. Was not disappointed.Our food arrived very quickly even if the place was FULL. Waitress was sweet but obviously very busy. I will clearly go again to try their ribs."

The place is spacious enough to host large groups and they serve delicious fried chicken and ribs! If you're craving Southern food, you should definitely check this place out. They have beers, cocktails and all kinds of yammy goodness to choose from on their menu. Their service is friendly and atmosphere is relaxing, so yes, I'll be coming here next time I crave fried chicken."
/user_details?userid=VseHlPAVhHbNZqyl_zRKBQ,Stephanie C.,"Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of the best BBQ smokehouse joints in Montreal! I came here for dinner with some friends, craving for some bbq! They have a huge variety to choose from in their menu, and you get to choose 2 side dishes with your plate. We decided to get some st-louis ribs, beef brisket, fried chicken, blooming onion and poutine. The ribs and beef brisket were delicious - perfectly seasoned and sauce, and cooked perfectly the meat falls off the bone. Their fried chicken as well was crispy, well seasoned and juicy! Their blooming onion was tasty and perfect for sharing. However, their fries and poutine were good but nothing amazing. As for the service, our waitress was great and we received our food pretty quick! Overall, the service and the food were very good! The prices were decent, and the portions were very generous. If you're looking for a bbq joint, this place is definitely worth a try!"
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It's the third time I have been to Rubs. Last time, my husband and I grabbed a quick dinner, a pulled pork sandwich. This time we had onion blossom as appetizer, a half rack (pork) + pulled pork combo and half rack of beef rib.Food: the onion blossom is a must try. I never tried it before. My local friends neither, they all thought it was fries by seeing the photo. My American friends know this dish very well and told me it is very common in southern BBQ restaurants.  This dish is enough for 3 people to share. The beef rib is amazing, very tender inside and with beef jerky like outside. The pork rib is a little bit dry but also tasty. You can taste the smoker flavor in the dish.Price wise: this place a sandwich with a side is around 15$. Half beef rib is 25$ (35$ for a full rack). Price may be considered a little bit higher than a regular BBQ restaurant, given the size of the dish. However, they advertise they don't have micro-wave or freezer in their kitchen to provide a fresh ingredient. If this is real, it may increase their cost for sure.  Also the design of menu and the decoration of the restaurant are very nice. The price of beer is very reasonable."
/user_details?userid=lgEjGcwq1Ze6y17lP5lqcA,Stephen A.,"Durham, NH",4 star rating,"It's a sad fact of how bad food is in New Hampshire where I live that you get better American food in a foreign country. I know of no good BBQ in New Hampshire but here in Montreal I found some. Good ribs. I liked the sauce, good cracklings texture without being dry. Good fries as well. Also far better poutine than in the states but that is to be expected. Didn't get a perfect five stars because the slaw was mediocre and the chocolate covered bacon dessert while good, had a ratio of chocolate to bacon about 4/1 which made it nearly impossible to taste the bacon. Good service. Johnny on the spot with the water refills. Kept us hydrated. And we got to watch curling."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"Food is quality for sure, and the vibe is super friendly! The two George's who own this place are hilarious guys, big personalities, big loud laughs, and smart business people who have worked super hard to turn their hobby and passion for barbeque into a life for them and their families. As someone who doesn't eat meat anymore, I sometimes avoid this place because the memories of the brisket, the huge ribs, the delicious sauce, the generous and delicious mountains of food cuts me right me to my green little heart and nearly breaks my resolve. When I do go, it's because I'm in the area early when it's quiet, I can dig into a crazy delicious spicy ghost pepper Ceasar and have a chat in a classic cozy brick bar ambiance away from the hustle on St Laurent and Prince Arthur. If you are in the area and hungry and wonder if you will be well taken care of here, the answer is yes, every little thing is gonna be alright."
/user_details?userid=iJ_sn6RfwO5unR9YgFTd4Q,Camille R.,"Côte-des-Neiges, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I ordered take out so it might affect the quality of the food since it doesn't arrive right away. I had their classic poutine and the portobello mushroom burger. The poutine was very average nothing special. Good sauce and decent amount of cheese but I wouldn't go back for it. The piece de resistance was definitely the burger. WOW. This burger is so tasty and perfect. I would make a detour for this burger. The patty is thick and just enough rare inside. Perfect burger. Next time I'd like to go to the actual restaurant and try more things.
/user_details?userid=FHMww6j1cAwyTlFpXsFyog,Fenn N.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,Pretty solid bbq place. We had trouble figuring out the parking situation so we parked on the street few blocks away (don't think the lot next to the restaurant is permitted parking). We got a shared ribs and brisket plate. Came out pretty fast and the flavors were great. Drinks were pretty tasty too.

/user_details?userid=BhQYYPy1ekYNkSx068wkOg,Kevin A.,"New York, NY",1 star rating,"I've made many mistakes in my life and walking into this place is one of them.Mac and Cheese: My friend and I both ordered a side of mac and cheese and we literally got macaroni ""AND"" cheese. Look at the picture. The cheese was not incorporated with the macaroni at all. Just because you put a cheese blanket on macaroni doesn't make it mac and cheese! Some parts were not even melted. You can see the grated chunk.Texas brisket: It took forever to get this good looking brisket with fries and coleslaw. BUT, it just looks better than it tastes. This meat is dry. I don't care how many hours they claimed to have braised. It lacks the succulent and juicy texture that I was expecting from BBQ. When the meat is this boring, at least you need to put out good sauces to cover up. There was only one available which tasted like soy sauce. Having been to other BBQ joints, I was expecting other kinds of sauces like BBQ sauce, spicy, bourbon, etc. By the time I finished the meat, I felt so gross. It's the kind of feeling you get when you eat too much greasy food. I am not even sure what was in the coleslaw, but it was definitely not cabbage.Service: -100 stars. We almost wasted 2 hours at this place, not because we enjoyed staying here so much, but because it took forever to get the food. Our appetizer mac and cheese didn't come out until after 20 minutes of waiting. The main food didn't come out for another good 30 minutes. To get the bill, we waited another good 20 minutes. To get the credit card machine, we waited forever again. Not a single person came by to check on us over the course of the meal. If a weekday dinner service is like this, I can't even imagine what it's like during weekends."
/user_details?userid=hBADi4exXG7eTd90WKwQjw,Eric L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I came here for a Yelp Elite event ~1.5 yrs ago and sampled a lot of their food, which was all spectacular. I took my family to dinner and our original option was closed, so thankfully I remembered how amazing this place was and decided to bring them here!The food is just spectacular. I had the baby back ribs and fried chicken platter, with sides of macaroni salad (solid) and baked beans (surprisingly great and tasty). The ribs alone were phenomenal and make the entire dish worth 5 stars, but the rest of the meal was also very good. Next time I'll be sticking with just the ribs, however, as I wasn't a huge fan of the fried chicken (a bit bland and didn't sit too well). Relative to the portions, everything was quite well priced; I normally eat a lot but I had to take home 1/3 of my meal cause I was too full!The service was fast and polite, although the restaurant wasn't too busy since we got there early and it was quite cold outside. I imagine it could be different on a busier day, but for us the service was just fine.The atmosphere is splendid! I love the decor and vibe of the restaurant, it's like a hybrid of homey and classy, and it's a really great place for a family dinner or a date. Location is also very accessible, and the music isn't too loud so you can still have a conversation.Overall:Food: 9/10 (ribs 10/10)Service: 9/10Atmosphere: 9.5/10Portions: 9.5/10I will definitely be keeping this place in mind as one of my favorite food places near my house!"

Classic bar with sports playing on TVs.FOOD: Honestly, I've had better. The food wasn't bad, I just think I can find better elsewhere. I would definitely not recommend the Mac n Cheese... It was flavorless and was just not worth it. It felt like they took pasta has been left out and just attempted to melt cheese on it in a microwave. The ribs are good though, however, like I said, I can find better tasting ribs elsewhere.PRICE: The prices are standard but what's nice is that they have specials for students. Even with the specials, I don't think I will be coming back.SERVICE: The staff was ok, they did their jobs but it wasn't the best experience I've had."

/user_details?userid=vhkFvcr8z1qhWKR1eR2YZw,Bonnie C.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,As a big fan of barbecue this place is highly overrated. Americans should not try this restaurant because it is basically a chain with average barbecue dishes. No cornbread or greens either.
/user_details?userid=0w14hHqQs4kLGwS5su-_WA,Sara J.,"Dover, NJ",5 star rating,"We decided to order a sampler platter and split it, it was almost too much food... literally a mountain of meat. 4 ribs, chicken leg quarter, decently thick slice of brisket, a pile of pulled pork and three small sized sides. Everything was delicious but specifically the ribs stood out for me, usually i can take it or leave it but these were perfect. The sides we had were the Mac & cheese which was exactly what I expected, the Cole slaw was unusual for me but good (did not have a white sauce) had a little kick to it, and last but certainly not least the creamy corn salad. Woah. Was not expecting what was in it but holy hell was it good. The fresh dill was a nice accoutrement. Would certainly be back the bbq was great and the service matched, thanks again!"

/user_details?userid=vGohRKrqPgCJak3Jp6nGMA,Thalya L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Rubs,I am not one to be extremely difficult, however I was accompanied by a very simple eater. We both left unsatisfied by you. We ordered the following:Appetizers - Smoked mac and cheese, Jalapeno peppers, Fried battered wingsMain -Brisket sandwich with coleslaw and spicy fries, Deep fried ribs and a side of poutineDrinks- Pitcher Rubs lemonade (I think) and 2 shotsOur waiter Phil was a gem. Our appetizers came relatively fast, I am not going to lie everything looked so delish, but once I took a bite of a wing it was just completely tasteless. It was fried to perfection,but sadly  bland .  The mac and cheese cheesy top was yummy, but the more I ate, it lacked of that special taste I expected. I mean I've had, and tasted way better than this. I didn't make a big fuss because maybe it was just a question of personal taste. The Jalapeno peppers were okay, since they were wrapped in bacon then fried in batter, the bacon was a bit undercooked. I only ate 1 as I couldn't stand the sweet after taste that came after. I asked our waiter to put the rest in a take away box.The main took more than 50 minutes to come, totally ridiculous. We waited so long that we were not too eager to eat. Yes the waiter came and apologized by saying that they had many big groups. I understood but it was a long wait. We arrived around 8PM and our main arrived at 10:20ish NOT OKAY.People that were seating next to us ordered after and received their meals why did we have to wait?????Our mains were way better, the brisket sandwich was sooooo good. The spicy fries were not spicy at all, but had great potential. Overall for me my main course was a winner. As for my company he loved his meal too, everything was to his liking. We were both full so most of our mains were brought home.As for the lemonade it was okay, not a big fan , but since it was not all about me I had to choose something we could both enjoy! To me it was not worth 30$ Our bill was over 124$ (rough estimation) Verdict - My appetizers were not the greatest, but the mains were delish. The wait time tarnished my experience. They could have at least offered something for the inconvenience.  Yes I would go again, I do want to try other items and give them another chance."

In my defense, I saw it and had to try it. I wanted to know if Canada could make good BBQ. The menu had a sampling of different types of American BBQ. I was impressed. They even had the Alabama white sauce. That's difficult to find in some areas of the US. Let's start with what I drank. I had Rub's Bloody Caesar, spicy. I'll be honest. I had never heard of this drink before visiting Montreal. Read about it. You'll be surprised by the ingredients. Anyway, I love anything spicy. But, this drink was over the top spicy. I had trouble finishing it. I also ordered the Smoked Beef Ribs. They were awesome. It reminded me of Kansas City BBQ. All together, I was impressed. Canada can do BBQ."

This place was right around the corner from where I was staying so I decided to give it a try. The food selection was good everything was smoked BBQ style which I like so I was excited. I decided to go with the chicken strips and I was glad I did. Chicken fingers were crispy and juicy. Excellent. My boyfriend got the Memphis wings with the spicy fries and smoked beans. The Memphis sauce on them give them a hint of BBQ. The wings aren't crispy which is what we are used to in NYC but they were good.

The first time I went was when it had just opened, so I cut them some slack. However, I went back last night hoping they would have improved and it honestly got worse. I was with 3 other people and only 1 of us truly enjoyed our meal. I ordered the mac & cheese donuts to start, and they were cold, bland and tough. The sauce they came with was great though. I got the pop corn chicken poutine as my meal, and despite being hungry I couldn't even finish it because it was drowning in sauce and the fries became so soggy they weren't edible. They advertise it as ""a little bit spicy"" but it was so hot I couldn't eat it towards the end. They also ran out of fried ribs which someone in our group was so excited to try, and the jalapeño popper starter was also average. Won't go back."

They have a special on Babyback ribs, $10 discount on a full rack, really good deal.Ordered the blooming onion as an appetizer. Tasty but very, very greasy. I know, I know it's deep fried but the grease pool at the bottom of our plates was a bit much.My wife had the Pulled chicken sandwich - she loved it.We had the ribs with fries and beans......I have to say they were some of the best ribs we have ever eaten. The meat was spectacular, smokey and tender and not too much sauce. Well cooked, grilled and fresh and wow delicious. The fries and beans were also top, top notch.The only reason I'm giving the 3 star rating is because the music was WAY TOO LOUD. Ridiculous. It's Sunday night dinner and not Friday night at 11:00 and the music was thumping .... boom, boom, boom. A total turn off. I love music..... not when it's blasting top 40 at nightclub levels. Is this a restaurant or a night club? We were sitting in the side dining room, ground floor and the bar area was even worse - huge speakers blaring away.I politely asked them to turn the music lower and only got the palms up shoulder shrug.The food is a 5 star, the noisy ambiance not so much."

Thank you RUBS for participating :) I ordered only the special Poutine and was not disappointed!  The combo of coriander lime sauce with the smoked meat balanced things out from getting too heavy. The presentation was great. And the smoke meat blended in well with the fries and gravy   Their Mac n cheese hits the spot if you've got a craving for cheesy goodness with a nicely broiled top layer. The Southwest Salad, Alabama was generous but quite tangy. The vinegar was very sour especially at the bottom which generated quite a pucker  of course, no one really goes to RUBS to eat salad so they're excused for not acing the veggies.  One of us ordered the RUBS combo brisket and it's enough meat for another meal. Brisket is tender enough but really dark in some places.  We went during a very cold weekday lunch so the place was quiet but normally it's much louder, especially on game nights :)"
/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"OK, this is easily the best American BBQ in Montreal now.Came in after a whole week of rain and needed comfort food. After finding out their fried chicken is one of the best in the city, I made up my mind to come in and see if all the hype is real.It is.Seriously, after looking at the menu and the piles of food going by me to other customers, I was torn between ribs and fried chicken. Dimitri, my server offered that I could have both by ordering one plate and pay by the piece of the other. So that did it, I ordered BBQ beef ribs and a piece of the fried chicken. I should say that what I got was A RIB, not ribs, the thing was massive and the amount of meat on it rivaled any steak I've had. It reminded me of the kinds of ribs Fred and Barney would chow down on in the Flintstones cartoon. The meat was practically falling off the bone, the top was crusted and inside all the BBQ sauce had somehow been absorbed. I did not mind for a second throwing my tables manners out the window and looking like Conan the Barbarian, because it was that good. The fried chicken was also fantastic and I intend on ordering a full plate next time.Fries, coleslaw and other sides were average. The Bloody Mary was great and Dimitri is a great server.Because my rib was so big, I barely made a dent into it and they were more than happy to wrap it up and allow me to take it home which was cool.I'm coming back with some more carnivore friends."

Me and a couple friends were walking about trying to find a spot to eat late night, about 9:30 pm. Saw they had a deal for a half rack of St Louis ribs, fries, and slaw for $10. It was all great. Cant wait to be back."
/user_details?userid=3mRdO02gSlFZfjNqNRawsg,Brandon Y.,"Brooklyn, NY",2 star rating,"I thought the BBQ would be good but tbh, it's really bad.  I ordered the brisket with baked beans and smoked Mac and cheese. The brisket didn't have enough fat, wasn't that tender, and had almost no flavor. The baked beans are fine but the Mac and cheese was SUCH a letdown. They said it was smoked Mac and cheese so I was expecting an undertone of it or something but it wasn't even decent mac. The macaroni itself has absolutely no flavor and the only indication of cheese seems to be the part melted on top of it. I'm adding a star because my server was honestly such a sweetie but the main part is the food, which turned out to be such a disappointment. If people think this is good BBQ, I'm sorry but I have a news flash for you. You're missing out on real, authentic mouthwatering BBQ."

I have been here twice for their Sunday baby back ribs special and I cannot say enough good things about it.  The staff is warm and friendly, the meal came out super fast and it is a great place to spend a Sunday with friends. The outdoor searing is expected to be ready by next week which will only make things even better."
/user_details?userid=c16uY76xYgSUEPWYXeWOgw,Sami C.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Disgusting. That sums it up. Fries were undercooked (we threw them out... Times 3 portions), while the chicken tacos I got were subpar - the shells were undercooked. They were softer than hard, when they should have been harder. On top of things, I got three small tacos with barely anything in them for $13. Suffice it to say I had to make food afterwards.I didn't understand why I got fries with tacos and rice (a very small container). The food they offered with the main dishes made no sense. In fact I completely forgot about the rice. Who eats rice with tacos???As for the brisket and chicken wings, they were alright. Nothing to write home about.All in all, way too expensive for food that was all in all disgusting."

I gotta say, just tried out their fried chicken tonight for the first time and it was, most probably, the best fried chicken I've ever had. It just gets expensive, even though we share a meal for two people. Great place if you're in the mood for BBQ food.  The beef rib is delicious with a side of mac and cheese. Food is so good and offers a little something for everyone. Sweet pulled pork, spicy and smoky brisket that is always served with the bark and smoke ring, and that deep fried chicken...oh my."

The donuts were definitely worth the detour. The main dishes however were slightly disappointing. I took the chicken & waffles plate which was too oversized, too greasy & too dry for my taste.

You could tell by the way he spoke that this man knows BBQ, and the food backed up the claim. From the wings to the chicken, the ribs to the pork belly, everything they laid down in front of us was perfectly prepared. The sides were also some of the best I've ever had - Mac 'n Cheese, baked beans... these guys a legit. I could ramble forever about how awesome Rubs is, but do yourself a favour and just go try it yourself."

We always noticed that it was empty. Our last night here we decided to go in. And I'm glad we did. So delicious! We had the pork belly rolls, fried pickles which were kool-aid pickles (never had that before), Mac and cheese appetizer, and a side of brisket. Everything was fantastic! Service was great and the food was great! I really hope this place does well. Great patio too!"

Took time to explain to us about the food while being super quick and efficiency and non-sales-ish. Simply love her energy and attitude!  Wish all the waitress in the world are like her! Food was fantastic too! We tried the Taxes Platter for 2. Just perfect! Pulled pork was delicious! Ribs are right on. I did notice beef brisket was just ""ok"" in comparison, but still good. And the baked beans are surprisingly delightful! Who knew?! Definitely will go back when I am in the mood to treat myself with a hearty meaty meal!"

Once seated in the empty restaurant we asked the waitress if we could move to a spot with less AC (the entire restaurant was FREEZING), she said, ""No that a big party was expected but she wasn't even sure if they were coming."" Our food came quickly, I asked for hot sauce, the waitress said they only had buffalo sauce but when I asked again she did say they had Tabasco but they don't usually bring it to the table (the Tabasco arrived in the usual table size bottle). After the food was done, it was too cold in the restaurant to finish my beer so we waited for the bill so long we had to go to the counter at which point the waitress snapped, ""I'll be there in a sec!"" Would not return or recommend."

/user_details?userid=kgAiyUPCeemokjHOOBa6_g,M M.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,It's a very good place to get proper BBQ food in MTL. The brisket was slightly underwhelming in flavour. But the ribs were so good! Definitely one of the best I've ever had. Their sides and appetizers are quite good too. Especially the onion blossom and the poutine. It's definitely worth a try.

/user_details?userid=qnZkCGvLz6AB5cQN_J_pUA,Jack D.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",4 star rating,"Finally made it out to this Rubs. Been to the one in Laval, and while I'm no BBQ expert, I've had enough BBQ in the states to know that this place is legit. They've got all the usual suspects when it comes to these places: Cole slaw, fried chicken, pulled pork sandwiches, corn on the cob, etc. We started with the Southwest Salad, which was huge and fluffy and probably needed more apples and almonds, but provided enough roughage to set the stage for the main event: the St Louis Ribs. We split the full rack with French fries and Cole slaw (which I kinda wished there was more of). The meat was fall off the bone sticky goodness, just what you'd expect from the pits in the middle of Missouri. At first glance, one might think that we didn't order enough food, but the ribs had me stuffed and damn near delirious. It was a pretty mellow Tuesday evening, which was more our speed (I've walked by when it's been packed with rowdy sports fans). The servers and host were very attentive and nice, and while I did have a serious case of food coma (aka ""itis"") afterwards, overall our experience was solid. Will probably come back with a few more friends."

Add a ginormous frosty mug of beer, and that makes for a perfect Friday 5a7 in my book. The service here is friendly and reasonably fast. The ambiance is typical bbq joint but more on the pub/steakhouse style. Good for a group get together or a fun meal for 2. But back to the blooming onion... It was cooked perfectly. The batter was light and the inside was soft and sweet. The dipping sauce was great. They also keep their beer mugs in the freezer so your beer stays cold until the last sip. Definitely a great way to end a long work week and kick off the weekend!"

I havent figured out why it is currently rated so high, but it seems like maybe because there arent other American BBQ places competing with it. I went with 3 friends, we all had different meals and they were all awful. Being from America, id like to think we have a grasp on good BBQ and this place lacks that in every way. The service was just ok. The chicken was dry, the mac and cheese was noodle with cheese melted on top, the sweet potato fries tasted fake, and the taco were poorer quality than Taco Bell. We strongly recommenf doing your stomachs a favor and steering VERY clear. 8 thumbs down for 4 dumb Americans."

/user_details?userid=ZOwEPWw-F1FHAOHc0m19Cw,Will M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I was a fan when this place originally opened and was thrilled to see it return after a 3 1/2 year absence due to flooding and the ensuing insurance battle. We went in the early evening on a Friday and it was pretty quiet, so given that and the fact that they just re-opened a few days prior, I think it would be unfair to judge the ambience.The service is extremely friendly and definitely something I hope continues beyond their first few weeks back in business. To start, we were given complimentary pieces of pork belly, which was a very welcome surprise. For appetizers, we had the brisket spring rolls and the jalapeño poppers, both of which were excellent. My main course was the smoked prime rib sandwich with BBQ baked beans and mac 'n cheese. Maybe a tad on the pricey side at $19, but the sandwich was excellent and far less saltier than it could've been. I'd definitely have it again. The beans were very good, but the mac 'n cheese was a bit disappointing as I found the texture to be rather grainy. Our meal ended with a complimentary key lime cheesecake, which was excellent and a nice gesture due to a few menu items not being available.The menu in general looked great with a tremendous variety of burgers, sandwiches, chicken, pork, beef, fish, etc. You can find just about every staple of southern American BBQ on this menu. The draft beer selection was alright, but I would like to see more local beers available instead of the usual Molson, Rickard's, etc.Being on a pedestrian street like Prince Arthur, the location is excellent for a terrasse and I hope that's in the plans (I should've asked), but I plan on returning either way."

Not only he cooks great food even better he knows great service and so are the staff!  After the food came out he came out and check on us and make sure the food was ok. It was not only ok, it was delicious!!!  Highly recommend the BBQ and their Rubs mojito and Rubs tea! Even personally showed us where to go for the next adventure (I'm a big foodie in the US and had tons lots of BBQ around the states and I got it say.

Yeah, maybe it is, but I was pleasantly surprised by everything this restaurant offered! My wife and I love good BBQ, we've sampled some great southern BBQ on our travels in South Carolina and Louisiana so when we find a great place that measures up we don't look anywhere else (generally). Rubs lives up to that standard. Right away the host and service was attentive and helpful with choices. I was a bit disappointed to find out they did not have any brisket sandwich so I ordered the BBQ chicken. It was fantastic in every way. The BBQ mac and cheese is delicious as a side. I also got a bit of Makers Mark on the rocks to accompany the meal which worked perfectly. Prices are a bit high but well worth for portions and quality here. Don't let the chain styles of this place turn you away, it's superb BBQ food!"
