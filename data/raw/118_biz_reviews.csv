We ordered from here on Uber eats, not really knowing what to expect, and kinda just looking to satisfy a Mexican food crave. Food came really fast and we were just so impressed with the quality of the food ordered. Nachos & guac: 5/5. Chips were sooo tasty. Definitely home made or home fried at least. Guac was homey, had huge avocado chunks in it, and overall just really good. 8 tacos assortment: 5/5 so good. Small, legit, Mexican tacos (soft shell) wwith a generous portion of filling. Even came with pineapple. 4 tacos dorados:5/5. 4 chicken tacos in a hard shell. Topped with generous amount of cheese. Sooo good You can eat these as a snack almost. Horchata drink- really yummy. Kinda strange. But still very fresh and delicious. Cheese quesadilla - 5/5 generous cheese filling. Came with dip. We ordered all of the above for 2 people; and had enough leftovers for a second meal. Would 100% recommend ordering from here. Will definitely be a repeat customer :)"

/user_details?userid=gwmyGLz4eBm9QiBU_Ze2KQ,Katherine A.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"The most affordable tacos I've ever had! Petit (small) tacos for $1.75 (CAD) each. The moment you walk into this hidden gem, you instantly feel the authentic Mexican culture. The staff are very welcoming and inviting to all customers and are happy to answer any questions you may have! We ordered 1 of each taco on the menu and it came up to $12.00 (CAD). They offer a variety of sauces to complement the flavours and overall taco. Although a few tasted a bit dry, the sauces provided some kick to them! Highly recommend trying them with your choice of tacos. Overall great experience, would definitely come back!"
/user_details?userid=_LefSpYADzlqfoi2wUncWA,Jason Z.,"Laval, Canada",3 star rating,Second time coming here to give it another chance. Ordered 2 chupacabras and 2 carnitas. They do authentic tacos but it was bland and they leaned hard on their salsas for taste. The tacos are only $2 so it doesn't feel like a complete waste

/user_details?userid=KcFMI-hsr2Em7whfI4OM5g,Katya P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious little joint that offers cheap Mexican eats! La Taqueria doesn't look like much from the outside, or inside,  but the food is good, the ingredients are simple and everything is fresh.Staff was also very friendly and patient when we were trying to figure out what to order.The chefs are Mexican and I suppose it's a good sign when you hear about other Mexicans who enjoy this place too.For a 1.75$ a taco, you can try every variety and the portions are actually decent, I was surprised at how much meat went into each one.I would definitely recommend this place for a quick lunch, or for take out. They partner with Foodora and Just Eat as well as a bar down the street called Espace Public.Check it out, it's probably one of my favorite spots in this neighborhood now!"

/user_details?userid=R0ACJ1zZZKlYgX_TOJZG7A,Scott M.,"Burlington, VT",5 star rating,"First time here : I went with something safe, but was rewarded for it. I had the two large tacos (chupacabra and adobada) with their super spicy sauce and an agua de jamaica, it was everything I had hoped for and just about the right amount of food. Definitely recommend."

The food is freshly made per order & I practically LIVE for their Chicken Dorados! The service is very fast, considering they make the food as you order, and the prices are great for the amount of food you get. A definite must-try!"
/user_details?userid=N9ewqat7WLApaigDfJnxUA,Hieu L.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Simple and fresh ingredients. Super authentic and good portion of meat for each taco. Found this place by accident but was the best meal of my whole trip, for the price of 1.75 CAD (about 1.50 USD) per tacos it was more than worth it and being able to try out all the different tacos. Got seconds and want to go back for thirds."
/user_details?userid=SKjT7ZCi-Qzk2u8QSFNf7w,Raunak K.,"Skowhegan, ME",4 star rating,The taco and the soup was good and tasty. The people were friendly and the prices were great.
/user_details?userid=ibta4nL8kSYh1d7SiBldmA,Donna L.,"Knoxville, TN",5 star rating,"Found this place after leaving the Botanical Garden on our way back to the hotel. I was craving, and missing Mexican so my husband found this place for me. The owner was so gracious and kind, our Southern gave us away really quickly as ""not from around here,"" along with our lack of French. LOL. We were starving. The food, and real Coke products were so good. I'm including a picture of the four taco sampler my husband got. We ate my meat nachos too quick to grab a picture, but they were so good. I highly recommend the green salsa too. Great food at a good price."

/user_details?userid=EaBKe-8LB-NHuH7Us-QhGw,Vincent V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Solid Taqueria in the HoMa neighborhood, I had the sope, which was made of beef broth with some chickpeas and rice. Tasty, with a tad of spicy salsa and some lime, it's a great start for a meal.I ordered a bunch of tacos, from the chorizo taco to the pork and pineapple one. They were pretty tasty, but some of them were a bit on the ''not as warm as it could have been'' side of things. The meat was pre-cooked, however, it was also very tasty. It was extremely inexpensive, 1.50$ per tacos. The atmosphere is one of a casual taqueria, and it's an extremely efficient spot. Would recommend if you are looking for a quick bite in the area."

/user_details?userid=0Ye5XwXVOmFr_PxoCK_41Q,Andrew T.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Though quality of the tacos is average at best, the atmosphere, value and service are great.I went in for lunch and got their 4 taco and soupe combo for 8.60 + tax. Each taco individually is 1.75, and three tacos here is enough food for lunch, so you can get a pretty cheap meal for around 6 dollars. The man helping me was very kind and gave off a very welcoming vibe.Soup: Was okay, fairly bland (rice + chickpeas)Ground beef: Seasoned well but oversaltedThe other tacos I tried all suffered from the same issue of being underseasoned and dry. (carnitas, sausage, steak) Overall a decent place if you're in the neighborhood and want something cheap to eat but not mind blowing."
/user_details?userid=Q3McVe0ELWQ5PycOcDcvPA,Stephany L.,"Saint-Lambert, Canada",4 star rating,Delicious tacos. Very authentic. Fast paced service. Not much explanation of the menu and what's inside the tacos. Still delicious.
/user_details?userid=kE4hd0xp0x0STp9mwf5WsA,Jesse S.,"London, United Kingdom",5 star rating,"Montreals first authentic taqueria, no offence to Grumman '78 and their cohorts - who have great and interesting tacos, but the price is way out of line with that of street food tacos in Mexico or even sky-high priced San Francisco taquerias. This little joint, housed in a classic old Montreal hot dog diner, delivers the authentic goods, with great prices to match ($1.50-3.50 per taco, with even better combo deals). A Mexican chef, no frills decor and no pretence. Good joint to eat."
/user_details?userid=g986Kd-Mpg2-Gsr-eY0UqA,Alexa R.,"Scripps Ranch, San Diego, CA",5 star rating,This was the best most authentic taco place ever I would definitely recommend to anyone. The staff cared and worked hard. Everything there is home made which makes it even better! Inexpensive and delish!
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"this place is ok - but i probably won't revisit. the tacos were ok but i prefer other places like restaurant mais (even if they are less ""authentic"") and tacos victor (authentic as well). the biggest positives: (i) i liked their tortilla chips with cheese, salsa, and sour cream (unfortunately, the had run out of guacamole) and (ii) their items are quite inexpensive. the biggest negative: the place wasn't very clean. i had to use my son's baby wipes to clean the table we ate at."

/user_details?userid=kkFynET_qWTpipjF5A-T_A,Antony C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,The owner was very courteous and took the time to explain the different taco options. It was the first authentic Mexican taqueria I have been to in Montreal and would definitely recommend to visitors and locals!
/user_details?userid=BWDiUGrvwC41pbkkduDQDQ,Amanda S.,"Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"The place was filthy.Wasn't busy but all the tables where dirty.Won't even discribe the bathroom, but you can smell it before you get there. There was a lady behind the counter sticking her bare hands in the food eating it.Our food was cold.The only toppings I was offered for my tacos was onions and cilantro, apparently cheese, sour cream that normally comes with tacos every where else was extra cost here.My boyfriend got some veggie thing that was like soup, and cold.Even IF the food is good here and we just came on an off day, the mess and filth of this place is a big NO."
/user_details?userid=plMaB9Yy9dsAdDLybOLMKQ,G K A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We're in town for vacation from Colorado and we found this place and it was great. I was born and raised in Mexico and these tacos are amazing authentic Mexican tacos with fresh real tortillas, very hard to find.  I highly recommend this taqueria, it also has friendly fast service. Enjoy!"
