/user_details?userid=a3wqSr4SWjOhxH5qgYT3Zg,Cara H.,"Jersey City, NJ",5 star rating,"Came here for breakfast during a trip in July 2019. Great experience all around. Waitstaff were lovely, coffee was solid and the food was very good. We had the chia bowl and the ricotta pancakes with brown butter maple sauce and Meyer lemon cream, both of which were awesome. They offered local strawberries as an alternative pancake topping but, at the advisement of our server, we opted for the menu standard toppings and I'm so glad we trusted her judgement. The maple and lemon combined with those super delicious and fluffy pancakes was an absolute winner. Important to note, the stand out was the side of bacon. The bacon was very thick and meaty but still crispy (a balance I didn't think possible till I met the bacon at Dandy)."
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We had a very good brunch and exceptional service! We reserved about 1 month in advance for a group of ten. It isn't easy being a waiter or waitress for a large group but the staff at Dandy made it look effortless. We were seated right away, we had enough seats for everyone and we were all comfortable. Waiter brought all our meals at the same time, no mistakes were made (only a juice was forgotten, no big deal!), Our bills came all together and no mistakes were made at all. Really fantastic service for a group. Food was also very good. I ordered the Vol au vent served with mushrooms and a hollandaise sauce. The puff pastry and Hollandaise sauce were absolutely delicious. I really enjoyed this dish and would order it again. Several of my friends ordered the ricotta pancakes doused in maple syrup and loved it. Others ordered the side of bacon which was a thick cut bacon perfectly fried, definitely worth ordering. The fried chicken sandwich was awesome, chicken was crispy and delicious! Honestly, the only dish that was underwhelming was the shushuka. Usually this dish is served with crusty bread on the side, however, Dandy's version had the eggs and tomato sauce served on top of the toast and it made the toast soggy and the dish unappetizing. Overall we all had a wonderful brunch at Dandy's and I would highly recommend this place for groups."

We went there for brunch recently on a Saturday and the place was packed. We were lucky to get a seat right away, and browsed the menu eagerly. The dishes all seemed delicious! I settled for the ricotta pancakes, while the others picked the vol-au-vent du moment and the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich. We got the food fairly quickly, and it looked beautiful. Portions were generous without being overwhelming. The pancakes were fluffy and thick, bathing in syrup and topped with a fragrant Meyer lemon cream. The buttermilk chicken was tender and crisp between surprisingly soft buns. The vol-au-vent was a tower of egg and mushrooms under a rich blanket of hollandaise. On the very top sat the thickest, tastiest beacon of light (sorry). Honestly, it was such good bacon. We had a wonderful time; the food was exciting and delicious, service was attentive, fast and cheerful. I think Dandy is a treasure of a place, and a greatly underrated one at that!"
/user_details?userid=GLh2ujPHKGiUe-0JLWI6XA,Dori L.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Came here fairly hungover and was so surprised by the beautiful architecture and finishings on this restaurant. In a great part of old montreal and easily accessible by car, walking or electric scooters. The menu is fairly small and limited gluten free options. Actually two to be exact so keep in mind if you have dietary restrictions. My brother got the fried chicken sandwich and it looked actually insane. I got the potato latke and it was good, only one egg though so heavy on the potato.Service was really slow so keep that in mind when you're heading there. Don't go starving! Overall great brunch/lunch vibes."
/user_details?userid=8qu5Zyurap002eIj1kLdOg,Joana Z.,"Saint-Lambert, Canada",5 star rating,"This restaurant is EVERYTHING.My friend and I went there on a Friday morning around 10:30 AM. Parking is free on Saint-Jacques and its surroundings before 12 PM, but otherwise, I would recommend going by public transportation because Old Port can get pretty crowded especially in the summer and it's harder to find parking.We were greeted by the owner who directly sat us down. The atmosphere of the restaurant is super calm and minimalistic. I believe it is one of the only brunch places where I could hear the person in front of me talking without them having to shout. The mirrors are fun, they make the place look bigger. They have huge windows which make the place very luminous and bright, the orange/yellow coloured walls and benches as well. The bathroom was extremely clean and smelled amazing!As for the food, the menu is small but it makes it easier to pick what you want to eat. My friend started off with an iced latte with almond milk. I was pleasantly surprised that they did not bring any plastic straws, better for the environment. We ordered 3 plates to share: the ricotta pancakes, the breakfast sandwich and the Ritchie's breakfast plate.The pancakes are out of this world!! The lemon cream on top of them is truly one of a kind. The breakfast sandwich is filled with chimichurri sauce which makes it very tasteful. The Ritchie's breakfast plate was also very good, we had it with smoked salmon. My only tiny issue: I just wished they eggs and the salmon were a little bit more seasoned. Overall, the service is impeccable. The waiters kept coming to our table asking if everything was alright and adding water to our cups. The price is right because the food feels high quality.I would definitely recommend this place for brunch and I'm excited to try it soon for lunch!"
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"A lovely brunch spot in old montreal. I was interested in visiting thanks to the really pretty instagram pics and it really is as nice as the pictures show. If you don't have a reservation, get there early to get a good table and expect to have to vacate it once the groups with reservations arrive. Prices are on par with other brunch spots in old montreal. Brunch is only on the weekends but their lunch menu features some brunch items.  I ordered the fried chicken sandwich and it was pretty darn good. I thought the taste was really unique and the chicken was very crispy. It was just really big and i was completely full afterwards. I didn't like the potatoes on the side though, they tasted burnt and bland. The service was great. Everyone was nice and attentive. My friend and I had a good brunch!"
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It's no secret that Montrealers love their brunch, and if we're being honest can you blame them?  Brunch is a great way to spend a lazy weekend morning.  Thankfully, there is no shortage of good brunch spots in Montreal for all kinds of tastes and budgets.  My latest brunch discovery was Dandy.  After hearing that the team behind Olive and Gourmando are the ones in charge of this restaurant I was eager to pay it a visit.It's a beautiful space and even on a Saturday morning it never gets overly crowded.  On both my visits here we had no reservation but that was not an issue.  The space has lots of natural light and feels very open.You can expect a small menu with some heavier items and some lighter ones.  I've tried the shakshuka toast which I enjoyed quite a bite.  It was well-seasoned and the portion was generous.  I have also had the lemon ricotta pancakes and those were also a winner though there was a bit too much maple syrup on them for my liking.One beef I have with the service is that both times I came here they were very slow to bring us our coffee orders and both times they forgot sugar despite having asked for it.  To be honest I am not really sure why they are so slow with the caffeine because every other aspect of the service is just fine.This is an awesome addition to Montreal's brunch scene and despite being in Old Montreal the prices are fair.  Yes, it won't be a super cheap brunch but it also won't be overly expensive.  Dandy is definitely worth the visit if you're in Old Montreal and in the mood for brunch."
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Dandy is a very cute brunch place in Old Montreal. Upon arriving, we were a party of 4 no reservations but they were able to seat us fairly quickly. The seating space is very close to each other and rather compact. The menu is simple, yet has good variety. I had their rendition of Shakshuka toast which was a bite full of flavour-served on a slice of sourdough, topped with a blend of tomatoe chutney and  sunny side egg. This dish was very filling! I would've loved to try the fried buttermilk chicken sandwich or ricotta pancakes if I wasn't headed to the spa afterwards. The latté was a great side to my meal."
/user_details?userid=wdeWt5VqTW26PAeQsVg73g,Ada L.,"North York, Canada",5 star rating,"Dandy is a newly opened brunch/café/wine destination located in Old Montreal. I had actually had heard about the place through social media and was glad my friends and I randomly stumbled upon it during our stay in Montreal recently. The space of the restaurant is modern and chic. It has a warm inviting vibe to it which draws you in. My friends and I dropped by Dandy at around 4pm on a Saturday afternoon hoping to get some dessert and coffee. What we ended up staying for were wine, dessert, and a good time. The staffs at Dandy's were incredibly nice and knowledgeable. They were able to assist us in choosing our drinks as well as provided us with recommendation and samples. I, myself, opted for the orange wine they had, something that was unique and new to me. We also shared 2 delicious desserts between the 4 of us. One was a chocolate torte and the other was a hazelnut cake. Overall, we ended up staying past the restaurant's closing time but the staff was accommodating and we never felt rushed to leave. Overall, would recommend if you are in the Old Montreal area!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Good food and good service. The brunch menu doesn't have a lot of choices, but they all seemed special. We tried the potato latke with smoked salmon and the fried chicken sandwhich. The first one tasted fresh and was healthy. The fried chicken was crunchy and the apple chips were delicious. The juices were freshly pressed. The wait time wasn't too long for a sunday. The place is modern and clean. The staff are very friendly and nice. They also have some pastries and they all looked amazing. Would definitely go back."
/user_details?userid=WMK1j18ACm-EtopEznV4Rg,Jana T.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"Cute brunch spot in old Montreal.  Beautiful decor with big windows and light fixtures, making it a lovely bright space.  When we arrived at 11 am on a Saturday we got a table but there was a line shortly after, so best to get there early on a weekend.  The menu is short with only about 8 choices but a nice mix of sweet and savoury options.  I had the chia pudding which was light and very tasty without being too sweet.  A good choice if you're not very hungry.  Coffee was good and service was friendly and well paced."

Both were delicious!The fried chicken was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy inside. The crepes were so fluffy.

/user_details?userid=d3XucpqiUUVh5xEuHyRN1Q,Claire B.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Worth the trip to Vieux-Port just for the pancakes. My girlfriend and I started with mimosas and lattes which were 4/5. Now... the pancakes. The maple brown butter syrup was not sickly sweet, and the butter perfectly browned. The meyer lemon cream sauce was just ridiculously good. Three pancakes is more than enough. The interior is spacious and has a cool art deco vibe. Wasn't busy at all - overall a really pleasant brunch."

/user_details?userid=IzNTeGSXsG6pUAg55i39vg,Alan D.,"Lasalle, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"After hearing about the fried chicken sandwich my colleagues chose this resto for a farewell lunch. We were 8. Seated pretty fast but took sometime for our order to be taken. Unfortunately even though we were early (1230pm) the chicken sandwich was sold out- big disappointment. The menu was also different from what posted on the website of the restaurant. We ended up eating mainly the cod and porchetta sandwich. Others had the pizza, ricotta pancakes and tabouleh."

/user_details?userid=-bylE6E66-myZRJq-24avg,Trista M.,"CA, CA",4 star rating,"Visiting Montreal for work and Dandy was behind the hotel. Looked at it everyday for a week and finally decided to go my last day in town. I shouldn't have waited. The lemon ricotta pancakes were aamaazing! Orange juice was delicious..tasted fresh squeezed. It was a bit loud inside, but I'm finding that a lot of the newer restaurants like it loud and don't do much with the acoustics to reduce the noise. It didn't bother me too much, but hubby didn't like it as it was hard to hear each other.All things considered though it was very good! The food was delicious!"

/user_details?userid=uAfGm_AAtMbgiAwdzlpVtA,Pete L.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Food is overpriced and not that good. I had the impression the clientèle was mostly composed of the famous/influencer owner's devotees. It felt like being at the Saloon in the Village, albeit in a nicer environement and with a better dressed clientele. Still doesn't make up for the food. There are way better restaurants in the same area. Service was just OK."

Little pricey but that's what you get when you're in the old port! I was really excited to have mimosas but they were out of orange juice (kinda odd for a Sunday brunch place). Besides that, my latte and food were delicious: good experience!"

In a lovely sunny setting with a wait staff who worked as a cooperative team."
/user_details?userid=Nwumm2dGAhFIcdDTJsgPkg,Warren V.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"This spot is great but you may have a bachelorette party sitting next to you, it sort of feels like that kind of place and we certainly did.  The pancakes are great and the bloody cesar is not to be missed.  Bacon is also great but order less than you think as it's a lot.  The fried chicken sandwich had great flavor but not nearly enough chicken.  The menu is truly limited so not a great spot of you have a large group of picky or finicky eaters.  It was also hard to get a glass of water refilled but overall a lovely experience!"
/user_details?userid=lky3Ga87YSFM-2PPmuv94w,Drew M.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,Service was beyond amazing and so accommodating to food allergies. Amy (our waitress) was delightful and really made the experience so warm and welcoming. Food was delicious and focused on the true fresh flavors of the food instead of relying on sugary sauces or covering the food in butter. I would recommend getting the gazpacho and the halibut. The space was also very modern and bright. 10/10 would recommend for lunch.

/user_details?userid=o4hkA7i49xeP85SzRo4VWQ,Shish K.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Went to try their fried chicken sandwich and was very disappointed. There was barely any chicken in there. Just a lot of fried stuff which was dry and bland served on a stale bun. The homemade chips were just soggy slices of potato. I left a pretty full plate with all the fried dredging that I had picked out of there to find the little bit of chicken , all the chips and at least half the bun and the staff didn't even ask if anything was wrong. I guess they either knew they served me a terrible sandwich or just assumed I was the problem. Nice Instagram though. Too bad they don't put as much effort into serving decent food."
/user_details?userid=8gaLMdKf6DPB--p_cJuSDg,Nancy G.,"Lutherville-Timonium, MD",3 star rating,"I went to Dandy based on a small number of reviews for this fairly new restaurant open for only 2 months. The service was great. The ricotta lemon pancakes, which I ordered because they had good reviews, I found to be so heavy that I really did not enjoy them. They were also a bit pricey. The latte was served not hot enough for my taste. The restaurant is a nice space and perhaps if I ordered differently I could give it a better rating."
