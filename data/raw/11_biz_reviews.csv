Usually, it seems like this place is packed in regular times. With the pandemic, there's still a wait, but it's not as busy and well worth visiting.Litterally the best sandwich/panini I've ever had. I had Le Cubain, but I'd like to go back to try the Egg on your face as expectations are high!"
/user_details?userid=nhaOsefSdn_LrEG5uePZqw,Franck H.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Honestly I always heard about this place and I live a short walk away but never got around to trying it. Last weekend I finally did so and it is as delicious as it gets. I had the cubano sandwhich which seems to be the one most recommended by people who have tried it, and I can honestly say best sandwhich I've ever had. Everything is made inhouse, and you can taste the difference in that fresh bread  they also have a pretty nice collection of wine for take out"

I came there during tea time, somehow, the place looked a bit dark from inside.I ordered The Vegan Plate. The plate looks beautiful and delicious. I liked everything on the plate and the beet hummus was my favorite. The cashew dip was flavorful with seasoning and spicy oil and I loved the fresh cucumbers to temper the spiciness. I took the Killer Cookie to go. I love their chocolate chip cookie. It has lots of chocolate! It's a large cookie so I eat half of it and save the rest for the next day.Next time, I would like to try the Cha-Cha-chia bowl."

/user_details?userid=VyOxoPvT2UwJvO1qoYVnjw,Kam P.,"Burnaby, Canada",5 star rating,"The best breakfast panini and quick service! On a Wednesday at noon, there was no line up  but still a busy inside. We walked through the sludge because we heard great things and we were so glad we checked it out! I would opt for a latte instead of the drip coffee ( it was too dark for my liking). The poached egg panini was spicy and flavourful I'd recommend  it! We also oordered the chocolate brioche... I think I'd ask them to warm it up next time. The Waiter seated us promptly and got our food quickly."

I had the Cuban sandwich and a bowl of Black Bean and Bacon soup, total tab was $44 including a glass of wine, tax and tip. The sandwich was ridiculously good (actually everything was ridiculously good). The outside of the bread was so crispy and tasty! Very high quality prep for a soup and sandwich experience. The service was also great, friendly and efficient. I won't wait for another act of nature to go back!"

Additionally we ordered yogurt parfaits which were very satisfying, although a bit overprice. Because we came before 11am, the lunch menu was not available. The breakfast selection was a bit sparse, and basically consisted of pastries. If I ever visit Montreal again I would go back to try their legendary paninis!"
/user_details?userid=op8d9geoz8oeBseVAqiPNg,Veronica Y.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"The egg on your face panini is incredible. Perfect amount of toasting, gooey cheese, salty speck, and fatty egg (not oozing poached egg though - so it wasn't as drippy as I envisioned but tasty nonetheless). Waited about 10 mins when I arrived around 12:10. Was super lucky too - during those ten minutes, about 8 or so other groups came in until the waiting area couldn't hold any more people."

They said it would be an hour and a half wait but it turned out being more like 45mins for two.      We had the Mr. Miami panini and the poached egg on your face panini. -Mr.Miami panini; a smoked beef brisket, grilled red onions, cilantro pesto mayo, and jalapeño havarti cheese served with pineapple jalapeño chutney, on a freshly baked bread made at location.-Poached egg on your face panini; spicy poached eggs sriracha and herbs, raw milk cheese, speck (pork) and roasted tomatoes, on a freshly baked and pressed bread made at location.      Both were, with our at home culinary skills, impossible to duplicate without coming to Olive & Gourmando. We however skilled at cooking (Specially the wife) are not confident it would come out as amazing as it did here.      It was overall the perfect balance of crisp on the bread, juicy flavor of meats and special sauces and the temp was spot on. However big the panini's were they never over dripped or lost their form while eating. It was just very pleasant. Add to this their espresso and we were in heaven."

One thing about the menu though there is not that many options for breakfast which is fine we both found something we wanted.I ordered mocha and we Both ordered the spicy egg Panini sandwich. Food and drink came out pretty quickly.    The mocha was delicious creamy and chocolatey. The sandwich was huge and contained a lot of spice from the  Siarachi sauce.

It had many many awesome reviews, so we had to try! It definitely did not disappoint!! We ordered Cuban panini and green salad with local beer. The panini was so perfect and the salad was very simple yet very tasty. I think the dressing and almond made the difference. Also the cold local beer was like a taste of heaven since the weather was pretty hot when we visited end of July! We used Yelp waitlist system, and we did not have to wait when we got to the restaurant! It worked out perfectly. So please use their yelp waitlist system, so that you don't have to wait in line for a long time. Would love to visit again if we are in the area. Their bakery looked good, too!"

Although a bit cramp, there does not have loud background music, and it's easy to converse. The menu is simple and easy to understand, and the panini never fails to impress. Each component of the sandwich is individually delicious, blanketed with cheese and sauce, with a perfectly toasted panini bread.I recommend this restaurant to everyone who passes the old port."

It's always busy, but my family of three didn't have to wait long around 8:30am on a Tuesday.The food is pretty good. I ordered a spicy breakfast panini and it was great! My latte also was delicious. The one thing that wasn't great was the almond croissant. It comes out skinny and not as good compared to other spots in the city.The service was the other complaint. They were focused on getting people in and out and failed to be friendly."
/user_details?userid=cbzM6kE426dOaTvj9NPqww,Jonathan C.,"Los Angeles, CA",2 star rating,"This place was disappointing. It's always a crappy visit when you wait for a long time to get seated and after that, the server tells you that all of the food ran out and you are limited with what you can order. I got there early on a Thursday and it was still packed. Guess that is how it is for the summer. Before getting there, I did put myself on the Yelp waitlist just so my queue wasn't too bad once I got there.Anyways, I was seated around 9:45 and service was pretty slow. I didn't know who my server was until it was almost 10 am. The server was really nice so I definitely appreciated that. Then my feelings of disappointment started to kick in. So ideally, I wanted to try the poached egg on your face panini. Out. Then I was like okay let's do a backup sandwich then, The Cuban panini please. No can do because lunch is not served yet. So it's 10 am... do I wait an hour until lunch starts or do I order other things?So yes, I decided to just stay and order different items. I ordered the homemade sweet ricotta, dirty chai cold, and the Valrhona chocolate brioche. (P.S. I love Valrhona chocolate, I've baked with it so many times before. My ideal chocolate actually)The ricotta was alright. The dirty chai came out hot... I t's a hot summer day and they thought I said ""chaude"" which means hot in French when I actually said cold. (Which I don't get because I literally ordered everything in English... but anyways I didn't want to waste it so I kept the hot drink). Lastly, the brioche was dry so I had to dip it in the dirty chai to soften it up. Honestly, this place is way too hyped. Timing is everything here and honestly, I visited at the worst time possible. It's not the restaurants fault, service was great. Food ran out... (quickly!), but since I was visiting from out of town and this being my one and only visit, I just wished  things turned out for the better. Beautiful aesthetic though for the decor of the restaurant.To all the future visitors, please get your timings right. Either visit when it truly opens for breakfast or make sure to make it for lunch. Don't land in the limbo time frame and make the same mistakes I did."

/user_details?userid=WMjtBdZqbUIa4pnnrQJ4WA,Anzor A.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"The place was very very busy and very noisy when we arrived, so I think it's better to come earlier to get a table! Unfortunately, the bakery section was almost gone, but I was able to get the small or ""petite"" Latte which is $4,75 and very very small, I would say pay ¢25 to get a 2x larger one. I have taken  the almond croissant which was great though, pricing for $5. I think that this place is decent because of its bakery products, Italian cuisine and ambiance."

The menu is pretty small but I was happy to see mac n cheese on it. It was quite good and came with a much-needed and proper side salad (not just leaves but also nuts and onions with good dressing). The Cuban panini could have had more meat and more flavor. We topped it all off with the chocolate chip cookie, which was overbaked, with most of it very crispy and only the very middle chewy. If you like a crispy cookie then it would be your jam!"
/user_details?userid=3LNCN_aMHo97xvEFR4PhDw,Ashley K.,"Las Vegas, NV",5 star rating,"I came here for breakfast after someone I know told me this place was good. It is seriously...hands down the most amazing food I have eaten on my trip!I came here approximately 0830am Thursday and came again on Saturday morning. They open at 0800am and the place was already pretty full. However, my party of 4 was seated right away. They do speak english which is a plus. It's a cute restaurant/cafe style and has pastries on display up front. Order:Poached egg on your face: It's a breakfast panini with spicy poached eggs, pork, cheese, siriacha, cheese and tomatoes. It doesn't sound that amazing, but first bite into the panini and it was heaven. The bread of the panini had a nice crunch to it with every bite, the mix of the eggs, cheese, tomatoes, pork and the spice to it was amazing. It has a pretty good kick of spice to it and I loved it. It is a must try!Home made sweet ricotta: It's ricotta with honey and orange zest on top with toast on the side. I love ricotta. So I had to try this dish! The sweetness of the honey and orange zest in the ricotta blends so well together. Spread it on the toast and it's awesome! Home made granola with fresh fruit and yogurt: Fresh fruits and granola topped onto yogurt. I only had a bite of this dish, but the one who ordered it really enjoyed it. The best part of it was the fruits were really fresh.Cheese Croissant and Almond Croissant: Ugh..best croissants I have ever had in my life. It was so flaky and buttery in each bite. Simple, yet so good. I wish I had the chance to try their lunch menu items. I heard it's just as amazing. I highly recommend this place if you either live in the area, or visit the city."

/user_details?userid=pgHMIbsTmgFT4EqpijC8Pg,Weihan Z.,"Jersey City, NJ",5 star rating,"It's been almost two weeks and I'm still thinking about that poached egg on your face panini I had at this place in Montreal. We were on an early flight and hopped on a bus from the airport and got off on a random stop in downtown. Looked up yelp to find a place to eat as we had several hours before we could check into our Airbnb. Thankfully this place was only a ten minute walk from where we were. I put us on the waitlist and we walked over and were seated immediately once we got there. There was a big line outside that we just walked past thanks to the yelp waitlist.My girlfriend got the chocolate croissant and the warm potato salad. I got the poached egg on your face panini and it was fantastic. One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. It was a flavor bomb with cheese, eggs and meat. The crust gave it the perfect texture to add to all the oozing middle.The service was quick and friendly. The restaurant is a little crowded and the tables and seats are all very close to each other. But overall great experience and I will definitely be back for that panini."

It's quite a busy place during lunch hours and I heard amazing things about the sandwiches. When I finally got around to trying them they were actually incredibly oily to the point that it was very messy and hard to enjoy. If they go easy on the oil, I think the sandwiches could be quite delicious - the meats on their own were really really great. The salsa that comes with one of the paninis is also amazing."

I signed in on the Yelp wait-list ahead of time which allowed us to walk in and be seated. No matter what, the food is worth the wait. We arrived on the cusp of lunch so we ordered both breakfast and lunch items. The coffee was perfect as was the cinnamon bun pastry. We also tried the yogurt granola bowl which was filled with fresh and dried fruits. It was lovely. Finally we had the Mr. Miami panini which is AMAZING. Highly recommended!"
/user_details?userid=K6i3CeTT5NCScDns4BSITA,Doris L.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Okay, so I came late and there were no chocolate brioche so I'm disappointed. Had an almond croissant. This is dense compared to the traditional ones that are taking day-old croissants and adding almond paste to it. It wasn't most enough either even though it is dense.I had a chai latte. It was yum. The service was great. The place was decorated really festive like the other cafes in Old Montreal for Christmas. I'm not opposed to coming back and actually coming back for a meal. We went to the timeout foodhall as well and didn't find the brioche there either."

I got there like at 10am and they sold out of what I was going there for which is the chocolate banana brioche. I got a chocolate croissant which was really good. Their mocha coffee and hit chocolate where really good but I've had better out here. They yogurt with granola and fruits was amazing. The vibes and service where amazing. Really chill and awesome spot to have breakfast items and coffee. A bit of a wait during busy days, so don't go with big groups. Get there early for the best bakery items."
/user_details?userid=LMoK9BUP6Tgfc0AeDVbZHQ,Steff D.,"Portland, ME",5 star rating,"It's always difficult to find a new favorite when it's located an entire country away. If I lived in Montreal, I could see myself tucking away here often.The interior has a rustic country kitchen vibe to it. It's smaller than it appears from the outside, and to maximize their occupancy the arrangement of seating is very intimate. There's several tables and a communal hightop - as a solo traveler, I was sat at the latter with a family having breakfast. It was *that* busy on a Wednesday midmorning when I came that it was the only spot available (if I were you, I'd try and snag the seats against the window! they're the most private and the best people watching!).The menu wasn't the draw for me here - the baked goods and pastries were. I ended up having a lovely cup of coffee and the chocolate banana brioche - which was hands down one of the best things I've eaten in a long time. Think flaky, melt-in-your-mouth, but dense cinnamon roll with creamy dark chocolate and mellow hints of banana. It wasn't as sweet as you might think. I have craved this divine little treat often since I first had it. Sigh. Someone want to ship me some?I will for sure be back when I'm in Montreal next, but I'd probably just get a box of pastries/baked goods to go! My advice? If you're eyeing something in particular here: just get it, it'll absolutely be worth it!"

Well it certaintly lived up to both it's hype as well as it's long wait! I got the sell known spicy egg breakfest panini and my boyfriend ordered the cuban panini and we shared a side of potatos with an almond croissant (the last one of the day apparently) to go! Everything was delicious and the waitstaff was wonderful. We also enjoyed the local fun and rustic cafe feel. I do think they would benefit from having more than one bathroom though if they do continue to be as crowded as they get.

It's a little chaotic when you get there at peak times like we did. Even the takeaway line has a long wait.I got the pear and hazelnut croissant which was delicious. The coffee was pretty good as well, although their milk selection is a bit limited. They have a lot of non-dairy milks but no skim or 1%. Despite the craziness the staff was friendly and patient.

I don't know if it's because I've been noticing fatty food more or it did get worse, but I find their sandwich oily. It still tastes good, but the oil makes you not want to finish the sandwich entirely.Also! I just noticed they let you put yourself on the waitlist through the Yelp app...it's so amazing!

They're still as popular as ever, perhaps even more so.We dropped in on a Sunday (around 11:00am) and had to wait 15 minutes for a table to open up. The inside is open air and has a lively, vibrant vibe to it.If you don't want to eat a meal here, grabbing a pastry or two is worth a quick pitstop. There's three separate menus for breakfast, brunch and lunch. Seems a little excessive with an overlap of some items.- The Mr. Miami ($14.95) - smoked beef brisket, grilled red onion, cilantro pesto mayo, havarti, pineapple and jalapeño salsa. The sandwich was okay but there was no wow factor. - Tartine ($18.00) - house ricotta, cucumber, roasted squash, Asian pear, nuts and a herbs & honey + lemon + Aleppo pear dressing. This was impressive. The combo of flavours worked wonders.O&G is still a classic spot in the Old Port."

/user_details?userid=lyxvWcFLoho5AB_GzZmdhw,Emily D.,"Norwalk, CT",3 star rating,"We had already eaten brunch earlier, but I was still hungry around 1:15 pm, and I wanted to get good food before leaving for the airport. Due to the overwhelmingly positive Yelp reviews, I really wanted to try this place so I added myself to the Yelp waiting list, and walked down the road in the rain (tip, it's about an 8 minute walk from the Courtyard Downtown). The Yelp waiting list does make it clear that it's not a true reservation, which I appreciated and it helped to set my time expectations. Upon arrival, I checked in with the host and she said it wouldn't be too long. I waited inside, due to the rain, and watched as people behind me got tables. At one point, she called three two-tops who were no shows, and then said any twos at all I can seat. A couple right off the street got the table. I guess with their creative community style seating, one single person doesn't rate and gets sat, not in order, but when they can find one stool in the corner of the restaurant to squeeze you into, which is what happened to me.I also was a host for years at very many restaurants and this is unacceptable. You could get a table of two who only drinks water and splits a meal and I spent way more than that. It's all a guessing game, you can't just discredit a solo traveler. Don't go out of your way to make one person feel not worth it. Rant over ... for now.Anyways, the menu is short, sweet and a little expensive. I got their grilled cheese with caramelized onions and homemade ketchup and nothing else but a napkin for $16 CAD. Was it good? Yes, and sweeter than a traditional grilled cheese in a good way, but five stars, not quite. I enjoyed two cocktails, their raz lemonade vodka, which was very good the first time and still good the second time but I'm fairly positive it had no booze. If I remember right, the drinks were $10 or $12 CAD. This restaurant is somewhat large, but they jam people in so there literally isn't any room to move. It's loud and you can't always find your server so you just try to order from the closest staff to you, especially when you are in a rush to catch a flight.Overall, here is my rating for my visit on 7/14/19 around 1:15 pm.- Wait list process: 2 stars (please fix this, and don't make single people feel ridiculous for eating alone) - Food: 3.5 stars you can tell they use quality ingredients, but the food is slightly overpriced and the sandwiches should come with some sort of side - Drinks: 4 stars, the raz lemonade vodka is quite yummy, especially when there's booze in it - Atmosphere: 2.5 - 3 stars, it's just too crowdedOverall: 3.5 starsWould I go back? Though decision but since I don't live in Montreal, there are too many other places to try, which I would visit or revisit first."

The menu for breakfast seemed a touch sparse, but [personally I only had eyes for the infamous breakfast sandwich. When we received our entire order, I must say the coffee was on point and the sandwich almost met the sky-high expectations. The spice level was about 10-15% high for me, so if they calibrate it just a bit, I think it would round out the entire flavor profile of the sandwich a touch more.Lastly, they have several mouth-watering baked goods on display, and I wish I had the opportunity and appetite to try them."
/user_details?userid=wmERC0H8MH_jcRlSQfF9Dw,Tiffany L.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"My favorite bakery in Montreal, like seriously, we came back here the night before our flight home so we would have something yummy to munch on!We were lucky enough to catch the tail end of their morning offerings and beginning of lunch service which started at 11 AM.  We started with a selection of baked goods from their display case of yummineess located in front of the coffee bar area.  I felt like a kid in a candy store as I wanted to try everything!  We ended up trying the almond croissant, cheezy biscuit, blueberry tart, brownie, and another fruit tart.  We also ordered a latte as well as the homemade sweet ricotta, and the O+G Grilled Cheese hot panini.The almond croissant was a bit different than the ones I am used to as this one was skinnier, and longer more like the shape of a chunky cigar.  However, it was still flaky and had a nice flavor of almond in each bite, the shape also made it easy to eat.Cheezy biscuit was like eating an adult version of a Cheez-It, in biscuit form.Blueberry tart-So I typically don't care much for fruit tarts, but this was actually my FAVORITE.  The pastry was nice and flaky and the tart filling was spot on, not tart at all and not too sweet.  If they have any offerings with fruit, I would STRONGLY recommend ordering!Brownie-Hm, so I wasn't a fan of this brownie as it wasn't your typical ooey gooey chocolatey mess, but was more like a dense dark chocolate bar.  I am not sure if the texture was different because it was gluten free, but O+G does offer many gluten free options!Homemade Sweet Ricotta-I was hesitant to try this as I am not a fan of ricotta but this was absolutely delicious!  The ricotta was quite light and fluffy, and paired beautifully with the honey and orange rinds to compliment the yummy bread!  I thought this dish had the perfect balance of textures and flavors, especially with the surprise of the scattered grains of salt.O+G Grilled Cheese hot panini- Who doesn't love caramelized onions, and perfectly melted cheese?!?  This panini was just what we needed after all the sweets we devoured.  I think it would also pair very well with a soup!For those looking for a cute cafe with amazing pastries and offerings, look no more as O+G will satisfy all your wants!"

I would have LOVED to comment on the other food, but unfortunately I can only comment on the grilled cheese. It was extremely heavy, really greasy, and pretty standard. It also seemed a little bit expensive for being such a plain dish. Overall, I probably only spent about 30 minutes in the restaurant. Service was quick though so that's a plus."

These were some of the best paninis I've ever had! I got the Cuban and my boyfriend got the bacon option. Mine was a traditional Cuban, but the type of pork they used was great. It wasn't dried out and the aioli sauce they used paired nicely. The bacon panini had bacon, thin slices of apples, walnut butter, and a heavenly combo of other ingredients. The bread they used was the perfect balance between being too soft and too hard."

Not too sweet and not too buttery.I've only been for a sit-down meal once when we walked by one day and it wasn't too crowded. It was pretty early in the morning. I ordered the ""Poached egg on your face"" and it was great! A bit spicier than I was expecting for a breakfast dish, but still good either way. The coffee was just ok, not really worth it in my opinion. There are a lot of other great coffee shops nearby you can stop at after breakfast if you need your caffeine fix.

/user_details?userid=xldzk9U-sILprbCsB8w9HA,Jess M.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"First time I ever used waitlist and wow, I am blessed now. Waitlist was showing a 31-47 minute wait for a party of 3 on a Sunday morning. My Airbnb was 25 minute away so I put myself on the waitlist (20th in line) before leaving. After parking, I was able to browse two surrounding shops before getting a notification saying my table was ready. I basically didn't wait at all. Pretty accurate estimation too. If you're going to come, definitely use waitlist. There were so many people the whole time I was there. I honestly had trouble getting in and out of the place with the amount of people there. So I'm not a sandwich person but it's highly rated even after over a thousand reviews so I had to check it out just to know. We ordered:* Cubain Panini ($15.25) - There's only one slice of meat and it honestly looked pretty disappointing when it arrived so I was really surprised when I bit into it. The gruyere was super gooey and the sandwich stayed hot the entire time. The sauce was really good too. If you're worried about it being spicy, don't worry. I cannot handle spice at all and I thought it was fine. I thought the flavours were really good but there wasn't much meat taste if that's what you're looking for.* Mr. Miami Panini ($15.25) - Least favourite item we ordered. Much bigger piece of meat when compared to Cubain but I thought it was too salty and wasn't anything special. I didn't use the pineapple jalapeno chutney because I can't handle spice but I was told it makes it a lot better. Group consensus was the Cubain was the better Panini. * #24 Salad ($18.25) + Chicken ($4.00?) - Pretty decent size salad and tasted pretty good but it wasn't anything special. I can definitely get a similar salad at many other places. * Sweet Ricotta ($11.25) -  Available until 4:00 PM. I honestly love ricotta. If you just scoop up the ricotta, plop it on the toast, it's so sweet. Literally like just orange marmalade with honey poured on top, nothing else. That's a lot of sugar so maybe push some of the honey off and it's bomb. Did I mention I love ricotta yet? Toast is yummy, ricotta is yummy, I love sweet things. Our total came to slightly less than $90 after tax which I thought was kind of pricey for what we got. It's not like the paninis came with a  side or anything. Just the sandwich. Priceyyyyy. Place was decent but nothing mind blowing and definitely not 4.5 stars good. Maybe idk what's good but I don't see what the big deal is about. I would wait at a lot of places but if you're going to have to wait more than 15 minutes max, I would say leave. Not worth.p"

The line wasn't bad so we didn't wait for long and the service was nice and welcoming but the food was just okay. When we arrived the most popular panini already sold out so we tried the Miami style but it was too salty and we didn't finish the Cha cha chia bowl since the strawberry sauce in the bowl was too artificially flavored. We ordered 2 pastries: chocolate banana bun and biscuit and biscuit was the best.

A marketplace of baked goods, coffees, salads, cold sandwiches, hot paninis, all-day breakfast and weekend brunch! Need I say more?!Location: 5/5A short walk from the Grand Quai and the Musée Pointe de Calliere in Old Montreal. This place is happening even for a normal weekday lunch!!Decor/Ambience: 4.5/5Very good use of space. Homey. Rustic. Earthy. There is a bakery at the front where baked goods and coffees are available to-go. Upbeat French music fills the air and a buzzing mix of conversations. Reservations is definitely needed for groups larger than 2, since this place is a bit small and most of their tables are meant for two only. I Ly is so popular among locals and tourists alike that we had to wait for 15-20 minutes even though we went in after 2 p.m.Food quality: 5/5My cha cha chia bowl was VEGAN and made from the freshest tasting ingredients like strawberries, coconuts, chia seeds, spiced bananas, and blueberries. Tasted so healthy and heavenly that I just had to close my eyes and just let the flavours dance around in my mouth. It was presented in the cutest glass jar. Almost reminds me of a parfait but without any of the fatty cream.I could come and eat this any given day.I also bought a chocolate banana brioche to go and was it ever rich in chocolatey banana goodness! Very flavourful, was not too doughy either.My beau ordered their O + G grilled cheese and my oh my did it all that cheese just melted in his mouth. Crispy toasted panini served out with ketchup on the side and gooey richness inside. Well done!I think for a sandwich place, they really try to cater to everyone possible.Service: 4.5/5We were seated as fast as they could have us. Our server immediately told us what's their daily/weekly special, followed by what's already sold out, and asked us if we have any allergies. Food was served pretty quickly, too. The staff worked very smoothly and fast as a team. There was no idling and still, they all smiled and gave off a positive synergy.Value: 5/5Fair price. I am so happy that I found a place that offers vegetarian or vegan options that are healthy, affordable, and sizeable portions. They also have big salad options, which I have to try the next time I am in Montreal, but wow, I am totally impressed with this place!Would highly recommend having a sit down lunch or brunch here and grab either a drink or baked goods to go if you happen to be touring/visiting Old Montreal or near the port area."

While waiting, it was hard to restrain from ordering a pastry at the counter... huge sticky buns, Gouda croissants, beaver tails, and more. I loved the grilled cheese that had raclette cheese oozing out of it. I dipped it in the soup of the day which was red pepper with Gorgonzola cream and big fluffy croutons. My friend thoroughly enjoyed the ouffe coquette and repeatedly told me it was better than mine (lies). To end, we shared the blueberry pastry which was overloaded with chunky blueberry filling. The idea was to have mimosas but we were warned that their fresh squeezed orange juice didn't pair well with bubbly.. they were absolutely right but both were amazing on their own. The service was good even though it was extremely busy. You should certainly except a decent wait time. Even so we honestly would have gone back again during our trip if the restaurant hadn't been closed on New Years Eve and Day."

It's got all that old Montreal charm to it minus the onslaught of tourists that are inevitably waiting on line no matter the time or day. The prime time is brunch and if you're lucky, you'll score their infamous baked goods that tend to sell out by 11am. But not to worry, everything here is satisfying enough to forget you missed out on their specialties. It's lively, cozy, and rustic vibes will put any diners in the right mood to enjoy a good meal. Solid choice for a cafe but to wait 30+ mins(on a slow day, expect closer to an hour normally) can be somewhat off putting. Although you won't be disappointed with the food, it might be hard to justify the wait times. I'm a NYer and instant gratification runs in my veins, so I probably wouldn't want to venture here again after coming here a few times. It's good, but I'm over it. Stay fat mother suckers"

We visited this brunch spot on a weekend getaway to Montreal. It was recommended and we were excited because, brunch! Tip: We were super early on a Sunday morning (they open at 8) and so glad we got there because it was packed by 9:00 and people were still lining up (they also seems to serve pastries and coffee to go).It's a small space - more narrow than wide with communal style seating as well as smaller tables. When you first walk in, and you are immediately greeted with stacks of beautiful large croissants, golden muffins, and a variety of pastry deliciousness you don't want to look away. Then you are drooling and can't wait to be seated! I was told the brioche comes out at 9:30 or so. Sadly, I didn't get one to go and regretted it later on!As for service. Like I said, we were there shortly after it opened and were seated quickly and served just a fast. We enjoyed breakfast very much and I would certainly go back (early)."

It was freezing cold outside, about -25 Celsius, but since this place has such a hype around it, we decided we would wait until we got in to understand what the hype was all about. We waited for approximately an hour outside, despite it being 2 PM. One thing there is to know about this place is that it's TINY, even the seating area is tiny. They made us sit in an area in front of a window where we were next to each other and not in front of each other, which felt weird. If we were to wait for a table, it could've taken 10-15minutes more. It's also very crowded, and in the winter, it gets fairly loud and hard to hear the conversation you're trying to have. The food itself is good, but a bit overrated and overpriced. I'm eating a sandwich and a soup and I'm paying almost as much as a full meal at other restaurants. Also, it's not like it was the BEST sandwich I've ever had for it to be priced that way.... so I didn't get that part. I had the Mr. Miami sandwich with the soup of the day (which I specified to remove cilantro from and I guess they forgot). I wasn't surprised or really excited about the food, but the desserts were delicious and totally worth the price. I've had a blueberry danoise and a latte. The service was acceptable, they were very crowded so the waitress had a hard time going from table to table in a decent amount of time.

I also recommend getting there in the earlier part of the day bc some of their goods sell out. I ordered the eggs in your face sandwich and the Cha Cha chia bowl. The egg sandwich was probably one of the best I've ever had. The chia bowl was refreshing and the granola that they use is homemade. Super yummy and ingredients fresh. The price reflects the quality of food, so keep that in mind. $13ca for a sandwich and $10ca for the small bowl is a bit steep but we'll worth it."

I was initially disheartened to see the crowd waiting in line, but was pleasantly surprised when we got seated right away once we got the hostess' attention. I think it was because we were a party of 2 and everyone else was waiting for a bigger table. Lesson learned! Always ask!!My partner in crime got the Mr Miami ($14.95) and we both tucked in happily into the piping hot smoked beef brisket sandwich. The pesto and havarti brought a lovely creaminess while the salsa and red onions gave a hint of sweetness. I skipped the menu and asked for a cheese croissant and a palmier from the bakery. The croissant was perfect in texture (I should have asked for it to be heated up), and the Palmier was the sweet touch at the end of the meal. For those who don't know what a Palmier is, it's like the Asain butterfly cookie but much larger and with more textures. The outside is crusted with a sugary almond glaze, while the inner flakes are soft and buttery. Absolutely delicious. I would stop by just to grab one of these!!"

I loved being able to split them with my partner because they tasted really different.The egg panini was amazing, super packed with flavour, a little bit spicy, and just so delicious on its own. The Cuban paired perfectly with the soup and had its own unique flavour. We both felt being able to share made it better because I liked switching up the taste halfway through the meal.On top of that we got a coffee and one of their homemade cookies to go and it was delicious.

I came here with my husband for breakfast and I had their yogurt and granola. If you are a fan of yogurt and granola as I am you will enjoy it very much. What made this plate to me were the fruits . I'm  big on fresh fruit in granola they have that down packed here  and the yogurt and granola was deff homemade you can deff taste the difference. We also had their  chocolate chaud ( hot chocolate) and although it was good I wasn't too impressed by it.  There's deff better hot chaud in the area. Other than that the vibes were great and staff was lovely . If you do end up coming here try and get here by 9:30 am to try their best stuff. We got here around 10 and half of the bakery items we wanted to try were sold out.

We loved our breakfast at Olive & Gourmando on the recommendation of a local, and have shared it with anyone traveling there since. The cafe is such a cute space and we had no problem getting a table for two at noon on a Friday. There were smaller individual tables, as well as longer community style tables to accommodate parties of any size. We both ordered paninis, not a typical breakfast choice for me, but had zero regrets afterwards. The coffee and tea were great, but the food is what really shined. The egg panini was the perfect blend of ""sweet"" and spicy with the pairing of the meat and cheese, while the Gustavo was so rich and creamy. We both swapped off on each of the paninis and had nothing but rave reviews for both of them, you couldn't go wrong. For a not huge space, we weren't rushed out at all and got some great service."
/user_details?userid=Zg6Y4E3zYhzly2jk5wTi4g,Josh P.,"Glenview, IL",2 star rating,"I came to Olive & Gourmando upon recommendation of a friend who had recently visited Montreal.  Given the location, ambiance, and reputation, I wasn't surprised that there was a bit of a wait.  The host did a reasonable job managing the queue, although the entry area did get uncomfortably cramped, as many people waiting for their tables refused (for some reason) to wait out on the street, even though the host made an effort to call names both inside and outside.Upon being seated at a small communal high-top table, our order was taken in a reasonable amount of time: a few egg sandwiches, a pastry, coffees, and a side of fruit.  Our coffees were delivered soon thereafter, and my dining companion decided to order an additional pastry, which was -- (at this point in our dining experience) confusingly -- brought to the table before the one that had been previously ordered.After some time had passed, our server stopped by to check in on us, and we confirmed everything was fine.  As we continued to wait, we chocked up the delay in our food being delivered to the somewhat lackadaisical ethos of Québécois service standards.  Many minutes later, however, another server (manager perhaps?) stopped by to inquire if all was well.  I told her that we were simply waiting for our food, at which point she assured us it would be ready very shortly.She then headed towards the food preparation area to consult with our initial server, with both sharing furtive glances in our direction and the one consulting his order notepad with the other.  The second server returned to our table and asked if we had ordered anything in addition to the coffees and single pastry which we had thus far enjoyed.  We informed her of our full order, which had been placed probably 20-30 minutes prior, which seemed to come as something of a shock to her.  She assured us she would handle the error.Now, without having explicitly acknowledged it as such, it was clear that the initial server had neglected to put in our full order.  My expectation (perhaps unreasonable) was that the manager would expedite our ticket to ensure our already long wait did not become unreasonable.  Unfortunately, this does not appear to have been the case, as we waited an additional 20 or so minutes for our food to finally arrive.I will say that the food was thoroughly enjoyable, a generous serving, if a bit overpriced, but acceptable given the clear popularity of the establishment.  My issue here is that nobody ever acknowledged the error or offered much in the way of apology, and our initial server was never to be seen again, unable to own up to a simple and understandable mistake during a rushed brunch service.We decided ultimately to tip rather modestly, which unfortunately would not have been the case had the server/manager merely acknowledged the issue and offered, perhaps, to comp our pastries or drinks."

My Poached Egg On Your Face was the perfect combination of flavors and textures that has me salivating now just thinking about it. The bread had that toasted crispiness that made you want to take the next bite before you were even done chewing the last one. The eggs sandwiched inside were not-overcooked-and-not-overdone-but-actually-just-right. Then those roasted tomatoes, gooey cheese, and the perrrrrrfect amount of spiciness took this dish to another level. I'm not even a sandwich person and I could eat this thing on a regular basis. We enjoyed our meal so much that we came back the next day for the Cha-Cha-Chia bowl (also excellent) and warm Banana Chocolate Brioche fresh out of the oven. Thanks to the live waitlist on Yelp, we were seated immediately upon arrival for both visits. Great food, excellent service, and beautiful, rustic decor to boot!

But it's so cute and perfect!They cranked people out pretty quick though so we really only had to wait about 20 min.

Olive & Gourmando appeared to be a great option in the heart of where I wanted to putter around so I pointed my cab driver in this direction and away we went. When we pulled up in my cab I saw the long line of folks waiting outside and I grew immediately concerned. I just wanted something tasty but quick so I could get to wandering. Sure enough, the wait was about 30 minutes. But, lucky for me, since I was solo diner I was able to be seated right away at the window bar in the back of the restaurant.It was super tight back there and not a lot of room to move, but it was quite alright because I wasn't there to linger anyway. I ordered a sandwich (The Pomme) and an iced tea and settled into my map to figure out where to go first. After a few minutes, my sandwich came out, smelling amazing and looking delicious. The Pomme is a panini of sorts filled with double smoked bacon, housemade walnut butter, sliced apples, garlic vinaigrette, and cheddar. So so good. It's also HUGE. I could only get through 2/3rds before calling it quits. FYI-- the bread gets super crispy from the toasting/press, and I totally cut up the roof of my mouth trying to wolf that thing down. No regrets, though! After I finished I cashed out and ordered a latte and a sweet treat at the coffee bar inside for the road. The pastries looked amazing and I almost bought a few to take with me but I didn't want to be bogged down with bags while sightseeing so I just got a chocolate turtle bar in the end. This was maybe my highlight of the trip here. I have a real sweet tooth and this did the trick. It had a layer of thick, dark ganache, followed by a layer of pecans mixed into a gooey rich caramel, followed by a buttery shorbread base holding it all together. Damn good. I wish I had gotten another one for later. Latte was also really well done.The space is small but cozy and the decor, a mix of wood with a flora and fauna feel, felt welcoming. I'd definitely return here on a future visit. I'd just plan for a wait if I'm not flying solo."

I had the Mac and Cheese with mushrooms and truffle tapenade with a side salad. A great balance with the two items on my plate. The Mac and cheese was flavorful and didn't feel heavy. Loved the crunchy topping. My daughter had the grilled cheese with the homemade ketchup. Normally would not eat it with ketchup but this was sweet and a nice compliment. The raclette cheese in it was a nice bonus. My friend loved her oeuf croquette. A busy place. Loved it!"

It is always busy, so be prepared to wait a bit, but the quality of food and service and atmosphere is definitely worth it. If you have the Yelp app, I recommend you get on their waitlist as this will expedite your seating. The gluten-free food options are a bit limited; however, what they have was excellent. The restaurant has been operating in Old Montreal for 20 years so they know what they're doing. Originally, it was a bakery and still is; however, it's also now an awesome restaurant. The menu is quite simple and they just do an awesome job at the items they offer. Everything is made fresh and many of the items will sell out during the day, so don't delay if you see an item you really like. We visited this establishment twice during our visit as it was so good.  On my first visit, I had the Mr. Miami and my wife had the Salade Verte Pollo with extra avocado. The highlight, though for me, was the potato salad side. This is made fresh so be prepared to wait. However, it's the most amazing item on the menu for me.  The restaurant uses a team approach to service and all associates are extremely friendly, outgoing, and happy to assist in anyway. The restaurant is small, but I counted 10 associates serving that guests.  They're all very informed on gluten-free and other food allergies.  The restaurant tends to be a little bit on the noisy side as you would normally experience with a popular and great restaurant.  The music, atmosphere, and ambience is very chic and cool.   On our first visit, we were tucked away at the front window which gave an excellent viewpoint for people watching and greater privacy and insulation from all the action.  Definitely this is an awesome restaurant and a must visit for anyone visiting Montreal."

Fresh, crispy bread that doesn't feel heavy. Just phenomenally executed.Knocking off a star because the pastries aren't to my liking but a matter of preference. The texture is more heavy and doughy than I prefer my viennoiseries, though the taste is decent. Next time, I'll skip the sweet stuff and go straight for their savory sandwiches and tartines.Oeufs Coquette - Two poached eggs in creamy dill sauce, with tomato, chickpeas, avocado and some other stuff. Rich but tempered with the tang from the tomato sauce to balance it out. Bread was really tasty too.Ham & Cheese Tartine - A nice slice of bread, toasted and with the structure to hold up the savory ingredients. Well balanced, savory, satisfying.Tartine - The cheese really pulls it together. I'd say there's too much raw vegetables going on that don't get blended in well but otherwise very good. Enjoyed the freshness of the ingredients, almost like a salad on top of the bread.Cuban Panini - Really hit the spot, high quality ingredients, the cheese, ham and mayo come together well without overwhelming.Chausson Aux Pommes - A fairly tasty apple turnover, but not mind blowing. My favorite of the viennoiseries I had, the puff pastry was as expected. The filling was not too sweet (a good thing), real apple chunks and a juicyness without being soggy, coarse sugar granules coated the outside.Chocolate Brioche - The bread was very heavy and dense, I was expecting lighter and more buttery. Pastry was a bit on dry side. A miss for me.Almond Croissant - Denser and sweeter than I expected. It's heavy and bready rather than the light, flaky puff pastry."

We chose the latter. After being seated, we ordered pretty quickly. I had the grilled cheese and potato salad. Both were good, but not worth an hour wait.

It's a cute little coffee shop/resto. They have a small menu that's limited with what you can order during the week and weekend. They have a lot of salad options. I decided to go for the grilled cheese sandwich. I didn't enjoy it much because of the caramelized onions that were quite bitter. They serve it with their house ketchup which was very good. I also ordered a latte which was the perfect drink to have after work on a windy day. My friend ordered a salad with bread. I loved their bread. It was very soft and tasty. The best part was the extra large cookie we had for dessert. It was cold though and we asked if they can warm it in a microwave and they said no. However we still enjoyed it very much! They have a huge selection of baked goods and patisserie. My friend recommended to go their on the weekend for breakfast which I will probably. I wasn't too impressed with their menu or food. The server said it changes with season, so everything my friend had in the past wasn't available. Our server was very nice and helpful explaining the menu and our options.

The mango was perfectly ripened and sweet to counterbalance the savory cajun chicken.The garden salad was phenomenal as well. They don't gyp you on the greens and lentils.

Place is small and loud and bustling.Food: Poached egg on your face panini. Perfectly cooked eggs, with a little bit of a kick to it. The boyfriend got the pizza pocket and that was deliciously warm and kind of sweet. Both sandwiches were reasonably priced.What takes the cake here are the desserts. Although I was bummed because they didn't have the banana chocolate brioche, we tried the raspberry white chocolate brioche. That pastry was all around soft, sweet and tart and just very, very delicious. Also took a chocolate cooke and lemon poppy seed cookie home and those were moist, tangy, and rich. I love their pastries.Service: Awesome. Friendly. They take american credit cards too.I would definitely come again the next time I visit Montreal."

We saw that Olive & Gourmando had high marks, so we headed over on the metro. The place is small, but crowded. There was about a 15-20 minute wait. We were seated along the window which was fine because we could people watch.My friend ordered Mr. Miami which she said was good. I ordered The Majestique. It was a huge entree, but it was so good. The apple coleslaw and pickled corn+jalapeños were delicious accompaniments. The slaw was more sweet & tangy rather than jalapeño spicy. It was one of my favorite meals in Montreal.Service was good and they accept credit cards. I would highly recommend this place!"

Delicious!! Also, while we sat there, the table next to use had  their savory sandwiches brought over and I immediately got food envy.  Wish I had more time in this city :( I would definitely come back here for lunch.

The name is misleading since tbe dish has only one egg and an extra one costs $2.50.It was delicious but a little too fancy and expensive for what you get.

/user_details?userid=GZHw4Jp2sap9PjcQWG6AfQ,Mary K.,"Chattanooga, TN",4 star rating,"Olive & Gourmando, a hidden gem near old Montreal, truly captured what it means to be a great local restaurant. The food, ranging from beautiful pastries to crusty sandwiches to a decked out hot dog, stole the show, while the atmosphere added to the experience of a great place to eat. Olive & Gourmando is the perfect equation: close enough to old Montreal+not being a tourist trap+a trendy atmosphere+fairly priced food=a great place for breakfast, lunch, or late lunch (I believe it closes at 4). My family ordered the Mr. Miami sandwich, the Cuban sandwich, normal and almond croissants, and the hot dog. All of the food was incredible, but my favorite was the Mr. Miami--salty, sweet, crusty, and warm. I'd definitely recommend it. Although the almond croissant was not my favorite (it was a bit less flaky and more sticky than the normal), it was still tasty. The decor in this restaurant ranges from hipster to woodsy, and it works perfectly with the cool yet laid back vibe. If I came to Montreal, I would definitely come back for a cute and tasty brunch/lunch."

We order ""Mr Miami"" and ""The Cuban""The waitress are so busy and very efficient. The food was served in super hot (it's hard to hold it at first). You can tell it just came out from the panini machine.  The taste is amazing on both sandwiches. I'm so happy with our food. After lunch, we order Coffee and cappuccino with brownie. The coffees taste ok but not as amazing as the paninis. The brownie is very strong/compact chocolate. Very sweet which goes well with black coffee. It's taste but it's not my favorite one. And it was kind of hard to eat. I will guess it was not their strength point."
/user_details?userid=ZKr4YuXdzq41sVk-_29k-w,Franki H.,"New Haven, CT",5 star rating,"We came here on our first morning in Montreal. We were just visiting for a few days, so we just researched on a lot of reviews and then came here based on that. We were able to find street parking nearby just one short block over, so that was no trouble. This place is in a really cute little area of Old Montreal so the buildings around are cool to see. Upon arrival, we did have a short wait in a scrunched line by the door, but it went pretty fast and I'd say we were seated in around 10, maybe 15 minutes. The spot we ended up sitting at was on the corner of a long bar on the window and it was very intimate and close, but we were able to see into the kitchen and watch our food being prepared, so it was kinda cool. Only the getting in and out of the spot was a bit uncomfortable. Overall, this place had a cramped feel, so if that isn't your thing, maybe skip.Service-wise, everything here was great. They helped us English-speakers with an English menu and served us in English so we didn't have to use our poor French! This is the norm in Montreal, but still good to know going in if you don't speak French, just say so and they'll get you an English menu and help you in English. Food though, oh man! We had a butter croissant and a cheese croissant and the fresh ricotta with bread. The cheese croissant was the best croissant I've ever had. It was so buttery and flakey it left a sheen of butter on my fingertips and had such flavor. The cheese one compared to the plain butter was just so much better because the cheese gave it such a nudge up in flavor that really completed it for us. The fresh ricotta was so light and perfect for starting a day with a lot of eating, which is how all my vacation days go. It was beautifully presented with salt and the flavor was really well-balanced between the honey and the cheese and it was just really good. Totally glad we stopped here, it was a wonderful introduction to the food scene of Montreal."

Checked it off the restaurant bucket list.I know this place gets a bad rep for the price, wait, and service.The food is insanely expensive. But I think it's all part of their business model. They are so popular right now and tourists are willing to pay that much so why shouldn't they charge that much? It is going to stop me from going often but it did make me want to try it.The wait time is ridiculous. My Boyfriend and I got lucky, we only waited 15 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. I left my name with the guy who does the seating and he told me it was a 30 minute wait. So we left and walked around for 15 minutes before my boyfriend told me we might have a chance at getting in earlier because people probably don't show up for their reservations and he was right! We got in ahead of 3 other couples who were no shows. I thought the service was slow but I understand that with the volume of people, it gets a little hectic. I personally thought everyone was really nice and helpful.Now, the food!I got the soup of the day. Black bean with porc and yoghurt with some avocado and tortilla chips. It was great! Best soup I've had in a while. It was super creamy and tasty. Made me feel full and happy.My boyfriend got the OG grilled cheese with a green salad. The salad was ordinary but the grilled cheese was delicious! It had caramelized onions which I'm usually not a fan of but they were excellent. It also came with some homemade ketchup that really complemented the grilled cheese. The food is worth it in my opinion. But don't go with a group of people or with friends. Go with someone you know who doesn't mind waiting and doesn't mind the prices. It's really not for everyone and I was lucky my boyfriend enjoyed it. It's not family friendly since the space is so tiny and the seating so limited."

Oh my gosh this was the best soup I've ever had. Along with the soup my friend and I shared the grilled cheese sandwich this was the perfect lunch. I was nursing a cold so I ordered a hot spiced bourbon drink which was also very tasty. We came back for breakfast a few days later. The breakfast menu is a bit limited.

Parking spots were hard to find, so we had to park a few streets away from this place. [SERVICE] - 5/5Our server was friendly. The wait time was 45 minutes, but we left our phone number so we could walk around, and the hostess gave us a call 5 minutes before our table was ready. [DÉCOR] - 4/5 Very small, intimate, and homey vibes. There were a lot of people when we went at around 2PM on a Saturday. They had a takeout area for pastries and hot drinks if you just want to order something to go, or while you wait for a seat. [QUALITY] - 5/5Fresh ingredients and homemade recipes. I totally understand why this place was so crowded! The food was really, really good.  [ORDER] - 4/5- The Gustavo Panini - $14.95: BEST. PANINI. EVER. The yogurt & roasted garlic marinated chicken was so juicy & complemented the roasted mushrooms and grilled red onion. The whole panini was glued together with with maple and Dijon mayonnaise and melted Havarti cheese. - The Cubain Panini- $13.95: Basically a next-level ham and cheese sandwich. Pancetta (Italian bacon) and roasted pork were very flavourful but a little too salty in my opinion. The lime and cilanto cut through the richness of the pork and melted gruyère cheese. The panini was brought together with a tangy pickle mayonnaise. [OVERALL] - 5/5Before I came here, I thought a panini was just a panini. But boy, I was SUPER glad I tried the ones here. Although both paninis were delicious, The Gustavo was much juicier and the medley of flavours were better than The Cubain. Overall, this place was worth the wait, and I would definitely recommend The Gustavo Panini."

Have been wanting to try their cold veggie sandwich, but by the time I got there I settled for a blueberry scone and an Americano. Being a baker and being fond of scones I must say this was one of the flakiest, layered scones I've had. What I did wish for was for some spread of some sort (some cream) on the side. Call me snobby, but one has to have something to spread on the scone as you sit and sip on a nice cup of coffee or tea. And when you're paying close to $5 for a scone, you deserve it;) maybe even warmed up as well. Might go back to try their cold vegan sandwich, but would be more tempted if they had a hot vegan sandwich on the menu, especially when it's cold out and you're looking for something warm."

IT IS A GODSEND. The berry pie bar was very dense, but in a good way. We also got the pistachio lemon bar. Just the right amount of sweet and tart, and I loved the crunch the pistachios gave in the middle. Finally, the citron cookie also had a bit of a coconutty flavor to it. The lemon was obviously not as pronounced as in the lemon bar, but the light tinge complemented the white chocolate chips well.Their cappucino and drip coffee came in big portions, and tended to sway more on the bitter side. Not in a bad way though! I quite enjoyed it. Anyways, would love to come back and try their sandwiches, but even their last pick baked goods were delicious."

/user_details?userid=PEAqa0nKpB154asokAUHUg,Meghan O.,"Ashburn, VA",5 star rating,Amazing food! We shared the grilled cheese and super heathy salad and it was the perfect balance. The grilled cheese is heavy so half a sandwich was more than enough. The almond croissant was okay nothing to write home about. The dirty chai was just the way I like it - flavorful but not too sweet. Would definitely recommend this place for lunch! Keep in mind they don't take reservations and it's first come first serve and your entire party must be present to be seated.

I didn't stay for a sit-down meal (I just got my food to go), but the restaurant had nice decor and looked like a cozy place to start the morning (provided you could get a table).I ordered the chocolatine and the highly-praised ""egg in your face"" panini. The chocolatine wasn't that good - not sure if I'd recommend O+G for pastries - but the panini was amazing. It was loaded with eggs and meat, and it had just the right spice level (usually French food has zero spice). It was a delicious and hearty way to start the day.So if you're hankering for a tasty breakfast, give O+G a try - just make sure you arrive early!"

Yes, it's true that the banana-chocolate brioche is yummy, but they also have wonderful salads and sandwiches, including the intriguing offering of grilled cheese with ketchup and caramelized onions. I enjoyed the Cuban, oozing with gruyere and slightly spicy. Overall: Classy yet casual. Possibly crowded. Lovely. Yummy."

Waited 45 mins for a table which wasn't a problem as there are many nearby interesting boutiques and galleries to explore! They seated us at a very tight table for three that was super uncomfortable and felt like we were always in the way. We were starving, so ordered an assortment of the pan fried panini type sandwiches, and juices and coffees. Everything was delivered promptly, great quality and taste, but we really couldn't fit the food on the table at the same time as the drinks, and there was no way to address the space issue, except to hurry up and eat and leave. I'd go again, but maybe during the week when it's not as crowded perhaps."

/user_details?userid=Fae_znodNFsEH1HQFz4OiQ,Maike E.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"This place is INSANELY popular. Insanely. As in people are crowded into the front section and spilling out into the streets, waiting. There's an online waitlist which they don't pay attention to, so don't bother with that. I suppose everyone who's visiting sees all the reviews and wants to try it out. Fair enough, that was us too. As a side effect, they can charge what they want. There's i think only 4 sandwiches subject to availability with absolutely no changes. Technically, if you're assembling a sandwich, how hard is it to leave off a pickle? But i suppose for the sake of streamlining and getting through the crowd, they just keep pumping out pre-assembled sandwiches and heat as needed. Essentially this is a coffee shop style casual lunch spot that can charge what they want cos they have the demand. I got the egg on your face sandwich which was certainly quite tasty. I expected an oozing poached egg, but it seemed to be diced small and sprinkled on, which was fine. But, $16 for a sandwich and no sides... 4.50 for a biscuit, cookie or choc croissant and 5 for the almond one everyone raves about. Essentially 25% more than most other places. So $22 for a good sandwich and pretty average choc croissant , strikes me as really quite expensive and I just did take out!  Add on a coffee and maybe a side and you're closer to $40, which is a bit much.  Anyway, if you want a good, creative sandwich and you're happy with the premium charge, go for it. The coffee is really good, but the crowds are a pain to deal with."

I remember going the first time and I raved about the beef brisket panini and a shashuka dish. I went again the time after hoping for a similar experience but I was so disappointed. Nothing too crazy or different about their breakfast sandwiches and their sandwiches are premade so we couldn't ask for anything without cheese. The best thing we ordered was a potato salad side, it was warm and flavourful but still nothing extremely out of the ordinary. Overall super cute place and it's usually packed, I personally haven't gone back since but you should try at least once."

We enjoyed the stellar selection of baked goods, great coffee, loaded granola yogurt, and the paninis. Really wanted the poached egg panini, but they were sold out. Experience would have been better if we weren't packed like sardines in there. Service was friendly but forgetful. Our server didn't provide some essential items like utensils, napkins, and side plates for items, then cleared them too soon and never brought more out. It was difficult to reach her during our meal. It's definitely worth a visit, but expect a tight squeeze. I recommend going during off peak hours or grabbing a coffee and pastry to go."

I cannot recommend it enough, and it's no surprise that it's on every ""best place to eat"" list out there online. Reviews don't lie and neither does the food. I went here on one of the coldest days of the year and was a little nervous that there would be a wait. There was, but not for long. After about 15-20 minutes for them to call and let us know that a table was available - not long at all if you're accustomed to typical brunch culture, lines rounding street corners. We were seated quickly thereafter and got our cappucino's, which were amazing!! (I would recommend getting the large size if you're going to have a meal as well). The menu is small but everything on it sounds amazing! I ended up getting the poached egg in your face panini which was to die for!! I cannot recommend it enough. Definitely a must-try. It has the perfect amount of spice, just enough to add flavour, and the cheese was just perfectly melted. The portion sizes here are also great and will keep you full. My mom ordered the salty ricotta! The ricotta was so fresh and lightly sweetened with the honey and orange zest. The bread they served with it, perfectly crusty. After reading much about the croissants and how amazing they were we ordered the almond croissant as a side and damn, it did not disappoint. It was perfectly flaky and buttery.

The waiter initially told us we needed to wait 45 mins for a table of 5, then suggested splitting us up which would seat us immediately. It was super awkward. My friend and I went to a table while the other 3 waited. There were clearly tables that we're going to be empty very soon, but he seated us at the other end of the restaurant. After my friend spoke to him he came and got us and voila! A table for 5 magically appeared. It was a crummy awkward start to the meal.The service was pretty horrible. We grabbed our own menus. No one explained anything to us (like how we can order off the breakfast as well as the lunch menus, and they were 2 physically separate menus). I ended up getting the habibi chicken sandwich. The only egg option was the poached eggs and they had RUN OUT OF EGGS. I was in need for protein. Unfortunately they also didn't have French toast. The sandwich was cold (yes I get it it's called a cold sandwich but it was too cold), jam packed with a handful of dill!!!! Wow way too much.

Dont even try to rush you to open up your seat to move new customers through, in fact both times I had to notify them I was ready for my check rather than them asking if I was ready (which is far more traditional in Europe than in NA).Fully recommend it when in Montreal and I will be back."

I had an almond croissant for breakfast that was, again, flaky and wonderful, but also the perfect amount of sweetness. My latte was fantastic with a rich, creamy foam that was SO GOOD. I wish their menu had more of a selection though or offered sides like 2 eggs because it's a really carb heavy meal. Regardless, you must come here and treat yourself to a delicious baked good (or 2 or 3) and a latte.

I asked to switch mine to one with no shot, and my friend kept one with the shot cause he didn't want it to go to waste. Our server had offered to charge the regular price for both drinks, but when the bill came, the alcoholic one was $12 and the regular was $4.50. We had also ordered two sandwiches on whole wheat, and they both came on white. We didn't even bother letting our server know, as we didn't want to waste the sandwiches.Besides that, I thought the ambiance was great and the food was good. We ordered the roast beef panini sandwich and the cuban pork one. Hands down preferred the roast beef one. Would've loved to try the cajun chicken sandwich too, as it was on a different thicker fluffier bun (the table beside us ordered that one and it looked awesome).Got some pastries to go - berry square and strawberry rhubarb muffin. The berry square was really good, the muffin was ok.All in all, I think this is a neat place, but not sure if I would wait in line again for a table here.

My husband and I shared the ricotta toast and the yogurt & granola bowl. I can't believe I am rating a restaurant 5 stars of two dishes that might be some of the simplest food you can eat. HOWEVER, Olive & Gourmando serves up some of the lightest, freshest dishes you could ever ask for. Their ricotta toast comes with whipped ricotta, sprinkled with honey and orange zest, served along with thick, oh-so-delicious toast. The yogurt and granola bowl was the best I've ever had. Fresh yogurt and even fresher fruit. Being from America, I am used to all the (what I call) ""sad"" fruit; melon, grapes cantaloupe.

/user_details?userid=T2cMVZHbJf8ITPTRzrh-3Q,Everett B.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"Olive & Gourmando was my favorite of all of the stellar brunch spots that we tried in Montreal. The food was delicious, but most of the city seemed to think the same thing judging by the large influx of people on a workday. Still a nice find in a nice city. The long and short of it:1. Sandwiches. I had the ""Poached Egg on Your Face"" sandwich and can honestly say that it was easily in the top 5 breakfast sandwiches I've ever had (and I loves me some breakfast sammys). The sandwich was on the larger side (had to over-eat to finish it...... no regrets) and was oozing plenty of delicious cheese. This made me want to try their grilled cheese as well.... which will have to wait until next time. My vegetarian fiance had the Vegan 3.0 and that was absolutely delicious as well, and also a good sized sandwich. All in all we were both really impressed with the food and I will gladly come back next trip to try a few more dishes.2. Pastries. Olive has a large case of fresh baked pastries that we munched on while we waited. They were out of a few things that we wanted to try so it might be best to hit the pastry shelf right away if you intend to get one. We had an almond and a cheese croissant which were both delicious. A nice add-on to any breakfast or brunch.3. Wait. We managed to hit that magical hour between breakfast and lunch on a weekday, and still ended up waiting 25 minutes. It became overly packed after we had sat down and the lunch hour rolled in. I would try to go on an off hour unless you don't mind waiting a decent amount because by the time we left there was easily an hours worth of people, though I'm sure some were getting their orders to go.4. Veggie Friendly. There are a few vegetarian friendly items (usually I'd exclude grilled cheese because its just bread and cheese but damn did theirs look good). Always nice when the vegetarians at the table have more than 1 or 2 choices.5. Price. For what you get I actually think Olive is priced very solidly. $10 - $15 for a sandwich (keep in mind that's Canadian) but the portions are large enough that you'll probably end up taking half home. Throw on a pastry and that a solid breakfast and lunch. Works for me every time.I wish I was a bit closer to Olive & Gourmando, instead of an entire country away. Still it's nice to have a great place in your back pocket for when you head back to Montreal. I was impressed with this place and plan to head back whenever I'm in the neighborhood!Overall Grade: A"
/user_details?userid=6nh9zMJKYQxkNYnjvlaebQ,Nikki G.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I was very excited to visit Olive & Gourmando after hearing so much about the place. However, my visit in May was a disappointment in more ways than one.I had the oeuf croquette which was a sad muddle of eggs, tomato, chickpeas, etc.- all I could really taste was the tomatoes. The bread that came with it was good; that's about all that's positive I can say of the meal (perhaps the fault lay in my ordering)What truly made it a terrible experience however, was the way the waitress (whose name I'll leave out) spoke to one of my friends. My friend mentioned how we couldn't enjoy our meals because of our seating arrangement- we didn't expect anything to change, just a statement of our lack of enjoyment after waiting for over an hour to sit. In response, the waitress literally snapped at my friend, creating a scene- the people at the nearby table looked up in surprise, and perhaps noting her behavior, she did not even return to our table with the check. Till now, I wonder if being four young women of color had anything to do with how we were treated, because I can't imagine her talking to someone older this way. We paid our bill in shock (I wish we hadn't in retrospect) and exited as soon as possible. When we later called the manager to express disappointment at the way we were treated, we were insulted and hung up on.This is a very popular restaurant and I'm sure the famous brioches are good enough to keep people coming. I'm sure most people who visit have no altercation and leave happy. BUT their response to our small problem was inexcusable. It was hands-down the worst service experience I've ever had in my life and I will never return, nor will recommend, this place to any acquaintance. If someone from the restaurant reads this, please be kind and respectful to all your customers in the future, and try not to take advantage of your popularity. Best."

We arrived around noon and it was packed, we went inside and put our names on the list, we waited about an hour before being seated, I was starving and the waiter wasn't coming by fast enough for me. After another 15 minute wait inside our waiter showed up and took our order. Thankfully our ordered arrived 10 minutes after, we started off with the soup of the day, which was a very luscious tomato soup with chunks of sweet potatoes, carrots, celery, wild rice and chick beans. It was one of the best soups I have ever had.I had ordered the Miami sandwich, which consisted of smoked beef brisket, grilled red onions, cilantro pesto mayo, havarti,  and a pineapple and jalapeño salsa on the side. Wow! What a great combination, the panini was pressed with grill marks on it, the cheese was oozing out. The pesto mayo just brought all the flavors together. We also had a fresh baked chocolate cookie with a blueberry tart. Very fresh, sweetness was just enough not overly sweet.Altogether, it was a great experience, the wait was certainly worth it.  Everything we tried was delicious from the drinks to the food and desserts. No wonder they have such high ratings."

Yes you will have to wait but get a coffee and an amazing cheese biscuit and wait! Its worth it. We arrived around 11 am on a Thursday and the line was out of the door. We grabbed a coffee and was blown away by their cheese biscuit. It was moist with a crunchy top and had a nice spice of heat to it. The spice was mellowed out by the creamy cheddar cheese and pillowy inside. NO BUTTER NEEDED!!! Its in there! We were sated by the window on bar stools which gave a great view of the passerbys. We ordered the CHA CHA CHIA bowl which has this fruity chia pudding topped with spiced bananas and coconut. It tasted like Autumn in a bowl with the beautiful nutmeg/cinnamon/cardamon spices. It was very filling. We also ordered the Poached egg on your face"" Panini. OH MY LAWD!!! This panini is made up of the most amazing bread with spicy poached eggs and smokey, juicy speck! The herbs and raw milk cheese calms the palette after the spicy sriracha takes over your taste buds. The best panini I have ever eaten. The first bite of crunchy/spicey/smokey/ooey/gooey/ cheesy flavor bomb explosion will have you spoiled forever!!!!!!! They have a huge case of fresh pastries too. We had the Almond Croissant. SOOOOO flakey and almondy and buttery.. ALL OF THE WORDS WITH THE ""Y's""!! The staff is over accommodating even though they are so busy and running around like crazy.

We tried the following: -- Hot Panini: it was delicious, had all the right flavors, I would give it 4 stars. -- Soup of the day: The tomato soup served that day was with out a doubt the best tomato soup I have ever had. We were trying to figure out all of the ingredients that went in to making it, but fell short of a few not-so-obvious ones. Our server was so kind she wrote all the ingredients down on a list for us. I would give it a 6/5:yes it was that good.-- Tartine(Vegan): Not like I have had my fair share of Tartines, but I'm confident that this one would be extremely hard to beat. The medley of flavors blended so well together - certainly one of the most satiating meal I have ever had. 5 stars! -- Mocha: Epic. Ambience: It's a beautiful setting, the only thing I felt was tables could be a little far apart and they might want to keep a larger waiting area. But apart from that, not a thing I can complaint about. I highly recommend this place for brunch."

Expect a wait at pretty much any time, especially during peak hours.

Came here on Sunday around 1pm to a decent crowd. The hostess said to expect around 20 minutes but it seemed all the existing party of 2's that were waiting before us disappeared so the actual time was much less. Any party more than 4 would take a lot longer I assume, as the place is very tiny. We were greeted right away and made sure to put in our 'appetizer' of a banana/chocolate pastry. We then ordered our dishes of the cubain sandwich & the Tartine. Pastry - honestly nothing out of this world, but it was very tasty. Especially as you get more into the insides of the pastry where you can discover all the ooey-gooey goodness. 4 stars. The Tartine - as I'm writing this a week later I'm in full depression mode. This thing was UNREAL. Check the photo below. Yes it's a bit pricey at $18 but they pile this thing up. There's no skimping. It was the most satisfying combination of sweet to salty to refreshing to filling. I'd recommend this over and over again. 1 million stars. The Cuban - came to us fresh out of the oven, had to take a bit to cool. So much meat & cheese with some awesome - but not overpowering - sauces. If you like classic Cubans, this will not disappoint. 5 stars. Service was quick, as they're trying to get customers in/out as quick as possible, which we preferred. Also perfect location smack dab in Old Montreal."

A few savory items (1 panini I think and maybe 1or 2 more). We happened to arrive around 10. ALL savory items were sold out. We were starving and very disappointed we could only order pastries and coffee to eat. The pastries themselves were ok but NOT worth the wait. Some sold out as we attempted to order it. This spot is a total tourist trap. You can have a better and cheaper breakfast elsewhere in Montreal. Skip it if you can. Maybe go for lunch? Didn't get a chance to try the savory food but judging from the pastries we had I would pass altogether.

The mac and cheese was really good, I'm glad that it contained real mushrooms to add an earthy touch. The panini was solid, just a little plain. We got a chocolate brioche to go and oh man it had so much chocolatey goodness it was so goddam delicious. Would recommend for brunch."

/user_details?userid=aR6vaoYj_SuTmz7EZLe41g,Irene T.,"Vaughan, Canada",3 star rating,"I wish I had done more research on this place. I was excited to try their acclaimed sandwiches, but when I arrived in the AM hours, I was unfortunately notified that it was too early to serve those items and was presented with a breakfast menu. I opted for the Chia Bowl/Pudding. Food arrived fairly quickly, and I noticed the crowd that gathered ranged from businessmen on a morning meeting, to runners who were grabbing a quick bite. There were also several people on their electronics doing their own work. As for the Chia Bowl, I was pleasantly surprised for the first bite as it had the right amount of crunch and sweetness in it. However, this quickly became a dish that couldn't maintain its initial appeal. I eventually grew sick of the dish halfway through. I am not one to leave food unfinished but I did just that with this dish. With about 5 spoonfuls left, I betrayed my family's teachings to never leave food unfinished and asked my server for the bill. Simply put, the flavour just grew too bland with each bite I took. Verdict: A cute little cafe to get work done. Service is friendly, but I can't say I can wholly recommend the Chia Bowl/Pudding given my experience with the item. It wasn't a bad dish, but it didn't stand out either."

I do prefer going during the early part of the day, as the lighting for the photos is better and I love getting the window seats to be able to look outside at the cute Old Port views. They make decent coffee, but my heart belongs to their pastries and grilled cheese. Their croissants are fluffy and soft inside, one of the best I have ever had. Their grilled cheese sandwich consists of caramelized onions and a variety of cheeses: Raclette and Gouda. This breathtaking sandwich also comes with homemade ketchup, amazing! If you're looking for brunch, I really enjoyed their homemade granola (which is actually gluten free). It's a bit of a healthy option if you're feeling guilty from that grilled cheese at the last visit lol"
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Overall, I loved the concept and execution of the restaurant, though it was a bit pricy for what it was. That being said, the statement is true for almost all places in Old Port. Maybe it was because I didn't come in on the weekend when they have an apparently delectable brunch, but nevertheless, it was still satisfactory.I ordered the raspberry lemonade, the grilled cheese sandwich, and the chocolate banana brioche. First of all, I found the raspberry lemonade slightly disappointing, as it could have used a bit more sugar and more of a fruity flavor. It almost felt as if I was tasting the essence of raspberry rather than the actual fruit at times. The grilled cheese sandwich was a cheesy, gooey, and toasty delight which I loved. The combination of Gouda and raclette cheeses worked extremely well and tasted rich and delicate at the same time, and the caramelized onions added a nice touch of sweetness. I'm not exactly sure if it was worth $12, though.The chocolate banana brioche was definitely the highlight of the meal. It was so moist and, being a sucker for banana bread, I loved how you could see banana chunks actually baked into the bread. I appreciated that the chocolate part of the filling was more along the lines of dark chocolate, as it highlighted the banana flavoring while being deliciously cacao-y in its own right.I paid about $27 (ish) for my meal in total including tips I believe. Was it completely worth it? Not exactly, in my opinion. But I'll be sure to come back sometime for brunch because their options look tantalizing and appealing to my tastes by the looks of it."

Came with my family and tried the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, The Majestic (A large, fully loaded hotdog), and the Elixir drink (an infusion of iced green tea, pomegranate, ginger, and lime).Overall, the food was delicious and unique. The sandwich had a lot of flavor, the mango was a nice touch, and the bread was perfectly soft. The Majestic was a bit difficult to figure out at first, but a solid variety of toppings that made it a solid dish. The Elixir tasted a bit watered down, but was overall a refreshing nice drink.Definitely enjoyed the time here and would happily return to try the other menu items, but only downside was that the price for the meal was a bit much given the quantity and overall quality."

The only cons were long wait times and limited menu, but I'm not complaining. We came on a Monday and we seated after 10 minutes. The place was packed. You could practically have a convo at normal voice volume with your neighbors. Luckily that didn't bother us (I was just happy we beat the line). I ended up ordering the dirty chai latte, chocolate banana brioche, and poached egg on your face panini. 5/5 for all of it! The panini was so flavorful and filling. It doesn't come with a side but I didn't need one. I enjoyed the fact that it was spicy. The brioche is a must! Literally one of the best pastries I've eaten. So delectable. Totally worth the wait.

Then 15 minutes later, the server says, can you order something besides the vegan sandwich, that order was given to someone else.  That's ridiculous!  So we order a salad that was more expensive and not what we wanted.  Also, as a party of 3 they made us sit at the counter rather than give a table."

We were only in Montreal for one night, but had two of our meals here because it was so delicious. That's all we thought about the whole trip. The first day, we had the Great Big Salad, which had quinoa, alfalfa sprouts, a mix of nuts, microleaves, and galore. It was an unexpected harmonious blend of vegetables, interesting textures, and flavors in your mouth. We had the cuban panini, which was decent but word of advice - stick with the salads here. We also had a latte, which was literally the best latte we've ever had. It was so creamy and flavorful - wait a minute, do Canadians have different milk than us??The second day, we came for breakfast. We had the ricotta, which was very good and was not heavy at all. The cheese was super light and the orange zest really brightened the dish - fireworks in my mouth. We also got the cha-cha-cha-chia seed bowl, which stole the show hands down. There was so much going on in every bite - from the chia pudding, to the granola, to the pumpkin puree, to the nuts they threw into that bowl. Everything tasted like it was individually and thoughtfully selected to bring an ""O"" to your morning ;)We also had the much acclaimed almond croissant, which was BOMB.COM. It wasn't overly sweet or heavy - it was the perfect ending to our trip to Montreal. We would drive 4 hours back to Montreal just to eat here. You should too.

It is loaded with berries and deliciously soaked in sugary goodness. I got the oeuf coquette and it was amazing! There was avocado, tomato, potatoes, fennel, sausage and feta among some of the ingredients paired with two slices of flat bread.

The coffee I decided on was a black roast with nothing held back.  The coffee roared like a lion and left like a lamb.  Delicious strong and robust but smooth and delicate on the palate. Jessica had a latte that screamed sweet nothings in your ear, while you were sleeping. The fresh ricotta spoke volumes with its fresh orange zest sprinkled across the top. The fresh baked bread, accompanying the ricotta was simple yet delicious vessel for the cheese and not taking anything away from the ricotta but bolstering its presence.The ""poached egg on your face"" was simply delightful, spices and meats folded into one another as if holding hands.  The panini lightly toasted was perfect, one thing I can't stand is over cooked bread.  This sandwich was everything I could want as a delicious morning meal."

The mac and cheese and egg on your face panini were both sold out by the time we were able to order. We were told about the mac and cheese when we were seated but only about the panning when we were ordering. I wasn't sure what to order on the spot after that but the waitress jumped in with a great rec. She said ""no one orders the tartine but it's my absolute favorite thing on the menu"" so I ordered it. It was delicious. I ate every bite. The hail Caesar cocktail was delicious and had a unique flavor that I couldn't put my finger on until I realized the carrot in the cocktail was picked.

We gave our name for the wait list and was told 5-10 minutes. The wait was only a few minutes for a shared table which was fine with us. The place is super cozy and love the fresh baked goods on display. We both got paninis which were buttery, and quite filling. I thought both were too salty though. The first few bites were great, but it quickly got too heavy. Next time, will opt of the salad and split the hot dog."

It tasted sooooooo goooooood!! It was crunchy outside and soft inside. I should've asked to heat it a little bit, so that the chocolate would melt a little bit and it would taste better! After my friend arriving, I ordered oeuf coquette as brunch. The taste was ok, not as surprised as the chocolatine.The service was good and the ambiance was good too.Also, this place is very popular. Be ready for lining up for around 30 minutes...But as people say, good food is worth waiting."

I was visiting Montreal for the weekend and decided to try this place which got a lot of great reviews. I ordered the oeuf coquette ($17). I love this dish so much because it has very simple ingredients but they are all fresh! Tomatoes were fresh. Eggs are perfectly done with a runny yolk. The feta and chorizo really added unique flavors to the dish and complemented the tomatoes really well. You know you find a great place when they can turn fresh and simple ingredients into something extraordinary. Combining the right textures and flavors of the different ingredients is like a symphony in my mouth! The down side to this place is that it is crowded andCan get noisy. It opens at 9am and when I get there at 9:45 there was already a line up.

The house made ricotta with the mix of vegetables with the spices and mint mixed in was the perfect combo of flavors and it was refreshing yet indulgent at the same time. We also got an almond croissant and it was perfectly flaky but moist. Would definitely come back! Tips: it was a beautiful day and the wait to get into the restaurant was 75-95 minutes for 2 people at 11:30 on a Saturday. But we were able to go straight to the take out counter and order almost anything from the menu and we took it to go and ate outside on one of the many benches/tables in the area. It took 10 minutes to get our food total!! Loved the whole experience.

/user_details?userid=y0W-UvlUhsh8c-huWXobFw,Tina T.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"I was STARVING when we arrived here. Not the nice, easy-going kind of starving (is anyone ever?), but instead...the HANGRY, get-me-food-right-now kind of starving, so even thought this place was a MUST GO when I was visiting Montreal, the 15-20 minute wait at the door was not pleasing to me. I attempted to convince my partner to go elsewhere, because, when you're hungry, you're delusional. But, he urged me to stay. And, thank goodness, he did. We peeked into a nearby furniture store for 5 minutes, and then came back. Within 10 minutes of being on the list, we were seated. This place is decorated like a plant lover's (me,me,me) dream. Plants are scattered throughout, wooden aesthetic, and even a lovely tree-trunk lighting. However, it's not like a quaint, spacey, relaxing kind of space, because the cafe was super busy. It's okay though. Understandable from the refreshing food and yummy drinks. My partner got the dirty chai, and I got the green tea elixir. Montreal cafe's really do have drinks down, with a perfectly sweetened, perfectly elixered out green tea. I would recommend this drink as a perfect pairing with their sandwiches.My panini was very delicious. I forgot the name, but there was an accompanying mango salsa, with a pesto sauce inside, which was very delicious. I recommend light eaters to share a sandwich and a salad, because we had leftovers from both sandwiches. The BOMBEST thing I had here was definitely the asian soba noodle salad. Due to the very cheesy things we had previously had, a salad seemed like the perfect fit for us. It was a very delicious salad, perfectly dressed with a tangy-sesame dressing. Soba noodles, lima beans, carrots, lettuce, so much health goodness- for a girl that doesn't normally eat salad. I would recommend this salad as a must-order to accompany the paninis. I liked this salad so much and tried to replicate it when I came back to America...but failed. :'(I guess the memory of this salad will live on...until I return here."

We also had a croissant which was perfectly flaky.  We took a chocolate chip pecan cookie to go which was fine. We probably should have tried a palmier instead. Yes, we had to wait for a table.

I understand that when table opens up and there are parties of two waiting, it would be for the restaurant's best interest not to sit me but give priority to parties of two who are waiting in the line behind me. But what I don't understand is that when there were multiple small tables open and no parties of two was waiting, the waiter still refused to sit me there, waiting for parties of two to come. The new comers didn't have to wait and I waited more than 30 minutes and this is unfair. The owner should change the policy and apologize."

It was a bit hectic as you walk in because there is a guy that takes names but he is busy running around most of the time. So people who walk in at the wrong time have no clue who to go to or what the drill is. Basically the other patrons waiting had to tell them where to stand/who to look for. I know this is weird to start off w/ but they had some ridiculously good R&B music playing in the background. Just.... something unique. lol I made sure to tell one of the managers that. My friend and I both got coffees and croissants before our actual meal. Hey, it was vacation! Anyhow it was one, if not the best, butter croissant I've ever had. For the lunch item, we got the spicy panini w/ cheese, eggs, tomatoes, and pork. Since my friend doesn't eat pork, we got it without it and our server promised us it would still be divine. AND IT WAS. Man, Montreal really gets their bread right. I wish for the price that the panini came w/ a small side item but ah well. I think a small side salad would've been the perfect accompaniment. The french toast was different from anything we've ever had. Their syrup was infused w/ orange and their french toast was super thick. The topping wasn't the overly sweet whip cream we were used to but very sour cream-like that gave it some oomph. It came w/ some really interesting nuts and gave a great contrast to all the creaminess. This was probably one of the best meals of my Montreal trip. Yes, the reviews did not steer me wrong."

Think of a bustling, chic, bright and homey environment. Super busy, packed with both locals and tourists, and a community environment you can't help but want to be a part of. Located in Old Montreal, we visited on a Friday afternoon for a quick snack and was enamoured at first sight. Kitschy decor, a wide variety of items on the menu, smiling and friendly servers, clean, welcoming atmosphere, and the decadent smells of baked goods and homestyle cooking.We picked out two (2) items to share for a snack: a) the ""Palmier"" which is basically a half-cookie, half-pastry, adorably nicknamed an ""Elephant Ear"" because of the way it's shaped. It's a French pastry that's sweet, crunchy, and buttery - absolutely delicious, and b) the Almond Croissant, which was chewy, soft, and oozing with butter and flavour. Everything here was a delight - from the food to the servers, to the way you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the social, community atmosphere. There are a lot of tables and counters with stools, but with very minimal spacing in between, so make note that you'll probably be making a friend or two.For two pastries, with tax and tip, we paid around $9.00 (we sat in and opted for table service, hence the tip. However, you still have the choice of purchasing the pastries to-go and enjoying them elsewhere)."

A raspberry and cheese brioche was $4.75, chia seed pudding was $10.00 and coffee was approximately $3.00 each (before tax and tip).   From what I was told, the brioche had great flavouring and was very flakey.  The chia seed pudding had a great fruity flavour but also plenty of protein with the museli and chia seeds.  After 1.5 days of eating junk food, eating this was very refreshing (plus it was the cheapest thing on their brunch menu lol).  It's a great option for healthy eating.  With regards to the coffee, it has a very strong coffee aroma, so if you like it, that's great.  Pro-tip: Get here early as we got there at 8:45 am before opening time and there was already a lineup.  Verdict: Great for tourists and a one-time visit. If you want to save money, just order from the takeout counter."

Give the choice of sitting in a sunlight filled bar seat or waiting for another 30mins, we settled for the extra dose of vitamin D.We ordered the poached egg on your face panini, oquf coquette, caesar, and the elixir + bourbon. The panini was great. The bread was crunchy and fresh while the slow roasted tomatoes complemented the spicy poached eggs perfectly. My companion wasn't too impressed with her oeuf coquette. She felt that there was not enough flat bread to finish the coquette.Be warned if you are a lightweight, the drinks here are very strong. They put an interesting spin on their caesar as it tastes more like a vegetable cocktail than the traditional tomato beverage. The bourbon was nice and strong. The service was okay, but given how popular and crowded this place is, I decided to be lenient in my review on that.We saw all the raving reviews about their almond croissants, but they were all sold out before 11am.

You will wait and wait for a table on a nice weekend.2. Service is only ok. They are so busy that you may be overlooked at times.3. No coffee refills. The coffee is 3$, your meal is over $15, but no refills on coffee.Beyond that...1. The Cuban and egg in your face paninis are both delicious and of a respectable size.2. The chocolate brioche bun (as well as the blueberry) are a meal in themselves. I suggest splitting one of these if you are also having something else! This is one of the best sweet treats I have eaten in a long time.3. The fresh fruit bowl with yogurt is super fresh and delicious.4. The decor in here is fun.

When the food arrived, we were both pleasantly surprised. The panini was a pressed and grilled to a crispy crunch perfection. The Mr. Miami was a play on a Cuban sandwich. In this case, the panini style really made it better by warming up all the meat on the inside. The salad was a simple mixed green salad that was tossed in a delicious vinaigrette.Overall, Olive & Gourmando is a restaurant that I would recommend to anyone visiting Montreal. The small but very busy restaurant makes the time to make everything fresh and by hand. Only using high-quality ingredients that ensure every customer is very satisfied."

/user_details?userid=RTtdNQrhqbcGPARn2A2ifw,Peng L.,"Rosemont, IL",4 star rating,"Heavy snow makes this small country-style even more cozy and desirable. Large chalk written ""homemade"" declares the motto of this shop, homy and friendly. At the same time, the house is bustling with people and action -- while every possible seat has been assigned, the long line still extends outside the door. Well, not really a place for lazy afternoon thoughts and talks. Now we come to the food. The famous almond croissant is a bit overrated for me as it lacks the puffy crispiness of a good croissant. The not so puffy layers are further thickened by sweet filling--the taste is ok, but it takes away the airiness. I would not recommend unless you enjoy more chewy croissant. The brownie is definitely a winner. Soft chocolate in between tenderly baked brownie crust, yet you don't really feel the layers because they melt in the month with the perfect blend of cocoa-sharpness and sweetness. The white chocolate biscuit is good but not impressive. I like that it's not too sweet and the white chocolate chips really suited the snowy weather visually. Latte is also pretty nice, but hot chocolate is not as rich as I'd love it to be. And it was not well mixed maybe because the kitchen gets too busy. As for the poached egg panini, it would be perfect if the bread was not so crusty. The filling is an interesting melt of egg-base mixed with a variety of veggies and spices, giving rich taste that varies with every bite. I especially like the creativity in having separated egg white and egg yolk and using them as the bases of the filling, thus creating a changing and complex flavor, maybe that's why it is called ""poached egg over your face,"" saving the trouble of beating the egg with quite good result."

/user_details?userid=GHoG4X4FY8D8L563zzPX5w,Hannah H.,"Alexandria, VA",3 star rating,"Olive & Gourmando, or 'o+g' is a small little breakfast/lunch spot that is known for their paninis.  Besides hot paninis, they also have cold sandwiches, daily plates (such as mac & cheese, salads, etc.), as well as breakfast items (such as granola, homemade ricotta, etc.). Just make sure you request both of the menus, as you can order from either/both of them. This place was bustling when I walked in, but the host is great at remembering the queue and seating parties quickly.  I tried their O+G Grilled Cheese hot panini that was filled with caramelized onions, Raclette, and Gouda Beemster XO, served with a cup of housemade ketchup; the caramelized onions were a bit too overpowering, and the housemade ketchup was a thin consistency of a sweeter sauce (I found this not to complement the panini at all); and, the 'Poached egg on your face' panini (filled with spicy poached eggs with herbs, mayo, Louis d'Or cheese, speck, and slow-roasted tomatoes; this was definitely the better of the two paninis, but it has a spicier kick; the taste kind of reminded of Korean spicy pork sauce (dwegi bokkeum sauce), so it had a familiar taste to it).  I appreciated the crispiness of the bread, but note that they don't brush the bread slices with olive oil or butter.  I'm open to trying out their other kinds of paninis, as I really did like the thing crusty/crispy breads holding the fillings together.  To wash it all down, I tried their raspberry & lime beverage, which seems to be the place's version of a limeade with some raspberry juice - it wasn't as tart as I thought it would be, but more of a smoother finish.  Service was super friendly and efficient, and complimentary water is offered in an olive oil bottle. Once you're done, remember your seat location and pay up at the front!+known for their paninis+raspberry lime beverage+fast and efficient service+crowded during breakfast/lunch rush"

We missed beating the rush Saturday morning and went back Sunday and I'm so glad we went.  Show up about 10 minutes before they open on Saturday or Sunday and you should get seated.  We enjoyed a pastry which was definitely the one of the best almond pastries I've ever tried (check some of my other reviews and you'll see I'm quite the pastry fanatic), The ricotta toast, and the pork breakfast sandwich.  I couldn't pick my favorite because they were all so incredibly amazing. Although this restaurant was full of families with young children, my only negative feedback would be that there were no high chairs which made it difficult to savor our breakfast holding a wiggly toddler. That said the service was quick so we didn't have to hold him for too long. The atmosphere is so quaint and worthy of your social media photos."

Olive & Gourmando will now be open 7 days a week. Yes.. Seven! Now for those that are a fan, you can understand the joy of this. For those that are not(Yet!) a fan.. Well, you will eventually appreciate the opening of 7 days. FIou! I feel better now. I simply needed to share this with all of you. Now the real reason why I'm here. To write a review. I can honestly say that there is nothing negative to write about. No, nothing. The only thing I was planning to mention is the long waiting time for a table and how crowded it gets each time I go. Now with being open 7 days, I think this will relieve the line-ups. Wait! Don't get turned off by the long waiting time.. It's worth it. I promise you!Yes, most restaurants with very few exceptions are pricey and none other than a tourist trap. Olive and Gourmando is not at all one of them.Their main focus is on the locals that come and enjoy an outstanding breakfast, or lunch. Each of their meals, pastries  are simply delicious and well presented. This is not about big or huge portions of pancakes and waffles or massive amounts of sausage and bacon. This is about using local and delicious things to make it all about quality. Their pastries are oh so crumbly and buttery, along touches of Valrhona chocolate in some of their pastries. Nothing is overly sweet or greasy.  Again, just perfect! I ordered the homemade granola with Greek yogurt and fruits. It was a good portion with such generous amounts of fresh berries, apples, grapes and oranges. The fruits were perfectly ripe and juicy. Because I'm not a coffee drinker, I put a lot, yes a lot of focus on hot chocolate. Their hot chocolate was out of this world!! A simple glass of hot steamy milk(Perfect temperature) with a generous amount of Valrhona cocoa. You put as much sugar as you desire. Perfect! At last a hot cocoa that is not packed with 90% sugar and 10% chocolate. We arrived at 11:30am on a Friday. It was packed! Wait.. Give it a try anyways. The service was very professional, efficient and so fast. For all these reasons, I insist you go try it again and again. Either if you live in Montreal or you're a tourist. You will certainly love this place. Like I said.. I promise!"

Although it was pretty chilly outside, we still had to wait in a line that wrapped around the block, and once the restaurant opened, we were the lucky last two to get a table before the place was at capacity. The biggest mistake we made was to order a 'real' breakfast from the menu. Hubby had some amazing french toast with grapefruit and a side of sweet labneh (was better than it sounds) while I made the fatal mistake of getting an middle eastern egg casserole thing which was pretty bad. We picked up a chocolate banana danish for the road which was AH-MAY-ZING so I had to stop by later on in the summer to pick up some yummy pastries for a family breakfast. Everything we picked up was delicious beyond words so my suggestion would be to stick to the pastries when you visit.

The food was really, really good and our waitress was extremely nice. However, their seating system was a bit frustrating.

The waitstaff behind the counters seemed completely uninterested in helping customers and mainly chatted away with each other. Luckily, the ambiance and the food were well worth the wait."

Located in the heart of Montreal, Olive et Gourmando has established themselves as a quintessential cafe of Old Montreal. Delicious breakfast items...piping hot Panini...fresh cold sandwiches...a table stacked with amazing baked goods as far as the eyes can see....what more can Hungarians (not to be confused with the good people of Hungary; but rather, hungry patrons) ask for? The flavor profile of the apple and parsnip soup with julienned pear covered with crispy bacon was truly divine. Needless to say, it was devoured within seconds. The #24 Salad must be sent by the Herbivore God.  The amazingly competent dish is comprised of the following: buckwheat soba noodles tossed with sesame oil, toasted unsweetened coconut, black sesame seeds, pickled daïkon and carrots, fried shallots, roasted marinated tofu, fresh herbs (basil, mint, cilantro), peas, fenugreek sprouts, red cabbage, cucumber, strips of kale, mixed sprouted beans, and mix seeds and nuts (small pieces of roasted unsalted cashew).The equally marvelous dressing consisted of rice wine vinegar, fresh ginger, organic cashew butter, some spicy chili sauce, sautéed onion, garlic, curry powder, cinnamon, cumin, fresh coriander and fresh lime juice.""Am I dead, Angel?

Came on a Monday morning but should have checked that they don't serve brunch type meals during weekdays. A bit of a bummer because I found their regular morning menu a bit on the light side (mostly pastries, only one egg sandwich, and a yogurt bowl). My group was super hungry for more than pastries and was an hour shy of their fuller lunch menu as well but after about a 30 min wait, we still wanted to give this place a fair shot. We tried the spicy egg sandwich (which was good but if you are a punk for spicy stay away), their cheese croissant (amazing), and a hazelnut chocolate banana roll (also amazing). Hoping that I can catch this place at a different time next time I visit Montreal but you can tell their food is quality. I would definitely go again but maybe for brunch and with an understanding that I would probably have to wait a bit."

Great menu selections as well as a mouthwatering array of fresh baked goods behind a case at the front of the restaurant. It's hard not to over order as there are so many unique options to try. I had the Cha-Cha-Chia bowl: chia pudding,fruit purée, muesli, quinoa,banana and coconut-what a delicious blend of flavor and texture! It was served in a swing top mason jar. My daughter had the grilled cheese sandwich and that too was very good. It came with caramelized onions,Raclette and Gouda served with homemade ketchup.The fresh fruit bowls were composed of citrus, berries, grapes,dried fruit and topped off with crispy apple slices. Double chocolate cookie, indulged in by my husband, was a hit too. If you're looking for  creative selections made with good quality,fresh ingredients, this is the place to go.

Don't get me wrong the food is good and the quality of the ingredients is great. But is it worth the price, the wait and sitting shoulder to shoulder cramped with other guests...probably not. I've been here twice. Once for take out and once for a sit down meal. For take out I ordered the banana chocolate brioche and a cappuccino. It was good. The pastry was delicious. However I think the tiny cappuccinos are quite overpriced and nothing special. For the sit down meal I got there at 10:40 am and it wasn't too busy. I tried to order the 'in your face egg panini' which they were sold out of. How do you sell out of eggs and bread at a breakfast place by 10:40? It wasn't a big deal, but it made a difference since their menu is already very small and limited. I also noticed it's a trend in the other reviews. Anyways I ordered the ricotta with honey and bread and an almond croissant. Both were delicious. The ricotta is creamy and refreshing. The almond croissant is good but overpriced in my opinion. I do have to say that the service there was lovely. Everything was delivered quickly and with a smile. However overall I think this place is a bit overrated. Would I go here for lunch once in a while if I worked nearby, sure. Would I go out of my way to come here? Probably not. There are so many other cafes in this area with incredible cappuccinos and pastries at almost half the cost and half the crowds."

I didn't expect it to be so greasy. I couldn't eat it after a couple bites. The majestic was just okay as well.

We also had the Vegan 2.0 panini, it was flavourful but lacked texture. I understand it's a cold panini, but the sandwich could have been so much more awesome had the bread been crunchy and the chickpea patty more consistent.

Olive et Gourmando is good for something fast, but a place that you can really take your time and enjoy your food.

Fine by me because everything was delicious! I ordered the Tartine, emotionally prepared to not finish it because it looked HUGE, but it was surprisingly light! It's a large baguette with ricotta, tomatoes, corn, peaches, nuts, and other great things. SO good. The Cubain was another one that was super bomb! That pickle mayonnaise...like what is that?!! I also had their grapefruit spritz with a touch of aperol and it was the most refreshing drink I've ever had.4 stars because my husband asked for a side of chips and got an entire bag emptied in a bowl!

I always get the vegan sandwich, and it's mind blowing every time. All of the vegetables have a fresh crunch to them, and they make the bread in house. My only complaint is that one time I tried to order a sandwich to go at around 2pm on a Tuesday, and the woman at the front said that they were sold out, which was confusing to me because I assumed that everything was made fresh to order?

It's not about the food, the food is a hit or miss. It's about the customer service.  Best parts at the end when the manager goes crazI ordered a few things on the menu, the Cuban came in and it was overly salty. I couldn't have more than 3 bites and I drank a few cups of water to compensate. The server came back and asked us how everything was. I told her it was too salty. She shrugged and said that's just how it is. Why would you ask me how things are if you don't care for a negative response. She did nothing. At the end of our meal I decided to send the sandwich back and ask for the bill. She didn't take it off the bill. The manager Genevieve with red hair came over aggressively to tell me that there was nothing wrong with their sandwich or their ingredients, that they sell 20k sandwiches a year and it's my taste that has the issue. There was no issue. I have never been treated with such insult over.. a sandwich.... Coming into a customers face- she was real close. And telling me that their establishment can't be wrong because they sell 20k of these sandwiches a year, it must be my taste buds. So cheers to you if you're going in for food, just forget about having decent customer service. Oh ya when the manager finally decided it was appropriate to remove the sandwich from the bill she decided to tell me to have a merry Christmas. For an establishment with a line up our the door they sure are shitty about a $15 sandwich. Our bill came to $50.

I found the layout to be a bit confusing, I guess that adds to the charm here.  Tables by the Pastry display, Tables near the bathroom door, Tables along the line to wait to make your order in the back, waiters squeezing by, patrons hitting the seated diners trying to squeeze by. It was Perfect chaos, it felt hip in some way, the tightness and the amount of Louis Vuitton bags I spotted.Waiters asked while waiting in line if we wanted to be seated, the wait was 20 mins for a table so I passed and ordered in the back.  The chalkboards on the top left display the fresh Sandwiches of the day that are already made. There are signs hanging under the menu items telling you ' Trop Tard ; Too Late!' Yep that good.I ordered the Brie and Caramelized onions, with a homemade ketchup compote $9.50 (I really wanted the chicken..sold out!). My fiancé ordered the Cuban Sandwich ; Cuban - pressed very thin with Pancetta, braised pork & Gruyere cheese $11  After making the order in the back you then go to the front to pay and the girls are making espressos and lattes, and bagging up treats for hungry sweet-toothed customers.  Couldn't resist buying the Huge Triple Chocolate Cookie.Then you wait. There are benches outside and in front of the cash.  People ordering coffees with need of sugar or stir sticks, have to excuse the waiting benched customers to move for their self-custom blended coffee, again chaos. There has to be a better layout or is this charm? We waited some time before our ready made sandwiches were put in a Press,  Cut in half , then Bagged without side of homemade Ketchup, the Huge Cookie, and some napkins for us to go. As we walked to our Hotel the bag started to get translucent from the grease, the deliciousness was screaming to get out, a great sign. The Brie had a generous portion of the cheese and melted on the caramelized onions it was perfection. No need for the ketchup but tried it anyways and it was good, it tasted like a fruit chutney. The Cuban was amazing. There was Pancetta, Braised pork, and Gruyere cheese a beautiful marriage. The Braised pork was unexpectedly the star to me and had soo much flavour it Made this sammie. The crunchy bites were increasingly tasty.I was full and tried the Triple chocolate cookie. Wow, the generous amounts of Real Chocolate chips is soo good, it was an experience, it did not disappoint!  I Love Chocolate.O&G set the bar high. The best sandwich we had and made others eaten from now on difficult to beat!A MUST must try if in the Old Port area"

The environment was cold, but I didn't mind because it was buzzing with energy, and had great staff. If you're interested in just the pastries, you can walk right in and order those separately, no need to wait in line for that.  For the breakfast fair, I had this spicy egg breakfast panini, which was absolutely delicious. The coffee was decent, and so were the pastries. The wait staff were extremely attentive, fast, and did not make us feel rushed. Overall, I would recommend this place!"

It's in a beautiful part of town and serves fresh homemade baked goods and a great lunch menu. It gets busy at lunch times. It's casual, bustling and you have to wait in line for a table at peak times. So not quite the place to go if you're in a rush for lunch.It's a little on the pricier side for an everyday lunch but I guess you're paying for the location and the freshness, so it's justified :)I love to bring out of towners here for an off-peak lunch or a brownie snack."
/user_details?userid=AVAwq_CEuWGyc_ufgMezWg,Marielle M.,"San Francisco, CA",1 star rating,"I've been here several times and the food has always been quite good, especially for an old port spot. The wait is always long but that's expected. Today I went with 3 of my friends (so 4 in total) and after waiting for an hour they said they had a spot ready for us. They wanted to seat us at the bar by the window, which makes it clearly difficult to talk to each other (basically impossible). There were two other tables extremely close together that were available and we asked if we could have those instead - they said they don't normally push tables together so we'd have to wait another 20 minutes if we wanted a 4 seater table. The thing is even if they didn't push the tables together and we sat down as two groups of two, we would have still been able to talk and converse so much better because there was barely an inch between them. They said it wasn't possible so we sat at the bar- there were a lot of people so we didn't want to cause too much commotion then. After we got our food and really struggling to talk or hear each other, we wanted to ask our waitress what the reason was for not being able to sit at those two tables instead- to us it seemed more logical to allow us to sit there and two separate groups of two to sit at the bar that sat 4- since it's a lot easier to talk if you're just two people at a bar. We asked politely and just wanted to know why. The initial interaction was fine, she didn't really give us a reason beyond the fact that the hostess' job is extremely stressful. However when she came back she was EXTREMELY RUDE and basically told us off, we were not being confrontational at all and she was getting mad at us. It was a very unpleasant experience and no way to treat customers - we didn't demand anything and just wanted to ask why we couldn't sit there and express that the 4 seater bar is not conducive at all to a group that big. I don't think anyone should speak to anyone that way regardless of the circumstances. The frustrating part for us was that there was clearly a table we could have sat in. We brought it up because we just wanted an explanation and instead of providing one she started a debate instead and was extremely rude to us. I think she knew it because she didn't come back to give us our cheques. It was an unpleasant experience and we will not be going back."

I had the grilled cheese and the star of the dish was the house made ketchup. We passed it around the table and it just went with everything.

We were unaware that we were not supposed to leave the table to go to the bakery shelf and order some take out. We were scolded a bit - which was fine but rather silly. I mean it's more money in the bank and there was no signage or warning we'd be breaking an unspoken law! Any way - the almond croissant and banana chocolate brioche was little better than average and tasted a day or so old. So, maybe skip that part!"

We got a simple drip coffee and dirty chai latte to start, which ended up being less sweet than we were used to, but still very good. For our mains we got the Oeuf Coquette, a take on a shakshouka with chorizo and avocado and the Pouched-Egg-on-Your-Face Panini sans pork.

They also serve coffee and pastries in the takeout line, so that's nice to have while you wait.The place itself is very cozy and cute. We sat on a communal table and I ordered a Goat Cheese and Onion Panini and a raspberry lemonade. The Panini came with a homemade ketchup which was thinned out ketchup that was sweet but still tangy - it complemented the sandwich perfectly. I couldn't finish the whole Panini by myself. My friends ordered the Cuban sandwich and the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, which they all enjoyed. Great to share the Paninis with friends for some variation in your overall meal.

I felt so bad after. The soup was amazinggggg it did not deserve to be simplified to a mere chicken noodle soup & for that I'm so sorry. It was so good. The sandwich was such a large portion & so great, I had half & saved the other half for later. I ate it cold on the train later, and let me tell you something... when a sandwich that is loaded with cheese still tastes great cold, it really speaks to how yummy it is when it's served hot, straight from the kitchen.

/user_details?userid=CWmOTq0jHesrkEk6r2ym1Q,Jenny C.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"From the ratings to the many reviews on here, it's as good as it gets so I won't repeat the others, but a few of my own tips and observations:Let me preface that I was just visiting Montreal for the weekend, first time in the city.I came here essentially to get that Eggs In Yo Face (I'm sure you know what I mean) breakfast sandwich.  Note: The place currently opens at 9 am (on Saturdays).  From reading blogs, it suggested we get there at 8:30, we arrived at 8:40 to a closed restaurant. We walked around and came back at 9:04 and already there was a line. Luckily we managed to snag some seats at the high table though so definitely come early, this place is as popular as they say! I asked if I could get the sandwich without cheese - DENIED.  Said the cheese was already pre-mixed into the eggs.  I decided to chance it. I've hated cheese my entire life, I've become quite adept at picking out cheese from food.  And glad I did, because all I had to do was open the sandwich and not eat the side on which the cheese was melted. The rest was delicious and cheese free (uhm...but this also means the cheese could have easily been left out but....whatever).  I asked for a knife and fork from a passing waitress (crucial tools in my cheese extraction)...who reluctantly gave them to me with this request: ""please be careful of the plates when  using the knife and fork, the plates scratch easily and can also break if you press too hard"" - uhm. really? I need to be careful of breaking plates.....at a restaurant.....with my utensils?  Sounds like someone bought some useless plates. They were very pretty though.So why 5 stars for a place that refused me to go cheeseless and warns you of heavy utensil use? Cuz the food is delicious! Really, go and get the sandwich. I miss it already. Also the vibe is great. Lovely cozy spot perfect for breakfast to fuel you up for a day of sightseeing. Also, our main server (male) was great, super nice and friendly and overall we had a great meal. Approx $70 Canadian (including tip) for 2 sandwiches, 1 fruit bowl, 1 pastry, 2 coffees and 2 very fresh squeezed orange juice for a party of 3."

/user_details?userid=ZvDi03ESZiIqRKWVujLyUw,Francesca G.,"Paris, France",3 star rating,"I came here with a friend around lunchtime on a Saturday, and it was crazy busy. We put our names on the waiting list and were told the wait was 40 minutes. I asked if it was ok for us to go out, walk around, and come back within 40 minutes and was told it was ok. We came back within exactly 38 minutes, and I went up to the counter to say we were back and ask if the table was ready, and I was told (quite sarcastically) ""well yes, and I called your name 4 times"". This was such a bizarre interaction, and had it not happened I would have definitely given 5 stars based on the food, atmosphere, and our lovely waiter. If you want people to wait there, then we should be told not to leave or our table will be given away, or take a phone number and call me 5 minutes before the table is ready or something. There are ways to get around waiting times and lists without being rude to customers. In Paris all the best brunch/weekend spots have huge waits, which I don't have a problem with and am happy to wait for good food. I'm used to queuing up for ages and have seen many creative ways to get around long waiting lists, all without being treated rudely like this before. Even after starting off the meal with a bad taste in my mouth, overall our meal was really great. I ordered the new addition to the menu, the beetroot salad with flatbread, which had garlic tzatziki. My friend had the ricotta with grilled peppers and pine nuts. I thought it was quite expensive for the amount of food (15-17$ per main course), but the ingredients are obviously high quality, and the presentation was beautiful.I would come back here if I'm in Montreal again based on the food and the number of vegetarian options, however I hope they can sort out their waiting list issues and find a better way of making customers feel welcome."

I feel bad as every time I come to Montreal, I see a long line of people patiently waiting for this restaurant to open. Following all the reviews, we came in here expecting to poop ourselves with the quality of the food. I was expecting food orgasms and nothing short of it. It's loud, obnoxious and very energetic. I guess if you are not a New Yorker who has seen a 100 identical restaurants in Lower East Side, this place must really be something special. You probably think - this is as good as it gets and think yourself a foodie. If you are a New Yorker, this place is a dime a dozen. Eating  a lb of sugar for breakfast, is not my idea for a healthy start to my day - but if you like it that way -you'll fit right in. After studying the menu, I could not find a single ""non-carbohydrate centric"" breakfast entree - nothing like simple eggs or something satiating with protein. My poor athlete husband whose whole diet evolves around protein was on the verge of tears but it was his idea to come here so he put up a tough front. I ordered what I thought was the healthiest option on the menu - a vegetable sandwich with goat cheese. The waiter has assured me in comes on the whole wheat bread. The vegetables turned out to be sliced pear/apple type of slaw and the whole sandwich was drizzled with maple syrup on top!I asked for an extra egg as a side to my sandwich and offered to pay whatever necessary - and they said they couldn't do it. Let me just repeat it to show how ridiculous it sounds: they could not boil an egg. After traveling all over the world and eating anywhere from the tiniest holes in the wall in the poorest of villages to world's best restaurant, this is a first time I come across the restaurant that's incapable of boiling an egg or doing any request off the menu.  It's a complete opposite of any European restaurant that'll cook whatever you want for a paying customer and is a really just a step up from cafeteria if the menu is this prefixed. To finish our meal, since we didn't really eat either one of our breakfast entrees - we ordered a granola to split - it probably came in with what looked like quarter lb of jam underneath it, jam as in like straight up jam. While we were miserable and hungry, next to me, people were happily devouring what looked like 3000 worth of calories in waffles and a panini that was made with a giant loaf of bread. All in all, I'm sure this is a great place for some but certainly overhyped and not for those who like to have healthy nutritious low-carbohydrate breakfast."

We got there quite late, circa 245 pm, and found that there was still a 45 minute wait. This cozy little spot is notorious for a wait, but it was well worth it. FOOD The only disappointing thing was how much had sold out by then! All the cold sandwiches I wanted to try were out. Alas, I took a deep breath and decided upon having a chicken kale caesar salad. Boy was it tasty! And THAT BREAD. So delish. Next time I'm in, I'd like to make it earlier to try one of the sandwiches. And if you don't have the luxury of time, do yourself a solid and get a croissant and/or a few pastries for the road.OVERALLComing back the next time I'm in town.

I only have negatives for this place . . .let me count them out, from minor to major:1.  Long wait for this place even early in the morning, probably because early in the morning it's one of the few places that actually serves breakfast/brunch before 11.  This is actually a smart move by the owners and other places may want to consider following suite.2.  It's crowded and loud.  I realize this is a personal preference, but if I want a loud, crowded restaurant I'll just stay in New York.3.  Extremely limited brunch menu.  Besides pastries, there are only 5 things you can order. 5. That's it.  No extras or sides either.4.  Now you might think that one of those options would contain a smidge of protein, you know, like eggs or something.  Oh how wrong you are.  They should rename this place carb city. There are small traces of protein, but it's far outweighed by sugar or fat.  Some examples:a. Chia seed pudding. This sounds healthy right?  Too bad they smother the chia seed pudding in jam then make it even more calorically dense and unhealthy by adding Muesli.b. Cuban sandwich.  Or their version of it.  Which is basically just cheese and a smidge of egg in between two thick pieces of bread.5. Now none of this would have mattered if not for this.  When I saw the options available to me I asked if they could add an extra egg to the Cuban sandwich.  To my surprise, they couldn't.  Seriously guys you can't add one damn egg to my order? Hell you could have cracked the egg open in a cup and given it to me uncooked.  That would have netted you an extra star for the effort.TLDR; totally overrrated place with limited options, no protein options, and no ability to make substitutions."

I went on a food tour the day prior and it was better than anything I sampled on those 7 stops. The only thing that stopped me from giving it a 5/5 was that the latte I ordered was just okay.

We came prepared for such an event, and showed up around 8:45am accordingly.This place gets absolutely mobbed, so I wouldn't recommend coming here unless you have some patience. For the most part, the café delivered but was maybe a bit overrated. I found the pastries absolutely delicious, especially the cheese croissant. I was surprised though, how few options there were for actual breakfast dishes. There was a chia seed pudding of sorts, cheddar toast, and a few yogurt items, but I was expecting at least more than two sandwich options. I guess those items are only available for lunch.The coffee was good, but I didn't understand why they were serving hot coffee drinks in glasses instead of porcelain mugs.... And by good I mean, about on par with any other good coffee shop in any major city - neither better nor worse. Lastly, service was good despite the restaurant being slammed. We requested the coffee be brought out at the same time as the pastries, but at two different times of us ordering each, their timing was off - it wasn't our waitresses fault though to be honest."

While I am giving this place a 5 because of the food, I'd give the service a 4.1 because our waiter had a senior moment and forgot to put our order into the system so we waited longer for our food as a result.

After two weeks, many meals, and some home cooked, Olive and Gourmando was my FAVORITE meal and bistro!Let me start off by saying the night we ventured in, a sewer main broke a block away thus shutting off the bistros water supply. In mid chaos, any reasonable human would understand to be greeted by a frazzled and short host. Contrary to that, the manager calmly explained the situation and offered to let us stay for a Sandwich. We had been walking all day and needed to use the toilet (which of course was out of order due to the water shut off.) We decided to come back for lunch two days later.And that may have been our best decision the whole trip! I ordered a cappuccino and a simple bowl of tomato soup. Let me start with the cappuccino. If you've read my other reviews, I'm a coffee snob. I am appreciative and polite but, I will not drink a bad coffee. This espresso was dark and smooth! To add some twinkle to my good impression I saw the barista ""testing"" the machine making sure the espresso tasted exactly how it should.The tomato soup was both rich in texture and flavor, creamy and fresh! It was topped with a feta, parsley pesto.  SO GOOD! Just the bowl of soup was filling enough and packed with warm cozy flavor.  My husband got a Rueben panini. Again, the best Reuben I have every tasted-and I happen to not be big on meat! It was perfectly balanced between salty and savory, piping hot filled with gooey cheese and fresh crisp home made bread. Yum! Of course, it doesn't help that these are all fresh ingredients as its Montreal, practically France!We took dessert to go to enjoy later on our travels. As someone who lived in Italy, I fond memories of chocolate filled brioche. :) Either I was brought back to a state of ecstasy, or it really was the best Chocolatey Parisian pastry I've eaten. The only con I have was I shared it with my husband. I really do enjoy this bistro and will say one last thing- they are very welcoming to tourists. So put on your best French, our at least a big smile with your English and go eat some amazing food."

I tried the almond croissant $3.75 which was highly recommended but it was just ok in terms of a croissant. I loved the elixir ice tea, it's a green tea with ginger, lemon and pomegranate. It was the most delicious ice tea I've ever had  - complex yet balanced flavours and just a touch of sweetness. Only sad part is that the very small glass is $4.  I didn't love the egg on your face $11.95 - Spicy poached eggs with herbs and mayonnaise, Comté cheese, speck, and slow roasted tomatoes. The panini was just too heavy with the mayo and cheese for a breakfast item (for me at least) and the sriachha just over powered the eggs. I really wanted to like this place as it was so highly recommended but it didn't do it for me. Loved the ice tea and would return for that."

They're just unbelievably good. The salads are wonderful, as well. But let me extol the virtues of a couple of the sandwiches we had.  The Cubain is a hugely memorable roasted port panini with gruyere, lime, chipotle, cilantro and mayo. This sandwhich just launched me into heaven. The chipotle especially gave this panini such a wondrous flavor. The Cajun Chicken sandwich was just an unexpected delight. I didn't come to Montreal to try ""Cajun"" anything, but the spices worked so well with the fresh ingredients on this sandwich that it was a toss-up which of the two sandwiches I planned to order again on my next visit. We'll definitely return when we come back to Montreal.Be prepared for long lines at lunch time unless you come early. This eatery's reputation is well earned.

The croissants and brioche items are awesome, but I was very disappointed that they were unwilling to accommodate my dietary restrictions. Thus, the low rating. I am lactose intolerant and ordered their breakfast panini which comes with melted cheese. When I asked if that ingredient could be omitted, the server said the sandwiches were pre-made and they could not remove it. This really didn't make sense to me since they were pressed to order. Additionally, their menus say at the bottom ""tell us if they need to be aware of any dietary restrictions"", leading us to believe they were willing to accommodate. Weird, right?  Oh well, the coffee was very good, but we won't be back. I'm sure there are other spots that can take cheese off a sandwich and put their guests first."

Its all made from scratchThe salad was interesting because there was parsely in it that gave it a unique tasteThe interior is done very farmhouse rustic which matches the food offering and is actually what i would expect from a resto on a cobblebrick lanewayCoffee is well done as well and I cant recall ever getting a double espresso the equivalent of a tablespoon.

So we pregamed with an almond croissant. Didn't regret that move as soon as we took a bite into it. Unlike most almond croissants, this one was in long form. Rolled up pastry dough along with almond meal. Wasn't too sweet but just the right amount of sweetness and topped with sliced roasted almonds. Ooh la la...I had to keep myself from ordering another one! Into our salad and panini. The Healthy Salad was a big bowl of micro greens and local greens with quinoa with chicken. The taste and texture crunchy and chewy was awesome! Chicken was grilled perfectly and the quinoa that was stuck into the chicken along with the tahini pomegranate dressing was just paired so well! My panini was super tasty with a well balanced cilantro pesto and pineapples. Um hello! The pineapple and cilantro pesto cut through the heaviness of the brisket. Will def be back!!!"

Its a great people watching space if you are waiting. Lots of eye candy. Yummers!So here is why you should go: they serve your coffee with warm, frothy milk. Who does this? Is this a french thing? I love it if it is. The coffee was strong but without any bitterness.  Presentation, atmosphere and speed - this place scores high.

We added our name to the list and after  sizable wait saw a couple of two who had come in well after us be seated before us.  I questioned the hostess and she said she had looked for us but couldn't find us. We were standing in the restaurant the entire time and it is a very small place so I found that very hard to believe. She half apologized and said a table should be ready shortly. Upon getting to our table we were told that the only hot breakfast item they had on the menu (an egg dish) was sold out. How do you have only a few staple entree items on the menu and sell out of one of them?  I had the ricotta with honey which was served with toast. It was tasty but more of a side than a main and seemed like a lot of money for something comprised of a handful of ingredients and not even cooked. Our coffee was served without milk and our food was served without utensils.  With that said, the apple turnover was one of the best I have ever had.  Maybe I hit this on an off day, but boy was it off."

Upon attempting to order, we discovered they were out of nearly everything we wanted. It was around 11am, and they told us they were out of coffee and the first two sandwiches I tried to order. I work as a waitress in a restaurant. I understand that it is not the fault of the waiters that items run out. However, the rude, irritated attitude of the waiter was uncalled for. If your menu is only 10-12 items long and 2 of them are sold out, you should tell people before they survey the menu. Or apologize for the inconvenience. I tried to order a third sandwich modified without mushroom, which I was told was not possible.

On-trend, inviting, youthful but also really classic. My dad introduced me to this place (embarrassingly enough) - it's populated by both in-the-know older folks and cool looking younger people. I guess that doesn't really matter in terms of reviewing the food, but just to give an idea of what the place is like! I really enjoyed the hand-drawn chalk board menu. Service is prompt and on occasion sassy, but in an enjoyable way. The food I've had here has always been excellent - I've had both soups and salads. Very thoughtfully constructed food with a very pleasing balance of flavour and texture. I haven't tried the pastries, since I don't believe any of them are vegan friendly, which is such a shame because they look delicious. Regardless I'm just ecstatic I can eat vegan stuff here but also bring friends here who are meat-eaters in the mood for some meat. Good lattes also! They have soy milk as an option.Only one bathroom, which is a little awkward, so there's usually a lineup. Speaking of line-ups - I've never had to wait less than 45 minutes to be seated here, so keep that in mind if you're looking for a quick bite."

These people apparently know me well. The decor is right up my alley, a little Anthropologie store, a little cheeky, rustic, and with a hint of luxe. I read the Yelp reviews, so I knew the about the line system and that this place would crazy busy on weekends. We decided to come on a Tuesday to avoid the insanity and we devised a strategy to have breakfast and lunch, with only one trip. It worked perfectly. We were seated within about two minutes of arriving, we did not wait in the check out line to be seated. We each got a latte and a pastry. I had the chocolate brioche and the boyfriend had the banana nut ""muffin."" It was more like a loaf. The lattes were lovely, great flavor, the right amount of creaminess, but if I could do it again I would get a large, the small was smaller than I expected. The chocolate brioche was divine, though it was a lot of sugar for breakfast. I couldn't stop eating it though. I tried the boyfriend's muffin and it was also great, huge whole walnuts on top to add a nice crunch and nuttiness and the banana flavor was wonderful and it was quite moist. We decided to take sandwiches to go since we were bike sharing to Parc Jean-Drapeau afterwords and had heard such wonderful things about the sandwiches. We asked our server how best to order, since we no longer had a paper with our table number on it. He asked us which ones we wanted and took care of it for us. I got the eggplant and mozzarella one and the boyfriend got the Cuban. They were both delicious, even over an hour later and having been strapped into the front of a Bixi. I will say that mine was great, but his was better. I'm delighted we got to do both the pastries and sandwiches, it was well worth it!"

The ""24"" salad with asian flavors is a good choice too.And how to resist their beautiful selection of baked desserts?Did I say how I love O+G ? Try it, you won't be disappointed."

The Tall Man got the housemade ricotta, which he still dreams about and was one of the best things he's eaten.While I didn't try the pastries, my friends who did were very very happy."

We got lucky and had a table right away. I had the only beer they had. It was a Canadian brew (blonde) it was very good. Simple sandwiches make for delicious sandwiches. Nothing is overstated about this place which is probably why it's so good. Just one of those places that live up to the hype.

Thankfully there are plenty of shops open nearby and a couple of galleries :) We got the almond croissant and apple turnover from their pastries rack. They were both good but not too impressive. The almond croissant could have been more crusty. I preferred the apple over the croissant. There weren't many other options for pastries as they have already sold out of many options. We also ordered the Cuban sandwich. Again, some of the other sandwich options have already sold out so I would come early if you want full options. The sandwich was the standout for me. The pork was so juicy and succulent and the sauce was spot on. The bread was also the perfect thickness. We split one sandwich between the two of us and it was enough to fill us up along with the pastries."

I am not the type to throw things out there like this but I was wearing very expensive shoes and pants. I don't own a restaurant but if I did and something of this nature would happen I would use my common sense and offer the clients to take care of their dry cleaning bill or offer them the meal on the house. Instead of asking if there is anything that she can do, the manager told us the new coffees were on the house :|  and asked us if it was going to be one cheque or seperate.  After paying the bill we walked out and she reminded us not to forget our coffees... I told her she could keep them.     In all my years of eating out in restaurants, I have not seen such unprofessionalism from a manager and in no way were we mad at the waiter nor did we make the slightest bit of a stink.... The manager should be a dishwasher at best,  but on a different note, the salad with Tempeh was excellent :)"

/user_details?userid=7kfJk_NtOslC9jPk2Koz3g,Yvonne C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Turns out my internal vacation clock is perfect for avoiding crowds. No line ups at 4PM on a Saturday, though a few items were unfortunately sold out (the regular croissants, all three hot dishes, and a seafood dish). We were here for the ricotta (sweet) that my companion had hailed as the best thing ever and were sad to have missed breakfast hours. Except! Breakfast menu turns out to be available all day. Now the difficulty of choosing between the sweet (which we were here for) and the salty (which also seemed well reviewed). Alas, we got both - and thankfully we did! Both very well balanced and refreshing. The RICOTTA (SALTY) - with sauteed broccolini, pine nuts, parmesan, and dried currents, served alongside ricotta drizzled in olive oil and a healthy sprinkling of black pepper. beautiful combination of creamy, crunchu, chewy, salty, sweet, bitter, hot, cold. Everything. The RICOTTA (SWEET) was far less complex in ingredients but just as flavourful. Orange zest, (possibly orange-infused) honey, and salt flakes garnishing ricotta. Both are incredibly refreshing and different enough that it didn't seem like we were overloading on the ricotta. Both also came with enough slices of crusty bread to scoop it all up, except we got an extra CHEESE CROISSANT for good measure. More of the chewy than flaky-and-crumble-all-over-your-face type. not bad at all but the cheese was unnecessary in this pairing.Decor is so homey (with the cutest menu illustrations on the wall), and there's a comfortable amount of natural light. Plus, the windows open, which, on that beautiful sunny day, made the afternoon perfecto. Seating is very intimate but doesn't get overly loud. Totally would love to have this as my corner coffee shop."

/user_details?userid=i_4JP5Co6WZqgoPHnIPh4g,Bertha F.,"Portland, ME",3 star rating,"Great food offered in a cozy setting. Getting that food, finding a table and then paying for that food is another matter. First you get in line and walk by trays and amazing brioche (more like what I'd call a cinnamon roll, not like brioche that you'd find in France), presented in a self-serve manner. Or is it not self-serve? I observed four patrons taking apple walnut cinnamon brioches and two patrons taking chocolate banana brioches. Then when I grabbed one, using the provided tongs, a stern lady scolded me in French! If you want soup or sandwiches, you get in a different line. If you want a table, you have to stand and be alert, ready to pounce on a table where the patrons finally have grown weary on sneaking peeks at their mobile phones, and activity that is explicitly forbidden but poorly enforced. Paying is the final chore. Cannot pay when you get you food. You cannot pay at your table. Instead, you top off your experience by getting in yet another line. Perhaps this gauntlet-walk experience is intentional so as to keep the numbers down. The establishment is always packed to the gills due to the overall deliciousness of the food; however, it would be so much more crowded if it were user-friendly"

We ordered a grilled cheese and the reuben which is a smoked meat panini but it took a bit long for our meal to arrive. Once I took the first bite though i noticed that their panini bread was extremely crispy which made it taste so good! Everything tasted very fresh, so I do believe you're getting your moneys worth even though it might seem a bit pricey for a sandwich. I don't really recommend getting the salads though because they are quiet pricey for what they are. They also offer some baked goods so I took the double chocolate cookie to go and it was delicius!

Also, my foodie relatives love this place, so I knew it was going to be good. And it was.We were there for breakfast, so we didn't have their famous sandwiches, but their bakery items were fabulous. Perfect croissants (regular and almond), wonderful (and big!) muffins, fresh scones. The coffees were also excellent. As we left, they were putting out their lunch pastries: unbelievably gorgeous cupcakes and cookies and brownies. All looked amazing. The restaurant interior is really welcoming, with long, warm wooden tables, comfy wooden chairs, wide open big windows (in the summer), chalkboard-covered columns by the entryway with menus and cartoons drawn on it, funky twig decorations hanging over the tables..... The whole place reminded me of some funky, hip hang-outs I used to frequent in my McGill days (in the early '80s). I guess you'd call it a post-hippie kind of vibe. I liked it.What I wasn't so keen on was the whole system of ordering and paying. When the place is crowded (which, I gather, it often is - especially on weekends), it just doesn't make sense to have such a chaotic, inefficient system for diners to order and pay. So many queues, so much waiting, so little room in which to wait. Some older relatives asked me afterwards if they'd like this restaurant and if they should go here, and I had to say no: they'd love the food, but they couldn't handle the process to get their table and order their food and pay. For this reason alone, I think this restaurant is geared more for a younger crowd who can tolerate the wait and chaos."

We dined here on our first day in Montreal and we ordered take-out on the last day of our trip. ;)As we were one block away from Olive & Gourmando on Thursday morning, we could smell something delicious. By the time we reached the corner of Saint Pierre and Saint Paul, there were already a few people patiently waiting for the restaurant to open. The moment the clock struck 8, we were welcomed with smiling faces as the door swung open. With a comfy, rustic vibe and a counter filled with freshly baked goods, stepping into Olive and Gourmando first thing in the morning was delightful.My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed the ""Poached Egg On Your Face"" Panini. Sriracha in a breakfast sandwich? Yes, please! It was a bit greasy, but delicious -- deliciously crunchy and cheesy with a bit of a kick.I am a chocoholic, and I couldn't leave Olive & Gourmando without trying a brioche, the Brioche au Chocolat Valrhona in particular. The moment I took my first bite, I died and went to chocolate heaven... The brioche was nice and warm, soft, and VERY chocolatey! I LOVE chocolate but even I think it may be a bit too chocolatey sweet for breakfast. It worked out nicely that my boyfriend and I shared something savoury and something sweet.Before heading back home, we stopped by Olive & Gourmando again. This time, it was right around noon and there was a bit of a line, filled with both tourists and locals, waiting to be seated. We decided to just order take-out and ended up getting five Chocolate and Banana & Chocolate brioches to bring back home. I'm not a fan of bananas, but I was told the Banana Chocolate Brioche was amazing as well.If you are in the area, and/or you are looking for a place that offers good sandwiches and pastries, why not? It may be a little pricey, but I'm pretty certain I'll return anyway, to try their lunch menu and other pastries next time I'm in Montreal again."

When you visit Montreal (assuming you're not a resident), you have GOT to beeline for this place for your next breakfast. This place has the most amazing brioche I've ever tried. If you're not able to secure a table, be sure to grab a few of these to go. In terms of actual brunch items, we shared the chia bowl (amazing..just...wow) and the oeuf coquette. Both outstanding and certainly worth having again. Service is very friendly and this place gets packed...so be sure to show up at least 15-20 min before it opens to make the first round of seating."

/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I LOVE O & G. So much in fact, that I wouldn't mind moving in. Yes, it's THAT good. So first thing's first; do not expect to arrive and saunter in to the table of your choice because that's not going to happen. O & G is packed all the time, and there is almost always a line-up to get in. That said, I usually go for breaky or lunch, so it's possible that late afternoons is quieter but don't count on it. Everything is made fresh, daily, from the salads to the baked goods, to the amazing ginger-lemon iced tea (they really need to offer this in a larger size!). They make a mean latte, and also offer wine (I think it's organic, but I'm not sure). As well, you can buy some of their spicy nuts and jams. The service is OK but not great. It can be very slow and the wait staff don't always think to come and check in once you've been seated so if you're in dire need of coffee, order while you're in line and you can get your fix while waiting for a table. My favorites include:#24 salad - made with raw veggies, roasted peanuts, shallots, tofu, basil, cilantro and mint, served on rice noodles and accompanied by a lovely sweet and sour dressing. Now, the last time I was there I could swear the noodles were buckwheat but I could be making that up in my head.  Anyway, this salad is fresh and incredibly flavourful and leaves your belly feeling just right (read: room for dessert). The Gustavo - holy mother of God, this is good. Garlic grain-fed chicken, grilled onions, balsamic marinated portobello mushrooms, Havarti cheese and maple dijonnaise sauce. Wow. This sandwich can be pretty filling so you may have to take that dessert to go.  Cajun Chicken sandwich - this one is also made with grain-fed chicken and includes guacamole, cajun spices, tomatoes and mango. Equally as delicious as The Gustavo, but packs less of a punch (which is not a bad thing!). I'll eat anything with avocado so this sandwich makes me feel all happy on the inside. Sadly, since i have been tasked with avoiding wheat recently, I opted for the Viva Las Vegan sandwich on my last visit (a great option for all you vegetarians and vegans out there). I loved this one and felt pretty stuffed by the time I was finished. It's got marinated tofu, dill pickles, hummus, caramelized onions, crushed olives, arugula and is served on organic bread. By the way - their breads are like a taste of Heaven, so fluffy and thick. Of course, I ate everything BUT the bread but we don't need to talk about that.If you're a fan of chocolate like me, try their 'Extraordinary Brownie'  or 'The Attack of the Killer Chocolate' cookie (triple chocolate, people!). Both are incredible and will satisfy any chocoholic. Now, GO!"

I'm sure this place is more than a bit hyped up by its Yelp reviews. It's filled with tourists who have no doubt flocked here via Yelp, but the food is delicious. Strong coffee, excellent granola and very fresh fruit, and the egg on your face panini is wonderfully spicy and cheesy. The only downside is that the small parties often have to share tables. Normally my boyfriend and I are happy to do so but we we're seated with some folks whose conversation really annoyed us. Of course that's not the cafe's fault, but if you want a more private breakfast you might be put off."

But above all, if you love good food, are looking for somewhere that is a sure thing visiting Montreal, or need an amazing date spot or just want to put something super rich and tasty in your face, go here. There's not a lot of waiting area and waiting in the freezing cold kinda sucks. Also, earlier is better than later as they ran out of their hot sandwiches the day we stopped by.All that said, this place is a gem among gems. The desserts and hot chocolates are made with Valrhona chocolates. The truffle mac and cheese had mushrooms and was the best I'd ever had, and I've had a lot of these! Oddly enough, the addition of actual mushrooms seems to really bridge the rational of putting the truffle flavor in the mac and cheese and isn't so overwhelming. Also, they serve it in an iron skillet, so there's crunchy cheese!The cafe is the perfect level of busy. The tables are really small so sharing is a really good idea. The espressos are perfectly poured. The few pastries they have (okay there's like 20) are phenomenally perfect in their simpleness, like they picked the best things they could make and that's what you get, no complaints there! Get the chocolate brioche if you like dark chocolate.I can't wait to return to Montreal and Olive et Gourmando!"

There was about a 45 minute wait for two. Lots of people were waiting on the sidewalks corners surrounding the place. Wandered next door to an adorable lunch box store and then came back. My grumbly stomach couldn't wait for lunch so I had a chocolate chip cookie from the bakery. It was warm and very chocolatey (always a good thing!) so I found it to be a solid choice. We were seated a few minutes earlier than expected. I had the salty ricotta plate which came with delicious warm bread and an heirloom tomato and pine nut salad. It was a nice size portion and the perfect summer lunch. My fiancé got the ""poached egg on your face"" panini and found his to be somewhat overrated due to how heavy the sandwich was. He felt like the sandwich lacked a brightness/acidity to cut through the heaviness. Overall, was a good experience and the service was very pleasant, friendly, and patient despite the obvious busy time. Would highly recommend for brunch or lunch!"

However, I mention late because this place is very busy and the wait list is long! No reservations. The interior is welcoming and cozy.For beverages, you must try their home made lemonade, it is simply delicious and refreshing.  Their mocha coffee is very good too. For meals, my favorite is The Cubain, it's porc and pancetta with a Gruyere cheese. In the fall, their Mac N Cheese is very good too. I personally also love a side of their green salad - it has a distinct taste that at first I was not so crazy about but it has grown on me since then and I love it! And, a must try at the end of your meal to complete everything is their brownie - so moist and simply to die for! Prices are pricey but well worth it on a gorgeous day!

I think that if I ever came back here, I would want to try something a little more interesting, but that's not because the paninis were bad - there were just so many great things on the menu.

/user_details?userid=c2BbxDdn6QTy33682gQDvQ,Ju L.,"Osaka, Japan",5 star rating,"Such a lovely place! It felt quite SoHo - and in another context I might say that sneeringly. Here, it means the cafe is on a corner in clean, pristine Old Montreal, surrounded by cast-iron-style architecture, open cobblestone alleyways, and horse-drawn carriages passing by the window every minute. (Horses in Manhattan's SoHo would go on a mad killing spree after 5 minutes, but you get the idea)Olive + Gourmando was PACKED for lunch on an early weekday afternoon. It felt a bit touristy but also had its share of locals (e.g. people on laptops).  The location is walking distance from the touristiest (!) part of town, by the Notre Dame Basilica.The ordering process is a little funny. The hostess gives you a blank memo paper with your table #. Go up to the cafe counter or sandwich counter, give them your slip, and place your order. They keep the slip, food is brought to your table, and you can order more at any time by telling them your table #. When you go up to pay, they will already have your complete bill.  The lunch menu is small, with 4 cold/4 hot sandwiches plus soup/salad. There are pegs on the chalkboard to hang signs indicating which are sold out - but they replenish frequently. Our hostess spoke English natively, but the menu is in French. But if you can read English you can easily figure it out (thanks for being 30% French-origin, English Language!)I was so happy to find that not only is this place adorable, the food is da bomb (technical term).  My smoked fish sandwich (a cold option, $10) was packed with shredded smoked trout and slightly sinful with a slab of herbed cream cheese. The centimeter-thick layer of spinach was not overwhelming in the least. The salty trout was balanced out by capers, which I normally dislike but were fabulous here mixed in with sun-dried tomatoes.The Cuban (hot option, $11) was nothing short of amazing - pressed very thin with pancetta instead of ham, and served very hot, with plenty of pickle that imbued just the right tartness to combat all that cheese. Ever had a great Cuban? You won't even know that you WANT MORE delicate pickly tartness til you've had O+G's version.  Mmmmm. Both sandwiches came promptly, which surprised me because the restaurant was so busy. The espresso ($3.25) was fine, nothing spectacular. We also had an apple turnover ($3.75) that was fresh but really not on the adventurous side on either our part or O+G's.  It seems their regular drip coffee is good, since many, many, people came in to order coffee to go.If you're looking for a hectic but lovely luncheon or cafe visit with plenty of Montrealaise flair, try Olive et Gourmando! If you don't care for the hectic part, come well after the lunchtime rush. The food will still be fabulous."

We started off with the almond croissants that my friend adamantly insisted that we order. I told him that I wasn't a fan of almond croissants and he said to me ""it's because you haven't tried the ones from here."" And he was right. I have to admit that the almond croissants were the best that I've had so far.We both ordered the Cubain hot panini because who doesn't love paninis? I ordered mine with the southwest tomato soup.

Everyone has faults.Espresso is lovely. Lunchtime line is hell. Going during off times is cool and it is worth the wait. I hate lines so I mean it when I say it is worth the time.Always bustling."

It was a great dining experience since we had an awesome view eating from the window bar-top. Those seats are perfect for people watching and passing time. The narrow alley ways of Old Port are interesting to be inside and to observe. Olive & Gourmando is a place to enjoy and savor. I easily had spent 2-hours there. I had a simple lunch: Latte, Cuban sandwich and then took some pastries to-go. They have a wide variety of baked goods on display that is hard to miss. So, don't skip!"

/user_details?userid=U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,Michael U.,"Las Vegas, NV",4 star rating,"With so much pastry, fine dining, and Canadian comfort food to be sampled on our brief visit to Montreal 'breakfasts' as a proper sit-down entity were still not to be overlooked (much to my family's dismay and with a schedule heavy on museums, churches, and hockey along with the food mornings would be early - and thankfully so would be the opening times of each of the three breakfast spots we decided to try.Beginning first with perhaps the most oft raved breakfast in the city we almost ended up taking a pass on Olive + Gourmando because the traffic and parking on the tight streets of the busy business district is nothing short of a nightmare during the morning rush - but thankfully, as fate would have it a spot opened up on our third trip around the block and with streets uneven and crowd bustling we made our way into the small store and restaurant only a few minutes later than anticipated.Owned and operated by Dyan Solomon and Eric Girard Olive + Gourmando reminds one much of Panera as you walk in - a few dry goods and baked items up front along with the local paper plus a busy kitchen in back, but with communal tables consistently packed as people vie for space and the air rife with notes of coffee, butter, and vanilla there is clearly more than ""quick casual"" at play - specifically the use of all natural, organic, and high quality local ingredients in each of the restaurant's creations; items I was left to select for the group as my mother and aunt attempted (successfully) to procure seating.Utilizing both the pastry counter, kitchen, and servers to facilitate service the modus operandi at O+G is to order at the pastry counter, find a seat, and wait for the items to arrive - a successful approach even despite my over-ordering that led to an impressive pile of food arriving perhaps 10 minutes later - each item warmed or hot and from the coffee to the sandwich to each of our four baked goods everything looked fantastic despite the simple style of preparation on brown paper in wooden baskets.Beginning first with the coffee - mostly espresso but also offering an Americano I eschewed my traditional ordering and went with a double based on the recommendation of the barista that the beans taste best without the added water and with the roast very low in acidity I had to agree, particularly given the smoky top notes and mellow caramel tones underneath - no sugar was added and none was needed.Moving next to the pastries, a quartet was selected and attempting to make selections that would appease all I ran the gamut of flavors from fruit to chocolate and light to heavy beginning first with two spirals of brioche; one Raspberry Cheesecake, the other Valrhona Chocolate, and both exemplary.  Beginning first with the eggy bread - crisp on the shell with a wispy and rich pull-apart within and lightly kissed with an egg wash before its trip to the oven both curls were rife with their respective ingredients and as much as I love Valrhona dark it was the cheesecake that impressed most - a rich balance of the cream cheese's smoothness with sweet pureed raspberries complete with seeds.Moving on to the measuring stick, an oblong almond croissant, I found myself somewhat less impressed than I had expected largely due to the texture produced by such a tightly wound crumb.  Certainly tinged with almond and packed with butter this simply was not the texture I would expect for a croissant - more like a breadstick in its lack of an air-pocketed leavened crumb.  Good, but not on par with the rest of the choices, including the Chausson Aux Pommes sharing its basket.  Translated literally as 'slipper of apples' it would be hard for me to find something more comforting than this hand-pie and no matter what language the crispy golden shell and dense core of pan cooked cinnamon apples was lovely - the only thing that would have made it better was ice, or perhaps whipped, cream.For our final choice, the only kitchen item that screamed 'must order' we received the ""Poached Egg on Your Face Sandwich"" - a pressed panini made with house ciabatta filled with sauteed onions, a thick curl of aged Comte, confit tomatoes, griddled speck, and 'cooked egg salad.'  Hitting on pretty much all of the savory notes with the caramelized onions and bright tomatoes acting to cut the fat just a bit the most intriguing aspect of this dish to me was the 'salad' - a texture somewhere between rough chopped hardboiled eggs and a lightly poached egg but very interesting on the tongue.  A great meal from first sip to last bite with only a slightly disappointing almond croissant to mar the experience I definitely understand the hype around Olive + Gourmando and compared to our other Montreal Breakfasts it is the only one to which I'd return."

I got the Cha-Cha Chia Bowl - chia pudding with nut butter muesli, mango pure and fresh mango, bananas and coconut chips. It was freakin' delicious. My mum got the Poached egg on your face panini without meat and also very much enjoyed it.The server was very friendly, the interior was charming and rustic, the coffee was great, and the food was delicious.

For a grilled cheese, salad, and cappuccino, my bill totaled $37. I did the math in my head, and my order should have been $25 tops. So either they overcharged me (hence the lower rating) or I read the prices wrong on the menu (lower rating still... Way overpriced).

The sandwich temperature was probably close to burning, but it makes all the difference when it's freshly made. My friend told me this was the best sandwich place in Montreal - and I don't doubt her words. There is a large variety of other sandwiches, so I would definitely return to try new items. I also saw many baked goodies (pastries!).Service was alright - A little slow, maybe sitting in a corner was a bad idea. I don't really remember interacting with the waitress much, since she appeared to have many other tables she was managing. The one thing that probably carved an impression on me was the table spacing. I remember seeing other customers trying to find ways to leave their seats without having to step on anyones toes....Other than that, the place is definitely worth a visit!"

We came for a late lunch around 2pm on a Wednesday, so we were luckily seated right away. The place has a very trendy, eccentric vibe and a unique menu. At first we were hesitant about some of the menu items (a panini with pickle mayo?), but decided to order the Cubain and Pomodoro paninis to split since they were most appealing to us.I am not exaggerating when I say there are the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. The Pomodoro got better with every bite, the perfect mix of salty and savory. As the for the Cubain, I would choose this as my last meal. The variety of flavors fused together into one and somehow really worked together. We also ordered two cappuccinos which were also very good. The server was very friendly and accommodating.We enjoyed our food so much that we even came back and ordered two more paninis to go for our long road trip back to the US. It was a Friday afternoon around 12:30pm, and although it was raining, the line was out the door. I'd recommend coming late afternoon to avoid the rush and really enjoy the meal!

By the time we paid and left though it had calmed down considerably.I really like how they separate the ordering process. You first go to the back to check the menu, see the salads and ask about the day's specials. After you've ordered, you take your seat and servers will bring out your food. Once you're done, they'll ask about coffee and desserts. All in all it's fast, efficient and doesn't force you to decide everything at once.All of the servers are friendly and nice, the hostess especially. It's moderately priced for lunch, around $11 for sandwiches and $3-4 for desserts, but the portions are huge and everything is fresh and delicious."

I don't usually like counter seating but this let us be in a less busy corner of the restaurant and in a prime spot for people watching. The chocolate brioche was delicious and nicely sized. It was the cold smoked trout panini, though, that was the standout. A white flour grilled bread shaped like a pita but with a moister and more pleasantly rubbery texture was split and stuffed with the trout spread, herbed cream cheese, and a mound of fresh crisp spinach.

While the French breads make them all pretty enjoyable, when the flashiest topping is ham and cheese you eventually long for a little more excitement. This explains the popularity of Olive Et Gourmando, a small sit-down sandwich shop in Old Montreal which offers interesting sandwich combinations like garlic and yogurt chicken, smoked trout and pancetta, pork and gruyere. The seating is tight and waits can be long but the hipster French cafe vibe, creative sandwiches and local beer and wine selection make them worth putting up with.Recommended: The Gustavo, The Smoked Trout"

Five stars for the food. Service was fast & friendly too (they now have table service).At 4 p.m. on a Saturday, we had a 20-minute wait so went around the corner to the Phi Centre to check out the art installations.

/user_details?userid=q-MXzeXifjm0UWOD1px5CA,G B.,"Brooklyn, NY",2 star rating,This place came highly recommended by our friend from Montreal but we were rather put off by the inflexibility of the menu and waitstaff. All we asked for was the grilled cheese panini without the onions as my 12 year old is seriously opposed to them. Sorry we can't remove them as all the sandwiches are premise and then grilled to order. I may not be the greatest home cook but a grilled cheese panini would not take much more than cheese and bread. That said the summer salad was very fresh and quite tasty. The Cuban sandwich had great flavor but a bit greasy. My takeaway if you are or have a picky eater this place is not for you

I was told the cuban panini is a must try at olive and gourmando so i wanted to see what the fuss was all about. The waiter was extremely nice despite how busy the restaurant is and repeated fill up our water. The food also came within reasonable time, or maybe we were just too busy catching up. Boy, was the panini good. The cheese, the pork, the lime and chipotle all came together perfectly. DEFINITELY WORTH THE HYPE. I was told that my friend's sandwiches were also both excellent. The portion is extremely generous, although i didn't hesitate to finish it all in one sitting.   Great place to catch up over brunch, and bonus ? a nice walk around old port after the meal."

/user_details?userid=JkCwFh1L1eWT8AvxsGhRRA,John G.,"Queens Village, NY",2 star rating,Spotted this place while walking in the area. It was packed so I figured it must be good. Got there at about 11:30 and it was a 20 minute wait. We were a party of 3. Ordered the poached egg panini and was informed that it was sold out. Ordered the mac and cheese for my son and they were out of that too. We ordered 2 orange juices and they only had one. That's kind of embarrassing for them to be out of these basic items by noon. No planning? I had the Cuban panini. It was not bad but not great either. Very salty. So much salt covers up the flavors of whatever you are eating. The salad was also very salty. Had I known it would be like that I would have asked for the dressing on the side. I'm not from Montreal so maybe that's how they like their salads but I've never had one that salty anywhere else. Ingredients were good but again with so much salt it's hard to enjoy them. Service was very good and friendly. Don't understand the high ratings but perhaps the sold out things on the menu are better. I can only review what I tried and was not impressed. Prices are also very expensive for what you get. Bill including tip was $85 for 3 sandwiches 2 salads and one orange juice. Had we all had drinks it would have been nearly $100 Canadian. In expensive cities like NY and Paris you can get better sandwiches and salads for less than half that. You have been warned.

/user_details?userid=iYcakOjAB3w-UOHrhwV2cw,Trace G.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"1. The WaitWe arrived at 11 am on a Saturday morning. There was a line that was out the door when we arrived and the place was packed. We were told the wait was at least 15 min, I think we were seated in 5 - sweet!2. The OrderAfter reviewing the fairly short menu, it was time to order. Poached eggs pls? We're sold out. Some OJ pls? We're also sold out. This was disappointing because what kind of breakfast places runs out of eggs and oranges? I didn't have the heart to show my disappointment as the waiter was accommodating and quickly got us the lunch menu as we didn't find anything else we really felt like ordering on the breakfast menu. 3. The FoodI end up ordering the Cubain panini from the lunch menu and the regular green salad as they didn't offer side salads. The salad for $7 was worth it. It was a nice portion for $7 - all fresh ingredients. They've got their own twist on this salad though, there are some fairly strong smelling herbs that make up a good portion of the salad. Unfortunately, I couldn't identify them as something I'm familiar with. There were some almonds, but other than that, it's a pretty no frills salad which was what I was looking for. The Cubain panini tasted great and comes in a fairly large portion. Great flavours and sauce! Is this going to be the best panini you've had in your life? Probably not, but it's darn good and up there. Lastly, my friend go the banana chocolate brioche to go which is supposedly their most famous pastry. We ended up eating this a little later in the afternoon, it tasted nice and chocolatey, but as far as the banana taste goes, we couldn't really find it. Perhaps it was just too much chocolate. 4. The DrinkNo OJ right? So I order the ""elixir"" some sort of green tea + ginger + ?one last thing I can't remember? Well seeing that I can't remember the last ingredient means I didn't taste it. In fact, I'm pretty sure I didn't taste any ginger either. As far as green teas go, there was a strong green tea taste. Overall, I felt completely ripped off by this drink even though it only cost $4.50."

I love French croissants and the pastry in the croissants was a little tough and gluten-y. But it was still good.  The cookie was really good too. My colleague had the latte and said it was nice and smooth.Then, my colleague and I shared the Salad #24. I am guessing it's named that because it has 24 ingredients? It was a vegan salad with a lot of amazing ingredients in it like pea shoots, pickled daikon, rainbow carrots, cashews, marinated tofu, basil, mint, sesame..... to name a few.

The place was packed, which in my opinion is always a good sign, and while waiting we had time to take in all the charming decor and the cozy ambience that this establishment embodies. Service here is top notch, we were never left looking for a waiter and as soon as our glasses were getting empty they were already offering us more rounds. The reason this place only got a 3 in my books is that the food was a bit of a disappointment. 3 out of the 4 of us ordered the Cuban Panini and one of us the Mac'n'Cheese. While the food tasted good it was too much of one thing and not enough of the other. The Cuban comes as just a Panini. No fries or salad. For the price I would have appreciated a tiny clump of lettuce on the side. It would have helped to balance out the dish too as the Cuban is a hearty and heavy sandwhich consisting of meat,cheese and bread...a little greens on the side would have complemented the dish nicely. Same goes for the Mac'n'Cheese, while deliciously rich and creamy, after a few bites it's almost too much without a bit of something to go with it. Again Salad or a side would have been ideal. I think I'd definitely give this place another shot on my next trip out to Montreal, perhaps for breakfast this time to try some of their pastries that actually looked quite appealing."

So, there's a salad on the menu that looks like it will fit the bill, but it's served on noodles.  Can I get it with just more greens and no noodles?  No, we can't do that.  Can you take your regular greens salad and add vegetables (that are on the menu for other dishes)?  No.  How about the salad and some of the smoked trout from a smoked trout sandwich (I'll pay for both).  No - we can bring you the sandwich and you can scrape it off yourself.  What??  Really??Ended up with a simple greens salad that was at least 50% parsley (wow, lovely).  And, for the rest of the party (who ordered stock menu items), nothing was actually very good.  (Nothing was horrible, mind you, just not worth the trip here.)  It was, however, VERY expensive and there was an extra serving of hipster pretension thrown in for good measure. (Oh, I won't even mention the wait for all this pretension because, after all, one does know what one is getting into when you see the line.)Finally, it's not even as if there was even a bit of apology from the waiter for the absolute refusal to alter any dish in any way - just an offhanded, ""we're a busy restaurant.""  Got it.  You're very important, we're just the customers."

I ordered the Cuban, which was delicious, but pricey at over $10 without any sides. I asked for a side of chips, and all they have are full size bags of chips made for multiple people...

After waiting to be seated (which on the weekend is a loooong time - it's a popular place), you get given a piece of paper with your table number. You then need to take this piece of paper to the queue (where all take-out orders are placed too), and give your order. After you've gotten your food, and are ready to pay, you have to get back in the queue (behind all the take-out people) to make your payment.

/user_details?userid=HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg,Yvonne T.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Walked over to Olive et Gourmando for breakfast as I had read several Yelp reviews about it.  While I won't agree with it being ""the country's greatest"" almond croissant... Their croissant was quite tasty and unique from other croissants I've tasted.  Their almond croissant is definitely denser than most. Very buttery and it is a very oblong shape... Almost not resembling the familiar crescent moon shape.  The best way to describe it's distinct taste is that the butter appears to be churned from ""raw"" cow's milk as there is a sharp dairy taste to it.  But it was a very creamy, almost creme-fraiche-like type of dairy freshness.  It is not a flaky croissant, but rather a buttery type.I also tried the pecan and raisin brioche. It was not teeth-wrenchingly sweet, and had just a tinge of tartness which I would guess comes from a raisin-y syrup or glaze. The brioche was very buttery, flaky on the outer ""rings"" and dense an buttery in the center.I got a cup of cappuccino to wake me up. The foam was creamy without being too heavy. It wad a great cappuccino!I also thought I should mention their fruit bowl as its not the ol' boring one you'd see in Toronto. Olive et Gourmando's fruit bowl comes with fresh figs, julienned apples, passion fruit, mandarin orange - just to name a few. You get assigned a table. Are given an order form with your table number scribbled down which you bring to the counter, and they will bring you your food after you order. Then at the end you pay at the counter. Only negative is that its cash only.A great place to grab brekkie.  Wish we had more places like this in Toronto!"
/user_details?userid=BI43zsVnKZHtMI_4GBStng,Julie K.,"San Jose, CA",5 star rating,"Olive et Gourmando is exactly the type of little cafe that I wish I had in my town. When you enter you're greeted by a tantalizing display of baked goods, along with a chalkboard menu of coffee drinks. But you can also sit down for a light meal if you wish. When I told the hostess I wanted to have lunch, she reserved me a seat in the front window and directed me toward the counter at the back of the restaurant. Here, another chalkboard listed several sandwiches. But the one that I chose was the truite fume. There were also salads and side dishes. I ordered a salade verte to accompany my sandwich, then went to enjoy my seat at the window and wait for my lunch. The salad and sandwich both were generously sized. The sandwich was a truly delicious combination of smoked trout mixed with capers, sun-dried tomatoes, and red onions, and then layered between the two halves of a grilled white bread round with herbed cream cheese and fresh spinach leaves. The mixture of saltiness and smokiness balanced by the cream cheese was fantastic. The salad was equally fabulous. I'd expected a plain green salad but what I got was so much better, though still deliciously simple: a combination of watercress, parsley, and mâché covered with a lot of toasted slivered almonds and dressed with a light vinaigrette. Both dishes were wonderfully delectable--easily the best salad and sandwich I've had in a long time. Maybe ever. On the way out I couldn't resist getting a palmier to go. As I later discovered, this too was excellent. I'm used to palmier that are simply buttery and sweet, but this one went to the next level. The sugar had actually caramelized, coating the entire cookie in a slightly burnt caramel goodness. If there were an Olive et Gourmando at home, I'd never need to eat anywhere else."

I got a cafe latte, my fiance ordered bancha green and shared a raison scone.  Their small latte is about 8 ounces which is smaller than most places so it was stronger than I was expecting it to be but still enjoyed it.  The bancha tea was served in a teapot with a cup both served on a wooden platter - cute.  It was paired perfectly with the raison scone which was sweet and had a light lemon flavour to it.  I'm usually not a fan of raisons but this was good. From the brief look at the lunch items (mostly sandwiches), they were all just under $10. I wish I had a bigger stomach. Note: ALL the baked goods are made in house - yummeh!"
/user_details?userid=EcCOEfFwgaBmbvIMKi7UsQ,Food Doctor 2.,"New Haven, CT",4 star rating,Yummy. Came in here at 11am on a Thursday. Trying to beat the crowd. That didn't happen. It was packed already!! We waited about 5 minutes to be seated. There were a lot of young and middle aged hip Quebecers at this joint. Strangers sitting next to strangers. Tight seating. Very enjoyable. This is a place people go for good food and a good sangwich. Menu is diverse with eclectic choices. I went with the grilled cheese and an espresso. It came to me promptly after ordering it. It did not disappoint. As I took my first bite and felt the salty crunch beneath my teeth I knew this was going to be good. Bite. Tangy onions. Salty cheese. Bite chew bite bite chew bite chew and some swallows mixed in there. I finished it quickly because it was so good and I just couldn't stop myself. The espresso had a nice burnt chocolaty taste. It was a good espresso. Not the best I've ever had but it was good. We didn't get pastries to to but there were an ample amount of them and they all looked good. I bet they all had a nice crisp to them just like my sandwich. Go to this place and get a sandwich. You can thank me later.

Service was helpful and pleasant. Since we had arrived too early for lunch, we were limited to their breakfast menu and opted for the following:Poached egg on your face paniniA delicious panini filled with poached egg salad, comte cheese, prosciutto, and roasted tomatoes.  The egg salad was light and fluffy and perfectly complemented by the sweet and saltyness of the prosciutto and roasted tomatoes. My favorite breakfast panini by far.Almond CroissantMy fellow yelpers don't lie. This is a must have at O+G.  I particularly liked that this pastry was fluffy throughout even though it appears that it wouldn't be upon first glance. Olive et Gourmando makes me sigh with a smile.  It will definitely remain on my bookmarked lists of eateries to visit again the next time I'm in Montreal."

/user_details?userid=uvqhDdqRyl1aqTlxu_UZtg,Deb M.,"Canton, MI",4 star rating,"Having heard about this place from several different sources it was a must on the list for our recent Montreal visit.  Unfortunately, we were only in the fine city for 3 full days and I had a long list of musts.  I was familiar with the general location of the restaurant but hadn't pinpointed the exact location when we came upon it by chance while wandering around the neighborhood.We already had lunch plans for the day but because my feet and my nose wouldn't let me walk past without going in, we decided to get some pastries for later.  One step inside and I knew that no matter how packed our culinary itinerary was - we would be back!The first visit we took away a chocolate croissant and perhaps one of the best bites from our entire trip - a turtle bar.  The shortbread was amazing and it was topped with a very rich chocolate ganache.  It really was once of the best sweet bites in a trip filled with so many!I managed to talk my husband into coming back for breakfast the morning we left Montreal for home...quite the feat since he had one thing on his mind: the 9 hour drive.  To which I said that meant we needed a very special breakfast to fuel the ride home.  In the end, I won out but just barely, especially when a parking snafu would have no doubt resulted in a  ticket (parking signs in French  - gotta love them).  The place is so popular that there wasn't a (legal) place to park within 2 blocks.  The weekend morning was a busy mess.  A hostess kindly explained the procedure while hubby dashed out to move the car.  I was assigned a table, given a card that I should take to the pastry counter to order, and found myself in the midst of a loud group of tourists, regulars, and one very unhappy little girl who protested quite loudly that she wanted out of the clutches of her daddy's arms.  Wondering if I had made a mistake by dragging hubby here rather than grabbing a bite to eat at many of the places closer to our hotel I ordered a juice, coffee, almond croissant and the deliciously sounding 'egg on your face' panini.  I returned to my assigned table, was given a bottle of water and then shortly our coffee and juice arrived.  I began to settle down a bit as I surveyed the yummy looking food being enjoyed at the tables around me and knew that what was to follow would be worth the headache of parking and slight delay in getting on the road.  I loved the drawings on the chalkboard and found it curious to read that one Saturday in June  of 1998 only 3 customers were served all day long.  What a stark contrast that was to the bustle of this Saturday morning where there was a constant line out the door!    While I was happy for their success, I secretly thought to myself that perhaps a happy medium between 3 customers and the hundreds (literally) that would overrun the peaceful dining area would be nice.    I was pleased when the panini and croissant arrived.  We shared both and had a happy little breakfast.  The panini was a good size and the bread was toasted perfectly.  The prosciutto was of good quality and paired well with the poached egg salad.  Not a fan of runny egg yolk, I'm happy to report that the eggs were soft but not runny.  It was a very delicious sandwich.The set-up was odd to me in that we had to pay at the end of the meal by getting in the long line again, giving the cashier our table number and then being cashed out.  Perhaps it was a system that worked better when not so crowded.  Or, as my husband stated, perhaps it was to tempt you one last time with the delicious pastries while waiting in line.  If it was the ladder, it certainly did its trick with me as I couldn't help but order a chocolate croissant for the road (sadly, none of the cookies or that amazing turtle bar were available at the time).If you are in Montreal, you must stop, even if only for a sweet bite to eat.  Oh, and if you can possibly walk over, I'd strongly suggest that as well!!  Happy noshing."

It was good but I think there's at least a tiny bit of hype associated with it. We were told it would be a 20 min wait for lunch. In other circumstances I might've thought twice but this was O+G.. 20 mins was a blessing. Anyway, after about 25 mins, we were seated and my expectations were sky high at this point if that wasn't already obvious. I got what might be the most expensive thing on the menu - the Mac and cheese at about $19 while my husband got a chicken sandwich. Once our food arrived (tastefully plated in a rustic cafe way), I realized I was going to have to reset my expectation here. Mac and cheese was good but not $19 good. It came with a salad and that was fine too but again $19?? I thought my husband's chicken sandwich was better. Overall, the ambience of the place is very hipsterish but you are also seated shoulder to shoulder.

The almond croissant and brioche was the best I've ever had. The croissant was flaky, light, and just the right amount of sweetness. The brioche was light, fluffy, and chewy without being doughy. The service was wonderful. Everything was great and I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a breakfast, brunch, bake goods place in Montreal."

Tasty sandwiches, pastries, wine, beer and coffee.  Great atmosphere and a cool (albeit touristy) location near the old port.The best compliment I could say give this place, beyond great food and drink, is that the pacing was perfect.  Although there was a long wait to get in on the rainy day, they never rushed us, and we felt very comfortable lounging for an extended late lunch.   As an American, it had a very ""euro"" feel, in a good way.  If I ever make it back to Montreal, i'll definitely head back here."

They serve various sweet and savoury breads, along with hot and cold panini and several delicious looking salads.  I had Le Cubain panini (a typical Cuban) and the apple salad that was to die for!  Oh, the humanity!  I love that they brought me a whole bottle (branded as such) de l'eau. I find that when I dine alone, those things are usually reserved.  I also had the chocolate brownie which had huge chunks of chocolate in it.  It was good, but not the best I've ever had.  The food was good, the atmosphere was fantastic and the staff was very helpful even though I was only able to speak rudimentary French!  Note: OeG takes cash or debit ONLY, but they nicely tell you that before they seat you."

I don't even know how to begin.At least 3 friends recommended O+G to us when we mentioned about our trip to Montreal. One of them even went back 3 times on their last visit. We had to go, right? We were completed shocked by how good the food was. That includes the sandwiches, salads, pastries and drinks. So what happened? In a short few days trip to Montreal, we went back the second time just to have other food on the menu. It was one of the best restaurant experiences we'd had in Montreal, or in fact, the world. Sounds exaggerated? I know but we do feel that way. Get used to it.We tried a bunch of sandwiches: Le Cubaine, Cajun chicken, vegan and pomodoro. We also ordered the extravagant tomato plate with this crazily addictive crouton bits drenched in sun-dried tomato infused olive oil. They are beyond good, the flavour of the dishes screamed extravagant. They have a full spectrum of tastes and flavours.The special drinks: sweet lemon tea and vanilla strawberry lemonade, were both excellent companion to the off-the-chart flavourful sandwiches.Be sure to go before 2-2:30 on a weekday because some sandwiches will be sold out around that time.I would not mind taking a 7-hour drive to Montreal just to eat a panini at O+G, like, today."

I have only been there for lunch, and even though the place is always packed, they will find a table for you within a few minutes! Overall a very good service.The food is just incredible! It's a mix between a sandwich place and a salad bar, with the menu written in chalk on the walls. I highly recommend the cuban sandwich, but get there early because they do run out!I have never tried the coffee shop and pastries part of the café, but it looks incredible!Because of its location and the quality of their food the prices are on the high part of the scale for a sandwich ($9), and it's widely worth it!!!Watch out for opening hours they are closed on Sunday and Monday (which is very rare in Montréal)I just wished they had other locations around the city!"

One of my friends also had the homemade ricotta and honey with toast and she said it was some of the best she'd ever had. My only complaint is that they don't sell their amazing green tea in bulk but that only means I will have to stock up next time I'm there (if they decide to sell it). I will definitely be coming back whenever I'm in Montréal again.

We opted for dessert, but I kind of wish we hadn't. While the desserts looked very appealing, the almond croissant and chocolate brioche, they were a little dry and we didn't finish either.

I'm not a huge fan of spicy food (which this sandwich was) so I didn't get one of my own, but decided to try it once it came out. I loved it so much that I ended up eating half of my boyfriends sandwich. Seriously one of the best sandwiches I've tasted in a while. Food was delicious and coffee was fantastic.

The food is divine - tons for the vegetable lover, sandwich aficionado, or soup slurper. Prices range, but you don't have to be loaded to eat there. Perfect to run into on a cold Montreal day, for a pastry and a coffee - or a warm meal. Rush hours will see a line form, probably worth up to a 15 minute wait....unless you're freezing and it's winter...in which case, find a coffee shop and wait it out there!"

There is a nicely curated arrangements of tables and seats, but despite the busyness, we did not wait more than five minutes for a seat. Service was solid as many people attended to us while we were there. I started with a latte which was perfect for the grey day outside. There were so many options on the menu that appealed to me, but ended up with The Gustavo panini that had chicken, portobello mushroom, balsamic, maple mustard, cheese.. man, it was killer. A lot of their verbiage in the restaurant/cafe speak to their food being 'homemade' and 'made with love' and that is so apparent. When you are done you walk up and cash out at the counter which is very smart. They have you wait in a line that forms along a beautifully arranged counter of delicious pastries, cookies and sweets. If my sandwich hadn't filled me up to the top, I could have impulse bought one of everything. I highly recommend a visit to this clear local and tourist favorite."

The cafe has a really nice atmosphere and it was definitely a popular lunch place. We had to wait for at least 20 minutes before we were seated. It was worth the wait though! Every dish in the menu is homemade so once they are sold out, they are gone until the next batch is ready. We wanted to try the Viva Las Vegan cold sandwich and the salad of the day, unfortunately both of them were sold out. So we ended up having the Homemade Ricotta ""Salty"" and #24 salad. And they were both delicious! We also had the banana chocolate brioche which wasn't too bad. This is an awesome place to drop by when you are in the Old Montreal area."

/user_details?userid=ecTZnCrYbmFEV1SRbkkseg,Joe S.,"Burlington, VT",1 star rating,"My girlfriend brought me here for brunch at the recommendation of a friend of hers. We got there and it was about a thirty minute wait to get a table on a Sunday. The place was pretty crowded, but they seemed to have plenty of staff so no one seemed to be waiting too long to get there food or anything.The problem arose when I looked at the menu. I was allergic to everything on it except for I think toast with PB and J. PB and j was not what I had in mind for brunch. Normally this is not a problem as something like cheese or nuts can just not be added to the dish when it's made. This has been the case at literally every other place I've been at that serves food. However, upon requesting this omission of cheese from an egg sandwich from the waiter, he told us that they couldn't make it without cheese because everything was made that morning and the food couldn't be altered since it was already made. I thought this was strange and requested more time to look at the menu since he shot down this first request and my back up option. Upon realizing that everything else likely contained dairy or nuts in some form and that they weren't making things, we decided to leave.  I found it odd that they weren't cooking anything upon being order but I guess just heating it up or serving it cold. Also the two egg dishes both contained poached eggs, which sounded unappealing to me. I wouldn't want to eat poached eggs that were made hours ago. Again this isn't after eating any food but is the only thing I can infer from what the waiter said to me. Also I am anglophone, but there is no way this was a language barrier thing because this was one of the most Anglo-centric eateries I've been to in montreal. We ended up going to the boucherie across the street, which was quite good and fulfilled my request without question."

/user_details?userid=h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,Candace C.,"Las Vegas, NV",4 star rating,"The Skinny: really great pastries including the almond croissants and the chocolate brioches (4) The service, if dining in, can be confusing because you have to order everything at the back counter.  Unfortunately, the restaurant is claustrophobic, and noisy. They also don't take credit cards unless you have over a $10 purchase (3) Overall, this is a great little breakfast/brunch/lunch spot. If you can't take the crowd, get your stuff to go (4).After discovering this place on Yelp, I ventured to this cafe at least 3 times during my short stay. I ate in once but after experiencing the crowd decided to do take-out afterwards.This place is definitely hopping. Primarily a breakfast/lunch place, every time I went here, it was literally brimming with people. At 2:30 pm, you had to wait 10-15 minutes to get a table for three. Service is confusing so I'll give you the low-down. If you decide to eat in, your waitress will hand you a meal ticket which you are supposed to bring to the back sandwich counter. Order all your drinks, pastries and sandwiches there and they will bring out your order to you afterwards. If you want to add anything to your meal, you just go to the back counter and let the server know what you want and they will add it to your tab. When you are done, you line up at the pastry/to-go line and pay there.All I can say is pastries are king here. I had three different types of brioche and almond croissant here. Everything was pretty good here. Personally I think the best of the bunch was the chocolate brioche. The lovely pastry was brimming with Valharona chocolate encased with a flaky, buttery bread. Chocoholic porn. 'Nuff said.Almond croissants were also delicious however were a little on the thinner side. The maple/nut and banana/chocolate brioches was a little too moist for my taste which was detrimental to the pastry itself. The flavours however were very good despite this which was why this place gets a 4 for food.On the down side, this place is very crazy. Literally, there is no space in this cafe. So don't expect to have a quiet little snack around here. Noise is at a premium while you'll probably be able to overhear your neighbours conversations. Another con is the credit card policy (no credit card over $10). I also wished they made chai lattes too.Overall, a great little breakfast/lunch spot in downtown Montreal (4)."

The casual atmosphere and excellent food make for a fantastic vibe.And the food is terrific. I had the Cubano sandwich, a crispy Panini with pork, ham, cheese, and one of the most delicious sauces I've ever had on a Cuban sandwich - something like a super-savory artichoke sauce with just the right amount of chili pepper. But what made me even happier was the side salad. Perfectly dressed and seasoned, it had sliver-thin slices of sweet red onion and the best mix of greens I've had almost anywhere - lettuces and other salad greens, but also baby winter greens like kale, and a good amount of herbs - parsley, tarragon, who knows what else. Every side salad I have will be measured against the heaven that they make here.The baked goods are excellent, too. This time, brought home a brownie (it's somehow light and dense at the same time - as though the batter was baked just long enough to hold it together) and a chocolate chip cookie (very good, buttery, crisp).When you're done eating, just go to the register and tell them your table number. There's a dish for tips next to the register, and the staff splits them. It all works very smoothly.It's hard not to feel like you're at the center of things when you eat here.

/user_details?userid=W_EQFi2fXpBtuRm510cCpA,Lauretta L.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"I was too full to eat a sandwich, which made me quite sad because I had read so many rave reviews about the Poached Egg sandwich and the Cuban. I had to limit myself to the Elixir and an almond croissant. The Elixir was light and refreshing but packed lots of flavor. It's a drink that you sip on, due to the tangy ginger. I've had many bad ginger drinks lately and am relieved that I finally found one that did it justice. The almond croissant wasn't impressive...it probably would have been better if they served it toasted. I've had much better ones in SF. Much, much better. However, I loved the ambiance here and even chatted with a stranger across the table.The only downfall here was that 2 of the staff gave me some attitude for not knowing I had to get a table first before ordering. Some patience and a smile for an out-of-towner would have been nice."

However, I did feel that the pastries were nothing special. My husband and I had a chocolate croissant and banana brioche and felt they are nowhere near as good as other bakeries.

The wait to eat in, even at 1:30 on a Friday was nearly half an hour, but it's totally worth it. They have a daily soup (Roasted pepper the day I was there. Drat) and a selection of both hot and cold sandwiches. There are also daily salad selections to choose from. I went pretty simply and got the Smoked Trout sandwich, consisting of  hot-smoked trout, capers, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach and herbed cream cheese. It was really quite good. The smokiness of the trout blended so well with the rest of the ingredients and oh man, the bread. This is a great example of what a sandwich should be. Together in this way, the ingredients offer a taste palate you wouldn't get from any other incarnation. The man next to me was determinedly devouring their Cuban sandwich, a favorite apparently. He sure looked pleased. On my way out I grabbed what turned out to be the best latte I've had in recent memory and a palmier pastry to nibble on later. I would go out of my way to grab a pastry here in the mornings.   Did I mention to can get everything à porter (take away)? I wish I was closer!"

My wife and I waited over twenty minutes to get a table but our drink orders were taken shortly after sitting down. The mocha I ordered was decorated beautifully and the flavor was the perfect balance of bitter and sweet. The maple pecan brioche we ordered while waiting for our mains was sublimely fresh and gooey. They are not shy with the maple syrup nor the pecans, and for 4.75 it is superb value. I ordered the oeuf coquette and my wife ordered the pizza pocket panini. My favorite part of the coquette was the warm and chewy bread that accompanied the coquette. It was drizzled with olive oil and had such incredible texture that I ate it on its own. Like the coquette, the standout component of the panini was the delicious bread. I was left with a heavy feeling after the meal, and would have appreciated a side salad to provide some lightness."

Additionally, I had a glass of one of the best (microbrew) beers of my life! It was a wonderfully flavorful beer but still on the light side. My server was kind enough to bring out a bottle so I could take a photo. On my way out, I grabbed some baked goods to go. I highly recommend the super- chocolatey cookies, and the sticky buns although I really don't think you can go wrong.

There is a set of new stores and new culinary destinations making names for themselves. Olive et Gourmand is an affordable gourmet sandwich spot amongst this revival.Upon entering, a place to sit and eat is picked for you and you move to the back to order your sandwich. There are several options daily, using fresh ingredients until they run out. I chose the Chevre Chaud, which was an answer to the American grilled cheese. It was a pain blanc bun with chevre and caramelized onions, and then grilled on a panini. The bread was perfectly white and fluffy with a good panini formed crust on the outside. The cheese on the edges also became toasted and caramelized.  It was served with a homemade ketchup dipping sauce, analogous to tomato soup but served cold, a bit thicker, and a bit sweeter. It was the perfect counter balance to the chevre and the caramelized onions in the sandwich. The delightful sauce sunk into the sandwich like a glorious edible sponge. Each bite is a treat for the palette.I loved Olive et Gourmando so much that I returned the following day."

I tend to be pretty traditional about classic dishes - if a dish varies quite a bit from the classic I think it should be called something else. When I first saw my french toast I started to panic because it was a huge, thick slab of bread and it was covered in what looked like granola. I was skeptical. However, it was absolutely delicious. I usually hate nuts in sweets, but the nut crumble totally worked. I would compare the yogurt topping to creme fraiche and using that instead of whipped cream was very clever."

Both are little Parisian-esque cafeterias that showcase delightful bakeries and serve gourmet sandwiches made-to-order in a casual semi self-serve style. Coincidentally, Olive et Gourmando is on Rue Saint-Paul Ouest...huh, look at that. Cubain...zesty!  Roll crevettes + crabe   Chevre Chaud with homemade ketchup   Olive et Gourmando is a smaller, less polite version - I found one server scary, and I'm pretty scary myself.  You are directed to a seat and then given a sheet of paper.  You take it and head to the back to order. My sister and I got there late, what with our stop at Jeans Jeans Jeans!  By the time we arrived, they were sold out of the sandwich I wanted - egg on your face - booyah!  I feel like it needs to be followed with a booyah and two-finger gun shot motion?!?  I opted for the Chevre Chaud aka grilled goat cheese while my sister ordered the Cuban.  Then we decided to share the shrimp and crab roll. A little well-known fact for you: the average sister duo would share two sandwiches...but we above-average oinkers share three plus dessert.  All in all, the sandwiches-paninis-whatever you want to call them were very good, although the shrimp roll did not hold a candle to our mom's.  Our mother makes the BEST sandwiches in the world - her homemade chicken salad and shrimp sandwiches kick ass. For dessert I got the turtle bar which my sister could only nibble at because it had nuts.  Whoops, I'm still getting used to the fact she's avoiding nuts.  Poor sister recently discovered she may be allergic to them and it's still under investigation. It's really sad. Like, really sad. Our family is like animal kingdom, when you tell a pig she can't eat something, the jungle cries. All in all, I liked Olive et Gourmando; it may have been good-er if it wasn't so pricey. We finished off our plates and walked off the calories around Old Montreal. I want to go back to try the Apple turnover and egg on your face...but this time I will be sure not to be trop tard...Olive et Gourmando is trendy and fashionable, but a little high maintenance, huh, sounds a little like me *wink*."

My tongue would not have been able to pick up any of those tastes. All it knows is good or bad). They also have a bakery with cookies and brownies and more. I had a brownie that wasn't half bad, but I've definitely had better.The location is on a lively corner in Old Montreal. You'll see locals and businessmen walking by. There are also boutiques and art galleries galore, so after lunch, you can walk around and entertain yourself."

The menu takes typical sandwiches and salads and kicks it up a notch with their own unique twist to add flavor. We enjoyed everything we ordered. Grilled Chicken Sandwich with guacamole, mango, tomato on flat bread. Caesar Salad with chicken, bacon, croutons. They also have a take out section where you can get everything to go including everything on the menu, coffee, and trail mixes. They have a very good vegetarian selection on their menu Tofu sandwiches as well as soba noodle salad with peanut dressing. This place takes CASH ONLY."

The paninis are great, but are they worth the 45 min+ wait? Pastries are okay, soups and salads are mediocre, the brunch menu is bad (worst chia bowl I've ever had and French toast was tasteless). Just get the sandwiches to go and eat at the park nearby."

I could have done with just half of a sandwich.  It is a bit on the pricey side for a sandwich, but they use quality ingredients.  The water is a quick walk away, so if you order to go, take a stroll down there and sit on the picnic benches to enjoy your meal."

But though that happened to me here, I'm just speaking in general about that area.  However, here at Olive & Gourmando there is this attitude that they're such a cool place and you're kind of lucky to be there as a customer.  I didn't think it was any big deal or thrill compared to anywhere else and there are certainly many similar restaurants in the US and even in my town.  It's fine, the food is fresh and entirely decent, but I just think it's nothing special honestly."

The wait was kind of insane for people in groups, but fortunately I got seated almost right away because I was by myself. I ordered the in your face panini, a cup of drip coffee, and an almond croissant. The sandwich was good and aptly named because the flavours really did punch you in the face. The spicy kick was lovely and exciting. What wasn't so lovely and exciting, though, was the coffee... And the croissant. The coffee wasn't horrible, but it wasn't awesome either. The croissant was just plain stale. I don't know if it was a day old or if the baker just didn't factor in the humidity of the air (it was raining that day), but if I come in about mid-morning for breakfast or brunch...I kind of expect a fresh, crisp, light croissant--not the sticky, stale,and quite frankly, dense roll that they brought to me.

Being vegetarian, this pretty much left us with no sandwiches to order (what we came for in the first place). So we ended up waiting an hour for nothing to eat.

For the sake of Yelp, and my appetite, I had to go. And yes, it's amazing.O & G has a charming, Paris-like cafe feel. Wood tables, freshly baked goods on display, delicious smells and classic but funky decor. The place was packed (so be prepared for a bit of a wait), but you're assigned a table number when one becomes available and then go stand in line to place a food order. If you're looking for take-out, that's also an option and you stand in the same line to place an order.They have about 9 sandwiches written on chalkboards above the food displays - my memory is failing me, but they were all classic with a twist. Chicken with pesto and roasted red peppers, caramelized onions with some sort of meat....something spicy. My apologies for the vague descriptions, but I guarantee they were delicious and fresh.  They also have an array of fresh salads, fruit salads, and  REALLY good fresh breads & spreads. I had the ricotta cheese with a yummy olive oil and parsley, cherry tomatoes and warm bread with a garlic-y glaze. It was delicious, and great to share.We also tried the baked goods (how could we not), and tried a butter croissant, banana loaf, and a mixed fruit and nut muffin.

All the pastries are wonderful, especially the cheese biscuit which has a little cayenne kick to it.  Wifey loved the cuban panini.  I thought the filling was great but I personally am not a big fan of overly toasted bread (not burnt).  That being said, I would order one of their paninis again any day and love to devour some cheese biscuits for dessert.  And do yourself a favor and get a large cappucino.Not really that expensive in comparison to all the tourist traps you could get sucked into in the Old City."

This is a Montreal institution and definitely worth a visit. One of my favorite cafes, in fact, because of the quality of the food. But its success is its weak spot. It gets rather chaotic and crowded - so not a place where you can usually enjoy a beverage or a snack in tranquility. They have servers who bring your food and drinks, but they make everyone crowd around the cashier to order and then you have to queue up a second time to pay after eating. (Why?) Some of the pleasure of visiting is lost by the whole ""process"" you have to go through."

/user_details?userid=D0E-lGF7zXUJjFJEgUePsQ,Alexandra G.,"Alingsås, Sweden",4 star rating,"Olive et Gourmando is a cozy little cafe that is on the outskirts of the Old Town. It is decorated in a very inviting yet casual way that makes you want to sit there for hours. It is old-fashioned in a way that it has gourmet food on display everywhere, but there is something rustic yet modern that instills trust in me - so I don't have to order something safe on the menu (like the other old town restos). It is sorta split into two with a coffee station and a sandwich station. You sit down at a table which has a little flag with a number, and then when you order, you tell them what number you have. I have had the Cubain there which I think is a Cuban sandwich and has nothing to do with Kurt Cobain. The sandwich here is a pressed sandwich or hot panini with ham, braised pork and gruyere. Very tasty. It is not the biggest sandwich and doesn't come with a side. It makes up for it small size in flavor. My friend ordered a Cesar Salad with chicken which she said was good, although there were only two pieces of chicken in the salad. The food is visually appealing to the point you could have a photo session with it, and so did a man sitting behind my friend. He staggered his bread pieces around his soup (I think it was), and then spent half and hour shooting it. We tried going today at around 4pm on a sunday and it was closed. So you might want to check the opening hours before heading here!"

So we waited for long time to get 4 seats , finally after getting seats the service guy check with his senior how to go about accommodating baby, it was a big shock to see cold face and hear raw blunt statement ""sir, you can't take stroller inside"" with no articulation and communication towards customers. Later we asked the service guy if there is high chair again he referred back to his senior lady, this time just a don't care hand wave signal to the service guy. We don't have complaint about food but about the attitude and expression towards us that left a sour taste.

I've been a patron of Oilive et Gourmando (in the sense of literally having spent thousands of dollarinos there!) for over three years now. I 'm a regular, so it's hard for me to write a totally unbiased review. If you don't know O&G, it's unique among breakfast/lunch cafés in Montreal. The atmosphere reminds one of a New York or LA hipster café, but unlike the latter, O&G is not pretentious in the least, and everyone is treated in a totally egalitarian way no matter who you are and how often you come here. I hate places with attitude about how cool they are, and how lucky you are to be hanging out there. There's none of that BS at O&G, and it is cool without trying. It's first come first serve, and you'll wait at least 20-30 minutes for a table between Noon and 1. If you can't stand the wait, head straight past the line of folks waiting up front, and continue straight back to the glass vitrines, where you can order to go. The great thing about O&G is they make their own everything, and they only make just enough for each day, so you're guaranteed things will be fresh. The soups are usually great, although having eaten so many of them I notice that the flavor profiles tend to be repeated; they are usually spicy with a good bit of acidity. My main critique of O&G, that the flavors can be a bit one-note, is also praise, because they do things with incredible consistency and high-standards. The salads are better than anywhere else I've tried in town, and you won't find any mushy or blackened leaves here. Try the Caesar salad con pollo, which is a great mix of bacon, capers, and parmesan with romaine and kale. Also a classic is the No. 24, a good vegan noodle salad. For sandwiches, the spicy cajun chicken with its great blend of mango and guacamole is ""nummers"". Another favorite, especially in winter, is the Cubain, with its decadent hot, cheesy, meaty goodness. The pastries are all exceedingly rich, and at times too heavy for my palate, but the brownie and the Belgian chocolate pecan cookie are great and will put you in chocolate / butter overload territory. The brioche is way too heavy though. Coffee is very good here too, and they have a nice tea selection. All in all, O&G is a great place to have lunch and / or spend a morning in a buzzing yet cozy place with excellent, friendly service, and attention to detail."

When walking into one of Montreal's hippest cafe's I'm not sure what hits you first: the afternoon light washing through the windows falling on the dark wood furniture, the rich smell of espresso and freshly baked bread, or the excited chatter of the crowd as they wait patiently for the bustling waiters to bring them their newly prepared food. The space itself is beautiful, big wood tables with a family dinning room seating style, smaller cafe tables and a bar with high stools that is perfect for people watching. The menu is scribbled across a dusty black chalkboard, showing that the menu choices change every day. The crowd draws in Montreal's local people, some coming to work on their computers and some coming to grab lunch with a friend. Between the undying love for quality food and the love the owners, Dy Solomon and Eric Girard, have for each other, the atmosphere of this little cafe in Old Montreal can only be described as enchanting.What's Really Good?Fresh bread baked on the premises. Itay's Illy coffee. Creative sandwich combinations. Dense chocolate brownies. Quality ingredients. Warm atmosphere. Polite and fast waiters. A history of an adorable love affair. What else could you ask for? Olive and Gourmando is one of Old Montreal's most popular breakfast and lunch destinations for many reasons. Take out is available, so even if you don't have time to wait for a table or don't want to deal with the chaos of a hungry crowd, you still won't miss on a tasty and healthy lunch. With meat, vegetarian and vegan options, Olive and Gourmando is a good place for everyone to stop by.You'll wanna know:Don't go with a big group since seating is limited, the menu changes daily so you'll always have new choices, go early in the day because they only make so much of all of their sandwiches and the type you want might run out early!"

I would have given it 5 stars except it is pretty expensive, even for the quality. When back in Montreal, I would go again, though once per trip is the splurge limit. The brioche is quite good. We also had a fruit cup which was good, though way too much. Between my husband and me, we ordered two brioche and one fruit cup, which was too much for the two of us (and my husband has a pretty good appetite). The coffees are good but order the large size. It is about twice as much as the petite for just slightly more money. Fresh orange juice was a nice treat.The only downside is the cost - 2 lattes, 2 OJ, 2 brioche, and 1 fruit cup came to over $50."

I got the Herbivore salad last time, and it was also great.  Plus their desserts are quite nice.  It is super busy, so expect to wait, but the service is friendly considering."

Closed on Sundays and Mondays so make your way here on weekdays or Saturday mornings."
/user_details?userid=JSbptCz_mzQ0sQJN94wcwA,Elina S.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"LOVEEEED this place! No wonder there are so many reviews and so many positive 5 stars. We came here on a Saturday afternoon during our stay in Montreal and came back on our last day before the airport because it was just that good. On Saturday afternoon it was packed, with locals, tourists, you name it, so we had to wait like a half an hour to get a table, but it was definitely worth it. The second time we came was on a Wednesday around the same time and the wait was only 15 minutes so it really depends, but expect to wait a little. Now, onto the food, it was superb, the Cuban sandwich, toasted, warm, gooey, a lil spicy, was oh em gee delicious. Now onto the pastries, we had both the almond croissant and the tangy blueberry tart, and they were both spectacular, I felt like I got them from the streets of Paris, they were just that good. The next day we came back and tried the Cajun chicken sandwich and the goat cheese, caramelized onion with spicy ketchup one, and once again, filled with soo much flavor. I don't think you can go wrong with any item on the menu, from the drinks, sandwiches, pastries, all are top notch. The atmosphere is buzzing as well, making it much more enjoyable and fun. We loved it here and def. recommend it for all the foodies."

/user_details?userid=wa_5LpqqzmPqyrgHBp5fYQ,cam f.,"Vancouver, Canada",1 star rating,"While there were many good reviews, I found my experience to be lacking, if not slightly comical.  For me the confusion lied with the line to pay the bill. This line consisted of people buying food from the bakery and people waiting to pay for their meals. There were two women taking money, one was the cashier and the other presumably baking and dealing with payment at the same time. The people in front of me were being helped by one cashier so I moved to the next one. This is where the stereotypical French/English Canadian culture clash began. The malevolent little baker yelled at me to get to the end of the line. A little confused I returned to my spot in line. She then yelled at me a second time, 'sir these men have paid!', pointing at the men behind me in line. 'They've paid?' I repeated, totally confused. 'Yes, they paid!' She yelled, clearly losing any patience she had with an ignorant line cutting anglophone. I looked at the man behind me who was as confused as I was. I looked at her with what I can only assume was a stupid look on my face and said 'sooo...'. She mockingly made a stupid face back at me and just stared at me. It began to dawn on me that she meant that the men had YET to pay. The man behind me told her that I had been in front of him the whole time. To which she responded that I could stay in line if the man behind me said it was alright. For some odd reason I felt the urge to apologize to the man behind me. He laughed and said her behaviour was unbelievable. I finally was afforded the privilege to pay her and she threw the change in to my hand without looking at me. I exited onto the street somewhat baffled and embarrassed. The food was good if not a little pricey, but not good enough to be treated in such a manner."

/user_details?userid=-S2tlyUUAUl6mE_A-8MUzw,Judd S.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"This corner café in Old Montreal is seriously one of the best in the entire city. The food and pastries are absolutely second to none. Everything I have had here has been incredibly creative, fresh, and tasty. The atmosphere is also truly charming. I love their Franglais plays on words written on their chalkboard walls; the charming old seating and the windows filled with plants that open onto the cobbled streets and three-hundred year old buildings. It would be improved if they added a row of street seating (were it legal) for those beautiful summer days. And it is insanely crowded - at 3 PM on a Wednesday, no less. I am not sure if there is ever a time you will feel relaxed here...but that's what you get when you offer the best food in the best surroundings in a neighborhood somewhat surprisingly lacking in other quality offerings. If you are going to Old Montreal, make this your morning or afternoon repose, bar none."
/user_details?userid=VkxUlN2da5CCaRum_KmXVw,Sachin B.,"White Plains, NY",4 star rating,"One can't help but pine for the culinary comfort of a Parisienne cafe when walking the cobblestone streets of Old Montreal. When in search of a place to have breakfast we happened upon this place which had quite a line at 10 am on a friday. Stupidly we opted to go to a place across the street that was fairly empty called Marche de la Vilette which ended up being a failure. Angry we went back across the street just to check out the menu and I ended up getting a sensual chocolate banana brioche bun. The butter caused see thru grease stains in the takeaway paper bag but I didn't come to Monteal for salad and granola... We still wanted to try the true ""petite dejeuner"" and hit up Olive et Gourmando the day after. We had the egg salad hot panini which was a damned revelation. The cafe au lait was great too. Reading the paper in the sunlight that teased its way to our table and dining on a complex panini of eggs, sriracha, oven roasted tomatoes and cheese was one of the fondest memories of our trip."

Definitely worth checking out!"

Ingredients that you wouldn't normally think mix well are like symphonies of flavour in your mouth.
