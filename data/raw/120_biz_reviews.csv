They don't have too much in terms of selection for their menu but that's usually how you know they do a really good job with what they have. You can choose different noodle shapes and sizes and I was speaking with one of their servers that they size and shape of the noodle does affect the taste! Their tendon noodle soup was fantastic. The beef pieces were so tender and delicate. The soup itself can be made spicy and the broth is absolutely fantastic. The noodles are also fun to eat. Plus, they give you A LOT of noodles. Service: excellent. They're always going around and filling up your water and giving you extra napkins. They're very friendly and sweet! Space/ambience: it's a pretty tight spot so you'll probably have to share with others. It's a great way to meet friends and also scope out what noodle and soup combo people are having."

Place is small and crowded around lunch time. However, service is fast so you won't wait too long.A personal note: slightly too much MSG in the soup base, which is not uncommon."
/user_details?userid=kjzg7jTm6tWhETeJ3xDqZw,Andrew H.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Located on Sherbrooke street, right in front of McGill University is Nouilles Zhonghua.It's a small restaurant where you can either dine in or pick up your food.They specialize mostly in Asian inspired soup.You have about 6-8 different types of soups on the menu. You can also make them very spicy or not depending on your preferences.I always take out due to the restaurant being jam packed at lunch time.There are about 8 tables that seat 4 each. Just note that if you dine in you might be sitting with people you don't know but hey, maybe you can strike a conversation and make new friends!Overall this place is great but know that if you want to order at lunch time, not only will the place be packed but there will be a huge line up for pick up orders that extends all the way outside.I recommend you try this place at least once.Hopefully they expand in the future with all of the business they are getting."

We had the Zhonghua Special which included a noodle dish, a soup and a choice of salad. Both of us had the edamame bean salad.Everything was delicious and the service was fast.This restaurant lost one star because of the seating and tables - just too small and uncomfortable."
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Had lunch here today. Waited about 25 mins. Ordering take out should be really quick, about 5 mins all. We had the Lanzhou noodle which is  the same taste and presentation as the Chinatown noodle place. All the Lanzhou noodle should be very similar to be authentic because they have a strict professional standard. I think this place has more meat. The soup is similar but with more pepper scents. I like this one too. I will come back if I am in downtown area"

/user_details?userid=SAeScmq3cxbikwnjyTqjxQ,Ricky Boby L.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",3 star rating,"I ordered the tendon noodle soup. The broth was tasty and and noodles.were okay.the only thing i found that was missing was actually tendon, there were only lean pieces of meats.the one size also annoyed me,with tax and tip for 17 bux,nit really full afterwards.The chinatown one or the one inside eaton center is better."
/user_details?userid=ZQYQfc3fGNDTKaLT6UG60w,Javo M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Yes. Don't overthink it. Do it. If you have a craving for noodles, this is the spot in this area of downtown. The medium size is very generous, but if you're a glutton like me, add the extra beef, that will surely be enough. The broth is very tasty and beefy, sort of reminds me of ""carne en su jugo"" from back home (without he fixings of course). Small place, very busy at lunch time, and if you're 1 or 2 be prepared to share a table."
/user_details?userid=h5eVBQ5DyrpnQOaJ9ycl3g,Shiyue X.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Pros:- Fast service- Delicious food: more or less the same quality as Nouilles de Lanzhou in Chinatown, but smaller portions - Cheap prices: about 15$/person after tax and tip - Dinnertainment? : you see the kitchen make your food, which can be cool since even after countless hand-pulled noodle bowls, I'm still mesmerized by the process. Cons:- Cramped seating: you will have to share a table if you're less than 3 people - Small seating area: long wait times during peak hours - Busy busy busy: you kind of feel rushed since you can see the line of people standing by the door, waiting for your spot. Would I go back? Definitely Main issue? Space The best thing about it? Delicious food, cheap prices"
/user_details?userid=u_89MyNZ3wUz_6J4w1IQeQ,Roy N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Very good, traditional Chinese noodles. I've been to Beijing and Shanghai, and I can say that this restaurant tastes very authentic. They make their noodles on location and offer a variety of sizes. Their portions also shocked me, as they were fairly large. I did wish there was a larger proportion of meat to carbs but that's just my taste! lol"
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place replaces Pizza Navona. The space had been on sale for a while, and I kept wondering what business would set up there. Well, I'm pretty happy it's Zhonghua noodles!This noodle shop is very, very similar to ""Nouilles de Lan Zhou"", down to the color scheme of the interior and the items on the menu. I guess it could be from the same owner? The soup, noodles and toppings are virtually the same too. I won't complain though, this place is closer to my house haha! We went Friday evening and the restaurant was quite busy. It's rather small inside, with maybe ~20 seats. The kitchen is in the front by the door, so that passersby can observe the whack'n'stretch process of noodle making. There were two empty four-seat tables, but for some reason the waitress assigned us into a table with already one occupant, causing her to hurriedly stand up and drop her coat on the floor. We ordered two medium bowls of the signature beef noodles of ""kuan"" thickness (no extra toppings, no spices). The noodles arrived in a record time (less than 5 min). The soup and noodles were piping hot and delicious (although it got quite salty in the end)! I also felt that the noodle and beef portions were more generous than their Chinatown counterpart. The daikon was still skimpy (two thin slices). The total came to about 22$ before tips. A good deal!"
/user_details?userid=HpzMECWPO4H1fJihiMG1Pg,Lanyi L.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,Had the vegetarian noodles and they were good! Fresh noodles are always good. Great and quick service. Will be back to try the other ones!
/user_details?userid=I8nPtKPLXMupdtdnPjctsw,Ping Y.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Had the special Lanzhou beef noodles small format and it was enough to fill me up! The beef was very tender and the soup was spicy but not too much. The soup itself was a little too salty and pretty oily to my taste so I didn't end up drinking all of it but everything in it was very good (especially the noodles that are hand-pulled) and taste overall was well balanced. Service was fast despite the place being packed (although it's pretty small).I would definitely go back for a casual meal since it came to just under $10 after tax and tips. Debit or cash only but we got 10% off for coming after 3PM!
/user_details?userid=D-jIQQUo6bz-sdVezLa7Wg,Shan G.,"Irvine, CA",5 star rating,"such a nice lanzhou beed noodle, all the small dishes are good, recommend chinese pork Hamburg."
/user_details?userid=yV-vGtNVRtw5jK4GorEa0Q,Daisy Y.,"Dorval, Canada",4 star rating,"Pretty good noodle. You can choose the width of the noodle and the portion (yes!!!). I love that you get to choose the portion so I don't have to waste good. And 涼皮 is delicious! The service was ok. It's newly opened so I understand that servers might need some more time. However, the place is small. Not only you have to share table with others, I'm afraid that someone will eventually bump into customers who sat in front of the cash register. The first time when I was there, we sat in front of the cash register. It's a very narrow passage that can only fit one thin person. So my friend was extremely uncomfortable with people passing behind him all the time. Try not to get that seat.."
/user_details?userid=W-1EszyEOgGmi5sWKc3-aA,JS L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Very good pho or Japanese ramen alternative in downtown IMO.Handmade noodles (pretty good) and the broth was legit (beef soup special). My bowl came out within 5 mins, very fast service, decent portion and good price.Like the other yelpers mentioned, the place is small and tight so be prepared to sit next to strangers (try not to bring bags or anything)"
/user_details?userid=hBADi4exXG7eTd90WKwQjw,Eric L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Not as good as the one in China Town (Nouilles de Lan Zhou), but still very solid. They have pretty big portions, a medium is very filling ($9.99+tax+tip). The quality of the food is quite good, but not amazing. They recently made some improvements, by adding a second door so that it wasn't cold AF when people filtered in and out. It gets very crowded during lunch and dinner, so you'll likely be sitting with other people if required. The service is great! Everyone is super friendly. It's a great location too, especially if you're a McGill student."
/user_details?userid=QdRP7wn2GZsFgFfhJJmUWA,Yuzhou G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Very satisfied except that the place is just too small for most time of the day, plus you have no space to place bag or coat.Good taste and service!"
/user_details?userid=C2YxxeHBKtJ5Eokpi2urcQ,Anna N.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"As soon as I walked in I knew this was going to be a great meal, I felt instantly back in China. The vegetarian broth was amazing, especially considering how many Chinese restaurants struggle with those. They also had xi'an cold noodles which i've been looking for in Montreal for years, and hot and sour potato salad. Edit: people keep comparing the taste to Nouilles de Lan Zhou. It's definitely similar since they're both hand pulled noodles, and i can't speak for the meat broths, but the vegetarian broth was definitely a lot richer here!Place was super small but the food came so quick"
/user_details?userid=dhTBU8puLCRnm0QrOaimJg,Mandy X.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Honestly so happy there is finally an authentic Chinese food place near McGill. Not as spicy/flavourful as its Chinatown counterpart but the best in the 2 km radius around where it is located. Price was very fair and portions were big. The small sized option was more than enough for me.
/user_details?userid=zlX8PIFFGkHy32exUowr2A,Mariah C.,"Richmond, Canada",5 star rating,Great restaurant for hand pulled noodles. Perfect place for students as it is right next to campus. The meal was affordable and the service was quick.
/user_details?userid=u3hDmhOlkzC5qD8fqbtOzg,Daoud P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Right next to McGill and amazing noodles. You simply can't go wrong!! The staff is very friendly and accommodating as well. Definitely highly recommend.
/user_details?userid=NuZwsU5_-6FCNEmodJvbzQ,Fang W.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"We happened to pass by this restaurant, and felt it was highly probably authentic, then we went in and lined up. As we imagined, it was very authentic and even better than some LanZhou noodles in China. We had a happy noodle meal together. The only shortcoming  is that the place was too small and guests were too many. But it deserves the waiting time if you are not in a hurry."

But in this place, I asked for non spicy version of their plates and I had one of the most delicious Chinese food."
