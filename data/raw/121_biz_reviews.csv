/user_details?userid=I7Fmd8WQA0FozWOEZQNdkw,Lana S.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,I have had a couple people recommend this place for when we are in Montreal so I made a reservation ahead of time (seating for the bar area which is fine!). We were a few mins late but the host was able to sit us at the bar ahead of time. Our waiter was very welcoming and explained how the menu worked since it was both our first times there (chefs menu vs. a la cart items). He even offered to make us a specialized cocktail based on our taste. For food items we decided to Get the octopus appetizer and both of us wanted the halibut for dinner. Our drinks came out first and mine was delicious! My friend actually ended up like my drink more than hers so she traded her drink in haha. The octopus came out first and omg it was delicious. The octopus was tender and seasoned well. The garnish paired well with the octopus and we basically scraped the dish clean. Next our halibut came out and had this anchovy cream over it. I was afraid the anchovy taste would be overpowering but it was actually super delicious! Halibut cooked perfectly and the potato cake under the fish was also absolutely delicious. Overall with our great service and food/drink this was our best meal in Montreal :)
/user_details?userid=1uWt3rL2GJiptcflQa35Jg,Jessica W.,"Hoboken, NJ",5 star rating,"I had the best dinner here during my last trip to Montreal. They offer a tasting menu or you can order a la carte, and they do take Amex unlike most other restaurants in Montreal .We had oysters to start, they were all east coast, salty but super fresh and lots of flavor. We then had the tuna carpaccio, which was delicious, and we split the hanger steak. The sauce on the hanger steak was super peppery but I liked it a lot. They had really great glasses of wine, and the meal overall for the amount of food was super reasonable. I will definitely be coming back next time I come!"

/user_details?userid=lDtXjw6HWOxQT0owoM_1eA,Donna S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"My first visit to a Chuck Hughes restaurant and it was great!! The service was absolutely awesome. The guys at the bar made me feel more than at home. Thank you again!!The shrimp hush puppies were super delicious with a honey sauce. my next favourite dish was the mushrooms with gorgonzola cheese, great flavors.I also had the scallops with gnocchi which I thought was tasty but overly salty. The scallops were cooked to perfection. Just don't expect too much in terms of the amount of gnocchi,  they were sparse on the plate. To finish it off, I had the brownie with white chocolate mousse, a very sweet and decadent dessert, even for me and I'm a chocolate lover.And team Chef Chuck Hughes or Chef Bobby Flay, you ask? (Iron chef circa 2011- YouTube it)I say Chef Hughes!!"
/user_details?userid=tE4KJ-U9IjNCIg77afTQLw,Arun P.,"Dallas, TX",3 star rating,"Sometimes the hype around a restaurant kills the actual experience of being there.  This is probably true of Garde Manger.  Food was fine but the experience did not meet the raving reviews that I had heard.We made a reservation in advance but ended up in a corner booth which was not comfortable.  The idea of not having a menu bothered some of the folks in the group but I was cool with the idea of reading off the black board.Service : Our waitress was phenomenal!  She was efficient, funny and kept the conversation going as we placed our orders.  Definitely a highlight!Food : We tried a lot of appetizers - portions were small which led us to order more.  For an entree, I tried the pork tenderloin with jalapeno grits which was the only dish i really liked.  The rest of our group tried their different offerings - seafood, steak.  Food tasted good but the overall experience did not live up to the expectations.Ambience : For a fine dining restaurant, our table for 5 was too cramped and we did not enjoy it.  The restaurant is highly sought after and is crowded at all times.  Its not easy to find the restaurant since they do not have a sign upfront.  Its an unassuming door and just follow your GPS.Pricing : Expensive.  Don't mind paying the price as long as there is value in the experience.Will I return? : Maybe, to entertain."
/user_details?userid=jJDUCuPwVqwjbth3s92whA,Jennifer T.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I love family style menus and this restaurant does this perfectly. Their seafood platter is really more like a seafood TITANIC that spans three feet and is filled with incredible delights such as oysters, smoked fish, mussels, razor clams and caviar, and lobster. This course alone gave the restaurant 5 stars in my mind.We had so many dishes, all of which were great, but some stand out in my memory:- Boston bib salad with blue cheese- Salsify (this is a root vegetable, which I had never tried before but am now a convert)- Beef tartare- Scallops and gnocchiI would pass on the hush puppies (which reminded me of falafel) and the liver mousse on bread. Desserts were excellent. This restaurant has a very ""Montreal feel"" to it - a warm and cozy escape from the cold outside, bustling with friends enjoying good wine and food. Highly recommended."
/user_details?userid=N2LOlsIOLCh6p2ikQMecWQ,Nikki M.,"Winston-Salem, NC",5 star rating,"I am completely obsessed with Chuck Hughes. Whenever he's on tv, I watch him. I've got a Google alert set up to read anything anyone has ever written about him. I've watched every episode of Chuck's Day Off, Week Off, Eats The Streets--religiously, hoping for the day that I'd be able to visit Garde Manger and possibly taste the famed lobster poutine.According to the internets, you have to have a reservation newly a month in advance. I was traveling in Montreal sooo, so I took a chance and arrived at the restaurant right before 5 p.m., hoping to snag a table just for myself. The restaurant has no signage or street number posted on the door. It's almost as if you have to ""be in the know"" to know exactly where it is. Due to construction on the street to prepare for the 375th anniversary of the city, it was even that much more difficult to navigate past open holes in the street and narrow passageways to get there. Lucky me: there was ONE seat at the bar (where I prefer to eat anyhow) and the bartender took good care of me. I went in for poutine and stayed for the lovely, bustling atmosphere. There is one menu but it's written in chalk on two boards, in French and in English. I read Yelp reviews that said to stay away from the poutine because it wasn't worth the hype, but I didn't listen and I'm glad I didn't. It was one of the best dishes I've ever had at a restaurant. Being a Southern lady, I am well-versed in the language of gravy and the gravy is what made the poutine spectacular. There was PLENTY of fat, succulent pieces of lobster and the curds were melted just slightly under and on top of the piping hot pommes frites. I had a glass of wine and happily wobbled my way back to my AirBnB.For anyone contemplating going to Garde Manger, do make reservations and do get the poutine. It says market price on the menu and don't let that scare you away. It ended up being ~$15 CAD."

For the main I went with the duck with the seabuckthorn which was very bitter but still delicious, I would've licked my plate clean! The service was mediocre as the server seemed very irritated with the dinner guests. We could've leave without dessert, and we got the bread pudding with the pumpkin cheesecake (huge yum)!!!!"
/user_details?userid=-f3XN9UF7OmjICSDXUaA5Q,Joanna K.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"Simply fantastic!  We did the chefs tasting menu and each dish was better than the previous!  The seafood platter was a beautiful variety of oysters, mussels salad, shrimp, lobster (pic attached). We had a great tomato salad which was made from tomatoes from their garden. The scallops were perfectly seared and omgggg dessert!  The blueberry cheesecake, yummmm!"

/user_details?userid=DG8KlNP7ArYesQb2AGUHng,Jen L.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"Food 5 stars. Ambiance 3. Amazing multi course tasting menu for 4. It was ideal for us since we were unable to collaborate on which of dishes we wanted because all of it looked great. Menu is on a chalk board... not idea in a dark restaurant. We started with a beautiful seafood tower. All dishes were served family style but perfectly made for 4 (so there was no fighting over our servings). Arctic char, scallops, halibut and rib eye were my faves. Dessert was also delicious. All of it was amazing. The old negatives: it's very dark. For such beautiful food, it's not idea for the visual part of the meal. Our waiter was over zealous and interrupted convos often. And my biggest complaint is that it's WAY loud from the music, to the point that you are telling the whole time. My throat was sore the next day. Not good for conversation with the other guests. If the meal wasn't so perfect, I would absolutely drop stars."

We were seated at the back bar as the place was obviously busy; all tables were full as was the bar in the front of the restaurant. I've eaten at this restaurant and can say that the dishes are great; the market fresh menu displayed on a chalkboard is simple, creative, and just plain tasty! Tonight though, we wanted cocktails and Garde Manger delivered! The service was friendly, the ambiance was buzzing, and the space itself is cozy and relaxed for a fine dining restaurant. The cocktail mixes were good and one as interesting as the next; I could have easily kept going but stopped at two I would definitely return for the food again, especially their seafood plates as the menu is ever changing; our bar mates servings sitting next to us definitely opened my appetite!"

/user_details?userid=XYDyktd9zsqPvJxxSTDxNw,Jamie E.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",3 star rating,"Party of 2, Wednesday night, 930pm. Very very pricey. Luckily the food is pretty good, so that helps you get over it pretty quickly.Very dark and loud space.  We sat at the back bar and that was with a reservation.  WARNING: they are quick to sell you on a seafood platter, but much slower to tell you the cost of that platter - they charge you for EACH item they serve you, so it gets expensive very quickly.  Make sure you ask how much it's going to cost you.  Otherwise, our seafood platter was delicious - oysters, lobster, ceviche, sturgeon, shrimp, mussels.  Very fresh and came with a ton of condiments.  Beef carpaccio had waaaaayy too much olive oil on it.  Soaking wet.  But the beef was fresh and tasty. The homemade pasta was amazing. Melt in your mouth I would order two the next time I went back kind of amazing.Our last dish was a fish dish that was very blasé.  Lots of ingredients piled on top and made the overall taste mediocre.  Service was fantastic though, they are good sales people."
/user_details?userid=eYp08DJGZflc5by6jT4saA,Stephanie M.,"Mississauga, Canada",4 star rating,Fantastic Dinner! I booked a seat a month in advance (Saturday of a long weekend it was needed!) Very worth it! The food was great and the staff was amazing and helpful with explanations! My only con... the discontinued lobster poutine was a let down! I was really looking forward to that but no dice! Actually looking up menus ahead of time is a downfall as it does change! Which is good to keep food fresh and new but also disappointing when you're like me and like to decide on what to have ahead of time!
/user_details?userid=mEG8CbrUSRmcZrSZGQI4VA,Wael D.,"Richmond, VA",5 star rating,Love this place so much. One of my favorite restaurants on earth. Every time I visit my friend in Montreal I make it a mission to come and eat here. My favorite thing on their menu is the razor clams but anything that they serve out of that kitchen is going to taste like pure bliss. The restaurant is very pricey but you definitely get what you pay for over here. The inside of the restaurant is really nice and has a very lively atmosphere during the dinner rush. Also the servers here are just as incredible as the food.
/user_details?userid=7Js0jyjTN1NSnAC3HTnZXw,Shawn B.,"Geneva, NY",5 star rating,"When I came to this city, I had an expectation of what the perfect dinning experience in Montreal should be. A quaint restaurant situated in Old Montreal. An inviting atmosphere, with a warm fireplace to take the chill out of the air. Excellent food with plenty of variety paired with the impeccable service of experienced professionals. I can honestly say, that Garde Manger exceeded all of those expectations. The interior is picturesque, the service exquisite, and their food is nothing short of incredible. This place has the best oysters I have ever had in my life. They are a must have, if you are going to dine here. Having food of this caliber, so early in my life was a real privilege. Yet I'm tortured knowing I might not have a dining experience this great again. 10/10 would go back"

The host was also very friendly and helpful in finding us a table despite not having a reservation (which I advise making, if possible). The food was also incredible. We started with the octopus and Brussels sprouts appetizers, which were delicious. For entrees, the steak and halibut were both great. That was plenty of food for two hungry diners!Definitely check this place out when in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=fExL6u06xTSg13k945IPAQ,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",3 star rating,ohh this was such a polarizing experience... here we go...we sat at the bar which I always like bc you get to see the bartenders in action. The bartender was very helpful with telling us about the menu. You dont get paper menus here just have to look at the wall and pick what you like.I started off with an old fashioned which was solid. The wine was also good. No complaints here.We ordered a few appetizers as well. We had some of the sturgeon tartare and some other raw preparation that the bartender suggested. Both delicious. We shared the pork as an entree. It was tender but a tad salty for my taste. The jalapeno grits were a good compliment and overall it was a balanced dish.For dessert we had this little donut type things with peanut butter/chocolate. I forget the name but they only had 2 options so we gave it a go. Wasnt the best dessert I have had but pretty good.This is where the review gets tricky. We had great service for about half the meal but all of a sudden the bartender did a 180. He literally went missing and then dropped the check before we were done eating. The bartenders mood changed for no reason... We werent milking our drinks or anything but it felt like we were being forced out. Very weird. It put a bad taste in my mouth about the whole experience. Food was great albeit a little salty. Dont force people out who have come a long way to visit and this place will be fine. Until then it is a 3 star place.
/user_details?userid=bAG7y3qbpTv3hzIpx4Wf2g,Kashif K.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Poutine and lobster were a match made in Heaven, and the angel in charge of solemnizing the match was named Chuck Hughes. Now, these are facts that the clergy and the texts will not tell you, so you just need to eat the lobster poutine at Garde Manger to be blessed with such divine revelation. I showed up without a reservation at 7:30 PM on a Friday night (what was I thinking?), and was told that it would be 10 PM before I could get seated (at the bar!). I actually ended up getting seated 10 minutes before 10 PM (score!). No, I did not wait around at the restaurant for upwards of two hours; I just provided my name and phone number, and went out for a walk around the lovely city of Montreal on the beautiful summer evening. The daily menu is scribed onto a couple of chalk boards (one in French and the other in English), and the only two items that are constant are the lobster poutine and the jerk spiced crab. Everything else changes regularly. Some nights, they have more exciting items, such as Cornish hen stuffed with foie gras, or a foie gras and short rib waffle; other nights, it's more familiar items, such as Arctic char and walleye. The lobster poutine, in my view, lives up to the hype. The mildly fishy succulence of the lobster claw meat pairs very nicely with the cheese curds, fries and gravy. I noticed that one of the reviewers here thought there was barely any lobster in the poutine. I have to suspect that his dining companion must have stolen all of the lobster when he was not looking, because there really is a very generous amount of lobster on every serving of the poutine that I have seen here. The desserts also change regularly, and my favorite is the peanut butter and nutella profiterole, which is a rich confluence of sweet and salty flavors and smooth and crunchy textures. Service is absolutely outstanding. Everybody is extremely friendly. My server, Awesome Alexander, recognized me from a prior visit to the restaurant (I can't imagine how, given the sheer multitude of people dining here every night), and brought me a sweet gift of complimentary dessert (or, to continue with the theme of divinity, heavenly manna)!"
/user_details?userid=wW72FaqNPv6pdBC6AUqvcA,Hilary K.,"Vaudreuil-Dorion, Canada",4 star rating,"This is the second time I come here, I honestly have to say that my experience got better the second time around! Service is exceptional! I came here with my love and we love our oysters. We got a dozen oysters. They easily slide out of the shell and directly in my mouth. Yummmm yummm just remembering it gives me the goosebumps .. I wished I had some right now!! Lol. I had a beautiful meal last time except for the octopus .. I have to say it was not their best meal! The cook was overcooked and it turned out super chewy. It was even very cold. Kind of surprised that it was overcooked at a top executive restaurant owned by the famous Chuck Hughes!! Hmmm bummer. Ok on the pro side Their Mushroom risotto was succulent warm and freshly prepared. I had to order a second order of that amazing risotto! Another thing I don't like is how their menu is written on their board. It's so small I can barely see what they have and theres absolutely no bright lights in the resto. It's kindove a drag having to figure out what the hell is on their menu. I admit its hard to get a hard copy of their menu because they change it daily but maybe they should change their board to a light board with markers instead of the dreadful chalk board. Service was splendid! We always get amazing service over here. I think the manager knows us very well and he always makes sure to get us the best available table and makes sure to get us the drinks we ask for. Overall, it's a very fancy gem in montreal and these minor détails could be totally corrected if they pay attention to these comments hopefully! :pI do recommend this place for their amazing service."

Afterwards I experienced some of THE BEST customer service I have experienced anywhere. I NEVER had to ask for water every single server refilled my water the second they walked by and noticed it was empty. The bartender and sever who waited on me were incredibly friendly and helpful to guide me through their menu. I had a delicious dinner that was worth every penny and on top of that a bartender gave me a suggestion for a great local bar in the area. I had such s great time at Garde Manger!

We had to wait a few house so went walking and had an appetizer nearby, and our table was ready when we returned. The food was unbelievable, as was the service! I wish I had gotten more pictures to remember what we go, but we were too focused on eating at the time!

/user_details?userid=Te3LAqNmPA-1cWlLFsTi9A,Darcy M.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,There was no reservation available for the night I was in town and coincidentally stumbled in to this place for a drink one night because I thought it looked inviting. The host told me that he would make two seats available for us at the bar if we came the next night. So accommodating! We did the tasting menu and I have to say I'm not a seafood fan and I found the seafood platter to be the BEST thing I've ever eaten. Definitely stepped out of my comfort zone and it paid off. Everything was so fresh and 6 months later I am still dreaming about the razor clams and the smoky seafood salad.  The staff was so friendly and even let us request our entrees for the tasting menu which typically is the chef's choice. Had great conversation with another couple at the bar that comes to this restaurant every time they are in town.

But we live in Toronto, so when we were in Montreal recently I made it a priority to make it here and book a reservation way in advance. If you want a two person table this is definitely needed as they only have a few two person tables. If you don't land one of those then you'll find yourself at the bar which is I'm sure fine. Food is food. Drinks are drinks.The chalkboard menu is ever changing and makes you know you are only eating seasonal stuff. We ordered a couple apps. My wife had the asparagus which was in season and quite delicious. I had the shrimp salad which was good, as it had good flavour, but maybe not as interesting as some other things and I regretted my choice. My main was the artic char and chorizo which I thought was a slam dunk flavour wise, though a bit tiny for a main. Though very pretty. My wife had the spaetzle which she enjoyed. Who doesn't love spaetzle?We had sponge cake with ice cream for dessert that looks and sounds simple but it was out of this world. Maybe my favourite part of the dinner. Simple things done exceptionally well always rule supreme. It was a delicous dinner but I feel like there is better value out there."
/user_details?userid=2pVj1Hid6_Iq3Th9xI0aOQ,Roland H.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I have been to Garde Manger several times and it does not disappoint. It is located in Old Montreal. The restaurant does not have a sign so you will need to know where you are going. The restaurant is dimly lit and intimate. The exposed brick walls adds character to the place - gives the restaurant a trendy vibe.   The food is delicious and is worthy of the hype. There are a few standouts. I would recommend starting a caesar (which comes with) and some oysters.  The oysters were expertly shucked, meaty and fresh.For the mains, we enjoyed the signature lobster poutine, the pasta and duck. The lobster poutine consists of french fries, lobster meat, cheese curds, and lobster bisque reduced until it takes on a gravy-like consistency. The lobster poutine is a must. There is a reason why it is a signature dish. I would recommend getting a the small size as it is really filling. The pasta with rabbit meat was delicious. The duck was flavourful and cooked medium rare. Garde Manger and Chef Chuck Hughes are Montreal institutions. I highly recommend Garde Manger."
/user_details?userid=iqCk5V9tOzvS784jMfJ5ww,Frank T.,"Medford, MA",3 star rating,"Where do I begin? This is my fourth timing eating at this establishment over the past several years. Not sure when they decided to try and up-sell every customer through the door, but they are very quick to try and push you toward the chef's tasting menu...which starts at $110/pp. They call that the ""minimum"", but for an ""other worldly"" experience we can get ""very creative"" for $140/pp.Don't get me wrong the food is good, but prices have skyrocketed while portions are relatively small. That, coupled with the pushy nature of the servers is a complete turn off!The wine list, while fairly extensive is grossly overpriced! Our server, Simone, while very knowledgeable, was very abrupt and almost seemed perturbed that we wanted control over our menu!If your looking for a place with decent food, a bloated wine menu, and a huge bill, this is your place.

That's where the positive review ends: they discontinued the famed lobster poutine, the bartender had a tense and pretentious manner, she made very mediocre cocktails, and strangely insisted that the tuna tartare they served me (I ordered ceviche) was in fact ceviche (the server even called it tuna tartare when she brought it over --see photo). Annoyingly, they also had no physical menu, just a chalk board. Weird and unpleasant experience. So many great places to eat in Montreal at this price point and lower. Save yourself the trip."

We passed by on the first night and couldn't figure out what it was..bar, restaurant?  Thankfully I did a little sleuthing to figure out that the pink light up sign was the entrance to deliciousness. We had to eat LATE (I mean like 10:30pm) because we didn't plan ahead but it was well worth it. The atmosphere is dark and cozy and it was perfect for the cool weather outside. We were seated all the way at the back of the restaurant - which was great because we could check out what everyone was eating on the way. The menu isn't huge but it is well selected and with a variety of items for everyone. I had fish and I have to say that it was the most well prepared fish I have ever eaten. Fully cooked (as requested vs seared) and still so tender and not dry at all! The server was very friendly - and helpful since I had a lot of menu questions. Definitely worth a visit and even a 2 hour wait for dinner. I will plan ahead next time to eat earlier but will definitely return!"

/user_details?userid=s19c8t_yAmFrby90LjDk8g,Jason G.,"Alexandria, VA",5 star rating,"My partner and I went to Garde Manger for dinner while we were visiting Montreal, and overall, we really enjoyed the food and service here.We had heard about this restaurant through various food blogs, and understood that the chef is on TV. We were able to get a Saturday night reservation at the bar about five days beforehand. The restaurant itself is very small and you can see everyone from the bar. There was a very inviting and intimate feel to the place. The menu was very eclectic, with different spins on normal dishes. We opted for some Canadian oysters, which were delicious. However, one of them was just bad - happens to anyone and it's not a bad reflection on the kitchen - but then they brought us out more oysters and genuinely seemed to care whether our food was to our liking or not. I think that kind of attention to detail is what sets this restaurant apart from a lot of other ones.We also opted for two appetizers, which were delicious, and for our entrée, we decided to split the most luxe option that they had - a Cornish hen stuffed with foie gras. It sounds decadent, and it was. There were lots of complex flavors with that dish, and I definitely liked the dish.Overall, we really enjoyed our meal at Garde Manger. It was probably our favorite meal in Montreal, and that's saying something because there are a lot of great food options here."

Food was tasty but small portions, relatively expensive and painfully slow to the table. Stupid chalkboard menu and ineffective waiter descriptions/communication. Received Garde Manger recommendation from fellow diner at Michael Smith's Inn at Bay Fortune on PEI. We had high expectations for our one night in Montreal but left deflated. Garde Manger needs some hospitality training from Danny Meyer."

I will say I did visit on March 16 and the waitress we had was not the best (although the food was amazing). My whole party knew what we wanted to order, however she insisted we just start with a drink order- fine.I wanted the steak, however I dislike mushrooms so asked if I could have it with out mushrooms and substitute it for fries. She said she'd ask the chef, she eventually returned and said it was fine, however neglected to inform me she would be charging me for them. I don't see why she would have to check with the chef if she intended to charge me. Also, about 20 minutes into waiting for our food (she did tell us it would be 40 minutes which was fine) we had to request the bread and butter. Normally every other time I have been here (has to be at least 6 times) the waiter always brings it out.Regardless of the poorer service then normal, the food was outstanding and I will continue to come back. My bill after tip was around $100.00 just for me."

I had watched a YouTube video prior to my trip, on the food network where they featured garde manger. The meat looked unbelievable and i knew my husband and I had to check it out.On opentable, it does not allow you to make a reservation more than 30 days in advance for this restaurant. I booked exactly a month in advance and still only received 2 bar seats. It ended up being a wonderful evening. Located in Old Montreal, this restaurant is not labelled so look for the numbers on the side of the building.I loved the ambience of the restaurant. My husband ordered the pork chop, which was out of this world! Prior to this, another guy was there with his wife and was raving about the pork chop, saying this was the best pork chop of his life. My husband and i would have to agree!!! I ordered the duck confit which was also amazing! Super succulent. I do have to say all the food is very rich and filling so we were definitely slowed after that meal. We also started with the shrimp hush puppies, which were phenomenal and we highly recommend them.I would love to come back here again the next time I'm in Montreal!"

/user_details?userid=WaQ9dlcjUdOSBUiLX5CLwA,Carly R.,"Windsor, Canada",5 star rating,"Overall a great experience. We originally had a reservations late in the evening. At the last minute we ended up getting tickets for the Nasty Show and called to see if we could change our reservation. David was very understanding and accommodating. Without hesitation he promptly made the change. On our way to dinner we got stuck in traffic. Wow! Construction and driving in Montreal is an experience in and of itself. We again called to let them know we were going to be late (and to see if we could still make the reservation) and explained the situation. Again, they were very understanding and told us not to worry and that our table would be waiting when we arrived.  We arrived for dinner and were promptly seated. Everyone from the host to wait and bar staff were very polite and friendly. Alessandro was our bartender & server. He was attentive and explained everything very clearly and gave suggestions based on our tastes. I started we the lemon meringue cocktail. Yum! How can you go wrong with Tito's and limoncello!?! We started with the ricotta lobster stuffed zucchini flowers. Delish. They were served with a pickled salad of zucchini and shallots with mint and basil. I had the halibut risotto for dinner which was also very good. My spouse had the hanger steak with pomme frites. The steak was divine and the fries were super crispy. We ate at Joe Beef the evening before and my spouse enjoyed his steak at Garde Manger more than his aged beef he had time night before (it was also very good.) There was even a little hiccup/mishap with our appetizer and the wait staff was very apologetic and it was promptly taken from the table with our plates and cutlery. It was replaced a few minutes later, again with an apology. Our water glasses were never left empty and the service was great. The music was very chill and enjoyable, we were even singing along with Alessandro. I would highly recommend to anyone!"

I wanted something French-inspired while in Montreal, but desperately wanted to avoid stuffy, white table cloth French restaurants common to many American cities. Garde Manger felt younger but timeless, and I really appreciated the general vibe, probably helped by a great bar and cool chalk-board menu. Fries are a must-order! Overall, easy and good quality food."
/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"We went to Garde Manger for double birthday celebration and all the seven of us were quite happy with the experience. The ambiance of the restaurant was warm and welcoming. The service was good and our needs were attended timely. We sat in the inner hall at a cosy big table under the menu. The same menu is written on the black board and it has only the appetizers and main courses, drinks and desserts are announced by your host and I really prefer to read the ingredients of what I'm consuming.The lobster poutine is amazing and believe me there is enough lobster in it. I had tomato salad for appetizer, which was not less amazing as the tomatoes were sweet like they have grown under the southern sun or may be the chef had some secret seasoning for them. My main course was the most expensive dish in the house, lobster risotto, but wow, it was freakin good. As my friend wisely explained, when you pay for risotto you don't pay for ingredients, but for work and experience. I managed to dig in the duck with  mousse of foie gras dish and it was pretty good too. The sweet potato creme brûlée was interesting dessert to share, but next time we would rather try something else. All drinks we had were solid. The girls fell in love with the Bloody Caesars, they still talk about them more then a month later. I was a little bit disappointed as the Caesars didn't come with the famous snow crab leg in them, just a massive fresh celery and some beef jerky instead. Now I need to come back for more Bloody drinks with the famous legs, this time I really would like to sit at the raw bar and try some fresh seafood. Conclusion this is one more place rated solid five stars on my personal scale of six. I find it overall expensive, but absolutely worth trying!"
/user_details?userid=_ni6nDBJQCkYhU619PEucQ,Tom F.,"Phoenix, AZ",3 star rating,"My wife and visited Garde Manger June 29th. I must say the the food was excellent. As for the portions I cannot really evaluate them as we were served many different dishes. Each had interesting mixes and flavors. It was well prepared and presented. My wife and I are not major foodies and did not go here for the reputation but rather the type of food. We are also not overindulgent eaters. So why the 3 stars? Our food server told us about several meals/specials stating they would typically be plus or minus $40 let's say. Then he flowed into describing a combo meal with a little taste of everything for $110. All of the foods sounded good so we said sure we will do that. Then while we were waiting I told my wife ""I will bet you it is $110 per person"". She asked and it was. We went ahead and got the meal and it was excellent. Worth $110 a person?  Maybe. Does a single person need that much food? NO! I heard the same presentation given to 3 other couples and it was the same. 2 others got what we ordered and I don't know if they were surprised like us or not. Way to deceptive for my blood. I have been in sales for years and it was a pretty slick transition from $40p/p to $110 with no mention that was p/p. Enjoy the excellent food but get everything clarified!"

It took us a while to find this restaurant because they pretentiously didn't have the name of their restaurant visible.I ordered the drink of the day and my boyfriend had a beer. The drink of the day was delicious and I was happy that they weren't stingy with the alcohol.We ordered three appetizers to share: the famous lobster poutine ($19), grilled octopus ($19) and fried cod and clam ($16). My boyfriend complained that there were very little lobster in the lobster poutine and I couldn't agree more. I think I took the only piece of lobster and he was left with the bits and pieces. The fries were decent but I think I like Deville Dinerbar's fries more (especially for that price point). The grilled octopus was also done well and wasn't tough at all. However, it was nothing special to my palette. The fried cod and clams was the the worst dish because all I tasted was batter.The downfall of the night was when the host rudely confronted us because of a reservation confusion. We called earlier in the night to inform them that we would like our reservation pushed back and they nicely did it for us. Unfortunately, the person taking our call made two reservations under our name. That's why the host confronted us about the second reservation. I didn't see why he had to be so rude toward us when it wasn't our fault and the restaurant wasn't even busy (it was 6pm).Overall, we had a mediocre experience and I expected more from this restaurant."
/user_details?userid=aUZLaEKVepvMMOuQEtB70g,Kelsey S.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Our dining experience at Garde Manger was absolutely exceptional. Everything from the ambience, the service (one of the best parts!) and, of course, the food made our night a 5/5.To begin, the restaurant is found in old Montreal, nestled amongst various other places to eat and grab a drink. Although there is no sign that explicitly says ""Garde Manger"", it wasn't hard to find. As we entered the restaurant, we were met with the sounds of people talking and laughing and delicious smells emitting from the open kitchen. The room was dimly light, creating an intimate atmosphere. And although there wasn't much music playing when we first arrived, towards the end of the night, the restaurant turned up the music and played everything from Queen to Salt n Pepa! (We were pleasantly surprised and very impressed). We were seated at the bar and we were helped by a bartender named Loris. Loris was attentive and fun, he kept making sure were ok throughout the meal, chatting with us and even recommending places to check out afterward. He made our experience very enjoyable and we couldn't have been more happy with his service and expertise.Loris helped take us through the menu and we decided to go with the Chef's tasting menu as per his recommendation. After asking us if there were any allergies or food restrictions, he informed us that the tasting menu included 4 courses: a seafood platter, a second and third course (each of these courses had three plates, served tapas style) and finally dessert. After we finalized what we wanted to eat, Loris recommended that we tried the Negroni (his favourite) and then we ventured off to try the Caesar and a Montreal cocktail that I can't remember the name of. The drinks were smooth but strong and we were very happy about that. We began our meal with the seafood platter and believe me when I say this was some of the best seafood we've ever eaten. My boyfriend, who doesn't even like fish, enjoyed everything that we were given. The platter includes crab, oysters, cocktail shrimp, and a selection of a pâté, ceviche, smoked herring and pickled muscles. It was the best way to kick off our dinner and definitely our favourite course. Next we had our second course which was a chicken liver pâté on a crostini, cornbread hush puppies with shrimp and a beet salad. Everything here was so fresh and savoury, and we couldn't imagine how it could get any better. The third course included duck breast (melted in your mouth and was topped with a zesty reduction), poached halibut which was so creamy I couldn't believe we were eating fish and finally a gnocchi with Quebec cheese and a garlicky, crunchy topping to add texture. Everything was just as delicious as the previous course and we were barely able to finish everything! Finally, we finished everything off with a chocolate and peanut butter tart, homemade chocolate cookies (which were to die for) and puffs with mint ice cream covered with a fudge. To finish this very lengthy review, I highly recommend checking out Garde Manger and trying the chef's menu. You will not be disappointed!"

We were in town for NYE. My sister found GM and secured reservations, and I'm so glad she did! The reason for my five star review is because this spot hit all points of a great dining experience - awesome food, customer service, and atmosphere. Like I said, there were three of us having dinner and we opted for the dinner special that included four courses at at a flat rate of $80 per person. The first course started off with a cold seafood plate that included fresh raw oysters, smoked mussels, scallop, and salmon. A basket of fresh bread and butter flavored with spicy honey came to the table and was the perfect accompaniment to the fresh seafood. Second and third courses were three appetizers (small plates) and then three different dinner dishes. All were chef choice and they were awesome! My favorites included roasted beets over creamy ricotta, tuna tartar, and a creamy risotto topped with crunchy breadcrumbs. And final course was dessert which was a fresh, out of the oven berry crumble pie and caramel puff cookies. As I mentioned, as good as the food was, the experience was also about things that didn't go in my mouth. The service was immaculate and the feel of the space was really warm and inviting, especially crucial given that we arrived in the middle of a major cold spell (minus 15 degrees outside that night). The music playlist was great, and the night ended with a string of hip hop favorites that got us dancing in our seats. I am so glad we made it to Garde Manger! I can't say enough good things about this spot and encourage you to check out this quaint spot in Old Montreal!"

We arrived just before our reservation and were seated promptly. The service was excellent - food runners, bar tender, host. They have the restaurant run as an art. My husband and I shared 4 different dishes then ice cream for dessert. Endive salad with apples, pecans and blue cheese - light and tart. Smoked sturgeon cubes with creams fraise, chives  and caviar - wow wow wow. Salmon with Nordic shrimp, chorizo vinegrette and a cucumber, dill and red onion salad. The salmon was a pacific wild salmon, cooked perfectly. The heat of the chorizo complimented the tart acidity of the cucumber salad that complimented the richness of the salmon and shrimp. Taking a forkful of every element of the dish gave the perfectly balanced palate. Pork tenderloin with mushrooms, jus and a smoked cheese and jalapeño grit. This dish was all rich but it worked. The smoky spicy flavour of the grits with the perfectly cooked pork had my husband declaring that this was his favourite meal and favourite restaurant. We finished it up with a scoop of the blueberry vanilla ice cream - made in house and an excellent palate cleanser and end to the dinner."

So we picked what we wanted the most at this place which was seafood platter and the octopus. I love lobster but just not a poutine fan, so didn't want to waste good lobster on a pile of fries and gravy. And glad we didn't get it. Lady sat next to our table ordered that as her main and was not impressed with it either.  I see it used to have 1/2 portion n full portion options on the board from other yelpers photos but when we went, there's only the $28. Seafood platter!  4 kinds of oysters which were all fresh and delicious. My fav is the fresh scallops on shell and that's what'd drawn me to this place. They didn't have snow crab that night unfortunately. We also had the smoked salmon on beets salad place. It's yummy but I think $10 for that tiny plate is a bit much. The grilled octopus with potatoes and chorizo cream was delicious. The octopus was cooked perfectly, not rubbery. And potatoes and garnish were good. Although a tiny lack of seasoning. Those were the only things we had. Seafood platter and octopus. No drinks. And $82 later. Guess seafood platter is $$$$. Although good seafood and rare scallops on shell. Don't think it's worth the price on appetizers along.  Food is good and definitely on the pricey side. Wouldn't give 5 star rating because the value just isn't there. There are many much better restaurants in Montreal for way way better food and lesser price. But if you're just loaded with cash, I'm sure the food here will satisfy you regardless."

Their seafood platter is among the best I've ever had, the lobster, razor clams and oysters are phenomenal (if standard), but it's the various smoked fishes and other tasty bits really bring it to the next level.  Service is insanely good, informal and friendly but so very on the ball. We did the tasting menu with wine pairings and we never had an empty glass once, the food showed up at the same time for everyone, and despite the restaurant being packed our server never felt like he was rushing with us. Mains included an incredible pork shoulder on cheesy potatoes that sounds boring but made me make a sex face in front of my mother in law it was so good. Most of their food is like this - on paper nothing special but through ingredients and preparation elevated to superhuman levels. Not sure what's changed recently but it's a different restaurant than last time I was here a year ago. Only nitpick is that around 10 on the weekend the bar fills up with friends of the restaurant and things get pretty party. I'd be pissed if I spend $500 and had to deal with people doing shots, yelling at each other and standing around with their butts in my face (we were a table over from the action so had a buffer) - but that's part of the ambiance - they also play 80's hair metal and gangster rap, sometimes that's just the price you gotta pay..."

As a matter of fact I swore I saw Steven Spielberg there although my husband said I just needed my eyeglass prescription checked because there was no way he'd be eating dinner at like 6 PM wearing a pair of shorts. So needless to say I had high hopes for this place.We were able to weasel a last minute early bird reservation at the bar. It was actually perfect, a spot in the back, quiet and intimate but seated at the bar you feel like you're in the middle of the action. They initially forgot to bring us bread, eventually I asked and boy am I glad I did. There were 3 different kinds of fresh bread that were each equally delicious and filling.We fell prey to the tourist trap that is the lobster poutine. Sorry but honestly it's overrated. Fries lack another dimension of flavor, were soggy, the gravy watery and the lobster felt wasted on this dish. I'd skip it, they had many other delicious apps on the menu.My main course was the red snapped served with green beans, mushrooms and lobster. I don't quite know how to describe it. It was crunchy, flavorful, light and delicious.My husband got the short rib with aged cheddar grits and a parsley salad. The beef was heavenly, tender, and fell off the bone without a knife. The cheddar grits were the best I've ever had. His dish was the highlight of the meal.Ambiance is trendy but not pretentious. Romantic and intimate. Waiters are friendly. Sure it's a little pricey but isn't that worth it if there's a small chance you might run into Steven Spielberg."

This was a last minutes trip but we were trying to book about 2 weeks ago.  They were fully book but we went to try again since plan changed. Lastly we got to a last minutes cancallation at the bar for just an hour.  We ordered some seafood (oysters, scallops and razor clams) and a mushroom toast as appetizer.   Season selection as great and the best it the freshly graded horseradish was amazing.  The 2 hot sauce that they paired was a hiden gem.  Specially the one called the holy hot sauce; it was chunk's own sauce.   It was well balance with jalapeno and the acidity.  I bought one home and my parent said it goes with meat better than seafood. We got 2 main course: pork loin with mushroom and salmon with squash.  The loin is one of the best I have ever had.  Soft in the middle paired with buttery oyster mushroom.  The salmon is great but we find the it is a bit too sweet for us.  An advice is to order a bit more than your regular order.  Their portion is a bit small."

We had the birrata and coquettes as appetizers and the were divine especially the pistachio sauce.  Hanger steak with fabulous sauce also. Duck was amazing.  We had to try dessert which is not typical for us and were  not disappointed.  Must go in old montreal

The lobster poutine was original and they were definitely generous on the lobster serving but it wasn't the best poutine I've ever had.The octopus was somewhat dry, the lobster roll lacked seasoning and overall that wow factor you would expect at a place like this just wasn't there.Especially when considering the price, it just wasn't worth it.Probably won't be going back again."

Dark and cool. Now for the food. I had oysters from Nova Scotia that were crisp and so beyond fresh. I decided to treat myself to a raw scallop that was still on the shell. You can't get that anywhere! So impressive. Then the main event. The LOBSTER POUTINE. okay if you are going to get poutine, go hard and get lobster poutine. It's as good as it sounds. Huge portion with large chunks of lobstah with a buttery gravy sauce with melted cheese curds over fries. Need I say aything else?The service is 10/10.

/user_details?userid=MUO2meJxp6AlIQgsIQ4B6w,Lawrie B.,"Burlington, Canada",5 star rating,Our best meal in Montreal - ever. Without question a must try when in Montreal and strong recommendation to make reservations well in advance of your visit. Use Bookenda to make your reservation or of course you could call them. Have the lobster poutine as a shared appetizer and save your main meal for one of the entrees they have on the board that night. The stuffed hen is big enough for two people and although I only had a small sample I will order for next time. I had the short rib and was blown away by how good it was. Leave some room for the ice cream sandwiches.....and also ask to have a picture taken with the kitchen staff. Well worth the money spent.

We were in town for two short nights and we're lucky enough to meet someone who pulled strings for us to snag a spot at the bar for a late-ish Sunday reservation. The space is dark and moody. Gorgeous. We were actually able to sit at a table in the back dining room. We shared some razor clams and Arctic char from the raw bar. We had an amazing curry spaghetti squash appetizer (easily the highlight of the night), a lamb shank and a delightful sponge cake dessert. The misses were the lamb shank, which was served at a room temperature and the fact that I felt there should have been bread or something to accompany many of the plates and sauces. With a bottle of wine, our meal came to $185 CAD. I would return."

We went there because we watch Chuck's day off and we heard so much about his poutine that won Iron chef that we had to tick it off our food bucket list. First, we waited 45 mins before they take our orders. Waitress apologized and said ""Sorry it's friday night so we're reaaaally busy."" OK? Did this place just open a week ago or what?? Its a freaking restaurant of course its busy on FridaysLobsters are not in season and we were informed by the waitress that the price would be 36$ Since we really wanted to try it we went for it...when the poutine came, our jaws just dropped. I mean- Why would you charge much higher than the regular price and bring just a normal poutine with literally 6 pieces of curd cheese and tiny bit of lobster on top...just why...and seriously there was maybe just 2 tablespoon of gravy poured on it. Its okay to charge 36$ for a lobster that is not in season but to charge and bring no lobster is a f* joke. Anyway, for what I tasted, it was still pretty good, because any normal poutine you eat is good.....still can't get over the fact I paid 36$ for fries lol The mushroom risotto was delicious but the squash spaghetti with a piece of mozzarella on top was awful. I will give this place another chance because I really want to try their real lobster poutine, so i'll definitely come back in the summer. But for the rest, there are sooo many better options in Old Montreal!"

Obviously the raw bar is a must but the entree was definitely the highlight. Roasted quail w/ foie gras, fiddle heads, morels, caramelized leeks & jus. Incredibly rich but not excessively so. Coffee cake w/ salted caramel brittle and malt ice cream, which of course tasted like frozen Ovaltine, absolutely brilliant. I do want to say that Chuck Hughes is probably the least pretentious celebrity chef on the planet. He was there when we arrived and spent the whole time washing dishes. Probably thought that was the best way he could help and he knew his team had the food handled.Bravo"

The duck was crispy and the waffle was fluffy and the foie gras seared to perfection. As a main I got the short rib with gouda mashed potatoes and it was also delicious. The meat was very tender and you can tell it was cooked with love.My boyfriend had the beef tartare, which was to die for and the flavors were perfect. A little spicy, creamy and served with toast and house marinated pickles. I couldnt help myself and stole a few bites. His main dish was the pork cheek with clams, also great. It was a little spicy for his taste but if you like it hot, its fine. All the dishes were well balanced and the flavors mixed together perfectly.For desert I had the peanut butter cream puffs which were AMAZING. So soft and moist, they were the best cream puffs I ever had in my life.Wine was great and they have a huge list, and our server was very friendly and knowledgeable.

They also start you off with some bread and onion butter that was delicious! The waiter boasted the olde fashioned which my date got and thoroughly enjoyed. My Sauvignon blanc was great with my meal. We stared off with the jerk crab which we were told is the only dish that has stayed on the menu throughout the entire 11 years the restaurant has been open! It was delicious but my date who wasn't used to peeling and eating crab found it messy and hard to eat. However, I loved it! For mains, I had the scallop and pork belly in BBQ sauce. Presentation was on point. This was the most delicious thing ever, the scallops were cooked perfectly and paired so well with the pork belly and the corn it was on. Portion was small which is my only negative point, I just wished there was more for how much it cost. We ended off the meal with the peanut butter and chocolate sauce puff pastry, this was okay but my date loved it! What a great evening, would 100% return on my next Montreal visit!"

/user_details?userid=Uv5v7r1eN4XFsKZ2jwn1sg,Brian C.,"New Orleans, LA",4 star rating,"It's trendy, loud, and even an excellent restaurant.  Be prepared to wait a bit for your table - whether you have a reservation or not - but ultimately it's worth the wait.  Cocktails were quite good and the wine list was very small print and hard to read in the dark dining area but had a few good selections.  Service was friendly but not very experienced, in general Montreal these days is a young, vibrant city but servers seem to often fall into the young and not all that experienced category.Lobster poutine was good but for $18 I would expect additional lobster or something to better justify the price for poutine.  For the main course we went with two fish dishes and both were cooked perfectly and included accompanying Israeli Couscous and Spatzle along with vegetables and sauces that were excellent and didn't seem overly filling.  Because of this we opted for dessert which was unfortunately a mistake - the clafoutis was not great and the ""ice cream sandwich"" just didn't work well - all of the components were quite good on their own but when put together the thick, dense, chocolate on either side of the ""sandwich"" just overpowered everything and made us leave half the dish on the plate.I would return, but be aware that Garde Manger is one of the more expensive restaurants you'll find in Montreal and while it's very good there is definitely room for improvement.  Maybe just don't order dessert as a start."

Would recommend and will definitely return when we go back to Montreal.  Especially since the menu is always changing.  Next time might try the chef's tasting menu.  Go and enjoy!"

Easily slides in to my top 3 best meals ever.Takes a bit to find (look for the pink light), but once you're there it's like a party in your buddy's cabin where everyone is just drinkin, munchin and having a good time. The atmosphere is loud, so if you're looking for a quiet romantic spot, Montreal has plenty that suit that purpose, not this one.Chalkboard menu, top is apps, bottom is mains. Server will happily take a picture on your phone for you so you can easily consult it.Started with Rabbit Agnolotti in a dijon cream sauce. I'm a bit of a cuteitarian, so while morally opposed to this dish, thumper was delish.Hubs had the salt cod risotto with lemon and fried capers. I've since decided I've never had a risotto made right before (including my own) and will need to figure out how they got a risotto to be light and not have carb-remorse is a wonder.I had Sturgeon, Pork Belly, Japanese Mushrooms, Egg and Potato Dumplings in a pork broth. I avoid pork like the plague, but I just had to. It didn't look like much food but once you dig in the richness of it all, so ridiculously decadent I had to restrain myself from licking the bowl. Every component sung on its own merit but was a beautiful choir with the rest. The simple addition of a couple of hot pepper rings on the sturgeon cut through the richness and provided another layer of flavor.To finish up, we had the PB & J Profiteroles. The puffs themselves were not the best I had ever had but when you top anything witha rich and creamy ice-cream-like PB mousse and a delicious strawberry sauce...who cares?!?Hit the pocketbook a little hard, but this is a must visit for any self-proclaimed foodie."

/user_details?userid=17gM1PNJ16EBE0SswBUYdg,Philip D.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I sent this a week ago to Mr. Hughes and his restaurant group. Without a response from him, I feel compelled to post this:Mr. Hughes,Your website and that of Garde Manger does not allow customers to send email messages. I want you to know as a former sous-chef and server, I compliment staff when they deserve it, and more importantly, tip very well. My dinner experience on August 4th at Garde Manger was really quite bad. I share this because if my name was involved with this restaurant I would want to know these details:-My friends were in town from Toronto and wanted to try your restaurant. They booked 30 days in advance. We were seated almost an hour late without an apology and even a recognition that the restaurant was running behind. The greeter, a man with a close-cropped haircut, actually clapped his hands and said 'Come on guys!' while literally waving us into the restaurant (at this point we had come back after having a drink elsewhere and still had to wait). He had said he would text us and never did. I wish I had taken that as a sign.-The restaurant was incredibly hot. Later in the meal someone came to open the front window which helped, but your HVAC was clearly not functioning properly.-The waitress was curt. I'm not someone who expects a server to 'smile' or anything, but there was a cool disdain with how we were treated (I was the one man surrounded by 5 women in my group, and they all commented on this, so I was not alone). Questions were answered in a very curt manner, as in, 'Why don't you already know this?'. She was simply not that helpful or kind in serving us. She also said she would send a sommelier to the table and never did, even though my friend asked to speak to one.-We ordered some dish that was supposed to contain fried halloumi cheese. There was none in the dish. We were told by three people serving us, 'Well it's breaded so you did not taste it.' We stated we knew what halloumi was, and there was none in the dish. We were then given a tiny bowl of fried halloumi with our next dish. That was just in bad taste on behalf of your team, and it's when I started to get pretty irked. It was as if the chef was saying, 'Here's your halloumi, you jerks.'-Even for a fine-dining establishment, the courses were spread out too far apart. We were in your restaurant for over 3 hours for the 'simplified' tasting menu. This was too much.-Our waitress clearly went on an elongated break after the main service was finished. Our digestivos took an agonizing period to arrive to the table - like 20 minutes or more. At this point we were all pretty flummoxed.  Your bar was bumping so much I felt like I was in a supper club.-I did smell a lot of pot wafting through the air during the service -- it easily could've been from outside but some of your staff seemed out of sorts. Some of your kitchen staff seemed to be on stronger stuff than pot. They came over to the table to serve courses and were loud, jittery and too 'in our faces'. Again, I've worked in this industry and seen some things. I can't know for sure but it just didn't look good. -I gave an 8% tip, very low for me. I wish I had given zero, because I woke up at 6:30am and vomited up the tuna tartar. While none of my other friends were that sick, they stated that they all felt 'off'. Maybe I'm more sensitive, or maybe I got the worst dose, but the intense heat of your restaurant and the raw fish flying around just do not jibe well. I eat raw fish and seafood all the time, and I didn't drink any more than usual. It was the tuna.I won't be visiting your restaurant again. I had once been there on business and had a nice time, but this experience turned me off for good.Reading Bourdain's 'The Nasty Bits' after his passing last month, I came across lots of essays about celebrity chefs losing control over their craft in becoming separated from the front lines of their kitchen. I hope this is the case with your place because I have to say that I did not feel welcome in your restaurant. I saw others come in and get hugs from the greeter, escorted straight to seats and served like they were family. This type of vibe at the front door clearly permeates through the core of the establishment. Your staff have made this 'their party', and not the guests' party. I urge you to take action.Very Sincerely,Philip"

/user_details?userid=hN03Wim4nDQ-824277aEsQ,Tyler L.,"Wanaque, NJ",5 star rating,"Famous for the lobster poutine that beat Iron Chef Bobby Flay, the other menu items here are just as good and mostly as opulent. The poutine can be a meal of its own due to the size and heaviness of it. Lobster and poutine were meant to go together and it's amazing that no one else has thought of it. The gravy and curd go well with the succulent meat. The guinea hen, a meal meant for two, could also fill a family with the decadent truffle and foie gras stuffed inside. It's classic French technique with modern Quebecois ingredients through and through. The meat on the bird was deliciously moist and tender, imbuing flavor from the truffle and foie gras into the meat and skin. The root veggies it came with were a little bland, likely because they imparted most of their flavor into the hen. The bread served was also memorably tasty. There wasn't much of a beer menu, but the wine list was top notch with a good selection on both the bottle and glass lists. Service was very friendly, especially at the bar where it felt very personable. The ambiance is a bit hunting lodge like with wood features and mounted animals. Make a reservation if possible as very few tables are left for walk ins and it is constantly busy."

Sitting at the counter gave us the opportunity to meet David, the bartender, and to watch him make fabulous drinks all night.  He was chatty, but not at all intrusive and had great recommendations. He most certainly added to our experienceand makes an epic old fashioned cocktail. For starters, we had the lobster poutine and the endive salad. The poutine was everything we were dreaming of and more.  For main courses, we had the beef chuck and the duck breast. Both were outstanding. Perfectly portioned, culinary marvels. For dessert we had the chocolate mousse with grapefruit/passion fruit glaze.  Absolutely mouth-watering.  Can't wait to go back!!"
/user_details?userid=bJ4QY99vn7FHyLrkOdv5Bg,Thomas W.,"Manhattan, NY",1 star rating,"Most underwhelming dining experience I have ever had. Lobster Poutine is the best dish? There was barely any lobster and you can eat poutine at any other bar in Montreal.  I have had better poutine at bars. The crab dish came from the miscues off Red lobster's reject menu, and the oysters were good, but isn't that credit to the fish monger? The whole chicken was mediocre, shrimp risotto was a recipe from Paula Dean, and the short rib tasted like a rubber tire. The deserts were not bad. Prince point is outrageous, for a Joe Beef knock off. Go to Petit Bourgundy for the real thing and don't waste your time here.The servers were on point, and it's shame that they work there."

The wine selection was great, and the cozy ambiance was just what the doctor ordered for my party of 4. They take reservations, and I do recommend that you call in advance on the weekends.

We started with the lobster poutine. It was good except for the bits of lobster shell in it.  We also ordered the lobster risotto which was good but nothing special. Again this had bits of lobster shell.  The sous vide short ribs were good but then again not blown away. This had a small bit of bone attached to one of the ribs. Unpleasant surprise while chewing but considering the other 2 courses had unpleasant bits in them as well it shouldn't have come as a surprise.  Overall I wouldn't recommend it as there are plenty of other restaurants in Montreal that Id rather try than come back here again."

While seared foie gras and duck confit are French components, the maple gastrique and buckwheat waffle were a great way to inject a little Canadiana. I had a difficult time choosing my starter because I wanted to eat everything but in the end I ordered the octopus with fingerlings, crème fraîche, chorizo, and butternut squash purée and I didn't regret it for a second.Hubby went with the short rib for his main. The meat, vacuum-packed and slow-cooked at a low temperature for 60 hours at 60 degrees, had great beefy flavour and a melt in your mouth texture. It was served upon a large pile of Gouda mashed potatoes and this made hubby a happy man. For some reason I was really feeling the seafood so I ordered the seared scallops with leek, romanesco, speck, and more butternut squash purée. Everything was cooked, seasoned, and plated to perfection but I was left a little bit hungry. I had chosen two fairly light dishes on purpose so that I could end our dinner on a sweet note. While all the options sounded tempting, I was drawn to the s'mores dessert because it involved marshmallows and I am a sucker for marshmallows. The decadent chocolate brownie, topped with warm, gooey marshmallow and graham crumb and vanilla ice cream was the perfect ending.We left Garde Manger well satisfied and ready to paint the town 'rouge'"

Last weekend in Montreal I had the pleasure of finally dining at Garde Manger. We had booked a 7pm reservation on Saturday night (booked 1 month in advance to the day, just to be sure)I want to say everything about the evening was absolutely perfect. The restaurant is small, maybe 15-20 tables in total, with a small bar at the front and an open kitchen at the back. Exposed brick walls, dark interior, incredible large kitschy chandelier type light fixture above the bar. Music was just the kind you expect after watching an episode of Chuck's Day Off - we heard Sublime, Guns N Roses and even the Hockey Night in Canada theme song.The waiter (gorgeous, of course) was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. The food was as amazing as expected. We had two appetizers - a peach salad of some kind with charcuterie, nuts and some type of gorgonzola, and a toast of some sort with chanterelles and cheese on top. Both were excellent.The mains was where we went astray. We made the mistake of choosing 2 seafood dishes - a scallops dish and an octopus dish. Both were genuinely amazing, but the price point was absolutely ridiculous. Sorry Chuck. $37 for 3 scallops and $35 for about 100 gram piece of octopus, I was really just expecting more. Even the appetizers (priced at $12-$14) were larger portions. Folks sitting nearby did order the short ribs and the portion was much more reasonable all things considered. We shared a peach parfait to end the evening, which again was delicious.The total bill came to $230 with tax and tip. That included the cheapest bottle of red they had ($45?), two mains, two appetizers and 1 dessert. Overall an incredible dining experience with perfect food, just marred slightly for me by the portion sizes of the spendy main dishes. I think Chuck owes me some more seafood, to be honest."

We did have to wait about 10-15 minutes past our reservation time to get seated, but the host did his best and there was a nice fire to keep us warm in the waiting area. Our seat ended up being at the oyster bar, which not everyone would enjoy, but we found it interesting. It was great to witness employees who actually seem to like their jobs and the food served!We decided to have the $80 chef's choice tasting option, and although our total bill with drinks and gratuity ended up coming to about $300, I feel that it was a very good value for the amount, quality, and variety of food we were given. Dishes varied from a chilled seafood platter (my first time having freshly grated horseradish!) to endive salad to a sort of surf and turf main dish. Everything was fresh and tasty - the only thing that we felt could have been better was the pork belly dish. The wine recommendation was right on. Dessert included an apple crisp with brown butter ice cream and two very decadent chocolate peanut butter puffs."

A restaurant has a right to change its menu however when you remove a dish that is world famous and a destination dish and you do not have a current menu posted online, you can expect customers to be disappointed. Wound up having a pretty good but extremely overpriced for portion size scallops dish. I live in NY and can get great scallops dishes in 15 restaurants. Having your mouth set for a famous, award winning dish to find it had been removed soured me on the whole experience.

For mains we had; short-ribs with Stilton cheese, 2 had the rock shrimp risotto, and I had the seared scallops with potato and brussel sprouts. I tried the risotto, which was a little too al dente for me but delicious, and the scallops were so fresh and the whole dish was perfection.We didn't really have room for dessert, and two people had some of their special drinks (home-made Five Alive with gin, and a virgin classic Bloody Cesar).

The braised beef tortellini was done well but I wasn't a fan of the al dente pasta. But that's just preference. The spot prawns were great, no shell or head, and very soft. I was expecting a bit firmer but was pleasantly surprised. Wish they cut the baby fennel but still good. I had the striped bass, which was perfectly cooked. Moist and tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. The skin was a little salty but I thought it went well with the rest of the dish, which included spatzle, truffles and a lobster beurre blanc. Omg, so good. Dessert was a strawberry meringue. I'm sure it's called something else and I've butchered it but still delicious! The cake part seemed undercooked and am not sure if that's how it was supposed to be.

They have multiple varieties available, the servers know how each oyster is different than the other, and the condiments are top-notch: finely grated fresh horseradish, delicious mignonette and lovely lemon. Ok, chuck didn't make the lemons but the oyster platter was unbelievably good! If you like oysters in a just a little bit, you love these, and if you like oysters, you will be in oyster heaven. If you've never tried them before, order just one! Give it a try! The braised short ribs are delicious. Lobster poutine, meh. I love lobster, but I like it naked and cold not all saucy and hot. But if you like lobster, fries and cheese goodness, you will love this dish. Best fries ever, the curd cheese was perfect. What strikes me as profound, is that the side dishes at this restaurant are usually so well prepared and delicious, I tend to eat the veggies before getting to the meat! The best Swiss chard ever, the most delicious roasted cauliflower! If you love cocktails, you will love this place! Try their drink of the day, and/or have the special bloody Ceasar. I like spicy food, but find when you ask for no or less spice, it works better in this drink with a huge snowcrab claw as a stir stick! Love the food, love chuck.

It was such a filling dish and the sides were also surprisingly tasty. Halfway thru our meal I saw another table order a seafood app and wanted some oysters. So, we ordered some of that too! The oysters were fresh and nicely shucked... delicious! I also saw someone order a bloody mary with the large crab leg.

The tomato salad was exceptional as well, with its fresh ricotta cheese and bright vinaigrette. The mains weren't anything to go out of your way for. We both had fish, the artic char I had was approximately 6 ounces which was fine but the dish was 36 dollars and there was one piece on top of the other making the bottom piece of fish soggy, why bother crisping the skin. The other fish we got was the stripped bass which was very fishy. The Bloody Mary was really tasty, nice and spicy. The dessert, peach cobbler, was boring and flat. I wouldn't go back but it's worth checking out. It seemed like a tourist trap for people looking for a celebrity chef experience, myself included.

They did not attempt to text me or email me, they should know that there are many travelers from outside the country that may not be reached through calling! Nobody even apologized to me.

Sara: 3/5Suk: 4/5We felt lucky to get into Garde Manger when we called the Sunday morning to ask about reservations that evening and were told, yes, please come at 7:15pm.  We felt less lucky when we showed up at 7:15pm and were told by the hostess, we will be with you in a minute.  That minute morphed into 30 minutes, with nowhere to sit, no offer of water or a beverage, no preview of the menu and no acknowledgement of our presence beyond the first, ""hello, do you have a reservation, we will be with you in a minute"".   I am an impatient person and the only reason we stuck around that long is because Montreal had an amazing video series of it's history projected against different buildings around old Montreal which we viewed to kill the time.  That, and Suk really wanted to eat here. I personally would have been ready to leave 15 minutes in.  We were eventually ushered in and seated at the back bar.  Once we were there, we ordered oysters, jerk crab and the braised short ribs.  If you have read any of my previous reviews you know I do not review oysters unless they are off - oysters are oysters and these oysters were great.  Thank you ocean and thank you fishermen.    No need to thank a particular restaurant for serving the fruits of other people's labour.  The jerk crab was amazeballs.   Yum yum yum!  What's that? This isn't your own homemade marinade? Maybe Graces? As in available at most grocery stores across the country?  So now, one dish which is actually from CH, short ribs!   Tough yet fatty and little seasoning.

We came here for dinner and even though we had a reservation, we were seated in the worst spot possible: in front of a huge pole so that the server could barely see us or our usually empty glasses. The lobster poutine had maybe 4 little pieces of lobster, pretty sure that it wasn't quite how Chuck made it on the Iron Chef ;) The seafood platter was nothing to write home about: the oysters were 'meh', the shrimp was equally 'meh' but the crab was pretty decent. Our main dishes were equally forgettable: my scallops tasted like half a salt shaker was emptied into the sauce. Also, because of said pole in front of us, the server miscalculated refilling my dates glass and spilled a fairly large amount of expensive red wine all over him; that was a nice touch (didn't even get a free dessert out of that catastrophe).I do however quite like the atmosphere, the kick ass chandelier, stone walls, central location and the variety of music though, so see, it's not all negative."
/user_details?userid=7eFy-LxZuvS2K6PAQoibBA,Phil L.,"Seattle, WA",2 star rating,"Over....rated.  The ambiance of the restaurant is great, the menu is written up on the chalkboard, and our meal started off fantastically with our appetizer.  Unfortunately the Lobster Poutine is totally over hyped.  First and foremost, the amount of lobster on the poutine was pretty pathetic consisting only of two large pieces of claw.  The flavor of the gravy was bland as could be.  Since it seems every restaurant has their version of poutine, I would have expected this famous chef to kick it up a notch in terms of creativity.  Simply throwing lobster on a dish to make it ""elegant"" or command the ridiculous price for this dish is simply laziness.  To be honest during the entire trip, the best poutine I had was at Le Roy Jucep and it would put Garde Manger's version to shame."
/user_details?userid=HHtFyuYaWxHvXUzYD_1HYA,Nicolas N.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"This review is for the lobster poutine only.Service and Ambiance:   * We visited this place just for the poutine.  It was late, so I liked the dark, Seattle bar-like (or American), energetic feel of this place.  They were playing Bob Marley too, so I was nostalgic and feeling the love.    * They were busy and closing the kitchen. But they still agreed to make us their famous lobster poutine, which was awesome.Poutine   * When in Montreal, aside from the French cuisine, you have to go to Schwartz for smoked meat and of course, you gotta try the poutine.   It is a common Canadian dish, originating in Quebec in 1950's, made with french fries, topped with a light brown gravy-like sauce and cheese curds.  We had the lobster poutine and it was delicious (compared with others I tried in Montreal).  It had big pieces of lobster and a really flavorful gravy.  I wanted to try the foie gras poutine at Au Pied du Cuchon when I dined there next day, but too much of a good thing can be detrimental to ones health. My body may never forgive me for the abuse and there were other interesting and healthier dishes to sample. Summary:Definitely worth a try, if you are in Old Montreal, if you like lobster, and if you are not too concern with getting fat from the delicious gravy and curds, along with the deep fried potatoes.  It's so good but so bad.  If you are in Seattle, my first and repeating poutine experience was at Smith.  Best spare rib poutine ever! yumm.A clarification to my comments about poutines above.    * Personally, I feel potatoes get a bad rap. No potato in its natural state is bad for us, but rather we make it bad because of how we eat it (e.g., deep fry) or when we decide to eat it (e.g., late night). A potato is a starch and it is made up of simple carbohydrates. Starch has a place in our diet.  Like everything we consume, moderation is key.     * With respect to potatoes, when our body takes in these quickly-absorbing carbohydrates we are forced to use them as energy right away or store them in fat. Unless we are headed to the gym after we eat or consume them after exercise, we are more likely to gain weight from these kinds of potatoes.  When we continually consume quickly absorbing carbohydrates, the high conversion of sugar causes a surge in insulin production. When we continually spike our insulin, we develop a resistance to insulin that has been linked to a higher risk of diabetes and heart disease."

Having an every-changing chalkboard-only menu is a bold move, but it is very clear that Chuck Hughes knows what's up.We had the spaghetti squash with buffalo mozzarella, sultanas and pistachios, along with the lamb meatballs to start. This combo easy takes the cake compared to any version of its more traditional counterpart, good ol' spaghetti and meatballs. The spaghetti squash was cooked perfectly (no broken or soggy strands here), and when the melted mozzarella oozed into it, it was pure butter. The lamb meatballs were deliciously savory, and were cut with a bit of sharp feta, also fantastic.For our main, we shared the duck with beets and butternut squash. The duck was succulent and juicy and the beets and squash were roasted perfectly, with a bit of crisp on the outside, but melt in your mouth mash on the inside. Again, amazing.Dessert didn't disappoint - salted caramel profiteroles. Despite having no chocolate (my usual and often only dessert selection), these little treasures were very worth it.

But for some reason, I never got to Garde Manger. I tried, on occasion to make a reservation online but it was always booked months in advance. I finally got a reservation for this past Friday. We arrived a bit early and we're seated in the back part of the restaurant right away. I was surprised to see such limited choice on the blackboard menu, which, by the way was practically impossible to read from where we were sitting. In either case, no single appetizer or entre jumped out at us. So we went with the chef's menu to get a taste of everything. This came with a variety shellfish including shrimps, lobster, oysters plus smoked arctic char and albacore tuna tartar. The char and tartar were excellent. The rest of the seafood platter was fine...how hard is it to screw up boiled shrimp and lobster? At $100 per person, I was expecting to be wow'd in the subsequent courses. I wasn't. Not saying it wasn't good but I expected more, especially given Garde Manger and chef Hughe's reputation. Second course included a birri tomato salad with focaccia cheese, a spicy zucchini salad with a deep fried zucchini with cheese and finally some beef carpaccio. It was good but didn't blow me away. The final course included scallops with pork belly and corn, pork tenderloin with jalapeño grits and spaetzle with mushrooms and onions. The pork and scallops were very good and I didn't really care for the spaetzle.Overall, I would say it was OK but nothing to rave about. Honestly, I don't understand the fuss over this place. This is comfort food. It's also a laid back place with patrons in t-shirts, shorts and flip-flops. I was expecting a more refined and sophisticated culinary experience. Frankly, I expect more for $350 (2 people including 2 cocktails and a glass of wine each). The waitress was very nice and knowledgeable. Now that I've experienced Garde Manger, I won't be sorry if I don't go back for a while.

The entrees were decent, but my mother-in-law's dish was not hot, it was actually quite cool. The side dish of vegetables we ordered was not the best; in fact, all four of us felt it upset our stomaches.

/user_details?userid=Z-SlxKgqWJsWNKOWRV_uHw,Daniela C.,"Vaughan, Canada",5 star rating,"Best Restaurant in the World. My husband and I have dined at iconic and well known establishments around the world, and this is by far the best restaurant we've been to. We were there on Wednesday, March, 14th, and David took care of us. We had the chef's menu and we were surprised and delighted with every dish that came out. My husband doesn't like certain sea foods but that night he tried it and loved it-- This was all due to the freshness and preparation of the food. The oysters were sweet and delicate. There was not even a hint of any fishy-ness in any of the sea food and fish we had. We loved the variety in the seafood platter. Everything we had was absolutely delicious and layered with different flavours, and nice lingering tastes. The texture of the BC Tuna was so tender, it melted in your mouth. The beef carpaccio had different bursts of flavour and textures and mini potato chips on top which gave it a little salty crunch. We had the salad that had an amazing crispness and thickness; it was both satisfying and refreshing and somehow the Gorgonzola in it was buttery, and not at all overpowering. We also had the juicy pork shank, and even the carrots were nicely seasoned. Each component of each dish was flavourful. The staff was great. We liked the atmosphere; it was very cozy with the fireplaces and lighting.  It was a good loud, with people talking and laughing, which made it feel even cozier because everyone was enjoying drinking and eating so much, that they were oblivious to the fact that it was a cold and snowy work-night. David asked us if we're celebrating anything and we then came out with peanut butter profiteroles and the fireworks for my husband's birthday. Before we left someone came by and asked how everything was, and we held our full bellies and said ""Excellent"" and  ""Perfect"". We were also pleasantly surprised with the bill.  We thought the bill would be around $500, and it only turned out to be $230 for copious amounts of delectable food. We are planning a trip to Montreal this summer just to return to Garde Manger.  We've been telling our friends about it and we already have two other couples planning a trip to Montreal just to go to Garde Manger."

Her recommendations were spot on, including the bottle of red wine that my friend and I ordered. Everything just seemed delicious and worth trying! However, life isn't always that fair, SO...For the appetizers, we shared a small lobster poutine and lentil bruschetta. I would wholeheartedly suggest the bruschetta. It was fantastic and exploding with flavour! I could have never imagined it coming together as perfectly as it did. On the other hand, I had big expectations of the lobster poutine. Unfortunately it didn't quite hit the spot, as I didn't find a single chunk of lobster in my dish... The fries tasted great, so did the lobster gravy, but I did want some lobster in my lobster-poutine. C'est tout.For the mains, we ordered the walleye fish in bonito broth with speck and egg pasta, and the pork chops over eggplant and kale. While the walleye fish was good, it was a little on the salty side. However, my pork chops were mind blowing. I was skeptical, as I often find them to be overcooked and dry, but WOW... They were moist, tender, and flavorful, that's all I can begin to even say about them.Honestly, I was surprised I could even get a reservation here just a day before, but it worked. Maybe because it was in the middle of the week at a late time, but no matter what, this place is constantly on the go and so bangin'. Check it out, no matter how long the wait may be!"

I love oysters! and for the main i had steak something, lol, i don't remember the name unfortunately but i posted a picture of it. When my steak first arrived i was very skeptical about because it was basically covered in celery and I'm not a huge fan of cooked celery. But whatever they did to that celery made it taste amazing. The whole dish down to the cauliflower was so tasty and flavourful. For desert i ate a caramel cheesecake. it was good, the caramel was a bit overpowering though because the layer was too thick and since it was a no bake cheesecake I'm guessing, it didn't have that classic cheesecake texture. Over all i really enjoyed this place, kind of reminded me of ""Joe Beef"" with the whole chalk board ordeal. I will definitely go again soon! See my pictures!"

If anything it was more of a feeling and an experience than just a dinner.We walked in at 6:30 for a 7pm reservation and the very friendly host sat us down right away at a perfectly cozy booth.The menu changes frequently so they don't actually hand out menus, instead they are written in both french and english on chalkboards around the restaurant. There is an option of about 7-8 appetizers and 7-8 mains, all of which are explained by the extremely friendly and pleasant wait staff. Everything on the menus looked appetizing so it was hard to choose but you really couldn't go wrong. Prices range from about $15 appetizers to $36 mains.We ordered the traditional Lobster Poutine to start which was perfect and there was not even one bite left. My friend and I ordered the scallops and gnocchi as well as the stuffed quail with creamed kale to split. Again, there was nothing left on the plate and every bite was better than the last. For dessert we opted for the fried mars bar with ice cream on the side. It was interesting because its such a simple concept but it complemented the feel of the restaurant and comfort food of the menu. I believe we stayed for 2.5 hours. I don't think we really wanted to leaveOn top of that, the night we were there Chuck Hughes himself happened to be filming a shucking oysters segment for his show so we were lucky enough to spend some time chatting with him and getting a photo op.

Probably one of the best service experiences we have had in our life. Very accommodating. I commented on this to the server upon leaving.The food was unbelievable. It's worth noting that there are maybe 5-6 options for both mains and appetizers. However, I think this works to their advantage. While they prepare only a few dishes, they are done exceedingly well. We ordered the fois gras as a appetizer and the Arctic Char and Scallop main dishes. Ingredients were markedly fresh - where did they get those capers? So good. Because I don't drink alcohol, they made me this special lemonade with a raspberry base. Their recommendation and it was wonderful. Atmosphere was classy while also comforting.

They had a tiff over this cocktail, one that should have been ended quickly and without fail. But it didn't really. And the fellow patrons (like me) had to endure this insecure asshat's bluster.

I started with a tomato, cucumber and avocado puree salad topped with fried cheddar balls, which was an extremely odd pairing but sort of worked.

Other poutines we had were twice as big and half the price. Unless you're like me and have to try it for yourself, skip the poutine.We also had the jerk crab as an appetizer. THIS was something to freak out about. The jerk seasoning was amazing; spicy and flavorful. I just can't explain it. It was so good.For entrees, I had the scallops and my husband had the pork chop. I don't like pork, so won't speak for that dish (he said it was good), but the scallops were freaking amazing. They were perfectly seared and crispy on the outside, but soft and tender inside. The gnocchi that came with it was homemade and perfectly cooked and the carrot butter really tied everything together well. YUM YUM YUM.The decor is rustic-modern, if that makes any sense.  It's a small, casual, dark, trendy kind of place.  Our waitress was very friendly and was able to explain all the dishes in great detail.It is pretty pricey here, though.

After all the hype and everything that people have said, I had set my expectations too high. Some of the dishes were really good and others were too salty.The place had a good vibe to it, very busy. We went here for a friend's birthday and ordered a bunch of things. We tried some oysters, which were fresh and yummy. My first time trying raw oysters and I really enjoyed it.We had the fish cakes, which was great on first bite, until we hit the salt. That just ruined the whole dish. After all the rave reviews of the lobster poutine we had to try it. The poutine was ok the smallest and most expensive poutine I have ever tried. It had good lobster flavour, but it wasn't the best dish. The lobster risotto was good, the creamy, rich sauce is where the lobster flavour shined. The amount of lobster included in it was good; but it was a bit one the salty side too. My favourite dish of the night had to be the braised short-rib. It cooked perfectly until it was nice super soft, and the sauce on it was amazing. I recommend this dish to anyone who goes here."

Same experience as other reviewers, hard upsell for wine ($80 bottle of $25 wine) tasting menu. My husband and I meeting an old friend and his wife for dinner--something special as we hadn't seen them in years. Dinner for four, bill of $750.... and here is what we got: entrees and appetizers plunked in the table, that we had to portion. Every time a plate came, the server loudly interrupted us. The room was filled with bachelorette parties and tables of drunk men. A tasting menu, in my experience, is a progression of small plates that the chef has thought through to show off the restaurants menu. Not here. Three regular sized entrees, plunked down, two sides. All at once--and unpleasant together (this sauce? That entree? Or that one? Bleu cheese overpowered, and no idea which dish it came on). Three desserts came--a slice of chocolate cake, a rhubarb tart and a pistachio semifreddo--on a plank. No knife (my husband got up and went to find one) again with the portioning and a mish mash on the plate. The minute dessert was cleared a new guy, large and silent, came with the bill and ran our cards. First attentive service of the night. And then...still amazed...he asked us to leave soon, as the next party had arrived early for our table. All stunned at the comment. Nine of the four of us will ever return, and encourage anyone to avoid the experience."

You have to enter to be sure you're in the right place. Once you enter the restaurant you would no doubt know you're in the right place, this joint is booming and you'll find newspapers articles of the restaurant and the famous chef Chuck Hughes plastered on the wall out in the small foyer.When it comes to food, this place rocks. The menu is written on a blackboard situated above the bar. Whatever we had I'm sure the menu has changed already. But just let me tell you, I had the best risotto here ever. My date ordered a risotto with rock shrimp cooked in a lobster broth. Deliciously good! Would come back here again if I'm ever in Montreal and would recommend anyone to try it out in a heartbeat.

Main courses were short ribs with spaetzle and a scallop dish. Both were perfectly cooked and delicious. For dessert we ordered the ""famous"" deep fried mars bar, and while it was ok, it was nothing to write home about. We shared it between three of us, and couldn't manage more than a few bites each. Major sweetness, though paired with cold vanilla ice cream to offset the liquid sugar factor we made it work. Overall a fantastic meal.

A restaurant Chef rises to fame based on great food and a couple of TV stints. What follows is a restaurant that does not even bother to return calls for reservations, serves mediocre food and treats customers worse than at La Belle Province hot dog and poutine stand. Bottom line is that Chuck has sold out! ""The face of Hellman's Mayonnaise"" puhleeese...really Chuck?!I went to the restaurant on three occasions, with and without reservations. Other than the DJ, the staff seem to think that it is a great privilege to be given the opportunity to dine at their establishment. I won't even get in to the food which was good but overpriced. The service and attitude just turned me off, with no desire to ever come back. Good luck Chuck, one day you will be waiting by the phone for customers to call. enjoy the ride while it lasts!There are plenty of other deserving restaurants in Old Montreal, vote with your feet and wallets!"

/user_details?userid=P9hbcVoZIPKF4gV8KH427A,Aaliyah P.,"Philadelphia, PA",3 star rating,"I want to preface this review with the following -I researched this place hard core before committing and found that everyone said the same thing. Staff rude,wayyyyyyyy overpriced,dark and they make you wait forever for your table. The only one i found to be true was the food is VERY overpriced hence the 3 star review.We actually arrived a little late for our 9:15 reservation this past friday night but were seated right away.FoodThe meal started off on the right foot with a glass of sav blanc for me and a red wine for my dining companion. The cream cheese with herbs and shallots with house made bread is unbelievably good. We of course ordered the lobster poutine and it was as good as everyone says it is. The gravy was solid, the fries crispy and the cheese curds had just the right amount of salt. The lobster was a little less that visible but the flavor was there and i wasn't expecting it to be overflowing with lobster anyway.For entrees i did the scallops with gnocchi and KP asked for the short ribs with spezztle. The scallops were cooked PERFECT but there were only 3. The asparagus and carrots were also a great addition to the plate but the portion was very small and the gnocchi's actually weren't gnocchi's they just happened to be made with potatoes; but were dense , dry and not very good. To me gnocchi's are pillows of perfection these were rotten rocks. The fried mars bar was exactly what you would expect a fried mars bar aka extra fat. I wrapped up my meal with a double espresso.ServiceThe overall dining experience was slow but i like slow. At no point did i feel rushed but we had to request things like water, and more vin. When you are paying the astronomical prices like the ones at Garde-Manger the service should be FLAWLESS  i.e. I should need/want for nothing EVER. One negative for me was the constant up selling, the additional poutine, the seafood platter I mean i get it you want the check to be higher so you will have more of a tip but at some point just chillax with the sales pitch.Atmosphere- Loved the darkness , Loved the candles and LOVED the music selection. I think this place is probably overhyped but i also think the food is pretty solid. I wouldn't suggest  to come back here but if i was in the area and wanted poutine and a nice glass of wine i would head here.Price -$$$$ my half of the check was slightly over 100.00 including tax and tip and only had 2 glasses of wine. Basically come here and be prepared to spend a lot of money."

/user_details?userid=eJvWbwv5AcNd-x-N_OjqNA,Chris H.,"Communauté-Urbaine-de-Montréal, Canada",3 star rating,"Good BUT ... good is abundant in Montreal. Garde-Manger is not consistently among top recommendations in Montreal but it makes the list often enough to form some expectations. My expectations exceeded Garde-Manger's delivery in terms of both food and overall experience. This is another of what I call the ""Chalkboard Bistros"", fine dining establishments that provide the menu via a large chalkboard on the wall in the center of the restaurant. I don't like this practice but it's popular (for now anyway). I found the menu, limited and lacking distinction / personality, with the same style of offerings that are standards around Montreal. That being said, the food was good, it just didn't deliver on the level that I would have expected given the buzz about the place. TIP; request the front bar if bar is given as an option. The back bar can become almost another kitchen-like operation preparing oysters and volume drinks. Back bar can also be pretty tight. TIP: avoid being seated during one of the eating sessions times 6:30 / 9:00pm, the wait-staff can get slammed during these seating sessions and your service delayed and/or intermittent."

And even still, it certainly did disappoint! (Then again, it could have just been a general letdown after the euphoria of eating at Au Pied Du Cochon the night before... but more on that in another review). Anyway, let's start with the atmosphere: we had the earliest reservation available (5:30pm; not by choice) and felt like we were intruding on a casual hangout. One of the servers was DJing via laptop behind the bar. I'm usually not this critical but come on, this is an ""exclusive"" restaurant, have a damn soundtrack or at least surf YouTube somewhere you can't be seen. The other thing  - the bartender told us the cocktail specials - one was something with a vodka base; behind her were varied top-shelf vodkas. We were sitting at the bar so we saw her make the actual cocktail, and it was made with Smirnoff. Not a classy move, guys. Hide that stuff if you're gonna do it.Onto the food. It just wasn't very good. Tasted fresh enough, but not special or delicious by any means. The lobster poutine had like half a piece of lobster on it. We got the smaller portion and she said it wouldn't have big pieces, but it barely had ANY pieces. And the broth didn't taste very rich or lobstery either - it wasn't even salty enough. The mushroom tart we got tasted fresh but BLAND. Really bland. The bison tartare was quite good. That's all we had. The desserts didn't sound very appetizing.What a disappointment -- not to mention that this place is located in the horse-smelling touristy ""old"" village. Avoid it."

/user_details?userid=e9pW6svLyN5uKG87HP2Kmw,E R.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"Absolutely one of the most disappointing restaurant experiences I've ever had, and no, I'm not exaggerating. Every dish was more mediocre than the last. The place is all show, no flavour.Octopus was overpoweringly spiced, and overcooked. This dish was BAD. Whoever spiced this either didn't try it before they served it, or doesn't know how to use paprika properly. The red snapper was dry and bland. Overcooked, in a strange sauce. Tasted like something I might eat at an old folk's home.The risotto was basically buttery puke. No, risotto is not made by just throwing butter and rice into a pot and then serve. The worst were the beef short ribs. First, they were dry as a bone. Second, they tasted like they were literally coated in a film of sugar (honestly, it was probably Diana's bbq sauce. I kid you not.). I took one bite and then realized I was repulsed by the flavour, and couldn't eat anymore. After that, we got the bill, and left. I assume the place is running on Chuck Hughes's name alone. If I wanted to get a severely below average, overpriced meal, I would've gone to a Best Western instead. At least they wouldn't hide their inability to cook good food under a pretentious shell. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because the setting was nice. But then, does that really matter if a restaurant pulls a fast one on you, expecting you to pay (what you would pay at a GOOD restaurant, like L'express or Liverpool House) for a meal like this?  Just shocking."

The pieces of salmon were larger than in a typical tartare which made for a nice texture. Highly recommend both dishes. For the mains, I had the scallops with gnocchi and my husband had the pork chop. Again, both were delicious. The pork was so moist and flavorful. The scallops were perfectly prepared and the gnocchi was light and fluffy. Unfortunately we had to pass on dessert.  After a bottle of wine and all of this food, we were just too full.

And I've had some bad ones. When you walk in the door you are ignored for 10-15 minutes as waitresses & employees scurry about. Then you are asked to wait some more as your table isn't ready. They decided to give us a free drink (one positive thing). We waited 45 minutes to sit. Yes.... 45. We are finally seated, great! We order our food and it arrives in a normal time. One problem, this food isn't anything special, in fact... it's disappointing. Ok, next course. The duck was as tough and bland as an old mans foot. My friend had the short rib. It was better, but nothing special. The best thing I ate was a deep fried Mars bar, made by Mars, not Garde Mange, and even that was overcooked. Our good friend Chuck wasn't there, and is apparently rarely there and it shows. They have music played by a character in a funny green hat. Unfortunately the man with the green hat plays the music VERY loud. He likes Purple Rain by Prince, Living on a prayer by Bon Jovi, and Private Dancer by Tina Turner. Odd. I will finish with the DOUCHE BAGS. They were sitting at the bar. Yelling, screaming, hugging, taking shots, and were quite friendly with the man in the green hat. It was an Ed hardy festival complete with barb wire tattoos. Turns out there were clusters of these people all over the restaurant. Conclusion... 3 people, 3 free drinks, lousy music, average food, douche bags as far as the eye can see. 300$ Yes... 300$. One bottle of wine! I will never go back.

And i'm not sure there was much gravy on the poutine (which explains the cold, rubbery pieces of cheese curds) For $17...a great concept but not well-executed. DisappointingSeared Scallops with carrot butter and green beans. Amazing. The scallops were perfectly seared and tasty. Wonderful flavor and i would have grazed on them all nite long. I had a taste of my friend's risotto and it was divine as well. Dessert: Deep-fried mars bar with a scoop of ice cream. Oh my. that's all i can say. The restaurant got a little smoky towards the end of our visit...i guess the ventilation in the kitchen could have been better. But overall, a great experienceHighly recommend for anyone visiting Montreal"

I've went there 5 times and always waited like at least 20 minutes at the door. Then you are stuck at your table barely able to move. Note that I am 6 feet 210lbs which is quite standard.I'll always remember the barmaid forgetting to give me 10 bucks back on a 20 for a beer. Cheap trick to try to stole my money or an accident... I'll leaving the guess to you.The chef is quite good and I can't complain about his work.

The ambiance is cozy and rustic with beautiful wood and stained glass details, and lanterns hanging from the ceiling. They play an awesome playlist of music that ranges from oldies to hip hop that progressively gets louder as the night gets later.The service at Garde-Manger was phenomenal. Our waitress was so friendly and knowledgeable- she gave wonderful descriptions of the dishes and recommended and let us taste different wines to go with each course.  For dinner, we shared the octopus appetizer to start and the walleye and seaweed speckle entree. We finished the meal with a cherry tart with coconut ice cream- delicious! We stayed after the meal and enjoyed one of the cocktail specials- a basil and mint margarita that was out of this world.I highly recommend dining at Garde-Manger if you are in Montreal. It is a fabulous dining experience that is worth the price- I will definitely be back next time I am in Montreal!"

I guess celebrity Canadian chefs know what it takes to have a great restaurant.The best way to describe Garde Manger is going to your most awesome friend's place and hanging out, having fun and eating great!If I owned a restaurant I would make it exactly like this one.To start off with, it is true, you do have to reserve early before your visit. I booked 3 weeks before for a late Sunday seating. I was pretty stressed out because my group of friends decided to add 2 people to make the reservation for a total of 6. From what I understood, 6 is the biggest group they accept and I figured it would have been a pain to change at the last minute and that we wouldn't get a seat or be really squished. I called ahead and left a message that I would be needed 2 extra people (after 6 no one picks up the phone so you have to call before). I was amazed that when we arrived, they have received my message but misunderstood and thought I was letting them know that there would be 2 less people. Immediately I thought this was going to be a disaster but they were so accommodating and it happened that a large group left and we were seated right away! No waiting! Our waitress was one of the most pretty ladies in Montreal. She was also so friendly and helpful. Couldn't of asked for a better server. I also seemed from around that all the servers and staff were picked as the best of the best in the city. Starting from the host to the guy that takes away the empty plates and wow, so much eye candy! (For those that like that sort of stuff ;))Like mentioned in other reviews, this place is loud! Do not expect quiet classical. More like classic rock for the patrons of this place.But I digress, all this writing and no mention of food or drink! Like already mention, this is mostly a seafood/meat place. I ordered a caesar with some crab legs (best caesar I have had). I also ordered some oysters (I suggest asking if they have certain things you like because they may not be specifically on the menu or mentioned by the waitress). I also ordered a flank steak with these amazing deep fried mashed potato balls. Delicious. Most of the people at my table ordered a scallop dish and it looked and tasted great. They had a big variety of delicious sounding food and I did have trouble picking just one thing. I guess I am going to have to keep going back. :)We also ordered some desserts to finish with and they were all wonderful. The ginger molasses cookie was particularly liked by everyone.Wine list was extensive and a good range of prices.If you are visiting Montreal like me, or live there, you should definitely go and visit my new friends at Garde Manger. (or at least I think they are my friends)."

And I don't even like crab. The pork chop was very good and the steak fillet, which my friend had was very good as well. The bloody merry we had also had an interesting look although I didn't taste. The Foi Gras was absolutely excellent. The Putin was fairly good, although it was the first time I've had putin so I don't have anything to compaire.Be ready to make a reservation well in advance (I think up to a month advance is allowed) and come on time.

/user_details?userid=yHykh6VFpsH_V62bRaq3FQ,Sara C.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"This place is ""hot"".Perhaps because of the music (it's killer, but really, really loud. Huh? I said it's LOUD). Or the venue (it's hidden and indiscriminate). Or the crowd (hip, trendy, and fun with a side of self-entitlement). Or the atmosphere (it's dark and sexy). Or the chef (Hello Chuck Hughes. That's right, chefs are the rockstars of my generation). But shouldn't it be about the food (here I go)? Bread n' butter? Nope, Bread and delicious salmon spread You absolutely need to make a reservation. My sister and I got the 9:30 seating and thought it'd be great to start with a stiff drink. The daily cocktail was tequila, and although I swore off this ish after 'TequilaGate' Whistler 1998, I threw one back. C'est la vie. It was a fresh grapefruit and soda cocktail that packed a mean punch.Of the three dishes we ordered, I must have picked two bad ones because my sister was here a few nights ago and she liked it. Don't worry Chef, it happens to many men, it is normal, and it's okay. Or is it me? After all, I ordered.The beef tartar was good, but there was way too much. I wouldn't normally complain about quantity, but when the tartar is big chunks, after a while, even the biggest carnivore starts to feel cannibalistic.  That's a lot of raw beef... My second choice was the wreckfish (since Hughes is known for his seafood). I didn't like it. It may be that I wasn't picking up what he was putting down?!? The dish is still pretty, init? The night's saving grace was the jerk crab. It was delicious and messy. Oooh, I want to do it again. So yes, I will go back but this time, I won't be ordering. Until then, don't worry Chuck Hughes, I still like youghes."

The gist of our take: good food, but sorely overpriced and the music is always too loud, to the point where you can barely hear yourself think.As a vegetarian, the options for me there are incredibly limited. It's either a risotto ($32 for it with no meat) or a $14 tomato/avocado salad with fried cheese (expensive but very good).Going down the whole menu everything seems grossly overpriced.. the main one being the Lobster poutine ($20)... the portion is way too small for that kind of price.Expect to pay $50/person for a 2 course meal, without drinks. The food is solid but I have a feeling Chuck's fame is adding too much perceived value to his restaurant, and for the price there are much better places to eat in Montreal, even in the Old Port area (DNA for example).Worth trying once but after 2 times I don't think we'll go back for a long time.."

We arrived around 6pm and initially were greeted with a nodding head which signaled that without a reservation it wasn't possible to get a table.  But after having lingered a few more moments with the dim hopes of snagging a table, we were told we could be accommodated provided we would leave prior to the arrival of an 8pm reservation.  We were more than happy to oblige... Alas our cab ride was not in vain!I wasn't very hungry so I ordered a Salade Tomate and the much-talked about beef short ribs to share.  With the minimal description of the Salade Tomate, one would expect a very unassuming salad.  However - I was blown away!  I can confidently say that this is THE best salad I've ever had in my entire life. Any anti-vegetable rebel would get weak in the knees in the face of this tasty tasty salad!  I am still in awe as to how such simple ingredients as: cucumber, avocado, plum tomato, and arugula could yield such a tasty tasty surprise! Of course it was topped with croutons and a fried sharp American cheddar to make it not-so-ordinary!  The white balsamic and olive oil vinaigrette was simple yet amazing!  And the star ingredient which really made this salad was none other than the ever so fragrant - DILL!  Chef Hughes is definitely not intimidated by textures as the crunchiness of the cucumber, creaminess of the avocado, and sweetness of the plum tomatoes tickled my tastebuds.  Then  the subtle tartness of the white balsamic and olive oil vinaigrette and amazing fried cheddar joined the party in this ever-so-impressive cast of ingredients!  The cheddar retained its firmness despite having gone through the frying process and the avocado was creamy without being mushy!  I had found a piece of heaven.With such an amazing pre-entree tongue teaser, the ""short"" ribs had a lot to ""measure up"" to.  While it was no doubt the most tender of short ribs I have ever experienced, it was a little too sweet for my liking.  It was served atop a bed of spätzle and topped with a jalapeño popper.  I would highly recommend having one of each 3 component in every bite so that the saltiness of the spätzle balances out the sweetness of the ribs, and the fritter teases your tastebuds with that added kick of heat!

It's a notion that's fueled countless ""speakeasies"" and secret restaurants like Chumley's, APT, Sushi Uo, Milk & Honey, the Backroom and PDT.After a long weekend in Montreal, it seems the trend has spread.In four days, I had more than a few excellent meals in Quebec's largest city, but the best by far was at a restaurant whose name, for its lack of  signage, we initially couldn't discern. It was only after peering into its window and engaging in haphazard conversation with an equally curious woman from Vermont that we learned the small, impossibly charming restaurant was called Garde Manger, run by Chuck Hughes, one of Montreal's best, and our new mission impossible -- the only available table was at 10:30.Yes, 10:30. Or as non-New Yorkers call it ""Almost tomorrow."" While that might be a deterrent to most, to us it meant ""This restaurant is awesome."" So we went home, had a few drinks and came back. Starving.The meal was more than worth the wait. My pork loin was divinity. The lobster risotto was the best I've ever had. The steak tar-tar, the daily fish, all of it, amazing.

What better way to get recommendations than from those in the ""know?"" The menu was in French. My partner doesn't speak French, and as soon as the waiter heard me translating, he came over to explain it further. WOW. What customer service. I started with the steak and eggs with fois gras. It was beyond scrumptious. My partner had the salad which had fresh veggies and these little fried cheese bread ""croutons"" that were out of this world. Only issue, the portions were huge, and I was pretty full following the apps. For mains, my partner had the lobster risotto which there were no words for how fantastic it was. Huge chunks of lobster and not as much rice as you find in most risottos (which was fantastic to us). The flavors blended and just balanced perfectly. I had fish which was cooked perfectly! All in all, a fantastic dining experience.But the best part was the interaction with the staff. Tim and (we think) Jason were awesome! They chatted with us all night like we've known each other a million years. They gave us recommendations of other restaurants in the city, even things to do. Seriously, felt like we met new friends.

Dropped in without a reservation (not recommended, I'm told) but they had a table for two. Great room. Completely unpretentious but great home-baked ambience.Service from everyone was fast and friendly. Really friendly.And then, what matters, good food. Can only attest for the scallops myself, but they were beautiful. Lobster salad in the hollowed potato was to die for. House Sangiovese hit the spot. Mmmmmm.My colleague vouches for the Steak Tartare and Risotto."

The décor is great and the waitresses are all gorgeous lovely ladies that seem genuinely nice. I don't mind it, but the place could get loud later on in the night. Now on to the food review. For my last visit, I had the salad of tomatoes, avocado and deep fried cheese croutons as a starter. What can I say except what a way to start off the meal! To follow, the short rib. It definitely did not disappoint this carnivore. I was pretty much done after that. No room for dessert. Maybe next time... I saw Chuck Hughes (the head chef and owner of Garde Manger) walking the streets of Old Montreal one day. Needless to say it was the highlight of the day. I am a fan of his work!"

But during our entire meal 530-730pm, there were only 2 other tables and the restaurant only started to pick up as we were leaving.

We ordered and shared the lobster poutine as appetizer for $20 it was good and was generous with the lobster however the portion was rather tiny...I kept eyeing the couple next to us that had some kind of avacodo appetizer, it looked soooo tasty.The waitress was nice and took the time to explain to us their ever changing menu. In the end I ordered the duck close to $40 which was good but towards the end i ate something that tasted really bitter...didnt know wtf it was (since the place was pitch black practically), perhaps the cheese but it sorta ruined it for me. We all ordered different plates so we can eat off eachother and their food was super tasty (pork belly, lobster risotto and chicken with mash)! Good music and interesting atmosphere."

There was no sign, but the place was booming on Tuesday night.  A guy named Kyle was switching between his duties of mixing music from 3 iPods, preparing oysters and scallops and finding time to chat with every person sitting at the bar.  The magic hung in the air.  The place has quite an amazing ambiance in itself, but with the fantastic service, it was irresistible. I've already had dinner but figured I'll try the oysters.  Kyle called them 'my babies' and prepared them while adding some fresh horseradish into the condiments mix as well.  He also gave me a couple scallops on top to give them a try. I must say they've probably been the best fresh oysters I've ever had - incredibly smooth with a delicate texture and nothing else.  The scallops were quite good, as well.  I ordered Grey Goose on the rocks and went to town.This is a perfect kind of place where you feel like home, even if it's your first time.  It's an absolute must for anyone looking for a place to chase the touristy blues away in Old Montreal."

The bartender was attentive and helpful.Went with the tomato salad w/ avocado and those fluffy cheddar croutons which were phenomenal. Best and richest salad I can remember having. Then I went with the halibut which was quite tasty with the veal stock and sitting on a bed of pierogis. Only caveat is it's a wine place so beer selection was limited and lacking.

Maybe my expections were too high.
/user_details?userid=Y3tbsuL6TvViMlgRf3SNgw,Rux C.,"JACKSON HTS, NY",3 star rating,"First, we love Chuck Hughes. We really wanted to love Garde Manger & did...to a certain extent. You do have to book your reservations 30 days ahead of time.  I left a lengthy email explaining that I was four months pregnant & this would be our last vacation for awhile. The Reservationist, was very helpful & got us a rez. As you read on, keep in mind that I am preggo, in our early 40s. I can not drink & my husband is nice enough to give up his wine. When we arrived there were several people smoking it up outside. I am an ex-smoker and I am the a-hole ex-smoker because I quit with such conviction that I do not crave a cigarette ever thereby I LOATHE the smell of it. But since this is ""Canadia"" I moved past that. When we walked inside, there was no hostess. We waited a few minutes until a really nice waiter came by and checked out our rezzz. He stated it would be 15 minutes which was fine since we were 10 minutes early. HOWEVER, two minutes, if that, after we arrived, another couple showed up, and got seated right away in the back section, behind the kitchen?!! As the night progressed we came to the conclusion that the ""back section"" is for friends/family/big spenders and it was rather disheartening. It became apparent there was a class divide. While we were waiting to be seated, the smokers from outside the restaurant began to trickle back in & they were pushy and shoved me and my husband out of the way as they made their way to the ""back"" section. If you get special privileges/seating/whatever I do not care, I was that age once BUT do not shove people around like jerks. I live in New York City being shoved and bumped is part of the reality so when I say we got shoved and pushed I mean it was excessive. The saving graces were: A.) The Bartender: I asked for no alcoholic drinks and she said they have the Virgin Caesar (type of Bloody Mary). I was not sure what that was since the music was a little loud and I could not hear her description so I asked for water. She actually came around brought us glasses and a water pitcher and put it by us. She went out of her way to get to us. B.) Our Waitress: I only kept the CC receipt and it does not have her name. She was working on 9/8 in the front dining room. I really wish I remembered her name. She is/was a GREAT waitress. She spoke English very well, she knew the menu extensively and answered all of our questions with patience and great detail.  C.) The decor is awesome with this beautiful, gigantic chandelier in the middle of the dining room. It was like a chic winter sporting lodge. The music, a bit loud, was very good and I loved every song they played. It  was all over the board from classic rock to alternative and a little 80s and Bon Jovi in there. After we ordered, there were some back-and-forth patrons that were seated behind us. They had their drinks, would go outside and have their smoke and come back in. Unfortunately, there were two guys that decided to stand right behind me, were yacking it up like high school girlfriends & elbowed me so hard in the back of the head there was a bump the next day. He slurrly apologized...whatever accidents happen and it's date night with my hubby. We ordered a few staples that were recommend on Yelp such as the Lobster Poutine, Jerk Crab Legs (both apps) and the Short Ribs (entree) and we asked our waitress for a suggestion for the second entree which she recommended the Scallops. We ordered the Clam Caesar; I got the Virgin and my husband got the normal one. I highly recommend this drink. It was really good and not salty; a perfectly balanced drink (virgin or diesel). While we waited they brought us a bread basket with cheddar butter...OMG it was sooooo good. My husband is not a big cheese fan but he loved it (there were a few pockets of salt). So far so good, our drinks were good, bread basket was good and we thought we were in for a good meal and good night. On to the apps: the ""Lobster"" Poutine......a.) where was the lobster? b.) first time trying Poutine, and thought we would ""do it right"" and we were totally disappointed. The fries were soggy, the gravy was...well it had not flavor, and there were only two little pieces of lobster in a very small bowl of soggy fries, bland gravy, tiny cheese curds and even tinier lobster pieces. Jerk Crab Legs, they were a lot of work BUT worth it. The Jerk Sauce seasoning was amazing; spicy and warm. Great to dip bread in. The short ribs, were cooked perfectly but ruined them by drowning in sauce. The Scallops were perfect BUT we got about 1/4 cup of the pureed potatoes and three scallops for $37!!! WTF?! Saving Grace....the Black Forest Cake...yummy. I see the draw to this place. It's trendy and chic and for a certain clientele. If this was a year ago, we still smoked,  & had a few bottles of wine in us, the food and other things would have been perfect. But if you are not drinking & not into the scene this is not the place for you."
/user_details?userid=QcVGqkL10-sggFSY8wbpLA,Kristin C.,"Bristow, VA",4 star rating,Dropped in after noticing how close we were from our hotel and I have watched Chuck Hughes on his cooking shows for years.  We did not have a reservation and we purposely allowed our 15yr old to eat out in advance and then hang out on the wifi in our room since according to the online reservation site- no one under 18yr is allowed in...? The hostess gave us an early table with the understanding that the table was already reserved in 2hrs so we would need to be through by then which was totally fine.    The 3 of us split the lobster poutine appetizer- plenty of food and wonderful and rich.  I had the cod filet and it had a delicious golden crust and was seasoned really well- salty but I really enjoyed it. My husband tried the pork cheeks which he also enjoyed.  Our 18yr old daughter had the steak and really enjoyed it but recommended eating it with greens if you start with a poutine appetizer instead of ordering the side of fries.     The vibe of the restaurant was very cool blending Old Montreal and its character with the modern open kitchen and chic style.  Love the lighting! My husband walked right by the front door. You have to be paying attention- it is a small front with no specific labeled sign: just a white neon panel that lights up red when they are open.  The front door opens to a small foyer and you must push and walk through the heavy black curtain to find the check in table.    Worth trying out- a little pricey and you must work around their limited hours- but definitely a good stop in Old Montreal!

The maple syrup dessert was overbearingly sweet.  The service was terrible.  Our waiter seldom came around. When we would try to call him over he instead just would look at us and stand around doing nothing. One star for the food and zero stars for the service. Definitely not worth the price.

The place is can be very dark and almost a little too much so. The person I dined with wasn't able to read the wine menu from their seat due to low levels of light.  The place could spare a few extra luxes from the gigantic chandelier that dominates the ceiling.A word about that wine list...it's good, it's long, it's varied. What it is not, is cheap.  Since I'm not in the restaurant business I will never fully understand why wine I can buy at the store triples or quadruples in price when I buy it at the table.  That being said you can still find something that is ""reasonable"" (ish) and will work well with whatever they have to offer that night. If you need help the staff is as knowledgeable about the wine list as they are about the menu.The menu is ever evolving thing I won't go into the details as to what tried. Suffice it to say that what I ate was incredible well prepared, flavourful, perfect temperature, appropriately spiced and left a great mouth feel/texture. At La Garde-Manger the menu is on the wall (also something hard to read at times cause of the light and people's heads being in the way) and its shows what's fresh today.  A good mixed of sea food and other delectable choices there is something there for everyone.A quick final word about the sound of the place.  From entry to exit we heard a upbeat mix of everything from Pink Floyd to Brittany Spears.  Fun!"

It was the worst short rib that I've ever eaten. Flavors didn't work and was nothing special. Spicy jerk crab legs were small and had little meat, esp for the price. I didn't care for lobster poutine. It was the one thing that my husband enjoyed. The only dish I enjoyed was the lentil and goat cheese bruschetta.

/user_details?userid=S1Ot6f-NGcflqkkXnRWpPw,Andi F.,"Silver Spring, MD",1 star rating,"We have rarely been so disappointed by a highly rated restaurant that had all the elements for success--warm ambience, local and interesting delights and not too noisy. As this was our 'special occasion' night out in our week in Montreal, we started out the evening with our 'go to' celebratory cocktail -- the Kir Royale to which our waiter replied, 'Would you like Prosecco or Champagne?' Our reply was simple, 'Champagne, please' as a Kir Royale, by definition, is made with Champagne and Creme de Cassis. We received our drinks and noted that the color was a bit pale but they tasted lovely. Upon further inquiry we learned that they don't stock Creme de Cassis; rather, they use a combination of Porto, Raspberry liqueur, and Pomegranate juice. We were rather put off that this combo was not disclosed (what if we had been allergic to one of those unexpected ingredients?) but we enjoyed the drinks and, in fact, ordered two more. In the end, we were quite shocked to see that four Kir Royales had cost $100!!! We've had these drinks all over the world, including Michelin-starred restaurants, and, frankly, we thought this charge was obscene. We politely mentioned this to the waiter and his response was, 'I offered you a choice between Prosecco and Champagne'; I guess we were meant to know that that was code for 'If you choose Champagne, it's really expensive.' Receiving such a reply prompted us to express our discontent to the manager who basically reiterated the same line. Good customer service requires acknowledging the feelings of the customers! To say we felt mislead and mistreated is an understatement; this encounter cast a shadow on the entire experience and exemplified how indirect communication doesn't serve anyone well. We should have been advised that the drinks were $25 each and then we could've made an informed choice. Additionally, the other food was either slightly above or slightly below average. We will never return to Garde Manger, nor will we recommend it to our friends."

To start, we drank their cocktail-of-the-day, something with muddled blueberries - it was delicious and very refreshing. The lobster poutine and fresh oysters were delightful. For a main course, I highly recommend the Braised Short Rib. It was heavenly - a generous (but every bit enjoyable) portion of meat cooked to perfection that could be cut with a fork. The lobster risotto and special gnocci dish were equally well-enjoyed. The waitress suggested perfect wine pairings for the meal too! The two desserts I tried were good - a warm strawberry crisp and molasses ""cookies"". They weren't as fabulous as our previous courses ... but still well-enjoyed by everyone. Apparently, Chuck works the counter when he's in town. The restaurant is extremely well-run when he's gone, and I will have to go back to Garde Manger in the future.

Decided against the lobster poutine and went with the Jerk Crab and it was fantastic. Spicy, flavourful and a very generous portion.Our only complaint would be its extremely dark.

An avid Chuck Hughes fan and foodie, I was looking forward to this meal and was not disappointed in the least. We had the famous Lobster poutine, Braised short ribs and the tomato and fried cheddar salad. Fantastic!!!!!!  Unfortunately, we had no room for desert. The only downfall is that I didn't get to meet my culinary hero Chuck. Maybe next time, because there certainly will be a next time."

Reservations are hard to get and I was super excited when my date and I were accommodated last minute for the first seating. The staff is super nice and the decor is cozy and trendy. We were really disappointed with the meal. The foie gras appetizer with blueberries was delicious but the piece was very small and the brioche on which it was served was too large and hidden by salad so it felt like you were having brioche with a taste of the foie gras. My Stake Diane had delicious sauce with pickled celery but the meat quality was too hard and fibrous. Our other meal was Cod, very nicely presented, a nice portion of good fish however both meals were way too salty and left us quite disappointed . Once we left the restaurant we had to immediately search for sorbet to cleanse the palate.. It's a great place to have a drink and oysters for the ambiance and service,  perhaps not for foodies."
/user_details?userid=b3t-7HBWPNbScBOvGwgetQ,Vanessa G.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Okay so I had the pleasure of tasting Chuck's fare at a wine event last year and was floored.  Add to this all the hype that  GM has been getting from Iron Chef and The Food Network and I knew I absolutely HAD to go.As you've probably read on here before getting a reservation tends to be tricky.  I tried calling a month ahead and like everyone else I failed to get a call back - BUT in GM's defense if you actually listen to the outgoing message they do say they ONLY call back if there is availability and so I had to go to plan B. Plan B aka Plan ""Show No Mercy"".  And so I put on my Saturday's best, ditched my friends for two hours to go ""shopping"" and dropped by the restaurant with a pathetic look on my face.  Yes, I am sorry to say if you are serious about getting in here you're going to have to cut the dead weight (aka your friends). Getting a seat at the bar is far easier for a group on one than it is for two or three.  Well my plan worked, the lovely gentleman at the front and I were able to come to an understanding which had me seated at the bar in 15 minutes and out the door in two hours (which was two times longer than I needed).   The decor of the place is nice in a dark, shabby-chic kind of way, which compliments it's location in Old Montreal.  The noise level was average, not too loud, not too soft and the music was a mish mash of 1980's classics, which was a nice departure from the constant dance party my ears are often assaulted with in Montreal.  Of course there is no signage outside, but if you know how to read numbers and a map it shouldn't be a problem finding the place. And the food?  OM NOM NOM!  Given that I was leading a secret double life and actually had dinner plans I opted to only try one item - the Cheddar Tomato salad, and it was like a Beautiful Spring day erupting in my mouth.  Fried cheddar, moist avocado, cucumber, red onion and juicy tomatoes on a bed of mixed greens dusted in herbs and ever so delicately dressed in a flavorful vinagrette, it had me saying ""Caprese what?""  I also made friends with another wise solo diner (see who needs old friends anyway), who basically inhaled his Lobster Poutine and then proceeded to drool all over his dinner plate, so I'm going to go out on a limb and say it was pretty remarkable as well. So in a nutshell, if you are completely anal and value your friendships get someone who speaks Quebecois French to call two months ahead every day until they take your reservation OR ditch the friends, wear something fashionable and flirt with the guy at the front door.  In my opinion the bar seats are best anyway because you can see right into the kitchen and the female bartender is not only easy on the eyes but super friendly and informative as well."

It's almost as if they don't want to be noticed ... oh but they are! Just to make a reservation, you have to call their number, leave a message, and their message tells you they will call you back only if they find room for you. Don't show up unannounced or you won't get a table! I was lucky to get a call-back on a Wednesday night for a reservation at 9pm at the bar! After all that, it was a great experience. We ordered the lobster poutine, and it was really good. Some Yelpers have claimed inconsistency on this dish but luckily for us this time, it was very well made. Next we ordered a medium seafood platter which you can see in one of my pictures, it was also incredible. Unfortunately we ate too much to try the dessert but will be returning. The staff was very friendly and always attentive to our needs. The ambiance was happy and lively, and the music was not as loud as some have commented, we had no problem hearing each other. Will definitely be back, provided I get a call-back again!!"

Walked in and had a reservation for the same night. Lets just say that we were dissapointed. Mostly with the service. I had oysters ( very good) cod fitters with creme freshe and cavier( so so) and the short ribs ( excellent) My partner had Steak frites. She ordered med rare and it came blue and was not a good cut at all. The reason for the 3 * is we felt that from the moment we sat down we were getting pushed out. Our waitress was like a waterbug. Never having time for any freindly chatter ( which we enjoy) There were plenty of servers so this shouldnt have been a problem. All in all not a ""fun"" or ""gastro"" experience."

We found the seafood very fresh and generously portioned. We shared a salad with fresh peaches, and finished with the famous Lobster Poutine. Everything was excellent, it was a bit spendy but for that special occasion it was worth it. I will definitely hit this spot again, on my next visit to Montreal."

I was there on a Tuesday night and the place was busy but not full. Sat at the bar near the kitchen so I could see the action. The kitchen is just too small for the size of the restaurant and so things take a bit longer than they should. Excellent food though so if you have a good dining partner (or don't mind drinking) the wait won't seem that long.
/user_details?userid=Sp2qjP8xDti5__4d8LSRyg,Michael P.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"This was our third trip to Garde Manger. Once again it was fantastic! We shared beautiful PEI oysters then cod fritters to start. We each ordered a seafood item from the menu. Mine was scallops in carrot butter which was smooth, silky and absolutely delicious. My partner's dish was the seafood feature dish and it was perfectly cooked and richly flavored. We enjoyed every bite. The desserts were amazing too! If you get the chance, make a plan to eat here. You won't be disappointed. Le Bremner, a second restaurant owned by Chuck Hughes, is just down Saint Paul Street Ouest near the Bonsecours Market and is also a super place to eat - best for seafood lovers as most of the menu is fish/seafood. Our next trip to Montreal will include a return trip to Le Bremner."

I knew I wasn't going to have the best meal of my life since it's a meat/seafood place. The atmosphere was absolutely awesome. I loved it. We sat at the bar, chatted with the people beside us, had some laughs, bopped to the music - 5 stars on atmosphere alone. I love great food without the snootiness of 'white table cloth' style restaurants.My husband thoroughly enjoyed his meal that included: a massive seafood platter to start, lobster risotto for a main and this dessert with peanut butter and jam. I don't think he said one word while eating - he liked it so much.If I were rating just on my meal, probably give it 2-3 stars. My appetizer salad was HUGE - it could have been a meal on its own. I had the avocado/tomato salad. There were way too many onions in it for me - I would have loved to be able to taste the fresh heirloom tomatoes. The fried cheese was also cold and rock hard. I ate maybe half of this. My main was a vegetable risotto. The rice was still crunchy. While I was expecting 'al dente' - it actually had crunch. It also had a smoke flavour - which I didn't quite understand.  I don't think I ate more than half of this either. The dessert that we had was a peanut butter cookie type of thing with ice cream and jam. Meh. Not my thing. Overall, great atmosphere, probably great food for meat eaters (I'm guessing), poor choice for vegetarians. I didn't find it overly expensive - but it's definitely not cheap either. I still had a great time, but going back would be pretty pointless for me."

I still think this a reasonably priced food and fantastic quality. This time, the server was amazing.

They have staple dishes, such as the giant Ceasar with a whole crab leg, a fried Mars bar for dessert, and the giant seafood platters. I`m actually not a big fan of seafood, so I get the beef short ribs marinated in Root Beer. Amazing. You need to reserve in advance even if it`s to sit at the bar - it`s not that big of a place -- but if you call a few days or even hours ahead you might get lucky. Last time we went, we paid $130 plus tax and tip for two full meals with appetizer and dessert plus four drinks plus coffee. The service was amazing too. Outstanding restaurant!"
/user_details?userid=Uevf78dYmGpepl2o8I93uw,Rachel G.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Gorgeous food. I had the pleasure eating both the lobster poutine and the seafood plate as appetizers. The lobster poutine was dynamic and delicious. An unexpected combination to merge cheese, gravy and lobster together but it works fantastically! The seafood plate was classically good - though the flavours were generic. You could have just as good a seafood plate elsewhere.As my main course, I had the pork, complemented with veggies and mashed potatoes. The pork was so tender that it almost felt ceremonious. It felt like a religious experience; that epiphanal moment of finding God... anyway, if you luck out and find the braised pork on the menu the next time you go, indulge yourself. My friend had the risotto with equally good reviews.For dessert, I was not AS impressed. We had the ginger molasses cookie, deep fried Mars bar, and the chocolate brownie. These courses were not quite as inventive as I had anticipated but still quite good. Save a few dollars and get one dessert if you can contain yourself because the menu is not quite as striking. The atmosphere was warm yet urban. The service was quite amiable and servile ;)Be wary that the cheque did add up substantially. I believe the poutine alone was about $20. Perhaps consider this restaurant for more special occasions. I will definitely look forward to coming here again the next time I'm in Montreal."

The poutine was great too but quite expensive ($21). I ordered the black truffle and goat cheese risotto which was bursting with flavour, although was a little too al dente for my liking. My boyfriend ordered the short ribs which he raved about! It is an expensive restaurant, but you are definitely paying for the quality (and the portions are generous). We finished off with a deep fried Mars bar served with vanilla ice cream which was so simple but delicious. We tried it because we had heard so many great reviews about it, but otherwise, there aren't any fancy/ amazing desserts. Very simple items, such as a cookie or a crumble.

They finally figured it out and it wasn't what we had even asked for originally.  We decided to just have the original wine and let it slide being we were so excited to be there.  We ordered the Lobster Poutin to start and also placed our dinner orders.  We were served bread thankfully because it took forever to get the Poutin which the three of us ate in no time because the portion (and we ordered the meal size) was quite small.  We had to cut the lobster pieces on top so that the three of us would at least get some lobster.  We sat talking and waiting for dinner for a very long time.  Finally the food came out and we started to eat.  The waitress then came over and kept trying to clear dishes while we were eating.  We finished up dinner and were waiting for the waitress to come back to give us the desert menu but that didn't happen.  A male came over and put a small piece of cheesecake down and said this is on the house and could we please hurry because they needed our table!!! Are they kidding me.  It was not our fault that they took so long serving us dinner but now they didn't offer us a desert menu or coffee and they throw our one small desert for 3 people and ask us to hurry so they can have the table.  We paid the overpriced bill and left and got our coffee elsewhere.  Not happy was an understatement.  Overpriced, small portions, slow service (until they need your table), never offered a dessert and coffee menu....

The waitress - knowing full well we were tourists - didn't hesitate to omit everything unless we asked, she didn't say a word. Didn't tell us it was $70 for the ""small"". Which by the way should never be ordered by only two people....15 oysters, 8 scallops, 3 sets of crab legs or 4, 10-12 shrimp... Like this was a doozy and she laughed it off like we knew how much seafood we would be getting... How the fack would we?! This is for a group of at least 6 especially if you don't wanna suck down on ""in house shocked oysters and scallops"". Mmmmm raw fish.... We left there $100 poorer and disgusted by the amount of seafood we ""tried"" to consume. About 9 oysters were left.

She tried rationalizing they're ability to do that with some blabbering that made no sense. Lesson learned... Don't ever order a seafood platter that's not on the menu and be skeptical of a waiter that only points to things instead of describing them. By the way this place will break the bank...the last reviewer is delirious..."
/user_details?userid=xzyJzjk5J5vweSJv27Jx5Q,jenilee p.,"Salem, MA",4 star rating,"searching for a decent place to have a late night feast on our first night in montreal, i was thrilled to be able to secure a reservation at garde manger. though the place is a bit of a scene (we sat next to zack braff, fo realz), it doesn't feel that much like a scene. everyone we met in the restaurant was excited to give a little bit of ordering advice, and generally seemed to enjoy themselves. a few singalongs to a cool soundtrack took place almost immediately on our arrival.so, to order? get a bloody mary for christ sake. crab leg in a drink = order it. a nice bottle of wine, (by the way, we greatly appreciated that the wait staff did not up sell us as well expected), and a whole bunch of dishes will make for a memorable meal. we decided after seeing the small seafood platter, that we had to go for the large seafood platter. and it was large. arriving in an antique bird feeder, an array of wonderful scallops, village bay (new brunswick) oysters, king crab legs, and shrimp cocktail was consumed in minutes by our hungry 3-person party. the mignonette and cocktail sauce with grated horseradish was delicious, though these items were flavorful and fresh enough to eat without any adornments. just a great dish to share with three or more people.greedy as we are, we also ordered the poutine homard (wonderful), the beef tartar (best tartar i've had in a long time), and the jerk crab (after having the king crab legs in the seafood platter, we had to go back for more, and it was totally worth it). i'm glad we went back to experience more, although i think that the wait staff felt we were overdoing it a bit. no apologies, guys. it was all delicious.i'd go back to garde manger in a heartbeat. hearing that this place is featured on canadian food network, i hope that they do not fall by the sloppiness wayside. stick to your guns, order the seafood, guaranteed fresh, and enjoy a few drinks. this is a truly inviting, warm dining atmosphere where you will have a great night out. nice, bumping restaurant."
/user_details?userid=fWQERO95eThkP5Tz7xG3_w,Roberta S.,"Hardy, VA",2 star rating,My daughter absolutely loves Chucks place. She took me to a surprise dinner there. I am allergic to cheese so I ordered the flank steak and fries figuring it was the safest choice. Unfortunately my flank steak was tough and I could not cut it. The waitress suggested turning the steak which of course I had tried.  The top of the steak was charred while the bottom was barely colored. The fries were soggy lukewarm and really not what i expected. My daughter and her new boss were my table companions and I Imcertainly did not want to make a fuss. They had consumed their meal and I declined returning my steak for another as they were almost finished when the waitress noted my struggle. All in all a huge disappointment and embarrassment to my daughter.  I felt awful as she had stressed to her boss how fabulous the fare was. Sorry Chuck..... If flank steak is on the menu perhaps slicing it in the kitchen would help. I was terribly disappointed and embarrassed.

It was a wonderful night made special by Morgan who made our seafood plate. We had the Lobster Poutine, a salad and split the medium seafood plate. I definitely will return and ask for a seat at the bar again. The music set the atmosphere, the staff was super friendly; it felt like we were at a get together for a large extended family. Thanks to all of you especially Morgan for a great night and an outstanding meal."

/user_details?userid=gkJbENqCqwUF56-3pzcHiA,Michael D.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"First time at Garde Manger last night. Sat at the Oyster bar and had a great time. Caesars with crab legs are not only visually appealing but made properly. The Poutine de Homard was delicious, though pricey. The Cote de Porc with a duck egg was amazing, the sauce which coated the plate was perfect. We also had the scallops with carrots which were seasoned and seared to perfection.They came with gnocchi which was yummy but a little tough, either to much flour or overworked. To finish the marshmallow coated brownie, brownie was rich and delicious, the marshmallow tasted great though had a little to much gelatine and set to firmly for my liking. Also had 1/2 dozen Village Bay oysters with mignonette and what I believe was a homemade chilli paste, they were fresh and all you could want from an oyster, at a good price also. 6 for $15. All in all a great meal with rich heavily seasoned food and I will most definitely go back anytime I am in Montreal (If I can get a reservation!).  2 of us shared the poutine and then the 2 main courses plus brownie dessert shared, 2 crazy Caesars and another well drink each came to $185 before tip. Pricey for homey food, but it is done very well with an informed and attentive staff, WORTH IT!"

/user_details?userid=6etXXnvghemUQJaJuQE9AQ,Anna B.,"Merrick, NY",5 star rating,"I've been a big fan of Chuck Hughes for a while now and tried, very successfully, many of his recipes from the show.  So, when visiting Montreal last week, we had to attempt to get into Garde-Manger.  We tried to get a reservation, unsuccessfully, for over a month.  Nevertheless, we found the place (more fun since it does not have a sign).  Our plan was to come early - we did not expect to get a table during the prime hours but were prepared to eat as early as 5pm - if necessary.  The maitre d was very nice and suggested that he might be able to seat us around 8pm - which was definitely worth the wait.  And when we came back, the restaurant was full, but we were seated, as promised.  Unless you come with more than 2-3 people and must have a table, it is a big part of the experience to eat at the bar (in either of the rooms).  We got a chance to talk to people seated next to us - young chefs from Toronto, who come every few months to pick Chuck's brain, so to speak.  We also had a very entertaining conversation with the chef and the bartenders on the other side of the bar.  The music selection - which is awesome, everything from Rolling Stones to Gypsy Kings to REM - is a great conversation starter!  We also got interesting info on how it all started (the second restaurant  just opened and the new show is being taped).  And then we ate!  The food was as awesome as we hoped for!  From simple oysters (two scallops on a half shelf were added as a very pleasant surprise) to beautifully constructed smoked salmon and caviar appetizer to the masterpiece of short ribs - everything was pretty much highly perfected (to those who complain about salt - that is what seasoning is and it was exceptionally balanced).   Suggest to try a bloody mary which comes with a full crab leg!"
