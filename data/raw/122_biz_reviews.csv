It was really dark inside, but it was super cool and classy vibes with good tunes and excellent service. It's truly a nice lounge that isn't too loud, and the decor's great! It's actually a pretty big space.The menu has a good listing, and I feel like you can't go wrong with any of their drinks. I honestly can't recall which cocktail I went with, but everything sounds so good that Gokudo's a frequent must if I'm back in town. I also really appreciated that they offer food, especially traditional Japanese snacks."
/user_details?userid=IiFqAnURXyM8HVW8xKsrxw,Jessica K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Rekindled with some friends in this hidden gem and it was a fantastic time. We went for the drinks and stayed for the vibe ~~ The drinks were strong and delicious and the service was more than exceptional. The hot sake really hit the spot and I highly recommend the hojo drink with the nori!! (It's the next day and I'm still thinking of it mmmm)
/user_details?userid=Dt_h4Dt0lVblqRxLLV25YQ,Julie L.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"Gokudo is hidden behind a black curtain of what appears to be a small Japanese sushi bar. Behind the black curtain is very cool open area with lots of seating room. The decor was on point with the Japanese theme. Down the stairs you'll find the bar area and more seating. I am a fan of the ambiance. It's dark, swanky, and modern.With that being said, the prices reflect the theme and you're looking at an average of $15 per drink. I wouldn't get more than 2-3 drinks here. I'd recommend eating first. I was hungry so I had to order food. My partner and I got the Aburi Pressed Sushi and the Onigiri. I wasn't impressed with either. I actually LOVE onigiri but I didn't like this at all. I took one bite and just gave the rest to my bf. The Aburi Pressed Sushi was good, but not the best I've had. I would say 6/10 That should be saying a lot because everything usually tastes delicious when I'm hungry.I like fruity drinks so I ordered the Shiro which is normally made with a Japanese White Peach Liquor. They didn't have it in stock so it was made with a Grapefruit Liquor instead. It was still great but I would've loved to try the Japanese White Peach Liquor. It came beautifully presented, as were all their drinks. I'm told that the Saigo Takamori was also really good.We were a large group of ~10 people but I think this is also very suitable for small groups of 2-4 as well. It would be a great stop on a date night or if you're just catching up with friends over drinks. Classy night out. *pinky up*"
/user_details?userid=lAOkhe0OG_hH39bFLlmxaA,Kevin C.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Cocktails here are very good (I tried the szechuan peppercorn drink which was a perfectly smoked scotch base, the ambience is really interesting and the staff is great - it's all priced in to to the cocktails however (minus gratuity). For $14-15 a cocktail it's by no means cheap. Our bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly which made it an easy time to pick the perfect cocktail, even for my girlfriend who is not big on alcohol to begin with.We also got the edamame which was seasoned with red pepper.Only complaints are the chairs near the bars are relatively small, bolted to the ground and there fore can't be moved. They also always swivel to the same direction which is annoying when trying to talk to the person next to you. The bar can also get quite crowded as well. Cool spot, especially with the Japanese Kitchen in the front."
/user_details?userid=u_89MyNZ3wUz_6J4w1IQeQ,Roy N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Nice, interestingly decorated ""Japanese"" bar with a nice long list of cocktails and imported sake. (They also have other things such as Japanese beer and soju as well). This place is perfect for catching up with a friend in a dark ""midnight"" ambiance. There was a live DJ. The bar was almost full when we got in, the waitress soon asked us if we would like to move up to the bar as spots had opened up, but we were happy with our couch seating in the first room. The bar would have been great for trying out a lot of unique cocktails though."

I like the sofa style seating so u can really sit down and socialize with people.Second, nice cocktail. 13 dollars for a cocktail isn't really expansive. Tastes juicy, smooth and warm. Love it.Third, friendly staffs."

/user_details?userid=NiZK2S0SOfSRR4P50KN98A,Meaghan P.,"Beaconsfield, Canada",5 star rating,"This is a place I could blow my week's salary at buying drinks, they are that damn good. My boyfriend introduced me to this place as a surprise on my birthday before taking me out to dinner. It was a Thursday just after work, probably around 6 this summer and it was maybe 50% filled. Since I didn't know anything, I was rather surprised when he steered down a street and over to a dark entryway with no obvious markings. Gotta love the speakeasy style! When you first walk in, it looks like a small japanese restaurant but then you're ushered through a dark curtain into a classy, modern bar with glittering bottles of alcohol on the wall and Japanese decor. We sat in a little booth on a black couch and the waitress came to see us with seconds. We looked at the menu but I typically prefer speaking to the bar tending staff about my likes and having them surprise me for at least the 1st round. WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED! Hojo Masako (Gin, Sake, Nori, Lime, Salt aka ocean in a glass) and a Bunshin for my guy (a warming whiskey drink with a nice punch). We stayed for another round afterwards but those drinks are the two sticking in my memory. I can't say anything about the food since we were saving ourselves for dinner but we did smell some wonderful smells while there and will absolutely be trying some next time we go. Seriously great place for a good drink to catch up, go on a date, post work wind down with coworkers, or anything else that gets you craving a good craft cocktail!"
/user_details?userid=79PMejA4-xLHlYWPIxAZfw,Meghna S P.,"Milwaukee, WI",5 star rating,"This place is epic! When in Montreal, this place is a must if you are up for a nice lounge in the evening and want to enjoy some brilliant cocktails. The entrance has no name and is difficult to locate it. You have to look out for a Japanese sign (a lamp or a flag) to know that you have reached the location. When you enter, the area is small so people wait in the lobby area behind a curtain to be called in. We got seated within 5 Mins. There are shelves all over the lounge and it has an interesting decor. There are tufted couches all over and inside there is more room which is not seen from the entrance. There is also bar seating available. We got couple of cocktails and my mezcal one was one of the best and unique one I have ever had. It had a very refreshing taste. See pictures! I highly recommend this place if you want to enjoy a nice evening with a feel of Japan and cocktails!"

I really like the decoration and the feel of the place. Like it was described by an article, feels ""den-like"" with a giant tiger mural and some interesting picturesWe ordered some cocktails: Hōjō Masako (hendrick's, nori syrup, kalamansi puree) and Mimitsuka San (gin, red grape, saint germain & cranberry) some sake and some edamame to snack on. Everything tastes great! The staff is very nice, courteous and attentive. I will definitely come back again soon"

The food was exceptional, the drinks were delicious, and the service was top notch. The bartender knew her drinks very well and the sushi was next level, probably the best I've ever had (coming from Toronto, this speaks volumes). I'd come here again for sure!"
/user_details?userid=GnJ2w63izmrICmt1wNCGOA,Laurence V.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here at around 6:30 pm with my boyfriend on a Thursday, and we were told that they were at maximum capacity and we had to wait a bit. We ended up waiting around 30-45 mins, but at least they did offer us water and the possibility to have drinks if you wanted to. The waiting area was designed like a typical Japanese bar, with everything being wooden where photos and writings were hung on the wall. It felt very cozy and authentic, which I appreciated.However, once the heavy curtains were lifted and we entered the main area, I was in awe. It was designed like a speakeasy, where it was modern, somber and yet very classy. The room was barely lit by candles, there were big velvet benches on the side, and huge walls of decorations and ornaments that fit perfectly the vibe. Honestly, the bar itself is spectacular enough to visit!We go seated right under the big tiger painted on the wall in the corner, so we had plenty of room and were very comfortable. The drink menu has many options, including a large selection of sake. We had to ask for the food menu, which once we saw, we were quite disappointed. Online showed a decent amount of dishes that we were excited to try, but the food menu had maybe 5-8 items.The service throughout the entire evening was quite slow. I got the shiro cocktail, which was good, but not worth the long wait. We then got our food a while later, which was the edamame (seasoned amazingly) and a tuna poke bowl which was a bit disappointing considering the rice was not cooked well. We ended up spending a total of 2.5 hours there, and we left paying about $70 still hungry. I guess I had high expectations for this place due to its food menu, but I realized that it's more of a bar where you try different drinks than it is a place to eat. Also with the long service, it just wasn't the greatest experience. However, I still think Gokudo is worth visiting for the beautiful decor! I give it a 3.5 stars."

My friend had ordered 2 kinds of sake One hot and one cold, just to be wacky They were ok by my taste, but im not a fanThough does go well with cocktail in other handWe wanted to try the eel, but they were out And the few other choices just made me pout We were hungry for snacking so still ordered the salad Broccoli based, great vinaigrette, though not worth a ballad We tried the spicy scallops too and that dish was not better The food here just isn't their number one seller The service, cocktails and atmosphere are top notch The prices quite high, but reasonable for the spotIt is definitely not the most unique Montreal has to offerBut I would come here again, especially on someone else's dollar! --------- Installment 41 poetry reviewsCame here back in Nov? Dec? 2018 with one of my best friends, we initially had a cozy little booth near the entrance, but they moved us to the bar thinking they may need the place for a bigger group (which never ended up being the case). We ended up thoroughly enjoying chatting with the bar staff and watching the cocktail magic, so it worked out. The bar's/stool's height is not ideal for too short, nor too tall, people so both me (shorty) and Pat (supa tall) were mainly uncomfortable throughout our 2-3h stay. Harry our bartender from England newly moved to Montreal was fabulous and super fun! Great at mixing those cocktails! His colleagues Brandon and Julian were also really sweet, kool and fun to chat with. I wouldn't recommend it for the speakeasy aspect (fairly easy to find: it's just the bamboo door blends in with the bamboo storefront at 630 A). Nor for the food. Nor for someone with limited time/days to check out Montreal's treasures, but I do recommend it for a sexy lil local date night or a chill outing with excellent service, great cocktails and an impressive list of sake. P.S they will (or maybe have by this point) be opening a new place in the old port, another speakeasy japanese style concept."

Surprise yourself if you can locate the cute bamboo doors and Chinese lantern in the entrance. After going in- I was kindly greeted by the staff - looked a lot like a Japanese styled take away place.I walked down a flight of stairs into the boroughs of the speakeasy- Decor on point, classy, personal and intimate. A cocktail only bar - prices ranged from 10-15$ for a drink. I got the Goto, a single malt drink with oolonng tea- a tad on the sweet side, but enjoyed it. Our waiter was great- Jonathan personable. After  small talk - we found out that they plan on introducing Japanese styled tapas in a few weeks for finger food. Finally a quiet,casual classy place that is not overdone with noise. I'm looking forward to coming back for a whiskey."

Walking in, I was thrown off at the stark black walls but noticed the couches and distinct seating areas which would be great for groups. Further in, the tall dark bar with teal velvet seating, looked inviting and comfortable. It was only then that I noticed the ""Japanese"" artistry in the back wall, if a picture of a tiger is your idea of Japanese, and a few additional couches. The bar menu offers a few signature cocktails including an old fashion but nothing really caught my attention. After chatting with the bartender, I opted for my favourite cocktail, dark and stormy. The drink was perfect, real ginger beer, which made my night! The venue was empty when our group arrived at 9 pm but people slowly trickled in thereafter. The music was soft and pleasant, which made for a perfect setting to hold a conversation. Overall, this cocktail bar is more of a speakeasy than a bar, and I didn't see the Japanese theme as predominantly as I expected, but would return for a nightcap and the great service."
/user_details?userid=c3_AdjAlMy4EJYQhuXADgA,Jason L.,"Charlotte, NC",4 star rating,"Great ambiance if you like dark specialty bars.  The name isn't even in English on the outside, so just get the address right and walk in at the Japanese lantern.  The entrance looks like a full sushi bar but they actually only offer a limited food menu.  I tried the edamame (steamed soybeans) and it has some kind of seaweed and seasoned sprinkle (okake) that is a little fishy.  I lived in Japan and just salt is amazingly good, so I'd rather they stick to the standard.  I think I tasted a little butter as well which would be an abomination if I were right.  The kani-ebi temaki (crab and shrimp hand rolled) appetizer is tiny, about two bites and not really big enough to share but it was delicious.  Make it a double order if you want to share with your date.They have an amazing full bar and quite a few unique cocktails.  The Hojo Masako with Hendricks gin is good but don't eat the giant piece of nori.  As a garnish it's too much.  The Okame with tequila is drinkable but the orange blossom is overkill.  It's one of those things you can easily be heavy handed with and then it tastes like soap. It overpowered the lychee flavor so there wasn't any sweetness and the lychee became a dull aftertaste.Honestly the atmosphere is nice though and even with how picky I can be I really enjoyed it and would go back in a second to try something else on the menu."
/user_details?userid=CtBx4yk_QM8ClITgw94TPQ,Simon P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I enjoyed my visit to Gokudo mainly because of the atmosphere and decor.I had a Bunshin, which is a pretty good drink, however for some odd reason it came with some type of spice on top, something like clove, which was unpleasant to drink and totally spoiled it for me.The food was good, we tried every roll on the menu, but they weren't mind blowing. Think pretty good sushi rolls.After one drink and the rolls we kinda looked at each other like: ""ok let's go somewhere slightly less pretentious with real food.""That being said I would go back if I were on a dat. The vibe of the place is nice. I would definitely have a different drink though. I tasted the Hojo Masako and it was quite good."

I went with no expectations, as I had not heard about it. I had some trouble finding it, but walked in and was so surprised. The drinks are on another level of amazing and the food was really good too. Many places that serve artisanal cocktail usually tend to skimp on the alcohol, but that was not the case for this place. Had the salmon bowl to eat, which was very good and tasted fresh, not fishy- which is what we all like. For the drinks, I tried a few, but my favourite drink IN MONTREAL is pictured here. The left drink was great but the one on the right is amazing. Its honey syrup, lichee liquor, tromba, egg white and an orange blossom flower! A MUST!"

I had high expectations because i like biru and escondite. My best friend took me here for my birthday on a Thursday night. We sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks and shared the tuna bowl and the salmon bowl. The food was nothing special and I recommend just coming here for drinks. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great. I had to add soya sauce to the tuna bowl to make it more flavourful. For drinks I had the gempei which was a mezcal based drink and the gotō cocktail which tasted similar to an old fashioned. My favorite cocktail was the hōjō masako which contained of Hendricks gin and sake and rimmed with pink Himalayan salt. They also have tons different kinds of sake.

We stumbled across this place and took a chance. When we got inside we were very impressed with the decor and ambiance. It had a dark and sexy vibe and was not packed. There were only a handful of people inside so we got to sit right at the bar and talk to the bartender.I'm not a big drinker and don't really like the taste of alcohol but all the drinks that we had were amazing. I told the bartender that I prefer a sour type of drink and he had recommended a drink to me, I'm terrible and forgot the name, but it was amazing! My boyfriend I believe got the Shiro and I had a taste and it was also good.Everyone was very friendly and as it was our first time, the bartender was very helpful in giving us a list of places to check out.We had tried to come back after the Friday we got in but unfortunately, it was closed the times we tried to go.

/user_details?userid=Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I really enjoyed my first visit to this drinking establishment, not quite a Japanese speakeasy but certainly reminiscent of one. Upon passing through the curtained off front entrance, we sat at a tiny knee-height table in a darkened room. Using candles and my phone to read the drink and food menus, we made our orders. Luckily there was an opening at the bar so we were able to move over there which allowed us more room and I was able to watch the bartender (Nick) expertly concocting various cocktails. I sipped on the Saigo Takamori (recommended if you like sweet drinks) and had the Salmon Donburi with salmon sashimi, a tartare and ikura. The food was good, but the cocktails were better. If you have an opportunity to visit make sure to try to grab a stool where the action is happening."

We went when there was a blizzard out, so it was pretty empty. Score!We each got a cool cocktail to begin with, and I got a large salmon rice bowl.  There's a ton of interesting drinks I'd like to try next time. I didn't have high expectations for their food, but it was a great, flavourful bowl with generous chunks of fresh salmon. Then I remembered that the place was owned by the same guys as Biiru. I recommend their yuzu cocktail on their drinks menu.And I can't not comment on their decor. Like everyone else had mentioned, I felt like I had somehow transported to Japan (although I'm sure they wouldn't have high ceilings like Gokudo does haha). Definitely a must if you're looking for something a little different."

I was 100% satisfied with my order and I will definitely return, both for the food and the incredible ambiance. You have to see it for yourself!"

Cocktails were creative and interesting (And although mine tasted like dish soap, it quickly grew on me) while their caramel whiskey was super yum (although a little steep at $17 for what's basically a shot). Cute place, awesome service, cozy vibe, but slightly expensive. Will definitely be back for some food and will update my review when I do, but for now, 4 stars! Be wary of long waits by the way!"

I didn't have a chance to sample out the food, but I'm sure it is excellent -- as it is in all their restaurants. The cocktails were fabulous! I tried the Goto (McClelland Islay Single Malt scotch, Amaro Averna, Oolong Tea Syrup and Lemon-Marrakech bitters), and the Gempei (Scorpion Reposado Mezcal, Midori, Shiso, Agave syrup and lime). Both were excellent, well-balanced in flavours, complex...Staff was friendly and efficient.Absolutely worth the detour for delicious original cocktails, and I'm certain, really good food too.I will be back!"

They also have a great selection of Japanese whiskeys, and the foagura to unagi was really yummy.

The wait for the table is why I gave it a star since we didn't wait so long for a table at a speak easy. As soon as we sat down our waiter looked at us and walked away. I figured maybe he's giving us time to decide on our order. He went mia for at least 15 mins. Come to find out he's at the bar talking to a couple all that time. As he blocks another couple from sitting at their seats because he's hogging up 3 seats and the table next to us was also waiting on him as they arrived a few mins after us. Let's just say we waited a very long time for him to notice that everyone was waiting on him. I give it 20 mins min we waited in total for him to come over for our drink order. I timed it as I was thirsty for a drink. lol so I'm giving them another star for the drinks. It was wonderful. Ambience and decor is what you expect from a typical speak easy.  Just not happy to see my waiter taking shots with his buddies at the bars and totally ignoring us the rest of the night. Another waitress was flagged so we can grab another drink order. While we waited she went to take shots at the bar with the same buddies. Our 2nd drinks were just as good. But at this time, I'm about fed up that they all were taking shots and ignoring all their customers at this point. We had to walk up to the bar to ask someone for our bill. They actually had the balls to ask us how our time was here with their glassy eyes and all. I wish I had what they were having because I left feeling sober and cheated out of my first night in Montreal. Love this city but not this place. Maybe we came at the wrong time but I wouldn't recommend this place for the life of me. Spend your money somewhere else or just become their buddies and take shots with them at the bar."

It all starts outside-you could walk right by the plain wood storefront, but stop when you see the Japanese lantern. Enter into a tiny traditional inspired snack bar but don't stop yet...walk right on through the black curtain like you own the place and step into the black candle lit lounge. Let your eyes adjust then follow the candles downstairs to the sweet bar. Pop down at the counter or grab a booth and peruse the cocktail menu which features many interesting sweet and savoury mashups. My gin based cocktail with seaweed was both herbal and a touch salty-tasty! You can also find a couple Japanese whiskys and sake on the menu. A hip place that gives you a taste of Japan :)"

/user_details?userid=QYC3HlU2lVeocJSU_UP73A,Alex Catherine L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Nice spot. I like the atmosphere and the decor, though I find it a little bit too dark. It's cozy and the drinks are pretty good and affordable. When i comes to food, I would maybe change menu because I didn't find anything impressive there. I know it's a cocktail bar, but food I really enjoy when food options are abailable, and if the menu was slightly more developped, I would've given it 5 stars."

Really cool spot to end a night grab some drinks and avoid the cold in our case."

/user_details?userid=YMBPOVIt1Q7zrNt-gcOvjw,Lisa B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've always had really friendly service and their drinks are delightfully different than your usual bar, a twist on traditional Japanese cocktails. Also their tartar is honestly the best in the city. It is a bit small so be prepared to wait a bit for a seat or get there earlier. And their edamame is delicious."
/user_details?userid=9HmY_yDGomXLT06s-gup2A,Amanda H.,"Gloucester, Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"Stopped in to have a couple of drinks with my husband. We had found this place on Yelp and looked interesting. When we arrived we were seated at the bar and we were served right away. As time went on we became less of a priority, and the staff became preoccupied with cleaning tasks and socializing amongst themselves. We were never asked if we wanted to order anything else, and after my drink was empty for over 30 minutes we had to ask for the drink menu. The bar staff never came back to see if there was something we wanted. We ended up getting our bill and leaving. We spent almost 2 hours there and only had 1 drink.   The cocktails were great, but the service lacked. I"

Exciting drinks, a funky atmosphere, very attentive waitstaff, and great music all made for a really fantastic night. Try the plum wine!"
/user_details?userid=MMKknEw3lR1hZ1-SpORFHw,Diana L.,"Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,"I ordered the pork tofu (absolutely divine), edamame to share, and the taco salad and my partner ordered a hand roll and rice bowl. The pork tofu was 5 stars delicious. The rest was very good with a bit of a North American fusion on Japanese food. My partner was disappointed that the rice bowl didn't come with any sauce which made for a lot of rice without substance, need some soy or tea or something to poor over it. Ambiance is fun and hip. For a downtown spot, it was very enjoyable and the service was excellent. Very friendly and helpful in explaining the menu."

Don't know what happened, but we never got that call. Not going to try this bar after this."

/user_details?userid=EEY-yKOnWOCDVpXuT1s_aw,Mel R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The place wasn't too packed and I think that's what they are trying to do as well. You might miss it, if you don't see the lantern outside, so keep an eye for that. The ambiance is amazing with all the decor and just the right amount of dimness. I went there with my boyfriend and it was a date night. The music is not too strong, so it's nice to have a little chat with drinks. We had the cheesecake, and two drinks. Mine was a bit too sweet but my boyfriend's cocktail was amazing. They had a little show for that as well with burning a little wooden stick to create smoke. The taste was quite similar to old fashioned but it was really good!"
