/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I'll just do a quick summary review of the take-out meal which included a boneless goat roti with mashed pumpkin (squash) with a rum punch. Overall, the meal was enjoyable and did (almost) make me feel like I was not in a city; but on an island with a palm tree overhead.The portion was alright, but I was still a bit hungry afterwards. The curry sauce was not super flavorful, but when I added the excellent hot sauce it brought it up a notch. The roti's exterior and filling were not greasy; a plus and the punch was the real deal; albeit not too potent/rummy.The interior is no-frills and things are made to order, so expect to wait about 15-20 minutes. That makes it extra fresh. They only take cash.I found it was a bit expensive for the portion size (and the extra charge for the pumpkin squash coould really just be included; perhaps a size order portion could have a higher charge), but it was made fresh and authentic, so pretty clear why the rating ended up where it did. Quite good, but not a full on five."
/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Excellent food that satisfied our roti cravings! I'd never been here before but was excited from all the reviews. There is a lot of green space for a picnic about 5 minutes walk away so we decided to take out. The restaurant itself is small, a bit dark but had classic family-owned atmosphere, which I enjoyed. The two staff (married I believe) were very nice and offered us water while we waited. I ordered the goat roti and my boyfriend ordered the chicken roti. We shared an order of plantain. All of that cost about $30 tax in which I find reasonable. They have a selection of Caribbean drinks, some of which are homemade. I'd love to come back and try these in the future.The roti came out hot and were delicious. The hot sauce on the side had a good kick and was perfect to add on top. Nice portion size of everything.  Looking forward to coming back!4.5/5*"
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We went there in the evening of Montreal's 375th anniversary - it's a small, unassuming joint with about 15 seats. The dining room is decorated with plants, both real and plastic, and strangely basked in the red neon of the ""Ouvert"" sign on the restaurant door (why no lights?). Faded pictures and newpaper clips adorn the walls. It smelled good. No one was in sight as we went in, so we sat down and chatted. After awhile, an elder man brought us menus and water in disparate glasses. I think the lady who normally works the kitchen was absent that night, so his husband was handling both service and cooking by himself. We ordered a shrimp roti and goat curry. The man asked us if it was ok for us to order the food to go, since they would be closing soon. It was already 20h30 when we got there and they close at 21h, so we agreed.  It didn't take long for the food to be prepared/plated - we payed and left. We didn't know where to go after, so we just sat on a bench next to the bus stop and ate. The hot pepper sauce was really quite spicy and went great with the curry. The roti was rather small, but the goat curry was huge - it came with rice, salad and plantain, all of which were delicious! We'll be back for sure. Very friendly service and great comfort food!"
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my friends recommended this place to me few weeks ago and as soon as I stepped in inside this small restaurant I think I fell in love.I've been to this place again and I've included it on my list of favorite cheap eats in Montreal. If you've never tried Guyanese cuisine but curious, then this is the place for you. The food I could describe as a mixture of Indian and Caribbean influences. Oh, and if you're a spicy food lover, then by all means you must visit this place!So, it's owned by a friendly nice couple from Guyana and they sure put their hearts into making delicious home made meals. Don't expect this place to be fancy, it's very simple but cosy, there is just a feeling of warmth in this place. The only downside would be that they close quite early (by local standards) so if you normally eat late, I would recommend to get there earlier than usual, maybe around 7PM.And did I mention that it's very affordable? The prices are easy on your budget and you can get nice Guyanese rum with your meal for $3.50. So, if you haven't been to this place yet, I'd recommend to visit it this cold winter."

/user_details?userid=gdYxaKBzD_GxLY9sAnHVdg,Holly R.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Fantastic food! This is one of those whole-in-the-wall restaurants that might not look like much, but leaves you feeling deliciously well fed and it's inexpensive. Suggest it as a dinner out with your friends and you'll be a hero. Highly recommended: the roti in any form. Personally I chose the chick pea without pumpkin but within our friend group we had one of almost every version (with and without pumpkin - an extra addition) and they were all delicious. I had a bit left over to take home to hubby and the owner packed up an extra roti for me (for a very small charge), along with some potted hot sauce, all in a bag to take home. I live in Ottawa but occasionally make day trips to Montreal: this is now my go-to Montreal food stop. I love the novelty of Schwartz's, and can always grab some bagels to take home; this place is worth the extra drive for lunch/dinner!"

Being from Brooklyn and born in Guyana I was dying for some West Indian food so I decided to open the friendly yelp app and see what was available around where I was staying (centreville area) and this gem popped up. I called first because in my experience places in montreal don't necessarily open early. To my surprise a chipper lady with a familar accent answered the phone ( I was stoked to actually hear an Guyanese accent on the other end of the line) she confirmed they were open. :)It's owned by a couple from Guyana (she's the chef & he's the server) and everything is made to order by the chef who happened to be the same lady who answered my call. The resturant isn't fancy but it's cozy, clean and welcoming. The food is downright amazing everything I ordered was fresh and amazingly tasteful.The Peanut punch was amazing, it tasted to as close to the one grandma made, the Mango juice tasted like they had a mango tree out back and it was made with love.The only downside would be that they don't accept cards so bring CASH!! Did I forget to mention that everything is so afforadable in this resturant I ate like a King. So, if you haven't been to this place yet, I'd recommend to visit!!!"
/user_details?userid=sLUems6LCJsPjWpmufQY2A,Steve D.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Excellent roti, very unassuming and casual ambiance, sure they have decade old calendars on the wall, just take that as proof they've been making great food to survive that long. I've been eating the chick pea roti with pumpkin here for years and the quality is unwavering. They make a really tasty peanut punch as well as good appetizers. If you're a fan of hot sauces their house habanero sauce is also a winner, and you can buy a jar of it to take home."

All I can say is that you have to visit this spot.  The food is amazing, fairly priced and served quickly! It doesn't look like much from the outside but you'll be so thankful you ate here. My boyfriend and I split a shrimp roti and potato balls and were both pleasantly full. I did the shrimp, but if you're going for a more authentic experience I would suggest to try something else. I'll be coming back here at least two more times while I'm in Montreal!"

Place is small and at first glimpse thought it was close cause it looked dark inside and no one was there. The couple who runs it us really nice. I had the shrimp curry, my husband had the goat roti and my daughter had the chicken curry, with mauby drinks and a side of pohlaurie. Everything was really good. There was no rush to leave and we enjoyed our lunch. Well definitely return here when we come back to montreal."

Not too hot, just the perfect amount of spice and really tasty. Love when West Indian restaurants have proper homemade pepper sauce available. It's such a huge part of the food culture, so it's a must in my opinion. The roti isn't as big as other places, but it's delicious and was the perfect size for me. I would highly recommend this place to satisfy any cravings for West Indian food. It's owned by a Guyanese couple. They're super nice. I left my cell phone there (oops!), gave them a call about 15 minutes later when I realized and they kept it safe for me until I got there. Of course, just like I would expect from my own West Indian parents, I got a bit of a lecture on keeping my property safe haha, but it just made the experience that much more authentic!Try it out!"

Hello Guyana, thank you for existing, and you have an outlet just a couple of blocks away! Basically my new go-to, add some pumpkin to your favourite roti and savour the finest hot sauce in the region. I keep pouring it on, I keep feeling the burn, and I keep doing jumping jacks in my skull...the flavours are killer, you won't be let down. And the actual roti, wow, just delectable, perfect texture.Sweeeeeeet mom & pop spot with the chillest, happiest people making the most satisfying food. The pholourie is real nice too, and they have beer.I want to marry every meal I have here."

Ask for the hot sauce too, which is hot and great in very small quantities. The place also has a wonderful, laid back vibe, so I felt very comfortable going by myself this time. A previous time, my husband ordered jerk chicken, which was spectacular."
/user_details?userid=fx3jHjZBsNykO2WBLyEZag,Justin O.,"Verdun, Canada",5 star rating,"Best West Indian Roti in Montreal.A few years ago my friend showed me this place after a long day of golf, and it remains as one of my favorite places to eat. First off let me start with the Roti. Roti is kind of like a burrito, but made with traditional 'roti' bread that is native to the west indies. The bread is stuff or wrapped with a curry mixture of your choice. I have two favorites and combinations - goat & split pea with or without pumpkin. The key to the pumpkin is that it adds a nice flavor and a little sweetness, this goes great with their homemade sauce - watch out the sauce packs a serious punch.A few other items that are my go to are the potato palouri & peanut punch. I have not tried any of the other meals, but from the reviews of friends they are great. This is a small establishment, ran by a husband and wife from Guyana. They are extremely nice and very friendly. This gives you a nice feel when you strike up a little conversation with them. Try it out for yourself, you will no be disappointed!"

/user_details?userid=AStTppA8-jqhDxF2kajwaw,Rajendra Réjean K. C. B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Order a plate of their beautiful pumpkin and specify you want it à la Raj Basdeo with the roti on the side. Don't forget to keep it real and eat with your hands. This food tastes better without utensils. Welcome to Guyana! I am ethnically half Indo-Guyanese-Canadian and half Québécois so that makes me the lucky grandson of my amazing Nana who stuffs me to the brim with her excellent cooking about once or twice a week. Even though I have never set foot in Guyana or seen the swaying palms under the Caribbean sun I have grown up with, am genetically predisposed to and was born and bred with Indo-Guyanese flavours coursing through my being. For those of you without an Indian grandma there is Caraïbe Délite! I'm so glad this place exists. This is absolutely authentic Indo-Guyanese home cooking. The dal soup is a must! Just as equally incredible is the pulourie which is a beautifully golden savoury fritter made from chickpeas flour; it is crisp on the outside and soft on the inside and perfection all around. Try the authentically and extremely hot Guyanese pepper sauce. It is made specially from the Scotch Bonnet peppers that grow in the proprietor's home garden. Never tell my Nana this but this place totally makes roti and dal puris a little better than she does at home. I died a little bit inside by saying that but alas, it is true. I love my grandmother very much; thankfully she's not on Yelp. You also need to try the curried chickpeas and potato. They serve it wrapped up inside of a roti usually but I like to order mine on the side in order to eat my meal in a more traditional manner. They have excellent homemade Caribbean beverages as well. Try the mauby which is a non-alcoholic drink brewed from the bark of the Colubrina arborescens tree. It is a bit like sarsaparilla with an aniseed twist. Sweet yet bitter yet refreshing. If you've had a long day basking in the summer sun and smoke of the Tamtams and you're getting hungry or if winter seems a tad bleak take a jaunt over to the Caribbean and have yourself a treat. Come on in, man, the water is warm and you can feel the sea breeze on your taste buds."

The soup was fantastic, spicy broth with tender pieces of goat and vegetables cooked just right. Both the chicken and rice were top-notch. The salad that came with dinner was so-so, but everything else was a hard act to follow. Also they really need an air conditioner or at least more fans, it was a bit hot and stuffy.

This isn't the kind of place I would necessarily go out of my way for, but as a neighborhood place I can pop into between errands to pick something up to have at home, it's great!A few reminders/fyis: they close pretty early and they only take cash."

Don't be put off by the hole-in-the-wall-ness of this restaurant, the food is so good and has that homemade feel to it, and the owners are so sweet and friendly.

/user_details?userid=-S2tlyUUAUl6mE_A-8MUzw,Judd S.,"New York, NY",1 star rating,"I hate to spoil the party here, but I have to say that this was the worst restaurant experience of my time in Montreal. I must preface this sad review with the note that I was so super excited to eat here, I looked forward to coming for days and days while we had other obligations. But this place was a huge disappointment. The first problem we encountered was showing up at 8:30 PM. I admit I like to dine late, but Montreal is a late city - I have never heard of a resto closing so early. The problem was their website and door said they close at 9. But the owner, who was really nice and yet surly at the same time, said he could not seat us because they were closing at 9. So days went buy until I could return. I was really excited about the idea of having French-ethnic food...something Montreal should specialize in. But I later found out that this restaurant serves food from Guyana, not French Guyana - so it is actually a British colony. And we all know how British food is. Maybe that explains what we found - some of the most bland, tasteless, unspiced food I have ever eaten. This was not Caribbean food that I am familiar with; I worked one summer in Canarsie, Brooklyn - a huge Trinidadian community, where I dined on splendid roti every lunchday...beautifully spiced, wonderfully tasty food. I Not here. To be fair, we are vegetarian, and only had the chick pea and potato roti and main course (which was exactly the same, sans roti)...and I heard some repeat customers come in after us and order it with pumpkin. Apparently this is off-menu. And they did provide a bottle of hot sauce on the table. But the problem is that the hot sauce is too damn hot...and the food itself unspiced...so you have a choice of burn-your-mouth spicy or tasteless.And because I can't review a place without talking about atmosphere - they make an attempt here but it is a kind of pathetic one. The cheap chairs and formica tables aren't that bad, but a flashing sign in the window that reflects into the restaurant makes you feel as if you are dining beneath a peep show sign. It's that annoying."

/user_details?userid=SUMGKjiTdVEy4HpCw-9uwQ,David H.,"Berkeley, CA",5 star rating,"AWESOME! Definite hole in the wall. I used to live right around the corner from this place and my roommate introduced me to it. Great little Guyanese restaurant. Actually, I should say ""mom 'n' pop"" restaurant because it really is a mom and pop place. It's run by a couple (sometimes they include their son) a lovely pair really, treat you as if you were family.Now on to the most important part of the restaurant, the food! Now this is no fancy bistro and the menus are actually the place mattes, but nothing to fear, the food is awesome. And cheap, very cheap. The menu items may seem foreign to some of you out there so I'll give you a hand. Order the mulligatawny (with goat). A great soup, the goat just falls apart. Next go for either the jerk chicken (slow cooked in a heavy spice rub, which isn't very spicy, so that the meat falls off the bone), which comes with rice beans and a salad. Or go for my favorite which is the chick pea roti. When the lady (or her husband) offers you pumpkin in your roti do yourself the favor and say yes. Finally, for desert get yourself the bread pudding, possibly the best I've had (with the possible exception of the one I had at Oleana) it's dark and dense and full of goodness. One problem, you have to call well in advance (think lunch time) in order to get it.A must visit for anyone visiting Montréal."
