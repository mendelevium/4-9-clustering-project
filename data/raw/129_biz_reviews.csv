I had been in their other restaurant in downtown (called La Cantina) and enjoyed my experience there. This spot is kind of a small, local, neighborhood restaurant. The inside was neatly decorated. Food was good. For takeout, we had fish tacos, pastor tacos and beef quesadilla. Our favorite waa definitely the quesadilla. They also give out 3 sauces : the spicy, red, chipotle/bbq sauce was absolutely spicy but so delicious. I will come back when covid ends to enjoy a meal in the dining room."
/user_details?userid=RwQUv7Cn61gTkPXcytSrSQ,Amy Yu T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I have mixed feelings about this place. The service was efficient and friendly, nothing special. The vibe and ambiance was chill, the decor is a bit old. Why I have mixed feelings about this place is because of the tortillas. I think it's a corn based tortilla, which makes it taste a bit sweet and delicious. However, the fillings in the taco weren't so great. Even with their home made sauces, they weren't that flavourful nor spiced up. I had a Tortas as well, and although the meat was good, there was too much bread for the proportion of meat and veggies. Again, tasted a bit plain. I would order the pulled pork and fish tacos again, I guess."

/user_details?userid=r6PbQjtij6gcalYWBBrILg,Maria B.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,To be honest I was kinda of disappointed with T&T. I had heard from multiple people that this was definitely a place worth adding to my taco tasting list. However the food and prices fell a little short for me. The playing and drinks were amazing but for the price you are going to be paying I expected more. We got the fish tacos and the al pastor. The al pastor we're pretty good but the fish tacos really let me down. There had been an off taste to them and when I mentioned this to our waiter she apologized but hadn't offered a solution. If you do eat here let me know if it has improved.

The service was good, and the chips & salsa were nice (though I would have liked a lot more salsa than a tiny cup!) but the tacos are the main event, so why are they bad?"

/user_details?userid=GX91UmSdNQrDza5rKhGh6A,Eunice R.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,This place was pretty good! Coming from the states where you can get your fair share of Mexican food I was VERY please that this place makes their own tortillas. That made the tacos sooo much better! We tried the bistec tacos and I thought they were pretty flavorful but since it's mixed with the sliced nopal it wasn't as meaty as I would liked it. The prices are also more on the expensive side for tacos but I think the quality makes it worth it.Also we tried the dulce de leche churros here and they were great! The whole day my cousin and I had been trying the churros across the city and these were the best we had tried so far! I wish they stuffed them with the dulce de leche instead of put it on top but they were still very good. The ambiance is cool and casual nice place to come hangout
/user_details?userid=4Kui4FKoTVkCASsAmyEV_Q,Amy L.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I went with three people and it was completely empty. In all fairness, we went when it was supposedly closed. The emptiness allowed for us to explore the decor - lots of wood slabs with mysterious carvings and/or hammers. The service was slow which was pretty impressive considering we were the only ones in the restaurant. Overall, the food, to quote my friend, was ""incredibly ok""."

The fish tacos are delicious and the churros are pretty good (at that price it's impossible to complain!). Staff was welcoming and extremely nice/polite - truly refreshing to get such great service. We went early on a weeknight so can't say that there was much of an ""ambiance"" but I can totally imagine what it would be like with a full house. First impression was definitely a good one and we'll be back in no time!"
/user_details?userid=Et6YLMrlyX2PCkqtwSVAug,Sabeena S.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Honestly, what semi-decent Mexican restaurant charges for chips and salsa?!? I walked into this restaurant after finding out that Noren (next door) ran out of food. My friend and I ordered some chips, with the most watery salsa I have every seen, and two drinks. The drinks were unappetizing to say the least and I felt that the food would be a disappointment so we left to find another restaurant before the rest of our party could join. I can't say anything about the actual food, but I doubt I'll be back."
/user_details?userid=kYv7-05S0qyzkxtuCDzVzQ,Hana E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is the BOMB. I'm kind of obsessed with tacos and this place will forever be the winner. We usually come here once every two weeks and I have to stop myself from coming more often just so I can try new places. But if I had it my way I'd rent a room in their kitchen and overdose on their fish tacos but what can you do. You can't have it all.Anyways, their menu is simple which is something I love. They have tacos, tortas, guacamole and chips, variety of alcoholic and non- alcoholic drinks and churros for dessert.Service:The service is amazing. We always end up having the same waiter and she now knows us by name. She can even recognize our voice on the phone because we call in to make sure they didn't run out of the fish tacos! TACOS:Let's start off with the tacos (price between $12-$13 depending on the type):All tacos come with 4, and I think 12- 13 dollars per meal is actually worth it because they're very filling. The meal comes with three different sauces: 1). avocado sauce- which is not bad, not spicy at all, 2). tomato - i love. It's pretty mild but you can feel some spice. and 3). habanero - i also love! it's extremely spicy.I've tried every single type and the winner is the fish tacos. In all honesty, they are the best fish tacos I have ever had. I've tried some authentic fish tacos in San Diego but nothing compares. They are so good. I can't even explain it. Even if you're not a fish fan, just try them. They're nicely battered, have the perfect crisp AND they're big! They come with chipotle mayonnaise and cabbage salad on top. I honestly come and get two fish tacos (so basically 8 tacos) and always leave wanting more. As for the other tacos, they're GREAT! but it's so hard to choose them when you have the fish tacos. The pulled pork taco is decent, I feel like it's missing something but the pork is cooked perfectly. As for the Carnitas, it comes with pineapple but I usually ask for extra pineapple and to chop them up to little pieces so every bite has some pineapple. Still pretty good!TORTAS:I've only tried the Milanesa. It's delicious bundle of breaded beef filet, tomato, avocado and lettuce. simple but delicious. I definitely would recommend getting it if you want to try a torta. Desserts: $2.50 for three churros, three different flavours: strawberry, chocolate and dulce de leche. all amazing. definitely try them, I mean you can't beat the price?all in all, try to fish tacos and go all out. Oh, and on Friday's they have 2 dollar tequilas.. If there is a heaven it's then it's definitely called T & T Tacos.- @Hanaer"

/user_details?userid=0KZNZKVCTpURutG_qbMKzg,Alejandro A.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,I was very disappointed. Bad service. Food was bland and the tinga was dry. Did not put any latino or mexican music. Only electronic music. Now I know what you're thinking how can a Mexican restaurant's food be bland And how can they only put electronic music and not some rancheras(mexican music genre) or something? Well the answer friends is simple: nobody in the restaurant is latino. Now how can a latino place not have any latinos working?
/user_details?userid=fxatEcZrrPYNuS55SRUxgA,Wilder W.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Got the Al pastor tacos, they were bland and overpriced for what they were. The customer service is what made the experience truly bad. Staff was standoffish and didn't take well to being asked to modify your order. Additionally, my fork was dirty, and I had to argue with my waitress to get another one. I held out this review because I thought it was a one-off experience , but after seeing the owner rudely contest other customers' bad service experiences on this website , I thought it might be helpful to share mine."

Looking at the menu, items looked quite appetizing. Reality is that out of the 3 tacos types we ordered, only 1 was good. The fish one is worth mentioning. Another good point is their sauces. They are homemade and are actually pretty good.The downside were the bifteck taco and the pulled pork one. The biftexk one tasted nothing. I'm serious, no taste at all... the other one had some taste but the meat was really dtied. For those 2, without the sauces, I would not even have been able to swallow them."
/user_details?userid=lPbszXrXKPnRchbzwVbOIg,Steven V.,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"This place is everything that Mais should be. Excellent well priced food, super fresh, super yummy, strong drinks, and very reasonable prices. About $2-3 for a taco (they come in fours), and about $9 for a super strong, well made drink. Lovely relaxed sitting, great around sunset.So why the Mais comparison? Well it's exactly the same idea almost, but here, the service is friendly and uplifting, with people that actually care.Read: when you walk in to T&T, the staff greet you, are smiling, and really nice. They take the time to spend 30 seconds just to make sure everyone has menus and understands the food, followed by another 30 seconds 5min later of friendly attention/suggestions, to make sure that our initial order is off to a great start. That 1min - whilst pathetically obvious on paper - is rare, and is a game changer. (Read my Mais review).Anyway, I will totally return here anytime in the area. Fav taco place in MTL. Loved it. Simple idea, done well."
/user_details?userid=LPDOx50zUR-rEovzOhADbA,Rachel C.,"Chicago, IL",1 star rating,The owner's comment to my review speaks to the poor quality of the restaurant. Also if you have the time look at the other low reviews of the restaurant to see the owner berate and disrespect people who left his restaurant a review it truly deserved. Also in response to the owner's comment that dogs are only allowed in the front of the restaurant-- the kitchen is in the front of the restaurant which raises further questions as to what he considers a clean establishment.

/user_details?userid=Zsz4pXu5j4Xn48tYkqQVYA,Mtl F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Who doesn't love the fresh flavours of Mexican cuisine? For just a little money you can enjoy a great meal with explosive flavours and if you're lucky enough, have a group of people to throw back a few tequila shots with.  ¡Arriba! ¡Abajo! ¡Al centro! ....y pa'dentro! With so many taco places having opened up recently, it took a while to try the latest contender in the game - T&T. So on a cold Friday night, after an abnormally long week, we headed over for some mexican grub and strong drinks. First Impressions.  Greeted upon entry by a very charismatic gentleman and seated promptly. The decor (or lack thereof) had a cafeteria feel to it with wooden tables and benches. Our waitress was very friendly and patient. Upon being seated she handed us the concise menu which was part tacos, part tortas and  informed the table that the specials for that night were homemade guacamole with tortillas and tortilla soup. Drinks. The menu was listed in shorthand on a chalkboard. PALOMA -  tequila paired with grapefruit san pellegrino soda, was the perfect blend of bitter and sweet with just the right amount of kick. The tequila was not overpowering, which made for an enjoyable and refreshing drink. LIMONADA - gin paired with lemonade san pellegrino soda, was light and refreshing. Ensuing feelings of a destination much warmer than Montreal. TEQUILA - 2 for $5 shots. Enough said. Food.  Homemade Salsa Trio - Habanero, avocado and spicy salsa. The habanero salsa, described as the spiciest, which if you're going to be a Mexican restaurant should be FIRE HOT, was unfortunately, underwhelming in terms of heat. The other 2 options were standard.Pescado Taco - Fish of the day (tilapia), was breaded, deep-fried, served with a chipotle mayonnaise and a cabbage salad. The fish had a moist interior with a crunchy exterior, however was not the freshest tasting. The chipotle mayonnaise was the star here. Cochonitas Taco - Marinated pulled pork, pickled red onions and jalapeno. The pork was tender and flavourful which paired perfectly with the acidity and freshness of the pickled onions and jalapenos. Unfortunately, there was a lack of spice. The kick from the jalapeno was still found to be lacking heat,  even after adding the habanero sauce. Pastor Taco - Grilled marinated pork, grilled pineapple, fresh onion and coriander. This was the worst tasting taco of the bunch. The pork was overcooked, tasteless and the dried-out pineapple provided little sweetness nor freshness. Not recommended.   After tackling the first side of the menu being Tacos, we couldn't help feel a little disappointed. Yes, the tortillas were homemade and delicious but what went in them was far from unique and in need of some much desired flavour. Nevertheless, the portion size (4 tacos/order) was reasonable for the price. Tortas. Described as Mexican style sandwiches were by far the more exciting and flavourful part of T&T. Milanesa Torta- The Mexican equivalent of an Italian veal cutlet panino. Breaded beef filet served with lettuce tomato and aioli, was the perfect sobering  sandwich (1 tequila, 2 tequila..). The homemade bread, courtesy Boulangerie et Pâtisserie Mexicaine Patricia (thanks to our waitress Cecilia for the 411) was probably the most savory, crisp yet soft piece of bread we have sunk our teeth into. The bread was a perfect vessel to absorb the cutlet's oil and the juice of the tomato without becoming soggy or breaking apart - YUM!   Dessert. With only one option on the menu and costing only $2.50, how can one say no to churros?! In a world where watery filter coffee can cost you $3.50, having three perfectly fried churros with your choice of dipping sauce (chocolate, dulce de leche, strawberry or all three if you wish) makes T&T a hero in our eyes. Served warm, on a wooden cutting board, 3 finger sized churros are drizzled with your choice of sauce(s). Although we did appreciate the beauty of having the drizzle on our boards, we would have much rather had our sauce on the side so we could dip our churros. Final Thoughts. If you are going to go to T&T, please focus on the Torta section and don't even think about leaving without sampling the delectable churros! The laidback vibe, simplistic menu which features some star items and strong drinks, make this moderately priced hangout well suited to start your night before heading out to the many surrounding bars."

I've never had fish tacos before here, so I don't have a reference to compare to, but theirs were just as I'd imagined...delicious! The boy got the beef ones, and said they were good (I'm a pescetarian), but enjoyed mine more. Each order came with four, and we're definitely filling. The tacos also came with three types of salsas, ranging in spice levels.  We also ordered drinks - I got the Paloma and the boy got a mojito. Both were yummy :) We were pretty full, but I wanted to try the churros lol. For 2.50, you got three mini churros that were warm and delicious. We tried the chocolate and dulce de leche (more of a butterscotch) drizzles. The atmosphere was casual, but quaint. I would definitely recommend this place!"

Most recently, we completed a pre-order at 10:00 am for 7:45 pm and were informed by the delivery service at 7:15 pm that the restaurant was closed. We contacted T & T directly to learn that they were in fact not closed but too busy to prepare our food.  They refused to help us and prepare our food, even when we offered to pick it up ourselves.We have spent hundreds of dollars at this restaurant but will never return given their unreliability, inconsistency and lack of customer service."

The last time I ate here, the food and service were so bad that I'll *never* go back.We ordered two kinds of tacos, the pastors and the carnitas. The meat in both of them was *extremely* dry and none of the other ingredients were fresh. I suspect that they served us leftover meat from the day before. Neither of us finished our tacos. We did *not* complain, but when our waitress asked how everything was, I explained that nothing was fresh. After speaking with the chef, she came back and explained that he said everything was fresh, so it must've been fresh.Subsequently, they offered us some complimentary churros. These too were too dry to finish.On our way out, all three members of the kitchen staff gave us dirty looks.When spending $50 on tacos, I expect a lot more out of the food and service."

We got 3 different ones: fish, pastor and carnitas - my personal favourite was the fish, nicely battered and a nice topping. The pork felt like it was missing an ingredient, like a veggie or pickled radishes. The carnitas was nice, with a pineapple topping. We also ordered the guac, I'd recommend getting extra lime because at first it didn't seem to have enough. Then to end the meal we had the dolce de leche churros, they come with 3 mini ones. Overall, a really filling meal for a decent price. We each paid right under $20 and were stuffed at the end of the meal. Going at about 5:30 was a perfect time, not busy at all!"

I did enjoy the fried cactus which at first looked like french fries but tasted more like plantain fried. They had 4 cocktails and they tasted great.

/user_details?userid=5wVMvCjRp2lVHvAsi15hAQ,Christy V.,"Boulder, CO",4 star rating,"We selected this restaurant based on Hoang-Khai's very positive Yelp review and I'm so glad that we happened on this lovely family-owned restaurant in the western reaches of the Plateau. We dined there on a lively Friday night with a group of six and we all enjoyed the evening very much. When I lived in Montreal I didn't have kids and didn't give a thought to whether an establishment would be kid-friendly or not but now it's very much on my mind and to my delight, T&T is very kid-friendly while at the same time hospitable to adults and student-types alike. The back area is spacious and simple with long tables and bench-like seating around the exterior. The menu is straightforward and simple - tortas (Mexican sandwiches), tacos, and churros. I like the simplicity but I would say that a few appetizers would be a welcome addition. We were a group catching up after a long time of not seeing each other and we wanted our meal to last longer than just one course. I would have liked to start with some house-made chips and salsa and drinks or sopes or something. As it was we ordered three tortas to share - the vegetarian, milanesa (breaded beef filet), and pulled pork. The two meat tortas were quite delectable - the bread was soft and sopped up garlicky sauces quite nicely. I would say that the pepper in the vegetable torta would taste great if roasted - I think it would make the sandwich easier to eat. On to the tacos - there are four tacos in each order so I definitely recommend pairing up and sharing. We had the fish, carnitas (pork belly to me was a little dry here), and the al pastor, which I loved. The salty-sweet with the addition of the pineapple is so nice. Drinks for me were the very refreshing Paloma (I loved the addition of Aperol in this drink) and the Chelada - a bloody Caesar with Corona. Mojitos, limonada, and some other items were also available along with beer, so there is definitely a nice variation of items. Churros for dessert are a must - we tried the dulce de leche and the chocolate and they were both incredible. Hot out of the fryer and drizzled with sweetness. The bamboo boards and salsa service is quite lovely too. Big plus: house-made tortillas! Amazing! This is a great discovery and I can't wait to return!"

It is a small place that is away from the typical tourist spots in Montreal.  My first impression was a good one.  I really enjoyed the wait staff.  Our waitress was super friendly and knowledgable about the menu.  She gave some great recommendations including a thumbs up to the fish tacos. I was reading about how good their fish tacos were on Yelp and I decided to give that a try.  They were fantastic.  I loved the fact that they were accompanied by three different sauces.  They consisted of a mild sauce, verde, and hot sauce.  All three were terrific.  They all paired perfectly with the fish tacos.For desert, they sell churros.  Mind you, this is the only dessert on the menu.  In my opinion, they don't need to sell anything else.  They were THAT good!  We tried the churros with dolce de leche first.  Talk about amazing.  They were so good that we had to order seconds.  The second time around we ordered two dolce de leche churros and one covered in chocolate.  The chocolate option was just as good.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed T&T.  My only knock on them was the fact that they didn't serve chips and salsa.  While I was waiting for the tacos to come out I was in the mood for something to munch on.  That is only a small complaint.  Everything else was wonderful.  I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone in the mood for great tacos and churros!"

My fiancé and I started with the guacamole, which was awesome! We also shared the fish tacos and the carnitas tacos. The fish tacos were awesome and would give 5 stars, the carnitas tacos were good, but were slightly dry. An addition of a slaw or sauce would make them a 5 star dish as well. The tacos were severed with salsas ranging from mild to spicy. The added spice was much needed after a long cold day in Montreal. For desert we split churros, which were so good we ordered a second serving. We would highly recommend T&T Tacos."

The restaurant may lack colours and decorations, yet the food makes up for it in such a delicious and flavorful way. Along with superb service and a very friendly staff. The menu is quite simple, with quite a few choices for tacos and tortas(Sandwiches) All of of their meals are loaded with a great deal of flavours, spices and a kick. The meals are presented in a simple yet very nice and casual way. Everything is served quickly and very hot, while being freshly prepared to your taste. Tonight we've decided to try both the tacos and the tortas, we couldn't decided which one we enjoyed more as both were truly outstanding. To finish off our fantastic meal, we had the churros. A must have for dessert! They were tender, soft, crunchy. Again, perfect! Served with a delicious silky chocolate ganache and a so so Dulce de Leche sauce(Caramel) I would personally stick to chocolate. Overall, this is a spot I would definitely go back to over and over again. May lack colour and decorations, surely doesn't lack ambiance, good music and outstanding food. I highly recommend it."
/user_details?userid=FuW1EwnbQoHyDMeOGrljsg,Khanh L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"New taco and torta joint right off jeann-mance parc.The tacos are 12-13$, and tortas (sandwiches) are 8$.We went for the fish, pulled pork and the grilled pork with pineapple tacos.They come in four, and they make their own taco tortillas fresh and all. When you walk in you'll the kitchen on the left behind a glass window. And you see stacks of dough and tacos cooking and the griddle.I'm no expert in Mexican, and frankly I'm confused about taco tortillas. Over the years I've had hard, soft, some were borderline pitas. This was soft, and small, no pun intended :PThe tortilla tore very easily, which made is very hard to eat. The fish tacos were the best. The fish was crispy, and the cole slaw added a nice touch. Second best was the pork pineapple, I'm a sucker for pineapple. It was a nice combo. all the tacos lacked a little salt, but I think the reason is because everything is served with 3 kind of salsa, all house made, one regular, one with green tomatillos and a hot spicy one. Even with the salsa it lacked salt for me.Overall I really liked this place and I wanna try the other tacos I didn't get to try.The waitress was really nice, the wait for the tacos to come out could be a bit, but once it starts the service was very good."

Price-wise is average. Really good service. "" la torta vegetariana"" is a reaaally!! good choice.it is definitely  a must- try in montreal"

/user_details?userid=VFsgeIKD55-8L3uvNpCkPQ,Danielle Y.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"Dined here on Sunday, the tacos were actually pretty tasty but the service was really terrible. Took the server about 10 minutes to come to the table after seating. Drinks took almost half an hour to arrive. Server failed to mention that they were out of the bean dip, both the pescado & cochinita fillings, as well as the bread for the tortas (this literally eliminates half the menu) until after we ordered. Tortilla soup was tasty but would have been much better if it were served hot - it arrived lukewarm. One of our party received tacos pastor instead of the pastor torta that she had ordered, this is when the server told us that they were out of the buns for tortas. Was still charged for the tacos (more expensive). Very disappointed."
/user_details?userid=4UgchNZRWkt2XJ3ZtBQTRg,C B.,"Providence, RI",4 star rating,We came for tacos but went with the tortas and have no regrets! Couldn't decide which sandwich to get so we each got something different and went halfsies. The pulled pork is just fantastic. Service was very friendly and accommodating. Can't complain about the prices on the tortas either. We will be going back again!
/user_details?userid=_Dl0TGqwEkGiPpTCFZv_Fg,Andrew W.,"Nashville, TN",5 star rating,We came early & they still served us!! Super friendly staff. The Pastor tacos are the bee's knees & also the pulled pork. My wife & I are from Mississippi so it was a nice taste of home for us.

/user_details?userid=FTsYsxk0-vsSk4uil1VD5g,Feifei L.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,I'd give it a solid three. The tortillas were not very well made and were falling into pieces at one point. Portions of the tacos were not enough for a hungry person and slightly on the pricy side IMHO. Tortas were better priced and tasted pretty good. Decor is simple but good.
/user_details?userid=1IlAUJUVLAUygMiNvavDxg,Nicholas S.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Went to try this place out (October 3rd, 2015) last night because it happens to be a 5 minute walk from my sister's apartment. We walked in as a group of 4 and the place had apparently been booked by a larger group that hadn't yet arrived fully so we asked if we could sit on the one of the ledges with barstools near the door and they kindly obliged! So we sat and and service started out pretty normally, the waitress took our drink and food order. As this was going on the larger group seemed to be casually coming in in smaller groups and taking their seats. Now it was only 7:30 when we placed our order and I was informed promptly after having ordered it that they were all out of guacamole, which for any taco lover is absolutely devastating, but nonetheless I looked forward to the tacos I had ordered. Things started to go wrong after we received our food. Here we were me with my two sisters and their friend sitting here with our messy tacos trying to get anyone's attention to simply get some napkins! But they were so preoccupied with the group that literally even if the would pass by us, we were being completely ignored! But after awhile we did manage to get napkins and finished off our food. We had heard that their churros were absolutely amazing, and coincidentally our drinks were now empty, so we took a vote to order another round of drinks and some churros. This time we flagged Down our waitress who told us she would be with us shortly! I kid you not, 10 minutes went by and no one had come back to see us to clear plates, refill water, follow up on our request to order. This was really disappointing cause all of us happen to work in bigger restaurants than this and we are all familiar with just how demanding and stressful big groups can be, but honestly as a customer our waitress didn't give two shits about us once the group was seated, and here we were literally making the sale for her. Us asking for our check even annoyed them, so like I told my sister that although the food was decent, and I can't speak for the churros since we never got them,But on principle alone I will never go back to this place after receiving such terrible service! What it really needs is a real manager."

The staff is lovely and they make me feel at home every time I come in, I'm a fan of the carnitas and cochinita, in tacos or torta both are damn good! Also they have fair prices."
/user_details?userid=ZNh8MXR56vKG2VZvtogdtg,Joaquin H.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"On thursday it was my fiance's birthday and we decided at the office to go have lunch together at this place, we were 16. When we arrived the place was fairly empty, just a couple of tables, there is usually not much movement at lunch time. The hostress there turned our group down because we had not made a reservation. Her explanation was not that they could not acommodate us but that for such a big group the kitchen had no time to prep. What I would expect is she would have told us it would take longer than usual because we are a big group and give us the option to decide, we would have said yes, just because my fiance likes the place, and of course the totally wise recomendation to make a reservation next time. It's not the first time we decide at the office to have lunch there though never a group this big. I definitelly expected some consideration for relatively frequent clients. I also fail to understand what's the difference, in terms of kitchen prep, between 1 group of 16 and 8 groups of 2 people walking in, something I would consider a good thing for any restaurant. I am pretty convinced it should not be enough to turn down 16 clients and the income from those sales. Luckly we were able to find another restaurant willing to take 16 customers for lunch, regardless if they were all together or not."

/user_details?userid=HVnmIo2AcLUKUMnIscc84g,Ryan G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I visited this restaurant with a group of friends. As the other reviewers wrote, it is definitely kid friendly, but also easily accommodates adults looking to grab some drinks and nomz. The food is AWESOME. The menu is simple, which I like, because I don't need to spend an hour looking. Tacos or tortas. Those are your options. I had the carnitas (pork belly) and it was amazing. My partner had the fish taco (fried) and they were to die for. These aren't massive tacos, but they are reasonably priced and the presentation is quite stunning, and it comes with 4 on a wooden serving tray. The tortillas are clearly home-made and are awesome. They came with 3 types of sauces - a habanero sauce (epic), a red-tomato sauce (very mild) and a green sauce with avocado. the drinks were also amazing!!! i'm definitely coming back to this place frequently."
/user_details?userid=bj2_KPCKpQdNlN8hlHSxdg,Cat D.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Was excited to try this place out as I'm always on the hunt for tasty tacos. Unfortunately, there is a lot of work to be done here before this joint warrants a higher rating. To start, it is suffering from what I call hipster inflation. Reputation does not match reality. I ate the carnitas, four average sized tacos with some unfortunate dried out pork and no complex flavour to take away from the dryness. This dish was majorly lacking, and for $12, was a ripoff. I also had a spiked lemonade cocktail which was good, not the strongest I've had, but also not too weak: run of the mill I would say. For $9 bucks, I probably wouldn't order it again since I would need 4-5 of them to get a buzz (but I'm no lightweight so don't necessarily take my word on it!). My companion had a winner, the fish tacos. They were fried in panko crust and had some cabbage. The two sauces, one red and one green, were just ok, not memorable. Basically, if I had to go back, I would stick to the fish tacos but for the portion and price point ($13), I can find better. Impactaco is much cheaper, and even though that location is a bit sketch, their carnitas is to die for and $1 on certain days!!!"
