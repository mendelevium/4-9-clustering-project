We both started off with double lattés and then we had the Mexican breakfast which included 2 burritos, home fries and we replaced the fruit with sliced tomatoes. Our server was very pleasant and answered all our questions with a smile. We came back here for breakfast this morning. This time I had chicken and waffles and Pooh breakfast Poutine - both delicious!!!"
/user_details?userid=yERJfPKhhU49aJAJ6DvqEg,Sian D.,"Kirkland, Canada",3 star rating,"Universel is located on Peel street in the middle of downtown Montreal. Overall this place was good, but Montreal has so many amazing brunch spots that sometimes good doesn't cut it. We went with a group of 10 people. Reserved ahead of time but they didn't have a table ready for us when we got there (even though the restaurant was pretty empty). In addition, they first put us at two different tables instead of combining them into one long one (which was very possible and which we ended up doing). Apart from this, however, the service was good. The servers were very sweet, fast, and efficient for serving such a large table. The menu was very comprehensive and everything sounded delicious. The food was good, but nothing to write home about. The presentation of the eggs benny was also average. The atmosphere was really nice out on the patio."
/user_details?userid=X0NJT_YrZg6-U9oRGJcYKQ,Eric B.,"Lewisville, TX",4 star rating,"What a great place for breakfast !Service was above and beyond but the check was a little pricey.Tables are a bit close so we ended up making friends with a few tables next to us and really had a socially good time, talking to people from all over Canada . We just happened to be in town when they were having a marathon so there were many people in town for this. I ordered the sampler breakfast and as you can see it had a little bit of everything on it, even a scoop of meat type deviled ham salad stuff below the orange in the pic I attached.After finishing it all I was content until lunch.This place seemed to be in a great location in Montreal to start the day if you are walking the city like us.If I am ever near here again I would stop back in."
/user_details?userid=uDBnapEGywTQ0ovaCu7Orw,Shaji K.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,"No reservations needed for a group of four on a Saturday morning. Packed restaurant with lots of enticing dishes to choose from as you're waiting to place your order.Again, the menu has all sorts of options, but couldn't say no to the Breakfast Poutine ($12). A layering of home fries, curds, Hollondaise, gravy, bacon, and a sunny-side up egg. Despite everything involved in the dish, the portion size was moderate enough to not make you too full. Fries are crisp and the egg/bacon is always a good combination.Service can take a little bit considering the crowd, but not egregiously slow. Would come back again to try a crepe."
/user_details?userid=gRTJX1byUA31E0OBqfYPIw,Veronica C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great place for brunch in the heart of downtown! I ordered the classic eggs benedict and a chocolate milkshake. The eggs benedict was spot on! I would definitely recommend the eggs benedict. The chocolate milkshake was pretty good, not too sweet. Although, the breakfast potatoes were a bit too salty for me. The portion was pretty big, I barely got through it. I loved the outdoor seating! Very cozy and cute! I would like to come back next time and try out their lunch menu!"

The food is so amazing and well cooked that I never even got a chance to take a picture of it. The plates are a great size for the price you pay. I am also very pleased with the atmosphere of the place, very clean, professional and beautifully decorated. The staff was extremely helpful and speak an array of languages in case you are not from the area. Everything on the menu is worth trying and I guarantee it won't be a place you regret."
/user_details?userid=a6GEhVJLqK6sxp3HPwqAeQ,Vanessa W.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Breakfast Poutine - Delicious and filling! This is definitely a heavier dish, so be warned. Personally, I feel there was a tad too much of the hollandaise sauce and thought the bites with hot dog pieces were pretty overpoweringly hot dog flavored rather than balanced. Overall a good, hearty breakfast though, complete with home fries, cheese curds, bacon, hot dog pieces, hollandaise sauce for that brunch feel, and an egg cooked in your choice of style!Madagascar Mussels - Good flavor and solid portion size! You can definitely taste the cognac in the sauce! The fries were delicious and went well together."

I have been to this restaurant on many occasions at different times of the day, and different days of the week and have yet to be disappointed! They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner! They serve Mimosas which is a + in my books whenever having brunch...KUDOS to this Restaurant's team and management!Their specials on drinks vary depending on the day of the week... personally, I love their 2/1 on Martinis (2/$13) on Fridays...they know how to make drinks and especially Martinis, in other words, they are not skimpy on the alcohol...Food portions are great to generous....5/5Quality of food is and has always been consistent5/5Service always on point 5/5Dining area and restrooms are always clean 5/5This restaurant is within walking distance from Peel metro station (green line)Street parking is availableTerrasse is available during the Summer season There are other Universel restaurants, but I vouch for this location as I have been going there since 2014."
/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Pretty good standard breakfast in the heart of downtown. I came here with a friend on Saturday around 11 and we waited about 15 minutes for a table. We were seated on their patio which was nice for people watching and enjoying the last days of nice weather. The menu is huge, classic brunch options. My friend and I shared an omelet as well as a combo plate which came with eggs, toast, French toast and some fruit. Both plates came with potatoes. The food was good and came out hot. The price is fair for the location. Service was pleasant.I wouldn't come here for a special occasion brunch but definitely for a post hangover brunch if that makes sense!"
/user_details?userid=vSq8bbhNxXUf2UR29lpdXA,Chanelle D.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Took me a while to select from the menu. So many options, all very affordable. Service was awesome. The eggs benedict wasn't amazing and the portion was generous. The breakfast dishes were combos which included crepes, waffles, eggs and bacon (sweet and salty)."
/user_details?userid=Nq6e5N8bjgD9B46O4va_zA,Sarah S.,"Vaughan, Canada",4 star rating,"The eggs benedict with smoked salmon was delicious. Smoked salmon in particular was very fresh even at 2 pm, which says a lot about the restaurant. For some reason we were being lead to a table where there was an accident (liquid everywhere on the floor, mirror behind table was broken!). Staff should be more attentive and clean up EVERYTHING before seating customers. Decor was generic - the interior is modern and the colour palette is lime green and silver (which I find over done). Overall, it's a good place to stop by for some quality food."
/user_details?userid=_4x70B1gvBmqqa9TzUamYA,Deborah C.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"This restaurant is so close to the Best Western at Peel and Sherbrooke that we ended up eating here three times during our four night, three day stay. Breakfast combos are plentiful and gave us leftovers to snack on during the day between two adult meals and a kids meal with the baby eating whatever he wanted to try off our plates.Food was good (stuffed ravioli with chorizo and cream sauce was amazing), service was particularly excellent during the one dinner time (July 22), and 2/3 times, we used the adjacent office building lobby for our baby to run around. At our one breakfast, one family stored a large stroller behind our table with ample room to get around it, and at the other breakfast, the gentleman seating us expertly solved our booth/table desire dilemma (so we could secure our own booster seat to the chair but let our older son be comfortable), with a half booth/table, so this is a GREAT place for families. The only thing is that I didn't use the bathrooms so I can't vouch for a change table."
/user_details?userid=RmnLFQF7c-kbp4qQ8mIUgg,Gloria V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Really great atmosphere, even though the place was bustling with people we got seated very quickly since it is a spacious place. Ordered Eggs Benedict and it was my first time trying them. Enjoyed them quite a bit, soft and creamy which complimented the crispiness and dryness of the potatoes on the side. They gave a little bowl of fruit with my plate but unfortunately some of the fruit went to waste because I don't not like cantaloupe or melon. The service was good and polite, the only thing is that they forgot about our toast and we had to remind them for it 5 minutes after our food came. I would say it's a standard price point for brunch around $14+ for each plate,I wouldn't mind coming here again!"
/user_details?userid=WMK1j18ACm-EtopEznV4Rg,Jana T.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"We came here for a family birthday brunch as a large group on a Saturday.  One of the reasons I chose the place was that it takes reservations for big groups.  We had young children and elderly people so I didn't want people to have to wait in line.  Reservations are really recommended especially for weekends, as there was a lineup out the door when we got there.  Even having reserved, our table wasn't ready when we got there.  The hostess seemed stressed and snapped at us that she wouldn't seat our group until everyone was there (we had 10 out of 12 people there already).  It wasn't the best start to the meal, but 5 minutes later she relented and let us have the table.  Things improved after that, our server was very nice and even though the place was packed, service was friendly and fairly prompt under the circumstances.  The menu is extensive with all the usual brunch standards and prices were reasonable.  I had a smoothie and the healthy omelette.  The food was ok, everyone liked their meal. Decor was modern and attractive, restaurant was clean.  Only three stalls in the women's bathroom, resulting in a rather long wait.  A place this busy and this big could use a larger restroom.  Overall decent brunch place and a good place to go if you're a big group, just be sure to reserve ahead on a weekend."
/user_details?userid=MgLz-9maE-GP2ibMffx_eg,Dirk R.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"Came here for brunch and LOVED it. We sat outside in the sun and ordered two eggs, crepes and French Toast, with Café au lait and Mimosas. The food was ample and delicious. Service was prompt and friendly. Perfect experience. We will go back tomorrow!"
/user_details?userid=2Od6rQYNvPUXQC2Go7vIqg,Catherine W.,"Littleton, MA",4 star rating,"This is more 3.5 stars but rounding up due to friendly service. We went to this restaurant solely for convenience, being next to the Residence Inn where we stayed. They were very nice to our family including young children, which we appreciated. We had the fois gras torchon (room temperature, a spread format - I still prefer the hot preparations but just my taste), Montreal mussels and fries (tomato flavor), and kids' pizza. The food wasn't that memorable, but the staff provided very nice service and answered all our allergy questions thoroughly."
/user_details?userid=_tpzswb4NTS4bniz9aM1nQ,Phi N.,"Glenmont, MD",4 star rating,"I came here on two separate occasions. Salmon benedict and the fruit platter are excellent options. I didn't care much for the bread used for the benedict but since there was so much food, I ended up eating mainly just the salmon and egg. Potatoes and fruits came with the benedict-- the fruit was fresh and the potatoes were delicious.The fruit platter was good too. Large plate with a great variety of fruits. They were sweeter and smaller than what I'm used to, so probably organic. Plus, the strawberries were all a deep red; not overly large and white (You'll only know wth I'm talking about if you're from the states and eat the non-organic crap)The side of bacon was weak; flimsy thin cut slices. Definitely could do without that.... sucks because I love bacon!-Berry smoothie and the mimosas were both pretty tasty too-Cappuccino was no good-Had the same waitress both days; she was terrific-Restaurant gets packed for breakfast; there may be a little wait-Nice setup to the layout of the restaurant; they pay attention to a lot of little details"

Wait time can be long, but they take reservations, so take advantage of that.Food is decent, drinks are fine. The waitress did give us a free round of shots which was pretty cool considering how long it took to order drinks/food. This is essentially an IHOP that has a liquor license."

The food was truly delicious, we order the mushroom Benedict and the lox bagel. The Benedict came with fresh delicious fruit and the lox bagel came in a beautiful presentation but the bagel was a bit cold. This place was a little pricey but when you walk in you can definitely feel the high class vibes."

/user_details?userid=TrNYRbz0zr7kTsVFB4uw5w,Vanisha S.,"Oakville, Canada",2 star rating,We tried this place but overall so disappointing. Food is ok nothing great or wow. The outside terrace has such poor service. Our food arrived before our drinks and they pretended it was coming instead of saying we forgot. Waiters can make the difference. Here certain of them make the effort and some others really don't care. Inside the restaurant service seemed better looking through the glass
/user_details?userid=P_Em5lj5J0LT2_aspTQFxQ,Anh T.,"Calgary, Canada",4 star rating,"Perfect place for brunch. We ordered Florentine egg Benedict and Strawberry & custard crepe. The portion is huge and the food was delicious, well worth the price, combining with exceptional service. The crepe has the perfect sweetness, not overly sweetened like I had at other places."
/user_details?userid=jt49xjEjQisu6wTTGn6B3A,Annette J.,"Ann Arbor, MI",4 star rating,"A fine option for breakfast or lunch downtown. Huge menu of sandwiches, breakfasty goods like eggs/benedicts, waffles, crepes, etc. Plus tasty liquid refreshment like juices/smoothies, coffees, etc.I came on a Saturday afternoon and didn't have a wait at all, even though it was definitely pretty busy. Got a tasty juice of strawberries, mango, banana, yogurt, honey, and cranberries. So good! For my meal I went with the strawberry breakfast combo which was 2 eggs, potatoes, crepes with strawberries, and toast. Huge portions and a ton of variety for just $12. Those combos are totally the way to go if you want something sweet AND savory.  And everything was perfectly cooked and tasty. Service was quick and nice enough. The space is bright and light. It does get a bit loud when busy, so just an FYI. A woman in the party next to me was clearly very hungover and didn't seem too thrilled by the volume. Ha!"

When I went to McGill, I would go at least once a month either for breakfast, brunch, or lunch.The menu is HUGE! and every option that I have tried out has been delicious. The prices are fair and the service is pretty quick.If you are a larger group, think about making a reservation- otherwise you should be fine. Do no drive there: parking on Peel is a nightmare (just take the metro, it's literally right next door!)"

/user_details?userid=OLU59n7Q2bWDlEJA9VV3Aw,Shirley L.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"This is one of those places FOOD COMA will hit you. The waiters and waitresses were very flexible with speaking English and French. The atmosphere was quite nice and clean. Opinion of indoor seating or outdoor.  Great way to start the day with breakfast or brunch. I had their Classic Eggs benedict (2 poached eggs, ham, cheese on an English muffin) with the L'univers (Strawberries, banana, blueberries, melon, kiwi, honey and orange). The egg benedict seem very simple and not a large portion but it was actually very fulling. I love when restaurants serve fruits as a side with the meal, as full as you are some fruits won't hurt. The food came really quickly and the service was pretty good. Great for breakfast & brunch and the prices are affordable."
/user_details?userid=VFLmf0iImwfN4YEKargcxg,Ray L.,"Honolulu, HI",4 star rating,This was the first restaurant we tried after arriving late into Montreal late one evening.  The concierge at Omni Hotel provided us with some options and Universel was the first one and virtually right next door to the hotel.  Universel was so good that we went back twice during the week in Montreal.  The place has a combination of outdoor seating under a covered area and the indoor dining room.  Tables consist of smaller two seaters to comfy booth seating.  They have a good selection of many different food selections from sandwiches to seafood and the traditional steak frites.  I would recommend the moule with frites which is the mussels served in your choice of 4 different sauces and fries.  The serving is a huge heaping bowlful of juicy mussels and a basket of fries.  My only wish was that the fries are the thinner variety vs the freshcut which they serve. Desserts are decadent here and ordered the chocolate mousse cake and a side of vanilla ice cream.  The pricing is reasonable and even better converted to USD from CAD. Service is top notch here with friendly and careful attention by its servers.  We had the privilege of having Francis the first visit which was topped by Anabelle on our last visit.  She is the BEST!!

/user_details?userid=b9EOHQgkDuWP8WrM3cBzbw,Sarah L.,"Scarborough, Canada",5 star rating,"Walked into this beautiful establishment on our last day, we were sat in the patio after requesting to sit there. The waitress was very sweet and welcoming, giving us more than enough time to decide what we wanted for breakfast. My hubby ordered their Universel breakfast which consists one bagel toasted and halved, then topped with every single possible breakfast item you can think of. I ordered the Florentine Eggs Benedict :) we also got smoked salmon on the side. It was sooooooo filling, we both waddled out of there. Also, they offer extra condiments on the side, ketchup, mayo and Tabasco sauce were brought to the table upon us ordering. They checked on us quite often too, refilling our water whenever it was needed without us asking. Would definitely come back."

It wasn't too busy on the Sunday morning we had went (it was actually quite empty, which unnerved me initially), but that wasn't indicative of the quality of the food experience to follow! Two of us ordered omelettes, and the other ordered strawberry, banana, and hazelnut chocolate French toast. And don't be alarmed by the fruit juice prices; the glass is tall and easily serves two. Everything was wonderfully delicious, and the servings were generous, providing us just the energy we needed to hike up to the look-out spot. The service was okay; we had to really wave down our server when we needed to leave because we were on a tight schedule. Overall, I'd recommend it!"

Despite being quite crowded, our service was excellent and we got a great table on the covered/heated patio (this was in April!). I ordered the full breakfast complete with crepe, eggs, toast, fresh fruit, bacon, and potatoes. My girlfriend also enjoyed her eggs benedict. We will have to come back to try all the different varieties they offer. Fun note to Americans: many of the dishes come with ""creton"" ... try it! It's a pork and onion spread that tastes much better than it looks! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Montreal!"

When you go for the first time and you're satisfied it might be luck but when you go more than twice it's an evidence. Go! You won't regret it!"
/user_details?userid=7eKtHkxxWvI465WbDJj4dw,Michelle T.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here twice on my Montréal trip. The food is delicious and seasoned just right. Perhaps a tad too much salt on my home fries. The decor is big, bright, and happy, just what breakfast restaurants should be like! Their portions are huge. Seating is a bit squishy but totally doable. I got the 2 eggs, 3 bacon, 3 sausages thing which came with coffee/tea, fruits, and toast. All that for $11.95+tax! It was a sweet deal. Free refills for coffee and tea too. I'd definitely recommend coming here if you're in downtown Montréal. They are ridiculously busy in the morning throughout the week, but you can usually find a seat in 5 min.1 star deduction was for in I'm personable service by our server the second time we went. I think it's because his English wasn't that great."

It was a very busy Sunday morning and the restaurant seemed pretty full but we were seated right away. Waiters seemed to speak French and English fluently. We ordered a combo meal, two eggs meal, and universel breakfasts. We also started with lattes which were prepared well and delicious.My universel breakfast was HUGE; the portions are pretty crazy. The meal came with the crepe, the potatoes, two eggs, toast, choice of meat, baked beans, and fruit. This came out to be $18 Canadian dollars which is like $14 USD. Amazing deal especially for the cost.  For the crepe I added strawberries, bananas, and Nutella. The breakfast potatoes were seasoned very well. I don't typically like breakfast potatoes but I actually loved these. Service was great and we were attended to frequently. Great service, food, and experience!"

Our server was Angie. The service was quite bad and the wait staff could not be less remorseful about that. My sisters and moms coffee came easily 20 minutes after they ordered them. Food was timely but the wait staff was often no where to be found when we needed to ask for something or they would walk past us and blatantly ignore our calls ""excuse me"". When we finally asked for our bill, our server disappeared off and we had to ask a different man who worked there to bring it to us. When he did, we held our cool, paid, tipped. In the end, I simply and extremely respectfully informed him that we were appreciate of our server working hard to manage a busy restaurant but perhaps they could use an extra person so everyone wouldn't have to wait that long to be helped. He passive aggressively responded with ""good idea"" and ran away. He was clearly not happy with the feedback. Very immature."

The rest of us had luke warm to cold, making it impossible for tea.  When I asked for a refill of the hot water, it was still lukewarm.  Apparently tea is not a popular drink, or they would know that it's hot water we need (kettle anyone?).Our server was abrupt with us, and perhaps she already had a bad morning.  The food was a bit pricey for breakfast, and I guess I must have ordered the wrong thing... ham and eggs with potatoes were just ok.  Giving this 3 ""A OK"" stars.

We made a reservation ahead of time, and were able to accomodate our group no problem. I ordered the breakfast poutine, which consisted of a hollandaise sauce on a plate of breakfast potatoes, with sausage bits. The quality of the food was decent--on par with other brunch establishments--but not amazing. The portion was good and very filling. The food was deserving of a 3.5, but the service was what really took it up a notch. The waiters, despite the restaurant being packed, were attentive and fast. The kitchen was pushing out food at an incredible rate. I was pleasantly surprised that the coffee I ordered was included with the meal; I am so used to paying for brewed coffee that it was a nice way to finish my meal.

SERVICE: The waitress who waited on us was okay... it wasn't exceptional service and I am not sure if it's because of the day I visited (New Year's Day) or because it was just crazy busy. FOOD: Similarly, I wasn't blown away by the quality. I ordered a Western sandwich and it was okay... I could've made it at home. What they do not have in quality they definitely make up in the quantity which, if that is a good thing for you then you might find it good here. For my croissant sandwich they gave me potato ""fries"" + a few slices of fruit. My bf ordered the bacon eggs benedict and it was also decent. Too much hollondaise sauce though...but he also got potato ""fries"" + a bowl of fruit. I would say though that even though both those dishes weren't remarkable, their crepes were definitely good. We ordered the banana hazelnut chocolate one and it was GOOD. They did not skimp on the banana's or the hazelnut chocolate sauce. It was the best part of the meal, even my bf agreed. OVERALL: If you want some good crepes, definitely recommend. Otherwise, in terms of diner food it was okay... not the most mind blowing meal I've had in Montreal. But if you're in a pinch, this place is not bad :)"

I was surprised at how fast our meal came as we showed up at noon, got one of the last tables and were eating within 15 min of sitting down. I had the omelette with Swiss cheese and ham, potatoes, bread, fruit and tea. Everything was prepared well. Their home style potatoes were excellent. For $13.00 including coffee or tea it's a steal.Would happily go back and try other items on their large menu."

There was a sign at the door saying they cannot seat you until everyone has arrived. Granted it was very busy that day, so I respected this and sat at the door. Then I realized none of the servers would even look at me, which I found very rude. Had I not already told my friends to meet me here, I would've left immediately. Needless to say this restaurant gave me a terrible first impression. I also found the service after we were seated to be slow and disorganized. The second time I was here because another friend really likes this place. The food is quite good. The space is big so it's good for large groups because there isn't much of a wait time.

I hope that when the management read this review they'll take time to fix there ceilings.FOOD: The prices on the menu raised the level of my expectations. But I was quite disappointed of the way they cooked and handled our food. I've ordered Salmon and it was straight down oily. My girlfriend ordered a medium-well steak and 1/3 of the meat were undercooked and nearly raw.SERVICE: We weren't impressed by the service either. Our server told us the we were getting a basket of bread and later forgot. And what didn't make sense was that she removed the basket of jams/jellies on our table after she told us that we were getting bread. We had to ask her for the bread, and the jellies."

Unfortunately, I was the only one who left this restaurant extremely unsatisfied. The service is incompetent. There's one good server and everyone else is no good. One of the servers spilled my water all over our table, on me, and then all over my seat. I could sense that he was inexperienced and I also overheard him saying under his breath: ""well, this is off to a great start."" As much as I love sarcasm, I don't appreciate it much in these sorts of situations. He earnestly cleans the table and makes sure that the table isn't wet but forgets to wipe my chair which is wet and to bring me new utensils and a water glass as all those items got soaked. I then have to ask for a new glass of water and some extra napkins to clean up and make myself comfortable again. Fun.Okay, now the food. Two of my friends order the same dish as me. Our dish comes with a side of fruit. I noticed that my fruit bowl looks sparse in comparison to theirs. I realize I'm missing some apples, and normally I wouldn't mind but they already spilled water on me so I figure why not? I ask another server for some apple and he looks at me like I'm an asshole. He never comes back with the apple! Finally, I ask our main waitress and she does retrieve them - wow, was that so difficult? I dig into my food and it's barely warm. It was tasty but I'm pretty sure this dish was not supposed to be room temperature...unless Canadians just eat their Eggs Benedict that way. And so much for Eggs Benedict with poached eggs as my egg yolks were not runny."

I told her the way she said it was rude and she proceeded to stand there and stare at me to increase my tip.

I ordered one of the omelets and like previous reviews my meal was very dry. Both the omelet and potatoes were over cooked (extremely dry) my friends at the table also complained their stuff was too dry.

As another yelped said in their review, this place is very dinerish in the US sense, with huge menus from eggs, crepes, pizza, pasta, burgers etc. They serve breakfast till 3pm everyday, which is great for someone like me who loves eggs. I had the vegetable omelette (carrots, spinach, mushroom, onions, peppers) with goat cheese..it was very hearty and filling.

Eggs Benedict is the most common order and for good reason - it's done fairly well.Service: slow, mostly because it's always packed at brunch. There are always hoards of people waiting near the entrance which makes it cramped and painful to wait for a table. Even with a reservation, they won't seat your party of 9/10 until your 10th arrives which is annoying.Price: average brunch price. Not much to say here.Ambiance: loud and lively you could say.

/user_details?userid=o0ZxmXFhS7Dn1Hx5EebuxQ,Ahmed Z.,"Minneapolis, MN",2 star rating,"For the big hype around it, I wasn't very impressed with the food. We had the Mexican burrito, the salmon omelet, the chocolate and banana crepe and a single pancake with their chocolate hazelnut. Although every ingredient tasted good on its own, the overall flavor was very bland. A very good testament to that is their homemade breakfast potatoes. It is simple, soft and lightly seasoned. The salmon was very sharp and poignant and kinda cancels out all the flavors in the omelet. The crepe was okay with the wrong choice of chocolate. It was soft on the inside and a little crispy on the edges if you love your crepes that way. The only thing I would stay clear of is the pancakes. It was a bit tasteless.  The turnoff of the place is their chocolate. Their hazelnut chocolate is very out of proportion. Not enough milk but lot f hazelnut with what I assume is a very high percentage of dark chocolate. It is an okay place If you are living around the area and don't want to go to Griffintown but there is definitely better places in Montreal to have breakfast."

The space is pretty large with a lot of indoor and outdoor seating; when there is a line to be seated and the place is packed, well that's a sign the food must be good. The service was a little slow due to not enough servers. I enjoyed my eggs benedict I just wish it was hot and not just warm, it was fine I ate the whole thing. I also enjoyed their iced mochachino. On my second morning stop in the line and wait time was even longer than the day before. No one gave up on waiting and neither did we. We had a plan of what we wanted to order and we had a plan on stuffing our faces with two huge breakfasts we could share. This time we ordered waffles with bananas and strawberries; an order of eggs benedict florentine and a side of bacon (see photos). I'm glad we came back and waited, their waffles are out of this world amazing. We added their maple syrup which is delicious and it was just the perfect topping.

It was extremely bland.The Escargot Au Gratin was not the best, but also not the worst. I definitely had better. It looks like they just put the cheese on top of the Escargot and microwave it.The Roast Beef Sandwich was not what I expected. I guess I was expecting more of a deli style roast beef, but that did not happen. The beef was in chunks and over cooked. It comes with brie cheese with tomatoes and lettuce.

The dish was overly salty and they must've forgot if they were putting cooked salmon or smoked salmon, so it had both. After about 10 minutes I was sick to my stomach. The cooked salmon did not sit well as it was undercooked. I dined with my family, they all agreed their meals could've been done better. It's unfortunate, the place had a beautiful interior and the service was pretty quick on a busy night."

We were staying nearby and it looked busy so we thought that was a good sign. the tables are very close together so there isn't much room to move. We were seated in a corner beside a group of 6 young men. They were rowdy and frankly smelt bad. One kept getting up, and every time I got his backside in my face, and one time literally on my breakfast. Nice. When this group left we got another group of college kids who seemed to have been out drinking all night. One sneezed all over my breakfast, then spent the rest of his time loudly blowing his nose staring in his used tissue groaning then blowing his nose again. His friends mostly ignored him while complaining about their parents calling them. Our companions meant I was eager to leave and not eager to eat, which was no problem as the food is nothing special- think IHOP (in this case with extra germs)."

Then I went back the next morning and sat at the bar. A roach crawled out from some menus and I promptly pointed it out to a waiter who smashed it. He called the head guy in charge who picked it up with a napkin and that's it. No one cleaned the bar top where the roach was crawling. Yes this place was busy at the time, but if they don't clean up in view of where a customer saw a roach, imagine what they do back in the kitchen!"

If you happen to go there during happy hours and want to order some appetizers, just go with the nachos (big portions and oh oh so yummy).

While the food is not exactly terrible, it is barely okay and definitely too pricey for what it is.My husband and I went visited Universel on a Tuesday evening during ""Happy Hour"" (4-7PM), which allows for two drinks for the price of one, a very nice touch and probably the only redeeming part of the experience, alongside the waiter's mostly genuine but strained smile. I had a veggie pizza which turned out to be as unmemorable as any other cheap pizza place (except I would probably pay less for it elsewhere - heck, even pizzapizza is tastier!). He had a vegetarian souvlaki which was first served to him with chicken, until we went to the counter to point out there had been a mistake with our order. Five minutes later, the right plate was brought from the kitchen; much better, but still very ""okay"" taste-wise.The sangria was good enough, and so was the house red wine, especially with the 2 for 1 promotion. The place looks nice... And that's pretty much it. Unexciting experience. I can think of many better places to spend my money at in Montreal's vibrant restaurant scene. We will not go back."

I liked the wide variety of eggs Benedict and omelets offered on the menu and it took me a while to decide. I ended up having the smoked salmon benedict, which also came with a cup of fresh fruit and home fries. Everything was really good--the salmon wasn't too fishy, and the home fries were really well-seasoned. All in all, this was a great start to the morning--we didn't have to wait for a table, the service was fast, and we ate our fill before heading off to start the day's adventure."

But we loved it so much the first time, we decided to stop in again 2 days later!On our first visit, we had a very late lunch after driving down from Mont Tremblant. They've got a very large menu with so many diverse choices. I opted for the Tortellini Gigi with 3 cheeses as it sounded quite hearty. It ended up being a great choice! Stuffed with 3 cheeses and soaked in a creamy tomato sauce and topped with mushrooms, every bite was oh so good!On the second visit, we stopped in for a late breakfast. I was torn between sweet and hearty as I wanted the energy of protein but sweet things like french toast and crepes were calling my name. I read up and down the crepe options and saw a few with protein. I opted for the bacon, apple, and cheddar crepes which quite honestly seemed like an odd combination. The crepes came out a tad on the thick side but it didn't matter because they were so good. The cheddar, apple, and bacon combination was delicious! I scarfed every bit down!Service was friendly on both visits and the warm atmosphere was a nice break from the cold. The decor is hip and contemporary with lots of green, mirrored surfaces, and large booths. It's a great place to host a large group with plentiful space. The great reviews bestowed upon Universel are well deserved. It was a huge hit for us.....twice! It's must do, at least once, on your Montreal visit."

I have nothing to say about anything - the food was great and my friends left satiated and satisfied. We definitely plan to go back.

Our server asked if our food was good on her way by and then we were done for minutes before she offered to bring us the check. At that point they had another small rush and all servers and the busser seemed to be stressed out scrambling to catch up. We began to feel their stress and wanted to leave but our server had forgotten our check and was too hard to track down.

The indoor space is very sunny too (on a sunny day of course). The place was clean and looked upscale. The menu was very extensive and since there were four of us, we did end up trying different things. Friend No.1 had the Mexican Breakfast which I did not try but he said it was good not great. Friend No.2 had Eggs Benedict which she said was really good. Mr. H had a veggie omelette and that was yumm. He also tried L'éternité a fruit smoothie with strawberries, banana, mango, yogurt and honey, this was really good. I on the other had tried the Universal Breakfast, its a huge breakfast with french toast, home fries, sausage, tuna, fruits and scrambled eggs (it comes with coffee too). I also tried a smoothie called L'univers which was ok. All in all I thought the food was good but nothing made me go 'omg! this is so tasty'.

A massive pile and served with the usual frites, I ate every one and then poured the left over frites into the sauce. Really excellent.My friend had the steak he's been wanting for a few days and enjoyed it with a glass of their house red wine. While it was cooked a little longer than he wanted, he was still quite pleased with it.Service was decent. It was a good meal in a nice restaurant and the price was okay. Was it the best? No. Was it good? Yes. Would I return? Probably yes."

We arrived half an hour late to or reservations and despite telling us we would have to wait in line we were surprised to only wait 5 minutes or so for a table for six.This was one of the best brunch places I've been to in years. The prices were slightly higher than I would've liked but quality of homemade comfort breakfast food was phenomenal. Make sure to order dishes with a cup of fruit or get an add on because everything was super sweet and fresh. The orange juice wasn't worth it. But the rest of the food was amazing. I ordered a smoked salmon eggs benedict which came with a cup of fruit and potatoes. The potatoes were awesome, perfectly fried to a crispy exterior with a soft interior. The hollandaise sauce was tasty but subtle and the poached eggs were perfectly done.Friends got universal breakfast which was well worth it and even without a cup of fruit had some fruit to munch on on the side. Everything was just done to perfection and as one of the few places that takes reservations this is a must go."

I've tried their brunches (eggs benedicts) before as well as their lunches (mussels) and I must say its just very very plain and ordinary and for the price you are paying ($15-20), there are so much more better options out there.

The classic French American blend of good made it the perfect place to go for breakfast food first. I the classic strawberry and hazelnut chocolate crepe... hard to go wrong with that. Then I had sausages and 2 eggs to combine with them. The crepe was the perfect texture with the correct strawberry to Nutella ratio. Lastly the sausages were extremely juicy and fell apart in my mouth along with the perfectly cooked eggs. I will be coming back soon!

The execution is well done and the array of choices is very fun. This juxtaposition of contrasting styles and elements works surprisingly well for me. As a big dumb Murican, I felt the need to try the classic Poutine. While I thought the flavors were great, the dish overall just wasn't working for me personally. Something about soggy fries just doesn't sit will with me. The reason I gave this place 5 stars was because the Chicken Wrap that Jess got was the best I have ever eaten.

We find a restaurant that catches our attention 11 minutes from where we are staying and begin our trek in the snow storm. Wet and cold we arrive and are blown away by the gem we found. Quaint and sophisticated, Universel is not your boring breakfast spot. House music plays in the background, MuchVibe on the TVs and the decor is mix of retro chic, and modern. The breakfast menu is HUGE, service is amazing, and the food came out in less than 10 minutes (which is good cause we were starving).All in all amazing breakfast vibe.I would make this my regular spot if I lived here.Prices are a little higher than a Cora's but well worth the price.

I got the smoked salmon eggs benny and the yolk was perfect but I could barely taste the salmon.  The fruits wasn't sour but the eggs were lukewarm and there wasn't anything particulary outstanding about it.

One thing that was really good that came with most orders is the fruit bowl on the side. It comes with an array of fresh fruits and goes along quite well with the main course! Compared to other breakfast restaurants that only give you 1-3 pieces of fruit. The fruit bowl contains plenty of fruits to give you a healthy start for your day.On weekends, come early or expect to wait in line. Call ahead to make a reservation for bigger parties.I also enjoyed the clean atmosphere and decors of the location but the seats are built a bit close to each other.

Thank to Yelp, I found this place nearby with lots of great reviews! I can see why. If I was a student at McGill, I feel I'd be coming here for brunch quite a bit! The restaurant was quite busy, and we did not have to wait in line so long. Probably because people were leaving at the time we arrived.

There's nothing inherently 'Montreal' about it, the crepes are average and can only be ordered until 5pm, I think, which is when they stop serving their breakfast menu.

Only three other guests were there. My server was great. However, when I got my Eggs Benedict,  the yoke was completely cooked. When I asked another server if they could redo the order because my egg yoke was cooked, she asked ""do you want them runny?"" I was kind of surprised at this question since having a runny yoke is how it is supposed to be prepared! Anyway, I decided to give them another try. Oddly, they always seem to disappoint more as time passes. I'm not giving them another try again!"

The French toast and home fries were very good. My crepes were good too a little heavy though. Service is great except I had to flag down my waiter to ask for an item they forgot but forgivable bc this place here crazy busy. Otherwise all the waitstaff was excellent.

/user_details?userid=NHgGSY6dOcoD49zb1Ekn9g,David G.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Dear Universel Déjeuner & Grillades - Peel management, First and foremost, BRAVO!I wanted to sincerely thank you for abruptly cancelling my wife's surprise bday party reservation for 25 people at 11:30 when everyone had all already arrived, leaving a 6month pregnant customer and a 6month enfant unseated left freezing in the rain outside,  because you felt you could monitize Sunday brunch better with small groups of people. I congratulate you for letting corporate greed blind you from what the restaurant business values most, customer service and common human decency.Thankfully, my group and I were screaming surprise to my wife at exactly noon at pizzeria n900 just next door who were kind enough to accommodate on such short notice. (Refer to my review) I furthermore wanted to thank you for being so rude to one of my friends who's six months pregnant who you wouldn't allow to sit at any table until the group arrived.I furthermore thank you for doing the same to another attending couple who carried a 6 month old enfant, left standing and waiting in the rain.My friends have had enough at that point and redirected everyone to pizzeria n900 right next door, with my wife and I arriving just in time for the bday surprise at noon.I fail to see how such treatment of large group reservations seems at all appropriate, or at all good for PR in a day and age when reviews make or break a restaurant.It pains me to write this because the cooking staff, and the waiting staff are apparently renowned for great food and great service.Sad to see how the incompetency of management overshadows an apparently great restaurant.Advice for anyone who's looking not to have their appetite ruined for a Sunday brunch, don't bother making reservations (they're worthless). Just go to pizzeria n900, they are as down to earth as people get, and actually do some impressive work, such as a breakfast pizza, for a living, unlike universel management.For universel management, seek professional help, there's hospitality courses you can surely take. Regards, David Goldbaum, MBA"

But what was unexpected, was that we were seated almost immediately. Seating is cozy yet comfortable. You're quite close to your neighbours however, the atmosphere makes the closeness almost forgotten. Table was adorned with all the necessities for a perfect coffee and all the condiments for a perfectly seasoned meal. The ambiance is quite trendy here. Plastic chandeliers adorn the ceiling, textured green wall paper lines the walls and green velvet covers the booth seating. It's a very 'hip' place to walk into. It took a little longer than average to be greeted by our server, however it did not bother me. It's a busy place but seems very well managed. The server was very nice and seemed genuinely interested in our morning. Our order was taken promptly, our coffees served and our water glasses refilled. The meal came VERY quickly! I'm talking less than 7 minutes quickly. But! Nothing about my plate looked rushed. The meal (combination eggs benedict) was well prepared: eggs benedict cooked perfectly to my liking, potatoes browned to perfection and a fruit bowl so appealing I had to eat it first! My coffee was refilled over breakfast, my water refilled multiple times and the server did pay attention to our needs. Overall, this was a wonderful experience... Now, if you'll excuse me...

My friend got the universal breakfast that came with 2 eggs, 2 large crepes, potatoes, bacon, beans, some weird pate of some sort and bread. She also got a waffle. That and orange juice totaled about $36. The hollandaise sauce on my benefit was pretty plain so I did use a lot of salt, and my friend said her crepes were too rubbery and heavy. Even though the food was okay, I would definitely come back and try something else on their menu. Our waitress was very nice and the place was very busy with a fun, modern feel."

My meal came with a vegetable puree soup, lacked salt and any real flavor, but it was passable.The Bad: The calamari were something you would get out of a frozen box. The Nachos burnt, and when I left my seat for about 15 minutes to go chat with co-workers at the other end of the table, the other half of my sandwich was taken away.  The waitress didn't even ask anyone if I was done, or bothered to see if I was around to ask if I was done or if I wanted it to be boxed to go.Though the sandwich was not toooo expensive, I ended up paying 20 bucks for half a sandwich. In any other circumstances I would have said something or not left a tip but it is the holidays and she did have 18 other people to tend to. So, I let it go.Would I go back again?

If you could imagine a sticky black cement floor this was it. Consequently, bees flew around our meals more so than other places we ate at.

The smoothies are also delicious.We were a party of 8 that showed up on a Sunday without a reservation. At first, there was hesitance about whether they would be able to seat is anytime soon but somehow they managed to give us conjoined tables after only a wait of 5 minutes. It was busy but all of our food came within 20 minutes after we ordered."

Universel was a short walk from our downtown hotel and seemed like a great choice for brunch and it did not disappoint. We were seated immediately after arrival on the covered heated patio. I had the Universel breakfast with crepes, scrambled eggs, three meats (bacon, ham, sausage) it also comes with home fries and a few pieces of fruit. My partner had the French toast. The food was great! The home fries were perfectly seasoned. The mimosas were delicious, perfect blend of orange juice and champagne, after the second one I could feel it (I drink for the taste and feeling lol). The service was great. The food came out fairly quickly and the waiter was attentive. The music was upbeat and fitting for a brunch atmosphere. We will visit this restaurant every time we come to Montreal. I would recommend Universel, you won't be disappointed."

Fuck off.Food wise ...Well it's not bad and the plate is full for a reasonable price, my breakfast Burrito was ok, but that's the thing : I had way better in places not so packed.

I got the bacon eggs Benedict. It wasn't the best I have ever had but the hollandaise sauce is very good, so I can see why people rave about it. My eggs were over-cooked, though, so I didn't get the nice runny yolks I was hoping for. The accompanying fruit was also not fresh. While service was quick, I felt that it was mainly to turn over the table. I definitely felt rushed and did not get the relaxing brunch I was hoping for."

The cheese wasnt even melted....The salmon eggs beni was salty and terrible....This probably is a tourist spot, music is loud, decor is nice, its in the city.....if i lived in montreal i would never go here...."

Menu was vast and they even have a kids menu. Prices aren't bad considering the portions. Atmosphere is cool especially with the patio door open during the summer time. I had the universel breakfast with crepes and it was yummy including the beans! Kids loved their meals as well. Service wasn't bad considering how busy they were. I would definitely come back here.

The interior is very nice and the staff was also very nice! I ordered the universal breakfast and it was delicious and very filling. I ended up taking it home because you are given a lot of food. The food came in a decent amount of time and as soon as it came we all started eating before anyone could even snap a picture of the meal. I would recommend this place to everybody!

It is NOT cheap, it's mass produced food, supermarket white bread, fake maple syrup and stale yellow sliced cheese that they call 'cheddar' but you will weep if you taste it.

Asked what was gluten-free on the menu as per the Yelp tags saying it catered to gluten-free customers. Waitress snarled and said in response: ""it's whatever on the menu doesn't have gluten so just read it."" Had to ask another waitress who bless her soul helped us navigate the menu. Our waitress didn't come around again to see how the meal was going - had to go up to her and ask for a further side which would've been fine if it weren't with attitude. At the end of the meal, we decided we weren't happy with the service and tipped only 10% and after we had paid she returned and said: ""just letting you know if you're staying in Canada a while you have to tip on top of your meal thanks."" And stormed off. What a joke - ruined decent food."

/user_details?userid=lPqIwC1QWXq7OY0sm-Vc9A,Shadoe H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"You're in the hottest club in Montreal and it's a little past 3. Music and people fight for your attention and maybe you've lost track of time. Or maybe you're hanging on, fogged by a drink too many, to the hopes you won't have to go home alone. But the club's gotten your money and has tired of you, and let's you know by the sudden silence and the blinding brightness of the lights turning on for the first time. As your eyes struggle to adjust, you start wondering wether the underlit atmosphere was intended for seduction or rather as a cover up for the slough of sugared alcohol across the scuffed surface of the dance floor. Or to veil the stained and threadbare bar stools you sat on sipping on your twenty dollar cocktails? The seduction, if there was any, was to distract from how much you'd be willing to spend in a mostly empty warehouse space furnished with plastic furniture with ""final sale"" labels still stuck on them. But now what if instead of showing you the door, the club offers you a seat at one of these plastic tables and graciously serves you hot coffee, salty scrambled eggs, and charred crisp bacon?Welcome to Universel Déjeuner & Grillades I'll forever question the plexiglass and lime coloured, 'here comes Y2K' late 90's lounge decor, but undeniably the place is dedicated to fast, affordable, and satisfying breakfast. I want to snark about Crescent street vampires deserving breakfast too but I'll refrain. Because we are on Peel street right now.   The menu is standard breakfast diner fare made with effort: omelettes, eggs + meat combos, and various Benedicts. I mention the effort because while despite appearing pedestrian originality-wise, almost all big breakfast chains in the downtown area serving similar options seem to have been deflated by curated brunch spots and at this point deserve applause for managing to find a link between sliced bread and a toaster. L'Universel can not only manage toast, but they offer pumpernickel at no extra charge too. Effort shows up in other ways. The beverage runners have a sixth sense about when your coffee's meniscus drops below two-thirds, always arriving no later to offer yet another refill. Waiters dance on a line somewhere between chatty friendly-ness and robotic efficiency I never knew existed. Every step of the restaurant/client process is timely without ever making you feel rushed. There's free WiFi. There's a giant plexiglass windowed wine rack. Don't fooled by the dimly lit pictures uploaded here, but otherwise thumbs-up emoji. Universel Déjeuner & Grillades is an ersatz club with real breakfast chops."

Don't forget to have a smoothy with your meal (although you may want to split it with someone). Decided to try out the breakfast burrito and was unimpressed with the fillings. The beans tasted like baked beans from a can and the guacamole was average.
/user_details?userid=Ne9sOws_EDlDASo7ckE29g,Derek L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This restaurant does exactly what it's meant to do. Feed you a monster breakfast when the craving arises... Or cure a hangover.I had the universel breakfast with three meats and bananas on my french toast. The breakfast was exactly what I needed to hit the spot. The ham was very tasty considering it is usually overshadowed by it's other two breakfast meat counterparts. The bacon and sausage was great, but really, how can anyone screw those up? Eggs were yolky and ready to be soaked up by my toast. The only thing that fell short was the french toast. It didn't have a great texture and it just seemed like more of a filler than a defining part of the meal. My girlfriend had the eggs benedict with sautéed mushrooms and goat cheese. She said it was very tasty, but as eggs benedict lovers, we've had better. A cool thing they do is offer a pitcher of orange juice for large groups. Seems very simple, but I haven't seen to many places do this.The place is really crowded. You really feel like your sitting with the people next to you. This doesn't seen to matter since everyone is wrapped up in their own world; talking about whatever happened the night before. Place has a nice modern look to it and offers seating on their outside terrace which is nice in the summer months.Staff was very nice and service was very quick considering how many people there were.

It came out loaded with hollandaise sauce, with some fresh fruit and house fries (see posted pictures from other users). I crushed all of it, while my girlfriend only had half of her eggs bene with salmon and spinach - not because of taste, but rather it was so filling. Recommended!"

I noticed that was a common theme in Montreal though. Everything was pretty standard. Nothing stood out either as being above the pack. My only complaint is that their breakfast sausage is very bland for breakfast sausage. It was greasy and fatty but still bland somehow. Other than that, the food wasn't bad.

My sandwich was delicious and made the perfect lunch. My friend had a brie an mushroom omelette and said it was good also. After our meals we ordered a small chai and an iced mochachino... both very good and definitely hit the spot. We sat in a covered outdoor porch with a few other people so I believe our waitress forgot we were there at times, she took a long time to appear after we were finished our meal and wanted to order some drinks. For lunch time when everyone is on a schedule she should have been more efficient.

Don't expect your table or menus to be clean, and you can forget substituting or altering your order in any way - seeing as they will blatantly ignore your request. As if finding a bee carcus in my coffee wasn't enough to make sure this was a one time visit, the waitor actually requested that my friend tip higher ... Holding us all up and leaving me feeling as bitter as the unripe melons i was given as a poor excuse for fruit. 4/10 wouldn't recommend."

I love that there is covered outdoor seating and that's where we chose to sit - I didn't visit the interior but I'm guessing that it's also welcoming and comfortable. We had a pretty standard breakfast of eggs, bacon, egg sandwich, pancakes and french toast. I think everything was very decent but not remarkable. They were very busy on this Friday morning and I don't know if maybe they don't do refills on coffee, but I sure could have used that myself. I also would have loved to have my egg sandwich on a croissant or something - my brown bread was somewhat dry/stale. Very serviceable, however, and again, very convenient if you're downtown."

I got the bacon eggs Benedict and I'd have to say it was probably one of the best I've ever had... the hollandaise sauce is very good. Fairly large portions with fresh fruit as well as home fries that were good and not too greasy. Overall I'd say it was above average and I would definitely consider going back during my next visit to Montreal."

Came here with the boyfriend and ordered the 1 egg with bacon and he ordered an egg, sausage, and cheese sandwich and a bloody caesar. The bloody caesar was interesting - for those of you who don't know, a bloody caesar is made with clamato juice rather than regular tomato so it has a briny taste to it. I'm not really sure if it's made well here since it's the first time I've ever had it, but my boyfriend seemed to like it. Both food orders came with yummy home fries and fresh fruit. I accidentally ordered a side of cheese (I thought my meal came with it but read carefully - it says OR) so be sure to pay attention to the menu. Everything was delicious and the service was good. If you're meal doesn't come with the home fries then you should definitely order a side of em - they were some of the best home fries I've ever had."

I needed to organize a work lunch for thirty or so people ... on a couple of day's notice! Universal to the rescue! Afterwards I received many positive comments on the choice, it seemed there really was something for everyone. I liked the fact that one can choose between breakfast OR lunch and dinner. I had the Mexican breakfast and was very happy with my choice: two burritos (actually more like enchiladas, but hey, this isn't a Mexican restaurant so who really cares) filled with scrabbled eggs, beans and cheese, topped with cheese (not a gross excessive amount though, just enough), guacamole and salsa, and served with home fries and fruit (an actual little bowl of fruit, not the couple of sad pieces of fruit some places serve). My only complaint is that the place is packed and loud.  But that's to be expected when the food is decent and the people happy. The staff had no problem managing so many people, and that's what counts."

/user_details?userid=lKRbcLWDQmOmhcMa3vMCMA,Emily F.,"Saint-Jérôme, Canada",3 star rating,"My Hubby & I have been to this restaurant twice. We like it but we've also had our issues. Our first experience wasn't bad, we went for lunch on a Friday. It was busy and we had to wait for our meals for a while, but it was okay.Our second visit on a Thursday for dinner was interesting. Our waiter was super cool but here's what happened. Essentially, our cool waiter took our order. We asked for an appetizer, a House salad, and the main meal. The waiter asked us if we wanted the appetizer & salad together or separate (ie. wait 10-15 minutes before bringing the second course). We specifically asked that they be brought separately. So, after some time the waiter brought us the appetizer. Then, like 5 minutes later, another guy brings us our salads! We're both like ""Well ok, but that was quick...."". We had barely started on the appetizer! The guy, who later turned to be the Manager, said he'll hold our main courses. Ok, that seemed fine, only that from finishing our salads to receiving the main course passed 40 minutes. My Husband went to the bar and spoke to someone about it and at that point we still didn't have our main course. It was around this time that we both started losing our appetite completely. Finally, we got our meals and the Manager (the guy who brought our salads prematurely), came to the table to talk to us. In the end we were compensated for the error, but my Husband's steak was not cooked right either. He asked for Medium-Rare and the steak was clearly Well-Done and too dry. We think the Manager, with the good intention of trying to help, failed to communicate with our waiter who actually took our orders. The waiter knew that we wanted the courses to be spread out, but we saw the Manager bringing out not only our salads but other people's orders as well... The same thing might have happened to another table because he was serving too quickly. We're not sure if we will return. We still tipped our waiter fairly because it wasn't really his fault and as I said above, he was very cool."

When the waiter came over to ask us if we were ready (in French) I could sense his annoyance with the fact that we did not speak French. His annoyance became apparent when he ignored us to tend to another table(French speakers) which was seated after us. He brought them all their coffee while forgetting about the drinks we ordered. I had to ask the person who brought me my food if I could have my coffee and my daughter could have her chocolate milk. We didn't see the waiter again until he brought me my bill.  I would not recommend this place and in fact would send you over to Ben and Florentine one block over.

/user_details?userid=j40UpbBw5eRzgXM6-naTGg,William M.,"Leominster, MA",5 star rating,"This was one of, if not the best, eggs benedict I've ever had. I travel a lot for my company and always treat myself to eggs benny. The version I got here was called the Billy Goat which had goat cheese, spinach, capers, and salmon. It was delicious. The homefries were great as well in terms of taste and crispiness, albeit a little salty. The eggs also came with a nice plate of fresh fruit.The staff was friendly and courteous even though my French is atrocious, haha. They came over several times refilling coffee and water.The booth I sat in was huge and comfy with a great view of both the televisions inside and the street outside. What a nice place to eat breakfast while traveling."

With that said, they got us in right away and hustled to get everyone served quickly. We sat in an outdoor area which was covered, so it was warm. The food was good and serving size was massive. I ordered eggs Benedict and held the cheese, but added mushrooms. Yum!! It was served with some delicious breakfast fries and a huge bowl of fruit. The one downfall was the eggs were cooked all the way through, so there was no runny yolk. I'm not a local, so maybe that's how this dish would be served throughout the region?!? Regardless, you should check this place out!"

It is by no means a favourite of mine, but definitely not bad either. There's nothing particularly special about this place and the food is just in the 'fine' range, but the place itself looks nice and is never quite empty so it offers a decent ambiance, a reasonable price, and is within proximity to everything downtown. So it's okay, I guess, meh."

They have so many breakfast options and so many different combination plates to choose from. I always love a breakfast places that can give you plates with many different types of food on them! The price was reasonable and we enjoyed all of the food here! There's lots of seating inside and outside so you shouldn't need a reservation (it was 10-11 when we showed up and they took us right away). The service was great too!

Kids meal was large, crepes were good. And, of course, being in Quebec, real maple syrup was served."
/user_details?userid=ozFgdgtNYT4_L2kkPJUCLw,Lawrence G.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"Overall standard Montreal breakfast fare, though delicious standard Montreal breakfast fare, served in a restaurant that straddles a diner atmosphere and a more upscale brunch establishment.  I ordered the eggs Benedict, whereas my girlfriend ordered the banana-strawberry-chocolate crêpe.    Savory hollandaise sauce, crispy English muffins, tasty ham, and good potatoes, as well as a (generous) bowl of fruit will greet (and satiate) the hungriest of breakfasters.   Now the crêpe clearly was modeled after the Leviathan, swimming in a sea of copious chocolate.  The dough of the crêpe itself straddles that of a Russian blintze and an American pancake, so there is definitely substance in there.  And one word of caution:  the banana-strawberry crêpe is served with a decent drizzling of chocolate, which is probably enough - order the banana-strawberry-chocolate crêpe only if you have a serious craving for chocolate.  As to the service, we were seated immediately, and though the establishment was (admitted by the waitress) understaffed, she smiled and mentioned that she would cover our table as well.  Overall, no delays, food arrived quickly - great breakfast experience."

I have never (and I mean never) experienced anything close to what his experience was like at Universel. In fact, I love this restaurant for breakfast. And lets not kid ourselves folks this is the main attraction: breakfast/brunch. The lunch menu is good but the star of the show--all Montrealais who frequent this place already know this--is breakfast. Its so CHEAP and SO GOOD. I usually get the two eggs with bacon order which comes with hash browns (chunky seasoned potatoes) with fresh fruit and toast (four pieces) and free coffee. I believe its $5.95 ... uh, yea. CHEAP, let me emphasize that. Unlimited coffee refills too. I have also had the eggs benedict which are also super fantastic. They are a little pricer but worth it: huge serving, unreal Hollandaise sauce, and many different options (smoked salmon, asparagus, etc.) A lot of people opt for the eggs benny. And the service is fast. I've never waited more than 10 minutes to get my food, and really it shouldn't take much longer than that for  bacon an eggs. But do be patient because this place gets hopping on the weekends. This my go to place when I'm hungover from a night out on the town in Montreal. Like any good Canadian I go to soak up the alcohol with some greasy goodness. The staff know the routine on Saturday mornings and are quick to offer you coffee, which is much appreciated. If you can: opt for a banquette seat which are comfy for those in your group who can sang one of the booth seats (love those!). There is sometimes a wait--not usually more than 5 minutes--but there is a nearly year-round heated (and they really mean heated) patio. Its nice to sit outside in the summer, and in the fall you really are not effected by the chill. So if you're a tourist: this is the go-to place to nurse that hang-over or if you're from Montreal make use of this little gem to get all the bacon and eggs you could ever want. Also the decor is much, much better than your typical diner. They modernized rather recently and the design is ultra-chic :) Popular with McGill students too. Check it out."

/user_details?userid=vN0kR_uhcauVxUitHbM3Uw,Julian N.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Canada",1 star rating,"Avoid this restaurant.We went for dinner (haven't tried breakfast) with friends last night and the service, although polite, was slow and made mistakes (wrong dishes brought out) draught beer wasn't working, happy hour only included the cheapest/worst drinks, two plates of moules/mussels did not smell (or really even taste) fresh, and the key ingredients in my dish (garlic and cognac) were no where to be tasted, suggesting either cheap ingredients or a kitchen that skimps. The, I believe ""homemade"", fries that came with my mussels smacked of frozen pre-cut potatoes, although the frying oil seemed to be fresh.A friend's shrimp provencale smelled odd and were tough, yet she said they were better than another friend's fried calamari that she had tasted. The sangria was watery, and to boot, the bill came out to over $30 per person (which would have been acceptable had the food, drinks, and service been much better than they were).We all left wondering how this place is still open, and we don't plan on returning. There are much better places to eat in the area, and across Montreal in general.As others have mentioned in their reviews, the location is nice and the decor appealing. The restaurant is clean and so are the bathrooms."

/user_details?userid=30EBZHPtdOymgLNU7-9BOA,Cameron H.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Once before I had joined a potential employer at Universel for an interview over breakfast, and decide I wanted to try breakfast here again on my own.When I arrived at the door, I waited almost 3 to 4 minutes for someone to greet me, several servers had passed without so much as a ""Hi"" or ""Someone will be right with you"".  Finally, I was shown to a table on the front terrace.I think it's important to note that the restaurant did not seem that busy.  I noticed 5 or 6 occupied tables on the inside, and there was only one other table on the terrace with a party of one, with plenty of staff on the floor.Once I was seated, there was no server in sight for almost ten minutes; no one came out to offer coffee, a beverage, or to take my ordered.  I also noticed that no one was checking on the one other table either.  There was a bus boy, who completely ignored the fact there was a new table, and didn't bother notifying a server. It appears that neither did the hostess.After waiting nearly 10 minutes, a server finally came to my table to take my order.  I order a simple 2 eggs, bacon and sausage, coffee, and OJ breakfast.  A couple of minutes later, another table of one arrived, and were seated at the table in front of me.  A different server promptly took his order.  A couple of other tables arrived in the meantime as well.After what seemed like an a long time after ordering, I still have not been served my simple breakfast, the gentleman that arrived after me was served his breakfast, and then a table that arrived after him was also served their breakfast.  At this point, I was about to stand to find out what was going on, and the server come out with my order.  She served the breakfast, but had forgotten the toast, as here MO was not to be available; I had to ask the hostess for the toast.As for the food, it was good, everything was cooked perfectly, and satisfied my hunger for a full breakfast, but it was not so exceptional to make it worth the wait for 2 eggs, bacon and sausage, coffee, and OJ.When I finished eating, the server was of course prompt with the bill, the only thing that was promptly delivered the entire experience.  Then, again I was waiting to pay the bill, at this point I was impatient, and eventually had to get up and go to hostess station, where the manager had to give me the change for my bill. I quickly mentioned to the manager about my experience, but he did not seem to care much, so I dropped it and left."

I came for dinner, and was quickly seated. The decor is nice, and the restaurant kept very clean. A waitress came to me in a timely fashion, and I ordered the seafood fettuccine. My Caesar Salad came minutes after I had made my order. The salad was nice. Croutons were homemade and not too much dressing (as experienced in other places). Minutes after I had finished my salad, my pasta came out piping hot. Sauce was delicious (slightly messy, but that was my fault), and there was ample amounts of seafood (includes shrimp, scallops, clams, and mussels). Pasta was slightly overcooked, but no huge complaints. The price is fair for what I got. Overall, good service, good food, fair price. A great place to hangout after work in the downtown area."

With that said, the food was delicious. I had the Universel for lunch which is a perfectly poached egg, bacon on a bagel. that came with home fries and a side of fruit.

I asked the waiteress if I could change it, but she never came back and confirmed I could get the chicken gyro.  That took another 25 minutes!! Really, 25 minutes to make a GYRO sandwich, hahaha.....They knew they were wrong b/c they gave us 10% off of the original bill.  Never will we come back here!"
