Really delicious & healthy flavour combos for affordable prices. Resto has a cute and cozy terrace in the back - really cool plateau vibes.I tried the st urbain corner sandwich with chicken salad and it was delicious!! I stole some of my friend's carrot cake and goddamn I want some more. Ate everything on Mont-Royal, great food for a picnic. Worth a visit!!"
/user_details?userid=l9fGOqjEQDEN10Pog3cMng,Xena W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Café Santropol is the cutest restaurant ever! Located near Jeanne-Mance Park, it has a cute open-air terrace with fairy lights, eccentric statues, greenery, and a pond. I love the down-to-earth bohemian vibe.Santropol has a menu page dedicated to vegan & vegetarian sandwiches. I ordered the Parc Avenue sandwich (tempeh marinated in lime, chili, and cilantro, avocado smash, and tomatoes) which came in the thickest, heartiest brown bread I've ever eaten. All sandwiches are served with a small side salad and tangy dressing. Such a satisfying meal on a hot summer evening!"
/user_details?userid=yERJfPKhhU49aJAJ6DvqEg,Sian D.,"Kirkland, Canada",5 star rating,"WOW!! I would give this place 10 stars if I could. The place is super cute and the food is out of this world. I am a McGill student so, during one of my breaks, my friend dragged me to this place to try it out. I am NOT a tomato person but my friend told me I had to try the killer tomato sandwich, so I did. It was insane!!! The sandwich included tomato garlic cream cheese, fresh tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, and lettuce (and I added chicken salad). It has been a month since I tried the sandwich and I am still not over it!!! It was phenomenal. The portion sizes are also gigantic, so bring an appetite!! I have only ever heard great things about this place, and I only have good things to say about it too. The staff were so sweet, the food was delicious and the inside decor was super cute. I'm going to have to come back in the summer because I hear its even more beautiful on the terrace!"

I didn't check yelp until I got home to know there was a back yard with pond. It was a bit confusing for me to see the sign ""wait to be seated"" and ordering stuff up front at the cashier. I only had a soup meal. The daily soup. Flavourful and spicy. I didn't ask for bread, but they still bought me a basket. My weak will let me had one slice of their irresistible homemade bread. Will come back and check out the fish pond and garden."

It was recommended to me and one taste and I was hooked. So hooked, in fact, that I recently visited Montreal after 5 years of not being there and a Santropol cream cheese sandwich was one of the things I looked forward to most. Seriously, I think I talked about the sandwich for a solid week before I even visited the city.When I finally got there with my friend, I couldn't contain myself. We both got Killer Tomato sandwiches. She got a coffee and I got a spiced apple juice. The sandwich was as good as I remembered and according to my friend, I grinned the entire time I ate it. My friend also enjoyed it and I was worried I overhyped it but she confirmed it was as good as I said. The key is the fresh baked bread that is so fluffy and amazing and pairs perfectly with the flavourful cream cheese. The fresh vegetables, provide a nice crunch to the sandwich. It really is the perfect cream cheese sandwich and while that seems like it is not something you may need in your life, one bite or this and you'd realize you definitely do. I have tried some of their other sandwiches and all are delicious, not just the Killer Tomato. My second favourite is the Pepper Island but really you can't go wrong with anything.The other thing I should mention is that, while I don't personally drink coffee, my brother-in-law is obsessed and since I've been at McGill, I've had to bring bags of Santropol coffee back to Toronto for him. So there's that."

I loved this spot so much I went twice in one week. There are many options for both vegetarians and meat eaters. They have a wide selection of cold and hot drinks. The Duluth Sandwich and gaspacho were my favorite dishes. The carrot cake was one of the best I've had (other than my grandmas)! The bread crust was a little hard to bite through but otherwise I have no complaints regarding the sandwiches. I would highly recommend this cafe for anyone visiting or living in Montréal. It's right next to Jeanne Mance Park so it's the perfect pre- or post- Mont Royal hike destination."

As I cameIn with my daughter and my sleeping baby in a stroller the host told me, i had to wait and that it was too big !!!!! for parents that know (city mini) very small stroller!!!! There was a 3 spot right in front and he told me I couldn't seat there because I will bother other ppl! I was so ready to leave but my daughter was really hungry! After 20-25 min they changed us to a bigger spot. I had to go my self and ask if they could take my order because no one came to see us !  After we had our order I ask for mayo and little plate ! Obviously they never brought it I had to go get it my self!!!! At the cash she didn't even ask me how was it or anything she just prepaid the terminal and pass it over, obviously I  feeltlike giving 0$ but I still gave even though the service was  ! She didn't even look at me because she was texting !!! Honestly for a 45$ bill for 2 sandwich and 1 coffee !! Sadly I'm Not planing to go back ever again !!!!"

Their bread is out of this world, matched by the hypnotic atmosphere they have going on. Staff is lovely as well. I never regret stopping by here any time of day! I will say though that in the last year or so they've been skimping on their side salads though . Give me a little more! And some toppings ! Not just lettuce!"
/user_details?userid=YUlBxBTPMPM3mawg4Opuvw,Haque I.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I frequent many different coffee shops in Montreal and have become fan of high quality coffee shops in Montreal. So, when I went to this cafe, I had high hopes and expectation. My wife and I ordered  a cappuccino and a latte respectively --- the two espresso drinks that I usually order to judge quality of coffee in a cafe. Unfortunately, the latte was as bland as it could be and I felt it was just a cup of milk. The cappuccino on the other hand was bitter in taste. So, if I care about just coffee, I wouldn't go there.But there are few other upsides that I must mention. The waiters were super nice and attentive. Even though the service was a bit slow but personally I wouldn't worry much about that. And most importantly the study spot in this cafe is magical. It's nicely decorated with lots of books and with their postcards and posters the cafe is truly like a magical wizard house. The back patio is beautiful and it's generally crowded and popular spot compared to the inside of the cafe. To sum up:1. Not so great espresso drink.2. Nice study spot if you consider the surroundings, but at the expense of having not so great coffee.3. Friendly staffs.4. Magical interior decoration."

It's a cute place where you can come and study or hang out with your friends. It's super comfortable and the customer service was good! It gets packed easily though so I would suggest coming here a bit early because there was a huge lineup where people had to wait to get a table. Since it was super busy, the waiters took their time coming to us and getting our orders (we had to wait a long time to tell the waiters our order we had to eventually call over someone and tell them we're ready). But we got our food fairly quickly and it was super good! My friends got the CBLT and Park avenue and they both liked it. I got the killer tomato sandwich and I replaced half of the sandwich with the soup of the day which was amazing. It was this lentil soup and it had lots of vegetables in it (my favourite were the olives I'm a die hard olives fan) but it wasn't bland or anything it had a nice taste to it and I enjoyed it a lot. The sandwich was phenomenal as well! It was a red pepper cream cheese and had tomato slices (hence the name lol) and I found that it was a really good combination. I'm not usually a big veggie sandwich fan but I truly liked it and the rest of their menu looked tasty as well so I would definitely come back and get another type of sandwich. Overall I recommend this place :)"

The backyard atmosphere is a real treat and the soups and sandwiches are decent, but the service needs some tweaking. I've been going to Santropol for around 30 years now, and each time the waiters seem to act like you should feel privileged to be there and lucky to be served by them. They rarely crack a smile. Nevertheless, Santropol is a great place to go for lunch. Bring your friends from out of town!"

/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,One of my favourite sandwich spots!! The outdoor patio is perfect for the current weather!!! This time we ordered the Roast Beef with Blue Cheese Sandwich and their signature Killer Tomato Sandwich. The ingredients always taste fresh and servings are huge. Service is great.
/user_details?userid=9MD2Ry2jQ08z1_4VKpEmfQ,Kate G.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This place was recommended to me as having the best sandwiches in Montreal (sorry, that's Olive & Gourmando) so I was excited to go, especially because I'm vegetarian and it looked like they had a great veggie selection. I was really disappointed. The service is really not good - I spent about 15 minutes standing next to the ""LET US SEAT YOU"" sign and the wait staff kept ignoring me, which was weird. Then I had the Sweet Roots sandwich which just tasted very earthy (sure, it's root veg) but the bread was earthy too... I don't know, for the price I expected big flavour. I probably won't come here again :("
/user_details?userid=Mj7kxX_R6kRqM6yqZk94fg,Stéphanie P.,"Maple Ridge, Canada",1 star rating,"Had a very disappointing experience yesterday. Maybe we just got a bad day, as it was super busy. Still, it took over an hour to get our food, no acknowledgement or apology from anyone. Noone checked on us, asked how everything was. Staff was rude, food was so so, soup was good but lukewarm. Had the gluten free bread, which wasnt good, and definitely not a sandwich bread. Worst service I had in a very long time."
/user_details?userid=1V7883W5i_F3mptabTXFIw,Sarah S.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Possibly the most pretentious café in Montreal. The place generally looks nice and cosy but seriously, the food is horrible. I ordered a vegan sandwich which was basically apple and carrot grated over two pieces of brown bread. They gave me a side of salad which was basically grass. No dressing or even olive oil. They sat me outside near some water area which was breeding mosquitoes. There's so much mosquito in their garden, I don't know how they got approved for hygiene. It's really unhealthy and unadvisable to sit your customer next to a mosquito breeding ground. The service is also not that great, they make you wait really long time for something as simple as filter coffee. The place isn't clean either. There were stains in my napkin  and the cutleries needed to be wiped. Additionally , they are using  ""vegan mayonnaise"" to sell air because I ordered a sandwich with vegan mayo and it was so dry that even California looks flooded in front of it. The menu says the place has a historic significance in Montreal and I am all up for that but they should really put an effort to serving customers. I really don't know why this restaurant still runs because honestly they're  exploiting their customers in the name of preserving a neighbourhood building. This is peak Montreal white hipster vibe. They would buy anything that appears down trodden but in truth, is really expensive for its value."

I can see why students love it...I would eat here all the time if I lived close by. I had the Duluth Sandwich with caramelized onions, pears, Old Cheddar, arugula & mayo. My husband had the Smoked Ham sandwich. Great vegetarian, vegan and non-vegetarian options. Sandwiches are big enough to share and are served with a great little side salad. Price is reasonable. I liked this place so much I came back for an early lunch two days later and tried the CBLT sandwich with coconut bacon-tasty & crispy and also had the Santropol Chai."

/user_details?userid=v9RUB5406cPWswPbY9O_Wg,Kira G.,"Huning Highland Historic District, Albuquerque, NM",1 star rating,"Lol this place is a joke. I've gone there several times trying to find the experience others seem to be raving about, but Santropol has consistently come up short. The service is horrible; the servers are extremely slow, seem to lack communication between one another, and most seem bothered by customers coming into the restaurant. I've never had an order come how I ordered it. The food is fine, but steeply overpriced for sandwiches that are composed of dry bread more than anything else. The vegetarian Chili has no spice to it, and the coffee is weak and burnt. The only intriguing aspect of this place is the back patio which is closed anyways for 8 months out of the year. If you're considering going here, spend 5 more minutes looking for a decent place to eat, study, or just enjoy a meal without overpaying and receiving terrible service."

I got a mango chutney one with chicken salad (sorry i want my meat). It was very fresh and refreshing from all those heavy restaurants. It was a bit expensive in my opinion. My mom raved about this place for so long. The sandwiches are huge! None of us finished them. They were all very good. Too much cream cheese though. I wouldnt mind going back."

Its ambience is very Montrealish: old, casual, beautiful, wooden squeaky floors, bright lights and hustle of the people chatting. They offer a great selection of coffee, tea and sandwiches.I have heard that they have one of the best terraces in Montreal... but for that I have to revisit them in summers.I would totally recommend this place if you are looking for affordable breakfast or brunch in the neighbourhood."
/user_details?userid=dOGCIC__6E_Mvra8JxnYOw,Chelsea M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Such a classic Montreal institution! Slow moving and no AC - what else can we expect from this classic sandwich and soup stop. Their bohemian patio is often full during lunch and lazy afternoons in the summer, but their inside seating with ceiling fans and sunlight are a close second seating wise. The menu is not the cheapest (if you want a full meal here it will most likely be over 15$ including a drink) but on weekdays you can replace half of your (already huge) sandwich with a soup!"

/user_details?userid=LPDOx50zUR-rEovzOhADbA,Rachel C.,"Chicago, IL",2 star rating,"Café Santropol is extremely mediocre and I honestly only go here when a vegetarian friend suggests it. The service is HORRIBLE and the food is overpriced and lacklustre. When I walked in I waited in the area that said ""please wait to be seated,"" however the waitresses kept walking by my friend and I without acknowledging us. After around 3 minutes of waiting a woman came from behind the counter and gave us menus, and didn't say a word or seat us. My friend and I eventually got the message that we should seat ourselves, and ventured inside the restaurant. The waitress that came to take our order wasn't great either, she just took our orders and gave us our food without coming by to check on us. I was parched the entire time and desperately needed a refill on my water, however the waitress was nowhere to be seen for the rest of our visit. The restaurant was nearly empty when I went and there was really no excuse for the poor service. I've been to Santropol three times before and the service has been bad in the past, but after this visit I will definitely not be going here again. In regards to the food, it's just OK. A ham sandwich with cream cheese, lettuce, mango chutney, and a SMALL salad, should not cost 14 dollars. Period. The sandwich is mostly bread and the crust is extremely hard. I would honestly be better off just stopping at Subway and eating my sandwich at Jeanne Mance park."
/user_details?userid=OZtrQuQ4Dh0IZ_SyB1ZzCg,Tanya N.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I can't fully review Santropol's food or drink because a large pit bull (tied up in the doorway) bit my forearm before I was able to order. The owner of said dog had no consideration for the animal nor the patrons who had to either tip-toe around the canine or step over him.After the large pit bull bit me, I went inside to wash my bloody arm in their washroom, but the manager refused to speak to me nor to identify the dog owner who was still in the restaurant, as she claimed, ""there is a lunch rush and I'm super busy.""The restaurant wasn't even close to full and it was the mid-afternoon. She did offer water but said that even her staff were far too busy to help in any other way. She didn't even want to have the dog moved to protect other patrons as she said, ""he looks calm now, he'll be fine.""After opening a case with the Montreal police and sharing photos of the dog owner (who eventually came out to bribe me not to report the attack, which I refused), the manager came outside to put on a show for the police but didn't apologize nor help identify the owner (who just paid her bill at the cash where the manager was working.)Santropol is a great place to get a bite, as long as you don't mind being bitten."
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"After delaying this visit for quite a while due to my initial thoughts of the place having a somewhat boring and basic concept (ie sandwiches, soups, and salads with the aesthetics as the main attraction), I decided to check it out for myself after having weird cravings for something healthy yet filling. So, what's my verdict on Café Santropol?Well, I can definitely say that the place is basically how everyone else has described it - cute as a button. I took a seat on the outside patio close to the pond, and it, combined with the tree branches and fairy lights above me, made for a very cozy atmosphere. Based on the ambience alone, it would make for a perfect summer date to impress that special one in your life - it's that charming.As for the food, however, I was slightly less impressed overall. I ordered the espresso milkshake and the Santropol sandwich with roast beef. The milkshake still had a decent espresso taste, but it was rather lukewarm and felt watered-down. The sandwich would have been perfect if they had used a better blue cheese-to-cream cheese ratio - the taste of the blue cheese was overpowering for my tastebuds. However, the rest of the sandwich's components tasted really good, and the pumpernickel bread in particular was super tasty. While I do agree with some of the reviews that they could use more filling (especially for the price), the quality of the bread alone is enough to excuse the fact, I guess.Overall, come here if you love the idea of a cute and cozy date night (or ""me time"") with a perfect summer breeze to go along with it. While the food is a bit overpriced for what it's worth (and I would rather have awful ambience + amazing food than the opposite), I would, much to my chagrin, come back solely so I can experience those homey patio vibes once again."

HOWEVER this does not make up for the terrible service by the waitstaff. After constantly being ignored by these pretentious waitresses and constantly having to get up to help ourselves to water, napkins, etc. we were disappointed once again when we had to pay, and were ignored as they let their ""regulars"" jump in front of us - clearly having seen us and making eye contact. Not returning."
/user_details?userid=swx0FJkZWb6nVP58ZsMl7w,Meng Z.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I love places with a cute atmosphere and Santropol is definitely one of the cutest one I've seen so far. The whole interior emits a cosy vibe, with different ""rooms"", lots of arts, plants, pillows and low key lighting. This is the kind of place you want to bring a first date to. The patio in the back is one of my favourite places to hang out during summer, with the fairy lights and all the greens. Their sandwiches, although relatively pricey, are the bomb. They are HUGE, very healthy (lots of vegetables) and served on pumpernickel bread (my favourite is the mango one). They also have alternating soups of the day and I've never gone wrong with one of their soups and if you love carrot cake, you must try theirs!One of my favourite hangout spots in Montreal!"

I would describe her but I think if you were there you would know whom I speak of.If you are the manager or the owner of this place, she seems like the smallest one there out of the girls that work there, she is terrible not nice at all.

I hate the feeling of an oily aftertaste in my mouth but everything tasted fresh and hit the spot.Aside from the food though, I honestly just came here to sit at the back patio w/ the beautiful fairy lights and enjoy the surroundings while eating fresh food.

Ordered the killer tomato sandwich with chicken salad and it was so good that I finished the whole thing (slowly but surely) while catching up with a friend. Bread was soft, chicken was not dry, and sauce/mayo was refreshing. My friend ordered the kombucha but sadly it was just a RISE bottle (we had a good laugh about this because we both thought it would be an in-house creation). Paid about $15.50 with tax and tip for the sandwich which is decent for the large portion. Service was pretty good too! Overall great experience and I will definitely come here again!"

There is plenty of seating inside, but the patio is gorgeous on a summers night and I highly recommend sitting out there if it is available.  They have a full coffee/tea/espresso bar.  We had several in our party get lattes which they were happy with.  We had a couple of lemonades and two chai.  Neither of us were impressed with the chai.  It seemed bland, almost watered down.  The restaurant serves a variety of soups, salads and sandwiches.  We shared a vegetarian chili which was a large portion and had great flavor.  The sandwiches and salads are all vegetarian friendly, but if you are a meat eater like me you can add ham to your sandwich.  I had the mango madness and it was out of this world.  It had ham, cream cheese, and spicy mango chutney on this beautiful brown bread.  The sandwich came with a small salad, but the sandwich was quite large and delicious, so I ate most of the sandwich and decided to forgo the salad.  We also sampled a few desserts including a raspberry cheesecake and key lime tart, both of which were awesome.  If I am ever in Montreal again I will likely return."
/user_details?userid=N4ZdcLNwGL9fzFiqtR1YqQ,Justina N.,"Manhattan, NY",3 star rating,I would say it's a 5 star for staff and atmosphere. It has a really magical outdoor space for the summer and the decor is eclectic in a good way.  The ingredients are fresh and bread is homemade so in theory the food should be really good but I don't think I delivered or tasted as good as it should have been.  It has a ton of vegetarian options if you are a vegetarian and the homemade bread is good.  But it lacks flavor.

The garden in the back is by far the best place to sit during the hot summer months but the seats inside are just as cozy in the winter time. Prices have been steadily going up over the years but the place still somehow manages to rely that hippy-Boho vibe it's always had.  I'm not going to tell you which sandwich to get, my favorite changes constantly over time but you can't go wrong with the traditional flavors. Their originals have some unusual combinations here but they are always quite tasty like the Killer Tomato, Sweet Root and Pepper Island. I know I'm weird in saying this but sometimes it's the basic ingredients in the construction of any one dish is what either makes it or breaks it and in this case , it's the bread. No joke.Once you start coming here, make a mental note of this place. You'l be coming back all the time."

It is colourful, fresh and a laptop free zone. Enjoy the koi pond and the greenery as you eat light and refreshing food. The first time I ever went on a Saturday evening, we also enjoyed live music from a fun little indie group.Their sandwiches are big, and they offer you the choice to substitute half your sandwich with a soup. I ordered the CBLT as I am a huge fan of coconut bacon, and substituted half my sandwich with a sweet potato and almond butter soup. The soup was velvety smooth and tasty. The sandwich came with a little bit of salad and was delightful. Cafe Santropol is definitely my top pick for when I'm craving a sandwich.Definitely, a restaurant you should visit in the summer and a great place for food date."

The rest of the food fell flat and was just ok. Not terrible, but not great. We definitely had higher expectations. The service was not good. The staff was a little rude and it was very hard to find a waitress to take our order and answer questions. Very slow. They didn't do a good job explaining their menu. Overall, this place is just ok."

We waited for nearly an hour before our food arrived, during which time the servers barely made eye contact with us. When it finally arrived, the food was fresh and well-crafted, but not much better than what I could make in my own kitchen with ingredients from our farmer's market. The verdict: good, but not worth the wait by a long shot."

Their sandwiches seem really basic, but once they bring it to you, its this big sandwiches, filled with whatever choice of food you want. The price is super good! You think that it wouldnt be enough, but I was super full after I had that for lunch! I'd also suggest the Chocolate milkshake! Comes with ice-cream and great as a small desert.

You have to put 10$ minimum to get a sandwich. They put a lot of sauce and no filling . They have big loaves of bread so expect to eat a lot of bread and nothing inside.

The interior of the cafe is filled with the heavenly aroma of bread, but my friends and I opted to sit in the outdoor garden, wanting to take advantage of the fleeing warm weather. It was a slightly chilly day, but there were heaters and also blankets available. The outdoor garden is beautiful and cozy, and includes a small pond (with fish!) as well as a super colorful and gorgeous hammock. I can just imagine coming here on a hot summer day, sipping on some coffee and reading a book, and relaxing in the hammock - seems like a perfect escape for a day!The servers were very friendly and helpful with recommendations. The food is super delicious as well. I got the half and half special, so I got half of the Chaucer sandwich (tofu) and a bowl of rutabaga honey soup, and both were really good. I also tried my friend's sandwich, the Duluth, which was very tasty as well. The sandwich bread, in particular, is really good.

Well, on a recent trip to Montreal with my two kids, I decided to take them to all my old haunts. I was saddened to see that so many were either gone or just....sad and run down. So I was THRILLED to return to San Tropol to discover it was just the same, wonderful, eclectic place as it was back in my McGill days (1980-1983)!!!! The whole restaurant was the same, the set-up was the same, and the fabulous food was the same!We sat outside in the lovely courtyard terrasse, and it was as pretty as always - perhaps prettier, even, with a cobalt blue fence with happy yellow details, a small central garden with small statues, and strung lights from the trees. Intimate and pretty. The restaurant interior is as warm as it was 30 years ago, with various sections and two central washrooms (the latter are small, unisex, and be forewarned: the door on one washroom never closes or locks. Yikes). Embossed metaled coffered tiles line the ceiling and walls, with large, opened garage door ""windows"" and overhead fans in the summertime, creating a breezy space. The menu is still great, with humongous cream cheese-based sandwiches made from fresh bread. I was saddened to see that my ""Sisters of Jeanne Mance"" sandwich was no longer offered (it was my old standby), but thankfully they still had the ""Northern Lights"" (with olives. A family favorite!), and they had some new offerings which were delicious: the ""No. 6.5"" with bananas and black currents and honey was amazingly delicious! And my youngest kid had the ""Mango Madness"" which she loved (she said it was a bit spicy, though - and very messy! But she ate the whole thing). The cauliflower and cheddar soup was a bit bitter, and my kids said it had a bit of an off aftertaste, but they doctored it up with a bit of sugar and then said it was great. The accompanying side salads were small but good, and the salad dressing was excellent.For dessert we shared the carrot cake, and it was a moist as I remember. It could have used a bit more icing, but it was delicious. And the chai latte and the cafes au lait were wonderful, and presented beautifully in pretty glasses with fruit as garnishes. In fact, all the dishes were plated and presented beautifully, with lovely fruit garnishes.Our server was nice, despite her manning many tables, we didn't have to wait long at all. Parking on the street can be problematic, so I recommend going at off times.This restaurant is truly a gem. I can't recommend it strongly enough."
/user_details?userid=fHrCK0tAEzUPXBVGObGzAQ,Emily L.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Many people passing by the Duluth side of the cafe will surely recognize the colourful terrace at the back of Cafe Santropol. This spot literally has EVERYTHING you could ever want from a Cafe -- Fantastic coffee and drinks, homemade soups and chilis, delicious sandwiches (on thick bread with custom cream cheeses), loaded salads and delectable cakes. In the past, I've tried and loved: 1. Tuna salad - Ask for extra dressing on their salads. I always feel like there isn't enough. 2. Killer tomato sandwich - Sundried tomatoes, basil and tomato. I added roast beef3. Carrot cake - Most likely the best carrot cake I've had in my life. Unbelievably moist... I think there may be pineapple chunks or something in the batter. The slice is massive so you could easily share with someone and both be satisfied. There is juuuust enough cream cheese icing so it's not heavy but you get some with every bite. 4. Soups - I hesitate to name specific ones because they change them daily. Between the vegetable soup, Thai curry chicken and chili, I've loved them all so I would recommend whatever their daily special is! 5. Drinks - I love their Americanos, chai lattes and the Santropol herbal iced tea (pomegranate juice with hibiscus tea) In the summertime, they have ample seating between the indoors and outdoors. There are plenty of plugs along the wall if you want to do work on your computer. Enjoy!"

I often I want to apologize for making them have to work. Not a good feeling2. The water they bring to the table is not drinkable, worse than tap water. It is always luke warm and tastes like something you swallowed by mistake. Not sure where they get it....but when you dont drink it they throw it on the plants right in front of you. Not something I need to see FYI. They kinda force you to order a beverage if you want to drink something. I don't enjoy that they use such tactics to get you to spend more of your hard earned money. 3. The side garden salad is made up of questionable leaves and twigs...looked like they might have been picked right out of the garden, taking the term ""garden salad"" quite literally...I'd rather not see it on the plate than have to pick off questionable twigs and leaves.4. We were served children sized cups of the iced tea and lemonade that we ordered. While most other tables had the regular size glasses. I guess they might not have had any clean glasses available.  I could have gladly waited. I inquired why they were so small, after all I was being charged the same price as the big glasses, and I was reassured by the annoyed waitress the SAME AMOUNT OF BEVERAGE WAS IN BOTH THE LARGE and the SMALL GLASSES. Now, I'm not a genius, not good at math either, but I do know a half a cup is different from a full cup. I finished my 3.00$ drink in TWO SIPS, while other patrons were sipping away for 20 minutes....which further proved my point. A nice patio won't be sufficient to keep you going strong in the winter Santropol...work on your attitudes, which means that you may have to smile sometimes even when you don't feel life it...yes, it's part of working with the pubic 101, the quantity of your beverages/ quality of the water and your questionable ""salad"" and maybe you won't find the winter months so long this year."

I remember discovering this place with its charming back patio green oasis in the heart of the Plateau almost twenty years ago, and have gone back every time I return to Montreal since. Anyone I've ever taken there for lunch is happy with their meal, which is pretty much a giant sandwich on fresh pumpernickel bread and either a soup or salad. The sandwich options are pretty unique and it's hard to make a decision about which one would be the most interesting and delicious. I always opt for smoked salmon. I would recommend that if not ordering the smoked salmon, then get the chicken salad addition to the sandwich, otherwise you're looking at a lot of bread and cream cheese with other accent toppings, like nuts or spreads. The chicken salad is divine and they'll add it to any sandwich. The soups are ALWAYS good - typically a lentil-based option or a gazpacho. Very hipster in feel, with a little bit of original legit artist/hippie vibe."

I had an iced coffee late with a hint of mint ( which i asked for) and my friend had vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup and fruits. We thoroughly enjoyed our drink and food and shall go back to sample the main meals and/or entrees.*Bonus This place sells books for 3$ - which, being a book lover pretty much sealed the deal for me - of course i purchased a book by Albert Camus - & only that one because i didn't have any more change than 3$.

The interior decor is also quite eclectic, including some old-fashioned stamped tin ceilings, a step-down front section with large windows, cozy booths, and an assortment of paintings and wall sculptures.During the warmer months, their private fenced-in backyard terrasse is a lush garden oasis, complete with full-size trees, a small waterfall and fish pond. At night, it's gently lit with patio lighting and overhead string lights to give a warm and pleasant atmosphere. On Sundays during the summer, you can often hear the distant sounds of drums from the weekly Tam-Tams on the side of nearby Mount-Royal.The bilingual menus are very veg-friendly, with very large and hearty sandwiches made with Santropol's own dark and thickly sliced bread. Many of the selections lean heavily on the cream cheese, so read the menu carefully if it's not one of your favourites. They often have a selection of two soups of the day; on our most recent visit, I choose the Beef & Barley and was quite pleased with it's belly-warming effect on such a chilly winter evening. During the weekdays, you can substitute half of your sandwich for a soup.One of my favourite choices is the Minted Ham Sandwich, with ham, cucumbers, thinly sliced apples and sweet mint jelly, served with a light side salad. My dinner companion choose something new for himself, the Mango Madness, with thick cream cheese, sweet and spicy mango and lettuce, with a side salad, which he enjoyed very much.Santropol offers a nice selection of coffees, teas and other beverages, as well as some delightful milkshakes, available in a multitude of flavours. Their desserts are also quite nice. Santropol has free WiFi (courtesy of Ile-sans-fils), which makes it a great place to bring your laptop, catch up on email or other web-related work. The wait staff don't rush the customers, which is a refreshing change from some other cafés that I've been to in Montreal. You'll often see customers working on their laptops, reading the various local indie papers, writing in their journals or even sketching in their art pads. A lovely way to spend the afternoon, either alone or with friends...All told, Santropol is a true Montreal tradition; one that has both ex-pats and locals returning year after year!"

How many first dates, friendly lunches, long university reading sessions, hungover solitary coffee ravishings? Whither flow the sandwiches of time? I am a big fan of their carroty-raisiny veggie pate and their simple salads. All of their sandwiches are huge - the tuna will feed you for 2 days (if you are 5""2'), but Santropol is really about being the meat between the slices of LIFE that is its atmosphere. The stamped tin ceiling, murals, old books and wooden everything along with the beauuutiful leafy backyard make this the kind of place every Montrealer is happy to visit over and over. I recommend asking 'light on the cream cheese' if you don't like it to be more than 2 centimeters thick. Service wise, it varies. The place is bigger than it looks so the wait is usually justified. Take it in stride and enjoy their secondary function as highly mobile lusting targets."

Their terrace has a big tree in the middle and its vegetation and hippie ambiance will give you that zen feeling you are looking for! Also, there's quite a bit of shade (probably created by that big tree) so it's always nice on a sunny day. We went there as a group of 5 and easily found a table. We got their sandwiches and they were huge! Same applies if you get their milkshakes (just saying!). I tried the carrot and tofu sandwiches, and definitely preferred the tofu one. The only thing we found was that it missed some sauce and that it tasted dry. I heard from friends that they loved their coffee (I'm not a big coffee drinker but wanted to put it here in case you were wondering). I'd definitely return to try more plates."

I had heard great things about this cafe before venturing there myself but was a bit apprehensive because I had heard that a number of their sandwiches are stacked with cream cheese. I am not a cream cheese fan so that does limit the menu for me quite a bit - but their non cream cheese options are to die for. The place is adorable. What a wonderful little hideaway in the the middle of Montreal. It's very quaint and has the most wonderful outdoor patio (unfortunately since it's Montreal it only gets utilized some of the year). All of the ingredients are so amazingly fresh. The sandwiches are served on giant fresh pumpernickel bread. The fixings in the sandwiches are amazing. I used to be a hummus sandwich fan, there hummus is made onsite and is delicious, but then I got turned onto the Sweet Root sandwich. This sandwich is by far my favourite sandwich of all time. It's delicious and so unique. It probably the thing I miss most about living in Montreal and it's the one thing that I always make sure to get when I go back to Montreal to visit. Also, you need to try the coffee. So delicious. This place is a must in Montreal."

Sit in the terrace if possible - absolutely perfect view of Mont Royal in the garden, which contains a small yard, a pond, and a handful of tables nestled together among plants. The drinks are delicious, food is excellent and everything is very fresh. Espresso and tea drinks are served with slices of fresh fruit such as pineapple or orange on the rim of the glass or mug. While the menu is somewhat limited, it's worth a visit for the atmosphere alone. Wifi is free, though this probably isn't the kind of spot you can set up shop in for hours.A diverse crowd was eating here from groups of adults, to families with young children, who enjoyed running around the tables and playing in the pond. Très pittoresque!I'm not sure I'd make a special trip to this place during months when the terrace is closed, because the food was great but not out of this world. When the weather is nice, it is worth visiting for the atmosphere alone."

Unfortunately, the food is poorly executed. Between our two sandwiches, there was easily over 1 lb. of cream cheese. Too much cream cheese on thick bread makes for a practically uneatable sandwich. The flavors are delicious, but there was too much cream cheese and bread to really taste anything else. It's too bad that the food didn't match the lovely setting."

Went there today since it was right besides where I was staying and ordered a sandwich & a latte. (The latte was really good, strong favor and they garnished it w/ a strawberry) I later found out that they roast their coffee bean locally. The sandwich was delicious and big and has a lot of cream cheese (which not everybody like but I do)..I could only finish half and have to box their other half. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients, and o they made their own break as well, which is pretty awesome. All their ingredients are organic and they have vegan options as well.

I've only ever been to Santropol in the past for lunch (killer tomato sandwich, for the win!), so this was a new experience for me as well. Despite being very popular and highly recommended, it is still home to many locals and hasn't lost its special, unique touch. Great service too, our waiter was so nice and helpful.Being a beautiful, sunny day, we made sure to sit in the lovely garden, amongst the flowers and the cute, little pond. We ordered the Montréalaise and Florentine, both of which were delicious. The bagels tasted fresh and were toasted to perfection, the eggs were cooked nicely, and it didn't feel very heavy. We had an iced coffee to balance out the 25 degree summer sun, while still getting a good pick-me-up made by some great, fair trade, and local coffee. This place is simply magical."
/user_details?userid=vzYG8Btn4Y4hZWfkNBbOSQ,Corinne P.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"The drinks here have always been impeccable, but they really oversell the food. First of all, if you're interested in fiber, don't bother ordering a sandwich with ""brown bread."" It's Wonderbread dough mixed with food dye. The menu offers light fair, but don't fear, carnivores, you can still get those ham chunks on top of your salad. I highly recommend anything with fresh coffee in it; Santropol is well-known for its high-quality, fair-trade and organic coffee production and distribution, and with the roasters located just a dozen blocks away, the cafe can't be lacking. The service is casual and friendly, so don't expect anyone to break a sweat bringing you lunch. However they will go out of their way to make you feel like you're hanging out in your own backyard, and recommend anything on the menu. The main highlight of the cafe itself is the garden, complete with slate flagstone paths, bauble lights hanging from overhead foliage and a bubbling fountain. During the cold months it's nice to curl up with a cuppa at one of the tables near the kitchen and catch some of the banter floating between the waitstaff. I would recommend any afternoon in the summer or winter being taken in this cafe with a large drink and a good book."

/user_details?userid=7qzfClFiE3SchM3F3MwIpA,N P.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"Certainly local and personal but not necessarily memorable. I believe too much enthusiasm stems from how cute and unique Santropol is. Certainly looks good from every perspective and offers the luxury of outdoor and covered lunch but the food offer is not that great.Surely the sandwiches sound appealing with their fruity ingredients but make sure you understand that you will have jelly and not actual fruits. Hence my disappointment: the taste wasn't bad but I felt that the sandwiches were way too sweet. More, although the cream cheese is pretty good, the load is way to heavy and does not combine that well with the jelly. Don't get me wrong: it wasn't bad tasting but I felt that the food would gain in interest by balancing the cream cheese and the jelly more accurately. Furthermore, drinks are okay but still way to heavy and the service was pretty long despite a relatively calm afternoon.Very Montreal, although not at its best."

I also ordered a chai soy latte, which was great.  You can tell they actually brew the tea rather than using the prepackaged stuff like most places do.I lingered far after I was done eating, just enjoying the ambiance on the patio (and yes, fine, eavesdropping on my fellow diners).  I never felt rushed or as though the staff wanted me to leave.  Cafe Santropol would be great for lunch or dinner and would also be a fantastic place to waste a few hours with friends.  If only we had something like this at home..."

The vegetables are colorfully selected, crisp and orginally spiral cut.BUT, a few things to keep in mind. The service is close to abysmal. The boyfriend and I waited a half an hour after we ordered to receive our water and coffee (well, only his coffee arrived), and we would have walked out, except that our food came at exactly the same time. The food itself is tasty but certainly not gourmet - more like your creative college roommate who just discovered that you came put a giant amount of cream cheese on just about everything.  Know that you're going in for a nice sandwich and hopefully a nice seat by a window, nudge the staff (if you can find them) and don't even think about it if you're in a rush."

Another time the cream cheese and chicken sandwich did not contain any chicken, I sent it back and they just stuffed it with pieces of chicken, the whole thing was grotesque.  Also, you practically can't get anything that doesn't have cream cheese. The tea is mediocre for the price they charge."

At best, it's mold ridden, and a good excuse not to clean the place, and then you add to this the fact that it is dusty. All this aside, the staff is either completely rude, or simply cannot be bothered. After arriving, it took 20 minutes to notice me, even though I was standing at the counter. Their online menu is NOT updated, so when I asked for a smoked salmon sandwich, the response (no joke) was, ""we don't carry salmon and fish items, because of the nuclear disaster meltdown in Japan"". So wait, salmon only comes from Japan? I thought Canada had salmon too, no? The other patrons seemed puzzled by the response, but since they'd been waiting for a while, took their seats, when offered (hope they had a better time). Another 10 minutes elapsed before the gentleman decided to take my order. Of course, after this 30 minute investment, it was another 30 minutes for my takeout order to be ready. Such a serious waste of time! Their staff also have no concept of balance, when it comes to food, either too bland or just too much bland, or just too sweet (compare the sweetened iced tea to the apple juice). Super dry bread! Seriously, run if you can, or if your friends insist on going here, tell them that you'll meet them after having a decent meal elsewhere, but be under no illusions if you want terrible service, at a hefty price, with absolutely horrible food!"

Everytime I have been dragged here by some vegetarian or bike-riding friend of a friend I have been disappointed and ultimately just felt like I would have been better off eating fucking mcdonalds. At least my wallet wouldn't have felt pillaged. Not only was the food at best sub-par, but the service here is some of the most charmless and lazy that I have experience in Montreal - and to single out a place in that city for being the absolute worst is no small comment, which I'm sure anyone who lives there understands. My big beef with santropol is that it has to pick an aesthetic. Either it can improve its service and the flavour of its food and keep its price point, or remain a lazy alright-tasting hippy joint but make its menu appropriately cheap. Right now it's just a bum pissing in an alleyway wearing a chinchilla fur coat. wtf."

The idea of eating differently from how I was raised simply never really occurred to me until I got to university. Everyone and their dog was a vegetarian or had gone iron-deficient by dabbling in it at one point in their life. It all started to make a bit more sense to me after I dined at Cafe Santropol. I will never forget their decadent and thick homemade rye bread and their triple-decker sandwiches with layers of nut-and-seed filled cream cheeses. Exotic fruits decorated the plates, and there was always more than I could eat. I tried a few things, but my favourite was the tuna, tomato and cream cheese sandwich. The combo was mouth-watering, and for years afterwards I'd try to recreate it at home. On every trip back to Montreal I've stopped in here to introduce their culinary creations to a friend and get another taste. They have a gorgeous, lush patio out back, fenced in and private.

Funny that most of my favourite restaurants seem to be like this. I think a bit of polite nudging is worth it, considering the quality of what finally arrives. Don't arrive there starving & agitated, you will just ruin the place for yourself...and that would be a shame.

I got a soup and half sandwich and the soup was amazing. the sandwich... okay. first they told me I had to get it with cream cheese, and if I didn't all the other toppings would just fall out. so fine, cream cheese. I ordered it with chicken, which i thought meant chicken deli meat. wrong, chicken means CHICKEN SALAD, which I don't eat. I told this to another server (because my waiter never came over to check on us) and she just brought me another plate to take the chicken salad off the sandwich. but it was covered in mayo (which is the reason I don't eat chicken salad) so it was kinda pointless, plus I wanted a real sandwich not a veggie one. so I just didn't eat my sandwich at all. we waited forever for our check, but finally we stopped someone and they then explained they all work together and we pay at the register. overall, it was horrible service, and a  horrible sandwich (my boyfriends, which he did eat, he was unhappy with as well). maybe it would be better if the menu was clearer and they were up front about how they served, but I'd still think they should have checked on us or at least offered another sandwich or something, rather than a plate to take the chicken salad that I didn't know would be there based on the ""add chicken"" option on the menu.
