/user_details?userid=UGfVTbdt1ePjT4n4zSosEw,Nishant S.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"This place is legit. Prolly the best Izakhaya that I've been to in Montreal. I was here 3 times in a week during a visit to MTL, the food here is so good or I am just crazy. So I am going to give you a list of my favorites so please listen to me, okay? My faves - Takoyaki - yummy. Get the sesame chili oil to sprinkle on top. Everlasting Roots Sake - smooth hot sake. Expensive but way better than the generic Gekkeikan sake. Karupaccho - white fish carpaccio. Butabara- grilled pork belly. Aah.... do I need to say more. Imadake Yakiniku- beef on hot stone. Ebi Mayo- deep fried shrimp with spicy mayo Karamiso ramen - wow! Get it with the extra spicy ball and extra garlic. Perfect meal for a cold day. ...I wanted to write more and give an exhaustive list of recommendations but now I am bored typing. So just go there and checkout the place for yourself."

If you ever wanna go out with a group of friends this is the place! SAKE BOMB!!!!!It was my first time trying this place I will never regret it! The food was DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!I recommend you to take 5 plates if you are two and it is enough! We were so full and their drinks are yummy!I really liked the staff, when we came in the waiter really wanted us to sit on a table where we will be comfortable she was doing everything to make it quick, she was friendly and kept on apologizing for the little wait, we did not mind waiting 10 minutes bcoz we were enjoying the music! I looooooovee this place, and ill be back for sure!"

The food here is great!! We tried several things from the menu, and everything lived up to our expectations! The food makes it worth enduring the painfully slow service!! Initially our server got our order wrong, then brought one persons meal close to when the rest were done, forgot the same drink twice and was hard to get a hold off in general through our entire visit here. The vibe is great on the weekend, the interior and ambiance are 10/10! Would definitely recommend this spot for the food!"

I thought why not give it a try because they had good reviews. I got seated pretty fast. The menu was very interesting as I wanted to try couple different things. I got a poke bowl which was very delicious  and spicy  and dumplings as an entree which was very chewy. As for drinks I ordered one but they forgot and I only realized that towards the end. Overall I was impressed by the food. It was really good. PS: don't get scared when you hear the waitress screaming, she's just cheering someone who is about to drink a Sake Bomb"

It offers an impressive array of both traditional (gomaae, gyoza, tataki) and less traditional (goat cheese croquettes) dishes, and even some select plum wines. The service is quick albeit rather overwhelmed, and while the place looks great it is extremely noisy and messy, owing to the Sake Bang! gimmick which consists in making glasses of alcohol tumble into one another after shouting Sake Bang! four times. Fun the first time but since everyone wants to try it out, it's rather difficult to have a conversation with your fellow dinnergoers. Definitely best for a lively birthday party!"
/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"3.5**Great party atmosphere and tasty dishes. Service could be improved.We made a reservation for two on Saturday night to celebrate my bday. After we were seated the hostess (?) told us we had to leave by 9:30. I told her that we probably wouldn't be done by then and then she said that we would have to move if that was the case. This was a big turn off for me and is a major reason why they lost stars. In the end, they didn't bother us about it but I was really unimpressed with her approach.We ordered a bunch of dishes including fried shrimp with spicy mayo, two chicken dishes, squid...etcWe enjoyed almost all the dishes except the squid which I found pretty meh. I got a mango cocktail which was yummy.The atmosphere there is great and fun! It's definitely loud but that's all part of the experience. We didn't do a sake bomb cause we were only two and were too scared to do it alone but had a fun time cheering along with the large group chugging drinks next to us.The green tea cheesecake for dessert was definitely the highlight of the meal.

It's been years since then so for my last meal of the trip, my aunt suggested Imadake. We came on a Wednesday evening and it was reasonably busy. We had no trouble grabbing a table. The inside is super cool with huge Japanese styled murals adorning the walls. They even have a cute anime style portraits of all their staff members.Sake bombs are the thing to do if you're drinking. When I say sake, you say bomb. Sake. Bomb. SAKE. BOMB.They had a summer special menu along with a poke bowl on the back. The main menu is pretty extensive but has pictures of everything; cold dishes, salads, grilled, fried, ramen/noodles, hot dishes and desserts.- Gobo ($7.00) - burdock root deep fried. I've only had burdock one other time. These reminded me of daikon. Interesting spin mimicking fries.- Gyu tan ($10.00) - miso marinated cow tongue. Delicious! It take a bit longer to chew but it's well worth the effort. My favourite dish of the night.- Takoyaki ($6.00) - you get 6 pieces of octopus balls. I'm not a huge takoyaki fan but these were hot and crispy. I appreciated how it was lightly sauced and had just the right amount of bonito flakes.- Kaiso sarada ($8.00) - seaweed salad with sesame dressing. Wasn't expecting this to be a mix of salad and seaweed. - Agedashi ($6.00) - tofu in fish broth. Lightly deep fried but oh so soft on the inside. Really nicely done.- Pork yakiudon ($13.00) - noodles had a great chewy texture. We would have liked more pork slices.Good spot to bring a group of friends. I'd come back to try more."
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Cool place, they have a downstairs space area for bigger groups, it's more intimate and perfect for dinner with friends, not as loud as upstairs. The service is definitely top notch, very attentive and friendly, quick and deserves 5 stars. I've had takoyaki which was great and ebi mayo for starters, good choice to take while you are waiting for your ramen. Their karamiso is good, although I've definitely tasted better elsewhere. Overall, pleasant experience so I can see why this place is popular. Good choice if you're in the area."

If you plan not to be rushed out then make sure you call in advance I came here Saturday night around 6:45. I took the dragonball drink named after one of my favourite childhood animes :) very tasty . Fried squid was yummy not the best I had but good, The lamb brochette very good buy tiny and expensive same case with the streak good but expensive. I want to come back here try other things and not be rushed out lol ."

/user_details?userid=XxBbmN0D74n1M_8Rc3RydA,Edward R.,"Monroe Township, NJ",4 star rating,"This place is a blast......yes the demographic is the under 30's set with us ending up that night as their cool parents out on the town.Imadake reminds me of all those vaguely Asian West Village dives I used to frequent in my inebriated youth back the 80's. Overheated,loud,dark and a bit seedy just to add an edge to this Saint Cath's Izakaya/Ramen/restaurant/bar.Seated by a SWAT officer and attended to by a petit Hello Kitty {it was 2 days to Halloween} we took in the décor which is decidedly spare but efficient, with French rap as our background music we started with their seaweed salad which was excellent with that salty/sweet crunch over the freshest baby greens with a mild ginger flavored dressing.....a great start made even better with a glass of ice cold Sapporo lager.Their famous crispy deep fried Chicken skin is indescribable in its salty, crispy goodness and one of the main reasons we had to try this Restaurant. It was indeed worth it.Next came the BBQ pork belly with a soy/ merin glaze with dusting of a delicious cumin tinged seasoning, I could have had 2 more but the tender and tasty whole squid was next served with a creamy garlic dip.....Time for another Sapporo.We rested a bit deciding what to order next while watching in awe all the tables around us consume round after round of Sake Bombs.... ""When I say Sake you say Bomb! Sake Bomb! Sake Bomb! Sake Bomb!"" shouts our Hello Kitty and with a final bang on the table the shot glass of Sake plopped into the beer with a satisfying splash....most of the time....I'm hungry again.We decided on the grilled beef tongue which was a bit tough but tasty never the less, sliced thin,coated in a slightly sweet glaze and expertly grilled, the tongue was chewy but filled with all the beefy goodness charcoal heat brings out with just the right amount of char around the edges. Next to the Chicken skin my favorite of the night.Our final dish was in essence a prime example of Japanese Inspired packaging as it was basically all the end cuttings of the night with raw salmon,fried tofu bits,seaweed,Nori covered with a fried wonton skin....so a leftovers salad. good not great.Imadake is a loud,boistrious and above all a tasty fun venue for some very unique but delicious Japanese small dishes and we can't wait to try more of their menu.Have a Sake Bomb.....""When I say Sake, you say Bomb....Sake?     Go ahead I dare you."
/user_details?userid=AhnsP--qQZEebiDIxfJZBQ,James M.,"Hunt Club East - Western Community, Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Adding some photos to complement our review. I don't like to snap pictures with other patrons in them, but the upstairs dining area is dimly lit setting the mood for Imadake as a night spot. The photo of the Yakisoba does not do it justice but it was a great mix of salty, savoury and sweet favours (sweeter to more tangy from the sauce, vegetables, and shredded preserved ginger). If your selections range too much to the salty end you may want to wash your food down with some beer (I could not since I was driving). On that note, free parking is available on Ste Catherine after 6 pm on most weekday evenings."

There is no flashy sign to mark this restaurant, but they don't need it! Our waiter was extremely friendly and attentive. I ordered the Ramen with chicken... WOW WOW WOW! The chicken tasted a little like bourbon chicken, the broth was creamy (almost like egg drop soup) and the rest of the bowl was delicious. I highly recommend adding the sesame seed spice/sauce to your bowl for a little kick! The food came out with good time, but our waiter told us there was a mistake in the kitchen. We ended up with free dessert because of that! You must go here while in Montreal!!"
/user_details?userid=5QrlMMzUq_RoUlEyH2zcig,Judy K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We went as a group of twenty for our birthdays (5 girls have birthday in February) Our waitress was Ashley, and she was fantastic! She was sweet, attentive, funny and very on the ball. The rest of the staff have an equally awesome attitude and work ethic. You're surrounded by staff who love their job ;)The food is always delicious. Tapas style; good for sharing with someone. They offer ramen noodle bowls, dumplings, fried chicken, bacon wrappped asparagus, beef tataki, white fish ceviche, octopus balls among so much more!  I've never had a bad dish here. They have specialty cocktails, beer and a vast selection of sake. If you're going it's always recommend to make a reservation; they require a credit card to guarantee your spot. It's always busy. Noise level is pretty loud but it goes with the ambiance. They are (I guess) known for their sake bombs and sake bombs chant. *When I say sake you say bomb..Sake.. BOOOMB! Definitely worth a visit!"
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,"I've mentioned this a 100 times but I'm not a drinker. So this time around I came here with Adam and his co-workers. They all felt like Sake Bombs. I didn't know what a Sake bomb was before this trip.After trying them, I can indeed concur that they are awesome! It's so cool to slam the table and see all the cups of alcohol slip into each other. Our waitress the first time around was Ashely and she's the best. She knew I didn't like beer so she gave me a ""pikachu"" bomb instead which is a fruit juice base but still a sake shot at the top. Less alcohol and tastes a bit better. Ashley was really friendly. She served us quickly and drank a bit with us. The second time we had jimmy serve us and he was great too! He drank with us, gave us some free shots, the whole works. I thought that buying food in order to be able to drink was going to be an inconvenience but not that much. You can't order any of the under 5$ stuff but everything above works. Some options of 5$ meals that you can get to start drinking are: egg rolls with cheese and ham, vegetable dumplings, and ice cream (yes! Ice cream counts). The food is pretty good. I've had the ramen, chicken skewers, calamari, tempura shrimp, asparagus and bacon skewers, vanilla ice cream, and the vegetable dumplings. The only thing I didn't like was the calamari. They are very rubbery. Don't get those. Renu is the name of the owner and he's a very funny, likeable, and cool person. He welcomes you with a big smile on his face and makes sure everything is going well with your party. This place has quickly become one of my favourites and totally worth going to."
/user_details?userid=Q7JWDxkeVsZPBsLHr-jN-A,Who C.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Can't comment on the atmosphere since we came at 5:30 specifically to avoid it, but the cocktails we ordered were good and fairly strong. We heard a few sake bombs going on and appreciated the show. Service at this hour was efficient so no complaints there.The most important is, of course, the food. Everything was good and some plates were even delicious. We ordered the takowasa, takoyaki, beef tataki, black cod, karaage and shrimp yakisoba (and a complementary salmon tartare they brought us by mistake but let us keep!) The musts are definitely the black cod, as everyone says, and the beef tataki. Karaage is certainly one of the best in town, super crispy and tender. On the other hand, the takoyaki was alright and had very little octopus in it. The yakisoba was also underwhelming though the flavours were interesting.All in all, Imadake might be more for those in search of a good party/small bites place. The food is good, but doesn't warrant a second visit after trying the most important dishes."

You have gorgeous art work fun Staff & huge chalk board downstairs and not to mention sake bombs!I've had times that I've come and it's been packed and only once like today were we the only ones in the restaurant that's because we came at 5 on the dot. Loved being the only ones but also missed the atmosphere of everyone cheering and laughing.Food came super quick and super tasty. There so many different options but a few of my favs are the seaweed salad and the shrimp with octopus balls. Can't go wrong with those 3. Great thing about this place is that it's small tapas style plates so you aren't stuck with a huge plate if you don't like it. The price is right. I've had a lot of ups with this place and very few downs only when it's to packed when you try to just walk in off the street but it's understandable because i love it too ! Explore the menu they have great options :)"
/user_details?userid=tLa8oaGfwYj2zX3IFGv67g,Quintin A.,Hong Kong,5 star rating,"An incredible find right next to Atwater.At first, it seemed like your average Izakaya bar with ramen comparable to Kinton - great vibes, music and hip atmosphere I ordered the pork ramen and was blown away by how tender and flavorful the pork was. The meat broke off beautifully and each marble of the pork belly was an indulgence.The waiter said the pork belly are boiled for 7-hours in a pork bone stew with other veggies and grill seared to crisp the edges. And I'm not even finished.The milky broth is the perfect balance of heartiness and freshness. You're also given pickled mustard greens, sesame chili oil, and ground sesame to customize your ramen to taste.For $13, I had one of the best ramens I've had in Montreal or Toronto. An easy recommendation for lunch or dinner with friends. Veggie options are also abundant."

The fixtures and modern, yet traditional furniture and walls are exciting to look at. My partner and I were very fixated on the beautiful murals on the walls. The staff did a good job. Water was refilled promptly most of the time. Best thing - the inside smelled like barbeque. My partner and I could barely hold on because we were so hungry. The main star was the food. Amazing, amazing food. We had the beef tataki, seaweed salad, pork belly, takoyaki, chicken skin, goat cheese, tuna cutlet and daikon kimchi (a special). The beef tataki was simply delicious. I really loved the way the flavours complemented each other. The tataki was tender. The seaweed salad had a very nice sesame dressing on it that was creamy. Loved how the seaweed was actually good portions of seaweed, not the usual stringy stuff they give you. The porky belly was a bit lacklustre. It was barbequed nicely but it barely had any flavour on it. Needed more marination. Or sauce on the side. The takoyaki stole the show. It certainly beat the quality of the takoyaki at one of my favourite places in the GTA. So crispy and well cooked. The chicken skin was amazing. I could eat a bowl of this any time. Crispy and well seasoned. The goat cheese was complemented well with the berry sauce. One of my favourites. The tuna cutlet was unique and tasty. Reminded me of home because of a certain herb used in Vietnamese culture. The daikon kimchi was good but it lacked that certain something. Perhaps more fermentation  and sour notes could have been improved on. Overall, a really good experience in a more modern izakaya. We left with our bellies full! Super full!"

They offer a decent amount of choices of ramen, deep fried and grilled food. Everything I've tried is always on point. Their large selection of sake and cocktails is for sure some of the best I've had. Also, you must try their sakebomb! Very fun if you are a group and everyone orders a sakebomb."
/user_details?userid=CwFebMF23wOAepWE38XACA,Tomer N.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,This is a really fun place. The sitting is a little crowded so you are basically sharing a table with the people next to you. I am not sure if they did it to maximize space or part of a Japanese tradition. The outcome is that you can not help it and you will hear your neighbors conversation and they will hear yours so might not be the perfect place for a romantic dinner or a date. If you do come as a group you can actually get a big table in a less crowded area. The cocktails (as you can see in my picture) are great about 9$ but they taste real good and they do make them with a punch. I also had the vegetarian dumplings which were so tasty and not that expensive (about 5$). This is a cool place and I would defiantly want to re-visit it.

I came back this year for my bday, mid-september. We were four and loved it too.First time I came here there was a lot of noise. (Thursday) There is this environment where the waiters yell to each other (in some asian I guess It's japanese). Of course you have to add-on the Shots : the famous Sake-Bomb so if there are quite a lot in a row that are ordered, it gets pretty pretty noisy and it's hard to have a conversation. If you do not go as a group, you might be sitting next to strangers, like in Asia ! This year we went on a Monday : it was much better for the noise level ! The food is really tasty and yummy. We love their sizzling beef, the really tasty pork belly skewers, the fried chicken, etc. With a good bottle of SAKE !! We always had good service even when we were the group of 15.This is good restaurant for groups and for sharing food !!"

We went specifically for some ramen after reading that theirs was pretty good. The inside of the restaurant was pretty neat and gave off a good vibe. I ordered the spicy chicken ramen. The server ended up informing us that there was a problem with our order and said that dessert was on them which was really kind, even though we didn't think we were waiting too long for our food. Once our food finally came out, I tried my ramen dish and it was very tasty! The broth was delicious and the egg was also really tasty. For dessert we had matcha ice cream. The ice cream was under what seemed to be a mochi like rice layer.

They have a nice selection of Japanese food: good ramen, tasty torched mackerel, decent black cod, ok okonomiyaki and takoyaki, a selection of uninspiring grilled items that are often burnt, and mochi and taiyaki. The servers are friendly, but seem overwhelmed and won't check on you during busy hours unless you wave at them. Most of the kitchen is open and visible to the customers-if you worry a lot about hygiene, this may not be the right place for you.They have a karaoke room downstairs and maintain a generally loud atmosphere (loud music + occasional banging on the table for their signature drink).

One of the best Japanese food I've ever had.We ordered so many dishes and most of em hit the right spot. Not even goin to bother describing what we ordered. It was 8 of us and we almost tried half the items on their menu.  The food is soooo awesome it makes miso hot....That was a bad one....I am soy soy sorry.

So soft and tender, and the sauce complements the tuna very well. Mutely flavourful.Takowasa is still my favourite dish from Imadake. I've had takowasa in other restaurants but not nearly as delicious as here! And only $5!! It is tiny but worth it. Their ratio of wasabi and octopus sashimi is perfect.I don't order takoyaki anymore because I concluded that North America cannot make delicious takoyaki. But they do make decent takoyaki here! Not perfect but they're quite alright.Desserts are absolutely delicious.I find the price for the food is 100% + 100% worth the value. Actually the prices are cheap for such good food! Ramen is only $13??? And it's surprisingly a big bowl! The bowl looks shallow but it's hallow all the way to the bottom with LOTS of noodles. Spicy ramen is like clear broth + spice. I didn't love the rare beef in the beef ramen, but the pork belly in my spicy ramen is soooooooo delicious. The first ramen on the menu (Imadake ramen) is the best.Service is A+++++++!!!!Sake bombs can become quite loud with the chanting and hammering of tables. The restaurant is vivid with energy all night long!Side note, I wholeheartedly agree with Jason M that the food does not compare to Guu.

We made reservations for 11:00 PM on a Saturday evening, and we were seated right away even though the place was packed. Imadake is the perfect place to grab a drink with a couple of friends. The staff were really friendly and service was surprisingly fast even though the place was crowded. Their 'sake bombs' seem to be quite popular too! Food we ordered:- Imadake Original Ramen ~$11.00 ( I highly recommend, the broth was so delicious!)- Takowasa/ Wasabi Octopus ~$4.00 (Interesting dish, it was spicy at first but the spicy taste disappears quite fast)- Aburi Shime Saba/ Blow torched Mackerel ~$6.50 (I love mackerel and this dish was cool because they blow torched the mackerel right in front of you!)- Soft Shell Crab ~$10.00 (Delicious) - Yuzu Tuna Tataki/Seared Tuna Sashimi ~$11.00 (Super delicious!) - Matcha Cheesecake ~$6.00 (The cheesecake was a little heavy for me) - Drink: Malibu Mango ~$9.00 (This drink was so delicious, I highly recommend) Overall: Imadake is a perfect place for drinks - especially if you're going with a large group of friends. I'd recommend making reservations ahead of time because the place is quite packed, even at 11:00 PM at night. All the servers were really friendly and service was quite fast! I'd recommend the imadake original ramen - super delicious/rich ramen broth, and the malibu mango drink!"

I had their jellyfish salad and the beef tataki ramen with original broth. The broth was just right, full of flavor but not too salty or greasy. I also love rare beef, so this was the ramen for me! The soft boiled egg was also excellent and made correctly. The ramen also came with a regular salad. The jellyfish was nice. From looking at the menu, it would seem like this would be a great place for dinner or late night Japanese pub food. I will have to come here if I'm ever in Montreal again.Service: Their wait staff are nice and friendly here. They are able to speak English. I got to the restaurant a bit early and they let me wait inside for the restaurant to open. The waitress even setup her own mobile hotspot for me to use as the restaurant's wi-fi was not working.Location: The restaurant is very easy to get to via subway.

You get welcome by all the staff cheerfully screaming a nice Japanese word that I did not understand. I'm guessing it meant hello or welcome. The decor is pretty nice with some cultural touches everywhere, tableware, beautiful mural, decorative sake bottle and very short schoolgirl skirts. The bad part was that I had to sit on a wooden crate thing. You need to order the 'Sake Bomb' a fun drink made from rice beer and, of course, sake. Now, the food. There's all kind of little plates you can order and also bigger plates like the best Ramen i have ever eaten, spicy and tasteful. I can't get enough of their octopus balls which melt in your mouth. Special mention to the Koroke, incredibly original fried potato croquette and my son's favorite. I particularly love the dried fish flakes you can find on most of the dishes. There lots of things worth trying or reordering. For me, it was a special diner because it was my first time out of the children's hospital in a long time.

This place has such a great energy and it doesn't hurt that the imadake ramen is simply divine. Even though we didn't have a reservation they were able to accommodate our party of 3 and we were lucky enough to sit at the bar which gave us an opportunity to see the food prep in action. I was mesmerized by the people who work here. They have endless energy and are able to keep up with their many customers. Everything was so fast, but didn't feel rushed. It's such a sensory atmosphere, stimulating to the eyes and ears. The whole staff was so attentive and friendly.

/user_details?userid=YOmyzxTFYULhTCHdDgWQRA,Cathy Yuqi G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Went there with high expectations, but I'm kinda disappointed :(I tried the imadake chashu ramen and the beef tongue with rice on the lunch menu. The ramen broth was really dense and thick, I enjoyed the first few spoons, but then combined with the chashu porc, it started to taste really greasy...As for the beef tongue, it was soooo salty, even the rice could not help reduce the oversaltyness. The tongue was a bit too hard and I had a really hard time chewing it.I think imadake is definitively a good place for the snacks though. The fried octopus balls was mushy in the inside, but there was small chunks of octopus that made the texture more varied. I highly recommand the fried chicken, and you definitely have to try it with the wasabi sauce. Usually I can't handle wasabi well, but the sauce was creamy and tasted a bit sweet and spicy, not strong at all. I'll probably come back to try more of the snacks, but I won't eat any full meal there anymore."

But something about the harsh light of day revealed some dust and strain I hadn't noticed while doing sake bombs before, and in the bathroom downstairs the toilet wouldn't flush and the tap on the sink was pulled out of its base and busted and there was some general grime. Not a huge deal but I think a bathroom reflects on the overall state of things in the kitchen and this one left me mildly worried."

Imadake definitely has fast service once the ball gets rolling as they have to meet the demand of so many people getting sake bombs and what not. I settled with a Tokyotini, which was very strong. Thanks for not holding back! The food overall was on par. Hot and straight from the kitchen. I think my favorite was the chicken skin and karaage. Well seasoned and warm, so nothing to complain about. The cake was more cream cheese than green tea though. SERVICE: A bit slow at first, but it did pick up. There were several birthdays going on at Imadake, so that would slow down service a bit. Overall courteous and efficient! Recommendation: Make a reservation, if you do not want to sit at the bar!"

A friend and I spent NYE dining on the chef's special and so we got to try an array of their popular dishes and each one was moist, flavourful and portions are just right; it's a tapas style restaurant so 3 to 4 dishes per person to share is more than enough. The black cod and octopus balls are by far a favourite. The drinks are good but I would opt for a sake if that's your thing too. The downside of this place is that it's loud, like really loud, and holding a conversation around people yelling before their ""sake bomb"", or lights out for a birthday cake, can be distracting. Most izakayas are loud either way but I return here since the food makes the experience tolerable. The service was good and friendly, and we left the restaurant content but no voices"
/user_details?userid=I5Obc5KP-GNA60QMPSupSQ,Haya K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We came to Imadake on a Friday night before a movie after seeing the positive reviews. The place was bustling and there was lots of laughter and music. It was a great ambience for a Friday night so we were having a good time. There were 2 of us and we ordered 7 dishes between us. We LOVE japaneese food, and east asian food in general so we were really looking forward to it.I think our favorite dish was the beef we cooked on the hot plate/ marble slab. It was tasty but also interactive which was cool. Otherwise, we ordered dumplings, squid, sausage, and a few other meat dishes but they were super mediocre. The squid was dry and rubbery, and the skewers were pretty flavourless and greasy. We really aren't very picky eaters, we generally love food but because we had high expectations we were disappointed."
/user_details?userid=fi38ETFUNBBndrkKqLqUtA,Tina M.,"Austin, TX",4 star rating,"After reading all the positive reviews, I figured I had to try Imadake! I went on a Wednesday night with my husband. The restaurant was pretty full. Noisy, dynamic yet trendy and welcoming sums up the ambiance. Being vegetarian, we ordered the veggie Yakiudon and the veggie Japanese Pancake. The noodles of the Yakiudon were fresh and tasty, and the Japanese Pancake was surprisingly delicious as well. Take note that the portions are small, so consider ordering a side dish if you have a bigger appetite. This place, being noisy and dynamic, is ideal for groups. If you're looking for a romantic tête-à-tête evening, you might want to reconsider your choice, however if you thrive in active environments, it might be just your perfect match! Their staff is super friendly and helpful, adding to the overall experience.Lastly, a tip for vegetarians: If you order the Japanese Pancake, make sure to order it without the fish flakes that would normally come on top. Additionally, their ramen soups have a fish/chicken base so you may want to consider their noodles instead."

I don't know if my expectations were simply too high but I was underwhelmed.I went with some of my best girlfriends and we still have a good time - but the experience was just not 5 stars.Menus were kinda... grubby? Some of the plates we shared were good, the black cod was outstanding... But others were so average. The salad (I think it was sesame?) was pretty sad. The fried veggies were just disappointing - sure, they're big pieces but some chunks were undercooked. I actually bit on a soggy piece at some point wahhhhh. Thankfully washed it out with a swig of ginger beer. Tried the veggie dumplings as well; ok, but nothing that exciting.Drinks were actually a strong point. There were a bunch of Japanese-themed cocktails (I liked the Tokyotini) and of course, sake (and whiskey!).So I would say this place is good for a party with a group of friends, or even for celebrating your birthday (they do this cool thing where they turn off the lights and bring you cake; happened 3 or 4 times over the course of the evening). Most people go for the sake bombs. But to me, the novelty kinda wore off after the first time we ordered a round.Also, some things to keep in mind (deal-breakers for me): this place gets LOUD, so much so that I had a hard time hearing my friend sitting across the table. Also, restrooms were NOT clean... And you know what that usually says about the kitchen :("
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Imadake, in my ever-fervent quest for good Japanese food in Montréal, doesn't quite hit the spot, but it's nevertheless a decent place in my opinion. I brought my parents here for an American Thanksgiving dinner (no turkey included, unfortunately), and its cozy, dim-lit vibe definitely hit all of the right notes on the ambience front.After getting our drinks, we ordered eight plates to share among the three of us - the tonkatsu ramen, octopus salad, gindara (broiled cod), yakitori, tsukune patties, pork okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and agedashi tofu. Since the owners of Imadake also run Yokato Yokabai, I was excited to try the ramen; however, it came in an even smaller portion than the one at Yokato for seemingly the same price, and the taste wasn't as flavorful as Yokato's either. In addition, the octopus salad seemed rather small for what we were paying (around $5), and it seems to carry way too much wasabi in one bite (it actually numbs your mouth, and that's coming from someone with a high spice tolerance). Also, the gindara was quite small and less firm than I would have liked it to be, but it had a nice, smoky flavor and the charred skin was arguably the best part, as it was slightly sweet and provided a nice contrast to everything else we had.Having said all of that, not all of the food was so-so by any means. The yakitori was very juicy and had that really nice grilled chicken taste that's essential for good skewers, and the chicken and pork flavors of the tsukune both came through in a smoky, herby delight. I was most excited to try the okonomiyaki since I've never had it before, and while it was good, I didn't think that there was much pork in there, if any. I did like the interesting texture with the vegetables and how it was different from the crispy outside, though, and I thought the bonito flakes were especially tasty and made it that much better. The takoyaki were perfect little balls of seafood-y goodness, with actual octopus chunks in the middle (some of my favorite things in the world) and a crisp outside that still makes me salivate when thinking about biting into its soft center. The mayonnaise is also a nice touch and reminds me of French fries dipped in mayo, but so much better. Finally, the agedashi tofu was one of the better ones that I've had, with its hot center going very well with the the cool, crisp radish and saltiness of the soy sauce.Overall, I liked Imadake for what it's worth, although it's definitely a place for you to take your parents if you want a full meal as opposed to just drinks and some snacks. It can get very expensive very quickly as the total bill came to a little over $100, not including tip, so it's not the most ideal place for poor university students. It has a cool atmosphere and fun signature drinks like the sake bomb, but it can get loud pretty quickly as a result. I give extra bonus points to them for playing cool 80's music throughout the night, however, as I found it impossible to not sing along to my favorite tunes the whole night."

Oh right and a squawking 5 month old. Determined to let not this faze us (and because honestly it took so much effort and walking to get there), we still had dinner. Fortunately it was SO loud at this place, no one could hear my son and he somehow managed to fall asleep despite the loud music and groups banging on the table shouting SAKE BOMB! This meant my husband and I enjoyed a wonderful dinner! We ordered five tapas style plates including a buttery black cod, steak, and wasabi chicken. All the dishes we tried were really good, but fall short of the 5 star mark. Try the ramune- a carbonated Japanese non-alcoholic drink which comes in a very interesting and quite genius bottle.

Imadake has given me a love of octopus balls and yuzu beer cocktails. Yuzu is a sour japanese orange / a magic spell you cast on shitty beer in order to make tasty. Also, that sweet, sweet, porc belly ramen with the thick and hearty, spicy broth. I don't think i've ever left my ramen bowl with anything in it, broth or otherwise, when I've visited Imadake.Imadake may be my favourite restaurant in the city, particularly during the week or on Sunday nights when its a little less packed.

They serve a large selection of Japanese Tapas but expect to pay a lot for an average quality. Their ramen are way too salty and thick (I couldn't finish them). The only thing that kept bringing me back to Imadake was their rainbow bombs but even then, they are not the cheapest drinks around."

Doesn't matter... we ordered a bunch of dishes and ginger beers; happy again. Their chicken skins were perfectly seasoned and crispier than the colonel's, the spicy shrimp tempura was battered and fried to a beautiful golden brown, octopus balls were bursting with flavour, jellyfish salad was something I had no idea could taste so wonderful... you get the point. Flash forward to tonight. Second attempt at Imadake poutine. Made a reservation no problems, got there, ordered. They have it. soexcited.gif. Comes to our table with a smile. Bonito flakes are dancing atop a pile of homefries, swimming with gravy and blanketed with squishy curds of that good good white stuff - curd life - the whole rested upon a shrimp and ginger pancake (like a pajun but better). Chopsticks up, forks down, poutine smiles all around. TL;DR Best poutine I've ever eaten. Best poutine I'll ever have."

/user_details?userid=u4iBXHU_ZCUIXymxkcsHdA,Jessica M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"When you walk into the izakaya, there is a huge coat rack on the right hand side of the wall where most people hang their outer coats. I'm not a huge fan of public coat racks (I always have a fear that someone will snatch my coat up) so I didn't use it, but the coat rack is free so you should definitely take use of it if you don't mind!The waiters, chefs, bartenders all greet to you in one large voice which is typical at Japanese restaurants. This always makes me blush a little. Hubby and I were seated very quickly and we dived for the menu. The menu was in two parts: the regular menu, and the 'Chef's menu' which also looked like a comic strip. There were so many delicious looking tapas that we wanted to try, so we had a pretty difficult time narrowing it down to a few.We decided to order 3 tapas to start, then we ended up ordering dessert, which we weren't planning on having! The waiter was very prompt, and always alert, which brought us fast service. My hubby was able to flag down a waiter almost immediately which satisfied both of us since we were very hungry that night.We started off with mackerel sashimi, one of my favourites. When not done right, the fish can be a bit hard to eat because of its distinct scent and taste, but here at Imadake, it was done right. The waiter, after bringing it to our table, blowtorched the sashimi right in front of us which made all neighbouring tables turn their heads. We couldn't wait to eat it as we saw it torched in front of our eyes! The taste was amazing; it had a distinct vinaigrette taste to it although there wasn't any vinaigrette on it. This taste was because they added lemon juice on top of the mackerel, taking away a lot of its distinct taste so that it is easier to eat. The fish almost melted in our mouths and we definitely knew that the plate of sashimi was not a portion to share!The tuna tataki was done very well, just cooked enough on the outside to provide it a different texture yet keep the inside very moist and delicate as sashimi should be. The yuzu sauce marinade was very tasty, and we were both happy with how sweet yet fresh it was. When the tuna tataki was eaten together with the marinade and shredded onions, it was very refreshing and we were able to enjoy multiple textures which balanced everything out. As an ending note, there were pink pepper (the small pink balls on top of the tataki) which was a great contrast to the sweet and sour tastes of the dish.We are a fan of ramen, especially good ramen. Here at Imadake, their miso broth was very rich and savoury. The portion of the ramen was surprisingly large relatively compared to other tapas we had ordered. The pork belly was quite soft but still chewy, pretty average. If we were to compared Imadake ramen to regular ramen houses, the only downside would be the price: since Imadake is a tapas-oriented place, for the price you pay, the portion is smaller to what you would get at a regular ramen house; however, the taste is just as good if not better than some of the many ramen places we have tried in Montréal!After our bowl of ramen, I really wanted to try Imadake's taiyaki parfait, as I had been craving the traditional taiyaki dessert for awhile. The actual taiyaki was the real stuff and it tasted just how I imagined it. The cake batter was very fluffy and the sweet filling was just how I remembered. On top of the taiyaki, there was vanilla ice cream with raspberry syrup, which was a great balance, since the taiyaki was pretty hot inside. The coldness of the ice cream played very well with the hot sweet red bean paste in my mouth, and I was one happy girl. The raspberry syrup was a surprise, as I didn't expect it to go so well with taiyaki. The strawberry pocky and frosted flakes at the very bottom of the parfait provided much needed crunchy texture to the dessert, and also acted as a good ending note.Would I order it again? Yes. Although I really want to try their other Asian-inspired desserts!"
/user_details?userid=KMMyrKc269Ar5aCdG_eMHQ,James S.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Another disappointment! $60 per person and probably the worst Izakaya I've tried!  I don't think there was one dish that comes to mind that was good. At the end you're just eating to get full because you know you spent so much money on bad food. The beef tongue was pretty good but every other dish was just not good. The soft shell crab was soggy from the oil and not crispy; the beef on the hot stone slab was bland (and the sauce that came with it was nasty); the sausage was ok; deep fried chicken with wasabi mayo (way too much wasabi and tasted water down); beef slices with some ginger sauce (ginger sauce was gross).I would say the worst was the Ramen. Bland soup and it still had the flour dough taste from the noodles. Disgusting! It looks amazing then once you taste it you want to throw up!I don't know if it's because their chef is a really old asian guy. I think he needs to retire because his taste buds were off.It should be a 1.5 star rating just because they had the beef tongue dish but not enough for 2 starsYelpers, once again you disappoint with your ratings!"

He very patiently helped us to narrow down our order, and it turned out to be a perfect amount for us.  Our food came out as soon as each dish was ready and it worked out very well for us - especially the ramen that came out early for my toddler.  Here's what we had:- my son's pork belly ramen with original broth (made with meat bones) - a very good, rich broth with chewy noodles, very tasty pork and bamboo shoots, and bean spouts.  There was a delicious looking half of an egg in there too but my son ate it all so I cannot testify as to how good it was.- the special dish of soba noodles wrapped in seaweed with (tempura?) shrimp inside, and the whole thing was fried.  This was an unusual dish, but it surprised me because I loved it, especially with the sauce it was served with.- sea bass marinated in miso for three days - YUM.  You must order this.- my black sesame seed ice cream was THE BEST of it's kind I've ever had.  It's opaque black, not the weak looking versions I've tried at home. As my dad said in Chinese, ""it's very fragrant"", which means the flavor is very good.  You must also order this...!All of the following were delicious small plates that we'd order again:- beef cooked on a hot stone- skewered chicken- skewered chicken with plum sauce- skewered sausage- grilled squid- vegetable tempuraThis place served us a great parting dinner in the form of many small and delicious plates to share.  If we lived in Montreal, I can tell you that my husband and I would be regulars here."

The food is exactly like I remembered it, the service is great and the prices are decent. The drinks are a little pricey but it is absolutely worth it for the atmosphere and the authentic food. So many food items are a must have, but I highly recommend the takoyaki (tiny pieces of octopus in a dumpling ball with a salty sauce) even if you're not a fan of seafood it is a delight!The spicy ramen was equally delicious with the perfect cook on the boiled egg in it. Yummy spicy broth-y egg-y goodness! I wanted to eat 3 more bowls!Their okonomiyake ( Japanese ""pancake"") was good, I'm used to the Hiroshima version which has noodles underneath but you could REALLY taste the pickled radish it it and it was delicious.With echoes of Sake BOMB in the background, this place is great if you're looking for genuine Japanese izakaya food.

Assigning a dollar value might be a silly proposition, sure, but it's an earnest one too.  Whatever your magic number is, I'd wager that it's orders of magnitude greater than the $25 I spent here a few nights ago.  Aside from the cool décor, the first thing I noticed about Imadake was the massive fun everyone was having.  The second we stepped in, it felt like tectonic plates shifted under us.  Turns out, it was just patrons chanting and pounding the tables during rounds of the Sake Bombs - something like Imadake's spin on the Irish Carbomb.  By the end of the night, I was absolutely drenched in alcohol: half it from multiple rounds of Sake bombs sloshing onto my shirt, the other half from a ruptured beerstein that spilled an ice-cold Sapporo all over my pants.  And you know what? I didn't mind at all.  The staff and owner rocked.  The latter was kind enough to slash a sizable chunk off my tab, but gave me a few free drinks for the mishap.  I dare you to have a bad time here.  All told, I left this place soaked in beer and good vibrations in equal measure. Easily one of the best drinking experiences I've ever had."

That being said, I'm pescatarian but there's still quite a lot of choices and the oyster mushrooms are delicious and the fried mashed potatoes are awesome. All though I do find their alcohol choices limited but definitely not limited in the sake cold and hot. Best to make a reservation for sure and don't go eat there if you want to eat quickly."

The highlight for eating there has to be the sake bombs, and they have some serious triple decker setups for you to pound down and pound down (drink-wise).  The staff are totally on point service, complete with towels to wipe up any splashed drinks and flyaway chopsticks and returning everything to normal for you to enjoy your meal and drinks. My friend secretly asked them to get me a matcha green tea cheese cake because it was my bday and all of a sudden all the lights went out and then the staff start singing happy birthday much like the way they chant out the sake bomb.  The food portions are pretty good and all my guests who've never been there before all enjoyed their experience.

So we settled for food, which the menu offered mostly tapas like skewers, and cold dishes. They're all reasonable prices but the amount you need to order to make you're self full can be pricey, so our group actually ended up getting the tonkotsu ramen. I got it with beef, which was so good but I wish they offered larger portions. I think this is a great place for people that have a better budget then students. Anyways cool experience."

Imadake is not even on the same level as the izakayas in Toronto are much better! (I'm thinking about Kingyo and even Guu). The portions at Imadake are much smaller compared to Toronto. The food generally lacks flavour. The atmosphere left something to be desired - it's loud which I expect from all izakayas but all I heard throughout my meal was SAKE BOMB SAKE BOMB SAKE BOMB.We sat at the bar and our service was attentive. The employees seem decent but they all looked like they were just university students or graduates.We ordered the following:1) Karaage ($9) - Small pieces of chicken which were not moist/juicy inside. It lacked flavour on it's own. I wasn't a fan of the wasabi mayo but you really have to put that on to get some kind of flavour. 2) Ebimayo ($8) - Shrimp were very small. This one was sort of interesting because it had some nuts and  greens to top off the shrimp which is different than what I am use to. I thought this was pricey for the serving we received. :s3) Yuzu Chicken ($6) - Again, very small pieces of chicken which lacked flavour and tasted like it was deep fried to hell. The fried batter was very dark and almost too crunchy. It tasted like terrible popcorn chicken. 4) Takoyaki ($7) - Small balls of octopus. This one was alright although I'm not sure if this was made fresh because it resembles store bought takoyaki with flat bottoms rather than round spheres. 5) Spicy ramen ($12) - The only good dish that I really enjoyed for the meal. This wasn't a huge bowl but I wasn't expecting it to be. The broth was very flavourful."

Keep in mind that the serving staff really think they're hot shit. On my recent visits I found them not particularly friendly or engaging, instead they're just sort of prideful and even a little douchey. In terms of food, if you want to sample pretty much exactly what authentic izakayas in Japan serve, this is it. From the takoyaki to the okonomiyaki to the takowasa, to the kara age... It's all authentic and delicious.They also have a house special known as the sake bomb. I don't remember much aside from blasting a few and singing, one thing leading to another and waking up the next morning next to a beautiful girl from Shizuoka.

/user_details?userid=E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,Pat R.,"Las Vegas, NV",4 star rating,"Quick Japanese lesson for everyone:IMADAKE means ""only now""I guess that this is a fitting name due to 2 reasons: 1. the YOLO attitude when it comes to drinking here. Everyone (mostly everyone) was having a good time getting blasted here.2. Possibly because of the limited time food special that they have. Whatever your theory about the name, this place is a real find! I was surprised to find real Japanese food in Montreal. During my tine in Montreal, it was apparent that they love sushi. Of course 90% of it is Americanized/Canadianized which is not appealing to me.Jonzing for rice and a taste of the motherland I ventured to this place.To my surprise the food here is pretty authentic. I won't say that it's straight out the motherland but pretty close for being 7000 miles away! Just in case you don't know I am super picky when it comes to Japanese food. I am all about authenticity when it comes to my home food so any seal of approval on authenticity is a HUGE seal of approval.. If you don't like it, go back to your favorite teriyaki hole.  I was by myself so I just picked off of the izakaya menu. Tori no kawa (chicken skin) was nice and crispy w/ lots of flavor. It was served in appetizer format vs the traditional kushi style (on a stick)Char-Siu ramen was actually very tasty and chocked full of char siu. Borderline motherland legit (Yes, this is a awesome compliment). Outside of the food, this seems like a hip place to take a few friends to kill a few brain cells with sake bombs. During my visit all I could hear was tables slamming and people chanting Sake Bomb, Sake Bomb.... Anyhow this place is about as close to Japan I got during my stay in Montreal. Come here for a good time and real Japanese food."

I made a reservation less than a week in advance for 18 and they happily accommodated us. Food is on point, good for sharing and hogging alike.  Drinks, the sake bombs especially, are legit.  We avoided the specialty cocktails as our waitress said they were very sweet, but the beers and run-of-the-mill cocktails (jack and coke, gin and tonic, etc.) were nice. Waitresses were in plaid skirts which, for a bachelor party of 18 was... Well, y'know. Don't think a single one of us had a complaint about the food, drinks, or service.  Oh, and they were nice enough to split our enormous bill for each of us based on what we ordered! Great time, highly recommended!"

Among my usual orders that include the ebimayo, takoyaki, and karaage, this evening my friends and I also ordered the grapefruit and dungeness crab salad that was absolutely amazing, as well as the tsukune that was grilled to perfection. The salad had a great a balance between the citrus and crab, while the tsukune (mix of pork and chicken) just melts in your mouth. Make sure you order them next time, you will not be disappointed!Being a fairly large group, we of course ordered a few large sake bombs... we started off with regular ones, and topped off the night with large rainbow sake bombs. In between, we had a few pints of sapporo that are served on tap.This place never disappoints, the more people the merrier... so come one, come all!"

I personally don't like shrimp tempura only because it's so heavy but the way they make it at Imadake it's light and perfect!! Also had the steak and that was delicious. Their sauces for the salad to the steak to just every dish is so tasty they need to sell their sauces separately because I would love to take some home! They also had the bust customer service! They allowed us to keep our stroller next to us while our 7 month old joined us. #loveMTLfood

/user_details?userid=1Bljt-GngRP4XxkQFLnHHQ,Rod M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I'd been to Imadake a few times shortly after they had opened (yes back when they were called Godzilla's) and thought that the restaurant was good but nothing special. I had dinner there with some friend on Sunday evening and I was very pleasantly surprised. Imadake has really come into its own. Apparently I'm not the only one that thinks this as the place was packed on a Sunday evening. Based on the crowd you would have thought that it was Friday night. The atmosphere was fun and lively the service was good and not overbearing and the food was terrific. As I'm writing this I'm wondering why I'm giving Imadake 4 and not 5 stars, but it feels like the right rating.  The menu and the food has matured since I first ate there. There are many great options on the menu, the food is fresh and tasty and the presentation is good. Many of the reviews compare Imadake to Kazu. I guess this is a natural thing to do as they are both Japanese restaurants in the same part of town at similar price points. However, I think that this is a bit of an apples to oranges comparison as these are two very distinct restaurants with there own approach to Japanese cuisine and each offer a very different experience. They are certainly not interchangeable. Now that I've thought about Kazu (a definitive 5 star restaurant) I know why I was comfortable with a 4 star rating for Imadake. Imadake is a great restaurant where you'll have a fun time and enjoy some great (and reasonably priced) food.  Enjoy an evening with some friend and be sure to order the Saki Bomb."

I'd rather go to Kinka."
/user_details?userid=n0BvHtkwU36epkS8NJ8sqg,Al L.,"Folsom, CA",2 star rating,"We went here because of the good reviews and because they were one of the places still open past 11:00 PM.  Upon arriving, we noticed the place was completely packed, which was a good sign.  We went in, and was finally able to get a seat after about 20 minutes.  We didn't have a reservation, but the place still wasn't very organized in getting us a seat.  At one point they even told us that they had some seats ready, brought us back there to find out that it wasn't ready.So when we finally sat down, we ordered some ramen and some yakisoba.  The ramen arrived quickly, but the yakisoba took forever to arrive.  In addition, both items, especially the ramen, were very salty.  They had put way too much salt in the ramen, and aside from that, it didn't have much taste.  In a previous review, it said the ramen was by far the best in Montreal.  If this is the best ramen in Montreal, then I definitely don't want to try any other ramen in Montreal ever again.  I've had MUCH better ramen in any other city with a decent-sized Asian population.  The yakisoba was a little better, but still had too much sodium.The service overall was a bit slow.  It was understandable since the place was packed with people getting drunk off their sake bombs, but the waitress still took a long time to notice we were waiting for the check long after we were done, even after walking past us a few times.I understand how this place could be a great atmosphere to hang out if you're with the crowd that wants to down sake bombs until piss drunk (which is the only part that allowed me to give the place 2 stars), but if you just want to grab a meal, I'd definitely look elsewhere."

Luckily we were still able to get a table without waiting because, well, it's Sunday night and it's 10 degrees outside.We had the tuna special, agedashi tofu, grilled beef tongue, and grilled bacon-wrapped asparagus for appetizers. Then we split the char siu ramen, and ended with the green tea cheesecake. Loved the taste of everything, especially the tuna special. The ramen broth is as good as any I've ever had. Things I wished were better: 1) The agedashi tofu arrived at the table with most of the crispy skin already soggy. 2) Bacon-wrapped asparagus was slightly overcooked. 3) Better staggering of dishes, especially since the table for 2 was rather small.The vibe and decor were great. The chairs were brilliant and came with a compartment for you to put your bag in. If you like sake bombs, you'd appreciate their sake bomb services.

The food is solid; I highly recommend the Gindara (miso marinated black codfish).Of course, part of the fun is to do the sake bombs, which is when it gets very loud (WHEN I SAY ""SAKE"" YOU SAY ""BOMB""! SAKE BOMB x 3). Personally I am not big on sake bomb or sake for that matter but they have a full bar so no complaint from me there!Staff was nice and put up with our table with 2 little kids moving around without rolling their eyes, which is cool.

From what I can recall it was a lively atmosphere that our group definitely added to.  Service was great; I even think the owner/manager came by with some comp shots.Bottom line is if you're looking for some pretty good food and a really good time, Imadake is the perfect spot to kick off the party."

Everything was good, but the steak and ramen were the best. The broth for the ramen was a bit salty, but other than that everything was top notch. The steak is amazingly tender and they season it perfectly, because you also dip it into a shoyu dipping sauce. Prices are average for downtown."

Amazing atmosphere.This place is hip, fun and a cool urban spot everyone must check out in MTL.Food is great. A lot of their food is Cooked on a charcoal grill and has amazing, full flavors. Its tapas style so you can order a lot of smaller dishes and taste test a bunch of different things!Its asian fusion so you would have to like those kind of flavors to enjoy the food to its fullest.Great urban decor, and this place has an upbeat, party kind of vibe. Great for birthday groups, but maybe not so much for a first date. It is VERY loud, some people might find it bothersome. But if you are lame and don't like to have a good time when you go out, stay home and order in, this place won't be for you. Going in a group is best. Or as a couple if you are down to have a couple drinks and let loose. Service is a bit slow sometimes, it is always at full capacity with reservations and walk ins. I suggest Strongly to make a reservation.They have a private party room that fits up to 30 people you can reserve if you are a huge group, there is a MASSIVE TV in their so you can watch the game if you wanted. (only tv in the restaurant is in the private room)All in all, I give Imadake 5 stars because I believe it's a MUST check out spot that I would guarantee people enjoy.

Their seafood salads were excellent also with the earthy sesame seed dressing.The menu is cut up in two sections, those small appetizer-like dishes of which you can order many and share with a friend, think of it as Japanese tapas. The other side is the hefty Ramen noodle soups and meals. Desserts have the predictable green tea ice cream, red bean ice cream and black sesame ice cream, as  well as the green tea cheesecake.Japanese beers here are resonably priced but not a lot of selection if you're a non-beer drinker.It's a fun place to try out, I really liked the way the whole bar basically yelled out  ""Arigato"" (Thank you)  when you leave."

Fantastic job!OK, first things first. We had ""Takowasa"" as the appetizer. It was prepared with octopus and wasabi They made it with octopus and wasabi which wakes your appetite from the deep.

Juicy , crispy,creamy, while taking some Plum wine then you'll feel them splashing in your stomach.And something you can skip: Dashi Chazuke Eel ( $8 for two tiny pieces of eel is too much! ) , Isobe Mochi, Oba to baniku.For keep myself in some suspense that I leave the ramen for the next time.

It is a high-volume noise restaurant, in part just because of the dynamics of the actual interior design that seems to bounce around the echoes of conversations, in part due to the fact that as the night goes on the high-energy of the place becomes contagious and the civilised rowdiness is catching. the sake bomb shenanigans that is Imadake's schtick may have something to do with that as well. So yeah, you've been warned. It's loud. In a good way.All of the dishes I've had there were tasty and the Green Tea Cheese Cake is a guaranteed mouthparty. I've been several times and still haven't tried everything. There's a solid variety of options for meateaters and vegheads alike. Because of the nature of the tapas-type dishes that encourage you to share it's definitely best had with friends and an affordable way to be satisfied without getting overstuffed.Don't go here expecting a fancy-schmancy dinner or a good place for an intimate date, but bring a few friends and you will have a riot. The staff are friendly, fun and helpful, and service has always been speedy. Order Sake bombs. Just trust me... the staff go all out for those and it's cheesy good fun.Non-vegatarian must-haves: Ashi chazuke with smoked salmon, yakitori, takoyaki, beef tataki with ponzu sauceVegetarians must-haves: the mushrooms, mixed vegetable tempura, goat cheese with raspberry maple syrup, green salad with ginger dressing, seaweed salad, vegetable gyoza dumplings, korokke, agedashi tofu(I'm vegetarian so can recommend more of those options, but the meat recommends are based on my friends' reactions)Only downside... the hard wood benches and seating made my badonkadonk fall asleep like I was sweating in a church pew again.

It was a cross between dried seaweed and vermicelli noodle. It was very salty, make sure to have it with another main dish. It does cleanse the palate.- Yuzu chicken: It's fried chicken, the batter however isn't tempura, it's rice cracker... Nothing special. The chicken was tender inside the crispy outside.- Beef on hot stone: best dish of the evening. It was beautifully marinated and fresh. And how cool is cooking raw beef on a super hot stone? The sauce was too much. It was really salty. Try it without first.- Oyster mushroom ramen with original sauce: It was ok. Ramen was nicely done at al-dente but the broth lacked sophistication really. It lacked purity in its flavour. I would have assumed a clear broth but it was murky... Maybe try it with miso next time?As they say ""toriaezu biru!!!!!!!!""

/user_details?userid=kgvTkSGVXS78xypSG8o-Bw,Pascal T.,"North Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"I came out of Imadake feeling like a blimp. The emergency lights were going off as this blimp was having problems walking to his car. I was stuffed. I obviously tried one too many items on the menu and I can only blame my gluttony for that. What I liked the most at Imadake was the freshness of the ingredients. You can tell they select good ingredients for their dishes and that, to me, shows a high level of dedication to not only their food but also their customers. Ingredients are probably the easiest place to cut costs but that is definitely not going on at Imadake as each element feels and tastes like it was made and sourced on the same day.I tried the miso ramen with butter corn and both the potato and corn korroke (the latter is what sent this blimp into overloaded territory). I especially loved the korrokes and would go back to Imadake if only to have them again. Perfect frying. Perfectly crispy, light batter. Delicious. If you go there you need to have both.The ramen was above average when it comes to Montreal fare based on the handful of others I have tried (I have yet to try Kazu's since they only serve it during weekday lunches). Noodles were good. Broth had a rich buttery taste and deep well rounded flavors. Toppings are a bit on the low side as a default so I suggest adding extras and definitely ask for chili to add to it as it rounds out the flavors very nicely.Ambiance is what you'd expect from this type of establishment. It's loud - personally, not my thing but it certainly adds a buzz to the experience. Service was reasonably good. More like a pub type of service. Expect the waiters to place their whole arm across your face while filling your glass of water instead of going on the other side of the table. The type of stuff only some people would notice and by some people I mean people like me who are probably quite picky about service. They're certainly nice enough and the service was quick but it's important to keep your expectations in check when it comes to the details. It is what it is.Overall I can definitely recommend Imadake. They serve tasty / fresh food. Nuff said? Vegetarian food: 4 Hindenburgs out of 5Service: 3.5 Arms in yo face out of 5Value: 4.0"

I give it three stars because of a few things I noticed that I really didn't like. But first, let's talk about the positive:Cocktails are very good and cheap ($8). I had the Hello Kitty which is guava/lime juice etc and it tasted like a smoothie. My friend had a lychee martini and that was good too. Tofu salad was small but packed a punch. It was crispy, delicious, and whatever sauce they put in it was amazing. I really enjoyed the seaweed salad too.Now the negative:I did not appreciate the hot and cold service. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. But on the other hand, the waiter that served me my drink was super cold and did not even give me eye contact.  He came back again the second time. and again did not give any eye contact. nor smile. nor did he say anything. Maybe he wasn't a waiter. maybe he was a busser? It doesn't matter. You should still at least LOOK at your customer.  Second negative point, the ramen was not available to order. Basically it wasn't ready yet. I think when you open your doors to the public, your ramen should be made available. I thought it was quite unprepared of them to not have something like a main dish ready to serve. I'd go again to try other dishes and for drinks maybe. But that's a maybe."

This was probably the loudest place I have ever been to in my life, which includes concerts, dance clubs and standing inside of a jet engine.The food was pretty excellent though! I don't know the names but we got a beef thing that you cook on an extremely hot rock, the rock stays hot for like 15 minutes wowzaaaa! Delicious.

/user_details?userid=jgRwa4uTwIL7vCzHE8LITw,Martin V.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We went to this Japanese style pub on Saturday night and we unfortunately had to wait 20 minutes at our table before anyone took our order for drinks. This was frustrating considering part of the floor staff was not busy and just moved around without paying attention. We ordered multiple dishes and asked to have some served as appetizers to ensure we keep the most spicy ones for the end. Disappointedly, the dishes arrived out of order. For the good points, there is a large selection of sakes and other drinks at fair prices. The dishes are well presented and most are yummy without being exceptional. The venue is pretty big and can accommodate large groups with plenty of lengthy tables. All in all, this is a mixed bag and not among my favourite Izakayas. Would only go again for drinks or before seeing a movie at the nearby movie theatre."

Naaaaaaah !!!! lolOn this point i agree with Concertina F. but whereas none of Kazu's dishes disapoint   SOME dishes at Imadake do... and this despite the damn lineup at kazu, their habit of constant price INFLATION, their limited menu, no fried items  and their cash only policy...On to the food... :)we had, ramen, beef tongue, chicken karaage, jelly fish salad, eel soup, eel omelet, agedashi tofu, bacon wrapped asparagus, and tempura.of note is the beef tongue, quite delicious, tender and good flavor, I know I kissed a cow... And I liked it :P. The jelly fish salad was nice, refreshing, light and refreshing, except the portion was unforgivably small.The rest was just all right nothing spectacular, one miss is the omelet, too much sugar, It's an omelet not flan!!! lol :PTempura was average, but really no one messes that one up... well except hot and spicy buffet, where it's as big as a celery stick and mostly batter lol.chicken was good, but I like chicken karaage, so it was fine, but I've had better, at sumo ramen and ichiban. the eel soup was another miss, the dashi was weak, no flavor depth, but the eel was good.The agedashi was good, good soy sauce dashi, and the tofu was silky.The bacon asparagus was a bit on the bland side, a dash of teriyaki or miso would have been nice.Final verdict? more style than substance, small dishes... but nice drinks."

We then sat for another 10 minutes with no menu, and when we waved someone down for a menu, he looked at us blankly and then said ""I'll give you the menus?"" .

Now first off I'm all too aware that all Japanese Izakiya's are suppose to be loud but I find for whatever the reason that all 3 times that I have been there it becomes annoyingly loud, last time being by far the worst with staff members that had finished their shifts sitting with friends and standing by while their friends used some pretty foul language at very loud levels. I also find that Imadake has a great selection on their menu but that every meal is missing that one component that could make it just perfect.All and all I do really enjoy Imadake but feel they need to still tweak a couple of things before they get a perfect 5 from me."

We went with a group of about 10 people on a Thursday night and I found the service to be good and the food to be quite tasty. I really enjoyed the Tuna sashimi that was on there special house menu and the fact that you can get a litre of beer for a very reasonable price (but I of course forget what this price was :P). Eat. Drink. And be merry!
/user_details?userid=wT873xegSM080vMe6mUV-g,Chen S.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"The 5-star is based on the assumptions that 1) you are down for a REAL Nihon-bar night experience, which means2) you are tolerant of LOUD people, and cute(and/or hot) Asian girls in short uniform skirts running around who might miss orders sometimesI'm down for both so I gave it a 5*First of all, the food is, IMO, very close to what Japan has to offer. Make sure you order Karrage, and Okonomiyaki. They are Delish! - Okonomiyaki is this Japanese pancake made from eggs, shredded cabages, Dashi(Japanese cooking broth), meat (as far as I remember u get the option of octopus, squid or chicken), with the following topping - zigzagging Mayo, green onions and bonito  (some kind of fish) flakes flying on top. the presentation and the taste is definitely A+. - the Karrage I ordered was this deep-fried chicken pre-marinated in, probably soy sauce and garlic, with flour coating. I ate it with this garlic, soysauce dipping. hmm,hmm, tastay~ - I also ordered the pork-belly noodle soup. It's light but tasty to my taste buds, but some people might consider it bland.  Second, make sure you go there for dinner on weekends; Once I went for lunch, only to find out they are only open for dinner on weekends. Something worth noticing of this place is: late at night, you might see a group of people doing shots, where they place little shots glass gently on top of two chopsticks that are stacked on top of some bigger beer mugs. The seismic wave created by either hitting the table, or probably just people yelling/cheering drop the shots glass into the beer mugs. This might explain why this place gets very loud sometimes.  Decor is all simplistic, industrial style, high ceiling with a lot of wood elements (which I appreciate a lot), Utensils and dishwares seem to be authentic Japanese style. Last but NOT least, brace yourself for the chorus of greetings when you arrive and when you leave. Home-run for Imadake!"

The miso marinated black cod was perfectly seasoned and cook. It was moist, flaky and melted into my mouth. Beef tataki was tender and perfectly sliced. The fried goat cheese had some kind of fruity sweet sauce on top (prolly a raspberry/red fruit coulis) and it was balancing the saltyness of the goat cheese (you should order that along with a salad and mix em' together like we did. The sea weed and sesame dressing salad was good but a bit underseasoned (mixed with the goat cheese tho it was perfect). We also had some kind of fried octopus balls topped with smoked sturgeon flakes. They we're juicy, well fried, overall.. Lot of flavors! Chicken with plum sauce was surprising because we thought that would be sweet and sour but it was more sour and acidic. It was kinda good but not my favorite (execution of the meal was perfect still).Service was fast and friendly even if we waited a bit for our beer ( they had problem with the draft so I can't penalize them for that). They also offered us a sake bomb at end (witch was not necessary) so it show that they really care about their customer. Will I come back? Yes! I'm going back next week to try more!"

/user_details?userid=sFJjEc7ytSUV28Y7PpdMjQ,Mathieu B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Version Française après.Number one: There was no food poisoning and no mistake in my orders! So i hope this kind of kill the other that gave ridiculous small marks.  IMO if you say on a public thread you got food poisoning from a restaurant maybe there is something else to it: Like taking too much alcohol, having the flu, being sick from something else, anyway!Yesterday was one of my new struggle when i decide on Japanese food but new place versus one tried more than once ...Imadake won. First, the Decor kind of remind me of M:BGR second of all, I kind of stuck comparing meal with Kazu which is their competition who has been on open for a long time and has a way smaller place than imadake. So without going into deep description, i will say that this place scores the same as Kazu and the only true difference would be physical ( larger place).  I think this place doesn't have much mistakes. Most staff are polyglote (speaks more than 2 languages which is a big plus compare to Kazu where some staff might not be fluent in french).  But at the end of the day, if you were to ask me where will you go next time Kazu or Imadake: I might say Imadake because I will not wait! Kazu is overpacted and you now need to get there at least 20 minutes before opening and right now it's cold outside.Ok Ok, I think i will have to make this review a comparaison between Kazu and Imadake after all!Well food wise, it's really similar presentation execution and taste. The upper side might go to Imadake in term of booze! They have sake that i have never saw at KazuIMO the Okonomiyaki is a bit better at Kazu because they had a nice salad to the meal but Pancake VS Pancake it's equal! Imadake serve it more classical.They are missing one item on their menu: Onigiri rice balls. Kazu win that one!On the other side, i would argue that they have a slightly larger menu and the booze got all to do with it! If you want to try it, i would suggest you to buy everything you can humanly eat and share it with a friend. It pretty much reduce the price of the bill and you end up trying so many things! it's really fun.FrancaisEn premier lieu, je crois que si nous sommes pour argumenté sur une erreur idiote comme: il me manquait un truc, c'est à soi-même de faire le décompte. Honnêtement, je suis surpris de voir que nos serveurs se rappelle de tout la majorité du temps. Il faut laisser le temps au staff de s'accoutumer au menu et prendre de l'expérience. On ressent effectivement des vibes de débutant mais sans problème. Je veux dire, je ne parle pas japonais, eux non-plus, ils sont souvent vietnamien, laosien, cambodgien etc.  Ahh et je n'ai pas eu d'empoisonnement alimentaire . Hier c'était un vrai débat: On essaye imadake ou on retourne chez Kazu. Étant un foodie hardcore, j'ai pas prit énormemment de temps a choisir le nouveau venu. Imadake me fait penser à M:BRG comme décor, dans le genre branché, clean, pas trop sérieux avec des murs en tableau noir d'école. Je m'étais dit que j'n'allais pas faire de cette critique une comparaison entre Kazu et Imadake, mais j'abandonne. C'est vraiment semblable, c'est simplement plus gros chez Imadake ce qui se résulte en moins d'attente avant de pouvoir manger.La différence des deux dans le menu c'est quelques trucs. Imadake ont quelque trucs que Kazu n'ont pas. En revanche, Kazu ont des (boule de riz collante assaisonnée) Onigiri et pas Imadake et Imadake ont beaucoup de choix d'alcool et peu chez KAzu. C'est comme comparé des jumeaux non-identique. Ils sont pas mal semblable mais pas pareil. Je donnais la partie pour la crêpe japonaise (Okonomiyaki) à Kazu à cause de l'ajout d'une salade et d'une vinaigrette légèrement acide plus relevé. La Crêpe chez Imadake vient plus neutre, seule, sans accompagnement sans l'assiette: présentation plus traditionnelle. J'ai une prédiction pour les Nihon Bar (Pub Japonais) à Montréal et c'est que ça va explosé en nombre dans 10 ans!  C'est une cuisine hyper accessible au occidentaux et c'est de la bouffe pour la classe moyenne: bref, c'est pas cher, sans prétention et sans ôté à la complexité des saveurs et la «pureté» de la façon de traité les aliments en cuisine japonaise, le Nihon Bar c'est la nouvelle affaire qui gagne à grossir en nombre à Montréal car Imadake nous prouve qu'ils sont compétitif à Kazu et ont un avenir prometteur devant eux."

/user_details?userid=iwDP-y8NJG3Vem2z242LDg,CalamityJane T.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"I've been curious about ramen in MTL but never seem to get around to trying any whenever I visit. It was freezing the other day and I wanted something soupy. I thought of Korean but wasn't sure if there is any good Korean food in MTL so I decided on Imadake, across the street from Alexis-Nihon.I was in a bit of a rush so we didn't have time to drink and draw out the meal beyond the time it took us to eat, so we didn't get to try any of their cocktails or other drinks, but they had a number of items on their fairly extensive menu that I would not have minded (their online menu is slightly different). I was also glad to see black cod present but I didn't end up ordering it as I hadn't yet tried anything at Imadake and if the fish wasn't done right, I would have been really disappointed! There were the usual izakaya staples: salads, grilled skewers of meat/skin/cartilage, gyoza, takoyaki, okonomiyaki & other fried items, dessert, etc. but what we really wanted was ramen.Imadake offers about 4-5? choices of ramen where you choose the broth type: miso or ""original"", which I don't know if that's shoyu (soy sauce) or shio (salt) but there was no mention of tonkotsu anywhere on the menu; and then you select flavours: miso with pork belly (~$11) and miso grilled garlic ($12?) ramens were what we ordered, along with grilled mackerel (~$10), and then I watched the guys behind the counter throwing it all together. There was one working on the presentation of dishes that were done before ours and really getting into the placing of the garnishes, all intense-looking.The mackerel came out as two pieces and was grilled nicely, with the edges all crispy. Not overly flavourful but definitely didn't have the fishy taste that mackerel often comes with. I didn't try the grilled garlic ramen but my miso pork belly was just OK. There were no sprouts in sight, nor anything with crunch, which there should have been. The pork belly was too thin and small (only one piece; I wonder how much you get with the ""extra pork belly order"" for $2 more?), and we both agreed that the broth wasn't terribly flavourful. The noodles were springy but very slightly undercooked. The egg wasn't soft boiled and runny, which is good because I don't like them that way anyhow, even though that's how it's supposed to be done. I wasn't sure if the place is Japanese or Chinese-owned so I had no idea what I'd get when I asked for ""something hot"" to add to our ramens to liven up the broth. We got those chili pepper flakes in oil that you get in Chinese restos, which did the job. I don't think anyone who works there is over the age of 25, and they all seemed professional. There are a lot of staff which is probably quite useful as I could see Imadake being busy most nights. Service was great, very friendly and attentive, among them a couple of actual Japanese waitresses! I haven't been to other ramen-ya or izakayas in Montreal but the ones in Toronto have been mostly mediocre at best with few exceptions. I don't know what the MTL standard for these types of places is but I would go back to Imadake to try other items. I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but based on this one time, I'd bump this place up by another half *."

They are bold to plant a foot down as a freshman with a young concept in a rapidly growing food scene with confidence of being embraced. Thank you Imadake for bringing me a few of my most favorite dishes to Montreal and saving me gas money and 5 hour drive. This place is going to go viral, mark my words."

/user_details?userid=IM6ss5QP852np0C4Ponv2g,Concertina F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The main problem with Imadake is that it will always be compared to Kazu. And while both Kazu and Imadake are Japanese isakayas, they are actually quite different. Kazu is the homey, cozy, authentic older brother, while Imadake is the trendy yet eager kid sis.Being greeted by a chorus of ""Irasshaimase!!!"" by the employees immediately reminds you of Kazu, however, being greeted so enthusiastically is cute and kind of works at Kazu because the place is so small, it's almost like walking into someone's home. Imadake however is a much larger space, so that kind of yelling seems... kind of crazy? The staff isn't all Japanese either, which makes it seem inauthentic and a tad contrived.Okay, I'm obviously moderately fond of Kazu, but I'm going to stop comparing them now. Publicly anyway.So the evening began when my friend and I both ordered Sapporos. Sapporos that turned out to be so large that we could have filled a small swimming pool with what arrived at our table. Hey, I'm not complaining! There's no such thing as too much beer. Except that time in 1999, but that's another story.We decided to order a few small dishes because it's always more fun that way. First came the Japanese style fried chicken, which was actually a freebie because the kitchen had made it by mistake. I wouldn't have ordered this on my own because it just doesn't sound that interesting to me, but it was pretty good.The dishes we actually ordered came after. Grilled beef tongue, pork belly brochette, octopus balls (takoyaki), some kind of whitefish carpaccio, black cod, and jellyfish salad. The tongue was fantastic, as was the jellyfish salad and carpaccio. The takoyaki is the type of dish for me that is died-and-gone-to-heaven upon the first bite, and as you continue, your body slowly begins to tell you that you can take no more. Maybe it's all that mayo sauce or something, but by the end of it I was kind of glad it was over. Am I alone on this?The biggest disappointment was the pork belly. When I think of pork belly, I think ""bursting with juicy flavour"" and ""layers of sweet heavenly pork fat"". What we got was a plate of skimpy, dry and flavourless skewers. Not impressed.Dessert was green tea cheesecake. I'm not sure why we ordered this, since my companion isn't a cheesecake fan. But who cares. More for me!So... I lied when I said I was going to stop comparing this place to Kazu. Sort of. What I want to get across is that if Kazu didn't exist, or I had never been, Imadake would be The Spot. It generally has all the qualities I like about a restaurant. Cool, casual vibe, fun small portions, nice space, good food, simple yet creative (at least creative in the sense that we don't have many isakayas in Montreal, so we don't see these types of dishes often), etc. However, Kazu DOES exist, and while only one of Imadake's dishes was a real disappointment, none of Kazu's are. I'll definitely be back to Imadake... on days where I don't feel like waiting forever for a table at Kazu, or on a day when I want to be able to relax over drinks with a bunch of friends without feeling cramped or rushed. But for any other day, Kazu has my heart."

From reading earlier reviews here, I think we ordered all the right items (octopus balls, okonomiyaki, that fried chicken with wasabi mayo dish, jellyfish salad, black cod), but none of them were that great. The cod was rubbery, unlike at other Japanese restaurants in Montreal (for example, Azuma on St-Laurent had a wonderful black cod). The octopus balls were gummy with un-cooked tempura batter in the center and slathered in salty sauce. The okonomiyaki was so completely covered in sauce, that this was the only thing we could taste. That, and a strange, almost cornmeal-y consistency unlike any other okonomiyakis I've experienced (granted I've only had it once before, in NYC, but it was a wonderful streetfood-style dish there; here, not anything I'd recommend, even if you got the sauce on the side--which I would recommend doing, if you choose to try this dish). We didn't order anything to drink, and to the best of my knowledge, only ordered the five small dishes listed above, plus one order of mochi, and it cost us $67 before tip. I certainly won't be returning. I think this place is more about the scene, as it's got a trendy vibe to it; it's a trendy-slathered-in-oyster-sauce kind of place."
