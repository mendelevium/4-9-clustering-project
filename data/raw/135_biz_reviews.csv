/user_details?userid=JstDKWmAZsL026ADFxf7fw,Tony Kangrui L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of the best, if not THE best bowl of pho I ever had.Walking into the place, with Foodora sticker on the door, lady who speaks excellent English & French, Britney Spears playing on the jukebox, and under 10 reviews on Yelp in a neighborhood not particular known for asian food, all I could do was to keep an open mind. Hey don't judge the book by its cover.I got the #12 - Bún bò Hué Soup (Spicy beef broth with beef shank) and flavour-wise it was surprisingly well-balanced - spicy, sweet, rich, with a hint of ginger and coriander. The onion tasted fresh. The meat was abundant. And my favorite part, the homemade spicy chili oil, was out of this world compared to the generic stuff you sometimes find in chinese/vietnamese restaurants. I almost finished the soup hehImpressed. This block (St-Laurent & Rachel) is really happening."

The rolls were pretty good and fresh and the imperial rolls were very crispy. The bun bo hue was slightly spicy and had quite a few slices of beef. The only downside of my orders is that I feel so thirsty after, even after drinking several glasses of water. Otherwise, the food is pretty good."

There weren't many options around, but we settled with Pho Rachel after seeing its high reviews. We ordered the pho with beef and the bun bo hue (rice noodle in a spicy beef broth), both of which were mediocre. The broth lacked depth, flavor, and aroma, and the noodles and beef were plain.  Price was also higher than the average bowl in Toronto. Service was indifferent. We left feeling unsatisfied and had another meal afterward."
/user_details?userid=akCG-uYnMqaRR0fr1zpyig,David G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,A great pho place conveniently located in plateau! Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't too crowded. Ordered the large bun bo hue and it was good enough for 2 meals. It was quite spicy but that was perfect on a cold November day. This was probably the most authentic tasting Vietnamese noodles that I've had in Montreal so far. And finally a pho place that doesn't put broccoli  in their soup!! Had the imperial rolls which were good as well. Price was 10-12$ depending on if you ordered medium or large but it's quite worth it. Will be returning for sure.
/user_details?userid=JDKYDdYEgQwAXDCfxgGzew,Carmen C.,"Markham, Canada",3 star rating,This was only a min walk from our Airbnb so we decided to come here on a Saturday night. When we first got there we realized it was a small restaurant and we had a group of 15 people. We have to separate into 3 groups which was fine. The woman did ask us to wait outside. It was a little chilly that night. I got the beef pho and it was decent. I personally thought the price was higher since it cost about $10 for a medium and usually we can get a large for the price in Toronto. The portion seems a little smaller as well. The broth was good and the beef was good as well. It was thicker and not like thin hot pot beef which was nice. The house made chicken noodle soup was good! The noodles are made in house and it was very bouncy. I also ordered the Vietnamese coffee and it was very sweet. And I believe they are not very consistent with the condense milk because I tried my other friends ice coffee and it wasn't as sweet as mine. The service was good. I definitely recommend this place and if I'm ever back in mtl I would want to go back there to get the chicken noodle soup since they only served this on fridays and Saturday's! They are closed on Sunday !

/user_details?userid=qEVzzrg5tjnmZlYmSFTCSg,Phil C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"The comforting feel of mom's cooking... if my mom could cook Vietnamese. I came here one night because it was the only viet place close to me that was open late. Also, it's relatively cheap. Now, I go each time I visit Montreal. The portions are huge, there's a vegetarian option, and the appetizers are amazing. Writing this is making me want their peanut sauce. Right now. They have friendly staff too! Highly recommended for simple, cheap, quick eats."

/user_details?userid=zbpP28M6g0YHaaIJ6ZP2Xg,Elise B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Had the pleasure of eating at Pho Rachel multiple times since July of this year. Their beef pho is delicious, one of my favorites in Montreal. Their spring and imperial rolls are super yummy too. I also love their grilled meat dishes.Pretty busy spot during weekday lunch, otherwise quiet. Very casual restaurant, one of the only authentic Vietnamese restaurants in the Plateau.For my full review and more photos, check out my blog: Turquoise Blog (link in bio!)"

/user_details?userid=fbQiykh15AqNWl5H6I8-Kg,David C.,"Manchester, CT",4 star rating,"So I love Pho. I guess you could say that I'm a ""phonatic"" of sorts.  I've tried it in many places. Pho Rachel definitely fills the bill. The broth was perfectly seasoned, and definitely not too salty. It's served traditionally, in a large bowl with a side of bean sprouts, basil, and lime. Piping hot and just delicious!  The price was great, too."

The beef pho is really delicious and filling too!! If you like spice, they also have strong but tasty spicy sauce. Also, the owner of this place is really sweet and welcoming. I want to come back again when I visit Montreal again next time."
/user_details?userid=nfb9ig6yyOrEU98JNqUYXA,Sabrina A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious pho!!! I had the grilled chicken and vegetable soup- tasty lean grilled chicken without a bit of fat on it, flavourful broth, lots of crispy veggies. They also have vegetarian pho with vegetable broth, veggies and tofu, which my husband tells me is great. Imperial rolls were crispy and good. Small place, on the expensive side for pho but totally worth it. So few places in the Plateau that do pho and this is the only good one! I got take-out and it came in a nice big container you can use as a soup bowl. I will be going back a lot this winter!"
