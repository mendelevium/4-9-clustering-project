Three of the best classic cocktails I've had -- measured up to DC, NYC, and Tokyo. This rum-centric classic cocktail bar, has highly skilled artists. Some gin. A few whiskeys. But definitely creative rum cocktails."
/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Nice (very) small bar! A great place to grab a drink while you're waiting to get into Coldroom. It can also be its own destination - in the summer they have seating outside so it's almost like a regular-sized bar. The Summer daquiris are perfect and the cubano (which comes in a cuban cigar box) is the perfect late-night snack/meal. Worth a stop!
/user_details?userid=oR5az_eNCnfN7e49H3ONhg,Rebecca H.,"Worcester, MA",4 star rating,This place was really cool! It's a small bar/lounge on the corner adjacent to an alley that takes you to that really touristy street in MTL. We were looking for some refreshments before our dinner reservation and this seemed like the perfect place.It's cuban inspired and cute. We sat outside and it is my understanding that the inside is very small. They have a few (expensive) cocktails on the menu. We both ordered the mojito which I would rate as better than average. In terms of the food sitch you can only really get a cuban sandwich which looked amazing (table next to us ordered it) but doesn't appeal to my vegetarian tendencies. The service was decent. The guy was nice and friendly but there was only one person and he was running around all over the place serving all of the tables that it took a minute for him to recognize that our glasses were empty. Overall this is a good place if you're just interested in some dranks and are not in a rush.

Our server was extremely accommodating and knowledgeable about their drinks list. We tasted a few different types of drinks and actually changed a few opinions about rum cocktails.Even though we had had supper, after the third round we ordered a Cuban sandwich. It was excellent. Fun and great people watching spot."

Maybe not I will stick to reviewing.Within it's first two weeks of opening I was so happy to wander off and discover El Pequeño on a Friday afterwork deal. When Eater mentioned this was a small Havana styled bar that seats 9 ppl - the Polly pocket loving child in me had to check this place out. I patiently waited as they opened up at 7 pm. The best surprise was that Coldroom and Bevo are neighbours to this cute little bar. (Contain excitement). El Pequeño is actually a sister site of Coldroom! (Insert mind explosion sound effect).Walking in-the decor is a very classic, large windows, green plants and literally 2 seats at the bar. There are side and center tables for standing which is where I mozied my way through. It reminded me of an adult lemonade stand setup -added bourbon and hard liquors. Fear not! There is a 30 seater terrace being setup in two weeks -Yay!!!Peter was great at explaining the menu- a simple one. Currently they have 4 drinks: Daquiri, rum & Coke, mojito, and El presidente (12-15$ range). I went with the daquiri (4/5) it was great & strong-made with white and cane sugar, lime juice and and Bacardi Superior. Peter mentioned that they will soon introduce rum flights!! Can't wait.The fact there was only one food item only supports my analogy of a lemonade stand (not 10 cents but worth every cent of the 11$): enter Cubano sandwich. (5/5) if Schwartz were to have a sandwich baby -this would be it. I could hear the butter sizzle on the grill turning brown and spreading beautiful aromas in the small bar. The Cubano was served in an old deli styled wrapping. The sandwich is a combination of meat, mustard, thinly sliced pickles, mozzarella cheese on warmly served paninified bread. So good  on an empty stomach! Good to share for 2.I am so happy to have tried this place! I kept this date short and sweet so the rich scent of brown butter can bring me back here to this exotic little find."

My friend and I love everything about Christmas and were super excited to check out the Miracle bar, despite the bad reviews. After a bad experience with the hostess at the miracle bar on st-paul, my friend and I stumbled upon El Pequeño Bar, which is also a miracle pop up bar this month. They have the exact same menu, but a more intimate experience with everything that the Christmas spirit has to offer. The coziness, the Christmas music, the warmth and friendliness. With tasty 'nice' and 'naughty' shots and a very gracious bartender and host!"
/user_details?userid=yInNj9eDZ1JAUIZ4n0P6Jg,Mike Z.,"Nashville, TN",4 star rating,"In old Montreal, you can still find some little gems even with as much of a tourist trap it is, there's still things I would consider parts you should discover. This bar was friendly and very quaint considering it felt like a check in room with the flair and energy of Havana.  Bartender was super friendly and gave you the energy of warmth you needed even though it was frigid outside. Not to mention, he makes a simple mean cubano sandwich. It's cleverly served in a Cuban cigar box. They also serve traditional Cuban cocktails as well. Come and make a couple new friends because it's a very intimate space. Not to mention you get to people watch as people try to hit up the speakeasy next door."
/user_details?userid=KyF8TsD-5g1IHKwQRNW_DQ,Briana S.,"Maitland, FL",5 star rating,"The most adorable bar you will ever walk into. It's basically the waiting area for when you're trying to get into the Cold Room, but it's worth just walking in here to take a look at the cuteness. It's super small, so don't come with a big group! Mojitos are 10/10"
/user_details?userid=2bqPc1yFS0V4UKyfxEOWZQ,Joe V.,"Atlanta, GA",5 star rating,"This was our precursor to waiting the The Coldroom!  Toted as one of the top three bars in Montreal and the smallest - this place was super !  The bartender had a large friendly personality and was very accommodating/ helpful !  Their specialty is Rum with a Havana flair.  Have to admit - Rum is never my go to drink.  However, amazing revolution with smoky tones and aging process that bring this libation back up on the list.  A notable mention for flair and showmanship in the preparation- see photos and go!!  *Tip will help you locate establishment *"
/user_details?userid=H5pubo53Joclw01ZPqhoMA,Cassie A.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"The most adorable Cuban themed bar. Having been to Cuba before, I can say that this truly transported me back to Havana. It's super tiny so be prepared to stand (I think they only have 2 chairs in total which we were lucky enough to snag). There is only 1 person working behind the bar and he was great. The daiquiris were fantastic and tasted super authentic as well."
/user_details?userid=Kj9cFO70zZOQorN0mgeLWA,Faiza K.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Walking around Old Montreal I saw this cute little bar that I had to try.  Apparently it's the smallest bar in North America, according to the bartender.  There are 3 seats at the bar, and one small round stand up table.  And that's it!The decor is kinda classy and laid back cool at the same time.  They do offer food - but only a Cuban sandwich:)The drinks menu is limited but hits the spot - daiquiris, mojitos, rum/coke and 1-2 other drinks.  I tried the mojito and it was lovely - the muddled fresh mint really stood out.  The bartender is really friendly and definitely a people person.  He can regale you with tales of how he started in the business. He even gave us a great tip about a secret bar close by!Definitely a great spot to grab a drink!"
/user_details?userid=sKVpHfhkG_Nvgf_Vfb91Cg,Janine T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Cutest little bar in Montreal! The bartenders here are super knowledgeable and fun, and make divine mojitos and other deelish rum cocktails. I love how tiny and gorgeous the place is and how I always meet likeminded fun people that are there for the experience and are totally ok to stand as the drinks are oh so worth it. Yummy little Cuban sandwiches can be purchased (and devoured) and the bar is tucked away so that most tourists cannot find it, score! In the summer, there is a nice little spot where I can tie up the pup and he feels like he's in Havana as well :P"

The rum selection would make Trader Vic himself giddy, I was sure excited as I had noticed a dearth of good rum at other bars in Montreal.Bas the bartender was cordial and accommodating, our Caipirinha and Daiquiri were brilliant. No bottled lime here! Can't wait to get back to Montreal and visit again."
