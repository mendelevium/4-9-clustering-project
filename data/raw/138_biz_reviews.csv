I used to go here all the time and recently went with a friend after many years. Due to covid, its only open for takeout but the food does not disappoint. Service was quick, excellent wrapping and just delicious food. They have a limited menu thats displayed on the wall. Only drawback, cash only. You must try this place for a quick bite!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious spicy chicken sandwhich with a strong charcoal flavor. It isn't too spicy and there's a lot of chicken in it. For 8$ tax included, this is definitely worth it. The place is clean and spacious inside, but half of the surface is their kitchen so there aren't many seats. They don't take cards so remember to bring cash."
/user_details?userid=hF3zr8snmxb5pwa2_9bnlQ,Gabriella F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I used to go to this place every lunch break and get the exact same thing every time: the mixed meat sandwich (antep kabab). They make the bread in front of you, the place smells amazing, and the best part of the sandwich is the last few bites when gravity makes the spicy sauce, meat juices, creamy kebab sauce and tomato accumulate at the bottom... oof. I'd be licking my fingers all the way back to class."
/user_details?userid=r0GLQAawvHXUd-xZow-fWQ,Christine M.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Fresh grilled meat on house-made bread! Bring paper, it's cash only!This no nonsense, deli-style resto just steps from Guy-Concordia metro on Maisonneuve deals in sandwiches and platters. There are 4 types of each - kabab, chicken, steak, lamb.We went with kabab sandwiches, and said YES to spicy. (The spicy is very spicy and very good!)  A couple pieces of lettuce adds a greeny crunch, and a couple slices of tomato gives a juicy bite, but these are really meat-forward sandwiches. Halfway through eating these, we decided to head back in the shop to order 2 more to take on our train trip later that day. They were just that good! And they were just as good cold! Summary:The meat: lots of it, moist, great texture, perfectly spiced, herbs.The bread: fresh, made in-house, loaded with sesames, stands up to the hefty meat.$8.50 each, tax includedAmazing place, don't miss out."
/user_details?userid=cun967dZl0Q9nMwg_riaIQ,Sam B.,"Jersey City, NJ",4 star rating,"This place is a definite must try in my book. It wasn't very inviting when I first walked in there but once I figured out how to order and tried their food, it was all well worth it.So first thing to know is this place does not serve you. You'll have to go up to the counter and order your food from the very limited menu they have. Despite being limited though, the food they have is delicious. Once you order your food, you then give them your name and pay for It. When the food is done they will call your name to get It from the pick up side where the cook is. Then you enjoy a delicious meal.I personally recommend the grilled chicken kebab platter which was very delicious. The platter comes with 2 triangle pieces of their homemade bread, rice, fresh salad with oil on It along side a lemon wedge, about 4 good sized delicious pieces of perfectly grilled chicken, a white cheese cream type sauce on the side and optional hot sauce. This platter with a bottle of water came out to a little over C$16. Everything on the plate was delicious and I came back the next day to have the same platter again.The spicy and non-spicy chicken sandwich is also very popular here. Bread is amazing so I know you'll love It. Must try!"
/user_details?userid=VO964ZoxWcKZ5qUVIN_pZw,Razan A.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Meet quality is great. Fresh turkish bread only 2 small pieces but taste good. The burgul is a great aubatitute to rice especially if you are on a healthy diet. Pricy and only takes cash but for a downtown restaurant it is worth it to order once a week depending on your budget
/user_details?userid=8DpvkoGGHvQJd2OUGpU4Lg,Barry M.,"Indianapolis, IN",5 star rating,"If you are in the student district of Montreal this is a must visit place to go. Despite the fact that it serves only 8 items, has no vegetarian options, takes cash only, and has no liquor, it is amazingly delicious and cheap.The sandwiches are made with the tastiest pita ever, beautifully baked on site and encrusted with sesame. Then there is the beef and lamb kebab meat, loaded with spices. The meat leaves a glorious tingling in your mouth.The clientele consists almost entirely of Arabs--which for me confirms the greatness of this establishment. Go get a great kebab sandwich for $10. The bread, meat, vegetables, and yoghurt merge beautifully into a flavorful bonanza you will definitely want to experience again"
/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is small and not particularly interesting from the outside, the décor and seating is basic but you will always see a lot of rush inside. We were passing by and could smell a delicious chargrilled aroma coming from somewhere... the smell led us to Antep and before we know it, we left hands-full of sandwiches. There are only a few items on the menu - either meat/chicken sandwiches or meat/chicken plates. I highly recommend the sandwiches, mainly because the Turkish bun is freshly-made in store. You can see the girl putting in and taking out fresh-batches like clockwork.I had a spicy filet-mignon sandwich (which I waited nearly 45 minutes for - was there during peak lunch-time) and watched the entire process of how it was made. The fresh bread came out of the oven, a dollop of garlic sauce and a special home-made chilli sauce were spread inside, a heaping of salad was placed along with an entire skewer of juicy filet mignon. Biting into this thing was tricky as the sandwich is super filled and heavy - which I totally didn't mind! You definitely get your money's worth of meat (the sandwiches are a tad on the pricier side!)The flavours are to perfection, almost addictive as you want more afterwards. Great place for lunch/dinner if you want to try authentic Turkish flavours!"

This comes with 2 kebabs, warm bread, salad with yogurt, and spiced barley. Super filling and satisfying. Also tried the Uludag orange soda which had a bit of orange pulp in it, but tasted like orange Fanta. Delish!"

It was a Thursday night, around 9pm, and they were incredibly busy. They have a pretty good system of taking orders and the necessary wait time was very reasonable. We were soon called by name and able to see our meals and salads being freshly prepared before our eyes. If you are in Montréal, you definitely want to give them a try for an authentic, filling Turkish meal!"

After checking into our hotel, food became a priority. We checked Yelp, jumped in a Uber and arrived at this delicious kabob place by the university. I have the chicken plate and he has the Antep kabob plate- both spicy. The food was fresh, tasty, charred nicely yet very tender and moist, and perfectly prepared. Exactly what we needed to start our stay."

/user_details?userid=5ypOb3m_8SKSYSPtGLhdGA,Tara Y.,"Glencarlyn, Arlington, VA",4 star rating,"Arrived in Montreal with little knowledge and a crew of 10 hungry family members with different preferences. Everyone from the grandparents in their mid 70s to the foodie 40 somethings to the teenagers, to the young kids enjoyed their meals! Both the chicken plate and the sandwiches were substantial. The bread on the sandwich was homemade, warm, soft and a chewy. The chicken and lamb were well seasoned and the spicy sauce had just the right heat. The homemade yogurt was creamy and so good! So glad we found this spot! The only reason it didn't receive 5 start is because they don't take credit cards and I had to walk to TD in the cold to get Canadian cash."
/user_details?userid=P_BsIX1h93u8lgiDXf-9CA,Andrew C.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Great place for a quick lunch if you are downtown. I always get the chicken sandwich for $7 cad. They freshly make the bread. They freshly grill the chicken which has a great flavor to it and you know it's fresh because they get so much turnover.  The bread and the chicken make it a great sandwich. The veggies and sauce they use is okay. One negative is that it can get busy during lunch (students, workers). You could be waiting 10minutes for your sandwich depending on how much grilling they are doing. No paper menus. Everything is on board aboveThe chicken sandwich is a must try if you are in the area."

I highly recommend!"
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Although a bit dingy on the inside, Antep Kabab still delivers a respectable enough spicy chicken sandwich, even though it's not really ""spicy"" at all. All of the spicy sauce tended to conglomerate toward the bottom, so it was quite uneven in terms of what to expect. The bread tasted very nice though and it was cool to see it being baked right in front of me! I just wish that the sandwich overall had a bit more to it.From multiple Turkish friends, I wouldn't say this is the most authentic Turkish place as normally the kebabs should be nicer/higher quality? But I could definitely see this being a nice sort of drunk food if you're partying in the Concordia area."

I had the big plate and it was very good too but just not the chicken sandwich!  Skip the fancy brunch or lunch place and come here!  Cash only but they have an ATM machine and only charges $1 for withdrawal... so not the end of the world if you didn't bring $.

The kebabs can be a little on the expensive side though (ie. $16). However, the Spicy Chicken is one of the best I have ever heard. Thoroughly spicy and very well seasoned with ample veggies and condiments added.There is a lot of seating available and despite being close to Concordia University, it is not too crowded."

We had the lamb and antep kabab plates (ground beef & lamb with amazing spices), plus an extra chicken kabab. All of the meat was perfectly cooked and spiced. We LOVED the chicken. The fresh bread is made and cooked right in the restaurant. The meal came with delicious, spiced barley, yogurt, salad, and bread. The people working there are very friendly and helpful. We had take-away. The restaurant is clean but sparse. There were many people eating there late at night. We will likely eat there again tomorrow night for our last dinner in Montreal.

/user_details?userid=iqQBsjqOF9xgIAbsZ2sAZA,David M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I know of only 2 places that make fast food turkishstyle and this is the best one.I honestly believe it's the best quick bite in the downtown area.Pros:  Amazing bread, kebab, chicken and filet mignon, the salad is always fresh and complements the meal quite nicely. I cannot stress how delicious the meats are and the breads are also a delight.Cons: Lamb is pricey ($10 for sandwich and $20 for plate.The side of bulgur is not good and cold mush (no rice or fries to substitute). Last issue is you only get half a bread for a plate even though it's twice the price of a sandwich. So better to take 2 sandwiches with 2 yummy breads.The interior decorating is lifted out of a failed nightclub and the uneven tables seem to wobble a bit, but who cares.The service is also pretty friendly, but you have to give them a few minutes to make the food. This is not a standard shish taouk joint."

Have tried both the spicy chicken sandwich and the chicken plate. Both were amazing, the chicken is juicy and grilled to perfection with that amazing charcoal taste. My only complaint with the plate is the haphazard salad, literally some iceberg lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers, dry with no dressing. That with the fact that the eat-in area is very dirty and poorly maintained is the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars."

/user_details?userid=1ViT_LzrNbbrheWgIvT5Tw,Wes N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"here's the run-down - Atmosphere, Service, & FoodAtmosphere: Antep Kabab - for all of Montreal's diverse culinary fabric - is one of the few Turkish restaurants found in down-town.  The fact that it's owner operated, gives it its unique feel - what the feel is, however is yet to be clearly determined.  It's small, but cozy, quite but bustling, uniquely Turkish but feel like any number of places around the Concordia Campus.  Best is to pop in for take out.Service: The lady behind the counter - always on her laptop pc - has a jovial smile, but can be stern if the mood doesn't strike her.  The owner, a short, burly man is the head cook (also makes the bread / pitas) speaks english with difficulty and although always happy to take customer's orders - can often been seen barking remarks / order as the 2 other employes on the counter lady.  Cute family-ish dynamic - but sometimes gives patrons an awkward feeling.Food:  The food however, is something else!  The fact that everything is made fresh, makes Antep's menu a treasured prize for the hungry student, traveller, err... everybody.  Prices have been on the rise (damn you inflation!) and Antep's sandwiches (kabab, shish taouk (chicken portions), kebab, and filet mignon) have gone up in price to $6 each.  Two of them should do the trick when you're hungry.  Everything is cooked on a charcoal grill & as an added bonus you can find many exotic soft drinks and juices at Antep (those from the Mediterranean part of Europe and the Middle East will recognize many of them).  Take note, only cash is accepted.""Baten Malan, Kef Tamam"" (full stomach, happy mind)"

I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and was not disappointed. The bread was fluffy and fresh and the sandwich was loaded with chicken. I will definitely be coming back here to try the filet mignon sandwich as well. For $6.50 the sandwich is a great deal. The combination of freshly grilled meat with fresh veggies make this sandwich mouth watering. I can't wait to get my next sandwich.

Kind of pricy though but its good so its worth!I had a chicken burger..the bread tasted fresh or home made and the meat was very tender and juicy. But I don't like the way the salad and meat are placed... They put in the veggie then meat afterwards so when you eat you eat either meat first (usually because its on the opening of the bread) then veggie afterward...Overall its something to try and grab when your in the area!

They are super friendly there and quicker than I thought they would be (after reading other reviews). The bread is definitely the best part- fluffy and fresh with a slightly charred outside. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich that I think might have turned out to be a normal chicken sandwich. The chicken is delicious and succulent- very different from a normal shawarma since these are cubed and cooked separately. Overall, the sandwich is nice- it was $7CAD cash and fast. Not bad but could use a bit more seasoning or spice."
/user_details?userid=RVP_5y3kynGg6zkutb5CNA,Aya Y.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,a friend of mine recommended this Turkish restaurant to me. I am not big on grilled meat in general. It just happened I was in area so I decided to check it out for a late lunch. I ordered a chicken sandwich which comes in. Freshly baked Turkish bread. The chicken was yum and I really liked the bread so much.  The portion was huge so I could not finish it. I paid about $6 for it and it was totally worth it. I also liked the fact the restaurant looked very clean on the inside. They have an open kitchen concept so i got to see how my sandwich was prepared which is nice. I am highly skeptical when it comes to those little fast food restaurants but Antep Kebab gets thumps up. I would go back again especially for the bread.

/user_details?userid=usaCcIc4y1ur1mj5vfhYdw,Omniya A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place doesnt quite standout when you're just walking by but let me tell you - walk in , now .. no like right now!Their chicken and beef sandwiches are delicious , everything from the meat itself to the sauce inside is great. The big star is the freshly made bread. Drool inducing! Now if you have a bit of an appetite their plates are delicious. Everything on the plate is well thought out and complimentary to each other. I dont know how Turkish the food is or not but regardless it is mouth watering delicious food!Only con is that they are a bit slow since they cook everything fresh on a charcoal grill but dont let that deter you (maybe call in advance if you're in a hurry). Big thumbs up!"

/user_details?userid=P0J2H0XoJmcPzdwtJUHLcQ,Sadia H.,"Laval, Canada",3 star rating,The chicken sandwich was pretty good and juicy but lacking in some flavor. The bread was very fresh and soft. The chicken platter was not too bad. The sauces were okay.
/user_details?userid=cK-tsr9qzvDzq0UjmvDsuA,Amy Y.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,LOOVE the spicy chicken sandwich here.  I call in 15 min before I come otherwise you wait 15+ min. I haven't tried the filet mignon bc I always crave the chicken. The buns are sooo good that I take a bite of my hubby's buns when he is not looking.  That's how good it is mm ya!  It taste doughy n fresh just how I like it =) Best Turkish sandwich and buns I ever had!!
/user_details?userid=hMY0wsj3VxOaBixV_6YnuA,Gregory S.,"Houston, TX",5 star rating,"So good.  One of the best values in town.  I love lamb and they do it amazingly here.  The best value is to get a chicken sandwich for only 6 dollars! They put tomatoes, cucumbers and tzatziki with your choice of meat.  Everything is done in house from the amazing bread to the freshly grilled meats.  I try and come here for lunch since my work is so close as many times as I can.The platters are also really good just a bit more expensive because its much more food.  The place at first seems like a hodge podge of furniture and a hole in the wall, but it is really really good.  You won't be disappointed!It does take awhile to prepare so call ahead!"

The guy operating the cash register was a huge jerk (maybe because I'm a foreigner?) and he rounded down my change to the nearest dollar... Atmosphere was fine, nothing special. It's not super cheap either, about $10 for a sandwich. Go for it if you're a sandwich/kebab fan, otherwise try something else."

She suggested turnips as one of our vegetable add-ons and it made it much better than the standard Greek gyro. Also, free Wi-Fi for all customers was available. What a blessing for us tourists!"

/user_details?userid=XduciX-f9ONDZ-rUhs3PfQ,Sam C.,"Saratoga, CA",4 star rating,Awesome kabob sandwiches that they make using their fresh baked breads. Probably my favorite part was the fresh bread. The meats were also very good. You can watch them freshly cooking all the meats over the wood coal stove. Simply  delicious.  A must if you are in the area.

/user_details?userid=J7aVQ1Pzr8bq2SZHCuC3FQ,Evan F.,"Calgary, Canada",5 star rating,"A smallish, out-of-the-way joint. It has fairly adequate seating, and a few small tables outside, so there should be places to sit. It can get slightly noisy, but it's a fitting atmosphere. It's decently clean and not too crowded so you can sit and eat if you'd like, or you can take your food to go.The staff is fairly friendly and fast. The wait is a little longer than you would expect, but it's worth it.Prices are cheap for Montreal. 6$ for the normal kebab, 8$ for the filet mignon (think kebab-flavoured beef cubes), and 10$ for the lamb. They have platters too, but those cost more.Now the food. The portion size is a tad on the smaller side, but it's delicious. All the sandwiches are on toasted sesame bread. It's warm, slightly crispy, but still quite soft and fluffy. It's wonderfully flavourful, with a nice nutty, roasted taste. The sandwich itself has lettuce, which is mainly for texture as opposed to flavour. The meats themselves are tender and juicy, spiced in a typical kebab fashion. More on the spicy side and not as salty, but still heavenly.It's definitely worth a try if you're anywhere near the area."
