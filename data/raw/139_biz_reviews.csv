They now also open for dinners which made it possible for us to eat there :) There is Korean fried chicken there, and they manage to make even the chicken breast meat tender and juicy. We got the sweet fried chicken and it was so good. Came with a little side of cabbage salad as well on the plate of the 10-piece chicken ($17.99). We also ordered the pork soondubu jjigae ($10.99) and it smelled so good when it arrived! It also was really yummy too-- comes with a bowl of rice and kimchi as a side. The kind lady who worked/owned(?) the place also told us we can ask for kimchi refills if we wanted to. The service was great and the food came fairly quickly. When we sat down, the nice owner lady gave us lemon tea she made for free! And the rest of the meal was very enjoyable too. Hoping to come back to try out even more of their menu soon, but it's going to be hard to not repeat order what we had this time again though! It was just so good. Right now they also have a 10% discount on your meal if you post the food you ate there on Instagram with their hashtag!!"

I study at UdeM so I was super happy when I heard that a korean place was going to open! The restaurant is cozy and bright and the staff are super friendly. The food was really delicious and super flavorful. A really cool spot to check out if you're looking for lunch on CDN. They are going to slowly expand the menu over the next several months so keep an eye out! Will definitely be back soon!

Couldn't wait as I was having restaurant withdrawal symptoms.The fried chicken was good! It was still crispy after the traveling. Crunch crunch on the outside and moist inside. Just how fried chicken should be. The portion was very generous! Can't wait to try other stuff on their menu!
/user_details?userid=6LswOfggPy2S-V25l-zKWQ,Davy C.,"Greenfield Park, Canada",4 star rating,"They are in soft opening now until Feb 7. They are open 11:30am to 4pm every day except Sunday when they are closed. I assume those hours will expand after the soft opening phase. Every main dish is $10 during soft opening. They offer typical Korean dishes like beef or chicken bulgogi, dolsot bibimbap (with beef), japchae, and pajeon. They also have a seafood tteokbokki. I was tempted by this one but ended up trying something more typical, the bibimbap. It was good, a nicely fried egg with a runny yolk on top of white rice. The other toppings were julienned lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, bean sprouts and mushrooms. The bulgogi beef tasted good with its slightly sweet marinade. The gochujang sauce was pretty good, it leaned more on the sweet side than spicy. I prefer it more in the reverse direction but no complaints.The place fits maybe just less than 40 people. Mostly 4 person and 2 person tables but tables can be put together for larger groups. Based on the one dish, this restaurant is promising. I'd be curious to see if they will expand their menu. There are some stairs you have to walk up to get to this place."
