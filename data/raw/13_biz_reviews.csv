/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"Definitely one of the best poutine in town. Crispy fries, squeaky cheese that squeaks, the right amount of appetizing gravy. We visited on a beautiful autumn day at the beginning of the second wave of the pandemic. The guys  were allowing customers one by one inside and handing out orders through the side window. The park across the street served us as a perfect dining room. Beside delicious poutine the selection of solid local beers was wonderful. Awesome place to experience this loved traditional Quebec dish!"
/user_details?userid=aZvNQg3zSF7sPHMJvSTOpw,Joyce K.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"My brother and I dropped by to try their fish burger, which was recommended by a friend of ours. Rather than a burger, it was more like a slider in size. The fish filet was lightly breaded and served in a white roll with homemade tartar sauce. It tasted similar to an upgraded version of McD's filet-o-fish, but fresher and less greasy. Overall, a nice mid-day snack for $3."

It seemed busy.Place looks like an interesting fast food joint.I was disapointed in the food though,i took the fish burger with poutine and salad.The fish sandwich had potential, but the fish was so flat and squished,if it was a little bit thicker ,it would have been way better. The poutine was quite sad as well,fries were nothing special,not crispy just kinda sad.sauce was typical and cheese also.With the name patati patata i would have expected fried to be at leat similar to frite alors.Finally the salad surprisingly was the best thing out of the 3 things. I don't think i would go backm"

/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"After hearing about this spot for years and living five mins away from it, we finally decided to pick up Burgers with sides of Fries and Poutine for dinner. Unfortunately this turned out to be one of those over hyped places, with extremely average food. The quality and taste could be and should be improved. A burger with cheese and a side ended up costing the same as any other burger joint serving food of excellent quality and taste! Will not recommend this spot."

/user_details?userid=gZmtdCdHoquUHjKgnKJIhw,Eli P.,"Northwest Washington, Washington, DC",5 star rating,"The regular poutine is amazing... the second best I've ever had. Small place and very charming. The staff is super friendly. If I lived in this neighborhood I would get food from here multiple times a week. Not overpriced. Love it.P.S. had it on Wednesday, then after the bar on Saturday night - we added a stop to our Uber to pick up some poutine. The Uber driver was not happy, but we were :)"
/user_details?userid=LMoK9BUP6Tgfc0AeDVbZHQ,Steff D.,"Portland, ME",4 star rating,"Living in Maine and growing up in a French Canadian community, I'm no stranger to poutine. It's pretty much a staple of my winter diet. However, most places where I live don't make it vegetarian friendly (they use meat juices for the gravy), so I was delighted to find several places in Montreal that do.Patati Patata hit the spot, and there was much to love about it: being open until the wee hours of the morning not just on weekends, but every day; offering up vegetarian options (you can get the traditional poutine with gravy and cheese curds, or their patatine which also comes with sautéed peppers and onions on top); the price (6.95) for the portion is amazing (I left feeling just the right amount of full); and, I don't know why, but the single salty olive plopped right in the center of my mountain of crispy shoe string fries, creamy gravy, and squeaky curds was perfection (they're on to something here with this).Yes, it's a suuuuuuuuuuper small place; if you're coming alone, you *might* be able to snag a spot inside. Even coming as a pair, you could *possibly* squeeze in (and people literally do squeeze into every inch of this space, every hour to eat - be prepared for constant friendly bumping into). I think takeaway is probably the way to go!"
/user_details?userid=riBSZ1KXcVQ8iTfERWBnqw,Atia A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I am glad that I found this place and it's really close to my apartment. They have the best burger in a best price in the city I would say. I love the small cozy interior, and the friendliness of staffs. I had been there couple of times already, and was never disappointed. Would highly recommend this place to everyone! :)"
/user_details?userid=EbzIOck2feoZrGxRjyPDyw,Vichet O.,"Philadelphia, PA",3 star rating,"This place was just alright to me.We tried a gauntlet of their poutines. The classic was definitely the best. Can't go wrong with crispy fries, squeeky cheese curds, and thick gravy.The one with onions and mushrooms and bell pepper sounded great on paper, but when we opened it up, our mirepoix seemed to have just been added to the poutine raw. Not even a hint of butter or salt on the onion/mushroom/bell pepper, which were just tossed into what had been a classic poutine.Finally, there was the smoked meat poutine. Nothin' wrong with it, totally fine, but my perception of the smoked meat may have been colored by my recent visit to Schwartz's. It added to the poutine, but not in a way that was really memorable.Altogether, this place is solid, but just didn't hold up to the other poutineries I'd visited over the course of the week."
/user_details?userid=LUHwtIgfclx_9PKfJJQ1YA,Francis T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A friend of ours brought us to this place for a bite to go.The good: Outside decor is stunning and catchy. Very cozy and charming. Super duper cheap in prices. All the vegetables are fresh. Friendly cashier. Food is great!The bad: Limited seating (like 10 chairs). Lots of people waiting inside (and outside) for takeout. They mixed up the order of my wife's burger, which was very disappointing since it was very basic. Ketchup for takeout is simply impossible. Can get noisy. Can get congested since everyone is waiting for their order.Expect to wait, and go for taking on the go. But worth it since the food is great and prices are cheap."

/user_details?userid=HS1xj2PfkdhkmQaW6hJXqQ,Priti K.,"Jersey City, NJ",4 star rating,"So came to Montreal with one thing in mind. POUTINE.A friend recommended Patati Patata and of course, every website/blog/anything ever written about Montreal recommend la Banquise. We were staying at an AirBnB literally 2 seconds away on St. Laurent during the mural festival. The best! I think they were open even later than their regular business hours during that time. As everyone has said, it's a small place, but if you're lucky to grab a seat and even if you're not it's well worth your time. The poutine was lovely. Crispy string fries, a ton of gravy and cheese curds, and slight olive flavor here. I shared a plate with my partner and he let me have the last few bites. Throw away your healthy, conscious eating habits here. It's time to dig into poutine!"
/user_details?userid=rafOdUsRNgi0ISSmi9IUow,Goldie V.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Best poutine we had in our entire trip! The staff were friendly and amazing, everything we ordered was delicious and exceeded our expectations. This is a very small diner but the food felt wholesome, the poutine was fresh, the fries stayed crispy right down to the bottom even though it had gravy and cheese going in every crevice. We ordered a mushroom and pepper poutine, with a tofu sandwich which. The tofu in this sandwich was well flavoured, and I haven't enjoyed vegetarian fare like this in a long time from a restaurant that doesn't focus on vegetarian cuisine. These people really know how to satisfy your taste buds! Thanks guys for the best meal we've had on our road trip!"
/user_details?userid=e0AUdCu-jeOkLImiEzlTDg,Jonathan W.,"Brampton, Canada",4 star rating,"Squeakiest cheese curds ever. One of the qualifiers of authentic poutine is not just cheese curds, but squeaky cheese curds. I thought I knew what that was and have eaten poutine around Quebec a few times before, but this was on another level. I'm pretty sure other people in the room (I got them to go) could hear the squeak as I ate.I have to be honest however, the curds were almost squeaky beyond my preference. That speaks more to what I like rather than the quality and authenticity of the place and they're probably deserving of '5' stars, but I can't just bring myself to it if I wasn't fully in love with it.With all that said: I still enjoyed it and the quality of everything  - fries and gravy too - were great.They actually have a reasonably large menu, so poutine isn't the only thing here. Prices looked reasonable and they even had borscht for somewhere around $4. I saw someone eating that in the restaurant and it looked quite good."
/user_details?userid=dbsSjax8UVlYr4VFUD25EA,Shannon W.,"North York, Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Super tiny shop but friendly staff and yummy poutine. Not really my kind of resto but after seeing the amazing reviews, we decided to give it a try since we were close by! Got the classic poutine and it was big enough to share! The olives on top were a nice touch. We were seated by the window so we had the perfect view of windy Montreal while we were eating."
/user_details?userid=r9Wii37p0kEDIUt2e2_LqQ,Randy F.,"Palo Alto, CA",4 star rating,"Patati Patata is located on a street corner and the small restaurant is the epitome of a hole in the wall spot with bar stool seating with a clear view into the compact kitchen and a few two top and window counter seats.  The ambiance is casual and old school with a menu posted on the wall for both lunch and for dinner.  The draw is definitely the bargain prices, good eats, and comfort food with poutine, burgers, and sandwiches being their go to fare.  Our order:Grilled Cheese Sandwich - $5.  Melted on the grill and pressed with a panini press, the sandwich was crispy, tasty, and gooey...all good things. Onion Soup - $5. A simple but well-executed version with well caramelized and sweet soft onions in a savory broth with just the right amount of cheese and croutons. Poutine - $6.95.  As classic a preparation as it gets with French Fries, squeaky cheese curds, and gravy.  Honestly, the French fries could have been a bit fresher, but mix the gravy in well with the cheese curds and fries and it was better.  Not my favorite poutine, but ok.  To me, the key to poutine is gravy, the more and hotter the better.  But I'm not Canadian so take that with a grain of salt. Overall, Patati Patata is a bargain and worthwhile spot.  The onion soup was excellent, especially at the price point, and the sandwich and poutine were tasty and filling.  The burgers look good for next time as well. Patati Patata accepts credit cards including Amex."
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've passed by Patati Patata for years and it's been on my bucket list for a long time. There's always a line up and it's worth the wait ( coming from someone who doesn't do line ups). We decided to stop there on a Saturday for lunch and were quite satisfied. I had the burger with a classic Poutine and asked to add mushrooms. The Poutine was really delicious and the fries were tasty and crunchy. Their burger too was delicious. You have the option of adding fries and salad with burger as well as replacing your fries with a Poutine. As well, you have the option of customizing your burgers. I hear the Patitine ( Poutine with onions, peppers) is supposedly really good so if you feel adventurous go ahead with that. For an extremely reasonable price each person can eat for under $10.The staff is super friendly and very accommodating. We were lucky enough to sit by the big window and enjoy the sun and people watch. Overall great experience and I will be back."
/user_details?userid=fPbRxN2U_BYSAX0-IH05_Q,Anne S.,"York, Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,Very good poutine!  Very small place though. If you order extra cheese it will come with a lot of cheese! So make sure you like it!

/user_details?userid=kjpmHZuRhq6ywBtNpJUFaQ,Joey C.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",5 star rating,"+1 on agreeing that their poutine has crispy fries.We wanted to try a poutine place that was more like a local gem and I think we found it!LOCATION & DECOR: 4/5Okay this place is pretty small. It has about two tables and a few bar seats. The inside and outside of this restaurant is colourful and funky. It's conveniently located right on St Laurent, and is a perfect place to go ANY time of day for poutine or burgers!FOOD: 5/5I love poutine but I think eating a $15 poutine per person is ridiculous. I appreciate that they have a normally sized poutine for $6.95. Their fries are CRISPY, and their cheese curds are super squeaky. It's an amazing classic poutine. They also have burgers for $3~ which is insanely cheap. Also have fish and tofu burger options. SERVICE: 4/5There was one chef and one server here. They were friendly but seemed overwhelmed with the amount of duties they had to do. It's understandable though since it's a small but very busy/fast paced place.Definitely would come again to their their other foods!"

/user_details?userid=HXOfPXPMvdXNpQ_l0RRjKw,Jeffrey S.,"Midvale, UT",5 star rating,"Of all the meals I had on my last trip to Montreal -- and there were many -- this one seemed the MOST Montreal. The most live-like-a-local, the most iconic. When I close my eyes and think about that trip, this is the first meal that comes to mind and the one that will be with me the longest.My late night walk through the hot and humid streets had taken me across town, and I had just enjoyed some really fine ice cream (sorbet, to be precise) and I was just wandering the streets watching people and taking in the sights and sounds. It was a Thursday night, but the sidewalks were full of life even at the midnight hour. I was coming down the street and noticed Patati Patata on the other side, and immediately remembered it from the Yelp app as a place I had bookmarked to try if I was ever in the area. Late night poutine, I had noted. Well, I was in the area and was definitely down for late night poutine.I made my way in and they were able to seat me at the counter immediately. There's not much seating at all, so don't bring your big groups here unless you're doing takeaway. That's actually a great option and one I saw plenty of people doing. This is late night post-bar or between-bar grub and you can take it to enjoy elsewhere, even to one of the nearby parks that seems to be teeming with people even into the dark hours of night.I sat at the counter and ordered my poutine, turned to the dining room and the view of the street, and watched the busy boulevard and all the wonders of Montreal unfold before me. Laughing groups, a young woman flanked on both sides by two friends of totally different description, couples looking dressy, kids from college flirting; I had a front row seat to Montreal.The poutine arrived shortly, and with an incredible soundtrack overhead (seriously, it was '80s music and I was jamming) I plucked the olive off the top and popped it into my mouth before devouring the fries, curds, and gravy in my dish. It was hot, fresh, and the crew behind the counter including a very thin and smiling young woman let me know it was served with nothing but love and respect for their late night followers. I paid them the paltry sum for such an experience, and made my way back out to the street, and continued drifting down the boulevard, eventually making my way back to the apartment I was renting and laying down with a belly full of poutine and a mind full of Montreal nightlife."
/user_details?userid=N2LOlsIOLCh6p2ikQMecWQ,Nikki M.,"Winston-Salem, NC",4 star rating,"I found this place while searching for ""cheap eats Montréal"" and this was the cheapest of the eats I found--that was actually good! For ~$14 CAD I got a burger (with added cheese) and added poutine and a salad and 2 beers. It was 100% worth it. I got there around lunch time, just before the rush and I really enjoyed watching the one grill cook bang out all of the dishes and cook everything to order. I sat right at the counter and was privy to everyone's conversations, their orders as well as everything going on outside, too. Now, this place is SMALL. Probably 400 sq ft of space total, including the WC. As far as the food goes, it was just okay. I had my first Canadian poutine here and it was truly just okay. There were fries, curds and gravy, but it was sincerely just that. No frills. The burger was on a very cheap bun but it was also $2.50, so I am not complaining--just stating lolI'd eat here again if I were in the Saint-Laurent 'hood. Just know that if/when you go, there may be a line out the door, but it will move quickly."

And I'm giving 2 rather than 1 stars strictly because I don't know how a ""great"" poutine should taste. My honest experience prob. is closer to a 1 because I did not enjoy my dish at all.A lot of reviews raved about Patati Patata's fries being crispy til the end with all the cheese curds and gravy on top. Uh, no? At least not for us. Even the naked fries with no gravy or cheese curds on top of them were limp and a bit stale. Gravy was also watery and the *touch* of olive flavoring was overwhelming."
/user_details?userid=XbiKsujS_qxU3xsr0xUqmQ,Cin C.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Hole-in-the-wall restaurants have a special place in my heart, and Patati Patata is a corner in a wall that makes great food. They occupy a small corner space on a busy popular street and do comfort diner items. I think their whole operation consists of the bar area that surround the open kitchen... and that's it.We got the patatine to go and sat outside to dig into our poutine topped with onions, mushrooms and peppers. There were plenty of squeaky cheese curds and every fry found a bit of gravy to dress itself with. The peppers and onions gave a bright fresh flavor that broke up the heavy flavors of gravy and cheese. A quick and yummy pick-me-up meal as you explore this area."

Patati Patata is definitely known for their fries for good reason. They know just how to fry them up! I've also had their beef burger and tofu burger. I personally found the tofu burger incredibly bland and would not recommend. However, I do suggest trying out their other menu items! Best part is each order is only a couple of dollars and it won't break your bank to try out new things. The cook is very nice and tries his best to accommodate you with what little space they already have in the resto. However, I do recommend getting take out or coming during quiet hours as its very cramped."

I can't believe it took me so long to try it and now I can confidently say I have a new favorite place to go when visiting Montreal. Very reasonably priced, a couple burgers and plate of poutine with a pitcher of the house made iced tea is perfect for two and won't break the bank. The employees were super patient with us, considering we didn't know a single word of French, and they made ordering very easy.

/user_details?userid=JrTsaMac8BnAkLuJ3MfGzA,Aileen L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"ATMOSPHERE: Patati Patata is a very small restaurant on the corner of St-Laurent. It has a rather ""vintage"" ambiance. In my opinion it is quite cramped but it wasn't unbearable. I would recommend coming at quiet hours.FOOD: The food was very good and the quality was okay. But it's comfort food so I wasn't expecting a high-class meal. I got the Tofu burger (which I would not recommend) but my friend got the cheeseburger and it seemed pretty tasty. The fries were decent as well.PRICE: Honestly, you won't find cheaper than this, especially for the quantity/quality that you're getting. Portions aren't the biggest but that's normal for this kind of place. Burgers are around 2-3$ and fries as well. I'd rather come here than go to McDonalds for sure.

Although I shouldn't be allowed to pick favourites because all poutine is great, Patati Patata has a special place in my heart. Their poutine might possibly be the best in Montréal.

The line was sort of confusing as it was a mix of people who were waiting for their order and people who still needed to order. It wasn't much of a line as it was a crowd of people just hanging at the entrance of the restaurant as this place is super tiny.I got the poutine and burger for about $12.50 taxes in. The burger was quite small, and the poutine was about the size of a personal size poutine. I had this for take out as the bar was full of people. Actually a lot of people do take out for this reason, and eat at the park nearby. They do not skimp on the curds...I have to say I got a very healthy helping of cheese in my poutine. I found the gravy to have a unique flavour. It tasted like olives. I actually found the gravy to be too salty for my taste though... The burger I was thoroughly disappointed. I do not recommend getting burgers here. The burger was sandwiched between two dry buns and the patty was super salty and dry. Go for the poutine!"

Don't bother bringing a group unless if you guys are doing takeout. That being said, bring one friend along, have a seat, and enjoy watching your food be prepared right in front of you.This time around, I flipped the script and ordered a fish burger and a tofu burger. Both are served with a large slice of tomato, green leaf lettuce, and red onion, on a basic white bun. The fish burger was all well and good, but what stuck in my mind was hands down the tofu burger. We all know that tofu is generally just about tasteless, but they marinate these patties in what must be unicorn tears, because they come out so well flavoured that I wouldn't be mad at cutting meat from my diet for an extended period. I also got a side of poutine, which was simple, with classic gravy, cheese curds, and a single black olive, (just for fun).I'm really glad that we stopped by this tiny little fry shop, and I suggest you do too."

/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Disclaimer: This review is based on two vastly different experiences that I've had with the poutine here. The first time I had it was for takeout a little under a year ago, and unfortunately, it was pretty awful. While the fries were deliciously crisp and held the gravy and cheese curds well, the gravy was so salty and olive-y that I couldn't even finish it. I swore I would never go there again, but out of curiosity, I decided to give it another chance.When I went there recently, I decided to eat in, and upon first bite, it actually tasted really good. Perhaps it was because I was famished, but I finished off the whole plate without losing my appetite. Maybe it has to do with the fact that the gravy, when put on a plate, has more room to spread out and evenly distribute itself among the fries than when it's just sitting on top of them in a box, but it had a unique flavor to it that made it quite addictive. I left feeling very satisfied and content with my experience.So, long story short, it's probably best to eat Patati Patata's poutine inside, as it will be much tastier, easier to digest, and feel less like salt overkill than if you take it to go."

I ordered the tofu burger and got a really filling piece for  under 3$. The poutine itself was way better than what I tried once in the US so I was glad I ordered it.

Ordering is simple, if you get a burger you are handed a small paper with the various toppings offered. You write down your name and check off what toppings you want and then pay for your order. The wait is usually pretty fast (about 5-10 minutes) considering they're always very busy! I always eat at the park across the street since seating is tight and the restaurant gets really hot with all the bodies inside. The poutine was also good but a little too salty. Seriously, the burgers are all you need to fall in love with Patati Patata. The location is also great for a post or pre-drinks snack, with tons of bars within walking distance. Service is friendly.

A tiny location, what it lacks in counter space it makes up for in quality, flavor, and service.I came to Montreal with a mission of finding poutine, and this place delivered. My last day in Montreal, I rolled in on a Saturday around 10 a.m. and was able to get a seat right away at the bar. I ordered the hamburger with poutine and salad and a Saint Justin mineral water. The hamburger is cooked well and about the size of a regular McDonald's kid's meal hamburger. A little bigger than a slider, but not much (you add toppings by selecting them from a checklist, but it's all in French). It was really the perfect size, though, as the salad is ample and fresh with onion, cabbage, carrot, greek olive and tomato, and the poutine takes up a third or more of the plate.And let's talk about the poutine. The fresh french fries are smothered in squeaky white cheese curds and smothered with brown gravy and topped with a single kalamata olive. It's delicious and wholly satisfying, especially after a long night drinking and before a long flight home. The staff were friendly and accommodating and the price was less than I thought it was going to be. A really great place, and I would definitely come here again. Magnifique!"

Sometimes when poutine is served too hot, it melts the cheese away, when it is served too cold, the curds are always squishy, which means they are fresh.

I was with locals and they were a bit skeptical of this variation. However, the fries, gravy, and cheese curds were delicious and just left you wanting more! The saltiness of the fries and richness of the gravy balanced out nicely with the mild tasting cheese curds. The place is absolutely tiny, so if you can't get a table, order to go. There is a nice little park across the street and you can dine al fresco if it's not too icy cold. Thanks Patati for my first taste of your native specialty, poutine!"

This was eaten by one man.  I liked him immediately.  I wished I'd ordered this platter instead of my poutine.- It's a teeny place, again, not fine dining and maybe not a place to take a first date, but it's got charm, and the folks working behind the counter are young and exude happiness.  Anyway, it was nice to sit here a while."

I was handed the card machine and accidentally put 0 tip (I had the 15, 18, 20% options pulled up for me at other locations.)

The guy couldn't come out from behind the counter so I had to clean my own table since he couldn't reach.  Another no biggie but added to the experience. Got my burger first (and it was made waaaay after I ordered it) and it was just ok.  The poutine came next and it was not the one with the vegetables I asked for. But I didn't want to make a fuss. It was also just ok. I had to pretty much beg a worker to take my money as he was focused on other people. In fairness, he apologized for the price misunderstanding.

We paid $0.25 Canadian and we received 14hrs worth of parking. Admittedly, we may have paid $2.00 since we are new to the currency so prices/hr may vary.Ambiance: **** (4 stars)So say this place was small would be an overstatement. I've been in master bathrooms with more seating compacity. That said, this place had an eclectic, punk rock atmosphere to it. Since the primary language in the area is French, we were both SUPER intimidated, but the people behind and in front of the counter were inviting and helpful. Also note, the menu posted on the walls are in French so if you don't read French just ask. We took our order to go since seating was limited and only got Poutine (obviously) and a Tofu Burger.Poutine: **** (4 stars)Not knowing the difference between good and bad poutine, we really enjoyed what we consumed. There are many different variations of poutine you can purchase here but we went with 2 classic versions for our first time. One plain and one with ground sausage. Fries used in the poutine were excellent in size, similar to McDonalds fries, and were crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside. The gravy used was flavorful and thick enough to stick to the fries without making them soggy. The cheese curds were plentiful and were around to provide texture and chew more than actual flavor. We would come back to try other variations and combos.Tofu Burger: *** (3 stars)Out of left field but it was recommended to us by a woman waiting to be seating. I would qualify this more as a sandwich with burger toppings than an actual burger. The ""burger"" was small. The bread used was a quarter part of french baguette, buttery and crusty. A good foundation. The condiments included mayo, tomato, red onion, grain mustard. The star of the show was the 2 chunks of marinated tofu used. They seemed to have a light curry flavor to them and the density of the tofu was a new experience to the both of us. All in all the ""burger"" was an experience and very enjoyable, but nothing we would be craving for back in the States.Overall: **** (4 stars)As our 1st official Poutinerie, Patati Patata has set the bar pretty high. The vibe of the place was electric and all the patrons were eating and smiling. Don't be intimidated by the French menu, the people behind the counter are more than willing to help.

I'm an Asian American born and raised in North America and that comment was a slap in the face. I don't know where he might have thought I was from but does that matter? thumbs down for ignorance and poutine that was mediocre at best. thumbs up for beer and beer only (since it probably made me docile enough to tolerate inexcusable behavior from the staff)"
/user_details?userid=vCDy_Ye5pfQLOXxGqXGulQ,Jessica N.,"Denver, CO",5 star rating,"Self-proclaimed poutine-obsessed girl checking in. On my latest visit to Montreal my friend had the challenge of bringing me the best poutine in the area. I was in town for three days and was getting nervous when our schedules didn't match up on the first two days. However, the stars aligned on day three and I ended up with warm take-out poutine from Patati Patata in my hands. While this was actually my friend's second favorite poutine place, he thought I would prefer it over the other. He ordered me one with peppers, onions, and shaved beef. I usually opt for the traditional but I'm glad he forced me to go beyond that. The fries were crunchy on their own, but gave way to the gravy and became softer. This may sound bad, but I like when the fries can absorb the gravy without becoming mushy. The cheese curds were the perfect temperature even after traveling. The outside of each nugget was just starting to become warm and gooey while the inside left a cooler, squeakier end to the bite. All of the toppings worked together. I especially enjoyed the fresh and colorful peppers. I'm so used to poutine being different versions of brown, but the red and yellow peppers made the visual experience of my meal quite pleasurable. I can't say anything to the interior of the building, service, or really anything besides this one dish, but my poutine senses were thrilled and I could go back to the states a happy girl."
/user_details?userid=ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,Jando S.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,"The national junk food dish of Canada is undoubtedly poutine, the love child of gravy and cheese kurds and a potato concoction worthy of countless heart attacks.  After many encounters of this nearly banned food (#1), I'm willing to admit one of the best versions I've ever had was here at Patati Patata.This greasy spoon has a stellar reputation for serving Montreal some of the very best in comfort fare for little money.  It's been insanely crowded here almost every time I've been here and is not a place for anyone who is remotely claustrophobic.  A 15 person occupancy might be too generous of a number, but it's pretty tight in here regardless.  There is barely enough for 4 on their counter, and I've seen some folks literally just stand and eat their food.  I've been fortunate enough to score a seat each time, but that wasn't without having to wait at least 20 minutes.Their burgers are good, juicy and flavorful in every bite.  Also good are their daily soups, which in my recent case was a red beet borscht - totally worth all $2 of my money.  What most folks come for is what everyone should try, their amazing poutine.  Cheese kurds sprinkled over a bed of gravy soaked fries, makes for the kind of artery clogging ""salad"" that looks more like a stew of potatoes.  Every bite was savory, the gravy was delightful, and the cheese kurds were not in the least bit heavy.  Best of all, it cost me only $4.00 for a bowl of poutine goodness.Like only the finest of Montreal businesses, they're open fairly late.  Usually till 11PM and as late as midnight on the weekends.  Be it for breakfast or a late night anti-hangover meal or even (read: especially) a poutine craving, Patati Patata is the place to be.  _______(#1)  They tried to ban this at sporting events in an effort to become healthier and nothing like their southern neighbor.  Whatever, I've got two words:  universal healthcare."

Everything was great except that maybe they forgot it was a veggie poutine until the very end or they just did not ask. The cook threw all the veggies on the poutine raw (mushrooms, peppers, onions) which I thought was odd. We finished and my sister said it was ""ok"" and as we were paying, I noticed someone else had the same thing and they were GRILLING the veggies before putting them on the poutine.

The phrase ""Patati Patata"" is similar to ""Hakuna Matata"" from what I was told. The diner is this really cute and small place with an outgoing staff. They sell basic fast food items at super cheap prices! I opted for one hamburger and some fries with sauce. The burger was slider-size, which was why it was only $2.50. One of the employees told me that people usually order two to have their fill. If you decide to order a burger, you get a slip of paper to check off the toppings and sauces that you want on it. I liked their fries because they were done fresh. My friend, who got the fries without the sauce, told me the sauce made them taste saltier (I personally couldn't tell).Patati Patata is a very casual place and great for a quick meal for any time of the day. You wouldn't go out of your way to visit it but if you want something fast and cheap, this is the place to be! Definitely drop by if you are ever on Saint Laurent and looking for some light to eat."

/user_details?userid=ZGiwU16rhGvWAYUzkWL0xw,Boz X.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"After trying to eat here for a few times, I finally got into the restaurant without having to lineup outside.I got a bacon cheese burger and poutine for 11 something dollars, which is ok pricing.The burger had the size of a slider. You know the little round bread you get in big packages at costco? Yeh, I fear that is the bread they use. The meat patty fit well into the bun, which means it's probably the size of a 1.59$ mcdonald's hamburger patty. Except, it was well cooked and tasty. So...it's kind of worth the 2.75$ basic burger + 0.65$ cheese + 0.65$ bacon? You tell me.When I inquired about the poutine, two ladies at the counter vouched for it. The portion was ok, just enough to keep me interested throughout (I get bored real quick). The gravy was very salty, but had a particular taste (that I can't seem to place, probably because of the beer I had priorly), perhaps mushroom based, which differentiates it from a generic gravy. There was a bit too much cheese however, in terms of proportion. My last bites mainly consisted of unmelted cheese. But it does go 'squeak squeak' when I chew hahaha.I'm not a particular fan of their fries, which is sad to say, because I'd assume a restaurant calling itself 'Patati Patata' would have a great potato recipe. They were crispy but brown (gives off a bitter taste) on the outside and thinly cut so the resulting fries are rather dry (not enough of interior fluffy content).Purely in terms of taste, I'd give 4/5 for the burger, 3/5 for the poutine. Can someone, who's not a tourist eating poutine for the first time, explain to me what I am missing out?"

I'd suggest trying your choice of one or two burgers with the fries/salad plate, but upgrading the fries to a poutine is a pretty solid idea, too. There are a number of other French Canadian classics on the menu, ranging from shepherd's pie to (all day) greasy breakfast, that are all worth trying, so return visits are highly recommended if you're really high quality diner fare.The only challenge is that seating is very limited, so you might want to consider takeout if you mind waiting a few minutes for a spot."

The fries were too over fried and over salted, the gravy was too salty as well-- so much that there was not ""gravy"" taste in the gravy.  The cheese curds were in bits too small that don't provide the ""squeak"" texture you would expect in a poutine.  However, the people are wonderful here, both the staff and the customers.  Maybe the great company is what keeps this place a popular one, and maybe their other food items are great, but I came here only wanting to find out the taste of their poutine."

You're given a small piece of paper to indicate what you'd like to include in the burger. The burger is somewhat small but is just the perfect size paired with an order of fries. The fries are cut small and twice fried, which gives you the extra crunch that goes perfectly well with their made to order burger. This small joint is always busy and yet somehow you can always get a seat after a short wait. If you want fresh air, order to go and eat at the small park right across the street."

I almost didn't want to leave Montreal because of this place. But I had work on Tuesday so I had to leave. Such is life...This place was recommended to us by a former McGill student, a former Montreal resident, and a bunch of random musicians who were selling stuff at a garage sale. So we HAD to go.9, 9:30pm on the Sunday before Labor Day, we waited about 10 minutes to get seats. The staff was super nice and super helpful with recommending stuff for us to eat. The place was small but everyone in there seemed to be happy and enjoying their meals, and the decor was colorful and inviting. After sitting down I ordered a burger and a Poutine (Patati), which came with the mushrooms and bell peppers (everyone else ordered, actually, the same thing :P).First, the burger. It's this weeee little burger with a soft yet crispy and springy bun and a tiny little patty. Nothing spectacular but really, really fresh ingredients that melded nicely together in my mouth.Now for the Poutine. Let me describe it a-la Ham from the movie The Sandlot.First, you put the fries. Then, you put the sliced mushrooms. Next, you put on the sliced bell peppers and red onion. You top it off with some chewy, mild white cheese. Finally, you finish it off with a liberal helping of dark, beef gravy.  Finish by stuffing your face.The flavors blend so well together! The savory of the gravy with the sweetness and freshness of the onions and peppers, with the fried goodness from the potatoes, topped off with the mild soothing nature of the cheese, it equals an explosion of flavors that satisfies with every bite.5 stars for a cute atmosphere, super nice staff, and great PoutineRevisit?

I'm a poutine purist; I'll take the classic fries, curds, and sauce over your fancy concoctions. So just bear that in mind as I say that I'm ecstatic over their poutine.I had the standard poutine, which is made with a chicken-based sauce over a generous pile of fresh cheese curds, and underneath that fries that have been first blanched in lower-temperature oil and then finished a la minute at 375, making for a crispy fry with a fluffy interior. It's a thinner-than-normal fry for poutine (if I had to guess I'd say it's 3/8 inch), but somehow it works for me to get the textures and flavors just right for poutine. The room is tiny; there is maybe space for 15-18 at the bar, counters, and tables all told. For me it's the mark of a joint that does one thing very well, without any wish to dilute that.

My first time trying this place out was this year (I know shame on me, 8 years before it happened) but when it did, it was nothing but love love love for the place. So why is the tofu burger special? First Rule of Tofu: Don't make it try to make it what it isn't. They take the tofu cook it up, and they can add cheese to it, but the beauty is in the hummus with it. Add Tomato and Lettuce, and Voilà! Nothing too fussy, too way out there. Poutine: I did find the gravy a bit on the salty side, but I love the skinny, well-done fries and the curd to potato ratio. That's right, no soggy french fries from this joint. Salad: A tossed green salad, with options for their homemade dressing. One is creamy other is oil vinegar based. As the waiter said, it makes you feel like you didn't make the most unhealthy choice ever!Atmosphere: Tiny! I try to come here in non-peak hours, because when its busy, it's freaking busy BUT... the staff is super nice, friendly and accommodating and surprisingly they seem quite relaxed when running the show!  Definitely come back when I need a tofu burger!

Food came quickly.I had a full order of poutine and my fiancee had Poutine et Salade. The poutines were awesome, crisp clean real potato fries, a light gravy and good curds. My only complaint was that there wasn't enough gravy to melt most of the curds, otherwise it was the best poutine I had in the city. The salad was very nicely composed and all the ingredients were fresh. I paired the poutine with a Vieux Montreal Blonde, which was passable as a Blonde Ale, but seemed like the right aesthetic fit for the restaurant. Other diners were eating these adorable tiny burgers, which seemed like an excellent late night snack.Definitely a unique and welcoming representation of the city, especially late at night. Highly recommended."

They give you a small piece of paper for you to check off what type of toppings you want for your burger/hot dog. Lastly, the poutine is tasty...fries topped with thick cheese curd pieces and smoothered in gravy!

Before I was even to the register, my seat had been snatched, but I think that's more a testament to how good this place is than anything else."

But when in Montreal, eat like Montrealers, so poutine was tried and thanks to my Yelp research we found this place. Such great food, such nice people (staff and customers alike), such reasonable prices.

But Quebecois or not, the two guys behind the counter will feed you good food; the best of which are in bite-size portions - mini burgers! You can dress the beef burger any way you want but the fish burger is a house specialty. The condiments are homemade and you can taste it.

So during my visit to Montreal, I kept bugging my husband that we had to stop by Patati Patata so I could try their ""classique"" poutine.  I agree with other reviewers - this place is really cramped and not for the claustrophobic.  The place seats only 13 people max and it is not a place where you want to bring your kids.  It is definitely more for take out.  You need to know exactly what you want, otherwise you'll have the cashier and cook saying unpleasant things in french under their breath. It happened to my friend, when she wanted to know what another customer was having.  They just want you to give a straight order. The wait is incredibly long with the line out the door so be prepared to wait at least 20 mins.Overall, i really enjoyed the poutine! The thin cut fries, meaty gravy, and cheese were just the right amount to complement one another.  I don't like it when there's too much gravy that is makes the fries soggy within the first minutes and it becomes a think bowl of muck. However, the portion seemed rather small for the price that I paid and in comparison to other places that serve poutine.If the portion had been bigger I would have definitely given it 4 stars."

/user_details?userid=cL5jML80rWAyzC1z_v4HWw,Clarence W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A Main staple, Patati Patata is a charming little fast food joint with a substantial menu and cheap eats. Unless you want to wait in a line, it's best to get there off peak hours. I find it's best in the late afternoon.Their menu has typical fast food such as burgers (mini-burgers actually) and fries, but also the not-so-typical, such as tofu burgers and borscht. Personally, I'm a big fan of the Patatine, club sandwich and tofu burgs.The Patatine is a poutine topped with green+red peppers, mushrooms, onions and whole kalamata olives. This may sound weird, but the fresh veggies accent the fries, curds and gravy perfectly. Patati Patata uses distintive shoe-string fries and great tasting, fresh (and firm) cheese curds in the poutine....both of these set theirs apart from a lot of other poutines in the city. I'm a big fan.The club sandwich is a triple-decked white bun with chicken salad, bacon, tomato and lettuce. Using the chicken salad is a nice spin on the classic, and the sandwich as a whole is straight-up delicious. The tofu burger is simple but tasty: quickly-fried slab of tofu on a bun with lettuce, tomato, hummus and mayo. It's mini-size, and at only $1.50, is a great cheap snack. As for the atmosphere, as mentioned by others, the place is quite small. It only seats about 10-12 max, and when it's at capacity it can feel pretty cramped. If you can't deal with this, just get take-out. If you do eat in, you'll find a super relaxed atmosphere with comfortable stools, and a friendly staff (def. improved over few years ago...it had a little bit of an 'unfriendly' rep). Overall, it's a great place to sit in the window, grab a quick bite and watch the bustle of Boul St.-Laurent."

/user_details?userid=k6Dkp7HD9_DcVuwhjNO56g,Pasha A.,"PACIFIC PALISADES, CA",5 star rating,Amazing place.. Even though the burger was WAY too small it rivals the counter in LA and my favorite burger.  The poutine is pretty tasty as well.  It  is a VERY VERY small place and you will prob have to wait a bit to get a seat but great atmosphere and food.
/user_details?userid=PAIwBZoHKlGyCJ3KekCEcA,Josh S.,"Fairfax, VA",3 star rating,"Maybe this place is great for locals, but my friends and I (tourists from NY) didn't have great experience with this place when we visited. I had poutines from different parts of Canada as this wasn't my first time visiting. I wanted to try some authentic poutine where locals go for eats. I googled many different places and selected this one for try before we leave for Ottawa the next day.It's an extremely tiny place. But it's okay, you can get it to go and eat it at the park right next to the restaurant. Actually, this may be better option because the inside is extremely crowded and small that you probably can't even move around. It's best described as fast-food joint. You can get burgers, sandwiches, and of course, poutines here. I believe they also serve beer. I got a cheese-burger and poutine to go with a drink. The price wasn't all that bad so if I can get used to local taste, I can see myself coming back here frequently for more good stuff (but I live too far now).The poutines were alright. I had better poutines in Ottawa. Maybe this is the authentic taste and one I had previously were for tourists. The portions weren't too big either - more of individual size so not great for sharing. The gravy was too think and didn't much have other ingredient tastes in my mind. The burgers were pretty good though. I live in Washington DC where we have about 8 great burger joints in 10 mile radius, so I wouldn't say this is one of better ones I had, but definitely better than poutine I ordered. It saved my night.The service was bit slow. Maybe they just had a lot of orders prior to mine. I think I waited at least 20 minutes for my burger and poutine. They only had a dude and gal cooking up and one dude taking orders. I don't know whether this is a family owned business or not but they could use more hands to speed up the process. I hate the non-value-adds. Lean it up!"

The veggie burger was so good I had to get a second. Overall, the prices are okay, but the portions are small and there aren't a whole lot of seats available, so I wouldn't recommend this for large groups unless you're doing takeaway."
/user_details?userid=Mt7q9U48KiAJKivYRB5vog,Corinne R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I really enjoy this little resto on St. Laurent. It is cozy on a frigid day and offers cute slider tofu burgers for cheap. Their poutine is very good and the price is always right. Try it out!
/user_details?userid=Tc3GAQdAfOW542ROdyCZPg,Kat K.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",4 star rating,"Tiny little closet of a place, very limited seating. Their poutine has great flavour, not overly greasy. Only complaint, you may have to wait a bit to get their attention to order take-out."
/user_details?userid=7qzfClFiE3SchM3F3MwIpA,N P.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Did you actually notice it? I can't tell how many times I have walked pass this corner after my St Laurent tribulations.You will find the tiniest spot blessed with an infinite Plateau charm. Watch out, you may way wait to be seated and don't try to bring a group with you. I visited Patati Patata during a weekday around 9:30ish and I waited 15 min to be seated. I believe it's decent given the popularity of the spot.Once seated, aim for the Boeuf Bourgeois (equivalent to a hamburger) and the Fish burger - extra bacon it tho. Note that you can customize your beef burger. By the way odd detail: according to the staff, nobody takes the tofu burger. And of course, get the poutine. Moreover, the beer is decent despite what the pricing may suggest.But little price implies little food. Yes, portions are small. You're better off ordering two burgers and a side dish. For approximately $6-$7 if you add cheese... and $2 for a beer."
/user_details?userid=x6AuideIwpmvm_I_dW6NWA,Daniel D.,"Sag Harbor, NY",5 star rating,"Went here for breakfast for the second time and was introduced to PP's significant poutine. I mean, the breakfast was amazing, and the poutine was a contender, for sure. Patati Patata's just made some big-time friends.My recommendation for breakfast, get the omelette. Or the crepes, both are great. The only thing is, if you get the omelette, you get their delicious black bean stuff and home fries alongside. For lunch and dinner, the poutine is a must, and the sliders won't disappoint."

And it wasn't a ridiculously large portion so a friend and I could share it and still have room for a burger or two. Speaking of which, I had 2 small burgers (mini burgers) and they were delicious. I got all the toppings on it and the bread it was on was so good and you could tell it had been made fresh! There were only 3 guys working when I went and they were serving people very fast! Although this place feels like a little broom closet inside, it packs a lot of flavor!"

For the record, my only other experience with poutine was in Toronto and I was totally underwhelmed. The poutine at this place is completely different and much better. The burgers are slider size, so if you get a burger with fries and salad, you won't be stuffed. I'll definitely return next time I'm in the area."
/user_details?userid=rTJ3EecGoQNbfFj7mqjDmw,Elizabeth D.,"Tampa, FL",4 star rating,"I daydreamed about swimming in a pool of poutine all during the 6 hour drive to Montreal. Did Patati Patata meet the expectations I had set so high as a result of fond childhood memories? I'd say so.They serve up some pretty darn good poutine at this place. The fries were just a wee bit more brown than golden for my taste, but they had a nice crunch without tasting burnt. I would definitely give them 5 stars if they had put a bit more gravy.I also sampled the poutine with vegetables. It was alright, but it kind of reminded me of a supreme pizza.Hmmmmm, I guess I'll just have to try it again next time and see if I can't bump it up to a 5 star rating..."

The fries were fresh, the gravy rich and the curds creamy.  A perfect marriage for a delicious heart attack!(A day later I will add that I enjoyed it more than Joe Beef.  Yes, I said it.)"

Everybody raves about the poutine, as they should, it's the best in Montreal. But everything else is amazing too, and much healthier. The mediteranean burger and fish filet are my favorite, along with the salad that's just perfect (the sour cream dressing is the best!). The soups are great too, and keep an eye out for the roast beef weekdays for lunch, they make a mean cheezy sandwich with it!"

The poutine looked beautiful and was prepared very well though. The burger patties they pack are small and reminiscent of a McDonald's burger in size and shape (thickness) but were seasoned well, of good quality meat and cooked perfectly also. I've never had a burger this way (and after all, its just a hamburger) but I was surprised and rather delighted nonetheless. They give you a list of toppings that you check off on like an order sheet which was pretty handy. Place is tiny and has a lot of character. Definitely a fun, quick stop when navigating around this beautiful city."

I went there at night because Ive seen the huge line ups to this place during supper. It was good and seeing thee amount of take outs these guys get I knew I was in for something great while seated in the small corner. The atmosphere is great for students and it also advertises many local events in the restaurants, in case you're someone looking around for whats going on in town.The service is very private and very very NOT intimidating at all. There's only two people serving anyway (one cooking and the other serving) so it felt really nice to be chatting it up with them too without feeling like someones just trying to be nice for you know what .. .  ANYWAY all I'm saying is that I always go at night in this place (well the two times I've been here so far) and the food AND service was great even just before closing, not what you can say about most places. My poutine with ground beef was really really good. I highly recommend it... wow that was a lot of  ""ands"" I want to keep on adding ands but those you have to go and check it..

There are only several seats and if you go at prime dinner hours the line is out the door, but I have to say the food is worth the wait. The poutine is some of the best I've had in Montreal, but my favorite thing to order here is the Mediterranean Burger. It has feta on it, with a special tzatziki/mint sauce that is delicious. The burgers are small, made with fresh ingredients, and the fries are perfectly done. Their salad dressings are homemade and are also very good. They have a breakfast menu as well, but I have never tried anything off of it. If you haven't been, it's a definite spot to hit! Oh yes, and it's cheap - you can get a burger, fries, and salad for $6. I don't think it gets much better than that."
