The place is very quaint, the decor makes you feel at home and welcomed. We ordered some local beer, some cocktails and had 5 pizzas and 3 salades each dish so very good.  The dough is well cooked, very thin and the ingredients definitely very fresh. We ordered the margarita, the arugula and chicken pizzas, the potato and kale salads.  The.servuce was attentive and friendly. I would def go back."
/user_details?userid=dIh3-PmA8UN3nRSHrGZLbg,Corey P.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,"Cafe Parvis has never disappointed! Hidden on a side street in downtown MTL, this cafe has a little bit of everything. From pastries and caffeinated drinks to artisan pizza and brunch plates, you can not go wrong with any decision made here. For the Yelpers who love a beautiful interior and dope aesthetics, this is the place for you! Live plants and vines are draped throughout the cafe with splashes of vintage gold, soft lighting, and various textures. I chose the margherita pizza with some filtered coffee. The dough was crispy on the outside and incredibly soft and airy on the inside. The toppings were fresh and blended together very well. Definitely a place for small events, dates, solo outings, you name it! Definitely recommend if you visit MTL!"
/user_details?userid=c4lTZbA8NeZBgB1YYB6Izg,Julie C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been here many times (and their sister bar next door; Bar Furco). This review is for a dinner I had here recently. My best friend wanted to have the pizza from Café Parvis as her last ""normal"" pizza before she completely cut out gluten from her diet. We shared the margherita pizza and the mushroom pizza (with portabello mushroom and sautéed kale with hazelnut, cream sauce and parmesan). I appreciated that the basil came shredded on the margherita so you had some with each bite. The mushroom pizza was my personal favourite and I even took one to go afterwards for my boyfriend! We also had a few samples of their wine selections courtesy of our amazing server, Gustavo who was very friendly and knowledgeable."
/user_details?userid=7zkmP0Eav9LnkgjASOVmLw,Abe K.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"Just arriving into the city for the weekend, not knowing what to eat, we stumbled upon this place and what a cute place! I had the trout burger which gave me an orgasm in my mouth (Hope that's appropriate for Yelp reviews because if it isn't, Cafe Parvis may have to take it off their menu). Their eggplant salad wasn't what I expected (salad with eggplant). It is actually bunch of eggplant with little kale (which I actually loved). Not knowing how popular this place was, my partner and I got lucky. It probably helped coming in around 2pm but there was exactly one table open for us."
/user_details?userid=a2c2wJ5Yo7vMVurhCeYEmw,Becca C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This is my new favourite cafe in all of Montreal. I was looking for a nice brunch spot in the heart of downtown Montreal and was very pleased to find Café Parvis. As always, I checked out the yelp page and menu beforehand and it looked great. I got there and had the option of either sitting at the bar or joining another couple at a larger table.  We really wanted a seat by the window and saw someone else finishing up so we took the spot at the bar and waiting for the table to become available. While seated at the bar, we saw the bartender making a cold brew lemonade which she offered us a sample taste of. It was so delicious I've started trying to get a similar drink made for me at my local Starbucks (not as good, but close). We ended up ordering and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time. Everything was delicious!! Due to a dietary restriction, I asked to make an alteration to my pizza order but they could not accommodate it. It was kind of upsetting since it would have saved them money and it didn't seem to busy, but that's okay. All of the food was amazing and I'm looking forward to returning."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here for brunch on a saturday. It wasn't too crowded but it was probably due to the rain. We sat at the bar and I had their iced latte and the pan fried fish. The coffee was a bit too sour and I didn't finish it. However, the pan fried fish was perfectly cooked with crispy edges and a soft and tender inside. It came with caviar and some mushed puree and the combination was delicious. I wasn't really full after the meal but can't deny that it was delicious. It's located on a small hidden street between metro mcgill and Places des arts. The service was quick and the staff was nice. Gotta go back to try their pizza another time."
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",3 star rating,"finally gave this place a try as it came highly recommended. After everything I had heard I wanted to love it but while the experience wasn't bad, I wasn't blown away either. We came here on a Wednesday night and sat at the bar (they were very strict about where to sit at the bar even though it was wide open and not mean for people with reservations).  Very cute place , good for a date or a night out without breaking the bank , the decor is very airy and beautiful. The hostess was odd , she seemed sort of annoyed that we were even speaking to her to ask if they had space for us. however after that at least The bartender/server we had was friendly. We had sangria (I had the red & my friend had the white) , both were exceptional ,fruity and fresh and not too sweet. We also ordered pizzas , both pizzas were decent , the dough was well cooked and tasty but the toppings ,while fresh , severely lacked flavour. I would be curious to come back and try their brunch though or one of their other dishes since I heard so many great things I'm hoping maybe I just ordered the wrong dish. definitely try this place for yourself and I would to go back perhaps for brunch in hopes of being able to update my review !"

Salami, bell pepper, and zucchini pizza with jalapeño and basil sauce (we got it without cheese) - flavorful and unique 2. Bread pudding - tastyMy husband enjoyed his refreshing rhubarb and basil cocktail, and I quite liked my spicy ginger beer.The service was friendly and prompt.  They found us a table that had space to park our baby in her stroller, which we appreciated.The atmosphere here is fantastic and the biggest reason to come here.  The space is filled with lovely plants hanging from above and has plenty of seating.  There was a pianist / singer crooning softly for a portion of our meal.The only downside was the bathroom.  It was a bit cramped and I had a hard time figuring out how to use the sink - it turned out the faucet was pedal operated and when you push down, the water gushes out at an uncomfortably high volume.  Also, there was no baby changing table available, which was disappointing.Overall, this was a great spot to relax for a couple hours, and I'd highly recommend it."

Seeing the nice street side terrasse they have right now was great! The little tables looked fantastic, with all the flowers, herbs and other plants around them. Since it was late morning on a weekday, there wasn't a lot of people and we snatched one of those lovely little marble tables by the window. We each got a latte and shared a croissant. The latte art was lovely and the coffee was good. So glad that I live so close to this plate!"

I don't remember exactly what we ordered (the menu changes all the time), but a slice of pizza each and a salad was exactly enough lunch for two.  This definitely isn't your traditional pizza place - very original flavors (I wish I could give it a 4.5 only because the flavors have been a hit or miss for me). The coffee bar here is very nice as well!"
/user_details?userid=-8nmj3B-tfY_vFiimtBOsw,Sanaz N.,"Laval, Canada",2 star rating,"I went ti Café Parviz towards the end of summer and I was really excited by it as I heard great things about the place. Their breakfast options are limited and tend to be more and the healthy side. I chose a type of egg dish and when I received if I was disappointed that the actual hard boiled egg was cold. Also their drink and not good, the hot chocolate taste more like water and powder and again it was warm not HOT. The croissant was not fresh way too crispy and hard.Although and the plates looked good and had nice visuals on the plate, but the taste did not meet my expectations.The positive about the place, it is smack downtown maybe a 1 minute walk to the bay, very well decorated, it had a nice friendly vibe, nicely decorated with plants everywhere."

An error occurred in our reservations and a large group of us showed up at 17:00 on a busy Friday evening. Instead of turning us away, they found an innovative alternative and we had an amazing evening. I would have recommended your resto for your delicious food and drinks, but now I highly recommend it for your super service ! A special thanks to the waiter who showed professionalism and patience with the arrangement ! Thank you again!"

/user_details?userid=jXdnU8ONRIHVzhmDBvlmOQ,Ali A.,"Downtown, Canada",5 star rating,We had lunch here after a big day to celebrate. This was my first time here and our friends brought us indeed. It is a hidden gem and you never guess it could be where it is!We had pizza and a salad (the one with quinoa in it!) both delicious and yummy. The pizza comes in square slices and either mixing it with a salad or a soup makes a perfect mid-week lunch.There was a lineup during the whole 2-hour time we've been here.There are pretty plants  hanging from the ceiling which made it look and feel good while eating.The food is not expensive in terms of per menu item but it is above average when you see it portion size wise!Staff are cool and helpful!
/user_details?userid=K8fUIB7EvnuNvw8d7rPJBQ,Jeff W.,"Scottsdale, AZ",5 star rating,"Our first meal in Montreal and it did not disappoint! First off, the restaurant is very quaint and charming. The greenery throughout gives a warm ambiance and charm. As for the food...it was terrific. Had the mushroom appetizer for starters. It was flavorful to say the least. The mushrooms are in a batter that is flat-out delicious. For the main course we had the turkey pizza which was excellent. For dessert we indulged in the bread pudding with butterscotch sauce, which was heavenly. While not normally a fan of butterscotch, this sauce was nothing short of amazing. Much more rich and flavorful than any other butterscotch I've had. And the bread pudding had the perfect texture (important with this dish).Service was attentive and accommodating. A wonderful dining experience from start to finish!"
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,I've been trying to discover the vegetarian/vegan scene a bit more so I knew I had to check this place out and it didn't disappoint. I sat outside so I can't really vouch for how comfortable it is. But their little terrace is only comfortable if you're in the shade. We were seated right under the sun and it was not pleasant. The chairs are metallic so you start to sweat and stick to it and it's not a fun way to have a meal. Service is really quick and the busboy circled many times to give us water (thank god) which is a plus because lots of places forget to refill your water. We ordered the vegan burger and pear/bacon pizza to share and I'm still raving about it. Who knew putting pear on a pizza with bacon would create such beautifulness? The taste is perfectly balanced with a hint of sweet and salty. The burger was also delicious. I'm really getting into bean patties because they're so mushy and taste so good with avocado and lettuce. It came with a side salad too with just the right amount of zesty vinaigrette. Excellent Excellent!!!
/user_details?userid=YxEsJxOVruu1ECeNwFSJeA,Chrisstina S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Okay...we went back at rush hour (foolish, I know) hoping to get a seat on the terrasse, but no dice. He said there is an hour wait, unless you sit on these couches in the corner. I said ""definitely!"" He said we should look at it first. UMMM we got the best seats in the house! That was wicked! Also the sangria is delicious, HOWEVER...if you have a sweet tooth, you NEED to have the butterscotch bread pudding. One of the best desserts I've ever had. This last visit was amazing, my new favourite place! (Guys, go get the bread pudding)"
/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"3.5*I enjoyed the vibe here but probably would have more positive things to say had I not been dying of heat for most of the meal. We arrived around 18:30 on a Friday night to a full house. We wanted to sit on the terrasse but there was no room. They brought us to a table all the way in the back and up some stairs instead. The restaurant is hip and decorated nicely. Unfortunately, where they seated us, there was absolutely no air circulation and it was uncomfortably hot. Food-wise, it was good. I wouldn't say it was the best pizza that I've tasted and found it a bit pricey for what it was. I checked the lunch menu and found it to be much more worthwhile. The menu has a lot of unique options and I think it would be worth a second try, perhaps on a day where it isn't +30 C out."
/user_details?userid=5a2LJ4Q6WnT5p9934mAWHw,Meghan K.,"Portland, OR",3 star rating,"This place serves up some good food and drinks, but the overall experience was a little... awkward.We arrived just at the tail end of breakfast hours on a Weds looking for some adult beverages as we had a very big early morning life event to celebrate (it was 5oclock in our hearts okay!). We asked the hostess if we could just come in for drinks and sit at the bar. She said yes and kindly set us up at the bar. We waited for a while... finally asked for drink menus... waited even longer... and finally were asked for our order. Ordered our drinks and were told the bar is not open. Ok, well we just wanted drinks, we said. It will be open in 30 minutes she said. Okay cool, not too bad, so we opted to wait. The bar tender finally arrived, and it seemed like he and the original server were whispering to each other about us. Felt very awkward even the I HOPE she was explaining to him we just wanted drinks. Felt quite a bit judged for seeking alcohol so early on a week day...We then again told the bar tender our drink order and he informed us we also had to order food. I don't know, I'm from the West Coast USA so maybe I'm just totally ignorant to local rules. Well, we had literally just came from breakfast but we had made it so far in this quest for drinks we gave in and ordered a slice of pizza. After one hour of promise and potential, we finally had our celebratory bevs and they were DELICIOUS. And so was the slice of pizza! Despite feeling a bit like the servers judgmentally thought we were voracious alcoholics, would return to this place with a more clear idea of of the drinking rules :)"
/user_details?userid=vobdIpinYzfRo3PKXM0foA,Hannah C.,"Chelsea, Canada",4 star rating,"I've probably gone to Café Parvis about 10 times and it really is the place to go and catch up with a friend over pizza and a bottle of wine. The candlelight and plants make it hip and warm and cozy, and the general atmosphere is lovely. Their menu changes frequently but they always hold onto a few staples, so if you want a classic Margherita or a totally original pizza combo issue is the place to go. Love this spot, you should definitely swing by!!"

It was a great alternative to alcohol on a hot and sunny day, plus we were able to get a spot on the terrace! Service was impeccable but was never able to connect to the wifi even after asking twice for the password. Other than that, I'd definitely want to go again for food this time!"

They're colourful, delicious, and healthy I GUESS but I'm mostly ordering them because I'm not a huge pizza gal. Having said that, the pizzas are good too - one large slice, usually topped with things like eggplant and prosciutto, so expect a slightly ~fancier~ pizza!The tea is also lovely, and I would definitely recommend the hojicha (it's my favourite)!"
/user_details?userid=GWC6I7DI6r4blEkuFmUaNA,Tara C.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"We totally stumbled upon this restaurant as we were taking a leisurely stroll though the city. If you can impress me with your decor, I'll like you a whole lot. If you can impress me with your food AND your decor? I'll like you bunches beyond bunches beyond bunches. And now I'm crushing hard on the bar and the vibe in this spot. Totes Barcrush. It's just so sexy. So, I ordered a salad. It was loaded with capers, fingerling potatoes, crispy prosciutto, hard boiled egg, romain lettuce and a dill/dijon/goodness, dressing. Man, this salad was solid. I could eat that thing all day long. The dishes my friends got looked delicious, but, I won't expand on that because I looked up, looked back down & went to town on that salad. The flavors they merge together somehow work and it kind of humbles your tastebuds, in a phenomenal way.But listen, the vibe and decor in this joint makes me feel good and I think it might do the same to you."

/user_details?userid=rjWAylKG5sOfCw0k9eGLVQ,Janet T.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"A provincial Spring island nestled in a winter wonderland!True to the Yelp reviews the Cafe is kid friendly. We ordered the steak and eggs for two. The meat was slightly under medium rare (we didn't mind) and seasoned wonderfully. The watercress provided a poignant bite that brought everything together. The egg had a nice crisp texture. The roasted potatoes had hearty peppercorn and salt that complemented the crunchiness of the potatoes. Cold pressed medley of juices was the perfect balance (hard to achieve with fresh ginger). All in all a wonderful spot. Though if you're sensitive to sound, you may want to bring ear plugs because you definitely do not want to miss this."
/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I pass this gorgeous floral café on a daily basis, aweing at its colourful botanical terrasse. As I work in the area, some colleagues and I decided to go for lunch one Friday afternoon.The interior is just as beautiful as the exterior, dim lighting with floral motifs on the walls and vines hanging above - it is as if you have entered a secret garden!At first, we were rudely told by the girl at the door that there's no space on the terrasse and to sit inside. We were taken right into the back of the restaurant, past the bar area and close to the bathrooms. It was dark and a little claustrophobic... perhaps great during the colder months but it's summer! We want sun!Finally after asking her to try again, we got a great place on the terrasse - closer to Furco (which they share the terrasse with).The lunch menu was short and simple with unique choices of pizzas & salads. We all requested the soup of the day (Gazpacho!) only to be told it was finished... very disappointing seeing as we were there around 12.30pm! Our waiter then explained how their lunch system works - which was confusing. The pizza on the menu refers to 1 slice and if we are hungry, to make it double or quadruple portions... same with the salads. Reading the reviews below, I think the whole pizzas are served during dinner time? At lunch, the pizza slices were already prepared beforehand and comes up to about 10-15$ per slice... a bit pricey for one pizza square?We all went ahead and ordered our individual portions - I had a roast vegetable pizza with caramelized onions, ricotta and balsamic... despite it being small, it was super delicious and unusual.. I savoured every single bite. I complimented the pizza to the waiter and he mentioned that their menu changes every couple of months, so it is definitely worth checking out the weird & wonderful combinations they come up with!Overall, I had a great time but will not be back for lunch. The menu was overpriced for pizzas that were prepared way in advance and served as a slice (and not too warm either). They should also prepare a larger quantity of soup seeing as they have a line-up almost on a daily basis! Will definitely be back to check out the dinner menu!"

/user_details?userid=QRIzeHyThRsY6_N7r4A4tw,Shaw T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is a preliminary review based only on their service and coffee, both of which have consistently scored very high over a period of about a year. Since I first started writing this review, I also had the chance to try their soup of the day, as explained below.Café Parvis's commitment to light- to medium- roast coffee beans is a breath of fresh air in dark-roast-obsessed montreal. I had the pleasure of trying  Café Parvis's soup of the day at lunchtime today: the crème de cauliflower. It had a hint of jalapeño, had a mix of nuts sprinkled on top, and was a pure delight even in today's heat. I think there may have been some cheese, but that will remain a mystery. The place is always packed with an eye-pleasing crowd, definitely leaning towards the trendy and the hipster-y, and for good reason: their menu offerings are well thought out and, as far as i can tell, excellently executed, their service is cordial, yet discreet (which I find is a delicate balance you don't easily encounter), the setting and design are stunning - why wouldn't I try to fit this into your day?They also bake pizzas that look amaaaazing - will edit this review once I have tried one of them.If Parvis is on your list, there is no better time than today to treat yourself"

Been here twice for their coffee and the beans used are on the fruity side which is not my favorite. I usually like to add a little bit of sugar to my cortado just to bring out the flavor of the beans but the sugar just kills the coffee when fruity beans are used.The place has big wooden table everywhere and big windows so lots of sunlight :)I have seen their pizza and they look really delicious although I haven't tried them myself.

I was very happy to see that it's walking distance from my work. Arriving there, I saw that it was quite full and I had to wait to be seated. I decided to be seated inside. I loved the decor with the fresh plants hanging and the old walls as well as furnitures. It gives you a vintage feeling which made me feel happy. I went through the menu and the pizza was very interesting as they had so many fresh ingredients such as kale, cod fish etc... the waiter came and took my order with which I was pleased but he mentioned that they're tiny pieces and I was quite disappointed. One piece is $8 which is not very filling and I found it quite expensive After 10-15 minutes of wait, my food arrived and at first bite, I found that my pizza crust was not fresh and felt really hard on the teeth, I'm assuming that they were leftovers and that they just served it by warming it up again and I was very disappointed by it. I thought the food is fresh and good as this is what I have heard but going in today made me realized that I spent $25 including for nothing as it wasn't good at all. I will not return."

It is tucked away on the small streets in the downtown core near the Place des Arts metro station. I really love the decor there- it is eclectic meets romantic. The adorable laissez-faire ambience really lets you be at ease and just take in the time you enjoy with your friends or loved ones there.I highly recommend their drinks and the pizza as well. They have interesting flavours and when I was there- the brie and fig pizza was really good.It is spacier than you imagine so it is good for groups as well but places like these are hard to find."

I recently shifted dangerously close to this cafe and tried it few weeks back- I ordered the chicken and waffles and propogandized my friends to order the pizzas. The fresh ingredients and the surprisingly well balanced flavors teleported me to food heaven (I instantly came back and sent details of the dish on my family newsletter) This place is like Disneyland for crazy foodies- the ingredients are odd but when they put it all together it's just a masterpiece. So far I have tried the chicken sandwich, waffles and chicken, watercress pizza, lemon ricotta poppy seed cake, croissant and I kid you not- NOTHING has disappointed. I highly recommend this place to everyone, it has cute interiors and the whole plants and rustic furniture adds a vintage charm to the space. The staff are more than helpful with a pasted kind smile. For sure, I'm going to keep going cause I'm determined to find out atleast one dish they haven't perfected (that's my excuse) Great place, insanely good food!"

We each took a coffee, machiatto and latte, and shared a scone but noticed they also have a good menu selection. It was a nice sunny day, and we were able to sit by the open window/terrasse. Loved the greenery from the hanging plants plus the vibe, it was a nice relaxing atmosphere away from the busyness and the rush of people getting out from work in downtown. Worth a stop!

The cocktails seemed fun as well. For the main course- one word PIZZAA! Delish. Gourmet styled oven baked pizza served on a naan-like bread. The marguerita pizza was great not too heavy as a meal-12$ only! And large enough to share or take leftovers home. For dessert- I would've loved to have their home baked cookies but they ran out quickly :( the person next to me had the last one!!! Salad bowls looked delectable - on my bucket list to try out next!My phone was dead, my words don't do justice to how pretty the food was."

I've liked everything I've had here before. The portions are smaller than most restaurants but good too not feel too full afterwards. Pricey compared to others as well but the food feels unique and quality. Service can be a bit slow because they can get very busy but the staff is helpful about the menu. Cafe drinks here are good too! The patio is also very nice when the weather's good. I'll be back.

Inside, the atmosphere was fantastic with dozens of beautiful plants hanging from above, creating a dramatic and comfortable spot to enjoy their amazing gourmet pizza. The service was super friendly and accommodating to our friend's dietary needs by making half of our pizzas cheese-free. Wonderful selection of craft beer! Excellent prices. Next door is a louder restaurant & bar, owned by the same people, which would also be great (but was too loud for our preference that night). Perfect for couples, groups and families. The next time I'm in Montreal, I'll be back with the kids!"
/user_details?userid=SGr-sicgWm3mIImhxEIjiQ,DoYeon K.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"They have a creative menu. I ordered the pizza with bechamel sauce, bacon, endive, gruyere, pear and hazelnuts. It was really good! Their pizza bread was like crunchy flatbread, I liked it a lot better than regular rising pizza dough. I'd eat the bread on its own and enjoy it almost as much as the pizza. The mix of nuttiness from the toasted hazelnut, saltiness from the crispy bacon, and the sweetness from the pear and the caramelized endives was suuuper nice. None of the toppings were overwhelming and everything blended nicely.My only complaint is that the portions were too small compared to its price, I felt they were too sparing with the toppings. Either go a bit more ham with the toppings or lower the prices by a few dollars.The people and the place were really nice, with plants and terrace at the front and the inside felt really cozy. I recommend!"
/user_details?userid=Qwrbfgn8iGcHQ5MaQfXiTA,Seasy H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been here a few times already, so this review is going to be reflective of all my experiences here and not just my last. The ambience: one of most insta-worthy restaurants and cafes I've been to in this city. The vines, wooden tables, and glasses create a charming and hipster environment that you can't help but want to photograph, especially in the day. I'm not sure about the night, since I've only been there once in the evening but sat on the terrace. I can't help but wonder how they manage to keep so many plants alive.The food: I've liked everything that I've tried so far, which is pretty impressive considering I've been there four or five times. The coffee is, in my opinion, some of the best downtown. The pizzas are amazing. The service: fast, attentive, and professional. Our glasses were kept well-filled even when we were sitting outside, which is always a mark of good service to me."
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Location: Downtown core. If you're using transit, you can get off at McGill or Place-des-Arts and it'll be a short walk from both. Street parking is 'available' but metered. That being said, good luck finding a spot, especially with all the construction. Use the subway or walk.The place: I walked in and thought I'd already been here before because it reminds me so much of Falco, next door. A lot of wood, big windows - it's a pretty cozy place. We lucked out and got a seat by the window. If you plan on going for lunch on a weekday, get there before Noon or call to see if they take reservations. It fills up pretty quickly. The goods: My date and I ordered individual pizzas (meaning that we were too selfish to share) and two salads (we shared those). She went with the veggie pizza while I chose the Italian sausage variety. So first, these pizzas are small, but since each dish is meant to be shared, I'm OK with that. I think that if you were dining alone and ordered a pizza + salad, you'd be good to go. Anyway, the sausage pizza was quite delicious. The only downside is that there was nothing hot about it. In terms of salad, we ordered the beet and the cauliflower. I enjoyed both, and the portions were actually fairly large so we had some leftovers that we just couldn't finish. I think it would be nice to have the beet salad served warm, but that's just my preference. One thing I will say - the cheese that is served with this salad (goat, I think?) was SO bloody good. Service: Overall, the service was good - our water glasses were always full and staff checked on us regularly. However, we were asked five times if we were done, when our salad bowls were visibly NOT empty. While I certainly appreciate the desire to clear tables quickly, I don't want to be asked if I'm done, that many times. We were a bit put off by this. Price point: Each dish ranges between $6-$10, if I recall."

/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,After the line-up was too long at our first choice of restaurant my aunt and I came here since it was nearby and the wait for a table was much more reasonable.  The restaurant features an open kitchen and is a really inviting space with lots of natural light.  It gets busy at lunch so a reservation would probably be a good idea. The menu here is small and focused.  You can get salads and/or pizzas.  We decided to each get a salad and I also added a braised beef empanada to that.  Now salads don't exactly evoke much excitement but these ones aren't your typical salad.  My lentil salad was loaded with a bunch of different vegetables and I really enjoyed the dressing.  I also tried a mouthful of my aunt's beet salad which had a yogurt dressing and that one was pretty good too.  My empanada was very crispy on the outside.  The bill for two before tip was $38 (and that also included a coffee) so it is what you would expect to pay downtown.The service was the low point of the meal for me.  First up we waited a long time for our food to be brought out and when it finally did come the arrival of the dishes were staggered.  We also never got any refills of our water which would have been appreciated.While I really enjoyed the food I was a little turned off by the service.  It was also really noisy inside the restaurant and I did not enjoy having to speak really loudly to be able to make conversation.  It's an okay option if you're in the area but I would suggest looking elsewhere first.

The thing is, it's about the only thing. I ordered a orange pekoe tea and the waffle with poached egg and bacon. When I received the tea it was really blend. They didn't put enough tea leaves in the little bag... I was drinking hot water basically. When I told them, they told me they would charge me for another bag of tea. So I said no thank you. Then the food arrived. Looked OK. I mean, the salad looked blend and without seasoning. When I tried... it was mainly salad with oil. I had to ask for lemon wedge. Just because no salt, pepper or vinaigrette was added. Then the waffle. What a disappointment... the waffle itself was soggy... bacon really thick and over cooked (but not crispy) and the egg was barely and poached egg. The best thing on this plate was the maple syrup. Unfortunately. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. SO, overall impression.Service: OKFood: mediocre Ambiance: beautiful. That's why I'm giving a 2/5 I'll try the lunch next time.

There are a number of tasty pizza options served with slices in a pile on a cutting board for sharing. There are also these delicious sounding salads on the menu that are served up in single, double or 4 person portions which I will totally go back for. There seems to be a rotating selection of house organic wines on offer along with a couple ok beers. There was no cocktail menu available despite my super kind and funny waitress asking around for one for me. The other thing I found off-putting was the insistent way another staff members swept all around me, not making eye contact with me, while I sat there breathing dust. Personally I'd say: hey maybe skip sweeping a table if it's already occupied and focus on making customers feel comfortable. The rest of the staff did this is spades, they were funny, easy-going, chill. I think this is a new place working some kinks out but an exceptional addition to the downtown options."

My order was served quickly, but unfortunately for me, the food was less than warm, it tasted ok but nothing extraordinary. I won't be going back for brunch but will probably visit again to try their lunch or dinner menu."

I got here for lunch, ordered a pizza. The waitress was very kind, she translated all the items on the menu to English to me and I went with her recommendation of the pizza. The pizza was really well executed, so many different layers of taste. It got the crunch pickle and onion, really soft potato, chewy beef slices (kind of like prosciutto) and the pizza bread tasted like baguette, crispy outside and soft inside. Costed me about $20 for just the pizza. A little overpriced for a small pizza. I understand the concept but I don't buy it. There were also lots of plants inside the restaurant, cool decor, really refreshing. Not your typical coffee shop nor your typical pizza place. However, it was kind of dark inside and this location can be tough to find. Take it as an adventure :P"
/user_details?userid=lPqIwC1QWXq7OY0sm-Vc9A,Shadoe H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of these where there's always a caveat attached at the end of whatever compliment I have. As in: I think this place is great and you'll enjoy it, BUT I'm confident something will bother you throughout the time you're there. As in: I love the industrial greenhouse deco (another reviewer called it a ""treehouse"", which I think is an accurate description of the outdoor-sy feeling of the place). And the L-shaped bar and open kitchen I think is a smart way to delineate the space. But the doorway's a mix of heated humidity and chlorine that conjures the appetizing memories of an indoor public pool changing room. Luckily that didn't extend into the restaurant. As in: The slightly expensive pizza is so worth it. Especially for its fluffy and airy thin crust. And I'm saying this having tired only 1 lukewarm slice of my friend's mushroom pizza she couldn't finish (I THOUGHT SHE WOULD NEVER ASK). But, my Pimm's cup seemed so lazily put together and deprived of care I'd rather invite you over to my place so I could make you one instead. Note: Tiny diced up pieces of cucumbers and mushy red apples will happily sink to the bottom of a glass and serve no purpose ever. As in: I could make out through the noisy atmosphere (place was packed what you do you expect) that Kelela and The Internet were blasting on the speakers. But when I excitedly waved  our waitress over so to find out who to thank for the excellent musical selection, she informed me it was just some Songza playlist someone put on... Ok fine, that last one only bothers my crushed heart. I still recommend it. It was packed on a Tuesday night in January, and there was a pizza on almost any table I could peek at from my seat. People like it. But man is there no excuse to serve a sad Pimm's ever."

It was really hard to find the place because it has the same interior and outlook as the fancy restaurant next door (same owner) and you can't tell if it's one restaurant or two. The interior and ambience is enchanting, especially during summer when the terrace is open and the vine leaves are about. Their latté game is en pointe, one of the better ranking lattés I've had in Montreal and I've had quite a lot of lattés actually. The servers are also friendly, they accidentally prepared two lattés and we ordered only one so offered us the other one for free. I would advice staying away from the flatbread pizzas if you want to eat here on a budget. I had the salmon flatbread and it tasted good but I wish I could've shared it with someone (my friend already ordered salad). If you're going with your boyfriend, order a flatbread and share.

They handled our large group of 9 (which included people arriving late) without making mistakes. And didn't hesitate to prepare separate checks for each person.- High-quality ingredients, especially fresh veggies- Nice (if loud) live piano musicThe bad parts:- The table we were seated at seemed designed to hurt people's knees, at least at our level of crowdedness- They were out of lobster, but did not offer to reduce the price of the seafood pizza- The (English) menu is not written optimally for customers who don't speak French, especially for people who speak English as a second language. The pizzas don't have names, just lists of ingredients. Some things are still in French, e.g. the menu says ""cidre"" (pronounced ""SEE-drh"") and the waitress did not understand what was meant by ""cider"" (pronounced ""SAI-dur""), and the beer sizes are listed as ""V"" and ""P"" rather than writing out ""glass"" and ""pint"" in English. Of course some amount of communication struggle is expected when French is the commonly-spoken language and customers don't speak French, but this menu design was not helping.- My pizza (bacon and Brussels sprouts) did not have a substantial enough crust to support the greasy ingredients on top of it, and the bottom was somewhat burnt. I was not able to pick up the slices of pizza until I had cut off the inner half of each with a knife and fork (otherwise the middle would just flop down and the toppings would slide off). It seemed like a failed attempt at a New York style thin crust pizza, but the crust was brittle rather than flexible and chewy. The toppings themselves were tasty, but I shouldn't have to eat a pizza with a knife and fork unless it's deep dish. Especially not if I'm paying $17 for a personal pizza."

It was topped with black beans, avocado, cheese of course, a fried egg, and delicious chorizo and you have to understand that I don't normally like to eat black beans, avocado, and chorizo.. yet it was delicious!

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Working in the suburbs and the general nature of my actual profession limits my opportunities for a nice weekday lunch downtown. So many great options to enjoy if you have the chance. Last month, I had a random Friday off to enjoy downtown. Perfect chance to go out to lunch with my mother who works in town and have a nice lunch. Given the location of her work, I figured that Cafe Parvis would be worthwhile to try.Located on Mayor street, just a quick walk over from Place des Spectacles, Cafe Parvis is from the same people who run Bar Furco just next door. Similar to its sister, Cafe Parvis certainly has a look to it. An interesting mixture of exposed concrete, brick and wood creates a very lived-in feel. The use of vines and plants all over the interior plus the huge windows create a warmth and relaxed atmosphere. Too bad it was a little too cool to enjoy the terrasse in the front.Foodwise, Cafe Parvis is all about pizza and salads. My mother went for one of the salad. Beets, pears, arugula, noix de grenoble, goat cheese and a tarragon dressing. A very hearty portion - tons of ingredients and very flavourful. Nice mixture with the beets, the sweet pears, the rich goat cheese and that awesome tarragon dressing. My mother had just the salad and was quite full.The pizzas are served by the slice. Similar approach as the salad - tons of ingredients and high on flavour. The key thing though is that crust. If that doesn't hold up, it doesn't matter. Thankfully, the crust here was on point. Closer to the ""Al Taglio"" style, the crust was thick with a nice crunch but still chewy. First up, I had the lamb, feta and tzatziki pizza. Great flavour to the lamb and with a big dollop of tzatziki right on top. Excellent.Next was ricotta with spinach and roasted peppers. Great mixture of creamy rich ricotta and sweet peppers. Served almost as a sandwich means you get double the crunch compared to the other slices.The final pizza I tried was the duck confit with potatoes, cheddar, garlic oil and rosemary. Very flavourful once again. Loved the fatty duck and how it mixed with the potato and the cheese. However, with the amount of potato on the pizza, it made the pizza much dryer since there is no sauce to speak of. I would have needed more cheese to offset.Thankfully we got there just before noon because there was a lineup by the time we left. I understand why - excellent pizza, flavourful salads and a beautiful space to sit in as people seek a break from their workdays. Cafe Parvis certainly lived up to my hopes and made a beautiful Friday off that much more enjoyable. Anyone working nearby should certainly give it a look.Cheers!"

There is actual care and love put into the choice of toppings.The real super star here was the salads?!?! I know! Don't believe me if you don't want to, I know it's hard to describe a ""good salad"" but it is jammed stupid with nuts, berries, fresh dressing, vegetables and its super fun that they come in different sizes. It's difficult as a blue collar grown man to say to my friends ""go there for the great salad"" but I guess that is what yelp is for. Just tell everyone you are going there for the pizza! When you arrive you can ""change your mind"" and order the crazy good salads."
/user_details?userid=6QQWcsMubP0_D9uZ3e6NsA,Bernardo P.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Had brunch there last weekend and I was reeeeeeally disappointed. We were a party of 6, celebrating my girlfriend's birthday and one of our friends brought cake... A tiny cake from Première Moisson. After all of us had eaten, we decided to serve the cake and, as soon as we opened the box, one of the waiters came by and said he would have to charge a ""cake fee"". Well, that sucks, but whatever... What is it, like 10 bucks or something? And then the guy said they'd charge us 45 (FORTY-F*ING-FIVE) dollars to eat the cake there. AKA twice as much as the cake had cost in the first place.Personally, I am totally against charging this type of bullshit fee as, in my opinion, pleasing the customer is the primary mission of any business. Anyway... I understand the restaurant's point of view, that they will have to wash a few extra dishes and bla-bla-bla, so charging a symbolic fee still seems acceptable. 45 bucks is just not acceptable. After the very embarrassing situation, we decided not to pay the fee and went back to Première Moisson to eat our cake.And what really pissed us off is that they could have said that they had this policy from the beginning, so we could decide whether we'd have brunch there or somewhere else, but they didn't.They didn't get our 45 bucks and lost 6 customers just like that."

/user_details?userid=3gGo8mT2yozLprrIv9stEg,Talia F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Food first - cos let's be honest that's why you're here. They serve salads and pizzas and they're delicious. The salads are hearty and filling. They're actually full of goodness. For two of us we shared: mushroom pizza with Jerusalem artichoke purée, Brie & honey, and the beet salad with spinach & ricotta and a cumin vinaigrette. ONE HUGE PET PEEVE which I wish in hindsight i had mentioned while I was there - the salad came with walnuts and this was not stipulated on the menu. While I can't eat walnuts I'd rather be inconvenienced and pick them out than ask them to throw away a perfectly good salad. Not into food waste like that and I had a work around. But still, it's annoying - I feel like a walnut (especially the generous amount and all crushed up that was there) should not have been a menu oversight. Please Parvis put that on your menu or stipulate there are nuts in your dishes! No one likes a walnut surprise. Well not no-one - but not me. Anyway - everything else was great - and the service was done with a smile. Great cocktail menu too! Cocktails are $10-11. Ok second - the actual setting is stunning. Spacy, airy, high ceilings, full of plants. Hidden away behind st Catherine so if you're looking for a bite off the beaten path away from the mess of downtown - then this is a great spot. Serious plant envy too. A great date spot. Lovely when the weather is nice when their windows are open or when their terrace is set up. 1 salad, 1 pizza, 1 cocktail + service + tip was around $50. The food was good (not mind blowing out of this world like nothing I've ever had before - but very very very tasty and I would go back), the service was faultless and the interior is waaaaay beautiful. If that's in your budget - go here!Could have got a 5th star but - walnut."

We walked 20 minutes to get to Cafe Parvis for lunch and it was totally worth it. This little cafe is hidden away near St.Catherine Street and would not be an easy place to find if you weren't familiar with the area. The atmosphere is very relaxing with well maintained greenery hanging off the ceiling and walls which I really enjoyed. Felt like I was dining in a forest almost. Service was great and the food was spectacular! We ordered some salad which were all super refreshing. I ordered the smoked salmon pizza topped with green peas, arugula, fennel, smoked salmon and flying fish roes. It was SUPER fresh and portion was quite big (for me) as I couldn't finish the entire pizza by myself. I loved how all the veggies/ herbs were fresh and unseasoned so the only apparent flavour to the pizza was the smoked salmon so it was just the right level of saltiness. To finish off the meal, I had a latte which was very aromatic and deliciously creamy. I would definitely return to this place if I had the chance to visit Montreal again!"

I found their website before we came to visit Montreal from Ohio, and the look and vibe matched our tastes exactly.We walked in and the decor lived up to it's expectations. It was urban and rustic at the same time. Loved it.The food was good - the salads are super unique and portion sizes were good without being too big. Everything was good.The biggest issue I had with the whole experience was the service:We walked in and they sat us at a bar. My boyfriend ordered the black bean burger and I ordered a salad and a small latte. The food came, but I did not receive my latte. I told the gentleman (who was not our original server) that I had ordered a latte and he said that he thought that it was being made then. About 10 minutes went by and the latte did not come. At this point our server had not came back to even check on us, so I didn't know how to tell them about it.I said something to the gentleman who ran our food as he was passing by and he said he would look into it. Our server came back and said that he didn't understand that I wanted a latte and that he would get it in soon. About 5 more minutes went by and we were finished with our food. Our server had not returned and so I grabbed the gentleman that ran our food, once again, and told him not to worry about the latte, we were finished. He turned around an said, 'Oh but it's ready now.'At that point we were in a awkward position of staying and drinking a latte after we had finished our meal, even after we said that we no longer wanted it. When they gave us the bill, they had removed the latte from the bill (good), but never once addressed the issue or apologized - which was a knock on the experience for me."

Overall, service was great. The girls were helpful and cute. Turns out one of my friends works there too! That was a nice surprise.Food was eccentric, healthy and delicious. Well priced too. If you're looking for a ""bargain"" this isn't exactly the place. If you want to eat a healthy delicious experience... this is where to go.A bientot."

/user_details?userid=TazRorf9TGqAsdTglyhDZQ,Emily Z.,"San Diego, CA",3 star rating,This place has a very aesthetic decor with hanging plants and nice natural lighting. Lunch was not a decently sized portion and service could have been friendlier. Good place if you are not that hungry and looking for a cute atmosphere!

The pizza and beet salad we had were delicious. service was just ok. The place is really beautiful though and I think I would prefer sitting at a table for breakfast.

/user_details?userid=S8db747o3BMeb3E2Kp_5fg,Melissa G.,"Pincourt, Canada",5 star rating,"So you may have trouble finding this place given there's construction going on in the area but it's definitely worth the couple of minutes walking in circles! The scaffolding in front of Cafe Parvis doesn't interfere with the restaurant much though they close their terrace during the day during construction (at night it's open!). Great place. Had a tasty piece of cheddar, cauliflower and bacon pizza for like 7 dollars. Great meal, good price and even better coffee. Bonus points for the pretty space and the cool looking waiters that somehow manage to all look like models yet still be super nice."

But wait! There's more. Pizza kind of more. The best possible kind of edible more one could hope for. As a half-Italian myself, I'd say it's not Italian-style pizza. More North American. Anyway, the food is great. Coffee is good. Wait staff, a big bagged. Not a spot I'd go out of the way to go to but a god sent for the area. Same owners as Furco. The more you know!"

/user_details?userid=HzuMaeMd7BpFXlU96YDnfw,Vanessa Y.,"Mont-Royal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here on a Saturday afternoon with a friend. It was a little busy, but were served right away. They did sit us at the other side of a table that two girls were already eating at...a little close for comfort lol, but it wasn't an issue. Service was wonderful - I ordered a mocha (delicious!!) and my friend had a cappuccino. As well, my friend had the prosciutto pizza and I got the margherita blanche. They arrived on cute wooden boards, as well as an infused oil of some sort that I found myself dipping my crust into. The pizza was flavorful and delicious (it also made for yummy leftovers the next morning haha!). The decor was magical, almost like walking into a treehouse turned cafe, with its wooden structure and foliage hanging from the ceiling. There was also an outdoor terrace. It definitely did not seem like we were in the hustle-and-bustle of downtown. Quiet & quaint, with delicious food!"
/user_details?userid=0Os3nf8mAlk1rKrQjLDGvw,Natalie P.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"LOVE this place! What a hidden little gem we found. The outside of the restaurant is very European looking which immediately caught our eye and the inside is so darling-fresh plants hanging from the ceiling. The food is perfect and unpretentious! I love small menus that specialize in a few good items. The cauliflower salad is perfect as a small, another larger is way too filing and the pizza is the lightest, airiest I've ever had. Their lattes are delicious - very comparable to the quality of Europe. A must visit!"

I don't usually drink / enjoy coffee, but I ordered the cappuccino and honestly loved it. Had the banana bread with caramel butter and strawberries - also delicious. Got there only 20 minutes after opening on a Saturday morning and it was already pretty busy, and got much busier around noon. Definitely would recommend getting there early to beat the rush. Am also definitely coming back in order to try one of their cocktails since that menu looked phenomenal (and likely also for other regular cafe desires). Was a little more difficult to find, mostly since I'm new to the city and there was construction going on in the street and around the area."
/user_details?userid=e9m-rEBMioO3SXG1N11qGA,Erica T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Went for a late lunch with a coworker, long after the usual lunch rush is over. There were a few other people around, but no hostess to seat us, so we weren't sure if we could just choose our own seats or not. We decided to sit down at a table in the terrasse since there were other people there ordering. The terrasse is beautiful, by the way. Just sunny enough and very nicely decorated. The place has character. Service was slow. It took a while for the waitress to notice us and bring us water and menus, even though she knew we were there.That said, the entire menu looks fresh, tasty, and healthy, and the prosciutto pizza was incredible. The crust wasn't really anything like a real Italian pizza, but delicious nonetheless. If you have the time to spare, it's definitely worth a try,"
/user_details?userid=Fi43PCiX_BTnJOEXtvjcDg,Eric P.,"West Orange, NJ",5 star rating,This is perhaps the best pizza I've ever had. Perfect crust. Chewy but dry enough.

I went twice in hopes that the experience would be different the second time around but both times I was seriously disappointed. The one redeeming quality is the venue! The decor is really nice and the terrace in summer is beautiful but honestly not worth it!

/user_details?userid=dfIOLWBUkZvULJUqDeJ-Nw,Brian L.,"Dartmouth, Canada",4 star rating,"Brilliant choice of a half dozen delicious breakfasts -- highly recommend trying the breakfast pizza, which is excellent for brunch. Incredible cappuccino and very good latte would be worth stopping by, all on their own. Really great, if somewhat overworked serving staff, and while service isn't quick, wait time is certainly reasonable. Marvelous decor is a fusion of the original factory building with modern café touches. Lots of space but popular. Currently a lot of local construction, especially out on the street, but we didn't have any trouble finding the door (do know where you're headed)."
/user_details?userid=QE60HUeJA5hBCiK871c5sQ,Leanne O.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Went for lunch with a big group of co-workers yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Healthy, delicious, and non-traditional in the combinations of toppings and ingredients for their pizzas and salad and served with grace and a friendly smile in a luscious green space. I was in heaven. The bread pudding with butterscotch sauce was a delight at the end of the meal, especially between sips from a very well-made latte. Best to share the dessert though, it was rich (but not too sweet) and the portion was ample!  Oh, and did I mention that the prices were extremely reasonable? I am so happy to discover Café Parvis and that it is so close to my work!  I loved the massive wall of tomato plants growing and flowering already on the terrasse. Beautiful spot."

It is located on a little alleyway that you wouldn't expect to have such a cozy restaurant. About half way down the alley, we noticed the large windows filled with warm light and lots of beautiful plants. There was also a nice outdoor eating area as well. We sat at the bar as the prepared some foods. It was pretty busy for a Monday night and could serve a number of different purposes. There were people there by themselves on laptops and there were large tables in one area that would be good for bigger groups. We order some beers and also split a pizza with ricotta, mushrooms and cured meat. They provided an english menu for us to order from. The waitstaff was very friendly. The pizza wasn't huge, but we weren't very hungry and splitting it was the perfect amount of food. I would definitely go back for dinner and would also like to check it out for breakfast."
