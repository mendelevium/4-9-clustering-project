Across from the park, under a home, with a stunning dark interior - almost like you're in the aquarium section at a museum.The food is *next level* - same with the service. My suggestion is to either sit on the patio, weather permitting, or sit at the bar."
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've seen this restaurant every time I passed by the park and was always wondering if it was good. Well, now I have tried it and can confirm, it's excellent! The service is top notch, the food is amazing, it's truly is a special experience. Their menu is limited because they go after quality and to wow their clientele, every dish is perfect. And yes, the decor and name is related to the tennis court in front. I highly recommend to try to get a table at the terrace during summer, perfect for a romantic date or dinner with your loved ones. Yes, yes  and yes!"
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"For quite a while now, my wife and I have bookmarked Le Filet as one of our go to places for celebrations. The restaurant specializes in small to medium-sized dishes best enjoyed by sharing plates. What sets this restaurant apart is their unique take on Japanese/French/Italian fusion. The lighting is dark and the vibe is cool. As my sister-in-law and her husband note, the waiters will pair your dishes into logical courses at a relaxed pace. On balance, this is the quintessential date restaurant.Most people think Le Filet refers to a filet mignon or a filet of fish. I have it on good authority that it refers to a tennis net, much like those found in the park across the street on Mount Royal. As such, they organize their menu in terms of 3 categories of amuse bouche/appetizers/mains which are titled Game, Set, and Match.You will chat with your waiter and construct your own little tasting menu based upon the evening's offerings. The obvious drawback however is that in ordering the recommended 5- 6 dishes for every 2 people, the price of your dinner multiplies quickly. Can you order less? I suppose so, but some of the portions of are quite small. Not ridiculous Chez Sophie small, but the price to value ratio of some dishes is off the mark. This is the only reason I have to take a single star off my rating, which I really hate to do given the high quality of the product here. I STRONGLY recommend the miso gratin oysters. The order of 6 oysters normally comes with 3 maple jalapeño oysters, and 3 of the miso ones. The pro tip of the day is to tell your waiter you just want 6 of the miso gratin oysters and forget about the other type which is pedestrian at best. Think of this dish as a Japanese take on the Oyster Rockefeller. It is a surreal combination of salty and sweet. With a crispy broiled exterior and a fresh oyster in a beautiful broth inside, this will knock your socks right off. At 21$ for 6 of these, the value here is spot on.We also tried the smoked mackerel rillette which was essentially a delicious smoked fish spread served with large sesame crackers and a bit of egg yolk/lemon oil. Like the oysters, the chef likes to incorporate sweetness into the salty fish flavour. The delicious result is like some sort of magic trick. Paired with a dry sparkling wine, I cannot think of many better ways to start a meal.There are 2 types of raw tuna appetizers that you must not forego when visiting Le Filet. Get them both. Don't be moderate and measured and decide to get one. You can do it. I have faith in you. They are the tuna tartare and the hamachi. Both of these dishes could be transported to Kazu and instantly become best sellers. They are that good. Look at the pics attached. The tartare of red tuna is mixed with black sesame and is buttery and delicious. It is served with 2 large strips of nori paper that has undergone the fried tempura treatment as well as some delicious egg yolk. The hamachi is essentially several pieces of yellowtail sashimi prepared ceviche-style and then topped with a volcano-like mountain of shredded crispy vegetables. It's easily one of the prettiest dishes I've seen anywhere. Both these takes on tuna are vibrant and creative. It's like edible art.For mains, we sampled the sea urchin spaghetti, scallops special, and the braised beef short rib. All three dishes were delicious, but it's at this point in the meal where you will notice the portion sizes decreasing while the prices are essentially doubling. The scallop special features 3 large scallops with....with nothing. It's just 3 large scallops for 39$. Sorry guys. Just because I'm having a good time and enjoying myself, doesn't mean I forgot the value of money. Why not combine the sea urchin spaghetti with the scallops in a single dish. Charge 48$ all together and you'll be somewhere in the ballpark of reasonable. I have the same problem with the beef shortrib. The dish was absolutely sublime and melt in your mouth tender....all 3-4 ounces of short rib. At 42$, you need to double the portion of the protein. If they want to argue that it runs contrary to the concept of a small portion tasting menu they can lower the price. It's a tapas-like portion and it's short-rib which is a cheap cut.The menu includes the curious addition of onion rings as a side. Although I dig the desire to throw in a fun ""junk foody"" element into an otherwise elevated dinner, I feel these rings fall a bit short. All I can taste are loose bread crumbs falling off of these things. If I'm going to eat an onion ring, I want an old school cause-croute version that has been battered and deep-fried. It should have a hollow sound when you tap on it with your fingernail. Desserts are stellar, but I've run out of room in this review! Ultimately, if you order wisely, Le Filet is one of the great restaurant experiences in Montreal."

If I could fit more food in my already fat tummy, I would. The food here was extremely delicious, and the staff really takes care of you. Every plate ordered was on point and total perfection. Let me tell you about the oysters. I loved it so much we ordered seconds. It ain't cheap but I'd work 100 overtime hours to eat more oysters here, it's worth it. And then, there's the wagyu that melts in my mouth. This restaurant is really worth the price and I totally recommend it for a special event."

We had several ""oh my God"" moments which after tasting the oysters evolved into an 'eyes rolling back' moment. Our server (Alex | girl) was amazing. She recommended several items, which we tried all of them. She was so nice, so attentive and has an infectious personality that is hard not to smile when she's around. The vibe is very upscale, but casual. We sat on the patio and it was quiet and comfortable. Highly recommended."
/user_details?userid=fO4Sw0BROzdlKa41fu2uCw,Chris B.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,We had gone for my sister's birthday and the menu had a fresh selection of seafood and well composed entrees. The server was a delight and was able to provide great advice on what were some local favourites. One thing that we appreciated is that the staff was fluently bilingual and took the time to ensure that we understood what was being brought to our table at each service. Overall our favourite treats were the wagyu beef tataki accompanied by the salmon with Israeli couscous and fried zucchini flowers. I would definitely go back.
/user_details?userid=WQepKNQQDOQo1CWpkTUvug,Philip N.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Phenomenal. From the presentation to the quality of ingredients and service. Three of each of the 'special' oysters to begin, tuna tartar to follow, and the canard to top it off accompanied by Pessac-Leognan. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.

/user_details?userid=aV6m_LEsPoZLXFKI770oEA,Mike S.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,"I have to be honest.. I didn't have high expectations for Le Filet. I mean, its not the trendy newcomer to the dining scene - it's been around a while. I didn't hear any buzz about some trendy must try dish or have a ridiculous wait for an impossible to get reservation or crazy tight seating. No no.. none of the usual indignities diners sometimes have to endure to have an excellent meal. It turned out to be one of the best meals I had in Montreal.A beautiful summer evening and we were able to sit outside on the terrace (patio) located on a quiet block across the street from Parc Jeanne-Mance. We ordered a nice bottle of Vaucheron Sancerre Rose as we enjoyed incredible, friendly service the rest of the meal.The oysters are deliciously fresh - we had them three ways: plain, miso gratin and jalapeno & maple being the ones I enjoyed most. The grilled octopus was very tender and I like the meyer lemon coulis that was with this. The seared cod was a perfectly prepared piece of fish. We finished of the meal with Cavatelli, foie gras, veal cheek that was a mind blowing dish. We finished the meal with a shared chocolate mousse. We shared all the dishes with new plates and silverware came out with each dish course. Water glasses filled as needed. Our waiter was very friendly and the meal pace was just right. I wish all my dining experience was as good as Le Filet - I said to myself: This what it feels to be ""adulting""!"

We wanted to taste a few different things so we asked the server to surprise us with some dishes of her choice. Every dish was excellent. It was a true feast. This was a pricey evening, but well worth it. The chef is very creative, and Le Filet is for those who appreciate the whole dining experience."

/user_details?userid=IsHYBsEpl6yoOHrt4G_0wQ,Arshile K.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Outstanding experience! Prices match the quality. The decor is warm-modern, with dim lighting and dark walls. Staff is exceptionally friendly, highly knowledgeable about the dishes and wine list, and attentive without being intrusive. You'll want to make reservations here. We came on a Friday, and called a few hours in advance -  by some miracle, a spot was open at 9:30. When we got there, our table wasn't quite ready. We were offered a delicious aperitif to start the night at the bar. In less than five minutes, our table was available. I can't say enough about the quality of the ingredients here. We had the smoked mackerel rillettes, the scallop ceviche, the tataki of wagyu, the hamachi, the black linguini, and two specials: loup de mer, and another fish special I can't remember the name of. First thing to say about the food - it's visually stunning. The dishes are so beautifully presented you can't help but take a few moments to take them in. The colours of the ceviche were like water colours, with the presentation highlighting the various textures of the food (beet, orange, coriander mousse). Each dish could only be assembled by someone who really understood the ingredients they were using. The flavours came together perfectly. Generally, I prefer my fish with as little as possible. A bit of salt and olive oil is usually enough for me. This is a departure from the type of preparation I usually enjoy, but certainly a welcome one. The flavours bounce off of each in complex ways which at once highlight the freshness of each ingredient while tying the dish together perfectly. Everything was incredible, but the standouts for me were the loup de mer and the hamachi. Will definitely be back."
/user_details?userid=8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,Brandon C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Le Filet is an expensive (yet not crazy expensive) restaurant where the sharing plates only leave you wanting more.That said, everything here is delicious. While they do feature seafood (and the tuna tartare is one of the delicious seafood options), they also offer beef, lamb, fois gras, and other non-seafood options. Two people can make a nice meal by sharing 5-6 plates.Le Filet offers fairly standard cocktails. While the cocktails are good, the quirky by-the-glass wine list is more interesting. They feature a French Syrah that is a nice value and an appropriate compliment to a meal.The maple cake dessert is a showstopper.Service is excellent and compliments the casual elegance of the restaurant.

Le Filet is a new culinary experience worthy of a Michelin star, and if you happen to be in Montreal you owe it to yourself to try it. As an appetizer, I had the cold corn soup with fois gras, the freshness of the soup and the quality of the fois gras was the best I've come across. I had the duck filet and the halibut fish special, both of which were to die for. Don't miss their desserts, which are fresh, tasty and exceptional. Be sure to make your reservation about a month in advance; there's no dress code and the dining room is quite noisy, but I can't recommend Le Filet enough!"

Every dish we ordered was perfect and delicious - I just wish there had been more! The prices are pretty expensive though, so definitely not a restaurant you go to very often. We shared a few dishes: butternut squash ravioli with pan-seared scallops and a parmesan mousse, langoustine risotto with shiitake mushrooms and mascarpone, squid ink linguine with shrimps calamari and clams, the Cinderella dessert: a chocolate mousse with a vanilla cream - everything was so good.For my full review and more photos, check out my blog: Turquoise Blog (link in bio!)"

The menu is rather short, but quite varied, featuring a mix of Italian, French and Japanese influences. Plates are beautifully dressed. We shared the tuna tartare as a entree; it came with fried nori sheets instead of the regular crackers (original!) and was paired with confit egg yolk. Absolutely delicious! We followed with seafood squid ink linguini and squash risotto with shiitake mushrooms, and while both were  good, they didn't leave an out-of-the-ordinary impression. Dessert was a yuzu tart with meringue and grapefruit, and an interesting apple and cranberry tart: their strong asset was definitely the artful presentation. All in all, great place for a date or a more formal dinner with plates that are devoured with the eyes first and foremost."

Overall, we had a nice meal, but nothing out of the world. The service was ok I guess but didn't feel personalized. When you ask the waiter ""what do you recommend between this and that?"", you are expecting to received some kind of description of the dishes which are supposed to make you drool, but instead we got ""both are good"" or ""both are very different"". For the calibre of the restaurant, lets expect a little bit more :) We started off with the ""sashimi de cardeau"", the tuna tartare and the beef wagyu. Both dishes were very tasty! We went on with the halibut and the risotto, and finished off with the chocolate mousse. Overall, everything was tasty but too seasoned/salty to my taste. My favourite was the sashimi and the Dessert. We got one glass of wine each, and our bill was 160$ before taxes."

But, everything was good. I swear. Attractive presentations. Great service. Ask for a bottle of their 'house' champagne (they import it directly just for the restaurant) - it's a killer value."

Le Filet is in an unassuming neighborhood - you would never suspect such a fine dining experience in the middle of what seems like a residential neighborhood. The second we walked in there we were treated like royalty - customer service is sublime here. Maybe because we brought our bachelorette decked out in bachelorette gear, but they were attentive and right on when it comes to making sure we got everything we needed, from bartender and water to plates and timing. Everything here is made to share, and they bring dishes out in waves, replacing your plates and utensils with each wave. It's really fantastic.In addition to a couple bottles of wine and a couple rounds of shots for the 7 of us, all of which were phenomenal, we ordered.

We sat at the bar so were served by the bartender which worked out just fine for us.Le Filet has sort of tapas style dishes, where you order 4-5 small dishes for 2 people. I like that because I love getting to taste as much as possible. We started with the miso-gratine oysters- they were honestly a bit of heaven in your mouth- the best thing I have tasted in a long while. The jalepeno-bacon ones were also good but incomparable to the other ones. The beet & scallop salad was amazingly refreshing as a winter salad and fit so perfectly with the weather- it worked beautifully. The other dishes were all very good too- we also ordered the daily special- half lobster cooked in hollandaise sauce- it was good, but quite small for 27$. The pasta & clams was where I remove a half star. It was not great. The noodles were chewy, topped with chewy clams too, and the sauce way too salty/briny.I will definitely go again and taste the dishes I didn't get a chance to this time!"

A lot of expectations for Le Filet as we have dined at the other two and were blown away. However, maybe it's my asian background, but Le Filet, which serves mostly asian inspired dishes, just didn't live up to the hype for us. The ambiance is the trendiest and most welcoming of the three, with an outdoor terrace overlooking Parc Jeanne-Mance. The service, while quite good, didn't feel personal. Very short drink menu but every elaborate french heavy wine list. We asked our waiter for a recommendation and granted wine taste is personal, we were disappointed by the one she had picked for us. We started with the oysters, the miso gratin ones and the ones topped with jalapeños.The miso gratin's were delicious, our favorite item of the night. We continued on with the Waygu beef, the crispy halibut, the linguini with clams and the piglet duo.  Everything was just alright, good, but lacking in that wow factor. The beef was not was tender as expected, the halibut had a nice crispy outer layer but lacked seasoning, the linguini was sold as with squid ink but only served with dried pieces of it and not completely black as we had hoped for and finally the pig although good was simply crispy skin pig you could find at any good Chinese restaurant for a fraction of the price.We total bill was well over 250$ with tax and tip and we left feeling unsatisfied with out experience."

My husband had the halibut which had great flavour but was over cooked. Our waiter was incredibly inviting, friendly and attentive.

I myself ordered a gluten/dairy free cod (from their gluten/lactose free menu) and 3  halfshell oysters with yuzu.After the first orders had come out, we realized that we had ordered too many plates. Coming from New York City, these portions were normal to us, and 8 of them were just too many. But, we were hungry, and chowed down on extremely delicious food, as well as eating all the plates but one. A single plate of foie gras pasta (which was in fact quite rich as you could imagine).For my own food, I could not believe that this restaurant had not only a lactose-free menu, but a gluten AND lactose-free menu. For those extremely unlucky people who have a hard time finding food to eat in a french cuisine restaurant, come here, they will have a wide selection for you. My oysters + yuzu were amazing, and I wish I could've ordered another serving. Although I had to wait for my cod until the rest of my family was on their 3rd (of 4) plates, it was worth it. Simple crispy cod over simple sautéed carrots and spinach is such a delicious idea.Overall, this place is a pleasant find for the Montreal area. The service is a little laid back, so expect to wait a few minutes to get your check, but the waiters were very heartfelt and warming. If we ever visit Quebec again, we will definitely find our way back to Le Filet. I highly recommend this restaurant."

/user_details?userid=jQxqHmkuB-z_9rFgtCzGVA,Diana C.,"ASTORIA, NY",5 star rating,"This place was recommended by my roommate's brother, who recently visited this place with his fiancee. Naturally, we Yelped the place upon hearing it and checked out their menu on their website. The reviews were good, and the menu sounded delicious, hence we went ahead to call for reservations, considering it was a Saturday night (Open Table website wasn't accurate). Upon arriving, we were greeted pleasantly by the hostess and were shown to our table instantly. The restaurant looks very trendy with the open kitchen on the side. Our server proved to be knowledgeable on the menu as we did not know some of the ingredients. She proceeded to recommend some of her favorites and we went ahead with those recommendations. (All dishes are small plates and are recommended to be shared)Our meal for the night consist of: Oysters - both jalapeno and misoHamachi Crab RisottoGrilled Octopus Lobster spaghetti We started with oysters, both jalapeno and miso. Both very different flavors and both equally tasty. We were so impressed that we ordered another round of oysters. Either that, or we were both really hungry. The Hamachi was also delicious, equal balance between the fresh fish and the sesame seasoning. Again, we finished the plate wanting more, but we held ourselves back. The Lobster spaghetti was shared between us. Fresh lobster and light sauce on the spaghetti that doesn't over-power the dish itself. I had the grilled octopus for myself since my dining partner is less enthusiastic about the octopus than I am. The octopus was slightly over-cooked to my taste, slightly chewy, but unnoticeable. It was served on a tiny bed of Israeli couscous, personally I would prefer to have more couscous on the plate as it was very yummyThe crab risotto was all for my dining partner. I had a taste of it and it was very, very tasty. It can get a little bit heavy (since it's risotto). The crab is minced and mixed in the risotto, you can barely see it, but can definitely taste it. Service were impeccable. They probably changed our plates more times than necessary. Paying attention to tiny details such as making sure the restaurant logo sits 12 o'clock, directly on the top. Cleared our plates promptly. We also ordered bread on the side (no charge), which they accommodated us graciously. We did not order any drinks, so can't review the quality of their wines."

For example, they served four oysters and dressed two up in jalapeño and crispy onion, and the other two were 'au gratin.' The fresh oyster effect was lost. It is also very expensive, and the mood was a bit pretentious. Seems like a place you might take someone to show off. Like a caricature of an upscale, modern restaurant that you'd see in a movie (for example, American Psycho). Overall, I wasn't too impressed."

/user_details?userid=UvZKaPFy85iPjoB2Aj40kQ,Oleg R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been to every good place in Montreal. Multiple times. Le Filet is my favorite. Hands down. Warning: if you enter that place you are guaranteed to become addicted and spend a lot of money there. I did. I just finished my yearly expenses and I spent good 4-figures there this year. And now about the restaurant:Location - very nice area on Mont Royal street. In between 2 beaten passes - St Laurent and Parc. In the middle of everything, while not super crowded. Lots of green grass around during summer (nice sports fields across the street). Tons of street parking around (major plus). Ambiance - Very good one. However, it can get extremely loud there to the point that you can lose your voice, since everybody is trying to be louder than everybody else. Their terrace is very good so try to get a table there if you are hitting Le Filet in summer. Management - very well done. A good looking girl will greet you at the door, offer some wine, and take your jacket. Actually, hold on, one of the owners most likely will, before the girl manages to. Even though it is a borderline posh place, owners are super down to earth and will take care of you well. Last time I accidentally spilled someone else' wine onto that same someone else. Guess what, the owner was right there to fix the situation. No animals were injured in the process. Menu - interesting stuff to read. Le Filet is following the latest trend of small plates. $15-$20 a plate. You will need 5-6 plates for a good dinner for 2. The menu is organized into 5-6 groups by type of seafood/non-seafood they have. I advice to:a. trust their waiters' suggestions (did that first 2 times, did not get disappointed)b. pick 1 plate from each group. If you manage to screw this one up... you are a very special one. Food - it is AWESOME. I would kill for their 1/2 lobsters. And I would kill the person who decided to remove their sweet buttersqaush ravioli from the menu. I almost got a heart attack when I found out. Their fried oysters are mindblowing. Kurobata pork is good. Basically everything there is worth trying (hence, the danger to get addicted). Wine - their cellar is VERY, VERY decent. One of the first times I came I tried this italian wine, filtered through volcanic ashes. Wasn't able to find anything similar in Montreal. Trust their owner or waiters. I haven't been disappointed. Verdict - my favorite place, and I'm very hard to please. Great location, ambiance, attitude, and most important - food. A perfect recipe for an awesome foodie night out."

Then we had an amazing tuna tartare. We then shared the grilled octopus and the black linguini with seafood. All perfect. And it that hadn't been enough the waiter who was also great recommended the maple syrup square with pecans which came with shots to celebrate our anniversary (their idea).

Each dish was carefully crafted and designed and is meant to be savored. Waitress was very friendly and helpful with choosing plates. Enjoyed raw scallops for the first time, paired with beets, asparagus, avacado and orange, so good. I had made a reservation 2 weeks ahead of time for 2 people yet we were set at the bar seating right by the hostess stand... that's why I'm gong Le Filet a 4 star. We should have had a table. Also it is pretty expensive but worth the money."

I just noticed I forgot to leave a review then so I'm writing it now because holy crap this place is great. The restaurants vibe was quite nice, on the darker side and cozy, very intimate. Our server Greg was by far one of the friendliest servers I've ever had, clicked with our group and was fun to talk to. On top of that he was quite knowledgeable and suggested this super unique Bordeaux called Château Côtes de Cassagne which was surprisingly light, very enjoyable and suited the food well. And the food, just wow, the dishes were quite unique and every one had a distinguished flavor and theme. You could tell a lot of creativity was put into each dish and we couldn't keep our hands off. The menu is made so that you try a bunch of different things and have a number of different experiences with each. With that in mind I would say the place is ideal for groups of 4 or so. I can't remember everything we had but my absolute favorite was the Smoked Mackerel Rilettes which was just perfect and is a must try in my opinion. All in all amazing food that is well worth the price. Will definitely be going back in the near future."

I went with 3 friends, we ordered 2 of each dish to share, and the rest was history. Our waiter gave us fabulous recommendations, whether regarding quantity or which dish to choose when we couldn't decide.From what I remember, we had and enjoyed:- oysters (hon shimeji, truffle oil, oyster cream)- fluke, Japanese plum, wasabi, cucumber- half lobster, hollandaise, urchin- grilled octopus, Israeli couscous, Meyer lemon coulis- a dessert named Eric (no joke)Most impressive was that the head chef meticulously inspected each dish that left the kitchen.It was easily one of the best culinary experiences of my life, and I was only disappointed that I couldn't return again without having to fly all the way from Vancouver. And for the price (around $70/person including a bottle of wine), I found it reasonable given that I've spent the same amount for less food and worse quality.Le Filet, je t'aime!"
/user_details?userid=6sDi6J8TKF1tm8iBAQI-RA,Mike S.,"Madison, WI",1 star rating,"All the other Yelp reviews from this summer tell me that our experience was unusual, so I'm writing this to help you avoid our mistakes. We may be the only couple in North America for whom Le Filet was a bust.We went at 7 on a Friday night in August. The atmosphere felt weird--the servers were awkward, and seemed uncomfortable around us. My French is awful and so we had to speak in English, which didn't help.The food was what shocked me. One dish--the scallop and avocado salad--was wonderful in all the ways we expected: fresh, clever, technical, and delicious. Everything else tasted burnt, flavorless, or worse. If I have one piece of advice to offer, it is this: do not order the onion rings. I loved seeing them on the menu, witty evidence that Le Filet does not take itself too seriously. Our server said they were on the menu because they were really quite good, so I went for it. They were burned, and while that may have been it they tasted so bad I wondered if there was some other problem as well. Stale batter? Skunky oil? We saw other folks leaving their onion rings uneaten--why didn't someone in the kitchen notice the problem?The main courses were our main disappointments. The salmon was texturally perfect: a melting, almost jellied consistency that was a pleasure to eat. The flavor, though, was wrong: everything would be fine for a couple bites, but then a bitter, charred taste would overwhelm anything you would want in your mouth. The octopus was flavorless except for an aftertaste of char.Our experience is clearly an outlier, and you would probably be right to dismiss it as unlikely to happen to you, but we felt so burned by the experience that if we ever get to visit Montreal again (and I hope we do!) we wouldn't even consider giving Le Filet another chance."

Between my gf and I we had the Crab Risotto Shellfish Jus, Pork Flank Seared Scallop, Lobster Spaghetti, and Asparagus fresh from Quebec.

YAY!!!!Super amazing food!!I heard from that place from 2 good foodie friends so tonite was THE night I tried it!! I called last nite around 1am to make a rsvp and the only thing available was at 5:30pm at the bar until 7pm. It was perfect timing as we had to leave early for Hockey game at 7pm.We arrived early at 5:30m, we were the 2nd customer to arrive and my only EARLY dinner RSVP EVER! But we were well received my the hostess (male) and welcomed to the bar where we made rsvp and Alexandre took care of us.I have to say that the staff can't be better than this. Was surprised to find out that it was ALL male!.They are all very polite, knowledgeable, friendly, happy and very customer oriented....so rare these days!The restaurant looks good, black color with stainless steel deco with a LONG bar (my fav!) and an open kitchen, YES!!!This is the kind of resto that you can order whatever and you are assured that it will taste fantastic.We started the nite with the betterave, rillettes of maquereau and agneau carpaccio. Then we followed with riz de veau, morue, onion rings and ravioli with squash. Interesting to find out that the wine list includes just as much white as red wine....not suprised since it is a FISH place!The PERK of this place is that is it kinda Tapas dish size.....just slightly larger.They do encourage sharing the plates.I would try this place again and again!!I would recommend it again and agin!!Super excited about Chasse et Peche quality food and price but a casual flair about it.I still wanna cry about about the MORUE!!! It was more than delicious!"

Yes, that's what happens when the guys from Club Chasse et Pêche open a new seafood spot.Located on Mont-Royal between Parc and St-Laurent, Le Filet is an easy-to-miss modern space and a great addition to the Plateau/Mile End high-end resto scene. It's also in on the city's latest dining trend - tapas sized portions. Trying different dishes all while eating to satisfy my current hunger level? J'aime. After helping us with our decision-making, our super courteous and helpful waiter brought out our first dish - the scallop, avocado, orange and beet salad ($16). It was just so delicious and refreshing, we couldn't get enough of it. Raw scallops can be very hit-or-miss... These were definitely a huge hit.Next, the flounder dish. It was accompanied by Japanese prune purée, wasabi and tiny cubed cucumbers ($13). The fish was cool, fresh, and paired with the perfect balance of sweet and spicy accoutrements. Great!Next we had the cod with macadamia nuts, celery root purée and chorizo flakes ($17). It was moist, flaky and well seared.The snow crab risotto with asparagus and crustacean sauce ($19) was definitely the hit of the night. It was so ridiculously delicious! The Arborio rice was cooked to perfection, the consistency was neither runny nor too thick and we could really taste the crab. A description won't do it justice, you have to try it yourself.The grilled octopus with bone marrow and cherry tomatoes ($17) was also incredible. One of the city's best, along with Tasso Bar à Mezze's of course.Our last dish was the pork belly, which came with a seared scallop and creamy polenta ($15).  It was tasty, but I've been eating more than my fair share of pork belly lately so I have a lot to compare it to - my favorite is still Pastaga's.For dessert, we chose the caramel cheesecake with apples and pear chips ($9) and the praline parfait with chocolate mousse and crumble ($10). Both were enjoyable and we certainly finished every bite, but Le Filet seems to be another Montreal restaurant whose desserts don't fully live up to its mains. It's not a long way though, so it shouldn't be too hard... Le Filet, I believe in you.Le Filet is a serious restaurant. The hostess promptly checks your coat upon arrival, waiters thoughtfully recommend food and drink according to your preferences, and a 30-50 year-old crowd makes the place buzz.

The atmosphere and ambiance was trendy and the staff were generally friendly. The food was nicely presented and everything was extremely flavourful. This restaurant is tapas style dinning so all shared plates. We had:- an unbelievable salad with scallops, avocado, tangerines, and beets - it was amazingly tasty. - a creamy and super tasty crab risotto - raw oysters with red different sauces - they were ok but not the same as you would get from an oyster house. I also prefer my oysters with just lemon- hamachi in sesame sauce - this had a grat flavour - the half lobster with hollandaise sauce - spectacular - sautéed greens Everything was wonderful in terms if taste. There were three of us at dinner and the only complaint I have is that the portions were much too small for 3 people and they did not see to adjust for the size of the party nor did they recommend enough plates for us.  I would say that if you have 3 people you need to order 10 plates in order to be satisfied at the end of the meal. Regardless of how much we ordered I think the the plates are too small for the amount that they charge for each plate. Beers were reasonably priced."

Concept is small plates designed to be shared, the problem was that there was barely enough for one, much less two. According to our server, you were supposed to order things in sequence and she literally turned her nose up at us and rolled her eyes because we wanted to order in a different sequence, but we obeyed her rules and ordered as she said. Nothing we ordered had any real flavor, everything was very bland and did I mention small.  I was hoping for a great meal based upon the reviews, but paid our $200.00 bill and left feeling empty and severely disappointed.

I`m not typically one who will ask many questions in regards to a menu as I am well versed, however I do appreciate and welcome suggestions, and the like, especially when I know I will be forking out a nice amount of coin.When we actually did put forth our simple questions, we were provided with something to the effect, ""well the chef is Japanese so all portions are small, figure it out""!  Haha, really? Was that meant to be funny?Food was great, and the wine I CHOSE, was divine. Cavatelli with foie gras and veal cheak is ridiculously good.Cheers."

/user_details?userid=JQUHftc7J8T-fACOTtf9mg,Stephanie L.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,One of the best meals I've had in a while.  Especially loved the pace of the meal: each dish was meant to share and we were able to enjoy each dish one-at-a time.  Celery root puree with Foie Gras is a must!
/user_details?userid=1CKkup6UnII7_sIHwJrehg,Stephanie M.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,"Small portions, but it was DELICIOUS. we had oysters to start and the maple duck. the oysters with braised cheese on top were A+++. the ducks was close-your-eyes-and-moan tender and juicy. service was also really good, even though the restaurant was packed."
/user_details?userid=QyrV8IXzeCBOqS4Pj2DGUQ,Samantha A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Very nice restaurant, the decor and the ambiance are great, just too noisy. As soon as we sat the waiter recommended us a few menu items to share, we were 6 and he advised us to go with a choice of 7 items (oyters salmon lamb....) the adjusted the quantity of each meal so we can all have a bit of everything... every dish was tasty but just a bit too pricey."
/user_details?userid=T40u1FJXOOYs3rmOnwGm6A,Kiera S.,"London, United Kingdom",2 star rating,"Overpriced for the quality and service. Food was decent, but very small plates, like two bites per plate (which would have been fine if the quality was there). Only one plate stood out as excellent (Japanese plum/wasabi). Was underwhelmed by the service - waiter was sloppy and slow.  Decor was ok, but nothing exceptional. Honestly, I'm not sure why this place gets so much hype."

The soups and salmon were delicious and wonderfully prepared.  However, the waiter gave me some attitude when I said we didn't want to do the chef's tasting, making the ordering process somewhat unpleasant."

/user_details?userid=C63nSmO0gBQt3I8953wAlQ,Michael Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,My favorite tapas resto in Montreal. Expensive as hell but worth it. Each bite is a revelation. This lace was opened by the guys who opened chasse et peche and they know what they're doing...
/user_details?userid=5LnBLpyVvruKazXxiyDCqQ,Alan G.,"Manhattan, NY",3 star rating,"The food was good but not rushing back The evening got off to a bad start. I called in the afternoon inquiring if they had valet parking. The woman said,""no."" I then asked if there is easy parking to which she said, ""yes"" on a few streets surrounding the restaurant. Wrong. We drove for about 25 mins looking for a parking spot on all the surrounding blocks. We dropped off two members of our dinner party at the restaurant shortly before our 8pm reservation. It didnt matter, our table was not ready for at least 30 mins after our 8pm reservation and at that time they put 4 of us in a table where all the other parties used that as a table for 2 people. Additionally, this table was in the most trafficed lane of the restaurant. The staff said it usually isnt this way but it was very busy today and the first seating was running late. The waiter was competent and the food was good. At the end of the meal the maitre d' came over to our table, opened a bottle of sauterne and gave the 4 of us a small glass to drink. He apologized for any inconvenience. It would have been a better gesture to take off a couple of the drinks that were ordered while we were stranded at the bar than an additional drink that would not have been ordered. Overall, a good restaurant but probably not returning"
/user_details?userid=3310ONFwWDOskab3qXW3eQ,Larry H.,"Bloomington, IL",5 star rating,"One of the best dining experiences ever for us. Started with Oysters (both preparations) then tuna tartare. Moved on to grilled octopus, linguine with clams and finished with scallops with pork shank. Not one thing we didn't love. Enjoy this place everyone."
/user_details?userid=wnRv7PRPZ0jU_flnGJnYAg,Mark R.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,Great atmosphere and menu selection - though the execution falls short with small sharing portions and seemingly bland food.
/user_details?userid=ASvRNeHLjI5zR-OY8QDmbg,Lil J.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"If I could give this place 10 stars I would because it was just that good.  If you come to Montreal and do not eat at Le Filet then you have not lived.  I live in NYC and eat at a number of remarkable restaurants but Le Filet definitely stands out amongst the best.  Every dish we sampled was spectacular and it was difficult for me to select my favorite.  We sampled the Half lobster, hollandaise, urchin; Crab risotto, asparagus, shellfish jus; P.E.I. beef strip loin, fava, parsnip, bone marrow; Onion rings; Whipped potatoes; Grilled vegetables; and Maple syrup square, whipped cream, pecans for dessert.  If I was forced to rank them I'd say crab risotto, half lobster, and beef in that order.  The maple syrup square deserves its own scale because it was out of this world tasty.  The review would not be complete if I did not mention the wonderful hospitality of the owner.  He was so warm and welcoming and made what was already an outstanding experience even better.  Bottom line, if you only have time to visit 1 restaurant in Montreal this should absolutely be your choice."

Really, in my life, the best.Service: Very friendly, very helpful, very slow.Overall, fine, nothing exceptional."

/user_details?userid=EmnSDHtcP3dj4KDqSeMT1A,Annie A.,"San Clemente, CA",5 star rating,"We sat at the bar and proceeded to have one of the best meals of our trip to Montreal.  It was just the two of us so it was suggested by the very pretty brunette bartender to order 4 dishes to share since the menu was tapas style. So we shared the salad-scallops with avocado, orange and beet (so so good), then celery, foie gras, oyster, parmesan soup (amazing!), the cavatelli, foie gras, veal cheek (rich yumminess) and the sweetbread, lobster, squash gnocchi, porcini (oh so delish).  We finished it off with a maple syrup square, whipped cream, pecans (very nice).  The staff was excellent.  Best service, very attractive and very fun.  You need to go here!!!  Thank you Gilbert for the suggestion to dine at Le Filet!"
/user_details?userid=a0N4BvxzFIlVUnfxiMFk3w,Helen B.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,Great restaurant where you feel you're eating amongst locals. Tuna tartare and pecan desert were the highlight but everything else was amazing too. Staff were so friendly & helpful - the right balance between being there when you need them but also not making you feel uncomfortable. We were very lucky to get a table on Sat night having only called that day as long as we didn't mind eating at 10pm - for this quality & price - I'd do it all again & again !
/user_details?userid=icDX15PpD-rNrNBQjshOzg,Charlotte A.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,Hands down.  The best restaurant I have ever been to in Montreal.  Amazing use of fresh ingredients.  Fantastic MENU and the environment/service was impeccable.  A must!
