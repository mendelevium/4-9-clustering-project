/user_details?userid=6tNgilB-JtOLjt9e6FM64A,Yuriko M.,"Jericho, NY",5 star rating,"I went to this restaurant with my son who goes college in Montreal. They are just opened, and no liquor license yet.We ordered pork, chicken and shrimp fry which were all taste good and meats were tender.I hope if they add miso soup for plates, but the prices are very reasonable and you can request more rice for free.Nice to have in the neighborhood!"
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The food was generally solid. Though: (1) some items were surprisingly pricey, (2) portion size is inconsistent (e.g., Karage is small - but very good - while sliced  beef over rice and tonkatsu are pretty sizeable)... inconsistent in both these ways. Some items not correctly described in Uber delivery menu (e.g., tonkatsu item doesn't mention rice, so I bought extra... which was unnecessary).Anyway, most complaints above get - I think - eliminated with the knowledge of past ordering experience. So I'll definitely order again (and may review my rating upwards in the future)."
/user_details?userid=X_y7ie2wPylfH9McMcJULg,Joel J.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,"Found this place thanks to yelp right after moving into our new airbnb. The reviews and food looked good so decided to give it a try. The restaurant was simple but nice. The menu had a good variety of options and everything looked delicious. We got the katsu, wings and steak bowl. The food was all prepared fairly quickly but was made fresh. The food had plenty of flavor and very filling. I would definitely come back to try more of their food."
/user_details?userid=i8q-S7WFNkfgOVBx7K6tPw,Yao W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It was rainy outside,Quiet and cozy inside,Our steak medium rare,With our own Belgian beer,Japanese Tonkatsu fried We surely also tried,Chicken-tasting tofu,You'll find these all in Raku,Albeit no dessert that night,We three had a delight!"
/user_details?userid=MjqfukTWimz3D0w-cp5fDg,Kathy P.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Good price.Good service.Good food.We were 2. One appetizers and 2 main dishes. Less than 30$ tips in!The tonkatsu and chicken katsu were good! It was crispy! The presentation somewhat looks like what I had in Japan! Would definitely come back and try their beef dishes! I haven't tried other katsu in Montreal, but this one isn't bad at all. The chicken could actually be a little more cooked! The Raku sauce was also tasty.If you're on a budget and want a decent portion food, give it a try!"
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We randomly found Raku on Yelp when my Toronto friends had Katsu craving. The restaurant is VERY new. You may get confused from the exterior as it still has labeling of the previous Mexican business. The space is very big, large enough to fit a tent ! (at the time they used it for kids ) I found that funny. They did not have a liquor license at the time, so we were allowed to bring our own wine. Good thing there is an SAQ in the area. I really liked the chicken katsu curry- this was my first time trying this Japanese dish. It was kind of like a poutine gravy kind of sauce for the curry. I liked the traditional presentation of the dish as well. I think this venue has a lot of potential, once its cleaned up. Go for the food! not luxury!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I had the chicken katsu and tried all 3 sauces (raku, original and garlic mayo avocado). All 3 were delicious but the garlic mayo was my favorite because of the strong garlic flavor. The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. All 3 sauce complimented it pretty well. The service was quick and the guy was super nice and friendly. The outside is very dark and it was hard to find the restaurant but the inside is very clean and cozy. Would definitely come back."
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My friends and I came here Friday night. First of all it's BYOB so bring something to drink! It's not advertised online. When I asked for a drink menu the waiter said we could bring our own! So a friend walked five minutes in the rain so that we could have some wine. I love that it's BYOB! This restaurant has been opened for only a month. The name of the previous restaurant is still everywhere and there's things that still need to be done in terms of decoration and electrical work. The food is good! My boyfriend and I ordered the edamame, karaage, tonkatsu and the roast beef salad. My favorite was the tonkatsu and then the karaage. Anything deep fried is good. The portions are pretty big which I liked.I think the edamame could have been more salted. The tonkastu is breaded pork with rice ands side of salad with a bit of mashed potatoes. You can pick 3 different sauces : original, RAKU, and garlic avocado mayo. I couldn't tell if there was any avocado in the mayo but that sauce was the best. I would put it on everything if I could. I left feeling full and satisfied and the price is very affordable! The owner came to talk to us and he was really nice. He was the one cooking in the back. They were only two people working at the restaurant which is really impressive! Especially since the service was good."
/user_details?userid=akCG-uYnMqaRR0fr1zpyig,David G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I've ordered from here a couple times on Uber eats and picked up food once. I would rate the food a 3 stars. Its satisfactory but nothing exceptional for the price. I usually order the chicken katsu, which is pretty minimal, just the chicken, some plain white rice, and a tiny side of slaw. Katsu is crispy and good, but for the price I would have expected something a bit more. One time, the slaw definately did not seem fresh. Overall, it's alright for a late night craving of katsu."
/user_details?userid=QgpS7Fj7LWubIQD20lqzVA,Lance L.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've spent a lot of time in Asia, including many months in Japan, and this hands down one of the best Japanese curries I've had outside of Japan. You're unlikely to find better in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=iZO6FkqgNcncfdpA1nEoaw,Carmen H.,"Stratford, CT",5 star rating,"Recommended to this place by a friend. We came here around 230AM. Place was pretty empty except for mine and another table. We ordered:chicken katsu curryGyu DonKaraage Food took a little while to come out but it was worth the wait! Smaller portions than expected, but it did the job!The staff were friendly and made conversation with us!"
/user_details?userid=ec-xr6gl2j163kvU_MkcUg,Erik A.,"San Francisco, CA",1 star rating,Food is super over priced and they LITERALLY have a tent in the middle of their dining room.to think I made an account just for this
/user_details?userid=GbDfPbqp7gKRwbn116KDSA,Ben K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,It's 1h45. I just finished consuming a 4L pitcher at a Sergakis hole in the wall bar. What do I dream of? Karaage chicken fried to perfection and a restaurant that's mysteriously open until 4am. Thank youuuuuuuu Rakuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
/user_details?userid=y-HQyRMoRJVymFh4pHV5yg,Heidi P.,"Palo Alto, CA",5 star rating,"Excellent place with a chill vibe. It's a bit hard to see from the outside, but you'll see it if you just look for the black metal railings. The inside is beautifully decorated and the owner is awesome to talk with. We ordered the edamame, Takoyaki, Chicken Karaage, and Chicken Katsu with Raku Sauce. Everything was so delicious that we cleaned our plates. Will definitely be returning to try the different dishes."
/user_details?userid=UJjTxusMKuioqBkJ71DUSA,Chelsea L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Came here for dinner and it was amazing! The place is super cute and it was a very relaxing dining experience. We ordered the karaage to start and it was extremely really good and juicy. The katsudon was tasty and it was great that the katsu and egg weren't super mixed together so you still had the crunch from the katsu. The chicken katsu with avocado garlic mayo was delicious and super generously portioned. The piece of chicken was quite large and each bite was crispy and juicy. The owner/chef came out to check up on us and to ask us how we enjoyed our meal which was thoughtful and really shows how much he cares about his customers. Overall it was a great experience and I'd definitely come back and bring my friends!!
/user_details?userid=qQHlffbB-Jr5ViwgBmwYQw,Jonathan H.,"Berkeley, CA",5 star rating,I've been visiting Montréal and was missing Asian food since the selection is limited here.  I was feeling rice so something like donburi sounded great.  After seeing Raku's photos on Yelp I was sold.Raku wasn't very busy but the service was very attentive.  The katsu don was delicious and I would definitely come back!
/user_details?userid=p6kQFu2hQIcEUhrSbhhQrQ,Philippe J.,"Miami, FL",1 star rating,"Love to get played by Yelp reviews. This is why I try to avoid this app..After reading the glowing recommendations , I started dreaming about octopus balls like the ones I had in Japan . Drove 25 minutes to find the place closed @ 11:30 PM with a tent in the middle of the dinning room where I guess is where the staff sleeps ... Thanks for the fake reviews Raku ."
/user_details?userid=NkMOVXd9lb9V57tLaQ4vNQ,An T.,"Rawdon, Canada",5 star rating,"Came to Raku with my bf for dinner on a friday evening. We ordered the karaage (fried chicken) as our appetizer and it was really yummy - the chicken skin was super crispy and the meat was moist/very tender. As for our main dishes, we had tonkatsu and chicken oyakodon. We really enjoyed both dishes! The owner was also super friendly  _ We will definitely come back to try the rest of their menu!"
/user_details?userid=x9zfveYl1S6Za1AQmaSi7w,Sumin T.,"Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Prices are low for good food. Don't go there for the decor though. Went there during their special half price on donburi and was pleasantly surprised. I mean that place sells onigiri packaged to go right by the cash, what more can you ask for? Definitely going back for a quick eat."
/user_details?userid=GQGiKFchS1LwcVNfAiOYxw,Chuxian W.,"Orlando, FL",5 star rating,"Really good taste and environment, I tried many Japanese food in Montreal, this one I like the most."
/user_details?userid=6WCZer1RBOBrfBHKf9bFhA,Matt D.,"Hayward, CA",5 star rating,Great food. Chill atmosphere. Pleasant owner. Always a good time. Did I mention the great food? It's seriously delicious.
/user_details?userid=BlqSs9gbO7UeJ35CCn8lHA,Erik D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place used to be a tapas place I believe that closed. The food is pretty delicious. You can tell the cook is very committed to improving their offering and getting feedback from their customers. We had the spicy crispy chicken, octopus balls, the kimchi, the steak bowl, the pork steak side and they were all delicious. The kimchi was a bit on the sour side but I think that is a personal preference (prefer less acidic and more on the savoury/salty side). They didn't have their liquor license yet but it will be great once they do. Will go again!"
/user_details?userid=t1Yzh7Y1uRkvu67rDQW7Ug,Gustavo H.,"Orlando, FL",5 star rating,The food was pretty good! And the attention was really amazing!! They pay attention to the costumers
/user_details?userid=u1-Wk2VB3wxqCDjtIqvh0Q,Taiki M.,"New Westminster, Canada",5 star rating,The best tonkatsu in Montreal!!!! Most of their foods are relatively inexpensive and REAL Japanese local foods! (Japanese's opinion) The owner has worked for one of the most famous tonkatsu chains in Japan for a few years. So their tonkatsu is REAL unlike most Japanese restaurants here and can even compete with other tonkatsu restaurants in Japan!!
/user_details?userid=H70-G0RAm1yK1DyseH5Pfw,Jason H.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"There used to be a really great Japanese place on the corner of our street and we've been looking for a place to fill that void ever since it closed. That search is now over. Raku is fantastic. The food is delicious, the service is really fast and friendly, and the prices are very reasonable. Bring your own wine, too! Why are you still reading this? GO EAT THERE."

We ordered Japanese curry, Tonkatsu and taloyali. Tontaksu and curry were amazing. The owner was very kind too. The waiter spoke was a little shy, but they were all very generous and caring. I would visit again very soon and recommend this place to everyone!"
