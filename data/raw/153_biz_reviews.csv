Quick and friendly service, beautifully decorated, and the BUTTERY NON-BUTTER BUNS!!! To die for. It's a bit higher in price point for me to be a super regular customer but I will definitely be dragging non-vegan folks here for lunch. ALSO keep an eye out for their specials."

I had their flagship Tofu Nashville which is breaded and fried spicy tofu in a brioche bun with vegan mayo and pickles, alongside a huuuge serving of fries. I can honestly say that this was the best tofu sandwich I've ever had; it tastes just like fried chicken! I would've loved to try their truffle mac n cheese but they were sold out for the day. Prices are reasonable and service is quick and efficient. I also love that they use 100% local ingredients!"
/user_details?userid=VUS9-ABMF37mbHG5aMaaZw,Gabriella F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"AMAZING! We tried a bit of everything. The tofu burger was insane, crispy, firm, and the brioche bun added a perfect sweetness with the spice. The vegan/bean burger was very good, nothing exceptional but still delicious. The truffle mac&cheese (only available for a limited time) was unbelievable. I couldn't even tell it was vegan. The sauce was cheesy and the flavor of truffle amazing. The deep fried oreos also amazing, crispy outside soft inside. The batter wasn't heavy at all. Can't wait to go back! I love that the menu is small and every week they add some extra little dishes with local, in season produce. Also very reasonable prices."
/user_details?userid=rkPrz6uwJIefZdH2Oqv4Tg,Christian C.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is Montreal's first mostly vegan southern food restaurant, taking on the vegan scene that's often dominated by kale salads and smoothies and adding a good portion of fried soul food goodness to the table.By far my favorite is the southern tofu, it's marinated and fried to perfection, using the right spices, and for me - a seasoned vegan - it tasted just like the fried chicken that my mom used to make at home. Honestly, that fried tofu could come in a large tofu bucket and I'd pay for it! Make sure to get it spicy, don't skimp on the spice, it's good for the soul!The mac and cheese wasn't exceptionally cheesy but it hit the spot, it's comforting and it takes you back to childhood. We also enjoyed the pulled barbecue jackfruit and it was perfectly smokey and delicious! The potato salad was not heavy at all, being plant based, so you can eat all the carbs and get some desert after if you want to!I'll definitely come back for that fried tofu, it's the perfect fix I needed after a loooong week."
