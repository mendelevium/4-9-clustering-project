I will add that I have never been to Berlin. Also, I live within 100 m of the restaurant. I ordered the curry wurst plate. Truly delicious ! My gf had the diner box medium , also delicious!What sells me is the originality. so if you have never been to Berlin give it a true"

I took the Chicken Kreuzberger Döner sandwich the first time. The vegetables are really good and well seasoned. Today I ordered a Döner Poutine and a Döner Box for delivery and it's super tasty as I got it there.I regret not being able to get the sandwich but the box is good as well !"
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Cool place with a pretty unique vibe. Station Berlin serves doners in really generous portions! The interior is painted in yellow and black, the two colors of the Berlin metro system. Amazingly, there's a Street Fighter arcade machine in one corner!!  It seemed pretty busy when we got there, but we got our orders fast. I also asked for a bottle of water, but since they ran out of them, the girl kindly poured me a cup of water and returned my money. The doners were very tasty, although the beef got a bit salty after a while. The (tzatziki) sauce was nice and fresh, but was mostly at the top of the doner. Prices were fair given the size of the portions. We had a nice meal!"

The place is small and there are a few tables only, but if you are 2-3 people, you should have no problem with sitting. They have a pretty average menu to satisfy your different cravings from doners, salads, currywurst, schnitzels, etc. A nice spot overall for lunch"

It was very modern and clean , airy with big windows and lots of seating. I wanted to try their chicken schnitzel but they were all out  when I went, I'm looking forward to going back to give it a try. I had their doner and fries instead. The food was fresh and tasty and very filling !"

As usual, we don't have a good sense of portion control. Drooling over the pictures of the food, we ended up ordering the chicken doner sandwich combo and the currywurst poutine. Became a proper meal. The sandwich was SOOO GOOD that you have to try it to know what I mean. The chicken was perfectly cooked and oh the Turkish bread pockets. My husband said the currywurst reminded him of Germany. Give it a try!"

We live right next door and were excited when they added tons of advertising pictures and menus to their window and started doing take out during covid. Prior to that we'd always been meaning to eat there. First time I tried to order it was a Saturday night an hour before close the owner said sorry were slammed I can't help you unless you want a sandwich otherwise sorry. Side note is I was especially exiting to eat here because I've been to Berlin and I've enjoyed many Doner boxes, and currywursts. Then finally we order. The portions were skimpy and unimpressive, the flavour was nothing special and overall we were disappointed. It's obvious the fries were frozen. I ordered a medium doner box and  I legitimately thought they had made me a small by accident. The box was tiny, it wasn't even full. I got a few measly pieces of meat and a couple slices of cucumber. I asked for extra sauce and didn't get it. My boyfriend got the currywurst plate and his review was: Meh, I could make this at home. Overall it was disappointing and I most likely will not be eating here again unfortunately."

/user_details?userid=SAeScmq3cxbikwnjyTqjxQ,Ricky Boby L.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",2 star rating,"Was quite excited to go try this place. It has been my radar for a few months now, but because of the location,it's kind of hard going if you don't have a car.I have tried tons of kebab places in europe and have beeen craving for some in mtl. Unfortunetly this place doesn't do it for me. The bread was not crispy,there wasn't a lot of meat in it. And it tasted just okay. The price of a sandwich is quite expensive at 9.50 plus tax.There are better places like near concordia antep kebab..Will not be returning to this restaurant."

I had the halloummi cheese sticks (really good but very salty) and my boyfriend had the Doner sandwich (really good!). Friendly staff. Only giving 4 stars because there was no music so the ambiance was that awkward silence haha."

/user_details?userid=dSyC1rlanwac4peWtcKCMg,Eamonn D.,"Lennoxville, Sherbrooke, Canada",5 star rating,"First time ever going to this place, but not the last time. I went in here and got a chicken doner sandwich, with tzatziki and their spicy sauce as my two sauces. My girlfriend got a chicken doner poutine. Both were absolutely fantastic, really delicious stuff. The sandwich was hard to eat but that's just because they absolutely stuffed it with meat and veggies, which I can't complain about. The poutine gravy was delicious, and the meat on it was the same as in my sandwich so pretty damn good. I am not sure if the fries were included with my sandwich or not, but if not I'm not going to get them next time, not because they were not good (they were great), but just because the doner sandwich was so filling. As for service, a girl with dyed red hair served me at the counter and she was lovely, informing me of the student discount I happily took advantage of. I will absolutely be back again soon. Tldr; Delicious food, massive portions, friendly staff, good vibes. 5/5"

/user_details?userid=sLRy_vUUNF20rIemTY0jwQ,Charles B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The food is really great, I like everything I tried there. They have generous portion and its well priced. It in fact, it is so good that even if I don't like the service, I keep going back. I'm writing this most hoping the manager read this and fix the situation.It has a cool vibe. Very industrial with the mural and the arcade machine in the corner. The place has two TVs and they usually blast distracting reggaeton videoclip. I think it cheapen the place and hurt the ambiance. Apart from the TV I really like everything about their decor.The service is where they fall short. I'm hopping they will improve overtime but for now I can only report my own experience.The girl at the counter always seem confused. It could be because I speak french to her and she's not comfortable with the language, I don't know. I find her awkwardly rude. For example, sandwishes come with a choice of sauce, and when I asked what were the choices she just pointed at the board instead of answering. The first time I went for take out. We were 3, asked for their kebab boxes and had to wait 35 minutes. That's really long for kebab. It was their second week, so I guess that's fine.Second time, take out again, I went I was alone and asked for a döner. I waited around 20 minutes. There was a group of 6 people there when I arrive. I noticed that 2 of them where eating while the other 4 where still waiting. When I got my order, there was still 2 without food.Third time, I went with a friend. They had started serving alcohol, which was new. We both ordered döner with fries and a beer at the counter. When I asked what were the beer, she just pointed at the tap. Can't you just tell me the name and what type of beer they are? There is only two beer on the menu. The waitress told us to sit and she would bring our order. After 10 minutes of waiting, I awkwardly went to the counter to ask if we could have our beer while we wait. She seemed annoyed. Took another 10 minutes to get food.Fourth time, I went with my girl friend and nothing weird about the service happen. The order arrived quickly.I went for a fifth time. We where 5 people. We all ordered döner and the food arrived quickly but the order was mess up. They brought the food for 4 of us, and told the one of us that they ran out of bread and gave him some option for alternative. I don't understand how a döner place run out of bread, especially that early. The night must have been interesting. I would assume they noticed pretty early on they could not complete one of the sandwish but instead of coming and taking an alternative order they waited until we all got our food. So, in the end my friend not only didn't get what he paid for but also had to wait looking at us eating. My beef döner had the sauce swap with my friend chicken döner. They gave us 15% discount."

The vibe is nice, mimicking the color scheme and feel of the Berlin subway. Would recommend as a casual quick bite."
