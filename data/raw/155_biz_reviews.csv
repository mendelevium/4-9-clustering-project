Just an FYI; CHKPLZ has partnered up with the EVA ride sharing company to handle their deliveries.Used to go to this place quite often for brunch, before this indoor world party began...On the menu:* Chicken & Waffles (Kentucky-style fried chicken, waffles, maple syrup)* Double Cheeseburger (Caramelized onions, Porto demi-glace sauce, brioche bun, fries) (IInhaled the burger before I got to take a photo )I'm sorry, but this place is still the king of Chicken and Waffles to me.Massive waffles, baked to crunchy perfection, while retaining the perfect consistency on the inside. Equally massive, crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside pieces of chicken. Once you cover it up with the delicious maple syrup, everything disappears from your plate within minutes. I would even dare to say that the Chicken and Waffles dish is large enough to be shared by two people, provided that you're not starving.For the cheeseburger; a perfectly grilled beef patty, which is still partially pink on the inside, covered with cheese and Porto sauce, stuffed between sweet brioche buns and with a side of caramelized onions; it's a perfectly sweet mess of a burger. Throw the fries into the mixture of all the sauces and enjoy!Instagram: @foiegwa"
/user_details?userid=r6PbQjtij6gcalYWBBrILg,Maria B.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,This review is gonna be for breakfast and drinks since that's what I've had so far. HOLY COW this place is amazing I've been struggling to find a good brunch spot for a while and this place really does it. There's usually a line around the block for this place but to my surprise when you walk in you give your name and they text you when your tables ready. Came in this morning and for once didn't get eggs benny. I decided to get French toast with homade whip cream and in-house butter. Amazing not to sweet and definitely big enough to keep me full.My friend did get the eggs benny on ham and the egg and hollandaise was to die for a really rich and creamy flavour almost of if the eggs were picked in butter. The house potatoes are great and I love that the skin is left on and sprinkled with sea salt. Next time I'm here I'm coming for those blueberry ricotta pancakes
/user_details?userid=xZz56LNb1L1HUt2qb7rRBA,Roseanne N.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Coming to Foiegwa for brunch is probably one of my better decision-making moments in life. If you plan on coming here for brunch on a weekend, be prepared for a wait, because the food is THAT good. A summary of what we ordered: - Braised Beef Chipotle Eggs Benedict and Hollandaise Sauce - Scrambled Eggs, Black Truffle and Bordelaise Sauce - Latte- Ice Cream (side) The eggs benedict was spectacular. I added a side of Foie Gras ($10) and did not regret it. The dish came with a side of apple sauce, sliced tomato, and potatoes. The braised beef was sweet and tangy, which paired well with the creamy yolk. This already creamy bite becomes enhanced with the side of foie gras I opted for. Each bite was very buttery and rich. You definitely are satisfied by the end of it. The scrambled eggs were silky, soft, and divinely rich. The truffle is definitely present in this dish. They make it quite bland, so you can preferentially add salt. You eat it with the provided slices of crostini, and BAM, it's a bite of heaven. I really enjoyed this dish the most. It tasted very unique and you really savour each bite, because it is THAT good. We got a side of ice cream, which is just your typical soft serve vanilla in a cup. It's a great way to finish your brunch! The service here was very friendly, and I very much recommend this spot when in Montreal!"

The waitress was very welcoming, knew her menu very well and offered us a special available that day.The restaurant itself, although small, is beautiful. They have plants everywhere, a huge mirror wall and caricatures of celebrities everywhere on the wall. Heck, even the bathroom is beautiful!I started with an oat-milk latte which came with a little heart designed in it. The latte itself was insanely good!I ordered the smoked salmon benedict eggs. The plate came with potatoes, a small portion of apple-cinnamon jam or something like that, 2 slices of tomato. The food itself was absolutely delicious. Everything from the egg, the potatoes was full of flavours and felt fresh. My only issue is the price. The portions were small for the price I paid (20$ plate). Despite that, I would definitely recommend this place because the food is just delicious and the service was lovely!"

We were lucky enough not to have to wait a long time to sit down, but the waits can be pretty bad.The food is heavy so keep that in mind, it's not a light brunch spot. The best things here are the fried chicken and waffles so definitely don't miss out on that. I'm gluten free so the options aren't plenty, that's why I have it four stars. Otherwise so good and great vibe."
/user_details?userid=za-_E0w58gRS2_9mHicmkQ,Li S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I come here for they're signature dishes, the truffle pasta, the burger and tartare. You can't go wrong with of those. The cocktails are also amazing, the mixologist on point, with original selection on the menu. The only thing I would say, is o wish they had more signature dishes!!! More new items, but that might be selfish on my part. I also feel that the staff truly but truly cares about your happiness and is extremely attentive. My friend returned a dish after thinking she liked truffles and they didn't charge her, brought her a new dish without being rude or condescending. This is rare in the city for restaurants. This is why for this restaurants deserves a 5/5."

/user_details?userid=mY3NA8f6H0-i38SOjxyhFg,Dan P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If this was my first experience I would have given it a three out of five but because I know what to expect I was truly disappointed. The service has always been impeccable and super understanding. They will always do everything to accommodate you. However I find a brunch place with a coffee that's not very good takes away from the whole experience no matter how good the food is. I find their coffee way too bitter and that leaves a burnt taste. We both sent it back but even the second round tasted awful maybe it's an acquired taste but being with a Italian Friend who knows her coffee this was a strikeout. After having a conversation with the service manager they have received some comments about their coffee being bitter. So I hope they resolve this issue because this could be a deal-breaker for some of us. I did suggest maybe having a different Bean or roast that they can grind separately for those that find this coffee horrible.Being a huge fan of mushrooms we decided to share the mushroom omelette and tartine. The omelette was 5 out of 5 I personally found it perfect my friend did find it a little bit under salted. The mushroom definitely brought out the flavour and we can always add salt if needed. I always prefer my dish under salted then over salted. The tartine would have been a 6 out of 5 if the bread wasn't burnt and I'm not just saying over-cooked there was a thick layer of charcoal under. We didn't give it back because the flavours were just fantastic. It's a must have if you love mushrooms and even if you don't it's still a must-have. If this was my first time I would definitely give it a second chance, this wasn't my first time and it won't be my last I'm definitely coming back but I really hope they do something about the coffee."
/user_details?userid=T9pr92T_WjciqKeZKywo0A,Monica A.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,Foiegwa was one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal. When you walk in the restaurant it's a nice cozy feeling. My waitress was very friendly and helpful on deciding  on the many great options they have on the menu. The truffle pasta is a must! The portion size of the truffle pasta is good for sharing. I tried several plates and everything is made fresh. This place is great for brunch and Sunday dinners.
/user_details?userid=gtmYMrbneRKMuNMhVnoypg,Warren B.,"Sterling, VA",5 star rating,"I heard a lot about this place before coming and it is good as I've been told. Since I was alone I sat at the counter and watched the bartender mix various coffee concoctions and cocktails. She was very informative about the menu and surrounding area, she even corrected me on my French  I ordered Mochaccino Expresso and Eggs Benedict & Créme Fleurette Hollandaise w/ Braised Beef Chipotle. She described my meal before order and it came out absolutely as she originally informed me. It was delicious and I'm not a fan of coleslaw but I ate it. I watched her make Shamrock Coffee several times so I had to order one, Yes good! I'll be back!"
/user_details?userid=CLfqC-AQJLkmOHV3d-KCZg,Kandi R.,"La Salle, Canada",3 star rating,"Seriously people why?! This place was NEVER on my to-do list. The hype from the getgo had me like ""No effin way"". So why on earth did I bother at all, you ask? Well, because my friend Kalli, the birthday girl, wanted to try it for brunch. So we came at 9:30 on a Sunday to beat the line (smart choice that worked). The verdict: not so upset I came and I tried, but so not worth the hype and totally worth skipping. Wayyyyy wayyyyy wayyyyy overpriced. Ridiculously so. And how they managed to turn that huge a$$ diner into a tiny closet of a bathroom eating space is beyond me. What did you do with all that space folks?? (This place used to be a Belle Province that was HUGE). My friends ventured that they enlarged the kitchen (to focus on the cuisine, of course), but with what came out of the kitchen I would like to suggest maybe they need an even bigger kitchen. Their mimosas were ridiculously expensive (60$$$ per bottle) and served with prosecco (not even champagne). Though at least our waitress was excellent in refilling our glasses, so at least the service for the mimosas made up for the price and quality. I had the duck confit and goat cheese omelet. It was good, but cheap on the duck, for a 20$ plate you could at least make sure you highlight the main ingredient a bit better. It did have a satisfying amount of goat cheese though, so kudos for that. The breakfast potatoes here are nasty. They look like they should be delicious, crispy exterior, fluffy interior, but they were dry overcooked and disgusting. I'm Irish-Cdn and I left most of the potatoes uneaten.. ""You know it's bad when..."" , totally unacceptable for a 20$ plate. Someone please teach your cooks how to make potatoes.The bacon I ordered on the side (3 slices) was perfectly cooked and if I were to have to come here again, I might just order sides of bacon and skip the rest. Birthday girl ordered a scrambled egg dish that looked like oatmeal covered in chia seeds with a dark sauce drizzled on it, (it wasn't at all that, but that's what it looked like) and she insisted she liked it, but it looked nasty. Our dude friends ordered eggs n sausage with the added Foie Gras for 10$ extra for a piece as big as my thumb (jacked price much?!). They enjoyed, but I found the Foie Gras just ok, creamy and likely perfectly cooked, but bland. Service was generally good, not fantastic, not bad at all, a coupla wierd moments, but nothing to make or break the impression of the place. For the prices here I would have expected much more client-centered care, which is not the case, not professional waitstaff material, just ur run of the mill student-waiter type. Oh and 1 tiny bathroom for everyone to share, there was always, always someone waiting for it.So yah, overall don't even bother. People are suckers to believe the hype about this place. There's much better to discover in Mtl and this ain't it."

/user_details?userid=Zjcyc6ZUGrCaRYIj0G213g,Philip C.,"San Jose, CA",5 star rating,"Possibly our favorite meal in Montreal. We had to take an Uber there but it was totally worth it.Cocktails: nice and strong. I had the Maple Old Fashioned and it was good.Bone marrow: small snack but comes with an amazing, almost Asian-inspired brown sauce that we soaked up with the complimentary bread. So yummy.Spaghetti with black truffle: Yelpers are totally correct. This is one dish to die for. So fragrant and the spaghetti is al dente.Burger with foie gras: so many fries! The foie gras was small but had great flavor. The burger was cheesy and messy, everything you'd want in a good burger.Panna cotta: a good light finish to the heavy meal.Service can be slow sometimes but we enjoyed our cocktails at the counter seats. It also turned out the name of the restaurant is a humorous take on English speakers who butcher the pronunciation of ""foie gras.""Highly recommended."
/user_details?userid=zlkPhQEFpodOAGDXWvkCcw,Sarah I.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,I've had consistently good experiences at Foiegwa. The decor and ambiance are great - it feels kind of like an upscale diner. The drinks are creative and nicely presented (they are connected to Atwater Cocktail Club after all). The real draw for me however is the truffle pasta. I order it every time I come here. The truffle shines without being too overwhelming and the portion size is perfect. I highly recommend it - it's the best truffle pasta I've had in Montreal. This place is often quite busy in the evenings so I would recommend a reservation.
/user_details?userid=Tv_EBrwNtPzgP_F4XoiM7w,Stephanie T.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"I was recommended this restaurant by a friend from Montreal and the pictures on Yelp really sold us. Reservations can be easily booked on their website.After recommendations from my friend and the waitress, we decided to share the beef tartare to start (the smaller size). My boyfriend had not tried beef tartare before, so we were unsure if he would enjoy this. They also bring some bread to pair with the tartare, and I liked how well composed the tartare was. The larger size comes with a side of fries or salad. However, the small size was probably the perfect size for us, as there's only so much raw beef we can eat.Next, we ordered the truffle pasta and their burger with fries, adding in the foie gras for $9.95. The waitress sold us on the foie gras by saying it was the best pairing ever, with the juices and flavour from the foie gras leaking onto the burger. Unfortunately, once we received the burger, the foie gras was nowhere to be seen. The waitress instead brought one on the side, and we placed it in the burger. Maybe because it was served like this, we didn't find that the foie gras really improved the burger. By itself, it was already super delicious, with a very fresh tasting patty, melty cheese, and delicious gravy/sauce covering it. Not to mention all the fries they provided to soak up the sauce!The truffle pasta was delicious. At first it looks like a small portion, but trust me, it's such a heavy dish, you won't be needing more. The truffle flavour is prominent in every bite, and the creamy parmesan really added to the dish. I'd get both of these dishes again.We finished the meal with their soft serve ice cream topped with buttered peanuts and chocolate sauce. A really simple and refreshing dessert that was the perfect end to the meal.Note that even though reservations were gone on their site, the restaurant was about half full for the entirety of our meal. So you could probably call in for a reservation if spots were all gone online.Service was all right. The waitresses were friendly and reasonably prompt. I just wish that the foie gras was not missed on our order; a dessert or something would have been nice as a gesture. The experience may have been completely different if so.I'd come back to try their brunch. It's a bit on the pricier side for sure."

We had early reservations on a Friday night and from the time we were seated till the waitress presented our bill, the service was beyond excellent! We started with some cocktails; I ordered the Kung Fu Panda which not only came in a kitschy glass but was absolutely delish. We followed with a bottle of red wine which was outstanding, thanks to the recommendation of our lovely hostess. We stared with the burrata and Romano tomato tart which was good but lacked on the savoury side; maybe a little more cheese would have been nice. We then ordered some pasta plates, mostly as they seem to be highly popular; I went with the spaghetti dish with butter and black, served with egg and parm, while my friend had the night's special which consisted of ink fettuccine with garlic shrimp and lobster sauce. We both devoured our plates! The pasta was fresh and prefectures cook, and the combo of flavours were just plain outstanding; definitely a hit! We finished with some salted caramel ice cream and the brownie and coffee mascarpone cream. I can't even explain how good that brownie plate was; the dessert was not too sweet and perfectly moist, while the ice cream was nice and creamy. Based on this last visit, I would definitely return to this spot for the delicious comfort food, the nice vibe and great service!"

I've gone  back 2x just for that dish, still tue same, still amazing. If you like truffle, if you like pasta, give it a try! You just might love it too"

TLDR; yummy food very pricey for small quality.Food: we had the truffle pasta, bacon and eggs and the rosti. They were all tasty dishes, but a bit on the overpriced side for the quality and quantity of food. The truffle pasta was creamy and cheesy, and with just the perfect touch of truffle taste. The dishes were overall small and not quite filling. Ambiance/ decor: it's a cute lil restaurant on the corner of a busy street. The decor is very aesthetic, worthy of an instapost. The mirror, prints and plants look great.Service: not fast and not slow. Overall very decent. I don't think I will be back for brunch for some time, given the choices Mtl has to offer."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"Made a reservation for my family and I to celebrate my birthday! It was a Friday night 6:45pm. It was busy but not crowded given that the restaurant is small. Our waitress was amazing! So efficient, attentive and nice. I've been wanting to go to Foiegwa for the longest time but didn't have anyone to go with. It's such a beautiful restaurant! I love the caricatures on the walls and the french-ish look of the furniture. I ordered the famous spaghetti truffle, the beef tartar, and a milkshake for dessert. I also sampled their fries and cheese burger from my sister's plate. The food was indeed amazing. So filling but not filling to the point of being stuffed and uncomfortable, and flavourful yet also not too different from what I'm used to. I really would recommend both dishes, it was just so delicious. The milkshake was also great but quite ordinary. The cheese burger did surprise me since it was in a puddle of sauce so you couldn't eat it with your hands. The patty was good and the cheese melted just right. The sauce also did add a little kick to the whole thing. Their fries are also just ordinary but good. Second part of this review is for the brunch! I went with a friend and it was a Sunday around 2:30pm, I didn't think it'd be too crowded since it's close to closing time. there was a mini line up. We waited maybe 10-15 minutes for a table. Which is perfectly reasonable. We didn't get a great table though. It was the first two people one right in front of the entrance door. I ordered the eggs Benedict with bacon! It comes with mini potatoes on the side (a must for brunch in my opinion), and some jelly type thing in a small cup that I didn't touch (didn't touch the tomatoes either). It was really good. Not as good as their spaghetti and/or tartar though. So maybe I should've gone for sweet. Service was great this time too! She wasn't as friendly (didn't engage with us or anything) but she refilled our glasses often, was quick, and answered any questions we had. Overall, it is a bit pricey and crowded so it's really in your best interest to reserve in advance for supper and to maybe call and gage the wait time before brunch. Only reason it isn't a 5 is because I feel like I've had better experiences elsewhere for food/atmosphere. But I still highly recommend this place, at least once."

/user_details?userid=zh9vPYEETbOxivf1Ed4p-Q,Laura L.,"Virginia Beach, VA",4 star rating,"The food was very, very good. The service was very, very slow. To start- we had a reservation and thank goodness we did cause this place was very busy! We got seated right away and were starving so we ordered the bone marrow appetizer which was VERY delicious but a small portion - this was hard to share. Mostly cause I wanted to eat it all. hehe. A long time later, we got our other platter of foie gras terrine, apple compote, some kind of jelly, and bread. My first time eating foie gras and I really loved how rich it was. I loved doing different combinations with the compote and the jelly, with and without bread, oooh it was good.Lastly we got the famous truffle spaghetti and this was great too! A lot of flavor packed into a smaller dish, but don't be fooled- this was pretty heavy. The truffle flavor was just enough not to empower the dish which I liked. Usually truffle tends to be very strong and I am usually turned off by that.So the food was great, the ambiance of the restaurant is also very charming and hip. However it took forever to get our food and even LONGER to get the check. We had reservations for 6:30 hoping we could still check out a bakery down the street that closed at 8:00. Nope, we left closer to 9. Still wouldn't hold it against them, but this establishment is not a place you want to be if you're in a rush."

/user_details?userid=mLeMygUVo3j-RgP5XJQi8Q,Jennifer C.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here on a Saturday afternoon with 2 others, at around 12:30pm and only waited about 15 minutes, despite there being around 10 people ahead and maybe 10 more behind us. The line moved every 2 minutes or so, which was encouraging. Montreal folks take their brunch seriously.The service was hectic and it was hard to catch the server's attention, but they got around to taking our orders since we were seated right in front of a utensil tray. If you can get over the fact that the plating makes each dish look like an open-faced sandwich with smaller-than-optics portions, for its ingredients the entrees aren't actually unsatisfying for hangry adults. (And if you're still hungry Atwater market is just across the street anyway.) My course arrived with a poached duck egg with caviar(?) smoked salmon on top of a brick-shaped potato rosti. The salmon portion was quite generous, though I don't think I would have given myself so much aoili. It was an adequately savoury combination, though the amount of runny egg yolk vis-a-vis the available dry ingredients made the mouthfeel of each bite a bit too wet and I wish there were more rosti to counteract the abundance of jelloid egg and cream.My friend had a sweet tooth and ordered a brownie for us to share. I'm not even a chocolate lover but gosh, it was rich, and not overpoweringly sweet. It was bready on the outside, and ganache-like inside. I felt like I was eating flourless chocolate cake, in molten form. With three courses, a coffee and a brownie (and no side orders of foie gras) the bill came to $106. In trying to assuage my spending guilt on that debauched weekend, I decided to forego ordering foie gras ($10 per side) or brunch drinks."

I've visited twice; the first time I was underwhelmed and the second time, I was blown away.On the first visit, I ordered the Truffle pasta. It was basic and there was nothing memorable about it. I was reluctant to visit the restaurant again, but I was pressed for time and had heard good things about the Cheese Burger. So I returned once again and tried it for myself.Let me tell you, the Burger was fantastic - even the French Fries that came with it were delicious. Be warned though, it is messy. You can't pick it up with your hands, so don't even try. If you're going to order the burger, start brushing up on your fork/knife handling now.I've given 4 stars because the I can't forget how unimpressed I was the first time I visited. However, the second visit far surpassed all expectations. If I'm ever craving a burger, I will definitely return."

The closest subway is Lionel-Groulx and it's a 5-minute walk from there. Street parking is available but metered and hard to get - you can find free parking on side streets but check the zoning.The place: It's pretty small and the tables are close together. The decor is simple and similar to most hipster-like places. The vibe is good and I found the place to be cozy and bright.The goods: I ordered a latte and two eggs with sausage and potatoes. I don't know which roast these guys use but the coffee was awful. I found it a little bitter and there was a smoky taste to it that almost seemed burnt. In terms of food, it was solid and the portion was pretty darn good. I would have liked it to be hotter. One of my friends ordered the French toast and there was nothing left on his plate when everything was said and done. He mentioned it was a bit too sweet but nonetheless, he enjoyed it. Service: Good. We got there around 10ish and we were seated right away. The wait staff was friendly.Price point: My food was 8.50 but I don't recall how much the latte was. Not bad considering the location."
/user_details?userid=wlUfN4_5MPnuA3xFAjV2_g,Tiffany C.,"Columbus, OH",5 star rating,"A last minute reservation was placed for Foiegwa after hearing some great local recommendations. This appears to be a newer trendy spot that both locals, and tourists can like, but reservations really are needed, even on weekdays. The restaurant itself is charming in a diner meets hipster sort of way. It's clean, kitschy without being too cluttery. 1970's rock hits were played over the speakers. The clientele ranged from younger 9-5er's enjoying after work conversations and cocktails to older locals known by name. I ordered a cocktail, which I unfortunately cannot remember, but it was good AND strong. I ordered the cheeseburger topped with Foie-gras, because when in Rome, right? I received a cheeseburger topped with a couple pieces of Foie-gras, sitting in a pool or caramelized deliciousness, surrounded by a heaping mound of fries. A fork & knife type of affair, for sure! I was no match for the fries -- I tapped out long before 1/2 was devoured. The burger was good, the foie-gras was great (and btw, can be added to any dish you order).No room was left for dessert, and I was truly disappointed in myself, because it all sounded really delectable. The service was really great here. It was attentive and warming! I enjoyed my experience and would gladly come back here!Pricing is moderate, so save your sheckles!"

Had to try it out after so many people raved about it. We ordered the brioche French toast that was smothered in sauce and Chantilly cream. The toast was soft and not very crispy.

Well, that certainly is not the case for Foiegwa. I still remember when this place used to be a La Belle Pro and I was doubtful that they could fit a brunch spot here. The decor is absolutely beautiful, kind of like your standard diner but elevated with some whimsical and eclectic touches like the gold frosted mirrors and bw illustrations. The food is outstanding. Everything from the œuf bénédictine to the chicken and waffles was exceptional. It's always a good sign when a place's menu is relatively small so you know they're doing the few they have exceptionally well. I had the fresh fruits with sabayon, perfect blend between a fresh and a light sweet flavour. I can't say I'm not in love. If you're going on the weekend, either get there early or expect to wait at least 15 minutes. It's well worth the wait and you can't go wrong choosing Foiegwa."

So we made a wise decision to run over to Foiegwa instead. I was the only one in the group who's never been here before and everyone found it quite amusing.The place is decorated like a dinner, old-school feel for sure. Everything makes u think that u'd get nana's food and strawberry pie once seated. But nope, the menu surprised me. Frog legs, snails, truffle pasta, etc. I got the Kungfu Panda drink with gin & pandan, it was yummy. We had truffle pasta, scallop risotto, frog legs, market veggies, duck magret and the sole. Everything was delicious. The staff was friendly, funny and very helpful. I had a great time. We even head over to their bar Atwater Cocktail for a drink. I would definitely come back :)"

My two best friends are from out of town, and they were visiting for Easter weekend. I haven't seen them for three years. They asked me to find a place near a metro; so the first restaurant that popped in my head for brunch was Foiegwa near Lionel Groulx. The restaurant was booked so the hostess put me on the guest list. She said I will get a text when a table would be free. We went for a walk in Atwater Market, and started to catch up. We got a text within 1/2hr. Got seated, and my friends ordered croque Madame and I ordered eggs Benedict with spinach and goat cheese, and everyone with a cup of coffee. Everything was super delicious! We Enjoyed every single bite of our dishes! Service was super quick! After we finished our meal, right way we got our bills, and they asked us to free the table now...it was little disappointing because we didn't even finish our coffee... at the same time it's understandable since the lineup from outside was huge. We ended up later at my favorite bakery."

The seductively al dente black truffle spaghetti is crowned with a generous and heaping mound of Parmigiano reggiano which serves as a cosy nest for the perfectly cooked 64° egg yolk. The sex starts when you use your fork and spoon to gently toss everything together. You see that dark trufffffle rub up against that creamy spaghetti; everything glistens in the moonlight and glides ever so slowly together with the sensual help of the unctuous aromatic extra virgin olive oil. How about some of the best French fries this city has on offer, smothered in béchamel and black truffle with a generous heaping of Parmigiano reggiano. How about that? This place has everything you need to get into heaven. Enjoy."

I can see why now. We ordered the truffle pasta and the seafood risotto. I would give the risotto a 4/5 - it was a bit on the saltier side for me.  However, the home run was the truffle pasta -  that made me speechless. It was absolutely amazinggggg and you had to break the egg yolk on top which then trickle down and glazed over the pasta balancing out the truffle and Parmesan cheese. This has to be by far one of the best meals I've had on my trip. We also ordered the brownie, which was a disappointment. Too much cocoa, not enough sweetness, and not as dense as I would like it to be. If you're looking for an actual typical browner, I would avoid ordering the brownie.I gave this a 5 star because the truffle pasta just took it home!! Definitely a must try."

Kudos to their wine buyer. Aside from that the service was quite underwhelming. The staff was definitely having their own fun though. The food was decent, but not great. The bone marrow was good and the foie gras too, but the portions were weirdly designed. Their ""home made"" pasta dish was either mistakenly described or just really looked and tasted like dry pasta. Either way, not a success. In summary, I wouldn't recommend."

Surprisingly it was pack considering it was a week night.The food was good but very heavy and greasy. The cheeseburger was ok but very greasy and overpriced for what it was. It was a good thing that we didn't order the foie gras on the side given that it was already very oily. The soggy fries that came with the burger was actually good but again very greasy. The fried chicken was juicy, the truffle spaghetti was good but very heavy. They put way too much cheese on top of the spaghetti.....it literally covered all the pasta.I think it's a place you would go once just to try, and not go back again given the food is very heavy and greasy."

We had experienced and loved the kitchen front row seats at Au Pied Du Cochon so when i found out one of their chefs was behind Foiegwa we were in. Grabbed 2 seats at the bar to witness the kitchen and the bartender in their natural habitat. Love watching the drinks/shots flowing at 10am. Fresh juices and coffee smells filled the air with a view of amazing selection of liquors and whiskey lining the wall. We ordered the baked ratatouille with goal cheese in a flakey buttery pastry and the spinach goat cheese benedict. The best and most buttery hollandaise sauce ive ever had. My ratatouille had the standard peppers, zucchini, eggplant and tomates lined with fresh goat cheese and a delicious smokey roasted eggplant sauce. All wrapped around each other and baked into a delicious crust. Served with a fresh side salad!Fresh OJ and coffee complimented the meal perfectly. We were soooo full and delightfully satisfied from this perfect brunch."
/user_details?userid=GmnkvQM0AHVHoBiyK2-9mg,Tiffanie J.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Wow, Foiegwa. You have won over my heart!! I was just in Montreal for the first time this past weekend and wanted to try some good French cuisine. This restaurant was highly recommended by tons of people while I was researching where to eat. I came here right when they opened on a Saturday evening and my friend and I were seated immediately. I forgot our waiter's name, but he was VERY sweet throughout the night. My friend wanted a moscato d'asti, a sweet dessert wine, but they did not have it unfortunately. Our waiter kindly brought our about three different wines for her to taste, but they were all too strong of a taste for her. I was too reluctant to try the cocktails because I wasn't so sure on the liquors, but I hope to try them next time I'm back! We both ended up ordering a mimosa for the night, simple and easy. The mimosa was made of freshly squeezed orange and a nice champagne. Really refreshing, compared to most places I've been to, where they use juice from concentrate. We decided to order three things to share for the night and didn't want to over order since we weren't going to be taking leftovers home. We got the escargots, the truffle spaghetti, and the beef tartare, with two foie gras on the side. I was a little iffy about getting the foie gras, because I've had it once and vowed to never have it again because of the after taste. But my friend said to get it somewhere that specifically knows how to cook French or get it in a French populated area, such as Canada. Our food arrived fairly quick and was probably one of the best dinners I've had this year. To start off, the escargots were nice in texture, not overcooked, and lightly covered with butter. Very tasty and not overpowering. The beef tartare was a bit on the chillier side, but had a nice kick to it. The beef was tender and soft, but there were some nice strips of fried noodles that added a bite texture to it. It was my first time having beef tartare as well and I must say, not bad! I wasn't expecting beef tartare to be served raw, or to be raw in general, but it lived up to my liking since I do like my steak to be more on the rare side. The foie gras, WOW. I was not expecting the foie gras to be so delicious and tasty. It was truly and honestly WAY better than the one I've had before and this time, I could actually swallow and stomach it down. Foie gras is just a product that is fattened, so maybe that's why I enjoyed it because it reminds me that I'm eating that. Last but not least was the best dish out of the bunch; the truffle spaghetti. It was plated beautifully and topped with freshly grated parmesan cheese. The truffle was not overpowering and the sauce was evenly coating the pasta. The spaghetti was cooked al dente, so it had a nice bite to it. Everything was amazing from the staff, to the ambiance, and most importantly, the food. I can't wait to be back in Montreal and I can't wait to bring friends to experience this wonderful place!"

We were happy we made it!We arrived around 10:30 am on a Saturday and expected a huge line. There were several people waiting at the door but we walked right up to the hostess and she said there were seats at the bar available which nobody seemed to want so we were seated immediately.The bar is fun because you get to see some amazing drinks being made. One table ordered a round of shots that were half vanilla liqueur and half espresso which looked like a great way to start the day!I ordered a cereal killer cocktail and had the smoked salmon dish while my wife opted for a mimosa and some grilled cheese with soft boiled egg. My dish was clearly the star and I really enjoyed it!The cocktails were also great and added a fun play on breakfast. Would love to try everything here but our stomachs are only so big.One great thing is the Atwater Market is across the street so you can walk around there after breakfast to burn off the calories.

While it may not be the cheapest place to eat or have the biggest portions, this place is worth the splurge. I've heard about this place many times, and I'm so happy that I tried it out because the food did not disappoint.Me and my friends decided to start off with their fries with bechamel sauce and their bone marrow snack. The fries came in a very generous portion (great for sharing) with a creamy bechamel sauce topped with scallions, while the bone marrow came with a thin slice of bread and sauce which was small but rich in flavour and melted in your mouth. To drink, we loved the Bella Vita and Scarlet cocktails, which were tasty and refreshing. Next, we ordered their famous spaghetti with black truffle, the cheeseburger with foie gras and the fried chicken with waffle fries. While their fried chicken was pretty good, it wasn't anything amazing. However, their spaghetti and burger lived up to the hype - being rich in flavour and aroma, overall delicious. Overall, I definitely recommend this place for lunch/supper and especially for dates (beautiful decor). Great food for reasonable prices, pleasant staff and great service. Also, because this place is usually packed, I recommend making reservations!"

We did and as we waited for the food to arrive, the waiter said he made a mistake and the reservation was actually for right now. He squeezed us in a small table for 2 and we have to be very careful not to make the plates fall of our table since we ordered too much food. However, they wanted to make up for their mistake and inconvenience and offered us free desserts on the house. Now that's what I call attentive service. As the for the food, it's awesome. No other words needed. The black truffle spaghetti is so flavorful. It's prob my fave dish so far. The other dishes such as the bone marrow, escargot, salmon rillettes were also pretty good. The second time we went was for brunch. The benedict egg with salmon was pretty decent, but the sauce was a bit too sweet. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone.

I left greasy and bloated, but beaming.I had heard so many good things about their truffle spaghetti that it would have been wrong not to order it. In addition to the pasta we had the bone marrow, chicken liver pate, market veggies, cheeseburger and in yolo let's have a heart attack fashion we added extra foie gras in the burger.It was the perfect love child of French bistro meets greasy diner. The truffle spaghetti was salty, chewy, and everything you'd want to eat on a cheat day. The cheeseburger came with perfectly crispy fries- they also serve these next door at $3 a plate and are a must-have for late night munchies. The patty sandwiched between pillowy brioche buns was juicy and simply lovely (again, in an oily messy way). The foiegwa was nicely seared but was not particularly memorable.

/user_details?userid=QMeZrGPwIbQL8nKYOjhsrA,Claudia C.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"My boyfriend, brother, and I came here for a late brunch on Saturday. It was safe to say it was delicious. In spite, we were placed in an extremely squishy corner and the table was way too small for three people. It barley fit all the food we ordered. Keeping in mind, the restaurant itself isn't very large. The brunch menu is only served on Friday (10-3pm), Saturday & Sunday (9:30am-3:30pm). We ordered the Confit Duck Omelette $17, Rosti $17.75, and least but not last, grilled cheese slices dipped in 2 soft boiled eggs $12.95. Firstly, my boyfriend's Confit Duck Omelette meal which was filling but he would have preferred it more if there was more confit duck. I recommend La Avenue Restaurant for their Confit Duck Benedict. Meanwhile, my borther Rosti meal was delicious, but not as filling. The house cream was to die for. My brother was still a bit hungry after his meal and decided to have some of grilled cheese and potatoes. Overall the grilled cheese was good but I think I would have preferred it if they used poached eggs instead of soft boiled egg."

Methinks our Bocata friends (who recommended Foiegwa) phoned ahead to make sure we had a ""spirited"" evening .Foiegwa is a tight little corner hot spot that packs in patrons nightly so definitely make a reservation. The menu offerings are all the things they do well so any choice is a winner. But let me again emphasize how good the Truffle Spaghetti is! When every table has at least one order of this dish, your FOMO will be tears of regret if you don't get this dish. My dear daughter ordered the pasta bolognese and she loved it but if she could have devoured my dish after sampling a bite of my Truffle Spaghetti, she would. She is now back at college crying in her dorm thinking of the missed strands of spaghetti coated in buttery black truffle sauce, mixed with a newly broken egg yolk under a Mont Royal heap of freshly grated parmigiano reggiano cheese. Don't let this happen to you. It's over 2200 miles (over 3200 km) for us to get back to this Montreal hot spot. Get this dish if you ever have the opportunity to go.Bon appetite!"

Having read amazing reviews across the board we ordered the beef tartare and truffled green beans to start and the truffled spaghetti and beef bourguignon as the mains. To our (pleasant) surprise, the hostess remembered that we preferred to have our own table, and came to let us know that a cancellation had just come through which we really appreciated. After we moved to another table, the food started to come out. The appetizers were absolutely delicious, and the mains that shortly followed were equally yummy. Everything was PERFECT. Although it took quite some time for all the food to come out, you could tell that everything was made with love (as cheesy as that sounds) using great ingredients.The only one small negative was that my cocktail (Scarlett something) wasn't really very good but this isn't a big enough negative to knock any stars off. 5 stars for excellent food!"

There were plenty of clean tables and nobody was waiting; they don't take reservations. Whatever. We sat and ordered our food (and the Paris Brest milkshake. Soooooooo good). I ended up getting the eggs Benedict with ham and my girlfriend got the ham and cheese omelette. My eggs benny were amazing. The yolk was perfectly runny, the Hollandaise was nice and rich, and they served it alongside these amazing potatoes, a roasted tomato, and really good applesauce(?). My girlfriend's omelette was a bit too underdone and lacked flavor. It is pricy, especially for how much you get. But overall it is pretty good."

The egg Benedict is actually nice, I have tried the salmon Benedict and I would recommend that for breakfast. I tried the pancake too and loved it but I shared it with friends so I only had to have one pancake. I am not sure if I would love it the same if I had to eat all four pancakes. It's very greasy and unnervingly sweet. The staff is very friendly. Great ambience and super cute decor. A very Instagram friendly place. It's diner themed. The portions are HUGE !"
/user_details?userid=CtBx4yk_QM8ClITgw94TPQ,Simon P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I finally got to try foiegwa! I really enjoyed it. The decor is nice, the ambiance is pleasant, and more importantly the food is delicious.I kept hearing about the burger with the extra foie gras, so obviously I had to try it. It is indeed awesome. It's not the best burger I've had in my life however, which is what I was hoping for. At 27-28$, I fully expected to have my mind blown. What I got was a really good - no; an excellent burger with great meat, a good bun, and a hint of a taste of foie gras. The taste of the cheese was completely lost, and so is taste of foie gras.I think there's a better burger to be made with these quality ingredients. Maybe a different, tastier cheese, and perhaps a different cooking method for the foie gras so the taste is more pronounced. I think there were caramelized onions? I'm not sure. Maybe even a completely different burger with the same ingredients but without the sauce, and with salad, tomato, raw onions and cold foie gras. That could be exiting, I don't know. Oh and one more thing - my friend had the spaghetti. It looks awesome, and he described it as really good. He was a little disappointed by the size of the portion however. I get that truffle sauce is expensive, but pastas are not. It's not a valid reason to put 15 spaghettis on a plate and call it a main course.Nevertheless, I still recommend that you try this place at least once. I look forward to trying the spaghetti on a future visit actually.Yeah. It's good. Pricey though. The kinda place where beautiful yuppies go to be seen, and they overpay a little for that privilege.It's nice that their kitchen is open late, very convenient.I wish these was a bigger and better beer selection. The place looked like it would feel a bit crammed, but it's not that bad. We had a table by the window, it worked out for us 3 big men. Maybe if you have a small table for 2 in the middle by the bathroom it would probably feel a little bit more crammed. Anyway. The food is good. You should go."

The gazpacho was nice, especially the delicious brioche covered in crab meat that came with it. The vegetables with bagna cuda were great. We shared a fried chicken sandwich which came with honey they sourced from their roof top. It was tender juicy chicken that was barely breaded and went perfectly with the honey. The spot definitely has a cute diner theme. The staff was very friendly. Reasonably priced. I'd recommend for late night dining or any time."

I love the environment and they have a lot of seating for such a small space. I had the blueberry pancakes which were amazingly soft and my friend had their version of the croque madame which is a form of ham and cheese sandwich with egg. The portion sizes were fair and the service was friendly. I loved eating in the bright sunlight and enjoying a bit of the Atwater environment on my way to brunch! The cuisine is pretty standard for brunch and leans french. I would come back to try some of the other non-brunch food in the nice space. Come for the pics and stay for more food!
/user_details?userid=Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I loved the feel of this restaurant, relaxed and unassuming - and yet the food was absolutely on point! We didn't have reservations which meant we sat at the bar, and I actually enjoyed that vantage point because we got to see into the kitchen a bit. We shared the Bone Marrow ""snack"" to start, which was just large enough for us to have a few bites each. There was a bit of grated truffle on top and a velvety Bordelaise sauce which was divine. I was in the mood for a lighter main course, so I selected the Warm Ratatouille and Goat Cheese Tart. There was a selection of vegetables on a puff-pastry base, and there was a hint of balsamic vinegar if I'm not mistaken. The size was big enough as it was, but it also came with a green salad simply dressed with a vinaigrette. I enjoyed the freshness and simplicity of the dish. I also tried a bite of the Fried Chicken with Gribiche sauce, which was at once moist, crispy, and creamy from the sauce; a luscious mouthful. I can't wait to return and taste more of the menu (and check out the bar next door)."

It's set up to look like a dinner but the lights are slightly dimmed to cater to dressy attire as well. I noticed the theme applies to the food also, they serve some simplistic food but with an ""oomph"". We ordered tartare, snails, the cheese burger and spaghetti.Tartare- very good, if you like raw meat you can't go wrong.Snail- never tried them before and for a first experience I would say they were seasoned appropriate for their texture and made them quite enjoyable.Burger- we got it with extra foies gras. It's like a glorified cheese burger ... It had to be the most satisfying cheese burger I ever tasted. The foie gras adds to its fatty and greasy texture. Overall my favourite dish.Spaghetti- loved the buttery/creamy texture. The egg added to its delicious multitude of flavours."

/user_details?userid=Tdp-vTDHrfR2rQk2emDKiA,Alice B.,"Brooklyn, NY",1 star rating,"I decided to check this place out after reading the Yelp reviews on it, although I'm not sure I understand what the big deal is. My boyfriend and I came to eat here after showing up at Vin Papillon and realizing they were on holiday as it was just down the street.  We were seated immediately but it took nearly 20 minutes to order drinks, which took even longer to arrive, and 30 to order our meal and that didn't arrive in a decent amount of time, either. The menu is overpriced and the dishes are tiny.  Don't get me wrong -- I don't mind an expensive (read: fabulous) meal here or there (Toque! is fantastic and Parc restaurant might have the best raw fish I'll ever have) but for the lack of complexity in Foiegwa's dishes, the presentation, service, and portion sizes the $120 after a modest tip for a starter, one scant for two plate and two glasses of wine their pricing seemed absolutely absurd.  The Daumen Cote du Rhone was actually decent but it seemed most of their good wine picks were just grabbed from Oenopole's wine list, so there was really nothing new there for me.  Their deviled eggs were decent.  The aioli was okay.  They were cooked to perfection and had herring flakes and chives on top as a substitution for salt and to add to the complexity of the dish.  Regardless though, they were just some deviled eggs that tasted a little like fishy salt.  I've also seen this exact dish and presentation two other places before so in all honesty, it was actually quite boring.  When our dover sole fish with accompaniments arrived we were shocked to find the portions of the meal so tiny.  There was a pittance of rice and green beans.  The rice was drenched in butter and seemed to have tiny speckles of pepper in it and nothing else (of course Foiegwa described it as a pilaf on the menu..) and the green beans were undercooked and also slathered in butter.  I actually had trouble slicing through them with a knife in order to eat them.  The fish itself, while cooked to perfection, was also pretty boring and presented with no garnish other than the slightly yellowed sauce it was sitting in.  Of course this sauce was basically nothing more than.. (you guessed it) butter! Atmospherically, I do like the way Foiegwa was decorated.  It was really loud, however, and we were placed at a table that seemed to get bumped by the wait staff on numerous occasions.  I was sort of blown away at how loud it was in there given the music was actually being played at a minimal volume. All-in-all I definitely don't recommend this place.  They won't do a great job of waiting on you, nor feeding you.  Most likely, they will simply gouge your wallet without much of a 'why'.  While Foiegwa is the new face in town (most likely from the same owners as many others I suspect) they're going to have to try a little harder to earn their keep. If you hadn't gathered, I'll tell you anyways, I definitely won't be returning."

The name, as it implies, indicates that you can add foie gras to any dish for $9.95! Because I went for breakfast, I didn't try this. It's a relatively small place so going a little earlier would probably be best to avoid lines. My sister and I went at around 11:30 AM and got a spot right away, but the place was already pretty filled and it was a freezing cold day. I ordered the ham eggs benedict - a classic and always good. Next time I'd probably want to try the truffle spaghetti, it sounded amazing! My sister opted for something more original and got the roasted vegetables and goat cheese tart. It was very beautifully plated and quite delicious. This is definitely somewhere I'd want to try again!"

/user_details?userid=De3Yl24A7MUZvK40rP6RLg,Annie K.,"Medford, MA",5 star rating,"I was pleasantly surprised by this place!If you've ever heard someone call a restaurant an ""upscale diner"", this is the place they're talking about. The setting is very reminiscent of a Times Square NY diner, with caricatures on the walls, booths, and even milkshakes on the menu. The difference being - this place is super clean and very contemporary. To get the boring stuff out of the way first - the place is impeccably clean. It looked as if it had just opened for the first time that evening. The fixtures are a bright chrome, and the booths are a nice brown leather finish. The plants are bright and well placed, without being in the way.The staff is incredibly nice and accommodating. We came in as a large party that arrived in 2 waves, and they seated us in a booth in the corner with no problem. The hostess was very charming and nice. Our waiter was super funny and incredibly knowledgeable about the menu. Also of note, we had no french speakers in our party, and that was no problem as the staff did speak English as well as French.I ordered 2 cocktails. The Ponytail and the Cinco De Mayo. Both were quite delicious.  I'd recommend the Ponytail for anyone looking for a bright, citrusy cocktail, and the Cinco De Mayo for anyone who likes a drink with spice. The chili in that drink came through in a great way. I had a friend who got a boozy milkshake, and that was also excellent. The menu is a great variation between classic diner food and high end cuisine. You can get a bowl of black truffle pasta or a plate of fried chicken. Seeing that we came in for drinks and snacks, I ended up going with the chicken liver pate, which was delicious. We also tried the frog's legs, which had a great flavor.Of note: the bar is a bit small, so don't be surprised if you have to get a table - but the drinks and snacks will make that worth it. Overall this was a great experience, and I would certainly come here again. I would recommend this place for anyone looking for late night eats and a good cocktail."

We also got the deep-fried frog legs which were pretty good as well. Their spaghetti with the egg is also a must try! It was really good especially if you break the egg yolk first and mix it with the rest of your spaghetti. The mussels in the red sauce were also quite delicious. I'm not a super huge fan of French food since I find it too heavy for my taste but you should definitely come here at least once in your life!

The burger was tasty but it comes with a plate with jus on it so my bottom bun got pretty soggy, aside from that it was great!

/user_details?userid=IMbTPsOTTY5xs5VhHSm4mA,Louis G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Going to Foiegwa was an experience full of surprises. Surprise #1: this place that had been hyped as the new no-reservation restaurant actually does take reservations, and you'll want to have one lest you get turned away like the people who came in after us. Surprise #2: attentionate service. We were greeted by the friendliest host in my recent memory, who went above and beyond to accommodate our lack of reservation and make us feel welcome. In fact, we wish she had been our waitress, who while still friendly, wasn't as enthusiastic. In the only downside of our evening, as the restaurant got busier around 9pm, the speed of the service suffered.Surprise #3: for a restaurant opened in an old Belle Pro under the guise of selling heavy, decadent food, the food was actually quite refined and balanced. Yes, the food is rich and won't do your diet any good, but it's packed full of flavour and complexity - not just fat and salt. The burger was my favourite in a long time and the pasta with the truffle butter and egg was on point. Special shout-out to the soft serve ice cream with butter-fried peanuts - a must if you're not full after your meal. Surprise #4: the price. I thought there had been a mistake when we got our bill: 98$ tip included for a 3 course meal with cocktails for 2. Now I acknowledge this isn't necessarily cheap, but for the amount and quality of what we got, it's definitely great value. A few extras: -Portions are larger than they seem: a little goes a long way. We found that a snack and a main each were plenty. Those with smaller appetites could definitely be happy with 2 appetizers. -Fries: 100x better than the sad old Belle Pro that used to be there. -Cocktails: clean and simple. Nothing too fancy or over the top - go next door to ACC after your meal if you're looking for something more special."

Now onto Foiegwa: went very early for breakfast and the place was empty but it got packed around 11. Shared the blueberry ricotta pancakes and the smoked salmon on that wonderful potato hashbrownything. Perfect combo of salty and sweet. Ooooo And their coffee is realllly good.

The menu looked very exciting and delicious, the decor was fun yet classy, and the staff was sweet and courteous. But the big let down for me was the food; everything lacked nuance and flavor. Such interesting ingredient combinations should be celebrated, but I felt like everything on the plate was very one note and under seasoned. That isn't to say the meal wasn't nice, I just feel that there are more enticing places in the neighborhood. Maybe it was just an off night. I'm on the fence about whether or not I'll be back to give the kitchen a chance at redemption."

My boyfriend and I were visiting Montreal and read that Foiegwa was a must try. We forgot to make a reservation but were promptly sat by the host when we arrived on Saturday night. I wish I could recall her name because she was so friendly and attentive. She suggested the Atwater Market Vegetables appetizer and it was perfect pair to what would be a very dense meal. My boyfriend had the Cheeseburger w/ extra Foie Gras and I had the Truffle spaghetti. Lord have mercy on my soul because that Truffle spaghetti was d e l i c i o u s. I can't recommend this place enough -- if you're in Montreal head on over to Foiegwa and you will not regret it.

I didn't have much expectation beforehand since I found their menu quite limited in term of choices of dishes. Many people have been telling me how pricey the place is, and Instagram feeds showed me very typical brunch options (average plating too). However, when I got to try their dishes, especially the truffle butter spaghetti, it was like HEAVEN! It is very rich and creamy, the most phenomenal spaghetti I have ever tried! I also tried the blueberry pancake and that was just so so.The place is quite small and I can imagine that when it gets crowded in the weekend, the lineup can be crazy. Try to go during the week and it should be really okay. I find the restaurant very bright and cosy, but honestly, I find the place overpriced for their food and service. But remember to try the spaghetti! It's so good!"

The foie gras zucchini flowers was tiny dish with only three flowers and the bone marrow is definitely not worth it as you can barely see the marrow it's only about a teaspoon full. Cocktails are good and pretty strong

The fried chicken and waffle was an interesting combination of savory and sweet taste. Personally, the pancake was relatively less impressive. Service was good too. The server was super friendly.

Now, onto the important stuff...To start, we ordered the escargot (which I'm told might have actually been periwinkle) and the salmon rillette. The escargot was doused in butter and garlic, which I unashamedly sopped up with bread. The salmon rillette was served on endives which, in my opinion, allows you to appreciate the flavours way more than some crusty old cracker or toasted bread. For the mains, we ordered the blackened cod and the fried chicken. The cod was perfectly cooked and served in the most oozingly delicious beurre blanc. Honestly, if we were sitting in a dark corner I would have licked that plate clean. The fried chicken was crisp and tender and seasoned to perfection. If the chicken connoisseur ever tried it, he might put this in contention for the pengest munch. Plus, the garlic chips it comes served with... are you kidding me?! Whoever came up with this recipe needs to patent it, open a factory and start bagging those things. With the money they earn, they could run for politics on a pure chip platform. Soon, everyone on the planet will have tried those chips, and this person will be the most influential celebrity in the world. People will beg them for the recipe, but they'll never give it up. And one day when they pass away, the recipe will disappear with them, which will lead to a global crisis the lies of which we have never seen. Tragic."

The kitchen is not very big so they have a limited menu with a few all star dishes!!! Started out with a scarlet cocktail served in a beautiful glass and a good punch of orange! I already knew I wanted to try the beef tartare and the black truffle and butter spaghetti !!!! The beef tartare was very fresh probably came from Atwater Market across the street I would say it was good had some Parmesan cheese in it but nothing spectacular I rarely dislike the dish! As for the black truffle and butter spaghetti it was delicious but it was not strong enough the truffle part was a little weak. Overall really pleasant experience and good value for a nice night out but probably not a repeat as he menu doesn't have a ton of variety although would totally go back for brunch :)

My two friends and I went here last night for dinner and I made the reservation in advance. All was good...the food, the ambiance...until our waiter asked if we wanted dessert and another round of cocktails. We said yes and he proceeded to tell us the next group of guests are coming in 10 minutes and they're taking our table. We were like ok...we ordered the cocktails and dessert anyways and he gave us the bill right away. He came up two times after that to say ""we called them they should be here in 5 minutes"". I wasn't even done my cocktail and we barely got through our dessert and came up for the FOURTH time and said ""ok they're here you need to go"". WTF?! There was a small empty table next to us we would've been able to fit at....any decent restaurant would be like hey I'm so sorry but is it ok if we move you to this smaller table? The dessert is on us? Or not even that, just move us to a small table so we can finish the drinks and food we paid for. That's how you do it the classy way.

I make a killer buttermilk pancake recipe and no restaurant pancake has ever lived up to my homemade 'cakes, so I avoid ordering them at restaurants. But something about these pancakes called out to me so I ordered them... and they were just okay. They definitely weren't bad because you'd have to be a terrible cook to make bad pancakes. But they were just okay. Maybe they would have been better if they had come with more than a teaspoon of blueberries. On the plus side, they came with real maple syrup at no extra charge unlike most Ontario restaurants."

Blueberry pancakes ... super delish and comforting... kinda tasted like waffles and pancakes in one... definitely made with love! The scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage, baked tomatoe and apple sauce were also delish. As a teen, I used to go to la belle province which was located where foiegwa has now settled in. At first I was having a hard time accepting the change, because my childhood memory was all about stopping at la belle province before heading home.(things kids in the 80's&90's did) my bestie suggested that we meet at Foiegwa for Sunday brunch and I accepted to break the ice and have my first meal at Foiegwa... while waiting for my friend to arrive, I decided to have a mimosa (what better way to break the ice?) enjoyed every bit of it. The inside is sooo much different than what I remember it to be.. the layout is cute but from pictures I thought the new owners had preserved the larger space... anyways, they open at 10am for brunch Fridays-Sundays... luckily for us, I had arrived a little after they opened  and was able to secure seats for my friend and I by the bar. I would definitely return as the food was delish, service was prompt, pricing was reasonable, and most of all they served Mimosas!!!"

As for other things on the menu : i tried their signature  pasta, the cheese burger, the escargo with garlic butter sauce;  i would say are good, but not worth what you pay for it. The Steak Tartar, however is worth it and make sure to get it spicy if your into that. I love paying for good food and the experience of it, but at Foiegwa your left a little wondering if it was worth paying that much for what you ate. I would say it just really depends what you go for. The other thing i will have to point out is that there is  a major fly problem in this place - i've never had a high end dining experience and had to deal with flies before. Maybe invest in some bug spray ;)"
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"I finally tried Foiegwa after having heard so many great things about it and I loved it ! It's presented as a diner but the inside while still casual and relaxed is still a little bit fancy in its own way. Definitely make a reservation though especially on the weekend because there is limited seating inside and you definitely want to make sure you get to try this place ! Also because of the limited seating this isn't an ideal location for a group dinner especially without a reservation. Our server was very friendly and made sure to check on us frequently to make are we had everything we need and the hostess was very friendly and accommodating as well. And now we get to the good stuff ... THE FOOD:) The food quality here is way above that of a typical diner. We had the escargot to start and the cheeseburger and fries as the main meal. The escargot were big,  well cooked and very well seasoned ,  im not usually big on escargot but these were very well made. And now the cheese burger ! Anyone who knows me knows I LOVE a good burger and this burger I can safely say is now in my top 2 favourite burgers in the city !  It sounds like a simple item but everything about it hit the mark perfectly from the fresh bun to the perfectly cooked and seasoned burger patty and the melty gooey delicious cheese inside , to the onion Au jus they serve at the bottom that flavours the bottom bun. you can also get the cheeseburger with extra foie gras inside which adds a nice layer of richness to it. I've been dreaming about this burger since I had it :) The fries were great too , well seasoned and cooked perfectly. the cocktails were good too I had the scarlet and the Pimms cup both were very good but the Pimms cup was my favourite , it was refreshing and tasty! The only thing I would say they could improve on is the fact that it took a while for them to come and clear up empty dishes or cups (ex they brought our second cocktail but never cleared away the cup for the first). That being said that's a very small detail and I was very happy with my experience here and I can safely say I will definitely be going back !"

That gives you the opportunity to just walk around or just go grab a coffee at one of the surrounding cafes. We always her the classic breakfast which consists of eggs, sausage, bread and potatoes. And then we share the mother load of sugar; the blueberry and ricotta pancake (3). And that's what tops us off. We're always so full afterwards but it's so worth it. The service is great! We usually have the same 2-3 waiters. I must say, Eric is by far my favourite one! He's so social and kind. I always look for him when we go.

The dishes offer an array of Quebec '50s diner fare that has been thoughtfully reimagined for the modern palate. The homemade spaghetti with black truffle, parmesan and egg is the height of epicurean decadence. The chicken live pâté was perfectly balanced and well-portioned. The fried chicken was good but lacked zip and the accompanying dip could have been elevated with more assertive seasoning.

The space is actually quite small, but never feels cramped, and the servers move around the tables and tight spaces with grace and care. The vibes are on point. The service itself was amazing, pure and simple. Our server was a super cool French Canadian hipstery guy who clearly liked to have fun with his patrons. He was playful and witty and we had a good time. The food was well coursed out and everything tasted delicious. The kitchen is cranking out some classic French food with a bit of a twist, and they know what their doing back there. Don't even think about not getting a plate of their truffle spaghetti for the table.Food Breakdown:Starters: - French Onion Soup: a rather straightforward take on the classic. The broth itself had such a deep caramelized onion-y flavor, and the melted cheese on the broth soaked bread didn't suck either.- Beef Tartare: This was a lighter version of what I'm typically used to but the flavor was delicious. Savory and sweet. Crispy chips on top gave the tartare great texture and little dollops of truffle aioli gave it richness. Entrees: - Truffle Spaghetti with Egg Yolk: Quite simply one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. But the dish is deceptively simple--lots of butter, truffle, salt and pepper--and reminded me of the truffle pastas I eat in Italy, where the truffle doesn't ever overwhelm the dish but still has a strong presence. I almost licked my plate clean. The egg yolk gives the dish that addictive quality so you're still thinking about it long after you've left.- Fusili Bolognese: Now this might not be your typical Nonna's bolognese, but the meat sauce itself had no cream or milk to enrich it, and you could taste the red wine pretty strongly, so it felt like a pure version. This dish was very savory on the palate. I would've loved a dollop of mascarpone cheese to sort of combat the meatiness of the dish, but still a homerun."

/user_details?userid=KcZOGv_2fnDZyRTnfqD1FA,Antoine C.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Disappointed. We went to Foiegwa shortly after it opened seduced that we were by the idea of eating foie gras again. I took the burger with extra foie gras while my girlfriend took the foie gras hachis parmentier. While my burger was decently good, the piece of foie gras was so small that I barely noticed it was there... But I was the lucky one because my girlfriend didn't notice it at all in her meal. So much for advertising it and paying extra for it. Not sure we will give them another chance especially with the small room with lots of noise."

/user_details?userid=LN4ajhAiIshKkXJQhuh6uA,Kali E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Talk about GOOD FOOD! We came on a Monday and it was quite busy. Make sure to reserve to secure yourself a spot. I had the boeuf bourgignon which was TO DIE FOR. I felt like I was having a ""homey"" meal and it was so comforting for a cold day. The drinks were delicious and reminded me of the cocktails they serve in NYC. I would totally recommend this place for a girls night out, a birthday, or even a tinder date ;) haha! 5 STARS"

/user_details?userid=j3EziAd31sdMvU4ejyzNiQ,Jimmy L.,"Troy, NY",4 star rating,We had dinner there and the environment was nice. I ordered their special which was a filet salmon with mushrooms and goat cheese. Didn't like the goat cheese but the flavor was very strong.
/user_details?userid=E99XJ1oWeYEyPnkSJPoIQw,Shobana T.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I came here for brunch with friends for my first time...we had an array of dishes to try, I had the salmon eggs Benedict and was not impressed. It lacked freshness and flavour and had an overwhelming amount of hollandaise sauce. Although I did not have the chicken with waffles, it did looked very delicious and was told it was. The decor is very nice and trendy, great location however the service was terrible.  I asked for a spoon for my coffee from 3 people before I got one & everyone else at the table used their fork because they were tired of waiting. We also never had our water glasses refilled or were asked if we liked our meals after it was served. Waited over 20 mins for our receipts after our table was cleared. Perhaps brunch isn't their strong point - will have to return for dinner and maybe the service will be different."
/user_details?userid=Sp42UYEuooAF8xTesa86Dg,Justin A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I went for lunch with a group of co-workers and the food and cocktails were fantastic! I had their burger and it was one of the best I've had in Montreal. The bun, toppings, sauce, and beef were amazing. Their fries are crispy, perfectly salted, and seem almost addictive. The only issue was the service. The server forgot to bring an item for one of our party, and only brought out 1 small mayonnaise and 1 small ketchup even though 4 of us ordered fries. The waitstaff were nearly impossible to flag down - we tried to talk to them and even waved our arms as they walked by but they seemed obvious (and the restaurant was only half full). I suspect the poor service was due to the fact that the restaurant is so new and hopefully they'll improve after a few weeks.I also want to note that the restaurant is beautifully designed. It feels very trendy but welcoming.With a small tweak to the service standards, I think Foisgwa will do spectacularly well. I can see it quickly becoming a favorite lunch/dinner destination for me."
/user_details?userid=509RPj6ZT9ERkjVDr0X5tQ,Lesley B.,"Shoreline, WA",5 star rating,We were lucky enough to have a reservation made by our air bnb host (he had connections!)for the night we arrived in Montreal visiting Canada for the first time.  We were able to get fit in at 6:30 pm.  when we arrived we were promptly seated at a table for two in the small dining room that seats about 35.  We were expecting big things according to our host who advised us it was hard to get a reservation for dinner and usually the waiting list is very long... So we felt very excited to be there.  we were not disappointed! I must say it was the best fish I've ever eaten in my life... It was the chef's special of the night Fresh caught mild fish cooked to perfection with crisp skin with caviar on top placed upon a bed of fresh asparagus and a wonderful hollandaise sauce.  We also had the truffle spaghetti which was rich and decadent.  Our cocktails were very good as well!  We won't ever forget our first French dinner in Montreal!  The prices also  amazing too!

/user_details?userid=h4EhxuAabdYpg6e8dP0LDg,Emily M.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Review for brunch: my friends and I got the eggs benedicts, omelette and french toast. None of them were particularly outstanding but they were all pretty good. The omelettes came with tomatoes and potatoes, but they were each one ingredient which I though was a but lacklustre.The place is certainly very cute, and was quite busy. I've heard good things about their dinner, maybe brunch is just not their strongest point."

Their veggie appetizer is mouthwatering and the truffle spaghetti is delicious. Go to their little bar in the back alley afterwards called Atwater Cocktail Club.

Ironically, not at a lot of foie gras dishes. Slightly lack of imagination in the execution of their dishes. The ambiance is really cool though, worth going for drinks."

/user_details?userid=-VV1K0DXlsAgXXL9EhbdiA,Cindy L.,"Calgary, Canada",2 star rating,Just terrible service. Sorry. Food was okay but not worth it at all. Everyone's meal arrived well before mine and almost done eating when I finally got mine. Egg was overcooked on the tartare. Waited thirty minutes for our bill. A whole lot of hype for nothing.
/user_details?userid=LPJ7XGijee8Q2OBn1PmVmQ,Shira W.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Loved loved loved this restaurant. My absolute favorite dishes were the foi grois brioche bun - small but ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. The steak tartar was delicious but if you're not over 4 people I don't suggest getting the larger one, the small one will suffice. The frog legs were fun to eat and as I've never eaten frog before I am not a reputable source but I thought they were delicious; they were so tender. The onion soup was to die for. The burger with extra frois grois was good but the frois grois was chincy, they barely gave any; I wouldn't get it again, but hey, at least the fries were good! Lastly the truffle pasta was amazing, I highly suggest it + the service was superb... we'd ordered the fried chicken but 10 minutes in wanted to switch it for a burger and the sever told the kitchen and they stopped cooking the chicken and started with the burger. The food also came very quickly."

/user_details?userid=DWk2VHG3sxCCKcrn4CZIrQ,Jason H.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Best meal we had in Montreal by far. Basically tripped over this place. We had a resi at Joe Beef's sister restaurant (Liverpool), were checking out the Atwater market and were staying around the corner and walked by Foiegwa a few times as a result. It's a v cool looking place and we decided to google/check it out and were really intrigued. Called for a resi and they said they couldn't give us a table for three but at 6-6:30 we could walk in. At 6:30 walked in and were offered seats in a bar area (WARNING: They will tell you half of the restaurant is kept open for walk-ins but it is 100% bar seats. Based on my horrible, shitastic, want to commit murder-suicide experience with Foxy, which is terrible for many other reasons, this might just be a French Canadian troglodyte norm, but regular people may be surprised, especially if there are two four tops that sit empty for three plus hours while you sit watching friends of the chef walk in and take shots . . .) Suffice it to say I was kind of irked when I walked in but the food (really solid escargot, grenouille and green salad and some of the best croque Monsieur and steak frites I've ever had (pretty big sample) and really great service really won me over. We can't wait to go back."
