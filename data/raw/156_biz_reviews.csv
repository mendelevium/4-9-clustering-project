The food was good but I would definitely suggest ordering a lot if you're hungry. We tried a bit of a lot of things, the ribs and salmon were very good. Nothing else really stuck out to me papaya salad, chicken satay, and pork belly bbq were all good choices. I love a good themed cocktail list and this did not disappoint. Everyone was very happy with their drinks and the playlist was so good!I would definitely give it another try and order more but it was a fun place to go out for a bite with a group."
/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The food and atmosphere at this restaurant is great! The staff are all very friendly and always around to answer any questions or to clear up finished dishes. The restaurant is tapas style so it is suggested to order between 2-3 dishes per person. I would suggest requesting that all dishes are served relatively apart from each other as they do come out very quickly. I am certain that all the food is fresh as their kitchen is ""open-style"". So the dishes do just come out rather quick. We had to inform our waitress if they could slow down the serving (also caused us to feel as though we were being sort of rushed out, but I don't think it was the case). As for the actual food, it is really authentic. For someone who has travelled to southeast Asia before, tasting each dish brought back so many memories. The one exception was the spice level. There was none whatsoever. If you do want a genuine southeast Asian experience, request that your dishes are served spicy. Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a date night or a night to go out with friends. It is the perfect restaurant for groups (4-6 people), as you'll be able to try almost all their dishes."

It's got a pretty laidback vibe to it, with red neon and a lovely selection of cocktails and mocktails to get the evening going. I had a matcha lemonade which was lovely. As a Vietnamese pub they offer quintessential dishes such as spring and imperial rolls (my favorite are the vegetarian) as well as wontons, salads and grilled meats. I highly recommend ending your meal on a fried banana. The service is friendly and the prices very reasonable."
/user_details?userid=_qXAML1zdrHe8vgE4dPymg,Katty T.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Cool retro vibe - like something you would sit in Saigon in the 70s with authentic Vit food with a twist, just that portions are small more like tapas but prices were expensive that would equal an entree. Workers are not Vit.  We ordered about 1/2 their menu but next time we would order less. Definitely try: salmon in coconut sauce, braised ribs, snails in spicy sauce, Can skip: Brodard grilled pork rolls, clams in coconut sauce,"
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Charming and vibrant Vietnamese restaurant. Not your typical hole in the wall in China town... It's tapas style so you get to taste a bunch of yummy Vietnamese creations.I had the papaya salad served in bag just like in Thailand  which was really yummy. Their grilled beef was AMAZING! If you eat beef you MUST order it.Their spring rolls too are really good. I will definitely go back!
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Le Red Tiger has been on my list to try over the past year or two. Finally made it out on a Monday evening, our last stop of the night. The place is cool and hip. Pretty busy for a Monday, can only imagine how bumping it is on a weekend. We grabbed seats at the bar. Love the sliding garage door; perfect for a summer's night. Music was great with mainly 80's hits.Menu has some excellent, hard to find Vietnamese dishes. Wish I could had tried the sea snails, bo kho and egg fetus (never tried this before!). Super reasonable prices. - Me love you long time - price depends on what type of alcohol you choose but it's tequila or mezcal with watermelon, Thai basil, ginger syrup and lime juice. Wasn't a strong drink. Bartender came back and asked how it was. Cbear didn't like it; he ended up not charging us for the drink (we weren't expecting that) but that a nice touch. Excellent service!- Chardonnay ($8.00)- Red tiger ($6.00) - light, easy drinking beer. They have this beer all over Asia. - Bo la lot ($10.00) - don't see these very often. Mix of beef and pork wrapped in betel leaves. Tasty but a tad salty. - Banh kot ($12.00) - pork and shrimp mini crepes. They top it off with coconut milk (Cbear wasn't a fan) but I thought they were delicious. Add the lettuce and herbs then dip into the fish sauce.Definitely would come back to try more of their food! Perfect for late night sharing."
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We were 10 people without a reservation on a Friday night at 8:30 pm and the staff greeted us friendly and informed us if we waited 20 minutes they would clear the back tables and we could be seated. Sure enough, 15 minutes later we were seated, which we all really appreciated! Very friendly and energetic staff, service was great. The food was a bit disappointing, the dishes were not bad they just weren't great. The vegetarian and chicken imperial rolls, the fried wonton's and the Banh were ok. I'm pretty sure its just frozen food that they fry and reheat. The best dish was the braised pork ribs with 5 spices, very good! I also ordered the -taya cocktail, which was awesome. It was strong, sweet and had lots of great flavours. I think this place is good to get some drinks and share a dish but I think they should step up their food game a bit."

I've tried a few of their drinks and was never disappointed. The food is good and fun, not your typical Vietnamese joint which is also a very good thing once in a while. I have been back many times and would still go back :)"
/user_details?userid=lLF9x4I41LFFKa_FX-lkbQ,Jedsada Y.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",1 star rating,"I love the cool concept and all, but the execution fell short. I've been wanting to check Le Red Tiger every time I visit Montréal, but that's what happened when you have high expectations for something. Vietnamese food on the menu looks pretty legit, but if an Asian person had trouble eating the snails, I don't think, non-Asians would even bother eating them. It was impossible to get the snail meat out of many of them with the provided toothpicks. I've eaten snails before at other restaurants and they were always easier to remove the meat!We ordered Chicken Wings, Snails, Beef and Pork Wrapped in Betel Leave, sticky rice with shredded pork, sausage, etc and chicken and shrimp imperial roll. Chicken wings were good, albeit a little tiny for the price. The beef and pork betel leafs were ok, not great. The sticky rice dish was a heaping mess of different meats. It would be better to separate everything to make it nicer presentation and easier to assemble a tasty bite.I had indigestion and vomited on the same night. Service was a little lackluster as our waiter tried to force us to take the wrong order from own mistake. We were strongly encouraged to take the vegetarian imperial roll that he put in by mistake instead of the chicken and shrimp roll which he claimed after the fact was sold out....so why didn't you give me the option to change before you cooked something I didn't order??? It was boring and tasteless. Needless to say I would never recommend this restaurant nor would I eat here ever again."
/user_details?userid=3SfiqyTQO8gP8z6XA1ekpQ,Garseng W.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"A tapas-style Vietnamese place near the Gay Village. The restaurant has a mix of seating, with standard tables, long high top tables, and a counter facing the kitchen, which is where we sat. The place takes reservations, which I would recommend if you don't want to wait, though we were lucky to be seated within 5 minutes of arriving without one.The menu consists of small plates, and they recommend you order 2-3 dishes per person for a filling meal. We ordered the following:1. Vermicelli with pork meatballs - basically two slider-size hamburger patties on a bed of rice noodles with shaved carrot and cucumber slices. It was pretty good, fairly light and good, not very stand-out. 2. Imperial rolls (2) with pork, chicken, and shrimp - very crispy and fragrant.3. 5 spice braised pork ribs - the best dish we chose. ~6 good-sized ribs braised in a very bold and flavorful 4. Banh pancakes - 6 egg-custard-like bites that you top with cucumber and carrot and dip in a light vinegar sauce. The ""pancakes"" were notably creamy, but it was overall light on flavor.5. Rice cakes with egg and taro - accompanied by a soy-based sauce for dipping. Pretty standard and what you'd expect from the title, also good but not a stand-out.Overall, the food was fairly standard. The staff were incredibly friendly. I'm glad I came to try it.--Rating Rubric--5* - As good as it gets; goes above and beyond. I would come here again and again!4* - Worth checking out; a good value. No major complaints or only minor flaws that set this place back. I'm glad I tried it, but I might not come back here in lieu of trying somewhere new.3* - A few setbacks that soured the experience. Not the worst, but I wouldn't recommend it to friends.2* - Multiple setbacks that made me dislike the place.1* - I was personally offended by the people or services. Steer clear!"
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Maybe I'm just a diva when it comes to my Vietnamese food but this kinda fell flat for me. The first time we tried to visit Red Tigre they weren't able to seat us before an hour. The long wait makes sense- these guys can't flip tables FOR BEANS: the visit where we got bar seats it took the better part of an hour to settle up.The food was pretty meh. As Anny said, the portions are pretty small and rather pricey for nothing exceptionally tasty. The spring and imperial rolls, despite the plating, really tasted like they do anywhere else. Where things were ok, at least for me, was the music (mom-jean jams all night!), the space (minimally creative but cute enough), and the beer- they have a delicious partnership with Harricana where they have a Red Tigre-specific beer.I'm sticking to my mom and pop Vietnamese places but I guess if you're dead-set on a hip pub atmosphere, this place is worth a crack."
/user_details?userid=7iZOLfdpS_iRYLR7hi6hPg,Cole S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow the food at this place really blew me away! Ordered a whole bunch of small things that I had never heard of before and every single dish was delicious and I spent my entire time chewing going ""Mmmmmm!"" ""Ohhhh?"" Because I didn't even recognize some of the flavours I was experiencing. Really great selection of delicious cocktails too. I had the "" Me love you long time"" (Daring cocktail name in this, The age of outrage, that we live in) it was really yummy and just what I wanted. Highly highly recommended. Can't wait to go back!"
/user_details?userid=IPsKAiMjFj39dN_ckOsMMg,Jamie N.,"Costa Mesa, CA",5 star rating,"After exploring St Joseph Oratory in Mount Royal and Notre Dame Basilica in Old Montreal, we headed to Le Red Tiger near Quartier Latin off Beaudry station for some Vietnamese food. Popularly known for their tapas style fare, I was curious about their lunch menu. We arrived on location with bustling construction at its entrance, but they were still operating as usual.We seated ourselves at one of the communal tables and reviewed their menu. Options are pretty limited during lunch, so we decided to share a few items. To quench our thirst, my friend had the mango juice while I tried their matcha lemonade. The drinks actually arrived a bit later since their ice machine was broken that day, but it wasn't too long of a wait until ice arrived. The matcha lemonade was tasty and refreshing, the perfect beverage for a hot summer day.To start, we got the green papaya salad with beef jerky. The salad comes out in a plastic bag where you get to ""toss"" the salad however you like. Once it was mixed to our preference, spritzed a bit of lime juice and added the chili pepper on the side. Pretty good, but I thought it could have used more basil! The sauce (or dressing) is relatively light, so it was quite refreshing as a starter.For our main, we ordered the rice combo plate with chargrilled pork sausage. Served with a scoop of rice, vegetables and an eggroll, it was an easy portion to share. Fish sauce is incredibly light though and didn't deliver that punch of flavor I have back at home. Since I was still hungry, my friend and I shared the chargrilled pork spring rolls. It's one giant roll cut in half, but it was stuffed with basil, vegetables and a crunchy middle. They definitely did not skimp on herbs in this one. I debated on ordering another one for the road, but the food was starting to settle so we made our way out before the coma hit.Overall, it was enjoyable to come through. I would have preferred to hit this spot up at night since their tapas menu appears a bit more expansive, but for what we got, it was great!"
/user_details?userid=Zr535e3501Ygs4hO5hO05Q,Mimi V.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This is the first 5/5 review I'm giving on Yelp.I've been to Vietnam five times in my life, and this is the very first time a Vietnamese restaurant (outside of Vietnam) has impressed me so much. The food tastes very fresh and along with the cocktails, they were refreshing. I went with a group of seven, made resos online. We shared a ton of plates as it's very tapas style. Their beef carpaccio, bot chien, and papaya salad were so good. Every plate we tried reminded me of the food I had in Vietnam.I'm so glad this restaurant covered different types of Vietnamese food and it was cool to see my friends learn a lot more about our food besides the standard pho bowls we are notoriously known for.From the impeccable service to the welcoming interiors, Le Red Tiger absolutely impressed me so much. As a Vietnamese, I highly recommend this place whether you live here or are travelling, come eat here asap!!!Easy to find street parking around here and it is a little on the pricier side so it's more worthwhile to go with a huge party, that way you can try everything like we did!"
/user_details?userid=8HafK5cS8pWCWNQTIG8iJw,Uyen D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"An unpretentious, casual restaurant-bar with terrific food. I've been here a few times and after sampling a good portion of the menu I can attest that the food does live up to the hype!My favorite dish was the mini pancakes (banh khot). I was sitting at the bar yesterday and was mesmerized by how much care the chef put in making them. He patiently pampered them until they were crispy all around yet bouncy on the inside. The pancakes were topped with a mixture of ground pork and shrimp and sweetened with coconut milk. They were then ready to be dunk in a homemade fish sauce; a real treat! You get six mini pancakes in one portion; I shared everything tapas-style but I could have easily finished the plate on my own.Another highlight was the beef carpaccio. In contrast with its Italian counterpart, the Vietnamese version is really heavy on the lime juice (which I love). There's also no raw egg in this version, just a lot of crispy fried shallots and peanuts. Red Tiger offers spring rolls rolled in square (pretty cool!) rice paper and filled with either a shrimp or pork sausage, or tofu. I tried the non-vegetarian options and liked it, but wasn't wowed by it. The addition of what seemed to be fried egg wrapping paper was a nice touch since it added dimension to the roll, though. If you are craving meat, I'd definitely recommend ordering the fried chicken wings or skewers. They are a must!My only complaint would be that the cocktails, while good, seemed watered down and didn't deliver the same punch as the food.Overall, it's a good place to come to if you want to dance to 80-90's music on your bar stool and indulge in a type of cuisine we rarely come across in Montreal. It's open late too, which is always a plus!"

The papaya salad was the best thing we ordered, but we've definitely had better. The pork ribs were extremely salty, almost inedible. The spring rolls were bland (the pork jerky has no taste to it whatsoever, spam would have been better). The pancakes? Take that off your menu, it was disgusting. We could tell servers were a bit short staffed and they were working really hard so we can't really complain about the service, but it wasn't great. Overall, we are from Chicago and this was our first meal in Montreal and we were thoroughly disappointed."
/user_details?userid=6yTV_iirY6r21EeTRGPGqA,Jolie C.V. H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"They have a small menu but when I got there, they didn't have any choices in the soup dishes.  So I opted for the papaya salad. O M F G. This dish is a REQUIREMENT. You cannot leave Montreal without ordering this dish. It is the best I've ever had...and my family is from Southeast Asia!  I like that it is presented in a plastic bag. Very authentic street vendor style, but not very eco-friendly, guys.  The bag was a necessity on the streets, but not here. Need to rethink that one.  Plus it's not very manageable trying not to get fish sauce on your hands.  Trust me you don't want fish sauce on your hands.  So just dump it out on the small metal plate they bring your plastic bag on.  The beef jerk was actually tender and delicious. Everything was just magical. So glad I stopped in for a quick bite.  Do yourself a favor...you have not had papaya salad until you've had it here."

The ambiance is wonderful and the service is very friendly. The food blew me away because I was so happy to see so many classic Vietnamese staples that weren't Pho! The food elevates traditional Vietnamese dishes to the next level! Our favorites were the wings and the ribs. My boyfriend and I literally stared at each other with our jaws dropped because we couldn't believe how good the ribs tasted. I adore Vietnamese food and this place elevates classic Vietnamese staples to something insanely delicious and unique. The drinks are were refreshing and fun.

The restaurant was half empty, yet the server turned us away saying that children were not allowed in the restaurant.  Why do you have a morning/lunch shift , yet not allow parents with children to come to the restaurant. Makes no sense. Hope the half empty crowd is able to support the cost of opening the lunch shift. If not maybe consider changing your policy. But maybe it's too late and you've already developed a non children friendly reputation.Avoid any visits with children."
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Hello dear readers,Life has conspired (in a positive way) to slow down the frequency of my posts but never fear we are still here! Kidding aside, my visits to restaurants have slowed down somewhat but I will continue to post reviews once I get a opportunity to try something new. On this occasion, we head to the Village where I had the chance (a few months ago I must admit) to try Le Red Tiger - a Vietnamese pub whose success has allowed the owners to expand further in the neighbourhood with Le Blossom and Kamehameha Snack Bar.We arrived on a busy Friday night to a full room including a bachelorette party in the back. The space is very reminiscent in layout to an old bar or diner - long and narrow with the bar being most prominent along almost the whole length of the space. There is even a old school type checker board tile floor to evoke that feel. Otherwise the space is pretty unremarkable visually. We grabbed a few seats at the bar and checked out the drink menu.An interesting mix of cocktails are available. I decided to go with the Bà Den Lemonade - Bulleit bourbon, amaretto, organic apple juice, oolong tea and vanilla syrup, lemon juice and mint. Cool presentation using tin spice and tea boxes. Flavour-wise, there is a nice balance between the sweetness of amaretto and juice with the smokiness of the bourbon. Very enjoyable.On the food side of the things, Le Red Tiger is all about Vietnamese street food - lots of grilled or fried items in small portions designed to share. Feels very similar to an Imadake but with very clear Vietnamese influences. First up, beef carpaccio Vietnamese style with shrimp chips. Very tender and flavourful beef with strong notes of lime juice and some pepper heat. We also ordered a side of seasoned fried peanuts with pair with that. I liked the extra crunch that came with frying them and the saltiness matched up with the acidity of the carpaccio.I had heard very good things about the chicken wings so of course I ordered some. Le Red Tiger fries them and served them with traditional Nuoc Mam sauce (fish sauce, lime, sugar and water). I loved the crunch that frying wings provided over the baked equivalent. The wings were nice and flavourful - a good mix of sweetness and heat. The sauce made them very sticky so not the cleanest dish to eat but they are chicken wings so of course they would be messy!The coconut chicken satay skewers were excellent - great grill on the chicken and the little sauce on the side provided a nice sweet note. They arrived with the mini viet pork and shrimp pancakes. Very interesting dish that I had never heard before. The creamy sauce made the dish heavier that anything else we ordered despite the fluffy texture of the ""pancakes"". The last dish before dessert was the chicken imperial rolls. Nice crunch and good flavour.And then finally for dessert, sticky rice with mango and coconut milk. Very generous portion. Strong notes from the coconut but the mango softened it a bit. Le Red Tiger was a fun and enjoyable experience. It is always fun to experience a different type of cuisine. You can easily see how Le Red Tiger has been able to establish itself so well in the Village. Definitely worth a return visit!Cheers!"

I was very happy that I dined here because the experience was very unique. I seated at the bar so I could watch the cooks while they prepared the dishes. The crew was well orchestrated and in sync which is a good sign for a kitchen. Also, they were all very young and they seemed to do their job well. All in all, I was very impressed with their kitchen crew and front staff. It's a different kind of dinning than a traditional restaurant. So, order a bunch and share with your guests. The dishes won't show up at the same time. The dishes take a bit of time, so chat and enjoy the evening with your friends over wine or beer. The crowd tends to be young and hip.It felt like they were doing something new and they were doing it right. It's rare to find a place like this. I'd definitely dine here again. When you're in Montreal, skip the long lines at other places and dine here instead. You will remember this experience."

I think its important to be able to criticize as well as complimenting; how else would you expect a business to get better without reviews? Red tiger's decoration is not your typical fob vietnamese pub/restaurant. Its very retro and well targeted for its location- not fancy but has a twist of hispter vibe.The staff there are very friendly and make sure your food and drinks are always at your satisfaction- they genuinely want to know your opinion! Portions are not 'chinatown' size. You should expect 9-12$ tapas (from what i can remember).My boyfriend and i came there to celebrate my birthday and we've ordered pretty much everything on the menu. I would say the flavors are really on point and doesn't necessarily taste 'westernize'; they also serve balut! My favorite dish would be the beef carpaccio, i would rate 5 stars for that dish. I live 30mins away from this restaurant, and i would drive back for that dish. The drinks are yummy, and definitely not 'weak'- you can actually taste the alcohol. Unlike SOME other places where you just taste the juice- sorry, i didnt pay 12$ for juice. So dont worry, drinks are yummy and make sure Jeremy (i think thats his name?) makes your drinks! This is a pub/restaurant but later in the night everyone just hangs out at the bar and drinks all night.Overall i am impressed with this restaurant considering who they are targeting. The flavors are accurate and on point. The drinks are strong. The vibe is chill. I'll definitely bring my friends there and throw a party."

Make reservations especially on Friday and Saturday nights or you might be waiting a long time for a table. This is for when you get tired of pho. I think my party tried about 7 or 8 different dishes. You need about 2-3 per person, which I originally thought would be too much but actually just right. Definitely order the fried pork and shrimp wonton. Also the fried pancake that your wrap in leaves is excellent. Cocktails are very good too. Nguyen cup and the me love you long time are great."

I mean, who would actually offer balut on their menu? That takes guts to do so! Props to them!!! My mom will be visiting next week and we'll be coming back for sure!

We had anticipated a wait but we didn't realize how PACKED this place was going to be! That was fine, we showed up and waited despite making a reservation but it was a busy night so we didn't think of it as a big deal. Nonetheless, we were seated within twenty five minutes or so. We got some menus, ordered some 6-8 different items to split among four people and honestly.... it was all amazing. My mom, the most annoying person ever to take out to eat because of her pickiness and aversion to EVERYTHING, loved everything that she ate!Mind you, it doesn't help that that she's Cambodian and a lot of Viet and Khmer cooking share similarities but I digress. I'm sorry to say that I don't remember specifically what we ordered as it's been almost ten months but I do remember loving everything we haphazardly picked. It also brought back many memories as my sister and I usually don't get our mom's cooking anymore, or at least certain recipes, and we were ableto try them again here. Biting into something that you vaguely remember tasting and then having that familiarity hit you all at once... The feels, man, the feels. Also really digged how I was nomming on Southeast Asian bites with my mom and having Ciara's One, Two Step blare throughout a jam-packed restaurant and I sincerely mean that."

/user_details?userid=LN4ajhAiIshKkXJQhuh6uA,Kali E.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Love this place!  Super trendy and great ambiance. Make sure to reserve as the restaurant is not the biggest place. Their cocktail menu has great options (that are all so gooooood!) and it's fun to see that the cocktails each have fun names referring back to vietnamese culture  The food menu is a sharing menu you can split with your friends. Decently priced and so yummy! I recommend the papaya salad and their skewers! Yum. The atmosphere is upbeat and a great place to catch up with friends or to go on a date night with your s/o. They recently announced that on Saturdays they will remain open till 3am so that's a big win! RECOMMEND!

It looks quite hip from the outside. Go inside and you'll become a hipster too. Fortunately it doesn't stop there. The service and and the food are just as nice as the restaurant's interior design. I'm not giving it 5 stars mainly because the choice of vegetarian dishes is very limited. We got the Pate de Riz et Taro aux Oeufs and the Tofu on Tomato Sauce, both $8, accompanied by a bowl of white rice for $3. As a starter we shared the Rouleaux de Printemps which we thought would be deep fried spring rolls but they were actually what I know as summer rolls that are wrapped in rice paper. I'm embarrassed =( I thought I knew my rolls. Anyhow - everything was delicious! The ingredients were crispy fresh and the flavors were perfectly put together. I'd come again =)"

Then again, what else do you expect when the food is  not only authentic but also unbelievably good. The dishes are chock-full of flavor thanks to the many herbs and spices that are used. I highly recommend the papaya salad with beef jerky - this is not your run of the mill papaya salad,trust me! The beef skewers with lemongrass and the beef tartare are a MUST! Also,whatever you do, please leave room for deserts, you won't regret it.The drinks are really worth it, they don't skimp on the booze which is refreshing in a city where most of the drinks are watered down (seriously what is wrong with the alcohol dosage in montreal!).

I came with my boyfriend on a Saturday night we didn't have reservations but we were able to get a seat at the bar. All the dishes we ordered were very authentic tasting and flavorful. We ordered the bo tai chanh (raw beef salad), ribs, mini shrimp and pork pancakes, fish sauce wings, pho broth spring rolls, beef and pork skewers and sticky rice with mango and coconut. Out of all the dishes I really enjoyed the pho spring rolls with the broth, the broth was very delicious and it's a unique dish that I have never seen before. Also for the raw beef salad they are very generous with the beef. I am Vietnamese and I can say the food here was excellent they did not try to hide real Vietnamese flavors at all, everything was on point. Overall, I love the vibe and ambiance it's a chill place to grab a drink and little dishes with friends. Would highly recommend this restaurant!"

We weren't impressed by the food either. I had the fried wontons.. you get about 4 measly pieces for 6$. The ""sticky rice"" dish hardly had any rice in it. The snails took such hard work to eat and were super greasy.. it was a difficult time Lol. For drinks, I tried the ""Me Love you Long Time"" drink that has fresh watermelon in it which was tasty. FYI The place is really loud at night (full of people and music is blasting) but I was still able to maintain a conversation without screaming.

/user_details?userid=A7YlcidsiAZzU-tCSsrTSg,Anny T.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I came here with my start up team because we wanted to go for Vietnamese food, and my friend had recommended me to try Red Tiger. I saw the food pics on Yelp and was sold! I've called in advance for a table of 5 at 7pm, and fortunately, they were really accommodating. Good: The interior was casual and inviting. The food was decent, but nothing out of the ordinary for me. I think the effort was there, they served the papaya salads in a bag, which is like street food style in Vietnam. Bad: The portions were much to small for my liking (this is why I dislike tapas restaurants/bars). I felt more and more ripped off with every plate that arrived at my table, because the food taste no more different than the traditional Vietnamese restaurants I go to, for half the price. I felt like I was paying double the price for half the portion. Our bill came out to nearly $200 for 5 people (if my Vietnamese dad finds out, I can just imagine him shaking his head in disbelief.)Our waitress then comes to tell us that we have to leave soon for a large table coming in at 9pm. This is something that should've been mentioned earlier, not 15 minutes before expecting another group. We had to let her know that some of our dishes haven't even arrived yet, which she later punched in the order. At one point, I even had to ask another waiter if our order is on it's way because it took a bit long. The staff was very friendly, but also seemed a bit disorganized. Bottom Line: Cool looking place, decent food, overall sub par experience, but I don't think I'd go back."

The place is lovely and open during the summer.As for drinks, I found them a bit pricy although very good.The only problem I have with the place is that taxes are not included in the prices. So, let's say 13$ for a drink is the most I would normally pay for a cocktail. Add tax + tip and you're paying 16 bucks for ONE drink. Ouch. I'll be back for sure but sticking to beer next time."

Been there so many times and I have never been disappointed! I grew up in a Vietnamese-Chinese household so a lot of these dishes remind me of home and my upbringing. Decor and atmosphere : it uses a lot of stuff that reminds you of Vietnamese street food stands such as the chopsticks and old cans as utensils holders on the table. You can definitely feel the Viet vibes through the wall decor as well and the neon lighting above the bar. Love the open kitchen concept. However it can get very loud later in the evening. Service: yes yes, the partners of this restaurant are hipster Vietnamese guys but don't be fooled! The service is great. No one being uptight or judgy. They explain to you the tapas system and food when you ask them. Food: my favourite category. A lot of flavour and authentic as well. If I could, I would lick the plates clean. Okay fine! You guys caught me! I may have used my finger to clean the plate once. Or twice. Yes, it's that good. My favourite dishes are the snails, the raw beef salad, the mini crepes, the spring rolls. I haven't tried the pho spring roll but whoever orders that will never be my friend. That's a blasphemy. Drinks: very tasty and refreshing. I appreciate it when they give you a list of different liquor they have. For example if you order a gin based drink, they let you choose which gin to add in your drink. I know you can do that at any bar but it's just a nice touch. The cute names don't hurt either.Just go, trust me."

Honestly, evrything we had was amazing. The only thing that was disapointing was the white rice, which was a bit too watery. Score: 4.5/5Drinks: The Red Tiger had a drink menu created just for them. Every drink is very original and has an asian twist. The names are also very original. If you are not too sure what to drink, the barman will be more than happy to counsel you. Score: 5/5Ambiance: The restaurant is really small, but has a nice athmosphere to it. Some of the dishes are served in plastic bags, such as the salad, which gives a street food ambiance. The owners decided to destroy one of the walls to install a glass door that can be lifted up, which is really nice.

The crepes are something i've never seen before and i really like it ($12 only and you're already half-full)! The cocktail is a bit more pricy but really good, too. The only downside is how cold it is near the entrance, but i feel the owner has already tried its best by installing heavy-duty curtains and extra heating fans.

/user_details?userid=m0_W4iHkNZddR0msFtXI4w,Winncie L.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"Excellent food. The flavors are on the sweet side but since I like sweet, it was all very delicious. I particularly liked the sweet potato and shrimp fritters. It was crunchy, with a really well balanced hot mayo sauce. I also enjoyed the pho beef spring roll. It was basically a spring roll cut in three pieces, served in a bowl with pho soup at the bottom. An interesting twist and again there was a crunchy element in it, which I liked a lot. The hip retro decor is nice, very friendly service. The drinks were good also, I had the taya (a drink with pitaya though i didn't see any pitaya pieces in it). I saw some adventurous items on the menu such as stir fried escargot and conch brochettes, maybe I'll try them next time."
/user_details?userid=VXbi8ndacawnd6kidQF8dw,Marie P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Ok. So I rarely give 5 stars. When I do it's because I feel all the elements I'm looking for in a great restaurant experience are reunited: food quality, discovery, service, grounded-none flashy-snobby place, ambiance and of course prices. I found all of that at Ted Tiger. We sat at the bar. Our waiter was really nice and friendly. He recommended dishes to share and made us taste the wine before you pick the one we wanted. The menu is short but very interesting. The food is fresh and well presented, without ""flafla"". The quantities of food is perfect for tapas. The wine list is really short but for my taste they still had at least 2 good choices. The ambiance is just casual, cool. Really good vibe. I'll be back for sure!!!"

And be ready to get kicked out after 2 hours even if you are a group of 10 people and it took them an hour to start serving your dishes. They won't offer dessert and will not let you finish your drink. You are out before you are ready to be. Don't go."

I had the chicken satay skewers, the Vietnamese shrimp pancakes and the flan, they were all amazing. Nice vibe, the idea is that you get drinks and have a bunch of small sized portions and taste a bit of everything. Very busy place on weekends, reservations recommended."

/user_details?userid=-7_uN21MopVXLcnolSIk8Q,Eric L.,"Washington, DC",3 star rating,"Although I enjoyed the food, the service prevents me from giving this restaurant a five-star review.  This is a popular restaurant, but they did not have enough staff to handle the business.  As a result, orders were late or forgotten.  Drink orders were taken, but they were not served until the meal was over.  I understand that they were busy, but no one likes to feel ignored.  That said, the food was good enough to give it another try, especially given the largely unremarkable choices in the area."
/user_details?userid=a_WQp4FhgfJwWh-JaNXNZg,Amanda M.,"Pointe-Claire, Canada",3 star rating,"I was looking forward to trying Red Tiger for a while. I love Vietnamese food and was looking to try a different take on the cuisine (as opposed to the typical pho place - although dont get me wrong I love pho lol). I decided with my friends to finally check out Red Tiger...and I have to say it was just ok...The service wasn't the best. We ordered one round of drinks and the waiter ended up forgetting our second order of drinks (we just ended up canceling them it was too long of a wait). It was a busy night but the drinks were not the only thing that was forgotten. When it comes down to the food, it was again just ok. We tried a lot on the menu; I got the vietnamese shrimp pancakes which were delicious, it was the star choice of the evening. My friends were not in love with any of their choices. I would not organize to go back there based on my first experince, but if another person wanted to go grab a drink (the drinks were very good espcially the bourbon drink) there and get some viet pancakes I would not oppose. Overall wish my experience was better but willing to give a second."
/user_details?userid=4fnplq6mVLWeneFKdmRZ4Q,Tin N.,"Houston, TX",5 star rating,"This place is exceptional!!First of all I'm from Houston TX and we have one of the largest Vietnamese community in the US.  Which means, Vietnamese food is abundant and pretty darn good. So I was visiting my friend in Montreal and she decided to take me to a Vietnamese restaurant. At first I was reluctant to go, but I decided to give it a shot and see what Montreal had to offer. So I went with an open mind and palate and tried not to be biased.We came on a Saturday night and it was packed! We we're lucky enough to get a table without waiting. Our waiter was super friendly. I was really impressed with the decor and ambiance. We started with the escargot cooked in coconut milk and it was awesome!  I had a beer and my friend got a girly cocktail which was a bit strong but very good!  One of my favorites was the beef wrapped in leaves (bò lá lot), very authentic! I got the bún bò hue which was one of my favorite dishes when I traveled back to Vietnam. The flavors were remarkable, the combination of the spices and the all aromas brought me back to Vietnam lol. The chicken dish was very well executed, everything was right. At that point, I was getting full but we decided to go for one more appetizer and ordered (banh khot) which was some delicious mini pancakes with shrimp. It was delectable. Vietnamese comfort street food at it's best!!Vietnamese cuisine has simple dishes but yet extremely complex. A century of french domination had impacted in a good way this culture and it shows in it's cuisine. Red Tiger gives respect and represents this cooking style very well!My only request is that they constantly come up and create more dishes. There's a lot of Vietnamese food out there that deserves to be introduced. Overall this restaurant was a pleasant surprise for me. Cool concept, very good food with no pretentions. I highly recommend it."
/user_details?userid=XkzFfufzJWFcuOdk0nTrzA,Katrina T.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",3 star rating,"This place has a nice late night vibe and authentic Vietnamese food. We ordered a few things, including a salad, the foetus, the rice cakes, wings, beef rolls, pork ribs, etc. The papaya salad was on point and we finished it all. The foetus was something I had been wanting to try and was a little bit weary. It was ok, tasted like a soft boiled egg but more gamey, I wouldn't eat it again. the banh khot was delicate and a bit sweet, which was quite pleasant. The wings had an epic crunch but i would have liked a bit more sauce. The beef in betel leaves my friends enjoyed, I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor. The braised pork was very good. But my favorite dish had to be the bot chien, rice and taro paste poelee, it reminded me of a breakfast dish but the textures and flavors were amazing"

/user_details?userid=Be_4XEnrQ_S5agPdSUW41A,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"It was a disaster. We had reserved for a group of 15 The day before our dinner, someone called the head of our group and advised him that we'd have a fixed menu BC of our size. Fine. A fixed menu should mean a few choices. But instead, when we got there, they told us we were being charged 30$ per head. No discussion. And instead of any choice, they just threw down 10 dishes to share.. Out of those dishes, 9 had meat. Well, three in the group are vegetarian. We immediately explained the situation and asked if we could perhaps switch out some of the dishes to make it more balanced. The ... I'm going to say manager... Flat out refused. Told us his kitchen was inconvenienced by the whole thing. We pointed out that this means that the vegetarian is paying 30$ for a small amount of food....if our group had been informed ahead of time, heck if we had some flexibility, but again it was a flat out refusal. We finally convinced a waitress to try and work something... The manager dude was ignoring us by then. We managed to get some veggie spring rolls, and one other plate to share while the manager glared at us. Ridiculous to charge someone 30$ for 1/10 of what was served. Two people were sick the next day. Service was awful, and most remarked that the food was menh. ""Waysian"" was a term thrown around...Wouldn't set foot back there if you paid me"
