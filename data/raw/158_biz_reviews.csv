I was skeptical because it's one of those ""instagram able"" places but the lobster Benedict was SOOOO good. It came with a perfectly poached runny egg on top of a mound of lobster. So delicious! Don't be fooled, it's cold like a salad though. Food came out in less than 5 minutes! Also, there was a lot of open tables at noon on a Sunday!"

Although we all placed our order at the same time, our dishes were not served together. Moreover, beside our first coffee order, we didn't see our waitress again till we had to flag her down for the bill; I was in dire need of coffee too! Oh, and she had to redo all our bills cause she didn't get the orders right... The food itself was good; I had the avo toast and I really enjoyed the thick slice of bread and tangy toppings as really balanced out my dish although it could have used some salt. The chai latte was a miss; it tasted mostly of warm milk and was way heavy on the cinnamon."

I've tried their trout salad, fettuccine, cavatelli, grilled octopus and asparagus risotto. EVERYTHING about ALL of these dishes were perfect; I wouldn't change a single thing! Though everything was fantastic, my absolute favourite dishes were the trout salad and grilled octopus. The trout was the best I've ever had. It was lightly charred and offered the perfect balance of flavour and freshness. The grilled octopus dish was refreshing and beautifully presented. It was served with watermelon, mint and feta. The octopus was unbelievably tender!If you're hungry, be prepared to order a few things because the portions are small. I'd suggest getting 2 dishes per person to eat individually or share. In addition to the food being amazing, the vibe is also on point. The restaurant is very open and spacious, the decor is a cross between upscale and hippy, and the music is great! This place is a gem, I can't wait to return to try a few more delicious dishes!"

This place is super cute, I love the interior and the ambiance. I ordered the avocado toast and my boyfriend got a the breakfast sandwich and they were both really delicious!"
/user_details?userid=GnJ2w63izmrICmt1wNCGOA,Laurence V.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"My friend and I came here, thinking it was a coffee shop where we could eat and pull out our laptops to do some work based on the name. However, right as we walked in, it was obviously a busy restaurant during Sunday brunch. We came in without reservations, which was risky, but we managed to find a spot at the bar. The place was pretty loud and crowded, but the staff was very welcoming. It was decorated very modern, clean, and ""instagrammable"". Their brunch menu had a few options, and I liked that they offered the option of bottomless mimosas. I had the cassolette gypsy dish, which was ordinary but tasty. My friend had the French toast which I thought the mascarpone a bit too overwhelming in taste. Perhaps maybe I'd be more satisfied during their dinner service as I would be able to enjoy the bar, but I did enjoy my experience at Gypsy!"

The place was busy but there were still a few tables to be had.It was way too loud and we prefer to talk to each other rather than yell so we decided take out was best.The hostess was less than impressed with our choice but let us look at the menu.1.) the menu was different online and in the restaurant. On of the main items I wanted, wasn't listed.2.) I waited a good 8 minutes while the hostess chatted to the seated table in front of me. When she noticed me, she apologized. I asked about my menu item. She acknowledged and said she'd asked the chef.3.) She came back and said the chef wasn't doing take out due to a large event. We could sit if we wanted..or maybe try another day. -she didn't mention my menu item-there was no evidence of a big event. No reserved tables, no signs, nothing-The chef would have had to prepare the same meal whether we sat or left. The only difference is packaging. Plate or box. It's unfortunate this was too big of a deal for him-what if we had asked for a doggy bag? Would he have been too busy?Nope..chef can't be bothered to box our food, I don't think I can be bothered to try a different night."

We were helped by Mia (sp) and she was absolutely wonderful, she recommended a great drink off the new drink menu and remembered us when we came in a couple days later for brunch. The space is beautiful and the energy is really great, good for afternoon coffee and some work/study if alone, or dinner and drinks with friends!"
