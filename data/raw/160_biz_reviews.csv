/user_details?userid=LPDOx50zUR-rEovzOhADbA,Rachel C.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"I wish I would've found out about this place earlier! It's a very interesting bar, not a lot of young people frequent this space which makes it a lot less rowdy than the bars on St. Laurent. I love to come here for an intimate date night, or an afternoon drink with a friend, especially during the summer. The drinks are CHEAP (most expensive cocktail is $10.50 WOW), and they have an extensive list of domestic and international brews of beer. My only complaint about this place is that the waitress/ bartender that served my friend and I did not tell us about their happy hour specials listed on the wall. Given the extensive decorations on the wall it's pretty easy to miss the board with the price lists, and it's not listed on the menu. They have two simple cocktails for $11, $27 for a large sangria, and other specials that I can't remember off the top of my head. I personally do not think the food looked amazing; the portion sizes are very small and pretty expensive. There's no way I'm ever going to pay $11 for two pulled pork BBQ sliders... Overall it's a great bar to hang out at, and I can only hope that the rowdy St. Laurent crowd never finds out about this hidden gem."
/user_details?userid=iRQ_YKpCBdaCwvc2X8_3NQ,David N.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"After a little exploring of our Montreal neighborhood, we discovered this small gem of a restaurant nearby.It's essentially a hole in the wall, but one with so much personality and charm that it feels like a classic bistro.We snagged a comfortable table right in the center of the restaurant, and began perusing the promising menu. We decided to share a few things: Shrimp Tacos (""with jalapenos, shallots, cabbage, pickled red onions, avocado sauce and chipotle""), Mini Bison Burgers (""with beets, blue cheese and chipotle sauce""), and Mac N' Cheese.While nothing we ate blew us away, the food was all quite tasty and fresh, and we certainly ate every last bite that was in front of us.Else's is more about the comfortable vibe than anything else, and on that level, it's definitely the kind of place I wish I had in my neighborhood."
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Went for late night casual drinks. Nice atmosphere and vibe. Nice neighbourhood with other small and interesting little bars. Fairly standard drink list (good enough for me). Had a very pleasant - low key - time.Late night bar menu: only tried one thing w my group... quesadillas. Definitely wouldn't try that again fpoor quality recipe and execution). Not sure if their regular menu is better.Thus, my overall 3 stars rating reflects 4 stars on late night drink experience and 2 stars on food experience."
/user_details?userid=iquCZU8tjmRQrnDgci5YpQ,Cori C.,"Calgary, Canada",4 star rating,"Else's feels like that coffee shop we all loved in college, but grown up and with a French flair. You can come and enjoy a book by yourself or hang out and chat with friends for hours. The staff is friendly and chill. Sit by the windows for good people watching. If you're lucky you can snag a seat at their tiny bar.I used to come here because it was down the street. Now it's a bit of a trek, but I still do it."
/user_details?userid=C2YxxeHBKtJ5Eokpi2urcQ,Anna N.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"Plateau essential! Great vibes - candlelit date at night, and green edgy lunch spot at day. The food is really good too. My go to is to always split the vegetarian sliders and shrimp tacos with someone, although I've also tried the salad and it's very rich and delicious. Don't go for the cocktails, they're nothing special, except maybe for their bourbon lemonade (I don't like bourbon but my bf loves it). It's all about their beers."
/user_details?userid=7kHvR0i3ui73Emesccu0Cw,Joy S.,"Fort Thomas, KY",5 star rating,"Went for dinner with a party of 6 and were seated immediately. We ordered the pulled pork sliders, shrimp tacos, roasted veggie salad, and bison sliders. All were outstanding! This was not your typical bar food. The space was snug, but provided a cozy, warm environment. The service was exceptionally attentive and they had a fine selection of drinks and draft beers. We would definitely go back!"
/user_details?userid=Zn_p_8WmTG4PPo0qPgk9qg,Greg T.,"St Albert, Canada",5 star rating,Came across Else's after we we had smoked meat sandwiches.  What an awesome place. Lots of character.  Very relaxed and great history.  I will be coming back when I come to Montreal.
/user_details?userid=wXCBEdE7U2cv_f9ml7-N4w,Eileen F.,"Lincoln Park, Chicago, IL",5 star rating,No review could capture just how special Else's is! This place is packed with character and I could spend hours chatting here. The wings are amazing and the service is super friendly. Else's plays great music and the funky decor mixed with the plethora of greenery makes for a great time. I sat at a table with a Wonder Woman print all over it which was just so fun! The wings are tasty and unique too! Else's is The Hang!
/user_details?userid=9eehtcnYhZAHug1uMI6iRQ,Kojo A.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"We stopped for a quick drink at Else's around noon. As such, there weren't many people there, and we didn't grab any food, so my opinion will be brief.The bartenders were cool guys, with good conversation. The bar itself has a traditional vibe, with a sparing number of old ball decorations.I grabbed myself a Brume Suisse (i.e. Swiss Fog), which is a delightfully warm Goldschlager and cinnamon drink. If you're walking by the bar on a cold day, with a hankering for a bit of a buzz, this drink is perfection. It's the sort of thing an irresponsible parent would give to their kid to put them to sleep.Cool bar. Try it out."
/user_details?userid=CyHGCmRZwiT4cxor4f1hrA,J L.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I absolutely love Else's. It has such a cool atmosphere, yummy bar food, nice servers, and tons of drinks. The golden velvet is my favourite- it's cream ale mixed with their homemade cider. Everything is fairly priced. I'd recommend it for a date or grabbing a drink with friends. I live in the area and it's one of my go-tos."
/user_details?userid=9SOvPdl977qQ9qTfczcXcw,Jeff S.,"Gainesville, FL",5 star rating,"Many pubs have good food, fewer have good deals (Happy Hour pints 5.75), even fewer have a story and charm such as Else's. It feels like a cosy hole-in-the-wall with charm and friendly staff that are sure to delight. Great selection of beers and devour inside is unique and eccentric"
/user_details?userid=wJF-NdtxYCk_SrwG4UUL9Q,Stephanie L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This quaint place is off the beaten track - St. Laurent and Roy. It's a really great place, dimly lit with bar specials from 5 - 8h. You can get 2 drinks for $10, I opted for rye and ginger. They also have some great food offerings I chose the bison burgers with beets and blue cheese. It wasn't bad, fair enough for $10. My boyfriend got the large vegetarian quesadillas, this was huge, served with a side salad and generous amounts of salsa and sour cream. There were lots of other options, including vegetarian dishes such as butter tofu and an asparagus salad. This place has a really great vibe and a super cool story of it's conception. Be sure to read the story of Else on the back of the menu, it's pretty interesting!"
/user_details?userid=iN3RHTcYDTyBALOh4z_G1g,Leah B.,"Fort Thomas, KY",5 star rating,"Cozy bar, attentive service, delicious food! We shared the bison burger and the salad and both were exceptional. The roasted veggies in the salad resembled kimchi and I could not get enough of them. Great variety of beers on draft!"
/user_details?userid=voFxNdzhG-cDrW_9NzFGbw,Denzil D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"What a great simple place. Friendly staff, laid back vibe make for a great place to hang off of Roy street. I really loved the story of Else the owner. Only had drinks, though you need to order food. The menu is really reasonable in terms of pricing. Checkout my pictures to see options and cost for food and drinks. Will update my review the next time I eat there."
/user_details?userid=swx0FJkZWb6nVP58ZsMl7w,Meng Z.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Else's is one of those small neighbourhood gems, tucked in on roy, slightly off St. Laurent. The vibe is of a quieter bar, dimly lit with candles on each table - another great date place. The food is great for the price you are paying and is definitely a notch higher than your average bar food. They have great tacos on real taco shells (corn based soft taco shells) and their serving of wings is very very generous. We had their mulled cider (with cinnamon and lemon), not quite as good as ones you get in Europe but paired with the cozy environment, it was definitely beyond pleasant."
/user_details?userid=wio2PT99Eth_4Kf0MynIDw,Aron G.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Else's has a great atmosphere and was a very enjoyable experience.  I ordered the vegetarian tacos which were delicious, and finished things off with the chocolate brownie ice cream sandwich.  Not to be missed!The staff were very courteous, friendly, and helpful.  I really enjoyed the experience and I look forward to coming back!"
/user_details?userid=aYL7qtwOMdzYayaddq_Hnw,CT M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great neighbourhood pub. Reasonable prices. Perfect for lunch, a 5a7, or a quiet date.Else's has gone through a lot of changes over the last decade because they only have a restaurant license and periodically re-invent the menu. The current menu, however, is at the best of its been in years. Serving sizes and presentation range anywhere from a solid, comfort food lunch to perfect for sharing. A few of things worth trying include:- the Bison Sliders (2 per serving)- the Shrimp or Pibil Tacos (4 per serving)- or the Philly Cheese Steak (comes with side saladThe place is also a solid bet for a quiet sunday afternoon or pints and cocktails late into the night. The music is never too loud, and even when it's busy, it doesn't seem to crowded (despite its size).If you're in the 'hood and looking for a satisfying bite or just to catch up with friends or that book you've been working through, you should definitely consider Else's."
/user_details?userid=QiQnYLP4cNMufoZsnxHjUQ,Jake H.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,Little piece of France. Food and drinks were awesome with open window view of a little park!
/user_details?userid=Br9bkJqjKms9BjvKWZsgwA,Ali K.,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",5 star rating,Else's is amazing...the beer they have for any reason I like it very much...I regularly go there and their snacks keep their good quality... Always happy about what I eat there and more importantly people there are awesome... always helpful and try to make it comfortable for you and your group of friends.
/user_details?userid=99PrzMl_bMnhXPjQ2qPrTQ,Lauren H.,"Silver Spring, MD",5 star rating,"My heart is at Else's! What a fun, funky, original Franco-Norwegian creation, brought to us by a lady who left us way too soon but whose spirit lives on in this artsy, mischievous bar. The beer is good, the decor whimsical, the music Americana, and the waitstaff friendly and knowledgable. Huge windows and vines and flowers produce an open feeling, as if you're half in nature and half in a service establishment. The food looked terrific and is veg-friendly. We'd be back all the time if we lived in the area."
/user_details?userid=vcJZqjDJQbV0-GeMuqhbaw,Ari V.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"A chill atmosphere, full of creatives. In the afternoon, definitely a place where it's okay to fly solo, have a coffee or scotch and food, and focus on your writing, design, or other work. In the evening, it fills with interesting people.Reasonable prices, friendly staff, artsy ambiance."
/user_details?userid=5Y3WvH9dUZZq5mERHB5_AA,Kelsey K.,"Valrico, FL",5 star rating,"If I lived in Montréal, I could see myself visiting this bar regularly. It feels like a bar you might find in Ireland, rather than the US. Either way, I ordered the shrimp tacos and Portuguese sausage quesadillas and both were delicious. My favorite thing about the bar was the endless alcoholic beverage options. I ordered a Caipirinha (traditional Brazilian cocktail) and OMG, I'm still thinking about it."
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Like almost everyone else, I can't emphasize enough how much I love Else's. This cozy, slightly dim-lit neighborhood gem is the perfect place to bring your friends or loved ones for some drinks and a nice meal. I went there with my parents for lunch, and everyone loved what they had ordered.I got a hot calvacidre (calvados + cider), and my dad got an allongé while my mom just stuck with water. My dad said that personally he didn't find it that strong, but then again, he does tend to like his coffee stronger than most people do (I took him to Juliette et Chocolat the next day and he loved their espresso). I thought that the calvacidre was pure boozy goodness with a hit of apple, but smelling it before drinking is not exactly the most pleasing experience for the olfactory senses.For the food, my mom got the shrimp tacos with arugula salad, my dad got the pulled pork buns, and I got the polenta with feta, prosciutto, arugula, cherry tomatoes, and a boiled egg. I thought the polenta tasted amazing when combined with the other ingredients, as it tasted creamy, slightly sour from the cheese, salty from the prosciutto, bitter from the arugula, and sweet from the tomato, so it really teases your palate. The only thing I wish was slightly better was that the egg was served runny, just how I like it, but it was also cold. If it was a warm egg it would have made it that much better. The shrimp tacos were also fantastic and contained the perfect mix of shrimp chunks and vegetables, and I love how they used corn tortillas instead of flour ones. The pulled pork buns were meaty and slightly sweet, but they weren't overbearingly fatty and they were served with much less guilt than normal pork buns.Honestly, if it's your first time here, I feel like you could order anything on the menu and it would be a winner. I've also had the mac and cheese and pulled pork tacos before, and they're nothing short of divine. I can't wait to go back and try more things someday."
/user_details?userid=L1xB30wQZaMWdCR9M87lUA,Gianni D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Oh Else's, how much have I missed you...Now that I see you again, lots!! Haven't been in over a year, until last night. What a cool place! Love the energy, we could have stayed for another 3 hours just talking away, sipping our beers, enjoying our table surrounded by a crowd of tightly packed tables of diverse fauna. A microcosm of Montreal, that was it. Yes, that is what it was. E.G. Montreal at its best.Yup, we also ordered food with our Asahi and Czechvar beers. Tacos Pibil (delish); Grilled Polenta (very surprisingly good. One does not expect it so good from a pub, but this is no ordinary pub!!); Butter Chicken (fair. More British style butter chicken than Indian). Please keep this place friendly, with good staff and service. It is paramount. We shall be back in a few weeks for certain. Never again shall we be apart for so long."
/user_details?userid=glCZpRr0LSMssbkOYGXpbQ,Kemi A.,"Portland, OR",5 star rating,"This place is so adorable! We were nearby and my friend suggested this place for dinner, so off we went. It's in a quiet neighborhood but I feel it fits perfectly. Apparently Else was a kick ass Scandiavian who opened up this restaurant years ago. Sadly she has passed away, but her memory lives out in the food. I was a bit hesitant in trying the chicken tacos but they came out perfectly. My friend had the quesadilla and felt the same way. The staff is really friendly, case in point I nearly walked out without my sunglasses and they stopped me right in time. :) This is a cozy little joint where you can relax with friends or take a date out for an intimate night. Highly recomended!"
/user_details?userid=izabjLosXTh94TVG48aD6w,Shashank K.,"Revere, MA",4 star rating,"Pleasant ambience with good food. Love the fact they attempt international dishes, the butter chicken and butter tofu were good. Not the same flavor as you'd get at an authentic Indian restaurant but the naan (bread) was almost better."
/user_details?userid=QeHZjU8MrX6p0vYCqyXiJA,Christina L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been here twice and it always seems like my friends are more impressed by Else's than I am. This by no means lessens my affection for this place (There is this cured fish and cucumber salad dish that makes me feel like I got punched in the mouth with a pack full of flavour! Though I do wish the portion size was MUCH bigger...), but my friends always seem to pick the dish that's a decent portion and delicious (Fish&Chips, Calamari). This one friend said the calamari at their place was the BEST calamari he's ever tasted. Quite the praise if you ask me. Nonetheless, if you're in Montreal and you want to bring your friends to a chill and cozy place with great ambiance,  I think Else's would be a great choice. They have quite a selection of drinks and great food. I'm the type of person where if I happen to recommend a restaurant that my friends like, I always feel like I take full responsibility of the meal as though I'm the chef. Therefore, Else's would probably be my best bet for a great recommendation."
/user_details?userid=i3CfQFzSmWNlFfdajpwtcQ,Alexis W.,"Schenectady, NY",5 star rating,Great neighborhood spot. We came for a late dinner our last evening in the city and regretted not finding it sooner! Pibil tacos are SO good
/user_details?userid=HVGfPIZ-w4f0_CfejUGhxg,Joyce N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I went there yesterday with my cousin, the decor is great, the food is great(although the wings were a bit too salty for my liking), the drinks were good as well. I asked the waitress what drink she would recommend and she said the Kir Royal but my cousin's Mojito was by far better than that. The prices are cheap, and the atmosphere is very friendly and not too loud. Would definitely go back!"

/user_details?userid=LQG9wFTmscbAATp8QWj1hg,Kathy H.,Hong Kong,5 star rating,"I loooooove bars like these. It's a place where, as Johnson said, anyone can be here. I visited after work, I visited after school. I can look like a bum wearing my puffy winter jacket and eating, because it was so cold. It really doesn't matter. Other customers of this bar are fantastic. I see all sorts of people. Everyone is friendly. The troublemakers and the clumsy patrons are friendly. The staff are friendly. Love the beers and only $6-7 for a pint! I couldn't help but stay 2 hours longer than expected, even though a long night of assignments awaited me.Food was delicious. $10 for 2 sliders.The lights at the back of the bar is extremely bright. Way too bright!! Sitting near the front is ideal for me.Else's is like a dive bar, but very clean. It's almost undiscoverable if it wasn't for Yelp."

/user_details?userid=GluXH9-1YpkbBII6nN3Vmw,Leah T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been to Else's multiple times and it never disappoints. Affordable, decent food and drink, this is a great spot for a date or a meet-up with a few friends. It's cozy, dark and candlelit (so everyone looks good), low key atmosphere, and the music isn't too loud so you can have a conversation over your meal (the establishment requires you to order food if you are drinking alcohol).My favorite dish would be the fish tacos or the veggie tacos. I also like their simple beer selection and I've never had a cocktail I didn't like here. The wait staff are all very polite and knowledgable. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a cute, local place to grab a few drinks and have a bite to eat."
/user_details?userid=6aWDAw37z6zgfw-f6HXFnA,Matt B.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,Very nice place to hang drink and eat. The prices are reasonable and the portions are on the small side. Tried the pulled pork and bison burgers. Both were good and homey.The service is great. Attentive and quick.
/user_details?userid=EteGefsj2fdR5mJxi0dxbA,Linda F.,"London, United Kingdom",4 star rating,"One of my favourite bars in Montreal. It's cozy, dark, friendly, and just plain gives me the warm fuzzies. As everyone notes, they have a restaurant license so you are requested to order food so that you can also order drinks. It used to be that they had super cheap options like olives or samosas for less than $5. That's increased in the last several years and now most of the options are around $10 or more. In my personal experience, we've always been able to share dishes. In the dozens of times I've been here, we have not been asked to order individual plates. But other people's experience differs, so I don't really know of it's something we say or do or just luck. Beer menu is not huge, but sufficient for most tastes. They've also got cocktails, cider, hot drinks. If you sit near the back of the bar, there are large notebooks leaning on the piano. They are filled with the notes and doodles of past patrons over the years. They're good for a browse when you're a few drinks in. I don't really come here for the food, Else's is just that special that I'm willing to put up with this little inconvenient charade of ordering food just so I can keep drinking here. Sometimes, I think this charade is part of the charm."
/user_details?userid=XILA-PtHX99FNHuMIT6C2g,Sam H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,The best neighbourhood bar in the plateau. Best in the early afternoon when the windows are open. All the food is good but I find they do light dishes better than heavy.

/user_details?userid=JKQmuH6PKCDXpeZYK3BmnQ,Mister O.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Nice, dark, slightly dive-y room, with warm, almost Christmaslike light.  Good selection of whiskies.  Topnotch chocolate cheesecake.  Decent espresso.  A hint of street life visible from the bar.  Talkative, happy,  grown-up crowd, all seemingly there to converse with their friends rather than to bang tequila slammers down their hatches.  Well-mannered, easygoing staff who'll treat you kindly.  They've got a restaurant licence only and they'll ask you to order food with your glass of Bushmills, but what's a drink without a nosh?  The only real problem I have with this place is getting a decent chair on a cold autumn or winter afternoon.Usable restroom.I always peek in when I'm in the area on an errand, just to see if there's anywhere I'd want to sit for a quick drink.  It's too cozy a place to walk past without checking."
/user_details?userid=2vKPIXEFrtqZc8zIWvA4tw,MaryJane R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This bar is really cute and has a great atmosphere. I agree with one of the reviewers that this bar is probably at its best during winter snow storms. There are many advantages to this bar as other reviewers pointed out - the music is not too loud, nice selection of beers, wine and cocktail. Surely, everyone in your crowd will find something to enjoy. However, we didn't drink any beer or cocktail that was really really good but maybe we didn't try enough. I was just much more impressed by the beer at Dieu du Ciel. While Else's offers a range of food options, our food didn't amaze us (but it's definitely ok!). Basically, I would come here if I was in the area but I don't think it's worth an extended trip down. Also, I would definitely come here if members of your group like different things."

Was with some friends who tried other things on the menu, and they seemed to enjoy it as well. The prices are also pretty good for what it is. The service was a bit slow besides drinks, likely because it's a bar. The ambiance is nice, they have dim lighting around the place which can be nice depending on what vibe you're going for but I thought it was a little too dark (reason why this review doesn't have pictures posted)."

/user_details?userid=Gv2wHeY8sQuyEUS8yX56HA,Paul G.,"Edmonton, Canada",3 star rating,I don't know why they don't obtain a stand alone liquor license.  You must order food in order to get a beer.  And thus add another $12 to your tab.  So not a place to stop in for a drink or two.  Otherwise it is a quirky bistro style lounge with plants and organic colored chairs and walls.  No patio.  A bit noisy inside.  Limited menu.  But one can see outside very well.  They seem to have free wifi.  Unique atmosphere on a quiet side street.

The decor is eclectic and the staff are all very friendly and skilled at their jobs. The prices on pints and cocktails are fair, and they have great happy hour deals that last longer than 5 a 7. The food menu is not what you'd expect from a bar, but everything that I've eaten has been very tasty. The crowd is a bit older than other joints in the area, which is a refreshing escape from the wild St-Laurent club scene."

It's at its best in the winter right after a big snow. The small corner it sits on is the perfect place to watch the coordinated massive machine ballet of Montreal snow removal. Nice scotch collection and beers on tap, tasty samosas and nachos and other little snacks - you have to order the eats to get the booze so they are not crazy spectacular but they are delicious, unpretentious and cool just like everyone who works and drinks and writes tucked into this friendly local institution."

There was so much mint in it that it was unbelievably refreshing. I'm disappointed by all the mojitos I've had elsewhere because they typically only consist of one or two mint small leaves, which you can hardly taste. Else's is a little out of the way, but I hope to make it back sometime for another mojito and really hope that they haven't started cheaping out on ingredients since I was last there!"
/user_details?userid=eAcpHF1UUBFG4V0mdmYzXQ,Diana A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Such a great spot. When my Saturday-night plans fell through, I turned to yelp in search of a nearby bar with chill vibes, which led my boyfriend and me to Else's. The whimsical décor and abundant indoor plants provided ambiance, and the quesadilla did not disappoint. Enough people filled the moderately sized restaurant so that I felt satisfied my evening of ""going out"" while avoiding some overcrowded amateur hour. It's a good spot for a casual date or to catch up with friends. Keep in mind you have to order food in order to drink because they only have a restaurant license. I found this a bit off-putting, but then again, I'm new to the area. I will definitely return, but next time I will come with an appetite."

You won't get food this good at such great prices anywhere else. In particular, the shepard's pie is next level! I actually don't even like shepard's pie, but this is like nothing I've ever had. Cheesy, bacon-y, and oh so yummy!My boyfriend and I have literally tried every single thing on the menu with only one thumbs down, the nachos. They were just ok. Everything else about this place is great though! And they have an awesome extended 5-7."

Honestly, it has 100% been the best part of my trip. By Day 3 of this visit, I had basically resigned myself to being treated like sh*t everywhere I went, because I'm American AND I don't speak French. I came upon these reviews and went to check it out.What a relief from all the nose-in-the-air attitude! Everyone was friendly, helpful, and kind. The house cider was so lovely on a rainy day, and the plates are perfectly sized. If you miss real coffee shops from the 90's, this place will take you back--in the very best way. Not to sound corny, but...you can really feel the spirit of the proprietor and the relationships she developed, in the way that locals make themselves at home and interact with one another here.

Candles on the tables add to the ambiance. Usually good music playing. Tasty food and good drink selection. If you have a big group get there early to secure tables. This is a favorite spot of McGill Geology grad students.Also a good spot for working during the day."

Once again, the combination of charming bartenders (Julia and Kat, not Mia as previously reported!), and a great vibe with really good inexpensive snacks worked magic on me. The windows are open to the warm street on this charming little street corner, and the conversations are varied and lively. There WAS a television on (bot only temporarily- for an important soccer match), but this is not a TV dominated space, and thank god! Try the shrimp tacos, asparagus salad, and the chicken wings.

The menu changed and there is no more calamaris,fish and chips, or ribs (or any of the other tasty treats you see on the photos in this profile)!!! When asking about why this change was made we got the answer that they have changed the chef and gotten rid of their deep frier and and as side of attitude from the waitress. After inquiring about the calamaris the quality of service decreased drastically, I guess they are sick of people asking for food they no longer have.We settled for the chicken wings and noodle salad (a sad substitute for the calamaris), which arrived after about half an hour and the (bland) chicken wings had the same temperature of the noodle salad. I guess they are trying to be some kind of fancier gastro-pub, which they sadly fail big time at."

It's cozy, unpretentious and at the comfortable intersection of St Denis East Plateau franco cool, St Laurent hipsterdom and a quick saunter away from the McGill student ghetto. That means that Else's is pure Montreal where you can switch back and forth between eng and fr. It's kindova jam-packed place with the tables tucked in pretty close so if you're bilingual, you can get in some choice eavesdropping while you're having yourself a nice drink. They've got cider on tap as well as a pretty respectable selection of Quebec microbrews and hard liker.Food-wise, I like: the samosas. They're nice and greasy though the Indian platter feels a bit sparse. The chilli's where the money's at, in my book. You get a nice full bowl of thick red-bean tomato stew with some nice cumin and chili highlights and a plate full of corn chips to go with it. Cheese and no cheese options are available."
/user_details?userid=VOkQp62ZufDuECAM8hUdGg,art f.,"Annandale, VA",5 star rating,What a find!  We stumbled in (with an assist from Lonely Planet). The place is on a corner in a residential neighborhood - albeit one where one window facing the bar has a female mannequin legs dangling out.  Late PM and the place was busting with Mac's.  Obviously a lot of regulars but our service (we were obviously the only tourists in the place) was excellent.  A very good beer selection. You need to order one food item for the table - we were steered to a $4 quesadilla that proved surprisingly good.A comfortable but vibrant atmosphere - well lit and a good soundtrack that's not too loud for talking or reading. One of the great neighborhood bars.
/user_details?userid=k2t-xCELlWanDIBPp5oEyg,Ian M.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"Great atmosphere, nice date place. Good beer selection. My only qualms are that the service has been pretty bad on several of the occasions that I've been here, and you have to order food to drink (although that's a pretty minor issue, as they have some cheap dishes to get around that). I'd recommend if you're looking for something relaxed and don't mind waiting for service."

It's just an awesome venue where all of the key elements that makes a good bar great can be found here. That's why Else's THE place! I loved everything about it: great ambiance, unpretentious, relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff and great music. My friend and I arrived when the band finished their set but one of Else's patrons decided to tickle at the piano keys near the back of the bar and played a few tunes. It was impromptu and fun. Else's that kind of place. In terms of libation, they have a great Scotch list but instead, we opted for the cold cider. It was a local brew and unfortunately I can't remember the name of it but it tasted crisp, refreshing, and not too sweet. Their food menu is good and simple: from salads to nachos, and other healthy options. I had their veggie samosas, which were delicious. I would have loved to returned to Else's to spend more time there but it was my last night in the city. Of course, this only means I have to return to Montreal very soon, which is not a bad thing all!"

I have lived around the corner for the last 10 years and have had met both friends, colleagues (realtors) and clients here. What I like about this place and why I recommend it, lets start with the story, Elses namesake a way cool chick who decided to open up a bar in the Plateau at a time when the plateau was filled with one of two categories, either Portuguese families, or all the bohemians living on the plateau back when it was really cheap, she was part of the founders of the plateau in my mind.  I first moved to the plateau over 20 years ago, when you could find an apartment at the rate of 100$ per room, so if you had a 4,5 it would cost 450$, needless to say that at the price the people living there were able to move from one place to another easily, there were tonnes of these cheap rentals and the vibe was all about moving every year, vs having to paint (not kidding it was too easy).  No one had money but everyone lived for dirt cheap and went out all the time to neghborhood places that sprang up randomely like elses, the vibe was about doing whatever you wanted (which is why she is considered a rebel, see this is restaurant according to the permit, so she must sell food, but let's be real, it's a pub where you buy chilly.  Just so you know this place can drop some serious names, I have seen poiltiicans, high end business execs, and once even someone like Will Ferrel  they are mingling in the casual place with other regulars who simply spend their entire lived there The place it around for reason it just too cool a place to not try sometime. Elses is great anytime of the day, night or and yearound have fun"

My girlfriend had a few of their mixed drinks, and they were all good too.When we were there the place was busy but not packed. The table and chair setup is good, but we sat at the bar.

The unique forest green arched interior gives the sense of being in grandeur while eclectic decor is melanged with exotic cacti and memorabilia from yesteryear such as an over sized poster advertising for a Manet exhibition. One need look no further than your own table top to start though, as each tiny round is decorated with a different print, pattern, or painting. While the menu is predominantly (and impressively) libation-centric, the food options of open-faced sandwiches and and other snacks make perfectly tasty and cheap accompaniments. The Delhi Belly featuring  pakoras, pita wedges, chickpea dip, balsamic dressed greens, and a veggie samosa is hands down my platter of choice."

Its a quite bar, low music, low lighting and a good selection of whiskey. BUT due to permits and licensing you have to order food in order to be served alcohol. They keep this because many of the patrons think its charming. You can order a small treat for about 4 dollars. The first time I went only 1or 2 people in our group got food and it was fine, the last time I visited they made EVERYONE order. If it wasnt for that small rule I would visit more often, especially since my favorite time for a drink is after dinner."

Cute blue outside, dark and intimate inside, with ivy and a collection of audio tapes on the walls. Free wifi for studying during the day, and delicious food and drinks at night. Else's has a homey, neighborhood atmosphere but is also very welcoming. It's a great place for a date or a chill night out with friends, and the excellent music they play is an added bonus. I would give this place 5 stars because it is one of my favorites in the city save one fact: their liquor license requires you to get food if you are getting alcohol as well. While their nachos are the best I've ever had (seriously, I dream about them), it is easy to rack up quite a tab as their pints are slightly more expensive than average. Since sometimes I only want a drink and no food, I've had to forego many trips to this place, and it is something for potential patrons to keep in mind when they visit. Even so, it's a phenomenal and cute bar that is definitely worth a visit...or ten!"

It has a great atmosphere; good music, friendly people, wonderful and attentive waiters, and overall fun feel. Also completely unpretentious. My friend spilled her drink completely upon getting it without taking a sip and the waitress/bartender brought over a new one right away. I will definitely go back!"

Maybe it's who I was with the nights I was there or the timat in my life but this is my favorite bar and probably always will be. I used to live on Laval around the corner and would love running over to get a hot calvacidre and split the mandatory small plate of veggie pizza or indian snacks. There's nothing quite like running head down through a snowy Montreal night to turn the corner and get inside Else's door and find the mellow life going on inside. One night, at the table next to me, a man who I am assuming was a magician pulled a bunch of doves out of a box. It somehow seemed normal. Something about the ambiance and the attitude and the drink menu and the story of the founder Else and her vision for her namesake makes this place the best meeting place, the most special first dates venue, and the best escape from the utter chaos that was St Laurent during uni."
