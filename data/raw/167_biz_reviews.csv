Everything is made with the traditional oven and tastes like the ones I used to buy in Lebanon! The service is very fast, despite the place being very busy with delivery orders, etc.We also ordered one coffee and an espresso, which were also delicious.The price is a bit high compared to other places who sell the same products, but for the quality of the ingredients, the generosity and the whole vibe of the place, it is totally worth it!"

Their specialty is Manouche and Lebanese coffee. Manouche is a typical Libanese Flat bread and they offer a variety of toppings. Asfor Lebanese coffee, this is similar to Turkish coffee with Cardamom and no milk.I had the opportunity to taste their delicious Zaatar manouche with a latte. The manouche was made on the spot in an oven (ordered from Lebanon) so it was fresh and very tasteful, so much better than buying them ready- made from grocery stores. Their latte was excellent using roasted coffee beans from Structure torréfacteur which is also part of the Th3rd wave community. Staff was very friendly and sweet! Overall great experience and I got a little taste of Lebanon on a nice snowy day :-)Check them out!"

Initially I ordered an oat latte and two vegan cakes, one with turmeric and another with carob, then while I was waiting I was mesmerized by the chef's making flatbreads in a hot oven so we ordered some Manouche. I had the plain one, it was nice and warm right out the oven, rich from the sesame seeds and olive oil and zesty and tart from the sumac. It went perfect with my latte but I'm sure it would have been much better with their traditional espresso made on a bed of sizzling hot sand. Will definately try that next time, but I have to say this was perfect on a cold Montreal winter day!"
