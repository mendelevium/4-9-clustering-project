/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great place for some Italian food! I typically come here to get the chicken cutlet sandwich with a side of either the Caesar salad or a side of pasta. It is definitely enough food and you should expect to have some leftovers! However, that being said, next time I come here (usually with my partner), I'll likely share the sandwich because it is quite heavy if eating them both, with a side each.The pasta and Caesar salad are both great side dishes to accompany the sandwich. I typically opt for the pomodoro pasta, and it is typically served al dente. Overall, great dish! I would maybe add a bit more spice to it. As for the salad, it definitely is a great cleanser from the heavy sandwich if you're looking to reduce some carbs in the meal. This place does takeout too and the servers are all friendly! The food comes out hot and stays hot in their packaging!"
/user_details?userid=spU_FM_BDJ8CeZYsfuWo6g,Nancy H.,"Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow. Now this was a real treat. I've rarely been afforded the opportunity for authentic Italian food (save for at my Italian friend's home) and as a result it's not on the top of my favourite cuisines list...but this could really start to change that! Really good food, with good ingredients and care.We got the tomato salad with burrata, the calamari, the eggplant parm, and the veal meatballs. We ordered for takeout. The food was neatly packaged and hot. The tomato salad was colorful and the burrata was sublime, rich and luscious and creamy. The tomatoes weren't as sweet as I'd hoped but they were decent and fresh. The veal meatballs were tender and meaty, with a delicate mouthfeel and a nice richness without being too fatty. They were huge! The tomato sauce worked nicely with them. The eggplant parm was also excellent, and the calamari was good and nicely crisp. I wish there was more dipping sauce thoughAltogether a fabulous meal. I wish prices were lower, but good ingredients and quality doesn't come cheap I guess."

Café Gentile is such a tasty restaurant offering fresh pastas and great Italian food! The restaurant ambiance is quite cozy since it is pretty small. The decor is quite simple, minimalistic in a way but the wood and the saddle brown colours brings a bit of a rustic feel. To start, we ordered the Gentile's eggplant parmigiana. It was delicious! The wait was a bit long but it was definitely worth it. Each layer of the eggplant was cooked perfectly and the ratio of cheese to the eggplant was perfect. As for the main meals, we ordered the fresh daily pasta rigatoni with mushrooms, and the seafood tagliatelle. The rigatoni was cooked al dente. The only thing I didn't personally like was the strong taste of red wine. The seafood tagliatelle was very delicious. We ordered this dish since we saw a lot of people ordering this specific plate. So if you are looking for some cozy pasta restaurant, you should try out cafe gentile! Because life is about exploring pasta-bilities !!!"

Before heading to this restaurant for brunch, I had asked other people what they thought about this place. It was a bag of mixed reviews, therefore I knew I had to go in try it myself and not allowing other people's projecting their feelings of inadequacy onto mine.First, who dares to have pasta for breakfast? That's right: Me. If you know this by now, I am a real sucker for carbs and fresh pasta. Sure I may not die of hunger, but my girlfriend and I are convinced we may die of diabetes and cholesterol. Bad joke, but sort of true. Homemade tagliolini, mixed mushrooms, grana padano served with a fried Egg- Is this considered as breakfast since we've got ourselves an egg?I can't tell you how true Nonna's cooking taste like because I am clearly not Italian. But you know what else Italian's are great at? Coffee. At this present moment, I am still not a big fan of third-wave coffee with their ""blueberry pie"" sour coffee as Tony describes them. I think he and I see eye to eye on many things when it comes to Italian food culture.I don't know how your experience was at Café Gentile Westmount but personally, this place was a hit for me. Having the time to sit down and getting to know Anthony Gentile as a businessman, a father and husband truly made me respect this place even more. Sometimes the experience is not just about the food but the stories each individuals bring to the table. You can always sit with me.PS. Thank you Anthony for teaching me the proper ways of saying Bombolone like a true Italian."

My friend and I shared 3 appetizers, which were equally flavourful and interesting: winter caprese (21$), seared scallops (18$), and grilled cauliflower (10$). We also had 2 glasses of wine each. With this food and the drinks, we left 125$ in the money holder. Although satisfied with the food, I thought the prices were too high for what it was."
/user_details?userid=FHawvX1EU2cFPWcM3Ppt0g,Rachael K.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I was dying to try this chicken cutlet sandwich after so many people had been talking about it. the sand which was pretty big which was really nice so you could have some extras for leftovers and the chicken portions were extremely generous. I would give it a three out five as it was anything mind blowing or unique. I wished the chicken was a little more crispy. The fries were really good though and there pesto pasta is amazing!!!
/user_details?userid=8qu5Zyurap002eIj1kLdOg,Joana Z.,"Saint-Lambert, Canada",4 star rating,"Café Gentile is a small coffee shop located in a beautiful area next to a lot of other shops. As soon as we arrived, my friend and I were greeted by the waitress who asked us where we wanted to sit. We decided to have a seat on the outdoor terrace since it was very nice outside. The terrace is very cosy, but small! It makes it hard to have a conversation without hearing everyone else's conversation. Despite that, everything is very beautiful, inside and outside.As for the food, my friend ordered the smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel with the small potatoes and I had the avocado toast with a plate of fresh fruit. We also both had iced lattes with almond milk.The iced lattes were delicious, but only after we asked the waiter to add more almond milk because they felt bitter before that. The coffee was very strong, but very good!The cream cheese bagel was delicious, filled with smoked salmon and perfectly crunchy. The potatoes were also very good. I'd have to say I was a little bit disappointed with the avocado toast, I thought it was going to be a bigger portion than that, especially for the price. It was very good, just expected it to be bigger. The fresh fruit plate was huge and definitely fresh! I would recommend this place if you're grabbing coffee on the go or for a little breakfast date with friends or family. The service is very good as well, everything arrived fast and the waiters explained some items on the menu for us."

I looked up reviews and photos on Yelp and decided to try out the Chicken Parmigiana with Sexy Fries. My friends ordered several things from the menu to share amongst each other! The food came after 40 minutes and was average at best. The chicken was dry, hard and bland. Everyone else had the same experience and the common response was that the food & ingredients didn't taste fresh! Service was average. One of the servers only decided to be nice, when it was time to pay the bill and tip. Establishments in Montreal take their interior, food & service seriously to compete with the competition! Would not recommend this restaurant until it starts to catch up!"

The interior and terrace are stunning. Super aesthetically pleasing without becoming pretentious. They have a large lunch menu full of sandwiches, wraps, salads and some daily specials. Every time I've gone, I've ordered one of their paninis with a side of their pasta of the day. The food is fresh and yummy and the prices are pretty reasonable. The last time I was there was yesterday (tuesday at lunch) and there was no wait when we arrived at 13:30. Other times I've been, there was a line out the door during the lunch rush. We both enjoyed our meals (both ordered a panini) and shared the medium portion of their pasta of the day (penne arrabiata)My friend ordered their ""famous iced tea"" which she said tasted exactly the same as a nestea but was 4.5$. She wasn't impressed. I've heard that the dinner menu is overpriced so I haven't gone for that reason. I will definitely be back for their delicious lunch menu!"
/user_details?userid=KFsbACIHXQxyff_W6CN1LA,Karen H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Wanted to find a place that still had a terrace on this beautiful sunny fall day. Met up with a friend and was going to grab a cup of Joe. This was our choice since I live in the area. We were seated immediately. It's a busy place with people of all ages. Music was playing in the background and we were content sitting in the sun. We decided to have salads which were quite summery and refreshing. Endives, sliced apples, blue cheese with cranberries and  walnuts. Everything was fresh and the vinaigrette was subtle to balance out the taste. Huge variety of salads, sandwiches and appetizers for a quick nosh if that's what you are looking for. Ended our conversation with a espresso  and a smile with good company."

The pasta was also very good. If you love cheese you'll love this pasta. Only negative is that the restaurant is quite small so felt crowded. However I did go on a Saturday and on a night of a hockey game!
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"A cute café in Westmount, with a nice ambience, and especially now, it has a nice Christmas vibes. At lunch hour, the place got packed very fast after our arrival. Since it was busy, later on the service was very slow. You had to find your waitress in the crowd to grab her attention. I took the specials of the day. Cauliflower cream soup and stuffed Ricotta cannelloni. Sadly, my soup was miserable because it was completely bland. The texture was perfect but the taste was a letdown. I didn't finish it. My pasta dish was very dry. The stuffing was sticky in my mouth. The rosé sauce was dried up. And the taste was also bland, I slightly made it better with pepper and chili flakes. Overall, it was a sad disappointment... in the end by stomach wasn't feeling to well, I assume from the dryness of my pasta dish. As for my bill, our waitress was notified about the mix up few items between my friend and I. She seemed frustrated that I was correcting her mistake. She was overcharging me, and she didn't apologize. It was annoying."
/user_details?userid=AlFxYJyuocOcZJEH7S1NyA,Steve P.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"If I was ever in the area, I would make sure to go to the original cafe on Parc, and was very excited to hear that a second cafe opened up so close to home. I went to the Westmount cafe around 5pm, when only one table was occupied and the inside was vacant. It was my anniversary and my wife and I decided to get takeout and go have a picnic on the mountain, so we ordered 2 veal cutlet sandwiches and 2 small salads for takeout from a bald waiter who seemed a little too cool for school. We paid and I waited for  the food while my wife waited in the car. After watching the Uber Eats people pickup bag after bag, I then realised I had been waiting for 20 minutes. It wasn't busy enough to have a couple simple sandwiches take that long so I patiently asked the waiter of my food was close to being ready, and I got a little sass and was told it was being made. Obviously.After another ten minutes on no action and the waiter having completely disappeared, I asked another guy if he could check on it, which he did, and said it was being bagged. Another ten minutes (now 40 total) the bag came out and was given to me hastily and curtly as if I had been some outrageously impatient a-hole. Before leaving, I made sure  to check the bag to see if all was good, despite being told it was. No cutlery! And now no staff around, so another 3 or 4 minutes to get that in order to leave. Not a great start to our night and definately a sign to never go back to that place again. The place on Parc has charm and an old world feel, with a pleasant and welcoming staff......and never a wait more than a few minutes. What a far cry this Westmount cafe is from its Parc namesake. Shame!"

I had the chicken and barley soup (soup of the day) and a prosciutto and arugula sandwich. The soup was absolutely delicious- especially on such a cold day. My boyfriend ordered some fresh pasta with a gigi sauce as an appetizer and a chicken and arugula sandwich. The pasta appetizer was the perfect size and his sandwich was even tastier than mine. The service was friendly and quick, and the inside was very quaint and cozy. We came in at around 12:30pm for lunch and by 1:15 the restaurant was pretty full.I would definitely recommend and I cannot wait to go again!"

The location is very nice nice inside , very cozy, pretty and clean. Great place for a casual meal or casual date. We were greeted by friendly staff. I had the spicy chicken cutlet sandwich , it was delicious , juicy tasty chicken in fresh bread , you cant go wrong!  You can tell there was alot of care put into the sandwich. The prices were mid range so not too bad and the portion was pretty big.  I really enjoyed the food and the service and I can safely say I enjoyed my experience. I would recommend this place for anyone craving a really good sandwich , I cant wait to go back and try more (not to mention their desserts looked SO good :) ! So I would love to try some of those as well )"

It was very good, and their hot sauce was just the right spice.Service was ok, it was super busy and people lined up to get in."
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"I love Cafe Gentile for brunch or lunch, more so than dinner. Their lunch menu is so packed with drool-worthy options that I have a hard time deciding. Their evening menu is quite short, with pasta or meat as their specialities. So I just find that it's more worth it for brunch or lunch.On my first visit, I ordered the cocktail of the day ($14), polenta fries ($7), beet salad w/ extra grilled chicken ($21) and tiramisu ($7). The polenta fries were delicious and the chicken breast was cooked to perfection. However, the salad was too small to be a meal salad, and it was flavourless. The blueberry puree gin cocktail (which the waitress sold me on) was really bland and overpriced. The tiramisu was ok at best. And there was the issue of not being quick enough to refill our water. Keep in mind, this wasn't a Friday or Saturday night and yet it was still packed!So, I decided to give this place a chance for lunch and I've now been back three times. I will definitely go back for that chicken cutlet sandwich! Their lattes are perfection, whether iced or hot. Stick to the arugula salad or fries as your side (at an extra cost).The people I've brought here have all exclaimed that it's one of the best coffees they've ever had and love the sandwich. On my most recent visit, I tried the ricotta pancakes and fell in love. I will be back!"

It feels like a nice neighbor staple hangout but wit really nice ambiance that isn't too fancy for everyday hangs. I loved the diversity of the menu and the service!

My friend told me that they have better food selection at noon, but I took a $20 pasta and wasn't satified because I was still very hungry. price wasn't worth the food to be honest. Service was meh, the waitress was super nice at first but she changed her vibe right after we have all ordered our plates.. which is odd. (Maybe it's because we didn't order any drinks or she had a bad day). I would come back but during lunch time instead. Their desert seems to be delicious from what I've seen from my neighbor table. PS- they have a terrasse!"
/user_details?userid=lXkPaVcaqFBBH5bDDf0W1Q,Cassandra R.,"Châteauguay, Canada",4 star rating,Excellent Italian food at a relatively good price. Would recommend the lunch menu instead of the breakfast/brunch menu as there is a greater variety of options available. The breakfast menu is still incredible however.

I ordered the famous chicken cutlet sandwich with salad and my best friend ordered the pasta dei campione (tagliolini, mushrooms, grana Padano and fried egg). The sandwich was good, but the pasta was AMAZING. I had to convince my friend to go half and half with my sandwich so I can eat half of his pasta LOL. That's how good it was ! I was also a little woozy off their cocktails (so strong, I love it!), probably made the dishes taste even better haha. I almost ordered another bowl of pasta."

Great food on both ends however.For dinner at the downtown location I ordered the bruschetta to start things off and split the Sunday Lunch for Two which consisted of meatballs, sausages, and beef ribs laying on top of a bed of pasta with tomato sauce and cheese. Bruschetta was good, and that sausage was great! Of course to wash it all down I took the classic Gentile iced tea.Again, such a difference in both locations or at least lunch and dinner wise but great food throughout. If you're looking for a more casual visit, go for breakfast or lunch."

/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My ""secondi"" visit, was much more enjoyable than my first and for several reasons. For one the company, the food a close second, and rounding out the accolades - much improved service; especially the spirit of our server.Perhaps a sunny morning is a better time to find smiles all around, then an in between lunch and dinner lull - when everyone needs a good coffee. Va bene.Speaking of which this they have and in spades. I was recommended, and followed suit with a cup o' Macchiatoni (has more of a ring to it than Joe, *not sure if I have the spelling right, but is supposedly a tall Macchiato).On the grub side of things, I happened to see someone eating what looked like a frittata, but turned out to be a signature omelette with eggplant, spinach, zucchini, onions, and brick cheese (white), plus sliced tomatoes and olive oil on the side (I usually ask for them instead of potatoes, but here it gladly just is). Before overdoing the focus on the omelette. Its ingredients were very refreshing - as you rarely find that combo elsewhere. I'd get it again and recommend it for sure.The only petite woops, was my toasted bagel on the side was forgotten, however it came right out after I reminded the server. In true Italian fashion my breakfast mate (who had recently taken a barista'ing course) ordered a second coffee before heading out. I felt a little un-Italian, but was pleased that my hand was not shaking from the caffeine As I work my way up to multiple cafés, Gentile Café definitely is at the ready.Now I guess I've got to try them for dinner too. Ciao."
/user_details?userid=1Bljt-GngRP4XxkQFLnHHQ,Rod M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The famous Cafe Gentile has recently opened a new location on Ste Catherine street in Westmount and judging by the line up at the door it has been very well received.  This spot is a great addition to the neighbourhood which lacks good quality, reasonably priced authentic options for lunch. My first experience here was excellent. We did have to wait a couple of minutes for a table as the place was 100% full, but the service was quick,  the food was great and the atmosphere was lively and enjoyable.  I will definitely be a regular.  I order the Tunisian Tuna Sandwich with a Ceasar salad on the side. The sandwich was excellent with the perfect amount of mayo, some egg and a bit of spice to give it a great flavour. My friend had one of the daily pasta specials which was great. We topped it off with a couple of cookies, the biscotti is made by the owner's mom, and a latte. I have to admit that I'm generally not a big fan of biscotti,  but I really enjoyed it here. It was crispy on the exterior,  but when you bite into it the core was just ever so slightly chewy,  which I really enjoyed.  Cafe Gentile has been consistently busy for lunch since it opened. Today we arrived at 12:40 and left slightly after 1:30 PM and there was a line the entire time. So you need to be prepared to wait a few minutes when you arrive. The staff does a good job of politely keeping the table turnover at a good rate, so you should not have to wait to long. The only issue  could be if you are a group of 5 or more as there are only a couple of spots in the restaurant that can accommodate large groups. They also do takeout."

So when I finally made it I had pretty high expectations.We sat on the terrasse but the entire time I was staring st the inside! The walls the bar the pictures, everything is stunning and beautiful. I wasn't very hungry so I only ordered a quick sandwich and a macchiato. The macchiato was delicious, not sure what kind of coffee beans they use but I really enjoyed that it was simple flavourful and not overly bitter like other ""fancy"" coffee shops. The sandwich was a recommendation from the waitress called the Pavarotti. It was a bit pricy at 12$ but delicious none the less. All in all my first experience at Gentile was charming. The decoration was probably my favourite part. I will definitely be returning with an appetite next time, because I want to try more of their food. OH also !!! Try the iced cap! They put gelato into it OMG MY friend had it and I was incredibly jealous that I didn't order it!"

/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I went to cafe gentile twice in one month. The first time my boyfriend and i shared the bruschetta with feta. This was amazing! I've never had bruschetta with cheese before. I guess I shouldn't be too surprised coz cheese makes everything taste better. The bread was crunchy and the tomatoes were cold and fresh and the feta added the right amount of saltiness to it. Then we had the caprese salad. This was a bit disappointing for me. I felt like it was bland so I had to add salt to it and i wish the cherry tomatoes had been colder. On the menu it said that it comes with olives but I did not see any on the plate. We also shared two sandwiches. I picked the Scallopini sandwich and my bf picked the prosciutto cheese sandwich. The Scallopini was prob one of the best sandwiches I ever had and I'm really not a sandwich kinda girl. The Scallopini is made with veal, white wine, sauteed mushrooms, eggplant, red peppers, arugula, Parmesan cheese, and prosciutto with a balsamic reduction. Now that's a sandwich! I loved that it was warm and I loved the sauteed onions and mushrooms with the white wine sauce. I wish there had been more prosciutto because I shared half of the sandwich with the boyfriend and I barely got any. :(  The second sandwich contained prosciutto, lettuce, tomato, eggplant, olive oil, oregano, and bomba, which is like a spread. The sandwich was decent but it wasn't anything special and I felt it was plain. I prefer warm, fancy sandwiches. For dessert we wanted a cannoli but the waiter recommended us this other italian dessert instead. It was basically like a soft donut with a hole in the middle, covered with white powdered sugar and inside the donut was the same filling as a cannoli. It was very good and light. Too bad I do not remember the name of it. :(The second time I went with my colleagues. This time I had the caesar salad with the STK sandwich. The sandwich contained steak, cheese, arugula, caramelized onions, mushrooms, eggplant, goat cheese, with a balsamic Reduction and bomba. It was good but I preferred the Scallopini. I will definitely be back and I highly recommend this cafe.  I'm also curious about their dinner menu.... hmmm next time..."

You can tell they really care about satisfying their customers! I was curious if they would be able to do it as well as they do it on Parc, and with no surprise they do!! Busy and you may have to wait but it's so worth it and the service is quick. AND THEY NOW HAVE DINNER TOO !!!!!!! Best news ever"

Waited for an hour before we got seated, it was pretty packed & they don't take reservations. The good news is that I left this family run italian cafe with the same satiety I feel leaving my grandma's house. The food is so fresh & homemade. Great portions & service.We had their homemade ricotta cheese & eggplant parmigiana to start. For the main dish we had the veal parmigiana with smoked caciacavallo & matchstick fries as well as the seared cod with roasted cauliflower & fennel puree. Their whole dessert menu is insaaane. It includes 3 homemade gelato flavors, homemade tiramisu & biscotti & many more. Gradually working on trying each & every one."

You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The service is fantastic and not at all a pretentious ambiance. Highly recommended, this will also become your new favorite neighbourhood spot!"

It was not until googling the place to find out where it was that I knew about it's "" institution "" level in Montreal. So now I know I'm heading to a spot that's been making sambos + coffee for 48 years. No pressure right ? Ha Ha .I think my roomie and I got in at just the right time after the bizzy lunch rush. Ordered a latte , obviously , yum! It's all about the foam they say and was that foam on point ! I loved the the cocoa on it , it made it look so cute. Now onto to the grub ! The menu was extensive and I really didn't bother reading it all because I knew I wanted to have something classic , a staple , the breaded chicken sandwich. I love cesar salad alot so I regret not getting it on the side but I went with the pasta because the server suggested it as an option. If I were to go back ( and the chances are good ) I'm getting cesar salad !!!!!! SO the sandwich was great chicken moist and krispy yummy. PAsta was good but like I said I had buyer's remorse because of not gettting the cesar salad. We had iced teas also which come in this super cool styrofoam cup that was so cool.  It was like I was getting a fountain soda at a truck stop or something. Loved it. Overall I was a huge fan of the decor and branding of the whole spot. Attention to detail was high. Gentile everywhere on everyone  super love the brand rep."

Make sure to have their famous ice tea when u go. I have been known to sometimes just stop in for one. The menu changes at night and gets a little more formal. Lunchtime it's mostly sandwiches and salads all really good and tasty."

/user_details?userid=KRkHZxyqBHJtUp0_lSIx4Q,Mary Ellen D.,"Albany, NY",5 star rating,We're first time visitors to Montreal and were looking for a restaurant with local flavor and not a tourist attraction. We were all glad we found Cafe Gentile! Every taste of every dish - all the way from the olive oil to the espresso- was absolute perfection. We highly recommend the homemade gnocchi and eggplant parmigiana. Any lover of authentic Italian food will not be disappointed.
/user_details?userid=1gDlsh56kSe4qWf981MNLA,Ardy B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Very pleasant environment with polite and considerate staff.This time I tried Cobb sandwich & Cesar on the side which was juicy & delicious!!The restaurant gives me the Italian mom & pop's joint feeling.You can also order a range of pastas as the side which I found worth trying next time!!Also chicken cutlet is a must as it's their speciality!! A single espresso at the end makes everything fall into the place...

/user_details?userid=qxeQ22buFFq1f4j6vFYXFg,Bass C.,"QC, Canada",1 star rating,"Paid 22$+ for a sandwich that is smaller than a  junior chicken at McDonald's, and at least the chicken at McDonald's is not pre-cooked. The pasta on the side wasn't enough even for a kid! I don't mind paying a lot for a value but this is a total ripoff."
/user_details?userid=s1gXesr20hgoNbdaARPmMw,Ri L.,"Montreal-West, Canada",1 star rating,"Incredibly disappointing. My husband and I walked in and were served by such a rude barista. He was too busy on his cell phone to give us any service. Once he finally looked up, he asked us if we were here to eat or for a coffee. (Not knowing we could only eat from 12-4, 6-10). Once we said food he replied annoyed that we can only have coffee since it was 4:30. We walked out very disappointed. If only we were served with professionalism or at the very least with respect."

The noise level is way too high. Cute decor. Food was disappointing by our table of 4 who eat out regularly. I hear lunch sandwiches are very good. I may be back for lunch but not for dinner
/user_details?userid=t-RMWMDsvCzpPwakr2qIAA,ruthie a.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"After hearing rave reviews from fiends we popped in on a Friday for lunch. The first thing you see is a deli-style display counter, but there is actually quite a bit of seating. Not enough though, this place is very popular! We hit a slight lull and get a table right away. The line seems to move well as staff, although never rude or rushing anyone, do keep the plates moving and the bills arriving. We were there for over an hour and then noticed the line getting longer so we left so that others could enjoy the great food. The staff were so warm and friendly and helpful - not always the case in popular, busy places! The menu is huge! I am a vegetarian and there were so many options for me - salads, wraps, sandwiches, gourmet sandwiches, I am used to just a few ""options"" and this was so exciting! My friend eats very clean - she is a nutritionist, and she loved the menu - you can really indulge or go really healthy. Nice! Everything was delicious and I am eager to return for dinner - there evening menu looks very promising!"
