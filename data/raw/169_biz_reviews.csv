/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The restaurant and the terrace are beautiful. A wonderful place to sit out and enjoy the moment by savoring some delicious bruschetta with a glass of Pinot Grigio. Service would be in low side grading. It was confusing if I should take a sit or I would be assigned to seat and do I order the food in the counter or do I get to order at the table. A waitress saw me, but she kind of ignored me initially. I had to walk to her and ask how this restaurant function ms. Finally, I was seated at terrace. My waitress (different one) came, my food came, which was excellent but I didn't get any utensils and napkins. I requested twice; between the first and second time the waitress forgot about it. Beside the beautiful restaurant and the food, the service was questionable."

I used to go at least once a week for 4 years, then I moved, but I still tell anyone visiting Montreal they have to come here.  The croissant is ligHt, yet buttery, the coffee is perfecto and the Niçoise salad is divine!"
/user_details?userid=MoNnSNAZEAPQ1cuReIFXrA,Ane K.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"I went to this place only once but I left extremely upset by the service given by an older gentleman which seemed to be the manager or owner. My criticism is purely related to customer service approach, since I haven't tasted their food.I was sitting in the terrace. The chair I was sitting on, had a piece of metal detached, right where my buttock was, but I had not noticed. When I got up for a moment, my favourite summer pants happened to get caught by that piece of metal and ended up with a hole. I called the gentleman, explained what happened and suggested him to take the chair away, he said sorry once and took the chair with him. Since there wasn't much reaction, I thought he was busy and would come back eventually.When we requested the bill to the waitress, she brought us the bill and left. We had ordered only 2 coffees and 1 tea, it was not even 15$. I was sad after having my pants ripped, but after receiving the bill I became furious,  since I just got a hole on my pants because of their broken chair and they didn't give an appropriate apology.I called the waitress again, and explained what happened, she was kind and apologized for what had happened, and let the drinks go for free. The other gentleman had not even mentioned the pants situation to her. Although the waitress was nice, I still had a bitter feeling in my mouth because their chair had ruined my favourite pants and in the end, they only let the drinks go for free because we requested. There was not a real attempt to make up for what happened and they couldn't care less for the hole in my pants."

I was really satisfied with it. The pastries are ok, nothing amazing and their choices are pretty standard.The decor does make you feel like you're at a Parisian cafe and since I have no frame of reference to a real Parisian cafe, I'd say they did an ok job.The seating isn't comfortable everywhere. I think the best seats are the booths but those fill up quick for brunch.Ordered the croque monsieur and Adam ordered the burger with bacon and cheese. I thought the croque monsieur was lovely except the sauce had a hint of pepper which I don't like, but Adam loves. Adam's burger was really good. Great patty, cheese. and bacon. We ended up liking each other's meals more actually. I also ordered a chocolate milkshake and it had a great chocolate taste but the consistency was a bit too milky.It's a really nice place to have brunch. Same prices as most other places but a bit more quality."

Ordered the flamqueuche with bacon and onions and sour cream. Looked good on their photos. What I received was a complete embarrassment. I work down the street and everyone was laughing at it. When I called to tell them and replace it with something else, which he said sure to a Croque Monsieur.  When my order was picked up by a co worker ( I am at work and it's pouring rain) 10 min later he was told he made me a ham and cheese instead!  I told him I didn't want that in our conversation prior!  This place is a waste of money and a disgrace to customer service. I want my money back!!  Here are both photos of what they served me for 10 dollars! What a joke!"

Maybe Canadian personal space is closer than US personal space, but we were really close to each other.  Our waitress was extremely patient with us and guided us along the menu.   I had a tofu sandwich which was quite pleasing with a salad.  Now mind you it wasn't stellar, but put me on a lovely street in Montreal in the summer with some decent food and I will give it four stars any day.  I felt like I was in Paris.  Great job!"

No fruits, no toasts. 6 bare eggs, one croissant, one tea, one cappuccino: 39$ and a lousy service. I used to love this place but it has gone south."

/user_details?userid=fi38ETFUNBBndrkKqLqUtA,Tina M.,"Austin, TX",4 star rating,"Figaro, how charming you are! A beautiful blend of art nouveau and deco interior design elements, you try to seem French, and you're quite good at it! You're open late and you're consistent; que demander de plus?Croissanterie Figaro is a nice restaurant and café at the edge of Mile-End and Outermont neighborhoods. Featuring a nice terrace during the summer, I always have a preference for the old-style interior decor. Table service is efficient and courteous. The food is also good, affordable and consistent in quality. They have many vegetarian options and their croissants are very tasty. The coffee is okay; although it is not my favorite I'm the city, it's not bad either. Very acceptable.What I like most about Croissanterie Figaro is that it feels like I'm stepping into France every time I go there, if only for a moment. Minus the plane ticket and the bill that comes with it.I recommend without hesitation!"
/user_details?userid=VMfwMYh8iJapW807Pu1Diw,Jenviev A.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Canada",3 star rating,"The best part of Figaro has got to be its lovely terrace on a late summers afternoon. This is honestly the main reason to come here. Everything else is quite average, but that terrace tho! This place tries to pass off as legit French fare, with croissants, pastries and quiches, but when you've had the real deal, these don't even come close. Especially in Montreal, where there are so many amazing French pastry shops (shout-out to Kouing Aman & Brioche a Tête), Figaro just doesn't make the cut. Figaro is also open quite late, so if you're craving a late night piece of chocolate cake (this regularly happens to me), then Figaro is a good bet. But yeah, the terrace is perfect and totally worth it."

Food was visually very well presented and tasted fresh. We were 5 and we all eat very well. The only thing that could be improved is the selection of take-out pastries, it fell a little flat and not very much variety at 1;30 pm on a Sunday afternoon."

/user_details?userid=JMTr179r5SGHC_rPUBSWfQ,Slavisa M.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"An absolute Montréal gem. I stumbled upon this walking around with a friend in the area and boy was it worth it. Don't be fooled by the name - it is not just croissants, but boy are the croissants amazing. I don't think I've had better crossants outside of Montréal than this (maybe in Montréal i have...). But I digress: it is not only the croissants, it is everything else. They are extremely creative with using different kinds of pastries to make delicious sandwiches and brunch dishes. This is basically a great brunch spot, or a spot to have a relaxing coffee with friends over a tasty pastry. The locale itself is beautiful. It is an old bank and it stell has that (1920s?) bank teller desk where you can see the chef cooking behind it. Overall, very beautiful inside with a great patio ona quiet street yet just a few steps away from Parc Ave. They also have surprisingly excellent coffee. One of my favourites is the latte bowl... You know, for those extra hungover brunch dates."
/user_details?userid=VJgCGi9-eJ0yvL5SG7M1Vg,Ali I.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"This place used to be one of my favourite. But let me explain why it gets two starts.+ Great ambiance, Parisian interior. From here on, all goes down the hill.- Horrible coffee. Even 3-star diners have better coffee than here.- We ordered two almond croissants and one regular croissant. Almond croissants were two fingers wide! (It looked more like a rolled crepe than a croissant) Seriously, if anybody reading this review would try baking croissants they will probably obtain a better shape than them. - The almond pate was not tasty at all. When you order an almond croissant you expect to taste it when you bite it. But it was more like a hide-and-seek with the pate.You can say, ""oh, c'mon. It's just a croissant."" Well, the place is called Croissanterie! They are so behind the game. I suggest them to try Regal Matinal, Hof Kelsten or Myriade - 2's croissants to learn how it should be."
/user_details?userid=5fWXDrxqicWT1-TYF9MbWQ,Adam S.,"Miami, FL",2 star rating,"We were frankly shocked by what a poor experience we had at this cafe. Where do I begin? When we came in, we sat at the table and were immediately sweating. It's October - beautiful out - but inside was like an oven. It was about 2 pm on a Saturday and it was our first meal of the day so we were all starving. For starters, we ordered a cheese plate and a French fries. It took over 20 minutes for these items to come. When they did, half the bread was ice cold, half was boiling hot. The fries were small; so we asked to put in another order but the waitress told us there were ""no more French fries."" Maybe it was for the best because the fries were soggy and unremarkable. When ordering mains, my friend wanted to add a fried egg to her croque monsieur, they told us they couldn't do fried - only scrambled or hard boiled. It then took another HOUR for our very simple lunches to come. My friend and I ordered the burger - medium rare. It arrived burned to a crisp. And the bread was also burned. The drinks were watery and not made correctly. And the waitress had a huge chip on her shoulder, delivering everything to the table with a scowl. On top of all this, when we asked for the check it took another 20 minutes. By the way, it was now close to 4 pm and there was barely anyone else in the restaurant. And, with tip, this meal came close to $40 per person. Terrible food, mediocre service, AND expensive. Would not come back."

It's great if you live by since parking is scarce there. Loved the art deco, very well represented. Has a beautiful terasse to sit & sip a cappuccino or a good coffee. Since it's a croissanterie, we ordered a variety of croissants to taste. Unfortunately they ran out of chocolatine which is unusual in my book when you're at a croissant place especially when it's only 10 am. The other croissants were crispy, buttery & delicious. However, the service was slow & mediocre when you consider what you're paying. Too bad since the location & the café itself is really nice."

This is the place. The cafe has brass and marble finishing and french classics playing in the background. I loved it but always felt hugely indulgent here. Or did I feel hugely sophisticated? I forget....What a divine cafe."

Bad service, she made a mistake on my bill (twice) and our water glasses were always empty. I give the 3 stars for the food itself. We had the croque-madame (with turkey) and the Quiche. The salad that went with it was delicious, with julienne-cut vegetables. The americanos were amazing, not too strong either. I would go back there to try the brunch or breakfast. In sum, this french-like bistro really portrays the ''service'' and food you would have only in the old continent."

/user_details?userid=NDhDMKqSiBc0L06jKlFnmg,Nancy H.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"I used to come to this restaurant a LOT when I attended Marianopolis College and McGill U, from 1978-1983. This was my go-to place for croissants and coffee back in the day, when it was called ""La Croissanterie"" (no ""Figro"" in the name). I was SO relieved to see that the place was still here, on the same corner, with the same kind of Parisienne vibe, and the same cute outdoor terasse. The interior has changed somewhat (I remember it being larger, and more open, but hey, we're going back over 30 years). The food is as wonderful as I remember! Brought my kids here today and we sat outside. The kids had croissants - one regular, one chocolate. They were both in heaven. One kid had a pot of tea and the other, hot chocolate. Again, both were very happy with their beverages. I ordered quiche Lorraine and man, it was good. Can't really get legit quiche in Seattle, and it was a real treat for me. My kids tried it and loved it. And I had my old Montreal standby: cafe au lait, in a bowl. Man, it's good to be back home! Don't want to leave....  (It's really good to have some things the same, as I remember them, as so much in the city has changed, and not all for the better....). Our waitress we had was lovely, and she was happy to speak in English to us.Note: the bathroom in the rear of the restaurant is beyond tiny. Cute, but if you need any room, for any reason, forget about it."

However, it was a little smaller than others and nothing really stood out about it.

I hear the Croissants are to die for (hence the name), but I came here for dinner and had the Croque Monsieur and it was delicious! I also ordered a house salad, and only wish the server had told me that the croque comes WITH a salad so I didn't have to order the starter! For dessert, I had the Profiteroles....note: it's a big a$$ cream puff with ice cream and it's delicious!"

We took a seat in the terrace. It is a normal coffee place, with some alcoholic options as well. There are sandwiches and burgers... all in all I was very happy with the menu. But that happiness was short-lived, thanks to the server. This is a big poonter for all the food service industry... if your servers are impolite and do not like their job, then all your efforts go in vain. That was exactly the xase here. The server was quite disinterested.... served dirty cutlery with cold tea. When I pointed out, she told me that she would come back with new ones. But even after 30 min wait we did not get a replacement! At that point we just asked for the bill and decided to leave."

/user_details?userid=YrugcPqjHGVkrSXpozDowg,Helena K.,"Durham, NC",4 star rating,"Merci bien, dear Yelp app, for yet again leading me to an absolutely lovely place for breakfast.  La Croissanterie Figaro was one of the few locations open early the Sunday morning of my departure from Montréal.  With a few hours to spare before heading the airport, and having been locked inside for days at a conference, I was finally able to indulge my hobby of photography and took a nice long walk from downtown to Outremont, cataloging urban art and street life in pictures along the way.There were only a few other customers when I visited, and I took a nice little seat in the back near the window.  At only eight or so on a Sunday morning, Outremont had barely begun to stir, but otherwise this place would be perfect for people watching.  I did see several people out with their dogs, as well as some runners, and some running groups together, out in the drizzle of the gray late-November morning.  It was rather wonderful, really.The coffee here is spectacular, as is the orange juice.  YUM.  I had the Tofu californien sandwich (see picture) for breakfast and, while it was quite delicious, I was not a huge fan of the bread.  The salad it comes with can be substituted for assorted fruits during breakfast hours (although I stuck with the salad).I sincerely regret that I did not have a croissant here.  But I gain weight at the drop of a pin, so I really have to be careful about things like that.  I do feel that service was rather aloof and, although, I know better than to compare this type of bistro to its counterpart in the US, where the servers are likely to be at your elbow almost constantly, I was not able to get a refill of my water even once.  But, apart from that, it's quite nice to be left alone to my thoughts as I enjoy a tasty meal.  This is a delightful little spot, and I would visit again for sure."

/user_details?userid=nZUsDCm1v1tSJVWJHFEflg,Shin Ling L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"La Crossanterie Frigaro was not as good as expected. The photos of the pastries seemed really great, but the one I had at least, was really average. I got the rum and chocolate croissant. It was lacking the crispiness and the butteriness one would expect a good croissant would have. I feel like it was also a little salty for a sweet croissant, it distracted me from the chocolate. However, if it were for the interior decoration/general atmosphere, I would totally give it a 5/5. You can definitely spend time studying or talking to your partner there. I enjoy cafes with quiet-ish, casual atmospheres and La Croissanterie Frigaro was completely that. You can really tell how much thought and effort the owner put into for the look of the cafe. Sitting outside was also really nice and breezy at night, they also light candles on each tables so that gives a really romantic feel. I liked that I could have a great conversation without being distracted by the surrounding noises. I would go again, perhaps to study or to hang out, but I wouldn't expect much out of their foods."

If I lived next to La Croissanterie Figaro, it would be a daily habit.  On a weekend trip to Montreal, we were on the search for some good pastries and my friend did a fantastic job scoping this place out.A beautiful sunny Sunday morning meant brunch on the cafe patio, which sits on the corner of a quiet Montreal residential neighbouehood. Being here makes you feel like you're in Europe. Quiet and laid back.I ordered the brunch: freshly sqeezed orange juice, tea, fresh fruit, croissant and crepes with eggs, ham, maple syrup. The freshly baked croissant was buttery, crispy, flaky, filled with warm herbed ricotta cheese....MELTS in your mouth.   The crepe is done the way it should be, cooked through, a little crispy not doughy at all...rolled inside is ham and egg. A little dip of maple syrup makes everything that much tastier. All this for $10. So delicious. Beyond comfort and would completely make me a morning person if I lived next door."

I am usually there for brunch or lunch; the food is always delicious and the coffee is very good. I've never had a bad experience with the wait staff but I agree that it can be slow. Sitting under an umbrella on a beautiful sunny day on a flower-lined terrasse - well, all I can say is, what's your hurry? Great location for people watching, a walk along Laurier or in a nearby park. Caution - pay attention to parking signs. Much of the area is permit parking only."

I had met up with a friend, who was also visiting the city and staying nearby, had made breakfast in this beautiful place part of her morning ritual. Seeing the lovely terrace wrapping around the building, the Parisian decor, the red and yellow flowers surrounding the terrace, I easily understood why she loved this place so much. It has a very relaxed atmosphere: no one rushing you to eat quickly and pay up right away. Here, I felt we could take our time enjoying our coffees while basking in the sun and lazily watching the world pass us by. I also believe that since we were visiting during the week, we were able to get a spot on the terrace; I can imagine this place being slammed on weekends. For my first meal of the day, I opted for the Bonjour Croissant, which is basically an open-faced breakfast sandwich, with eggs, tomatoes and cheese on top of a butter croissant. The order comes with fresh fruit, coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice. Everything was delicious, leaving a permanent smile on my face as it was nice way to start to my day. As for the servers not being able to speak English well, all of the servers were able to communicate with ease, judging from my friend's experience who only spoke English to them. As for my experience, I'm able to speak French so I happily practiced my native tongue with them.I have to share with the same sentiment as Yelper Stas Z mentioned previously. If someone is working on the technology to transport one's self from one place to another, please do it soon. A morning without enjoying a coffee at La Croissanterie may not be worth living."

It was recommended to us by multiple people, and we just couldn't pass up a good croissant!Got there and sat outside and kindly waited for our menus and orders and such. I believe that there were two croque monsieurs ordered, one ""brunch"" that came with coffee and lots of brunch items ($10 CAD!!) and I got a soup and a club figaro sandwich (which was a sandwich that had multiple different sliced meats and peppers and tomatoes).In the end, the food was very good.. not knock out of the park but they were extremely satisfying for a group of hungry tourists at 3pm who hadn't eaten lunch (the salad that came with was great! carrot and beet strings and it was very well seasoned/dressed). But the cozy neighborhood atmosphere, eclectically-antique looking interior and a bevy of of bees accosting our brightly colored and aesthetically pleasing food, it made for a great experience and a relaxing (once we moved inside) lunch.Oh, we never ended up getting croissants4.5 stars for good food and a cozy atmosphereRevisit?

Seriously amazing though was THE CROISSANT. It is hands down the best one I have ever had, and I actually ended up eating all the top of my croque-madame (with the ham, the cheese and the bell peppers slices) by itself, to better savour the croissant. Next time, I'll skip the add-ons and go straight to the croissant (it is a croissanterie after all!).The hot chocolate (100% cacao it said on the menu) was lackluster; I'm pretty sure it's made with cacao powder and nothing else, so the watery consistency was off-putting; I like mine a bit thicker, almost like melted chocolate fondu!Also, the inside is really lovely - you do feel transported to another time. One thing though, I went on a cold winter day and insulation was not the best; my coat, against the wall during the brunch, was ice-temperature by the time I put it back on. Definitely will be back to try more of their croissant (I'm eyeing the rhum and chocolate one!) when in the neighbourhood. If you get them to go, the prices are even more of a steal than when you get them at the table (~2-3$, served with jam)."

We ordered croissant and they were chewy and burned. When we try to cut them they stretched so much they almost flew out of our dish. We ordered milkshake too and we got chocolate milk that they put in the blender and came a little foamy. Service was the worst I got in Montreal. We should've read the reviews about how they treat English speaking tourists. We were seated next to the bathroom, the waitress was visible uncomfortable with us. She made us wait at the every step of the process. Didn't even bother asking about how the food was. We noticed she did with other tables but not with ours."
/user_details?userid=0Dc2P4wl36rfP_KYt9_-3g,Mirella I.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I do not know how this place gets good reviews. I ordered an ""exotic salad"" only to get a plate full of salad leaves of poor quality that were uncut that literally looked like the chef had slapped a few leaves on a plate. On top of those leaves were 3 cantaloupe slices and full slices of prosciutto ham all PILED ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER. On the side of the salad, was a brie cheese slice. The dressing was some sort of ranch white gross liquid. I honestly did not know how to eat that salad. It looked absolutely unrefined. For a person who has dined in Paris, I think that this particular restaurant SHOULD NOT BE MARKETING THEMSELVES AS A FRENCH RESTAURANT. In addition, for a place that is called Crossanterie, you would think their croissants are at least good. NO, apparently, that too is too much to as for. The sizes of their croissants are small and are priced at $3 for something the size of your toes!Food quality is the worst I have ever seen. The presentation of the food is terrible. The pricing is exaggerated and unfair. The waitresses are snobby and unapproachable. The only nice thing about this place is the terrace, full of plants and nice-looking tables. But it is not worth it. You can find a restaurant with good food and a good terrace.If you have any human dignity, stay away from this place!"

The immediate vision upon entry is one of splendid light and airiness; sunlight streaming in through the many windows of the lustrous dining salon refracted off the mirrored walls and set all the polished brass agleam. Settling back into the far corner following the leggy fille of a hostess, we were awash in a sweet symphony of French and the tinkling of cutlery tines...I was already in love and hadn't even eaten a nibble. As suspected though, the food turned out to be on par with the quality of the ambiance. I thoroughly enjoyed my great coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice spangled with pulp (just the way I like it), and the excellent brunch options, of which I chose Le Special Bonjour, which was perfectly delicious and priced appropriately. I also couldn't help getting croissants to go, and I will simply echo others' praise here- flaky, buttery, authentic scrumptiousness.

We had planned to stop for a coffee and croissant just because of great reviews. Due to time of day we ended up having lunch instead. Very disappointing.We had a small table on the terrace. The tables are so close together we literally could not even into our seats. Please note we are not giants. Once in we could not move. Really I think they could get rid of a couple tables to at least allow customers to move.My wife order a salad. That was fine but nothing special. I ordered a sandwich which was supposed to have grilled chicken, tomato, goat cheese, avocado and pesto. Sounded great. I had it on a baguette. It was a small warm sandwich with a little salad on the side. The sandwich was terrible. It had hardly anything in it and what was there was almost indistinguishable. Where the cheese and avocado were I have no idea. There was a little bit of chicken present. Ok so there was not a lot of stuff. What matters is how it tastes. Well it did not taste good at all. It seem like all pesto goop. Soon after it was served the bread had become saturated in the green goop. It was really unpleasant. I should have sent it back.The waitress ask me at end of meal if I enjoyed everything. I explained to her how I felt about the sandwich. She said she was sorry to hear that. But did nothing to remedy the situation or to compensate. We were planning of having coffee and dessert but our golden rule is when things go bad in a restaurant we cut our loses and stop ordering anymore food.$35.00 for a salad and a sandwich. If you love it that is fine but when you do not enjoy it, it is a lot to pay. There may be other things on menu that are great but after my experience today we will not be back."

/user_details?userid=-S2tlyUUAUl6mE_A-8MUzw,Judd S.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Yes, the Croissanterie does have a lovely, quiet terrace, and the interior atmosphere reminiscent of Vieux-Paris is unmatched anywhere in Montreal; the food is also quite good and prices reasonable. When I last visited, however, I found their terrace filled with extra umbrellas with beer ads emblazoned on them. I am picky about my surroundings, and this does not hold up to standards. I understand they wanted to add shade to their terrace, hence the supplemental umbrellas; but they did not need to go the cheap route and get the subsidized ones with ads on them. This smacks of classlessness and poor taste. The effect was to enclose the terrace so much that it wound up feeling almost like an interior room. Notches down on rating.It is often said that this place reminds people of Paris; perhaps, but the one thing that makes you aware that you are not in Paris is the amount of English spoken here; much more than in many other places in Montreal. It also has a very antique vibe; yes, like a café from the 1920s, but it also just as well might be the 1970's. The crowd matches that vibe, painfully unhip. The table next to us was comprised of Americans; a 65 year old dude that weighted 400 pounds and an ancient grandma with a walker. It is clear you are not alone in knowledge about this place. There is nothing modern or remotely hip about this place...and so you probably know what the coffee is like. Burnt. Probably would be quite good if it were 1975, but today, this does not stand up to the 49th Parallels of the world. Alas, I also got a stomache ache here once from a croissant with fromage. I still come back because it is an institution, and a pleasant one at that. One of the best features is that they are open past midnight...so if you want a late night snack and chill atmosphere, this is one special spot."

Figured they needed to work on their English more than I need to work on my French. You can pretend you are in Paris, but it only works one way. You would never go to Paris and pretend you are in Montreal."

/user_details?userid=jyQ7Wtx936CaklmHNo9dfg,Rahul S.,"Cupertino, CA",5 star rating,We had brunch here recently. I'd say 4.5 stars for both food and service. A little out of the way from montreal - you need a car to get here. I'd definitely come here on my next visit to montreal.

It's a Parisian-style cafe with simple food, very friendly staff and excellent croissants. We had the quiche provencal, croque monsieur and chocolate mousse cake for lunch and got three croissants to go. (FYI, we had to order the croissants separately from the counter.) You can't really go wrong with their croissants, but our favorites were the almond and chocolate. Mmm!"
