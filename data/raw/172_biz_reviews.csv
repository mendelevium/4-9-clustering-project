/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I continue to love this place, and it's been helping me get through these many months at home. In our past lives on Tuesdays we often went to the theater and then ate at Shawarmaz after. The pandemic version of that is ordering Shawarmaz on Uber Eats and watching a movie at home, and it's not a bad substitute! The food is consistently tasty and they have probably my favorite garlic potatoes and garlic sauce of all the similar restaurants in MTL. I much prefer the sauce to the one at Boustan. I also like that you can sub the salad for tabbouleh with no extra charge. Really love the spicy sauce they have which you can add on for I think $0.50. Every Tuesday we look forward to our mixed platters, probably too much (it's the simple pleasures during a pandemic really.)  The chicken and the shawarma are both well spiced and cooked well. The other things they have are good too of course. The famous Poutine Magique was one of the first things I ate in Montreal and holds a special place in my heart. The sushi is lighter than a whole platter and also very tasty. When I want a little extra I also add on some sujuk because that was the first meat I had in a platter and it was excellent. In person service is very fast, and delivery service is no different. It's normally not more than 30 minutes between when I order it and when it arrives to my place near Place des Arts. Don't be thrown off by a restaurant in the back of a Subway sandwich shop. It's 100x better than Subway."

We ordered the Magic Poutine that comes with Garlic Potatoes instead of regular fries & a Mix Shawarma Plate that included sliced beef & chicken with a side of Garlic Potatoes, Rice, Salad, Garlic Sauce & Hummus. We ordered through Uber Eats & received the food within 30 mins. Everything was excellent. Taste, quality of ingredients and portions were all 10/10. Would definitely recommend this spot!"
/user_details?userid=iVXISIgh-unsJz57-qOHTQ,Sheryl L.,"Candiac, Canada",5 star rating,"I'm a lover of shawarma but this is something else!There's a lot to choose from, from a normal chicken pita to a garlic potato poutine to a chicken sushi plate.I ordered a small chicken pita, a sushi plate that comes with garlic potatoes, The chicken Shawarma and the  magic poutine.(yes,it's actually called the magic poutine)The chicken pita was good it comes in two sizes a small and a large pita because I took so much stuff I took the small which was really good with the sauce. Every bite had some chicken,onion and garlic sauce.The sushi place it was really good a little messy but still good. Unfortunately, the chicken Shawarma was a little dry.The garlic potatoes on its own we're missing a little bit of seasoning and juiciness and the chicken was a little bit dry. The main reason I give this place a five star is because of the magic poutine. You can have a choice of just beef or just chicken or a combination of both.The combination of the garlic potatoes with the tahini sauce and the special pomegranate sauce creates a delicious sweet yet tangy sauce! the crunchy pita bits that they put on top gives it a nice crunch and they put a handful making sure to go around the whole plate so you get some crunchiness in almost every bite! There are two sizes a small and a large. If you take a large you'll definitely have leftovers for the next day.The staff is very nice, if you have questions they take time to explain, they also don't get snippy when you ask for more garlic sauce or hummus. This place is open till 3am which makes it PERFECT for a midnight snack and definitely worth the drive for me to go from south shore to mtl !!!"

Their portions are really fair for the price they charge ($28 for the whole thing) and you get to choose from a dozen of sides, appetizers and condiments. The food: the kebabs were tasty but dry, potatoes were not fresh and tasted weirdly, hummus was a bit bland, the rice was good, cheese pies were yum and I can't say anything about the salad because I didn't even try it - can't stand turnips and pickles.Overall, I liked the place but I am not amazed. Not the best middle eastern place tho."

Garlic potatoes are to die for. Comes with Hummus.Chicken Shawarma wrap was also great.DO NOT LEAVE THE CITY WITHOUT TRYING THEIR MAGIC POUTINE! Garlic potatoes, cheese curds, gravy, your choice of meat and crunchy pita flakes topped off with parsley and sesame come together to form a confluence of favors that cannot be described. Best meal in the city."
/user_details?userid=hwSSM8Jn29dXRW4ym-roDQ,Mel T.,"Hoboken, NJ",4 star rating,"Came in for a late bite on a Sunday night at around 10:30, when our original option was closed. This was also conveniently located a few blocks from our hotel. We ordered the Mix Plate ($12.49 - Slices of Marinated Chicken and Beef , with our Special Pomegranate and Tahini sauces on top. Served with rice, potatoes and salad with Garlic Sauce & Hummus. It's no 53rd and 6th from NYC, but it was pretty darn good! Make sure you ask for extra garlic sauce because that was what made the plate. One platter was shared amongst two people and it was enough.The inside of the store is also pretty clean, so that was a major plus!"
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"What an absolutely wonderful place! WOW! How is it that I've worked in the area for over 10 years now and for various reasons have never tried this Lebanese restaurant? For starters, the logo of the establishment conjures up an image of a chain restaurant, possibly from Ontario, serving up derivative food in an attempt to capitalize on the Montreal Amir/Basha/Boustan culture of Lebanese fast food. The fact that they are co-tenants in a bizarre 2 for 1 space with a Subway only reinforced that belief. I was very wrong.I've now read the reviews extolling the virtues of the ""magic poutine"". I'll definitely try it soon, but for today, I had to start with the standard mixed chicken and beef plate. I want to taste the individual ingredients and establish a baseline for the purpose of comparison.While the chicken and beef were likely not as perfect as Boustan can be on a good day, they were extremely tasty and quite moist. You can taste certain mild spicing in the meat (cardamom?) which sets it apart from other places and tells me that this food is prepared with love. The potatoes were perfect, and the basmati rice was a nice departure from the regular variety to which I'm accustomed. What I really enjoyed was the variety of fresh salads you get to choose from as well as the pickles, onions, and hot sauce you can opt to include in your plate. It's a really delicious plate with a homemade vibe to it.Finally, the most important element of any fast food Lebanese restaurant is their garlic sauce. This can make or break a Shawarma plate for me. The sauce here was really strong and delicious. It was also nice and fluffy rather than the mayonnaise-like consistency that Amir puts out.This restaurant is a hidden gem AND it's right next to my office. Score! I see a magic poutine in my not too distant future."
/user_details?userid=5zbOaHWqMOhy0G4kEg9wKg,James R.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5 star rating,I fell in love with the chicken sushi shawarma from Shawarmaz. It became one of my favorite places in Montreal. The chicken was cut fresh and cooked well paired with great sauces and a light wrap. The rice was also pretty good. For the price you really can't get a better spot!
/user_details?userid=DRxt228GYEkzoRFhGWdiig,Kristen C.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"EAT HERE!! This place is epic!! Great bang for your buck and it's soooo good! After a few days of being in Montreal I began to miss NYC halal food. I found this place on recommendations and was a little confused as it is attached to a subway, but pay no mind to all of that!! This place is great and I wish I had an endless stomach to keep eating this food.I got the chicken shawarma plate which comes with chicken, rice, potatoes, a salad (I got tabouleh), hummus, and garlic sauce, and pita- ONLY $12!! I also got the magic poutine with beef and it was also excellent. I got it with spicy sauce, which isn't spicy but has a more potent flavor. It is a cool spin on a classic poutine and they add some cool crisps on top that really seals the deal. The meat is all super tender and tastes great. I love shawarma and this place made me very happy. Super friendly staff and you really can't go wrong coming here on your travels. Montreal has some pricey spots that are great, but they also have a lot of cheaper priced foods that are excellent as well. I barely ate 1/4 of each plate and I'm stuffed. Save some money and get some great halal here!"

I would advise against taking anything not shawarma related (we tried the mixed grillades which was very disappointing, low quality of meat and a tiny portion) however, the magic poutine is truly magical! We get the large mixed shawarma magic poutine to share and it is probably enough for 3-4 people or as a meal for 1-2! Delicious fried garlic potatoes, juicy shawarma, lots of cheese and sauce and topped with their special sauce and toppings! Highly recommend!"

/user_details?userid=0dAclgpNIO90XCNwplkhmw,Sj C.,"Reno, NV",5 star rating,"I ate here twice on my visit.  Many of my travel mates were not really adventurous eaters and did not want to eat any Meditteranean food (my city does not have any good places) so even though this is a fast/casual place sharing space with subway I though the menu was appealing and it was the highest rated within a mile of my hotel, I made sure to stop by. The first meal I had a large grilled combo plate.  Chicken, steak, kofta, and sujuk on top of salad, pickles, rice, and potatoes.  Everything except the kofta was delicious, the kofta was just a bit bland for my liking.  There was enough food for at least 3 hungry people, I had lots of leftover.The 2nd visit was right before going to the airport.  It was right as they opened so the chicken was not quite ready so I went with beef shawarma in the big homemade lavash style bread and a side of falafels.  The thinly shaved beef was moist and flavorful and I loved the texture and chewiness of the bread/wrap.  The falafels were crispy and seasoned really nicely inside.  My reluctant friends were envious of my food at the airport. ha."

They also make their special magic poutine. Prices are decent. A good place to eat if you're shopping downtown and want shawarma. Don't settle for basha or Amir.

They give lots of meat which is a plus. My only complaint is for a swarma I felt the price was a little bit high. I paid $10 with tax whereas in other place that would be $6-7 ish. Other than this price issue, I am a complete fan of this place."

/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Went with their chicken shawarma pita and fattouch salad. I was offered a small or big pita and opted for the small one considering the high price I was looking at. Sadly their small pita is quite small and their large one is the average size one.... well at least to me. I guess this is a nice way to make a few extra bucks. Despite its size the small pita was quite good minus the turnips, the ingredient I specifically requested NOT to add and clearly was ignored.The fattouch salad was a huge miss. First of all, no pita chips! Ummm, how does this work?? A fattouch to me is not a fattouch without the crispy pita chips. I understand putting them ahead of time in the big tray may render them soggy but at least add it before you serve it? What is going on? Secondly the fattouch salad was faaaaaar too acidic and the acidity completely overwhelmed the salad. I couldn't taste any of the ingredients. Lastly, there should be a limit how much mint you need to put here... daaaamn. All I tasted was the acidic taste and far too much mint. 2/3 of the salad bowl went straight into the garbage. Not worth the calories.A 2 star rating seems tough but this lunch cost $14 and really left to be desired at that price-tag. I'd go back one day to try out their meats and completely ignore anything else on their menu.I cannot trust anyone people who make bad fattouch salads."

/user_details?userid=Dfu-NuG1YWB96jjBLIlsrA,Krysten I.,"Honolulu, HI",3 star rating,"I had my first experience eating poutine at Shawarmaz and I can't say that I'm a huge poutine fan now..... They have magical poutine on the menu, so obviously I had to try that. Get a small though, because a large is too big to even share between two people. The poutine starts off with huge scoops of fried potatoes, the pretty thick cut variety. Then comes the chicken, curds and gravy. The whole things is then topped off with a cream sauce and some chopped parsley. I'm not the hugest fan of parsley, but it definitely added some necessary color (and nutrients) to the meal. Overall, I thought the whole thing was very salty and the chicken was really dry. I couldn't finish even half of my portion.... The servers were.... efficient. Borderline rude, but I've kind of noticed that about more than a few places I've been to in Montreal, unfortunately. I don't think I'll be back. I don't even want to order poutine from anywhere else anymore after this experience."

The first few bites are pretty amazing, with the distinct taste of shawarma and tender chicken filling your mouth. The garlic potatoes really go well with cheese and gravy. And the cheese was squeaky, so you know its fresh!We both ordered a medium size plate, which was ambitious of us... The food quickly became too salty and overwhelming. We each finished about half a plate before giving up. The rest was packed up and taken home. I actually ate the rest this morning - again, the first few bites were soooo good!Note: Shawarmaz shares a space with Subway. The poor Subway worker seemed terribly bored... All the customers were heading to Shawarmaz!"

I have had poutine only a handful of times, but this was by far my favorite. We had the magic poutine with garlic potatoes, an assortment of meat and topped off with fried pita chips which gave the dish great texture. We also order the shawarma plate and the soujouk. The soujouk was more flavorful, but both dishes were dry. The shawarma plate and the soujouk come with rice, potatoes, salad, hummus and garlic sauce. These dishes were large and left us with plenty of leftover. I would not recommend the spinach puffs which were too doughy and bland in flavor.  Delivery took over 45 mins, but the food came warm."

Excellent location facing Dorchester Square in the  middle of everything. Staff are multi-lingual, I had no problem ordering here in English.*Chicken Shawarma: We ordered the small size which was of excellent value (we wanted to share a poutine in addition to the shawarma). The fillings are very fresh, the sauce is tangy yet not overpowering. Overall a very balanced satisfying chicken shawarma wrap.*Falafel Poutine: I saw this not on the regular menu, but on the side as a special. The size of this is huge, and the potatoes are actually square-cut then fried - they are not long French Fries. The entire thing is doused in very copious amounts of gravy which is more Mediterranean flavored than the traditional Quebecois poutine gravy, which was a nice touch. Falafel balls were some of the best I've had - beautifully spiced, excellent chewy texture, generous amount for the money.It's been a while since I've been to this good of a shawarma place, and the fact that it serves up a mean interpretation of poutine makes it even more awesome.

If there was one thing I would recommend, it would be the soujouk magic poutine. The flavour was just perfect, not too salty and just the right amount of spices. The portions are pretty large, so you might be okay with just getting a small. They add parsley, cheese curds, garlic potatoes and top it off with their gravy. I've tried other plates, but I would say this is probably one of their best.If you're going during lunch hour or dinner time, you'll likely end up waiting.

But the service is amazingly terrible, and the people there are in dire need of an attitude check. I ordered the magic poutine and a chicken shawarma. They got that simple order wrong and then tried to play it off like it's what I ordered and that shawarma are always beef... Like I don't know what a shawarma is. Perhaps it's because they're not used to black folks there, but it was absolutely odd and condescending. Anyway after asking them to redo the order, they give me my food begrudgingly and don't include any forks, napkins or otherwise in my takeout bag. On to the food: the magic poutine is plentiful and savoury. I had the beef version for $10. The chicken shawarma  was $7. They were both pretty good, but perhaps overpriced for regular consumption. Really disappointed by the service and cleanliness of the joint though. Could have easily been 5 stars otherwise."

There was a bit of a wait time with only one employee managing all the orders but worth the wait. I ordered the beef shawarma pita, sujok pita, manic poutine and some potatoes with their spicy garlic just to sample a bit of everything. All were delicious!! They're also very generous with the meat which is a plus for me. I've had a LOT of shawarmas in my lifetime from MULTIPLE places across Canada and States and this place knows what they're doing.

When I had a chicken shawarma for lunch, I found the garlic sauce far too overpowering and strong for my liking, although the price was definitely very reasonable for the portion.Staff are very polite and speedy with getting everyone's orders and food ready quickly.

/user_details?userid=1lRbzzJ5yXGq6K0CpUCbMw,Chris B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Once upon a time I couldn't tell my shawarma from my taouk but Montreal certainly does not lack for Lebanese food.  As it turns out, the whole hummus, falafel, tabbouleh thing squares up pretty good against a traditional north american diet.  I mean they've got potatoes, bread and meat that's being barbecued...vertically! Which is certainly good news since there's practically as many shish taouk places as there are Starbucks.Shawarmaz caught my eye not only because it's close to the office, but it doesn't have that sketchy look about it that so many of the kebab places around the city seem to have.  That's not to say it isn't odd, because while they apparently have an advertising budget that afforded them a fancy sign, the restaurant is in the back of a Subway Sandwich shop. In a way, being in the back of a Subway can be spun as an advantage.  If the shawarma isn't looking too appealing, a 6"" or foot long is right at hand.Prices are in line with other lunch spots nearby at about $10 a head.  The plate of food is huge.  I'm not exactly an expert on the cuisine, but I've always enjoyed it.  The chicken wasn't dried out, the potatoes were well-seasoned and probably most telling is that the fresh salad actually seemed fresh.  Sure it's not 5-star cuisine, but it's falafels and kebabs, more or less the Lebanese hamburger.What cemented this spot in my arsenal of downtown lunchtime dives was the staff. Believe it or not they were actually friendly.  Not really the Lebanese McDonald's, maybe more like the Lebanese Wendy's. Anyways at the very least it beats the shopping mall food courts that saturate the area."

Everything in this poutine worked really well together especially the pita chips which bring a crispy texture and something I haven't seen in poutine before.

I would return for sure because I'd like to try their regular menu.  I can honestly say that they have the best garlic potatoes i've had in the city. Mushy center, but crisp on the outside, perfectly seasoned. Miam !Only downer of the Poutine Magique was the sauce; I found it to be a little bit too salty and cold when served, but I might just be unlucky that time. Other than that I had a great experience .

The falafels are amongst the best in the city and they are always fried up to order, never just sitting there in the heated buffet. Below is the previous review I had on this place before they radically improved. I had rated them a 3 star but they have now earned my 5 star. I want to give this place a higher rating so bad but I can't after the 3 last visits. The fist time I went there they had no beef shawarma. Kinda disappointing considering their name is Shawarmaz. But the chicken shawarma was really good. My second and third visit I had the opportunity to get the beef shawarma and it was really good. The potatoes are amazing, you can't go wrong with them. The only reason I am giving such a low rating is the service is really slow. As soon as the staff saw 6 people walk in, all hell broke loose. I was scrambling in the line up to get someone's attention to remind them that i wanted potatoes and that my shawarma has been on the hot plate for way too long."

The taste is particular and different from the usual poutine as it is much less greasy but none of the less still quite acceptable by The Almighty Poutine standards. Decent quantity but somewhat expensive explainable by the palpable freshness of the ingredients. The amount of chicken on the chicken poutine was somewhat disappointing though!P.S.

It was too greasy and the chicken had a weird taste to it, not the typical Lebanese chicken i've had in other places. I don't know if it was because it was the end of the day and they just gave me old chicken (they gave me scraps i was watching when they made my sandwich) and my sandwich didn't have much garlic sauce so it was bit dry (except for the excess grease that was coming out of the chicken).

Would definitely come here again when I visit and try some other items on the menu. The only fault I found was the tzaziki sauce, it was just plain yogurt- which was really gross to dip into."

/user_details?userid=RxPndFw7sdSX4hWMbIJBGQ,Philippe G.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,Practical because it's next to my office. But not disappointed by the food. Always good but a bit on the greasy side. Had the shawarmaz twice and it was good and filling. Garlic potatoes are also always a hit. Just don't eat there if you have any important meetings in person after. Next thing to try is the poutine which came highly recommended.

/user_details?userid=HrpbtaAgvWHamJjfisJRXg,Fahd C.,"Knoxville, TN",4 star rating,"Very tasty, fresh food. We tried chicken poutine and beef shawarma, which were both great. Portions are huge and pricing is economical. There can be a wait, but the food is all prepared directly in front of you and you can see all the staff working busily. Of course it is not the healthiest option."

Chicken was moist, very flavourful and fresh. Portions were more than I could eat so enjoyed the leftovers today. I would definitely recommend this place. The servers were kind and friendly."
/user_details?userid=_b6u_JPQU3TwG4vQdCO23A,Roland F.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,The poutine magic is definitely real - the savory flavors of the potatoes and gravy were balanced out by the acidity in the garlic sauce. A very filling and flavorful dish that's a pretty neat twist on regular poutine!
/user_details?userid=wCFcislkveq-fbgxLSWdDw,Molly E.,"Washington, DC",2 star rating,"Maybe it's because I was sober, but I wasn't impressed by this place. The chicken in my pita was super dry and hard and I felt like he was really stingy with the toppings. The pita also lacked sauce and flavor and seemed expensive given the size. I wouldn't come back."

One of the greatest things ive ever had.  Definitely check them out"
/user_details?userid=cDm0-7i91UyjJoM6et819g,Joe T.,"Traverse City, MI",5 star rating,You have to walk into a subway restaurant to get to this place but don't be confused. Although these restaurants are in the same building that is where the similarities end.  I ordered the chicken shawarma and my wife ordered the chicken curry. She very quickly wished sh had order what I did. Huge plate with excellent flavor and authenticity.
/user_details?userid=EShM4nMozfuo9qom5po8YQ,Damon S.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,What can I say? The food was amazing. Very inexpensive for the copious amounts of food they give you. Prepared right in front of you quickly. My wife had the Taouk Plat and the chicken was moist inside and crispy outside. It was perfectly seasoned. Served with an awesome veggie side and hummus and garlic sauce to die for. I went with the shawarma pita combo and was not disappointed either. Lots of meat and filling made a perfect meal for a medium hunger.
/user_details?userid=hEg4LMBjywhmpAn7IHRBaQ,Zain F.,"Flushing, NY",5 star rating,"I am from nyc, where shawarmaz can be found on every other block and let me tell you, this place by far has the best shawarmaz I ever had. No question. I was NOT in the hunt for a shawama joint, but came across this place as we were walking to our hotel and decided to give it a try. I ordered the chicken shawarma which was crispy, light and just amazing. I chose the garlic paste over the hummus (which I think really made the shawarma amazing). My friend ordered the mixed-plate and I couldn't help but pick on his food. It was just amazing. I never had potatoes seasoned to such perfection as this place did. The mixed platter is DEF the way to go. It has everything and does not leave you feeling like a trans fat oily mess. If and when I go back to visit Montreal, I will definitely be making a trip here."

/user_details?userid=5E2Ifac8WgjX8GpcJZY9ww,Shreya P.,"Holliston, MA",4 star rating,"I visited Shawarmaz on my first evening in Montréal, and I was very impressed. I had their shawarma plate, with beef, potatoes, rice, and a salad. The whole plate was delicious. The flavors mixed well, and I liked the salad dressing. My two main complaints were that the beef was a bit dry, and the portion sizes were massive where the plates were small. I couldn't finish my plate because the serving size was too large, but what I did have was delicious. Would definitely recommend."

They assume that you have been there and are very curt when they ask you questions. I wouldn't care if the service was better but their food wasn't even good. Place looked dirty and the shawarma plate was super dry

/user_details?userid=xv8T22BGxZyQUU6DYk29MA,Samer E.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I only had the beef. Best beef shawerma in Montreal. The lebanese ""mar'ook"" bread they use in their special sandwiches is awesome. And you have the option of no lettuce and adding parsley, tomatoes, onions, and tahini sauce...like how an authentic beef shawerma is supposed to be. I really don't know what's up with shawerma places in Montreal putting lettuce in their shawermas. They don't do that anywhere else in the world. TO ALL ARABIC RESTAURANTS IN MONTREAL...LETTUCE IS A BIG NO NO IN SHAWERMA."

The first time I ordered I had to callback 3 times. I took 1.5 hours to get to my door. The second time, I had to callback after 2pm because they don't deliver yet... they answered the phone to tell me that and it was 1:54pm. When I called back they didn't answer. Had to call a third time, around 2:30pm to get an answer. The third time I called the guy was rude and somehow they dropped all their payment options, now only dealing in cash. Avoid this place, it's a joke of a buisness."
