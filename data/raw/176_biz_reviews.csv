/user_details?userid=JMwlZlewLZczpLZa5TuyQA,Eugene J.,"Bronxville, NY",5 star rating,"Bocata is a gem. The dinner we enjoyed here was easily our most memorable meal in Montreál. The restaurant in located in one of the quaint little streets in the heart of Old Montreal. It's cozy but not cramped, with tasteful decór and elegant tables. They do get rather busy on evenings, so a reservation is likely a good idea. They have a rudimentary wine and beverage selection. The first appetizer to arrive is the | tuna otoro |, one of the daily specials. Ruby-red tuna belly, sliced thin, seasoned and torched lightly. I can only say that the otoro was life-changing. A moment of intensity, and then it vanishes in the mouth, leaving only the lingering taste of the fish, rich and fatty and luxurious. Addictive, stunning, magical. 10/10.My sister always says that nothing can beat a good | tuna tartare |. The second appetizer (and special) is Bocata's take on the dish, and it makes a strong case to prove my sister right. In a tartare, of course, the true flavor of the fish shines brightest, and this tartare does not disappoint. The tuna is clean and light and yet rich and flavorful, accentuated by the simple seasoning, hints of citrus and salt, topped with microgreen sprouts to balance the tuna's depth. It is elegance on a plate. 9.5/10| Patatas bravas | does not seem at all out of place on the menu, and yet the plate holds a few tricks up its sleeve. Rather than the thick crunch I expected, the  potatoes are subtly crisp and drenched in a light sauce. There is no heavy, greasy aioli here, the sauce is bright and complex and altogether lighter than any patatas bravas I've ever tried. 8.5/10Bocata also has a selection of fresh oysters, which we ordered, though unfortunately I didn't get to try them.Our final appetizer is the | gambas al ajillo |, shrimp served with a light broth and crusty bread. Argentinian shrimp are served supremely tender with a flavor reminiscent of lobster. The broth is fragrant and incredibly flavorful; hints of the guajillo chili, fruity with a hint of heat, garlic, pungent but mellow, parsley, butter, scallion, shrimp stock. Balanced, nuanced, and immensely comforting. I will dream about that broth. 10/10.Onto the mains dishes. Our final special of the night is the brilliant | tataki sandwich |, with bluefin tuna breaded, fried, and served between toasted white bread. The sandwich is delicately crispy, with additional texture from a red cabbage slaw. This is the meatiest tuna we try tonight, tender but with a bit of chew. Acidity to accent the fish's richness. Playful flavors deftly balanced, this sandwich is hearty and satisfying but light and absolutely delicious. 9/10.The next dish is the | risotto verde |. Creamy rice laden with peas, coriander sprouts, and briny, diminutive shrimp arrives veiled in mystery and a crispy canopy of chicharron made in-house. The tangy flavors of chimichurri (and is that tomatillo I taste?) collide with the velvety risotto to brilliant effect, but despite the vegetables and acidity present, the dish feels like it could use some fresh brightness. 8/10.Our final dish is the | bacalao a la vizcaina |, a dish of tender cod in red sauce with roasted fingerling potatoes. The fish is cooked until just flaky and seasoned very gently. By itself, it's actually rather bland, but it finds the perfect counterpoint in the piquant, vibrant sauce, brimming with fruity complexity and and just the right amount of spice. The roasted potatoes are creamy and well-browned, served with a secondary sauce with olive oil and fresh herbs. The dish has a quiet sort of appeal, perhaps not as exciting as some of the other dishes but easily as delicious, if not more. 9.5/10.The service is exceptional. The staff is friendly, attentive, and more than competent. Throughout our meal, I got the impression that our server was very interested in making sure we had a good time.In case you couldn't tell, I adore this restaurant. The food consistently maintains an incredible standard of quality, and the experience is top notch. Bocata is easily, heartily, heavily, wholeheartedly, highly recommended. 9.3/10 average."

We were having trouble finding a good breakfast spot where there was something that we liked so we were happy when we stumbled upon this place. The inside is very cozy and inviting. I loved the whole decor of the place. It was very unique. The menu had a little bit of everything on it. I chose to get the french toast which was really great!My only complaint was that it was a little pricey, other than that I had a wonderful breakfast here with my friend."

/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is the first review I've written in over a month which is a long time for me to have gone without contributing something. Unfortunately, I've had some very difficult health issues that I am still struggling with, but hopefully I will be on the mend soon. Anyhow, enough about me and onto this wonderful little restaurant.The space is cozy with nice little mason jar lights and flowers at each table. The menu consists of a large number of snacks and appetizers which we can just group under the umbrella term of tapas. While they do have a small number of well known mains (mostly in the pasta/risotto family), we decided to build ourselves a tasting menu from the tapas alone.What ensued was just a lovely night of tastes and textures. Given my recent health problems, it felt good to be out with my wife alone for the first time in over a month, even if I was functioning at a reduced capacity.  I'm glad to say that Bocata rose to the challenge of making it a very enjoyable night.We started with the Spanish mainstay of the Bellota ham and the classic tomato bread. The ham was nutty and rich while the tomato bread was rich in garlic and olive oil with a thick spread of crushed tomato on top. I think the classic version of the bread usually has a thinner veneer of tomato seeds and inner jelly, but this bruschetta-like take on it was delicious nonetheless.We then moved on to the fried New Brunswick smelts served with a delicious aioli and a wedge of lemon. This snack is everything that is right in the world. You could taste the fish, the thin crispy batter, the wonderful seasoning, and the rich aioli in every bite. I could picture eating this at a seafood shack in Cape Cod.The dish of the night was the sockeye salmon crudo served in a raspberry gastrique with fennel and olive oil. The interplay of fresh raspberry combined with a hint of acidity elevated the tender salmon. The result was an ultra fresh and uplifting dish that was unexpected.The fish rillette served on toast with various toppings was the only dish that fell a bit flat for us. It was neutral and just didn't taste of very much at all. The burrata of the night was a Vietnamese peanut/sprout/sesame oil creation that was well conceived and absolutely delicious. It came with some pita bread. We finished every last morsel of the platter.To finish we paired an order of the shrimp in a garlic broth alongside the bravas potatoes. The shrimp was excellent, though not as well seasoned and delicious as a similar dish served at Ibericos on St. Denis. Nevertheless, without a separate reference point, these shrimp are objectively delicious and properly cooked. The bravas potatoes has a hint of spice to them, were boiled instead of fried, and are served in a reddish glaze. I would like to see them add a little aioli over top as is traditional with this dish.We ended the night with some port for my wife and at the recommendation of our friendly waiter, some yellow wine for me. (which is a first for me) It tastes like port but is nowhere near as sweet. I really enjoyed it. The Chef at Bocata is doing some interesting things and is clearly quite creative. For my taste, he might be straying a little too much from the traditional Spanish preparation of certain dishes. To his credit however, his experimentation works more than half the time. On a Saturday night, the restaurant was packed and everybody looked very happy. I count myself amongst these people and am grateful to have been out of the house and enjoying life with the woman I love."

The oysters will blow your mind with the maple syrup toppings. I got the catch of the day which was snapper and it was cooked to perfection. Go to Bocata whether you're a local or just visiting."
/user_details?userid=a6GEhVJLqK6sxp3HPwqAeQ,Vanessa W.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"Nice ambiance. Nice booths if you're a larger party. Very accommodating.Alexander Keith's Red Amber Ale - This is a refreshing beer, slightly reminiscent of a sour, but only lightly so.Orange Méchanique - This cocktail tastes primarily of Jack Daniel's with a touch of Aperol. Not a bad cocktail, but nothing mind blowing.Squid Ink Risotto - ONLY CAME WITH ONE SMALL SCALLOP which felt like a rip off, and the three measly shrimp were more skin than meat. However I did like that there were layers of flavor in this dish and each bite was flavorful and slightly different. The juicy tomatoes and chorizo pieces and micro greens all added their own touch to enhance this dish.Lobster Carbonara Tagliatelle - Good flavor and provides a delicious first bite, but the portion is definitely a bit on the smaller side."

The food was interesting and very good, service was great. Our waiter was friendly and very attentive at refilling our water glasses and offering more bread, wine, etc. For me Ambiance is an important thing at a dinner restaurant and Bocata definitely fulfilled my wish for that. Very charming decor.I would eat there again!"
/user_details?userid=EWGPtvOVdWTrjwOA5mZEiQ,Olivia V.,"Newport Beach, CA",5 star rating,"Just got back from Bocata and wow, was it an amazing experience. My boyfriend and I made reservations a week prior since we're here for thanksgiving break but we weren't sure what to expect but dang, we were blown away. From the service to the ambience to the food, everything was exceptional! If I lived here, I'd probably swing by at least once a week. From 17:00-19:00, they serve $1 oysters!!! Of course we had to try a few that were divine (we decided on 6 Quebec oysters). They weren't too strong in flavor, there was a good balance of salty and even a hint of sweetness! To start, we decided on the octopus which was the perfect bite to start off the night. I would definitely recommend this dish! For entrees, both us decided to split the lobster tagliatelle and the squid ink risotto. While we found the lobster dish to be a little more salty than we would've liked, it was still a solid entree however I can't recommend the risotto enough! It was so rich and creamy, I was so impressed. It also came with scallops which were so well seared and delicious. To finish off the night, we ordered the half baked cookie with bourbon ice cream. The ice cream took us by surprise with its strong flavors of alcohol but mixed in with the cookie, it was a bite of heaven.  If you're ever in the area, definitely swing by and give this place a try!"
/user_details?userid=FPv27CkYLodbfz3gj5Fnkg,Tony Y.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Found this gem on Resy. Loving the app so giving it the proper shoutout. Came here for an early solo dinner at the bar and it was exactly what I wanted. The specials were a salad and a fish; I listened but I already knew what I wanted. I went for the pata negra (read delicious ham) which comes with tomato toast (essentially bruschetta) and their signature lobster carbonara tagliatelle. The ham and bruschetta were magical. Tasty, crunchy, and everything that is right with food. The lobster carbonara was creamy (without cream from what I could tell and how it should be) and with the perfect egg sitting on top. My only comment was that it was a bit under salted but that could just be my taste. Overall I'd say this spot was pretty legit. I'd like to try some of the other dishes next time. Hopefully I'll come with more people to try it all."

/user_details?userid=-pG4fm6eWoGLP6fIsFBvzw,Teri Y.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"We made a reservation for bar seating (our fav way to dine) and had a wonderful night here. We started off with the patatas bravas, octopus, and cured mackerel. The mackerel was outstanding-- absolutely a delight. The octopus was tender and the patatas bravas were warm and soft when biting into it.Another star of the meal was the lobster carbonara pasta. I loved that despite the ""carbonara"" word, it wasn't your typical and generic white cream sauce. The brown base of the sauce was full of lobster flavor and essence. The raw egg yolk that came on top of the dish added to the taste after mixing it all in. We also shared the catch of the day, which was halibut. Wonderfully prepared as the fish was tender.Wine offerings have the option of a half or full glass. Cocktail menu is a printed label stuck on a glass bottle. How cool!The dining space is intimate and not too large, surrounded by stone walls. Makes for a great night out with friends or a date night."

The food was quite good, but it's definitely overpriced. Eggs, bread, beans, and a bit of meat should never cost almost $20! My friend got a chickpea dish and that was also way overpriced.

A terrific selection of wines by the glass including unusual and off the scene selections. Pours are offered in 2 1/2 ounce and 5 ounce amounts, and sampling is encouraged.    Now let's talk about the food. Spectacular. They have a oysters, Pata Negra (that's cured ham from pigs who eat only acorns, is from Spain, and is rather pricey.... but they have it). Also wonderful fish and pasta.     After dinner, there are choices of port, Sherry, cognac, Calvados, Armagnac, and all the whiskeys and dessert wines you could imagine.  Wow !"

After a slight snag with our Resy reservation - apparently the restaurant did not have a record of it, even though I had confirmation - you might want to call to make sure. After that was sorted, we finally got a table and went on to enjoy our meal.I had a nice rosé by the glass, and there was a good selection of other wines as well. The menu is limited, and that is because everything is fresh and sourced as locally as possible. There were also some specials that our helpful waiter told us about.I went with one of the specials - a homemade pasta dish with mussels and tomatoes in a light sauce. It was heavenly! Everyone at my table tried it and enjoyed it.We all rotated our dishes so we could get a taste of everything. The Nordic shrimp salad was interesting - but ended up being very tasty. The carbonara was also good, as was the simplicity of the caccio e pepe. Everything was fresh and the ingredients high-quality.The waiter even gave us an after-dinner shot as a palette cleanser, and it actually tasted very good. Everything was thoroughly enjoyed! Bocata is a great, inventive, intimate spot in Vieux Montréal."

At 10:30 we were seated along with 3 other tables. We placed our orders and got coffee. The food took a very long time. We finally got our meals at 11:20 considering that we were the first to arrive and that other tables seated after us got their meals and finished them before ours arrived the wait was too long. However, once the food arrived the did redeem themselves. I ordered the Trout Toast, which was bright and fresh and delicious. My husband ordered the Spanish omelette which was lack lustre but the salad that came with it was a beautiful butter lettuce dressed with a really good dressing. Our friend ordered their breakfast sandwich which was a beautifully crafted sandwich which tasted as good as it looked. For the 3 meals with 2 coffees it came to $50"

The slight sourness of the veggie inside is refreshing. The tagliatelle is very rich and full of flavor, with a lot of spinach and tomato. I love the fact that they put a lot of vegetables into both dishes, making everything light and enjoyable. The tres leches cake is also a marvelous desert."

It showcased an older European mix of french and spanish influences, complete with a cozy stone fireplace (although it was not burning when we were dining).We started our meal off with the Snow Crab Cake croquettes and the Tuna Tartare appetizers.   Both were pretty decent options.  I was glad that the chef was able to accommodate making our tartare without the Pata Negra since I don't eat pork.   Always a great sign that it's super fresh and made to order when you know it's not automatically mixed together.  Our crab croquettes were quite tasty as well; Enjoyed the crispy and light texture.  4/5For my main, I went with the Squid Ink Risotto and again, they were able to make it without the pork (chorizo) which was very much appreciated.  Good assortment of mixed seafood and definitely a pretty filling dish.  Seafood was cooked nicely but the rice could've used just a tad more spice.  Nonetheless, it was pretty good just the same.  3.5/5       Overall, a great stop to refuel before we made our way home.  Huge wine list btw if you love wine, both by the glass and by bottle.  Recommended if you're in the Old Montreal vicinity!"

As a tourist looking for good places for brunch, every source just seems to default you to Olive and Gourmando. Tried to go there first but of course the line up is 45 mins. Walked down the street and we find this absolute gem with no line! At first we were skeptical, but so so glad we gave them a shot!Servers were friendly and helpful. But best of all the food was exceptional! The food here is expertly crafted and prepared. We're not talking Cora's here or Eggspectations. The breakfast sandwich here is one of the best I've had anywhere. It's that good. Perfectly cooked runny egg that erupts yolk the second you bite into it, with a great balance of acid from whatever the sauce was that was in it, all on the most delicate of buns (brioche?). House special pancakes were also crazy. Again, not just some regular housemade pancakes but these had some meringue pieces in it and fluffy whipped cream. Felt like I could've given them 4 stars because the portion sizes were on the small side but the prices were very reasonable.So happy to find my new favourite brunch spot!"

A decent vegetarian selection- they offered to make us some dishes that typically contained meat- as vegetarian.We had the tomato toast, cheese selections, patatas bravas, tomato salad, asparagus salad (absolutely delicious) and the house made mozzarella with truffles.Will absolutely be coming back and would highly recommend as spanish-quebec fusion!"

It's a very charming, romantic vibe inside, great for a date. Food was very good, but not as phenomenal as Barroco. We had the devilled eggs, and mini burger to start, my husband had the squid ink risotto (they didn't have squid ink that night though, regardless, he enjoyed his meal). I had the home-made spaghetti with pecorino and truffle (delicious, and the highlight of the meal for me), followed by the lemon tart (pretty good), and my husband had the cookie with bourbon ice cream. Since I am pregnant, it limited my menu options, as there are a lot of raw items on the menu, and items which are barred from a pregnant woman's répertorie.

The place is more of a dinner/bar place, but also opens for brunch. Because of that the inside is really dim, which wasn't a huge problem but just for brunch time they should really lighten up the place. Workers were nice, they were patient in waiting for our friend who was running late and in general friendly. The food was very tasty, at least for me, I really liked my French toast and the maple butter. Sweet and creamy. But charging $12.65 for a piece of bread with some butter, no matter how tasty, is pushing it a tiny bit too much. Portion is small and wasn't very filling, especially for a brunch. My friend ordered granola with yogurt and fruit, and that became the laughing stock of our meal 'cause the portion is TINY for a $9 dish. It was served on a plate, not a bowl, and there was like 2mm thickness to the layer of yogurt. My other friend's arctic char with avocado turned out to be the most value and also tasty, coming at $16, but even that's pushing it given the portion. It doesn't cost much to add some hash browns or some fruits to the side of these dishes. Just a bit more to make it tasty AND filling would make this experience worth it but it unfortunately wasn't.They do have really nice napkins though."

The textures and flavors were divine. We also ordered an apple pavlova that was beautiful and had a surprising and pleasingly tart topping. So...amazing food, friendly service and a cozy interior. It was such a wonderful surprise!"

We had the oysters again- they were fantastic both nights.  I had the lobster tagliatelli and my husband had the squid ink risotto.  Both were fantastic.  The wine selection is amazing- and the recommendations from the bartender were perfect.We loved the atmosphere- small and cozy, but not stuffy.  We enjoyed talking to other customers at the bar as well."

We were able to go without a reservation on a Wednesday night. We started with the special appetizer- panzanella. The tomatoes were delicious, but the dish was too salty. The buratta was very good- it's served with anchovies (which I personally don't like but my wife does!). The halibut special main course was amazing! Perfectly cooked fish over asparagus and ricotta- yum! Our server was super friendly, and the restaurant is so cute and cozy."

When my fiance and I came in, we got to choose our table. They even gave us free glasses of champagne to celebrate. The decor was cute and the food was fresh. I got the squid ink risotto which had a soft, luscious scallop and perfectly cooked prawn. The risotto was nice and salty (just how I like it)! My only suggestion is that I would have loved squid ink pasta but hey, beggers can't be choosers. My fiance had the oysters which came in three different types. The sea bass he had to end the meal had a nice crunch on the outside and a soft center. Come by and you won't regret it! But be prepared to relax, as the meals will come at a relaxed pace."

They were happy to indulge me and I was magically met by the restaurant's owner, Mitch, behind the bar. He was very amiable and superbly knowledgable - takes great pride in his restaurant and staff. He set me up with a delicious glass of red wine and suggested the Tuna tartare accompany. The flavor combination was unlike any I have previously experienced. I just had to try a few bites of the Ricotta Cavatelli - several members of the staff stopped by to say how much they liked it and that they were excited for me to enjoy it. The kitchen KNOWS what's good. And they did NOT disappoint. My only regret is I didn't come hungrier. Bocata's atmosphere is cozy and their food is delicious. A wonderful date night, meal with friends, or - like myself - a treat for one. Ask for Mitch and Victoria."

It's one of those places where the owner runs the front of house playing sommelier, bartender and server without missing a beat. There were other staff at the hostess desk and running food. They worked well as a team. Our meal was never interrupted wondering where dishes, drinks or condiments were. Gorgeous place, too.We started with a dozen Beausoleil oysters with Montreal Smoke Show jalapeño sauce on a couple. We got pata negra with traditional Catalan tomato bread and smelt, a delicacy anyone from Michigan or the Great Lakes knows.I ordered a sparkling Greek biodynamic white wine as an aperitif, and he recommended a bottle of one of their wines by the glass that was more consistent than organic wines can sometimes be. It complemented our meal nicely, as our main course was their lobster carbonara.The carbonara was light on the pepper, though they would add as much as you liked. The bacon was fat cuts of lardon. You got a nice piece of tail and a claw. Then the tagliatelle was arranged in a pretty birds nest with a quail egg in the middle that you stir in yourself at the table.For dessert, we had grapa and espresso with a delicious lemon meringue tart with pistachios and ice cream. It was a perfect and memorable meal, better than Le Serpent!"

The decorations, design, service, and even the washroom is perfect. The napkins are special, the bread basket is special, the seats are comfortable, the signature cocktail menu is on a bottle, there are paintings and a fake fish on the wall, there are different candles, there are books, dry ham and other decorations.For the food, it is also very good! We ordered an off menu special, a rib eye for two to share, the mushrooms are juicy and the rib eye was cooked perfect. The only thing is that I felt like there is a little more fat in the rib eye than there should be. We also ordered a squid ink risotto as a main. The risotto was perfect. We all loved it! Oh for the appetizer we had the Burrata. There was a lot, and we ate it with regular bread after we finished with the bread in the dish, and it was still so tasty. The pickled fish was great. For dessert, we ordered the carrot cake and the lemon pie. The waitress told us it was the last lemon pie. I would say the carrot cake was perfect. The lemon pie could be a little more sour. I would like it to be more sour.I love it! I really love this place!"

The decor was casual chic and very comfortable. The first thing that struck me is that this was a beautiful date restaurant with dim lighting and just a very nice vibe. We started with the octopus and potatoes  (great cook on the octopus but the potatoes were a touch underdone). I had the lobster carbonara which was delicious perfectly cooked lobster and pasta with great flavour. My boyfriend had the lobster boil dish and while the food was fresh and there was nothing wrong with it , he did say it lacked some spicing or something to make it stand out a little more. We also had the donuts for dessert which were nice and light and not overly sweet , they were a nice ending to the meal.  We had really great friendly service and they made a great wine suggestion for us. My only complaint is that I felt that it was a touch overpriced for what you get but definitely go in and try for yourself !"

I heard this was a good place to try some wine so I figured I'd stop by and see if I could get a table or sit at the bar without a reservation. I believe they had just opened so I had the place to myself with a nice window seat. I asked the waitress if she recommended any good wine with the meal I was getting and she did. Let me try two of them and I picked my favorite. I ordered the lobster pasta dish (I forgot it's official name) and she came out with some fresh bread and oil for dipping. It was all very good. I'd definitely go again. She then recommended some desserts and I had the carrot cake with carrot ice cream. It was amazing! Best carrot cake I've ever had. I will note that I didn't have any problems getting a table without a reservation at 530, but several people started showing up at about 615 and were turned away because they were booked up. There are only 4 or 5 seats at the bar and those were all full. It was very good food and a nice vibe. It's a very small restaurant and very quaint."

We walked inside and I instantly feel the romantic vibe. There's deep brown wood ceilings, bookshelves with old books, a brick wall, dim lighting and candelabra's and candles on the tables. They transformed an old book into the drink menu, very cute. There's an automatic wine bar that dispenses the Wine and keeps the temperature regulated and air-tight, as well as perfect pour.  The wine list on a chalkboard, they serve by the glass and half glass as well as bottles.The hostess sat us near the window and I asked her about recommendations. The hostess was very friendly and pointed out the warm Octopus salad among other delicious apps.The waitress offered sparkling or flat water. We ordered the warm Octopus salad to nibble on and ordered Steak and Mediterranean sea bass as our mains.The Octopus was cooked to perfection, not chewy at all, and a delicious flavour. even though I knew it was a warm salad it still was surprising to take a bite of a warm salad dish, it was Memorable.The Steak was tender , no need for a knife, and came with a Beet purée. It was tasty but really such a tease size, it was the size of our app. I felt sorry for my Man he Eats, and the waitress didn't mention the Entrees are Very small plates.   The Mediterranean sea bass looked more like a snapper *see pictures, and was by far the smallest piece of Sea Bass I have ever ordered.  It was accompanied bySweet potato purée and had crispy pieces of sweet potato in it, out of this world flavourful. There was also some fish roe on top. Again small, we should have ordered two more dishes! Yes I asked for more country bread for my Man, and he still left hungry.  We had a nice romantic dinner, the ambiance was definitely there, good looking diners, the food delicious, it's just disappointing to leave a Restaurant hungry.    If there was a little more food its an easy 5 star restaurant."

We just spent a few hours there on a quiet Monday night. We were the first to arrive for dinner at 6:45 PM and it filled up by 8PM, which is a good sign for a Monday night. The food is A+++ ridiculous. We ordered a bunch of things from the menu over 3 courses, which was presented in perfect sequence by our wonderful host/server Frederic. He and his co-workers know everything about the menu and wines. They advise, suggest and recommend perfect combinations for us. In short, the service is impeccable and the food is as good as we could ever desire.  The atmosphere is lovely. The decor is gorgeous with intimate, unpretentious, ecclectic surroundings. This is the kind of place where you feel like you have the best people taking care of you with pure love. I'll try to remember what we had: Patatas Bravas. ""How do you make potatoes so delicious."" said my dining partner. Followed by a nice selection of oysters with handcrafted side sauces. Yum. Shishito peppers & pata nega  (melt in your mouth Iberico prosciutto), burrata with boquerones cheese truffles, and the famous lobster boil for main course. 3 hours of decadent pleasures. We washed it all down with a smooth Knock on Wood Chardonnay from Oregon. The perfect match, as suggested by Frederic. For dessert we had donut holes with dulce de leche. No words. We highly recommend this place. Wonderful vibe, great staff and superb food. This is as good as it gets in Old Montreal."

We started with the crab cakes. The order comes with only 2. They were very flavorful and make with true crab meat. Very pleased these were not heavy on mayo, which is what you see a lot.We also ordered 15g of the cured meat. It reminded me of the jamon in Spain and Paris.

The decor, setting, seating and lighting are all great.The service is very friendly and the wine list is fantastic.I'd like to see fewer cocktails with Jack Daniels but that's just me, however the food was where it lost stars. The oysters were a great start, nice choices, meaty fresh expertly shucked.The tuna confit has a larger than needed garnish of chevril which isn't able to be eat (a large sprig doesn't lend itself to being eaten) and I wasn't sure how to be eating the chips and sour cream and caviar with the tuna. Ended up eating the tuna, then eating chips and very fancy dip. It came off as trying a bit hard.The octopus and potato dish was pretty tasty, the octopus was well prepared but the sauce needed lemon adding that (and it could have used a bit of heat) made it much better but it really did need an acid on the plate. We had lemon for our water not the dish itself.The main was a lovely well prepared roasted sea bass, which for reasons I can't understand had very bitter endive topping (it's on the menu but it was leaves, with an apple slice inside) the risotto was lentil based (I didn't ask about that as I just assumed rice so that one is on me I suppose) but it was just a very odd dish that again seemed to be trying a bit to hard.

The Mediterranean Sea bass was a bit different than normal crispy skin at other restaurants. It's skinless and on a pile of shiitake mushroom, spinach n sweet potato purée.  The whole thing was so soft and yummy. Every single bite. And the fish size was more than generous. Like the whole fish with 2 big filets. Thyme roasted milk fed veal chop. Just the name itself is divine and the dish was amazing. Perfectly cooked chop and the homemade gnocchi on the side was delicious as well. Really didn't expect such awesome meal from this place but was pleasantly surprised.

We felt very lucky! The atmosphere is rustic & homey ala 100 years ago as bars were in the 1970's (not newly done over and ""quaint"" or ""kitschy"" as century old places often are today).  From a cozy spot at the bar where we could people/decor watch, we enjoyed a toddy & a mimosa with light brunch plates. My husband ordered something bacon-y and I had smoked salmon piled so high I couldn't finish. As I said, a lucky find for us.

The portion on the carbonara was pretty small which I should watch my portion size anyways but with the small amount of lobster in it (I counted 3 small pieces) it shouldn't have been $30. Each dish we had the sommelier paired wine by the glass which they had us sample first before selecting & that was great! For dessert we had the lemon meringue torte, the lemon filling & meringue was great but we didn't care for the puff pastry it was on, it was too hard to cut through.

They seem to rotate through dishes seasonally (awesome sign of a great restaurant!), because the menu online has changed since I visited a week ago.Lobster Tagliatelle ($23) - The version I ate had cherry tomatoes, lobster, spinach, and the yolk that came in its shell - it was all so delicious. A must-have dish in my opinion. Not salty, very flavorful, and not too skimpy on the lobster.Mediterranean Sea Bass ($17) - This had wild mushroom, spinach, vanilla infused sweet potato purée. The fillet of fish was a bit on the thinner side, but all the side veggies complemented the fish very well. It was a sweeter dish thanks to the sweet potato. It was good, no complaints, but I probably wouldn't get this again because I'd like to try other things.Squid Ink Risotto ($19) - Really enjoyed this dish. Risotto was cooked perfectly and it had nice pieces of seafood and scallops inside.Molten Chocolate Cake ($9) - Perfectly baked so that the entire texture of the cake was soft. It was not a hard cake with a runny middle, but almost just a soft, fluffy, chocolate cake. Perfect. I could have eaten an entire one (or two) of these, it was that good.All in all, a delicious meal. The 3 dishes plus dessert was the right amount of food. I highly recommend splitting dishes if you come so that you can try a little bit of everything. With our 2 drinks, the total bill was a little over $100."

Ate a few other places including one of the more hyped up spots in the area, which came in slightly under expectations. Bocata was amazing! The food was delicious, the ambience was spot on, music selection was great! ... but let me get to the food.... Had the fried smelt, first time trying this, were delicious, perfecr with the spritz of lemon and then a mayo dip, could have had more! Hubby had the oyster special and loved them. The octopus a gallega was tender, and wonderful. But the highlight for me was the squid ink risotto... EAT THIS ... i could have eaten this for every dinner... it was rich and delicious, with a little smokiness from the spicy chorizo, tender little baby squid tentacles, peas, and baby cilantro sprinkled on top. The prawn and scallop served on top were cooked to perfection! Get this, you wont be disappointed!!!! The only downside here was that they were out of the crispy chicken skins for the night, which i was dying to try, but they must be good if they ran out! 5 stars, will recommend to anyone who takes the trip out to mtl. Oh, and make a reservation in advance, and if you cant, download the DINR app to score last minute reservationa from cancellations if you cant find something!"

Cool place- atmosphere is really neat and inviting. I sat down at the bar and said ""looks like a nice place to have a few cocktails"". The bartender quickly came back with ""sorry, if you want to drink you also have to order food, it's the law"". Hmmm ok. I wasn't planning on eating, but this was a blessing in disguise. Started out with a RYE Manhattan. She made a really good drink. I then ordered the lobster and ham carbonara. YUM. SHIT WAS GOOOOOOOD. lobster was super tender and the ham added a nice salty taste. I would for sure come back here for a meal!And they give you your bill in an old book...."
/user_details?userid=3ZN_XxxKV-5FVP5Yu3sj5A,Lucas B.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I made reservations here about 2 weeks prior to my visit - a late Friday night dinner. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, seeing as how the majority of the other restaurants I'd looked at in old Montreal were completely booked for any reasonable dining hour on the night in question. Suspicious...Well, much to my delight, this place was great. A very small, intimate environment, made all the more interesting with authentic ""cracked"" brick walls fitted with candles, complete with running wax spillover. Very cool. In short, a great  backdrop for a night out with the wife.The service was great, our waiter was definitely on his game.There's clearly an emphasis on seafood when it comes to the menu, so I decided on the warm octopus salad, and the squid ink seafood risotto. Both were prepared perfectly.They also have a very good selection of wines by the glass, which seemed to me to have been curated very specifically, which is atypical of most restaurants these days, so extra marks there. Overall, a great dinner with great service. If I lived near here I would definitely treat it as a go-to for casual dinners with family and friends."

/user_details?userid=JMP9JY5JV2HfWn8ClTBb6A,Matthew T.,"Bradenton, FL",5 star rating,"One of our best meals in Montreal was at Bocata.  This hole in the wall place, which is a bit dark and warm in summer, served up some creative and interesting food.  Plus, the service was nice and some great wine was to be had.As one of the other reviewers pointed out it is best to approach Bocata knowing what you are getting into, which I agree with.  They do serve wine in two sizes by the glass and the prices are a bit high, but get a bottle!  Tell the sommelier what you like, and he'll recommend a bottle.  This is what we did and got a lovely spanish wine that we hand't had before and now I'm dying to find. Our server was very nice, informative, pleasant and just plain did a good job.  The food is served tapas style, small plates, but are a bit different than traditional spanish tapas.  No patatas Brava for example, but don't let that stop you, there is some good flavors and creativity here.  We started with some Iberian Negra ham, a real pleasure and hard to get in the states so this was a good treat.  The bread served with it was out of sight.  We also had the heirloom tomato salad.  Fresh and amazing flavors.  Not too heavy and the flavor of the ingredient really showed through.After that we had the beef cheeks, the halibut & mushroom duxelle, and and the veal with manchego.  The beef cheeks were tender, amazing complex flavors and the roasted shallots were a nice counter point.  The halibut was one of the best things I've had in a long time and probably one of the reasons I'm giving them 5 stars.  The fish was cooked perfectly, the mushrooms Devine and earthy, and the broth it was served in was a bit of genius and worked so well with the flavors.  The veal, well the veal was a disappointment.  The meat was cook properly and fine, but the polenta was not what I think of as creamy polenta and the manchego's flavor was lost in the polenta.  This dish needed some work or maybe my expectations were too high because of what came before.  5 dishes was more than enough for dinner for two.  I would rather have 2 or 3 bites of something amazing than a whole plate of one thing, so Bocata fits the bill for me.  Can't wait to come back and eat there again."
/user_details?userid=kMXPkvGLJBLgkZVLPQmSlw,Marianne D.,"Naperville, IL",4 star rating,"This charming tiny restaurant is located on a narrower quaint street in Old Montreal and has great ambiance.  It's very eclectic, rustic in style and candlelit. There is a small bar with half dozen bar stools or so and the dining area has two curved booths and maybe 10 tables. The gentleman who greeted us and actually served us was friendly and provided good service.  We ordered a bottle of Montelpulciano d' Abruzzo and the fried smelt to begin. The smelt were very small in size, 3"" long, lightly fried and served with a lemon aioli. They were light and tasty with a little crunch. I was brought back to my childhood and my mom and grandma making smelt.  For dinner, my husband had the veal chop. It was cooked medium rare and a nice-sized portion. The veal was served with homemade gnocchi. My husband devoured it and said is was fantastic. I had the lobster carbonara tagliatelle. The sauce was a very light carbonara, not made with heavy cream.  This dish had lobster, bacon, shallots, sundried tomatoes and egg. The menu said egg yolk in its shell, but it wasn't served that way; there was an egg on top of the pasta minus the shell presentation. This dish missed the mark for me even though there were large pieces of lobster. Being 100% Italian, I expected a tastier dish. The bacon or pancetta was wilted and could have been cooked crisp for texture and the dish lacked Parmesan cheese and salt. I think if there was cheese in the carbonara or grated on top, it would have elevated the flavor.  After dinner, the check was presented in an old book which patrons write notes in. A cute touch and I added a note, too.  All in all, I would recommend this small bistro even though my entree was lacking. Everything else was good and the atmosphere was unique. In looking at photos of the lobster carbonara from reviewers here and on Trip Advisor, it seems this dish varies in presentation.  I think it may be a dish to give a second chance."

Luckily, Bocata had a few seats at the bar and were able to serve us anyway.We started out with some drinks and if I were to split up my rating, I would definitely give the bartender and the drink 5-stars. I ordered the bloody goblin which was absolutely outstanding. I typically don't like sweet drinks too much but this drink had the perfect level of sweetness with an herbal aroma to compliment it well.For an appetizer I had the duck salad which was also outstanding and deserving of five stars. For the main dish, we all ordered the veal which was tasty but not at all deserving of the price tag it came with. The meat was pretty tough and not really anything to write home about. I would give the veal two and a half to three stars. I should not have ordered dessert because I already ate way too much but I did anyway and had a rich chocolate lava cake with homemade raspberry vanilla ice cream. The ice cream was pretty delicious but the lava cake was okay. I probably would have enjoyed it all a lot more if I wasn't already stuffed.Overall, I was happy with this place and I would be happy to return here.

Both were awesome in their own right.  Especially the salad, which may qualify as life-changing.  Entrees were roasted cod, squid ink risotto with various shellfish, roasted seabass with a creamy sweet potato topper, and a basic kids pasta, which in reality was a tasty tagliatelle pomodoro. Excellent wine selection, if a bit pricey.  We had a few off the by-the-glass menu which were delicious.  To seal the deal, we had the chocolate lava cake and tiramisu.  Both were delicious.  We finished off with some Taylor Fladgate 10 year old Porto, which is always nice.  A decent selection of after-dinner drinks if that is your thing.      As others have written, the portions here are not big.  They are appropriately sized to give you a delicious and fulfilling meal.  If you want to strap a feedbag on your face, you can try Buffalo Wild Wings or something.  We took our time and we never felt rushed.  On a Sunday night, they turned away at least 25 people.  They could've tried to move the tables, but that never happened."

It was seasoned with paprika and served with potatoes and an aioli sauce. It was not Bad but nothing memorable either. The beef tartare was good, but the chunks of beef were bigger than typical for tartare and seasoning very European but yummy. the squid ink risotto was so/so. It's a heavy dish and was mixed with some sort of aioli sauce and came with cherry tomatoes peas seafood and chorizo.

The burrata had truffles and anchovies on it and it was amazing. I was day dreaming about it after we had finished it. And the yellow tail hamachi was so so tasty. I'm not exactly sure what was with it, but the fresh dark dark red tuna with some savory salty goodness was just really tasty. For entree I go the rosemary pork chop, which had a good browning crust and was juicy with a nice saltiness and hints of rosemary. over all it was a really good meal and I would 100% return."

Bocata is my favorite restaurant in Montreal and possibly the world!  Every meal I've had has been memorable.  Here are some of my favorite dishes:Citrus Risotto with Scallops, Verbena EmulsionDon't let the foam fool you!  These scallops were sooooo good!  We got to try these from the Valentine's Day Menu and they should be the everyday menu.Lobster & Fennel TagliatelleWe had no problem eating off of other people's dishes to try this delicious dish.  We just pretended there were no carbs.  This goodness is on the summer menu so you need to get it while you still can!Mediterranean Sea BassThis is also part of the summer menu.  You can lose a friendship over this one if you don't feel like sharing.  The vanilla infused sweet potato puree was perfect.BurataA featured appetizer on the summer menu.  The Burata is quite filling and tasty!  Don't worry, the bread doesn't have any carbs.Asparagus with Quail EggsHad dreams about the asparagus.  There is truffle oil in there somewhere.  We went two days in a row just to eat this again.Foie Gras Poele Aux ArgumesOkay, we love our foie gras but this one really changed our lives.  Orange marmalade  Bourbon and Maple jus and GINGERBREAD CRUMBLE.  To our Foie Gras Fairy Godmother or Godfather out there, we are willing to sacrifice a lot just to have a taste again. Amuse BoucheAlthough this was just an amuse bouche, we knew that the rest of our meal would be perfect because they got this part right!Surf & Turf So what do you get when you pair AAA Angus Beef Tenderloin with celery root puree and Roasted Lobster with Almond & Truffle Viennoise?  The perfect pair!Sweet TreatWarm chocolaty brownies with salted caramel and ice cream.  What more can a girl ask for?  And yes, the dessert had zero carbs as well.We are just so in love with Bocata Restaurant et Bar a vin all we can say is Oh My Bocata!  We can't wait to go back!"

We got the tuna tartare as our entree and then I had the veau with homemade gnocchi. The tuna was amazing. The veau was quite fatty but once you cut around that the meat was delicious. The gnocchi melted in your mouth and the piece de resistance was the fresh buffalo mozzarella they added to it. Great glass of Bordeaux wine that was only $5. We sat at the bar where the staff was attentive and friendly. My only complaint was I am only 5'4 so there wasn't anywhere that I could comfortably reach to rest my feet as we sat at the bar.

I have travelled around the world and I have tried the most prestigious restaurants, I have also dealt with racial profiling on numerous occasions, but this was hands down the worse experience I have ever had to deal with.

/user_details?userid=jzS5y0FnNVSXmBzMA3D7-w,Fred H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Disappointed by this restaurant's limited menu and wine list. Food options are restricted to a short list of non appealing  choices. The wine list is overpriced for the quality of wines being offered. Many choices but none of them are actually good. The minimum you will spend on a bottle of wine is 50$ which is completely unjustified for the choices being offered. Need to change the sommelier ASAP !!! Food wise, I ordered the Duck and arugula ( was good but nothing spectacular ) and the Bourguignon Braised Flatiron ( delicious but too small a portion) and finished off with the chocolate brownie (too sweet and  nothing to rave about ). My wife had the small fish plate as an appetizer and the Sea Bass as a main course. Her appetizer had more fish in it for 4$ than her 17$ main... Really ??? Even if the decor, service and ambiance are nice, this place is overhyped and you could easily get a better value for your dollar elsewhere . Definitely not worth a return visit."

My group of 7 had an exceptional experience- from booking the table for my wife's birthday to the service, quality of the food, and the fantastic ambience in Old Montreal.We're a group of self-professed foodies and wanted to indulge in a great Montreal meal where we could try a wide variety of dishes. Bocata's small plates (and even the entree sized dishes) were perfect for this. We came to Montreal from (respectively) Chicago, NYC, and Washington, DC, so are no strangers to good eats. This was truly one of the best food experiences I've ever had and the perfect choice for our crew. After researching where to eat, I emailed Veronique about two weeks in advance to make sure the restaurant could accommodate us and she was very helpful and responsive. Our reservation was for 9 at first, but a few friends had emergencies and couldn't make it- there were no issues emailing Veronique to  update our reservation. Upon arrival, we were seated right away. The server(s) we had were knowledgable and gave us lots of tips and recommendations. I wish I had caught both of their names! They took excellent care of our group.We opted not to order entrees in the traditional manner, but instead ordered plates in 3 or so courses, over a period of time and shared them family style among the entire group so we could all taste as many items as possible. We ordered at our leisure and never felt rushed- we were really able to enjoy all the entire experience. All of the items we tried were outstanding, but the highlights definitely included the lobster and fennel tagliatelle,  the osso bucco (the large portion was perfect for sharing with 7), and the squid ink risotto (we loved it so much, we ordered two plates). The smoked duck confit salad was also a table favorite. Most of us started with a cocktail- mine was the classic old fashioned- really well done. We then switched to wine. While I'd say we are wine lovers, many of the wines listed were way beyond accessible, and that is the only reason I didn't give Bocata 5 stars. Some of the less expensive bottles were only ""meh"", and even those were priced around $45/50 each. I would have liked to have had more options at  a lower price point. We splurged BIG on the food and so wanted to keep things a bit more reasonable on the drink side of things, which was difficult. We did have a bubbly toast for my wife, and selected a pinot noir varietal, which was really nice. All in all, everyone left satisfied and happy- it was a truly enjoyable experience from top to bottom and I hope to make it back to Montreal in the future so I can visit the sister restaurant located next door!Thank you, Bocata!"

A wooden bar, vintage classic books, flickering candle light and large open windows all contributed to a rustic European ambiance. For starters we ordered the cheese plate featuring Quebec fromage and an asparagus dish. Both small plates were very tasty and nicely presented. The glass of Grenache I ordered was smooth, albeit overpriced.The boyfriend went for the sea bass as a main dish. Unfortunately, my meal ended with the starters because there were no vegetarian main dishes featured. I supplemented my meal with snacks at the hotel later.We were grateful to find a cozy place at such a late hour, but if we ever visit Montreal again, we will likely forgo this establishment and locate one with vegetarian options and food at a better value. I was also disappointed to see that most of the diners were Americans, which makes me wonder if this place primarily caters to tourists.

The food & drinks: we started with a combo of charcuterie & cheese, really good! our favorite item on the menu was the veal & manchego, the veal was cooked perfectly, the cheese was melty & it had a hint of something sweet, really good. we also did the short ribs, foie gras & a few specials. they had a nice selection of wines by the glass. the chocolate bread pudding with caramelized bananas & caramel was phenomenal!!!final thoughts: the service was great, if you're really hungry you'll have to order a bunch of small plates as the portions are small, but i highly recommend this place for date night."
/user_details?userid=h4_hjmt1i6ckQJhvfliVDw,Shelley G.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,"The rustic, cozy charm of Bocata comes mostly from an exposed stone wall from the 1700s (or so I was told). My only decor complaint was the plastic prosciutto leg hanging over the bar. Why do restaurants do that??? Everything I tried was excellent, but the dishes ARE small. The scallops were crispy on the outside, tender inside. And the oysters were sooooo clean and mellow. Even one of my dining companions who doesn't like oysters devoured her share. The foie gras was unctuous. My only complaint was that there wasn't enough! And the salmon tare tare had a lovely, but not overpowering, sprinkling of fresh dill. While I didn't flip through the wine list, I saw it from across the table and it was a friggin novel. I'm glad I wasn't in charge of picking!

Truly it felt like we had the little restaurant to ourselves. The decor is rustic-eclectic and the music was unexpected alternative rock which I love (as I stepped into the restaurant The Pixies were playing!!). The music volume was just right and did not at all interfere with intimate conversation. Our 2 female servers were incredibly nice and took the time to chat with us and answer some questions we had. We mainly ordered some small plates and drinks which were freshly prepared and delicious. We ordered the cheese plate, sea smelts with aioli (just like I've had in Spain!), and Pata Negra de Bellota (the absolute best quality Spanish jamon iberico-expensive but worth it). If you plan to go later around dinner time then reservations are a must as the restaurant is very popular and fills up quickly. The menu options are limited but for good reason- the food is prepared fresh with the highest quality ingredients and done well. It is expensive,yes, but this is typical of the area as you are paying for the wonderful ambience and experience as well as the delicious food."

It  is a cute restaurant and the waitress was sweet even if she asked me if I ""was still working"" on my food and asked me twice if everything was ok. The  wine pour really annoyed me. Very little wine in the glass and when I complained she explained that all the pours are measured out. The menu was very limited and my  pork  entree was too salty.  My husband's fish was pretty good, but we came away with an overall ""mediocre"" impression of this establishment. I would not return."

Service: genuinely friendly and no stone left unturned, with a stop in from the sommelier, who provided helpful input on the delicious ""new style"" Bordeaux we ordered. Shiny, happy, pretty people, vibe relaxed (it's Montreal!) but the food experience lives up to any expectations you might have. I had a lobster tagliatelle -- the sauce it comes with was so perfect it nearly made me pass out, and I confess I had to get every last drop by mopping it all up with bread as well. My lovely companion enjoyed an octopus salad that was also first rate. Tagliatelle has what so many other places with tapas and wine and ""foodie cred"" lack: warmth."
/user_details?userid=HQv3cpiQz4vd7LWyn7JH1Q,Lesley T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Bocata has a eclectic, funky decor and a cozy, dark, cavernous vibe. More importantly, they have a good wine list (creatively pasted in the pages of an old book) and a pretty decent by-the-glass wine selection. You can order a half or a full glass, which is fun because you can try more that way. If you ask nicely, they might even give you a tasting sample to try before you commit. The per glass prices are a little steep, but pretty on par for the neighbourhood (Old Montreal).They also do some really tasty tapas-sized dishes. The salmon tartare is refreshingly innovative, the oysters are fresh, and there's usually some dish involving lobster.  They also occasionally hold special tasting events (for example, a tasting menu paired with Spanish wines, wines from Jura, sherry, etc.). Although it is technically a wine bar, they do seem to expect you to order food, and I would recommend going for a light meal or snack rather than just for drinks. It's a small space, so reservations are recommended to avoid disappointment."

/user_details?userid=7qzfClFiE3SchM3F3MwIpA,N P.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"Be aware of the concept before you rejoice about the prices - $14 for such appealing dishes does sound like a bargain. This small restaurant will serve you small plates and not actual dishes. I thought the Old Port was facing some severe disinflation effects for a second. Hungry stomachs should aim for at least three dishes.Within a brick-designed interior, filled with trendy and wannabe uptight crowd, the menu reveals some pretty interesting dishes. I had some pretty good oysters and duck salad. Additionally, their signature meat style will literally melt in your mouth. I wish I tried their Carbonara homemade gnocchi (which aren't named gnocchi and not potato-based). Moreover, their Pear Sorbet is appreciable and their by-the-glass wine list is quite diverse (Oregon, France, Ontario).And here comes another trick by the way: you can get half-glasses of wine for $9. Despite their very stylish wine bar, I am quite reluctant to pay almost $20 for a sizable glass of decent wine.Despite a tasteful experience, I have mixed feelings regarding the service. Surely not pretentious as the environment might suggest, but not really careful and diligent . The food presentation is not appealing and the waiters will actually bring all of your plates at the same time thus encumbering your space. Friendly overall, however.Bocata is still a recent place and has quite some potential but simple details do go amiss. Too bad there is not a 3.5 stars rating available though.To enjoy for a late diner if you are not too hungry."

The food was average, the surf and turf was delicious, charcuterie not so great. The chocolate bread pudding needed serious work. Anyone who said it was amazing is either an invalid or has no clue what good food tastes like. The one thing I wasn't impressed with was the wine-by-the-glass list. Who the hell buy a $33-$45 glass of wine ? I'm not interested if it's exclusive or not. It's an open bottle and nobody in the right mind would water their time. That was upsetting, otherwise great decor, hip crowd and decent yet pricy food."

Dishes are very nicely presented and delicious, albeit on the small side; they are tapas. A surprisingly varied wine list (by the glass) for such a small establishment; affordable prices.We started with the Duck confit salad (we enjoyed it so much, later ordered another); p i n t a d e e t m o r i l l e s a u v i n j a u n e (only thing is it left us wanting more of the confit de pommes de terre au curry ); Queue de homard rôtie en viennoise de basilic, mayonnaise romesco et salade de fenouil au citron was beautifully presented I wanted to take a pic but was not willing to use flash, tasted as good as it looked; J O U E D E B O E U F's wine sauce was among the best I've tasted; the d e s s e r t d u m o m e n t was a molten chocolate cranberry brownie sprinkled with crushed pecans and served with sorbet; mom had p a i n p e r d u a la b r i o c h e a u c h o c o l a t avec Bananes à la fleur de sel caramélisées (only thing tiny short coming aside from the candle's size-too big for the small table) the chopped hazelnuts were not crisp.I'd return with the specification that again we'd start our evening early, we had a 6:30 p.m. reservation, half-way through the meal the place filled up and the service while professional and extremely informative, of course, became harder to get.Small restaurant, small plates, big flavours - was the title of one of the reviews I read and I agree with.La chambre est petite et confortable, le menu limité. Le service est professionnel. Les plats sont très bien présentés et délicieux, bien que sur le petit côté; ils sont des tapas. Une carte des vins étonnamment diverse (par le verre) pour un si petit établissement; prix abordables.Nous avons commencé par la salade de confit de Canard (nous l'avons aimé(l'avons joui de) tellement, a commandé plus tard un autre); p je n t un d e e t le m o r je l l e s un u v je n j un u n e (il a été laissée nous voulant plus du confit de pommes de terre au le curry); la file d'attente de homard rôtie en viennoise de basilic, la mayonnaise romesco et salade de fenouil au le cédrat a été admirablement présentée j'ai voulu prendre un photo, mais n'ai pas été enclin à utiliser le flash, goûté aussi bon qu'il a regardé; J O U E D E B O E U F la sauce de vin d'était parmi le mieux que j'ai goûté; le d e s s e r t d u m o m e n t était un brownie de canneberge de chocolat fondue aspergée de noix de pécan écrasées et a servi avec le sorbet; la maman avait p un je n p e r d u b la r je o c h e un u c h o c o l un t avec Bananes à Fleur la de sel caramélisées (seulement la chose l'arrivée courte minuscule à part de la taille aussi de la bougie grande pour la petite table) les noisettes coupées n'étaient pas craquantes.Je retournerais avec la spécification que de nouveau nous commencerions notre soirée tôt, nous avions 18h30 la réservation, au milieu du repas la place rempli et le service tandis que le professionnel et extrêmement informatif, bien sûr, est devenu plus durement pour arriver.Le petit restaurant, de petites assiettes, de grandes saveurs - était le titre d'un des revues que j'ai lus et je suis d'accord."

Bocata did not disappoint! We did not have reservations but were seated no problem at a nice table by the window. The ambiance was beautiful: dimly lit, low music - exactly what we were looking for. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and had fantastic suggestions. We ordered the charcuteries plate to share which was simply divine! We followed this with the warm octopus salad and oysters. Our server paired our dishes with delicious wine (by the glass) and it was truly a great meal. The reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because they were all out of their specials (on a Wednesday evening?) and we had an unusually long wait for our drinks, +25 minutes. The server apologized and brought us a free dessert and glass of dessert wine which more than made up for the wait. I would definitely go back again."

Our server was delightful.  The atmosphere was picture perfect...almost like a movie set...too good to be true but it was! They offer something like tapas...the plates are slightly larger. We ordered four items plus a mixed drink for him and a glass of pinot noir pour moi. We began with a rare Spanish charcuterie...some kind of pig that was only fed acorns its whole life. Two of the pig's friends' legs were hanging just over the bar! Wow! What a unique flavor.  There is nothing to compare. Next we had an arugula salad with smoked duck. To die for. Lastly, we were served braised beef cheek with caramelized onions and the lightest mashed pots followed by a pasta dish that was like the goddess of mac n cheese. All plates were beautifully presented.  Everything everything everything made this the hands down best meal I have ever had!Also, they were playing the most excellent mix of indie and adult contemporary music."
/user_details?userid=8aDX57XvLvFkgfyBA-LVRQ,Monique T.,"White Plains, NY",5 star rating,"Had a truly wonderful meal here, though a few things must be mentioned. They seem to have 2 main seatings for dinner, which means that you either eat a little earlier or later than you might wish. Our choices were 6:30 or 9:30. On the positive side, they did not rush us in any way, so we were able to spend a leisurely 2.5 hours over dinner, which was nice. The wine choices are extensive, and although we weren't familiar with the bottles they had, they were very knowledgeable and our server (possibly the owner?) seemed to really be interested in finding something that we would enjoy in our price range. In the end we were happy with the selection, but make no mistake: wine here is not cheap. If you go by the glass they have two sizes: small and smaller (2.5 and 5 oz glasses, which will run you about $7-9 for the small and $11-14 for the larger.  It's definitely worth getting a bottle.The plates, served tapas style, are truly small, and are definitely pricier than what you would expect from tapas restaurants, but saying that, everything we had was fantastic.  We had the iberian ham over garlicky bread (outstanding in taste but a very small portion), cured salmon (better size and equally tasty), mountain and sea (lobster meat set atop possibly the best short ribs I have ever tasted), seared scallops with red cabbage (gorgeous)  and the chocolate bread pudding with Carmel sauce (I was depressed when the plate was empty!!). These five dishes were enough for two of us; we were pleasantly full but not stuffed. Hungry diners might need another dish or two. Atmosphere was very cosy and romantic, and there were a mixture of couples and parties of six or so.  Service was efficient but not intrusive. I would definitely return and recommend Bocata, but it isn't cheap so be prepared."

All were very good. There also is a selection of unique house drinks. Very friendly staff and good service. The tables are a bit crowded, so no private conversations, but that was fine with us.

The best ambience of any restaurant I've ever been to. It's beautiful inside; super cozy, candles everywhere, almost like a cellar with pretty windows looking outside. Everything was presented beautifully (eg their wine list is taped to the pages of old books, and we had a nice basket of fresh homemade bread while waiting for our food). I don't know why everyone is complaining about the wine; it's a WINE BAR, so obviously tons of the choices are expensive wines imported from Europe etc., but they also have wines by the glass that are less expensive and still wonderful. The food was absolutely amazing. Yes, a bit pricey, but we thought it was very much worth the price for a special occasion (and we're broke students, so I think we're pretty reliable when it comes to value for our money). The portions are small (which our waiter warned us about) because of the tapas style restaurant but I honestly don't know how people say they left here hungry; I order the tomato soup (great) and the lobster gnocchi (amazing) and couldn't finish the second dish because it's all so rich! Sometimes it's not about the big portions but the quality of the food. We also got the brownie with salted caramel and blood orange sorbet and found it unbelievable as well. And, most importantly, SO UNPRETENTIOUS! So many restaurants in old montreal tend to look down on students (we spend money sometimes too, however rarely) but we were treated so well and seated promptly even without reservations. Overall really great experience as long as you know what you're getting and don't expect it to be something it's not. Would recommend this forever (clearly!)"

This restaurant is tastefully decorated and not lacking for details. Out server greeted us and let us know the sommelier was present should we have any questions. This a tapas-style restaurant and our server suggested 2-4 plates a person. The two of us shared three plus a bottle of wine and dessert and were definitely satisfied. Our first two plates were a variety of five tomatoes with truffle oil and the duck and arugula. Both were absolutely fantastic! To follow we had the beef cheek. I dont have words to describe this dish. The beef was melt-in-your mouth delicious while the sauce it came with begged to be sopped up by bread which soon followed - two types to be precise. Our dessert (although not necessary) was a strawberry shortcake. This dish was just ok, but it did have to follow those beef cheeks. I would have had those for dessert.Overall, I would recommend this restaurant, but be sure to make a reservation to avoid disappointment."

This place far exceeded expectations.  To start, the waitstaff was incredible, courteous, attentive, and knowledgable of the5 menu and wine list.  For 2 of us,  We started with the 60g cheese course, paired with chenin blanc.  All locally sourced cheeses and enough that we could each have a satiable portion and truly  enjoy each cheese.  They offer wines by the half and whole glaseses, so you can easily pair wines with your course selection. From there, we moved on to the braised leeks with truffle and duck confit with arugula.  Both were out of this world, wonderfully balanced, and again perfectly portioned. The waitress brought us multiple samples of wines to taste to find the perfect pairing.  For entrees, we had the half lobster,and the veal with manchego. Both beautifully cooked and presented.   This was one of the best restaurants, meals,culinary experience ive had in a long time. I would highly recommend to anyone eating out in montreal."
