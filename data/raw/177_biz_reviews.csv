/user_details?userid=dFiLvHPC9BPfzhxv7XC_ig,Truc N.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Long overdue review, came for an evening business dinner. I enjoyed every dish I had, and the dinner here remains one of the most memorable meals I had in Montreal. I would definitely make it a point to return! The ambiance is small, lively, yet intimate. It feels like it's not trying too hard.Burrata - Fresh, soft, buttery, creamy and wonderful accompaniment with spices.Brioche toast with foie gras - The most epic toast I've ever had and probably the best foie texture and flavor. Bread was light and buttery, yet also flaky and crisp. The figs balanced it out nicely and every bite was a different experience and new combination of the flavorsRibeye - Tender, fatty, and flavorful. Not too much gristle."

I must say that the bill certainly wasn't cheap!We started with cocktails and beers...great selection of cocktails which all looKed and tasted great! For cocktails , they use big blocks of ice so you are not getting much out of your glass but presentation is 5*.The food was also pretty good but not a single fish really stood out. I had ordered the paella which is one of the house the signature dish. The portion for 2 was $75 and for one was $45. It was good but wouldn't say the most authentic and flavourful paella I've tasted. For that price, there was 2 scallops, 2 jumbo shrimps and a couple of squid of calamari in the bowl. I thought they were a bit cheap on the seafood for the price but given that it is in the old port, everything is overpriced!Désserts were ok but not amazing either.I'm giving this 4* because it was good and service was also  good but I would say you have better options elsewhere for cheaper."

The service was EXCELLENT and the food (and drinks) were great too! There is literally a book of different types of alcohols (gins, bourbons, etc) to choose from and the drinks did not disappoint.  The food was a nice combination of flavors and just perfect for two people.  It was a bit on the pricey side but very worth it!"

Our server was ready to breakdown the menu for us but we already knew what we wanted because we've been reading the reviews for a while. The short beef ribs will melt in your mouth ... OMG it comes right off the bone and just will wake up every taste bud you have!!!!Price is a little high but worth it for the food and service, I would definitely come back for date night or special occasion."

First, Canadian French music greeted me at the entrance and the curtains parted. A charming young lady said 'Bonjour'. In this gastronomic tale, she acted as both the main greeter and the Wizard of Oz of cocktails. First, this pairing sorceress suggested the light and savory Ostrogoth cocktail, a signature drink here, which I ordered to accompany fresh oysters from Prince Edward Island. Not only was it a fantastic combination of flavors, but also a personal, albeit perhaps eccentric, tribute to Anne with an 'e' from Green Gables. Yes that LM Montgomery series of books loved by all. Next came a pasta dish with a white sauce and slivers of shaved truffle. In a word...  There is no ONE word that can righteously describe the joy when the flavor hits the tongue. Every bite was baptized by a perfect draught if orange wine. This pairing worked so well that they should just get married already!What is the key to the map of a memorable journeythrill your palette?  The answer is simple. Trust your bartender. (If you get Audria, you are in very good hands)."
/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow, this place is so right on so many levels. Cozy, romantic, candle lit, the perfect special date place. Let's start with the amazing hand crafted cocktails. The bartender really knows what he's doing. The lazer etched ice cubes are a nice touch to a fantastic drink! I started with a few oysters finished with small cubes of foie gras, simple and amazing flavor. The enormous rib-eye was a perfect medium rare and could not have been better. The bartender paired a beatiful red wine with the steak, it's nice getting that kind of quality in a wine by the glass. My experience at Barroco exceeded expectations and I can't wait to go back!"

/user_details?userid=ny-v5lBVnZe5LK4nDHHKMg,Talisa K.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Incredible.Easily reserved a Sunday night dinner with 3 other friends, and our overall experience was amazing. My only disclaimer is that you should come here prepared to drop a pretty penny (especially if you're having wine).We had the Paella, beef short rib, beef Wellington (SO good but it was also $89), a salad, and some small apps. Favourite was definitely either the short rib or the beef Wellington. Ambiance, as you can probably tell from the other reviews, was cozy, rustic, and completely fitting of a restaurant sitting in the middle of old Montreal. It was actually kind of romantic. I would definitely go here for a date night.Recommend!"

The outside drew us in, with lush plants and vintage, yet bright decor. When you enter it's super cozy and has a lodge feel - plush seating, and well throughout accents.We sat at the bar, where our charismatic bartender befriended us and helped us navigate the menu. He also made incredible cocktails, including smoking the glass right in front of us! The beef Wellington cannot be missed! Also, the pasta was one of the best I've ever had (and I'm a big carb fan).If you can grab a table at this small spot, it's definitely worth it!"
/user_details?userid=oiYLcEogLEz7HoQNyy6jpw,Paul A.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,"Came here with my wife for our anniversary. The beef Wellington was probably the best beef Wellington my wife and I ever had. Honestly it blew our minds away. Our waitress was awesome too. We had two types of oysters, regular fresh oysters and oysters with foie gras... they were good. We also had the burrata which was amazing. We had one of their specials which was uni (sea urchin) but we didn't really enjoy that hence the four stars. We felt like they could have gave us a bit more uni because there was barely any. Everything else was superb! Will definitely come back again."

This cosy, I want to say, Pyrenees flavored resto is so rich in period ambiance, you feel like you are dining in the 18c. Had oysters with a little cube of foie gras appetizer that was just inspired. The sommelier made excellent pairings. Couldn't have enjoyed my dinner more."
/user_details?userid=LOSpRieXt7b009o9ewtwaQ,Kim F.,"Holmes, PA",1 star rating,"While I wanted to say this was a great meal with great service I cannot. We had Paella, Short Rib and the Branzino. Unfortunately the Branzino was loaded with pin bones. We asked for the fish to be deboned and it was delivered beautifully with garnish that only hid the danger. No one checked on us during the meal and a stack of 7 pin bones from one bite of fish is unacceptable. We told the waitress who finally came by the table and to our astonishment she shrugged and left the table and came back with our check. A restaurant of this caliber missed the mark on both food and service. $166 for 3 entrees and no beverages and not only was there not an apology but the waitress shrugging and walking away just is not what one would except from a dining establishment of this caliber."

There was little to no wait when we arrived, which was great. Everyone was polite. Ordered a paella dish for two which was more expensive than the place next door and way less authentic. The paella was topped with a mayonnaise aioli-- not good for someone allergic to eggs. The waiter and chef were good about replacing the dish, after questioning how serious my intolerance was. They replaced it with a risotto. While the food here is good, It would be great if unspecified ingredients like eggs or mayonnaise were not added to classic dishes. At the very least, perhaps take into account that people order certain foods based on dietary needs. Alert customers if something extra is added to the dish."

The cocktails were great, but I have to admit that we were disappointed by the food. Very average tasting for such an expensive meal! Nothing to write home about as far as our meals were concerned and we actually really disliked our burrata app (how do you make burrata taste bad?!). Overall, 3 stars."

Servoce is excellemt and our waiter was top of the top. Food was 10 out of 10.We had a winter sald magnificent and cold meat entry super tasty. Main course: i had the pork rib that was as soft as ever I had before and an incredible taste.My boyfriend had pork chops which were excellent and with a touch of botarga which sounds crazy maybe being fosh but was a perfect choice. Too full for dessert... aperitives were excellent too as the glass of French red wine. We will be back.

/user_details?userid=LQOlIcL7xkN7THLm-eQWOw,Gina M.,"Bentonville, AR",5 star rating,"A fast trip to Montreal, tonight I was looking for someplace close to my hotel. Total win! Barroco was a lovely, warm environment with exceptional service. Although reservations are recommended, they found me a cozy spot by the bar- no problem with my impromptu visit. The Nagano Pork Chop was so tender I cut it with my fork. Confit endives? Perfection. And save room for dessert."
/user_details?userid=sbVdImPlVRuf3-byN1F16A,Nicole A.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Oh man, that burrata! Barroco is an intimate space with a rustic and rich decor. Brick walls house a boar head, there is a great fireplace, and the seats were a rich, beautiful leather. Seating is very limited and the bar is tiny so make a reservation or get there early. We got there just in time because it filled up very fast. I ordered the aforementioned burrata and it was SO GOOD. It was topped with truffle shavings and surrounded by a perfect amount of olive oil. This burrata was so creamy, so perfectly fluffy yet dense, and the truffle shavings made me want to weep. The bread that came with it was dense but airy and it was delicious but I wish there was more of it because I ended up eating the rest of the cheese with a fork. After that, I had the beef tartare which came with a sauce in the middle that only upped the delicious flavors. Really good. For dessert, the kouign amann mille-feuille with chocolate and hazelnut. Amazing. The buttery kouign amann with the chocolate and hazelnut stacked between it was the perfect amount of rich sweetness with a light, crispy texture. You have to get this. Service was good, we didn't get to see our waiter much after it got super busy but other staff really helped out. Pricing is on the high end but the ambience and delicious flavors make it worth it."

Had to to wait 15 for someone to take our drinks order after we were seated. It took another 20 mins for us to get them. There was one waiter in the entire restaurant who was very mellow and really took his time with everyone. Every stop at every table was a 3-5 min conversation with laughter, which would be a nice personal service if diners didn't have to wait for an hour+ for appetizers :)"

But let me explain the short rib is beyond amazing and truly falling off the bone. The flavors are succulent. I switched my side to the potatoes and it was a great choice to grab the gravy from the reduction of the short rib. Yum. Hubby had the pork chop and I'm floored how flavorful it taste. Please try this place. Service, food and drinks are amazing."

/user_details?userid=-We9ZRNWZcitO53j1Is7HA,June P.,"Brooklyn, NY",2 star rating,"My dinner at Barroco was highly anticipated after looking forward to our Montreal trip for weeks. The enticing photos and descriptions, the glowing reviews... all had me pretty hyped up for our first meal in town. It was colder than expected and starting to rain when we arrived, so Barroco's cozy interior was a welcome respite while the friendly service made us feel at home. So far, all the makings of a great meal. However, the food itself was such a letdown!Amuse bouche of oysters with seared foie gras (at $6 a pop!) should've been a match made in heaven, but the tiny niblet of foie barely made an impression while the oysters were kind of sad and deflated. Foie gras poached in red wine and five spice sounded tasty on paper, but somehow it had less flavor than a cold stick of unsalted butter (same exact texture, though). The photogenic seafood paella was ordered by almost every table, so hopes were high. The short ribs also looked impressive, so maybe the apps were a fluke. The paella tasted like something I attempted to make at home for the first time. The rice was cooked properly, but it just didn't wow anyone at the table. Short ribs were flavorless and dry! Even under all that sauce. Not overcooked, but as if it had been sitting out for a while and then covered in a glacé to compensate. The mashed celery root underneath was bland and confusing. It's clear that they take pride in being around for over a decade, but all those years can't make up for the overpriced, subpar food. Not the 5-star meal I was hoping to kick off our time in Montreal; guess you can't trust Yelp anymore!"

/user_details?userid=WA9fjdFYyWon5ecMRUrJRg,Robert K.,"Milford, CT",5 star rating,"This place hits the mark on so many levels. Location wise, it's perfect. It's on a charming, slightly less trafficked section on the far west side of Old Montreal. It's open air and a beautifully designed space. The interior atmosphere is rustic, but not stuffy (judging by the wild boar on the wall that's proudly wearing a #foiegras hat). Service is excellent. Food is excellent. Everything we tried was great. Taste of Summer was a great starter. The Paella is excellent. Probably the favorite dish overall was the shortribs. Just incredible all around. The Maple Old Fashioned sounded like it could be gross and overly sweet on paper, but worked really well.Highly recommended!"

Her recommendations were perfect to fit her positive vibrant attitude! Beautiful restaurant. Very cosy and open, beautiful bar. My boyfriend & i spent a weekend here in MTL to visit my family/attend a wedding & one of the days we spent for date night :) and of course me being obsessed with yelping everything before i go there this place was on our top 3 because we heard great things about their seafood paella. Our appetizer was the lobster gaspatcho definitely did not go wrong with that. I ended up dipping the complementary bread into it  and for my main dish i got a salmon plate served with  bread similar to pita bread & carrots. It also came with this cream sauce which was delicious. My boyfriend of course had the paella. The star of this show was definitely not the paella even though it was very good but the beverages.!, I will go through drinks by round and it should give you an idea of how our night went. 1. Me:passion fruit mojito     BF: double crown & coke 2. See #1 3. See #1 4. Me: a blueberry cocktail w/thyme leaves (obviously at this point i didnt remember the name) BF: an awesome drink with smoke and liquor that tasted of candy. We were obliterated. One of the best date nights we have had just because of the drinks."
/user_details?userid=dZZ8aTW5YzGrcUgl9z1yEg,Nonka M.,"White Plains, NY",4 star rating,"This place deserves a 5 star for ambiance, it's beautifully decorated, in all other respects it's way too overpriced for what they offer. Wa had a burrata special (unique combination of cheese, shrimp, mushrooms and mint) and oysters for appetizers. For entrees we had shortrib (39 CAD) and halibut (33 CAD). With de drinks the bill came to about 200 CAD which is pretty pricey and I'm convinced we could have had a better experience at the less pricey venue. On the positive side, if you are on a date and you are into splitting the bill, this place makes it easy, as the minute we asked for a bill, the waitress asked if we wanted to split the bill."

/user_details?userid=hSkVoiuSoUlPf9OH5m0SIg,Scott B.,"New Orleans, LA",2 star rating,"A very nice setting, but the food did not meet our expectations. Perhaps we were naive to order paella in Quebec (like ordering gumbo in Boston), but the dish we were served had never seen a paella pan. Rather, it was a somewhat soupy and overcooked rice dish, served in a bowl. When I told our server that I missed the crispy bottom that is characteristic of a good paella, he told me it was their version, made with Arborio rice. I'm sorry, but paella can be prepared with a thousand different ingredients, over a stove or over a wood fire, but it is a venerable dish that must be prepared in a shallow paella pan. We paid $79 Canadian for an elaborate bowl of rice, not quite as al dente or creamy as risotto, and definitely not paella.Service was polite but erratic-- we were rushed at the beginning of the meal, but it took half an hour to get our check after we requested it."

From the friendly quick and attentive service to the beautiful rustic, cozy yet elegant decor inside to the delicious food. We made a reservation for 8pm on a Saturday night and even though the restaurant was very busy we didn't have to wait at all to be seated. We had some wine and oysters to start - the oysters were so fresh and came with really nice sauces. We did also try their foie gras special oyster which was just ok the foie gras didn't really add much to it , stick with their classic oysters fresh and delicious ! Their paella was to die for such great flavour with chorizo shrimp octopus scallops and the option to add lobster (extra cost), I loved the paella delicous and very filling. We also tried their guinea fowl special stuffed with wild mushroom/lasagna which was also very tasty but I have to say the paella was the star. For dessert we had the lime goat cheese cake it was so smooth and zesty it was like a cross between cheesecake and key lime pie and their classic creme brûlée which was just perfect. They do have one beautiful table/booth area for a group but other than that I would say space is limited so definitely make a reservation even just for two people since this place fills up fast and understandably so. This is a great place for a nice dinner for an occasion , a bit on the pricey side but the food is outstanding , the decor is lovely and the service is excellent !"

We went to the first place we saw that was open and had eggs and were not disappointed at all. Very cozy place, friendly servers, and the food was just what we wanted. I had the shakshuka with poached eggs and chickpeas and my husband had a great Old Montreal breakfast with maple baked beans and maple bacon that was thick-cut and cooked perfectly. The portions were just the right size. We tried the beignets, too, but they were only okay. Coffee was stellar. Sidenote: my husband is Indian, so when he asked for hot sauce, the server must've seen the deflated/insulted look on his face when they put a little bottle of Tabasco in front of him and immediately returned with some Scotch Bonnet West Indian thing that made him smile big. (I'm not a super spicy fan, but even I liked it.) Nicely done!"

The food is just adequate and the service ranged from slow to surly. Really too bad. I hope the owner takes this as constructive criticism.

The wine suggested was perfection with our meal for 4. The Burrata and peas was fresh and delicious. I shared the bone in rib eye with my sister accompanied by truffle butter, roasted cauliflower and mashed potatoes. The mortadella appetizer was better than the mortadella I've had traveling throughout Italy. And again,.... the WINE! I wanted to be selfish and not review but they deserve the accolades. Best restaurant I've been to in a long time."

Exposed brick, very dark lights, secluded tables ... right in the heart of Old Montreal.I ordered the short ribs which were delicious but absolutely not worth $39.  My date ordered pasta - this was a very small portion with no protein whatsoever - for over $20.  It really should not have been priced at more than $12.  Although the quality of the food was good (including the pre-dinner bread), the prices at this place are simply too high."

Big open window by the front provided a nice breeze. We ordered cocktails. I had the white negroni and it was incredible! I make a mean negroni and this one was as tasty and refreshing. I can't remember what the girlfriend had but it was also delicious. So good we ordered 2 rounds.  Food wise, we shared the octopus appetizer and also shared the steak 31oz with truffle butter with a side of mushrooms... Medium rare steak, cooked perfectly.  The food was simply amazing! Delicious in so many ways my taste buds were dancing! Steak was one of the best I've had!  Can't say enough but would definitely recommend this place. Staff were friendly and fun.  Place was expensive but worth it."

One can only imagine that in the tourist season it is packed.For good reason. The service is warm and attentive. The charcuterie appetizer wonderfully presented and excellent, although for my taste the mustard mayo could have had a bit more bite. The rib steak was perfect, coated with a delicious chimichurra and unfettered with vegetables. A side of perfect smashed potatoes for form.The wine a glass (or two) of a delicate and fresh Barbaresco. I have eaten here twice, once in the glow of a summer love, and tonight alone on a business trip. This establishment hits all the high points for either experience."

Though I loved the playlist the volume was a little high which I didn't mind but some might. So the restaurant is loud. It is also a bit warm which is unusual for a restaurant. Loved the house salad, short ribs and the mushrooms. My partner had the special which was very good The only negative would be the service which was hurried quite rushed not attentive and with that slooow. I do think the poor service was server specific as other tables had quite good service. So to summarize great music great food subpar service. I would eat here again."

However, upon arriving here I feel as though we were treated pretty rudely. Originally, we arrived without a reservation and were asked to come back in another hour and a half. Totally understandable, not an issue, but when I asked if they needed my number to alert us that our table was ready, the hostess looked at me and said to me curtly, ""No, your table will be ready at the time I already specified..."" Fine, so we left to walk around and wait.When we came back and were finally seated, they didn't give us our menus for 5 minutes. They seated a party of 3 and gave them menus even though they arrived after we did.The paella itself was okay. Nothing too special that I would rave about to anybody else. The foie gras was this restaurants saving grace, really the only thing that I was impressed by.To be honest, I probably wouldn't return or recommend this restaurant to my friends unfortunately."

The service was exceptional and the staff very friendly. This is a cute and quaint spot located in Old Montreal. The ambience is charming and had a rustic feel to it. Our food journey, while we sat at the bar begins...1. Amuse Bouche- Huitre and Foie Gras (Oysters)Foie Gras topped with a coulis sauce and combined with the taste of the ocean was definitely worth it! Must try.. 2. PaellaSquid, shrimp, scallop, morcilla, chorizo....all of these ingredients combined to give you the authentic spanish taste that will leave you wanting more..3. Braised duck leg parmentierPaired with a side of bay leaf and coriander scented salad. The pulled meat....beyond tender....topped with a thick layer of butternut squash and Foie Gras..absolutely amazing! The Foie Gras really enhanced the  flavour of the meat and added a kick to the bite!The drinks...1) Pimm's Cub - wonderful flavours of the carribean, topped with pomegranate and fig.2) Tsar - martini-like drink paired with rosemary, topped with caviar.

Not only do the cocktails have a unique spin, the food unquestionably delicious, the décor cozy, sexy, unique, intimate and chic, but the staff adds to the charm factor and experience. I have been to this restaurant on three difference occasions and each time, the staff perfects what other restaurants lack, which is personality and charm that adds to the whole experience.

/user_details?userid=h_4hGmsccoUcja_ufMYVNA,Ethan P.,"South Lake Tahoe, CA",5 star rating,"We got off a 6hr train ride from Toronto, opened our suitcases & changed, and walked in the cold and ice (1st time in Montreal; from LA ) down to the gorgeous location of Barroco! We started off with the Maple Old Fashioned (very smooth, mature feeling, just enough sweetness) and oysters. There were two varieties. I tried the special tiny sex on the beach oyster 6$ that came on top of black rock salt and was topped with foie gras & a fancy fruity something I can't pronounce. Living in CA I've had some incredible oysters but this creation blew my expectations out of the water, by far the best oyster I've had in my life. My mom ordered the two regular varieties; standard sex on the beach & a bigger variety, both came with delicious house sauces to try, a huge upgrade from the common lemon/horseradish/cocktail sauce I'm used to! After that we ordered the opposites because that's just how good their oysters are! We then had a half order of the buratta, & their house olives with pimento peppers. The cheese was topped with an incredible olive oil & sardines, served on toast (slightly burnt on one piece but not a big complaint), which was utterly mesmerizing with our second round of drinks; the Rococo (good refreshing semi sweet cocktail) & the Upside General (reminiscent of a classy boozy iced tea, very herbal, creamy, and earthy). For our entree we split the short ribs which was actually one giant rib full of meat! We added the mashed potatoes & mushrooms which brought it all together adding the sauce & puree on the potatoes literally it all melts in your mouth! Ended up with a tiny bit of leftover entree to take home sooo good! Finally we split a Death in the Afternoon and the creme brûlée! For such a staple dessert I was a bit apprehensive, but Barroco delivered yet again! So silky, like a creme pudding made of velvet with a perfect crunchy caramel layer on top! And not too sweet the perfect balance of flavors! The Death in the Afternoon included Absinthe (my first time trying) & was heavy with anise flavors as well. Not sure if it was the anise or the absinthe but I personally could barely drink it due to the flavor, it just didn't sit well with me but that could be just a personal preference. Simon kindly added a mix of different flavors to make it a little less bitter (though I felt bad about asking; I didn't want to waste it), still it was a bit of a challenge to down the rest of it. The ambience was great! We sat at the bar as recommended by Yelp, & got there early enough that the crowd wasn't too bad. By around 8/8:30, it definitely was getting packed so a reservation is probably a good plan. A bit dim lighting; I can see this being a good date place, bright enough to see, but dark enough to conceal any flaws in your eyeliner . When we arrived we were greeted by the sweetest hostess, who waited patiently while I struggled to get off my coat. Our amazing bartender Simon went through the entire menu in detail, explained every single drink he made, and gave us great tourist ideas for our trip! Seriously Simon helped make our experience that much more special at Barroco! Throughout the night, wooden stylized speakers played an eclectic mix of bomb jams, including Frank Sinatra, Niel Young, BeeJees, & Billy Stewart. Plus everyone at the bar was very kind and friendly & talked with us for a bit. Overall Barocco provided us with some of the best food I've had in my life honestly and I would consider myself a foodie! Incredible balances of flavors, and a well curated menu! The whole experience is easily an 11/10!"

/user_details?userid=fqIdgpwtzVBo-vy8rI7rvg,F B.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,This is a 3 star review for our set course menu on NYE. Upon reserving our table our reservationist kindly mentioned that we will have only two hours to finish our set menu for our reservation. We agreed because it was very understandable considering it was NYE and they must be busy.From the set menu I'd have to say to say the little piece of snow crab was the most satisfying and delicious.For the appetizer I had Rainbow Trout sprinkled with caviar with Blini and chived sour cream was good however I wish I knew it was slightly smoked and marinated before ordering as I wasn't feeling for raw food that night.The sea bass with assortment of sea food was okay there was too much going on in the plate; we didn't really enjoy that.The other dish we had was the venison. I was surprised since this is considered a higher end restaurant they should have at least asked me how I wanted my venison... Med? Rare? Well done ? Nope no one asked .The cool thing is they had cocktails in a bible. I did enjoy scrolling through that. We ordered wine by the glass since the hostess reminded 3 more times upon arrival at the door that we have a time limit of 2 hours. Another thing we did not enjoy so much was the uncomfortable little tables and the music that did not go with the ambiance. There were cool seats in the house we just didn't get to sit there. That's ok tho.Anyway this review is for the set course menu on NYE they may have better food on the regular days. I was just not impressed with what we had.

Interestingly enough the refreshing julep was served in manly Maker's MArk tin cup with a mini-mountain of hand crushed ice. As for the food, well let me tell you... Chef Benjamin Leonard (originally from Lyon) really outdid himself with his Mediterranean inspirations.  We ordered the Seafood Paella which was a treasure of flavors. The scallops were rich, melted in your mouth and cooked to perfection. The beef short ribs were very savory and very tasty. The half lobster was as sublime both to the eye and the palate.

I couldn't remember if I had been here before or their sister restaurant Bocata but once I stepped in I realized I hadn't been here before. Turns out I went to Bocata and that was also delicious but that will be another review.  I really liked the decor at Barocco. It's a small resto with candles everywhere. It's romantic but also a good place to go with friends.  I would come back. So I started with a Truffle Caesar which is made up of Russian Standard vodka , Scorpion silver Mezcal, celery bitters, red pepper, and truffle paste. It was garnished wit pickled beans and iberico ham. My friends didn't like their drink though. One had a strawberry drink that tasted of soap (perhaps there was too much thyme in the drink) lol and my other friend had a grappa cocktail. I don't know the names of their drinks but I did end up finishing my friend's strawberry drink because let's be real no drink should be left unfinished! We shared one appetizer. It was called panzanella and crispy squid. It's made of n'duja ( ""spicy, spreadable pork salumi from Italy. It is typically made with parts of the pig such as the shoulder and belly, as well as tripe, roasted peppers and a mixture of spices""- thank you wikipedia) spread on a slice of baguette bread with Stracciatella di bufala cheese and deep fried squid on top and garnished with cucumber and celery. It was delicious and it had a kick to it. My friend made a comment that it was good but it was something he could make at home and not sure if it was worth $24. We then shared three mains because sharing is caring and we wanted to try as many dishes as possible. We had the duck magret, beef shortribs and paella for 1. The duck magret was delicious and fatty. I've only had good duck magret once before and after that it's been one disappointment after another but this time it did not disappoint. The shortribs were also delicious and fell off the bone. What impressed me the most was the paella. I haven't had really good paella in Montreal but this one was so delicious. My friends too were surprised and we only ordered it because the waitress said it was one of the only dishes that have consistently been on the menu since the opening of the restaurant. FYI the shortribs and the ribeye have also been on the menu since inception. The paella has squid, scallop, chorizo and blood sausage. We were worried that it would be very seafoody because when we walked in the resto it did smell unpleasantly like fish but apparently the smell was due to people ordering the islandic cod. We didn't order dessert. We were actually quite full. I felt it was all worth it."

/user_details?userid=MjnCvt9keYmql0Rm2Jl6Hg,Steve P.,"Albany, NY",1 star rating,"We booked for our wedding anniversary dinner here. Annoyingly called and texted three times to confirm prior to our arrival (one confirmation would have been quite sufficient). When we arrived, they acknowledged that we were there for our anniversary dinner, and then proceeded to sit us at a table right in the front next to a solo diner, when there was almost no one there and plenty of seating to sit us somewhere where we could have some privacy. Instead, we were placed in the front window like window dressing to draw other diners in, and I could reach an arm's length away and literally touch the other diner he was so close. Image making a wedding anniversary toast to your beloved and having every word heard by the solo diner next to you when there is more than sufficient seating to ensure at least some intimacy. According to our server, Julian, everything on the menu he described was incredibly delicious. I ordered the duck breast which he described was boiled in a bag and then slightly seared to perfection.  It was the most bland and tepid duck breast you ever ate. The pappardelle pasta dish my spouse ordered was lacking any real flavor or taste. The wine selection by the glass is severely limited and not worthy of a good restaurant. Clearly, they want you to order an overpriced bottle to find the right selection. The only item that was good and could not be botched were the PEI oysters. The panna cotta was the ONLY item we had that was worthy of a good restaurant. Oh yes, how could I forget that they made it all good (not), by placing sparklers on our desserts. A truly memorable dinner for all of the wrong reasons. My advice is to avoid Barroco like the plague. There are so many much better restaurants nearby, such as Bonaparte, Modavie, Pyrénées and Garde Manger, to name a few. Barroco was overpriced and undeserving. My first instinct upon being seated and reviewing the limited menu and wine selection by the glass was to get up and leave. Trust your instincts. Get up and leave. You deserve better at those prices."

Try greeting people when they come to your restaurant and stand at the front for 10 minutes and  make eye contact with over 3 staff members - at some point somebody should say hello and maybe find out what's going on. Should not be that hard to get a table, so I'm out.

We stayed until the wee hours and had one of the most fun experiences of our lives.Thank you, Barroco, we intend to return next time and try the food!! ;)"

Let me tell you if you want excellent food come to Barroco, if you want god awful service come to Barroco. The food was delicious, however after an hour and fifteen minutes we were asked if we wanted desert without getting our entree. While stating that we did not receive our food yet, the waitress said I'm so sorry and 10 minutes later our food arrived. While it was delicious, they could have cared less that we didn't receive our food as did the two tables who came after us did, just to add another while waiting for our check the two tables received desert before we received the bill. If you want good service don't come here!!!"

Unfriendly staff and a pompous waiter (when he finally came to our table) made this an unpleasant dining experience. The food was well prepared but the portions are very small. For the price, I expected more at every level. We truly felt unwelcome and we will not return, especially when there are so many good options in Montreal. Poor service, mediocre food, small portions and high prices make this place a thumbs down in my book. Stay away!"

They have a drink Bible and an incredible wine list. Ambiance was very nice with a nice vibe throughout the restaurant. I had the quail with pasta Ragu, which was the special for the evening. It was absolutely incredible as to flavor and tenderness of the quail. Portion sizes are just right. The wait staff were very attentive and kept our wine glasses and water glasses filled throughout our stay there. Everyone in our group thoroughly enjoyed their dinner. One person ordered the pasta, another order the oysters, and another ordered the duck. All of us were very impressed with our meal and restaurant experience. I would definitely recommend Barroco if you are in the Old Town area of Montreal."

Lots of character with the classy decor, but simple at the same time. The service was impeccable. The cocktails hit the right spot. The food is something that I will remember for a while.I got the Scarlet and the bf got the Smoking Gun to sip on. He really enjoyed his, which is great, because I am not a whiskey person, so that drink was so not my type. Fear not, mine was definitely my type. We started with a small charcuterie board. I don't like pickled vegetables and it's a near fact. I say near, because that perception changed at Barrocco! The picked cauliflower and the cucumber were oh so good. They were not too vinegary, which is my usual complaint. The toasted bread that came with the meats, jamon, chorizo and the pate, were perfectly grilled, not too crunchy and not too soft.I got the paella for dinner and he got the octopus special. The paella had a good amount of squid, a big disc of scallop, a huge shrimp, and scattered with chrozo and morcilla. A very flavorful dish, but no one ingredient stole the show. His octopus was first sous-vided and then grilled, so it was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The lemon peel puree balanced the heaviness of the gnocchi and the sweetness of the corn.We were quite stuffed, even though I didn't finish my paella. It was a shame that we didn't have room to sample the goat cheese cheesecake. Will definitely go back when we visit Montreal again!"

Decor was like most Montreal restaurants with a hog on wall with other nick- nacks that really bring the delicate ambiance together yet accompany the culture. We were seated quickly since we had made reservations which I suggest anyone going to Montreal should do. Also, as a side note, make sure to keep your phone on because the restaurants will call to confirm your reservations and if you do not answer they will give your reservation away. Ok onto the rest of the review. Service was great and attentive the whole time. I Will say they sometimes run themselves short as one of the waiters was the hostess as well. Now most importantly, the food. My girlfriend and I began with the cheese and charcuterie plate and oysters. Oysters were very good and fresh as well as the meat and cheese board. The ladder had fois gras , grapes, and prunes for extra taste. I has the short ribs as an entre which were delicious with the truffle oil, however, the meat was not that tender. My girlfriend had the special which was a veal chop with eglantine and pea risotto. Very good, but nothing out if this world. The one dessert they offered was a fancy brownie which was less than memorable. Overall, this place was very nice. Ambiance was good and food was definitely worth it!"

Fantastic ambience and very friendly and helpful staff. We got there early so we took a seat at the bar. Since neither my wife or I drink alcohol, we asked for virgin cocktails and I'm glad we did.....their cocktail menu looks like an old first edition book with recipes to select from. Black tea syrup, caramelized ginger, fresh herbs an array of ingredients went into my black mule tea cocktail which was simply amazing. My wife's Bloody Mary was the best I've ever tasted....numerous ingredients blended together to make the perfect drink rich in flavours and smells....she was like a scientist at work and the results were a delight for the senses. The food was similarly made from the best ingredients sourced from across Quebec and farther away. I ordered the Nova Scotia tuna tartare with smoked potato mousse. The fish was delicate and tangy with just the right amount of fish flavour with the creamy and smoky flavour of the mousse. Highly recommended!!The next thing we ordered was a special of the day which was a quail fusilli. The quail was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside where one could taste the gaminess of the meat.....it's just so much better than chicken! I think I really should have more quail from now on...I haven't given this the attention it deserves. Again, I highly recommend this dishLastly, we ordered the beef short ribs. What got my attention was the fact that they've been braised for 12 hours.....and for sure you could taste the flavours of beef in the stewy tender concoction which just melted in your mouth. It was just so rich that I think it overwhelmed my system after just a few bites because I was full and couldn't eat another bite. I'm not so sure about this dish because I felt uncomfortably full after just a few bites of this....maybe I/we were allergic to one of the ingredients because I'm a huge fan of beef stews...but it really unsettled both of our stomachs and we both felt the impact of that for the next 8 hours. I doubt very much that there was anything wrong with the food....that dish just didn't sit well with either of us so I'm not sure I'd recommend this one. All in all, I'd definitely go again and I'd recommend it to my friends"

Now that I've read the bad reviews (many of which seem to be hidden amongst what sounds like a bunch of ""not real"" reviews), I feel sad for falling for this tourist trap! We ordered 4 appetizers and 3 main courses. Each one was inedible. My 1st piece of duck was so rubbery, I had to spit it out. My husband had the 2nd piece and also spit it out. I was unable to cut the 3rd piece of the duck with a steak knife! I let the waitress know and they took it off our bill. The staff was very nice, and it seems that they know how bad their food is. I now regret not telling the waitress about all the other food that was just as bad. We took the pasta to go (since we had already ordered it), but ended up trashing it. Ughhh, just ughhh.

With that said, this is a pretty close second. The ambiance was rustic with loud music that fit my genre. The space is dimly light which is far better suited for a romantic dinner but my friend and I had no problem enjoying the evening. The service was friendly and the sommelier picked a perfect wine for the meal. Only ""issue"" was the long delay for the bill.The meal was excellent. Tomato and Burrata tartelette to start. We didn't know what to think of it because the flavours were interesting in a good way. I believe we concluded we liked it. The mains were rib steak and paella. Rib steak rivalled Gibby's. Absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked. Paella was good. Never had paella before but it reminded me of a jumbalaya as the rice was soft which I was t sure if it was supposed to be crispy. Too full for dessert, which is ashame because the goat cheese cake would have been my choice. For all of Montreal's wonderful restaurants I really enjoyed this one. Well worth it."

And I should mention we've eaten at quite a few steak houses, my husband has even been to a high end steakhouse in Calgary. It beats them all, and it's a better price per oz than you'd pay at a typical Keg. Been here 2 times now, first time was the night my husband proposed 1.5 years ago, second time was on our honeymoon when we spent part in Montreal. We always get the 31oz ribeye steak. I dream of it when I'm home in Halifax. The local cheese board never disappoints, either.It's a small space, cozy, warm and inviting atmosphere.

Fortunately they did not disappoint!We had a reservation for 6:30, they open at 6:00 PM so fortunately it wasn't very packed, we were seated quickly by our hostess who looks a tad bit like Jennifer Lawrence. The restaurant   is very cozy and beautifully decorated and the staff is very attentive. For Starters we had the charcuterie board which was De-li-cious. Unfortunately, I cannot recall what the different cuts were but if you love charcuterie, you will love this. It also included a side of toast with Veal and Tarragon butter, that just melted in your mouth. Drinks, we had the Maple Old Fashioned (which was very smooth and very strong, loved it) and the Pimms Cup (which disappeared before I could even have gotten a taste) For Entree, we had the Ribsteak and the Beef Shortrib which were the highlights of the meal. First of all the Ribsteak was humongous, I have never gone to a restaurant and gotten such a large piece of steak. Better yet it was so soft and the chimichurri sauce just knocked my socks off. Each bit was a small taste of carnivore heaven, I wish I could re-live that moment over and over again. Next was the ever-so-tender Beef shortrib, this was fall off the bone type of meat and it was so delicately flavored that I had to stop myself from stealing it from my girlfriend. Two amazing entrees, sent from the heavens that I would drive all the way back from Boston for (Hmm..maybe next year). This meal was definitely something, I would love to experience again.

People looked cool and young. So I thought this place was right up my alley. Little that I know that I was about to have one of the worst meals I've ever had.I ordered the Chimichurri Bloody Ceaser.. There were way too many unknown ""seeds"" in it making it difficult to drink. Oyster were yummy.. But it's mother nature's creation. You can't ruin that.Our paella was a disaster. The rice was raw, and DRENCHED in oil. Unseasoned, bland... I added salt, pepper, hot sauce... Nothing could save it. After waiting a long while for it I ultimately had to send it back.. We both did. The waiter politely offered me to order something else.. So I ordered the tagliatelle. That was another disaster. Long strings of pasta swimming in oil. I could scoop up full spoons of oil!! It was inedible. I didn't eat it. My friend ordered a salad to replace his paella so he was safe.Don't be fooled by these positive reviews on here. I took a closer look today and they are mostly tourist reviews.. American tourists. They love greasy food. That pool of oil my pasta was swimming in... Well I'm sure they call that a ""sauce"".  I'm an avid foodie. I've dined at top rated restaurants all over the world. But let me tell you that the $61 tiny paella is not what paella should taste like. Our bill was $260 without tip and I left completely famished."

When are all of those things not good, I suppose. ;)  But that's the beauty of Barroco: the food here is universally foolproof. I feel like the only people who won't enjoy the food here are those who are in the mood for an airy, light dish, or have expectations for something super different and inventive.The bar's whiskey drinks are particularly good, even if they are a touch heavy on the sweet stuff (a bit much sugar in the Old Fashioneds, a tad more Sweet Vermouth in a Manhattan than I'd do), but I'm splitting hairs there as a  personal preference.So, is Barroco cheating a little by serving nothing but easy-to-love food & drink? Probably a little. But who cares? They do an exceptional job at it, so just go there, sit back, stuff your belly with deliciousness, and be happy!"

The place was recommended by the concierge at the Ritz who said this was a great spot for cocktails/food and frequented by locals. It also had a sister restaurant next door which has a more French menu while this place is more of a Spanish/French menu. The interior stone walls with Spanish art and wood beam ceilings were cool. We sat near the window where we could see passerbys in the Old Town area. The bar was packed with what looked to be locals who just got off of work enjoying drinks with friends. The handcrafted cocktails took awhile to prepare but well worth the wait. The book of cocktails had its own interesting character. My colleague and I started with an assortment of appetizers including foie gras, beef tartare, and oysters. All were delicious. For my main entree, I ordered the blackened cod which was prepared very well. Love this place. Hope to try the sister restaurant on my next visit to this cool city."
/user_details?userid=OHkSBy3Zmcf27npIUPE-ww,Karen B F.,"Huntington Station, NY",5 star rating,OMG each dish was better than the next. We started with the waiter asking us our possible choices and allowed us to try three wines. We then had the oysters. One was a special with fois gras. OMG. The charcuterie was duck and I literally licked my finger to get what was left on the plate. Dinner. I had the Cornish hen the meat was outstanding the sauce to die for. My husband had the duck. The duck is a different bird than Long Island duck. A bit meaty but absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection with an orange chip that was unique and flavorful. We were offered the mushrooms as a side and they were phenomenal. He explained a traditional drink to cleanse the palette before dessert. It was an apple brandy that not too sweet and a perfect transition into our chocolate creme fresh salted chocolate incredible dessert. This was one of our top meals. The waiter was amazing. He deserves accolades. The music was so odd but it fit so well from Stevie Nicks to Chuck Berry. I have nothing to say but Wow. We will be coming back!  Thank you for a wonderful night!

If you're hungry enough, order everything, do not leave without having the octopus appetizer!! The desserts are insanely portioned, usually on the too big side, and too good.

The decor is very uniquely different, a little bit of romance, Jazzy to funky, to vibrant. They also had a very different track of music that was playing from jazz to 80's rock to 90's hop. Service was more than you can ask for. You can tell this is the place to be when your waiter is really enjoying what he's doing and is provide the best service to his customers. Waiter recommended Ripasso to my colleagues which I sampled and was very rich, full, and fruity. I had the famous seafood paella and it did not disappoint. It was one of the best seafood dishes I've had. It came with really fresh crab, lobster, shrimp and scallop. We also ordered everything in the appetizer menus and they were all delicious.

The atmosphere of Barroco grabs you right off the bat.  It's dark.  Not ""spooky, lurking figures in the shadows with cudgels"" dark, but ""appropriately dim and romantic, with candles in all the right places to illuminate just enough to see"" dark.  Our server was pleasant and accommodating, with plenty of suggestions, but in the end, I had to try the short ribs, and boy, was I happy with my selection. On a trip where I enjoyed pretty much everything I put into my mouth, the short ribs at Barroco were probably up there at the top of the list.  I grow ravenous e'en now as I recall their tender, moist and rich flavor and texture, and while the presentation was a bit slap-dash, I couldn't have really cared less.  I've found a restaurant that competes with Stella for ""best short ribs ever"", and I don't care who knows it.  The lovely atmosphere, great food, and helpful waitstaff are all very positive recommendations - though it is a teeny bit more expensive than you might want it to be, as a treat for an out-of-town fancy dinner, Barroco is a great bet."

/user_details?userid=NNZPCHosCdhkklFlINd4gg,Jenn P.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",5 star rating,"I never write Yelp reviews, but felt like I had to- mostly to give a shout-out to the staff. This review is a little long, but I encourage you to scroll through to the end for service-related stuff.My wife and I made reservations for a Sunday, to round out a little vacation on Montreal. It's one of my favorite cities, and we thought a ""fancier"" dinner would be a great way to do something nice for ourselves. We call ahead to ask about dress code, and were cheerfully told to ""come as you are"". The hostess was polite and kind, and that kind of thing goes a long way with me.We started with some cocktails: I had their version of a Bloody Caesar, with absinthe and truffle salt. It was tasty. I don't think I'm super used to the Caesar vs. Mary, but that's on me. My wife couldn't decide. Our lovely server (also sommelier) was very sweet and offered to decide for her. He brought out some sort of Mezcal drink. I won't describe it, because I don't want to butcher it. Whatever it was, it was delicious. I had one as my second. Our server picked again for my wife, and brought another delicious drink. I'd come again for the cocktails alone. It's clear the folks at the bar know what they are doing. We found the options to be eclectic and creative.For starters we had some oysters, a board of ham, comte, grilled bread, etc. and some olives. All were tasty, with my favorite being the ham and cheese board. The fig jam was a nice addition, and I appreciated the way the comte was shaved into ribbons. It really melted on your tongue. My wife and I split the paella for two. Overall, the dish was delicious. To be fair, I haven't had a ton of paella in my life, but compared to the ones I *have* had- this one blew them out of the water. The rice was creamy and almost risotto like. Well seasoned. The one criticism we had, was that for 75.00, we would have liked to have seen more seafood. We really don't mind paying for a nice meal, but you'd like to feel like you are getting what you paid for. We had one scallop each, and one shrimp each. Both were delicious, but two shrimp and two scallops seems skimpy in a dish that's meant to be shared, and is mostly rice otherwise. It made the mark-up feel excessive. Then again, coming from Boston- who knows. We're so close to the water, our cost of goods could be less.The service is really what I wanted to write about though. So, let me start by saying- it wasn't *perfect*. Our server disappeared for long (real long) stretches throughout our meal, and when he was present, he felt pretty rushed with us. He also just talked fast. I went to add tip for example, and I was trying to explain that I wasn't sure how to use the key-pad. He whisked it away from me, before I could figure it out, saying I did it. When he realized I hadn't, he was sort of like..""oh! no, I guess you didn't add tip!"" It wasn't meant in a rude way. My wife just added it on her end for both of us- so no harm no foul. But if he had just slowed down, it wouldn't have been an issue.I have to say though- because the place is so small, we really got to ""people watch"" at some of the tables around us. DAMN. What an eye opening experience. It really made us appreciate what these servers must see every night. We saw some outright RUDE behavior by several tables, as well as some strikingly bizarre (like the lady with a *flashlight* reading her menu. Um. Please stop shining that in my eyes?). Despite all of this, the staff hustled along, ever polite and courteous.  As I said, our waiter wasn't *perfect* but overall my wife and I found him to be totally charming. I'm assuming that he was gone for long stretches because he was busy. We saw him answering the hostess phone and greeting guests as they arrived- when the hostess was seating parties or checking on things. The women clearing out plates and swapping out dishes was delightful. The hostess was wonderful, as was the busser who took our coats. It's clear that someone is training their staff well- and it shows. I'd give Barroco 4 stars for the price value- but I'm bumping it up for sheer class. It's a lost art, and these guys are doing it and doing it well."

He also enjoyed a glass of (expensive) red wine, which I think was overpriced. I unfortunately ordered the short ribs, which were under seasoned and fatty for my liking. I should have ordered the fish to avoid disappointment. The restaurant is housed in an historic stone building and is comfy, with tables being very close and I'm not sure if large parties would enjoy the lack of elbow room. Romantic: yes value: no"

/user_details?userid=JbgLgoy754EeQrWoQBLX1Q,Jenna M.,"Melbourne, Australia",5 star rating,"It is rare that I ever eat a meal somewhere and then think about it afterwards. For weeks. For months. But, Barroco won my food heart and I have been wanting to go back ever since that day when I discovered the most delicious beef short-ribs this side of the world has to offer. If anyone tries to argue with me about this, I will challenge them to an arm wrestling contest.Situated in Monty's famous and overly touristy Old Port, Barroco is a gem among all the other restaurants serving up old school French cuisine in dimly lit, romance infused atmospheres. While I didn't go on a date here, unless you consider a birthday party with five other girls a date (well, actually I would), it is without a doubt a choice place to take your partner(s) in crime. The ambiance is relaxing, the smells are enticing, and the interior design is warm with wooden floors and stone walls. While I only ordered one magnificent dish, I got to taste five others and all were equally appealing, albeit pricey. So, if you fancy venturing into the Old Port, through the gauntlet of ""J'adore Montreal"" T-shirt shops and into Barroco, be prepared to bring your piggy bank filled with your monthly allowance. But, do yourself and your hot date a favour and remember this if nothing else: you get what you pay for."

It was highly recommended by the staff at our hotel. Aesthetically I can see why it was recommended for a romantic dinner, the setting is dark and cavernous looking with romantic lighting and decor. However the food was ehh, very overpriced, and the waitstaff was very pushy with the wine list.We ordered:Seafood Paella- Delicious only thing worth going to this restaurant for. We should have just ordered the paella for two. Braised Short ribs- ehh I've had better, I didn't  like the cilantro flavor.Goat cheese salad- nothing special.Risotto- not worth it, it was very soupy. Chocolate layer dessert-not impressedThis restaurant is supposed to be a fusion of spanish and french cuisine, however the fusion doesn't seem to work in the palate. sorry,"

The decor is very cozy with a nice contrast of old Montreal with a modern flare. We sat at the bar because we thought we would just have a drink or two. We were instantly impressed by the cocktail ""book"" and were given some recommendations by the bar tender (who was fantastic!). He let us try some of the ingredients and was really friendly. Throughout the night we watched some amazing looking dishes come out of the kitchen and decided to order a few things. The burrata cheese and tomato dish of phyllo pastry was incredible. We had oysters and the cheese cake, which may have been one of the best I've ever had. We ended up staying much longer than we planed to (and many more drinks than we planned to!).

After getting lost and going to the wrong 312 St Paul, we finally made it to Barroco. The place is tiny and lovely to boot. I think it is connected to the restaurant next door, which seemed livelier btw (i kind of wish we would have made reservations there instead). i had the salmon (a perfect balance of crispy and juicy with some sauteed green tomatoes) and my husband had the paella (good, but the rice was kind of hard and chewy he noted). We shared the chocolate lava cake for dessert though in retrospect we should have tried the dessert of the day. The cake and sorbet were delicious, but again, not the most amazing we've ever had. The service was great and the folks were attentive. However, for a $100+ dinner, we would have liked to be wowed by something.. anything?"

/user_details?userid=JGjtkOtTs8oFg0AhAeyPVA,Rannie B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Had a romantic dinner on a November Saturday night at Barroco.Had no problem getting a reservation 3 days prior for a 7pm sitting (they also have a later sitting).  They did however let us know at that time that :a) we had to be out of there at 9h30 the latest and b) that they would call us back to confirm on the said Saturday. The restaurant is small (seats about 50) and they want to maximize their revenues given they can pack both sittings on this night.The decor is warm and inviting with stone walls and a fireplace.  The tables however are small and packed close together.  The chairs are simple wood and very uncomfortable after a while. Ask for a booth table if you are 4 or more when reserving.  This all makes for a noisy environment.The service was nice but not very knowledgeable about the menu.  The wait staff all wore jeans.We had oysters and a cheese plate as appetizers that were all delicious.  Tried the duck egg and scallop/morcilla entrees that were equally delicious.The short beef ribs were good and plentiful but unremarkable.  I had the meat market plate that was baby pork ribs on that particular night.  This dish came with 2 tiny ribs on which the edible meat was the size of a quarter, a large scallop, some lentils and piece of leek. This dish was seriously overpriced at 39$. Taste was good but nothing special. Aside from the two market plates the other dishes do not come with any sides.  If you want any, it's extra (8$  to 12$) each.  The wine by the glass list is limited to 3 reds and 3 whites.  I tried all 3 reds before selecting one and they ranged from awful to mediocre. Prices are also high compared to similar or better restaurants.The pace of the service was very good except that we received our main plates at 9h15.  It was somewhat irritating to feel rushed by looking at the folks who came at 9h25 for their table and were waiting less than 3 feet away (it's a small place remember). Hence we didn't have any dessert or coffee.All in all a satisfactory meal in a nice decor.  There are better places for the price in this city."

Dimly lit, with candles everywhere. I especially loved the large, open windows which made it feel like we were dining outside.We ordered the cranberry drinks, which were mixed to perfection. I tried the mediterranean branzini which I can't recommend highly enough. The fish was flavorful and topped with roasted nuts. I was starved so I ordered the risotto on the side. I'm glad I did, because the portion size was on the smaller side.  My date tried the lamb chops along with the mashed potatoes. Holy amazing! The food was so good, we finished each and every last morsel - which is wonderful, but sadly left no room for dessert. I did look through the dessert menu though, and it was to-die-for!

I tried to call a number of times and emailed the restaurant as well for a reservation. No reply either way. However, given the reviews we really wanted to give it a shot. So arrived around 845 to take a chance a a table. The hostess noted a 15 minute wait and we immediately jumped at the chance thinking we had lucked out for my birthday.Ordered a bottle of prosecco and veal tartare to start, both were good. Nothing to write home about though... the waitress was attentive when we arrived then gradually less so..... they had a special that evening of clam, king crab, shrimp and french sausage; pan fried then placed in a saffron lobster sauce. Sounded delicious while quite expensive at $49. But then again it was my birthday dinner so we went for it. my husband ordered the short rib.The bread that kept arriving at other tables never made it to ours, which was disappointing but I did want to save my appetite for the actual goodness to come. so no harm no foul there really...After our veal tartare, we basically sat and waited. our glasses were empty but no one came to refill us.  no one even glanced our way for a entire period between our courses... I kept my optimism as I waited for the ever so rich and scrumptious sounding dinner.When it did come, it was borderline lukewarm.  The broth too salty and nothing tasting as it should. I like my meals hot, and for the price you pay you would expect it as such. The short rib was not as tender as we had hoped either. We actually did need a knife.All in all, poor service, disorganized and mediocre food. I'm sure it would have been much better had it been hot. Sadly they did not allow me to have that experience and provide what may have been a better review"

The menu certainly wasn't as ambitious as at our previous night's dinner spot, les 400 Coups. But good restaurants exist in tourist neighborhoods; and a simple, well-prepared menu is a great virtue, too.Barroco turned out to be not as good as les 400 Coups. But that's not a fair barometer. Barroco was certainly better than I'd feared, and also certainly better than it needed to be.Burrata came with a nice variety of ripe heirloom tomatoes. It wasn't laden down with oils and heavy dressing. A pleasant surprise, especially given that I hadn't intended to order it (sometimes things just come out of my mouth). The cheese was creamy, but not excessive.The branzino (another unexpected order on my part) also turned out to be quite good. A little oily. And it did not require the valiant service of macadamia nuts. But again, very, very passable.I also enjoyed panna cotta, partly because I am a dessert baby. It came with some sort of inscrutable minty green topping. But I cannot say that I was too disturbed by that."

We are food professionals, highly critical and fully appreciate when we find people with passion for what they do. Awesome spot."

/user_details?userid=HjkvGxLQDt2kXJNwVcFRkg,Rick L.,"San Clemente, CA",5 star rating,This Spanish and French restaurant is fantastic. The food is really good and the service impeccable. If you like a cocktail try the Woodford Reserve Old Fashioned. Awesome.  Barocco is in my top 5 favorite restaurants in N. America.
/user_details?userid=xuJMeW6H3BbthCETBkxwGA,Liz M.,"Carlsbad, CA",5 star rating,One of my favorite restaurants in Montreal.  Both the food and ambiance are incredible.  I would definitely recommend visiting as it takes you back to old Montreal.
/user_details?userid=97VXUwKii28Zm5Sjfr0szA,Aly P.,"Fort Lee, NJ",4 star rating,"Great atmosphere, quite dark with candles, good music (may be loud for some), old stone walls and exposed beams, cool bar with about 10 seats on the back wall. Very romantic. Date tip - ask for the booth that's basically carved into the stone. Other than that, regular tables and one other group-sized arched bench with a table on the opposite side of the restaurant. Walked in on a Saturday night at 10 pm and we were able to snag a table. Got completely full within 5 minutes. Montrealers definitely eat later. Place was totally full. Quasi-Spanish menu, paella with morcilla and chorizo and a bunch of seafood. Much more like risotto than paella; would never have thought it was paella if it hadn't said it on the menu. Came in a decorative bowl, none of the desirable soccarat (caramelized, almost burnt bottom from the paella pan), not seasoned at all. Great dessert - apple tart served in ceramic dish with a cute jar of vanilla cream on the side. Great service; free drinks when we waited forever for oysters."

H.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Delightful intimate space with superb service and delicious food to back it up.  Came here desiring a solid bowl of pasta and got that plus a to-die-for risotto starter and a spectacular vegetable terrine.  Drinks were excellent, too (I was treated to a refreshing take on a Pimm's Cup).Although we were without a reservation, we were accommodated with no hassle.  Overall, visit this place!  Go if you like low key, intimate settings where the focus is on the food first."

The perfect meal on a frosty night.  Everything from the dishware and decor to the cocktails and the cuisine itself was delectable. We were pleasantly surprised by the wealth of vegetarian options.  We had a winter green salad, followed by main courses of vegetarian lasagna and arctic char with a side of garlic rapini.  The flavors complemented each other superbly.  We felt at home in the restaurant's intimate ambiance and our server was knowledgeable and very friendly.  We took his suggestion for dessert and were surprised when he brought us a complimentary wine pairing to enjoy with it. Overall, a great success and highly recommended."

Literally, there are 4 walls, and one of them holds the two lavatory doors. Not so great.However, once you've embraced that imperfection, you're in for an amazing meal with fantastic service. Food was absolutely delicious, wine just as good. We sat at the bar, Marc Andres the bartender/server was extraordinary.Barocco and Liverpool House are two musts for anyone in Montreal."

/user_details?userid=NSMq81NWP-mkBud5Xnd0_A,Siu F.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"The ambiance was great and it seemed like it would be a good dining experience, but it was not a good experience. We ordered the steak for two to share. The menu says a 45 minute wait, and we were okay with this. It took 1.5 hours for the steak to come, we ordered medium rare and it was medium. If you love steak like us, medium and medium rare are two very different ways. After coming for dinner at 915pm, we ate at 1130pm. We asked for the rest to be packed up. They actually left out the bone piece that had significant meat on it, but somehow packed up the fat that we cut off our steak. How incredibly rude are you to pick and choose what you pack up for your customers?!?! Especially since we waited over 2 hours to eat our meal. The wait staff was only nice when we flagged them down to remind them that we still haven't eaten; they showed little to no care of our presence, and we had to get their attention to top off our drinks.  The food was nothing special and the service was non-existent.  I would not go back."

/user_details?userid=h8yDKpIS3ao2YESW0e32RQ,Stacy M.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Barroco is truly a world-class restaurant in Old Montreal. The service is warm and beyond accommodating. Roberto makes you feel like family! I ordered the Angus Beef Tartare which literally melts in your mouth and is beautifully seasoned. I had the Market Course entree, which that night was braised short ribs and a celery puree and potatoes---the meat was decliously glazed  tender and fell right off the bone and the puree was addictive. My friend got the Barocco Paella which ranks as one of the best dishes she has ever tasted. They also have an excellent Spanish red wine there and everyone is so knowledgable and helpful. The space is gorgeous, in a perfect location in Old Montreal, it is truly the most beautiful place on the block. If you are in Old Montreal, you will regret not eating at Barroco so make a reservation (only 50 seats) and prepare for an unbelievable experience. Thank you Roberto and staff for one of the best dining experiences this New Yorker has ever had!"
/user_details?userid=8GdQx19zp5xx3Y3SkgFI6w,Peter B.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"This dinner was trip-making for us.  From the moment we walked in, the service was attentive and perfect, including the manager taking our coats and the server being friendly and cool.  The food was really excellent, and the cocktails were amazing - I've never had a gin and tonic with fresh sage, nor has my wife ever had a drink topped with a flaming guava rind - both tasted incredible.  Really endearing vibe inside, with music curated by someone who knows what he's doing, and an atmosphere of young-ish urbanites enjoying a good meal in a stone-lined, candlelit room.  Beamed ceilings, wood floors, stone walls, and a great bar made the ambience, but the food and the service exceeded our expectations.  We loved it and told the Manager so on the way out.  If you visit Montreal without booking your dinner at Barroco in advance, you are doing yourself a disservice.  As the concierge at our hotel told us - in Montreal, there is nothing else like Barroco.  We unfortunately learned this the hard way when we had to settle for another restaurant on our second night after finding out they were booked - would have loved to have gone twice in a row (it was that much fun), but alas, we are looking forward to going back."
