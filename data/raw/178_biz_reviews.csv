/user_details?userid=-WtejdYFqQtasngfqbMdGA,Samantha S.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Recommended to us by our hotel concierge, this spot is a must! Peruvian and Japanese fused together, it's a great spot for tapas and fancy cocktails. We had an amazing experience here, food and service considered. We sat right at the bar and were taken good care of by Julie and Batiste. The server had ordered a bunch of their popular tapas plates for us, so each dish was a surprise that did not disappoint. Food was amazing - ceviche, spicy calamari, and pollo frito were all top notch. It's a pretty cool atmosphere in the restaurant - seemed to have quite a few tables and bar seating... also conveniently located downtown Montreal. It wouldn't be a bad idea to make reservations ahead of time. Will visit again."
/user_details?userid=vTsbejwscDEdA3Ao_aIQMg,Lawrie S.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Having been to Peru recently, I had high expectations for this place and it measured up! Very trendy vibe with high tables which makes it seem like a bar but don't stop at drinks, you need to try their food! Although it was loud, they have seating in the back which was quieter and more intimate.Drinks are very reminiscent of Peru, my favourite was the maracuya sour and they did a very nice pisco sour which was much stronger.Peru is known for having the best ceviche (to which I can attest to) so we were very excited to try the one at Tiradito. We had both the mango ceviche and classic ceviche. The mango was good but felt more like a salad while the ceviche was great and had a lot of flavour. Both were very refreshing dishes. The latter came with the classic ""cancha"" Peruvian popcorn, which really brings the dish to another level.We also shared the spicy calamari and the tostadas that I would definitely recommend. The quality of their ingredients is apparent. We ended with the duck anticuchos which did not disappoint either. This is a classic street food in Peru that is typically made of cow hearts but I'm not sure how Montrealers would feel about that. Not certain, but I don't think these were made of duck hearts! Either way, give it a try because they taste like fillet mignon.Cannot comment on any of the Japanese items on the menu but all in all we left with our bellies full and satisfied!"
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I'm a little concerned that our visit to this Tiradito wasn't entirely reflective of the norm, given all the good things I had heard previously. Ultimately it was a lot of highs and lows for my brother and I on this place.The best part of our visit here (aside from the sporks!) was the cocktails. I think the marriage of Japanese and Cuban flavours was best embodied in our visit through the drinks. My little mezcal number was down-right delicious. That being said, it took an eternity for our drinks to arrive; to the extent that our food was already on the table by the time they came around.Speaking more to the service, I found it was notably pretentious (and arguably rude at a couple points) which definitely diminished the experience for me. It's kind of surreal to have a server scoff at you when you ask for two bills, you know?Otherwise, I thought the space was lovely and the food did the trick. All that being said, I definitely wasn't blown away by the plates we ordered (yuka fries, boudin empanadas, dumplings and mango ceviche) and thought that most things lacked finesse in flavouring. Ultimately I'm convinced I hit an off night- I don't believe that a place of this stature could be so variable in experience. I may or may not try again!"

Had the duck chops and muscle-ceviche. I don't have pictures of them because I ate so fast. The waiter was super nice and attentive. The portions are small so you get to really enjoy a bunch of different dishes. Really cool vibe too. Warning, not so much a warning as it is an FYI.. They don't serve traditional Peruvian food. Lomo saltado etc. Nevertheless, this food is amazing! Highly recommend! For solo travelers too"

The music is foot tapping. Luckily, there was a spot for two people without reservation. The service is friendly and super quick. Since, I am a pescatarian, I am grateful to my friend for ordering seafood based tapas. We both had a glass of rosé, which was smooth, and mildly strong, so overall it was perfect. For tapas, we had Lobster Causa, Pulpo Al Olivo and Crab Bao fun. Each tapas was almost made to its perfection. The octopus was slightly over cooked but to the core it was delicious. Each tapas was flavorful and extremely succulent. Each of their presentation was beautiful, colorful and lively! I must say, their favorite spice must be cumin because it overcomes strongly compared to any other spices. Personally, I enjoyed the seasoning! Definitely 100% recommended!"

/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Peruvian cuisine is one that I don't know much about so I welcomed the opportunity to try Tiradito and learn more about it.  The restaurant specializes in Peruvian Japanese fusion which might sound like an odd combination, but Peru has a large Japanese population so it makes sense.  It is set in a trendy setting and given the layout of the restaurant it is best to come here if you are a small group (4 people at the most).What is great about Tiradito is that the menu is tapas-style which allows you to sample many offerings from the menu.  The prices vary but they can be as low as $8 or as high as $16.  If you're multiple people this will work out nicely in terms of pricing.  We ordered the dishes that were more on the traditional side of Peruvian food.  My personal favourite was the papa rellena which featured beef in a chili sauce which was wrapped in a dough and fried.  The ceviche was also really well done and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Alas, the only one that really disappointed me was an octopus dish.  Despite the octopus being cooked to perfection  I wasn't a fan of the olive sauce on it but I also don't like olives much to begin with.    Dessert was a shortbread with dulce de leche inside and an ice cream on the side.  The shortbred was so delicate and flaky.While they do have beer and wine I was in the mood for a cocktail.  They make their own creations here which are about $12 each which is a little on the expensive side.  I ordered a Maracuyo sour which is similar to a pisco sour except it has passion fruit juice added to it.  It was okay but for $12 it should have been a little stronger.This is a really fun place to come after work for some drinks and tapas.  It served as my introduction to Peruvian cuisine and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Downtown Montreal is better off for having this place."
/user_details?userid=gxYdU7-z-g804OfjMlStBw,Mark S.,"Miami, FL",2 star rating,"What a joke the service is here. From other reviews, it looks like a consistent theme at Tiradito. My bartender / server didn't even notice me for 15 minutes after I was seated at the bar. She finally noticed after I had to wave in her face like an idiot. At that point, I already knew what I wanted to order, since I had all the time in the world to stare at the menu. I put in my order. Which I had to repeat because she couldn't remember 6 items, apparently. Twice I told her my order, yet was never given a table setting (napkin, silverware) at my seat. Ummmm, forget something?? Oh, and no water either. Which I asked for explicitly. I guess item #7 is beyond her memory bank. I see the bartender make my cocktail, and put it in front of her. Another 5 minutes passes before she realizes it's there and gives it to me. Still no water. I had to flag her down for some. About 25 minutes after putting in my order, my scallop ceviche finally arrives. It's a ceviche, there's no cooking. What the heck took so long?? In Miami, they're out in 5, 10 minutes tops. And Miami is known for horrible service! Lol... At this point, I finally get a fork. Never got a knife or spoon, even though I could see the silverware jars 10 ft away. She also gives me a cupful of cocktail paper napkins. WTF. This isn't some street food joint in Lima. Give me a proper cloth napkin like I see everyone else around me has. The fish ceviche is next. It arrives to a confused food runner, who's been more focused on flirting with the girls seated next to me than doing his job the whole night. He walks the ceviche to every other group around the bar, except me for some reason. Finally after handling and breathing on it for 5 minutes, and looking utterly confused, my server directs him to me. I had half a mind to send it back because he touched it so damn much. Seriously, what's wrong with you?The server, in general, was incompetent. She was spilling sauces, dropping dishes and not seeing food orders at her station the whole night. If you're going with a bar setting and showcase like Tiradito, at least make sure you have competent staff prepping in front of customers. Otherwise, hide the disorder in the kitchen. Just a messy operation. At the end of my meal, I get my bill and tip out. She looks at the tip, and asks me: ""Excuse me. Do you understand how tipping works?"" Ahahahahahahaha!! Unbelievable!! Hilarious. Yes, I do. And apparently you don't. In hindsight, I wished I had tipped out a penny. What a bogus attitude. If you want a tip, learn some service. One star for the food. Which was actually decent."
/user_details?userid=arg4r9U3ckEIfhX3-W8pvw,James L.,"Ridgefield, CT",5 star rating,"Wonderful food and atmosphere in a convenient downtown Montreal location. The ceviche is outstanding and unusual as it is served with little pieces of popped corn adding crunch and texture to the cool, soft and perfectly seasoned/sauced fish. The scallop ceviche is similarly excellent. This is technically a cocktail bar with food - not a restaurant with cocktails - so no kids allowed. Seating is all comfortable bar seating around multiple bars with excellent views of the kitchen and the behind the bar food prep stations. Warm atmosphere, excellent service, delicious food and cocktails.  A winner."
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I had a pumpkin soup and tuna poke. My friend had the ceviche and she was happy. I have to say that this is one of the best poke salads I have had in Montreal.  The presentation and ingredients were excellent. The concept is pretty cool, where the waiter is also the chef and will prepare your meal in front of you. Not your typical Peruvian restaurant and it is pricier than the usual hole in the wall. Located downtown near the old port. Pass by for lunch or dinner and make sure to reserve so you can get a good seat by the bar instead of sitting in front of the side wall facing a mirror.Enjoy!"

We went in without a reservation and were quickly accommodated, although the place filled up quickly after (it was a weekday dinner night!)Tiradito has a trendy atmosphere and cool vibe. The staff were super friendly and helpful, and gave good recommendations when we asked. Service took a while but the place was busy so it was understandable. Amazing drinks -- my boyfriend had the Maracuya Sour and I had the Inka Colada, and both were delicious! We also really enjoyed what we ordered: Yuca Fries, Papa Rellena, and Ceviche. It was just enough for two people to walk out full and happy (side note: I was really craving ceviche that night and was very satisfied). Total came to about 75$ including tax and tip. All worth it! We will be back!"

Enjoyed about half of the menu but can confidently say you can't go wrong with anything listed on it. The attention to detail on each plate is noticed in each bite and the same for the palette cleansing-cocktails. Hard to pick a favorite dish of the night but the BBQ duck bao and white fish ceviche were next level.

Our bartender gave us food recommendations, all were great. All the plates served are meant to be shared tapas-style. We had fried chicken which was crispy, moist, and flavorful. We also a few other plates; octopus (savory!), ceviche (spicy! fresh!), cauliflower in a curried broth which was my favorite and I don't even really like cauliflower. I wish I could remember our bartender's name...he was genuine, fun, on top of service. The place was packed when we left so I suggest reserving a spot in advance (if possible) or dining early as we did. This is my favorite dining/drinking experience in Montreal so far."

My boyfriend and I were recommended this restaurant from a friend and decided to try to out. The vibe was great, all bar seating, loud music, fun decor. We ordered cocktails that were delicious! We ordered the tapas in waves and were disappointed to report we only truly enjoyed 4/10 dishes we ordered. Would suggest the crispy shrimp, tuna tartare, ceviche, and dumplings. Unfortunately the waiter did mess up our original drink order and forgot about two of our tapas, other than that he was great! They also gave us a few free shots which was fun!"
/user_details?userid=YEh-eqDDP-5kP-jyG4XSrw,Cristina R.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"We were blown away by this Peruvian-Asian fusion small plates restaurant on an unassuming street in Downtown Montreal.Arriving around 8:30pm on a Saturday night, we were informed that all spots around the central bar were reserved, but they had 2 seats along the side wall. Perfecto!The space is dimly lit with candles on the bar, and everything is tinged red by the rouge, luminous bird adorning the side wall. There are also plants and candles on the walls which balance the industrial vibe of the space.All of the drinks on the cocktail menu sound so good. We went with the Chilcano which was tangy and fresh with pisco, ginger, lime, and passion fruit & the Maracuya Sour, a heavier, fruitier drink with passion fruit, tequila, and egg white. Both spectacular, we drank them much faster than we should have. Off to a great start!For our dishes, we ordered the avocado causa, pato dumplings, and ceviche mixto. The dumplings arrived first, so we unwrapped our napkins and discovered that instead of forks or chopsticks, we were given SPORKS! Definitely unexpected and took a little getting used to (I have to admit I dropped more pieces of food than usual), but they made us slow our eating down and more thoroughly enjoy every bite.The delectable duck dumplings in a sweet chili sauce were devoured, and then came the avocado causa, a creamy veggie dish with a deliciously creamy sauce, and the ceviche with tuna & avocado, which also came in a divine liquid. Now we understand the sporks! You can pierce the bite of food with the prongs and then fill the spoon portion with the sauce to get the perfect mouthful. Tiradito understands exactly how to bring the most flavor to your meal, and we truly appreciated every bite-- something that doesn't happen enough!Tiradito caused us to slow down, enjoy each tasty detail, and feel really hip doing it. It's def a must in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=bBzOlCXZKcwhmdITySeAhw,Valerie R.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"What an amazing place for a night out with friends. Totally not recommended for families!The place has a very creative menu with tapas-style plates of Peruvian food with an asian fusion twist. Not a large selection, but enough that if there are several of you and you decide to try a few plates and share, you will have plenty of great discoveries. I went with a friend and we indeed shared many things. We picked everything that had no gluten in it which means we had many of the fish and veggie dishes. I believe the meat dishes that night all had gluten so I did not try them. I loved the ceviches, loved that there was nice colors on the plate, many textures, and overall things I had not eaten before in this type of combination. You sit around a long bar that curves around the room so you see them cook and prepare your drinks. Cocktails were amazing too and I tried one with a combination of liquors and juice I had never tried before. Everyone was so friendly, the place was packed and you had to have a reservation, even though I went in the midst of winter and there was a snow wtorm starting outside.I am planning to go back as the memories are just too perfect!"

I was not disappointed. The restaurant itself has a welcoming vibe, more like a bar. The bar seating also makes it a great option for solo diners, even though there are plenty of couples and groups around too. They seem to take their drink menu seriously, but I did not partake, so I can't comment on that. I was there for the food. After consulting with one of the helpful cook/waiters, I settled on three dishes: the eponymous tuna tiradito, the braised, then crisped chicharron, and the lobster causa. All were excellent, each a study in contrasts: the meaty tenderness of the tuna balanced with citric acidity and the crunch of roasted corn kernels; the melting tenderness of the pork shank paired with the fatty crispness of the skin; the richness of the lobster with the creaminess of the potato cups and the briny notes imparted by the tobiko. I definitely look forward to a return visit here next time I'm thinking of heading close to Old Montreal."
/user_details?userid=GnJ2w63izmrICmt1wNCGOA,Laurence V.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,"I had never experienced nikkei cuisine (Japanese-Peruvian fusion) before and I was not disappointed! There is only a long bar in the middle or on the side, so ideal for 2-3 people. The music isn't too loud so you can still talk, although there's a club vibe due to them playing mostly hip-hop and Latin music. It was nice sitting at the centre bar because you could see them prepare the food and their bar was quite spacious. Also, they use sporks which I've never used before! It takes time to get used to it but it's nice not having too many utensils in the way. The lighting is not the best due to the iconic bird red neon sign, so we couldn't really see how our food looked like. You definitely need to be open minded with trying new food because you will probably not know many ingredient they use. I love discovering new food so this place was perfect for me as they serve tapas, made to share! The only thing is that their menu didn't write down everything that was on the plate, so I couldn't even tell you exactly what I ate, nor could I take pictures to show because of the lighting. My favourite were the lobster and the octopus, they are a must try! The ceviche (catch of the day was similar to red snapper) was good but the fish was cut in thin but big slices and even without good lighting I could tell there was some colour missing in the dish. The yucca fries was different than typical fries which I liked, but they weren't anything special. What I love about this place is that the tapas are actually made to be shared and the waiter even asked if we wanted 3 portions rather than the typical 2 (since we were 3 people) which was very attentive of him. Their service was well paced as they made sure we finished one tapas before bringing the next one, and the waiter always made sure our water bottle was full. Overall, I was extremely satisfied with my experience!"

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A few years ago, when I first started to pay attention to the restaurant scene here in Montreal, fusion was the big 'hip' trend. The idea of merging multiple types of cuisine into something familiar and yet different. Over the past few years however, we have seen more and more a trend back towards restaurants with a clear essence - French, Italian, 'Canadian' but with a focus on fresh local ingredients to sustain that approach. In the end though, every cuisine is a fusion of many - that is the nature of how food evolves between countries and through new cultures immigrating into existing ones. That is what creates more particular fusions - blends of styles that one does not necessarily see as co-existing but do. Tiradito is an example of this.Located on Bleury St below Rene Levesque, Tiradito is a blend of Peruvian and Japanese cuisine known as Nikkei. Turns out there is a huge Japanese population in Peru which has lead to this blend of cuisine. Chef Marcel Larrea first opened up this restaurant a few years ago to much acclaim - as much for its interesting cuisine as for its unique approach in terms of service. All seating is around a center bar and the service is done by the kitchen staff itself whose individual stations are located in view behind the bar. The service is slightly less personable as a result at times since when your 'waiter' 's station is busy, they don't have time to really follow-up with you but otherwise, it is a cool approach as you see the kitchen prepping your food as you dine which I have always enjoyed to see.Since this is a Peruvian restaurant, Pisco is a strong component to the cocktail menu. if you love a Pisco sour, you will be well served here. Outside of that, there have some fun options. I opted for the El Vato - White rum, chartreuse, pineapple, sesame, scotch and kaffir lime. Nice presentation and balance - the hint of sesame smokiness is a nice touch on top of the sweetness.The menu is a mix of sharing-sized plates - vegetarian, meat and fish. We grabbed a few different options to try different parts of the menu. First up, the scallop à la chalaca served with red onions, red chilies, hondashi and ginger. Very bright and vibrant - acidity and sweetness to pair with the nice scallops.Next up, we ordered the spicy calamari served with salsa criolla. The calamari were nice and plump. The batter was crisp and not too thick either so the natural flavour of the calamari came through. The spicy mayo and the onion salsa were nice compliments to add. Honestly one of the better fried calamari dishes I have had in a while.The Papa Rellena - a ball of potato and beef deep fried and served with a sweet chili sauce - was a completely new discovery for me and one I enjoyed a lot. Nice crunch on the outside, good flavour in the filling and the sauce provided a nice bit of both heat and sweet to the dish. The yucca fries were a hit as well - good crunch and tender interior. Very flavourful and a good compliment to the rest of the meal.Lastly, I love duck so I had to try the duck anticucho - duck marinated in aji panka, cumin and roasted paprika and roasted on skewers. Sadly this was the dish that impressed the least. The duck itself was cooked nicely - very tender but compared to the rest of the dishes, this one lacked punch.Tiradito was an experience we really enjoyed. The food was great - very flavourful and fresh - with a nice decor, fun vibe and good music all around. I can definitely see why the reviews have been so positive since its opening. I may not have known about Nikkei Cuisine prior to this experience but I definitely know I am a fan now.Cheers!"

Our server recommended 2 - 3 dishes per person. We thought we were both pretty hungry, so we were ambitious and went for three dishes each. I didn't try the butifarra sandwich, but almost everything I tried was excellent. My favourites were the octopus anticucho and spicy calamari. The spicy cauliflower was the only dish that really fell flat. It wasn't spicy at all and the combination of the fried cauliflower and coconut milk was too much.The atmosphere was lively and everyone was there to have a good time. Service was friendly and quick. I would definitely return."
/user_details?userid=Ng8f6t-OvZLOMZgVT8X6Nw,John A.,"Philadelphia, PA",1 star rating,Place is trash. Food is pretty good but the service absolutely ruins any positive experience you might have. My wife and I sat down and it took our server/bartender 15 minutes to take our drink order. Another 15 minutes to get our drinks. The bar back/server comes back to ask if we're ready to order and we ask how many plates we should order. He says 3 per and so we proceed to try to order 5 dishes and he interrupts us and says that it'll be too much food and we should order 4 plates and order more after we get them. Uh okay. It takes over an hour and a half to get those 4 plates. They're tiny and we're splitting everything so obviously we're starving. The server/janitor never checked back in to see if we needed another drink. They bring us the wrong dish. Somehow they got confused with our 4 dish order at a tapas restaurant lol. I had to turn our empty water bottle on the side in order to get another bartenders attention to get more water. We want more food but don't want to wait another hour so we beg another server for our check and get out of there so we can grab a bite somewhere else. Avoid.
/user_details?userid=cBvQir2uzA59ZjZYcSngHQ,Kat R.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Last weekend we had our last dinner in Montreal before turning home and boy did we choose the right place!!! Such an experience. Peru and Japan come together to make an incredible delicious fusion of tapas. We started out with drinks (of course). I tried the pisco sour as did most of the rest of my party and so good! Tastes just like the ones in Peru. Then we tried the maracuya (passion fruit) sour (if you like sweet things, def. go with this one). So so yummy. Could've had a whole pitcher of them.There were five of us and we each got two tapas and split the cost. All of them are good but I'd recommend a million percent the ceviche. So fresh and tasty. I'm not a fan of spicy food at all and the menu has a warning of which items are, but we got some of those and I was totally fine. The service was great too! Such friendly staff who knew the menu well and added to the experience. They even gave us free shots of pisco. Would definitely go again!They play Latin music in the background just to add to the ambiance and makes you wanna dance in your seat. Last and important thing: completely and reasonably priced for what you get!"
/user_details?userid=UAVOUDlhb2lRSO2d7qPANg,Rob F.,"Coquitlam, Canada",4 star rating,"Pros: The food was all very good, especially the duck bun.  We also had the crispy shrimp, cauliflower, dumplings, and lobster.  Very unique flavor combinations and all delicious.  The place was quite busy and had a buzzing atmosphere.Cons: We went during the recent heat wave and the restaurant didn't have any noticeable air conditioning, and so at the back area where we sat it got quite stifling.  Our server was nice, but the service in general was slow and a bit disorganized - we were served and finished two dishes before our drinks arrived.  When new dishes arrived the empties weren't always taken away, so the narrow bar where we sat got a bit cluttered as we tried to enjoy our meal.  We observed several other parties come in, sit down, wait a while, and then leave after not getting served.  Maybe short staffed that evening?Overall, would still recommend trying it out for the food but be prepared for possible inconsistent service."

For a dinner, you'd be probably satisfied with 4 dishes at least, have that in mind, the dishes are supposed to be small so you can try a bit of everything. I had the butifarra (holy molly, it's inspired on the Peruvian butifarra sandwich, but the twist is that they fill it with cantonese pulled duck and it's wrapped in a steamed bun) which was one of my favourite dishes, along with the octopus anticucho (came with a bit of causa). Then, I tasted the Peruvian Potatoes which were okay, nothing incredible. The causa was outstanding, made with lobster and topped with caviar.  I was disappointed with the ceviche, it was too salty and not enough lemony sour taste, it just didn't taste like ceviche. I went with my family and we are all Peruvian, so like the ceviche unfortunately didn't pass the test. What blew our minds was the Passionfruit Lemongrass Chilcano, which came with a soursop cream deliciousness stuffed inside a lemon!! It pairs up really well with pisco and I need to drink it again. Not all the servers speak Spanish and only a couple are Peruvian, but they were all cordial and helpful. The lighting is dimmed and red, so pictures of your food won't necessarily turn out great. I would definitely make a reservation because it gets busy (be mindful that most seats are at the bar) ! They also offer a birthday cake service, if you are planning to go there for the special occasion, plus you get free shots."

/user_details?userid=3de-BnlFFmszy8qWCfjnNQ,Anthony P.,"New York, NY",1 star rating,"This place has no remorse for customer satisfaction. They live by their own set of standards on how to properly handle patrons arriving without a reservation. Maybe you'll wait 40 minutes for no text. Or maybe you'll get passed by people who don't have a reservation when you put your name down an hour earlier. Or maybe four different people will tell you ""just another minute"" while the fifth one ignores you. Point is don't waste your time. Don't fall for the presentation and chic interior. More worthwhile to find a restaurant that treats their customers better."

Highly recommend if you are looking for a fun time with good food and drinks."
/user_details?userid=nEfgsjRDRmxx7nNFVZi0jw,Darryl R.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Our favorite restaurant while in Montreal. It is listed as Peruvian-Japanese fusion, but more Peruvian with some Asian influences. The small plates were fantastic, with the seafood extremely fresh. The ceviche was the best dish, with a huge amount of fish, excellently flavored. We also enjoyed the Pulpo al Olivo (octopus in an black olive emulson), spicy cauliflower stew, avocado tiradito, and scallop a la Chalaca. All were excellent. It also was an excellent value. Highly recommended."
/user_details?userid=Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I had originally planned to have dinner elsewhere, but when my beau saw that Tiradito was open he nearly pulled me over. We were quite hungry so I'm sure they thought we've never eaten before....I think we ended up ordering 7 different items. I started with a smokey mezcal cocktail called Ninmei en Peru...nicely strong, it nearly blew my sandals off! If you have a look at the photos it outlines our meal from start to finish....starting with the scallops and ending with the duck bun The scallop dish was basically a ceviche, and then our second dish was a fish ceviche, but it had a leche de tigre type sauce so it was different enough from the first. Both were light, slightly acidic and made us want more. Then we had the fried calamari ""nuggets"" and the blood sausage empanadas. The empanadas were the favorite dish of the night for my guy, he ordered another round for himself later. They were, as he put it, ""What empanadas should be!"" The calamari was good, not oily and crispy. We then had an octopus dish with an olive sauce, which is totally different from anything I've ever had and my favorite item of the night. We then had a round of steamed dumplings in a sweet and sour sauce, and a duck bao bun - which is an interesting choice for a Peruvian restaurant but they were really succulent and juicy. They seem to be working hard to make delicious food and drinks, go give them a visit."

/user_details?userid=U-gROMgB0uWXvM9YQASRvA,Juan S.,"Pasadena, CA",4 star rating,"I want to give this place 5 (I bumped it up from 3 stars because they comped a plate for me). Peruvian Japanese it's just my style. The concept is amazing and I really like the food. However there are several things that hold it back. The first did the fact they have a fruit fly situation. They need to put up some traps or something, I ended up getting a couple in my menu. The second is the service. Unfortunately I ordered 3 items and waited an hour and at some point they forgot about me. They gave my food to another table and never came to clean up my table.Finally the portions are very small. It's designed to share but each one is barely enough for one person. I ate three items by myself and left to go eat somewhere else afterwards.Oddly enough I do recommend this place to anyone who wants to try it. I just hope that the owners make a few small tweaks to improve it to its full potential."

I went on a Saturday night and it was not packed but it could have been due to the weather conditions not being great. My cousin and I ordered the Sake Punch for two people which was very average and diluted.We shared four dishes...the Albacore Tuna Tiradito, the octopus ceviche, the spicy cauliflower and spicy fried calamari. The tuna felt like it was just taken out of the freezer, the sauce was creamy and good but I didn't like the pairing of the sweet potato in that dish but that's just a personal preference. I usually love octopus everything...fried, grilled, in ceviches...but the octopus in that dish was overcooked and chewy elastic like and the sauce was way too acidic, we didn't finish it. The cauliflower and fried calamari were good but nothing out of the ordinary. We were full after but left quite unsatisfied. Hopefully it was just an "" off "" night for them."

I was immediately appealed by the Peruvian-Japanese concept and cuisine. Went there on a Friday night with a friend of mine and of course made sure to reserve before we got there. As soon as we arrived we were immediately assigned two seats at the bar, the place looks really nice and trendy, with a big bar at the center and nice decoration. Music is not loud so you can easily have a conversation. The food menu is composed of seafood, vegetables and meat tapas to share. The food was very good and original, mixing salmon with mashed potatoes Peruvian style, as well as duck dumplings, tuna sushi, avocado with potatoes.. the staff and the barmaid were friendly. Very good experience overall, we paid 55$ each for 6 plates, one desert (really tasty) and a beer. Small drawback: portions can be a little more generous."
/user_details?userid=1uNl-JIznJT3AW7tnGA13A,Talya K.,"Woodcliff Lake, NJ",5 star rating,This was one of the best restaurants I have been to in my life. The atmosphere of this place is amazing - my family of 4 sat at the corner of the bar and it worked perfectly! We shared a yummy pitcher of rose sangria and then each got our own drinks. Each dish after the next was incredible. We shared 9 plates and my favorite was the salmon ceviche tostada. The service was great and we got to see all the amazing drinks being created. Every drink after the next looked beautiful- it was truly art. I recommend this place to anyone who loves a combination of Asian and Latino cuisine! Our server offered many recommendations to compliment our experience and even gave us a free shot for my brothers birthday! Perfect for a special occasion! Above all I love this type of restaurant experience because you share a bunch of small plates and don't feel horrible after eating it all.

The service is friendly and the menu is original for the Montreal food scene. Very tasty to top things off. Everything we tried we quite enjoyed. Especially the boudin empanadas and the crab/avocado tostada! Rich in flavour, perfect pairing sauces. The excellent? Drinks were to die for! Some serious mixology talent as they incorporate some Asian flair to Peruvian liquor. The bloody tiger, with its hints of sesame and some other umami flavour took the old Cesar to a whole other level! The not so good? Portion were small and steeply priced considering their size. Although we would have loved to spend the night sampling the menu, the small portions cut our evening short as we were still hungry after forking out 30$ each for a drink and some dishes to share. We had to resort to good old Chinatown right next door to fill us up after we left."

We came here for a date and were amazed by the restaurant - its character, its charm, its energy, its food, and its service. Picture this: you're seated at a bar top (there're no tables). At the other side are three food preparation ""stations"" and a drink station, where the chefs serve up the tapas dishes. Despite the hustle and bustle, the chefs move with ease and unhurried grace. They do not just prepare the food. They chat with you, introduce the Peruvian- Japanese (Nikkei) dishes, serve up your tapas, clear your utensils when you're done... oh, and even present you your bill. Is there nothing they do not do? I would call them hosts, not just chefs. The food is amazing. We had the cerviche, the duck in a bun, the beef / potato, and the pork. Very delicious, very fresh and beautifully presented. For cocktail, we had the pisco sour. Pisco is the Peruvian liquor and not surprisingly it is used in many of the cocktails."

So did the table next to us.A few examples:We waited about 20 minutes for our waitress to even come over. She was busy with a big table who was obviously going to give her a big tip. That's fine but just don't completely ignore us. We ordered our food and drinks.40 minutes later we had received 2 items of food and no drink yet. We finally got her attention again and said should we check in at the bar for the drinks, she said yes that would be better for her. Meanwhile she's taking shots with the other table and they have all had 3 drinks a piece in the time we had none.We are fed up about another 30 minutes later when we ask for our check and instead of helping get us out of there and giving us our check our waitress goes and samples wine for the big group to bring them more drinks. Also multiple places still had used dishes etc out there because they had no one to clean them up. It felt like about 5 people called in sick.So here's my frustration, our table, the table behind us of 4 people, and the people in front of us another 2 people were all upset. When does someone recognize this from management and do something? I.e. Since this girl can't wait on all the tables then put someone else in charge of them? Or something. It was incredibly disappointing. Food was good but completely overshadowed but the ridiculous service."

Her excellent mixology skills were impressive, and she helped us decide on menu choices. We got six different tapas plates, which was perfect, about two per person. Everything was excellent, our favorite was the pollo frito. It was like chicken and waffles without the waffles (which made waffles seem pointless), and a glaze that was the best maple flavor ever, complimented by a red onion chili pepper salsa.

In fact my colleagues are going and at first I said I was going to go but now i declined the invitation. The vibe is nice. I think it would be a good place to bring a date or just two girls out for a drink sharing some small plates. Basically everyone sits around the bar but they do have space in the back for larger groups. My cousin and I went on a Thursday night and sat at the bar. I ordered the Bloody Tigre cocktail which is like a bloody Caesar and contains vodka, miso, coriander, hot pepper, marinated vegetables and a sechuan spice rim. I did not enjoy it! i forced myself to drink the whole thing. Reading the ingredients I thought I would like it  because I had the miso bloody caesar at Jellyfish and it was amazing! This one was bitter and sweet at the same time and too many marinated vegetables inside. We ordered five dishes to share based on the recommendations of the staff. We had the smoked salmon causa (smoked salmon, maple syrup, potatoe and amarillo pepper). It was good but it tasted like any smoked salmon to me. I didn't taste the maple syrup at all but for me I prefer it that way because I'm not a big fan of salty and sweet. My favorite dish was the octopus anticucho. The octopus was deep fried and it had a creamy sauce but also Hoisin sauce as well. The Hoisin sauce is overpowering and being half chinese I'm used to eating Hosin so maybe that is why I liked this dish the best. We also had the Albacor Tuna Tiradito since that is what it is known for. Hmm it was ok... not memorable. The ceviche of the day was red snapper. OOF This was my least favorite dish. I took one bite and i couldn't eat the rest! what a waste!It was too fishy for me. For the record I like fish that doesn't taste like fish. Even my cousin couldn't eat her half either and she said it got fishier as she ate it. The papa rellena (potato, beef, sweet chili sauce) was fine. The beef was wrapped in big deep fried ball with a creamy sauce underneath. This restaurant seems to have a lot of deep fried stuff which I usually love! Like I said I really wanted to like this restaurant and I was excited to try it but I left feeling not satisfied. :("

Careful though, two people can spend $120 easy here and not think twice about it. Their desert tastes ok, but I would say that's an area of the menu that could use improvement. Definitely stop by and give this place a shot. Make a reservation or hope you can get lucky, like we did!"

We started with the cauliflower in coconut curry, which was light & flavourful. We also sampled the calamari, tostadas, lobster causa, fish of the day ceviche, kimchi, potatoes, duck sandwich, and blood pudding empanadas. So LOTS of food, but small portions so we just had the perfect tasting. My favourites were the lobster & tostadas. The empanadas were also amazing. Surprisingly my least favourite was the ceviche.

/user_details?userid=pivvnsMn2j5WLLk57RkBIA,Liz C.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"Service here is terrible. They have about a million servers and they look like they are doing stuff, but all i know is that i had a 815 reservation, took ~40 min to get my drink and one dish. Finished everything at 915 and still sitting here at 955 waiting for my server to come around to get my bill, i don't think I've seen her in the last 30 min. Food is ok. Nothing special,  not sure if this is the best representation of Nikkei food. Only come here if you have tons of time to kill. Google says people spend 1.5-3 hrs here, i can believe the latter, im sure its because it takes forever"
/user_details?userid=t6dY8gm6ajW_ixhlgwseSA,Steve M.,"Lilburn, GA",4 star rating,"Food was very individual & creative. Interesting atmosphere. Chefs prepared the food right in front of you at the Bar, so you can watch them. 1st. Order we had was just average at best, with hamburger beef type meat wrapped inside a bread ball dough browned. They forgot my order that I ordered at the same time. And a half hour later I asked what happened. They brought it then. Scallop Cevieche. Was good. But all small portions. So you have to order several to get filled. My girlfriend got mad, they were very slow arriving with our food and service. She left early."

My mother and I were presently surprised at how good the food was, and although our service was a bit spotty, they made up for it by making my rosé complementary. Overall a high caliber experience if you're looking for something a cut above your standard dinner in terms of quality and environment during your time in Montreal."

/user_details?userid=FVErH8rPFGcKloga-RwLzA,FM M.,"Burlington, VT",3 star rating,"We were excited to try Tiradito after reading many reviews. The place is beautiful - well appointed and thoughtfully designed. We found the service to be inconsistent - the hostess was chilly and the server was inexperienced and unable to describe menu items (there are not many to learn) or the wine list. Most importantly, the food fell flat.  Flavors were uninspired and didn't live up to our expectations. The pork shank was dry and over fried, the octopus leathery and the dumplings seemed to offer nothing more than you can get from a frozen grocery store brand. A bright spot - the cocktails.  They were beautiful and delicious. I wouldn't spring for dinner here again, but would have a cocktail."

/user_details?userid=MINczoOrv6u11yBUmhgihQ,Michelle S.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Loved the decor and ambiance. Seating is right up along the bar, where you're entertained by your chef/waiter assembling tapas. The cocktails are fantastic - we tried the pisco sour and guapita (cava & gin) - both highly recommended! For food, our favourites were the crispy potatoes and the octopus. Both were accompanied by sauces that were to die for. As people have mentioned earlier, the plates are a little pricier than what's warranted by the portion sizes, but if you're willing to splurge while sipping on great cocktails, this is your place!"

It has an amazing vibe, (all bar seating, amazing music, cool decor), spectacular service (Santiago was so attentive and passionate) and the food was to die for! I went with my boyfriend for his birthday and we were blown away! We ate the octopus, the ceviche made with halibut, the BBQ duck buns, the dumplings, the Peruvian potatoes, and the tostada made with fresh crab. everything was ON POINT! Let's not forget the amazing cocktails. I had the passion fruit sour and he had the pismo sour. Both were delicious. I would recommend this place 100%! Perfect date spot or for a night out with good friends. Enjoy!"
/user_details?userid=lML7p30Hthtll1Ur_PRM1A,Michael M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1 star rating,"This place sucks. Don't eat here unless you like MSG. You can taste the MSG and have the effect of frothy saliva in every bite. Cheap restaurants use MSG to compensate for lower quality ingredients. Every time I tried to order something it was unavailable. In other words, whoever is supposed to prep the food didn't do their job so I ordered the Squid and Papa Relleno. The Papa Relleno was tasty but not served hot. It was lukewarm. The Squid was worse. It reminded me of eating Show leather. I sent it back immediately and drank my crappy craft beer. Don't stop here, keep walking. Actually run away. This place is terrible."
/user_details?userid=gyzwVbfmJ9Az_USw13OjNQ,Sara G.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"We had a very bad experience there. Will not return. Food was overrated and overpriced. It's not a Peruvian-Japanese fusion, it's a Peruvian-CHINESE fusion! The food was served in a dim-sum fashion (small portion). Nothing innovative. We were constantly interrupted by the waiters to order food and alcohol despite we were still working on what was served. We were asked to move even though the restaurant was half empty."

/user_details?userid=bCC9m7vuNKISQ-ckJ98fJQ,She H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We met a Peruvian couple at a dinner party a few weeks ago and asked them about their favorite Peruvian restaurant in Montreal. They highly recommended the recently opened Tiradito, and specifically recommended their ""fish"" dishes. They love Nikkei cuisine and Tiradito fit the bill perfectly. This restaurant/bar is extremely popular so reservations are highly recommended. They have a 6 o'clock seating and an 8 o'clock seating. After ordering our cocktails, our group of four ordered a mixture of dishes. Their fried foods were my favorite; I loved the octopus anticucho and peruvian potatoes. They both had the perfect amount of crispiness on the outside and a soft interior. The spicy cauliflower dish has a thai curry flavor to it. The avocado causa did not stand out particularly in my mind.   Our two ceviches ( mixed ceviche and fish ceviche) were good, but I am no expert on ceviche. We didn't order the albacore tuna tiradito but I really wished we had tried it. By the end, we were still a little hungry and so we each had a butifarra sandwich. This is very similar to Momofuku`s pork belly buns, it tasted like a steamed bun à la Peking Duck. We finished off the dinner by splitting a dessert (the waiter was so kind he even split it into four plates for us!!)  It was the perfect way to end our dinner.  I loved that we ate with sporks, but when we requested an extra spoon to use for sharing the dishes (especially the soupier ones), they told us to just use our spork.  Couldn't they just spare one extra spoon?! Luckily we were all good friends... but still... hygiene is important guys...The menu is short with very few vegetarian options.   Our vegan friend had to be creative and requested a vegetarian bun be made.  They were happy to accommodate and brought her a sweet potato steamed bun sandwich which she enjoyed. The waiters were all extremely friendly and genuinely happy to share their culture with us. Overall, I had a very nice evening and I would be happy to return.  I loved the decor and ambiance. If you are a couple, you could sit at the bar and watch everyone at work. If you are a bigger group, there is a long communal counter with stools. One thing we noticed at the end of the night was that we were constantly looking for a place to rest our feet.  We were all looking for a non-existent beam under the table to rest our hanging legs on. Hopefully, they will install a wooden beam under the tables by the time I return for my next meal :)"

/user_details?userid=5yg-qHWe4feayE7uzPcCfw,Emily G.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"I loved my dinner at Tiradito! It's not very large, and all of the seating is around the U-shaped bar. Lights are a dim red, and the vibe is very cool. Some people are there for a meal while others for the cocktails. Moderately loud. The food comes out very quickly. The fusion of Peruvian with Japanese was so interesting, and everything was delicious. Don't miss the octopus antichucho, the crispy shrimps, and the papa rellena. Also super tasty were the Peruvian potatoes and the dumplings. Also very reasonably priced! Awesome restaurant that I highly recommend for anyone who's looking for a hip place and likes to step outside the box a little with their eats."
/user_details?userid=gbW9uzwA42Kd3CcUq55b8Q,Sharon M.,"Syosset, NY",5 star rating,Outstanding food and unique cocktails. Loved the Peruvian-Japanese fusion concept. Note that seating might be difficult on a Friday or Saturday night because there are not many tables and most of the seating is at the bar. Worth a visit though!
/user_details?userid=QNjcdH4fL9WiQaBDRsfp-A,JoEllen S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4 star rating,I would give this establishment 5 stars but it is more casual.  I would recommend reservations.  This is a casual eatery with seating around the bar.  The food is mostly small plates which are meant to be shared.  I love this format as you can try numerous dishes.  The quality of the food was 5 star.  There are creative cocktails in addition to wine.  The staff was a bit slow at times but over all we had a comfortable pace to our evening.  The dishes are creative spins on traditional Peruvian Cuisine.  I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a place to start an evening out.

/user_details?userid=LVQ3fG3agkd4Qy90xzzjNA,mara c.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"From Toronto, we came to Montreal for the weekend and I always do my research on the best new places to eat. For one of our two meals, I picked Tiradito, a Peruvian/Japanese fusion restaurant. OMG. WHAT a great pick! Cocktail list to die for, and so many completely unique options. My favourite was the El Vato which had, among other things, sesame seeds in it. And the glass was wrapped in a leaf. The sharing plates here are to die for, and to pick a favourite would be tough, but if pushed I think it might be the parmesan scallops. We had the pleasure of meeting the head chef briefly, and this guy has a good thing going. We also loved the design of the space. It seats 50, but all bar or communal seating, so the staff have a very large space in the middle to work their magic, and magic they do work. The team is spectacularly calm, and they clearly work together as a team. No one got uptight, despite being full up all night. Make a reservation because they have two seatings and then try to accommodate walk-ins. We go out A LOT, and this was a wonderful, completely unique experience, from the cocktails, to the food, to the atmosphere. Well done, Tiradito! For us, this is a must-do if you live in, or are travelling to, Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=jL6MqoXd-8N59qh-3lnojA,Valeria B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"So far, the best Peruvian restaurant I've been to in Montreal. As a Peruvian, I'm quite picky when it comes to our food. The concept of the restaurant is Nikkei cuisine, which is fusion of Japanese and Peruvian flavours. Tiradito's entrées where all incredibly flavourful. Our definite favourite was the octopus anticuchos and the smoked salmon causa. The drinks (we had the maracuya sour & the pisco sour) were incredible. Just as good as the ones back at home.Nice atmosphere and great service. Will be definitely going back and highly recommending this restaurant."

Most of the seating is around the bar - perfect for a date. The food was incredible, the drinks were creative, and the servers were super friendly and attentive. Our ceviche took a bit longer than expected to come out, however we were offered complimentary shooters to make up for it which really made the night. Looking forward to returning!"
