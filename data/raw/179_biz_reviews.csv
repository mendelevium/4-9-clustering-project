/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If you want top quality sashimi at a reasonable price and in an unfussy atmosphere..make a reservation at Nozy! Nozy serves a teishoku style meal meaning little plates. Each main dish comes with a little salad and soup. We decided to order the sashimi platter to share. It had a large variety of fish including Toro, sea urchin, scallops, shrimp, oysters, white tuba, red snapper and himachi. All excellent, really glad we ordered the platter. For mains we took the UniDon, take kago and the tuna/salmon bowl. The take Kago allows you to try different dishes on the menu. It consisted of the karage chicken, salad, soup, eggplant dip and salmon rice bowl. Although every dish was delicious, I think the UniDon is a really unique dish and since it's seasonal you should definitely order it!Dessert was ok nothing special. We tried the matcha creme brulee. It didn't have a strong matcha flavor and it made the cream a grey color, which was a bit unappetizing."

Just a few years ago, I remember finding a deal online which allowed me to leave the city and completely reconnect with myself. I felt lost and knew that I had to pack my stuff and go on a solo trip. Japan and Vietnam was my home for 5 weeks. This trip allowed me to truly reflect and ask myself: What do you truly value and makes you feel the most fulfilled?Few things stood out while I was in Japan:- RESPECT your planet and environment.Nobody littered. That's right, you either had hold your trash or dispose it in a convenient store's garbage bin. Next time you go to Japan, notice how there is no bin on the street, yet you don't see any signs of trash. Food for thought.-CONNECT with humans and show that you CARE.Although there was an extremely big language barrier, no matter how lost I was, people were willing to help me. I remember a handful of time where I was lost and people were willing to walk with me to my destination. Try to get that in North America.- Put YOUR HEART AND SOUL in every single thing you do in life, out of care and out of pride.I remember coming back from my trip and couldn't stop raving about the food scene in Japan. I never had anything that was bad, everything was either good or excellent. Now that some of you HAVE BEEN to Japan- you know exactly what I am talking about. Why would you want to cut corners and cheap out on ingredients? When you get caught right handed, not only do you risk losing your reputation but you also risk losing people's trust and your business. So ask yourself why you would even want to half ass something? When you take your time to do something, go full force or stay in your own lane.Thank you Nozy for allowing me to have the TRUE experience of what real Japanese food should be. Japanese cuisine isn't about those fancy creation and crazy sauce. Spare me the pain and don't serve me that kind of food. On top of that, don't you dare tell me you're eating sushi. Authentic Japanese food is about finding the simplicity in food and finding quality ingredients. Some so called ""Japanese restaurants"" in Montreal have all this fame and feel like they have to right to charge you a ridiculous hefty price and for what? For the scene and status? No thanks.You know who truly deserves recognition? Nozomu Takeuchi. A humble man that will stay true to his culture.Come to Nozy and let me show you what true Japanese cuisine is.Nozomu, you deserve a golden star."

Our server was warm & welcoming and didn't miss a beat. The food was really good and the fish tasted super fresh. I had a glass of white sangria that honestly was really delicious and refreshing but wayyyyy overpriced for the very small size of the glass. We shared the ceviche to start, it was good but wasn't quite what we expected as a ceviche and a touch pricey for what you get. HOWEVER, the Salmon&Bluefin tuna chirashi was delicious , generous portion of awesome fish and just enough  rice and salad , I really enjoyed this dish (even the miso soup that came with it was super tasty) and reasonable price. My friend had the salmon chirashi and she really enjoyed her dish too. I really liked this place overall and would definitely come back , I would just adjust my drink and entree order for the price BUT no complains whatsoever about service or freshness/flavour of everything, that was all spot on."

Yes it is pricey but remember that they serve one of the best and freshest seafood/sashimi in town. The scallops were amazing and the toro... just melts in your mouth. Nozy is a definite GEM of Montreal!!! It is a must-try restaurant!
/user_details?userid=BpHrVG_nZ0s-tXg3lx56zA,Be P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,I went to this resto for their 4th anniversary opening. The particular menu i try doesnt really impressed me. The buttersquash is plain no enough of saisonning. Mackerel has a vinegar taste. Unagi is not my meal so i cant really tell if it is better than other resto. Anyway gotta give an another try before i can give a comment on this resto.

It's a very homey-styled restaurant, there aren't many tables. Enough for a few couples and medium sized groups. They often change their menu based on fresh and seasonal ingredients. We ordered the karaage chicken, Toro Tekka Don  and Sashimi.   It was very delicious and fresh! The waitress was very friendly and  came to check on us often.The bill came in a little tin box with rocket candies! A very nice touch! We will be back soon!"

It's small adorable restaurant, nice ambiance with good service. I ordered the fives choice of chef, uni and bleuefin tuna belly and a small bottle of hot sake. The food/ fives sized dishes was good and their sashimi was awesome and definitely so fresh. For the price is reasonable that cost me 88$. Strongly recommended for the special dishes uni and the bleuefin tuna belly. I will surely be back there for their sashimi again and hope next time I don't forgot to try their dessert"
/user_details?userid=f3ZBI7v6aLOCecagnx3uMQ,YangHwa P.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"My family and I usually visit Montreal every other year. We have done the touristy things before, so this time since it is just my husband and I we decided to just explore the neighbourhood (we usually stay around St.Henri). I read up on Nozy and wanted to give it a try. Having raised in Japan I am constantly craving for good sashimi and sushi. From the outside you cannot tell that this is a Japanese restaurant. I love this neighbourhood because you can find some pretty eclectic and diverse eateries. Inside of Nozy does not scream Japanese restaurant either. Interior is not big at all, and it is simply decorated. We were served by the sweetest waitress. The service was prompt, efficient, and warm. In the end she chatted with us a bit and we really appreciated her friendliness. Now, the food was amazing! My husband and I went here for lunch, probably closer to 1:00pm. They had one table full and we got to pick any table we wanted to sit. I had sashimi lunch, and my husband had toro don. Toro is the fattest part of tuna, and don is referred to rice in a bowl, usually with some sort of sauce accompanied by main protein or veggie. It has been a while since I had good, fresh, and delicious sashimi. Well, guess what? Nozy offered me some awesome sashimi! It was my husband's first time eating toro, and I think he was emotionally moved by how good it was. Nozy will be our go to place whenever we are visiting Montreal."
/user_details?userid=Mt-_SvJyDirR9fpZx9dbEw,Tommy S.,"Bellevue, WA",5 star rating,"This chance find has grown to be my preferred Japanese restaurant in Montreal: it is unpretentious, authentic, and most satisfying. It is named after the chef Nozomu Takeuchi's nickname.Despite Nozy's unassuming facade, my frequent visits here have been without fail nothing short of exceptional. Every time, hospitable service was provided with affable ease. The simplicity of the dishes accentuates the strong points of Japanese cuisine: when fresh, ingredients need not be adulterated to excess. Hence, in my opinion, the piece de resistance of this restaurant is the succulent raw fish, be it salmon, otoro/maguro (tuna), or my personal favourite, uni (sea urchin).For such a culinary delight, the price is more than reasonable. I wholeheartedly, recommend this place for lunch, brunch, and dinner. If they opened in the morning, I would even go for breakfast!"
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow, what an experience!!! When we arrived the waitress came to explain the menu and she recommended the Toro Tekka Don.  Now in my head I'm hesitating because I don't like tuna but my friend really wanted to try the Bluefin red tuna. I ordered the Niku Daisuki and we shared. Let me tell you this, I didn't like tuna sashimi cause I've never had real tuna!  This stuff was amazingly good. The pieces cut from the fish belly area were just melt in your mouth good. Half of the pieces were fattier and the other half leaner. I wish I could've just kept chewing it forever just to savor the piece of sashimi...but it ""melted"" so fast it was impossible to do!! :pThe ribs were also super tender and slathered with sauce... When meat melts in your mouth, it's a beautiful thing *sheds a tear*.  I liked how the shrimp had a light, crispy panko layer that wasn't soaked in oil...too bad there's only one! Oh and wait, you have to try their pork karaage with spicy mayo! So juicy and tender and buttery with the mayo...too bad there were only 3 *tears of sadness* We also had the appetizer for $15 that came with 15 pieces of sashimi. With Atlantic salmon, red snapper, yellow tail tuna and regular tuna. It was pretty good! And presentation was stellar! The sides were ok: miso soup, not too salty; salad was ok; homemade pickles were nice but not sure which food it was supposed to go with.  Had an Asahi beer which is very light. Good to pair with delicate sushi. The dessert is shaved ice with matcha green tea powder a scoop of green tea ice cream topped with a portion of ice cream sandwich, two Pocky sticks, sweetened red beans and some jelly.  We asked to have the ice cream on the side.  It's a nice little dessert, nothing crazy. Overall it was a satisfying experience and very filling."

I've always wanted to try it for a while but the location is not convenient for me. And first time I came, they were close for the break. Lucky me, I was around the corner again this time !Initially i have my heart set on n trying their uni don (sea urchin on rice) but they don't have it due to its not the season. A bit disappointed as this is the thing somewhat differentiate it from other jap restaurants. Anyway, I ordered one of their dish of the day; salmon-toro don. And it was delicious!!! The toro (blue fin tuna) was soooo good. It just melt in your mouth! The salmon is interesting; not the typical salmon we normally we, it's not the orangey color at least. If they didn't say it's salmon, I'm not sure if I would've known. I also ordered the sea urchins appetizer: a lil disappointed for its portion vs price. $18 for 5 tiny pieces, I guess this is what you pay for low season. For desert, I got the green tea ice cream with churros. I think it's okay. My fiancé got the eel don. He said it's okay; taste the same as the frozen one. Regardless, I love my toro and I'll be back for the uni don when it's season again!!!"

And if youre a fan of fatty tuna then the toro tekka don is a must!! If youre lucky and they have it in stock, uni don is also very good!However, at my last visit, i decided to try something different! Miso black cod and unagi don. Borh was delicious!"

Their menu changes from time to time to make sure they serve wathever is fresh. Their rice bowls are the highlights of their restaurant. They all come with pickled veggies, salad, miso soup and topped with a seafood of your choice. My fave until now is the half uni and toro don. Theyre so fresh and melt in your mouth. The appetizers are also amazing. Lately they serve the grilled octopus with an eggplant dip. The octopus is so well made and so tender you just want more. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The place is very cute and cozy but nit very big so it's better to reserve before going!"
/user_details?userid=uZdLy0wAHbVd9KN4LDVvfg,M C.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,Small bistro feeling but offers fresh seafood and Japanese dishes. Pay attention to the features on the board (it's in French of course) normally would be a great tryout.

From the outside, it's a rustic deco, it also looks like a dessert place, clean and neat, with the white wooden chairs.We reserved for two, the waitress was really nice, she explained the Japanese menu, teishoku style and the chefs special plates.We were inspired, and ordered:KARAAGE; fried chickenVEGETABLE PANCAKE; Vegetable pancake okonomiyaki styleUNI IKURA DON (SEASONAL DISH); Sea urchin, salmon tartar and roe served over rice, with miso soupKAISEN DON; Assorted sashimi, sweet shrimp and quail egg served over riceWith a refreshing Kirin beerFinally the food was to die for !!!

Had the special cinq plats du jour, very classic Japanese dishes served in cute small containers and all in a bamboo basket. The Takoyaki & Karaage were particularly tasty, and the chips with eggplant dip was special and delicious too, BUT I didn't like the dressing of the sashimi salad, the raw fish filets were not quite fresh, either. It seems that they alter their menu according to the seasonal seafood supply, so I didn't get the urchin bowl which I really wanted, that was a little upsetting, besides that it was a pretty good experience!"
/user_details?userid=VtiHkMISkk69btfo_s0cYw,Luis G.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Interesting Japanese restaurant in the heart of St Henri. Here you won't find the same sushi and sashimi served in most Japanese restaurants in the city, but a variety of specialties and daily dishes, which are supposed to change often I guess. I ordered the salmon tartare and it was pretty good. The prices are on the expensive side, that is, over $20 most of the main courses."
/user_details?userid=1ub5lpd_w2Cl8phnu7nO0w,Mtl_tasty M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wonderful fresh food at Nozy in the St. Henri and Notre Dame de Ouest area  (Sud-Ouest). It you want a special Japanese experience that serves seasonal arrivals, check out Nozy.They serve fresh cuts of fish (sashimi) seafood like sea urchin, fresh oysters, meats like tender ribs, teriyaki steak, karate (fried chicken), beef tataki and so much more. This is not a sushi placr. This is authentic Japanese food that focuses on fresh seasonal food. The specials change depending on what food is seasonal. Specials come with a miso soup and a salad.I called before going to make sure there was enough seating. Definitely call before going as the restaurant does not hold a lot of tables. If you are lucky, they might have seats available of you just pop in at lunch. But definitely at dinner time, call to reserve.Also, because they serve fresh food, they do run out of certain dishes. I went with a group of 4 people at 7:40 p.m. There was only one unidon: sea urchin with salmon roe caveat left. One beef tataki. Of you want to try specials, go earlier to have a variety."

I took their chef top 5 special of the day. I didn't get much seafood in it but it has enough variety to satisfied my palate. The service is great. The waitress is present at all time and she volunteered to open my miso soup for me.... I wasn't trying to be a princess here, the miso heat suck the cover and the bowl together. The waitress kindly open it for me without us asking. One look, she came over to open it for us. The price was 21 dollars with taxes and tips for the plate. I got the meals in less than 10-15 min top. To end this wonderful experience, I will be back when I have more time and hopefully soon!"

The crispy chicken and eel are very tasty. Every main dish come with miso soup. I don't like their salad dressing. Eggplant dip is also good. We will try their uni don next time.
/user_details?userid=3AxAep0OMmy_LgidsYMdog,Rosemary Silu Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came with friends around 6:30 on Friday night. The place is quickly filled with two three other groups. Mostly friends gathering. Menu is very selective and the photos on yelp are extensive. Overall the appetizers were all good, but nothing 'wow', a bit light and not as flavorful as the same ones in other izakaya. Uni don was hearty. The fact that they offer this and in such generous quantity can get enough credit because it's such an expensive and delicate ingredient to come by in Montreal. (Though it made me miss even more the ones fresh out of shells in Japan..Anyone knows where else you can get them??)Didn't like the dessert green tea crème brulee. Tasted like steamed egg, and was served warm. Very weird. And 7.5 dollars? Definitely overpriced.But overall prices were reasonable, probably a bit cheaper than izakaya. Btw my husband came here another time for lunch and recommended the soba noodle."
/user_details?userid=GsILHZExy3vm8BmATEg75A,Ariel H.,"Fairfax, VA",5 star rating,"The bluefin toro tekka don and the uni don (seasonal items) are both so delicious!!! The fish is very high quality (think melt in your mouth tuna that you'd normally only get at high-end sushi places) and they serve real wasabi, not the stuff from a mix.  Eating here made me so incredibly happy... then incredibly sad when I finished my bowl. The $30 price tag for the uni or toro don isn't cheap for a regular dinner, but is pretty fair given the quality of the ingredients. Went in mid October and they no longer have the shaved ice dessert (sad face). The Japanese cheesecake and pumpkin creme brûlée were available but unfortunately neither tickled my fancy at the time.. wish they had a more traditional dessert available Restaurant is small and many tables seemed to be reserved on Saturday night during prime dinner time, but a few bar seats seemed to be available if people are just walking in"

Also took some fried chicken and it lacked flavor.As a main dish, I took the salmon chirashi and it tasted blend!

I've been looking at their menu for a while and finally got the chance to go. It's a small, cozy place away from the busy intersection of Atwater and Notre-Dame. The waitress was very friendly and informed me all the specials that they had for the day.Unfortunately, I couldn't get the seafood platter that came with half a lobster, oysters, tataki, sashimi, and other yummy seafood because I was on my own. But I promised to come back for it with my boyfriend.In a matter of minutes, I got my Kaisen Don, which is an assorted sashimi with rice. It came with a salad, pickled peppers, and miso soup. The presentation was beautiful. The sashimi wasn't as fresh or thickly sliced as I wanted it to be, but I guess I've been spoiled by Vancouver's sushi. It was also pretty pricey for what it was, $28 plus tax. With that aside, it was the first time I felt like I had authentic Japanese cuisine in Montreal. I'm not completely sold on their don yet, but I think I'll come back to try their shared plates."

Heavenly uni don (seasonal dish) will melt in your mouth! It lives up to the hype.You won't find a better value for uni at this quality -- while uni is very pricey and so is the dish at $30, you get a generous amount here.Also the Kaisen don was very good, with a fresh and pleasant selection of sashimi including sweet shrimp (delicious), ikura, quail egg, salmon and more.Recommended to experience Nozy at least once if you are a lover of Japanese food in mtl :)"

The owner changes the menu on a regular basis, so even the choices of dishes are not very varied, satisfaction is guaranteed no matter what you take, and if you go there after a while, you get to try a different set of gourmet! The three times that I go there, either me or my friend took the five choices of the chef, which offers a great variety of little dishes to try out, so if it is your first time there, definitely try it out! The plating is beautiful and it looks super good even before I taste it! My favorite is their sashimi bowl, which is so fresh and succulent, I cannot stop! Their salmon bowl is good but I think it's not as good as the other choices.  I highly recommend Nozy!"

Quite impressed with their food, so fresh and great presentation! I'm surprise this place does not have any reviews yet cus they def deserves some! I came in on a wed night at Aron d 830 an hour before the close. It was quite busy in there but manageable to get seated right away with a few tables opened. I like the fact that they kept their menus simple with just a few things to select from but def brings characters and everything is very different. I wasn't too hungry but wanted to try their salmon so I went for the salmon chirashi. Which was amazingly good!! It came with a miso soup, side salads and some pickles on the side. They were also super fast with their servings!!! I literally order and within 5 mins they already brought the food to me. I was quite surprise. The salmon was tender. It comes with the sashimi, half cooked ones, tartar and some eggs on it. I love it!  Not too heavy just about right as i've been eating such heavy stuff in Montreal so this def does it for me. Not to mention my waitress was really nice  too and it seemed like she was the only served there that night. I would come back again and try their take Kago (chef's choice of apps) and omakase.

The other friend ordered the kaisen don(assorted sashimi don) which was also amazing. In all, we all loved each of our dishes and we will definitely come back to try out more.

It usually comes with a wide variety of sashimi, seafood, vegetables on sushi rice but this salmon chisarahi, well, just salmon and jasmin rice. True, the menu did specify it was salmon chirashi but I believe you shouldn't use the term chirashi as it's known to be a bowl mix of fish, veggie and other ingredients ... chirashi stands for ""scattered""!"

/user_details?userid=FTsYsxk0-vsSk4uil1VD5g,Feifei L.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"I like this little Japanese gem in St-Henri. They don't serve sushi, but instead go for a more ""home cooked"" style of Japanese food. I'm a fan of their Karaage, Uni Don, Toro Don, and Sashimi overall."
/user_details?userid=rztxnI_Uh_izxvq2hFzfrQ,Emily D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"So delicious!!!!! I had the salmon bowl. It was so fresh and tasty. There was an amazing spicy sauce on it that I even asked for more of. My boyfriend got the burger steak.. Bad move! Stick to the fish there and it seems pretty fool proof. They change the menu each week and use seasonal fresh ingredients. Simple decor, pretty good service.Came on a Saturday night and it was pretty full. Overall I really recommend it!!!"
/user_details?userid=YOmyzxTFYULhTCHdDgWQRA,Cathy Yuqi G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place got me hooked no joke. If it is not because I am on a diet (and broke) I'll probably go there every single day until I try every single item on the menu. Their interior is super simple, yet cozy. The waitress is friendly, and helpful. The service is fast. They fully deserve their fives stars! :DI got lucky actually because they offer uni don and toro tekka don on their daily special menu, the two bowls I wanted to try the most. As always, when I go to a japanese restaurant I always order their karaange, and this time is no exception. And lastly no matter how full I am, there is always room for dessert, especially when the dessert of the day is matcha creme brulee. ;)- Karaange: I love their karaange. Probably my favorite so far. The crust is thinner compared to the other karaange I've tried before, so it has light crisp. The meat is sooo juicy. It has a hint of spicy flavor, because there was an aftertaste of ginger, which makes it even more interesting to eat. - Uni don: I tried the uni don at Otto, and I shall say Nozy is winning hands down. Their uni don includes sea urchin, salmon roe, and salmon tartar, which gives variety. The one I had at Otto was smaller in portion and only had sea urchin and salmon roe, and was only 2$ cheaper than Nozy. The sea urchin did not have that ""fishy"" taste at all. Since there are so many different texture in the bowl, it was more interesting to eat.- Toro tekka don: The sashimi tasted fresh, and the tuna was melting in your mouth. The rice was already seasonned, but did not overpower the taste of the fish itself. I'll say compared to the uni don, this is kinda dull to eat, but since I love tuna belly sashimi, this is not a big problem for me. - Matcha creme brulee: Probably my least favorite part of the meal. The creme brulee did not had any taste of green tea at all. The sugar crust on top was a little too thin in my opinion. GREAT PLACE! GONNA BRING MY FRIENDS FOR SURE! THIS WILL BECOME MY NEXT GO TO PLACE ！"
/user_details?userid=VeEM--3NvAQ_b_R8g05CkQ,Adele D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is one of my favourite spots, whether for dinner, lunch or weekend brunch. I love that each meal comes with a small side salad and miso soup. The quality of the food and service is always top notch, and the place in general offers great value (especially at lunch, when prices are about $2 cheaper per menu item than at dinner). I've tried and enjoyed the salmon chirashi bowl, the take kago, the sashimi lunch platter and the seasonal uni Don. The food has always been fresh, delicous, and beautifully presented. At lunch/brunch, prices start at $13 (for the Japanese curry dish) to $28-$32 for some of the seasonal specialities (uni don bowl, blue or yellow fin tuna bowl etc.) Dinner prices start at about $18 I think. There's a reasonably priced wine list for dinner as well (bottles starting at about $30-ish)."
/user_details?userid=0Se8OFrPpi6wE2TY2IVTLA,Eric N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"It's a cozy little place, then fish are fresh however I personally find it a bit lack of selection. Their night menu is also lack of hot dishes (most them are sashimi or tataki)."
/user_details?userid=ESvntjNosDLMzOkUmP9NAQ,Mark C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Excellent service,  food,  and ambiance.  The karage and black cod are must haves. The sashimi is high quality. Will definitely return."
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I went here with a friend on a Wednesday. It was packed and we hadn't reserved but luckily there was space at the bar. I had the Bloody Caesar (sake, vodka, lime, cucumber) and the salmon chirashi (salmon 3 ways: sashimi, tartare, and tataki). It also comes with miso soup, a salade and pickled beets. It was very good but I wish there had been more salmon. There were three pieces of tataki and four pieces of sashimi. My friend had the miso cod which was the special of the day. She said it tasted good but didn't like that there were bones in the fish."
/user_details?userid=bds7VxgVm0e6Pu5RuVV-wg,Thea V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We've been wanting to come here for a while now. We finally gave it a try today. The location is great. it is located on one of the main roads of Griffintown. I was worried when we stepped in because we did not make a reservation and all the tables were reserved. Luckily, we managed to get seats at the bar. I ordered chicken karaage , salmon chirashi bowl and my partner ordered another ricebowl with salmon, shrimp, and tuna(i forgot the name of the dish). It was the best karaage I have ever had! The chicken was so tender, it almost melts in your mouth ! Both rice bowls were really delicious, the fish was tasty, the rice was cooked perfectly and they both came with miso soup and a nice portion of salad. For dessert, we ordered the kaki-gori (shaved ice) with berries and ice cream. It was heavenly!!! Overall, our bill came up to $65 taxes included + Tip. I'm only giving it 4 stars, because the service was a little slow but everything else was great. I would definitely come back."
/user_details?userid=jImKbs4In8xg5c73Gb0NTQ,Eric C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"When available, you must get their exquisite toro and uni don combo. Also served with caviar, miso soup and salad. Their sashimi appetizer is also a good choice, while I was less impress with their unagi don, the rice quality is not consistent. The place is tiny and simple, not recommended for large group, but food quality is good and price is fair, worth going and returning."

/user_details?userid=NXGHE6Cbjpk5S6LNATdYzg,Cindy K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,MUST EAT MUST TRY - a true fan girl of NOZY. Went back for my birthday dinner. The food is just amazing however some of the items are seasonal so don't expect the exact same meal if you go back twice!
/user_details?userid=aNfG4yqETNKXNQgc2qTToA,Doris Z.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",4 star rating,"Reserve before coming here! Had to go back for a second time because they were fully booked when we got there one night. Wanted the uni bowl but was told the season has passed. The waitress was super friendly and accommodating, she offered a special rice bowl for us with several different fishes. It was a combo with salad, soup and some Japanese pickles. The rice bowl was absolutely heaven like. The fish was fresh and the rice was al-dente. With the soy sauce and wasabi, it was a really fulfilling meal. The miso soup was made with shrimps, so it got an extra layer of taste and freshness. We also shared an appetizer platter, you can tell it's made with love and dedication! It got fried chicken, beef carpaccio, sashimi, eggplant dip and kale salad. All were really good. The chicken was super tender, the kale salad was really special with sesame sauce and the eggplant dip! Where can I buy some to eat with chips while watching TV?! The only reason was the sashimi bowl turned out to be $28, it's a bit expensive compared to the salmon bowl for only $16. We only found out the price when we got the bill. We wish we were informed the price before we ordered. Other than that, it was a perfect meal! Can't wait to go back!"

They are serving Uni Don ($28) these days, so don't miss the chance! My friend had Take Kago($17), which is a combination of 5 entrée. The eggplant purée and karaage are pretty good."

Specials of the day also come with the same sides.I ordered the eel special; it was good, but nothing extraordinary. My friend ordered the tuna belly sashimi special. The sashimi was delicious. The only downside was that it was placed on the rice when it was still warm thereby cooking the raw fish a little bit. I would've given 5 stars if it wasn't for that :)For dessert we had the black forest cake. Smooth and fluffy. Probably one of the best I've had."

/user_details?userid=5ca2MkCJFAMafDrRxLMlXQ,Ash L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Every dish is so photogenic here like food p*rn, except that nothing I tried here would give you any foodg*sm. It's a shame because the menu is authentic, the service is nice and the portion-price ratio is so satisfying! So why is it a 3 star? For example, almost EVERYTHING you don't ""physically"" see in the salmon chirashi dish is missing! Besides white rice + salmon, there's really not much going on. If you simply googled ""recipe for chirashi"" there's at least 1 c of rice vinegar, 2 tbsp of sesame seed, 1 tbsp. katsuo fumi furikake rice seasoning..., but the rice tastes plain and the salmon is not fresh enough to 'appreciate' zero seasoning. My boyfriend seems to be quite satisfied with the ""nutrition factor"" of this meal. Maybe it is a good quick lunch option if you want something healthy&fresh in the neighborhood."
/user_details?userid=SaHdDUPNjf8bg-iza4seOA,Harry H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Love this place! It's a little pricey and the service is a bit slow but that's only because the chef makes everything with care and love. The food is fresh and the presentation is spot on.
