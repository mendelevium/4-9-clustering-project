We reached here around 8 pm, it seemed pretty busy but we were lucky there was no wait for the table! We ordered Chicken Wings & Red Curry with a side of steamed rice! Food was excellent. Easily at par with most of the Thai restaurants around Montreal. Authentic and delicious! The ambiance was cosy, lighting and music on point! However the best part of our experience was the service. Our server was sweet and attentive! He had a great attitude and was overall super efficient! Would definitely recommend this spot!"
/user_details?userid=R9Cx2rilFJe-K_DQ5i2EAA,Ashley H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,3 stars for service and for their efforts in regards to social distancing on their patio which I noticed while waiting. However regretfully we did not enjoy the Pad Thai! Chicken was dry and freezing cold like the dish was frozen and reheated! I also got their fried wonton which was ok. I know times are really hard for most restaurants right now and ideally with good service I would stay away from leaving any negative reviews but unfortunately  nothing sucks more than spending money on food you'll end up throwing away!
/user_details?userid=tCM0MJ5yV6CWciWIdGaj8w,Ivan K.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Let me start off by saying that I hesitated between giving 3 or 4 stars because of the lackluster service! It took about 30 minutes to take our drinks and food orders and another 20 minutes after that to even get the drinks. They also only offered refills once, at the end of the whole meal. We were also not offered any tea or dessert and kind of ignored after our dishes were taken away. Both for tea and dessert, we had to find our waitress to ask. It was very disappointing because we had high hopes for this place, but the service is the reason why we question if we will be back!That being said, food wise, I absolutely enjoyed all of the dishes! The grilled calamari (amazing), the papaya salad (super refreshing), the pok-pok chicken and the tilapia were all absolutely amazing. I highly suggest the tilapia, it's one of their specialities. Of the dishes we tried, my only criticism is towards the Tom Yum vegetable soup; it was overwhelmingly spicy without any other character or flavor to it. My suggestion for the restaurant would be to rework it or take it off the menu, it ruins what would otherwise be an excellent menu!"

A mix of Thai, Cambodian and Korean (the owner's father was explicit about that). Chicken wings and scallops are to die for. Amazing service!Gave us a round of shots... Soooo. I'm obviously coming back!"
