/user_details?userid=bUPeHBFEINhqiKj9-k4-zA,Charles N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Wow, tried their sautéed beef banh mi and was impressed as it truly hit the spot! The warm and toast bread vessel was crispy on the outside with a slight brioche finish, while soft on the inside it makes space for the flavourful and juicy marinated beef, pickled carrots and turnips, mayo, some secret sauce and tiny slices of birds eye hot peppers!Also brought home some Banh Gio, which literally translates to ""pork leg cake"" but don't let the unappetizing name fool you, it is a tasty pyramid-shaped rice dumpling, wrapped in banana leaf, filled with ground pork, onions, minced woodear mushrooms. I've noticed they also sell many other items to go including Cha (Vietnamese sausage), Banh Bao (Vietnamese version of the Chinese steamed buns), Pate So (hot savoury meat pie), Banh Chung (traditional rice cake), Cay Chua (pickled mustard greens), Xoi Vo (sticky rice with mung beans) and many more.New to the spot but backed with years of experience under the belt, this place looks unassuming from the outside as well as inside but they sure do pack up some good items to go - very popular with the local Uni student population!"

Decided to order from here and eat first rather then get food from ON ROUTE. No regrets. Yes more expensive than toronto but it's worth it. A box of bun cuon 14$ - but so so good. Authentic. Got 3 banh MI, one regular and 2 bbq pork. Love the French bread they used and even the next day when I toasted to eat it was tasty and fresh. One banh MI is super filling already (price ranged from 5-6$). Also ordered their meat (I don't know what it's called in viet, but usually restos serve this wirh the bun cuon) and it was great. My kids loved it. Will come back again"
