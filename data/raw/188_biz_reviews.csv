We are familiar with Ethiopian dining and love the flavors and teff, spongy, textured ""bread"". They offered a couple of pre fixe menus and we quickly chose the vegan option for two. This included an appetizer selection of hummus, tomatoes & cucumbers and eggplant mixture. The main course was enough to feed 3 or 4 so we happily took home leftovers. The waitstaff was attentive and very friendly even to us non-French speaking Americans! The food was delicious and we never felt rushed. We even found room for one of their tiny cakes. I had the dark chocolate raspberry mousse. Yes, it was as fabulous as it sounds."

Great decor with a hint of Ethiopian culture and very clean place, you need reservations for busy days so just reserve online just Incase. The main restaurant floor is very cozy and romantic with seemed lights, great for a date night.Food is great, portions can be less somedays but delicious. Great place and food for vegetarians and vegans. You eat by hand as it is the Ethiopian culture but you can use forks as well but not comfortable to eat. Place can get very busy but service is always good. You should try their vegetarian combo and kitfo (beef tartare with cheese and chopped kale) Very hearty food. Never tried their desserts!!"

Ordered Vegetarian combo platter that came with 4 items and salad - 2 types of lentils, potato, spinach and injera. Ordered another entree that was made from chickpea. Everything was delicious specially the chickpea based vegetable it was sooo good. Tried the Hibiscus flavored beer which was good. Overall good food and good service. One entree per person is mandatory."
/user_details?userid=GQGvCTi2SvL9U_d3fsm9Tw,Stan C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Always good eats at the Nil Bleu!They seem to have gentrified the menu and decreased portion sizes somewhat - but that shouldn't stop you from having a great meal.My only sticking point is the awful feel of the synthetic washcloths that they offer at the beginning of the service. I would love to see cotton being used rather than icky icky polyester.

The food is great but each time I go there, there is this mean waitress that makes me want to hurry up and leave. I remember I brought my grandmother to eat with me once. My grandma is one old Latina  lady. She isn't used to eating with her hands so she just ordered for a knife. The waitress refused and treated us as if we were inferior than her. Last time I went there, I brought my boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary and again, the same waitress was so rude! Made us spend a sad anniversary. We couldn't wait to finish eating to get out. I love this place but honestly, won't be coming back because they need new workers."
/user_details?userid=Dfu-NuG1YWB96jjBLIlsrA,Krysten I.,"Honolulu, HI",4 star rating,"On our first night in Montreal, we decided to get Ethiopian food for dinner on a suggestion of a friend. The Blue Nile Restaurant offers vegan/vegetarian options as well as beef, lamb and chicken dishes, so there is something for everyone! The drinks looked delicious and fruity and were pretty inexpensive at $8 Canadian. I had the safari, and it was fruity, as was expected. My friend and I shared the eggplant appetizer, which was delicious and then a chicken and a beef dish. The chicken and beef were served on a large platter with the Ethiopian spongey crepes and a little fresh salad in the middle. I liked the chicken a lot more than the beef, it fell off the bone and the sauce was excellent. All the dishes come with the crepes, and maybe they don't eat rice in Ethiopia, but I wish there was a different kind of starch... The service was excellent except for the little mishap when the waiter accidentally spilled water on me. Also, the tables are really close together, so I had to stand up and get out of my chair a few times to let the customers at the adjacent table get in and out....It got very crowded, so try to make a reservation if you can!"

/user_details?userid=92QbGGM9PAyqtW_WVlehiw,Nancy J.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"I was first introduced to Ethiopian food by my sister. Together we have sampled some incredible dishes from LA, DC, Pittsburgh, Boston, and now, Montreal. Le Nil Bleu had the best vegetarian platter I've ever tasted. There wasn't a whole lot of variety, but the dishes they included were thoughtfully curated to fit my taste: stewed collard greens, yellow split peas, lentils, and sweet cabbage and potato. Everything was seasoned to perfection and the house made injera further emphasized the scratch made quality of the dishes. If you are concerned about sharing food while eating with your hands, there is no double dipping here because everything is pre portioned out for two. They did offer to bring us more injera, but we refused it. My favorite part is peeling the bottom layer that the food sits upon. The spongy, porous flat bread soaks up all that yummy spicy goodness. It's a huge bonus."

On a Saturday evening, it can get very busy, so if possible, call ahead and reserve to make sure you have a seat.Nil Bleu is a restaurant that can cater to vegan/vegetarians and omnivores (like me). With tons of choices to choose from, such as a chicken, beef, lamb, veggies, lentils, etc, you're bound to find something you will love.We had the tasting menu for 2 with a mix of vegan and meat options so we could have best of both worlds. I kid you not, we were blown away with the portion and with the taste. The most fun part of our meal was to eat with our hands!Please come here, you won't regret it!"

That last time I ordered take out, the experience was smooth, respectful, timely and the food was excellent. This time, when I went back to get the same food - vegetarian combo - the restaurant was let down by an incredibly rude waiter. He could use some serious retraining. At least the lady he called to accept the order knew what she was doing and that saved the overall experience. And the food is still good. But the waiter was - to put it kindly - unacceptable."

We were 4 people and we ordered the tasting menu for about 30$ per person. It came with an appetizer and then the main course. The main course was delicious with interesting flavours. The dishes require one to eat with their hands. There were 4 different assortments served with crepe-like tortillas. I really liked the fish. We also asked for desert, but i did not enjoy that very much."

I discovered some new grub here and it was simply delicious and full of flavors. Highlight of this discovery was to eat with your hands. I tried the tasting menu since it was the first time for me to eat ethiopian food. Lots of food. And good. First platter was filled up with vegetarian appetizer such salads, hummus, etc. Main course was mainly different meat such as lamb, chicken, filet mignon and some other salads. Tasting menu include also a glass of hydromel and small desserts.The waiter gave us good and pretty fast service. Sitting on the terrace was a plus."

Le Nil Bleu was just two blocks away from Sherbrooke Station, and we wanted to branch out to try different foods (we always go for Asian food as a go to lol ((we were almost persuaded by a Thai place))) this place persuaded us because it was so close and it was so cold. So glad we decided to go here, the food was delicious we got the table d'hôte with the hummus appetizer platter and I got the lamb my friend got scallops. All very delicious!!! We could not shut up about how good it was afterwards and how glad we were we branched out from our usual. Our waitress was friendly and left us alone to eat which was nice. We were seated immediately. The drinks looked good too. I will return. What a gem!"

The decor is very charming, with African themed art on display throughout the restaurant. The food was well plated and everything tasted delicious. The sampling dish for two, although a bit pricy, is a good choice as it allows you to try a variety of stews and injera as appetizers and main courses. The service was quite slow and there was only one waitress, but that might have something to do with the fact that we were there late on a Tuesday evening. Overall I enjoyed this restaurant and will definitely be back next time I'm craving Ethiopian food."

Im not an expert on East African cuisine, but I went once with a friend who's lived in a few places in Africa and she wasn't super impressed with the Ethiopian dishes particularly. She liked their 'other African dishes'. I like that they offer variety.I dont think being in Montreal it will ever be the real deal, especially when servicing Western palates. Restaurants have to adapt to become profitable (dumbing down the flavors and such), but I still really enjoyed the dishes. I never left unsatisfied (except for my wallet). It's a bit pricey..."

The atmosphere was good not too loud or chaotic and we didn't feel pressured or rushed(somehow we spent two and a half hours here).  My love and I had never tried Ethiopian food and our waiter was very good at explaining everything to us. We decided on the tasting menu. Our food was out within 25 minutes and I honestly expected a longer wait based on the description of the menu items.  I was thrilled about the lack of utensils. Every single thing was tasty..everything. I especially enjoyed the lamb, so flavorful. The honey wine at the end was a special treat."
/user_details?userid=yDBHKkWEld05vL4LiAazRg,Phoebe C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We came here to celebrate Paul's graduation, and luckily for us, his dad was paying (we could never afford this ourselves). We had all had Ethiopian food before, so we knew what to expect; savoury curries eaten with spongy bread.Paul ordered an ""Ethiopian Sunrise"" juice, a mix of four exotic nectars, and his dad got a house cocktail. Both were exactly what you'd expect, nothing extraordinary but certainly tasty. At the waiter's suggestion, we ordered the tasting platter for two, but increased for 3 people. We got the vegan appetizers and the vegan main course, but subbed the spinach for the fish dish to appease the meat eaters. The appetizers were quite good. In the middle there was a red cabbage leaf stuffed with a spicy eggplant mash and covered in a soft hummus. On one side was a sweet carrot stir fry, and on the other was a boring tomato salad. We polished this off quickly, and honestly I was already getting pretty full at this point.Our table was cleared, and (sadly) our spoons were taken away, leaving us no option but to use the injera to eat the main course. I like injera, but I didn't want to waste my precious stomach space on sour squishy bread.The main course was unispired. Two of the vegan options were the same, a red lentil stew, which was ok but really boring. Paul said it was his favourite, and still agrees it was boring. There was a split-pea stew as well, and honestly I felt the peas were undercooked, having that woody bean texture. The potato carrot thing was okay, well cooked and flavoured. There was a saucy mixed veg stir fry, which I thought was ok. The fish, according to the boys, tasted like absolutely nothing, and the sauce was bland enough to be overpowered by the injera. In the middle there was a completely out of place vinaigrette salad with lettuce, shredded carrots and cabbage, and pickled beets? It really felt awkward. We managed to eat 80% of the meal before the bread got the better of us. The waiter came around offering dessert, but we just couldn't fit it.The tasting platter comes with a mead, and it was pleasant, much sweeter and ""honey-er"" tasting than many I've had before.Overall we were disappointed in the restaurant. The price was painfully high for the quantity and quality of the food (they are serving me lentils.... that shit costs 0.02$). Despite what other reviewers are saying, there was 0 spiceyness in any of the dishes we received, with the mild eggplant being the absolute hottest item. We've had Ethiopian before, and this really felt like the watered-down, unflavoured white version. If you're hoping this is a good way to get a taste of authentic Ethiopian food, you would be misled.Also, the decor is hella tacky. (Zebra print chairs and wallpaper, painting of ""tribal"" women, a staircase waterfall?????)"

Public street parking is usually available in front of the hotel and will cost 5cents per minute. Food is great! We tried the Vegan platter and added Doro Wot (Chicken) and Lamb Tibbs to it. Made our own Tasting Menu. (they have a tasting menu option costs $60 but we didn't go for it because it contained meat options that we dont eat). The platter is a sharing type containing a an Injera, all the curries are put on top of the Injera and they give you more Injera as you need. Tasty!"

When you walk in, it's absolutely beautiful. I felt like I walked into a really nice mansion, at one point. We ordered the veg appetizer, meat and veg platter along with homemade cakes. The platter was a good way for us to try everything. My absolute favourite was the lamb in berebere sauce. I wasn't a huge fan of the other 5 options on the Injera. The Injera was everywhere, but absolutely amazing. The platter is also a hands on experience - no utensils needed. We also ordered a few of their variety desserts. I got the dark chocolate cake - on a stick. I wasn't a fan. Not sweet, with mild chocolate taste. I also ordered the Honey Wine. Very neat, and not as sweet as I expected.The servers were really helpful with our orders. They were polite, but I did feel a little rushed near the end. Overall, I think it was good to go try it once in your lifetime."

/user_details?userid=AvNmiWFeRlGg5LrhcSj6MA,Anthony G.,"Nesconset, NY",4 star rating,"Very nice, very good Ethiopian restaurant in the Plateau neighborhood.  We ordered the chef's tasting menu.  Started off with beef tartar which was very well spiced though I couldn't help shake off the whole Hannibal Lecter vibe.  Along with it is a mashed chickpea with puréed eggplant and sautéed veggies.  All very good.  They then brought us an array of six entrees.  Lentils, cabbage, spinach, chicken, lamb and beef and they were all delicious.  Only complaint is the injera bread isn't as tangy as I'm use to. It was spongy, but dull.  Topped off with coffee and a sweet honey wine.  Prices are a tad on the expensive side but the quality of the food, the atmosphere and top notch service compensate.  I highly recommend this place."

I had a living social deal for a three course prix fixe lunch and loved it. Our waiter was amazing. He was playing host, and waiting on 11 tables and doing an excellent job. Why the owners wouldn't have had more staff for lunch on Saturday is sort of puzzling to me, but despite the lack of staff we were still waited on promptly and well taken care of. I left a big tip simply for the great job the guy did managing it all. The food was pretty good. I had a curried beef with some sides. The food wasn't the best I've had, though I did enjoy it, the soup and tea were excellent though. The presentation was also unique, as you'll see from my picture. The atmosphere was pleasant and very modern which was nice. Overall - I'd say 3.5 stars, but I'll give it a four because I'm feeling generous."

Everyone seemed to find it pretty funny, even the wait staff. I get the sense that they dont respect the management or the restaurant itself, I can understand why....the food came out luke warm and frankly was underspiced, the worst ethiopian food ive ever had.The music was god-awful, cheezy and weird. At some point a saxophone rendition of Star Light Star Bright came on.The place is pretty cold, pretty weird, trying for a modern chic thing with pictures of Eithiopia and the desert on the wall, bit of a disconnect. While other Eithopian restaurants Ive been too have been relatively warm and inspired, Nil Bleu seems like a weird gaudy lab."

The place itself was lovely, very clean and inviting. The service was excellent. The food was out of this world. We had the tasters choice which involved selecting from a vegan menu and a meat menu. We selected vegan for appetizers and meat for main course, as I was concerned about eating a steak tartar which was in the appetizer selection.The presentation was very inviting and all of the food was delicious. I was very happy with the tasters choice as it gave us an opportunity to try a cross section of selections. I was not disappointed and my husband was as happy as I with the restaurant and our selections.For a cocktail, I ordered a cosmopolitan with the caveat that it not be too sweet. It was the best cosmopolitan ever. I really appreciated the bar tenders honoring my request, and I was rewarded with a delicious well balanced cocktail, not too sweet, not too tart, just right.I heartily recommend this restaurant if you seek a spicy ethnic fare, in a beautiful setting."

/user_details?userid=PL3vcW6-yUOkNlYJ_odBXg,Prav S.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I really have mixed reviews about this restaurant.  The first time I went in was in May 2016.  I was all by myself.  A male server came out and just said ""Oui"".  He thought I must be someone who came asking for food or a job at the restaurant.  I said I would like a table for myself.  He just couldn't believe that I could be a customer.  OK, after convincing him, I sit down and get my food.  Agree, it was tasty and good but the service lacked big time.  I should have just walked away after being treated badly but I did want to show them that brown people can perfectly eat at a good restaurant and pay.Ever since that incident, I have come here two more times and the last time, they just tested my patience.  I came in asking for Shuro Wat.  The lady suggested the vegetarian platter to me.  I asked if I could substitute one of their platter items for Shuro since that's what I came for.  The lady said yes and went in.  Ten minutes later, the platter comes out without the Shuro.  I politely tell her that they got the order wrong and that I asked for a Shuro substitution.  She took the plate back to the kitchen only to bring the same plate back 5 minutes later saying there is nothing they could do about it.  I believe Shuro cannot be ordered as part of the combo since it takes a while to cook.  I understand that because I make Shuro at home but this should have been communicated to me.  Now, they literally give me something that I never asked for in the first place.  I thought maybe I would get a discount on the bill.  No, nothing.  How shameful can it get?  When I complained about this to the manager (who only met me much later), she said oh well, just don't tip your server then!This place has decent Ethiopian food which is lacking in Montreal.  If they were in California, they would be out of business by now with this kind of attitude.  The food is still decent and I appreciate that they have vegan dessert.  The service however sucks!"

I also tried one of the micro-brewed beers on the menu and it was great. The only reason this is a 4 instead of a 5 star review is that, given the ingredients used (lentils, split peas, veggies), it is quite pricey. $30 per person before tax/tip/drinks is a lot when every other Ethiopian restaurant I've been to (and I've tried many!) has charged around $10-$15 while serving a similar amount of food. It's true that the quality at Nil Bleu is top notch, as was the service and ambiance, but it's hard to want to pay double what you would elsewhere for very similar food.Edit: Forgot to mention that none of the dishes were spicy, which for some people might be important for Ethiopian food. I still thought they were all delicious, but the person I was with was disappointed."

The chicken is amazingly flavourful however even as a major carnivore I must say the vegetarian dishes are the highlight of the meal. A great place for a date or a night out.

It took literally 1hr20 mins from the time we ordered, to get our main dishes. Did we receive any apologies for this? None whatsoever. I do not think we were the only ones waiting as I saw people from other tables who got up and just left. The lady, who seemed to be the manager, was very unpleasant. She seemed to be in a terrible mood all night it was hard to get her attention as she ignored most of our attempts to communicate with her. Aside from that, when we did get our food it was not bad. It was expensive and small portioned, but the flavors were tasty and unique. The decor was nice and clean, and if they didn't totally suck customer service wise, I might have come back. Simple smiles and basic customer service training for the servers would greatly improve a diner's experience here."

/user_details?userid=oOfu-75wAzAoAPKzmloHeA,Noah S.,"Great Neck, NY",4 star rating,"I wish I could give this place a 5 but the service was too much of an issue. This place is located on a pleasant, easily accessible street. Parking isn't difficult to find. The decor of this place is stunning: a modern interpretation of authentic Ethiopian ambiance. The walls are covered with paintings depicting rural Ethiopia and many chairs are covered with a zebra-patterned fabric. We were greeted after a short wait until we were told that our table (that we had reserved a few hours back) was not ready. Instead of apologizing, they sat us down in the hotel sitting room next door which was cramped. We sat there in silence for 10 minutes until a waitress came over with water. While this was a nice gesture, it was inappropriate that we waited for 20 minutes after our reserved time. And then when we were seated, they placed us downstairs, right next to the bathroom... Anyway, the service was progressively better as the night went on. The menu is quite interesting, but I would recommend the traditional family platters over individual entrees. We began with the vegan appetizer, which consisted of chickpea puree with eggplant, garlic and lemon dip, tomato salad, and an amazing eggplant dish. Everything was served with injera, or soft, sponge-like bread. This was fantastic; I'm not a fan of tartar, so this was perfect. The eggplant was so juicy and filling, while the dips were extraordinary. We then got the meat entree, which had at least 6-7 different dishes on it. According to the website, the meat plate consists of ""Yatakelt watt : cabbage, potatoes and carrots sauteed Yebeg Key Watt: Moist Lamb cooked in berbere sauce Gommen : Spinach with onion and garlic Doro Watt : Chicken with berbéré sauce Bedergan : Zucchini in our special alicha sauce Zilzil Tibbs : Filet mignon strips sauteed with ginger Digestives: Tejje, Traditional digestive made out of Honey."" Every meat entree had its own unique flavor. The lamb was absolutely incredible, served in a somewhat spicy, herb-infused sauce. The chicken was fantastic as well. Their sides were surprisingly as good as the meat. And once you finished all of the meat, more injera. Everything, except for the service, was absolutely amazing, so I definitely recommend this place if you don't come on a busy Saturday evening."

You can eat with utensils or your hands - but trust me, once you get the hang of it, hands make the whole experience even more interesting!

I'm a huge fan of Ethiopian food. The food here wasn't particularly spicy, even the food that the waiter said would be spicy. But what it lacked in heat, it made up for in taste. The meat dishes were terrific but the real stand outs were the veggie dishes. The caramelized veggies (okra, eggplant, onions) was so good. The chick pea dish (what the waiter called Ethiopian humus) was sublime. Even the injera tasted better than most I've had.If you enjoy Ethiopian, or if you just want to enjoy something new, this is a place to try."

My mom had been wanting to go for awhile so a group of four of us went for Mother's Day lunch.We ordered the tasting menu which I would highly recommend. You get a selection of several different appetizers followed by a selection of different entrees. The appetizers were all delicious, but their Steak Tartare was just amazing! The main meals were all very flavourful as well. I liked all of the meals, but my favourite entree was probably the dish with strips of filet mignon. The fact that you eat with your fingers and share a large plate make it a much more enjoyable experience.  They had a fun selection of fairly priced fruit cocktails - the one I got was vodka, coconut, peach, and pineapple - and a long wine list.I really enjoyed the decor and atmosphere. It was Sunday afternoon and not very busy, so it was nice and quiet. The restaurant had an African theme and was aesthetically pleasing.I really appreciated the fact that the waiter explained to us what to expect and what was on the menu, as none of us had ever been there before."

Glad it was, because this was a great discovery!The decor is very loungey and made for groups and sharing, which I particularly liked. It made me want to come back with a whole group of friends.The service was a little slow to start with, but very friendly, and we didn't hang around for our food. I had a sort of caviar of aubergines, which was very tasty, followed by the lamb in berberé sauce, which was mildly spicy and extremely tasty. The ""bread"" with which you eat your food is a type of pancake, slightly thicker than a crepe. For dessert, they offer an assortment of little cakes on sticks. I believe the one I tasted was chocolate with a lime and ginger filling.Everything is served on a big plate in the centre of the table. I am not sure if they separate meat and vegan options. If you have a vegan friend, this is the perfect place to bring them, because half the menu is vegan.As mentioned, pricing is very reasonable, and I'll definitely be back soon."

I read that the service was terribly slow and expected just that, but it was friendly, helpful, and quick instead. None of us really knew what would be best to order, so our server suggested we get a plate that is not on the menu that provides about 80% of authentic Ethiopian food. It gave us the chance to taste majority of the flavours and satisfy our curiosity!First they brought out a vegetarian plate that had 3 items - spicy diced tomatoes, an interesting spin on hummus with eggplant, and sauteed mixed vegetables. It's presentation was remarkable, it tasted phenomenal, and was a great start to this foodieventure.Then they brought out a large silver tray with portions of lamb, filet mignon, beef, and chicken. In between these portions were other vegetarian options like spinach tossed with onions, lentils, salad, and a pea-puree. Everything was seasoned and cooked to perfection. Absolutely. Everything. Promise.Now, what makes this one-hell-of-an-experience is the rolled up pancake looking bread that you use to pick up all these rich flavours. You eat every bite with your hands and really get in to it with no shame. I paired my meal with a glass (or 3) of their Shiraz and was pleasantly satisfied with how it complimented the meal perfectly."

Already there, I was impressed, even though that restaurant was a little dingy inside. Imagine my surprise on seeing how nice Nil Bleu was inside and then how flavourful the food was! It's too bad they aren't BYOW anymore (they used to be), but it's a great experience with friends. The sour ethiopian bread they serve the food on and which you use as an eating utensil is wonderful! What's great about this place, and their food, is that they have combo plates you can get for the table. This way, everyone can try a little bit of everything. Each different dish is wonderful, really complex flavour profiles, spices, marinades and a lot of stewed meats and lentils. The only downside is the DJ and the sometimes loud and obnoxious music. Other than that, this is a great bet for an interesting date night, or for dinner with friends. I agree with the other reviewers that you should try to sit outside if you can. Oh and make sure everyone WASHES THEIR HANDS before eating :)"

They tried to shoe me away by lying and saying the manager wasn't there, and then later saying they were too busy to take my order (it was 5pm and they had 0 customers). After arguing with them for about 10 minutes, they reluctantly agreed to make an exception and do me the favor of ordering food.

I had to prove to the guy that is was on the menu by convincing him to look for himself, why I waited. I said I would take whatever salad is on the menu, if their menu was different than the one online. He was very rude. I paid with my credit card over the phone. I gave all my info including the code on the back. My wife, who is visibly pregnant and has our 1yo daughter with her goes to pick it up, after waiting 40 minutes, she is starving, they refuse to give her the order because she didn't have the card on her. This is a totally normal thing, to authorize a charge without the actual card, restaurants always do this, but this asshole manager, who I could only assume is sexist, refuses to give her our dinner. They rather let it go to waste and lose regular customers. The guy apparently thought that we were trying to scam them. Did he honestly think that we would call the credit card company and pretend that this was an unauthorized purchase? And I mean, imagine if that was even the case, he is losing the money either way, but no, choose the option where he deprives a starving pregnant woman of her meal. Mind boggling.

They are really trying too hard in some trivial respects and then not hard enough when it comes to the important things ... like the food! The ambiance is nice; perhaps a bit overdone. The service is affable enough. But, alas, the food ... if they worried a little less about the decor and instead emphasised their focus more on the authenticity of their food then I'd be much more satisfied. I really could care less about ambiance. I don't go to a restaurant for the atmosphere. I don't go to a restaurant for the service or to complain to the waitstaff. That's just not how I roll. I go for the food! The delicious and life sustaining food. Notwithstanding the African and black and white zebra-print theme that this place has going on ... the food as I mentioned is anything but authentic. It's just uninspired.   Maybe it's just me but I must have ... I want ... I need to taste the heat and the spices of Ethiopia when I eat Ethiopian cuisine. This place is not that. I think that this resto purposefully caters to patrons who require a more bland and tasteless flavour profile. So if you want a watered down version of pseudo-Ethiopian food then this is probably your jam. However, if you want delicious and hearty and oh so fulfilling Ethiopian cuisine please do hightail it on over to East Africa Restaurant on Sherbrooke Street West in the heart of NDG and everything delicious will be yours to enjoy.

We went on a Saturday night for dinner, and were late due to lack of parking anywhere near the restaurant (only street parking available, and not much of it). The entrance to the restaurant was cramped, with a large coat rack in the way.Decor was nice as well as the ambiance. There was a live pianist which was a nice touch. Since it was our first time, the waiter took the time to explain the concept of the menu and how we should go about eating our food. We ordered a hummus plate to start, which was delicious, but way too much hummus in comparison to ""Ingera"" (the spongy crepes used to pick up your food). I ordered the vegetarian platter, and my date got a spicy beef dish. The food came all together on a large platter with an accompanying garden salad and more ingera. Price-wise, the vegetarian platter was very reasonable ($17 for 4 dishes) whereas the beef dish alone was $14. The chickpea and lentil dishes were both good, but lacked in spice. The mixed veggies and the spinach were also a little bland, nothing special. Overall the dishes were alright, BUT after a while, I became nauseated at the texture of the ingera. It reminded me of a sponge and had a slight vinegar aftertaste which did not sit well with me. I would have probably enjoyed the food more had it been served with some other kind of starch.
