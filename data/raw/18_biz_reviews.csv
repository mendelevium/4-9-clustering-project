The dimmed lighting and intimate vibe was perfect for a date night.We sat at the bar and ordered our first charcuterie board in Montreal, it was hands down the best we had during our stay. We got to select from so many categories and built our perfect board! we had to have the bartender help us as we weren't exactly certain of everything in French and they were more than helpful!The wine selection was really nice as well. Wished this place was around the corner!"
/user_details?userid=qPganFH_fTXrP9r3kXf6YQ,David D.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I rarely give 5 stars. But I could not find a fault with my experience there. Service was perfect. Knowledgeable, not pesky and well mannered. My two friends and I enjoyed duck, cheese, olive and pork items from the tasting menu. And a gorgeous Cote du Rhone bottle. Good value as well. Montreal blows Toronto away in this category of resto/bar/after work spot."
/user_details?userid=tE1JaYfIYrkS3UOsrFjeTg,Fredrica A.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"I came to Buvette Chez Simone for our first dinner in Montreal. We decided to visit this spot after seeing the positive reviews and they were able to seat all 14 of us by pulling up some extra tables and chairs. Since there was so many of us, we asked the waiter to ""surprise us"" with an assortment of cheese and meats charcuterie. There was enough for all of us to get a sizeable portion and the food was amazing with lots of variety. In addition, they were incredibly attentive with our drink orders and the wine was fantastic. Overall great service and great food with great ambiance.  A great option for those looking for a chill night in Montréal."
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I came here for a book club, I loved the liveliness of this wine bar. This place is more of a tapas bar. The crowd was very casual- although there is a no reservation system, it took little time to get a table for 5. They had a wide wine selection- I was particularly intrigued  by the orange wine- interesting to the palette. I loved that you can assemble your own charcuterie plate- with half or full portions of meats, veggies, and cheese. The liver mousse really stood out for me. They also had main course options if you are craving something more hefty as a meal. My single complaint was the lack quality service: Too many clients to few staff members= poor service. I don't even recall how many time we had to flag down our server to 1) get us more bread 2) get us more bread (at some point we are ready to grab it ourselves) 3) stop taking away the menus because we specified we would be ordering more food later 4) keep reminding our server of the wine i wanted 2 or 3 times..Simple you have more customers- hire more staff to serve your customers! Would easily bump up the stars in my books if this was improved!"
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,"This place has cool vibes on a Thursday night but I found it ok overall... slightly overpriced and not very filling. It's one of the first times I didn't really like the wine served at a wine bar. The rosé was not very good in my opinion and for $10.50 a glass, I expect better. I can usually get a delicious bottle of rosé for under $20 at SAQ!Buvette Chez Simone is really loud on a Thursday night (located on Avenue du Parc with lots of metre parking). Not a place to go if you're trying to have a meaningful conversation, as I had a hard time hearing the people around me.The server was cool but not quick enough with our requests and never anticipated what we might want (wine, water and bread refills, etc). The fish fritter could have been served warmer and the vegetarian mozzarella, courgette and mushroom plate was pretty good but on the bland side. I do like that they serve some of their food on wooden planks and that it could fulfill the true meaning of wine & cheese with nice plating. Overall, a typical hipster/plateau kinda restaurant. Don't think I'll be going back but it's good for people who like charcuterie, French tapas and dry wines."

I really enjoy the dimmed lighting, which makes it a perfect spot for a date. I also love the eclectic music that the DJ plays. I am a sucker for mellow lounge music and good lighting in a joint.As a fellow wino I approve their wine list. It has a really big range. You can order a funky orange wine or if you prefer a nice round red. The staff has excellent knowledge of their product, but their hospitality is inconsistent."

I'm no sommelier but we sampled nearly a dozen wines and ended up getting 4 bottles, they were all so good we couldn't choose!"

/user_details?userid=CUqNeiOX2QDPu505iqPZvg,Phil G.,"Black Hawk, CO",5 star rating,"Buvette is one of the better wine bars I've tried anywhere in the past few years. To be fair, I would say it's a great small plate restaurant that serves some good wine.  The crowd is young, vibrant and dressed in black. It's loud and fun.Three of us were thinking small for food and ended up feasting on fois gras, duck confit, charcuterie, cheese and an amazing baked red cabbage that must have been brushed with a stinky bleu cheese. We shared a small Greek salad that also had standout quality. It's heavy on cucumber, tomatoes, and a soft feta and light on lettuce.The duck was CAD15 and everything else was about 5 or 10 depending upon small or large order.For wine we had Bourgogne Blanc that was easy to drink for 55.Servers were friendly, attentive constantly sweeping and wiping the table. They kept the water bottle filled as well.We'll definitely hit this place again."

Don't get me wrong, Vancouver is up there but this place killed it for us!We got there about 8ish,  for dinner/tapa's. Over the next next 4 hours, we went through 2 wine/cheese platters, old fashions, whiskey, a couple of bottles of wine! It was amazingly perfect. They had a live DJ, who was playing 90's R&B and hip hop!We just sat there talked and saw the place transform from a restaurant to a bar to a club. I think the place has a lot to offer, for all age ranges and moods! Depends on when you come, you might get a different Buvette Chez Simone! Highly recommend this place for wine/cheese and drinks!"

/user_details?userid=tOciKKXgD7omiqx3swyvCg,Felicia N.,"Jackson Heights, Queens, NY",5 star rating,"A friend of mine and fellow New Yorker relocated to Montréal a few years ago, and according to her, ""My favorite restaurant to impress NYers is Buvette Chez Simone and it never fails me."" I have to start this review by saying the service here was absolute tops. We stopped in late on a Saturday night and just missed the kitchen. We ordered off a smaller menu, a selection of cheese and bread and mousse, but it just wasn't what we needed. We really needed hot food. David recommended we check out Le Majestique Montreal. Their kitchen is open until 2am. He really saved our night. We will absolutely be visiting Montréal again soon, and Buvette Chez Simone will be one of the firsts restaurants we visit, when the kitchen is open! If you're checking out reviews and thinking of stopping in here, stop thinking, and just go!"

/user_details?userid=Tdp-vTDHrfR2rQk2emDKiA,Alice B.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"This is the kind of place you send your out of town friends to when you want to when you want to show them how impressive your city can be.  Buvette is the type of place you go to when you want to spend time in a welcoming, hip atmosphere with people who appreciate the good taste of food and wine.  It isn't the place you take your friends to who do not know how to spread out their nosh with their drink, or people who are expecting to have a traditional meal (although you can get a full chicken dinner for 2 if you so desire).  It also isn't for your friend that thinks the $10 bottle of depanneur or grocery store wine is heaven. They simply won't understand.Buvette is great for lovers, for friends to have fantastic conversation with, or for a business lunch or dinner.  It's great in the hot Montreal summers and in the cold, depressing winters.  If you love wine, cheese, and charcuterie, this is where you go to put a smile on your face. Sometimes it can get very crowded, but it would be a waste if a place such as this didn't."
/user_details?userid=dVm9U2clyt5uZMPs1CQzaw,Ayo G.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"Magical. This place was our best night out in Montreal. It's a lovely space, the server couldn't have been more charming and helpful, and the food and wine were exquisite.They have a great selection of cheeses. We asked the server for recommendations on a combination that would include soft, hard, strong and mild cheeses. All of the cheeses were delicious, and they were presented on a lovely cheese board with apple slices, nuts, and a creamy berry spread. The bread was outstanding.The server also helped us to order a great bottle of white wine, even letting us taste a couple before choosing.The salads were also excellent, creative, and fresh. It was a casual but classy atmosphere. The service was attentive but not rushed. Overall, an outstanding choice.FWIW, this experience was an early dinner on a Friday."

They have an extensive menu of all kinds of food. They have great cheeses and cold cutsI had the pleasure of trying the Greek salad, Accra, chorizo and fries. Everything was tasty. Great wine list and beerCons: it's very loud and always busy."
/user_details?userid=MWCPUFk-fnNXehPosCtwHA,Geneviève F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Definately a resto-bar to discover. Food is good, with lots of variety. Portion size is more tapas style, so you will get to try many things. The regular menu options are great, safe bets and the new items that rotate are usually big hits but can sometimes be misses. The atmosphere is crowded and loud so depending on your mood this might be a plus or a minus. It's not possible to make reservations and the line up can get quite long if you show up at busy hours. There is a pretty terrace if you can get a table there.The Greek salad is amazing and I'm sure you will enjoy most plates. Give it a try!"

/user_details?userid=1DhKvepHRNKs3aUw6NSOKg,Alice A.,"Fargo, ND",4 star rating,"Small place but definitely worth trying. I've been there with friends who were new in town, and it definitely represents the great Montreal vibe. If you're lucky you'll be able to sit on the patio which adds even more character to the place. The staff is incredibly nice and will do anything to accommodate your tastes/wishes.Drinks wise the wine is very good and very decently priced for the quality.Food wise their planches are good/tasty and have various cheeses and charcuterie, but seem really overpriced for the quantity of food you get. However all of the similar places around are about the same price so I guess it's more the area that dictates the pricing. Overall I recommend for an afterwork. Wouldnt recommend for dinner as if you're hungry you'll end up with a salty tab. But otherwise it's DEFINITELY worth a visit."
/user_details?userid=DemPfs76Aop42ffsa7WNhg,David N.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"In a city that seems to be in constant flux, Buvette is shockingly consistent.No matter what day of the week, or time of day you visit, it somehow always manages to feel like 7:30pm on a Thursday in some continental metropolis. It's never so full you can't find a seat, yet, it is never ""dead"". You will never be the best looking person there, but you will always feel better looking for being there. The staff will always appear to be having more fun than you, regardless of how much fun you are having.Whatever you order will be just fine (unless you order the cider--and I'm really hoping it just happened to be a bad batch). The plates pair nicely with each other, so you can order without feeling the need to curate. The staff will be helpful if you have questions, and yet slightly intimidating.If sounds like I live here, I don't--I've only been a dozen or so times, but each occasion has been entirely different.I've come here for an afternoon snack, after work drinks, a quick bite before heading out, a quick bite after heading out, actual heading out, and I've even managed to stay until closing once.Go with friends from out of town, friends from town, friends that moved away, friends that just arrived, friends-of-friends, or make friends there. Bring parents, coworkers, clients, a date. Same Buvette.And yet, for whatever reason, it's not a place I'm completely fanatical about. A good choice for most occasions because it does what it does so well, but there are definitely other places.If you're looking for a wine bar in the neighbourhood with a good kitchen that's open late, Buvette is a solid bet."
/user_details?userid=7igTVTgqI3WiqZp8hrgaMA,Yelp Was Supposed To Delete This K.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"It feels strange to adulate over a salad,  However, the Greek salad here was spectacular; it had Greek olives (duh), Persian cucumbers, mysteriously perfect tomatoes, marinated red onion slices, and a HUGE block of fresh feta,I had my first orange wine here; I still can't tell you where it came from (despite looking at the label), but it was herby, dry, and very delicious.I would absolutely love to be here again with a full appetite to try the roasted chicken or the duck hearts."
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've had Buvette Chez Simone bookmarked for awhile now, partially due to the fact that wine bars are never fun when you go alone and it's so much cheaper per person when you're in a group. Unfortunately, the majority of my friends put most of their money into clubbing and buying bottle upon bottle of cheap alcohol, which is great every once in a while, but I personally don't have the energy to do that all the time and it can get a bit repetitive. So what better way is there to explore the wine bar scene than when your parents come to town and want a semi-classy affair with great food?Upon first walking in, I noticed that the space inside was way more spacious than what the exterior implied, and it had beautiful wood furnishings that shined and sparkled with the help of the lights above. We decided to try an array of rosé and red wines by the half glass (all from France and Italy if I can remember). For the food, we got half orders of the spicy sausage, garlic sausage, duck rillettes, and bleu cheese; a Greek salad on the side; a dish of lamb with roast corn; and a half-order of roast chicken with root vegetables.All of the wines tasted amazing and really contrasted with each other in terms of taste, even if they were in the same color group. I preferred the stronger wines as I like stronger drinks in general, but the lighter ones were still great! The charcuterie platter came with thin and crisp crouton-like bread slices, pickles and pickled onions, a cube of beet, mustard and pink sauce (not sure what it was), and bread and butter on the side. Everything on the plate tasted amazing, and when I mean everything I mean EVERYTHING. Sure, the spicy sausage could have been more spicy, but I liked how its somewhat harder texture contrasted with the more conventional one of the garlic sausage, and both had distinct tastes as well: the spicy one tasted more aged, for instance. The duck rillettes reminded me of pate's chunkier cousin with actual shreds of meat, and I honestly could have eaten an entire bowl of that and not get sick of it. The bleu cheese was savory and bold and went along well with the red wine. The beet tasted very fresh and the pickled vegetables added a bit of refreshing sourness to the party. As for the Greek salad, it was okay; I personally don't like olives that much because they are WAY too salty for my taste, and this time was no different. The other components, however, were very good, especially the feta cheese. After we were done with the starters, the waiter cleared our table so he could bring out the main dishes.When the lamb was served, I couldn't help but notice how tiny the portion size was for the price we were paying for it. The piece of meat was probably about the size of my palm, and it cost $19.50. It tasted really good, and the knife cut through it very smoothly and had just the right amount of fat, but it still feels like a bit much for what we were getting. The chicken dish was pretty tasty and had crispy skin and juicy meat, but I've had better elsewhere at much more casual places that obviously are cheaper. The real star of the plate was the root vegetables, as they were perfectly roasted but maintained the essence of their natural flavoring. I will definitely try to come back to Buvette Chez Simone to sample their other main courses and salads; everything here is really top notch! Now, if only I could actually afford to eat at places like here on a more regular basis..."

Although it can get loud and busy very fast, there is a very nice wine selection and the waiters are more than willing to help with your selection, in French and in English! More than the wines, their charcuterie plates are excellent and reasonably priced. We also tried the fish and the chicken, both of which were tender and well-seasoned."

You order various items such as pâtés, cheeses, charcuteries, and warm foods from the menu and all of it comes on a wooden board accompanied with bread, jams, and pickles. And the wine selection is out of this world! Our waitress was so knowledgeable in suggesting various wines to sample before we decide in a bottle. The ambiance itself was very hip, and the DJ was great! This whole place resonates with the cool, chic and laid-back vibe of Montreal."

From their evolving wine list to their perfectly balanced cheese platters and sharable plates, this is my fav spot for a casual weekday hangout. I believe all their waiters are trained sommeliers. I typically always ask for their suggestion, and it never disappoints. The food is also on point, with lovely salads, small fish & meat dishes to share in addition to their famed cheese platters. If you're feeling really hungry, go for the chicken and vegetables, which is tender and delicious. This place tends to get very packed on weekends, so I recommend reserving or dropping in any weeknight instead. This spot is also ideal for a date or small group event."

I came here on a friday night with a few of my friends and although it was bustling, it wasn't an uncomfortable type of busy. We were given our own booth right away, and the waiter was extremely fast with the menu.    We decided to shared a bottle of white upon the waiter's recommendation and a plate of charcuterie. The food was actually quite good and very reasonable in price. They also have a number of other shareable tapas.     Having been a regulars at Pullman for sometime now, I've gotta admit that I'm slightly jealous of everyone that lives close to this place. If you're in the mile-end and looking for a relaxing night to catch up with friends, Chez Simone is an excellent spot. P.s. theres no sign at the door so the place is a little hard to find.

That was plenty of food and with a liter bottle of their house white, the bill was still under a hundred dollars. Service was fantastic.

/user_details?userid=fxWl08fyTniG2CBH_eIxPw,Min K.,"New Haven, CT",5 star rating,"Simply amazing. Our waiter, Simone (not the owner, but he's worked there for 6 years!) explained the french menu in English to us very thoroughly, labeling each item and giving suggestions throughout. For starters, we had the foie gras mousse, brie cheese, and the fish cake, which came presented beautifully. This was perhaps the most memorable dish I had in my four-day stay in Montreal. I wish I had more, and the flavor was absolutely to die for. The wine pairing, also suggested by Simone, was perfect as well. My friend and I talked about it every meal afterward, saying how it doesn't compare to what we had at Chez Simone. Like, seriously, it was one of the best meals I've had. The greek salad was equally refreshing and good. The dessert THE DESSERT. The roasted apple was A M A Z I N G. The apple was perfectly sweet and the berry sauce (some rare berry that grows in northern Canada) was the perfect amount of sweet to finish off the meal. The only thing we weren't amazed by (but still loved) was the chicken. I think it was cuz we were so full from the starter, but it was still amazing. It's just hard to LOVE chicken. The service was attentive and detailed, and we really didn't want to leave in the end. The price, considering it's Montreal, was not bad at all. Granted, we split everything, but the same thing would have easily cost double. Amazing amazing. Is the first place I'd go to if I ever went back to Montreal. Real highlight of our trip!!!"

Buvette Chez Simone has quite a few items to choose from such as charcuterie, fish, cheese, rotisserie etc. The first time I went to Buvette was a few years ago with some friends. I remember the wine and the chicken being really good so I was excited when my aunt suggested that we go there for a drink. We showed up at 5 pm on a Friday and sat at the bar. it wasn't too loud and there weren't many people. Although it is a wine bar, I ordered the bloody Caesar because I am obsessed with bloody Caesars and I have to try one everywhere I go. This one was good but it was in a small glass. To me what stood out most was the food. Since we had dinner plans we shared the rillettes de canard and each got an accra de morue. The rillette was very good and it came with bread, pickles and pickled onions. The size of accra was a bit smaller than a tennis ball which is pretty big in my opinion and is $3/each. What I liked best about it was the sauce that it came with, which was a curry based mayo. I definitely recommend this bar and I would definitely keep going back."

For the earlier commenter complaining about the 2oz glasses... this is not uncommon and if you don't like it, just pass on it... It allows guests to try different wines ... The service was friendly and extremely professional - the place works like a well-oiled machine , it is no surprise why this place is so popular and well-liked. Prices good, music well selected, and atmosphere very warm. Only neg comment I can say (although not a deal breaker), is we found the seats at the bar a bit unstable and after 30mins, not that comfortable... but everything else makes up for it!  Ideal for a date or with friends."

To call it a wine bar would be limiting. They offer a good selection of cocktails and beer as well. But alcohol is easy do right if you do your home work. Where this place excels is in it's food offerings! Everything on the menu is very tasty and fresh. Well thought out menu, from the fish balls to the salads. Looking for a great evening in a hip part of town, this is the spot. Lively crowd, a bit on the louder side of things. ""I am sorry, I did not catch that"" ""I said, I think we should order another bottle of wine!"""

We tried several glasses of different wines and each one was great. Our server was super friendly. We told him we were visiting the area and he provided us some recommendations for restaurants and bars. We also ordered the cheese platter which was incredible. The goat cheese and cheddar cheeses were amazing. The prices are extremely reasonable as well, we let the waiter select the wines for us so we were a little scared when the bill came but they were reasonably priced ($8-10 can$ per glass and $6 for a cheese plate). Anyone staying in the area has to check out this wine bar."
/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Simply amazing wine and snack bar (if you can call calamari and chorizo ""snacks"").This place is insane especially on Thursdays during their 5 a 7, with line-ups out the terrasse. I was here last night and by 7:30pm, the place was packed.Great beer and wine selection where you can either buy by the bottle, glass or half-glass and with prices for half-glasses between $3.75 - $5, it gives plenty of room to try several wines without breaking the budget. Their snacks are also great. While you have the expected cheese and dried fruit plates, fries, salades, chorizo sausages, calamari, smoked salmon, options are also offered in either half portions or full portions with prices for half-portions between $5-$7. They also serve roasted chicken for dinner but only after 6pm.That's the food and drink. Let's talk clientele and general vibe. No annoying 20-somethings or Mile End hipsters, but an older working, professional or graduate student crowd in their 30's and 40's. The people are generally very nice and unpretentious. No posers.I'm coming back, that's for sure."

Looked like a good crowd and it seemed like a happening little spot. Food and drinks were good but the service was terrible. We were visiting from Toronto for the weekend and our French is limited but the server seemed to be avoiding us at all costs and barely attempted to communicate with us. She actually came and cleared our food plates and didn't even ask if we wanted another drink (our glasses were clearly empty).I get there may be some language differences but in any other situation I'd expect people to try to meet half way. In the service/hospitality industry I'd suggest staff should be going the extra mile to make their patrons feel welcome. Unfortunately we did not.

Chez Simone doesn't take reservations so we waited longer than we would have liked for a table for 4 (over an hour on a Friday night) but it was well worth in when we were sat at a bar table near the front of the restaurant. The wait staff was excellent, personable (and cute!), the atmosphere was lively (perfect for a Friday night) and the food and drink were both equally delicious. I particularly enjoyed the roasted chicken, which our waiter informed us was the 2nd best in the city - next to Ramado's. I really liked how wine and beer came in small and large sizes - allowing me to try several different varieties. I would go back again and again"

I sat at the bar and ended up conversing with the three people who sat next to me, which is always interesting when you go out by yourself.

/user_details?userid=T40u1FJXOOYs3rmOnwGm6A,Kiera S.,"London, United Kingdom",4 star rating,"Went recently for drinks with a friend on a Friday night. Good times, though incredibly loud. Casual, laid back, and we were impressed with how inexpensive our night ended up being. Under $25 for three glasses of wine (two were 'half' glasses, but were pretty much full) and a delicious cheese plate, plus bread. Stay away from the lower-end glasses, though (at least for the white wine). We tried six in total, and found the mid-range ones to be well worth the extra couple of bucks. Server was a bit of a space-case, but friendly enough so no big deal. We weren't huge fans of the orange electrical cables hanging on the ceiling - made it feel like they were in the middle of renos, though I'm sure it was intended to be industrial-chic. Overall, liked the place and would go back. I imagine this wouldn't be the best place for a date (unless your date is an electrician, in which case I'm sure the decor would win you major points), but for an evening with friends it was just great."

/user_details?userid=7qzfClFiE3SchM3F3MwIpA,N P.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Chez Simone is about simplicity.From the very unpretentious but nonetheless cool design to the relaxed and casual crowd, the essence of the bar reveals itself at every level. Special mention to the low lighting, cleverly set in small fenced glass boxes and in bulbs throughout the bar, which conveys a very intimate atmosphere and an outstanding design.La Buvette won't offer you fancy or creative drinks. Come here for the wine, either to enjoy it in inexpensive individual glasses or in a affordable bottle if you are part of three. The list is pretty diverse and likely to match all types of wallets. Aim for the 2008 Ciro if you are in the mood for a late night light yet flavorful red wine. The food is descent on top of everything, but be aware that your choice will be limited to 3-4 available dishes late night. Go for the chorizo, olives and blue cheese. Not memorable but definitely complementary.Chill and hip crowd. Everybody is welcome, from francophones to anglophones. Very loud, however."

The vibe here is very relaxed and cool, the crowd is hip, the food was great, and the prices were decent. The servers were very accommodating and friendly, and were willing to explain everything to us... in English!We had a meat and cheese platter. The pate was sooo creamy and tasty and the smoked meat was pretty good as well. I loved that it came with fruits instead of pickled veggies, which is what Toronto platters usually come with. We also got the greek salad and the rotisserie chicken. The chicken was okay.. And the greek salad was a cool twist on the traditional salad - there's no lettuce or greens. Just chopped up veggies - tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, peppers - in a salad form with a generous serving of fresh feta.The only downside is that there's very limited seating and it may take you a long while before you can get a seat, especially on a weekend. That's okay though, because there's usually some spots at the bar where you can squish in and grab a drink and some food while you wait."

The crowd was literally spilling onto the patio outside, but after we were promised a 30 minute wait (which was accurate) we squeezed though the packed restaurant and waited at the bar. The staff were very helpful in selecting wines - our server especially was enthusiastic and passionate about the wine list and we appreciated his effort recommending the right wine to go with our food. The food itself was fantastic. The bouton de culotte especially was so good i will now be disappointed with any other goat cheese for the rest of my life. The mousse and duck were also lovely. We tried the clams, actually the only item that didn't totally knock my socks off - they were very good but i found the spicy chorizo a bit overpowering for the poor delicate clam. Still, we had a great selection of olives and a very tasty rapini and pancetta ""salad"" that all went very well together. Prices were very reasonable for the quality and experience. I'd definitely recommend and would go back on my next visit to Montral."

Many tables were scarfing down chickens which looked fabulous and attested to the atmosphere here: a place to eat good simple food, drink well made table wines and laugh a lot. All of this for a very reasonable price. The hostess was very friendly and accomodating and the servers cheerful, knowledgable and efficient.

/user_details?userid=5Ymfsf9fAYz-Ds_p0xawVQ,Anthony K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Well, it sure ain't the Skala. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Buvette Chez Simone wasn't the first wine bar to open up in Mile End, but it's boldly gone where no Mile End wine bar has gone before: that mysterious two-block stretch of Park Ave. between St. Joseph and Mont-Royal, where distinguished tuxedo purveyors like Waxman rub elbows with head shops, carpet stores, appliance retailers, and other curiosities. When Cocoa Locale opened up on Park a few years ago, I predicted that it marked the beginning of a renaissance for the strip. Well, let's just say that the renaissance hasn't exactly been explosive (and the ongoing construction on Park ain't helping). Buvette Chez Simone indicates that the desire is there, though: this joint has been jumping since the day they opened. And with good reason: the food, with an emphasis on mix-'n'-match appetizers, is generally very good, but, more importantly, the wine selection is very well chosen AND very affordably priced.  In fact, I think you could safely credit Buvette with having started the New Wave of Montreal wine bars:  wine bars that are affordable, young, and positively buzzing with excitement.  Highlights: squash and rapini risotto, a good selection of charcuterie, and roast chicken in quarter, half, or full portions."
