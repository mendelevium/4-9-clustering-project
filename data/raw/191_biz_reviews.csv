Charming ambience.  The gentlemen waiting on us were gracious, helpful and unobtrusive. Everything we ate was delicious from the brik to the couscous dish with lamb, prunes and raisins.  I'm pretty sure the baklava is the best I've ever eaten.  Highly recommend for a quiet, delicious meal in a charming setting."

Especially, Chicken Tagine were very soft and had a nice scent of lemon. With couscous, it was a perfect combo! But we ordered a bit too much and it was over priced. Make sure you only order 1 platter for 2."
/user_details?userid=IgOePmcvgmfuNDhTcE0Zbg,Heather C.,"Greenwich, CT",5 star rating,We had got dinner to go twice while staying in the neighborhood and loved it. The couscous aux legumes was a delicious vegetarian option. On top of that the owner threw in a spinach dish with sauce that I can only describe as magic. For our next order he packed us a box of things we ordered as well as things we did not - including a tureen of that magic sauce which we put on everything. He is so generous and friendly!

The food was as good as myMother in law used to cook. We started with the artichoke and hearts of palm salad which was so fresh and tasteful. Casserole d'escargot was prepared to perfection. Harira soup was so proficiently spiced with a great consistency.  The tajine of chicken with lemon and olives was delicious. The couscous was so light and airy The couscous  royal has packed with lamb chops, chicken, lamb shank, and merguez which was exceptional. To full to finish it all, but finished dinner with mint tea. This is definitely the best Moroccan food I have eaten since my mother in law passed."
