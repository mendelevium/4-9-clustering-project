Labeled a Greek restaurant but put away all of your most common conceptions of Greek food. This is Greek elegance and sophisticated magnificence in the food preparation. First, the think that makes any establishment is service. Here, the service is impeccable but subtle. With just a glance the server , Juliano attended every need. So personable, so available, but never over-bearing.      The Greek salad is the essence of pure, fresh tomato, cucumber, peppers, not too much olive, two chunks of feta, in a deliciously fresh olive oil and vinegar with subtle but effective seasoning.  Most importantly, and this epitomizes the restaurant, all presented at the perfect room temperature and as if the vegetables and marinated perfectly.      The Linguine aux fruits de mer  is not too overbearing on a bed of fine pasta with a delicious, sauce that lingers on the pasta and is so flavorful.  The seafood is ringed calamari, head calamari, sautéed, scallop, and huge shrimp. In New Orleans would be called prawns. My only complaint was a little light on shrimp and one more would be amazing.       The cappuccino was so thick with milk froth it far outlasted the coffee. House made pistachio ice cream is perfectly not too sweet and rich and creamy perfection.        This restaurant knows EXACTLY what they are doing!  Somewhat limited in selection but everything done to the finest detail.         You must ask for Juliano, he will take good care of you.  You will leave feeling like a friend."

Salad bowl was huge and the salad was excellent. Crab cakes were just ok. Seafood linguine was good but I certainly had better. The service was nice and friendly, even though the place was quite busy. Overall, it's a good choice for dinner but it is pricey for what you get (mostly because of proximity to hotels), the dinner for 2 with a bottle of wine was over $180."

/user_details?userid=uee_1ho6P5yRnmUJEXL6GQ,Col N.,"Calgary, Canada",4 star rating,"My coworker and I were looking for a greek restaurant and found this fancy place. We ordered The Special it was all deep fried but it was very crispy and delicious! The dip was the star for this dish, it was a thick tzatziki dip but balances the deep fried egg plant, zucchini, and saganaki. There was a lot more zucchini and egg plant versus saganaki. Wish there was a lemon to add some zest to the dish.We originally wanted to get the sausage but they do not have it anymore, which was a bummer. So we settled for calamari. The Calamari did not come with any dip just a lemon... but the calamari has a nice light batter and the calamari was perfectly cooked.Lastly, the main dish! Seafood Linguine. The sauce was very flavourful. The shrimp was HUGE and it was accompanied with two big scallop. Drizzled on the side was some calamari. The seafood was perfect cooked. However, the downside of this dish was the Linguine. It was too soft and a lot of it. Overall, the meal was delicious I do recommend this place. However, this is a fancy twist to greek food. If you were expecting a traditional greek meal you may be disappointed."

Ventured in because I'm staying at Hotel Le Cantile Suites but this is not your standard hotel restaurant. Greek owned, very authentic (I say, having never been to Greece but among Greek-born diners tonight), great wine list, elegant atmosphere, best swordfish I've had in my life. And they have a dessert that combines baklava and tiramisu!"

I took the slightly faster route and visited Restaurant Zante with the wife. We had a chilled bottle of Pellegrino, split a Greek salad, and had two or three appetizers.  We had their house made ice cream and beignet-style donuts for dessert. Everything was excellent, including the service. If and when we ever return to Montreal, we will definitely visit this restaurant."
/user_details?userid=FstzuJSgXFa2Jvd6ezprlw,Christa R.,"Scarborough, ME",3 star rating,"An unforgettable experience to say the least! Staying at the neighboring hotel (Le Cantlie) with my husband and newborn and thought that this restaurant would be a convenient choice for dinner. Started off when the hostess insisted on wheeling/parking our stroller. Odd request, but sure.....she hit every.single.chair as we walked through two long rows of tables. I had to walk away I was laughing so hard. (I was holding our baby, or it would not be so entertaining). Hair was in everything-my water glass, appetizer plate, and main course! Ugh. I was so turned off and over this place when the main course finally came. I can't attest to the authenticity of this Greek restaurant, we had veal and lamb; surprising the food was good though overpriced for what you get. The waiter forgot my husbands beer and asked if he wanted it as he was clearing the table. Then asked if we were allergic to peanuts, stating he had a nice surprise for us. We got so sick of waiting for the complementary dessert that never came we went and asked for the bill! I wish I could say it was busy, but we went right at 5pm and were the only table outside. Service was awful, food was okay, wouldn't eat there again no matter how convenient."

Wow, was I wrong. This Greek food is fabulous. Freshly baked pita bread brought to the table. Three course prix fix lunch menu very reasonably priced. My halibut was sublime and my family enjoyed the lamb chops, spaghetti, and giant Caesar salad. The greens on the house salads were phenomenal. Great service, stylish decor. Highly recommend."
/user_details?userid=cXH0QOJVRAw0GvIrZnWnaw,Simon Y.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Great place for a business lunch! I had the special of the day which was a lamb shank and the soup of the day for appetizer. Both were really great tasting. The service is attentive and friendly and the atmosphere is quiet enough to discuss business.
