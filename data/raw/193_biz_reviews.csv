The name derives from a Korean dish: you wrap BBQ into lettuce leaves essentially.What makes SSAM stand out to me is how cosy and homey it feels. The staff is so welcoming and congenial, and the place is completely unpretentious. The Japchae I had was very filling, but maybe I would have preferred it with chicken? - if I remember well, we get to choose. The ssam is their main dish. They install the grill in front of you, fill it up, and your waiter takes care of the rest, so you get a show and a meal! I'll admit it can get awkward and silent, if I could change one thing about it, it would be the amount of meat that it includes, I can't help it, I want more!. Still, I have always loved going there, I can't bring myself to take a star away because of that.."

We ordered Korean fried chicken, bugolgi, and jaigae (kimchi soup in case I can not spell).  Everything was very good. The service was very good and friendly. They brought us things we didn't order because we showed an interest. This is another good Montreal restaurant in a city of good restaurants."

Their seafood pancakes are falvourful and crispy. The bibimbap is huge and healthy since it comes with a lot of vegetables. I especially like their  beef patty with galbi sauce. Also, they have different flavors of soju (popular Korean alcohol). For those who aren't big in alcohol, you can try grape soju, it tastes almost like juice. Portions are pretty generous considering their price. Service is quick and staffs are friendly. Recommended."

We were greeted by friendly staff and the atmosphere was very cozy. We didn't expect much, as the restaurant wasn't advertised much from the outside, but we were pleasantly surprised - we discovered a gem! The food was amazing and authentic. We ordered a bibimbap, which was generously portioned and flavourful, a pancake and order of rice cakes to share and ramen. Everything was very tasty and the service was impeccable - owners are very welcoming and friendly! Would recommend to anyone, and will continue to go back.It is nice to have a tasty Korean restaurant in the area and not have to venture all the way downtown!"
