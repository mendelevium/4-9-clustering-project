Everything was super flavourful and fresh! We tried both the calamari platter and the fish platter, they were both great. The platter is big enough to be shared between 2-3 people, it comes with ceviche and rice."

/user_details?userid=PQ2loXZaf-EFcRkfNOUZAA,Melissa L.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"When in Montreal craving Peruvian food, we happened to find Chicho's. About 3 miles from downtown we made the drive and it was on a busy street in the middle of Saint-Laurent boulevard.We came around noon, it was completely empty with only one young girl as our server. She came over, greeted us, was sweet and respectable although, I don't think she spoke much English. I noticed this because whenever my boyfriend spoke in English she would kinda get confused and reply in Spanish. It wasn't a problem because we both speak it, we ended up just speaking to her in Spanish for the rest of the visit. But, this probably wouldn't be so favorable for someone who cannot speak or understand Spanish. Prices are a little on the pricy side. I don't think I'd make this place a regular spot for that reason, but from my experience of what I specifically ordered it was a huge portion. ""La Ronda Marina Calamar""- this plate was 30$ and more than enough for two people. If you know me by now you know I eat a lot even though I'm small, I am really greedy and rarely can share food because I eat just about everything. But, in all seriousness, this plate was actually shareable and still had me full by the time I left. It brought ceviche, chicharron de calamar and arroz con mariscos. THE CEVICHE THOUGH. Simply amazing. Beyond flavorful and one of the best ceviches I have ever had. The seafood rice also hit the spot. I was impressed with everything and seriously craved more the following day.I definitely would recommend this restaurant if you are in the area and want to try some bomb ceviche!"

The alfajores were delicious, as was the lomo saltado, ceviche, and ají de gallina. If you're craving Peruvian food, this is the place to go!"

/user_details?userid=Tx5NEnzvykEDQIr4-L-DzA,Thomy A.,"West Orange, NJ",4 star rating,"Good Peruvian restaurant, the leche de tigre was good and the pollo a la brasa was big enough for 4 people. The chicha morada and maracuya are natural amd refreshing. Good service."
/user_details?userid=wJDOZnYhSNYyxpQTf8QW3A,Mariah A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,This place is AMAZING. One of my favourite places to eat in Montreal! Everything I've ever ordered on the menu is always so perfectly flavoured and tasty. Their ceviche is one of the best I've tasted. Highly recommend to try this place.
/user_details?userid=LN4ajhAiIshKkXJQhuh6uA,Kali E.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Came here on a Monday night. It was quite quiet, so we sat ourselved to a table. The waiter was very friendly and gave us a starter of plantains and sauces. He carefully explained the sauces and handed us the menu. The menu had great options with lots of peruvian options. We decided to go with the famous $30 seafood platter and the beef hearts.  I was pretty disappointed on their ceviche though. It was way too salty and we had to return it. The calamari was OK and the rice was pretty good. I found the 2.50$ price tag for a can of Inka Kola too pricey. I have tried other peruvian restaurants in montreal, and this wouldn't be my first choice."
/user_details?userid=YtUmPTsw1yRJBa_9jb8c0A,Rebeca R.,"QC, Canada",2 star rating,"I just went to this restaurant today and was greatly disappointed. I don't think it deserves the 4.5 stars it has.The food was very deceiving and the place is not cheap. The fish was very dry and there was nothing special about it.The ceviche was good, but not wow. Limited beer choice (only one kind) and the waiter was courteous but very inexperienced. I will not be coming back and I don't think you should go there for Peruvian food. Not recommended!!!"

/user_details?userid=gbx3IYFKB-36HhV5wM3G1w,Dawn E.,"Marlborough, MA",4 star rating,"There were six of us.  We shared four dishes.  I imagine some of the others might pop in and give you their take but here is mine:Service:  Friendly.  Prompt.  They speak Spanish, French, and English, BTW.Beverages:  Okay, we all shared Inca Cola.  If you like Inca Cola, you'll be excited they have it.  If you've never had Inca Cola, it tastes like bubblegum meets marshmallow.  But it's yellow.  Weird, but sweet and palatable.Okay the food...-Ceviche Mixto:  One of the best ceviches I've ever had (and I've had a lot).  It was flavorful and SPICY.  Delightful.-Fried fish (can't remember the name):  Less generic then you'd think.  Very good.  Not greasy.-Anticuchos (beef heart):  I'll let others chime in on this.  This was my first ever heart so I don't have comparative analysis.  The leanest muscle, it is not fatty at all.  I have decided I prefer fatty meats, but it was flavored well and definitely edible.-Saltado de Mariscos (a seafood with rice, veggies, and potatoes in a reddish sauce):  OMFG.  I want more of this today.  I want so much.  SO MUCH.   Why did I eat so much poutine earlier that I was full?  BOO.  Eat this.  Trust me.Splitting the check, however, was an ordeal.  Do not expect this to be as easy as the rest of Montreal.  They don't get it.  They can split by dish, and that's it.  End of story.That, however, wouldn't keep me from coming back.  Just bring cash."
/user_details?userid=8ORNOINzRyN0oU-7QdNIpQ,Nicolas D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The food was absolutely amazing! We had the ""Mero A Lo Macho"" dish and were completely blown away by how good it was. Caught me off guard. We were also served by an awesome waiter who talked about the food and the chef with complete admiration and appreciation. The place may not look it, but definitely worth the visit!"

/user_details?userid=QYC3HlU2lVeocJSU_UP73A,Alex Catherine L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We came here on a saturday night at 8pm and the restaurant was empty. We wanted to try peruvian food for a while and since this one seems to have good reviews, we decided to try. We had ceviche, fish cake, rice and spicy shrimps. The food was fine but nothing special. It was pretty pricy for the taste. Wouldn't really come back here."
/user_details?userid=WIDGcVvvuFQUA2FT3uc8rw,Adam G.,"Dallas, TX",4 star rating,"As I was discovering new parts of Montreal...I found this gem of a place.  I'm so glad that I did...just loved their Ceviche Mixto.  It was AWESOME!  Man, these guys don't play when it comes to their portions...so come with a hearty appetite and you won't disappointed.  I recommend that you try one of their drinks named ""Chicha Morada""...it's made from Black Corn, and it's very good!"
/user_details?userid=LljG-nU7A0-sW-t0cioVpg,Lauren A.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,Awesome food. Great service. And again awesome authentic Peruvian food.  You can tell everything is made with love.  The chef. He is so nice. Came out said hello. Asked if he could make my husband something special.  Love it!
/user_details?userid=x1DO3SBrCO_R-SVDZ3r5RQ,Chris L.,"Holmdel, NJ",4 star rating,"The service was very friendly and it felt as if I came into a family restaurant with warmth and character.  I was served plantain chips and dipping sauce while I ordered and they perked me right up. What a great touch. I ordered the Arroz con mariscos and the jalea.  The jalea was good but I expected more variety than just calamari and fish other than the one shrimp they skewered on top.  What they lacked in variety they made up with quantity however, so I was content. The Arroz was full flavored and definitely hit the spot. My fiance was in heaven with the Arroz with its amazingly tender calamari and perfectly cooked rice. Definitely would come afain. The food was slow to come out but upon seeing the quantity and quality of the food I quickly dismissed my discontent. I love supporting family businesses where I can definitely feel the love put into the food."
/user_details?userid=wwPSdOrW0jVNgzr8whD0Jw,Rowan U.,"Putney, Australia",4 star rating,"This is an authentic Peruvian restaurant, and a pretty good one at that. I went there with a group of friends after a few beer at Vices et Versa across the road - it was a good combo, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it!The key dish was the cerviche, and they didn't disappoint. We got the mixto, and it tasted great and had a good selection of seafood. Better than that, no one got sick! I don't mention that because we were worried (we wouldn't have ordered it if we were), just that there's always a risk when you're serving uncooked seafood - but hey, that's what cerviche IS.We also had the anticucho (beet heart skewers), which is another Peruvian staple which they did well.We got a few other side dishes (fish, vegetables, etc) which were all nicely done. The place is nothing too special to look at, but the service was quick and friendly.This place serves up Inka Cola, which is another must-have for any real Peruvian restaurant. If you've never had it before, give it a try (it looks like pee, but tastes like bubblegum!)."

/user_details?userid=YP5hNfCZruMdByn6Ah6XpQ,Ari S.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"Fantastic Peruvian food with gigantic (and I mean gigantic!) portions.  I guess you'd be tempted to call it a hole in the wall but I like the ambiance which largely consists  of a mural of a mermaid and a huge flatscreen television that blares (at least while we were there) the cheesiest Latino love balladeers this side of Julio Iglesias. Personally, I think it adds to the experience. The ceviche is one of the best I've ever had and the chicken I ordered was super tasty. Still, so much was leftover that I had to get a doggy bag - not a usual occurrence for me.  I was excited to have chicken for lunch the next day only to lose the brown bag at a bar an hour later. Oh well, I hope someone enjoyed it."
