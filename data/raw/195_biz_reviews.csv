Being Afghan myself; I loved the authenticity of the food, cozy decor and BYOB!  Great value as well for good quality food/portions.Make sure to try the mantu (afghani dumplings) !"
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Attention rice lovers!!! You need to make a pit stop here :)If you order the Mourg Kebab (chicken brochette), it'll be served on a lovely bed of 3 colored basmati rice: white rice seasoned with cumin, green rice made with coriander sauce and brown rice seasoned with saffron. The grilled chicken is yellow (looks like tumeric color) is sooo juicy and delicious...the only negative about it is that there's only 1 kebab!  My Kabuli Palaw (lamb shank) was equally delicious. Tender and fall off the bone good. Beware if you don't like fatty clumps cause there is a little bit.  Easy enough to separate out.  The lamb shank is buried in a bed of yummy brown rice, sprinkled with shredded carrots and plump raisins.  My friend and I really liked the Afghan styled side of salad--simple, lemony, fresh and punchy. Upon arrival, the waiters were joking with us and welcoming.  When we asked about the cups of sauce in the center of the table, our waiter deadpans that it's Afghan shooters.  We pause and burst out laughing and then he explained the yogurt and peppers sauces. They gave us basket of warm Afghan flatbread and we nibbled on it while waiting to order. After our meal we each opted for a cardamom green tea as there's only one choice of dessert, the rosewater pudding.  Since neither of us like rosewater, we passed on dessert."

It's a tight space, cozy and more on the darker side. You can bring your own wine, in the summer you can sit in terrace in the back and it is so cuteThe service is hit or miss depending on who you get that day but it is mostly very friendly and courteous. (We once had a really spaced out waiter that it became comical after 10 mins, we never had anyone who was rude)I usually go for the lamb or the vegetarian plate. The soup is all good but I think their show stopper is the lamb and the aubergine. I recommend his for a nice discovery dinner out w friends or family :)"

I loved the soup and the salad.They give you enough rice to feed a family of 4 but it's so flavourful that you want to be leaving any behind.Great byow little spot
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Little gem on Duluth street. It was on my list forever and finally had the chance to make it. I have never tried Afghani food before but very familiar with Persian food and have to say that they are quite similar.I was there in a Friday night and it was packed. We went for the table d'hôte and basically had the soup which was quite good, the dumplings weren't anything to brag about. My favourite part of the meal was the korma chalaw which is lamb shank in a tomato sauce which came with 3 kinds of basmati rice spiced differently and salad. It really hit the spot! I am not a big pudding fan so the desert didn't quite do it for me sadly enough.Next time, I would for sure go with the lamb and basmati rice trio. For all you BYOB lovers, check this place out if you haven't been at least once! PS: don't forget to RSVP ahead as it gets quite packed on weekends..."

When I originally walked by the place seemed deserted, but the pictures on yelp made it look amazing and I took a chance. I asked to sit outside and it was a beautiful garden area that was full of other diners. The service was great and the Kabuli Palaw with chicken was one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. I would not recommend the Teka Kabob since it was bland but everything else was delicious! I will definitely be returning on my next trip to Montreal!"

The bring your own wine feature la great. The decor I wouldn't consider modern, but it's part of the charm for me. Wasn't a big fan of the dessert, but some of my friends loved it, a matter of taste I guess."
/user_details?userid=iJ_sn6RfwO5unR9YgFTd4Q,Camille R.,"Côte-des-Neiges, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Tried it for the first time a few weeks ago and I am so impressed. The food is so good and such good value. The table d'hôte is worth every penny. The service was good but a bit slow at times. They also don't accept MasterCard which I find strange. But I would go back in a heartbeat. The food was so delicious and the portions were very big. Their rice with carrots and raisins is the best rice I've had. The house soup is delicious and refreshing. The lamb melts in your mouth.
/user_details?userid=-dHf9xfEKamemlhrslmtSg,Sawda K.,"Alexandria, VA",5 star rating,Great place for lunch or dinner if you are looking for a halal place to eat. Had dinner when I visited Montreal for the first time and the Mantu and Qabuli Pulao were great.
/user_details?userid=BH2_4QOocDErmFc6vsbJzQ,Mitchell K.,"Georgetown, Washington, DC",5 star rating,"Was in Montreal for the weekend, visited Kyhber Pass on a friend's recommendation. We (2) were not disappointed.Atmosphere was quaint, a little bit crowded (at night on a Friday, so not a surprise at all). Didn't wait at all for a seat. Neither patrons spoke French nor had we eaten substantial Afghani food but the waiter was very helpful in understanding what we were ordering.Both patrons ordered the Table D'Hote which ended up being sufficiently filling if not a bit overkill.Vegetarian combo: perhaps the best okra and eggplant I've ever had. It was obvious that all of the ingredients had been marinating for a substantial amount of time as they practically fell apart in my mouth. Cauliflower and spinach were also very good.Korma Chalaw: I did not have this but was almost tempted to order it (even as a vegetarian) upon seeing it brought to other tables. My dinner partner ordered this and seemed to enjoy it, easily devouring a portion which typically would have caused difficulties finishing.Soupe maison: maybe my favorite usage of red lentils. Amazing flavor and mouth feel, would definitely recommend. Even my omnivorous dinner partner preferred this to her soup...Soupe mashaba: no substantial comments here. I did not try it but my dinner partner did not love the soup. It wasn't especially terrible, it just dulled in comparison to the rest of the meal.Rices: Both entrees were served with three different rices, substantially distinct not only in color (green, orange, white) but also in flavor. Both entrees were also served with a ""salad"" which was essentially just cucumbers, lettuce, and diced tomatoes -- nothing substantial but a nice refreshing complement to the otherwise warming meal.Finally, Rose water pudding: mildly flavorless but a nice way to unnerve the stomach following the incredibly flavorful entrees.Overall, no regrets having spent one of our few nights in Montreal here and I would definitely consider returning in the distant future."
/user_details?userid=VGvZWfAasstXQhqLtWB-bw,Fei M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Very very delicious restaurant. You have to try out the lambs. With triple rices. It's a place where you can bring your own wine. You can have fun with your friends with your own drink. Sadly my colleagues and I didn't get the terrace. We could enjoy the sun and nice weather.
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Husband and I went here a few weeks ago. I ordered the Korma Chalaw which is a Lamb Skank piece in Tomato sauce with a Trio of Rice. The husband and I ordered our own meals, which ended up being a lot of food. We immediately regretted not sharing!! The ambience is cosy and the place is well decorated. We have had authentic Afghani food before and felt that the food here was on point. However after hearing such great reviews, we expected the food to be better. Service is good and the place is BYOB."
/user_details?userid=C2YxxeHBKtJ5Eokpi2urcQ,Anna N.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"This was AMAZING. A liiiitle pricey as in it's best for dates or special dinners, but nothing that will set you back too far. It's also BYOB which changes everything on the bill. The appetizers were amazing - get the eggplant!! It melts in your mouth. I don't eat meat but my bf loved it and said it was cooked perfectly. I got the vegetarian option and was not disappointed. It was the eggplant again like the appetizer but I didn't mind because it was so good. Ambiance is beautiful."
/user_details?userid=cF1oFZ2cl1xpQIsq-yA4mQ,Aretha C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A cozy BYOW afghan restaurant that serves meat dishes with rice as well as vegetarian options. We had a large group in a sectioned off room, where noise was not a problem at all. However, the windows are really drafty and they tried to compensate with blasting the heat, so seating was not quite comfortable. It was cold but also hot at times. The service was fast and courteous.I would highly recommend taking their table d'hote options, because you get a soup or salad, entree, main, dessert , and tea for just a bit extra. If you got one main only, the prices are not worth it. I started off with the lentil soup, great flavours, but too salty.For the entree, I ordered the mantoo which are dumplings in a tomato and yogurt sauce, also quite tasty. For the main, the lamb shank with the raisin and carrot rice was delightful. Who knew some raisins would elevate the rice so well? The milk pudding reminded me of the chinese steamed milk dessert, really light and creamy. If you order this way, you'd have plenty of leftovers which I ate for lunch the next day! Just don't get one main only, it's a bit overpriced."
/user_details?userid=M8ZoXoqSexnzDReGIKlLSw,Suska S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love this place. Its like one of those holes in the wall places that serves really awesome food from countries you would never visit. In this instance, it's afghan food. The decor is kinda cavey and orientally, which is interesting. Kind of makes you feel like ur in a cave. Its almost always crowded everytime i went. Its great for groups and for a first date type dinner. Byow - yes! Bring ur own drinks and enjoy the food and your alcohol I love that there isn't a lot of selection on the menu. And i love that there are fixed meal plans. A full course with desert and tea for 27$ or including an appetizer for $30. And then. You just pick which one you want. I suggest splitting the appetizers among yourselves so you can try everything. And always get the lamb! My favorite dishes are the lamb with brown rice and carrots and the lamb with tomato sauce. Heavenly dishes! I always have alot of left overs to take home. Portions are huge.My only complaint is that the salad has raw white onions. Im a raw onion hater, and they can't remove them. Even with that, i love this place!"

My friend had the chicken kebab with basmati trio. They serve it with a simple salad which tastes great with the combination of the dish. The kebab is delicious and juicy cooked to perfection. I really enjoyed the rice trio as well. Great place for dinner; Always packed, i went there twice before and couldn't get a seat so i had to make a reservation."

/user_details?userid=zvFQl7FHhXyfuCbaZbIBSQ,Jobye-Kyle K.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"I came here with a big group of friends for a little holiday dinner, it was all our first time having Afghan food and we were all blown away. Khyber Pass's dining rooms split in two, the upstairs for smaller sized groups/tables and a downstairs for bigger groups. We were in the downstairs area given the size of the group. The décor was pretty, was all molded to feel like a stone hut or cave with some nice accents with colored banners. Definitely put you in the mood!Service from the waitress was very attentive and very informative, she was explaining the major difference between Afghan food and Indian food or Middle Eastern food as well as giving good suggestions on the menu. A lot of us ended up taking the 'table d'hôte' given its value (includes appetizer, soup, main dish, dessert, coffee/tea). A lot of food came with the table d'hôte, we were more than filled at the end, not to mention every single course was delicious. I had the Lamb Korma (braised lamb leg in tomato-based sauce). The meat just fell off the bone, was super tender and tasted great. If you're afraid of spicy food, no worries, Afghan food is not spicy at all, and just more fragrant and savory compared to Indian food. They have a nice variety of basmati rices as well which each provide some different flavors to contrast with your main meat dish.My only complaint for the downstairs area is the two service times at 6pm and 8:30 pm, we had to leave promptly by 8:15 due to the next service, but everything else was so good that it was forgivable. Just make sure to get the later service if you'd like to take your time and talk after dinner. All in all, Khyber Pass was a great discovery, I'd highly recommend checking it out!"
/user_details?userid=ao7Jt5QoBWO15lGdZH16Kw,Christina T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I have never tried Afghan food but I thought it might be very similar to asian food due to the proximity of Asia. We rented a table next door of the main restaurant. The decoration has this cave feel-like atmosphere, it was underground with dimly lit light. It was light enough to see where we are going. After we ordered, I received my lentil soup and it was very good. My main dish, the portion was big enough to feed two people. Obviously, I couldn't finish it all. The dessert was a rose yogourt... I am not sure what they called it but it tastes similar to creme brule.  I devoured that thing in five seconds. Overall, I give this place a 4 stars. Something that tastes this great for under 25 dollars for a three courses meal is something I will rave to the world."
/user_details?userid=3ZrY316WfsTrFKbUCc9waw,Diane M.,"Rotterdam, NY",3 star rating,"Nothing more to add, it's cozy and I like the feel of the place.  Packed in that's for sure.  Rather difficult to have a quiet conversation when your sitting on top of each other.  The service was attentive and polite and did answer our culinary questions.  I'm not sure about huge portion size as some reviews indicated, I would say our kabobs were small 6 cubes of lamb , with 3 different types of rice.  The small salad on the plate was delicious but wished that was bigger and less plated to ce.  But, we did enjoy the experience.  Once was enough for me."

We shared the Mantoo entree which gets you the most bang for your buck entree wise and was a great mix of flavours. I had the lamb shank, which was fall-off-the-bone tender. My husband had the lamb kebab which was cooked perfectly. I normally love rice but didn't find much of a flavour difference between the three rices offered. I really enjoyed the fresh salad.

Was it the fact that business isn't as good as before because of all the construction work done in the area? We each got the 30$ (29,95$) tâble d'hôte that consist of soup or salad, appetizer, main, dessert and coffee or tea. We also chose different dishes so we could share. The mashaba soup was very good. No complaint there. Then then mantoo. Beh... It was like eating over boiled dumplings where you had to look for the stuffing. The we got the lamb shank and the chicken brochette. The dishes came with a trio of rice that was flavourful but kind of dry but oily at the same time. An old batch perhaps??? The lamb shank was quite juicy and good but the chicken brochette was overcooked and dry... Nothing special to say about the dessert. I've had better. It was kind of too sweet for my liking...The service was ok. Nothing out of the ordinary. It was slow paste. Good thing it's a byob and that we had two bottles of wine with us! Lol! Would i come back??? I don't think it's worth the detour and the hassle of going through traffic and searching for that miraculous parking spot."

Khyber Pass is one of those places where you know as soon as you walk in that you made a good choice, because everyone there sounds happy.  We were."
/user_details?userid=0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,Cindy Feng Xin L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I visited this restaurant on Mother's Day, expecting to see a lot of people, but it was quite empty and unpopular. We tried their specialty gigot d'agneau (lamb shank), which has to be booked two days ahead and shared by at least 4 people. Honestly the taste of the lamb was a bit disappointing because it was too dry and tasteless, so I actually have to dip it in the yogurt to season it. Before having the lamb we actually had the soup and some entrees. The taste of their beef soup was way too salty, lentil soup is okay but nothing special. Their entrees such as mandoo (Afghan dumplings), eggplant, pumpkin were fine, but we had the difficulty to finish and didn't want to waste. So when we started having the main course, we were half full already. My parents mainly ate the rice because they didn't like the other meat and vegetable. I don't particularly like Afghan food and didn't have any expectation for this restaurant. To be fair, it wasn't bad, but just not something I like and would want to come back for. The interior decor of the restaurant wasn't very aesthetic despite being exotic and ethnical, the terrace looks okay. I would not recommend this restaurant."

/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It's fun to try a new kind of cuisine that is totally exotic to you.  You never know what exciting discovery you might make.  Case in point was my recent visit to Khyber Pass, an Afghan restaurant in the Plateau.  The restaurant is located right on Duluth and is a BYOB.  There is a SAQ Express a block away if you forget to bring a bottle with you.The restaurant is pretty casual, cozy and the decor is Afghan-inspired.  The dining room is kind of small and crammed so a reservation would be wise.  There is also a terrasse come summertime and it is really nice and intimate.Prices here are pretty reasonable.  You can get the table d'hote which gets you a soup or salad, choice of main and a dessert.  This was $30 and it gets you a ton of delicious food so it is hard to go wrong with it. For my soup I had the beef mashaba soup which contained beef, noodles and a variety of spices.  I really enjoyed the blend of spices as it was quite different from what I was used to.  This was followed by the korma chalaw which was lamb served in a tomato sauce.  The lamb was so unbelievably tender.  I never even used my knife to cut it up since it just broke away with my fork.  This was served with a side of rice done three different ways.  Once again everything was seasoned really well.Dessert was a rosewater pistachio pudding.  Admittedly I didn't enjoy this part of the meal very much.  The pistachio overpowered the rosewater and I just wasn't a fan of it but then again I tend not to like nutty desserts so it was probably a question of personal taste.If you're looking for a little adventure for a night then you should definitely come to Khyber Pass.  I really enjoyed stepping out of my comfort zone and being exposed to a new kind of cuisine. The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious.  What more can you ask for?"

Called in at 8:00PM for the earliest availability of 9:15PM. So we were hanging around a nearby bar (Le MTL).we went there around 9:15PM. We were seated immediately. The waiters were Afghanis and were very friendly, explaining and suggesting some of their top choices ( kabuli Palaw, Chopan and Mourg kababs), we ordered all of it plus Bara Kabab and Mourg Chalaw. All of them were served with white, coriander and orange rice. Kabuli Palaw was served with orange rice garnished with raisin, nuts and carrot. Garnished rice is the best of all the rice. They were flexible to substitute other rice with the garnished rice without extra charge. The food is good, grilled and cooked to the perfection.  The flavors were as expected. Lentil soup was also very good. The downside of this restaurant is 1. Wait time2. Overly priced for the quantity served 3. I have had better Afghani food in the NYC4.

However, the larger dining experience was just less that what I expected! We all ordered the dinner plates which came with tri-coloured rice, salad and then meat or vegetables. My vegetarian plate was unmemorable. The rice was a great quality but really flavourless. The meat dishes were similarly nothing delightful. Perhaps I am unfamiliar with the cuisine but it's not food I would want to go back for. The decor is interesting and the BYOW is a plus point! Perhaps it's worth a shot - especially if you want to try a new cuisine (i can now check Afghani off my list!)."

This recently occurred for the event of a friend's birthday where he brought us to Khyber Pass on Duluth street for a little Afghan BYOW and for no other reason then simply ""finding the restaurant looked cool everytime I passed by"".And indeed, Khyber Pass does look rather interesting from the outside and equally as much inside. Our table was located in their basement space which has been modelled to look like an cavern. It is a little odd - and because of the use of polycarbonate on the walls, a little hot - but it certainly fits the overall theme. Being in a smallish basement space made for rather noisy acoustics once the space filled up but otherwise no complaints!I had never had Afghan food before, so I basically decided to work with their Table d'hôte and wing it! My friends at the table also having never had this cuisine before also decided to simply try stuff which allowed me to sample a bunch of dishes throughout the dinner. We are all curious to see!First up, there were two soup options available - Mashaba soup and a house soup of red lentils and coriander. I went with the Mushaba. Composed of noodles, vegetables, ground beef, yogourt and fresh coriander, it was a nice way to start things off. A very hearty soup - tons of flavour through both the dark broth as well as the plentiful veggies and noodles.I had one starter as well - the eggplant borani. Consisting of fried eggplant slices topped with tomato sauce and garlic yogourt, the texture wasn't necessarily as crispy as I was hoping but the flavour was all there. Lovely mixture of the sweet tomato sauce, the cool garlicky yogourt and spices overtop brought tons of levels to the party.Ashak was my main of choice - Steamed pastas stuffed with leak, served with tomato sauce, ground beef and garlic yogourt. Again, I wasn't totally happy with the texture of the pasta - steamed but too soft and a little watery underneath - but flavour-wise, this was an excellent dish. The leak stuffing had a nice touch and kept the dish feeling light. Once again, the combination of the tomato sauce, yogourt and beef provided a nice addition and there was a healthy amount of rice and vegetables provided as well.Among the other mains I tried, there was the Teka Kebab - filet mignon brochettes - which were nicely tender and flavourful. The Sabzi Chalaw - lamb shank with spinach - was a lovely cooking display of the lamb. Fall off the bone with that lovely lamb gaminess, the spinach didn't feel super necessary but it was delicious nevertheless. The last main was the Kofta Chalaw - beef meats balls in tomato sauce with afghan spices. A weirdly Italian dish to me but the addition of the middle Eastern spices provided just enough of a change-up to not make me wonder why I was not in a trattoria at that moment. All of these were served with the same amount of rice and vegetables as I got with my main so portion-wise, we all got our money's worth.The last item for the night was our complimentary dessert of rose water pudding with pistachios. Now... I am not a fan of rose water as I have found that typically it is overused and just destroys any dish with its overtly flowery tones. However, in this case, count me as surprised to find that it was pretty good. Weirdly though, the entire table felt the pudding tasted like Fruit Loops! I guess I should check what goes into Fruit Loops. Anyway, texture was excellent on top of being a weird flashback to my childhood!Khyber Pass was a very pleasant surprise - huge flavours and nice portions all around. The decor feels pretty hokey to me but I get it and frankly if the food is still enjoyable, I can look past it. Add the BYOW element - and believe me we did - and you have an excellent option for a relatively reasonable night out. Khyber Pass... you showed me what Afghan food was and I am happier for it.Cheers!"

When we arrived almost 30 min earlier, they graciously seated us. The vibe out in the terrace was great - lots of big groups and given the bring your own wine environment, people definitely seemed to be enjoying themselves. Menu can be a la carte or 2 combination options. We opted for the 4 course which included a choice of soup or salad, appetizer, entree, and finished with desert + tea all for something like $32! What a deal. I had the soup with noodles, fried eggplant, and lamb leg with spices. Everything was delicious and the portions are huge. I ate the entire lamb leg but definitely was not able to finish the rice. Service was fast and friendly. Left feeling happily full and a bit tipsy :) Though I usually don't eat a lot of heavy meats like this, I am definitely looking forward to our next Montreal visit to stop here."

Really friendly service, relaxed atmosphere, and situated on a cool part of Duluth by the park. As a group we tried a whole variety of starters, soups and mains, and everything was really lovely and unique. The red lentil soup, sambossa (filled pastries), spiced pumpkin starter, main lamb dish with raisins, that I ordered were all really good. And the various rices were also especially yummy. Really chill night with, again, great friendly service. It's BYOW too. Recommended."
/user_details?userid=1V7883W5i_F3mptabTXFIw,Sarah S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Was recommended by an Afghani friend to try this place out. It didn't disappoint. Four of us went for dinner and all of our dishes were amazing. Their meat is tender and seasoned to perfection. I forgot what I took because I remembered the name of the dish I want to take next time, that's the dish my boyfriend had:  chicken pulao. It's like an Afghan take on biryani with their own spices (which are quite different from the Indian spice cabinet). The rice was the show stopper, overflowing with flavour and the right kind of consistency, not too sticky not too dry. Portions are huge, worth the $25(avg) you're gonna pay there. Their ambience is also pretty chill and really good for having a special dinner out and at the same time not getting too fancy. The only reason I gave them a 4star instead of 5 is because their dishes were pretty high on sodium (doesn't mean it's salty, the taste is amazing) and we felt bloated till the next day."

Mobin was cold and dry; he looked like someone had forced him to work there, even though he said he was the manager. We ordered our dinner, and Mobin suggested we were ordering too much food ?! We asked him to bring our order anyway. At the end, he brought us Ferni (dessert) which was very nice of him, however, my Ferni spoon had a piece of wet food stuck to it :( Asked for another spoon, but then the Ferni was old and tasted sour! Also with the business they have, it's not cool to mix the liquid soap with a lot of water in the bathroom."

Went with 3 friends, native from Montreal, St Louis, Durbin S.A. and me from Seattle. We all had lamb shank prepared two different ways. The owners son was our waiter, very knowledgeable about the menu. We let him pick out appetizers, the flavors were incredible, shank fell apart on the plate. Best part, you can bring your own bottle of wine, actually, have to bring your own if you want any. Old zoning laws, makes for a relatively cheap night out. I highly recommend this restaurant."

/user_details?userid=qkJtn0Rtz_lKlTs5azBkng,Doug S.,"Austin, TX",3 star rating,"It was my first visit to Montreal so I was quite excited when I discovered this place while conducting some pre trip internet research. I leapt at the opportunity to try Afghani food as this is not something available in any sense in central Texas. That said, I'll be the first one to question the validity of my assessment. To start, the place has a streamlined if not limited selection. That is not to say that any of it was bad but but I'll explain that later. The menu basically gives you two prefixe options with the primary difference being the addition of an appetizer. I decided to go all the way since the $4 price difference seemed negligible and included coffee. I started with the Mashaba, a warm soup that was perfect for the cold night.  It was certainly tasty, but essentially a pretty standard beef broth and vegetable deal. At the server's somewhat unenthusiastic recommendation I went with the Mantoo for my second course.  I'm surprised he wasn't more excited because the delicate little dumplings with mild yogurt and tomato sauces were really very nice. Much better then the seemingly more popular yet comparatively boring Sambossas and probably the best thing I had.  For the main dish I followed the crowd and ordered the lamb shank with brown basmati and raisins.  All in all the dish was very tasty, the meat well prepared and and the rice not overly salty. But somehow it lacked a certain je ne sais quoi I was hoping for in terms of spice. In total it was very difficult to decide whether to rate this place as a three or a four.  The service was efficient but not spectacular and the food was good, just not amazing. All in all just good."
/user_details?userid=1652MDlbA0pOtsq7U1Ygow,Clayton V.,"Redmond, WA",4 star rating,"Fantastically Authentic. Bring your own wine.Khyber Pass has wonderfully authentic cuisine. A bit cramped inside, and busy nearly nightly. Even for 7pm on a Tuesday there was a crowd, reservations are a good idea here. Despite that though, it's quite quiet inside and you never feel like you're sharing your table with your neighbors elbows.The food is comforting and warm. My dining companion and I both opt'd the Table D'Hote #2. Her the soup Mashaba, myself the Maison. The Maison was a well spiced, filling, and warming red lentil dish. For mains, I had the Ashak, a Afghani dumpling, filled with beef, leak, topped with garlic yogurt and tomato sauce, all this served on three styles of rice. Savory and filling, the pasta shell delicate and thin. My companion ordered the lamb chalaw, a fall off the bone lamb shank, with rice and raisins, be warned, it is a bit sweet for the unsuspecting.Dessert, a rice pudding flavored with rose water was a nice finish. It's short a star as the kitchen is a bit slow, but not obnoxiously slow. That said, this is by far my favorite location in Montreal for Middle Eastern Cuisine. If you're going to be in the neighborhood, and are looking for something to try, this is certainly worth it."
/user_details?userid=1FAKs3CAQQLBgdB23GeDIQ,Amador A.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,"Soo soo good. What brought us to this establishment is their outside decor and what a good decision we made. In the back there is outdoor seating and inside is very cozy and homey. This is the first time trying Afghani food and it was very good. Most of their menu consist of kebab and lamb. Both my girlfriend and I had two different varieties of lamb. Mine was a leg of lamb which fell right off of the bone and my girlfriend had lamb in sauce which came with 3 different types of rice. Very good Just some advise get here about 30min before they close at 10p because we were not able to order the combo deals because either they did not have what we wanted or 2 the chefs wanted to leave so they did not make it for us. Even because of that I still give this place 5 stars because the service was good and even though they did not give us what we wanted they gave us an additional 15% off the bill. One last thing, the prices here are very accommodating and will not take a lot from your wallet but add a lot to your stomach."

I have since been back to the restaurant many times and it has become one of our regular spots. The atmosphere is nice and intimate and very cozy and the food never disappoints. I have at time ventured away from the table d'hôte but very rarely as you really can't go wrong with that great deal. I won't bother listing all the great items on the menu but I will say that the afghan dumplings are fantastic as well as the lamb shank and the meat balls. They also have a Lentil soup that is a great start to the meal especially on a nice crisp winter day.Service is always very friendly and often comes with a little comedic relief.A great place that has something for everyone.

It started out fine, our waiter wasn't particularly friendly but the ambiance was very cool. We each ordered the four course table d'hote. We each tried one of the soups which were both actually really good so we were excited for our mains. Our appetizers were bland; I chose the Mantoo too which was overcooked and bland. He had to eggplant which was just a soggy mess.  My date chose the first lamb with raisins option and I went with the lamb with spinach. While the meat was tender, it was honestly disgusting. His had barely any taste and mine was just gross. The dessert at the end I actually really enjoyed. Sweet and flavorful. Unfortunately, it didn't save the meal.Overall, super over-rated. The ambiance is original but for the price, the food was horrendous. The best part was the soup, pudding dessert and the fact that we could bring our own wine.

First of all, who would expect to find Afghan food in Quebcoise country? Here's why I was recommend you try this place.Amazing Location: We sort of stumbled upon it as we were exploring the Plateau neighbourhood (possibly my favorite part of the city). If you're a tourist (like we were), I definitely recommend going up to Mount Royal to get an eagle eye view of the city, then walking around the Plateau neighbourhood. There are a ton of really cute restaurants, bars, boutiques to keep you busy.BYOB: There's a SAQ on the main street (2 blocks from the restaurant). So you can pick up some wine to enjoy with your meal. Yayy! Ambiance/Outdoor seating: The restaurant itself has a really cute patio (or as the people of monreal like to call it, terrace) , decorated in Afgani fashion. It's very romantic but also great for groups of people. Food: I think the biggest win is that you can find something that appeals to vegetarians and meatlovers alike. The vegetarian combo plate was plentiful and enough to share among two people. My friend tried the lamb kababs and said it was possibly the best he'd ever had.Service was attentive. But one star off because the waiter insisted on being snobby and speaking in french - even though his english was perfectly fluent and he knew that not everyone on the table was from quebec. Ahh well. All in all, if you are looking for a delightful evening dinner and want to exeperience Afghan cuisine, then you should definietely give this place a shot."

/user_details?userid=7kGxOoefe5H-HMxKIS9QrQ,Ahmad H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Khyber pass is situated in the chic Mont-Royal neighborhood of Montreal: not very far from the metro station of the same name (10-15 minutes from metro to the restaurant on foot). It's a good restaurant in a nice neighborhood with a nice traditional Afghan decor. I'd recommend a reservation before you go there since this restaurant is almost always bustling with foodies and tourists alike. The food is pretty good too. It's a BYOB restaurant so overall you won't end up paying more than $30 per person (taxes, tips, coffee/tea, entree, dessert included). I've been to a lot of Afghani restaurants in my life and this one comes pretty close to being authentic. Their speciality is lamb/mutton. Order lamb tikka (BBQ mutton cubes) or kebab, it would be served with plain rice or salad and some daal on the side. Their lamb BBQ, in one word, is ""succulent"". Not spicy, not overdone, not leathery, just ""succulent"". I was a little bit disappointed with the portion size (in fact I asked for more rice to eat with daal  just to have my fill) since the lamb tikka portion, while being delicious, isn't enough for one person. The dessert section also needs to be improved. They haven't got many items on it and once again the portions are ridiculously small. You can finish your dinner with green cardamom tea which is very good. Remember though that they won't let you stay in the restaurant for more than an hour if there's a reservation after you. So sometimes the servers can be very matter-of-factly and curt. I'd recommend a reservation around 9:30 and since there won't be any reservation after you,(generally not many people reserve a table after 10:30)  you could enjoy your table till around 11:30."

My only complaint, which is a big one and occurred during my second visit, is about the rude waitress. As we were heading out of the place after we paid, the waitress looked at the tip that we left and asked us to leave more next time because of taxes and other expenses. If there is anything I hate, it is when waitresses stop me before I leave the restaurant and give me a lecture about the tip and how much I should leave. Clearly, this waitress had no idea what customer service is since she was EXTREMELY rude. Will not come back. Also, the tables are too close to each other and it was a little uncomfortable."

If you miss the first wave, you head on in for the second wave. Meals are relaxed and food is served with impeccable timing (always a big plus as far as I'm concerned). Definitely a stand-out restaurant in the heart of the Plateau, where great restaurants proliferate."

The food is pretty good, but I don't feel drawn to it more than that.A couple years ago they decided to do a revamp their exterior finish. I can tell you that they basically covered the old crusty façade with a series of wooden boards. Now, it's the inside it needs a bit of a facelift. The old chairs and tables and carpets could use some replacing.The best kept secret about this restaurant is the Terrasse in the back. Unless you know it's there, you would never tell by standing on the street.This is a fairly inexpensive restaurant. Which is also helped by the fact that it's bring your own wine. My suggestion... Go in the summer and sit on the terrace. I think you'll be pleasantly pleased."

You can choose from either two table d'hote or a la carte.  I went with the table d'hote where you get a choice of a soup or salad, appetizer, main dish and dessert and then a choice of either coffee or tea.The cucumber salad was a good choice, however if you get the lamb with your main dish, it will come with the salad anyways.  The sambossa is a good choice for your appetizer.  it definitely is fried goodness.The lamb is pretty good and it is hard to get good lamb in Montreal.  However, I am not a fan of rose water, thus not a big fan of the dessert here.As for the decor, it definitely needs to get with the times.  Outdated to say the least."

We were a group of 4 people and we stuffed in a little corner at the back of the resto. I was a bit skeptical at first (the decor seems a bit out-dated) but once I took my first bite of stuffed pasta and filet mignon, everything else was no longer an issue. The food was fantastic. The waiter not so much but the flavors of my dish made up for it. I can't wait to go back"

We were a party of four and each ordered something different so that we could share and try all the different flavours. The only reason I'm not rating it with 5 stars is because it was crowded and quite noisy, but I'll definitely be back and recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious meal."

/user_details?userid=M6Y2TxQZyXsUJdRhXjDBCw,Conrad B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We wanted to try something different in Montreal so we booked a table at the Khyber Pass. Not having tried Afghani food before we were a little apprehensive. The restaurant is small and booking is essential but the ambiance is wonderful. The food was probably one of the best meals we have ever had. The soup was incredible, and the kebabs and lamb were tender, flavorsome and not overly spiced. If you like your meat to taste like meat then this is the place. Oh, if we could only eat there every day!!"
/user_details?userid=T40u1FJXOOYs3rmOnwGm6A,Kiera S.,"London, United Kingdom",3 star rating,"Went here the other night, and it was ok. The Mashaba soup was a highlight - very fresh and especially great if you like coriander. I had the vegetarian combo, which was decent overall. I liked that the three different colours of rice were actually distinct from one another in flavour - not just visually. My favourite part of the main plate was actually a kind of onion-type (I think??) salad which I think probably comes on the side of most plates. The rose water pudding is a nice dessert. There is a lot of food, so definitely go hungry.My dining partner, usually a huge fan of lamb, wasn't super happy with his korma chalaw. And while MY meal was generally ok, this is not my favourite Afghan restaurant in Montreal, so I wouldn't bother going back. I should also note that this place can get ridiculously noisy, which can be a but off-putting if you happen to get squished between rowdy groups...Ps. Staff is friendly."

/user_details?userid=wQLqTg9_f9KxV4yr_I0JYA,Brian C.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Khyber Pass is just OK. Nothing special except for the large terrace which made the overall experience pleasant on a very hot summer night.  As for the food its the usual kebab house fare. We had starter of sliced eggplant and yogurt sauce and a stuffed pastry of leek and lamb that was somewhere between a samosa and an empanada which was very tasty.The mains of grilled quails and lamb chowla were a little disappointing. The gimmick here is to fill you up on rice; the plates were full of three varieties which basically tasted the same. They are a little skimpy with the protein items. $80 bucks for two including tax and tip is too pricey for this type of food. I know BYOB  is a Montreal tradition, but, you are not really saving anything by going here. So next time I will pass on Khyber Pass."
/user_details?userid=WCHArapR0ZhduJElR9axjA,Farin I.,"Calgary, Canada",3 star rating,"Wow, I was really unpleased with my last two visits. Unfortunately the portion size of my favorite dal soup from here just keeps getting smaller each time I visit. I dont care if they are having problems in the back, I dont mind paying a few extra for a big bowl (admins over there please note :) ) Also, my last korma chicken was just not something I was used to from what I have from  here. Given the fact that yes I was with a big family group, and yes we were one of the last folks that night in, but still while the rest of the table was served with awesome food, my korma chicken was just not cooked enough. While I requested to get another one I could tell the chicken was not simmered in the curry well enough to get the full flavor. With that being said, I will still go back to this place with just less of the enthusiasm then before. But hopefully theres still hope :)"

/user_details?userid=DW8SPSNRRCRtX3SVJ673JA,Amanda J.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Some of the food was very good; it was a bit on the pricey side compared the other BYOBs on the same street. I didn't care for the breads and dips; the tea was very low quality an bland; the pistachio cream dessert didn't carry much pistachios and the flavours didn't come through. The only good thing was the entree. My friend and I saw how big the portions were so we wanted to share a table d'hote (3 course meal) for $27. Unfortunately, the waitress told us that we had to order a minimum of 2 main dishes even though it would be an overload of food. I disliked this policy and I have never heard of this in any restaurant in Montreal. I have lived here for 10 years. To try a bit of everything, we order 1 table d'hote and 1 entree. Our main dishes were the lamb shank ($23) and the meatballs and rice ($19). To give you an idea, the meatballs came with 3 servings of different coloured rice. Do they carbo-load or something? Our meals came out to around $40 including taxes and tip. It was quite expensive since we didn't get to order what we wanted. We ordered what we HAD to in order to stay at the restaurant. We took home 60% of the food. This was ridiculous because if we were not going home right after, we would end up carrying 2 lbs of leftovers around until the end of the night or sadly wasting the food because we were not allowed to order the portion that we wished.  2 things to keep in mind: 1) BYOB (SAQ is very closeby if you forget)2) You must order at least 1 main dish per person so be prepared to carry leftovers!"

We didnt have a reservation, and the upstairs section was all full. So, they sent us to the 2nd section in the basement. I was kinda glad that we got sent there. It looked like we were in some sort of cave carved out of stone. It was really warm and cozy in there. The food was amazing as well. The portion were huge. The chicken was juicy and tender and lamb was falling off of the bones. the only negative was that we were forced to take one main dish per person because we brought in our own wine. At least they didnt charge any corking fees."

The service is friendly and the food... absolutely delicious! I have quite a bit of Afghan food - Khyber Pass has a more high end feel bringing this often overlooked delicious cuisine to a more mainstream audience. I highly recommended this restaurant - I could eat the veggie platter and house lentil soup every day!

Its the only one I know in the city, so I dont have the best reference point, but I really liked it. The food was delicious but took forever to prepare. It wasn't crowded at all and it still took 45min to get our food. I tried their lamb with palao rice, and my friend had the chicken palao, and both dishes were great. I didn't really like the appetizers they gave us, the dips were bland and bread wasn't fresh, but it was complementary and we didnt pay for it so I didnt mind. It was a little pricy as well, but it was worth! I definitely recommend them."

/user_details?userid=Dd-TkEszFMkSF-vRih51fQ,Holly T.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"I didn't think I'd go all the way to Montreal to try Afghan food, but as it turned out we finally did get full of all the rich French food we had been eating and needed something different on our last night in town. This place had caught our eye several times as we had been walking to Au Pied de Cochon. It turned out great, as it was inexpensive and friendly, and the food was good. We all got one of the table d'hôte options for about $25, including soup, appetizer, main course, dessert, and coffee/tea. I started with the Mashaba soup, which included noodles, vegetables, ground beef, yogurt, and coriander. Very delicious. For my appetizer, I got the Ashak, which was small boiled pastas stuffed with chopped leek and served with mint yogurt and ground beef tomato sauce. This was good but a bit heavy after the soup; I preferred the pumpkin borani that my brother ordered (my husband got the eggplant borani but he wolfed it all down before I got the chance to try it myself). For my main course I got the Korma Chalaw, a trio of basmati rice served with lamb chunks cooked in tomato sauce. The lamb was nice and tender, but I was so full at this point. My brother got the Vegetarian Combo of spinach, cauliflower, gumbo, turnip, and eggplants, which I wish I had ordered instead. The dessert was rose water pudding sprinkled with pistachio nuts, which was excellent. I got coffee and my brother got a tasty cardamon tea. We loved all the flavors in the food, especially the strong presence of cardamon in everything. It was a BYOY (bring your own wine) place; we were a little wined out so we didn't bring any, but there is a SAQ just on the corner where you can pick up some wine to bring to dinner here. Overall a solid restaurant, we enjoyed it."
