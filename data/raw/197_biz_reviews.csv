I got fooled by the calamari tacos. Those were good. The California burrito was really satisfying to eat and I'd definitely go back for more of those. Shout out to that day's cashier for the poblano soup, my girlfriend and I loved it. To be honest, that is one of the best soup I've had from a restaurant. You can really taste the ingredients in it. It also has a kick so be warned. The slap from the poblano was nice though.Overall, lovely restaurant. Would go back."

How could I resist? Le mariachi is a hidden jewel next to the Jean Talon market and owned by none other than Montreal's Masterchef star Dino ""Babydoll"" Luciano. I don't have much to say other than go and try absolutely everything you can off the menu and do it fast because everything sells out fast!"
