I came for French toast on a weekday morning and the place was packed, but I was seated quickly. Ordering at the counter was fine, and they brought out the food and coffee quickly. French toast was amazing and very filling, quite sweet though. The fruit was fresh and delicious. The coffee was good. They use Union Coffee beans which I like. The second time I went was in the evening for a Belgian dark hot chocolate. It was very rich and tasty. I love the atmosphere in St-Barth's. Big windows, plants, good service and overall very chill."
/user_details?userid=D0Caw5JJXmQQ5luhH7ZvxQ,Carolyn B.,"Cincinnati, OH",5 star rating,"We tried this place out on the last day in Montreal.  Everything came out quickly and made to order hot!  I liked all the plants there although they are up so high that I can't figure out how they water them.  They were even starting out some geraniums inside on the windows.  It was only early March!  All the food was colorful, garnished and so scrumptious!  The wait staff was friendly, helpful and did not hover.  Again, we were surprised by the amazing fruit bowls as sides.  I don't think I've hardly seen anything like it in the south - which is what they call the US!  lol! Would definitely go back!"
/user_details?userid=bJ32xwAQaXASObzHznNTaQ,Chris C.,"San Francisco, CA",1 star rating,-- 'specially' managed by a brittle neurotic who imposes his personal 'exclusive' choices on who gets to be a customer.-- some of the staff are civil.-- others take their cue from the 'manager' and are very comfortable treating customers with cold disdain.-- coffee and food are good.-- but god help you if you have an issue: you will instantly be branded a 'problem' and told: 'leave if you don't like it'.-- especially if one of the 'manager's' 'special' friends doesn't like the way you dress.-- a pot of neurosis with everyone a captive audience for the 'manager'.
/user_details?userid=yERJfPKhhU49aJAJ6DvqEg,Sian D.,"Kirkland, Canada",5 star rating,"Such a cute cafe. The plants and decor make the interior very appealing and the relaxing vibe makes it a perfect place for McGill students to study. They have delicious scones (which are really big!) and their teas are good (although I've never had a bad tea in my life). Also, I made the awesome discovery this summer that they serve full breakfast meals. I got the eggs benedict and it was delishhh. Literally no complaints. The staff are super friendly, the food is yummy, and the atmosphere is exactly what I need when I'm looking for a place to study that isn't as drab as the library."

/user_details?userid=YUlBxBTPMPM3mawg4Opuvw,Haque I.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,It's a nice little cafe ideal for students looking for a study space. The best thing about this cafe is it's full of natural light during the day and if it's snowy day you get to see surreal view from inside. I always get latte here and it's awesome! If I have to compare the coffee/ tea beverages in this cafe and the Milton B which is just opposite to this cafe I would give this cafe 80/100 and Milton B 30/100. I initially went to Milton B for studying since it's bigger in size but then when I realized I can get a real quality latte for the same price here I switched! Would highly recommend! Wish it was 24/7 like Milton B
/user_details?userid=4mdqmMVV1ZIAobvRbF7X1A,Alex G.,"San Francisco, CA",3 star rating,"Vegan-friendly breakfast cafe. We had the muslix (you can switch honey to maple syrup) and a wild berry smoothie bowl with sliced almond, peanut butter and berry topping (they also have chia seed topping). They have soy, almond and oat milks available. Both times we came here there was also a vegan oatmeal cookie and date square available.Looking at the rest of the menu there is an Avocado Toast but which comes with egg. You could probably leave off the egg but it would be great if they would just make that option vegan as they have many other egg options.Nice place to hang out. Also the servers were very up on what was vegan and one of them was actually vegan."
/user_details?userid=AiVvH0_pXq7y-OJBgyWhdg,Tally C.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4 star rating,For a study cafe they do an amazing breakfast! It can be hard to find a table but once you do you're set. You order at the front and they serve you. The lattes here are also so tasty and refreshing. Way better than Milton B which is across the street.
/user_details?userid=sfecp5OqIPl0t2o8V4gAbQ,Bella C.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We just had a run in the morning and wanted to have a brunch. Near the Provigo, we found this cafe. the brunch is ok, with tea or coffee free. i've ordered a plate with avocado and my friend ordered Energie with lots of vegetables. Coffee is free but only black coffee, I've no idea if we could change coffee or need to pay extra fees, but if we can choose that will be super! The brunch is ok i like the avocado. For a femme is enough, bit for a men you need something with at least 2 or three eggs or something more. Nice waiter"

/user_details?userid=AeKmWgcq6OtBVIPjCJh3TA,Cynthia W.,"Drexel Hill, PA",5 star rating,"I had a delicious breakfast here during my visit in Montreal. I had an Omelet with spinach, salmon and avocado with toast and fruit and a hazelnut latte. The hazelnut latte was so good that I ordered one to go before I left. The staff were nice and everything arrived quickly."
/user_details?userid=-gSZ0MdnRicUFJq3RxO5Jw,Brittany A.,"Hattiesburg, MS",5 star rating,"THE BEST BREAKFAST IN MONTREAL! We came on vacation looking for a nice please to have breakfast. Yall, this place is amazing! The French toast is literally the best thing I've ever eaten in my entire life! Staff was friendly and it's the cutest little cafe. If we ever visit MTL again, we're definitely coming back here!"
/user_details?userid=g1Dj3bFHjmnxp1UJcw7Xpw,Lisa R.,"State College, PA",5 star rating,"Awesome breakfast cafe! During our short stay in Montreal, we ate breakfast here 3 times. We ordered the ham and cheese omelette, the breakfast bagel, and the waffles. The food was great and I especially liked the side of fresh fruit served with the meals. Great atmosphere, too!"
/user_details?userid=uRo6FPta4tSYUFFAxAKuDA,Noa F.,"Byward Market - Parliament Hill, Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,I love it to study until my mind can't take it anymore. Love their cookies that they will warm up for you as well as their ice lattes.
/user_details?userid=6inp_uq9MAvjQzfHBMRVsQ,Michael T.,"Honolulu, HI",5 star rating,Walked up Parc looking for...THIS PLACE!  Amazing game bright cheery ambiance.  Homemade everything.  The pastries were outstanding.  When I ordered a juice I did not expect 6 large oranges to be fresh squeezed.  Fabulous!
/user_details?userid=ax2MkevxSI2W89tqutcYng,Carla M.,"Yonkers, NY",5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I stood at an Airbnb near here and decided to look for places to eat. We stumbled upon this cute cafe on the corner of du Parc and Milton. The interior gives me European/French vibes and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I myself work at a coffee shop and the service and menu reminded me so much of my cafe. We ended up getting 3 eggs, choice of bacon or sausage, fruit salad, potatoes, toast and coffee for only $11 and it was delicious!!!! The only thing I didn't enjoy was the  drip coffee, it just wasn't good but I am bias since I am familiar with good coffee. It came with the dish so hey, why not ? ."
