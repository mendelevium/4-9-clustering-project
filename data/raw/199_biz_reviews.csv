/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"First in-restaurant dinner for us since the COVID shutdown, and it was wonderful. We went there last night for our anniversary, and had pretty much the place to ourselves, as we booked for 6 PM (a bit early than most people). The dining room felt very cozy, with muted lights and windows, dark walls and furniture. There was a mix of elegance (e.g. bespoke lights, tableware, leather chairs), charm (e.g. camouflage netting to mask a doorway), and eclecticism (e.g. art with integrated pulsing lights). Service was pleasant, impeccable and very attentive from beginning to end. We decided to have all of the evening menu, starting from a pair of oysters. They were served on a small bed of salt, with some crème fraîche, a sea buckthorn berry and a chamomille jelly. The resulting taste was very fresh yet creamy and rich from the liver mousse-like taste of the oyster. The first course was even better, with the hamachi crudo, which was beautifully displayed with shiitake, miso, etc. The flavors were very japanese, bold and harmonious. The scallops were seared on one side, golden like tangerines, and smelled like only freshly seared seafood can. The second course was heavier, especially with the risotto. The rice was perfectly cooked, with each translucent grain still showing at bit of its heart. The flavor was very rich, especially with the shaved frozen foie gras, which added an interesting contrast in temperature. The risotto got quite salty toward the second half (something I also experienced at Club Chasse et Pêche's sibling Le Filet...). The fish was halibut, which was mild in flavor, and paired with arroche, an interesting veg I rarely see. The third course continued to be good. The wagyu and lobster shone by themselved on a bed of creamy polenta, and although the acidic flavors of the gribiche were a bit aggressive, they nicely paired with the sweetbread. Desserts were very pretty and uncomplicated. The maple parfait was rich, balanced by the tartness of the red fruits. The mille-feuille-shaped cheesecake was light and refreshing, particularly with the layer of rhubarb. My favorite part was the decorative (Lemon Gem?) marigold, which had a beautiful citrus flavor.It was lovely dinner, very well paced. It took us around 1h30 overall. I felt full, but not bloated. The only bémol was that I was sitting close to the air conditioning and almost got a tummy ache from the cold air (stepping out into the hot summer evening after solved the problem)."

Was on a trip to Montreal and this place came as a recommended from a friend. The entry to this place is in an alley so super secretive and once you walk in, it's a very intimate dinner setting. We reserved ahead of time and were seated at the bar. The sommelier helped us to find a proper wine pairing for our meal.For appetizer, got the seared scallops-so fresh and slightly sweet.Entree, we got the surf and turf which is steak and lobster, it was so pretty and very yummy. This is a must get.The desserts were also very well-done as expected for a good French restaurant. If you're making a trip to Montreal this place is definitely a place you should not pass on, it's definitely a treat but well worth it."

The dishes were very flavorful. I highly recommend trying out their ""risotto au cochonnet braisé"", the foie gras just melts in your mouth, full of flavor!I suggest you take their wine pairing for the night menu. The waiters and waitress are very knowledgeable if you want a recommendation."

From the minute I walked into the place until the end everything was top notch!I could go into details about the ambiance, service, plating and food but rather keep this one short and real with saying it was 10/10.Amazing...Stop thinking about it and just go.....I will be coming back on every visit to Montreal which is at least 3 times a year.Until the next time..... stay classy folks and see you soon :)"

It's a great location on a little side street in old Montréal.  Same quirky and charming decor.  When it first opened, someone described it as ""David Lynch's rec room"" and I always thought that was particularly apt.  Service was competent and welcoming as always. The menu hasn't changed a lot in the years, and I was a little underwhelmed with this visit.  Nothing really wrong with anything, but I think there are just so many new sexy places in Montreal now that are doing more creative things for similar price points.  I had the octopus to start which was fresh and nicely cooked but slightly bland.  Similar experience with the duck, nothing really wrong with it but no wow factor to the dish.  Dessert was probably the star of the show, a beautiful caramel and chocolate confection that tasted as good as it looked. The waiter gave very good wine recommendations.  It's still a very solid choice for dinner but I feel as though the menu could do with a revamp at this point."

The food was very good. The portions are small but the seafood was really fresh. The food was very sharable. We ordered the fish, scallops and tartar. All of it was prepared really well.  Service was excellent."
/user_details?userid=jpF5VxuG9moPTZzDfAPuSA,Tram L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is known as one of the classics in Montreal and I finally got to try it last week. Took my friend here for his birthday and we were not disappointed! The ambience is nice, very classy, the old school restaurant with music not too loud but it is there enough to provide a background. It smelled delicious when we walked in, too so that was very promising from the start. The staff is very professional, curteous and knew exactly what they were doing at all times. They knew exactly how to be subtle in certain moments during dinner as well which was amazing.We ordered a bottle from their extensive list of deliciousness. We got a few plates, all to share:-scallops-the chasse et peche which was veal sweetbread & lobster-the veggie dish-the wagyu-the halcyon for dessertand in a very classy fashion, the kitchen split everything up into 2 plates for us (Bonus!!!!) EVERYTHING was delicious and very well prepared. They definitely keep up with their reputation :)"
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been to this restaurant a couple of times before. I recently took my boyfriend there for his birthday. This restaurant has never failed me!I always start with a bloody Caesar cocktail when I go to a restaurant but I wouldn't recommend them here because they are just normal, nothing special Caesars. However, this time the waiter made my boyfriend's Caesar stronger than usual without charging for a double which was very much appreciated. This was followed by two different glasses of imported wine each and they were both so good and paired beautifully with the meal. We got two appetizers and two mains which we planned on sharing so the waitress asked the kitchen to split each dish into two separate plates so it was like we had our own tasting menu with dishes we chose ourselves. We started with the Hamachi tartare which was recommended to us by the waitress. It was light and fresh. It had cherry tomatoes and was served with a sesame cracker. I love tartare in general and this one was very good. We shared the braised piglet risotto with foie gras shavings on top. This was my favorite dish of the night! Even though it was split in two it was still a pretty good sized dish.  Usually risotto is a hit or miss for me. I find it is usually either over cooked or under cooked. This risotto was cooked to perfection!For mains we shared the forest pig with gnocchi and the chasse et peche (AKA surf and turf). Both dishes were good. The chasse et peche consisted of pieces of steak, a lobster tail and pasta with basil.  For dessert we had the cheesecake but it wasn't your typical cheesecake because there was no graham cracker crust. There was a blackcurrant sorbet on top. The dessert was light and not too sweet. They wrote ""bonne fete"" (i.e. Happy Birthday) on the cake. They don't have candles. I definitely recommend this restaurant. The food and the service is great! Doesn't disappoint!"
/user_details?userid=IEArDnkiSCqWVWXMbjGDVA,Diamondz W.,"Houston, TX",5 star rating,Omg. This is the best meal that I had in Montreal. The wine selection was excellent. All the dishes were super delicious and creative. I would definitely make another trip to Montreal to eat here again. The service was also top notch.
/user_details?userid=kQk7tG4W7jApLDyFjl1fgQ,Louis H.,"Atlanta, GA",5 star rating,"Everything you should expect from a nice night out on Historic Montreal. Helen was very knowledgeable about the menu and charming - even chased after us to give me the phone I forgot on the table.I'm a big fan of hole in the wall and cheap eats but this place was worth the price tag. It was really nice to taste a lot of new complex flavors.It was just as good if not better than any meals we had in Paris. The duck beast is from free specially range ducks that also provide foie gras. AMAZING. 5 stars Fish slow cooked in olive oil - served with fish roe, dill, (US quarter sized) pancakes and a few other roots/veggies I cant describe. 4 stars Scallop appetizer - it was good but nothing to write home about. However, I am biased and when it comes to sea scallops (my favorite food) I believe less is more - just pan sear or slice them raw and let the natural flavor do it's thing. 3.5 starsOctupus appetizer - the meat falls apart in your mouth but for squid/octopus I prefer that slight snap when you bite into it. The sauces and garnishes really upped the game on this dish for me. 4 stars.The ambiance and Helen's engaging and witty company and service made this a top notch experience."

We don't speak French and asked our server to just bring us his favorites. It was all beyond good, and I'm not sure what the hell the dessert was, but holy shit, best I've EVER had."
/user_details?userid=qdU1O2_ERYJlk6zAlR5kkw,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"TL;DR: Great food, fantastic ambiance, but experience was soured by the service.Secured prime time Friday night reservations weeks in advance for a birthday dinner. The decor is dark, classy, and romantic. Like a sexy hunting lodge? We started off with two Old Fashioneds, which were very spirit forward. Way more than I'm used to. The waiter actually noticed by the end of our (very, very long) meal that I barely drank mine, and comped the drink, which was a nice touch.For food, we split several dishes including the oysters (""Oysters with Charisma"") which were prepared in three ways, seared scallops, braised piglet risotto, seared foie gras, halibut with black rice risotto, American wagyu, and maple syrup parfait. They actually split all of the appetizers and entrees into plates, so it felt like a mini tasting menu.Standouts for me included the risotto, foie, and halibut. Suckling pig risotto was super rich, but saved from textural and flavor monotony by chunks of pork, foie gras shavings, and some fruit. The black rice risotto that came with the halibut was the stuff that dreams are made of. And I don't usually like foie, but theirs was perfectly seared and paired extremely well with buckwheat bread and dried stone fruits.Would not order the cooked oysters or wagyu again (former came in a very unpleasant sauce, and the latter was actually overcooked with a very large gray ring).Service was probably the most disappointing part of the meal. It was a bit ominous when we walked in and the host couldn't find our reservation (but the maitre d' was able to see it at a glance). At one point in our meal, it seemed like they had actually forgotten about us, and we waited 40+ minutes for the wagyu course, which came out slightly warm and overcooked. And as I mentioned previously, while it was a nice touch that they comped my drink, this came at about three hours into the meal (and well after the aforementioned wagyu incident). Water glasses also sat unfilled for rather long periods of time. Cautious 4 stars for the service at this price point, but it's probably some of the best food in town."

My family and I came here during our trip to Montreal and we were very happy with our choice.The place is tastefully hidden on a dimly lit street with barely any sign or notice that the restaurant is even there. It's different, almost as if you know the location of a secret club (which I thought was incredibly cool).The wait staff here is polite and attentive as they should be.Even before getting our appetizers I was impressed with the attention to detail of the restaurant. Everyone's bread was. positioned in the exact same way and had the same sized pieces. These are the little details that I think make an expensive restaurant worth its valueI ended up ordering the fish with the rabbit as an appetizer. The rabbit was delicious! Im not exactly sure what was on it (apples and some sort of grain...maybe quinoa?), but the seasoning was great. The fish was well cooked although it could have used a bit more seasoning (the rice and vegetables had most of the flavor)."
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Despite my best efforts, there are still numerous Montreal staples that I have yet to try. Be it for lack of occasion or honestly just forgetting about them, some restaurants have been continuously on my to-try list for years and years. Le Club Chasse et Pêche has been one such place. The old Montreal staple run by Claude Pelletier, long lauded for the quality of their work since 2004, has weirdly never been one that I would think about when looking for a high end restaurant for an occasion. Well, thankfully that was fixed for me as a friend of mine decided to have his birthday dinner take place there so I finally got to see if all the praise was justified.Located very unassumingly on a side street in the Old Montreal, Le Club Chasse et Pêche has a somewhat weird visual motif to me. Given the age of the building, they highlight some of its classic features - beautiful old stone walls and archways -  in the periphery but the rest of the space is a mix of more modern touches - dark printed pattern wallpaper on the ceiling, black accent walls with a flat concrete-like finish, modernistic artwork, curved plastered walls which orient and separate the room in ways to make things feel more intimate but also weirdly disorienting. It works with the low lighting to create a very intimate ambience perfect for the type of special occasions that bring you to a place like this but personally not the type of style I enjoy.The menu is not big but frankly everything on the page sounded amazing. As a starter, I went with the crispy veal sweetbread served with a soubise sauce, comté, mustard and hazelnuts. I love sweetbreads so even though the rest of the items listed seemed like a weird mixture, I felt this dish call to me. It was superb - the sweetbread was cooked to perfection - juicy and tender but with a great exterior crunch. The onion sauce had a nice balance of sweetness and creaminess and the other elements worked well even if adding cheese, mustard and nuts to this would seem odd. Just trust me.The other starter I got to try through an exchange with the birthday boy was THE Club Chasse et Pêche classic starter - the braised piglet risotto topped with foie gras shavings. Holy cow did this dish not disappoint. My friend called it the best risotto he has ever had and I would agree. The risotto itself is cooked nicely - a touch firm but still very tender and the flavours are out of this world - the mixture of the pork and the rich foie gras made this so decadent but so powerful. Definitely a dish not to miss when you go!As a main dish, after much MUCH deliberation, I went with their version of the surf and turf, Le Chasse et Pêche, the component of which change regularly. On this occasion, it was buttery lobster and 30 day aged steak. Excellent preparation of both elements. The lobster was all rich and buttery goodness. The steak was seared perfectly and very tender. An excellent surf and turf.As a dessert, I decided to go with their Bomb - a caramel and milk chocolate tartelette served with an 80% chocolate sorbet. I loved the tarte - flaky and crisp with a great rich caramel flavour. Honestly I didn't like the sorbet - it felt too watery to me which gave us less impact than it should have. A minor quibble in a great meal.Le Club Chasse et Pêche was a great experience and worth the wait. The food was exquisite - our entire table left the dinner very full and satisfied. It may be easily missed when you walk around Old Montreal but believe it, it is definitely worth your attention. Don't wait as long as I did.Cheers!"

The scallops were cooked perfectly. The halibut it was a dream. The service was amazing the inside was comfortable and cozy and inviting. I totally would suggest if you are ever in old Montreal you definitely put this on one of your restaurants to check out.
/user_details?userid=V-xZ1I8NJJvmIpkXdaffFw,Brittany G.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"Le Club Chasse et Peche was the quintessential Old Montreal restaurant to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. The ambiance was dark yet warm and romantic. The inside was old and made you feel like you were back in the 17th century. We started with the famous piglet risotto which was a smart choice. It was very rich, had wonderful chunks of pulled pork and frozen cherries that add unique texture and helps cut the rich heaviness. I would split this dish   and they did split the bowl so it was easy to share. I had the lamb which was delicious and nicely cooked (medium rare). I really enjoyed the accompaniments (pine nuts, cauliflower, etc.)My boyfriend had the surf and turf special which was lobster and veal filet mignon. It was of course amazing and the sauce was divine. The only reason I did not give 5 starts was the portion size of the surf and turf. It was gone in under 5 minutes. For small portions they do give you endless bread which was nice.Thanks for the amazing meal and service was 5 stars!"
/user_details?userid=GX6YV2sORHR7tOma3mcYfw,Ocean N.,"San Francisco, CA",3 star rating,"It's difficult for me to understand the love for this place. The dishes all had issues and were quite traditional, except for the duck. The venison was cut too thick and the sauce was old as time, a red wine reduction. The piglet risotto was overly salted and unnecessarily rich, wrong proportion of meat to risotto. The scallop- their signature dish- was lovely but they didn't seem freshly seared nor was the sauce warm. The octopus was the only dish I would order again. My kids loved the guinea fowl with plum, as well as the desserts. I found the desserts have fancy names for the marketing aspect but actually they're quite traditional and overly sweet, with the exception of the Rosa. The atmosphere is a dressed-up dingy basement."

To start we had a mix of oysters which is a staple to start a great meal. We then had our entrees deer and octopus. I've never had deer and it was soooooo good. It was crispy and a little bit salty on the outside and the meet was amazing. The octopus was really good too but the deer was much better! For the main course I had the Kobe beef and lobster which was incredible. However, once again my boyfriend picked the better tasting meal which was boar and wow I was blown away at how juicy and good it was.The desert was unique but didn't enjoy it as much.Really loved the customs ginger vodka drink I had as well!

A quick google search led us to this restaurant which showed up on most top lists and so my boyfriend quickly gave them a call. Although he called at around 6pm, we were still able to get a reservation for 9pm of the same night. Getting to the restaurant is quite simple, it's located near the Old Port and it has a nice exterior. We ordered some drinks -- a French martini for me as recommended by our excellent server! For appetizers we both decided to go for the piglet risotto which was extremely flavourful, rich and cooked just right (no soggy risotto for me!). For our main courses my boyfriend chose the wagyu, while I opted for the lamb chops. Both were cooked to the right temperature and like the risotto, both dishes were very good! While I can't speak so much for the American wagyu as I only had a couple bites, I can tell you that the lamb chops were juicy and tender and that the other  ingredients (especially the figs which had a nice cinnamon taste) really complimented the dish well. We decided to share a dessert and we chose the chocolate and caramel tart. The presentation for this was beautiful, although we both found the contrast between the extremely sweet caramel and the dark chocolate ice cream a bit too much, we still enjoyed it.I can't end this review without speaking about the service! It's impeccable, they were all very friendly and helpful when we needed suggestions. You wouldn't need to ask them to refill your water, they're just that attentive! This restaurant was the perfect way to start our trip, a restaurant with great ambience and great food."

I ordered the surf and turf which that night was half a lobster on top of a 75 day aged filet of veal. Both were cooked perfectly and it was a perfect entree. I finished with the bomb dessert.

I am very much a down-home kind of guy when it comes to restaurants; not junk food, but not Michelin star, you know what I mean? Having said that, a wedding gift brought us here on a Saturday night. The service is impeccable; neither snooty nor impersonal. I could tell the staff knew we were punching above our weight but they made us feel welcome and explained everything on the menu while offering great suggestions, even recommending nice wine-by-the-glass pairings for each of my wife's courses, which she loved. I started with the venison, which was the first time for me. It was the highlight of the whole meal. I've got the taste for wild game now. Then I had the rack of lamb, which was great but the venison still won out. My wife had the seared scallops followed by the actual chasse et peche plate, which was Kobe skirt steak and a half lobster. It was pretty incredible. Dessert was ok; nothing to write home about, but a nice way to end the evening. All in all, I wouldn't come here on my own dime; I don't know if it was truly worth the $300+ bill with tip for two people, but it was a good experience, especially the great service. And that venison!"

We got trout and cod which was perfectly cooked. Beautiful presentation to boot. We started with oysters which were great and then shared a wonderful refined tuna tartare plate. But my favourite part of this restaurant is the ambiance. It's got that old school feeling. Low-lit, low-ceilings, stone walls and big leather chairs which the waiters graciously pull out for you to sit. They also take your jackets when you come in. The waiters are attentive and always make sure you have a drink.Chasse et Peche is the definition of classy. It's a breath of fresh air when so many other special occasion type restaurants in town will happily toss you a bill for hundreds of dollars at the end of the night without creating an environment to relax and unwind so you can actually enjoy the food and company."

With dark walls and old brick columns, the restaurant had a man-cave vibe that contributed to the congenial and boisterous atmosphere. There was the pleasant undercurrent that shows up right before the holidays.While the menu was fairly limited, every item sounded terrific so it took a while for us to make our final selections. We shared the piglet risotto which we were told it was a customer favorite. The dish was well-prepared and flavorful - just not to my taste.As entrée, I had the duck breast, which was perfectly prepared and served at the right temperature with thinly-sliced root parsley, small onions, in a wonderful sauce. I also loved the two small crispy morsels of duck, in a confit preparation. I usually don't comment on this aspect of a meal but the presentation was lovely.Dessert was also incredible. The chocolate tart had a shortbread crust and a flowing caramel interior. The 80% chocolate sorbet mellowed the sweetness of the tart.Service was outstanding."

/user_details?userid=Hib9c10vUQWvNpmysW_c0A,Victoria X.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,"In summary - Le Club Chasse et Pêche delivers in contemporary upscale French cuisine!Set in the Old Port in a robust old stone building with no signs and no windows, this place isn't easy to find. Standing in front of it, you almost wonder if there is actually any sign of life inside. However, once you step inside, you immediately feel like you've just joined an exclusive yet very lively sort of men's club. Low ceilings and leather trimmings, you'd almost expect the hostess to hand you a glass of whiskey and a box of cigars. However, she instead gracefully hands you a menu where, as the name of the restaurant suggests, meat and fish are the star.Reading along the menu, you get a sense that dishes are imaginative as they pair french classics with modern ingredients. We started our experience with an appetizer of boar and lobster ravioli. The boar was delicious as it had crispy skin and perfectly rendered fat. The lobster was very rich in flavour but more ravioli than lobster. We followed with the piglet risotto topped with shavings of foie gras. The description in itself says it all. It was richness on top of richness but worth every minute spent on the treadmill as the flavours just exploded in your mouth. Apparently this dish has been on their menu since the opening, they are unable to take it off as it's just that good!For mains we opted for the duck and the venison. Again very creative dishes as both proteins were prepared two ways. The duck was served as a magret and as a duck heart salad while the venison was served as a tenderloin as well as a 'pulled pork style' shredded venison. Both dishes were beautifully executed, perfectly cooked and very tasty. However, they were not the best duck or venison we've ever had. The duck had a somewhat teriyaki flair and the shredded venison had a bit too much bbq sauce to fully appreciate the meat.As for the service, it was very professional but lacked that spark that in our minds would have made it exceptional.Overall, this is a solid place to impress a date or anyone worth impressing. Although you probably won't have a mind blowing foodie experience, you can definitely expect to have consistently delicious food served in a intimate and exclusive 'club like' setting."

The scallops were a bit small for the price but we're very tasty. The foie gras was excellent too! For the main dishes, we've ordered the Chasse et Peche (lobster and steak) and my hubby loved it! I've ordered the catch of the day which was the halibut and it was perfectly cooked. As desserts, we had the ""bombe"" and  the ""haute couture"". Both desserts were good, but I preferred the haute couture (cuz I love hazelnut).Service was not especially friendly or personalized, very standard. As for the price, it's quite expensive and portions were small. This is why I'm giving it 4 stars."

The mise en place and decor is wonderful.  5 people, we ordered 5 appetizers with the goal of sharing and each of us a main.  The menu had some nice specials (not written) like Lobster and Sweetbreads. The dishes are very well presented, but lack that something to remember them.  The food is excellently executed visually, but it's prettier than tastier.  The service is where this restaurant breaks it for me.  On a 700 dollars ticket, our waiter announces in the midst of our mains that ""his shift is over and he is going to leave"".  The service, which had been sub par until then, becomes desertification.  Nobody pours a glass of wine. Nobody cares for the seniors at the table and serves them some water.  I have to stand up and ask the one waitress to be served properly, and she is arrogantly annoyed that I am calling out their lack of preparation and respond to my face ""yes..I am going to be there"" with an underlying tone of fuck you in her voice.  I liked their food but their incompetent management of the front of the house makes this a place that doesn't deserve a come back."

The presentation could possibly have been more attractive, but in all, there was nothing to complain about with this meal from savory start to sweet finish. The recommended wine was a perfect choice based on our food selection - kudos to our waiter for his suggestion of an organic French Pinot Noir, delicate but delicious. Thanks as well for the gratis taste of a plum brandy after the meal - a very nice and unexpected surprise that added another great taste to the experience.The music was perfect and added to the overall vibe - dub and trip hop - lending a somewhat dreamy atmosphere to the windowless but cozy den of a dining room.I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for excellent food in an unorthodox but comfortable and easy-to-enjoy space."

Fantastic romantic atmosphere as well dark setting very intimate small dining room and incredibly attentive service. Very low background music with eclectic beats helps drown out other tables conversationsTheir house specialty Rizzo to appetizer was out of this world and better den all risottos I've had in New York City. Specifically the use of ultra sharp aged cheddar along with frozen fois gras and al dente grains made a fantastic combination.  The other appetizer that we had was their grilled octopus season with Mediterranean and middle eastern spices cooked to perfection. The main courses were also delicious. The duck was as good as any that I've had however the hell with that had a beautiful crust but was slightly dehydrated tutu to focus on creating this beautiful golden crust. The wine selection on the bottle side was absolutely fantastic however somewhat wanting on wine by the glass side.

Fine dining vibes without being too pretentious. Service was definitely a highlight. Our server explained the entire menu in great detail and was very attentive. We started with oysters and tried two of each kind--all were delicious. For the main, I couldn't resist the ""Chasse et Peche"" after hearing the waiter describe it.

The experience starts right as you enter the restaurant--it's beautiful. Dim lighting and has an old town lux feel. The host took our coats and we were led to our table. The ambiance of the restaurant was very romantic and high class, without feeling pretentious. Our server was pleasant and was knowledgeable about wines (for me) and the couple old fashioneds my husband ordered were on point and strong. We splurged a little on the menu because so many items were appealing. We ordered the foie gras appetizer, légumes avec panache (squash was the vegetable of the day), and I had the canard (duck) and husband ordered the pork loin. Each item was superb! The foie gras was generous and paired with light citrus flavors of pear and beets. The squash dish was meant to be our healthier vegetable side, but when they say panache--they meant panache! It was mixed in with butter and creams and baked in the skin and then topped with cheese. Very rich, but of course still outstanding. As for our entrees, they were cooked to perfection. My duck was a delicious cut of meat, and cooked pink so that it was tender but with a crisp to the seared skin. My husband's pork loin was equally perfect. Our only regret of the night was that we didn't have enough room for dessert!Definitely one of my favorite meals in Montreal, and hope to dine here again in future trips."

With great music and dark walls and decor features, the space felt immediately welcoming and exciting.Here in low season, we were given a lucky break, as we were able to score a table on the same day we dined. We started out with the venison and the scallops. The venison was so tender, with a perfect sear and an immaculate flavor. The berries on the side were just magnificent. The scallops, although not great in quantity, were perfectly cooked. The lemon sauce, drizzled over the top, really complimented the flavor of the scallop. I wanted more! Our dinner entrees were the lamb, again, cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection and the boar, an unexpectedly tender delight, on a bed of walnuts and oh, that puree!!!! For dessert, we chose Strates and Venus. The richness of the raspberry compote, paired with the caramel flavors of Strates really got us going, whereas the calmer, refined taste of the pistachio cake in Venus, coupled with the delicate flavor of rosewater syrup and the sweetness of the lychee sorbet, made me feel happy to be alive. The staff was amazing throughout this experience. Everyone was so professional and adorable and were were welcomed from start to finish. It was worth every penny to me. I cannot wait to return."

My feelings echo a lot of the other reviewers' in that the food was essentially flawless and that the piglet risotto was the best dish -  the foie gras shavings melted and completed the dish perfectly. I will say that although the scallops were good, we could've done without them. The Chasse et peche (we got lobster & steak) was cooked well but the $62 price tag hurt a bit. I got the Bombe for dessert and the chocolate-caramel tart was extremely sweet but it was offset nicely by the dark chocolate sorbet. I also tried a bit of the Aurora and the yogurt sorbet, apricots, and caramel cake were nice and refreshing. Props to the servers for the unpretentious service and accommodating us by splitting all the dishes for us (all pictures show half portion sizes except for the scallops and desserts).

Each of these dishes was phenomenal and super perfect.We each ordered our own entree. I ordered a delicious pairing of venison two ways, one filet was grilled rare and the other was slow roasted into a rendered and tendered set of bites from heaven. The meet was served with a wild berry reduction. The berries and cabbage did much to balance and complement the richness of the meat. Erin ordered a magnet duck breast served with a confit duck leg.That was quite a bit of food, but as we still had wine we ordered a cheese plate of three cheeses served at exactly the right temperature to enjoy. Sadly I can't remember the names of the cheese, I'll have to call for future reference. The first cheese was a salty blue cheese from France. The second was a thin slice of a hearty cows milk cheese from France. The final was a soft in texture and flavor goat cheese from Canada."

If I had to compare it to any other Michelin-rated resto, I'd say it bears similarity to David Kinch's now 3-starred Manresa, but to be quite honest I like Le Club Chasse et Pêche a bit better. The ambience: It's dark, it's sexy, it's the perfect precursor to getting lucky. Wine, dine, sixty-nine might as well be their unofficial motto. Think Hugh Hefner's infamous cave grotto but with far less silicone and a different kind of Frenching. The service: It's dark, It's sexy (the overarching theme in this narrative), it's possibly the best service I've experienced anywhere and while I'm not exactly an expert to the Michelin life, I'm no stranger either and Le Club Chasse et Pêche is paramount when it comes to their staff. The food & drink: Dark & sexy wins again. I stuck to red wine while my party of diners seemed to hit the Bourbon and Scotch hard. The menu for both beverage and bites was impressive and vast and I appreciated the special attention to detail from Le Club Chasse et Pêche in putting together a special vegetarian dining menu for myself and a few others in our party. I recommend calling ahead, having a reservation, mentioning your dietary restrictions and just knowing that they'll go above and beyond to accommodate you. Our dinner consisted of 5 exquisite courses. I was slightly jealous of the meat-eaters hamachi crudo over the vegetarian composed salad of figs, Mozzarella di Buffalonne, and black walnut but my dish was delicious nonetheless. The fritto misto with guacamole and nastrutum was one I picked around only because I'm slightly detest tempura anything but the following course of a vegetarian risotto, chanterelle and hedgehog mushrooms was perhaps the best dish of the night. I had to slow myself while eating it in an attempt to appear more human than animal. The spelt flour pappardelle with bell pepper, zucchini, and tomato was perfect, though I began to fill up and wasn't able to finish the entire dish (now one of my biggest regrets). It was filling, hearty, flavorful and reminded me of a less creamy stroganoff, which remains one of my most missed dishes as a non-meat eater. Dessert was (of course) spectacular and spectacularly Canadian. A maple syrup parfait with dark chocolate and red berry compote. I died a little bit in the best way. I don't know how often I'll be in Montreal but when the time comes I'll be sure to book my reservation at Le Club Chasse et Pêche."

That is the only reason I'm giving 4 not 5 stars. Overall the food and service was wonderful. We started with the piglet risotto and the grilled octopus. The risotto was a heavier dish but very good! Loved the octopus, it was grilled perfectly. I then had the Ocean Delivery main course- it was a trout filet cooked similar to the texture of warm sushi. That may sound weird but it was so good. The sauce and vegetables paired perfectly with it! My husband had the halibut. Another rich dish and very filling but he enjoyed every bite!

It comes with a yummy crispy wonton that you have to budget with each bite so that you can make it last as long as possible. Lamb ribs ($69)We opted for the special of the night, the lamb ribs. We asked to share the plate and they portioned the meal into two plates for us. And of course, like everything else we experienced in the restaurant the lamb was spectacular. Juicy and wonderful. I made reservations easily through opentable weeks in advance. However, its important to note that they need a confirmation by 5pm on the day of the reservation. So for the traveler without a working mobile remember to call from your hotel room or have he concierge make the confirmation and not run around Old Montreal looking for a pay phone to confirm your reservations."
/user_details?userid=hCTRibdps0KBw2E581MW7A,Nikos L.,"Plymouth, MA",5 star rating,Excellent food and service.  A Montreal classic that never disappoints.  The lamb is to die for and so are the choices of fish.  A great wine list is coupled with a great selection of deserts.  Highly recommend when in Montreal Old Port.

The piglet risotto with foie gras shavings was incredible and the venison entree was the best dish I've ever had in my life. It was cooked perfectly on the rare side and all the accompaniments were perfect- braised baby Brussels sprouts, tender gnocchi, and the sauces- just unbelievably good.We definitely splurged on this dinner reservation, but it was worth every penny. We tried out other places we saw, which were endorsed by travel and food shows, but this place blew them out of the water. Save your money and don't waste your time- just come here."

The ambiance, the old world charm and the staff are all lovely, but the only thing that has me wanting to come back are the oysters, nothing else knocked my socks off. We have so many amazing restaurants in Montreal that I was expecting more I guess, but this place seems to really cater to tourists and snotty business groups trying to impress clients.My fish dish was so very salty thanks to the sauce they put on it, I could barely finish it and we had to order more water. The desserts were ok, again, nothing special. Nice wine list, especially if you like French reds, but unless dinner is on someone else's tab, I don't think I'll be coming back as I've given it 2 tries now and left with the same impression."

This place is truly a gem in Montreal, and is the highlight of my visit to this city. I placed my trust in Yelp to find me an authentic, sophisticated French restaurant with amazing food and hospitality. Yelp did not disappoint.To start off, making a reservation was not difficult and I was able to book the exact time that I wanted. When I called to let them know I was arriving late, they were super accommodating and assured me that everything would be okay. When I arrived, I was seated right away and the entire restaurant was welcoming.Our server recommended a great wine for us to start off the night. Then he explained the menu thoroughly, which was very helpful because all the French dishes can get confusing sometimes. He was very down to earth during the process, so nothing pretentious there. We made our choices and ordered the following: hamachi tartare, niçoise, olives oysters with charismacod, fingerling, smoked mackerel, romanesco, cippolini The oysters were fresh with a delicious, light sauce that highlighted the oyster's flavor. The cod was perfectly seasoned and melted in my mouth. I was 100% satisfied for our meal.All the waiters and servers were super friendly and genuinely made me feel welcomed. I would honestly come to Montreal just to dine here again."

It's very cozy, but also hard to hear anyone at your table. I wasn't expecting this.The food was very good and/but definitely on the heavy side - maybe this was partially due to our ordering, but we also found the portions to be very large. The pork risotto was so rich that we would have been happy to have shared a quarter of it, even without the foie gras, which felt over the top to me.But I really enjoyed the boar, which was sizable but NOT over the top. We asked for a wine pairing to encompass people who ordered boar as well as those who got fish, and were given a suitably subtle red, which was decent but not exciting. The desserts were more exciting, but overall we just weren't blown away."

It is rustic, dark, and the unmarked doors add a bit of mystery to the restaurant. The service was better than the other restaurants we went to in Montreal. Our server helped us pair wines with our dishes- his suggestions were great and really helped enhance our meal. Our favorite dish was the Piglet Risotto with frozen shaved foie gras. Absolute amazing. The foie gras melted in my mouth with each bite. We shared this appetizer, but I really wish I had the whole plate for myself. The piglet risotto was so flavorful. I got the boar entree- came with spinach and I think polenta. On top of the boar, there was a thick sauce with bleu cheese. The boar itself was cooked just right, easy to cut. My partner got the duck... I liked it less. The duck was a bit chewy and wasn't as flavorful. Still good, but if you had to choose, I'd get the boar every time. We shared a dessert. It wasn't as memorable, but light and not too sweet... great way to end the meal. The price was very reasonable. I would compare the food to a one or two Michelin star restaurant, but with one star or less pricing. The food is more comforting and hearty than innovative. I'd come back next time I'm in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=9Yk7wWuGLPJZ_9rfWlAnUA,Jaren D.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Quite possibly the best meal I've had in my life. So amazing that during a week trip to Montreal, we booked this place twice. Each time, we ordered 4 of their small plates and split a main course in order to sample as much of the menu as possible. As explained by our waiter, there are two dishes that cannot be removed from their menu, the braised piglet risotto and the seared scallops. We had each during both of our visits. The braised piglet risotto with foie gras shavings is incredible to the point that eating at Le Club Chasse and not having it should be a crime. Order it. You WILL NOT be disappointed. The seared scallops are amazing as well. Perfectly seared and caramelized on one side, with a savory lemon confit sauce. They have a notable wine list, and a sommelier on standby to help pair your meal with the perfect wine. Our waiter was attentive, polite, and extremely helpful in helping us explore their menu. He even took the time to write down a few of his favorite coffee shops, bars, and restaurants around town. While on the pricey side, Le Club Chasse is worth every penny. A calming ambience, unforgettable food, and great staff. I will stop by every time in Montreal. Highly recommend."

/user_details?userid=KwX0MJzE6yxNOdroV7RGfQ,Olivia L.,"White Plains, NY",3 star rating,Overrated place with sub par cooking techniques (all dishes very greasy) and even ingredients. The Kobe beef from the signature dish ($59) surf and turf is just so so and bit too salty and also not best cut. Raviolis in the dish tastes like medicine- when you think it's very hard to go wrong with Raviolis. Expected mine blowing quality food with the 4 star rating but got disappointed. The parfait dessert tastes nothing different than a Haagen das ice cream. Lacking sophistication in overall food quality- dispite the seemingly interesting and innovative presentation. Ambience is trendy and classic though in a basement in prime district.

I must say I was impressed with the food and the different flavors on one plate that happens to go perfectly together. Only problem with this restaurant is that the portions are miniature. What surprised me is that even though the portions were small somehow at the end of the dinner we were satisfied. We ordered the scallops ( 1 scallop per person)  and the tuna with sweetbreads for appetizer and for main course we shared the deer w gnocchi. We didn't order dessert but they surprised us with an ice cream and tart at the end! Love when this happens :)

The waiter was inexperienced, insecure and defensive. We ordered cocktails to start and went ahead and ordered appetizers, entree and a bottle of wine. We were brought our appetizers before we had enjoyed 1/2 our cocktails. So our appetizers were cold and unpleasant. I sent my risotto pork back half eaten. After drinks we had to ask for wine glasses and poured our own. The entrees took a full 30 minutes to arrive. We had the fish and the wagu steak. Of the two the wagu was tasty...more credit to the cut than the chef...hard to ruin a wagu. Fish room temp and flavorless poached in oil. Meal was $300. And the best part was the good bottle of wine.

/user_details?userid=UVxY0iyPaqY7s4BSFtt-xA,Wanugee N.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Le Club Chasse et Peche (literally, The Hunting and Fishing Club) is like a secret Speak Easy of yesteryear, with only a sign with their emblem and a street address, with no name announcing what lays inside the unassuming Tudor styled facade on the bottom floor of a multi-story building in old Montreal, not far from city hall. And like a Speak Easy club, inside lies a cave or cellar like chamber of rooms with low ceilings, brick construction, and dark paint covering the walls, with only highlight lighting resembling candles or torches in a medeival basement or monastery. In Le Club, discerning diners, foodies, business people and Quebecois dine alongside the corrupted politicians and Mafiosa that have made the tabloids a-chatter with pay-off scandals of recent news.The relaxed atmoshphere, paced professional service, and excuisitely delicious food make this a special dining destination in Montreal. We had a party of 9 for a business dinner after a long day of meetings. After a snail's paced start (I am not talking about L'escargot, but rather a slug's traveling speed) in which we were refilled water 3 times but not served bread or anything else until our wine was selected, things picked up very well into an enjoyable experience. After starting with a Pinot Noir from France in honor of our Pinot Noir gentleman wine maker from Oregon's famed Williamette Valley who graced our party, we finally had the limited menu handed out to us, and eventually read and explained to us, dish by dish by our servers.The menu for the day had perhaps half a dozen appetizers and about the same in main entrees. (See picture of menu for selections)Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their selected delicate combinations of flavors and eye appealling presentations of both the appetizers and entrees. The dessert and coffee was wonderful as well. The prices were not that unreasonable for the quality of the food, but expect to pay about $15 - $22 for appetizer plates and $35 plus et moins for most entrees, with special mains going up to $50. Parking is non-existent and on the streets of Montreal. There is a coat check room and a cute hostess to greet you. Waiter service was professional, but relaxed. The place doesn't have a stuffy bone in its body, so you can enjoy the good food without feeling like you are being graded on your dining etiquette.  We all enjoyed our meals and would certainly come back again for another chance to break bread for business or dine with our favorite somebodies."

The flavors of the chasse et peche were good but it didn't feel elegant.  The duck dish was just OK.  The garnishes seemed kind of thrown together and random.  For dessert we had the caramel cake with coffee cream.  I can't say we loved it but at least it looked nice on the plate.  Oh - and the draft beer was really stale.  I should know better than to order beer at a place like this, but it was 35C outside (random Montreal heat wave) and I needed something to quench my thirst.  Bad idea.  All in all, for what we paid we were really underwhelmed with the whole experience.  Maybe it's because we don't speak French??"
/user_details?userid=ZozeRlq1OuAl5uDg1cYIcA,David K.,"Ayer, MA",5 star rating,"Our evening here was outstanding in all respects. It was on the top of my list of dining possibilities for Montreal but we almost didn't go because wife was concerned it would be just too fancy for us and our touristy clothes. But on her afternoon stroll she stopped by and asked and they assured her we'd be fine. I'm not saying come in flip flops and a tee shirt - definitely don't - but men can get away with neat casual; jacket and tie definitely not required. Once inside we found all kinds of diners, from couples sharing a romantic dinner, to a group of 8 men out on a wine-tasting extravaganza, to a family of father, mother, and well-behaved child who it was apparent was thrilled to be there.I'm not sure of the origin of the name, which translates ""Hunting and Fishing Club"". The decor is funky but in an elegant way. It's dimly lit and almost all black: walls, ceilings, floor, even the tapestry on one wall, which is black with many contrasting shades of dark. I agree with other reviewers who likened the interior to a cave. But if so, it's a very beautiful cave, inviting not spooky, airy not musty.The menu is rather short. And descriptions are brief. But almost everything sounded intriguing and I knew I probably couldn't go wrong with any choice. But I had questions. Not to worry. The waitress proceeds to explain all the items in complete detail. This process took over 5 minutes - I'm not exaggerating. And for you English speakers (like ourselves) don't worry; they are all perfectly fluent in French and English (to the extent that I have no idea if our waitress was a native English speaker or French).Unfortunately for our decision making, her descriptions just intrigued me even more, making it even harder to make a decision. Everything sounded so good. We finally decided on the Arctic Char for me, and Venison Two Ways (tenderloin and short ribs) for her. We started with an appetizer of Waygu beef to share, and a tray of the house vegetables to accompany our meal.I won't attempt to describe any of these in detail. I could not do them justice, especially as it was several days ago and my memory of them is fading. But every dish excelled in every way: the taste, creativity, and presentation. I will say that my wife, not a fan of rare meat, especially game like venison, followed their recommendation to have it prepared as the chef intended (seared on one side, rare on the other). Something about the way that it was explained to her, and the restaurant's reputation, made her confident that she shouldn't second-guess the chef's decision here, and she was not disappointed; she finished every morsel (as did I).The wine list was huge; probably the largest I have ever seen. Of course, most of them were well out of our price range (they even had a few bottles in the multi-thousand dollar range!) We did order a bottle for around $50, which was pretty close to the low end, but was quite good to our amateur palettes. Don't worry about getting a ""corked"" bottle; the sommelier tastes it first! I have never seen this before and was a little surprised but he's an expert and I know he got less than 1/4 ounce of our bottle.Portions may be slightly on the small side, but were really more than adequate. I think we get used to the excessive portions that are often served, and are surprised when we finish everything without feeling uncomfortably stuffed and don't take anything home. And that means that we had room for dessert - one for each of us! Some sort of chocolate tart with chocolate sorbet for her, and a squash cake with ginger ice cream for me. Both amazing, the squash cake especially memorable."

/user_details?userid=AqD5aVrPDSn-ed-F7LBm9Q,Jay Z.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Although the name translates to ""The Hunting and Fishing Club"" there's no membership required to dine here. Don't tell your friends that though, as the experience is very much that of slipping into one of Montreal's old dining dens. While most restaurants in the Old Montreal section try to draw you in with large windows peering into their fancy spaces with mediocre food, you could quite easily miss the small sign next to the unassuming 18th century door that leads to Le Club. I'm guessing that's just the way they like it.Once inside, the old world experience continues with arched doorways leading to numerous small dining chambers. Ours was dimly lit with stone and darkly painted walls, about six tables and a bar featuring an exposed brick vaulted ceiling. The crowd was well-dressed with a reasonable mix of locals and tourist. Yet for a what is essentially a fancy French restaurant, Le Club manages not to be stuffy or pretentious.The food is rich and it helps if you are too (entrees are in the mid- to high- $30s), but it was consistently some of the best french cooking I have experienced. There was not one item I wouldn't order again, although every item on the smallish menu was intriguing in its own way. So if you're up for something fancier, don't waste your money on the many tourist traps in Old Town. Enjoy a real Old Montreal dining experience here you won't regret.Top Dishes:Braised Piglet Risotto: What's that you say? A pork risotto sounds too light to you. How about we top it with some crispy foie gras shavings then. God bless French Canadiens.Foie Gras: They love their foie in Montreal and they do seem to have some of the best stuff on the market. This one sits on a bed of vegetables and mushrooms including...wait for it...truffles. Continue your decadence with a plate of this.Suckling Pig: A perfect cut of pig, with a crisped outer layer of fat providing a bacony flavor to the tender chop within. As with every other dish, it needs a decadent topping and this time that topping is marrow. Fantastitique."

We ordered, we waited.  And we were rewarded with very good entrees and shared a desert..  My wild boar dish was probably the best meal I had in Montreal--a -substantial portion, yet refined flavors, delicate enough to bing out subtle textures of pasta,and kale and pancetta.. My dining partner had Arctic char, with similar conclusion---very nice preparation in a coconut reduction.  Not inexpensive--Wine glases start at $10 or so, although we both enjoyed a beer because after hours of walking around the Old City, we were in the mood for something refreshing.   Still, the meal ended up being abut $150 w/tip.  A nice experience, with a very responsive staff."

They also had a more generous portion.  The scallops appetizer was also excellent.  Fresh, seared, but not overdone.  The beef TaTaki was also superb.  Small pieces of extraordinary tender and flawless meat like a tartar, but larger.  We ordered another Foie Gras for dessert, really.  The other special restaurants that you must try are Bonaparte and Bouillon Bilk.  All three were terrific."

The restaurant is in the Old Port section of Montreal just one street east of Place Jacques Cartier so even before you arrive, the walk in the surrounding area is quite beautiful. We were greeted warmly at the door and continued to have above par service all night. This is a fine dining establishment and is on the more expensive side of dining out but the quality of food, service and ambience are enough to create an experience that justifies the money you are spending. We had oysters 3 ways, foie gras, chasse et peche (sweetbreads, lobster meat, over a lobster ravioli) and two different chocolate desserts. As well as some cheese after dinner to finish our wine. Everything was cooked to perfection and the flavours were all incredible even when I thought they might not be my favourite. Little touches like automatically splitting our four gras appetizer for us without having to ask and after overhearing is trying to decide between two desserts simply bringing both out to us (we had only ordered one of them) made this experience exceptional. Highly recommended to any and all."
/user_details?userid=kgvTkSGVXS78xypSG8o-Bw,Pascal T.,"North Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"I was less than impressed with the service at Club Chasse et Peche. I initially called twice and spoke to the Maitre D' about vegetarian options for me at the restaurant. Both times he sounded arrogant, unfriendly and seemed bothered that I was calling him. It didn't give me a good vibe but I figured perhaps he was busy or just having a couple of bad days. One thing it certainly did is that it didn't make me feel welcomed there at all.Onto the setting, our first impression of the restaurant itself was pleasant. It feels laid back, cozy and comfortable. As the name suggests, the setting gives you a feeling of exclusivity, privacy and while being high-end, not in the stuffy kind of way. This changed over the course of the evening as more and more of the older business crowd came in but that is to be expected on a Tuesday night. I'll start with the food as I have a lot less to say about that than the rest.. My entree was a polenta dish with mushrooms, onions and chestnuts. This was a very good dish. The polenta was perfectly done and the balance of flavors excellent. The onions were amazing.My main dish was disappointing. It was a couscous salad with veggies and some parsley. It was quite under-seasoned which is unacceptable from a restaurant of this caliber. It felt like something they put together at the last minute and lacked creativity and it certainly was not worth $27. Now I understand this restaurant is called ""Chasse et Peche"" and isn't a bastion of vegetarian-friendly dishes but it is disappointing when you present a very simple request to a kitchen presumably full of talent and you are given a mediocre and weak dish as a result. It clearly lacked flavor , even salt, and I am amazed if it would pass any sort of taste test before leaving any kitchen, let alone one at a high-end restaurant like this.Onto to the service where clearly, it is not in line with the price we paid that night. I'll only give you one example out of 3-4 other small things I noticed throughout the night, in the name of saving time and space:As soon as the waiter gave us the menus I told him I was vegetarian and he immediately pulled the menu off the table and disappeared for 5 minutes without saying why he left. He came back to take my wife's order and after said to me ""... and the gentleman here doesn't have a choice for tonight"" and left again. Even if the chef only offered him one choice it would have been nice to be told what I was going to eat and asked if this would be okay with me. Basic service and courtesy. These sort of things happened a handful of times during our dinner and while none of them were terrible, when I pay high-end prices I also expect high-end service to go with the food.Which brings me to the prices.. I don't mind paying a lot if I receive a lot as well but in this case it was clearly overpriced to me given both food and service felt short. I get it, it's in Old Port and it's fancy, but charging $8 for a bottle of soda water is not just expensive, it's a rip-off. Many restaurants give you water for free. To their credit, my wife's meal was pretty good even though the surf and turf was overpriced slightly, at least it was ""very good"" according to her.Overall I would give CCP a 3.75 star rating. On the plus side my wife's dinner was quite good and my appetizer was also good. However, it is hard to let go of under seasoned food and poor service when you pay these prices and for that reason the restaurant gets a ""meh"" from me and a very unlikely return customer. If you are vegetarian there are many better places who will give you an actual thought-out dish that will taste good and be creative and the staff won't make you feel like you are not welcomed."
/user_details?userid=9s4jIoa9eOIClgH9prt5Bw,AJ W.,"Sacramento, CA",3 star rating,"My wife and I found this restaurant on Trip Advisor. We were lucky enough to get a late reservation. We arrived about 10 minutes prior to our reservation, and they seated us. The ambiance was wonderful, and the staff was very friendly. There were so many wonderful things on the menu, that we ordered several appetizers and 2 entrees (so we could share). I had a salad come first and my wife the Foie Gras. The Foie Gras was probably the best I've had. I also had the Octopus, which was cooked amazingly well.After the first 3 dishes came out, it seemed to take quite a bit of time for our server to come around and check on us, as our drinks needed refilling. I got someone's attention, and they brought us over refills. More time went by (about 30 minutes), and I saw a table next to us get their entrees (I noticed this, because I ordered the Lamb Shank as well), and this party arrived at the restaurant 30 minutes after we had. I found the manager and informed him of this. I ended up requesting my bill, because by this time, we had been at the restaurant for well over 2 hours.Even though this was a hiccup in a wonderful evening, the manager was very accomodating and got us our check, and comp'ed us for one of the items. Perhaps my experience wasn't normal for them; and maybe they were busier than it appeared to me, however, I felt that if the servers would have informed us that certain things would take longer, give us a complimentary drink if there'a a problem in the kitchen, etc., I would have felt better about the evening. For the amount of money I was paying there, I think that would have been an easy solution. On the positive side, the food we did get was exquisite, and the ambiance was amazing. I do recommend this restaurant, I just hope the management is more resonsive to a situation before it develops into a problem."

Portion sizes are just perfect for a three course meal. I would highly recommend trying the risotto with foie gras shavings (a classic), the frito misto (seasonal appetizer) or the grilled octopus. The hamachi tartare was milder tasting than the other appetizers I tried and did not stand out as much. I wish I had the chance to try the scallops as it is also a classic that's been on the menu since day 1. For the main course, the duck magret is done to perfection, but it does have a bit of a gamier taste that took a few bites to get used to. My partner's suckling pig was so good I wish I had switched plates with him. As for desserts, the maple parfait was indulgingly sweet. Our entire party thought that the desserts were all too sweet for our palate, but I think that's just personal preference. Overall,we had a very pleasant and satisfying meal.

The lack of exposure was too much for me to handle--I had to go and see what it was about. It is in old Montreal, and upon entering, there are shoe racks on your left with old sneakers which kind of threw me off at first..but then I realized it went with the whole ""hunting and fishing club"" theme...the ambiance is fairly dark but cozy. If it was -50 outside, I'd long to be at this club. We got a great table at the corner and our waiter was super friendly and informative. He explained how all the dishes were cooked, with what ingredients etc. He was on top of his game. Great service. Food: I don't know what to say except incroyable!!!! I got the scallops as my appetizer which came in a lemon compote. They were the most incredible scallops, and I wish there had been more than four. I could have eaten 20 of them at once. For my main, I got the guinea hen which was incredibly cooked and so juicy and my bf got the signature club chasse et peche main. Esentially- kobe beef with lobster on top. (whoa!).I definitely recommend getting the vegetables side, as it comes with different condiments and some purees. Lastly, the desserts were OUT OF THIS WORLD. Presentation was beautiful, I had the yoghurt praline phyllo pastry one and my boyfriend had this beautiful hazelnut chocolate tart with ice cream on top.ah! Amazing. Definitely, one of or THE best restaurant in Montreal."

First the good....the service was impeccable, the waiters were very knowledgeable and professional. We had the foie gras for our app which was pretty amazing, but the meal went down from there. The surf and turf ($45) was mediocre at best, the lobster lacked taste and the filet was was nothing to write home about either. The hot and solid meal ($65) also failed to live up to, or even generate any hype. Perhaps it was my error in getting two predominantly beef entrees, but I could have gotten the same at the Outback. After hearing about all of the progress that Montreal has made in terms of it's restaurants, this first meal was a true disappointment.

This is not a typcial restaurant for such an occasion, however, being a lover of food I wanted to experience one of Montreal's better restaurants.The place did not dissapoint. The actual space was awesome, located in a stone building in the Old Montreal section of the city, it had a little bit of dungeon feel to it. Our server was great. Not only was she patient with us (which took a lot as most of the people at the table had been drinking for a little while prior to showing up for dinner), but she took the time to explain each dish on the menu. I started with the veal sweetbread, which was perfectly fried and came paired with a cold shrimp dish. For a main course, I had braised boar belly. It came in the braising liquid with apples and was excellent, it wasn't as fatty as I anticipated it to be (thinking along the lines of pork belly), and had a slightly gamey taste to it which I like. There was no dessert ordered after the meal, people instead chose to continue drinking their martinis and wine, etc. Other items ordered off the menu were oysters, risotto with roast suckling pig and foie gras shavings, and kobe beef wrapped in bacon paired with lobster. According to everyone at the table, all were excellent. And every other dish I sampled at the table was cooked perfectly.With tax and tip, and everyone chipping in to pay for the bachelor, dinner came to around $150 a person. That included martinis, beers, and several pricey bottles of wine. If you are ever in Montreal, I suggest you make a reservation for dinner at Le Club Chasse et Peche, it's worth the money."

I followed with a main course of the surf and turf, a perfectly prepared lobster claw ( shelled ) over a rare piece of beef tenderloin all on top of an artichoke purée that was heavenly. My wife's meal was a starter of seared scallops, very good but less interesting, followed by a seared cod and foie gras, that was also heavenly. We wrapped up the meal with a cheese plater picked by the waiter that was the perfect topper. Needless to say I do recommend the restaurant, but a warning, I found it a little expensive and I like expensive restaurants, it comes down to value, the venue is a little lacking for the price tag."

But the venison is so good with the chèvre and its layered on crispy crackers with a sort of pesto on the sides.  An awesome combination of flavors and textures and a great tribute to game in a very classical French presentation.  Exactly what I want in a restaurant in Montreal.For mains we had a fish and the bison.  The bison is unforgettable.  The fish was very good, again, with a great combination of textures and flavors (pistachios, artichoke, lemon).  But the bison with the leeks and mushrooms (chantrelles I think) was so good, I can't over emphasize what a great dish it is.  The place isn't cheap.  That meal I just described plus teas and 3 glasses of wine, (with two cocktails total) was about $250 at the end.  They do have an impressive wine list but again it is not cheap, bottles under $50 are few and far between.  The Chablis we had by the glass was $17.50 a glass."

The consistency was that of toro tuna sashimi. Really this is a must try. The risotto was quite good as well but kind of overshadowed by the venison, which was like I said, incredible.The entrees were good but not as good as the appetizers.

Located on a side street in the old quarter of Montreal. The interior is fairly dark and suitable for a romantic dinner or a quite dinner with friends. We felt very welcome upon arrival. Quick attention upon entry and quickly led to our table.As with many Quebec natives you should always attemp your greeting or pleasantries in french. Doing so, I believe, conveys respect and a willingness to integrate as much as possible. Many will recognize quickly if it is not your first language and will immediately switch to english. Such was the case with our waiter but the switch was accompanied by a slight sneer. And I swear he gave an ever-so-small upward turn of his nose.After greetings were exchanged he seemed to be interested in helping us understand the details of the menu (it was in english) and the specials. He was moderately engaged and we appreciated his knowledge. We thought we were off on a decent foot, but the 45 minute wait between app and entree, the 15 minute wait for my empty wine glass to be refilled was just unacceptable. Now, don't get me wrong. Both of my hands and arms work and I can pour a glass of wine. However, this is a very fine-dining restaurant. The wine I ordered was $150, they decanted it for me and even gave us noticably nicer glasses than several tables around us. At this price level one does not pour their own bottle. Attentiveness, without intrusiveness, should be the order of the day here (and included in the price).The food? It was very much above average. I had the appetizer of ""foie gras-duck sausage-apple pie."" The duck sausage was the size of a cocktail weiner a jtouch too dry for my liking but the foie? Amazing.My entree was a 6 ounce serving of Wagyu beef. As a general rule I don't order steak in a restaurant because it's too easy to buy a nice piece of meat and cook it yourself. This was an excepetion because it difficult to find Wagyu (or Kobe) beef in a retail butcher shop. The waiter informed me it was $15 an ounce and there was a 4 ounce minimum order. It was the best piece of steak I've ever had. For once I can actually say with a straight face, it was like butter. It was so good that I refused a piece of my wife's venison because I didn't want to disturb the flavor in my mouth and on my tounge from the beef.At this point we'd been sitting for 2.5 hours. Not an unusaully long time. Heck, I've sat at dinner for 5 hours and had no reason to complain because the company was wonderful AND so was the service. At some point in our meal our waiter just checked out. There seemed to be plelnty of other waiters so I don't believe they were short handed.We would have tried a dessert but became so disenchanted by the service and attitude that we left. Such a shame because the food was almost perfect."

/user_details?userid=Tj58A0_D-WsD-UirmpYSEQ,Jen C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Where or where do I begin with this place?  Well it is probably the most well known high end foodie restaurant in Montreal and rightfully so, because the food here is exceptional.  Not to mention this is kind of a who's who place to go in Montreal - just look around at the other tables and you will see dudes peacocking and ordering bottles upon bottles for their party.  The décor is pretty dope too - the feel of the place is dungeon like but also I would say decor-wise a modern twist on the 70s?  They have fringe lighting and quirky fixtures and statues all over the place, not to mention a pretty swanky playlist.  I don't have any other words to descibe it other than swanky; that pretty much sums it up.  Now onto the food...The ginger martini is a must try.  It's delicious, and if I had more time to drink cocktails, I would have ordered another one.  It is perfectly balanced cocktail, not too large or too strong but just the right size and flavor.  We started with the snow crab and braised piglet risotto, the former of which was light, refreshing, tasty; and the latter rich, heavy, and full of flavor.  We had the Julien Labet, Cote du Jura Fluer de savagnin ""en chalasse"" 2008 which went beautifully with the crab.  Two completely different dynamics but both great choices nonetheless.  For dinner I had the surf and turf; lobster which was expertly prepared and sirloin perfectly cooked with a nice red once you cut into it.  Basically there is so much flavor and complexity in all these dishes that my taste buds were doing backflips - they didn't know what hit them.  My husband got the bison special and I never thought a tough meat like that could taste so tender and rich.  It was much larger than my meal so be prepared for a larger portion; we probably could have split it.  I had the Italian wine by the glass - the Vignalta igt Veneto ""marrano"" 2006 since I like a more full bodied old world wine with steak; my husband had the Orben Rioja 2006 to go with the bison.  And the dessert was just as good!  We had the berries with cream and the house gave us a glass of sparkling rose - my favorite wine with dessert.  Now the blueberries in this dish were pretty amazing - so small but bursting with so much flavor, I've never had anything like it.  So rich and such a great end to a great meal.  Five stars all the way around."

Worth every penny.  The flavours are all so well balanced, always! Each dish is better than the next. A true culinary experience.  The wine list is fantastic as well.  The perfect place to celebrate with the one you love.  My husband and I love to go here to splurge on a fancy date night.  The service is also great, its like you think of something you need and they bring it, I swear! It's magic :)"

Expensive but a very good value for the quality of food in my opinion. Note for vegetarians, you need to ask for a separate menu. Higher mix of tourists than I like (I was one of them), but this didn't detract from the experience."
/user_details?userid=V9auwZv4HzIZ_z4PejFVjw,Laura R.,"Atlanta, GA",5 star rating,"Occasionally you walk away from a meal and look back on it as an experience, that's the category where this meal belongs. After wandering the cobbled roads of the old quarter, we made our group made our way to the restaurant for our reservation. The dimly lit interior and plush environment are fitting for the name. We were greeted warmly and made our way through 5 courses and several bottles of wine. I can't recall the names of the dishes but everything I sampled was wonderful."
/user_details?userid=qgw_zGjToVUPmedf9N6m1g,John G.,"Reno, NV",3 star rating,"Sorry to say I had a poor experience here. My starter and mains were quite good. The dessert however was a disaster. Poorly executed hockey puck frozen goat cheese concoction with fruits. I don't think it was meant to be served this way. Tasted like soap, left me a bad taste in my mouth and ruined what could have been an excellent meal. I don't think a restaurant of this quality should miss so badly with dessert. I also was put off by clients allowed to show up with t-shirts, flip flops and shorts for dinner. The restaurant should demand minimal standards. Maybe it really is a hunting and fishing club!"
/user_details?userid=UeIJBjaq9yMXW3VFrljxLA,Sarah E.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,Wow - what can I say about Le Club Chasse et Peche to give it the credit it deserves? We spent a romantic weekend in Montreal and had a fantastic dining experience there. The food was amazing - piglet risotto that had flakes of frozen fois gras on top that melted into the dish on your table for instance. The rabbit entree was superb. Not huge portions but each bite was so wonderful it was hard to imagine that anything in this earth could taste so delicious and perfect. This was probably THE best meal I have ever had and very much worth the steep price tag. The decor is hidden and romantic. Service is very high calibre. Definitely a place for a romantic rendez-vous.

/user_details?userid=5Fzp0cNq3xFpDjS3qBp_eA,Brenna G.,"Irvine, CA",4 star rating,"This is one of those places that is created especially for people on expense accounts... or Donald Trump and homies. The decor is my favorite part....half retro supper culb/half canadian hunting lodge, and located in the cobblestoned alleyways of Old Montreal. Tiny portions dictate that each person order starter, entree, and dessert.... I had the lobster with tuna tartare starter; my colleagues had the olive tapenade and goat cheese stuffed lamb with crab-stuffed zucchini flower. Service was fine, slightly cold, but that is not surprising. The food is good, but the ambiance is really the reason to go."
