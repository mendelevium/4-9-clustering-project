The service was great - my server was very attentive and checked in often. I was only there to try the Beef Tartar but she also made great recommendations.To start the escargot was delicious, good portion and yummy red pepper sauce. The Beef Tartar was my reason for visiting and I was not disappointed. Great portion but I did have to ask for more bread. Still feeling a bit hungry, I ordered the Warm Goat Cheese - nicely plated, very smooth and also came with a side salad. Great value will definitely look to come back in the summer to enjoy the patio. Worthwhile checking out if you're looking for good eats on a budget."
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If you're looking for hearty, unpretentious French food, stop here. You'll be fully satisfied with their fare.  We went for the lamb shank with mashed potatoes and the hangar steak with potatoes, mushroom and arugula salad and of course, for desert, a large portion of creme brulee. We went on a weekday night and it was quiet (this was pre-covid) and were seated at a cosy booth on the ground floor. We pretty much had the place to ourselves and enjoyed the romantic ambiance.  Great place for comfort French food!"
/user_details?userid=jDeGeFlTTY6C_m9fYVFMdg,Marilyn R.,"Fanwood, NJ",5 star rating,"Visited this cute little place when I was in Canada and definitely one of my top restaurants to revisit when I'm back in Montreal!My boyfriend and I wanted to try some French food while we were in Canada since it only seemed appropriate and boy oh boy was it so worthwhile. We made a reservation for the place but had arrived a bit early and the waiters were so kind to accommodate us since there weren't many people. Our waiter was very kind and patient with us since we had explained it was our first time there. He even took the time to recommend me 2 choices of wine to pair with my entree and you could tell he really wanted us to enjoy our dinner!The food: We ordered the French Onion Soup which  honestly I hate onions, I KNOW... BUT the flavor of the soup was so undeniably delicious. I did avoid the onions luckily enough my boyfriend enjoys them HAHA. For my entree, I ordered the Lamb shank which was 100x LEGIT FIRE! It came paired with carrots and mashed potatoes which was a match made in heaven for my lamb hands down. My boyfriend ordered the Duck Confit which was also SOO tasty and he did enjoy very much and was well seasoned too! We also took advantage of the Yelp Check-In offer which was a choice of dessert and we went with the Creme Brûlée which was the cherry on top of our lovely dinner! Definitely a 5/5 rating!"
/user_details?userid=M7vDDzoPNQDN2FdTcwCq4A,Eric W.,"Hartford, CT",5 star rating,"So this place came up as highly ranked among the best in Montreal so I made it a goal to eat here while on business. Here's how it went!Atmosphere/Appearance: Once parking on the street and turning the corner to see this beautiful, open courtyard lined with tables and chairs we were excited to have a seat to experience the real French style of dining outdoors! The cute restaurant is elongated with red paint for the top 2 floors and a bright yellow for the bottom. I couldn't tell you much of what the interior looked like since we were outside, but I can tell you that you walk right by the open kitchen where you can see the chefs work their magic as you make your way to the bathroom. I loved the way this place is setup and we were very thankful for the great weather.Service: Anne was taking great care of us while training a brand new young lady who was having her first day while we were there! I think her name started with a ""C"", but no matter, they were both awesome and paid a great deal of attention to us. I hope the new girl is doing well!Food: So... they had an appetizer special of the day, frog legs. I had never had them before in my life and have heard the ""they taste like chicken"" thing way too many times so it was time to settle this! I ordered them and they were actually delicious. They're quite fatty, but flavorful. There isn't much mean on the bones, you know... it's a frog, but it was good and it did resemble chicken. For my entree I went with the Braised Lamb Shank. It consists of the shank, mashed potatoes, roasted carrots, then drizzled with homemade BBQ Sauce all inside a cast iron ""tub"". It was FABULOUS. The meat fell off the bone of course and was so freaking tasty. I was very happy with my meal.Value: This place isn't cheap. In my travels I've found that many French-based restaurants aren't cheap at all. Lol. All prices are in CAD$. My appetizer was a special so it surprisingly only $12.00. Imagine that. Lol. However, my lamb shank was $27.00. Totally worth the money.In conclusion, I loved this place and truly felt like I COULD HAVE had this very same experience in France. One day I'll get there and can confirm this! Lol. Check this place out if you can."
/user_details?userid=366hA3qywcaiC2njOF1AYQ,Sunny L.,"San Bernardino, CA",4 star rating,"A lovely atmosphere and a fine place to eat.  We sat outside during the summer near the fountain and the walk way.  Towards the end of dinner, a band came and started playing some songs.  The entire experience made everything feel very European.My husband ordered the duck confit and I had the poached cod.  The presentation of the food was excellent and the dishes were very balanced.  The duck confit was roasted to a crisp and given a side salad. The arugula gave a nice kick to the dish while the vinaigrette added a hint of acidity.The poached cod was cooked through and did not have much flavor on its own.  But with the nuts and veggie mix on top, it had a wonderful full taste when everything was added together.  The only issue I had was that they forgot to make Salmon Tartare until reminded.  We ordered the frog legs and Salmon Tartare as appetizers.  Unfortunately, we only got one and finished the legs before needing to gently remind the waiter about our other dish.  It was not a big deal and we continued to have a nice meal afterwards."
/user_details?userid=MnYfi2DODiZkLIwJFuwB2g,Bill Z.,"Hyde Park, NY",4 star rating,"Dining inside on a warm evening with the front open was a great way to start a stay in Montreal, especially with friends who wanted a meal representative of the French cuisine in Montreal. The wine list is impressive, but among us we imbibed little, just one glass and a few cocktails. The rest of the ""oohs,"" ""aahs"" and ""yums!"" were for all the cuisine. This included everything, from the crusty bread to the soups (the French Onion Soup is classic), and the entrees. I have a rule in restaurants: ""If they have lamb on the menu, you order lamb, unless they also offer duck.""  Duck breast it was, accompanied by very well prepared vegetables, including some of the tastiest cooked carrots I've ever had (I hate cooked carrots unless they're roasted!). Service was great, especially since they were performing Tetris-like activities trying to get our meals onto small round tables. Bonus points for the rest room sign. I didn't take a photo - you'll just have to go there to see it, and order some food and drink while you're there too."
/user_details?userid=MLV9KoKUYsOL0fleIMGFHA,Jenny X.,"Cupertino, CA",4 star rating,"Came here with 3 friends with a reservation we made an hour in advance. We ran into another friend when we were here so that was pretty funny! Food: DEFINITELY remember to check in! Can't waste a good free dessert! We got the cream puff dessert, pretty sure it varies depending on what they have available. The free bread is quite fluffy and crunchy! I got the seasonal risotto which was quite bland if I may say so but with the help of my friend's duck confit and pan fried steak the dish tasted a lot better. We also tried the Foie gras which wasn't like great but tasted authentic nonetheless. Service: Service was actually kind of slow but the waiter was really nice and gave us refills of bread.Ambiance: it's a classy date night vibe and I loved the decorations! This was a nice intro to Montreal! I wouldn't come back but I appreciated the experience."
/user_details?userid=mJ6yNAm5x5-lyW7mkHmNFg,Abby S.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"I went here last night and had such a wonderful experience! Not only was the service and food great, but sitting in their outdoor seating area was the perfect setting for a rare date night. My fiancé and I are not ones to go out for a nice meal so when we chose to go here last night we had high hopes and were so happy with our choice. We started with the warm goat cheese salad because of the pictures of a fellow Yelper. While the goat cheese was absolutely amazing, the salad greens were completely saturated and almost soggy with dressing. Our salad also did not look anything like the picture posted on Yelp. As an update, the menu changes seasonally, so do not count on the menu being the same as the one shown on Yelp. I was very excited to get the chicken shown on the menu on Yelp, since I don't eat red meat, but they did not have any chicken entrees when I visited. They had multiple red meat entrees and a cod dish, which I tried and was very good - but not perfect. We also tried the dessert special with roasted apricots and mint-thyme ice cream, it was incredible!"
/user_details?userid=hqMM_ipipdkxB8M9BfXYNQ,Lisa T.,"Jersey City, NJ",4 star rating,"On a recent girls trip we stumbled upon this restaurant right next to our apartment and it was great. The restaurant was cute and cozy with typical French fair. We got the escargot, frogs legs and French onion soup as starters. The French onion soup was perfect for the chilly day and great flavor. I had the steak which was cooked to my liking and full of the flavor. The creme brûlée was delicious. If you are looking for yummy French food check this place out!"
/user_details?userid=1aZddwS-_bXP355WnDl7tQ,Karl B.,"Centreville, VA",5 star rating,"The pedestrian-only rue Prince Arthur is lined with many good restaurants; Le Deux Gamins is one of the best. It is a warm, cozy restaurant with excellent service and food. The server well explained all the menu choices. I had onion soup and duck confit. The duck confit was excellent with moist meat and crispy skin."
/user_details?userid=IjdJsFpsCx1P-8owC9HqSg,Xia M.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"French fare. Like GENUINE french fare! Escargot specials, classic french onion soup, and an expectation of bottled wine ordering at every table... a bit cramped, but with the terra cotta walls, arched wooden-framed window details, and candle lit tables, this place is the epitome of  romance. Use the yelp check in feature for a free dessert tasting. They chose cream puffs in a raspberry and chocolate sauce for me"

Had the hanger steak and tried the French onion soup. French onion soup was awesome, so filling, flavourful and full of onions and cheese. The steak was also delicious. Shared the charcuterie board. The pickles were the most surprising. It was so good!"
/user_details?userid=eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,Shirley L.,"Markham, Canada",2 star rating,"An underwhelming experience overall. Both the service and food was disappointing. Service: The dining area isn't particularly huge. We were seated on the main floor and the servers could easily view all the tables in the area. However, we felt neglected. The servers were mostly with the larger tables and we felt like he didn't care to offer service to my table. Food:The food was okay. I didn't think the food was worth the price. The portions were small and the flavors were underwhelming. The most disappointing dish was the escargots. The portion was tiny and I didn't enjoy how they fried the escargots. Overall:This place is overhyped and I do not recommend it."
/user_details?userid=ma6206bmu-a_Ja7Iv-yRCw,Sharon M.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"If you're looking to feel quintessentially français in Montreal, Les Deux Gamins offers up a slightly cozy, slightly high end experience. French onion soup, foie gras, beef tartare...all those things that a Francophile foodie would fall head over heels for. It was a nice but blistering August evening and a group of friends and I arrived here on our last day in Montreal to really get a taste of the French side of things. We got treated to a view of the street, what was basically, two open garage doors on the second storey. It was hot, apparently people in Montreal don't believe in AC. I have no idea how the cooks survive, but walking past their open kitchen, they looked like they were moving quick and enjoying work. Now I'm not a French food connoisseur but I can tell when something tastes good. And yep. The food here tasted pretty good. The French onion soup was cheesy, not too salty, and very satisfying. It was perfect to share between two people, or if you feel like only having a soup for a meal. The beef tartare was fresh and tasty, with a beautiful egg yolk on top.The duck is one of their signatures, I believe. At least people had good things to say about it in reviews. I actually found it the most unimpressive out of what we tried though. The duck confit wasn't memorable and while I don't hate peas, I thought the pea puree was a little too abundant and a little too sweet. Service was lovely and friendly. There were barely any patrons in the building with us, and maybe just a handful sitting outside. Not that we minded, it was actually quite a nice quiet evening...until a very loud family with young kids was placed next to us and the parents decided it was ok for them to run around and knock glasses over...sigh.(67/100) - 2018"
/user_details?userid=HXOfPXPMvdXNpQ_l0RRjKw,Jeffrey S.,"Midvale, UT",4 star rating,"Be who you are, that's what I say.Are you a French restaurant? Yes you are. Are you a little bit touristy? Maybe. But that's a little bit of your charm, I think. You don't have a bright red exterior and lots of advertising on the outside of your restaurant if you're not, you know, trying to advertise to the passersby, so I think they're owning it.And there's nothing inherently wrong. I myself am, begrudgingly admitting that I fit that description, and after a long flight across the country I was ravenous and just looking for a nice place to eat outside, breathe the Montreal air and listen to the Montreal sounds. I wanted to eat, and just be still after moving so fast all day long. That's what I did.I walked up and was seated immediately out front, as the street this is located on is closed to all vehicle traffic. It's a lovely walkway and there's a fountain nearby, with lots of foot traffic and peoplewatching to be had. The diners around me all spoke French but laughed in the universal language of good times, and I ordered.I started with the chevre salad, which was not what I was expecting but somehow even better. A small pot of hot chevre and a couple of toast points accompanied a salad of greens, split cherry tomatoes, and onions lightly dressed. I scooped, I stabbed, and I inhaled it all. Lovely.The lamb shank came next and it was rich and hearty and filling. The veggies that accompanied it were cooked but cold in the middle, which was the only down point, but I left so very stuffed and relieved from my journey that I wasn't bothered.The service was so quick and efficient, and I think my favorite little bit of all was the restroom in its black-and-white tile glory. So cute! The whole building--three stories--seems lovely. Not a soul was upstairs and only one party dined inside, but in winter I bet this is a wonderful place to sit and look down on the snowy streets below. Another reason to mark this and come back in another time."
/user_details?userid=9nj5lry5KkSal22Oo9VGvQ,Cayla L.,"Brossard, Canada",3 star rating,"Les deux gamins has such a nice decor but our food wasn't the best. We ordered the onion soup as appetizer, it was good. As for main meal, we wanted to get the butcher's cut. I made sure that they had it on their menu before arriving by calling the restaurant. The person over the phone confirmed with me that they always have the special butcher's cut. Once we arrived, they didn't have their special. My boyfriend and I were quite disappointed since it was his birthday. I read many reviews and chose this restaurant because of all their 5 stars ratings. We ended up choosing different meals. I wanted to get the salmon tartare but it was unavailable since it was only there for summer. The waitress proposed to change the salmon for smoked salmon which was fine. The hanger steak was just alright, nothing special about it. The service was really good. She was helpful but I guess we were mostly disappointed about the food."

/user_details?userid=U-hWiEpEZo_-Xv4Qgrs9Tw,Hin T.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,Very nice bistro restaurant. It is a mutli storey layout and it has a great atmosphere. Had their fixed price menu with the French onion soup to start. It wasn't a great French onion as it was a bit bland. My wife had the warm goat cheese salad which was great.Had the hanger steak with a parsnip puree and salad. It was amazing. Wife had the duck breast with roasted vegetables and that was very good.Service was nice and attentive.
/user_details?userid=F6MPrQ5oxQL2Wq1v5ENDzA,Robert S.,"Providence, RI",4 star rating,"This cute French bistro on Rue Prince Arthur has been a favorite of ours for a while.  We sat outside and  it was nice to people watch as we enjoyed our meals.   I got the poached cod and it was delicious (needed a bit of black pepper, but I do like things a bit spicier).   It come on top of some nice fresh vegetables.   My BF got the hanger steak and it was outstanding...always done perfectly.   If you order it medium rare, you will see some blood....Medium will be perfectly pink in the middle.Our friend Amy got a salmon tartar dish and it was outstanding.   Fresh tasting, nicely seasoned.  It came with crostini and fries (not crispy enough though)....Nice french bread basket is provided as a starter.   They have lots of selections of beer and wine.   They take credit cards."
/user_details?userid=eEiNhI-pRm-rWkoGIBoDpA,Johanna H.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Oh my word, what a meal!! I have Yelp & everyone's reviews to thank for in finding this gem. We started off with the beef tartare & French onion soup. Lots of onions in the soup, nice crispy layer, and tasted airy but flavorful. I was blown away by the beef tartare. All the beef tartare I've had this far had a mediocre taste & texture was off. I'm not sure what's done here, but the temp, texture, and flavor were spot on! For our main course, I had the Duck Confit while my boyfriend ordered the Lamb Shank. In both dishes, the meat fell right off the bone. Perfectly cooked, well seasoned, and absolutely divine! My mouth is watering reliving the memory. Sad to say I didn't have any room for dessert & sorely wish I did. Overall, including the warm hospitality & attentive service, this is a must-try restaurant if you're ever in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=3rs2RW8dsmhujHkK49i2zQ,Connie Y.,"Rockville, MD",4 star rating,"First night in Montreal and if I'm ever back, I will stop here for their lamb shank. It was the perfect comfort food for a rainy day. And it was a great to introduce ourselves to French cuisine. While it may be a bit touristy, I didn't mind the ambiance at all. Paints were red and black with mirrors surrounding the restaurant. Very quaint. Good thing we made reservations a few days ahead because it was crowded. The food was delicious. We began with the french onion soup. Very tasty although I would have like the temperature to be higher for that steaming effect. The lamb shank was slowly braised with mashed potatoes and colorful roasted vegetables. Flavor tasted like a home cooked meal by grandma. The beef tartare was fresh, but could use a bit of salt and more crackers. Hanger Steak was made exactly to order, so we were very happy with the quality and outcome of a medium rare steak. Lastly, we also had the duck confit (a leg) that was seasoned well albiet a bit dry. Wish we got some desserts, but we were extremely full. Next time!"

It's just a small restaurant with some outdoor area at the sidewalk and ten minute drive from old Montreal.The reason they have high review is that they offer free dessert for the people who write reviews.
/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I just came back from Paris recently and had easily one of the worst beef tartares in my life there. Why? They put ketchup in it. It would seem that the over-touristifiction of Paris and the taste of tourists has affected the food in traditional French bistros. They are now putting ketchup in steak tartare to suit the palates of clueless American and Chinese tourists. Who would have thought that if you now want authentic continental French food, you can only find it in Montreal now? I came here for supper last Friday night with a friend and wanted to clear my memory and palate of that tartare in Paris. So I got the French Onion Soup, the Beef Tartare and closed off with the Creme Brulee. All of it was flawless and hit the spot. Even the checked black and white tiled floor is decidedly French. Service is very friendly and the ambiance here is quite casual.  I saw other tables ordering other items from their menu like their green salad, escargots, lamb shank and plate of cheeses and all of it looked great."
/user_details?userid=bQCHF5rn5lMI9c5kEwCaNA,Vincent L.,"Oakland, CA",4 star rating,"A very authentic restaurant with a very comprehensive menu of bistro fare. I was visiting town with my picky Cantonese-heritage parents who, after having lived in and assimilated fully into the US for over 40 years, still insist on going out for Chinese food when we travel. After too many mediocre experiences in Chinatown, I insisted on having real French-inspired food for dinner, and even my parents enjoyed the change in scenery for once.A foie gras torchon appetizer was almost entrée-sized, and was a nice, savory way to start the meal. We all elected meaty selections for our main courses, and these were nicely presented and of quite decent quality, whether a steak entrée, a duck confit dish, or, if I remember correctly, a pork belly dish. The pricing was perfectly appropriate given the overall size and quality of the offerings.Service was also quite reasonable. While things were very quiet the night we visited, the restaurant is quite large and can handle lots of people over several floors which can let in the outside air when the weather is warmer. Overall, a solid, decent choice for French bistro fare."

The second time around did not disappoint and we were sad to leave our new favorite restaurant in Montreal.If you have never been, without a doubt have the duck confit. By far the best meal. We ate duck throughout our entire stay in Montreal, and no restaurant or dish comes close. Every bite was delicious and just as good as the last. We can not recommend this restaurant enough."

Their escargot was unique in its Spanish preparation, and lacked neither flavor nor surprise. The mushroom risotto came in just the right size, it was creamy and the mushrooms were delicious. The hanger steak was perfectly cooked atop a root vegetable purée that was creamy and not too heavy. The duck came with crispy roasted vegetables that made for a well rounded entree.

The food was AMAZING!We started with the French onion soup and escargot. The soup was good, very traditional, nothing special. BUT the escargot was superb. It was served with a red pepper coulis. It really helped bring out the flavor of the snails.I ordered the cod, which was crusted with pumpkin seeds and some kind of nut. It was served with carrots and potatoes. The fish tasted so light and the carrots complimented it very well. We also got the Duck Confit, which was served with arugula and mushy peas. The duck was really good - crispy skin, very tinder and savory. Very well cooked. The peas were sweet and airy, complimenting the saltiness of the duck very well.We ended with the creme brûlée, which was fantastic and taste like there was fresh vanilla in it.I definitely recommend this place a a must visit for anyone's stay in Montréal!"

Made a reservation on Yelp (super convenient) and table was ready for us when we arrived. The atmosphere was great - artsy decorations, vintage ceiling fans, roll open windows and all. There are outdoor spaces so I'm sure in the summer they fill out very quickly. The menu is compact, but in a way it's great cause it ensures quality. Wine by the glass is a bit pricey for the volume. But other than that, food and service was great.It's a 5 minute walk from the subway Sherbroke station on the Orange line. You'll pass by a park with a very nice gold rimmed fountain.We ordered:Country Terrine - rich and I can taste the herby flavour mixed in with the pate. Only 2 crostinis served - but also goes well with the toasted bread.French Onion Soup - agree with other reviews that it tasted just right and not too salty. It has lots of ingredients - soaked up all the soup, wish there was more!Duck confit - I loved the sweet pea puree and the arugula salad. The duck confit has a crispy skin and mild flavour, not overly salty. Some previous reviewers mentioned the skin is not crispy, but I can see they have improved based on the reviews.Other honourable mentions: fois gras, beef tartare, escargot, lamb shankYelp check in offer only applies to one serving per table.Thanks for the great experience. I look forward to visiting again in warmer weather!"

We were about to scream when we saw the dish! It was huge!!! And the sides with salad, 2 kinds of potatoes and grilled veggies!!! All tasted great and satisfactory. While we were in Montreal we noticed something different from the US. The dish always comes with nice portion of real salad (not a cheaply iceberg Lettuce with over powering thick dressing)  and tasty potatoes, not one or the other. We loved the Montreal style."
/user_details?userid=GxzhQZokFig02SwfVhGQlA,Jenny X.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"I have to say management should consider staffing more waiters on weekends and other peak times. The servers were overworked the evening I visited. There were only 2 servers for the entire restaurant and it was relatively busy for a Sunday evening. The restaurant also has three floors of which two were being used for the evening. The servers were constantly running back and forth, we waited at least 45 minutes before we finally had to call a waiter over to our table to place our orders. I got the duck confit which was underwhelming and tasted overdone. However my friend's steak dish tasted quite good. It's definitely worth checking in on yelp here while they still have the offer for the free dessert. Don't expect to receive the full sized dessert, but it's free so I'm not complaining. The creme brûlée we got tasted incredible, I definitely would've got it even if it wasn't free."

The minute you enter the place, you feel this French vibe. It's quite roomie and we had a nice table on the second floor. The menu is limited, very few items, but that's a great thing since it ensures that each plate is done perfectly and passionately. For starters, we had the Esscargots with peppers and Salmon tartare. I am a sushi lover and I was blown away by the freshness and the taste of the salmon. The duck Confit was fatty and full of flavor, exactly the perfect balance that you expect from the French cuisine. The lamb was beyond incredible. Finally, we had a creme brulee and a nice bottle of Pinot noir. Definitely a great and delicious dinner, very well spent money. The only downside is that they take long to cook the courses, but I felt rewarded in the end."

The waitress was wonderful and the other servers were nothing but polite and helpful. As a visitor in Montreal this was truly one of my favorite food spots. A bit more expensive than other Montreal classics like poutine but worth every single penny and really a bang for the buck when you consider the food you get. Of every restaurant I would consider going to in Montreal again, this would be my top choice. Exceeded my already high expectations without any doubt.

Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and patient w/our ordering. We had the Beef Tartar, Foie Gras, Duck Confit and French Onion Soup. The Beef tartar was a bit under seasoned but was chopped well and had great texture. The French onion soup was the best I've had - clean broth and not too salty as they tend to be. I loved the perfectly toasted cheese on top. My favorite was the Foie Gras au Torchon served with a fresh fig. My least favorite was the Duck Confit which was fall off the bone tender but was missing a crispy skin. I also thought the accompanying pea purée was too pasty. It could have benefitted from some light crème. I liked the limited menu option as well. You don't need a huge menu if you make a few things very well."

For my main I had the lamb shank over mashed potatoes.  The lamb was tender and flavorful.  My wife's poached cod (was it frozen?) was dry and a little meh, lacking in flavor.  Since we had ""checked in"" on Yelp we earned a free dessert. Don't get your hopes up, though. The ramekin of creme brûlée (chef's choice since it was free) was so small I didn't think ramekins came in that size (think a little larger than doll house furniture).  Wine list by the glass was limited but full-poured.   In a city with so many great restaurants I would probably not return.  That is my definition of a 3.5 star experience."

I loved that the waiter could really explain intricate details about the dishes from the presentation, cooking times, area of the country the meat/cheese was sourced, and the flavor profiles. Very helpful for a my non French speaking self. Appetizers were phenomenal got the Discovery board and was pleasantly impressed with the herbs and honey flavors incorporated into the sausages. Entrees included the rack of lamb and the duck confit. Rack of lamb was amazing, melt in your mouth, super lovely flavors, presentation was also on point. For the duck the flavors were great, presentation was a bit much It needed a bit more color. And the duck was over cooked making it a bit hard to chew. The dessert was lovely as well, good but nothing too special, presentation was very good. I would definitely reccomend this place because for the most part the dishes were lovely especially at the price points they have. It makes it feel like a steal especially in Montreal!"

Let me explain!The french onion soup, which was the main motivation for us to go, was very good and on the sweeter side. We enjoyed it! My friend got the steak and it was very tasty, perfectly cooked and seasoned. She liked it and so did I. I got the lamb shank on mashed potatoes which was slightly bland but perfectly cooked. We both enjoyed it as well. Now what was the issue beyond the slightly bland lamb? Our entrees were cold! Not warm-ish, not lukewarm, not room temp but just plan cold. My friend didn't say anything because if you warm up steak it would no longer be cooked as well as it was and be overcooked. I did tell the waitress that my lamb was cold (I am not the best at hiding my emotions).  She took it back and they warmed it or remade it (in the meantime I had some of my friends steak and more bread, so then I was too full for the lamb lol) and somehow it was only slightly warmer.Not sure why they couldn't get the food temps right but the ambiance was very Parisian and the staff was very friendly.

For my main I had the Fresh Egg Tagliatelles which was some of the best homemade pasta I've ever had. Some of my friends started with the French Onion Soup which was a huge portion and oozing with cheese. The broth was very tasty although I wish there was more of it, it all soaked into the bread. Another friend had the Duck Confit which was fall off the bone good and now every time she has duck in Toronto, she complains its not as good. The house wine was also quite nice, a chardonnay but not overly dry, $30 for the bottle.Service 5/5: Our waiter was really nice and attentive, taking the time to answer our questions about the menu. Also, because we were a big group, it took us a while to get a table so we were one of the last people there but he never made us feel rushed."

I ordered the duck confit and my bf ordered the hangar steak. Probably because we usually get much bigger portions in NY that we were surprised the portions were on the smaller side. The entrees weren't pricey so we were like okay, you get what you pay for. Both entrees were delicious. What took off two stars and made our experience unpleasant was:1. There was hair on our bread 2. The waitress only charged us for 3 glasses of wine rather than 4 and we thought she comped us because there was hair on the bread. My BF thanked her and she said ""NO i have to take the bill back and recharge you again."" This was after we got the bill and we were ready to swipe.

When we arrived the waiter was really busy and didn't seat us immediately. I thought he was being rude but when we did get seated he was very sweet and apologized profusely for the wait. I soon after realized that he seemed to be the ONLY waiter working in the entire restaurant (the first floor was completely full and the second floor where we were seated was half full.) I felt so bad for him but he was able to serve us pretty quickly considering that. For appetizers we got the French onion soup (which the waiter told us they are known for) and the fois gras. The fois gras was classic and tasty. The soup was one of the best French onion soups I've had. It was half cheese and bread (always what I secretly hope for when I order this) and had great flavor. Not overly salted like some. For main courses I had the duck confit and my mom had the hanger steak. My duck confit was very tasty and tender and crispy-salty on the outside. However many of the potatoes it came with seemed to be pretty undercooked and raw-tasting/crunchy. My mom's steak was perfectly medium rare but a bit cold. The waiter was also nice enough to give her fries with it.The ambiance is cute and French-feeling and I believe the walls open when it's nice outside (it was raining pretty hard when we went.) The prices aren't for every night, but they're fine for a once in a while tasty French food treat. Also bonus points for being close to the Metro (near the Sherbrooke station.)

The bread to cheese ratio was good the soup was not too salty or too oily. It might be the best French onion soup I've had to date. Then we got the escargot. This one was also a winner. It was not a butter pesto dish but rather one with a red pepper sauce. It sounds weird but it was totally delicious! For the main, we had the lamb shank. This was cooked very well and it did not smell of lamb. The shank was braised slowly and was very tender. The bread and butter that came with the meal was usual fare but it was a nice touch.

It's awesome, comforting, and most of all it's not greasy at all.I chose Les Deux Gamins due to its excellent reviews and close proximity to the Metro. Even the walk to the restaurant was quite nice, as you pass thru a park and some Victorian-style houses.Upon entering the restaurant, you can immediately tell that it's an authentic French restaurant with the traditional French setup. The tables are small, the seats are also smaller, and the restaurant has several floors. You are served by a male waiter, and the person pouring water is a female dressed in traditional French attire.The menu isn't extensive, but it covers many of the French staples. I went with the French Onion Soup, escargots, butcher cut (short rib), and creme brulee du jour. Before everything came, we were served with homemade French bread, which was not surprisingly on the hard side, but it tasted quite good for what it's worth.The French Onion Soup was delicious and had that excellent onion aroma. The cheese was also plentiful and melted well with the soup, and the croutons also mashed well with the soup. The escargots were plentiful, and the garlic add-on was a nice touch. The butcher cut, which we shared, was grilled medium rare, which in this case was excellent. However, I would say that I had better beef in other restaurants before, and unless it's a part that's unique it's not something would order again. Finally, the creme brulee had an excellent cream texture, and is something I would definitely order again for dessert.Service was excellent, and we were attended to the whole way by both the waiter and the lady.

We (unfortunately) went here during the heatwave in July. The restaurant's AC broke in the kitchen, and with 95+ degree (Farenheit) heat, two cooks passed out. The heat in the kitchen was over 50 Celsius according to our waiter. When I asked if the chef was okay, the wait staff said ""I don't know - but we're handling it."" Staff members told us this, and ""apologized for the delay"". We were horrified that they didn't shut the restaurant down right then, but the manager demanded they keep serving. Apparently he also took over in the kitchen.Waiters were sweating on everything, and into the food.The food itself was nothing great - and I was worried about illness from the unsanitary conditions. But the waiters were clearly in distress, and that was the most upsetting part. They were sweating profusely the entire time. I saw our waiter drip sweat into the food of the table next to us. It was horrifying and disgusting - and people's safety and welfare were disregarded because the manager/owner wanted to make a few extra bucks.Please do not go here - and let them know that this is not acceptable. I don't know what kind of health standards Canadian businesses operate under. If this were the US, it would have been shut down within hours and the owner fined tens of thousands of dollars. This is by far the worst dining experience I have ever had. Per the news, 12 people have died in Montreal from the heat wave, and I hope this restaurant did not contribute to that. Shame on you."

Our dinner, with a glass of wine each, came to around $150 with tax and tip. Service was quick, attentive and overall pleasant. The staff are bilingual, so those that don't speak French, do not be intimidated to try them out :) We were practicing our French and appreciated the staffs' patience. I would definitely come back the next time we are in Montreal and I would recommend that friends check it out. The experience really was like being at a bistro in Paris."

/user_details?userid=LMoK9BUP6Tgfc0AeDVbZHQ,Steff D.,"Portland, ME",4 star rating,"I'm always nervous when friends warn me that the restaurant were going to is relatively un-vegetarian friendly. Sometimes, though, that's where real gems of dishes for us herbivores can be found! Such was the case at Les Deux Gamins, where besides a delicious bottle of rosé, I enjoyed:  Frites/French Fries ($4): Everything I ever craved was in these fries. Julienne cut, salty, crispy on the outside, melt-in-your-mouth fluffy on the inside, and dredged through whatever that dangerously delicious white sauce was (I don't want to know what's in it, do I?)? I probably could have just eaten baskets of these all.night.long. with endless glasses of wine and been entirely satisfied.Salade de chèvre chaud et noix de Grenoble/Warm goat cheese and walnut salad (16.50): This was one of the lone options I had for my entree choices, and it was grand. A heaping mound of greens with a walnut dusting and four sizable slices of toast each covered with a thick slab of goat cheese (and did I taste a hint of honey on it, too?). Yes, please! The goat cheese was beyond plentiful and generous, too, more than I've ever seen at a restaurant before... so if you like cheese... and you're a vegetarian... I promise, you will not go hungry with this option (also, be sure to have more rosé to wash each bite down with as goat cheese itself can be very dry in the most amazing of ways). So despite the lack of choices, would I come back here again? Absolutely. Sitting outside right on Prince Arthur does, as another reviewer mentioned, feel very much like Europe. It helped that a gentleman showed up to play French music for a spell, that the young girls next to us were excitedly talking about their backpacking trip, that the waitstaff was attentive, that my company was lovely, the weather was perfect, and that the rosé was divine after a long day of flying. Couldn't have had a more ""just right"" dinner my first night in Montreal!"

We each ordered green salad.  She had the lamb shank while I had duck Condit, each with plans to share.Salads took a while.  Eventually a food runner came out and offered our salads to two other tables befofe we flagged her down.  Salads were tasty despite some wilted bits we avoided.  Simple butter lettuce with spring greens. No bread arrived.Entrees took a while. Totally worth waiting for. Lamb shank was tender and delicious.  Barbecue sauce was nothing an American would recognize as such but tasty nonetheless. Sweet, complex flavor, but no smoke, chili, or bite really.  Duck confit fell off the bone and barely stayed on the plate we ate it so fast. Potatoes and veggies were great, too, but were substitute sides.  Your mileage may vary. Then the bread arrived.  Good for finishing up the sauce."

I have a big appetite and this place left me very full. The salmon tartare was delicately seasoned and the beef tartare was complemented nicely wish fresh greens. It is so rare to see such fresh greens as garnish in Toronto. For dessert, there was creme brulee (it's very big!) and the flambed pineapples. The pineapples tasted heavily of alcohol, which may be a plus for some.Overall, very satisfied with my experience."

They also removed trout and sea bass from the menu. So my options were limited. I then settled for escargot for my appetizer and a type of white fish dish (recommended by the server). The escargot tasted like boiled snail on top of spinach with no seasoning whatsoever. The fish dish was simply grilled fish, asparagus and uncooked rice. Overall, it was so bland with very minimal seasoning (to the point that I had to add salt to my food for it to taste somewhat seasoned). I was totally disappointed in this restaurant in every way. The service was mediocre, food was not worth the price, and I do not recommend anyone coming here for a nice dinner. I don't normally write reviews but this restaurant was so particularly bad that I feel like there are other nicer places in Montreal one should try than going to this one. It definitely does not deserve 4 stars."

While I'm not surprised that the serving was so small (it's french food after all), the duck was quite moist and delicious. + PATIO: the doors to the restaurant were large and open which allowed for the enjoyment of the great weather despite being situated in doors. Cons- W/R: only one per sex. The design of the washroom was inconvenient as the water from the sink was so close to the sink that you couldn't wash your hands without touching the sink's surface (which only serves to make your hands dirty as opposed to cleaner).- SERVICE: the waiter gave me the dirtiest look when I decided to skip an app and opt for an entree and a drink instead. Excuse me? For the premium prices that I'm paying, the least I should come to expect is top notch service (-2 points). We also would've wanted split bills but it comes as no surprise that the waiter didn't ask before handing us our bill. tl;dr? good food. shitty service."

I'm familiar with the dinner rush; I'm from NYC. I usually give the restaurants I review the benefit of the doubt but this was the worst dining experience I have had thus far. If I could give zero stars I would. We, a party of 5, came at 8 pm and waited about 15 minutes and were seated. From the time we were seated until 35 minutes later the only service that we received was a server pouring water for us. Nothing else. No one came by to take out orders, no one came to see how were doing, no apology for the wait. All that happened was a server walking repeatedly past us to serve the other table near us. At first, I thought it was a cultural thing, maybe I had to flag down a waiter. A few nods and waves brought NOTHING. After 35 minutes and 5 hangry people, we left. I can't even comment on the food as all I had was their water.

These were both very tasty, but the goat cheese salad truly stood out. It was a typical green salad with a light dressing & the goat cheese was served on the side as more of a dip. By the end of the salad my boyfriend and I were finding as many random things as we could to dip in the goat cheese. I probably could've eaten a gallon of it - SO GOOD. Goat cheese lovers unite. For our main dishes we ordered the lamb shank & duck. We both agreed it was more than enough food, especially on the lamb shank. It was massive!

Not the swiftest of service, but it's also nice not to feel rushed. Thought it was a BYOW location but it isn't."
/user_details?userid=_YyQF6B2vJqYf1FnCyXv9A,Emile L.,"Edgewater, NJ",4 star rating,I really liked this place. We booked the thanksgiving diner pre fix. The meal was great and so was the wine pairing. The only thing that was missing was the cranberry sauce. The chef made a beet and apple sauce which was good but not the same. Everything else was terrific. I especially liked the pumpkin pie which was made in a tart crust and was especially thin.
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I don't know why, but each of the three times I've been here, Les Deux Gamins always seems to primarily attract two types of people - your stereotypical Anglophones and Chinese tourists (yes, I would know because I can understand their Mandarin). Of course, the occasional Francophone hops in here and there, but not enough to remove the ""hidden tourist-y"" vibe it gives off. Nonetheless, it is arguably the cheapest French bistro in the city, so I don't want to completely invalidate it because it does serve up some quality eats.I decided to order the goat cheese salad for my appetizer and the seasonal risotto for my main course. Before that all came out, however, I was served a bread basket that contained your stereotypical baguette and butter. It was still warm and fresh, though, so I ate it happily. The goat cheese salad had enough greens to fulfill at least half of one's daily recommended total, as well as the perfect touch of sweetness from the candied walnuts. Of course, the hot goat cheese tasted sublime when combined with everything else, and I used the leftovers to spread on the remaining bread slices. Next came the risotto, which was arguably the highlight of the night. I believe that it was served with enoki mushrooms and cheese (it was hard to see but I inferred from the texture). Wow. Everything harmonized in my mouth to produce the perfect combination of bite from the risotto, the almost meaty quality of the mushrooms, and just the right amount of cheese. I had to control myself not to eat it too fast because it was just that great.For dessert, I used the Yelp promo for free dessert upon check in, and I got a small crème brûlée-type dish. It had a nice sound when I cracked the top to reveal the creamy bottom. The hard caramel top provided a nutty contrast to the smoothness of the cream, which was very nice and a perfect way to top off a delicious meal.Overall, Les Deux Gamins provides great food for the price they offer and is one of the tourist traps (in my mind since they don't really appear on Montréal tourist must-go-to lists) that is actually worth visiting if you can get past the somewhat annoyingly nitpicky Anglophones that tend to hover around the establishment. However, I did get charged for water this time since I was asked by the waiter if I wanted mineral or sparkling water, and I was slightly confused because I always received normal water without question; hence I thought mineral water was its equivalence. One bottle cost about six dollars added to my total bill so that was kind of a yikes moment. The only reason why I'm not giving 4 stars is because the waiter did state that it was his first night working, and I'm usually lenient on first-time mistakes. So in case that happens to anyone reading this, just ask for normal water instead, i guess."

Right when I walked in I felt like we were back in Paris. The smell of delicious food to the round tables and wicker chairs, it was already off to a good start. They seemed realllly busy so it took a little bit to get our orders in, but that's almost always a good sign, right? We started with the onion soup and weren't disappointed. It was flavorful and just hot enough (I hate it when they bring it out warm and it cools so quickly that by the middle of eating it you've got cold giant lumps of cheese). Then we got steak frites- steak was tender and fries were nice thin and crispy. Also got the duck confit which was also tender and paired well with the accompanied veggies. The only thing we weren't a fan of was the brownie for dessert, it was more cakey than preferred but it was free (with check in!) so can't complain."

/user_details?userid=iwGh8IlpXMdzMyAd5FKmzw,San W.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"One of the best meals we had while we were in Montreal. That lamb shank...oh my. Let me tell ya, I was holding myself back from picking it up and gnawing the meat right off of the bone. So tender and flavorful. And it was HUGE! I mean, look at that pic! Of course, I finished every last bite. (Gotta pad that muffin top.) b. enjoyed her duck confit, which was also cooked very well and came in a large portion too. The sauce made a nice pairing - complemented the meat without overpowering it. But in the end, I think my lamb shank KO'ed b's duck, hands down. Our appetizer, the foie gras, was okay, nothing special. But we also had no idea what ""au torchon"" meant when we ordered it so maybe our expectations were off. We probably would have done better with the beef tartare, which looked pretty good from the looks of the table next to us, but we were pretty meat-ed out by that point in our trip.Service was friendly enough. When we arrived early for dinner, I asked our waiter whether we could be seated on the second floor in front of the open balcony. In typical French form, he responded with a short but polite, ""No, is impossible."" This tickled us. Oh, if only I had a French accent."

Came here with a group last night and even though we were a bit of a rowdy group, the service was absolutely spot on.The evening started off with a Zou Bisou cocktail which was mixed to perfection: vodka, Chambord, jus de pomme and topped with a yummy blackberry; anything that has a connection to Mad Men, I'm so drinking it! I tried the tapas menu: 3 items for 10 bucks (how awesome is that?) I had the tartare de saumon which was incredible, the rillette de salmon and the best bruchetta that I've ever had, yum yum. The portions were a good size and everything was fresh and done to perfection. Any restaurant where the owners come out to talk to the table and actually care what you think of the place gets a thumbs up from me.I can only imagine how great this place is going to be in the summer with the huge windows that will open onto the street, overlooking the fountain. It feels like you've been transported to Paris while dining here and the added fact that they don't gauge you on the wine prices means that I will most definitely be back."

It actually wasn't our first choice, but while other restaurants could not accommodate our largish party on short notice, Les Deux Gamins could and we're glad for it.We were able to make a reasonable dent in the not-too-large menu of bistro faves.Duck ravioli was nicely done, served in a brown butter sauce. The  house salad was fresh and generous.Fish of the day was Mahi-Mahi;  the whole fish lightly grilled and served with rice. Almost an Asian take on the dish. Very very good, we left nothing but bones. Onion soup was a fine rendition, although probably best to share as it is too rich for one.Warm chèvre and walnut salad with honey was simple, but outstanding. Needed nothing moreLamb shank in Whiskey BBQ sauce was tender, tasty and presented very well. Again, nothing left but the bone.Crème brûlée for dessert was perfect;  custard at the perfect consistency with a think, crisp brûlée layer on top.Service was remarkably efficient, particularly considering how few staff there were.

The only dish I enjoyed was the duck confit which was fall off the bone good and the veggies complimented it very well. Now as for the beef tartar, I ordered it because I saw so many people mention it in the reviews. It lacked seasoning. Not what I thought it would be. French onions soup was generic. I tried foie gras for the first time here and didn't like it. I'm not deducting points for that however because maybe I won't like foie gras anywhere else either.

The French onion soup was very nicely executed. For entree, the beef tartare was very nice but lacked flavor. It was definitely better once I added salt, but again, it needed a special touch.

The beef tartar was just ok, it had a runny egg on it which is great, but it runs all over the place.

Water never went empty.My wife ordered a dish similar to beef stew with some clearly French twists in its flavors. It was moist, tender and delicious. I ordered duck confit with Mac and cheese which was the BEST Mac and Cheese I think I ever had - creamy, cheesy, a nice baked crust and the duck was also a generous portion of delicious, non-greasy, fantastically flavored duck. Unfortunately we had no room for dessert- a true shame.

My girlfriend took me to this well-reviewed authentic French restaurant (God bless you babe, you were a wonderful date!), and I was really looking forward to good ol' Quebecan food. We had ordered the cheese platter as appetizer and shared both the salmon tartare and the duck confit with scalloped potatoes. The cheese platter was decent (albeit a little small) and the salmon tartare was well plated and fresh.Unfortunately, that was when the night took a turn for the worst. When the server brought me my dish, it was a completely different dish than I had ordered [tuna salad]. I politely waited as he scrambled to get the correct dish. By the time he brought the dish, it was a pulled pork dish over salad, also not what I had ordered. By this time, I had waited over 20 minutes while my girlfriend's dish had become cold and the sweet potato fries soggy. Finally, after 30 minutes of waiting, I finally received the correct dish, and it was amazing! But still had a bitter aftertaste from half an hour of waiting and no real apologizes from the staff.At the end of the dinner, we were not given a real explanation on why my meal was inaccurately delivered 3 times in a roll. And worst of all, they still charged me for the dish [although they took $2 off the price] and had the courage to ask for a 15% tip. If it weren't for my girlfriend politely asking me to stay calm, I would have ranted out loud for the horrible service.The food may have been good, but the service was so atrocious that I will NEVER come back.ps: We weren't the only people who got the wrong orders; there were at least 2 other families that ate there that night who also got the wrong plates.Food: 3 starsPrice: 3 starsService: unmentionable."

My sister and I had come here for a late dinner (~9:30), so they had already run out of several options for main courses, including the lamb shank (which I had been eyeing), and the duck ravioli (which my sister had been contemplating). My sister ended up getting the beef tartare with a side of fries and salad, and I opted for the sea bass on a bed of quinoa, and we had the torchon de foie gras to start. They also serve complimentary bread !The foie gras was good, but we both haven't had foie gras often enough to tell whether it was amazing. The mains were both really good though! My sister really enjoyed her beef tartare, and my sea bass was delicious as well, and the quinoa was super flavorful. At the end of our meal, we were both stuffed, but decided to share a dessert. We got the pineapples with sugar on top, which was doused in rum. It was really cool, because our server, Simon, brought the rum to our table, and lit it on fire in front of us! Super super cool! Overall, it was a great dining experience - the food was really tasty, the service was really good and friendly, and I really like the outdoor patio! Will definitely come back again (at an earlier time) to try their other menu items!"

Started with the ""discovery board"" and was brought an array of prosciutto, salami, blue cheese, brie and other incredible delicacies. Then we had the French onion soup which dripped with flavorful expression and was a complete highlight. Finally we shared the duck (although we were full) we got recommended this dish from our server who voiced that guests travel to the restaurant for this particular dish. Despite being full we finished the entire dish of duck and wanted more! Service was attentive, helpful and charming while the location had an old school warmth to it. 10/10 recommend this spot for rich wine, romantic lighting and an evening one will never forget."
/user_details?userid=9bvlW5Gos1kxzvcM3c-12w,Don P.,"Hampden County, MA",4 star rating,"I visited this Montreal bistro in the dead of winter this past February and I can not understand how I over looked writing a review until now. Bistro's in general tend to prepare all the French classics and LDG is no exception. It was a frightfully cold snowy evening when I entered the restaurant, there was another party of five at a nearby table, I suppose the weather was a factor as it certainly was not the food I can assure you. I ordered the Lamb shank with paprika and Jack Daniels reduction, mashed potatoes, fresh brussel sprouts, carrots, green and red pepper. The lamb was what you would have expected, it was falling off the bone tender, bursting with flavor, enhanced by a subtle, yet perfectly flavorful Jack Daniels reduction. The vegetables were cooked nicely, firm in texture, each of the respective flavors were identifiable; the perfect medley to accompany the lamb shank. I have found over the years dining in Montreal the house wines are more than suitable as was the case here with their house red wine. For dessert I had Crème brûlée which, I must say, was excellent far better than many I've had here in the states and certainly the equal of what I have experienced in Europe. I ended the meal with a Tariquet Armagnac, a very good one which I thoroughly enjoyed as I gazed out the window on that wintery February evening. As I looked out the window, I reflected on what a pleasant experience it was dining at Les Deux Gamins from the service to the food and the traditional bistro atmosphere, one I hope to repeat very soon."

Excellent food and very friendly staff and the prices are reasonable: we got the lamb shank and split a plate of risotto, which they split into two plates after we asked the staff. Beautiful atmosphere, feels like a little Paris in Montreal, so if you want a fancy French dinner you really don't need to go to the much more expensive ones in the Old Port. I also have to note that the portions are a good size, you won't get the tiny portions of a typical upscale restaurant. Highly recommend, this is now our go-to spot."

The waitress was hesitant about it being cooked well done which honestly, a child should have a steak however he/she prefers so they eat it.  I also had the steak in a shallot sauce and parsnip puree. Again nothing special. Our waitress forgot our drinks after asking twice. We were disappointed as it has such good reviews."

I ordered the duck confit as my entree it was cooked perfectly. The duck was very juicy and the meat was silky smooth. Pairing the food with a glass of Kronenbourg was surely a winner. I finished off with a creme burlee (hazelnut) and a cup of cappuccino. Unfortunately I have to deduct a star here for very slow service near the end of my meal. I had to wait for a long time for my cappuccino and then my bill but if I am back in town, I would love to visit again."

The service was kinda slow which is not a problem with me if the food is good, but sadly that was not the experience I had. The fish was not well cooked it was very heavy (not in a good steaky fish kind of way) and somewhat dry, and the flavor was not good either. It had a kind of bland and greasy taste that was okay at the beginning but by the end was grossing me out. It also had a bunch of seeds and nuts stuck on the top of the piece of fish which I found didn't pair with the fish very well. I tryed to appreciate it, but I couldnt understand the reason for pairing those two flavors. The one redeeming part of the dish was that it came with some very tasty carrots and I'm not usually a huge fan of those. A family member of mine had the duck confit and it was alright, but not great. Finally our server was very attentive and kind, but for the price tag that comes with the mediocre food I can't recommend this restaurant."

Standouts were the salmon tartare and country terrine appetizers, the lamb shank, tagliatelle, and beef tartare. Very relaxing atmosphere, with the front wall opened to the elements (outdoor seating is also available, but we were worried about the rain). If you're here for the jazz festival, think about coming up Rue Saint-Laurent to escape from the chaos for a bit and enjoy a great casual meal in a pleasant environment."

The restaurant has a very distinctive decor, surprisingly old-school non-hipster vibe and offers absolutely amazing food. We had our reservation at 7.30, we were seated right away. However we spend almost 2.5 hours in the restaurant from  Appetizers to Desert. However the chef was nice enough to cook us up a delicious 50oz flank steak for the same price of the 30oz that we ordered. If any body is looking for an affordable, but delicious french food this is the place to be."
/user_details?userid=e7wMxzZjLLk9C_ZXA8_jkg,Stephanie C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow. I made reservations and went here with my friend on Saturday evening and was very pleased with my choice.The interior is very intimate and romantic and old style, with Victorian hex tiles on the floor of the main part where we were sitting looking out to the street from the garage pane windows.  We ordered escargot to share, my friend had the lamb shank for her main, and I had the duck confit with a glass of the Minervois region red. The escargots were excellent as the sauce, which was likely some red wine reduction, had a lot of flavour with entire cloves of garlic and diced tomatoes. The lamb was tender, as was the duck, but the parsnip mash was particularly good, and stood out in my mind. I preferred the lamb, but my friend preferred the duck because it retained the duck flavour well, so I guess it's a matter of personal preference, but needless to say, we enjoyed both the mains. As a note, the red was full bodied, not particularly dry, and went nicely with the duck.For dessert, we shared a creme brulee, for which the custard was not overly egg-y or sweet, though I found it a little odd that the custard was cold when served. I am used to having it at room temperature. Nonetheless, the flavour was good, and the portion generous.The service was probably what put me over the top for this place. We had a main male server (I wish I knew his name...) and a female server to assist on the side. They were the right amounts of attentive, and very, very professional and kind. I am always a bit apprehensive about going to French restaurants when I am only able to speak English, because sometimes I get poor service on account of my language. Both our servers were friendly and attentive, and the guy even gave us dessert on the house! Terrific dining experience."

The appetizer and main course menu are just the right size so as not to confuse the guests, and the wine list is wonderful. They also offer three types of locally brewed beer on tap (Griffon - great craft brewery in Montreal), which can be paired with all the fair on the menu. We started with the French onion soup, which was done to perfection, and the adventure board, which was a variety of cheese, smoked duck with greens, a cup of pickled vegetables, prosciutto, salami, French Brie and Cheddar, with wonderful bread. For the mains we had lamb shank done to perfection (paired with the house merlot) and the hanger steak with green salad and potatoes (paired with the Griffon amber ale). It was all amazing.

I wasn't sure how it would go. The latest reviews here in English seemed good, but the French ones were terrible. For a French restaurant, I'd tend to give the latter more weight, but I remained openminded.The staff were very friendly and helpful, but there were just too many mistakes to be forgiven. Unfortunately for us, the menu was about to be changed the next day, so about three items were off. But the server neglected to tell us about the specials - mussels. I wouldn't have ordered them anyway, but it was a bit strange to realise that I could have, by seeing servers bring back the pots. Service was prompt but forgetful. We had no place settings when our starters arrived. We had to ask twice for Worcestershire sauce for the tartare, and our water was empty more than once. To be fair, there was a large party of about 12 on the terrace, but given the Indian Summer weekend we were having, and the resto's location on Prince Arthur, they should have had more staff.We were three and ordered a goat's cheese salad and two lots of snails in puff pastry to start:- The snails came in a cheese sauce with two triangles of puff pastry on the side. That isn't a feuilleté. Also, the cheese sauce ""manquait de finesse"" - was not terribly refined. I wouldn't say it was disgusting; it was actually reasonably tasty, particularly as the snails were quite juicy, but it was very disappointing, with the cheese sauce completely overwhelming the dish.- The goat's cheese salad was also not really ""dans les règles de l'art"" - how it's usually done. It The salad looked like it was for decoration, which shouldn't be the case at all. There should be a subtle combination of salad leaves and cheese on small slices of bread.For mains, we ordered two plates of duck confit, which was billed as ""forestier"" ( with mushrooms), accompanied by roasted vegetables and potatoes. The other member of our party ordered the steak tartare, which he was very pleased to be able to mix himself. Except that he had to wait for the Worcestershire sauce. The tartare was accompanied by fries and salad, and wasn't bad.The duck confit on the other hand was extremely disappointing. A leg of duck confit should be crispy on the outside and melt in the mouth when you bite into it. It wasn't. In terms of portions, it was great - there were two legs. But the skin wasn't at all crispy, and it was extremely salty. I was tempted to send it back but contented myself with simply letting the server know. On top of that, it was accompanied by one half of a large button mushroom (forestier, you say?), some difficult-to-identify ""roasted"" vegetables (blackened on the outside but crunchy - seeming to indicate they'd been cooked in a too-hot oven, too quickly), and what I can only describe as ""breakfast potatoes"".For dessert, we had two crème brûlées and a brownie. They were both pretty good, but the crème brûlée was taken straight out of the fridge. It should be served ""tiède"" - at least at room temperature, and possibly ever-so-slightly warm.The place has just changed hands apparently, so one might expect teething problems. However, I don't think I can give them a second chance unfortunately."

I would definitely recommend and go back here the next time I'm in Montreal.Side note: I've updated this review to clarify a few things (like my personal distaste for onions is in no means a reason to not go here - LOL), so I'm also going to do two things - update the stars, having remembered that that our server did go out of her way to answer a few extra questions about non-restaurant related things to two out-of-towners, and also because the interior decor was also a treat to the eyes (next time I'd like to sit in one of the other floors to take in even more of it!)"

/user_details?userid=M4CTQYlQOWEFLNx690iHYw,Michelle T.,"San Francisco, CA",2 star rating,"For our last dinner in Montreal, we wanted to go for some authentic, delicious French food that wouldn't break the bank. After many hours searching on Yelp (seriously), we found Les Deus Gamins, which had great reviews, good pictures and a menu with foods we though we'd really enjoy. Unfortunately, our night was ruined by how slow the food came out and the fact that they were completely unapologetic about getting our order wrong, not once, but TWICE. There was no wait on a Wednesday evening around 8pm we were seated almost immediately. There were 2 waiters serving about 8 tables, which didn't make us think it was overly busy.  We ordered a cheese plate to start and then each ordered an entrée. I went for the salmon tartar, which comes with sweet potato fries and a salad, and my boyfriend picked the duck confit, something we were both so excited to try. The cheese plate was nothing special. It had 3 different cheeses on it, but wasn't served with any crackers or bread. 30 minutes after we finished the cheese plate, my salmon entrée came out. We waited and waited...and waited for my bf's dish to come out so we could eat together, but another 30 minutes passed by before FINALLY they brought a dish out. It was clearly NOT duck. We flagged the server down and said we had ordered duck confit, NOT beef. He took a look at it, grabbed it, and brought it back into the kitchen without a word. At this point, my date and I were so hungry we decided we'd eat my dish together, then split his dish when it came. The dish itself was decent. The salmon was fresh and seasoned well. The sweet potato fries were cut extra thick and made to be soggy. Though I'd never eaten fries made THIS soggy before, I learned to appreciate it. Probably because I was so hungry.After the salmon was eaten, another 20 minutes had passed by. Our server came out with a big plate of salad topped with duck. We quickly pointed out that this was not what we ordered (there was NO duck salad on the menu whatsoever, so not sure where our server got his inspiration to bring us a duck salad). ""We ordered duck confit! It's the only duck entrée on the menu!"" Our waiter replied, ""This is duck."" ""Yes, but it's on a salad. Is this duck confit? Is this what's on the menu?""""It is duck salad."" ""Well, we ordered the duck confit.""""Ok...but if I change it now, it will take more time.""""We'd rather have what we ordered."" Waiter grabs dish again and storms back into the kitchen. At this point, I was stunned, upset, STARVING, dissatisfied and really just ready to up and leave. Either that, or take it up with the manager. However, my date and I decided this was our last night in Montreal, we wanted a romantic date night and didn't want to escalate things. Finally, the piping hot duck confit came out. Almost 2 hours after we placed our orders. We dived into the dish like two starving beasts. It was heavenly. The duck was absolutely delicious and the potatoes it came with were nothing short of perfect. When it came to paying, the waiter brought over their portable credit card payment system. He made NO apologies for all the multiple mistakes his team had made and didn't make any effort to compensate us for the terrible service we received. He then proceeds to ask, ""is 15% tip enough or would you like to tip more?"" If I could, I would have given NO tip. That was how bad the service was, instead, I sucked it up and said ""15% is fine."" Despite the perfectly cooked duck, I will never EVER EVER return to Les Deux Gamin again. I am sure there are French restaurants with delicious duck that are more professional and can guarantee much better service than the experience here."

I apologize to my 3 dining companions that I forced to eat here with me :( The good: The restaurant is pretty cute. There are 3 levels, including an al fresco dining area. The french onion soup was pretty darn tasty.The bad: All the other food. Escargot - fine. Salmon tartare - srsly? we had to add a crapload of seasoning to make this edible. Mussels - wayy too fishy, couldn't even taste the broth. Lamb and filet mignon - terribly terribly salty, yuck. The ugly: Our entrees took over 1.5hrs to come out, and the restaurant wasn't even full! We were so bored we started playing the Name Game while we waited, and my boyfriend bet my friend $1 for him to put pepper in his mouth, straight from the shaker. Yeah, we were that bored. The super ugly: My friend's veal scallops came out COLD! We initially thought maybe that's how the dish was supposed to be served? Wrong. The waitress informed us that it should be hot and took the plate back to the kitchen. 40 mins later, we were all done with our meal and we told them to just cancel the dish. Their response: It's right downstairs! They brought it back out after what we assumed was a quick reheat of the meat and it turned out to be completely bland and dry. Disgusting. They comped us for that one dish, but really though they should have comped us for the entire dinner. Most of it was either spent waiting for our food or trying very hard to eat our dishes. They only offered a mere apology AFTER we tried to flag down a waitress for our check for 15 mins and she asked ""how was everything?"" and was met with blank stares.

Located on a street that is closed to traffic, it was nice to sit outdoors, listening to a water fountain in the background and watching people walk and bike past the restaurant.

The servers were very attentive and friendly."
/user_details?userid=LB_dvaFy7Iv8RdLv4POYPQ,Marcus O.,"Alpharetta, GA",4 star rating,"being in montreal, i decided it was finally time to try a french restaurant. i have no standards of authenticity or any of those claims to stake down while i write this since this is my first and only time to have ever dined at a french restaurant (thus far.)i went on the recommendation of yelp reviews that i should try two things: french onion soup and mac and cheese (preferably with duck confit,) and thus i did.french onion soup: delicious. the whole thing was wonderful. i've had french onion soup before but not like this. i think particularly is was whatever kind of charred flavor was brought out by burning the cheese. it was pretty amazing though. i would have went back for this alone.mac and cheese w/ duck confit: it was like swimming through a sea of cream and pasta. it was so thick it could stand on it's own. the cheese on top was another 1000 calories of yum. i couldn't finish it though. it was far too rich and the serving, enormous. the duck confit on top was a nice touch -- a kind of dry yet savory morsel. went well with the m&c.also, i would recommend the warm goat cheese salad. good starter. seating is TIGHT despite the multiple floors of this place. getting here early might get you a seat, but the service goes down hill the busier it gets. there were only three in the waitstaff the night we were there. they were SLAMMED as in literally speed walking.tip: do not overload on the bread. the servings are american-sized portions."

Both were very good.As other reviewers commented, service was slow. However, I am convinced this is more of a cultural thing, rather than bad service. Going into the night, I made sure that when the waitress did come by, we let her know everything we wanted in advance.Overall, cute vibe, great location and food was good."

We took a seat beside the windows and this place screamed a ""cozy, date-y"" vibe. We ended up ordering their grilled flank steak with peppercorn sauce, and their grilled salmon florentine. The waiter was very pleasant and eager to explain to us everything on the menu. He was a delight. The criticism I have would be that wait was far too lonnngggg. It got to a point where we were stuffing ourselves with bread because we got so hungry from waiting. I would say expect around an hour for your food to be served. This was even more frustrating because the restaurant wasn't even that full. Regardless, when our food finally came, I have to say I was pretty please on my part. That peppercorn sauce puts the cherry on the steak and it certainly brought out nostalgic memories in my palette. The salmon was very light and fresh and a definite contrast to the steak. I would want to come back here to try out more of their menu. However, that excruciating long wait time would need some improvement."

Right near the bars and clubs, you can easily walk down the street and find a place to have fun after dinner. Also, the restaurant has a nice open air design which will allow you to enjoy the nice weather outside. The food here was very good overall. The salad was nothing amazing but the french onion soup was a must have. I had french onion soup earlier in the day that was the best I have ever had... this was just as good. I ordered the duck and potatoes. It was a good meal although the duck could have been a bit more moist, it may have been cooked just a minute longer than I would have preferred. I've had better duck other places. The potatoes it came with were outstanding. Now, the shocking part of the meal was one I didn't order. The mac and cheese here is hands down the best I've ever had. Mix the mac and cheese with the duck and you have one of the most surprisingly delicious things ever. Highly recommend the french onion soup and mac and cheese. Don't miss it."

One of us ordered the steak tartare and the waiter asked ""How would you like it cooked?"" Uhm... what? For some reason the person who ordered it said ""medium rare,"" adding to the confusion. I'm not entirely certain either person knew what a tartare was but considering the fact that tartare is a French word, I'm going to have to blame this on the waiter. We got the mix up cleared, but this contributed to our entrees taking around 45 minutes to arrive. And nobody around seemed désolé at all. Admittedly, it was kind of fun to practice the little bit of French we knew and try to mime the other things like ""Can you take a picture of us?"" and ""What is the cheapest red wine?"" Tourist problems.The main courses ended up feeling fattening without being especially flavorful. I have no lasting impressions of my own tartare other than that it needed a bit more salt and pepper. The steak frites and the duck confit both looked and tasted pretty standard. The ambiance, however, was very nice what with the completely open front facade and the fountain across the street. But in a place as vibrant as Montreal, I can't imagine this is the best French fare the city has to offer."

We are only beginning to learn French, so we're not very good at communicating yet. Our waiter spoke very little English, but he was patient with us and explained the menu very well, especially considering the language barrier. Neither of us have had a lot of experience with French food, so we were excited to try something new. I had the duck confit and he had some sort of duck ravioli (I can't remember exactly what it was called). His ravioli was delicious, but my confit was outstanding! It was buttery and so tender that it fell right off the bone. The hubby doesn't frequently like to share food, but after he tried mine, he probably ate about a fourth of it! For dessert, we ordered creme brûlée. It was wonderfully creamy, but not too sweet and perfectly crisp on top. We were seated by the window, so I was a little worried it would be cold. However, they had nice heaters on the floor right by the windows, so it was cozy. Not too cold! We had a great view of the quaint little neighborhood outside, so it was fun to people-watch while we chatted and ate.

/user_details?userid=w0ct-FJISvNJKYS22AWusQ,Brett S.,"San Antonio, TX",5 star rating,"What a WONDERFUL experience.First of all, the surrounding community is very charming. We sat out in the street, basically, which was perfect because of the ideal weather and the very European feel of the streets. As English speaking Americans, we were pleased to find how open to staff (and fellow guests) were to communicating with us in English. Some of them had to try a little harder than others, but everyone had an awesome and welcoming attitude. The service was second to none.First- the bread. You would think every shop in Montreal would have great French bread... but this is not always true. Les Deux Gamins had the best bread of our trip. We had the house salad to start with, which was stellar, fresh veggies, and unique flavors. It included kale, which I thought was impossible to like. Turns out, kale can be quite delicious. The special was lamb shank, which my girlfriend had. It fell off the bone (delicious) and was accompanied by perfectly cooked sides. I had the flank steak, a normal item on their menu, and it was also perfectly cooked. For most of the meal (which in total lasted 2 hours, because it was relaxed and food/conversation kept flowing) we spoke with the French ex-pat who was sitting beside us. Turns out she was a friend of the staff. She helped us interpret some aspects of the menu and select the perfect bottle of wine. By the end of the meal, we were too satisfied to consider a desert, so our waiter insisted on giving us a free yogurt/sorbet dish. It was possibly the best part of the entire meal. We could see why he insisted we try it. After such a heavy meal, the freshness of the fruit flavors was just the pick-me-up needed to trek back to the Metro.A few more words of the service: The chef went to great lengths to welcome us every time we came in contact. And, in addition to cheerful conversation with fellow guests and staff, our server at one point even helped my girlfriend and I convert our names into French. In total, it was a perfect two hours of working on our French, meeting new friends from around the world, and eating perhaps some of Montreal's finest French food."

/user_details?userid=JKQmuH6PKCDXpeZYK3BmnQ,Mister O.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The short version: Tasty food, decent martinis, top-shelf service;  naturally-shaded terrasse with low-key music so you can actually talk to people without sweating bullets and shouting at one another; and for dessert, they have *Armagnac*!Found out about this place because of an offhand comment on Yelp Talk.  Serendipitously found myself downtown with no plans for supper the same day.  Lurching in at 1800 on a Monday, had no trouble getting a choice little table on the street with a stellar view of the passing parade.Was immediately greeted by an exceedingly well-mannered curly-haired blonde girl from one of those European countries (Monaco?  Luxembourg?) where they still speak French straight from the dictionary. A 750ml bottle of water and a clean glass hit the table *before* she handed me a set of tracts describing the viands and elixirs on offer.  Big points for that;  it's terrasse weather, and people are walking around in the heat packing children, cameras, small domestic animals, and all manner of contraband ironmongery.  Being greeted with a big ration of water on arrival, on a hot day, says ""We're thinking about you.""  It also says ""Take a load off.  Drink your fill.  Stay a spell.""Well, I did, and I did, and I did.Ordered a gin martini with lemon to slurp on while I perused the menu.  Owner heard my order being given and hurtled up to ask if I preferred Bombay or Tanqueray. More points. Martini arrived (1) shaken, (2) large, (3) properly cold, and (4) served straight up in a proper cocktail glass. ONLY gripe about the martini was the lemon zests in it.  They were the tiny, 2mm-wide kind, the size of spruce needles, like one sees on fancy pastry. Problem with putting those in a cocktail is, you suck them up in every mouthful. Whereas, a single long, fat piece of rind the size of a healthy earthworm tends to stay in the bottom of the glass where it belongs, much like an olive. That's what the big tooth on the zester's for.The menu pitted my default ""order the steak-frites"" programmed response against my other default programmed response, ""if there's lamb on the menu, you're eating it.""  Consulted Miss Luxembourg, who very subtly suggested that while it was delicious, I might find the braised lamb shank a bit rich on such a summer evening, compared to the bavette aux échalottes. Went with the steak. Also requested her input on a glass of wine to go with it;  she very quickly got the message that I prefer robust, argumentative cuvées.  Thus was a goblet of purest, bare-knuckled fighting red from the Haut-Médoc added to my order.Bread barge came once I'd placed my order.  Bread was *hot*, which was good, because the butter was ice-cold.  Worked out well.  Decent bit of baguette, that.My plate arrived quickly: Steak, covered in caramelised échalottes or onions, fries, and a small pile of salad greens. The bavette was ordered medium and was cooked a bit on the well done side of as ordered. I didn't really mind. Its seasoning was delicious right out of the pan, and it needed nothing in the way of salt, pepper, or mustard. The fries were Woolworth's shoestring-thin, nicely golden, and tossed with a sufficient amount of salt. Meat and potatoes were both piping hot. The only letdown on the plate was the salad. The leaves looked tired, it had a few obvious wilts in it, and the dressing was a touch too sweet for my palate. I made everything disappear, though.Water carafe was bussed and replaced the very second I emptied it.  Miss Luxembourg and I shared a grin over that.  Bread barge was refilled with alacrity, as well. I was definitely kept an eye on. Again, points.After a decent interval, was offered a leer at the dessert menu. Asked what was on offer in the way of a digestif instead. Stunned and delighted to find Armagnac on the carte, I ordered a glass, along with an espresso.  The espresso, frankly, was as thin and hard as a fakir's mattress, but the quality of Armagnac these people pour made up for that.  It was such good stuff that I had another.  The bill later revealed it to be Tariquet VS, and pouring Tariquet as your bar Armagnac is like pouring Glenlivet as your bar scotch: not a mark of insanity, exactly, but evidence that you're serious enough to not offer the jet fuel that is St-Vivant.  (It tasted like Tariquet's VSOP, though. I think they grabbed a better bottle by accident.)Service did get a little less brisk as the evening wore on;  by 2000 hrs, as I was finishing my second digestif, the terrasse was about 85%- 90% full, and there were still only the one waitress and the owner wrangling the horde out front. Neither lady lost the plot at any time, though, despite the rush. Pros.Prices, of food, wine, and booze, were all completely reasonable, and given the genteel nature of the setting and the general quality of the service, were arguably a bargain.Men's room was clean, spacious, and usable.Very pleasant evening, in a nice setting.  I'd bring friends here."

As a vegan, I was concerned that I would have nothing to eat at a French restaurant, but the chef put together a fantastic meal for me, without a problem. My friends ordered the hangar steak and they both raved about it for the rest of the trip. If you are in Montreal, this restaurant is definitely well worth a visit!"

(I never eat outdoor in New York City where you inhale exhaust gas and consume your delicious food at the same time. What a waste.)I would have given it 4-star if the service was a bit faster.Yes, I am a New Yorker. But it was reeeeeeally slow (even by Canadian laid-back standard).It took them a good 15 minutes to notice that we don't have water and need a menu.It was getting late, so we decided to skip appetizer and go straight to main course.Good decision.The table next to us were seated before us. Their appetizers came after our main dish. We got our check and their dinner finally arrived despite their constant complaints.Service aside, the food is fantastic. The menu is small, but my husband and I both found our favorites. I had sea bass with quinoa and marinated zucchini."

My boyfriend loves this place and says it reminds him exactly of Paris. He always order the charcuterie plate- I do have to say, this is quite good. Usually I get the warm goat cheese salad which is also delicious. My issue is really with the main courses- I've ordered the flank steak a few times and it's always a really fatty piece of meat. The flavor gets lost because there is so much fat. I once had lamb shepherd's pie- that was really delicious, albeit heavy. The desserts also are just standard and not impressive. I'll be coming back because my boyfriend loves it so much, but on my own I don't think I'd return because it's nothing special."

/user_details?userid=Scn5jjBE8EjoFGbDrME_fw,Pierre-Frederic T.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"When I used to live in Montreal until 1994, rue Prince-Arthur was a succession of BYOB greek restaurants. There was also cheap Polish place Mazurka, which was a favourite of UQAM students for their lunch specials, as well as La Pizzaiolle, which started the whole "" pizza au four a bois"" craze from the late 80s on. Fast forward to 2014. Some of the old stalwarts are still going strong and some even have become chains: La Cabane Grecque, La Casa Grecque, La Maison, La Shack, Le Garage, etc...Prince-Arthur still is a very touristy pedestrian strip, yet you see signs that serious restaurateurs who care about real quality and tradition are setting up shop in the area.At 170 Prince-Arthur East, Les Deux Gamins is a French ""bistro""(more like a restaurant to me, the bistro being the diner of France) that serves a lot of classics, all the while giving them their own personalized touch. Service is very friendly and efficient but non-intrusive. A few tables are set outside for those who want to dine al fresco, while the restaurant itself has a very warm, classic decor.My guest and I visited on the evening of Saturday, July 26th.She had the feuilleté d'escargots as a first course($9). It was delicious. Cream, garlic, mushrooms, butter, flaky puff pastry and glorious snails on a bed of greens. Absolutely heavenly. I ordered a gaspacho ($6, you know, the Spanish version of a Vichyssoise).Although it did not have the kick I expected( i.e. garlicky) it had a hint of garlic, cucumbers, some tomato, nice herbs, overall a very refreshing and palate opening course. For mains, we had duck confit a l'orange($26) and a steak tartare ($24). The duck dish is the best of both worlds: the unctuousness and awesome taste of a great duck confit with the delicate aroma and slightly citrusy flavour of a canard a l'orange. A truly satisfying offering with a memorable side dish of sauteed vegetables. These were so good as my guest said, that they could be ordered as a dish of their own. My steak tartare was very fresh and tasty, made from top round Boston cut. Some will say this dish lacked flavour, that usually a steak tartare has more spice and more zyng. But to me, this steak tartare had just enough seasoning. Not too salty or too spicy and you could truly taste the beef. Why mask the taste if you want raw meat? A true delight. Not sure if the beef is organic, but I would not be surprised. The frites were really tasty and so was the side green salad that had a very pleasant classic vinaigrette sauce.We could not do dessert. The portions at Les Deux Gamins are huge: lots of steak tartare, 2 duck legs. Reminds me of San Diego, where even great fine dining establishments do not leave you hungry at the end of your meal.They serve my aperitif (Ricard pastis) and have a French only wine list. We had a fillette (a 3 glass carafe) of Saint-Emilion ($22) and it was a fine match to our meal.I liked the friendly touch of a complimentary extra glass of wine right after I had paid the bill.The team at Les Deux Gamins really enjoy what they do. They are very nice. The prices are normal and considering the quality of the food and the location, this place is really a gem. Please go and try them out, you will not regret it."

The major problem this place has, as highlighted by other users, is the service. Our waiter was helpful, knew his menu quite well, but was ultimately overall slow and couldn't properly help a whole floor by himself AKA understaffed. Our reservation was for 8:30, the first sight of our waiter was at 9:00, unacceptable in restauration. Entrées came out under a decent time, but our dishes came out at 10:30, which in itself is outrageous.Overall the experience was OK. Blatantly understaffed restaurant with mediocre service, probably in the bottom 5 compared to all the other restaurants I've been around in Montreal.

We were four adults and ate at the restaurant on a very quiet Monday evening in mid-September. The restaurant is located in a very nice little pedestrian area just off Sherbrooke; good people watching. They have a nice seating area outside, but we ate inside as it was a bit chilly. A cool Monday may have contributed to the sparse crowd, but we did eat at 6:30.Everything that we had was very good (including best bread we ate in Canada). We started with Escargot in Puff Pastry and Foie gras with roasted black figs. For our entrees we had the Duck confit l'orange and vegetables and the Filet mignon, mushroom sauce and truffle oil, boulangere potatoes and we had a creme brulee to polish of the meal. Accompanying our meal we had the Seguin-Manuel Bourgogne ""Pinot Noir"", which was a terrific companion to all that we ate. Everything was excellent and very satisfying, although the dessert didn't have the hard carmelized top we're used to. Escargot was pretty light, foie gras was rich and buttery, the duck had a delectable orange syrup that enhanced the richness of the meat and the filet was fork tender. An excellent meal at a lovely little restaurant.We are from Texas, so not too likely we'll be in the neighborhood any time soon, but if we are, this will definitely be the first restaurant on the list!"

To start we had a cream of parsnip & eggplant soup topped with a dollop of creme fraiche. The perfect begining as the temperature had plumeted that day. This was followed by a tomato, bocconcini cheese salad with roasted shallots dressed in a light vinaigrette - very flavourful. The escargots and mushroom dish infused with garlic was complemented with a wedge of puff pastry - a nice touch.  The perfectly cooked filet mignon atop garlic mashed potatoes was accompanied by roasted carrots & broccolini. Dessert was an interesting choice. A dark, dense chocolate (almost fudge-like) cake served on a pool of warmed caramel sauce garnished with popcorn!  Our wonderful meal was capped off with a glass of port.Our knowledgable waiter recommended some great pairings from their private importation wine list which we found well priced.During the course of the evening we learned that this was a brand new menu from the brand new Chef. Originally from southern France, and more recently from the reputable Chuck Hughes restaurant Garde Manger. Throughout the evening he ventured from the kitchen to speak with patrons- something you see far too little of in Montreal restaurants.Aside from updating the menu, we were advised that further improvements/changes are in the works. I feel any & all will add much to this establishment. I look forward to returning to see how the restaurant evolves."

We split an entree that was the special that night, I believe it was leg of lamb, expertly seasoned with sweet potatoes, onions and other delicious garnishes. I'd say it was the perfect amount of food for two.

The service was great and the restaurant itself was very accommodating considering it was a Saturday and we didn't have a reservation.

The Service The servers are extremely friendly and the food is great. They can be a little slow with taking orders but I guess that's because they were understaffed since the shift was changing. Anyway, we stopped by for lunch and they offered a great selection of traditional french dishes. The beef tartare, anchioves and olives were great.

At 6pm on a Saturday, our group of 7 entered the almost empty restaurant. The lights were dim and we were served by a friendly waiter.The menu isn't too extensive, but the items on the menu aren't the common ones you'll find everywhere. I opted for the duck confit and tried some of the beef tartare. Just a note - you can get a french onion soup and a glass of house wine if you check in on Foursquare ONLY on Mondays - Thursdays from 5pm - 10pm. They budged a little for us. We had 3 check-ins but they were able to give us 1 special.The french onion soup was delicious. Under a thick layer of baked cheese, you'll find plenty of onions, bread and a flavorful, spiced onion soup. This soup is perfect for a chilly day/night.The duck confit was good. I wouldn't say it's too out of the ordinary. It's not my first time having duck and the way it was cooked was just like any other duck I would have. You'll find that the sliced potatoes on the side are much more interesting. They weren't too tough or soft - I enjoyed them more than the main itself. The beef tartare that I tried was good. It wasn't too spicy but the portion was huge. If I wanted beef tartare, I would opt for the appetizer instead. Overall, dinner wasn't too expensive and we all came out full.

They also have a nice wine list and are great for recommendations. And once dinner is over, the restaurant is centrally located in the City. A nice evening stroll after this filling dinner is a great combination."
/user_details?userid=pV9UEEeLNPm4uz-nbHF09w,Peter K.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"Food was great but as some have mentioned, the food take days to come out.  When we were seated the menu and the water were placed there immediately. However from then on, everything was just agonizingly slow.  The waitress didn't ask for orders till 10mins after we seated. The bread basket didn't come out till 15mins after that. Our starter came out more than 30mins after order and our entrees took more than a full hour.  As we were being starved to death i noticed it was the same on other tables. The restaurant was not even full!  I was there on July 12th, and any efforts to speed up the orders was just lip service.  An aspect of being a good restaurant is the pace of service and this place fails on that end."

We are wine snobs, but our server was patient and willingly allowed us to sample a couple wines each. We started off with escargot and French onion soup. Both choices were a hit. Main course choices: lamb and duck confit!  Both dishes were superb (seasoned and cooked to perfection)!  Dessert: creme brûlée. Another excellent choice we shared."

It was meant for a celebration of my boyfriend's birthday. I had learned about this place through yelp and was looking forward for it. The service was amazing, very fast and efficient. The place very nice. The decoration and the tables make you feel as if you are having diner in a neighborhood in Paris.The Prince Arthur street is to visit.The food was good overall and well priced. We ordered saumon tartare and chorizo calamari as appetizers. The saumon tartare was so fresh and the chorizo calamari was full of flavors. Totally recommend both apperizers.As a main meal. We ordered the risotto with prosciutto and the confit de canard. While the risotto was very tasty, unfortunately the confit de canard was a bit dry and the potatoes very oily.For desserts, we ordered the mi-cuit chocolate and the raspberry meringue cakes.The mi-cuit chocolate cake was out of this world. We weren't impressed with raspberry cake.   Totally recommend people to visit this place and enjoy the experience."

Charcuterie et fromage was wonderful start. Kids shared the French onion soup, which was excellent. Hubby enjoyed their soup du moment, which was a celery/melon gazpacho. My duck confit was tender and flavorful, the kids shared the hangar steak (which I stole many pieces of), but I think hubby's sea bass was the best entree of the night. Tender, moist, yet crispy. Amazing.  The crime brûlée was fought over by the kids (ok. And me too). Hubby had the pineapple flambé. That wasn't my taste, but it was done beautifully and the kids ooh'ed and aah'ed over the presentation. Expensive night, but worth the splurge."

This is also one of the rare places on prince Arthur that isn't BYOW, and they have a decent selection of wines."
/user_details?userid=4nfJXm-V6gWTF7koXJLVuA,Janet N.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"We visited Les Deux Gamins with a large group (18 people) for whom we had allowed them to choose a restricted menu. They were able to seat us and even to give us a designated room, which was great. Unfortunately we were seated in an awkward ""L"" shape. If we went again we would ask for a group of tables in a designated space. First, I should say that this place can offer a very nice set of choices for a large group at a very reasonable price. I'd like to go back and try the full menu, especially since at this price point it's easy to do.For the vegetarian in our group (a sad thing to be when French food is involved, but it happens!) they weren't able to offer him anything other than gratineed zucchini, which he found too rich to eat much of, and roasted vegetables, which he said were good, but it's too bad they didn't really have a vegetarian meal (with protein of some sort) to offer. I had the green salad (which I regretted because my entree came with more of the same salad - should have gone for the soup, which was apparently very good) and the duck confit. This was disappointing for me as one of my favourite parts of duck confit is the nice, crispy skin, which this did not have. Instead the skin was gelatinous and so I sadly pushed it aside. The duck underneath was still delicious, though (how could it not be?) and the potatoes were outlandishly buttery and therefore quite good. For dessert I had the creme brulee, which was good but not freshly torched for the full crispy and warm on top, cool and creamy underneath experience, which always makes me a little sad.If you only had one dinner in Montreal this isn't what I would recommend but for the money, this is a good little restaurant. Nothing outstanding but you definitely won't regret a visit."

/user_details?userid=G422ejyfziG2xOtqgyKDWg,Didier N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I was pleasantly surprised by this French bistro. Most of the restaurants on Prince-Arthur are overpriced tourist traps. However, Les Deux Gamins was fairly reasonably priced. Keep in mind tho that it is not a BYOW place like a lot of the other restaurants nearby.As for the food, fairly standard French fares: steak tartare, steak frite, lamb shank etc. No surprises or modern twists but this is sometimes what I'm looking for.The kitchen lost our ticket for our appetizers. However they made it up with a full bottle of house wine. In all, there are better French Restaurants in Montreal. However, you could do a whole lot worse than eat here"

Speaking no French, the waiters were super helpful, especially with the wine menu. Ended up with an organic Cab Franc that was medium bodied, slightly dry and rich with dark fruit. Wish we had let it breathe a bit more to really open up. We shared the duck rillette and foie gras. Both were tasty, good sized portions.  My wife had the flank steak which was perfectly cooked and flavorful, and I had the Mac & quack. I have to agree with my fellow Yelpers here. This was the BEST mac & cheese I have ever tasted, even before adding the duck. Couldn't finish it because it was so rich but put up a good fight. I checked in on Yelp and got a free desert sampler for it! Tastiest apple pie I have had in a good while, along with dark chocolate mousse, ice cream and a tiny creme brulee. The perfect finish to a divine meal. We will definitely be back!"

I can tell this restaurant has a lot of pride in their food and doesn't usually have these types of mishaps, and I appreciate that they took this seriously. Given the other glowing reviews, I think our experience was an outlier, and I would recommend you to try Les Deux Gamins and of course, let the management know if anything isn't up to par. It seem that they'll do their best to make it right."

We were just visitors to Montreal and were looking for fine food but with a relaxing atmosphere. The food is divine and not too expensive! I ordered the duck confit, DH ordered the lamb shank. Both great! The soup of the day was a cold soup and suits the hot day very well. The duck confit comes with a squash sauce, just PERFECT. Not too salty not too sweet, just a little bit. The lamb shank comes with mushrooms and mashed potato, the combination is just divine. We sat outside in the sunset, with music performers just across the street. It's a memorable night. The waiters are very busy but they are cute with a French accent."
/user_details?userid=9r4BOJeqGFn-TabsqTGcBg,Mike L.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"This place was absolutely perfect. Granted it was a beautiful evening, there were street performers playing some wonderful music against the background of a small fountain, and the street was alive with people, but the restaurant really made the evening. We were seated outside, but the street where it is located is closed to traffic, so it's very calm and relaxed. People watching here is half the fun. The restaurant itself is a classic French bistro, serving well known items like fois gras and a charcuteries board as well as some unique dishes like the steak tartare with fries and salad. I had the duck confit, which was a little over-done but very well flavored. Prices are a little on the high side, but the quality of the food and the ambiance are worth it. They have their own ""vin du maison,"" which is cheaper than the other bottles and is served in un-labeled wine bottles. We had the white and it really is a perfect table wine, just right. They also serve Ricard here, and as soon as I saw that I was immediately transported back to France. Items on the menu have English translations and the wait staff is bi-lingual enough that your high school French will get you by. Long story short: if you're looking for an incredibly romantic evening, go here."

The foie gras with mango chutney was a nice start to my meal, which also included the Duck Confit, complete with potatoes fried in, what else, but even more duck fat! The house white was quite good, and a bargin at that. My girlfriend enjoyed her Cod, cooked to perfection in a foil packet, with a savory lemon butter sauce. The dessert sampler was very well done, with a selection of delectable sweets, and was easily splittable. The location further enhanced the meal, with incredibly talented street musicians playing throughout the two plus hours we spent enjoying our meal. The server was very polite and knowledgable to boot! I would definitely return, the next time I find myself in Montreal."

The duck was good as well, I only had one bite, but she told me her dish was good too. For dessert, we had the lava cake. The cake part didn't have much taste. Not impressed. Service was good.

We both chose the seared foie gras and the duck.  Our server suggested the complete dinner that would include both plus dessert.  We agreed.  The foie gras was seared delicately and finished with finely sliced and toasted pieces of a baguette.  The duck crispy and tender.  We were not rushed, but our server watched for any need.We will make Les Deux Gamins a definitive stop on our next Montréal visit."

On top of it all, the restaurant is located on a quaint street good for people watching. Especially if you want to try something different than Old Town. We felt that compared to many of the places we looked at that this was very reasonably priced Appetizer, steak with sides, and a bottle of wine for about $80."

The waiter recommended the steak and the orange duck, both of which we tried and were happy with. For dessert, we got a complimentary creme brulee with a yelp check-in (thanks, yelp!). The food was good and tasty, but nothing to die for or crave-worthy. But paired with exceptional service and a comfortable relaxing atmostphere, this place gets 4 stars in my book!

FIrst of all great deal of an additional $12 to include an appetizer and dessert. We started off with a fantastic suggestion for beer: the Grimberggen. Soo good. For the appetizer, my friend and I split the escargot and foie gras. The escargot was absolutely delicious; it really was something else. It was cheesy, smooth, and flavorful. It was as if God was being ironic by making such a grimy creature so delicious. It was the first time having foie gras, so I didn't know what to expect. But it was fatty, creamy, and had a subtle gamy flavor. For the main, I had the salmon tartar which was unexpectedly seasoned quite a lot, but was incredibly tasty. Salmon is sooo good. Well portioned too.  Then the dessert: Mi Cuit au Chocolat. Melting chocolate inside a muffin shaped chocolate cake served with ice cream. Out of this world. The meal ended with an espresso and a complimentary shot from the waitress. She definitely liked us. A French-Canadian summit of flavors was delectably orchestrated in front of me that night."

Salmon tartar as an entree or main dish was uniquely delicious. I had duck confit which was both crispy yet moist, perfectly cooked. Others in the party enjoyed veal stew not leaving a bite. Not to go on and on deserts were all fantastic. The wait staff were open and friendly but maybe not too attentive, no problem, we talked and laughed and were not pressured.

The dauphinois potatoes on the side were cheesy, garlicy and a perfect accompaniment--so good! Husband had the herb crusted lamb with sweet potato purée. The portion of lamb was generous and cooked to perfection and the purée blended so well with the meat.For dessert, we shared a cream brûlée which was creamy and delicious, as well as a chocolate lava cake. This cake was warm and had wonderful chocolate flavor without being too sweet.The only downside to our meal was returning to our car to find a $52 parking ticket. Not being from here, we didn't know that you couldn't park on the side streets. We asked people if parking was allowed and they said yes in the evening.

/user_details?userid=vL-7Z3rtMYLbY-L7Xd0JAw,Jim R.,"Minneapolis, MN",4 star rating,"After a very long, circuitous walk (my own stupid fault) we finally arrived at this cute French bistro just outside the university district. We sat just inside from their outdoor patio and enjoyed a shrimp risotto and pepper steak on a beautiful summer evening. Worlds from the crowds of the old town and just the respite we needed after a long day of sightseeing. Prices are really reasonable -24$ for a perfectly cooked fillet with a decent wine list. Definitely worth seeking out - thanks fellow yelpers for the guidance."
/user_details?userid=Wb5Gs_FpWDYjrhn0luPd3A,Janel Y.,"Walnut Creek, CA",4 star rating,"Came here because the original place I wanted to dine at is closed for remodeling so I logged onto Yelp and decided to try this place since it's walking distance from where I'm staying.Prince Arthur Street is a quaint little street to grub on or to grab some drinks. When the weather is nice, the restaurants put out the tables and chairs and you can dine on the street, just as if you were in a European country.At around 8:30 PM we headed out for dinner and the place was packed. They asked if we had a reservation and we didn't, but it didn't seem to matter since there was room on the second floor. Once we were seated and given our waters and bread basket, here's the lo-down of what was ordered:-amuse bouche (chicken fennel pate): delicious!-escargots: tried it before and not my fave so didn't try it here-onion soup: two small pieces of bread in the sop and the beef broth was not at all salty. There was just the right amount of melted cheese as well.-salmon tartar: fresh, served chilled and tasty-hanger steak in shallots sauce with salad and fries ($18): the meat was cooked exactly as stated and the fries were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The salad was tasty...I think they added some type of seasoning to the dressing?-apple and sage chicken leg ($16): soft, moist chicken leg that fell off the bone and served on top of corkscrew pasta-classic creme brulee: I felt that the sugar top could have been harder and the cream part a bit too creamy for me.-lemon meringue tart: a definite must get! It was tangy and sweet and light as a feather!-petit pot crémeux au chocolat: small pot of semi-sweet chocolate mousse. It was okay.The food was of high quality here and the portions are quite large...definitely a good bang for your buck. The beef and chicken dishes didn't have a whole lot of flavor, but I've noticed food in Montreal is not as salty and heavily flavored with MSG like in the States. In any case, there's always salt and pepper on the table.We decided to go with the ""add $10 to your main course and you can choose one appetizer and one dessert"" which made your meal like a prix-fixe dinner and still pretty reasonable. We also ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir ($45) which ended up being the expensive part of the meal, but a lot of restaurants in Montreal will let you BYO wine and they'll open it for you (don't know what the corkage fee is).The ambiance is nice and authentically French. Our water didn't speak much English but we had no problem ordering. The menu is in both French and English. It's a 3 story restaurant and the place was quite crowded with the 3rd floor being reserved for a private party, the 2nd floor open (where we dined) and the street level full with diners inside and outside on the street.Service was quite leisurely and I'm still trying to figure out if that's because it was busy (only 2 servers for the entire place) or if it's a European thing. The only thing I didn't quite like was one of ladies who I first encountered when asking if they had a table for 3 available. Lucky for her the rest of my dining experience made up for that encounter."

We had the red and it was surprisingly good (it's light and smooth). Fillet Mignon was done the way we asked it to be - medium rare. The duck was cooked really well - and it's a generous portion of 2 duck legs. Good to share. I will miss the onion soup here!"

/user_details?userid=ZCVEZmTB_StK-UXA3WPVlQ,Zanna H.,"Philadelphia, PA",2 star rating,"Over-rated. While the place itself is charming with three floors of seating in an old building. The food was disappointing. The descriptions make it sounds wonderful like it will be a delight on the tongue, but it was seriously lacking seasoning. How does something contain duck fat and have no flavor? Husband got the cassoulet which had everything in it, duck confit, sausage, ham, beans in duck fat... sounds like it should taste good no? Well the beans were under cooked and there was no flavor. A dash of salt an pepper in the prep would have done wonders. All of our diners followed this same trend. The service was just ok at best with our waitress forgetting our table a few times due to the larger group she was managing. This I would have overlooked but also she hovered over my shoulder while using the handheld credit card payment reader. I mean literally watching the screen and pointing so as to force a tip. The display is in English a language to which I am native and fluent and though I am from the US this does not make me a moron. I hate this and it is bad form. I understand if you don't want to leave the card reader thing unattended, what would I do with it if I stole it? Seriously. But just take a respectful two or three steps back from the table. Let the person have some small illusion of privacy. Hovering like a vulture over someone's shoulder is rude."

The staff was running around the place like crazy. We started with the goat cheese salad, but the cheese was Brie (although the owner tried to assure us it was goat...no way!). Main course was file mignon....I know my steaks and that was at best a sirloin (bad quality sirloin). Well cooked but very chewy and not edible! The other course was an overlooked sole, tasted fresh, but very overlooked. Surprised by the 4-star Yelp rating. Disappointed this was our last dinner in MTL.

How? How does that happen together?! Don't know, but it did.  Hubby a flank streak with pomme frites, I went skirt steak- not too exciting of us, I know.  But still, A Table made these simple selections delicious- both steaks were perfectly done and the french fries that could have been boring-weren't.  Afterwards, we strolled along the street towards Louis Square, which had really interesting architecture- all around great evening.  Highly recommend."

We brought our 13 year old daughter and we shared French Onion soup that was milder than I am used to, which is now my favorite. We tried Salmon, lamb, and steak tartare, and all were prepared perfectly. Ben and his girl, as he describes her, are sweet and very personable and certainly enhance the dining experience.

We both wanted a salad meal, something light but tasty, my husband had the salad Nicose, it looked like a picture, the perfectly grilled tuna was outstanding. I had the salad with duck confit that too was very nicely done, great balanced dressing.

It was fantastic!!! Imagine a cute little ""Creuset-esque"" pot served to you and inside the most moist, fall off the bone chicken and a bed of tasty egg noodles underneath, cushioning the juicy tenderness!Rewind...I started off with the Goat Cheese, Nut and Honey salad, and after my first bite I really thought nothing could top that, it sounds pretty simple, but a hint of honey with goat cheese really works for me!! I sat there and said I could just have this salad and be happy... Im glad that I didn't stop there, because this was a meal that will make me remember that night for a while.Dessert was a mi-cuit chocolate cake (similar to a lava cake, I suppose) and it was rich and decadent!

For entree, he had the flank steak while I got the duck confit. Oh my, my duck confit was cooked to perfection. Just the right amount of flavor and the meat is falling off the bone tender. I really liked it that the entree also came with a salad which helped cut down the richness of the meal. I am normally not a fan of potatoes (except for fries) but the scalloped potato accompanied with the meal was just out of this world. I ate every piece of it. Portion size is generous.

The food was, at best, passable. Barely so. My husband started with gazpacho, which ended up being the best thing we had. It had a bit too much vinegar, but was otherwise tasty. For dinner, I got moule frites. More than a quarter of my mussels were completely closed (ie not fresh) and the ones that were open had a fishy taste and often tore to shreds as I removed them from the shell. I think they may have been steamed for way too long or maybe just old. I stopped eating the mussels halfway through because I got a mussel that was so fishy that I got worried I'd get food poisoning. The broth was ok, but nothing special. My husband got grilled salmon with ratatouille. It looked delicious, but the fish was dry and the ratatouille was flavorless. In general, the food was under seasoned (the people at the table next to us seemed to agree). We tried profiteroles for dessert. The sauce (a warm dark chocolate) was good but the profiteroles were soooo chewy and cold. Not room temperature cold ... Like not fully defrosted cold ...Sadly, I can't recommend this place.

You can find this at many restos these days and its usually not very interesting, but this one was great swimming in  rich dark chocolate and not super sweet. My meal was accompanied by a glass of really nice house Pinot Noir. My bill was around $40 before tax and tip. On my other visits the Duck Confit and the Salmon pave were stand outs. The Duck was succulent and crispy. The salmon was cooked perfectly with the skin nicely charred. The place is friendly and unpretentious. There are many places in Montreal with food that more decorously plated, but they are often more than twice as expensive and and not good as Les Deux Gamins."

HarHar. My friends and I decided to go on an impromptu vacation to Montreal because, one, the drinking age there is 18, and two, Montreal is awesome! We came across this tiny restaurant on a cobblestone street after climbing Mont Royale in the snow. Bad decision-making, but unforgettable experience. Anyways, we were cold, tired, and hungry, and decided to run into the first warm and appealing restaurant we could find. We all ordered the French Onion Soup ($8.50) to start our meal, and I have to say, it really hit the spot. They have beer on tap; my friends ordered a beer and rum and coke, and I got the Vespa--the house drink with fizzling happiness. After the wonderful starters of soup and alcohol, we moved on to the entrees. I remember that we weren't as satisfied with the quality of the main dishes. I got the chicken and mushroom risotto; my friend got the chicken stew--the chicken in the two dishes were overcooked to the point of being inedible. I thought the risotto was cooked very well, though. My other friend got the flank steak and said that it would have better if they had used quality steak. Dessert was satisfying. I got to try mini-versions of the most popular desserts: the creme brulee, the chocolate mousse, and unfortunately, I cannot remember the last one. While the entrees were not as satisfying as the ambiance, the starters, the dessert, or the alcohol, it was still an okay experience. The prices were very good, especially if you decide to add an appetizer and dessert to your entree for $12. The waitresses are very nice and the place itself is gorgeous. We went here after a three-hour dinner at a very nice steakhouse the night before, so we had high expectations. Les Deux Gamins met the expectations, but it was missing an element of surprise--that bang that makes food so much more interesting and delicious."

I had read all of the great reviews about Les Deux Gamins and so I decided to call and ask if they could take a reservation for 17 people. Benoit answered the phone and was right away super helpful and accommodating with my request with all kinds of ideas to make it a great evening. When we arrived on the D-Day around 5:30 pm to make sure everything was ready for our 8:30 pm dinner, our (huge) table was already set up in the upstairs room (where the bar is located) separate from the rest of the restaurant. Benoit also set up bar tables so that everyone could network standing up before we start eating. It was a great idea and the appetizer food was AMAZING! It was this gigantic plate of pate, salami, cheese, bread wooden board (I wish I had taken a picture!).Then we sat down and started with dinner. Benoit (the other Benoit, le Chef) prepared dishes to share: lamb shank, duck confit, foie gras, escargots, and much more. They offered some real tasty red wine to go with the food. For dessert, he made some wonderful Profiterolles! Enough said, this dinner was the best experience (in every way) ever!! Les Deux Gamins sont fantastiques and I HIGHLY recommend you to try it!

The atmosphere wasn't peasant French, it was casually sophisticated without being over the top from trying too hard. The waitress explained in detail 4 different dishes to a reluctant decider in our party, and betrayed no impatience at all. The wine selection was suitable to the dishes served. The portions of meat may seem small to an American (like myself), but these are not small portions in France which is sort of what you go to a French restaurant for, right? The prices are not cheap, but are appropriate to the service, atmosphere, and food quality. Sidebar; the fries are fantastic, thin crispy and fluffy."

My father owned an Italian bread bakery throughout my life, so I know good bread. This bread was brick-oven baked for certain and was fresh from the morning. It was delicious! We asked for a second basket! Then we ordered some drinks, which were nothing to write home about. Lastly, I got a salad with warm goat cheese, which was great if you like goat cheese!

To us this was more of a 3.5.As we would say in French, this was ""BMPT"" for ""bien mais pas top"", or ""good but not great"".Overall the food was decent, certainly not bad but also nothing to rave about (especially in a city with great food in general such as Montreal), and the service was also nice but not outstanding. Prices are acceptable for what is delivered.The decor is quite nice, typical bistro style with the same chairs and tables as one would find in Paris. They go a bit ""over the top"" with old-school French music (my grandparents' generation).I would say the food was very reflective of that atmosphere: it is comparable to an 'average' Parisian bistro that one would find at any corner.During the meal, they turned on the chemney (actual wood fired one, not gas) and the room had a nice small, it was very homey.We shared the salmon tartare for starter, which was fresh and really nicely done.Then we had the beef tartare (main course size) with french fries. I have to say the beef was high quality and very fresh. The seasoning could have been a little better, your typical French beef tartare would have more worcestershire sauce, capers and cornichons. To be fair, they offered to have me prepare it at the table rather than the chef, but I took my chances. The French fries were very crunchy, which I enjoyed, but the oil they had been cooked in certainly could have been a little fresher.We also had the scallops with rice and coconut.

We started with a couple orders of  the calamari which I figured was fried but was not, being a fairly picky eater I immediately was turned off but then figured I would give it a try and I am glad i did because it was excellent, cooked very well and the sauce it was in added some great flavor and also served as a great sauce to dip the fresh warm baguette in (another great).Between the table of 6 a few of guys had the filet, I had the Duck confit and another had the bone in Lamb shank. By far the best dish was the Lamb, it had a ton of flavor and the meat fell right off the bone, the Filets were pretty good as well cooked perfectly. The duck was also very good but i just felt that it could have used some more spices to bring out some more flavors, but the potato's that it came with were very good and the small salad was also a nice little touch. A few of us had some expresso after dinner so a few also tried out the desert, we got the chocolate lava cake with the carmel ice cream which was awesome, the ice cream was a nice touch and changed up the flavor from the standard vanilla. The person that got the chocolate mousse said that he expected it to be a little lighter as it was a little firm but that could be the way it was intended to be prepared.

Nothing against the soup here, I've just realized that I can't handle such large proportions of cheese. :'(. This is how I felt about poutine too...anyway, the soup was great for dipping the baquette slices :). The duck confit with scalloped potatoes fried in duck fat wins cheat meal of the year. It was too delicious for its own good! I also had a fillete de vin rouge, which was great. The creme brulee was too dense for my taste...I prefer smoothier and more delicately textured.

Potatoes burnt.  The crock of onion soup was too sweet.  Veal flank was tough and chewy - my wife's jaw hurt afterward. Total tourist trap. If you like good food, don't get sucked in to this sham."

They were zingy tasting.  And  the chocolate desert was to die for.   I met many interesting Yelpers and I was proud to tell the Montrealer all about our organization  Friends for Mental Health.  I am planning to go there for dinner some time soon."

We were recommended by a waiter at Gabardine (Toronto) to eat at Au Pieds Au Cochon and we couldn't get a seat there so jumped on Yelp and found Les Deux Gamins. Fantastic and great to share with my 2 daughters as they mentioned (often) that they would like to eat at ""one of the restaurants that Mom and Dad go to"". The waitress ( I think she owned the joint) was really pleasant and helpful (""cough"" unlike the lady on the phone at Au Pieds De Cochon telling us she was sold out that evening). Classic french decor from the black and white tiled floor to the seats and small round tables. Short but very tempting menu with a decent wine choice and how can you go wrong with $18 House Red which was lovely? Starters we had the Fois Gras, Beet Carpaccio, French Onion soup and Chicken Pastry all of which were delicious - Emily stated that the soup was The Best French Onion Soup She's Ever Had and that was after her return from Paris where she had the French Onion Soup to end all French Onion Soups. OK so I thought there might be a little more to the Beet Carpaccio but there's me and beets - can't not order them not matter how they're served! But I was saving room for the Duck Confit with Saladaise Potatoes. ""What are Saladaise Potatoes?"" I asked. ""They're sliced potatoes fried in Duck Fat"" ""Then I'll have that then please."" Fantastic stuff every mouthful was lovely from the crispy skin of the duck to the delectable potatoes. Oh yeah some greens cos you've got to. Afterwards a cheese platter and then the Apple Tatin (Apples cooked upside down with a glazed bottom) washed down with a great espresso and the wine of course. SO happy to share this with my girls and just a super evening all in all. If I'm ever back in Montreal I'll be back again to sample the other delights. Just goes to show you that you don't have to have a menu as long as a novel and you don't have to serve enough food to stuff a small whale to make for a great evening's dining experience - something to think about America!"

First off, the place is set in a little pedestrian-only cobblestone street that makes you feel like you're right in the middle of Paris. As we walked in we were greeted by a very friendly waitress that spoke mostly French, but understood English. She seated us, as another very nice waitress greeted us at our table. Their was nothing bad on the menu. Great traditional French food done to perfection. They have an awesome deal where you can add 12$ to the price of your main dish for an appetizer and a dessert.To begin our gargantuan meal, the baguettes were ah-maz-ing. For appetizer, my group had the beet carpaccio, the french onion soup, fois gras, and I had the chicken pastry. The beet carpaccio was a little bland, but if you love beets, you'll love this simple dish. A hearty earthy flavor. One of the people in our group had just come back from Paris, and she said that the French onion soup was better than any other onion soup she'd had in France. The chicken pastry was great, very complimenting to the basil puree around the dish. it was essentially a light chicken salad with mushrooms and chives with some filo dough pieces on top. The fois gras was delectable! Sweet and delicious, it was served on a crustini. For our main, 3/4 of us had the duck confit with salardaise potatoes. The dish is basically duck, braised in it's own fats and thinly sliced potatoes, fried in the same duck fat. And a small salad on the side.....moving on. The last person of our group had the filet mignon with dophinois potatoes. We asked for medium, and the filet was a little overdone for that, but delicious all the same. The dophinois potatoes were like a gratin, VERY garlicky.As if it couldn't get any better, dessert was next. We went traditional French and had the cheese plate after our main. The plate had 3 cheeses, 2 creamy ones and 1 harder one. The 2 creamy ones were brie and a strong goat cheese. The last cheese might have been a gyuere but I could not recognize it. It was also served with dried apricots which perfectly accompanied the brie on a baguette slice. My group ordered the creme brulee, the tarte tartin, and 2/4 of us had the chocolate volcano cake that was heavily recommended. The creme brulee was delicious. Creamy, eggy, and the perfect crunchy sweet top. The tarte tartin was an upside-down apple pie with a caramelized bottom. The granny-smith apples were tart as the caramelization created a great sweet element. The volcano cakes were averange looking at first, but as soon as those babies burst, the cocoa was on! Very rich, dark chocolatey flavor with sweet vanilla ice cream.Overall, Les Deux Gamins had unforgettable, traditional French food perfectly prepared and to top it all off, great service and atmosphere that really made you feel appreciated as a customer."
/user_details?userid=skZuQC3XKMFnENmjnr2Bow,Sherry A.,"Hartford, CT",4 star rating,"Very nice- we picked this place based on other yelper reviews and it did not disappoint.  We went in Friday night - beautiful evening, so patio was pretty crowded. We chose to sit just inside near the open doors.  Food was very good - escargot just the right texture and not too salty, flank steak done perfectly rare and the beef  tartare just yummy!   Our waiter was great, although he was the only one on while we were there and we thought he could use some help - but he had a terrific positive attitude.  Our only caution is if you're not keen on smoke, you will want to sit away from the open area - a few diners on the patio were smoking and the smoke was blowing back into the main area.   We loved the overall atmosphere of Prince Arthur street and would visit Les Deux Gamins again when were next in Montreal."

I'll give it one star for the bread 1 one star for the beautiful weather we had when sitting outside (you can see how I am stretching here). The croque monsieur was on the Canadian equivalent of wonder bread put on by the laziest chef imaginable. The steak my husband ordered he couldn't even swallow the first bite. And the frites?! We had bottom of the barrel little fry-lettes that were soggy and old. Ick. We had checked the website beforehand and had specifically gone to try the onion soup, which lo and behold is not even served at lunch. Tourist trap without equal. You've been warned..."
/user_details?userid=F8Vbr4BQfltbxI1bGtoK2Q,Igor M.,"Secaucus, NJ",4 star rating,Great food. Attentive waiters. And they let us just sit and chat for 2 hours after we finished our meal. Didn't bother us till we actually asked for a bill. Great atmosphere too! Highly recommend the place.
/user_details?userid=yG_wY_HqkS5pQAzSWL7PmQ,Benoit S.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"This is a great French restaurant, with a typical French bistro style. The service is usually great, and the food is excellent. Remember to bring your own wine since they do not sell wine there. The location is really a big plus as well. Unfortunately, it close for lunch and on Sunday (I think)."
