/user_details?userid=l6y1_khn2V29gzu_srRlIQ,Grace Y.,"Temple City, CA",5 star rating,"Came here late late night with five minutes before the kitchen closes. The servers were very courteous about letting us know the kitchen closing. They wanted us to get our order in but wasn't pushy or rude about it. We ordered the mushroom bruschetta which was full of flavor. I would highly recommend this dish if you love mushroom. The bread on the bottom did get soggy half way through my meal so I would recommend asking for them to put it on the side. We also ordered the Brie spread which came with more French bread so I was able to super enjoy the mushroom bruschetta in addition to the soggy bread on the bottom. Talk about carb over load but truly truly worth it! Ok so we read other reviews about the Brie spread. I'm a non cheese person- hello, I'm asian so I was a little hesitant about getting the dish but still chances it. Oh my! So subtle, smooth and with the dried cranberries and pear, it gave it the sweetness it needed to make it a very pleasant experience. I wanted to eat the whole thing but paced myself. Last dish we got was the French onion soup. It was on the saltier side but we needed it. Overall, a very nice night cap to our evening."

Spicy Ceasars with a caper and lemon garnish. The service is top notch with all the staff working together like a well oiled machine. Love the old rock music playing in the background. This place has a lot of ambience."

/user_details?userid=u1zob4t6FYOwMme-TZxj2A,Naz T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We went to NYK's for a quick dinner and it's a really nice spot for lunch and dinner. It was pretty busy, we were told it would be a few minutes but it ended up being close to 15 minutes wait time. We asked if we could order while we were waiting and thank goodness we did ( we got our meal within a few minutes of being seated) , only thing ... the waitress got my order wrong! However , they were quick to rectify the mistake and bring me the correct meal . I got the Lamb merguez and it was delicious; it was flavourful and not too heavy! Not too spicy in my opinion, just right! It's a great choice if you're looking for something rather healthy (if you skip the fries) or if you're not too hungry but want to grab a bite.I'm not writing them off, they have a nice menu and a nice atmosphere. I'd go back for sure."
/user_details?userid=Il1b-hUnPUrrF_-FNVZeqg,A P.,"Staten Island, Staten Island, NY",4 star rating,"Burger was excellent and so were the fries , but the place looked alittle on the hole in the wall forgotten side. Definitely worth the visit."

/user_details?userid=WUgxsRUFjATha8L4qWYDww,Glenn M.,"Indian Rocks Beach, FL",4 star rating,Wonderful meal and lively restaurant.  Had to wait 15 minutes for a table which to us was a sign of a good restaurant as it appeared to be mainly locals (which we are not).  French Onion soup was very good as was the Fish and Chips.  We also ordered a daily special which had a half chicken with Peruvian spices which was good though the slaw had a horseradish flavor that was a bid different and would swap for another side next time.  Server was wonderful and friendly - all three in our party said we would definitely eat here again when in the area.
/user_details?userid=op_6hWe4Hooe5Gensxjs2Q,B K.,"Brantford, Canada",3 star rating,Found this on Yelp. Busy place but was able to be seated quickly. Servers were very friendly and spoke both French and English. This was a plus as my French is..well not the greatest lol. They were very attentive. Ordered the raspberry mojito. Not very strong which is fine as the flavor was pretty good. Ordered the cheese burger which came with fries and a salad. The burger was not very good at all  it had a weird flavor and was very dry (and grey?) . Fries were ok and salad was decent but oily. The people next to us ordered the fish and chips and it looked and smelled awesome. Next time I think that's what we order. Overall it was a nice place to get together and will return. Just not for the burger lol

Great menu at reasonable prices. Walking location from anywhere central. But be warned (which I prefer) lots of locals. The service was amazing. Food was fantastic. Drink selection was wide as well. Overall had a great experience and would definitely come back next time I'm in town!
/user_details?userid=PttfC3pZveKAF4YIOFsGWg,Jenna P.,"Derry, NH",4 star rating,"Cute spot. Very trendy.  No a/c in the summer. It's an open air bar this time of year. Bathrooms were also hot. Service was very slow. My mojito was flavorful, but not strong. It was also not a large drink. Now that that's out of the way, let's get to the food: Gazpacho - yum, polenta fries - good, but could have done with a sprinkle of cheese, duck poutine - order this, the flavors were 10/10! I would come back to this restaurant."
/user_details?userid=frr39P2E9CtS2EcSLzhODg,Tony E.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"After reading rave reviews on Yelp for their fish and chips, I decided to try them. They definitely live up to the hype. Best cod fish and chips I've had in North America. The french onion soup is also very good without being too salty. They balanced it perfectly."

Super popping, bohemian style bar with all the vibes. Great indoor, nice outdoor patio too. Had the French onion soup and mushroom bruchetta, wifey had the pointine. Was exceptional. Draft list was concise but great too, loved the unibroue beers on draft! Beware this place was packed both times I went! Relax and have a drink while waiting for a table :)"

/user_details?userid=tTDAtv01erC9EgjvJ8Lx9g,Sean C.,"Homer, NY",5 star rating,Really Nice place. Cool atmosphere and fun vibe. Pretty busy at 10:30pm. Kitchen closes at 11 however we were able to get our order placed in time to eat. I had the BBQ Pulled Pork Poutine! It was delicious. Nice big pieces of cheese curd and the foie Gras gravy was very tasty! The pork was not saucy (just the way I like it) and the fries were great! Friend had the BBQ Pulled Pork Burger. It was loaded with meat and it didn't stand a chance! Yum! The ladies split a Grilled Chicken burger. It's was filled with chicken & very tasty with the gruyère (I cant do salsa they said it was really good) and maybe we had a few bottles of Henry Fessy Gamay Noir! Yum!
/user_details?userid=FbZQbgXLn1rdHkisrnGpuQ,Ruth N.,"Brookline, MA",5 star rating,"What great food for such low price! Our waiter was excellent, originally putting us in a table all to ourselves near the front. But of course, we, the ENTP Americans wanted to be in the center of the action, so we asked for the booth in the back of the restaurant, right next to the bar. I'm sad we didn't get pictures of the food, but it was all delicious! Clams - generous portion, very delicious, I drank all the broth at the end (don't judge); beers - yummy and cheap (compared to Boston prices, probably not the best place to compare to), and waiter had really good recommendations; truffle pasta - hands down, bowl-scrapin' scrumptious. This place really hit the spot after our 3-hour sauna at Boda Boda. We were very happy and satisfied.Edit: forgot to mention, the warm brie with pears is heaven in your mouth. It got devoured, never had a chance."
/user_details?userid=mM5phAV3wjCXfYw0LUmcng,Josephine P.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is slowly becoming a popular date night spot for me. I feel like some of the staff are point blank rude, and some are extremely cordial. I hate that the appetizers here are over priced and tiny. We ordered the chorizo and corn fries, I honestly think sharing an appetizer is almost impossible here. I would recommend this place because I think they have the best cider and the location is really nice. Its a fun touristy place with good main course."

Staff behind the bar were welcoming and nice. Lots of great sounding food to choose. Went for the lamb poutine since it's Montreal and it's a must to try poutine! I wasn't disappointed. Sausages were strong tasting and the flavor stayed with you long after though, so beware. I would definite seek this place out again if I ever find myself back in Montreal."

/user_details?userid=fe3giuvDXtPpigp5B3hHqg,Glenn S.,"Saint Paul, MN",4 star rating,My wife and I were in town on vacation. Arrived late afternoon and we were looking for a place to eat close to our hotel. Found this spot on yelp. Nice pub and restaurant.The menu was in French but thanks to yelp and a helpful server we were were able to decide on the dishes that turned out very good. I had the pulled pork poutine along with the local craft wheat beer.  I was very satisfied with both choices. Overall a nice spot for a quick meal and a beer.

/user_details?userid=GTM0Jv2ayEgjcwnXXP7D8g,Tairyn A.,"Coral Springs, FL",4 star rating,"We actually found this pub while looking for another restaurant that turned out to be a reservation only place. It was snowing, and we were so hungry that we pretty much came into the first place that had available sitting. I know this isn't the best way to find a new place to eat, but we didn't realize that at night time (even on weekdays) you pretty much need a reservation anywhere in Montreal. I'm guessing is the cold and the fact that there isn't much more to do than to go out and eat. Anywho, we came in and this place is very small and crowded, we were lucky a party of two just vacated a table so we were able to stay. This place had their own brews, but could not be considered a brewery per se. We asked the waitress to recommend something that wasn't dark or IPA. She brought a pale ale and it was very good. We also decided to try the famous ""Poutine"" which is the only Canadian thing we could discern. It's just some fries with gravy and some kind of queso fresco type cheese. They do have different flavors but we went with the original. It was OK, hit the spot when it's cold, but it's not something I would eat often. They did have some entrees, besides the typical bar food. I had a blackened chicken with salad, and the hubby had a pulled pork sandwich. It was very good. I saw another table had ordered French onion soup, which looked amazing, but I was full by then. I would have definitely tried that.Service was great, even though the place was brimming with people and there was hardly any space to walk between the tables, out waitress came ofter to check on us, even the manager (or I assume was the manager) came by to ask how we were doing. Overall a great place, a little loud, but it was OK. I liked everything I had and the service was great."

We had the lamb and sea bass which were specials and a burger, and everything was great! The creme brûlée at the end was also really good. Great place for food and drink, and looked like it be great to sit out on the patio for a drink and people watch."
/user_details?userid=BaWal7CJGY0sfK8M-bJihQ,Bella Z.,"Bronxville, NY",3 star rating,"Friendly service. We went on a Thursday night without reservations and they were able to seat us at the bar right away. The restaurant is a tad small and tight for my taste, and it was very crowded. I found the menu to be a bit underwhelming. My friend and I ordered the polenta fries, warm Brie with poached pear, a french onion soup, and a veggie burger- all to share. The polenta fries were tasteless and not at all appetizing. The French onion soup was decent (not the best I've had but not the worst either), the veggie burger was just okay (also kind of bland), but the warm Brie with poached pear was phenomenal and the best part of our meal! If it wasn't for the warm Brie then I would say our meal would have been a total bust, but luckily the warm Brie dish redeemed our entire culinary experience at this place. The guy sitting next to me ordered the fish and chips and it looked good, but I would probably not be back. Plus there were little gnats/flies flying around the bar, total turn off."

We shared a poutine and it was quite good. I had a little salad with balsamic dressing that was yummy, although a tad overdressed.For my entree I had pasta with mushrooms in a cream sauce. It was amazing. My nephews loved it too and ate half of it! We also got a calamari to share. Not the greatest....Service was fast and friendly, atmosphere was fun and inviting and fine with the kids.

/user_details?userid=kMXPkvGLJBLgkZVLPQmSlw,Marianne D.,"Naperville, IL",5 star rating,"We came upon this pub walking from the fine arts museum back to our hotel in Old Montreal.  Nyks had the feel of a little European pub.  There are tables outside, and in warmer months the restaurant opens up to the outside by a large overhead door.  The young gentleman who greeted us and served us was friendly and provided very good service even though he was both bartender and server. The pub offers free wifi, just ask for the username and password.  We ordered the classic Poutine to share, which was good with a wonderful rich gravy. The sundried tomato, olive and basil tapenade was tasty and served with a small basket of bread. The bread was not enough for the generous portion of tapenade, but more bread was brought to us upon request. I liked the atmosphere of the pub very much and the friendliness of the gentleman who served us. I recommend stopping here for a pint and a poutine."

/user_details?userid=wVCbxT-CEal9kN_OvTrSrg,Tom F.,"New York, NY",1 star rating,"Just absolutely shocked by local yelpers. 4/5 stars? Maybe not enough people judged the food? I wanted straight up pub food & good beer. The McAuslan cream ale beer gets the star. Clean taps. Smooth tasty, cold pint. I play it safe (I think) and order their classic burger with sautéed onions with the $1 add on cornichons & $1 Gruyere. The beer arrives in 5 minutes (thankfully) the burger comes with fries & salad...after a good 30 minutes. The salad is coated in flavorless oil & nothing more. The fries are dark & soggy with oil and no more than room temperature. Disappointing. The burger does not land within the definition beyond its shape. It is a flavorless, thin, overcooked disc with softened (not melted) Gruyere, raw (not the promised carmelized) onions and pickles. Had I used the burger as a doorstop & only eaten the pickles & bun, I likely would have been more satisfied. Verdict: If you visit, just have beer. They don't serve food...really."

I like it but don't love it. It's ok but I don't hate it. What I do like is that it's a good pub atmosphere to hang out and have some drinks. I ordered a burger which I wasn't satisfied with, but the drinks were good and the brie cheese platter we took home was great. Plus they were playing 80's music which made me very, very, happy. My friend had the mussels which were yummy. Location was ideal and near our hotel so we didn't have to worry about taking a taxi/Uber back too.Other than that, it was fine, which probably should've given it a lower/higher rating? I'm not sure. Staff was ok, but I felt something was missing. Maybe I was more impressed with the music choices than the food which isn't necessarily a good sign. So..B-."

Atmosphere was great, the service was a little slow and scattered, and the food was generally ok.  The melted Brie appetizer was the hit of the night.  The fried calamari was standard. The steak-frites was cooked perfectly for me (Medium) - daughter ordered medium-well and it was just not ... good.  The cod escabeche was ok, The linguine in mushroom sauce was a thumbs down from my son-kind of ""dry"". The Poutine was ok, but the cheese didn't melt but that's probably because we asked for the gravy on the side.  Wine was small, but the beers were big. Go with the beer."

The appetizers a overpriced, considering the size. Too small. The Basil and lemon grilled shrimps for example is 12$ and is basically a skewer with 4 shrimps. (But very tasty!). The duck with carrot confit is also delicious!If you want something more substancial to start, try a main course, like the Homemade lamb merguez sausages (served with fries and green salad) and share it! The service is vey friendly and I'll definitely come back!"

Service wasn't bad despite the pub atmosphere, we did have to raise our hands a couple of times, but this is a pub, not a 5 star restaurant. The inside is cosy, and they are willing to help pack you in. The drinks are pretty reasonable as wellStarted with the warm Brie as suggested by Yelp and it was as good as everyone says it is. The gf has the olive tapenade as her entree and it was also excellent; absolutely brilliant flavor, I thought it was close if not better than the Brie.I had some kind of cod espenada or something like that ( soupy with vegetables) that had a sharp flavor but excellent in a way that made it disappear quickly. The sausages weren't too greasy and had great flavor, and the fish and chips dish was huge and disappeared faster than I ate my meal. The crab cakes looked frozen but I can forgive that considering the home cooked from scratch feel of everything else. The  Creme brûlée also seemed made from scratch and was excellent.Overall the food was fantastic, the service was tolerable for a pub, and the atmosphere was cosy but pleasant. We will probably be back"

/user_details?userid=9bvlW5Gos1kxzvcM3c-12w,Don P.,"Hampden County, MA",4 star rating,"This little pub is right on the edge of Montreal's entertainment district the Quartier des Spectacles. Nyks has a good assortment of beer and ales on tap as well as bottled beers in their under-counter refrigerators. They tend to specialize in Unibroue Beligian Style Ales from Tremblay which are imo world class brews but they also have other good local Quebec beers and ales too. I have yet to eat there but the food coming out of the kitchen has always been tempting and the presentation is absolutely eye catching. I ordered a McAuslan Cream Ale a local nitro-brew and was totally satisfied as I sat back to watch one of the most incredible bar-tending displays I have ever seen. Rick, the bartender, is a British expat married to a French Canadian living in Montreal now for some 12 years. Orders for drinks were all verbal from three waitresses and Rick never missed a beat, both hands always moving doing two things at one time all the time! My Son and I watched him for at least 30 minutes and were totally mesmerized by his skill level, adroitness and speed. If you wish to have a good beer or ale, Nyks should be on your list and for no other reason go to catch Rick you will be totally bedazzled as we were."
/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"My visits to Nyks are sporadic and they occur approximately once a year in conjunction of some of the numerous festivals organized in the Quartier des spectacles. The pub provides a safety net against near by chain restaurants or new unknown establishments, it is always a pleasure to submerge in its noisy atmosphere or just grab a pint at the tiny outdoor tables. During the summer the windows are wide opened and one can have a nice terrace feeling. The menu of Nyks is small, but well considered to satisfy everybody's taste. The olives and dry tomatoes tapenade as an example is a perfect snack that can be even shared and I got exactly what I needed with my simple green salad with carrots during my last visit. One of my friends shared a lot of good words about the pulled pork burger. Nyks deserves special Bravo for the bourbon infused Bloody Caesar, it is spicy, but good spicy. They will serve you little cute carafe of sangria if you have cravings for it. The beer list is wonderful, classical imported and bunch of local craft brews on tap. Ended up drinking pint or two of Coup de Grisou last week, second Bravo for the pub. Don't hesitate if you are in the area and really wondering where to have a drink or bite, Nyks will deliver."
/user_details?userid=91Mo2-qrDaZsFC2zM8Yuqw,Ellen C.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"This place is solid beyond words. The food is great especially their duck confit poutine, which was amazing. The duck was tender, the fat was rendered (although some of it sat at the bottom of the dish). The fries were fried to perfection and the gravy was just what the whole entree needed. We also got the calamari which tasted fresh and was sizable. The fish and chips which were okay. And the pork sausage which was a bit disappointing - tasted a bit dry and overdone.The service though was great. The ambience was fantastic - we went on a warm summer night and the doors and windows were opened up to the street. It really gave a laid back European vibe which we loved. People were in and out since this place is pretty popular. Would definitely come back for some wine/beer and some more eats."

Located just off of the Quartier des Spectacles, it was an easy walk from our hotel. We stumbled upon the restaurant on a Monday night, when mostly everything else was closed in the area. It was packed, but we found a seat in just 10 minutes, ordering the Cream Ale right away. Since that first night, we've been here 4 times, mostly during their happy hour. The place is small and tables are tightly configured, so if you like to spread out, this is t the place. Food is great, but that cream ale is what kept us coming back on the frigid February days. Poutine, mushroom bruschetta, homemade sausages and hamburgers were all fantastic. Portions are a decent size and staff is friendly, although a little slow when they're jammin.  if you're looking for a local feel, good beer, great food and a sweet, pub-like atmosphere."

The food was nothing spectacular but the cocktail was pretty memorable.The second time I came on a very late night. There was barely anyone here.

I ordered the homemade pork and leek sausages with fries and green salad. The sausage tasted okay, but the texture was a bit too dry. I didn't like the salad dressing at all, so I couldn't even eat my salad. The fries were the best part....my 3 friends had finished eating and their plates had been cleared away already while I was finishing my fries. I went to grab the mayo but that had been cleared away too....umm excuse me waiter, I'm still eating, can I have the mayo back please. I tried bites of my friends' meals as well an this is what I found... Pulled pork burger was too dry. Fish and chips really didn't have much flavor, but was very tender. Warm goat cheese with spinach and tomatoes was really just that: goat cheese, spinach, and tomatoes with nothing else. There was a lot of goat cheese compared to the amount of spinach and tomato, so if you order this, make sure you really like goat cheese. I also found the portions were a bit small for the price. I won't be going back."

One of friend got the veggie burger, she gave me a bite and it was surprisingly delicious! Another friend got the duck poutine which I tasted as well. It was also really good.

We set out to discover the shopping of St. Catherine's street. About halfway down we began to get hungry and wanted to eat lunch and grab some pints and began reading menus outside restaurants. This menu grabbed our attention the most and the beer selection was unmatched in the area. They even have some of their own micro brews on tap. My wife got a cider she kept calling the Michael Jordan cider and she loved it. I went with some of the McLauren brews I think they were called and enjoyed those as well. We got here about 11:30AM and the crowd was minimal. She asked if we had reservations and we said no, we were just visiting and dropped in. I was curious why they would need reservations, but as we sat there drinking waiting on our food I quickly realized why. Right after noon, the place filled up elbow to elbow. It was clear this was a good place to eat for the locals during lunch hour. I ordered the fish and chips, and it was honestly the best fish and chips I had ever eaten before. I have had that dish over 100 times and seriously this was the best way I had ever experienced it. My wife got the Philly cheese steak burger, and she was not as impressed with her choice. It did not look like what we experience in the US as the standard, it was more chopped looking and almost tasted and resembled BBQ. She did enjoy it, she just mentioned she would not order that again. I had heard such good things about the micro brews they had on tap there, I was hoping we would get a chance to stop back by there at night for some drinks, but our time didn't allow for it. I definitely recommend stopping here though if you are in the area, you won't regret it even though it is on the pricier side, but what isn't in downtown Montreal."

Everything we have ever had on the menu has been spot on (I've eaten there maybe 20 times).  Try their soups, they are some of the best I've ever had.  They also have homemade sausage on the menu that is awesome.They always have specials on their chalkboard that usually feature something unusual (I've seen kangaroo, deer and bison).  They also usually have a fish or other seafood special  on tap (this summer they have had mussels quite a few times).  Nyk's is also a great spot to hang out and people watch - it's right off St Catherine where the street is blocked off for the various summer festivals so there are tons of ""interesting"" people to see.  In the summer they have the outdoor sidewalk patio open and the large doors to the inside open.  In the winter you can hang out inside and watch the Habs on the bar TV. They have a good variety of Quebec and World beer on tap and a full bar as well and have 5@7 specials.Did I mention the owners being cool?  They are - I usually have my favourite beer on my table before I even sit down.  They take the time to ask how you are doing and make sure you are having a great experience.  It's like hanging out at a friend's house who is an awesome cook and has lots of beer taps!  Go once to try it and then go back to just hang out."

The burger looked smaller, but was still good. My wife said her chicken burger was pretty flavorless.For the most part I am going to chalk our second experience up to the craze of the jazz fest. If you have attended you'll understand.  We sat down at 3:30pm by the time we left at 4:30 there were no seats to be had. The atmosphere and the friendliness of the staff make up for it. And there was never any pressure to vacate our table. I'd try it again in a heart beat. If you like good food, good people and rustic. This is the perfect place."
/user_details?userid=tEDqWgmi48aFEpqafmgiAw,Susan R.,"Jamaica Plain, MA",4 star rating,Went while in Montreal on vacation.  Atmosphere is thoroughly Bostonian (if that's a thing)... dim lights... warm bar... good beer selection... and not bad food either.  A solid choice for a bite to eat if you aren't looking for fancy-pants cuisine.Met a few local guys who work nearby at the theatres/perf arts center... and it just seems like a nice group of staff/regulars.Give it a try!

/user_details?userid=0tf14Cq5NU3PBINpEDXZdQ,Sara R.,"Dallas, TX",3 star rating,"This was my first stop after arriving in Montreal.  A bit exhausted from being up early to catch the flight in from LA, I was craving a good ol' burger and beer, with a low-key atmosphere.  This fit the bill perfectly.  The decor is dark and wooden, and reminded me of a contemporary Irish pub meets classic bistro.  Service is friendly and courteous (and  they helped with directions to my next stop later), but a tiny bit slow.  Although, I presume this to be because food is not just a means of calorie intake in Montreal.  It is to be enjoyed and relished. :)  Which I did.  The burger is cooked to a well-done (they don't ask how you want it prepared), and I got mine with Mozzarella cheese - and it already comes with grilled onions on a tasty bun.  It definitely hit all the right belly spots.  Paired with a local brew (hmm.. I forget the name and unable to find it on their website, but I believe it was a Molson pilsner?..  if that even makes sense).  The meal also comes with a green salad and fries.  Excellent!  I like how in Montreal, most meals come with either a salad or fruit - and not ""extra"".Total was less than $20.  Good food, nice ambiance, cool location.  A pleasant introduction to my first night in Montreal."

Shared the must have pulled pork poutine and a spinach salad with lovely goat chews and added grilled chicken. Only reason not 5 stars is once food arrived, waitress never came back to check. Would have ordered another beverage or water."
/user_details?userid=M3mK33y1fe-8oqrfMVtRRQ,Adrian T.,"Oakton, VA",5 star rating,"Loved the casual, friendly atmosphere. I expected standard pub fare, but got the best steak I've eaten in Montreal. I'm jealous of Montrealers who have this as their corner bar.I can't stand it when restaurants just hand you a cold, hard roll, so I was glad to see some fresh warm bread to start. It was perfect for dipping the savory cream of celery soup, which had a great flavor yet didn't taste too heavy. The main course I had was a flank steak (bavette) of bison with a whiskey horseradish sauce with fries and a side of roasted yellow squash, zucchini and bell peppers. The sauce didn't really taste like whiskey or horseradish, but it was damn good, so who cares. Steak came grilled to a perfect medium, and was very tender. I know entrecote/contrefilet is the local favorite around here, but this flank steak blows it out of the water."
/user_details?userid=YrugcPqjHGVkrSXpozDowg,Helena K.,"Durham, NC",4 star rating,"This is officially my favorite place in Montréal.  I've been in the city on a business trip for the better part of the week and have eaten here three times.  As a solo vegetarian diner with a mild case of social anxiety, it is sometimes difficult for me to find a place where I really feel at home when I'm, well, not at home.  The staff at Nyks are incredibly friendly, funny, and laid back, the atmosphere is cheerful and warm, and the food and beer selection cannot be beat.  They have several on-tap local microbrews and the veggie burger and salads are out of sight, although I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place to die-hard foodies, but I will say this: during my time in Montréal, I have spent hours reading at the bar and have never once felt awkward or out of place and I always leave full and happy.  I love it!"

Drinks came then I asked for water again. She responds with ok. 15 minutes later asked for water again. I had to ask 3 times to get it. After finished 1 drink after sitting there for 45 mins, waitress comes over to ask if need refill, she never put the appetizer in. I waited 45 minutes thinking it is taking this long to cook my special dish. She never put it in but does not apologize. How deaf can you be?!!! I even asked to make sure the ingredients in the dish is what I wanted. Worse service ever!!! Waste of time & money!! I want to give a zero for my rating. It's so damn humid outside & no water. Imagine how that feels."
/user_details?userid=ShXv6fMfFskSEqRpJ5dlVg,Shirine T.,"Washington, DC",2 star rating,"I came here with 3 other people. First of all, the waitress wasn't the nicest person but i usually don't care if she does her job right. We ordered our food and beer, the drinks got there right away but the food was taking a really long time. About 40 mm go by and still no food and no waitress in sight since we got our beer. ( we ordered burgers and poutine) We finally find her and call her over, after asking about our food, she acts like nothing is wrong. We finally get our food, and yet again, our waitress disappears and never comes back. Later, when some of the party was done eating, instead of waiting for everyone to be done, someone had started clearing the plates. When it came time to pay, I had to get up to ask for our check. On top of this long wait and lack of service, another waitress kept reaching over our table to serve people next to us because they were too lazy to walk around to the other side. This making it very uncomfortable when you're trying to eat but someone's body is constantly hovering over your head. The food was good but since the service was horrible I don't think I'll come back."
/user_details?userid=bubCIa8tqeWGyTlBjxvuLg,tokill a.,"Etobicoke, Canada",4 star rating,"love this place! As with most things Quebecois: They have their own ""take"" on simple foods/concepts. A Philly Cheesesteak is pretty straight forward. They have their own take on that, as a Burger @ Nyks. My Wife didn't partiuclarly like it, as she was expecting something else (ie. a Philly-Style, on a Burger Bun).  Great selection of beer...House Burger is done really, really well. Best Hamburger I've had in Montreal. Great selection of local beers, moderately priced...great atmosphere.  No complaints. Highly recommended."
/user_details?userid=oGFSMLwrVZFe4JL5b_YOfw,Liz D.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"This pub was by far the most consistently crowded place around the jazz festival area in Montreal. My friend and I wanted to go where the locals looked like they were, and this seemed like the place to be. We sat at the bar and was immediately served drinks. I love the atmosphere- really casual, great music, lots of people and great service. They speak both English and French, and the menu was in both languages as well. I ordered the poutine with grilled chicken and it was absolutely delicious. The fries were cooked perfectly, the gravy had fois-gras and was so tasty, and I loved the cheese curds and chicken. Not too heavy and rich- it made for a great satisfying dinner. I was really happy with this place and would definitely come here again!"

Place was pretty busy but we were served drinks right away.  Appetizer arrived quickly.  The Brie was excellent and the Belle Geulle pilsner was tasty.  Main course took a little longer to arrive than we expected -- between 30 and 45 mins.  I had the duck confit salad.  Wife had the fish and chips.  Both were well above average.  In fact, the fish and chips might have been the best I've had.  The batter was light and flavourful and the fish was thick and flaky.   Plus the extra green salad on the plate was a nice bonus.  Would recommend."
/user_details?userid=65mtqTog-6ja32QG34KiGg,Monica L.,"Washington, DC",3 star rating,"On a recent trip to Montreal, I was so pooped by 8:30 pm that I was ready for bed. But then I slapped myself in the face and said, ""It is 8:30! Get out of bed and explore the city, you fool."" So I wandered down Rue St-Catherine close to Chinatown and found Nyk's (or maybe it is just Nyks). It was quite dark and wooden inside, but the volume of the music was just right and there was a good mix of clientele (old ladies having a slice of cake on the terrasse and a gaggle of kids who could be no older than 18 by the bar). I ordered a half pint of the Coup de Grisou from Cheval Blanc, a very yeasty, fruity beer served with a lime. The escargots on the menu were good, but I wouldn't have even known I was eating snails since the dish was smothered with a thick layer of melted cheese (maybe this is the norm, I have never eaten escargots in Montreal before). The rest of the menu is typical bistro fare, and the kitchen seems to stay open until pretty late.Don't go for the view though. There is some major construction going on across the street (might have something to do with the Film Festival)."
/user_details?userid=eYFdB6KfhqT7nz_7FMU8TQ,Horst G.,"Steiermark, Austria",4 star rating,"Great burger and nice selection of local beers. When we visited the place was quite packed but we still managed to find a table. The staff was also fast and friendly and they don't rush you out of the door just because you haven't ordered a drink 5 seconds after you finished your previous one. The vista is probably not the nicest due to some bare land on the other side of the street, but it doesn't really distract from the stylish interior. That and I'm just a fan of having stuff listed on blackboards ;-)"

Sit inside or outside of the garage doors. Excellent selection of local beers on tap. The food was pretty good; the burger wasn't anything to die for but the fries were very good.
