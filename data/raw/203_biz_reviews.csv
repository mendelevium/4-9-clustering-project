They had a live singer and piano player and the atmosphere was fantastic! Everyone was dancing - yes, even the guests! The food was phenomenal - perfect portions and flavour. I wish I lived in Montreal so I could go often!"
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"A restaurant with a happy hour to kill: what a delight. Truth be told, this is the reason I come back to Paradis. A margarita for $5 is probably as close as I'll get to American happy hour standards in this city and I take full advantage. The service, I must disclose, is hilariously all over the place. My only experience with these guys is having them come take my drink order and then disappearing for an eternity. They'll be back in a few weeks with my margarita and then in another few weeks they'll be by to take a food order. Needless to say, be sure you're not in a rush.The food never really impresses but it's definitely a big step up from a lot of the Tex Mex you find in Montreal. I really appreciate how much cactus they incorporate into the menu. Also, there's like a gizillion things to eat here.Finally, the space is something else. You'll always recognize Paradis by it's eclectic exterior- the interior lives up to this hype. Everything in here seems like it was kinda slapped together with some plywood, paint and tape but I wouldn't have it any other way."

/user_details?userid=KVBtgHW-4i_wDwcKTFiw6A,Vera C.,"Sheepshead Bay, NY",1 star rating,"Happy hour Sangria and margarita was on the weak side, Tasted like juice and water. We ordered fish ceviche which was like half my knuckle, a house salad which came with 2 chopped lettuce leaves and a couple of pieces of sliced mushroom. 4 variety tacos that had about 2 table spoons of meat all together, lots of beans to cover that fact, wasn't very good, and the shrimp in an avocado bowl, also small but the best thing we had there. We asked for the tortilla soup which we claimed from this checkin but that never came out. Don't order happy hour, they skimp. Server was nice enough, at least the English speaking one was, but there are way better places to eat in the area."

But they were all full. Finaly we arrived in front of Paradis Montreal and checked out their menu and it looked very good. They had the special 2 cocktails for 10$. We also ordered empanadas, calamari and the fish and shrimp tacos. It was sooooo good!!! Amazing place with nice latin music!"
/user_details?userid=WkAiFAJMI7aZPjFqMvsGbA,Sarah R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"What a great little place with amazing deals most nights of the week! We each started with a margarita - from 5 to 7, you get two drinks for $10! It was tasty. We shared the hummus ranchero, which was interesting. It was like a chunky black bean dip. I loved the fish and shrimp taco plate - very flavourful and filling. My husband had 4 tacos - they were tasty but pretty small. We really enjoyed the salsas and peppers that were served with the meal. The spicy items added a nice kick to the meal. We finished with the fried ice cream, which was excellent.Service was very friendly. One knock is that there is no interior door, and it was cold near the front of restaurant as people went in an out. I will definitely be back during the week to try the many specials!"
/user_details?userid=USZx-55MA2-lG2hBu6PWJA,Vineet S.,"Jersey City, NJ",3 star rating,"We were craving some Mexican food so we decided to stop by on a rainy evening. The restaurant itself is very easy to spot due to the colorful theme. They have some outdoor space but since it started raining we ended to sitting indoors. Had the guac and chips, along with some drinks from the HH menu. Everything was good."
/user_details?userid=vDKJJVVwV-cuFz69jYEB1Q,Diana M.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Happy hour is great here i have to admit. 2 drinks for $15 or something like that. if you go here on a summer day they have a cute terrace that the sun hits perfectly. Drinks and the sun what more can you ask for. But the food itself is so disappointing and almost inedible. We ordered a few dishes and 2/3 dishes were still cold and frozen on the inside. I would not recommend this place unless you're going for drinks, and avoid at all cost if you're hungry."
/user_details?userid=JrTsaMac8BnAkLuJ3MfGzA,Aileen L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"ATMOSPHERE: You'll have no problem spotting the restaurant as you're walking down the street. It's super colorful both inside and out. FOOD: The food was pretty good! All the way from the appetizers to the desserts. We ordered 4 for 10$ tacos (one of each flavor offered) and they were all yummy. It was my first time having cactus which was surprisingly good! The sharing plate was good as well. Some items were a bit too bland for my taste. However, their jalapeno poppers and quesadillas were delicious.PRICE: Prices are decent. They often have specials for everyday of the week which is cool. And they always have their 5 a 7 drink deal (2 for 10$). The only downside to this was that we couldn't split the deal between two people which I found ridiculous.SERVICE: The staff was very friendly. Always there to assist you and make sure that everything was to your liking."
/user_details?userid=6vW5llwSbYe91k8LEkizNw,Martin C.,"Lake Worth, FL",4 star rating,We popped into this bar/restaurant in our first day in Montreal.It had seating outside which gives plenty of opportunity to people watch on Rue St. Denis.The meal was a simple one of fish tacos and was tasty especially the tempura shrimp. Yes the 2 for 1 sangria could have been a bit better but it was refreshing and hit the spot.
/user_details?userid=TP6o5u4fUgVIlYxPZ5TuDw,James T.,"Reading, PA",4 star rating,"Had a great meal here with my family. Everything we had was terrific. The tacos (chorizo & queso), the quesadilla, the chicken wrap and the sangria were all terrific hands down. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because the wait to get drinks & place our orders was a bit long and the band was a bit loud. I won't be too hard on them though because they seemed to be operating with a small staff. If I could give them 4 1/2 stars I would. Definitely recommend this place & I'd definitely go back."

The food was amazing, and it displayed authenticity  from it decor to the ambiance. I would defiantly recommend trying this place if you're looking to have a joyful night."
/user_details?userid=ISWuFRaEpM0X2rplOZ5Egw,Carrie H.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,My friend and I had some time to kill before an appointment and we hit this spot just as it opened for the night. It was DELICIOUS!!! We ordered guacamole which might have been the best I have bet had. The Gordita is perfect for a little bite and the margarita was more than perfect. A def must stop!!!
/user_details?userid=U4JKl-7h9UivVawTkBt73w,N O.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",5 star rating,"I've been searching Montréal for Mexican food and came across Paradis. The food is different than what you will find in most traditional establishments in the city. It's part fusion, but wholly inspired by Mexico and the Caribbean. For dinner we had the choriqueso, tacos pastor, and enchiladas de molé. All of it was really good. Thoroughly enjoyed the various salsa as well. Good service! A hidden gem on St-Denis."
/user_details?userid=vCakYWsCFGxnzhZub3yjGw,Cr R.,"Jamaica, VT",5 star rating,"Terrific food, very reasonable prices.  The tacos are terrific.  I had the Al Pastor and chicken tacos (4 for $10); my husband had the fish and shrimp tempura tacos.  They were all outstanding."
