It's family friendly so definitely fun to bring your kiddos. The service was prompt and the servers were kind. We ordered the calamari for appetizers and they were so fresh. Even the breading felt quite fresh. I was tame and ordered the chicken and beef fajitas. I would give it a 7/10. The guac and beans were delish but there was something amiss about the fajitas themselves. My hubby had different tacos and he enjoyed them all. I gave them 4 stars because I found it pricey for what we got. With tip, it cost me 80$. I would probably return and try something different. :)"

We absolutely loved it, the live singer, decor, the service and the food, all 5 stars!! Kudos to the owner who built such a cool place! I'll definitely recommend that place to anyone who's looking for an original place to go to!"

It feels like home :-) Though for the quality of the food, I's say it's pretty average. The Carnitas taco (pork) wasn't very good and reflective of the traditional Mexican tacos, the meat was watery and lacked flavour. I was expecting to have some potatoes in my tacos as described in the menu but they were missing. The Chorizo and Pescado tacos were good. The Chorizo tostada as well. We didn't try the burritos but the people at the table next to us ordered it and it's a pretty big burrito! Looked good.The churros weren't fresh nor warm. Super cold and probably a couple days old. They don't bake them on site. Someone else does it for them, that's what our waiter said. I think she was the owner. They don't have an alcool license but that didn't really bother us. Casual and chill place, but for quality and flavour I prefer La Matraca or Capital."
