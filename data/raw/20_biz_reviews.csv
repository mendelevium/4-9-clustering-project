/user_details?userid=1GkcJk9SkBdF0N37F_oCAg,Vinh C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The best BBQ in Montreal--and it's not particularly close. The beef rib and brisket are simply seasoned (just salt and pepper as far as I can tell), but they're cooked with such skill that they let the smoke and pure meatiness shine through. When you get a bite that blends the tender, fatty meat with the peppery bark, it's just...phenomenal.Meanwhile, the sides (in our case, the pit beans, coleslaw and mac and cheese) are adequate if nothing special.It's all about that beef, and it's truly, truly special."
/user_details?userid=M7vDDzoPNQDN2FdTcwCq4A,Eric W.,"Hartford, CT",5 star rating,"My coworker was craving barbecue, so why not?!  This place has an excellent rating so we chose here.  It's about the same distance walk as it was to get to La Catrina so we figured we'd walk here as well.  Here's how it went.Atmosphere/Appearance: It's another beautiful warm summer's evening and the people are out are all along Rue de la Commune O.  The scene is so gorgeous with folks riding bikes, families out and the riverfront view.  We chose to sit outside because, why not?  It wasn't very busy and we like to take advantage of the weather when we can.  So dig this.  There is no menu.  Lol.  There's nothing you can hold in your hang to look at.  The servers tell it to you.  It's very interesting.  Moving on...Service: Quite good.  There was a busy table next to us with some kids (who kept eyein' my plate) as well as some tables inside that she was busy with but everyone got handled.  She did an excellent job.Food: So sitting on the bench-like seat outside we're listening to our server tell us about all the delicious choices.  They offer 4 meats (beef brisket, beef ribs, pork ribs and pulled chicken), macaroni & cheese, baked beans and coleslaw.  It's such a simple menu.  No wonder there's no need to waste paper.  Well, I needed to try all 4, so that's what I did.  I got the baked beans and coleslaw to try and be as healthy as possible.  Lol.  Everything was FABULOUS and I see why this place is rated so freaking high.  I was STUFFED, but... that's what the walk back is for!  Ha, ha, ha.  I was truly surprised at how well Texas barbecue was pulled off so far north in Montreal!Value: All prices in $CAD. $35.00 for the quad-meat special with 2 sides.  Now that's QUITE STEEP, but it was 100% worth it.  I'd certainly come back here time and time again... if I weren't preparing to get married in less than 6 months.  WOO!I've pretty much summed things up, but I loved it here.  Simple menu, no frills, nothing crazy, it's which meats do you want and how much of it  Lol."

I chose the sampler which included ribs, pulled pork, chicken, and beef brisket. It also came with baked beans and a fabulous coleslaw. Everything was over the top good. It is the best barbecue spot in Montreal by far. Will be back"
/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wait, what??? Texas BBQ in Montreal? I spent 4 years in Austin and know a little (well maybe a lot) about eating BBQ. Um, this is it! I grabbed takeout brisket and beef ribs. Both were sans sauce (nice) with a deep dark peppery bark and almost unbelievably moist meat. The sides were OK but nothing special in my book, load up on the meat! The owner John was friendly, welcoming and bought me a beer while I was waiting. This place is as good as it gets for BBQ."
/user_details?userid=RxL3KOklOuN-j10w-nrWpw,Shirley B.,"Austin, TX",2 star rating,"Lattuca Barbeque is across the street from the Old Port of Montreal. Food: They had brisket, beef ribs, pork ribs, chicken and pulled pork on the evening we went. You get two out of three options for sides: coleslaw, mac & cheese and baked beans. We each ordered three items. I had the brisket, beef rib, and pork ribs. Note, the more you order, the less meat you get of each. That's how they roll. The two small slices of brisket was decent. Beef rib was tender with some burnt bits. Pork ribs had good flavor. Chicken wasn't dry, but the piece we got was tiny. Their coleslaw is a pickled kind with a bit of sourness and tang. Mac & cheese might have been good if it was served hot and not at room temp. Baked beans were on the sweet side. Service: OK. As they have no menu posted any where, you'll have a server come by to tell you what they have available for the day and take your drink order. Cost: Two ""trays"" with three meats each and ONE beer totaled CAD$81.65. Overall: I'd pass on this place. Reasons: 1) The lack of a menu. I get it. Things change daily. But would it kill someone to post something on a chalkboard? 2) We went for dinner on a Sunday evening at about 6:15pm. There were three other tables waiting for food and one was just being served. For food that is pre-cooked, it was a 45-minute wait before our food hit the table! And the mac & cheese was room temp. We watched the 'pit-master' at the bar area stay busy, but we were confused as to why as there were only two tables of two and a family of four waiting ahead of us. The two servers also seemed to keep busy with things, but didn't really check on patrons. 3) CAD$81.65 for both of our three item plates and a beer?! We've had much better BBQ served hot at more affordable prices within moments of ordering elsewhere."
/user_details?userid=GQ5gIcoLNPJfsJzLLKr6iQ,Joe M.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Great place for BBQ in Old Port. Reminds me of American styled places, not just smoked meat and poutine. The menu is told to you by the server depending on what meats are available. Beef brisket and pulled pork are smoked offsite and are excellent. Not served with any sauce and it really doesn't need it.... but ask for it because you know you want it!"
/user_details?userid=iJ_sn6RfwO5unR9YgFTd4Q,Camille R.,"Côte-des-Neiges, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,If you're a meat lover this is the place for you. I got to try all 4 of their meats and I really enjoyed the brisket and pulled porc. The beer selection was good but I've had better. Our waitress was very extremely friendly and helpful. The staff in general are great. I'm not sure I would come back as it is a very heavy meal but I'm happy I tried it. The side dishes were delicious !!
/user_details?userid=wMSjFp_aw9SNVrpWggLn0A,Mitch S.,"Holliston, MA",5 star rating,"Listen, here's the thing, if you like mediocre BBQ and sub-par service, then DO NOT come here. Lattuca is for people who want a nice friendly casual atmosphere which just happens to have the best BBQ north of the border. I travel to Montreal every other month or so and have made it a habit to stop by when I'm around. I have never been disappointed. John is an amazing chef who somehow manages to stay in business even after serving some of the most generous positions of top level BBQ you can imagine. Oh yeah, and there's a great selection of draft beer. What else could you even ask for? Do yourself, and a few of your friends, a huge favor and check them out. You will be happy you did!"

/user_details?userid=AIzgm0QYUsy1l42hSPfZLg,Thaina E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been in Canada for about 2 years from living in the US for 15 years, and let me tell you: once your tastebuds ask for BBQ, you find BBQ. Well this is where Lattuca met me in my BBQ need. The BBQ there is de-li-cious! I also love how simple their menu is, it's a BBQ spot, so you get to choose how many (and what kind) servings of meat you want and your typical BBQ sides. They are not (I REPEAT) shy with their portion, so if you think it's a good idea to have a heavy lunch prior to a dinner there, I'd say you're in the wrong my friend. They have all the ribs, pulled pork, chicken and juicy melts-in-your-mouth brisket (yumm). Pricing will have you coming back for more, the place is adorable, true BBQ decor, and for those wondering, if you also need an adult beverage well, their bar is well stocked and waiting for you to make your appearance. Honestly, every time I visit family/friends in Montreal, I look forward to getting a great & filling BBQ platter from Lattuca...and if you're doubting what I'm saying, check out the pictures of my platter. You're welcome!"
/user_details?userid=JstDKWmAZsL026ADFxf7fw,Tony Kangrui L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Visiting Lattuca both before and after becoming a KCBS BBQ judge made me realize two things: (i) serious BBQ enthusiasts look for different taste qualities than the uninitiated and (ii) decent BBQ is indeed quite expensive and rare in this city.For one, I used to think like most people that ""fall off the bone"" was the golden standard for pork ribs. However, to truly enjoy the the chew and pork flavour, it needs to be removed from cooking before the meat becomes mushy, like it is at Lattuca.The brisket was the prize. It was extremely tender and juicy, simple in flavour, and this is so difficult to do that even in competitions it's hit-and-miss. I also really enjoyed the chicken. The beef ribs were just massive and a bit tough.Overall, quite serious BBQ going on. You'll need a reservation on the weekends. And for the uninitiated, don't hesitate to go on Lattuca's website, where the owner explains his approach in keeping the BBQ authentic."
/user_details?userid=k2QawUmLvBbKyIbZW0hbfg,David G.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"I ordered the beef ribs which came with two sides - I elected for beans and mac&cheese. The meat was well seasoned, fell off the bone, and had a good amount of sauce. Restaurant was cozy and had good ambience. Overall, a good place to go after visiting Old MTL."
/user_details?userid=6RbAX_7zkc-fX1gxagSP9g,Wiley T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I arrived in Montreal less than 24 hours ago and I randomly wandered in here looking for a late dinner. As I stepped in they were just closing up, but very kindly offered to let me order take out from what meat they had left. Small talk with the two people working there was very nice and they made me feel very welcome and not like I was keeping them there later than they wanted to be.When I got home and unwrapped the meat one by one, and when I unwrapped the ribs, I involuntarily said ""holy shit"".I don't think I have ever eaten meat this good in my life... ever. I don't come from the south, but I am from the U.S. and I can confidently say Lattuca has greatly surpassed any American BBQ I have ever had.I can't wait to go back"
/user_details?userid=Oigh7geUQoxsJdOFafAnoA,Stephanie H.,"Inglewood, CA",5 star rating,"My family and I were looking for a place to eat while visiting Montreal and found Lattuca on Yelp!  I ordered the brisket and beef ribs with mac and cheese and beans. The meat was sooo flavorful and delicious.  My mouth is watering just thinking about how good it was!  I am a sauce girl and this meat did not have bbq sauce on it and I still loved it. I also loved the root beer so much that I asked the waitress what brand it was and she said Stewart's!  YUM!  Speaking of our waitress, Abby had a great personality and was super friendly and helpful.  She made our dining experience that much more enjoyable."
/user_details?userid=LB5ViGU59ww2XRCx803t0w,Shahin S.,"Innisfil, Canada",4 star rating,"First BBQ experience in MTL. Let me tell you this first off. The food was absolutely to die for. I order the brisket, pork ribs, side of Mac and cheese and the baked beans. Single handedly one of the best BBQ experiences I've ever had. Flavour, texture, appearance. All good. To be honest, I think we were there on a rough night. Keg was tapped, no beer on draught, and was taking a while to get out food. The food looked and tasted amazing. The service was excellent. Unfortunately, the prices didn't add up. Firstly their menu is stupidly confusing. It's posted right outside their door, but if you ask them for a menu inside, they don't got one. Secondly, it's important to note that you have the option of ordering a second meat for a $2 upcharge. The problem with this is that they reduce your initial meat. In fact I got more secondary meat than I did primary. So you're basically more for less. The owner though is top notch nice guy who has a great personality, is friendly, checks in on you and most importantly is a pit boss. Good is great. Prices are too high."
/user_details?userid=4ymljGVCPvDe4gcydm3-7w,Alex I.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"I ate his meat and I respected Monseigneur Lattuca even more.  I did not entertain his side dishes or garnishes, because there weren't any. I was not distracted by his high concepts or clever cocktails, because there weren't any. I was not impressed with his accents or decorations, because there weren't any. Lattuca is the James Dean of meat. If you need more than juicy, irresistibly tender, succulent meat that has been expertly seasoned and lovingly cooked, then go back to Paris. I took the bone from my beef ribs home with me as a souvenir because I love that animal that died so well for me."
/user_details?userid=azZdNaUfeb8J9H1k_aoWJQ,Agnes W.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Would recommend making a reservation because this place gets pretty busy. They have 5 meat options with a minimum of 2 choices for your plate. You also get 2 sides with your plate. I got the pork rib and the brisket. I would definitely recommend the brisket as there are not many places in Montreal that make a good brisket. My friend got the beef rib and the brisket. We both found that some parts of all of our meats were a little dry. The plates are also pretty pricey. It starts at $27, but I think for more than 2 meats, you pay a little more."
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Excellent quality BBQ ! We ordered the holy Trinity (beef ribs, porc rib and brisket) and the proc ribs with brisket. Th brisket and beef rib were the clear winners! They were tender and moist and melted in your mouth without any sauce needed. Very similar to Texas quality BBQ. The sides of mac and cheese, coleslaw and beans were delicious. They were the right portion and not greasy or heavy which paired well with the meat. Attentive service. We really enjoyed our meal, it's a bit pricey at $27 a plate but BBQ is alot of work and ingredients cost more than in the Midwest of the USA. Worth stopping by! They also have a terrace for the summer."
/user_details?userid=P9NgJHu_GxcCeM0o9GJUUQ,Katie L.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,This is a must visit if you love meat! The brisket and pulled pork are amazing. Mac and cheese was surprisingly delicious too. A little pricy but worth it for a good splurge meal out.
/user_details?userid=YxEsJxOVruu1ECeNwFSJeA,Chrisstina S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I made reservations here after reading the reviews on how amazing their BBQ is. We arrived and we're greeted by the really friendly staff. They don't have a menu for food or drinks, but your server will tell you what's available. I got the beef rib and brisket with mac and cheese and coleslaw. And he originally asked for the same but with pork ribs as well. Unfortunately, they had no pork ribs left. So he got the same as me. It did not take long to get our food, and once it came I was astounded at how big that beef rib was! Honestly speaking, the mac and cheese and coleslaw were nothing to mention. Extremely standard. However, the brisket was the best meat I've ever had in my life. Oh my god. It literally melts in your mouth. The beef ribs were delicious as well, tons of smokey flavour. BUT THAT BRISKET THO. I will be going back, and getting just brisket.It is quite pricey, for 2 of us just getting the 2 meat dishes, it costed about 77$, and no drinks. But if you are craving some damn good BBQ, check this place out!!"
/user_details?userid=3ZrY316WfsTrFKbUCc9waw,Diane M.,"Rotterdam, NY",3 star rating,"3.5 !  It was good BBQ but not a fan of no menu.  I like looking at a menu and reading the description!  Our waitress told us about the 5 meats and thank goodness they had all five and usually they sell out and blah blah and we didn't know about sides and so I thought since we are 4 people I asked about a sampler platter to share.  She said good idea.  I got a Japanese beer (?) Sapporo and my husband went with La Fin Dumonde.  He loved it and the kids a Diet Coke.  With that being said, it came to $225.00 Canadian .  I thought that was slightly high.  It was well seasoned but a tad dry for us.  Didn't like the coleslaw but loved the baked beans."
/user_details?userid=iLIGDMatmuGPGELLFlPXdw,Jess M.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is located right by the old port, offers service in french and in English. Very simple menu, comfortable yet simple dinning area and bar. It has a casual feel to the place but it's cozy! We ordered a plate with pork ribs and a plate with brisket so we could share. Let's just say, sharing was difficult because it was soooo good!! The meat was so tender juicy and flavourful. Really good barbecue. The only thing was that the baked beans were served on the colder side. They could have been warmer. I would recommend this place hands down!"

I've had bbq from a lot of places in the states and in Montreal and this place is oh so good!!! I just got home from it and had to write my review.First. Service was very good considering the fact that it was a new staff. Super nice, friendly, patient... I can go on. Especially because i was with my husband and his colleagues. All construction workers that were kinda tipsy, loud and HUNGRY! ;). The waiters and chef/owner were up to par. I am a sucker for hood service and this place delivers it all! Food:Hands down the BEST bbq place you can find here in Montreal. To me the best all around. I ordered the trinity. Beef brisket, beef ribs and pork ribs. Deliciously tender, tasty, fall of the bone. You DON'T need any sauce like some other place. Trust me.Sides:Mac and cheese. Cheesy goodness. Coleslaw. Perfect freshness and crunch. Baked beans. Tender sweetness. Bring your appetite because the portions are generous! This is the place to go if you want real, authentic and heavenly tasting bbq! No wonder they won the Jack Daniels bbq contest! Chef, your food speaks your passion. Bravo!!!"

Straight up meat (plus sides) so there's no menu, server just tells you what's available. Minimal drinks (some beers, wines, etc) but the focus is obviously on the meat. Our party of 4 had the resurrection with beef ribs, pork ribs, brisket, and pulled pork (plus bbq baked beans and mac & cheese).Lattuca is known for his award-winning brisket and it did not disappoint. It melted in your mouth. The ribs literally fell off the bone. Pulled pork was great as well.The owner is passionate about BBQ and that can be tasted in the food. There's not a lot of tables and it filled up very quickly, so reservations are highly recommended."
/user_details?userid=6ZFw6yFd4h7n9ZaLO0UVaw,Taylor B.,"Passaic, NJ",5 star rating,"I went to Austin in August for a brisket trip and having done that I can confidently say this place is equal with greats. The brisket was tender and buttery and not overly smoked. The bark had the right amount of crunch and saltiness. Most pulled pork relies on a vinegar sauce for flavor. This had a smoked sweet depth of flavor I have rarely experienced. But the true winner was the beef rib. Tender, smokey, and with an incredible bark.John Lattuca was a gracious host and it is clear he takes great pride in his craft. Finding this place was a happy accident but I will definitely come back when I'm up in Montreal again."

I was skeptical about trying this place being from the southern part of the US and currently living in North Carolina, which is bbq heaven, but it was actually really really good! I tried the sampler plate with all meats and they were all juicy, seasoned and very tender! Loved the brisket-   meat and very little fat, the beef rib was humongous but tasty. Pull pork and prob rob had a type of cooked in bbq glaze on it  4 stars only for the price. I could've shared a place with my travel partner but the waitress insisted the portions were for 1 person"

They don't have a fixed menu but rather update it daily to the current offerings. The restaurant and it's atmosphere is a little odd and seems to be somewhat unprofessional/improvised - but the friendly and attentive service makes up for that!Overall a great place to go to if you're up for some delicious meat!

I ordered beef. Very delicious. The service is ok. It's a little bit expensive than I expected from a two dollar marque ($$) restaurant. But, I guess it's the level of $$ in Old-Port."

"" came out of mouth followed by a meaty moment of bliss was felt after every bite I took from my humongous platter of carnivorous heaven. That smokiness... That perfect sweetness... Everything was so good. The beef rib is so big to the point where I could use the rib bone as a riot baton. The fat on every piece of meat is an excellent way to throw a party in your mouth. Lattuca is definitely one of my favorite place in Montréal now. My only complain is the big useless knife that took too much space on the table - the fork was enough to pull apart the meat."

Good =b : the employees are very kind and speak both of French and English fluently. Good quality of meet. I and my husband had three different kinds of meet - beef ribs, beef brisket and chicken. I recommend beef ribs and chicken. They are decently juicy and tasty. But the beef brisket was too lean and tasted a bit dry to me. Which can be good for who's on a protein diet. :)Bad =p : Why only 4 stars then? The bill was $74 for two. We had two meals and a beer. A bit pricy for us expecting just a casual dinner."

/user_details?userid=MhD97uCa4QCw1vovDGY2HQ,Juliam J.,"North Miami, FL",4 star rating,So this is how it works. They do not have a menu.  They have a list of meats they cook throughout the day and if they run out it is removed from the list. This is one of those quality over quantity situations. You get less options however the few options you do get are done well.The brisket I order was tender and flavorful. Truly a 5 star meal. I would have given them 5 stars but they screwed up my bill. There isn't any real way to keep track of anyone order because instead of giving you a bill you must go up to the register and wait for them to sort through a pile of paper orders and assume your payment.  Aside from that the waitresses are very friendly and have nice smiles. I will come back on my next visit to Montréal.
/user_details?userid=jxcXExWgrObwx5AL8-LMbA,Nazim A.,"Downtown, Canada",4 star rating,"This bbq spot is sure to please. Their beef ribs and bbq sauce were perfectly done. Also, their Mac and cheese is a great side choice. Being born and raised in Alberta it is rare to find such a gem in the east. My only knock would be that sometimes I do call to reserve only to find out they don't have any beef ribs left. I'm sure this is a rare occurrence however, when you are trying to satisfy a craving and it is not available it is a little disappointing."
/user_details?userid=6knga-vNLcCxdQmhevWjTA,Jack J.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"Located right on the old port. They have an oral menu here, which consists of four options: pulled pork, pork ribs, beef ribs, and/or beef brisket. You can choose to do 1 or all 4, and the portion sizes will be adjusted. Also comes with 2 sides (choose from beans, mac and cheese, and cole slaw). The meats: some of the best BBQ I've ever had. The brisket is probably hands down the best brisket - so amazingly tender with just the right amount of fat. The pork ribs were of thick and generous portions.Didn't initially plan on visiting a BBQ spot in Montreal, but I definitely have no regrets."

The restaurant wasn't busy, so I was seated without a wait. I ordered the brisket and pulled pork with mac and cheese and coleslaw for the sides. Overall, I'd say that the food was pretty good. The brisket was cooked very well; it was juicy and tender and the meat on the bottom had very good flavor. The pulled pork was also good; I thought it could use a tad more seasoning, but then again I'm not a barbecue expert. The sides were also very good; the mac and cheese was well made and the coleslaw was fresh and lightly dressed. The portions sizes were pretty good and were about what I would expect for the price. Overall, I had a good experience and would definitely consider coming back again!"

The owner John is a (former?) BBQ judge so he knows winners and he's won championships himself. He spends half the day preparing the food, from smoking to seasoning to cooling it, so everything on the menu isbmade right in limited quantities. Don't come late and be upset if something ran out. Get a sausage egg mcmuffin from McDonald's if you want fast fun. Send me one also, I can't say no to those things."
/user_details?userid=ZGiwU16rhGvWAYUzkWL0xw,Boz X.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Lattuca, lattuca BBQ... After 4 months of anticipation, I finally got to sample the BBQ. The meats they offer are beef brisket, beef short rib, pork ribs, and pulled pork. If you choose 1 meat out of the 4, it's 17$, 2 costs 19$, and the trinity (3) costs 23$. Which led me to ask, why is there a 2$ difference between 1-2 choices, but a 4$ difference between 2-3 choices? Being a big fan of southern BBQ, I ordered the trinity (beef brisket, short rib, and pork rib) with mac n cheese and kansas style beans as sides.The Jack Daniel's World champion brisket is made texas style. No surprise, if Texas had a holy BBQ animal, it'd be beef. Looking at the crust, I'm thinking they used a dry rub consisting of pepper, salt, paprika in equal parts. I saw a good pink/purple smoke ring surrounding the extremities of the brisket. The flat was a little dry and lacked in seasoning however. I didn't get the chance to sample the burnt ends and point, but those were good apparently. The beef short rib has a nice smoke ring, and had the same flavour profile as the brisket, but it was a bit undercooked (parts close to the bone was still bloody). As the meat was still rigidly attached on the bone, I used a knife to scrape it off (cutting motion alone wouldnt do the job). The pork rib (yes, one single rib) was made kansas-style, I suspect. In terms of taste, it was ketchupy sweet and very flavourful (onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, cayenne, etc). Probably the best single rib I had at a restaurant in Montreal, but who the f**k orders 1 rib at a time?? If I had a half rack or more, I'd be able to judge it more thoroughly (the ribs on the sides are often burnt and dried out).Mac N Cheese: pretty good mac n cheese, comparable to the one at Smoke Signals Q down in Lake Placid. I liked the idea of sprinkling a little bit of pork dry rub for enhanced taste. Kansas-style Beans: very tasty but not very smoky. It had chunks of scrap meat and a hint of celery (that was very nice).What was good about Lattuca's BBQ is that it doesn't come bathed in a heavy complementary sauce and it doesn't need one. The meats are obviously fresh so the taste of the meat alone was enough. The downside was... I was secretly hoping to taste contest level meat -- kinda disappointed because I can reproduce this pretty easily in my backyard (it was 6 celsius yesterday) at a third of the price I was charged. Overall, Lattuca serves hands down the most legit BBQ in Montreal, so if you haven't had southern american BBQ, you gotta check it out."

They have pulled pork, beef ribs, pork ribs and brisket. This shop won some competition with their brisket but they were all sold out the night we were there. My favourite was the pork ribs. The pulled pork was a bit dry. Their BBQ sauce was pretty awesome as well, very different than the store bought ones for sure. For less than $30, you get three choices of meat and 2 choices of sides.

The bark was crispy, properly seasoned, and the center melted in your mouth.  The baked beans, which included navy and red beans were sweet, smokey, and firm , personally I hate when they're mushy.    The Mac and cheese delicious too.  Paired it with an excellent Pike Creek Canadian whisky and soda but the hard a nice selection of beer and non alcoholic drinks as well.  Highly recommended Lattuca to anyone seriously looking for real BBQ"

Overall the food was good. The atmosphere is cool, great outdoor seating for the summer and the bar indoors is nice. The service is nice, but overall it was slow - the meat isn't being cooked, it shouldn't take 30 mins to bring you food. We had brisket (very good), pork (decent but mixed with a sauce that was overly sweet it was almost like candy) and chicken (portion seemed smaller compared). We had Mac and cheese, beans and coleslaw (too much vinegar for our taste). They had no menu which means you don't know what you are paying until you check out. The meat is 27 with two sides with one meat and if you want more they just add 2 but with two plates (3 total meats) and a beer, wine and two soft drinks it was 90, so not entirely sure how that happened. Overall it is solid - especially for the Brisket, but it wasn't 5 stars given the lack of menu/high prices and the sauce on the pork."

My boyfriend and I tried to go in on a Friday night around 8pm and was told they didn't have enough food to serve the rest of the night. I should've expected that since it's New Years weekend. We really wanted to try it so we made a reservation the for the next night at 7pm. It was delish and I'm so happy we went back. The brisket was tender and didn't need any sauce. I could I Say the same about the pulled pork. I got Mac and beans as my sides as they were delicious as well. I'm originally from Texas where bbq is king so that is saying a lot about bbq in the middle of Canada. It was perfectly moist and outstandingly tender. For what I got which was a two meat with two sides was priced at $29 which I kind of thought was over the top coming from a Texan who can get the same meal at way less but I won't complain too much for it being outstanding and in Montreal of all places.I would definitely recommend it. The restaurant is cozy and has very friendly staff. It was my first time in Montreal and they were some of the first people I spoke to that spoke and communicated effectively to a person like me from America that doesn't know a lick of French.

/user_details?userid=zIOxNinC6ofIwwGjO9rUWg,David D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I'm always on the lookout for  smokey BBQ goodness. And finally I went to Lattuca in Old Montréal. My expectations were both surpassed and unmet at the same time. What's in the box is more important than the box. Function over form... but form still matters. And I'll start with form.The restaurant itself is rather, shall we say Spartan not to say unfinished-looking. It feels like the owner took the prime location (La Commune) on the old port, stripped it, painted the walls, forgot to put in a ceiling and barely slapped anything on the walls. The décor is cold and somewhat sterile and almost void of decoration. I mean there's a shower in the lavatory. The tables seem leftovers from a bar, the seating comprised of tiny little plastic chairs. It was underwhelming. I expected some more creature comfort, better décor. Even the food presentation could have used a kick in the balls. I know he's going for authenticity - traditional BBQ joints in Texas serve the food on paper lined tray. Which is fine, but this is Montréal, we take it up a notch. A nice wood board, for the meats and room for quarter-mason jars for the sides or mini cast-iron skillets or something, anything. Thus endeth the bitching.Because what was on the tray was way out there in both flavor and smokey goodness. I had the ""Resurrection"" platter or as I like to call it, the ""gimme everything you got"" platter. This means Beef Rib, Pork Rib, Pulled Pork, Brisket, Beans, Mac n' Cheese, and Slaw. To give you an idea of how mind-blowingly delicious the plate was. The restaurant doesn't place salt, pepper or BBQ sauce on the table. What you get is what you eat and NOTHING needs to be added to it. Nothing needs to be removed as well. It was all near-perfect. My only kvetch was that the beef rib may have been a tiny bit on the dry side, but when you eat it with a bit of fat or caramel tasting bean ""sauce"" it's freakin' awesome. The brisket has just the perfect amount of back fat on it, the pulled pork... wow what a perfectly delicious and moist pork, the perfect amount of seasoning. I could imagine its taste on a toasted and buttered bun topped with that delicious vinegary crunchy slaw. The pork ribs were perfectly smoked, tender and tasted like goddamn candy is what it was. I could have eaten a bucket of those ribs. The mac was cheesy and well-seasoned. Can't complain about the food, it was far above my expectations, except for one part. No desert? We had to go to Laptopistan  (Second Cup) for that and coffee.I went there with my girlfriend for my birthday expecting a restaurant experience. Unfortunately this restaurant doesn't work that way. You order and quickly get served your food quite rapidly and head on out. Not a place to linger.  The service was great, warm and accommodating. The owner was one cool dude that obviously loves his craft and to explain his process. I would definitely go back from the awesome smoked meats. Many BBQ joints have come and gone in Montréal in this new BBQ madness and some deserved to perish but this one, I hope it sticks around. Authentic BBQ while strolling around in Old Montreal's Old Port? Hell Yeah!For all my biching, I'm still giving it a 4 outta 5 because DAMN GOOD SMOKEHOUSE."

We arrived a few minutes early to our reservation time, but the wait for the food was not crazy long. I really enjoyed the overall look and feel of the place. You walk in and there is the look that screams Barbecue. Now, let's talk about the food. The first thing is that they have 5 meat options and 3 side options. You get two sides and however much meat you want. But, the more meat you order, the less of each meat you get. However, the meaAmazing. I got pulled pork and pork ribs, these were amazing. The ribs were so good, they have that great grizzle on the outside, but juicy meat on the inside. The pulled pork was great too, it's super flavorful and juicy. You get to pick sides and I got the Mac n Cheese. That was the best Mac n Cheese I've ever had. I sampled from my other family members plates the brisket and the beef rib. These were also delicious, juicy, and flavorful. I truly loved this place from the moment I walked in. It's a great dining experience and really a wonderful place to eat. Everything was so juicy and great, I hope to visit Lattuca Barbecue again soon!"

The menu isn't very big but they execute there BBQ to a T. We were a group of 4. So we took everything on the menu. Beef ribs were my absolute favourite. Looked like it came from a dinosaur it was that big.There menu ranges from ribs to pulled pork to there championship brisket. It's very tasty the bark on the meat is delicious. Take the bbq beans as a side. I am not kidding when I say they were the best beans I ever had. Period Would definitely come back. The pitmaster, I think his name is John, know what he's doing! WowThe only issue I had was the decor wasn't that fancy but then again it is BBQ, and took a while for us to get refills on our water and the sides are a little small"

Nothing beats deliciously tender, well seasoned meat that has been smoked for hours. I've had barbecue in Kansas, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida (amongst other places). Well, I can say that John Lattuca has nothing to envy from the most famous pitmasters!His brisket was one of the best I've had in my life. Seasoned to perfection, it was tender and flavourful. So much that I didn't need to drench it in sauce.His beef ribs were awesome as well. I'm not usually a big fan of beef ribs, I prefer babyback pork ribs. I think that's because most places I've had them, they are not tender and hard to eat. Here, it wasn't the case. They were melting and simply perfect.I had taken the Trinity, but unfortunately that day I couldn't taste the pork ribs, they weren't ready. Sadly, I'll have to go back :-)My only complaint would be the sides that came with the Trinity plate. The barbecue beans were excellent, the mac n' cheese however was fairly blend and uninteresting. I would have preferred a slaw, for a fresher/brighter note with the meat, and a little bun (because bread).But overall, an excellent meal, with a generous portion of meat, for a very reasonable price. It was well worth the 30 minutes roundtrip from the office. I'll be back!"

/user_details?userid=PaVSm5eIjcfRr7ek1ZUjbw,Joe S.,"Long Beach, CA",2 star rating,"I think we may have come in at the worst possible time. In any case, it was clear that the owner was not prepared for a night of big business. He was also NOT friendly at all. To break things down:1 - this was a bad weekend to come in (there was apparently a Grand Prix? We didn't know about it). The restaurant was packed by 6pm. Our fault for not making a reservation because it was obvious that whatever popular meat was left was saved for those that did. We even overheard the owner talking to his ""reserved"" guests about all the meats he had after we were told there was only one meat option available. 2 - this place was understaffed tremendously. The owner clearly looked upset that we walked in (our mistake for not reading Yelp) and he seemed so peeved to take our order. He also didn't want to talk to us as much as his customers that made reservations. Why? We were paying customers like everyone else. The waitress asked if we talked to the owner at all before he left. We complimented him on his food and he didn't even thank us! The waitress felt bad and said ""sorry about that, his brain is fried"". Not an excuse for terrible behavior. 3 - food was decent (not as good as American BBQ). Can't believe it took about 30-35 mins to receive it though. At one point, they thought we had eaten already since we were just sitting there. Nope. It would also be nice if there was something that listed the price in writing when you come in. There is no menu, rather, you are told the price from the wait staff. To summarize, we felt we were treated as more inferior to customers that made reservations since we walked in. The wait staff were actually very friendly, but the owner was unnecessarily rude and picky about who he wanted to talk to and take compliments from. Why even bother having a restaurant if you can't treat ALL of your guests with respect?"

/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My boyfriend and I came late on a Saturday night. We were the two last clients in the restaurant and they only had two meats left. Luckily it was exactly the two meats we wanted - one brisket and one beef rib. Unfortunately there was no more side of mac and cheese left. :( I will come back and try it one day. Mark my words. So instead we had the beans and the coleslaw. I know... not Evey exciting. Honestly I wish they had more side options because I wasn't excited about the sides at first. I would have liked some fries or mashed potatoes or cornbread but they don't have any of that stuff. You don't come here for the sides, people! You come here for the meat!! And the meat does not disappoint!! The beef brisket melts in your mouth and it's perfectly fatty and juicy. There was no need for sauce. My bf had the ribs and although it was more dry than the brisket he really enjoyed the ribs. For me, out of the two, the brisket wins hands down! The waiter recommended the beans and frankly I was surprised at how good they were. It's def not like the kind of beans you eat at breakfast places or at Cabane a Sucre. There were different kinds of beans cooked in a delicious dark sauce. It was not too sweet. The coleslaw was like every other coleslaw out there. I had a beer with the meal and I left very full and satisfied. The owner John came around and talked to us. What a  friendly guy! I like that he comes to every table and says hi. Turns out Lattuca is his family name. He was nice enough to offer us a shot of bourbon which we did with him. So fun! The staff was very friendly too. One waiter, Jacob, is an actor who starred in Bon Cop Bad Cop 2 and has an upcoming show on CTV. So cool and he's so down to earth!

/user_details?userid=ggl-d6DodXCmZVt5VJZAdg,Joe N.,"Mount Royal, Canada",1 star rating,"Absolutely horrible. I'll write my review point by point to get my message across : 1. The restaurant is clearly understaffed. 2 people in their so called ""kitchen"" and 1 waiter for roughly 50ish people just isn't enough and this clearly affects their service. 2. Let me delve into the definition of their ""so called"" kitchen : 3 oven-like food warmers where hunks of meats stay warm. The coleslaw they use is 100% store bought. How do I know? I know because it tastes identical to the ""Moishes"" coleslaw you buy from Costco. Oh and the Mac N Cheese is actually good. But too bad I only got 3 bites worth of it on my plate.3. Value.. yea that doesn't exist at this restaurant. 28$ for a plate consisting of : 1 thin pork rib, 1 slice (thin) of brisket and some pulled pork with 3 bites worth of Mac N Cheese (No lie!! 3 bites) and 1 pickle SLICE! with store bought coleslaw. 4. The restaurant is known to run out of food and the waiter gladly warned us about this a week in advance to come early to avoid this happening. I assume that they prepare a certain quantity of food per day and if it runs out, well then they just stop taking people in. We arrive at 6:35pm and they are already running low on food... 35 minutes AFTER THEY OPENED FOR THE DAY... how could this be. 5. So how was the meat? The so called meat that people rant and rave about? It was good. It wasn't bad. That I can't say. Was it the best BBQ I've ever tasted... far from it. All in all, this resto has to fix many things before I consider going back. I was actually looking forward to coming to the restaurant due to the high reviews, but it happens to be that the negative reviews were right this time. -A disappointed customer."

Situated right by the St. Lawrence River, I imagine this is a great spot in the summertime when they open the patio. It's a grill/barbecue house, where the chef has won world-championships on his braising of beef brisket, his pork ribs, and his tenderous pulled pork. Although the pricing was on the more expensive side (starts at $27 a person, plus $2 per additional meat), and hurt my wallet a little (help), the taste is amazing and the portions are generous. Even between my friend and I's hungry boyfriends, they were getting full from the portions... That's how generous it is! Definitely get the pork ribs - super flavourful and meat falls right off the bone - and the beef brisket, that's what they are known for. If you know your BBQ or love ribs, this is the real deal.

The chef and owner John his behind the bar/counter when you enter, giving love and cutting his meat for the night. He explained to us last night that unfortunately, (for the resto but not for us :P) due to the weather many people canceled their reservation for Valentine's Day, and since he smokes just the day before, and only the quantity required based on reservations, he had too much meat. Thus, we had incredibly generous portions, and the chef even passed at our table to offer more ribs. How awesome is that? Lattuca maintains a very strict high quality standard and you can be assured that the what will be served in your plate is the tenderest, juiciest, and most savoury Southern-style barbequed meat ever. Smoked the day before during 14 hours (the waitress explained that 14 hrs is for the brisket, not sure if its the same for their ribs...), and served the next day only. Will be be back."

My experience here was pretty good considering I had a large group of 12 and all of them very demanding (you can't choose your family) and few of them used to attending a place that doesn't have menus since they are older. The waitress we had was on her first night of work and answering our questions really seemed to overwhelm her and when we got our orders confused it started to frustrate us as well. However the owner-who is more than hands on at his establishment- swooped in and helped to sort things out even with an packed house. While I'd give the service here a C+ for their attitude and disorganization (because with a packed house it's even more important to maintain your composure-they didn't.), the food itself is well worth the trip. Don't go here expecting the frills and attention of a 4 or 5 star but come hungry for some kickass BBQ."

/user_details?userid=N0MwA3aqxN8cSA0SbNTXYw,Jerry F.,"Oakville, Canada",5 star rating,"Was visiting from the Toronto area and I am glad I found out about this place via Chowhound.  Definitely one of the better BBQ spots I have had in Canada.  I wouldn't hesitate to go again and the owner and server were both really friendly.  It isn't a fancy spot, they have an open kitchen so you can see them cutting up the meat, preparing your meal.  I can see this place getting really busy on a nice summer's day but when I went they have everything available."
/user_details?userid=aMVMzjSl0qM9QDBe5-d3Yw,Marc Q.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Their brisket and beef rib are pretty damn amazing !Their beer has nothing special, we had to wait quite a bit before ordering, and had really no clear idea of the price we would be asked in the end since there were no written menu, but you instantly forget about it when you taste a bit of their brisket ! It is honestly the best meat I've ever eaten ; I won't forget it and definitely will come back !It's worth noting however, that their prices are not so cheap as they used to be : the trinity which was 17$ is now 26, and since their beer is not cheap either, we ended up paying 45$ with tips and all."
/user_details?userid=PMpe8H12c_Fu3ma2Un-7pg,Phil P.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,"Hands down the best BBQ I've had in Montreal. I've had a hard time finding something comparable to what I've had in the south and this place really hit the spot. John, the owner was very welcoming and really new his history.  His BBQ reflects different regions in the US and adds a Montreal twist. You immediately sense his passion for BBQ.  For those of you who love southern BBQ, this place is for you. No bells and whistles, just good ol' classic BBQ."

/user_details?userid=ERNXFGIRWKYNc8hJnvqrfg,Robert S.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,We found this place while walking through old Montreal.  Oh boy was it good.  Brisket sandwich was just the right amount of tenderness and sweetness.  We were in Texas earlier in the year and this is equal to what you get down there.Mac & Cheese side is good - has a nice light and spicy kick to it.  Coupled with a cold beer - was just awesome.

/user_details?userid=3o0rakYLdLTszk5wxQihIQ,J F.,"Stone Ridge, NY",5 star rating,In Montreal for the evening from NYC. Walked in at the end of the evening and was greeted by the pitmaster John!  I want to say I haven't been treated this well in sometime and the food was so amazing and authentic Texas barbecue! I can't say enough about how great everything was. I would make the 6 hour drive from New York just to eat his amazing food. Thank you John for working so hard to make such a great product.
/user_details?userid=9g_aZreH3QSNJt1ujhGMqw,Dakota S.,"Madison, WI",5 star rating,Great food! The pork ribs and pulled pork were my favorites! They offered four choices the day we went. Go early or make a reservation.
/user_details?userid=NjBenQ1vU_9mYDrpT7zmVQ,Terry M.,"Glens Falls, NY",5 star rating,"Although we arrived without a reservation (first sign of a popular place), we were greeted warmly and told that we could sit anywhere we could find an open table.Unfortunately the draft beer taps were broken, but with a bottle of beer, a glass of white wine and a pitcher of water we anxiously awaited the arrival of our award winning beef brisket! We were very hungry while we waited which only added to the excitement. Once the food arrived, we began what I can only describe as the dance of the BBQ!The Kansas City Pit beans were to DIE for!! I am not a bean fan. Baked beans are about as exciting to me as watching paint dry. These beans were tremendous!!On to the foot+ long beef rib and brisket I had... they were smoked to perfection and tasted fantastic.We hold all BBQ places to pretty high standards as our ""home"" BBQ joint is the Dinosaur BBQ in Syracuse, NY.this place ranked right up there!! As they grow and mature as a business, they will become harder and harder to get into. I'm sure of it. My only suggestion to them would be to offer a couple of different sauces. If you're not into the one that they offer, your stuck eating fantastic BBQ without sauce. So not a bad place to be!!Thank you for the great meal on our impromptu 10th anniversary dinner. You made the night!!"

/user_details?userid=m4pElYGkm8GNbnMLMVzO4Q,Edward H.,"Sydney, Australia",5 star rating,"Tres manufique, BBQ that does not need sauce.  This joint is meat church.  We had 4 way, brisket, pulled pork, pork ribs and a giant beef rib.  These meats are so well cooked that they do not need sauce.  John must be a meat whisperer, he extracts all the flavor that is available in the meats.  Everything was fanflipingtastic!  Beef ribs almost always end up a little dry and chewy.  Somehow these beef ribs were so tender after the meat slipped away from the bone I could gently cut across the grain with my fork (never even looked at the knife) and the depth of flavor was like there was no bone between the marrow and the meat.  Shredded coleslaw, excellent.  Mac n cheese, wanted more.  The beans, damnnn how does he do it??   Large selection of beers and ales, what more did we need?  Nothing, absolutely nothing.  I wish we had this restaurant in the Bay Area.  Make your reservation, get there early, you do not want to miss out.  When the meat is gone it's gone."
/user_details?userid=3CzVRGi8XHwbF7inplvSCA,Matt V.,"Saint John, Canada",5 star rating,Hands down the best barbecue I have ever eaten. We spoke with the owner after our meal and it shows how much he cares about this place and the food he serves! Will definatly be back next time we're in Montreal!
/user_details?userid=q0xqpIGpEvoTMuu5p33eQw,Nathan W.,"Beaconsfield, Canada",5 star rating,The food is out of this world. There are no other restaurants that come close. The Bbq pitmaster has a recipe like no other. The Ribs just fall of the bone and the flavor is amazing. The beans as a side is a must. If you are anywhere on the island of Montreal it is worth the trip.
/user_details?userid=75J9C6setP8iowg15aS4jw,Maurice T.,"Blainville, Canada",5 star rating,"After weeks of reading the reviews about Lattuca BBQ I just couldn't help myself and needed to try it myself. So the good the bad and the ugly. We all had the tray with 4 meats and 2 sides. The brisket and pulled pork by far the best I ever had. So moist and tender and served the way BBQ should be served with no sauce!  The pork ribs also money. Fall off the bone. The beef rib well the best way to describe it is , bark candy. A full dark rim of smoke that will knock your taste buds into a new dimension. As for the sides we liked the beans best. The coleslaw and macaroni and cheese are ok but not great. That's the good part the bad part, well the bad part is your sad because there is not enough food on the tray. I would of liked more especially the brisket and pulled pork. As for the ugly part it's not their fault but the parking is horrible. But overall If your in the neighbourhood don't hesitate one second to try it you will go home happy happy!"
/user_details?userid=zVecvSQVbmsVA1fpEtd07w,Sarah D.,"Vaughan, Canada",4 star rating,"Weird concept place. Its slow cooked meat and when its gone they close the restaurant. Its a new place as well so there are some kinks in their service but the atmosphere was cool. We happened to go in without reservations and they had just seated a party of 12 so the service was really slow and we had to wait about an hour to get served and fed. But it was worth it. my gilrfriend and I both had two meats and two sides. there are four meats to choose from, pork and beef ribs, beef brisket and pulled pork. The pork rib and the beef brisket were by far the best with the sauce on the pork ribs really shining for us. The sides were mac and cheese coleslaw and baked beans all of which were awesome although were really small and left us slightly unsatisfied. Would go again this time making reservations, and probably getting more meats. More expensive than expected but the service atmosphere and quality of the food was worth it."
