/user_details?userid=YUlBxBTPMPM3mawg4Opuvw,Haque I.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Went to this place for the first time yesterday for a friend's see-off brunch before he heads to France. None of us tried this place before and our soon-to-be-France-bound friend wanted to try out this place before he left Montreal. We are happy that Chez Jose didn't disappoint us! The place was super nice and they were super accommodating. We also took our dog Pico with us and they also provided him water in dog-specific bowl. This just shows how well prepared they are. There were other dogs on the terrace and all the owners were enjoying their meals while the dogs were just chilling/mingling with each other. The portion size is really generous and the all the veggies were super fresh. The food was really really tasty and we will definitely be back. The only small disappointment was the latte. I think it was overextracted and thus was bitter.

/user_details?userid=rkPrz6uwJIefZdH2Oqv4Tg,Christian C.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The vibe of this place has sent me back to my summer vacation in Portugal, in the middle of a cold winter day in Montreal. The staff is really fun and playful and the deco matches their spirit.They do brunch on Sundays and I had the best tofu dish spiced up with Portuguese flavors and vegetables, served with the most amazing toasted bread roll soaked in delicious olive oil. There's a selection of vegan cakes too, as well as plant milks for coffee. Will need to come back and sample some cakes"
/user_details?userid=xg_96kkO-lF9oCc1PzrQgA,Leo L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Wow, that was disappointing. A nasty experience. The thing is that this review has nothing to do with the food, since I couldn't try it. This is about the disgraceful service at Chez José.I got there with two of my friends on a Sunday for brunch. There were already two tables on the waiting list, but the host told me it was a 15-20-minute wait. Hence, we thought it should be ok to wait.Two other groups of 2 and 3 arrived after us and demanded to be put on the waiting list. 20 minutes went by, and people kept coming out of the restaurant, but no tables were assigned. Then, a group of 6 who had been just waiting for 5 minutes got a table.  Strike 1.Surprised and a bit annoyed, I approached the host to ask her why this was happening. With a smile she answered that my friends and I were the next on the list, but it was easier for them to assign a table for 6. Strike 2. Another 30 minutes under the sun went by. We were starving, (getting hangry here glare) but no one was called. Rarely one of the hosts came out to tell us what we already knew: ""You are next on the list, as soon as a table is available"". Strike 3.We decided to leave since not even a cup of coffee, or a glass of water was offered to make the wait more bearable. No options were offered by the staff. We were really hungry and starting to feel weak. It was awful that they did not show any interest in apologizing for the misfortunate situation. To who is reading this, just think that another two groups were still waiting after us. My thoughts. No one deserves to be treated like this. First, don't lie to your costumers if the wait will take for longer. Second, if various groups are already waiting for over 20 minutes, do not offer a table to a larger group because it makes things ""easier"". Not only was it disrespectful, but it displayed a lack of professionalism and touch from the staff. I suggest that if you see a line of people here ask the food to to-go, because the kitchen seems to be quick, but the staff not so much. I am sorry I have to disagree about how amazing this place is, because our experience was the entire opposite."

Food was delicious but when it came time to pay, ATM wasn't working properly and only in French. Our group paid in US dollars $80 (approximately $60 CAD) for a $79 CAD bill. The waitress then demanded an additional tip since it is not included even though we overpaid.  Enjoy your $25 CAD tip-- your pastries were ice cold and had to be reheated."
/user_details?userid=nscuBIjiVL3o0bpdP-iG4Q,B P.,"Villanova, PA",3 star rating,"Very tiny restaurant in what seems to be a residential neighborhood. You will literally rub against other patrons as there is very little space. We were 5 and took half the place. There is only one bathroom and it's more of a closet in which a toilet was dropped.The foods is bar-type, with sandwiches being the primary offer. Not a lot of variety. 5 soups on the menu but only one available. The food was well cooked, but more on the greasy side. There are vegan options though.They are cash only, but there is a ATM machine inside."
/user_details?userid=ryQsc-8qVknTl3j0TWGukA,Rc L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I came once for brunch with a group of friends and another time for a more intimate meeting over coffee. Chez José offered a laid back and casual backdrop for both settings. True, the tables are really close together and it's cash only, but the food is great and their mocahccinos (with nut milk) is so creamy and satisfying. A lovely local place owned by a cute couple."
/user_details?userid=LPDOx50zUR-rEovzOhADbA,Rachel C.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,"When I went to Chez José I was really hungry, which turned out to be my first mistake. This place seems more like a ""light brunch"" spot, and one should definitely not go here if they have a big appetite... after looking through the menu I asked the waitress which is more filling, the vegan burrito or the sandwich and she said ""definitely the burrito"" so I followed her advice. Huge mistake. The burrito was about the size of a wrap, and was the smallest burrito I've ever seen. The burrito was fine, but not amazing-- definitely try it with hot sauce. It was served with a salad that included chick peas, and an array of beans covered in a creamy dill sauce... not my favorite... so I ended up just eating the tiny burrito and I was still hungry afterwards of course. The sandwich looks way more filling from the other photos on yelp so if I go back I'll try that instead. Also it was pretty annoying that I had to keep asking my waitress for more water despite being the only people in the small restaurant. Also, this is a cash only restaurant."
/user_details?userid=i7dva-DqwjyAtLVc2idhNA,Pradeep K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My order here is always the same, Churasco sandwich; grilled chicken with avocado and cucumbers; and a Psychedelic smoothie. They take only cash so keep that in mind before heading there, place can get a bit cramped so claustrophobics, you should stay away.I could try other sandwiches and smoothie, but I know the ones I like, so why fix something that ain't broke!"
/user_details?userid=fA-jhIbxXOySixtjtO-j8g,Alexandria E.,"Oakland, NJ",5 star rating,"Love, love, love!! My hubby and I stopped in Montreal for one night traveling from Clayton, NY to Bar Harbor, ME. Everything about Chez Josè was just so perfect! The decor, the people, THE FOOD! I had a delicious Vegan Burrito w/ lentils, Parsley and coriander salsa, hummus, beets, carrots and lettuce. Mark had the Déjeuner Portugais- 2 fried eggs, Portuguese chorizo, sautéed potatoes and peppers served with salad and toast. We gave the chef a thumbs up. His response "" I cook with passion, intensity and punctuality!"""
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love everything about this place: the tight and snug space; the everything-is-a-bit-greasy-and-busted decor; the staff; the menu- it all makes me happy inside. It really feels like a family joint: they're family and they treat the neighbourhood like family.The only thing I order/likely will ever order here is the Portuguese breakfast. Thing is, it's everything I want: chorizo, potatoes, heavily buttered toast, a breakie salad, and two over-easy and well seasoned eggs. Perfection. That being said, my partner has had the gamut of vegan options here (which are relatively plentiful!) and his fave is definitely the veggie pâté sandwich. The vegan burrito is also good but a little too modest in size.One thing I'll say is that the place tends to get packed, particularly on summer weekends. Anticipate potentially waiting a moment outside for your table."
/user_details?userid=_iEifRDtMcDoVpc5BregGA,Smitha R.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"Such a cool spot. I got the dejeuner vegan bplate and it was a LOT of food but so good that I finished it all. Haha!

/user_details?userid=RUKirL-nehMd7DkyPsWM2Q,Cathy J.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Awesome brunch place on Duluth with deliciously fresh food, including vegan options. Beautifully muraled on the outside, green, airy, and cozy on the inside. I loved everything about my tofu breakfast dish, which was so big it came in 2 separate dishes. The salad and potatoes were especially amazing on opposite sides of the culinary spectrum: the salad was so light and fresh, and the potatoes were hot and spiced to perfection. The hot sauce on each table adds a little extra kick! Cash only"
/user_details?userid=l1zgZMoiD82HvvsiZVC8Ww,David K.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This is my favourite sandwich in all of Montreal. The chicken is perfect, the seasoning is amazing. I always get the sandwich and smoothie combo. Unfortunately I don't live in Montreal so I can't eat here often, but this is always my first stop when I visit every few months."
/user_details?userid=mM5phAV3wjCXfYw0LUmcng,Josephine P.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Stumbled upon this place accidentally, and left a happier satisfied person. The staff is extremely cordial, they seem joyous to bring their culture to this tiny gem of a restaurant and were willing to alter their dishes a bit based on dietary restrictions. There are over a million cutesy decor accents to look at, I loved the photographs. I almost wanted to take the tuxedo pig and the flamingo statue with me. We ordered the spicy Mexican omelette (I am already day dreaming about this), the Portuguese breakfast (could keep eating this all day everyday) and the Vegan Burrito. We all absolutely loved this place the very instant we entered. It felt like we had transported to a South American diner with all its ethnicity. Brownie points to this place for being pet friendly. Did I mention they have the cutest puppy 'coffee machine guardian'? I highly recommend this place to everyone and would go again for the omelette soon."

The atmosphere was funky, the food was wonderful and there was a great community feel amongst the guests and staff. We had the veggie salad and an egg dish with spicy chicken - they were able to ensure all the food was gluten free by swapping out some tortillas for Gf bread. The waitress was awesome and even helped us to determine w head parked our car in a safe spot! Don't miss out on this spot!!"

The chicken was marinated well, the portion was small but it was only around $6. My friend had the mexican style dish, it was like an omelette with chicken and mushroom stuffings served on a crusty bread with salad on the side. It was around $11, it was filling and tasty."

It was kind of absurd. Probably like an hour. But luckily we didn't care because we were catching up.The breakfast burrito was cheap and stocked with delicious fresh ingredients. Combined with hot ham and cheddar cheese, the eggs were perfectly complimented. The burrito had the perfect balance of oozy fattiness and fresh veggies. I don't remember the wrap so it must have been pretty good. I recommend checking this cool little cozy spot out when you're in the Plateau."
/user_details?userid=EaBKe-8LB-NHuH7Us-QhGw,Vincent V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Met up a friend with a friend for brunch Chez José the other day. Low Key one of the more eccentric places I've been to in a while. My friend lives around the corner and selected this place for the group.I ordered a cappuccino, which was made in the style of a second wave coffee shop, which means a very tall foam, and a light touch with the milk. The smoothies are very delicious tho and if I wasn't such a coffee addict I would have stuck to those. I highly recommend it.I ordered a chouriço  and egg dish, which was great. The chouriço was cooked with peppers, onions and potatoes, which allowed the potatoes to soaked up all the goodness from the ingredients, and the egg was spiced up.Cool place overall, the decors is instagram-worthy too."

I'm allergic to dairy, so they offer soy milk or almond milk to prepare your drinks, it also, as most places in Canada, offer gluten free options. The ambience is cool and the service is great."
/user_details?userid=RZUrmsaUiFKmZQvxuuk4UQ,Madhu K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I visited this place for Sunday brunch. A small cute family run bakery, very colorful with old tables and chairs. There menu is short and crisp. They have the Portuguese breakfast which is served all day. There are sandwiches, and vegan options too. I tried their Orangine smoothie with the marinated chicken breast sandwich. The smoothie was tasty and the sandwich was filling. The place is operated by family and hence you get a perfect service. I also liked to window shop the near by thrift shops :)"

It's colorful and funky inside, with big windows, and has wonderfully friendly staff. I stopped by just before leaving Montreal to get two veggie omelet sandwiches to go, and the chef created a meal that carried us back to DC feeling happy and warm. He added hummous, which I thought would be weird, but which worked beautifully in the sandwiches. Nice smoothies too."

Our waitress seemed sweet at first, and then proceeded to say ""can these people leave"" before closing time (in Spanish thinking we wouldn't understand). Also you can't use card- they have an ATM where you can withdraw cash for a fee."

/user_details?userid=RgbQNq91CZatl9HedcXDqw,Bashard B.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"Loved the atmosphere and energy of this place. We just went out and picked this place because it was close by the condo that we rented. They have a combo where you can get a breakfast smoothie and a breakfast sandwich for 10 bucks. I got a mango, banana smoothie and a veggie breakfast sandwich. The menu is in French, and the waitresses speak on French, Portuguese, and English so that is convenient."
/user_details?userid=VZt37GDS0fEEQNDMzsdFpg,Jay R.,"Woodside, Queens, NY",4 star rating,"The food was really good. If you're looking for a tasty and cheap breakfast then this is a solid option. It's a bit far from the metro but definitely worth it. I asked for avocado on the side and never received it, so that was a bummer. My hot chocolate was given to me almost half way into my meal. Those are the only two reasons why I didn't give this place 5 stars. Other than that, it's an amazing option."

Coffee woke me up and the food was ON point. If I lived in Montreal this would definitely be a place I would frequently visit. Would suggest for groups of 4 or less since the place is on the small side. Definite thumbs up.
/user_details?userid=OiPrb8KOGxvpDZR_9Zfpyw,Metta H.,"Lachine, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This cafe, restaurant has been one of my favorites since early 2000's. A cute bohemian eatery that boasts some portuguese sandwiches, soups and smoothies. Although the decor remains the same, the food quality leaves little to be desired. If I walked in the small place and time warped back to their glory days I would be none happier. But we are almost  2018 and their Churasco sandwich has surged to double the price which I didn't mind as much given all things inflate particularly prices, but that doesn't justify why the sandwhich needs to be half the thickness of what it once was. Before it was a healthy portion of chicken filet and plenty of avocado which was for all intensive purposes a meal. Now it is a just a snack or tease at best. One of my other favorites was the seafood soup, a hearty tomato soup with mussels and calmar. Well what I got was a thick mystery base oversalted  with dried up mussels and calmar   which appeared to be sitting for hours before serving. I now feel like I need to camp on the throne with stomach issues. In all fairness, It was sad to see a favorite eatery of mine wither away into medocrity, my hopes of this review is for the management to see this and know that moderate inflation is acceptable with customers but keeping standards high and the quality and portions of food should be uncompromised."
/user_details?userid=3z8e2zxgXcqxCbcj1MgxfQ,Glennys E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Will never get enough of this place. I live close by and go often, which is how Chez Jose is meant to be enjoyed - it's very neighbourhoody, kinda like going to a relative's for dinner, complete with Milo the puppy! I bring all my out of town visitors here, sometimes more than once. The food is always delicious, and the prices cannot be beat. Love the chorizo omelette, churassco sandwich, ham and cheese, their soups, the smoothies, and their coffee, and the fruit crepes...I know the menu by heart and I still struggle with what to get every time because it is just that good. The housemade hot sauce is so smoky and tasty we use about half a bottle every time we go in. Don't miss out.As expected for a busy small place with a small kitchen, service can be a bit slow and disorganized at times, especially if you go in a group. While this might frustrate some people, for me it kind of adds to the casual and intimate vibe - but I felt I should be honest for the sake of a review. They recognize this though and are very up front about it and always do their best to accommodate us. If you have the time (and patience, don't be a dick), I would highly highly recommend Chez Jose."
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I think I've just found possibly the perfect brunch place in the Plateau so far (plus L'Avenue, of course). In a district that is already known for having the best food in Montréal, Chez José manages to stand out among the best of the best in serving up classic Portuguese breakfast dishes at affordable prices. It also has a very cute and tiny atmosphere that tends to get crowded at busy hours especially with the laid back manner of the staff, but the food they serve makes the wait worth it.I ordered the Portuguese breakfast, which came with fried eggs in a smoky sauce along with a chorizo, potato, and bell pepper stir fry that came with a salad and some bread. I also got a berry smoothie to drink with it. Since I came with my parents, my mom got an omelette that contained ham, spinach, and feta if I remember correctly (among other things), and it came with salad and bread. She also got a smoothie that was orange-colored (I forgot what flavor it exactly was). As for my dad, he got the omelette sandwich with ham and chorizo and a bowl of the seafood soup. The food took about 20-30 minutes to arrive, but it was so good that we ended up not caring about the wait anyway.The smoothies tasted fresh, fruity, and were clearly made using minimal amounts of added sugar, which I loved. As for my dish, the combination of perfectly cooked fried eggs with fatty chorizo and roasted potatoes and bell peppers was amazing, and it was like a flavor party in my mouth. The salad that I had tasted so much better than a lot of salads I've had in my life, and the bread was freshly baked, fluffy, and still warm from the oven. I tried my parents' dishes and the balance of all of the ingredients in the omelette was spot-on, especially with how they managed to add just enough cheese but not enough to be overbearing. The omelette sandwich tasted like your average breakfast sandwich but better and probably more healthy to be honest, and the seafood soup had the perfect amounts of tomato and seafood flavor from the squid and mussels to warm the soul. I was quite sad when we finished our meal as I didn't want it to end - everything was so good!I have made this brunch recommendation to many of my friends ever since I ate here, and I will definitely use it and its close proximity to my house as excuses to come back on a more regular basis."

/user_details?userid=AII0Sf_7xsxf4hMRNCPZ-Q,Lizzie B.,"Quincy, MA",4 star rating,"Jason L and I had our last breakfast in Montreal here. We arrived, rather despondent about the prospect of the long way home. We left, properly caffeinated, with full bellies, and perhaps a little bit cheerier. Things of note:1. The breakfast list is limited: They have a full Portuguese breakfast (eggs, chorizo, bread), a delicious chicken/avocado sandwich, pastries and the like. 2. I highly recommend the chicken, cheese, and avocado sandwich. The chicken is thinly sliced and spicy- and pairs well with the homemade hot sauce they provide. Despite it's small size, it is also very filling.3. They do not have ""drip"" coffee, only espresso drinks. If you ask for a ""regular coffee"" (meaning drip) the server will become annoyed and/or confused. Several groups of American tourists, ours included, were greeted with death stares for questioning the greatness that is an Americano. 4. They are cash only. They do not have an ATM on sight. The closest ATM is two blocks away in an often closed convenience store- so come prepared!5. Seating is a bit tight - especially when it is busy. The cafe probably only holds 20 people tops. 6. The food and cafe drinks are reasonably priced - think $1.50 Canadian for an Americano. 7. I should note- that I server spoke English- which was helpful considering my abysmal French. A word to a wise however-   attempting to speak French - will at least endear you a bit more to folks. Aggressively speaking English at the beginning of a conversation is rude.Cafe Jose is a perfect place to go when you finally get sick of all the French/Quebecois food you've gorged yourself on all week."

/user_details?userid=zX0v7edWnSAo-8hEly-_1w,Niem X.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"I am just so happy that this place exists. The food is amazing, the atmosphere is wonderful, the prices are great. The seafood soup is my favourite thing on the menu. For just $6, you get a big hot bowl of happiness with a healthy serving of mussels and a lovely piece of bread on the side. The seafood soup is only offered Friday through Sunday I believe.So what if you go on another day of the week, and there's no soup? Or you want something to go along with the soup? (I ordered crepes + soup once, that was waaaaaay too much food. The soup serving is quite generous). You can go sweet or savoury, or since things are pretty cheap, do both. I'm a big fan of the crepes (about $8) - one order gets you two! Chez Jose is pretty well known for its churrasco sandwich (chicken and avocado), which I think is good and delicious but not amazing. They also have a lot of different smoothies. I would highly recommend having brunch, lunch, or an early dinner at Chez Jose. It's not a huge place, so I don't think you want to go in a group bigger than 4. Go alone  or go with a friend, you won't regret it. The restaurant/cafe is also beautiful - nice windows, hippie-ish but unpretentious casual vibe.(Note, bring cash, though there's an ATM nearby)"

/user_details?userid=Ctrp5IoEKHkixDSIyYHDpw,Nick S.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"The owner of nearby D Liche (awesome cupcakes) enthusiastically recommended I check out Chez José's chorizo sandwich, and as the creator of some of the finest cup-based desserts I've ever tasted, that's a recommendation you listen to!Turns out that was a good decision. The chorizo sandwich is amazing. At first, you think it's just a pretty good sandwich. But as you eat, the flavor evolves and the interplay of ingredients starts channeling Remy from Ratatouille. The cheese is nestled between two slices of tasty chorizo. There are fresh pickles which add a pleasant crisp to every bite. The bread is squishy but just so. It's almost sandwich sorcery.For good measure, I also had a Mexican empanada, which was excellent. It was only $3 and damn near filled the plate. Coupled with their hot sauce - which is actually HOT - it made for a nice second offering.I'll be back for more chorizo and to try out their smoothies next time."

Chez Jose was a lucky find when we were trying to go to a different place that was closed. GF had a tofu veggie dish full of flavor. My sandwich was unbelievable good, the Portuguese bread was so fresh and delicious, I even considered order a second one. Cheap doesn't mean mediocre cuisine, this is a great restaurant, I rather eat here than in many $$$ I tried during my visit to Canada. Well done Jose, whoever you are. Service was good considering the place to was packed and there was only one girl taking care of everything."

It was right around the corner from my boyfriends', so on weekends we'd head on over with bedhead to wake up with the most heavenly 'cafe au lait' and 'pain au chocolat' you've ever tasted. The delicate pastry was always perfectly light, crispy and buttery and the inside chocolate melted in your mouth like a divine communion. We'd hang out at the tables in the funky little shop, and lazily watch the people on Avenue Duluth or study while we ate. It's cash only, which was no problem; as students, we didn't have credit anyway! They have the most incredible guacamole chicken sandwiches here, made with fresh chicken breast and roasted vegetables. These were the only things I ordered on the menu. They became rituals, study treats, weekend getaways and tantalizing Montreal memories."

Luckily, for travelers, Chez Jose continues to open their doors for tasty meals at an cheap fare. The menu is only in French so make sure to let the waitress/waiter know if there's any confusion. I had their Mexican omelette sandwich with cheddar cheese and chicken. It was so yummy that I wish we were there right now. Hub had the chicken with avocado and cheese but it was not as flavorful as mine. We also had their coffees which was just ok. Go with their sandwiches, any combo, smoothies, and pastries. When in doubt, do what most French Canadians order- chocolate croissant and a coffee/cappuccino to go. The spot is located in the Portuguese and latin quarters of the neighborhood. A lot of homeless and crazies in the street so be careful of your belongings and bags!"

/user_details?userid=epc3A9SHHBfOwxIOCPW7eA,Lindsay W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Chez Jose is where people in the know in the Plateau congregate for reckless banter, delicious food, and a proper cafe au lait. The unpretentious, colourful staff make this the perfect weekend hangover spot.There are three things you gotta try chez Jose:1. The omelette sandwich custom - lots of home-made hot sauce on the side.2. The colada freshly blended smoothie - and I recommend you stop by the nearby SAQ to spike your smoothie with a mickey of not-too-cheap rum.3. Try and hop-on the owner Jose's motorcycle, a classic American model, and go for a ride around the block (take a picture!)This is a real neighbourly spot. Faithful to its Portuguese origins, it uses the big white bun familiar to those used to eating chicken sandwiches on the plateau, and some other typical ingredients like chorizo. On Fridays, they have the best fish soup around.If you go there frequently enough, you might end up sitting right below a picture of you hanging on the wall. And you probably will, because Chez Jose is a small island of kite surfing lovers and beautiful people sipping fresh juices along the coast of hot Duluth pavements."

I generally go for an early-morning breakfast or brunch and though it can be tough to get a seat in this teeny-tiny restaurant, it's well worth the wait. The omelette sandwiches are particularly good and incredibly inexpensive, especially considering the fact that you can load them up with absolutely any filling and incur no extra cost. Coming in a close second, though, is their amazing chicken sandwich, which has just the right amount of spicy mayo on a perfectly-cooked chicken breast. Accompanied by a smoothie (for a combined price of only $8), even the bill is satisfying.Also worth a mention is the incredibly charming staff, who are not only friendly but will always go the extra mile. When I went in for a family brunch and found there were no seats left, they set up a terasse just for us and successfully won our business for years to come."

All that is on the menu is worth tasting. Signature dishes include omelettes, crepes and smoothies. The pastries are good, too. The only thing that saddens me is that I can't have all I enjoy there at once, it would be too much for one meal.The owner and staff are outdoorsy and very friendly. One can notice funny notes here and there that change over time to reflect recent internet memes."

I the Omlette with him trying the beef soup and with Pina Colada smoothie each. They were delicious and cheap for the price. The place was cozy, giving a lot of one-on-one interaction time. the Chocolate tarte was yummy too. We took it to-go and ate it along the way out. The food was good, with great service and nice and friendly environment. Definitely will come back!"

Ordered a chausson aux pomme... It was SO good, packed with apple... I will make a bee-line there when I head to Montreal next."

Omelettes and empanadas are DELICIOUS. The service is laid back and friendly. Also, they do not mock my awful attempts at French."

Everyone recommended this place, so I wanted to give it a try. Very mellow atmosphere, which is the right mood to start off any morning. I had an omelet, which was delicious. Then topped it off with some orange juice and some pain au chocolat. The pain au chocolat was Amazing. Capital A."
