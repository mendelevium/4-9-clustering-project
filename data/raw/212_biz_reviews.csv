/user_details?userid=yERJfPKhhU49aJAJ6DvqEg,Sian D.,"Kirkland, Canada",5 star rating,"Bloomfield is a Mediterranean inspired brunch spot in Montreal that serves brunch on the weekends from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm.I could go on forever about how much I love this place. The food, the decor, the staff... just amazing!! Do yourself a favor and go. You won't regret it!I was first drawn to this restaurant by its beautiful decor. The place is quaint and cozy, with benches and pillows lining the edges, wood paneling along the walls and a little book shelf in the middle of the restaurant. In addition, there are cute floral pictures in one corner and gorgeous flowers hanging from the ceiling in another. The food is served on plates of an assortment of colors so, overall, the aesthetic is A1. The food is on the same level of the decor. Their menu is limited but what is on it is absolutely delicious. I've tried everything on the menu and I have nothing negative to say about any of it. There are similar flavors running through all the meals but they all have a distinct feel to them. The Palestinian Eggs are more zesty with a mix of the spicy tomato sauce and cucumber salad. The Turkish Eggs (my favorite) are more garlicky. And the Bloomfield Granola and the French Toast are the sweetest plates on the menu. If you are going with a group or even just two people, I strongly recommend the Jerusalem Platter. It comes with tons of tasty spreads and it is way too much for a single person. It's definitely a great way to try many different flavors and not lose the classic brunch necessity (eggs). Overall, I had an amazing experience at this restaurant and it won't be long before I'm back again :)"

I understand why I see several Instagram posts about that place, the interior is beautiful and soothing. When I arrived it was already packed, I hesitated to come back later so that it wouldn't affect my experience, but I was hungry so I took a chance.I was seated at the very end of the bar between a nearby table, a couple who was seated at the bar as well and a post, needless to say that it was very difficult to get to my seat. My view was not bad either directly on the accumulation of dirty dishes in the kitchen (yum!).I ordered a latte with their Turkish eggs which came with two slices of burnt bread... uh, I mean sourdough bread. OK, I did not like my dish at all...there was absolutely nothing to see there, a bit of flavourless yogurt with two lonely eggs in the middle of a plate that would visually appeal to social media but that concretely brings absolutely nothing to the palate. The two ultra-burnt slices did not help either. It was just really bad and I rarely say that.Needless to say, that I won't be back, there are many other places in Montreal that serve much better brunches. However I have to say that service is impeccable."

Bloomfield is a little bistro where simple plates are prepared with fresh vegetables and local products with a Mediterraneen flair.Bright and sunny place the flowers on the ceiling will brighten up  your gloomy days. The menu is diverse and well presented. There is a lot of plant based choice. I got the chance to taste the whole menu. My favorite would be the Plestinian plater where you really have the opportunity to experience a different type of brunch and how they incorporate the spices. The spices are very subtle but definitely there. This plate is made to share: Babaghannouj, pumpkin mutabal, zaatar labneh, grilled halloumi, beet hummus, dak dak salad, sumac eggs,granola and toasted sourdough and pita bread.They also liked the Bloomfield Granola. Matcha, silky yogurt (so nice), toasted nuts tahini and date syrup and fruits. Avocado toast is far from being boring with chimichurri, organic colorful pamegranate seeds and watercress."

The food has a middle eastern twist, and we shared the Jerusalem platter. It is a smorgasbord of delights, hummus, babaganouj, etc. Artfully presented, the food just melts in your mouth. It makes sense it is located across the street from Damas, another Middle Eastern 5 star delight! Come here with a big appetite. You won't be disappointed.From the service, to the ambiance, to the INCREDIBLE food, this is an experience you won't soon forget."
/user_details?userid=lA5qQlk2fHEcXCDTuX3qsA,Jean-Francois C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,when to Bloomfield a Sunday morning. I like the vibe. The menu is small but everything look good. I decide to go with the Palestinian plate delicious my friend take Turkish one was good to. Only one thing the plate are a little bit small. The deco is intimat and I especially like the flowers on the celling. A very good spot in the area for breakfast and brunch.

Located across from Damas, this lil gem is really something. What a solid choice and such an aesthetically well-decorated restaurant, with all the colourful flowers and what not. I started off with an oat milk latte. Then, my friend and I indulged by ordering the to share platter ""le Plateau de Jerusalem"". Delightful spread of cheese, dips, bread, salads, yoghurt parfait and pita. The best thing is that you can even reserve a spot in advance. No more waiting in line in cold winter!"

The dishes are well presented and the service is outstanding.They have a latté with an ice cream sandwich in it can you believe? I highly recommend.Also the decor is quite simple and fresh.  It is a small restaurant not suitable for bigger crowds i'd say but thats it charm. True gem in outremont."
/user_details?userid=EJ5ybtY1FqieuS22LHbT1w,Claire L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Brunch Review:I hit up Bloomfield for brunch this past week. The chef who used to cook up brunch at Cafe Melbourne is now making up the menu. All of the plates have a Lebanese spin to them. I have a feeling the menu rotates. I ordered the Palestinian Eggs. Was well seasoned and a large plate! The $20 price tag was a bit off putting. I would say it should be readjusted to $18 ish. For brunch to have that expensive of a price point for just a plate is a real statement...I was a bit disappointed that they only had almond milk. I feel considering how trendy their spot it that they should have a few more options.Note that this place is super tiny inside. I would recommend making a reservation. They will also take your big winter coat to help make a bit of room. Super well decorated and trendy vibe :)
/user_details?userid=BZJ_GKer6GBV-7fB0_4asw,Liza F.,"Montgomery, NY",4 star rating,Great location. We ate outside in the small patio with a bunch of girls for brunch. We had the platter and the French toast and everything was delicious. The wait staff was helpful and friendly. Definitely a place to check out if you're in the area.
/user_details?userid=R5eW6Tt3FVR0_5TAwTS_iQ,Andrea S.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Best brunch I've had in 29 countries. Love is infused in every bite. They are masterful at balancing savoury and sweet. It's worth making a special trip here even if it's out of your way. I wish they had one in Vancouver, I'd eat there every weekend."
/user_details?userid=wvoW8moQdbxz3MhpMuGj5g,Echo L.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"If I were the owners of this place I would find premises twice the size and I would expand. Because it's got a winning formula. Delicious platters of middle eastern yummy things. And great egg dishes. And the best French toast I have ever eaten. I mean this French toast is worth flying to Montreal for.  The wait staff could be a little more attentive. Everyone at my table would have ordered more coffees during our meal but we couldn't get the waitress's attention. She seemed quite captivated by someone in the kitchen. But that aside, the food is fabulous. And all the place needs now is more space. For more wait staff. More diners. And ultimately more profits for the owners. This place is a winner."
/user_details?userid=MDXqulpNz_WcAJd-mclwoA,Jackie S.,"Mont-Royal, Canada",4 star rating,"Went to Bloomfield for brunch and I've got to say it was a solid choice especially if your looking for a place in Outremont. The staff was friendly, the food was interesting and made with great care. The only thing is that the restaurant is on the small side so it may not be the best option for a group. I am planning to go back again soon and see the changes they have made to their menu."
/user_details?userid=BMUHVq9VRvBNHGw48ZH-fQ,Emma N.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Our dinner at Bloomfield was so good that we decided to go back for their brunch on the weekend. The restaurant is cozy and beautifully decorated, and their staff are some of the nicest people I've encountered. They were also accommodating on a Friday night when we walked in without a reservation. As for the food, our meals were both amazing in taste and presentation. I can't wait to come back."
/user_details?userid=gmqXlAyZxFc2w3cndc13dw,Amrita L.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Absolutely loved this place! Hidden gem, cute restaurant and the food tasted absolutely wonderful. The ambience is Unbelievable, the host is so kind and friendly and passionate. Do try the maple syrup dessert which was stamped and appreciated by the famous Anthony Bourdain himself! Do not miss this fabulous place if you are in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=sHC51CSF2aBS9_KSONIQ3g,Michael F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious meals, impeccable service, ideal location. Second visit, this time with a larger group (we were five). The service was excellent and helpful, and fluently bilingual (a great help to my guests, all from Vancouver and with no functional French). The group ate soup, lamb, burger, chicken, and all of it was sublime. Bottle of wine, some great desserts, and suddenly we were almost three hours into the evening. Le Bloomfield sits at the top of my go-to, intimate restos."
/user_details?userid=kZ33Q31_qQ0TBBIuuq31cA,April Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The mushroom toast was good, and also tried with socca. Service were nice and warm. It's nice to have a try with the Nice tradition, but not really my style, and also a little bit overpriced. Might not go again."
