/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Before I jump into my review, let me just preface this by saying that this place is NOT for the calorie-counters/waist watchers/dieters out there. Glad we got that out of the way.Onto the review: you've GOT TO try this place out! It's a small restaurant in the heart of Verdun that serves delicious Mauritian food. Granted, a lot of the items are deep fried, but that's part of the package.Pros: - BYOW- Excellent prices for quality/quantity- Variety of food- Yumminess Cons:- Deep fried everything so the health conscious will need to limit their visits We both had the table d'hote and although I can't remember everything we tried, here's what I do know:- Fried cabbage: Soooo good and basically unlimited (you can keep asking for more). Who knew you could turn something so healthy into something so sinful?- Calamari: Not bad but not amazing- Coconut shrimp: Deeeelicious- Mauritian noodles with beef: SO goodService is great and prices are perfectly reasonable. I will absolutely be back and recommend this awesome place to anyone and everyone I know looking for something a little different. 5 stars for Les Délices de l'Île Maurice!!"
/user_details?userid=VeEM--3NvAQ_b_R8g05CkQ,Adele D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This will become one of my go-to spots in the sud-ouest for delicous food at a very fair/reasonable price, especially given that its a BYO. We ordered the crispy ginger fish & shrimp ($16) and the shrimp&fish combo (also $16) in a garlic sauce. Both were delicious, and were served with rice, a green salad, a crispy cabbage appetizer and a zesty curry dal soup - all delightful. The service was great too, and the atmosphere well suited for casual (potentially loud) small-group dinners. Overall, a wonderful family-run gem of an establishment in the neighbourhood! Only wish they were open more evenings during the week (currently, only Friday and Saturday nights)."
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"When i first moved to Verdun (i don't live there anymore), this was one of the first restaurant that i've been to. I fell in love! The owners are SUPER friendly. The husband in the kitchen and the wife in the front of the house. They make you feel like you are part of the family and you do feel that way.The food...it has this homemade comforting soul food style to it. It's like going to an aunt's house for dinner. The price is more then reasonable. You can eat well for around 20$ per person. When you order a main, it automatically comes with a portion of deliciously crispy fried cabbage and a soup. Appetizers are about 4-5$. My favourite would be the fried coconut shrimp appetizer, fish and shrimp dish or the lamb shank. It comes with salad and rice. The main dishes are around 15$, give or take. I NEVER finish my plate! That's how big the portions are. I would once in awhile drive all the way there just for the food. Plus, they always recognizes their regulars. Even after a year abroad on hiatus like me ;)IT'S BYOB!!!"
/user_details?userid=CLfqC-AQJLkmOHV3d-KCZg,Kandi R.,"La Salle, Canada",4 star rating,"Almost perfection!First thing worth mentioning is the waiter we had: he was the most adorably polite person on the face of the planet...i gave him a huge hug at the end of the night cuz he was just THAT amazing. He was patient and friendly and polite and just excellent every step of the way! I don't like seafood so that limited my menu options severely. That being said I still thoroughly enjoyed my chicken in Cajun sauce. And the vegetarian samossas I ordered as an entrée were delightful! (6 tiny phyllo wrapped triangle samossas that were beautifully seasoned and perfectly conceived!) One of my friends ordered the lamb in Créole sauce with 2 fishy entrées, the Haiken (which despite not liking fish I actually liked), and the coconut shrimp. Our other friend ordered the shrimp in Créole sauce. We all really enjoyed our meals...but I found it a bit too much on the sugary sweet side: I would go for the curry next time and I wouldn't be afraid to ask for full spicy next time. (I asked for medium spicy n didn't find it very spicy at all). Tiny little restaurant that didn't require reservations on a Friday evening to snag a table for 3. A bring your own wine with surprisingly extremely reasonable meal prices! Decoration left a bit to desire (airline posters from Mauritius seemed a bit tacky imo) but culturally relevant at least lol so it was still nice to look at...would have appreciated more authentic Mauritius decor. I used to work with a guy from Mauritius and he was much darker skinned than the family running this lil gem. Our waiter explained that Mauritius is an island with a blend of Indian, African and Asian cultures and that was definitely well reflected in this restaurant's menu. And my taste buds were very grateful for such a lovely cultural fusion!Would definitely come back and would definitely recommend!"
/user_details?userid=jMHlwDq5b2zqhV5TyyFKPA,Yojna J.,"Victoria, Canada",5 star rating,"If you love authentic island food, you'd love this restaurant. Mauritius, an island based in the Indian Ocean which looks like paradise on earth and so is the food. It's also a family based restaurant. I did like the posters as that's how it looks in Mauritius. First, for any meal you choose, you get fried cabbage and lentil soup with some crackers which are delicious. I also ordered the appetizers which included the plate of chicken croquettes, calamari and coconut based appetizer. They have some authentic sauce that's accompanied with it. I loved it. They were very well made and tons of flavours. For the main, I had ordered the plate of fried chicken noodles and it reminded me of the time I was in Mauritius just from those locals, the portions are huge and so filling. The service was amazing and the lady is so nice and always ask for the specials from Mauritius as they would amaze you! Whatever you order, you're definitely not gonna regret it as they all delicious and freshly made on the spot, served with so much love. You definitely wouldn't regret it and the value is great for the prices you pay. I would keep on going if I miss the island delicious and fresh food. -:)"

/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Buddy and I were out Saturday night looking for Verdun eats, trying to find a place neither of us had gone to but at the same time, not too overpriced. Neither of us wanted to pay for a $20 hamburger.Lo and behold, we stumbled upon Les Delices. It turns out their specialty is the food of that tiny island in the Indian Ocean, Mauritius. Because of the island's history and closeness to both India and Africa, the cuisine of Mauritius has all these different influences. Curry, coconut milk, rice, saffron, lamb from the Indian and Muslim presence on the island. Octopus, ox-tail, beans, fish cakes, Cajun, Creole from the African influence. Throw in a Chinese, Old Dutch and French, and that's Mauritius for you.We spotted a complete dinner menu including appetizer, main and coffee/tea for between $16-$12. What really stopped me dead in my tracks was this included curried lamb shank for $14. Seriously, where on earth can you get lamb, done very well for under $30 in this day and age?This is one thing which upsets me about ethnic dining in general especially when trying out the foods from smaller, poorer countries which are usually off the foodie radar screen. Very often, they are run by recently arrived immigrants who are trying to start out a new life. They usually don't have a lot of money to put into decor and making it look chi-chi. It's usually the bare-bones school of decor. Instead they put their heart and soul into the food. People look in, judge, get turned off and the place is then not open for very long. Judging a book by it's cover here, will make you miss out on the treasures to be found within, that's for sure.We were warmly welcomed and seated. Stickers citing this place from all sorts of guides and guidebooks were plastered all over the front door. Within a minute of being seated, we were given an ""amuse-bouche"", a pre-appetizer of deep friend cabbage fritters. I never had anything that was so simple and yet, very tasty. Dowse it with the choices of hot pepper, garlic or mint sauce sitting on your table and you're set.Next came the fried calamari and fish balls. Both were great, the calamari was made with a batter that clearly had some fresh herbs in it.Then came the lamb shank.OMFG! It was falling off the bone, it was that super tender and flavorful. You have your choices of sauces which you'd like your meat to be prepared in, like Curry, Cajun, Creole, Saffron and others which i can't remember right now. I chose the curry sauce and it was amazing. It came with a heaving serving of rice and salad. By the end, neither of us could barely move, it was that rich and that filling. The owners and servers were extremely friendly and attentive.They even gave us a free desert, a selection of cheesecakes. Bonus, this place is BYOB.I am definitely going to go back to at least try out the octopus and ox-tail stew. This place is a gem in the rough, but a gem nonetheless."
/user_details?userid=m0_W4iHkNZddR0msFtXI4w,Winncie L.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"What a nice discovery. This is a small restaurant in Verdun that serves Mauritius food. We ordered the table d'hote and it came with a fried cabbage amuse-gueule, a soup, a choice among 5 appetizers, the main, dessert and coffee or tea. Very generous portions. The cabbage was crunchy and sweet. The creole sauce had a nice kick. The coconut shrimps were yummmm. You can bring your own wine also. Next time I might try their noodle dish because it looked delicious.Note that service can be slow."
/user_details?userid=vDPnHTynVt2r4sMguuRkJA,Carlos C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Had the coconut shrimp as an app. Was very delicious. Would definitely order that again. Wife and I each had the lamb shank and it was very tender and juicy. Meal came with fried cabbage and soup to start. Both yummy but i especially liked the fried cabbage as I've never had it before. It was a small restaurant so service was good. Didn't make us wait long in between courses.

/user_details?userid=IVPdCGz4DUOQFS7wnaqZeQ,Sonia O.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Verdun. Prices are on the low side (around $12-$15 per dish, which includes soup, appetizer and coffee or tea). Portions are generous and you have many flavors (sauces) to choose from. The restaurant's ambiance is homey and friendly, not fancy at all.Plus, it's BYOW, which is awesome. I give them four stars because last time when I ordered to take out, the food wasn't as good as in the restaurant. Also, last time I went they didn't take credit cards.Overall, this is a great place. Must try if you like both Chinese and Indian flavors."
/user_details?userid=T7jbWjzs2EDVMmUdk7NhFg,Jay W.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I was walking in the neighborhood at lunch and decided ""hey, here's somewhere I've never been"". Well, I wish I'd kept walking. It was lunchtime, and the restaurant was empty, not a good sign. Sat down and ordered Calamar, and my friend ordered Noodles with Chicken. The appetizers and soup were incredible, the fried cabbage was a real treat, and the soup was spicy, homemade and satisfied absolutely.Where could this go wrong? Well, the main dishes came and my Calamari tasted more like old shoes, and had a horrific consistency. I sent it back. My dining mate dove into her noodles and chicken, and it had zero taste.  The owner charged me FULL PRICE for two meals that were inedible, and appeared to become extremely agitated.  Needless to say I'd never eat there, nor would I recommend it to anyone."
/user_details?userid=RyzeW61pQQQKItt37NP05g,Reb K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is my second time at this interesting little restaurant. It is bring your own wine/beer, so my husband and I picked up some beer before we arrived.  I suggest a light, refreshing lager, as my husband's heavy new castle brown ales proved to be a bit too heavy to be mixed with the cuisine.  We got the fried cabbage to start which is definitely indulgent, and I naturally, dosed mine with hot sauce, which I tend to do with anything deep fried.  We ordered the veggie samosas as a starter, and they were fantastic.  Just the right amount of spicy and savory, and the dipping sauce was more Asian influence.  The soup was next, and it was a nice pea soup with a coriander bite to it.  My husband ordered the lamb shank with the honey marinade and I had the chicken noodle plate.  We really enjoyed both meals, mine definitely reminded me of Chinese noodles with a different palate of spices.  This is what is interesting about the cuisine, it definitely has a standard schezuan  appearance but with a different spice palate, which makes it interesting.  Definitely hints of African/Caribbean/French/Indian influences in the food.  But like most Asian influenced restaurant foods, it is a bit on the salty side.  We had the desert which was a hockey-puck shaped custard concoction in syrup.  It wasn't too sweet but it was a tad bland.  In summary, this is a great place to try if you like spicy/savory and cultural fusion cuisine.  Also, it's not too expensive and you can bring your own boos, so it's great for someone adventurous and on a budget."
