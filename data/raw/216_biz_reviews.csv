/user_details?userid=53DKgcqoIUU1ruPaWlna4Q,Lucas M.,"Atlanta, GA",4 star rating,"The reason why I always try to connect with locals is because they know the real deal.What's the link between a Venezuelan spot in Montreal and Quebecers you will ask me? Well I met a Venezuelan IN Montreal that hooked me up, that's how I ended up here..Last time I've had that type of street food was in London several years ago and god I missed it.As fat as it is, the Pabellon is really good, the arepa looked fresh made and the pulled pork tasted just right. I never had the little crispy french fries that came with it before and that was interesting even though I just needed the stuffed arepa really.The staff is friendly, even more if you speak a bit of Spanish whether you are fluent or not try it you will surely get a smile back!Honestly this is the type of place I would go back to and try most of what's on the menu, be confident you will see me there very soon :)"
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",3 star rating,"First time having an arepa! (or at least an authentic one). Ordered the Pabellon arepa for two with fries. It was a good sandwich, with cheese, beans, beef, and plantain. The flavours were good and the meat was warm and juicy. It was maybe too rich as I got a bit of a stomachache after eating it. The fries were regular reheated fries. I wouldn't get those as a side again.It's a very substantial meal so I would recommend this place for people who have voracious appetites only. Prices were cheap and the staff is very welcoming and nice."
/user_details?userid=o_IEnOVNuir0QNVkANzyXQ,Esteban Y.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It was 10pm on a Monday night, and I had these urges to eat a Venezuelan arepa. To my surprise, there was this place open till 11 pm, just like the Areperas in Venezuela, open until late. I had una pelua (carne mechada y queso amarillo / shredded beef and yellow cheese), it was very good. I also had tequeños (it's like a little bread filled with cheese), very good as well."
/user_details?userid=W90xlJgPOqkwWPN1KORPOw,Andrew C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Food is really yummy! Tried their breakfast crepe-ish thing made with corn and cheese. SO good and delicious! I gave 4 stars only because the men washroom looks a bit abandoned... like they forgot to cleaned it for 2 weeks or something.
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I found a delicious mess in a basket at Cacique Grill, housed in the former Bocadillo location (not sure what the story behind this is, but right now it's just about the food).Long story short the pulled pork burger could be considered heaven sent. Marinated in passion fruit juice, inter-dispersed with garlic mayo and sliced tomato, the lusciousness burst forth from the pillow soft bun. I needed a fork to gather the droppings, and I just about ate the sauced wax paper for dessert, it was that good. All that was left was a crumpled bunch of napkins and fork.I declare it the best tasting and messiest $10 pulled pork sandwich this side of St. Laurent (since their address is 1 Mont Royal West).Tip: Get the key and visit the modern executive styled bathroom, down a corridor tucked behind the kitchen. Probably the best bathroom this side of...you get the picture.Lot's of other items to try, so need more visits. Nuf' said."
/user_details?userid=VAJT8Y8LnQ7FGxyX222vfg,Denis L.,"Mercier, Canada",4 star rating,Tried an arepas lamalandra with chorizo ham cheese garlic sauce and tomatoes looks great but I wonder what cacique stands for must look it up on google
/user_details?userid=tcObjjD38MmFAHc7935gDQ,Brent S.,"Lincoln, Lincoln, Canada",5 star rating,"Amazing Venezuelan cuisine! My spouse is from Venezuela and she really wanted to check this place out while we vacationed in Montreal (she really misses her type of food from back home). We were extremely happy with the food and service! For a great taste of Venezuela, this place is a must for a visit!"
/user_details?userid=9FnuzSVpLpj2FfZVGtb4OQ,Camilo L.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Great street food from Venezuela.  We had different kinds of Arepas and they were all delicious. This is my fourth visit to this place and it is definitely a 5 stars place. Updated menu with new options. Great service.
/user_details?userid=3vA6HAHLtdzbbRIKVoe47A,Andreina P.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love this place. From a Venezuelan that misses their food and taste. I've tried their arepas, tequeños and cachapas. The best so far are the tequeños with the garlic sauce. The service is a little slow yes but while you're waiting for the main dish you can chat and share. Just a tip, the tequeños are served faster."
/user_details?userid=yLrfSdFRpOC9tHysJckRiw,Bergþóra J.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I've had some good arepas here in the past but after today I don't think I'll be visiting again, sadly. Came in to a pretty empty place but still had to wait for over 30 min for one arepa. Chicken turned out to be cold. Saw a mouse running across the floor while waiting a couple of times."
/user_details?userid=c7C5QziJbx6JOnQFiOxUXQ,Youri H.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"The food here is decent but man are they ever slow. I've been waiting 30 minutes now for a burger, despite them already serving the people who came 5 minutes after me - they're almost done eating btw. This isn't a one time thing either - seems to happen every time. I should have gone to Pitarifique.  And I just noticed that they charged me for a trio when I didn't ask for one. Ffs."
/user_details?userid=aFwHV1OH6NvgKMuE428phQ,Rajeev L.,"Weston, CT",3 star rating,"Stumbled on this place on our family trip to Montreal. The food here is quite good. The only reason why I'm giving 3 stars is that there were 3 things on the menus that they said they didn't have. There was a mixed appetizer plate that they said they no longer offered. Then there was the steak that we ordered and subsequently found out that they ran out of. Lastly it was the cheese they typically use for their corn pancake, which they ran out of. The food we did get was great however. We may have caught them on a bad day, so you might want to give them a try."
/user_details?userid=VgoFAXExCm2l-57WZFPeJw,Nick Y.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"I've had better arepas.  The cornbread was nice, but steak tasted old and found the sandwich to be overly salty.  I don't think I'll be back."
/user_details?userid=dNIxs3_qcAuF8S9kS9iFCQ,Rafaella A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Has almost the same menu as Bocadillo, I recommend the passion fruit pulled pork for sure! Also they have really good hot dogs."
/user_details?userid=yUk9mGnz729OOwzKuv-tzQ,Jason R.,"Williston, VT",4 star rating,"I can now add Venezuelan food to my ever growing list of positive culinary experiences! I had never tried Venezuelan cuisine before, so I had no idea what to expect. The staff was very helpful and informative about the menu offerings which definitely made the ordering process easier.  Upon their recommendation, I tried one of their arepas, which are basically grilled pouches made with corn meal and filled with sausage, cheese, ham and vegetables. On a cold and rainy day in Montreal, this hot meal definitely hit the spot! As a lot of other reviews have suggested, the service is a bit slow, but as long as you are not in a hurry to be anywhere, this is a great spot that I will absolutely try again."
/user_details?userid=uQ4QtUKmQl9rAo3CLJRb-w,Alexandre D.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Awful service, cold food, ordinary taste, and disregard for hygiene. The cook handles money in the cash goes back to kitchen and handles food, without changing gloves or washing hands. Bathrooms are one of the dirtiest I have seen in my life!I don't recommend this place to anyone. Sad how entrepreneurs don't take their business seriously."
/user_details?userid=i8vru4gPL7n0-zd_yjN_jA,Leege K.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"Yummmyyyyy!!! I'm on an arepas kick! The grilled arepas here are deelish, good habanero hotsauce and amazing staff! Had a beef one and the shredded beef was marinated in some sort of delicous magic sauce. Only thing, they loved blasting cheesy pop music the whole time. But it's worth enduring for the deliciousness."
/user_details?userid=uEsnJi0NQHv1ExTw6GT5dQ,Adriana U.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",5 star rating,"You have to try these stuffed arepas! Great flavor, fresh ingredients and generous portions. I had the ""pelua"", a shredded beef with tomatoes and onions, served with white cheese."
/user_details?userid=O_FOHUTrqvnN9d8dP9P8aw,Manuzza L.,"Rome, Italy",3 star rating,Was ok notting special I had arepa long time ago I can say the arepa was toasted good I find is overpriced for what u get
/user_details?userid=ISv-8tCc1WuQ6iJu6hqX0g,Carlos A M.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,they took 1 hour for 2 sandwiches. they were saggy and cold. the place is understaff. is also kinda overpriced for what it is. on the good side stuff is friendly and they try. place has potential but need some management improvement.
/user_details?userid=7hElQBiE_x2HZk6yJMVgNg,Lu Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"absolutely delicious i tried the pulled pork sandwich once so far the best i ever had better than the greasy southern us ones by far they have this hint of passion fruit in the sauce. yesterday i went back and had a steak it was juicy, the grill gives it extra flavour, their chimichurri is to die for and they give me an extra hot sauce which was absolutely great it had an orange color and fruity taste but it was spicy. the yucca fries were just AMAZING so crunchy and thick yet moist inside."
/user_details?userid=lIHkrGS15hreAgxE5bZ46A,Jared T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,The food was amazing. I had a pulled pork arepa. It was huge and delicious and the price was reasonable. Topped it off with a Venezuelan Colita. Will definitely be going back here.
/user_details?userid=MsmJiYYaEcm3Rsu9pCUmHA,Marc-Antoine L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I went there with my girlfriend, not knowing what to expect, and ordered the passion fruit pulled pork sandwich. Now I know pork and sweet flavors mix well but I though that pork and passion fruit was a bit weird. I even joked with my girlfriend that I was so hungry that even if it was bad I would finish the whole thing. Boy do I want to be wrong like that all the time. The flavors were perfect. And let's not forget the textures. The fried plantain and avocado did a wonder to add that extra bit of creaminess and it contrasted perfectly with the crunchy arepa bun. It was just wonderful. Also, we didn't realize it but you can order your arepa as a combo with fries and a drink. Next time I'm on the plateau, I will be coming back for more!"
/user_details?userid=DPpG5B_hhq84WJDhwWM9rg,Simon T.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"This place is wayyyy too slow. Thought it was a fast food place, wasn't even packed and my food took 30mins. Never coming back."
/user_details?userid=3INqltXxCjPVE2KlCOyblA,Burak S.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,Very personal and friendly. He accommodated our diet restrictions and taste buds. All at once pleasantly.
/user_details?userid=jpcES5wf3DCDzAHvCsX5xg,Steven D.,"Fairfax, VT",5 star rating,"1. Wait until you are very hungry.2. Go to Cacique Grill and order their Passion Fruit Pulled Pork Sandwich for under $10.3. Enjoy the wonderfully messy, incredibly satisfying, juicy pulled pork, infused with a slightly tangy (not spicy) marinade, garlic mayo, and tomatoes on a kaiser-roll style bun (without poppy seeds). Also their aioli for dipping the fries into was stupendous!4. If satisfied with these instructions, pass them on to a friend."
/user_details?userid=7VGWoDqKb4Sg1g9688GexA,Angelo S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Guava and cheese sticks ""Tequeños"" are delicious! Any arepa you'll try will make you ask for more! Try ""La Catira"" for chicken lovers or ""La Pelúa"" or ""Llanera"" for beef lovers!! You won't be deceived!!"
/user_details?userid=X5tMMp96lxq0Y18H33SuCg,Stephka A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Great after-drinking spot. They open until 4am on weekends so there is no excuse for losing your dignity and going to McDonalds anymore. I love the tequeños!
/user_details?userid=i3XyNBi_UN5TKHOSN4TKtA,Elizabeth M.,"Country Club, Bronx, NY",2 star rating,"Ok. So maybe I had the highest hopes since this was rated as a perfect 5 stars. Maybe my expectations were too high but I really wish I could say I enjoyed it. Truth is I did not. My family ordered the same thing: rice, beans and grilled chicken. The rice was cold. The bean portion was tiny and the boneless thighs were bland. I had a version of a pulled bbq sandwich which was meh at best. The 2 stars are for the yuca fries which actually were ok. Overall disappointing experience."
/user_details?userid=k_VZcPTVbZyWCzSfPsCw5w,Erin P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Their food is delicious and very very reasonably priced. They'd get 5 stars if their service wasn't incredibly slow. Expect to wait 30-40 mins for a sandwich while the staff hits on all the girls. Can't say they aren't friendly though!
/user_details?userid=Il3FejoMTG4BODfg9gJA3Q,Sarah B.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The food is great. It may be a little slow sometimes, but it's worth the wait - plus you can always take yours out and head to nearby Jeanne Mance park (I find it's quicker when you make an order to go). Their La Catira (pulled chicken and cheese arepa) is delicious."
