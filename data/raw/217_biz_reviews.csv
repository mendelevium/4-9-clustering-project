/user_details?userid=b39IckHDyVLVSGYhy6Sszg,Jim P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I came here for a retirement event for one of my work colleagues.We were given a choice of a few appetizers, a few entrees, and 2 desserts. I opted for Oysters Rockefeller as my appetizer, grilled swordfish in wasabi butter, sushi rice, and sweet peas as my entree, and black forest cake for dessert. Considering that we were probably around 50 people in our party, I thought that service was fine although I did have to remind the server that I never got my dessert. For our event, we actually ""pre-ordered"" what we wanted so they would have an idea of how much and what to prepare. I was one of three people who showed up to the event ~1 hour into the event so assuming that it took people ~20 minutes to settle in and identify what they selected, I didn't feel that we were too late but this could explain why I didn't really experience any issues with my service/food.I didn't have any major complaints about the food and it was very good. The minor complaint that I did have about my food was with my Oysters Rockefeller. There was a slight ""sand"" texture which felt like I had bits of sand in my mouth. Not sure of this was actually sand (which I have had in raw oysters which weren't properly cleaned) or something crunchy which was part of the Oysters Rockefeller. A colleague of mine who ordered the black forest cake for dessert had a plastic wrap around it when it arrived at his table  which caught him by surprise (mine was removed before it arrived at my table).The price was also very good. They accept debit cards, cash, and credit cards. For our large party, they mentioned that they preferred if we brought cash otherwise there would be a long line up to pay (in the event that we all wanted to leave at the same time) but they had no issues accommodating people who paid with their credit cards.I would have no issues returning here. Not really a solid 5 but I would give them 4.5 which I did bump up to a 5 since I felt that 4 stars doesn't feel right. The menu changes regularly so you might not be able to order the same thing when you return."

Maybe it was the lack of wine this time but I was not as impressed as the first time in terms of the food. Service was still impeccable and the presentation was great. To start, I had the crécy soup and my mom had the goat cheese pannacotta bites. The soup was good and the goat cheese pannacotta bites were also good but slightly rich to finish the whole plate by oneself. For the main, my mom has the old style beef bourguignon which was simple, traditional and overall good and I had the cod with black garlic beurre blanc. The beurre blanc was really great though I found the fish to be slightly fishy and it had so many bones in it so I had to constantly look out for that. I had the lemon tart as my dessert which was probably my favourite part and my mom had the pithiviers. We had to take some food to go as we were too full. Overall: good food, great service, and the price cannot be beat! We were able to get a table without a reservation so we were lucky. Food: 3.5/5Service: 4.5/5Price: 5/5"

Get this? A three course meal for only $20- definitely got my attention. This restaurant is in the basement of LaSalle college where their culinary and hospitality students put their skills to the test. A common spot for staff and students, they recently renovated the venue (I attended before the renovations were done). The menu has many options for three courses as well a drink menu with affordable wine selections. I was very impressed by the quality of food, speed and excellence of service, enthusiasm of the servers."

The food and service are incredible. Food was bright and fresh and the staff was kind and attentive. It's students and a hidden gem.

The foods are amazing, the price is super super super reasonable (only under $20 include taxes for THREE courses)Prepare & server by students at Lasalle College. Yas, all these amazing dishes are made by students who are studying Professional Cooking. The chef is super nice, always come out and ask us is everything Ok, super funny. The waiters/waitresses are very professional. Always refill waters, handling foods with good manners. I'm so satisfied, so happy. Such a way to spend a night after long study time"

/user_details?userid=VeEM--3NvAQ_b_R8g05CkQ,Adele D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We tried out Le Fuchsia twice recently, and really enjoyed our experience both times. The menu changes each week (according to whatever dishes are being covered by the cooking school that particular week), and in both weeks that we visited, the menus were creative, flavourful, and offered plenty of choices for varying taste preferences. In terms of price-quality ratio, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better option ($15-17 plus tax for three course table d'hotes).Our favourite dishes were definitely the green thai curry monkfish risotto (an amazing south east asian take on an otherwise Italian classic); the Peruvian style ceviche entree  (bursting with flavour); a sugar-shack inspired take on fried chicken and waffles (but served with an addictive jalapeño jelly); and a quail leg entree that seemed to combine Chinese spice flavors with French cooking techniques. Portions are perfect (you won't leave hungry nor feel uncomfortably full, unless you attack the bread basket, which we often do....), and the flavour profiles of the dishes tend to be sophisticated/classic yet out-of-the-box. However, note that it closes quite early (orders have to be placed by 7:30 at latest usually), so it isn't suitable for late night dining. Also, while the food offers exceptional value, the wine can sometimes seem a bit over overpriced (at least relative to the great value re: food), depending on the generosity of your waiter's pour - which can be variable. That being said, the manager/director of the restaurant can mix up some pretty great customized and unique cocktails on demand (for about $10), which is always fun.We've been happy with the service both times (everyone is friendly and helpful, and the manager/director really takes the time to explain each dish on the menu in detail, and makes the effort to provide recommendations re: wine pairings).Bottom line, it's a great place to go if you're open to trying out new things, and aren't too fussy/particular about small details (while the presentation of the dishes is truly excellent for that price point, garnishes are sometimes a bit wilted - but who really cares as long as the dish tastes amazing, right?)  Moreover, while the atmosphere is arguably much better than other restaurants in that price point (they make efforts with nice lighting etc), don't expect an intimate/high-end setting. The silver lining to that, is that the place easily accommodates large groups."
/user_details?userid=LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The menu changes every week so it's hard to suggest a dish. Your alcoholic beverages will be overpriced for the most part but the food is very well priced.The food was delicious but a little cold. Your meal price ($10-$15) includes your appetizer, entree and dessert. I was served a Duck Ravioli, nice Beef main, and an absolutely delicious creme brûlée with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream. I would suggest it for lunch if you work in the area, wonderful that the menu changes giving you the change to try many different meals. (choice of 3/wk)The food and service are by part time staff and the students at LaSalle College work some shifts as part of their coursework. We were ""served"" by the part time staff and it was horrible. Water glasses always empty, forgot one of our desserts, didn't offer pepper for our pastas and were nearly impossibly to flag them down at the end of the meal to ask for tea.All in all enjoyable, nice decor/ambiance, great food, just need to work on their service.Food:  10/10Service:  5/10Price:  10/10Atmosphere: 7/10"
