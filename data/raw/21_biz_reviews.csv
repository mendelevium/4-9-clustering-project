/user_details?userid=vxNjUAnrEPqPjBmIe7F4GQ,Michelle W.,"Pierrefonds, Canada",5 star rating,"I found this place here on Yelp - So thank you fellow Yelpers!!!It's tiny, It's cozy and very welcoming. I felt like I was at someone's home. We were 7 and squished our way in. The live music was just wonderful the food was delicious and was just like home cooking. I would suggest that they consider making a house salad dressing as the Kraft dressing was well Kraft dressing.  Every single person at our table loved their dinner. The desert crepes were dreamy. We had so much fun, we will be going back. We all hugged the cook on our way out!"

/user_details?userid=0TJ01iwzVLXtr_EYcfqoWQ,Offer R.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Canada",4 star rating,"Homely atmosphere at this lovely place. Most of the previous reviews nailed it: not expensive (mains for 12.5$ - the classification should change to $$), tasty home cooking, mostly for carnivores, but one out of the eight dishes was vegetarian. Bring your own wine. Expect the violin to be played while you sit there. We had the soup, schnitzel, goulash, and ratatouille. They were all good. The starter bread was a little stale, but we didn't let ruin our meal. We may go back! Check please: one soup, three mains 40.25$"
/user_details?userid=BytRWk8X1OelSgwwfXd8Aw,Arun D.,"London, United Kingdom",5 star rating,Just an incredible dining experience. The couple that runs the restaurant is just incredible. We went on a Saturday night so there was live music which was just incredibly energetic. When we got in the hosts were kind enough to take our coats so we could sit comfortably. We were served promptly and the owner/chef was quick to accommodate and make me something vegetarian. The food was great but the dessert crepes were the real treat! I would strongly recommend going on a Friday or Saturday as they have live music and a special menu for the evening. It really is a unique spot that has an authentic feel. The owners really make the place - try to take the time to talk to them; that's what made our evening!
/user_details?userid=W-l8Y9FnJt8zv1C7d3H5rQ,Mahmood Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Very simple place, run by two great guys - a father and a son. The food is good, not very refined but comfort food. The experience is just amazing. We were wandering around Duluth, searching for an authentic experience, and we entered this little place that looked like nothing, and didn't even exist on Yelp, and then we found it. The guys told us stories about their homeland, explained to us how the food is made (try it at home), and at the end the father played Hungarian dances for us on his violin. My wife almost broke in tears when he played her favourite song - it was that much of an experience.----- update -----I met the son in Patati Patata last week and he recognized me. They seem to be genuinely interested in their clients. That personal attention you get from them is not fake."
/user_details?userid=d8PGoBxGZ5clDBxiH_wTPA,Geoff K.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I took my hungarian family there and they loved it!The food is your typical Hungarian comfort food and spiced just right.The owners are very friendly and will come around to every table and talk to the guests and when we went on a Saturday night hey put on an hour or so concert after dinner  had finished. Starting with traditional hungarian music then asking for requests later.If your looking for good food, in a nice family run establishment with great live entertainment then this is the spot for you.*Just remember its cash only."
/user_details?userid=zb2H10dKNiUg9crNyvE86A,Steven K.,"Hampstead, Canada",5 star rating,"I   Was there this past Saturday with 6 other people, we sat very comfortably, the restaurant holds approx 30 people so I recommend reservations, especially for Friday or Saturday night.   They offer a truly complete dinner menu from Start to Finish for under $30 which includes great Hungarian/ gypsy style entertainment.  You will not leave hungry.  You  can bring your own wine or beer, which is another plus.  The atmosphere is very homey and friendly family style.  The owners are the chefs, servers and musicians, so they are very eager to please their guests.   The menu is Hungarian and Eastern European.I highly recommend this restaurant.  And the  menu is even less expensive every other evening of the week."
/user_details?userid=lPbszXrXKPnRchbzwVbOIg,Steven V.,"Melbourne, Australia",4 star rating,"I was gonna make this place my first 5 star, but I don't give 5 stars, so decided to keep in tradition.This place was such a fantastic find. We are a huge fan of BYOW places, because it allows you to focus more on the food/experience rather than counting ridiculous wine bottle prices. So I had this place bookmarked for a while.We decided to try it out, and it was unique and really great. As soon as we walked in, about 8pm, with two wine bottles, we found the owner playing violin for and joking with a table in the middle of the place. We walked in and he stopped and said, ""Ahhh! You must be hungry too! Sit!"" It was funny and welcoming and warm. We then sat and opened the wine and he came and explained the menu, which features about 5 main courses, and other things like soups/salads etc. All the stuff is home made food. NOTE: This is a small place by a guy and his wife, and they make the menu every night. Usually, that's not exactly my thing, either because of a stand off-ish vibe, or something. But this place really had a lovely aura. We though we were in an Eastern European town for a couple of hours.Menu features mostly meat items, but there are vegetarian options, as my wife is vegetarian. We had two vegetable soups, I had stuffed cabbage (lamb and shredded cabbage with garnishes and sauce) and my wife had a mushroom dish (portobello mushrooms cooked in sauce and served with potatos). We shared a salad, and then we had a crepe desert to share also.It was an amazingly excellent meal. I swear to God one of the best food meals I have ever had anywhere. My plate was HUGE, and I eventually ate it all, slowly. Even though the vibe was different, the place was so chill, so friendly, and the food was amazing. We sat and talked and drank wine over the course of two hours and had a great time. And at the end, for two people, the bill was $35! It was really great.We then walked out, feeling super energized and good. And walked down duluth street to the park. It was a really great evening, and we were surprised.We're totally sold now, and will 100% revisit several times. It's a great unique experience. Go there. Do not expect a situation though where you can be rude to the owners and treat them like they work for you. Diners with that approach might be met unkindly, which one of the reviews below suggests to me could be the case.Three other tables came in while we were there, and everyone of us was loving it. Great place."

/user_details?userid=zWheJVDqF4E92ZE2kiUV9w,Joaquín S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Very good ambiance. Super nice and personalized attention. Not to mention that the food was as good as expected. I had the goulash and it had a wonderful homemade taste, and came to me super fast.Looking forward to come back and have a schnitzel."
/user_details?userid=_ECy5yaOY3i8XN5t5pSXOw,Carly S.,"Sandwich, MA",5 star rating,"If you go to Montreal and you don't have dinner here you've screwed up. This place is excellent. The husband and wife do it all and you feel like you've joined them in their home for dinner. The husband even played some Hungarian music on the violin which was beautiful. The food was delicious. I love trying dishes from other cultures, my boyfriend is not as adventurous. We ate everything and both agreed this was one of the best dining experiences we've had."
/user_details?userid=6elNm2xn9f3KS08bcK-cBw,Carrie-Ann K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is just adorable. First of all, there is nothing I love more than a family-run restaurant where you get a hug at the end of the night. Was the food outstanding? Uhhhh.... no. Simple salad with Kraft Italian Dressing and a soup that half our table loved and the other half wouldn't eat. We tried four of the mains and were happy with the typical Hungarian fare, but the beef in the goulash wasn't tender and everything was a little underseasoned. Was the waiter over -the-top friendly? Not really. But the fiddle-playing was otherworldly, and the intimacy of the place and the sweet friendliness of the chef really made up for it. It's just such an awesome local experience, and I would recommend it to anyone entertaining out of town guests or looking for a fun double date night. It was literally the cutest."
/user_details?userid=Blv810DYbtGVzmTEtqaEQA,D P.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"I am so glad I finally made it here.  Yes, it is ""standard"" Hungarian fare...but oh my...home cooking at these reasonable prices? And by home cooking I mean authentic, delicious, and comforting.  Spent an extraordinary Saturday evening there this past summer.  Full house.  The food came out and we were all satisfied only to have the evening become extraordinary with the live music.  People stopped in the street to look in......I could have been anywhere in Europe.....Bring your own wine and enjoy the experience.  And at the end -- no sticker shock.  I felt bad paying so little because I got so much."
/user_details?userid=U1v1CLjhYXBzvnKKjppIFw,Neda S.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,Very mediocre and ordinary food which worth about 10$ but you need to oay 30$ if you go on fri or sat night since there is live music! I won't go back!
/user_details?userid=fTpu6QN2bKs4d_ag6U1tdw,Sam G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I went to Budapest Roma for a date in the summer. Honestly this is one of the best restaurants I have ever had the pleasure of dining in. The couple who runs this place was so accomodating and friendly. They made sure we had lit candles on the table and everything we needed while maintaining a distance that was comfrtable for a date.This restaurant truly has a homey feel. You can see right into the kitchen!If you go on a weekend they have live music which was truly incredible. My date and I spent hours at the restaurant just to take in the ambiance. We ended up tipping over 50% because the price was reasonable that we felt we were cheating the couple out of money!One of the best and most personal dining experiences you can have. Please go!
/user_details?userid=V0Ofah4N7Pw6foKGiY55BA,Sam C.,"Saint-Leonard, Canada",4 star rating,Friday night what a way to finish the night. Music that relaxes and at times just want to make you get up and dance. In between this music food that makes your heart sing for more!! This place is definitely a place to revisit!!!
/user_details?userid=fKSX9phgi0Hxuald0wERxA,T S.,"Mount Royal, Canada",5 star rating,"Every time go to this place i end up crying . there's sort of vibration of that small space that leaves me breathless .  I feel that in the moment i am entering that door it's like i am entering a timegate  or deporting myself to another era or land (it's sort of Midnight in Paris-the movie) . They played so much violin and piano in this tiny space that i can hear the music even when  they are not playing , it got impregnated in the walls , paintings , tables and even in the food i am eating. The food is great , if u go on a friday or saturday evening , they will serve you a 3 course meal : salad + soup , second plate , dessert . And during your meal they will keep playing music , violin , piano , cimbalom. The space is little and the owner ( professional violinist) wants to get everyone involved to the story, they talk to you ask you if you want them to play anything specific ( i talked about everything from movies to geography with them and then they played some Nino Rota for me, awesome feeling ) . At the end of the night i paid 20$ (tax included)  for everything. Sometimes i wonder how this place succeeds to survive , maybe it's the love of art that makes them go on .Give a big tip please ahaha, we need places like this to continue to exist   Recommended plates : schnitzel, goulash, cabbage rolls *** Don't forget to bring your own wine***"
/user_details?userid=g3l3WoRU-vHtZM2sKEVklg,Zoe L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,This is the best restaurants I've ever been too. There are few  places I can say make me feel at home but this one did. With the wife and husband owning and cooking all the food while also making time to play the violin and talk to you how can you not feel at home. They also will throw in free mini desserts and salads just because they like you so much. The owners are real Hungarians so the food is authentic. The food is delicious. The schnitzel and goulash are cooked to perfection but not over complicated. It's the first place I've been to where they make veal goulash and to my surprise I preferred the veal goulash in the end. Having perfect food is one thing but the fact the couple  is so friendly and start to play the violin  and sing and the freebies make it even better. Also they say bring wine and pay corkage fee but in the end they actually don't charge you.
/user_details?userid=mavs0rOqBTekriMgHeXxwQ,Simon G.,"Brooklyn, NY",1 star rating,"The restaurant had only Pepsi, house wine and corona to drink. My dad asked for Soda Water. They offered Pepsi... yikes. The water was served in tiny glasses. The salad was drenched in cheap tasting Kraft italian dressing. We sent it back. Then it was drenched in some strange overly zesty (probably Kraft) avocado dressing. We sent that back and finally they just threw a bag of leaves on a plate. No tomato, no cucumber. Very bitter. My Dad wanted to send it back again, but my Mom was too embarrassed to.The ratatouille that my mom ordered was just green peppers. Normally there are more vegetables in such a dish. The saving grace was the owner played violin with piano and that was nice. But I wouldn't recommend this restaurant, even though our waiter was very friendly (although he didn't know the menu well.)"
/user_details?userid=Zn83HAVvvI7hEewnsW8mhg,Lala N.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"We walked in with two bottles of wine and the owner's wife greeted us very warmly and told us how smart we were. The food on the menu is very reasonably priced with enough variety. We ordered veal goulash, schnitzel, and cordon bleu, and she recommended the vegetable soup so we got that as well. The owner came over to talk to us and he was very personable and interesting. The food was very delicious and the atmosphere was like being invited to a friend's house. The violin playing by the owner was very good in Roma gypsy style. We will definitely come back when we come back to Montreal."
/user_details?userid=SP49h7KFV4aZbSSJBCatLQ,Lianne S.,"Atlanta, GA",5 star rating,Cute and cozy small family restaurant with simple and tasty.food. Had the cabbage rolls and ghoulash and both were great. The owner played the violin and it was amazing.
/user_details?userid=KqtzSQPIQ6CWAMAwYYeL7g,Kenneth F.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"Small (7 tables) very casual Hungarian restaurant on Duluth close to St. Laurent.The food is standard Hungarian/Central European. I had stuffed cabbage, very tasty and well prepared. Menu is probably not stylish for Montreal and a bit heavy for a hot summer day, but the food is tasty and the prices extremely reasonable.I stopped by for dinner on a recent Sunday. The owner and his wife were extremely hospitable. The owner is also a professional musician. At the time the patronage was light, three customers. One of the customers said he played the violin, so the owner let him play his, and he hauled out an electronic piano and the two gave an informal concert on the spot. Doesn't get much better than that!  I understand that they have more formal music on Friday evenings.This place is a real gem!"
