This is one of his many many MANY establishments here in Montreal (I've also been to Kampai). I really like this place and have been here for both in person dining (brunch) and take out (due to Covid). Because of COVID, he's doing take out and delivery (depending on where you live for delivery). In person dining: excellent service. They are super friendly! If you're reserving, they call you in advance to confirm and they are generally super hospitable. Take out: we did take out during New Year's Eve for their special event so it was a bit busy but they still got our order to us efficiently (and everything was fresh and tasty!) The restaurant itself is beautiful and very airy. It would be nice to go back in the restaurant in person soon. The fish and seafood are always fresh and feel great to eat. I've seen some of the videos he's on and it's impressive how he tries to use every part of the fish. It's great in terms of sustainability. Their holiday/ New Year's Eve meal was also an amazing deal as it was essentially the Plateau pour 2 with additional appetizers, a delightful pasta dish and dessert. With every order for 2, he also gave a complimentary bottle of wine. I will definitely be thinking about this dinner for a very long time!"

A highly recommended spot, I knew I needed to try Park's and they did not disappoint!I ordered via website which confirmed timing and options with tons of images to reference. The delivery was seamless as they followed instructions.Onto the sushi -- presentation still beautiful spite it travelling to me. The fish tasted so fresh I was amazed at the quality! Park's manages to deliver and is reliable.When COVID is all over, I can't wait to see what the dine in experience would be like!"
/user_details?userid=vTsbejwscDEdA3Ao_aIQMg,Lawrie S.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Ordered for pick up from their website as dining in is not an option during COVID. They also do delivery, either way make sure to select from the right menu, lunch or supper and order at the right time to make sure they'll be available! The menu is more limited than usual but still plenty to chose from.We have the seaweed salad to start. It's unlike one I had before as it was mixed with lettuce and came with a sesame type of sauce, different but very good and fresh. Portion was large and enough of both lettuce and salad to fit in each bite.We then ordered the selection of nigiri, maki and sashimi (22 pieces) and the maki snow crab (8 pieces). They were all delicious and you can tell it is made with great quality fish but I would have to say that the makis were my favourite! They each had a little kick to them and had so much flavour. The snow crab had some lemon zest in them which really made such a different and brought them to a whole other level! Ratio of fish to rice was perfect, I mean you are paying for it so I would hope so...We also had the toro sashimi, from what we understood this is supposed to be a very ""elite"" cut of the fish which is more fatty. You can tell just by looking at the marbling on the fish it's going to be good. Soak it a little extra long in the soya sauce really helps bring out its flavours. Glad we tried it but it wasn't cheap! I mean nothing on this menu was cheap but you can tell you're paying for the quality and presentation so enjoy it!"

(The restaurant does its own deliveries).The meal itself was a different story...The Nigiri looked and tasted like they have been sitting prepared for a while, and were garnished just moments before being packed away and sent out. The Sashimi pieces were thin, and half of them felt like they were recently defrosted and still soaked with water.The best part of the whole meal ended up being the Park Maki... which I used to cover up the flavour and the experience of the Sashimi and the Nigiri. I'm sorry, but the price that is being charged for the fish and the provided quality is simply unacceptable. Was hoping to make this restaurant one of my frequent sushi locations, but after this experience, that is something that is definitely not happening. An extremely disappointing sushi experience what I wouldn't wish for anyone."
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"So this review is based on take out. Chef Park is offering takeout and delivery during the ""suggested"" confinement due to covid-19. I've eaten here once a few years back for my birthday and remember loving this place a lot! So...I decided to drive an hour to pickup my lunch and drive an hour back to eat it. Ok. I did eat most the nigiri before driving back but that's just because it looked so good and because after the first one, I just had to have three more. Can I just say that I wish they could deliver all the way to Otterburn Park!!! I don't know what types of fish he used, well besides de salmon and tuna, but the other ones were so goddam delicious! Everything was on point. Delicate, elegant, delicious, tasty, perfect textures and oh so boujee! Can't wait to drive 2 hours back and fourth again but for dinner this time. I already know what I'm having :)"

/user_details?userid=z0B8bt3YBB8qiOxwNbeoZg,Christine D.,"Vaughan, Canada",3 star rating,"As a long time follower of Chef Antonio Park's IG where he posts beautiful sushi arrangements, I had high expectations for this restaurant but was slightly disappointed after finally eating here.If you've got a big appetite for sushi, go during lunch hours as prices are less for practically the same dishes, and skip the omakase since there isn't much sushi included. For 2 people eating lunch, the bill came up to $220 after tax and tips. We ordered miso soups, park lunch, nigiri park lunch, sashimi moriawase, and chef's special maki roll. Of all the dishes ordered, the best was the chef's special maki roll which had top notch quality ingredients (kamatoro & scallop) and tons of flavour. The sashimi moriawase and nigiri were fresh but just didn't make a strong impression as I would have liked. Service was pretty slow even though our hostess was standing directly in front of us. And although I requested bar seats, we were placed at the coffee bar(?) rather than the sushi bar even though there were plenty of seats available in front of the chefs. Overall, a 5-year long curiosity has been satisfied, but I don't think another visit is warranted."
/user_details?userid=_g6P8H3-qfbz1FxbffS68g,Shari A.,"Livingston, NJ",4 star rating,"This Westmount Asian Fusion is the perfect hybrid of a neighborhood place and a foodie's delight. I made a reservation weeks in advance for 2 at the bar. When I arrived I was disappointed because we were seated at the high countertop which housed the liquor and espresso machine rather than the sushi bar. Apparently it is better to call and specify to make sure. This is especially important because we sat on the corner of the counter and the servers were consistently bumping into us as they served and scurried around. Not exactly ideal. But that was the only miss... the service is attentive and each course is described with such enthusiasm and detail that it's impossible not to acknowledge the passion with which the servers do their job. Really wonderful. The ambience is cool... they seem to love 80s American music which was piped in through the audio system. The beauty of doing the prix fixe tasting is that each person can order a different number of courses. So I ordered the 5 course and my husband had the 7 course option. They coordinate them in perfect sync and I got to taste my husbands other dishes. Gabriel was a terrific server. The kitchen dishes were fantastic and the sashimi, nigiri and rolls were art on a plate. Of course they tasted just as good as they looked. We are sushi snobs and have been to many top notch sushi places around the world. This one certainly measures up. Even the dessert was super creative and a lovely way to close the meal. Next time I would make sure we sit at a booth by the window or the sushi bar. If not for our terrible seats at the bar, this place would have garnered a fifth star."
/user_details?userid=gxYdU7-z-g804OfjMlStBw,Mark S.,"Miami, FL",1 star rating,"For the record I've never been back to Park since. Or paid for the takeout myself. I've eaten it at friends' places, and, minus the show and chatter at the sushi bar, there's nothing special about this sushi.Yes, the visual presentation from Antonio is world-class. Some of the prettiest sushi you'll see, and instantly recognizable. But some of the flavor combinations are head-scratching, and the taste ultimately blasé. I'm in LA and NY too often for this to be worth my time or money. Too many other good non-sushi food options in Montreal. That's how you lose a regular. By forgetting to always deliver a quality experience. The experience made the rest, for a short while, acceptable.Just waiting for Shinji to leave and open up his own place again. A damn shame he's stuck there."
/user_details?userid=JVHK7JItWX5nzy08HUtbhw,Luke L.,"Upper West Side, Manhattan, NY",2 star rating,"The standing power of this restaurant in Montreal - a gastro town with demanding tummies - is bewildering. How could this possibly be regarded as the pinnacle of Japanese fusion cuisine? At best it is a whitewashed allegory of asian food.The omakase is simply a misnomer. It is just a set menu with a single plate of sushi - all at once, rather than being made and served sequentially as omakase typically implies. In fact, the sushi is definitely NOT prepared by sushi-trained chefs - the pieces have terrible rice to fish ratio and is much too large for a single bite. Might as well be eaten with knives and forks.The creative ""fusion"" aspect seems to come out of the imagination of a 5 year old who had just been given a set of 36 colour pens and who wants to use all of them on a single canvas. A medley of flavours that are more substitutes than complements, with excessive felonious use of mayonnaise. To be fair, the ingredients used are super fresh which still injects deliciousness into the food.Service, like most Canadian places, are very nice as you'd expect.Ambience is also quite quaint and lovely."

I can definitely say that I've never eat sushi that good!For something like 50 to 60$ per person, you can have your best meal ever.Absolutely nothing bad to say about the food.However, during the pandemic, we've used the pick up option to get our food, and during the waiting outside in the lineup, we've witness some very bad things from the delivery guys:- First time, 2 weeks ago, while waiting, 2 delivery guys came in and out of the restaurant, no mask, no gloves, touching their phone's screen, doors, delivery orders, going inside the kitchen touching stuff, go back to their cars and never cleaned their hands once in process, and it happens at least 4 time the time I've waited, by 2 different guys.- second time, as I've arrive with my car, to park front of the restaurant, just behind me another car was trying to pass me over to park, and I quickly figured out that the driver was working here and seems to be late to his shift. He went through the line up, by hold his mask by hands (you are not supposed to touch your mask, especially while working) he jumped into the café Bazin, where we were waiting for the pick up, he touched food, delivery bags, and never washed his hands once since he leaved his car.Plus he was wearing his mask with his nose out,nobody told him anything, even what it was looks like his manager, it's a big no no for hygiene, especially in this covid times.Antonio Park and managers should really to be more serious about that, you can't play with customers health.Hopefully that critic will be seen and talked."

Although it's on the pricier side, the quality of the fish makes up it. The service we had was impeccable and the waiters were knowledgeable about the food being served and took their time to explain everything. To enjoy the experience, I think you have to like both traditional Japanese sushi and American fusion sushis."

Sadly this time didn't win me over. Yes the fish is fresh but I found it lacked taste. There was no wasabi in the box either to my disappointment. The sushi looked really good but in the end all tasted the same. Not my cup of tea ! For the price you could get just as good if not better at a lesser price. Wouldn't pay for the name ever again!
/user_details?userid=0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,Cindy Feng Xin L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Chef Antonio Park is a good friend who cares about the poor and the sick ones and wishes to offer quality food for every hungry soul. I ordered the most expensive take-out meal the Toro Dream (65$ + tx) because I was convinced, before tasting the actual food, that I would be impressed by the outstanding quality. Chef Park does extensive Instagram stories to show the process how he prepares the food, especially how he cuts the fish and seafood. I love it so much when I got the delivery at Montreal General Hospital. The team of the Park restaurant is very dedicated in delivering food to the needy ones during the Covid pandemic period, thank you so much Chef Park! Kamsamida!"
/user_details?userid=je8HtmTCy7WkoZLH-UJ5IQ,Amy W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love it. I've heard about this place for a while now. Always wanted to try it but the location is never convenient for me. Finally I did and I love it. The restaurant decor is cute and cozy; Semi formal (I felt a bit underdress with my casual clothes). We came here right after they open for dinner. Luckily we did cause 30 mins after, it was almost full. Service:Top-notch. Waiters are very nice and professional. Always filling our water. They gave us an extra spoon because we ordered a bimbinbap to share and my sister was just eating the rice with the spoon. He felt bad that I have to scoop the rice the bowl to my plate. Then the waiter provided us with different plates and said they are for us to avoid mixing the bimbinbap flavor and ruin the sushi flavor. So cute!Food:We ordered the sashimi bowl, 6 pieces nigiri and a bimbinbap for two people. I think it's enough as we weren't as hungry. The some sashimi were so good! Few were meh but it's okay. They are Instagram worth!! But I think maybe they should use something between the fish and ice cause each time I pick up a slice of fish, there's some ice stuck to it. The nigiri is good but I think we need  12 pieces for 2 people so we can each try all the nigiri. The biimbinbap was okay, nothing wow. I would come back again next time!!!"
/user_details?userid=JjrpeIkmuhk9Ab_5HEsqyw,Judy H.,"Mississauga, Canada",4 star rating,"The place looked romantic and expensive. However, there's no room for your parkas since they crowd the space with tables. It's hard to get around, especially for waiters. We got lucky and got the last 2 seats along the bar for a Saturday night at 5:35 pm. We were told ahead that we could stay only til 7 pm. The open kitchen was near us to see and observe the chef and all the cooks in the kitchen. I saw my dish ready to go too!! The washroom was large and clean. The service was wonderful and the waiter knew what he was talking about. Appetizer - butternut squash soup (Jap style). I loved every spoon of it. Would have loved it hotter, in temperature. Park bowl - is their version of a Korean bibimbap for $19. The sauce was not overpowering which was great. The Muti-grain rice is healthy which I like. And all the veggies that I got was wonderful. The tofu was hot and soft. Downside, I didn't know that food modification cost $5!!!!! I asked for a well done egg!! And usually a bibimbap does not come with a hard boiled egg. I've had it pan-fried. So that was a disappointment that cost me $5. I know it's not much, but at least tell me. (Waiter already told me that the tofu might cost me an extra $5.) At least the food was hot from beginning to end. My partner had a sushi roll. Presentation is spectacular. Taste wise- he said he had it better, especially in Richmond Hill Ontario. Overall, it was a nice experience. I would only go back for a celebration and if I was in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We really enjoyed our experience at Park. We called the day before and easily got a lunch reservation for 8 people. Two friends tried the Omakase lunch menu ($65), which consisted of a nice miso soup, albacore tuna plate with vegetables and a sauce, a platter of nigiri sushi, hot dish of salmon and a dessert. Between us we also ordered the Nigiri Park lunch (Nigiri sushi with a salad), Park lunch (Maki and Nigiri Sushi), Bibimbap, Chirashi and the 9piece sashimi. Every dish was excellent! My favourite was the sashimi because the fish was really well seasoned and just melted in your mouth. I found the quality and quantity of the dishes to be more than fair for the price. Prices varied from $18-$30. We also tried a few desserts! The black sesame ice cream was delicious and we ordered the Panna cotta because we were intrigued by the tomato sorbet that was part of the dish. The sorbet was very good but I would have liked a stronger tomato flavour.Overall a great lunch experience at Park!"

The 4 stars instead of the 5 is for the service but then again I am comparing it with pastel which has impeccable service.The blue fin tuna nigiri with Spanish cavier and the Japanese omelette was the best thing of the entire omasake menu. Highly recommend
/user_details?userid=2d4jfwQqnfjMLlKoAk1MvA,佳翼,"Pippy Park, Canada",2 star rating,Do not try the 8-course tasting menu! Very ordinary stuff for 155 per person. The most delicious thing among all of these is Tamagoyaki. I am not sue if this is because it is  Japanese fusion. All the food tastes wired comparing to authentic Japanese food.

The service was excellent and I have nothing bad to say about him. Let's move on to the food. My wife and I had the miso soup and it was very salty. We ordered the assorted sashimi and the selection were not really premium sashimi for what we're paying. We ordered the Wagyu and it did not taste like Wagyu. My wife and I have been to a lot of Japanese restaurants all over the world and my wife is Japanese so we know what we're talking about. The nigiris, honestly nothing special and smaller than what a nigiri is supposed to be. The Hokkaido uni was so tiny for what you pay. We ended up spending about $350 without alcohol. The place was packed and we came at 10pm. This place was just not for us."
/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Amazing. Hands down the best sushi I have tasted yet. No lie. Went there for dinner on a Friday evening in May and was not disappointed. Can't you tell by now I was very satisfied? Let me tell you more.After hyping it for many months now, I finally got to taste it. At first, I was scared that all the hype that I have built over the months will end up disappointing me. I was not let down. OK, time to stop talking about my hype and delve into the actual food and experience. Located in Westmount, this restaurant serves, you guessed it, sushi, among other things of course. The decor was nice and cozy. The staff was also welcoming and knowledgeable about their menu. As for the menu, they offer different plates and dishes, which also includes tasting menus - one more ""table d'hote"" style and another one which is a sushi tasting menu. We went for the latter. The tasting platter comes with about 25 pieces per person, which is sufficient to be full but not sick from the amount. It includes different pieces like various kinds of sashimi, nigiri and maki. The sashimi were really good, with great texture for every kind of fish. The nigiris were also great, but what was really really good were the makis. They were so tasty, with great mix of flavors in your mouth. To be noted, the sashimis were also accompanied by different sauces, which were all good.Overall, this was a great experience, albeit expensive. For a guy who is used to crappy AYCE sushi, I am not sure if I can get back after tasting such high standard food. Recommended 100%!"

For entrees, we had ribeyes which were flavoured very well and melted in your mouth!  The halibut was delicious!  I had sea bream which was full of flavour, tender, and flaky!  My youngest has beef teriyaki don (she loved it).  The meal was very memorable and we will definitely return!!!"

I think it's because we ordered meat and so that's where we went wrong. We only ate the sushi as an appetizer. The sushi was definitely better than the meat. This time I came for lunch with a colleague. The lunches are pretty affordable and it's good sized portions. Lunch comes with a miso soup. I ordered the bento box which had a chicken kimchi, salad , sushi rolls and glass noodles. I like that it had a good variety of things in the bento box. The waiter was a bit rude. It was my colleague's birthday and the guy was like ""I'm not going to sing for you"" and he made other comments like that throughout the lunch. Also he asked my colleague if he wanted a birthday dessert since it was his birthday and it wasn't on the house! He charged us for it. I didn't even notice it until my colleague went home that night and looked at his bill. That was very unexpected. The dessert was pana cotta with tomatoes and tomato ice cream. It was surprisingly good considering it tomato everything."

Ok, the soups were very delicious. We had the miso soup and the soup of the day (zucchini and shiso). Both very tasty and full of character. But that was the main highlight for me. We had the Park sashimi, Park bowl (bibimbap) and chef's maki (their seasonal roll topped with oyster mushrooms). The quality of the fish was good but the sashimi was otherwise unremarkable. The maki was mediocre: the flavors didn't go well together and the size was huge, definitely not a bite. The oyster mushrooms were ok, but too salty to have them separately from the roll. The vegetarian bowl was alright, but again, not remarkable. If anything, the stone was not hot enough to make the rice crispy. We got le chocolat for dessert. It was a chocolate bavarois with peanut-flavored cream and caramel drops. No complaints there. Hats off to our server who was very personable and accommodating, and had a good sense of humor."
/user_details?userid=kj957ScE-jE3DtrQM6UhHg,Ashlee H.,"New York, NY",1 star rating,"TL;DR - If you've dined at other omakase restaurants in NYC, SF, or LA, do not come here. You'll leave hugely disappointed with a relatively empty stomach and a lighter wallet.Really disappointed despite the numerous great reviews. My boyfriend and I were visiting Montreal and this was our first dinner in the city. We were hyped. When we got there, the restaurant was empty, and stayed that way for another hour or so, which wasn't a good sign.I have many other gripes about dining at Park so get ready. Firstly, the waiter told us the omakase options started at $115 CAD which conflicted with the $95 CAD listed on the menu. We were fine with the upcharge and assumed it'd be worth it; we were wrong. Because they sat us at the special ""chef's table"" we were able to see directly into the kitchen. Many of the dishes were premade and sat in the fridge or on the counter for what felt like years. That's all fine and dandy but when they finally got to our table, some of the fish were much colder than they should have been! To make matters worse, the majority of the dishes looked gorgeous but had little to no substance. Flavors were either not present or obscured by other ingredients like excessive eel sauce, unnecessary tempura flakes, or a weird pickled beet daikon. Also, for uni lovers, prepare yourselves: you only get a very, very small dab of it in a later dish which you can only barely detect. Don't expect quality chu- or oo-toro as well.At the end of our meal, with our tummies still fairly empty, we heard the waiter offer another table a $95 CAD omakase. We were extremely irritated knowing that we could have spent less on such a sub-par meal. Now, it could be the case that Montreal has a shortage of good omakase places which is why reviews are inflated so keep that in mind. If you've been to places in NYC, SF, or LA, you'll be able to taste the difference immediately, so my advice is to stay away! Don't fall into the same trap I fell in."

We spent $100 for 3 people, we left hungry and the sushi was MEH! I've had amazing sushi for the same price!

Miso soup with with a soft boiled egg - OK but nothing special2. 2 pieces if hamachi with a mango sauce - fish was tasteless and the mango sauce didn't pair well with the fish3. Assortment of niggiri - they all tasted the same although different fishes were used. Fish was flavor less and the rice was poorly seasoned 4. Fried fish filet with some vegetables - fish was OK but vegetables were salty as hell. I came to a sushi restaurant  so why are you serving me a fried fish filet?!?4. Basil ice cream with crumble - this was the only dish that game me a hint of surprise. The basil flavor is very pronounced and interesting. Not to say that I would buy it at a ice cream shop but it was interesting.I only took a coke and the bill came up to $75 including tip. For that price, I would have expected a much better quality and flavor of the food.Don't let my pictures fool you. This place is definitely not worth trying. If you want good sushi, message me and I will recommend much better restaurants. Almost feel like I would have been more satisfied going to Sushi Shop!"
/user_details?userid=VWQWbrHagnQ86VVxQ6xCog,Yier A.,Hong Kong,2 star rating,Terrible food quality based on the 85$ price for an Omakase course. VERY OILY pork soup and the appetizer is again fried super oily chyasyu pork(which you can get for 15$) at a ramen place. Sashimi are not fresh enough since they just marinated everything in a vinegar tasting  sauce. Fish loses its original texture and tastes almost all the same. And fish's quality is terrible as well (please see the picture of that tuna piece). Service was rather slow too. Refused to let me sit at the table first. Any downtown Izakaya can be a better place for Japanese cuisine.

This was neither. I had high expectations for the sushi, but we live in the sushi capital of America (So Cal) so I'm used to great sushi. It was just okay. Nothing amazing or wow. Which brings me to the reason III am writing this review. For okay sushi it was extraordinarily expensive. I never mind paying for a great dinner if it's waranted, this was not. About $250 US for 2 people and one glass of wine each. No dessert. The place has a very nice ambiance, but they were blasting ghetto rap music and every other word was the ""N"" word, which for us really took the class out of the atmosphere. So all-in-all I would say unless you are really desperate for a sushi dinner that will be average and costly: pass."

A friend of mine had been a regular here during a 3 month work trip and gave me the advice that I will pass to you now - get the Maki and the Nigiri, everything else is just good. The Maki and Nigiri were amazing and as for my favorite aforementioned bite, that goes to the mackerel nigiri special, pictures top right below. Service was great as expected but the food and the value (as we were shocked at how low our bill was for what we ordered) stand out."

The setting is simple, lighting is good, not too bright but not too dark, just enough so you can see your food properly (and snap pics, lol!)We started off with some cocktails: one had nori, one had litchi and one had watercress, all were delicious! We went for the Chef's Choice 6-course menu. Prepare to eat because it may not seem like a lot of food when the 1st course comes out, you might be unbuttoning by the 3rd course (we actually had to take our dessert to go because we couldn't possibly eat more)Now, I'm certain I do not need to say too much about the quality of the food as chef Antonio Park has quite a reputation but I will say that it was absolutely worth the walk in the -15°C from the metro to get there. Even -30°C I'd still do it. Amazing pairing of different ingredients and the fish were very fresh. Let the pictures show you what the experience was like and go there to judge for yourself. (The ONLY thing I would say was that the crust on the seared halibut was a tad too salty for my taste but it paired incredibly well with the hazelnut butter)"

I had to give it a try bc his food was really like artwork. We were on bachlorette trip and it was too late to accommodate a big party so we split up and go separate days. My husband has tried them last year while I was pregnant and just told me to request each different kind of fish bc apparently this place is the only place to be able to ship in all sorts of fishes internationally. The Reatauranr is very upscale modern which seems to be in a nice part of town. I'm not from the area but from the looks of surrounding place it was pretty nice. It's just kind of small but it's fine it's intimate and it has a large open kitchen and wine cellar which was really well kept as it should given that it's an upscale restaurant.I did just what my husbdan said and it was the best 150 bucks I've ever spent. Sac just downs thsve sushi like this. It was all in his pairing of fish and garnishing on top. Every bite was worth it it didn't even need soy Ans ginger! It was so delightful and melt in your mouth goodness. I'm so excited to have tried this place and I can't wait to go to Japan to get the real stuff. I have a feeling this was pretty close! Will be back when I'm in the area.

I found this place via a Chowhound thread, while searching for an establishment that offered wild caught fish and grass-fed beef options. Unfortunately, the server was not able to tell me whether or not they had any wild-caught fish on the menu. In fact, gauging by her bewilderment, I'm not even sure she realized that some fish are caught wild and some are raised on farms. The question seemed to really confuse her. So, I had no idea if I was eating fish riddled with PCBs or not.But was it good? Well, my picky 6-year-old loved his beef teriyaki even though it was made with ""healthy"" rice. And I loved my sashimi spread even if I had no idea where the hell those fish came from or what their diet consisted of. Also, the kimchi side was good and strong though not the super crunchy style if that's what you prefer. Otherwise, there was nothing spectacular to note about Park, but I would go back again IF I was able to get some answers regarding how they source their meat and fish."

Most reviews are done by people who are happy to get a good spicy tuna roll.But in this case, the critics and the hype let me down as well.We went for lunch and the place is beautiful, with a matching beautiful staff as well.And we asked for the 7-piece Nigiri ""Chefs Choice"" ... when I referred to it as ""Omakase"" he mentioned that there's a $70CAD full Omakase option and if we would like that? We said yes as we were sitting at the Sushi Bar and were really thrilled about this...The omakase began with a chilled soup, which was greatFrom there it continued to go downhillThe next course had overcooked shrimpThen came 7 pieces of NigiriIt always makes me nervous when the chef pre-cuts and makes all the pieces together, instead of presenting them one-at-a-time for Omakase... but so be itAs long as it tastes good, right?The fish was rubbery, the rice was dry... and the only time you didn't notice these things is when it was covered with a shishito pepper or maple syrup glaze... etcNext came the Sashimi... the only tasty piece was the tuna, and that may have been cause it was lightly seared and had (i think) truffle salt on it.Next, the Maki roll with mushroom and three types of fish. It may have been the best thing I had. I realized this should've been a ""special maki rolls"" type sushi experience instead of some creative Nigiri thing.. but oh well...That Maki roll had a ton of mushroom on it (reminiscent of Bibimbap mushrooms), my partner had trouble eating it because it was massive with all the stuff on top.Overall, a big disappointment given the hype and anticipation and positive critical reviews. Definitely wasn't worth the long uber trek from Vieux Montreal and back."

My companion and I had wonderful service from start to finish, which was never intrusive but very attentive. I started with a mellow glass of Chardonnary and we shared the Asian salad. It was fresh, had crispy shredded vegetables with almonds and fried garlic - perfect palate opener. We then shared the Nigiri Sushi Moriawase and the Sashimi Moriawase, with an added order of Toro sashimi. I loved the different toppings on the nigiri sushi which accented each type of fish, I would have never been able to imagine some of them myself but I enjoyed every morsel. The sashimi came with soy, a chimichurri sauce, a basil-based sauce, and a butternut squash based sauce (if memory serves me correctly). We focused on keeping it simple with plain soy and the chimichurri sauce to add a little variation. The toro was melt-in-your mouth delicious, and the various other slices were excellent. They all tasted extremely fresh, which is what impressed me the most. For dessert we also shared the chocolate/peanut butter plate which had an interesting texture and wasn't overly sweet - a wonderful ending to a much anticipated meal."

The restaurant was half-empty.It seemed we weren't assigned a server at all. Each person in the restaurant helped us at some point.  This meant that we needed to explain our dietary restrictions numerous times and I never knew who to look for when I had a question or request.The seared tuna sashimi appetizer was fresh-out-of-the-refrigerator cold and the chimichurri was overpowering. Miso soup and edamame were fine. The noodles were one-dimensional. The nigiri sushi was nice, but I really didn't need to see more chimichurri.Will I return?  For takeout, maybe."

I wish we took the time to read reviews prior to booking our reservations. Service was terrible. I would have expected better service from a Swiss Chalet, let alone a ""high end restaurant"". I understand preparing aesthetically pleasing dishes take some time but we waited 30-45min between every dish. I looked around the restaurant and noticed that everyone was also waiting around for their food so it certainly wasn't a one-off. When the server was clearing our table he accidentally spilled sauce all over the table and dripping onto my designer handbag. I couldn't blame him as mistakes happen. He promptly cleaned the table with a cloth and when I asked for another to try to wipe off my bag, he handed to me same dirty rag!!! I could only stare at him in shock. How dense can someone be that they offer up a wet, dirty, stained rag to clean an expensive handbag?!?! The food was pricey and underwhelming. The fish on the sushi was thinly sliced and overall inferior to that of Toronto restaurants. The one redeeming quality was that I was full (after spending $200 for 2 people). I read that other diners left hungry...the key is to order the bibimbap which was very filling ;) After the poor service and disappointing meal, I am really nervous to visit any other Antonio Park establishments.  PS. Check out the ""menu"" section of the photos to read a response from Chef Park to one diner.....it really demonstrates how Park does not understand customer service at all."

The twist of new Asian flavours AND textures (outside of the norm) took me by surprise. The creativity behind each dish was candidly inspiring. And the presentation, each mix of ingredients (whether a fish skin or a seed) was a authentically hand crafted work of art. This place IS different, and yes expensive. In this world we live in, you don't get something (great) for nothing. It's worth the $plurge."

I was immensely impressed and so was my boyfriend. We are both very big sushi fans and have heard wonders but last night we took it upon ourselves to try it, due to a special occasion.We had the omakase tasting menu which consisted of a 5 course meal. Entree which was a miso based tofu with crunchy quinoa , octopus and kobe beef bits. Textures and tastes were phenomenal. Then we had the coho salmon with a yuzu and tomato based reduction , the specialty nigiris came after; so we had a chance to try a selection of rare fish, a plate of spicy salmon maki rolls came in next with a ginger shrimp topping and finally a simple elegant sashimi bowl for each of us that consisted of blue fin tuna with caviar, irish salmon and japanese butterfly fish. Amazing food and even greater service. The wait staff truly knows how to operate as a team and their attention to detail really mesmerized us. Completely worth every penny and highly recommend it!

/user_details?userid=YOmyzxTFYULhTCHdDgWQRA,Cathy Yuqi G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Probably one of the best meals I have eaten in Montreal. Usually I don't eat high end sushi because I don't feel like there would be that much of a difference, but Park Restaurant just blew my mind.First off, the restaurant is smaller than expected, really cosy but also gives a fancy and luxurious vibe. The waitress is super welcoming and friendly. They answered all my questions patiently and presented each piece of sashimi and nigiri with detail which really helps since I am not a pro in sushi (some sashimi really look alike, don't they?).Since I wanted to try a little bit of everything, I ordered the moriawase sashimi, the moriawase nigiri and the chef's maki. - moriawase sashimi: It blew my mind because of how fresh it was. Each type of fish has its own texture and flavour (I never noticed that before when I ate sashimi in sushi buffet). Even the salmon one tasted different. I love love love the white tuna, it melts in your mouth. The three sauce they offer you are great as well. My favourite is the basil one.- moriawase nigiri: The presentation is so on point. All the nigiri tasted different since all of them has their individual complementary sauce and topping. You don't need to dip it in anything since I was told that the rice was already seasoned, which is great because when I try to dip nigiri in soy sauce it often becomes super messy and soaked...- chef's maki: super expensive, it comes to 5$ per piece of maki, but it is definitely a new maki experience that I have never had before. The maki we had had tempura inside and was topped with shrimp. The maki were huge, couldn't put a whole one into my mouth. The shrimp on top alone was super tasty, the shrimp was juicy and flavourful, but at the same time you could still taste the natural flavour of the shrimp. The sauce is really tasty but it does not cover the natural flavour of the ingredients.It was a pretty expensive meal, but I think it was worth every penny. I'll come back for sure but I'll probably come at lunch or brunch since the prices are more affordable."

The place is a modern restaurant with high ceilings, nice tables, sushi bar and highlight of it all was the HUGE wine display. There was some confusion with our reservation but Antonio made it happen (thank you) and we were on our merry way.Service: The hostess and one of the waitress had a serious RBF (resting btch face) could it hurt to smile a little? But our server was nice and thorough with explaining everything (désolé, j'oublié son nom).Drinks: I got the hot sake (medium), my sister got the Yuzu tonic (super yum) and our friend got the litchi cocktail (meh). Drinks are decently priced (11-15) but I wish they had more cold sake selection. They tried convincing me to order a bottle of sake knowing that I will be the only person drinking it even though I told them I was driving (in a unfamiliar foreign city in which lanes do not exist and the road is like a free-for-all but that's for another story).Food: Their omakase starts at $85/person (which is decent) and goes up to $115 (I think). We ordered the fish omakase ($115/person). Our first dish was a carrot, taro root soup (I was about to lick the bowl) then we had two pieces of smoked bonito (was very underwhelming), then a platter of nigiri, tuna make (I don't understand why their maki was so big - like you can't even fit it into your mouth without choking and dying big. Isn't it supposed to actually fit in one bite?), followed by a bowl of sashimi, a julienne seared fish bowl (on the house) and finally dessert. Of all the dishes, we only enjoyed the soup and the o-toro nigiri. We ordered more o-toro nigiri (4 pieces = $50) but it wasn't as good as the one served from our platter (definitely looked like a lower grade o-toro if that actually exist?). We didn't particularly enjoy our sashmi bowl even though our favourite uni was there. We were hoping to get uni from Boston or Hokkaido but we were serve uni from Quebec - still good but mine had a foul taste unfortunately. Finally, there was dessert. Maybe I can't appreciate the finer things like plating tiny desserts in a GINORMOUS plate.. the dessert was... meh. It looked like the made 5 tiny dessert, unsure of what to do with them then some genius thought it would be a masterpiece to stick all five tiny things that didn't even go well together on to a huge plate.Overall, I would not return because I can get even better omakase in Toronto with less than that and their rice was so lacking it didn't have the mirin taste. Our bill came up to almost $600 with tax and tips. I had super high expectations of this place because of the hype for the restaurant."
/user_details?userid=Hib9c10vUQWvNpmysW_c0A,Victoria X.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,"It took me quite a while to convince myself to revisit for the 3rd time Park Sushi. My initial experiences had left me wanting more from what was proclaimed as 'the best sushi on the East side.'However, ranked at nb 13 on the canadas100best restaurants list, I figured this place probably had some merit and deserved a closer attention at what made it shine, the sushi.Located in posh Westmount, just below the trendy shopping west side of Sherbrooke street, Park stands alone in the restaurant scene. Nested on the first floor of an office building, it's warm wood heavy decor welcomes you to a rather untypical but very modern layout for a sushi restaurant where the sushi bar fuses as one with the open kitchen in the back.We were seated at the bar and greeted warmly by our bartender/waitress who was surprisingly down to earth and had no problem calling for help when our questions on the wine list surpassed her knowings. The wine list itself is heavier on the dry whites as it pairs better with sushi and with the help of our servers we picked a perfect bottle of white from Greece. Great way to start the night as we tchin-tchined onwards to the menu!Having visited twice already and being disappointed with their omakase tasting menu, we decided to stay away from their hot menu items and focus on their sure beats - the sashimis and nigiris as well as the chef's maki. Needless to stay, this 3rd visit was by far the best. Yes it's pricey, but it's definitely the most mouth watering bite of fresh raw fish you'll find in Montreal. Especially their nigiris which are all individually topped with different little garnishes (jalapeños, black caviar, fresh herbs) and lightly pre dipped in soy sauce. You don't need to do anything to it besides put it in your mouth and let the tenderness of the nigiri melt in your mouth! Yes mouth watering indeed! We were also lucky enough that evening that the chef's maki of the day was topped with blue fin tuna, the most buttery piece of fish you'll ever taste hands down!The night had been going so well at that point that we decided to be tempted into dessert. Their desserts are not the typical green tea ice cream and fried bananas you'd usually find in a Japanese restaurant. Creativity shone through as classic flavours meet epicureanism. Chocolate moelleux with blood orange creme brûlée and a match chiffon cake anyone? Yes, me please!Needless to say, we definitely left this time highly satisfied. Excellent service, great wine pairing perfectly with high quality food and to top it off an amazing dessert, what more can you ask for? The saying 'third time's a charm' definitely encompasses how we felt from our visit. We'll be back for a forth! But from now on, only sushi :)"

My first impression was not bad. The server was really nice and I could definitely feel that I am well treated as I visited a pricey restaurant. :) However, I personally thought the food was a bit hyped in a way that the taste itself was somewhat- ""hmm..."" We tried sushi platter and several small plates (chicken rice, yam noodle). The plates were beautiful and all ingredients were fresh and fancy. However, the taste was not what I expected, the combination of the fancy ingredients ruined the taste. I almost felt the chef sacrificed the balance of the texture & taste for including on-trend ingredients (such as super food grains..).Maybe I'd visit again for dinner and only for sushi (as the freshness is important)  but still, I can't help saying this place is hyped."
/user_details?userid=swx0FJkZWb6nVP58ZsMl7w,Meng Z.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"There has been a lot of mixed critics for Park, either preaching it or dismissing it and I think this variation is due to the different definition of a good sushi that people have. Park serves traditional japansese/south american fusion sushi a large selection of fresh fishes and delicate seasoning. Therefore, the odds of ingredients such as tempura shrimp or mayo are very slim. The flavours are a lot more on the delicate side, bringing out the taste of the different fishes. During my visit, we ordered a deconstructed salad for 2, a selection of nigiri and a selection of sashimi. I was pleasantly surprised by the salad, which consisted of a large selection of vegetables and toppings as well as different sauces, each with their speciality - a definite must try! I don't know enough about fishes to judge the sashimi slices, but the pairing of the different flavours with the different fishes on the nigiri was very good and interesting (it makes use of south american ingredients such as hot peppers).Overall, I had a great experience here. The food is not cheap but you are paying for the quality and selection of fish (and the ambience of the place)."

I found their maki rolls a bit too saucey and was overly intrusive with their toppings which ended up overpowering the freshness of the fish and the actual maki. As well, parts of the sauce separated into this watery consistency. Their sashimi and sushi was much better compared to their maki rolls. Though the sushi rice could have a been softer in all fronts.All in all, I feel this place tried too hard to push the envelope on their dishes and fell short on execution."

Didn't take my boyfriends dairy allergy seriously and served him bread that gave him an allergic reaction. Even after we asked the server twice if the bread had dairy- he didn't bother to check. Luckily he did not eat the whole thing. -Rude hostess who was not willing to accommodate us at all even though we made a reservation weeks in advance.

For the omakase, each of of us had: -The soup (which was already quite big)- The sustainable blue fin tuna sashimi- A selection of 7 various sushis with distinctive tastes  (You can actually taste the fish and the little add ons that are not overpowering) - 4-5 pieces of a glorious and chubby maki roll- 9 piece plate of sashimi- A decadent carrot cake (with a basil/citrus espuma) all of that in a white chocolate egg shellTruly memorable experience."

It started off with a very mild chicken broth with some kimchi.  The second dish was bone marrow with some shrimp and a heavy dill sauce. Next came the nigiri.  What happened to the sushi rice?  It was undercooked and not properly seasoned.  The nigiri fish was pretty good, just not mind blowing good.  Each had its own unique topping, like jalapeño, or shishito pepper, peppercorns, caviar, etc. Then we got some maki rolls.  I can't remember what was in them... They were alright.  My dining companions opted for the sashimi bowl course.  The sashimi pieces were actually much better than the nigiri fish.  Albacore, Hamachi, and Chinook Salmon.  However, the pieces just sat in some watered down sauce in a big bowl.  Was there supposed to be wasabi?  Dessert was something along the lines of a marzipan cake with some citrus garnishes.  I think our expectations were set way too high and Park just didn't deliver.  So many accolades!  Sure, you have all these big names coming in and out of your establishment too, but c'mon... Sushi isn't just about the fish, or who you know...  your rice was a disappointment.  Oh yeah, and what's with the bathroom situation?  Using the bathrooms in the common area of a commercial building?  You need your own bathrooms!"

If you live to eat sushi and have done omakases in Japan and NYC, prob not worth your time, unfortunately. We were really looking forward to the ""Argentinian-Korean-Japanese fusion"" style but we had the same chimichurri sauce on the park style sashimi and seared bluefin starters. This overpowered the taste of the fish so I just took it off and used wasabi and soy sauce which brought out the taste of the fresh fish. The nigiri had a bit too much wasabi on some (inconsistent) and I like my wasabi and soy sauce for my sushi (ie tears in my eyes). The miso soup was really good. The Hokkaido uni gunkan was unreal (excellent). Overall, enjoyed the vibes of the resto but for a seasoned and critical sushi lover, Park just did no cut it for me especially for this price point. This would be a nice spot to impress a date who doesn't know too much about sushi but I would not recommend to my foodie friends."

It definitely lives up to the hype :) This is a great restaurant for a special occasion or fancy date night , they do have some tables for groups that look to fit approx 6or so people. The decor is very pretty and modern but still inviting and warm. While the prices are little bit elevated the quality of the food and service makes it worth it. I tried the yuzu gin cocktail which was nice and refreshing. For dinner we had the tasting menu and every part of it was awesome ! It started with a seafood soup-delicious broth , fresh seafood and on a cold night it really hit the spot. Next came a wagyu beef appetizer with crispy rice and greens and a poached egg, this tasted almost like a version of a mini bibimbap , very flavourful and the beef melts in your mouth :) then came the sushi (chefs choice pieces) , it was so fresh and beautifully presented  and paired with amazing little sauces and special touches each one tasted unique and delicious .  We also had the blackened cod with house made noodles , while this dish was very tasty I just wish the cod would have had more of a crispness on the blackened portion. Their dessert was also beautiful and yummy without being too heavy (it was a white chocolate and raspberry cake with raspberry sorbet) ,it satisfied our sweet tooth without being overly sweet, a great end to a great meal! I believe they do serve Sunday brunch as well but have not yet tried it for myself (Also useful note , they do take reservations and accept credit&debit cards and cash.)"

I'll explain later. First of all, I want to say that if your only sushi experience is Kanda or other all you can eat buffets, this isn't the place for you. The food is prepared different and the price point is a bit different too. LOLI called for a reservation and was told we could only sit at the bar. No problem, my fault for waiting last minute to make a reservation.  The only problem with sitting at the bar is that the plates they serve the food on are far too large for the small area at the bar. Meaning, my plate was interfering with the lady to my left's personal space. I ordered the tasting menu (Omakase) for 105$ which replaces a seafood dish with actual sushi. My husband got the braised beef ribs and a 6 piece sushi starter. Everything was incredible. The seafood was so fresh you could actually taste the ocean on them.  What made me even more happy was the way the food was presented. Everything was nice on wooden planks, nicely decorated, and perfect pops of color.Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and explained each piece of sushi to me as she set the plate down in front of me. She was quick to offer my husband suggestions on what to eat since he isn't a big fan of sushi (he took me there for my birthday dinner).As someone in the restaurant business I have to say that it was amazing to see such a knowledgeable staff, a staff that goes above and beyond to help each other out, and most importantly, a CLEAN kitchen! You can see directly into Park's kitchen and that kitchen is spotless!The only thing I disliked (besides my food invading the personal space of someone else) is that a few times I saw the waiters carrying the food improperly. Basically, a waiter was holding a plank of sushi from the top so his hand is practically touching a piece of sushi. Food should never be handled like that. The same waiter served two bowls of soup with his thumbs in the soup bowl.  To me that isn't enough to change the rating froma  5 star to a 4 star because it had nothing to do with the food or my personal service. Just a little something that Chef Antonio can talk to his staff about.Will I be back, yes for sure. Will I order the same thing? Probably not. Next time I'll just order sushi (maki and nigri) instead of the full tasting menu. I don't like ALL types of sashimi."

I made the reservation about 2 weeks in advance, and was told over the phone that the entire table had to go with the omakase (tasting) menu; luckily for our crew, that was completely fine.We all arrived on time and were seated around a horseshoe-shaped booth. The ambiance of this place is a cool elegance and the music was really good and not too loud.I lived in Vancouver for so many years, that I have always scoffed at the very idea of sushi in Montreal but several people I know (and trust food-wise) told me that Park was off the charts awesome and that I would love it. Perhaps my expectations were set too high and it pains me to only give the place 3 stars, but I have definitely had better sushi before; many times before.The omakase menu started with a soup, it was quite good. It was followed by the oysters. They were fabulous and the chimichurri sauce was a really tasty, unexpected pairing. The scallop that followed up was incredible: cooked just right, seasoned perfectly...I could have eaten an entire plate of those. Next came the sashimi...although presented beautifully, only 1 of them had a unique taste (the salmon) and the rest were very bland and indistinguishable from the others. The seared ahi tuna which came after arrived on the biggest plate I have ever seen. I normally love seared ahi, but this one was very overcooked, white throughout, salty and chewy; I didn't even eat half of it as it hurt my jaw to chew it. The dessert however was delicious, simple and yummy.The pros: cool cocktail list, great wine selection, amazing desserts, the oysters and scallops, prices.The cons: many of the dishesOne more con: being asked every 5 minutes if we would like more water (their policy is to only leave a bottle at your table if you purchase a bottle, but if you are just drinking plain old water, well then too bad, you will be asked for a refill over and over again: felt almost bullied into buying bottled water)All in all, the reviews are too good to not give this place one more chance...perhaps they had an off night, a late fish delivery...I dunno. I want to love Park, so stay tuned for an updated review once I give it one more go."

We had the nigiri plate 12 pcs and the chef maki. The maki was salmon, albacore, mushroom, truffle oil and ""teriyaki sauce"". The salty sauce was overpowering the fish and rice so we couldn't taste the blend of every ingredient (what i am expecting when i eat maki)...

/user_details?userid=5lT1GxGTIArrYbZGazAm-A,Ida K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The floral decorations are my fav thing about this restaurant, then the service and, sadly, last is the food. My partner and i got dinner here tonight(march 2018). For appetizers we got a miso soup, a soup of the day(cream based zucchini and shiso) and sashimi. Both soups came in generously large bowls and were  excellent (perhaps my fav miso soup in town). The sashimi appetzer was good. 3 fish types is an appropriately mild citrusy sauce. It was nice, but not at the level expected from a high end sushi place. We then got the vegetarian park bowl and the special maki (tuna and salmon, mushrooms on top). There was nothing outstanding or particularly satisfying about the vegetarian park bowl: you can get the same/better bibimbap at jumak on queen mary or kinka izakaya in downtown; definitely overpriced and not worth coming back for. The maki was the most disappointing for various reasons: it was a struggle to ""fit"" each piece in our mouths which is reminscent of cheaper sushi places that attract customers with quantity vs quality. The mushrooms were tasty but completely overpowered the fish. I'd say you could barely taste the fish which is a huge disappointment for a sushi lover. We got the ""le chocolate"" for desert and luckily it didn't totally disappoint. It mainly included chocolate bavarois and peanut epsuma. The chocolate bavarois was great: nice soft chocolate with the perfect level os switness. We could barely feel the peanut flavor in the epsuma; but it was creamy and tasty. So not a HUGE deal... I should confess that we saw some nigiris on other tables and they were served in a pefect size and shape and the fish looked very nice. So there's a chance that we missed the best item on the menu. But even if that was true, it wouldn't raise my overall opinion of this place to anything above 3.5 stars."

/user_details?userid=u4iBXHU_ZCUIXymxkcsHdA,Jessica M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Food: 4/5Service: 4/5Cleanliness: 4.5/5Price: $$$We didn't make any reservations this time because we visited on an early Monday evening. It seems like a good idea to make a reservation whenever you plan to visit because it was packed by the time we left, surprising on a Monday night! It definitely tells you how popular and well-loved the restaurant is by us local Montrealers.There were two types of omakase: 5-course for $95 or 6-course for $115. We didn't know there were two types prior to arrival, but we decided to go all out because it was our anniversary and all :). The full 6-course omakase gives you all the types of sushi in the house (compared to the 5-course) and you also get maki as well. I'm not 100% sure on the differences on the omakase, so ask your server.Our dinner that evening started off with their Surf and turf noodle soup. I personally didn't fully understand as to why it was surf and turf (perhaps I missed out on what our server had said) which led me to flavour confusion: what was surf and what was turf about it? Overall the soup was delicious but I think I would've enjoyed it a little more had I not know that it was surf and turf. My husband on the other hand enjoyed it very much no matter what the soup was called as the flavours were well balanced and the lemongrass was a great choice to enhance flavours.Our second course was brought out short after our soup and it was so beautifully plated! Tasting toro with caviar was certainly a first for us, but it will definitely not be our last! The textures, flavours, and everything else was quite mind blowing. The citrusy sauce suited the dish very well and overall the dried carrots and whole mustard seeds balanced the soft toro textures. I especially liked the edible flowers!What we really liked about our third course was that each sushi was not only seasoned with soy sauce but also garnished with various toppings for each unique characteristics of the fish used. Everything from sweet unagi sauce (I think) to jalapeños, Korean gochujang sauce, pickles, salsa, and much more. The different garnishes definitely not only added an extra kick to the nigiri but it also represented Chef Antonio Park's three cultures, Korean, Japanese and South American, very well. I also think the different garnishes are the prime reason why you wouldn't need extra soy sauce. Each nigiri was so flavourful and it really did just melt in your mouth. This course was my favourite out of the 6 that we had (my husband's was the fifth), and I know that I'm going to come back here for more of their nigiri sushi!We were next presented with a maki as our fourth course. To be honest this was our least favourite but we really enjoyed the condensed scallop topping. The maki itself was average, nothing extraordinary and it was futomaki style (seaweed on the outside). What topped each piece of maki was the condensed scallop ""sponge"". The texture of it was very similar to that of a soft sponge, and we were surprised that we were able to taste the scallop flavours very strongly! It really did feel like you were eating a whole scallop. We didn't fully like the scallop with the maki, and I found it impossible to put both in my mouth at the same time :P. I don't think we'd order it à la carte because we much prefer nigiri and sashimi, but we'd like to try other makis because we've seen some pretty exciting ones at nearby tables. Our anniversary dinner at Park was definitely a memorable one. The service we received was top notch and we enjoyed each and every course from our omakase. Between the two tasting menus, I highly recommend the 6-course because I think it's well worth the extra $20. The sheer quality of each carefully crafted dish was amazing and as a big lover of Japanese cuisine, Restaurant Park deserves a high rating! Hubby and I've enjoyed fine Japanese cuisine in many places (see here) throughout our time together, and Park's omakase is definitely on our top list. However, we've visited the restaurant for lunch before and our experience wasn't as enjoyable as our omakase was. Maybe it was because the restaurant was packed therefore our food was rushed, perhaps because the lunch menu isn't as Japanese (more Korean inspired), or maybe we visited on a bad day. Our lunch experience definitely affects the overall rating of Park even though we've had a fantastic dinner. Perhaps we'd go back for lunch on another occasion!"

That might be a dish you can get if you want a full tummy here on a lower budget.Since it was my birthday, we got a slice of a cake that had coconut in it, and it tasted more remarkable than any birthday cake I could have gotten. If I do not remember wrong, it also had rhubard in it and the consistency had just the perfect crunchiness that was soft enough for me to chew it comfortable and sill carry the top of the cake that was rigourously worked to infuse the flavours."

Fish was not fresh, so he has to cover them with strong sauce. 2. He's trying too hard to be different and creative. 3. Lack of confidence so he believes more is better. If you are going to charge $8 for a miso soup, at least put in two clams or a shrimp or something ..a plain soup out of an instant soup package is just morally wrong to ask 8 bucks.

I mean.. I like the caviar, I like that little herby cilantro thing that they put in the sashimi as well as in the bowl, but there wasn't enough rice by far, and I left hungry even after having an appetizer.The service is fantastic. They're really nice here, fast, and very friendly. 5 stars for the waitstaff.THE BADTheir other offerings are not so amazing. I mean I feel like this is slightly amped up regular ol' street food, with its retail cost multiplied by a factor of .5 to make up for them being in Westmount and calling themselves 'haute cuisine'.I could eat sushi and equally delicious Japanese-fusion (ish) food for a quarter of the price elsewhere.This place is really for rich Westmounties who need a nice, classy, upscale-y place to go on an expense account because to come here on your own dime is just silly (yeah I'm an idiot).Would I come back?Sure, if someone else was paying.

/user_details?userid=_oFZVJPGkIKYbDsfP2YaPA,Nicole M.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Honestly, this would have gotten three stars but now it is getting one. Let me explain. I came all the way from Toronto to eat at two places: Park (tonight) and Le Bremner (tomorrow). I couldn't take more time off, or Liverpool House, Joe Beef and others would be on my list too. I was so excited for this dinner - I made the reservation more than two weeks in advanced, I went with my sister and her boyfriend, my treat, because I wanted to go that badly.Anyways, I went to Park on a Tuesday night. We weren't sure how hungry we were, but people who had visited before had advised that we stick to the fish, because that was what was most worth it. So that is what we did, willing to order more if we were still hungry. We started by ordering three dishes, the Nigiri, Sashimi and the Seasonal Maki. Firstly, it took almost an hour to get our first two dishes. Secondly, the nigiri was very much overwhelmed by the flavour of wasabi. Thirdly, the sushi rice in the maki was hard. I really wanted to give it a chance, but my first bite involved a really hard undercooked piece of rice.The sashimi, however, was very fresh. Although not as well sliced as I have seen/tasted before, I give the restaurant credit for the freshness of their fish. This is where the compliments end.I have eaten good sushi. I have eaten bad sushi. This was not the worst sushi I have had, by any means. However, at the price point and with all the hype, one would think it would be a great experience. I posted an instagram review, highlighting my disappointment, tagging the chef in the hopes that it would be a one off and the restaurant would learn from it. I have attached his response. Is this customer service? Is this what a professional would do? Criticize my instagram pictures of food? It's funny - he has worked with Rob Gentile of Buca in Toronto. I've been there - did he see those photos? Moreover, he claims we ordered the cheapest menu items, while we made it clear we were ordering just for the time being. We would have ordered more. Even if we had ordered the cheapest things on the menu, why should they not deliver the same standards as, say, his omakase? Anyways, I really wanted to love this place. I don't even know how to express my disappointment. Maybe my instagram message was too much, maybe I was too aggressive. Maybe I was still hungry. Whatever the reason, I apologize if I insulted the staff. I understand what a challenging industry this is, and how hard it is to hone one's skill and do well. I just didn't expect this from a professional at all, especially one as esteemed in Canada as Chef Park."

We were pretty damn disappointed though as our dinner definitely didn't live up to our experience. While the ingredients at Parks are fresh, the chef just ruined the whole omakatse experience by overdoing his dishes. We ordered the sushi omakatse menu (there are two options - one with sushi and the other without) and we were served with sushi embellished with truffle oil and different kind of sauce. The sashimi were served bathing in a pool of ""homemade sauce"".... the sauce was just too overwhelming and overpowered the taste of the sashimi. I've had much better omakatse in Toronto and other places, so sadly I'd have to say Park definitely let us down. The bill came up to 300 bucks for two people (including a cocktail per person). If the quality of the food was good, it would have been worth it. But Park tried too hard. You might see lots of photos on Instagram and people saying how good the dishes look, but trust me, it's not worth that much money. This place is so overhyped and we won't return again."

This place has a nice vibe with a direct view into the kitchen. We started with their soup of the day, a beef consommé with tofu. The soup was not bad, better than the usual miso. We then ordered the asian salad and scallops which were both very fresh. The waiter then brought out a platter of different sushi and nigiri all of which was presented elegantly. The sushi was very creative and as fresh as good sushi places in MTL. For dessert i had the date pudding which was not overly impressive for the price. I had a chance to try the lychee cocktail which was one of the better ones i have tried. Overall the meal came to $280 for 2. The sushi was not as fresh as i expected. We also came on an evening where the entire restaurant was forced to hear the inane rants of one extremely rude group of ppl to which people around us complained on many occasions, with no action from the staff. Not sure this place is worth the price there are many creative sushi joints in MTL which charge a more reasonable amount."
/user_details?userid=V0NyT2fKIs7pwFDSGqyCKQ,H L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is, as far as I know, the best sushi restaurant in Montreal. The quality of the fish is excellent and the rice is perfectly prepared. I have been to Japan and eaten at well-known establishments there (including Sukiyabashi Jiro), and I would place Park up there with the best of them. The tasting menu is the way to go here. It is  inventive---this is not a strictly traditional take on sushi, and there will be surprises, particularly in the condiment department. My only feedback would be to make the desserts more Asian-inspired. The tasting menu used to end with an interesting dessert that I seem to remember featured bean paste and granité, but on our last visit we had an intense chocolate-mousse confection that was sort of overpowering...almost like eating a massive truffle (there is a reason they are small: we could not finish it). I would love to see more fruit/bean paste/mochi flavours on the dessert menu.Overall though, the food is excellent, as is the service. One tip: we reserved online and they wanted to seat us at the cocktail bar when we got there (which is a pretty questionable move, in my books). Luckily there was a spot available outside, but if you want to ensure that you get a table, it might be better to call and specify as much."

The flavors at Park includes traditional Japanese cuisine with Korean and South American roots from Chef Antonio Park. Seafood is sustainable focused. Park has a private import seafood license that allows the freshest, line caught fish along with daily fish flown directly from Japan. The flavors are clean and includes a fusion flare.Celebrity Chef Antonio Park's restaurants Lavanderia Restaurant and new restaurant Jatoba were recently nominated in Air Canada's enRoute magazine Best New Restaurants in 2015.Option for the sushi bar. This is the most entertaining seat in the house. Watch the chef at work deconstructing a blue fin tuna. It is usually challenging to get a table reservation; so call ahead of time. We highly suggest the omakase tasting menu for $115 per person. Table service is $105. If you are still hungry, add a few addition off the menu.You won't be disappointed."

/user_details?userid=YheJrg5LWIVQpIUfGle-GQ,Sabrina L.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"I have been 4 times to this restaurant and it never ceases to impress me! First, you absolutely have to get the omakase menu which is the tasting menu including 5-6 items that the chef changes accordingly to the new arrivals.  And do get the places right in front of the sushi bar to be able to look at the crazy knife skills of Chef Park.The most unique feature of this restaurant is how chef Antonio Park goes about to get his fish as fresh as possible.  His efforts to import the fish directly from Japan while keeping it as ecologically as possible are beyond mind blowing.  He uses different techniques such as acupuncture to kill the fish to maximizing its sweetness while minimizing its suffering. His sushi and sashimi dishes are unique such that the garnishes are packed with flavors without hiding the the characteristics of each fish.  The presentation are incredibly visually appealing.Apart from fish, Park also offers meat and seafood dishes.  The short ribs are absolutely flabbergasting as its flavor is enhanced by its side dishes and oh-so-tender! The 1855 steak is aged for two years and served on himalayan salt block which not only adds to the wow! factor but also gives the surfaces of the meat this salty crust.  His desserts are also creative, colorful and deliver an array of promising flavors and texture!All in all, restaurant Park is definitely a must-try as you really cannot find any better dish fresher and tastier than his! The chef is there every single day and has such a great passion in every single dish that comes out of his kitchen!  Ah and they also offer lunch and brunch on saturday.  The restaurant is closed on sundays."

We started with a soup (read: broth with a few noodles dropped in for good measure). Taste was nice, but not memorable enough to describe it (2.5 hrs after eating it). Next came a lobster entree, sitting on some sort of mashed potato bed with corn over it. The mix of textures was fun, and it tasted above ok (say 7 on 10). Then came the nigiri. 7 types. Maybe it's a Montreal thing, but I prefer when they bring each piece on its own. Alas we got a platter of nigiri and had to pick our own order (glad we left the one with the jalapeño for last). The fish were fresh and the seasonings were unexpected. Unfortunately, the rice was undercooked: hard and dry. The rice made the entire nigiri selection drop to 6/10. The rice was so disappointing that when our waitress came to ask how the food was I had to say something. I believe my comment went along the lines of ""the fish is great but the rice is dry and hard"", to which she answered ""oh no! I will let the chef know"". That was 1.5 hrs ago, she never mentioned the rice again. She also didn't ask again how the rest of the food was.The nigiri platter was followed by a maki roll. This is most of my reason for calling this a table d'hôtel instead of an omakase... Our table of 2 got 8 pieces of one type of roll. Not exactly a 'tasting'. At least the rice was better cooked.We eventually got a dish of sashimi. It was fresh -- not special enough to stand out, in a good way or a bad way. We were then asked if we wanted to try the Uni. Hoping for a highlight of the night we went for it. The Uni was fine, the real star of the show was the truffled dwarf peach. Apparently you can find jars of this stuff for $22.We wrapped up our 2h40 meal with dessert. A cake-y thing that I can't remember 10 minutes after eating. I don't really want to remember, I just want to go home now. Oh there's the bill. $300+ for 2 people. I can't waste more time or mental effort on this place. Go to Mikado. Or drive out to Katoreya.

/user_details?userid=J-g0kAe1TOhxBplaUISwpw,Svend E.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The Good: * Much of the food is very good, best quality sushi / sashimi I've had in Montreal thus far. A bit fresher and better than Jun-I's. Some of the fish tasted, pardon the imagery, as if the chef had just killed it. * Nice ambiance. Particularly on the inside. The small terrace is okay, but occasionally punctuated by loud sounds of cars along the main streets.  * Excellent selection of uncommon sakes and beers. The Joe Beef lager (made locally at Joe Beef, presumably) was excellentThe Bad: * Somewhat overpriced. The posh location in Westmount caters to wealthy residents for whom money isn't an object, and hence price inflation. For instance, glasses of wine run $14-16-- and wine portions are small. * The menu situation and waitering service were absurd, almost on the level of a Monty Python sketch. . . There is no print menu, everything is written on three large chalkboards within the restaurant in medium-sized letters. This is all well and good, and works in certain pubs and restaurants. But given the layout of this restaurant and the size the text was printed in, this method is not particularly helpful to those who don't have great vision, or those sitting on the terrace, where we were. From the terrace, the menu inside the restaurant is either completely or partially obstructed, but in any case too far away to see. The waiter then attempts to recount verbally all the items on the relatively long menu, sans prices. (Who needs to know the prices of what they're ordering, right?) Our waitress had selective memory: she would recount only random drinks and items. After ordering appetizers based on the choices she listed, and thinking that they sounded strangely sparse, out of curiosity I got up and walked inside the restaurant to look at the menu boards (awkward, considering one is in the way of the people dining therein). Thereupon I realized that there was not just one salad, as the waitress had said, but a choice of 4 salads, not 2 sushi appetizers, as she had said, but actually 5, not 1 X, but actually 3, and so on. She had ordered my friend ""the"" salad, and when it arrived, he found out it was one of the more fancy salads on the menu. He had wanted a plain salad. When he asked why she'd put an order in for this one, and not mentioned all the available choices, she said 'That's the one most people get.'Anyway, long story short, this menu situation and selective memory on the waitress' part led to all sorts of zany mishaps. Additionally, she did not really explain any of the sauces and so on that were paired with the sushi dishes, leaving us wondering how we should eat what with what, and would disappear for long stretches at a time. In conclusion to this epic tale: Good food, decent ambiance, questionable prices, absurd service. To become the fine establishment this place aspires to be, they definitely need to work at least on the latter aspect."

It had a modern look with an open kitchen. The staff were extremely nice, professional and welcoming. Since I was dining alone, I opted to sit that sushi bar. Watching these chefs prepare the individual sushi pieces was quite amazing and it shows the care that is required when making sushi.Since I sat at the sushi bar, I had the Omakase menu for $105, which consisted of a 6 course meal, which had some of the best Nigiri I've ever had in my entire life.it started off with a organic miso soup with kimchi, seaweed and a 2 hour poached egg. The richness from the soup was cut from the pickled kimchi flavor. The poached egg added an additional texture to the soup, the yolk had slightly been cooked but still had its liquid form.Then came the Smoked arctic char with squash cream spaghetti , brown buttered pumpernickel croutons and a lemon rind puree. the idea of lemon rind puree was unexpected but delicious! The Arctic char had a slight crunch and the squash spaghetti was incredible.The Nigiri rolls were amazing, it was a great blend of Japanese cuisine with Canadian and Argentinian flavours. Each Nigiri had its own unique toppings and the each piece consisted of a different fish, i.e. There was an acupunctured Red Snapper which just melted in your mouth. Thanks to my server Tudor for taking the time to tell me what each piece was.The 4th dish was a braised lamb shank with a raisin vinaigrette, curried hummus and baked chickpeas.The lamb didn't even need the knife, I was pulling it apart with my fork. it was amazingly tender and melt in your mouth. The Vinaigrette added a great sour flavor and the chickpeas was an excellent crunch.The next course was a sashimi bowl, that had some unique pieces. Japanese Flounder, Chinook Salmon and hamachi.The last course was a black forest cake. After the incredible meal I had, the black forest cake was underwhelming. It wasn't really anything special and I was a bit disappointed.Overall, I had a great time at the restaurant and I look forward to my next visit."

We took the tasting menu which felt more like a 5-course meal rather than an actual discovery of dishes and flavours. Each course was spaced about 20-30 minutes apart (in terms of wait time). Our sashimi was half frozen due to this, since it was on ice - the bottom was inedible. Soup wasn't hot. The kitchen was just scrambling. Worst part was we were told the main was scallop and we were served duck without any explanation. The pros were that the cocktails we had at the bar were good, our waiter was extremely nice and understanding, and we were given a 25% discount. However, the amount we paid was not worth the disappointment and mistakes, and sending them an email returned no response.

A true medium sized resto. Not too big, not too small but just right - intimate yet with a little space (like we all want in our relationships, restaurants or otherwise). Chef Antonio Park and his manager Helen are rockstars and will cater to your requests. If you're at the chef's table, you are in luck! THE FOOD I had come from a 7 course tasting meal that night so honestly, I don't remember all of the food. I do know that Antonio imports all of his fish privately from Southern Japan and in the freshness, you can tell! I don't usually eat sashimi because I don't trust where it comes from but here, I'm eating it. Antonio has one of the most spotless kitchens I have ever seen anywhere. That said, I do remember the buratta with a bit of an asian take on it. Pheonemnal. Also, I remember the fish he served with truffle oil sauce and a bit of chimichurri (Park grew up in South America so you'll get some of those influences). This was all because he asked what we liked and didn't like. Truly incredible service. OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK Park yourself here again and again.

Through chef Park's Instagram I was literally looking forward to this culinary experience that we forgo to try other MANY prominent restaurants in Montreal and went to try Part restaurant.Yes, everything looks clean and you got all hyped up. I saw the price and it was really expensive. It was almost as expensive as Las Vegas Wynn hotel mizumi expensive. Really expensive!!! But I thought, it would be worth it for that price so I ordered what I always wanted to try. Nigiri moriawase: I felt rice and sashimi on top didn't communicate with each other. They suppose inseparable but I can taste rice (warm, not cold enough to be sushi rice, and mushy.... Probably because it was warm) and sashimi (I can see he tried to do something to not make it boring but it's still not enough) SEPARATELY!! Seasonal maki: what was that?!? Lol the only if there's any positiveness about this maki is the crazy big size that you probably have to break your jar for it. Japanese sushi in general, it suppose to be delicate and intricate embodied with elegance... Trust me. When you try to eat this, there is no elegance. Ladies, if you are on a date, don't order this. Apart from gigantic size, the roll was really not worth of close to $30. I rather order steak from Keg than to it this. The inside was all ""tartared"" up and there was literally nothing to chew other than their mushy rice. I couldn't feel any fish in there. Combination of ingredients? You still got a long way to make it better, chef Antonio. Sashimi moriawase: I don't know what was I thinking to order this. Oh yes, because I thought Park restaurant would be better than another place!! WRONG!! Nothing is special about it. It's just your typical sashimi platter with so predictable, obvious choice of sashimi. With two beers (around $10 each) and tax came about $140.My verdict? It was nice to finally be there and experienced it but I am definitely not going back there. Really.... Chef Antonio.... You got more studying to do.... Or maybe I have been to too many good restaurants that I don't think you were worthy of $140."

They make it with brown rice and quinoa, which is great. However, the vegetables they use are steamed instead of marinated, so they fall flat. The dish also becomes very watery since the stone is not hot enough and the egg just stays very liquid even when mixed in. Veggies are watery too. Very disappointing. Miso soup was good.Service is nice, even if a little pretentious. They charge for extra ginger, which is a little surprising for a restaurant of this caliber... But not a big deal."

The deconstructed salad is pretty good but really expensive for the ingredients that are given (you could make it yourself at home for like 10$..). Staff is usually not super nice or very attentive but they aren't the worst either."

Came all the way from Toronto to have this chance to eat at Parks's restaurant and this did not disappoint. We had the omakase dinner. Started of with a fragrant lemon grass soup. Then it was a polenta cake with nordic shrimp, crab and pickled mushroom the dish was amazing which was such a thrill to the upcoming dishes. We then had chef parks signature nigiri topped with an assortment of condiments. It changes the whole perspective of the soy sauce wasabi sushi. Chef gave us a complimentary uni hand roll with ikura, blew my mind on how fresh it was. The tenderloin for the omakase  was too beautiful to eat. A painting on a plate. The steaks flavor was out of this world. We then had a bowl of sashimi. The albacore tuna with steak spice was almost like "" meat "". The urchin 2 kinds were amazing & was so fresh. Unfortunately  the tuna wasnt that good. It was an o-toro, but wasnt ""melt in ur mouth"" Dessert was the least favourite though it looked nice, a petite pistachio cake with mango mousse and pineapple, ive had better.Over all a great place to be at.

She kept telling us this would be the final course, and bummm, five minute later we got another one. The most ridiculous thing was when she was presenting one of the dishes, she mistaken an olive for a pear. And yes, PEAR. How the hell was that even remotely possible????????And more about the food, since I know their fish supplier. There is nothing new/surprising to me on the raw ingredients they use. All it left here is the chef's skill, and how well mr.park put they together. The strongly sour sauce definitely ruined my urchin. And my salad was like someone pours 1 ton of sea salt on top of it.The only reason I gave it a 2 star is for freshness of the raw ingredients, that's all, not the skills."

The sushi is exceptional for Montreal (we are freaking far from an ocean, don't get your hopes too high up.)

It blends traditional styles with inventiveness, arriving at creations that tickle the taste buds and make you want to eat really slowly to savor each bite. Chef Antonio Park pays close attention to ingredients, coming up with new menu items based on what's seasonal and fresh. The ambiance is a bit too upscale for my taste and the prices are steep (2 omakase dinners, 2 chardonnays, 2 beers, 1 cocktail +tip/tax = $380). If the prices were more reasonable I'd eat here every week, the food is that scrumptious."

The choices at Park move beyond the realm of sushi into a whole new world of Japanese fusion. For example who wouldn't love aged black angus served on a giant slab of Himalayan rock salt? I did. It was great. I want more. You want to order sushi which you can. You will not be disappointed. Mouth watering scrumptious, flavorful morsels of rice and other goodies. Simply, angelically awesome. Best sushi I have had to date. So let's talk about service. Service is the only reason I didn't give Park 5 stars. That and the really really dark decor which makes it impossible to see what your ordering or eating and which plays into the service aspect. Let me explain. When the menu is written on a black chalkboard in a dark room there is not other option but to ask your server what is on the menu. If the server is nervous and does not know the menu well or cannot explain to you what things are made with, there is a problem. As my server you are meant to be my guide into an unchartered world. If you are visibly fumbling when questions are asked I will not be able to trust you as my guide on my culinary foodie adventure and may not feel comfortable with your suggestions. Apart from our visibly nervous server the food was off the hook awesome with a capital A. Go, eat and feel bad about the bill later."

First, as many reviewers mentioned, the wait is VERY long between servings. I waited easily 45 mins for  the appetizer. Second, the rice is not cooked well. As any sushi eater knows, rice is the most basic and the most important thing they must master. I don't know if it's the chef's fault.....but the rice was not consistent. It was sometimes too vinegary, sometimes too sweet and fell apart.  It's really easy to have the freshest fish and have the greatest quality of fish. You just have to have to buy or order the best fish possible. People think the sushi is great because the fish is ""fresh"" and melting in their mouth. I'll repeat myself, the most important and the first thing they have to master is making a good rice. That's no way you can call yourself a sushi chef if you cannot make the rice right. You might have a great knife and the freshest fish, chef Park did not impress me. I was sitting at the sushi bar in front of chef Park. I was truly disappointed that he was telling me all about the numbers of restaurants and the tv shows he was going to appear on. I have sat at many sushi bar. What an experience it is to see the humble sushi chef who has worked all his life to master the art of sushi. I do not care about the cost of my meal, as long as it worth it.  I am sorry, but the price I paid for my meal did not correspond to the quality and the details of other sushi restaurants. I wanted to mentioned that I didn't try the other Korean plates on the menu. Therefore cannot comment on them, Unfortunately, I have no intention on coming back."

/user_details?userid=zzgb9L3NBT9V8BGw_DcVYw,Belle D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Turning down Victoria from Sherbrooke Street, you'll wonder whether you've mistakenly walked all the way to NYC's West Village. Small boutiques, well-dressed people, a new rustic-chic resto... Then you'll realize you didn't - you're in Westmount, and you've found Park restaurant, the newest and most exciting addition to Montreal's dining scene.At first, you'll notice the restaurant because of its relaxed vibe, cool ""woodsy"" décor, tall plants and airy space, but you'll remember it because of the food. Every dish has a gluten-free possibility, white rice is replaced by brown rice, the beef is hormone-free and the sushi vinegar is made with local honey instead of refined sugar. That's top quality I'm willing to pay for.Although there was a delicious-sounding tasting menu, my friend and I decided to go à la carte. First we split the Asian salad ($9) - a beautiful veggie and fruit medley sprinkled with black and while sesame seeds that was so deliciously fresh that we could have ordered at least three more.Decisions, decisions... They were especially hard to make when it came to choosing mains. We finally chose to share the Chef's Choice Sushi ($22) and Beef Teriaki Don ($29). Both were f-l-a-w-l-e-s-s.The sushi was - like everything else - ridiculously fresh. It combined wonderfully unexpected tastes and melted like butter in our mouths. The beef pieces were beyond flavourful, juicy and tender, accompanied by perfectly roasted vegetables and rice.For dessert, we chose something that resembles a sponge cake with vanilla and fruit coulis. It was good, but certainly not as exceptional as the meal. Hey, no one's perfect.Park made a major splash on Montreal's dining scene when it first opened in February, and with good reason. The service isn't stellar or particularly warm, but the food is really, really good. Simple dishes come alive due to slight creative twists and luscious, fresh, organic ingredients. Some might say that portions run a little small, but really, it feels nice to finish a meal without feeling overly full.Expect a nice low-key dining experience. Park doesn't try to be a go-out resto - instead of hearing the latest Flo Rida song (the one feat. Sia is actually really good!?), you'll hear what your dining partners are saying. And sometimes, that's even better.Food 9.5/10, Atmosphere 8.5/10, Pretty people 8.5/10, Music 8.5/10, Service 7/10.Pictures: belledenuitmontreal.com/…"

However it was presented in a bowl (what??) and covered in mayo/sauces where the flavor of the urchin is gone.The Sashimi cut was wrong, and again presented in a bowl (very strange choice for a plate since you want to display the cut, the colors, the fat/meat content of the fish when dealing sashimi)on a side note, Fresh is not a good indicator for sushi restaurants, most Japanese chefs age their fatty fish (Tuna) for a few days before serving it to their customer."

It started with a bowl of miso soup with slowly poached egg, followed by a bowl of homemade soba noodles with crunchy and light tempura... Then the 3 mains came as chef's nigiri, a giant chef's maki to share which is probably the best maki that I have had in my life, and a bowl of super fresh sashimi in ponzu sauce. Finally we ended everything with a delicious banana mousse cake and mango/passion fruit sorbet. We have done omakase tasting menus before and sometimes we walked away still hungry. But here you get quantity and quality. We were very content after all the dishes. The waiters here are extremely welcoming and attentive. They actually took the time to explain each course. Amazing dining experience!"
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Trust in your ingredients. Showcase the product. My enjoyment of the TV show Top Chef Canada has made these statements stick in my head to the point where they just sound like stupid TV buzzwords now. However, there is definitely something to be said for a more restrained approach - one where things are not overdone. The freshness and unique flavours of the ingredients are allowed to shine. Restaurant Park definitely falls into this category of locale. Park is the brainchild of chef Antonio Park, formerly of Kaizen and someone I had heard many great things about. Funny enough, I'd had lunch there very shortly after the place opened and before word-of-mouth had actually developed. Fast-forward over a year later and I was back for dinner - very specifically for the Omakase, the chef's tasting menu. When one comes to Park, this was apparently the way to do it. Simply let chef Antonio and his staff work their magic.The first course was a Heirloom tomato soup with jalapeno and fried plantain chips. Now given this was a warm summer evening, the presence of a warm soup as a entree was a little odd but the flavours worked well enough. Nice sweetness of the tomatoes with the spicy of jalapeno mixed nicely. The consistency of the soup was nice and smooth all the way through. The fried chip added some crunch and the use of plantain added a little extra sweetness.The second course was a zucchini flower stuffed with veal sweetbreads and tempura fried on a bed of heirloom tomato with 12 yr old Balsamic vinegar and natural yogourt. This looked so good that I forgot to take a picture before digging in so pardon the half-eaten one below. The sweetbreads were cooked perfectly. The tomatoes and the vinegar provided some acidity to balance the fattiness of the veal. The tempura added a nice crunch as well.The next course was the Nigiri plate. This was the main event of the evening. Chef Antonio has a private fish import license so he brings over fresh, never frozen fish from places like Japan a few times a week. In some cases, the fish has been send over using Kaimin tai technique where the fish has been acupunctured to maintain a high level of freshness compared to traditional methods of killing and shipping fish. we were served 6 different kinds of fish - each on top of sushi rice and a small additional element/seasoning. The extra elements ran the gamut from a tapping leaf to chimichurri to marinated caviar to maple syrup and fresh wasabi. This was pretty much the freshest sushi I have ever eaten. Simple and elegant, there was no need for wasabi or soy sauce hence why there wasn't any of the table anyway. The fish just fell apart in your mouth and the little extra each added a unique element but without overpowering the natural flavours of each fish. This Nigiri has probably destroyed my future enjoyment of Nigiri anywhere else in Montreal so I guess I will need to stick to maki rolls outside of Park.The fourth course was fresh brown butter BC halibut on a plate of razor clams, radishes and Quebec corn. The overall technique and execution here was flawless. Beautifully fresh and flaky halibut with a wonderfully rich brown butter sauce. The combination of clams, radishes and corn add some lightness to the rich sauce. A very nice main course dish.The final course was of course dessert. Chef Antonio served us Patbingsu, a Korean dessert of shaved ice and sweetened azuki beans. The flavours of the shaved ice were cantaloup, pineapple and watermelon and that was augmented with fresh fruits and hazelnuts. For me personally, this was the least successful dish of the evening. To be fair, I am not a fan of melons (yeah I know.... let's just move on from here) so 2 of the 3 flavours didn't work for me but the whole combination of everything felt kind of flat. No real punch or ""wow"" moment. A bit of letdown to finish the meal but the rest of the menu will eliminate this dish from my memory.Omakase means ""I'll leave it to you"" which in the capable hands of chef Antonio is definitely the right call. Everything Chef Antonio presents you shows a level of respect and reverence for the product which can only be described as elegant. Technique just shines through at every level. Restaurant Park is worth a visit if only to try the Nigiri or Sashimi but I suspect you will find other dishes to enjoy as well. Park may just have driven my sushi standards up a notch but if that means I have to come back more often for sushi, that may not necessarily be a bad thing.Cheers!"

It's located in cool ol' Westmount. Came here twice for brunch & dinner and both times? AWESOME. It's on the pricier end, but you get what you pay for. For dinner I tried the tasting menu (60$) and turns out they change their tasting menu quite often. Every week I think. Anyway it was 6 course meal and boy was I full and satisfied. Some of my courses included a panna cotta (sp?) for dessert, tofu pocket, 1865 beef, salmon tuna ceviche, cauliflower soup etc Honestly, you won't be disappointed with the tasting menu, but prepare to spend at least 70-80 for that. I highly recommend ordering the sushi, I find it's their signature. So don't expect Kanda/Tokyo/Odaki kind of sushi. I'm talking high-end quality sushi here. For brunch I tried a more regular menu. I ordered a bibimbap and my friend ordered a kim chi B.L.T. I wished I ordered the kim chi B.L.T but I have a soft spot for bibimbap. I tried the other dish as well as my own and both were spectacular. The bibimbap was sweet and spicy, tasted really healthy. I believe the rice was brown and the portion size was just right.  The B.L.T was the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had in my life. Great combination with egg kimchi bacon, lettuce and tomatoes. I had a mediocre smoothie though. But that's fine, they dont specialize in smoothies anyways. I am definitely a fan and will be a regular. Highly recommend the tasting menu. Oh and make sure to reserve!PS My only complaint is the waiters/waitresses need to improve their service more for example being more knowledgeable with their food, less redundant when explaining the menu, and being more natural. I found that one of the waiters that was serving me the third time I came, to be a very unnatural and came off a bit fake."

We wanted to splurge more on the creative delicacies they advertise.  After all, we spent over $25 round trip via taxi from Olde Montreal.
