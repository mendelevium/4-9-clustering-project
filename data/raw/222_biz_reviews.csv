The fried chicken is definitely one of the best in town. I still have to try the ribs that were not available for brunch. Ambiance is cozy in this tiny place but very enjoyable. Perfect for 2 or 4. More it starts to be challenging.

This was the best poutine ever! The cheese, gravy, fries were perfect. We also got the fried chicken and that was a nice supplement too. I know they're pushing their chicken but don't sleep on the poutine. Literally thought about it everyday and wanted to get more for the drive back home but sadly they don't open until late."
/user_details?userid=1V7883W5i_F3mptabTXFIw,Sarah S.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,Came here for both brunch and another day for dinner. I like their fried chicken. I had chicken and waffles for brunch and then just the Fried chicken for dinner. there batter is a bit strong. You can sometimes taste garam masala or whole ground  black pepper in the batter and the gravy. I enjoyed their cookie and ice cream dessert.  Great coleslaw too. Small but cute space. Not too busy. Open very late so that's a plus.

Wasn't that expensive, and very filling.Went there for dinner and had the Club Sandwich and it was great! That alone, with a beer, was very filling. Their homemade hotsauce takes everything up to 11. I wanted to buy a bottle before I left. I went back for brunch and mimosas and had the friend chicken and pancakes and it was amazing. Their chicken is prepared perfectly tender with a crispy skin. The season and spices gave it a very unique flavour."

It is served with sweet cubed melons and maple syrup and gravy on the side. The fried chicken was good. I had it with maple syrup. The gravy was a bit strong for my taste (because it had garam masala) but the dish tastes great even without it."
/user_details?userid=GbDfPbqp7gKRwbn116KDSA,Ben K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I love the idea of this neighbourhood-style joint. It's somewhat inline with Dinette Triple Crown; comfort food. What should be the star of the show, the chicken and ribs, is just a couple shades on the wrong side of overdone. Despite a wonderfully crispy chicken skin and a decent sauce on the ribs, it still comes across as a couple shades on the wrong side of under seasoned. It's a bit apples-and-oranges, but just based on proximity, it's tough to compare with the beautiful Portuguese chicken offerings within a stone's throw."
/user_details?userid=uz7nIVrQ9GXM2YlZXTZI6w,Angelina D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I just ordered from Foodora. I would leave a review there, but there doesn't seem to be an option.The food here is delicious, I've ordered from here before and always enjoyed it. But I want to alert other customers about a serious imbalance, value-wise, with the fried chicken. Online it listed slow roasted chicken for $14, which comes with coleslaw, gravy, fries.. a big meal. I ordered the fried chicken just below that on the menu, listed at $15. It was just 3 boneless thigh pieces, but I figured with all the sides I'd be good.Somehow it only comes with fries. On Foodora, after tipping the driver etc, I paid $25 for my order. When my food arrived in a tiny little package I was gobsmacked.It was my own mistake of course, if I read more closely I would have seen that the extra sides don't come with the fried chicken --- but I just can't comprehend why a meal that is $1 more than the slow roasted chicken with all the sides, is so no frills. Either this resto needs to examine their pricing scheme, or all you fellow customers beware that at Paradis BBQ, the next expensive option does not equal a step up. I'm not a big eater, and I was still hungry afterwards. I'll never again order anything other than the slow roasted chicken, which is clearly this resto's main focus anyway! Tastes good though! lol"

We tried pretty much everything on the menu. Top shelf service, and straight up delicious food.This place is small, so if you're keen on intimate dinner, this is the place to go. Would recommend for dates and close friends.Exceptionally clean kitchen. Kind, and capable staff. Definitely going again."
/user_details?userid=JwWYSaemJJR1-Sba-a8_7A,Miles C.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I'm sorry to report that as somebody from Southern US - this place falls way short of serving BBQ food, which should be both comforting and absolutely delicious. Sadly, my fried chicken was both burnt and extremely salty and the fake beef stock 'gravy' is something more befitting of a late night cheap poutine than a sauce for the chicken, so it ends up just more heavy salt on top of already salty food. I kept drinking water in order to finish these. The mac and cheese here seemed satisfied to call itself mac and cheese as long as tons of cheese was draped on top, and was okay compared to the rest of the food, but very cheesy rather than super delicious and addictive. On paper the house rice sounds nice - garlic butter, peas, beans - but at the end it tastes like all of these ingredients separately, and was overall bland and dry - dry with an overall texture of 'mushy', which was interesting to say the least. This was particularly disappointing because of how easy and cheap dirty rice is to make at home - and how delicious the outcome is supposed to be. And most egregiously to a BBQ fan was the actual BBQ sauce was way too sweet and not balanced with tang and spice like the real good ones. Sorry guys, you've gotta try harder if you want me back! Interior and staff are nice, only reason for the two stars, but sadly will not be returning."
/user_details?userid=Ro00qQOG5fIrFCXMStjzrQ,Nicolas C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Nice little place, with lovely decor and welcoming staff. I had the fried chicken with a side of mac & cheese, and it was all extremely tasty: super flavourful, piping hot and cooked just right. My only real complaint is that while the food is southern in style, it's not nearly as southern when it comes to portions. I got a decent amount of fried chicken, but I wish it came with something more filling than a lacklustre coleslaw by default, like some fries or cornbread. I got the mac & cheese side to round out the meal, and I thought $7 would get me a fair bit of it, but it's just a tiny bowlful. It seems weird to spend over 20 bucks on soul food and leave still feeling a bit hungry. STILL, though: the food is great. The chicken and gravy have an awesome and really interesting seasoning to them, and the mac & cheese was one of the best I've ever had."
/user_details?userid=zV5RtkBRlCQMyufu3gjN0g,Anne N.,"Quebec City, Canada",4 star rating,The decor is really nice. The staff was really welcoming. We went there to have brunch twice and felt in love with their fried chicken and homemade sauces (bbq and spicy). The gravy with the fried chicken was not to my liking. Their hash brown is perfectly deep fried! I really enjoy their mac and cheese as well as their burrito.
