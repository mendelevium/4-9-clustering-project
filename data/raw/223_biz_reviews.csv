Very friendly and attentive service and their brunch options were varied beyond the traditional ""benedict"" options most places have (though they did have a version on their menu too). I went for eggs baked in a delicate pastry with habanero sauce and mushrooms and I can't stop thinking about it. There are also a bunch of seating options here to make sure you're far away from other parties, which I really appreciated."

We lived previously in Colorado for 10 years where we had the chance at many great Mexican restaurants. We stumbled on Alejandro while visiting the Latin Quarter. From looking on line after our lunch the restaurant is at the site of a prior Mexican restaurant ""Chipotle and Jalapeno"". However, our waiter told us that the current restaurant has been open for 2 months. It has a very fresh feeling decor and looks newly painted with an interesting and summery decor. What was far more impressive than the decor was the food. While we only tried two dishes, they were hands down the best Mexican dishes either of us have had since leaving Colorado more than 25 years ago. Our meal included both a soup and an entree, and we started with a wonderful traditional tortilla soup with a tomato broth, fresh avocado, white cheese, and chicken. We both then had a special traditional dish called ""Chile en Nogada"" that we had never seen anywhere else. It was made like a chile relleno with a poblano pepper stuffed with dried fruit, nuts, meat, and spices; but was served with a white walnut sauce and red pomegranate seeds to match the colors of the Mexican flag. This dish was simply outstanding. In addition our waiter this afternoon was outstanding."

Service was warm and welcoming, and the food, oh my the food. Have the mole poblano, or the cazuela, or the motuleños. It was all exceptional. Relatively newly opened, I hope as a frequent visitor to this city, that it does well. A great addition to this city's fantastic restaurants."
