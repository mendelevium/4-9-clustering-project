Tried:- Saag Paneer - Vegetable Korma - Butter Chicken (the two different types)- Naan Bread and rice Everything was quite good. The only thing I didn't like was the non-indian-style butter chicken, which was VERY weird. The color, texture and taste was strange. Not bad, but I didn't love it. The indian-style butter chicken was more what I expected and was good. It's not amazing or revolutionary indian cuisine, but it is good quality and tasty. I'll alternate ordering between this place and another one I found that is the same level. Still looking for a 'wow' indian restaurant in Montreal however"

I love this spot. I come here every time I'm in Montreal and I can never get enough. Best, most authentic tasting Indian food there is. Only India would have more authentic food and there is no guarantee it would be this delicious. Garlic naan and chicken Tikka masala are my go to at this place. You'll find them attached to this review. You can't go wrong with any option here. Go ahead, bust out the visa and get full. You won't regret it."

/user_details?userid=c4lTZbA8NeZBgB1YYB6Izg,Julie C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Pretty great Indian food! It's ""Upscale Indian food"" so the price point reflects that, but the service and the taste is quite on point. I've been a few times and ordered the table d'hôte every time; $45 (includes soup or salad, an appetizer, an Amin dish (meat, poultry or seafood), a veggie dish and a dessert as well as a nan bread, basmati rice and tea/coffee. It's a lot of food. If you are a group of 2, I would suggest maybe ordering only one order of table d'hôte (or they call it the ""Feast/Festin"") and add a few additional a la carte dishes.Their nan bread is to die for and I especially enjoyed the butter chicken and the lamb vindaloo. The dessert is good, but personally not my favourite. I've only been there for dinner but they do a buffet for lunch also that I've been meaning to come back to try. Value/price: 3.5/5Food/quality: 4.5/5Service: 5/5Atmosphere: 4.5/5Overall: 4/5"

The ambience is good and so much better than the other Indian restaurants that offer buffet for lunch. This was the first Indian restaurant we had a buffet from and it didn't disappoint. The tandoori chicken was my favorite. It was so good...one of the best I've had for sure. The chicken was moist and succulent and we'll marinated. Was not at all americanised and so thankful for that. It's difficult to find a good tandoori chicken because most places put color and little spices for marination. The non veg meat dishes are very limited and I found that is just one of the cons. There was just 3 non veg dishes-chicken tandoori, prawn curry and beef curry. The Staff were so courteous and nice. One of them even offered me a spicy green chutney to have with the tandoori.totally recommend this place."

Indian fine dining experience. Had the daal tadka and chana masala. Daal was very good and not too oily. Chana masala was quite dark and didn't have that light brown cream color you would normally see. Maybe chef overdid it with the garam masala proportions. Rice not included and costs extra. Chose plain naan instead and it was good. No complimentary papadum. Ended the meal with khir which was very good, not too sweet, yellow in color with fruit pieces and flavors of rose water and cardamom. All the bowls and jugs are in the nice copper style and they even have the bowls for sale."

This restaurant exceeds any expectation when it comes to that. As you walk through the doors you're greeted with a smile. As you're being seated, everyone you walk by or make eye contact with just seems to be very happy.We visited right after leaving the Canadian Grand Prix Formula One races so we were fairly hungry and thirsty.Our drinks came out pretty fast and the appetizers shortly after. The pakoras were very tasty and not oily. We were also given an assortment of sauces to go with them.For the main course we ordered the items that we would normally order whenever we go to Indian restaurants. We had the Chicken Biryani, Butter Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Vindaloo with a few naan.The Chicken Biryani was packed with flavor and the level of spiciness was perfect as to how we ordered it.The Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala were very different from what we've had in other Indian restaurants. The taste was excellent nonetheless.The Chicken Vindaloo was just perfect. This has to be one of my top 3 places where I've had Chicken Vindaloo.We enjoyed our main course so much and it finished so fast that we reordered everything except the Biryani.We had Rasmalai and Gulab Jamun for dessert.Whenever I visit again, this is a restaurant that I will definitely go back to."
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A night out in a fancier Indian cuisine experience. The service was superbe and the food as well. At first, I was worried that the food would lack the heat that I look for but I was wrong. So it's not necessarily at the same level as some restaurants in Park-Ex but it's still very good. I guess you have to keep in mind that this restaurant is in the core of DT and has to cater to a broader audience. The wine list is ok. We chose a wine in the "" last chance "" section and it was very good for 45$!"

/user_details?userid=eGRh9PYBWLpcHEO6brf0fw,Sou P.,"Buffalo, NY",4 star rating,"Le Taj was recommended to us by some friends that lives in Montreal,  so of course,  we HAD to try it!  We were staying at Loews hotel, which was only a 5 minute walk to the restaurant. When we got there at 4:55pm,  there were other people already there,  waiting for the doors to open at 5:00pm.  When it opened,  the host asked if we had reservations,  and then seated us.  Upon walking in,  I noticed how beautiful the decor was in the restaurant.  We ordered mango lassi, lamb vindaloo,  a shrimp entree,  samosa,  naan bread, papadome and safron rice. Oh and dessert,  which I believe it was called kulfi.  One thing to note is that your entrees do not come with anything so we had to order everything separately.  For example, neither rice or naan accompanied our entrees so we had to order them separately,  which was very different/new to me. Overall,  everything was VERY GOOD.  We'd give it 4 out of 5 for taste, and 5 out of 5 for the beautiful ambiance and experience."

The ambiance is oddly more chic than one might expect, but that's Montreal for you. Reservations recommended! The staff are attentive, the service impeccable. If I had one request... Gin is to India as Tequila is to Mexico. A larger selection would be most appreciated. Been coming for years. From the bespectacled, distinguished maître'D in gray tweed, to the yummy Thali are so worth the experience."

The line ups were huge because it was peak lunch time, but the food was pretty good. They have a nice spread with a good variety of vegetarian and non vegetarian food. For me, the star of the meal was the salmon tikka. It was juicy and nicely done.Ok, I understand where they are coming from and why they do it, but this pisses me off more than it should - daal isn't had like a soup. I also wish they had a paneer dish. (These two things made me put this 3.5 * place, imo, as a 3 instead of a 4 - I know, so ruthless lol)"

We had by far the worst butter chicken I have ever had, it tasted like someone had dropped the bag of sugar in the sauce as it was intensely sweet. To make matters worse their service was pretty much non-existent as our server never came to ask for drinks, plates were never cleared, we had to stack our plates on top of our dirty plates and he never came to check-in on us. I've opened and ate at Indian restaurants across the world and this has been the worst experience, I would not recommend this place to anyone due to their poor service and non-authentic food quality."

The food had to much turmeric and Curry, it was overwhelming, however it was not that spicy.  The cost was outrageous for the amount of food you got. The bar tender was very good, drinks were mixed very well, and were quick. The Nan was good, however not what I am accustomed to and appeared to be designed to force you to buy three or four baskets for a table. The best dish of the evening was the Spinach, sautéed and added chunks of cheese.The atmosphere was nice, however it was a little crowded for only having about 30 people in the place."

On the pricier side, esp. compared to my fav Curry Mahal, but I think it's worth it as an occasional treat. I just came back here to say that I had the best naan I've ever had at this restaurant. They were fresh, buttery, crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. I had the vegetable korma and it was delicious (note: rice costs extra). I would highly recommend splitting both a rice and naan order with a friend as you get best of both worlds! (And one of each order per person is a bit much). I'll return again!"
/user_details?userid=kubJ9q0g1L4IqjVCqyTtFw,Alex J.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"I went two nights in a row. Food was above average to great compared to Indian food I've had in other major cities, including London and NYC.  Not the best ever but pretty solid, enough for four stars even if the place was priced significantly higher.  However, at his price point, which is barely above what you'd pay at decent Indian takeout places, possibly lower if you get le Taj's feast, it's worth five stars.The feast is a $40 CAD that gets you a soup or salad, an appetizer, a vegetable entree, a meat entree, a big bowl of rice, a big naan, and a desert.  In other words, it's a lot of food.I suggest coming with two people and ordering one feast and then an appetizer and/or an entree to round out the meal for two.  I am a big eater and I found the feast a little too much to handle by myself but the feast is such a good value it's not worth ordering a la carte off the menu. Of course getting even more people is even better.Beef vindaloo is highlight for me.  It's not special or best ever, but it's spicy and the beef is properly tender. If you aren't into he vindaloo taste you will probably find it too spicy and may be turned off by the visible hot oil.The Dahl soup is basically lentil soup with spices and a pinch more salt than usual.  My wife found it a little salty but I thought it was fine.Chicken malai kebab was a triumph of the tandoor chef.  He meat was so tender my wife and I cute through it with our forks. It tasted pretty good if on the light side.  I ended up dipping it in sauces of other dishes hat we ordered.Seeks kebab was pleasant enough but I couldn't really taste the meat.  It reminded me of alligator sausages and really spiced but delicious street meats all over the world where he star is the spices and the meat just carries the spices.Dal makhini was kind of bland, but that could be the Dahl soup already numbed my tongue a little and I followed the dal makhini with beef vindaloo.Tava fish was perfectly cooked and he spices didn't overwhelm the fish as I thought it would.  Still, probably better to stick with chicken/beef/lamb which stands up to Indian spices better.Mixed vegetables curry was actually surprisingly good.  It's a bit light for my taste but I still found it delicious.  My wife and I both used it as sauce to change up the Tava fish and chicken and found the combination to work well.The naan was just about dead average and a little inconsistent even for the two nights I visited.  First night it was pretty much dead average on every dimension.  Second night it was thicker than usual and less oily than usual. Still, good enough for me to eat with the beef vindaloo so no complaints for me.Mango ice cream as dessert was very good.  The mango ice cream itself was closer to a sorbet and I think was homemade.  It wasn't the best mango ice cream, probably not even above average, but it's the perfect dessert after a heavy meal to cleanse the palette.Decor is really good for the price range in the area. It would be above average even in Manhattan or London compared to places charging 20-30% more.Service was fast.  Food was obviously precooked, enabling the fast service.  Don't be turned off by this.  Remember most of the stuff on the menu takes forever to cook. This isn't a place to order and then chat for hours over wine. TLDR: not the best Indian restaurant I've been to. For international traveler, it's not good enough to make a special visit unless you are craving Indian food (like I was). It is however a solid option if you want good Indian food at reasonable prices."

You can make indian food less spicy but completely flavorful. We ordered takeout that included Mushroom masala, Veg korma, tandoori roti, and vegetable pakora platter. The qty of pakoras in the platter was not good. The curries tasted fine but could've used some more effort from the chef. The rotis were not soft but not bad either. Overall, an OK place but you can eat better Indian food elsewhere."

/user_details?userid=QdRP7wn2GZsFgFfhJJmUWA,Yuzhou G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is one of the few Indian restaurants around the Mcgill downtown campus, I have to say their lunch buffet price is affordable for a student. Haven't try their dinner order yet, but looks like the menu price is higher than the average cost of Indian restaurants in Montreal. Like I usually order a Thali for around $12 after tax, but here everything is more expensive, the lunch buffet is your choice.The best naan bread I had is from Curry Mahal if anybody wants to know, but the naan here is good as well. The bread is thick and you can feel the wheat flavor from it.Tandoori chicken is good as well, especially the legs, very juicy.The lamb curry is just fine, I'm not a big fan of lamb curry but they like to include that in their buffet. And by the way, their buffet order changes but always have the tandoori chicken and naan.Little disappointed about the butter chicken, creamy source but the flavor is not enough for me. I will say it is not sweet and salty enough but have a bit more sour taste inside, taste so so with rice. But the chicken inside the source is pretty good.The salad, dessert and samosa part is just good, nothing more to say about these parts. One more thing is that since this is a buffet, the food is not very hot as many people like, but I guess this is hard to avoid. And great service all the time!Since I still have couple of years here in Montreal, this place will be my lunch choice for many times in the future."
/user_details?userid=J77nvoepKNnqTI7fsPAZ9g,Noah M.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"The ambience of this restaurant is really fun. From the candle on the table to the ostentatious menus, it gave me a classy but not taking itself too seriously vibe. I really enjoyed the chicken korma as well as the Khir and sweet doughnut desserts we had. Not to mention the delightful naan. And I would be foolish to ignore the spicy and sweet sauces they gave us to spread on our appetizers. The service was very friendly and helpful. Our server took the time to explain how the naan is made and make recommendations for us. As I said, the main dish, dessert, and the naan were really amazing, but in my opinion the two appetizers we tried were a bit lacking (onion Baji and some other dish that was mainly potato). I'd still go back to sample more of the menu!"

It's also more expensive than I typically pay for Indian food, but it's worth every penny.I typically get The Feast, where you get:*a soup or salad (I like their green salad because it comes with nuts, cheese, and mango dressing)*an appetizer (I love their samosas, but I want to try their chicken kabob next time)*a meat curry (I love their chicken korma, didn't love their chicken tikka masala, planning on trying their butter chicken, chicken jal-farezi, and chicken xacutti)*a vegetarian curry (I ADORE their baigan bhartha, which is their eggplant curry - one of my all-time favourite curries ever!!!)*naan*rice*tea*dessert (their classic cardamom & pistachio kulfi is amazing - I'd never had kulfi before and was delighted by how incredibly rich and creamy it was)You can get a thali for cheaper and get to try a bunch of dishes, but I'm not a fan of daal tarka or raita, so I always opt for the Feast combo.Whenever I go, I have to make sure that I stay super hungry all day and even then, I am always super stuffed at the end of the meal and can never finish all the food - and I can out-east most men I know. It's a ton of (very delicious) food. It's one of my Montreal staples and I will always return. Next time, I'm thinking of trying their chicken biryani."

/user_details?userid=ea3HFxRRo4gZOmlDle8IPA,Sanita M.,"Miami, FL",2 star rating,"Being an Indian cuisine fan I just had to try out this restaurant in Montreal. We came in on Friday evening when the restaurant was busy but there were still lots of nice tables available in the area next to the windows (really nice, fancy looking area). However, we were brought all the way further into the corner next to the wall, far away from windows. The hostess did not seem to be very friendly. We were in such a rush so we did not mind, and I thought that those tables must be reserved. Only later a couple next to us expressed dislike to the table and asked for a window area, the hostess was not happy but said ""Jeez, no problem!""Having sensitivity to dairy I asked the waiter if they can make some dishes without it (all the other restaurants would say ""yes""), but they told me that all dishes contain cream and can't be served without it. I asked if even Saag Paneer can't be made without it, and they explained that the sauce is already pre-made (really!?). Most places I asked this question they have no problem as they cook things and can adjust the recipe! They only offered one dish without dairy that I was not interested in.We ordered Saag Paneer, Chicken Tikka and onion naan. To our surprise the food arrived in less than 5 minutes! Seemed like they did not cook anything fresh, as even the naan was a bit cold, not crunchy, seemed like just heated up.- Saag Paneer was very watery but okay (3/5)- Chicken Tikka was extremely oily! I can't express enough how I dislike food where the oil (or butter) is swimming all around and on top, it's like you have to pure it out which I tried. Then I tried to mix in the rest of the oil in the sauce but it kept separating. Gross. The sauce was so plain, missing any tomatoes or bell pepper. Looked like Butter Chicken (2/5).So the bottom line is that our chosen dishes were pre-made, and either too oily or too watery. Definitely not a place where I would return."

I've only had Indian a couple of times and I always just get the basics like butter chicken and curry. After reading other yelp reviews I knew to ask for the tomato based butter chicken, and had to tell our server that I wanted this instead of the creamier butter chicken. Food came out extremely quick and we were hungry and were in and out within 45 minutes. Service was great as soon as we walked in the door we were greeted and brought to our table, water was brought to us immediately, our server had time to answer questions and chat and crack jokes. Portions were small and not overwhelming, which I liked but it was more expensive then I'm used to. Butter Chicken was 22 dollars not including the rice which was about 6 I believe. Great service, great food, a little expensive."

They had five or six vegetarian options on the buffet, and the meat options were good too.  Everything was really flavorful and nothing was greasy at all. Even the desserts were good, and they had a decent number of options.  I left feeling really full, but not bad about myself and not in need of a nap, which is usually an issue with Indian buffets.My only complaints are that nothing was very spicy, and the masala tea was just weak tea with spices, and you had to add creamer to it.  Service was decent, and they were good about replenishing the buffet with fresh food.  I would definitely go back."

Highly recommended.Can't say the same about Butter Chicken.It was very poor in flavor and too creamy, almost as a bowl of hot cream with orange coloring with some unspecified non essential meat dipped in it. Very easy dish yet so disappointing. this dish didn't taste as the real indian butter chicken. It was an absolute washed down orange cream dish with no spices at all. I have eaten this dish all over the world countless times and that really is far from the real deal.Absolutely not tasty at all, not fragrant at all.There was no trace taste or smell of : tomato sauce, ginger, garlic, Indian chili powder, garam masala, dried fenugreek leaves, no chicken taste or any other ingredients that were supposed to be given the dish a traditional spice and fragrance. Go for spicy dishes with lots of ingredients if you are dining here. It will come out mild anyways.Good service.Very high price as for the food we got. On average with tax you will pay 30$ per dish.

We didn't expect much but were blown away by the ambience, the service, the food, and how crazy packed this restaurant was all night. We ordered bhindi masala, dal makhni, chicken xacutti, with gulab jamun and cappuccinos to end our evening. Thank goodness for our incredible server, Arif. He kept my tastebuds from burning off - I always ask for the food to be extra spicy and he strongly cautioned me against that saying their food already has a kick to it and if I wanted additional spice afterward he'd be happy to accommodate. He was such a delight and attentive to us all evening, keeping us updated on any delays and going out of his way to make us comfortable. The food was amazing but it was really the service that made our experience. The owner was also on the floor helping his team and checking in with diners regularly."

The location was easy to find, and luckily we were able to find parking as well. It's located on a small street, which doesn't have much parking near by. The restaurant does require reservations for large groups. We had about 6 people with us as we walked in, not knowing about reservations we asked to be seated. The manager had told us he would have to see if we can be seated. At this point we were a little disappointed. But he came back with good news and seated us at a table. The menus were designed in a old fashion, which made the restaurant unique. The food was delicious and had just the right amount of spice. As a person from a Indian background, I was pleased with the food. The restaurant was clean and well maintained. I will definitely be going back when I'm in Montreal!"

We had heard wonderful things about the food and read some pretty great reviews. We were not disappointed. If anything the experience exceeded our expectations. We ordered the Table d'hote with an extra order of their Beef Vindaloo. The Table d'hote came with a soup or a salad, an appetizer, a meat dish, a vegetarian dish, dessert and all the side dishes (I.e., Naan bread, basmati rice, 4 different types of sauces). For the salad we shared the Chaat Salad which had extremely fresh chopped produce (tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, green pepper, lettuce) and topped with grilled tandoori chicken. The appetizer we shared the pan fried tilapia - fried to perfection with not a drop of oil or grease on the plate...it was golden brown and crispy on the outside and wonderfully moist on the inside. For our main dishes we had the Butter Chicken, Saag Paneer and the Beef Vindaloo. Each flavoured and seasoned wonderfully. The meat in each dish was not over cooked at all and this can sometimes be an issue when dishes are prepared in a stew-like manner. The Vindaloo was extremely spicy, but still maintained its flavour all the way throughout. The Naan bread was perhaps the bet I've ever had. It was like eating a crispy cloud with a hint of sweetness. For dessert we had the Mango Kulfi (in-house made ice cream) and the Gulab Jabun (Indian donoughts in a honey syrup). Both were well executed. The best part of the evening was probably the service. Our server was excellent. The restaurant website and on google they advertise themselves as Fine Dining Indian and it did not disappoint. The attention to service detail was impeccable, but never intrusive. The gentleman was polite, knowledgeable, helpful and pleasant to talk to. He definitely made our dining experience here a very memorable one. Bravi to all involved last night, it was a wonderful evening from all aspects. We will be back."

The cauliflower dish and potato dish I think are supposed to be separated but they taste exactly the same. Salads were not replenished and we came around 1:00. I did like the onion bhaji and the naan. Also, gulab jamun was one of the best I've had, however the rajma, the cauliflower and the potato dishes were okay but not very flavourful. The potato was not very tender and could have been cooked for longer."

The garlic naan was old and crusty instead of being warm, soft and fluffy. The shahi paneer tasted like a ketchup-cream sauce. The dal was passable but for fourteen or so dollars I could make like a dozen servings of dal ... and my dal is the best!! The papadum and chutneys and pickles were good. The chai was tasteless brown lukewarm water. The rasmalai was mediocre as well. The ambiance was alright. This is exemplary of the typical, tired and tastelessly bland subpar Subcontinental offerings we have in this city. This is colonial or postcolonial British Raj type of food; not very authentic whatsoever. Surprisingly, little Britain is not the ""motherland"" of Subcontinental cuisines. Indeed, while it may have had, once upon a time, been the seat of an exploitative Machiavellian colonial empire, wee little Britain and the British Indian food that comes out of this tiny rainy island in the North Atlantic, does not in any way reflect the vast and ancient sophistication of diverse flavours and ingredients to be enjoyed among the multitude of ethnocultural traditions and cuisines thereof in this vast subcontinent with over ten harvests annually. If you're looking for good typical North Indian fare I suggest trying Durbar on Saint-Laurent or Thali on Saint-Marc or someplace on Jean-Talon between Acadie and Parc. I also implore all lovers of food to explore South Indian and Tamil-Sri Lankan cuisine as well! Try Thanjai on Van Horne or Janani on Victoria. All the best to you and yours on this epic quest to find wonderful Subcontinental cuisine in Montréal. The truth is out there!"

We decided to grab Indian at Le Taj because it was so close to the hotel and liked it so much that we ended up there again later on our trip.I ordered lamb vindaloo (spicy), which JJ refused to touch, with a side of rice. The lamb was succulent and the vindaloo sauce was more along the lines of a ""tangy"" hot sauce than a ""so-hot-you-can't-feel-your-face,"" but I still only powered through half before I got too full. JJ had the ""Thalis,"" which was basically a tasting course and came with a great variety of dishes (with rice and naan). The buttered naan was so good that we had another order when we came back, though we stuck with a more conventional chicken tikka masala (spicy for me) this time. We both demolished the dishes and were very full when we finished up.The service was slow at times during both of the occasions we visited, and it was unusual that rice was not included in the price of the entrees.

/user_details?userid=ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,Jando S.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,"""Cuisine indienne"" as its called in these parts, was a something I was craving for badly during one of my last trips to Montreal. Already a city filled with so many ethnic options, Taj was literally the closest Indian place near our hotel. There are almost always questions for me before I head out to a new place: Is it local? Who goes there? What are the prices? How is the food? etc. Without consultation of my group due to my affinity for Indian cuisine, I immediately set forth for Le Taj and never looked back. It so happened to be during their lunch buffet hour, which at that time was priced at $12.95. Even before the clock struck noon, the place was crowded enough to warrant a wait for 4. While I waited I noticed how clean and modern the restaurant was. Some gourmet Indian establishments prefer the maharaja palatial look, where as Le Taj was simple, elegant, and sophisticated.The buffet was wonderfully presented. Everything from the serving spoon to the trays they were served in were immaculate. There was a service person on hand to wipe away any immediate spills and adjust items if they were put out of place. I thought the job was a bit tedious and unnecessary initially, but it really does make a difference for how people perceive lunch hour gluttony in buffet form.There was an amazing slew of options, with an adequate veggie to meat ratio along with some stellar desserts and sides. All of this food was presented in an open window where someone in the back was baking fresh naan (to be served table side) and dangling along a skewer was some freshly made tandoori chicken. I couldn't stop eating the fish curry here, it was perfectly flaky, the curry was rich without all the excess oil. I was also a very impressed with their lamb vindaloo, which was a little bit sweet and a lot savory, I went for seconds only moments after gobbling the first go-around. The naan was fluffy and even fragrant; a puffy bit of goodness that was a great complement to the meal. With the exception of rasmalai and burfi, I am not one for desserts, however the mini-grenade sized galub jamuns were as stellar as I've ever had.Service was quick and professional. They were attentive throughout the experience and were awesome all around. They were also armed with individual credit card machines, which made it an easy process to check out and pay without hassle.I've been back several times since and I've been quite satisfied each time. The buffet has since surged to $14.95, but with that the options have also been souped up as well. I've eaten some scrumptious veggie dishes (veggie samosa, fried cauliflower, sag paneer, aloo gobi, eggplant) and some excellent meat curries (goat biriyani, sag murgh, chicken makhani), which have all been delicious enough to give this place my blessing."

I really liked the eggplant and potato curry they had, and the cauliflower and mushroom dish. Beware that some of the vegetarian dishes may have cream in it if you don't eat dairy.

Do not let the Vegetarian, Vegan tags dissuade you if you are a meat eater. There are plenty of offerings on the menu that will easily make your food soul happy. It is nice to give a 5 star. Everything about this place was exceptional. Once you walk in, the opulence is startling, yet not ""over done"" or over the top. The staff, somehow managed to contain and satiate 8, senior corporate types that were getting a bit ""hangry"", after yet another long day. I frankly have no clue, how our waiter kept our orders straight. It would not have mattered anyways, we ended up sharing everything anyways. Which is common as we learned because one of our compatriots in our party is from Dehli. Gotta say, having him along made it that much more enjoyable because he's an Indian foodie. If I could order like that on my own, Indian food would move to the top of my favorite food list. I cannot even begin to tell you what I had to eat, besides what I specifically ordered. Which was chicken curry, and some sort of lamb shish-kabob. (I love curry so much, I think I'd probably drink it in cocktail format). So so good. Even the rice. The freaking rice!!! Was delicious. How the hell do you do that with rice? Portion sizes are about right, to slightly on the large size. 6 of us are of larger stature height wise, and every single one of us, walked out of that completely and totally satisfied. Already wanting more. On top of it all, the place is just beautiful. The menus look like they're made out of engraved silver. They are metal front and back, but obviously not real silver. I only mention that to give you an idea of how beautiful the place is. This is one of the places that I will always have to eat at when in Montreal (Deville being the other). For sheer richness and variety of flavor, it is hard to beat Le Taj. Seriously.... if you there in Montreal... Go here. Oh yea... very very good, or shall we say, fair pricing BTW. You can order family style, and I think it's around $30-40 Cad. And you can mix and match wildly. I am excited to go back to Montreal next week, and make another trip to Le Taj."

First, I loved the decor - it's very simple, with lots of brass sculptures of Hindu deities. No complaints there. The layout is good as well, with tables being spaced apart such that you don't feel like you're dining with your neighbors. The person who I assumed was the host, was not friendly or smiley. He barely acknowledged us when we arrived and when he showed us to our table. Our waiter was OK but not great. If I ask you whether or not your Shrimp Tandoori is excessively salty, you should be able to answer my question - I mean, you work there. If I'm asking about the shrimp, it's because I want shrimp - don't recommend your most common dish (butter chicken) assuming I've never had Indian cuisine before. We ordered the vegetarian plate to share as an appetizer; I must say that there wasn't much on the plate. One samosa, one onion Bhaji, one Aloo tikke to share between two people. As this was an appetizer, it's not that big a deal that the portion was that small, but I've had samosas at other restaurants that were bigger than the three appetizers combined. Just saying. That said, each item was flavorful and we enjoyed them. I ordered the Bhunna shrimp (green peppers, onions, spices, tomatoes). I wasn't crazy about the dish; there were 6 shrimp in a tomato-based sauce with LOTS of onions. The shrimp were a bit tough and chewy, and on the small side. The sauce was OK but something was missing. As a side, I ordered the Pulao rice (Basmati with onions, green peas and saffron) - I found it lacking in flavor and a bit dry. I wasn't expecting the rice to be incredibly flavorful, but I was hoping for something. Where price is concerned, the appetizer and rice were decent at $7 and $5 respectively. However, the shrimp dish was $19, and I found this to be too high for 6 small shrimp that weren't cooked properly."

And their lunch buffet is affordably priced at 16 cad for eating out in Montreal downtown. Although, I do not really like the taste of dishes they serve for the buffet. I usually prefer to order separately from their menu, as it much more tastier. Though, then your meal becomes very expensive. The service is also not above par, especially when compared to the rates they are charging. Brownie points: they have a very good wine collection."

The location is great, the reviews were good, the high prices $$$ suggest a luxurious place. Well, the reality didn't match my hopes. I mean, the location is great and the prices are surely high, but everything else was just my imagination. I will not start talking about the service but about the thing that shocked me most: all curries are 100% pre-cooked. It is basically the same concept as a food court: the food is cooked and they just plate your order upon ordering. So a $16 dish can be very well nothing else than left overs from the lunch buffet... I am not saying it is necessarily from lunch, I am saying that there is a disconnect between a full-service, ""fancy"" restaurant and heated up dishes. To top it off the food seemed extremely heavy and oily (even some food courts are better) the taste was off, and the service was mediocre at best. I will not return."

I ordered the dal makhani, the vegetable korma, and saag paneer, all medium spicy. The dal makhani was the best. The korma was the worst.

The manager/owner type who sat us refused and mumbled that it was going to be pushed together with another table for a bigger group... 5 minutes later he sat another couple in that same spot without issue.

With that being said this is my all time favourite Indian restaurant and lives up to my high standards. The restaurant is modern, clean but with Indian ornate decoration. The food is presented in traditional indian style metal bowls which is great for family style sharing.  We started with popadoms that came with four sauces/dips; tangy tamarind, cooling yoghurt, spicy mint and another that was unidentifiable to me.The restaurant had a very authentic style of cooking and the curries tasted as if they were home cooked by my mom, using very minimal amounts of oil/ghee and with perfect seasoning. We ordered the tandoori chicken, lamb saag and dhal. The chicken and lamb were both succulent.  The dhal had perfect consistency!As sides we ordered rice, roti and keema naan. In my mind the only thing that wasn't on point was the keema naan, the flavors just weren't what I was expecting and lacked depth and the decadence I normally associate with this type of bread.However, the desserts were on point! The warm gulab jaman was just sweet enough without being sickly, the freshly made rasmalai tasted creamy and milky. The perfect end to a gorgeous meal.The waiter was attentive without being overbearing, he answered questions and added suggestions.The whole experience was pleasant and reinforced that the positive experience we had the time before wasn't just an anomaly."

He gave us a choice of tables, and we chose the one by the window to the Tandoori clay oven. This was a special experience, because we could watch the chef prepare all the wonderful delicacies. We ordered a few things to share: Beef Vindaloo, Vegetarian Appetizer Platter, a coriander shrimp appetizer ( not sure of the name ) and Garlic Naan. The star of the meal was the Naan. Potently flavored with fragrant garlic and ghee, it was a delight! The Beef Vindaloo, although ""medium"" was too hot for us, but still edible with lots of rice and raita. The Vegetarian platter was very good as well, although the Aloo Tiki was a bit dry. But the Samosa and the onion fritter was perfect! The shrimp appetizer was special: Delicate flavors, perfectly cooked shrimp, and crisp greens. Delicious! The service made eating here really special. I started off with a chai before the meal came and told the server I would have my glass of Sauvignon Blanc with my meal. He waited until my tea was empty and then graciously poured my glass of wine. Very polite and attentive service! They did not rush us at all and let us enjoy every bit of the meal! For dessert we had Gulabjamun and some other cottage cheese delicacy which was delightful! Overall an amazing experience!"

I split the Valentine's Dinner for 2 menu which meant I tried a lot of food and must say it was all delicious. They made the menu all vegetarian for me easily and the service was very good as well. The sauces that come as a garnish complimented the appetizers well. Don't miss the pistachio ice cream as a dessert! It's great and helps you digest all the delicious Indian you just ate.

First of all, this place makes Ghandi in the Old Port look like a piece of shit.The ambience is very elegant but restrained at the same time - tall ceilings, wine tower in the middle of the restaurant, tablecloths, and cutaway windows to the kitchen framed in patterned metals. Beautiful! There's even a bar near the entrance you can relax at before or after eating. Service is first rate. The waiters are professional, attentive, and friendly. So polite, just like in India! Food comes out quickly and it's bloody good. We tried the lamb vindaloo (excellent), chicken xacutti (never tried it before and loved it), a few vegetarian dishes (all excellent). The dishes, on their own, are on the pricy side - the average meat, chicken, or lamb dish is around $20 or even more, but the quality and presentation is top-notch. The best bet is the table d'hote - $38 a person gets you a soup, appetizer, main, vegetable dish, dessert, and coffee. You can't finish it and have to roll out of there. Absolutely worth it.The wine list, as someone alluded to, is limited but all the staples are represented. Furthermore, it's dirt cheap. Half of them are in the low $30 range, so what's the problem? Dessert, by the way, is phenomenal. The gulab jamuns are the best I've ever tasted.A new favorite for high-end Indian - definitely the high-water mark."

The waiter took my order I asked him for a dish that wasn't on the menu (chicken madras) but he was happy to accommodate it extra spicy like I like it.  The food and service was outstanding I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for authentic Indian food.

I say ok because it was catered more to the local taste. Understandably though. After all its about running a successful business.

No one is going to eat a spicy saucy dish without rice and/or bread.  They know this, and sell them separately to make it seem as if the place isn't as expensive as it is.I had the dahl chicken (lentil chicken) which was described on the menu to be a ""healthy dish.""  However, it was positively swimming in oil, which I did not appreciate.  The flavor was good.Also, the nan came to the table so greased up that I had to send it back for a fresh and plain nan.  Then it was very good.A friend had the lamb bhuna, and there were a couple of really tough pieces in there.  The flavor was good/average.The chicken tandoori was really good and flavorful.  What I do like is that when food is ready, the cook rings a bell so that the waiters know to come pick it up so that it isn't cold when brought to the table."

I also really like their deserts! The waiters are also very friendly and polite. The second time we came, we arrived ten minutes before they closed the buffet. The waiter who welcomed us in told us we could stuff our plates and he even gave us an extra plate so that we could take as much as we wanted. This is super fun, especially since it is a really nice restaurant.

I went to Le Taj a while back before during their lunch buffet special. The place and atmosphere really won me over. They have a nice open wine celler and the place was really nice and clean. I loved how they beautifully fusioned traditional with modern decor and the ambiance just perfectly hit the notch to be okay for both a group of friends/coworkers/couples etc. The service was nice, servers attentive, prompt, and most importantly courteous. Seemed like the people running the place has a lot of skills. Anyway Everything was good I just dont know why I cant seem to giving the place a 5 star. Probably because the food wasnt as impressive. I remeber trying their nan some vegetable curry, butter chicken, and some karahi dish. I recall their butter chicken having a lot of gluten as I had only a little bit and was full immediately. Drinks are good, and the dishes edible but not memorable. Overall I'd say this place this great for nice get togethers with friends and family if you want to try Indian in a nice environment. Price definitely not overpriced. I tried buffet style but even then most of the things on the menu are well priced for restaurant in heart of downtown. You certainly wont be disappointed, so dont hesitate to drop in."

I got an individual white rice and naan bread with it. When I went to pick it up, it was $29 - that's with the 15% take-out discount. When I got back to my hotel room, I was expecting this to be the best Indian food I had ever eaten. It wasn't.I'm sorry? $30+ for one portion of flavourless butter chicken that was mediocre at best?.. Quite a rip-off.

/user_details?userid=yM9ZcAV9iAKpbeiriaodwQ,todd r.,"Hermosa Beach, CA",4 star rating,"I came here and tried the 5-course set tasting menu and was very pleased. For 36$ you chose one soup/salad, one starter, one meat dish, one veg dish, and one dessert. The menu had a dizzying array of choices so I requested the waiter to choose for me a set of dishes best representing the restaurant - with a request for spicy. The first dish was a lentil soup with a clear base and very spicy with coriander. A nice taste to set the tone for the meal, hearty and warm. I requested spicy and they obliged with this dish - which was the most spicy of any dish served. The entree was garlic shrimp. This was a miss for me. The sauce combined with the breading on the shrimp ended up being a mushy mess with a strange consistency. The shimps themselves were nicely cooked once you got through their soggy exterior The veg and meat dish were served together. The meat dish was a very nice lamb vindaloo. The lamb was tender and very flavorful. The vindaloo curry was excellently spiced and not too greasy. I do wish it was a bit more spicy though. The veg dish was another lentil based dish with saffron, coriander, and garlic. A nice combo, but the taste could use some more pop. As a pairing with the lamb vindaloo it was good, but on its own I would find it a bit bland. The waiter picked an excellent progression of dishes and the tastes went very nicely together. The service started as a bit indifferent, but warmed up over he meal with my waiter. Another waiter stood in for the dessert order and we were back to the indifference again. The decor of the restaurant is pleasing and would be a pleasant place for a group of friends or a date."

Two buffets and 2 drafts came out to be 55.00. ???? There is absolutely NO flavour in their food.  I'm not talking about hot/spicy I'm talking about the normal spices you find in all authentic Indian dishes. If you want spicy do not even WISH that you will receive anything remotely close, even if you ask for an addition. Their suggestion is a carrot/oil mix which has no spice and has the distinction of canola oil. No lime pickle, or methi on the menu. Everything from the buffet was cold.

I ordered garlic nan, samosas, and chicken curry. I've been comparing Indian restaurants as of late, and this is a go-to dish, the ""control"" if you will. The samosas were to die for. I am thinking of them still, days after the meal. The nan was brought with the rest of the meal, although we had requested it to be brought with the app. Oh well. The server suggested I order some rice for the chicken curry. Is this a thing? In the States you get the rice with the curry, not as a separate item. I was also not asked what level of spicy-ness I wanted, which again may be a cultural difference. I would have preferred a little more, as it was relatively mild. (As someone who has to explain to my American friends that Mexican food is not super spicy, this was an odd position to be in.)The curry was still good, however the chicken was too tender. I didn't think chicken could be too tender but yes, I discovered, it can. The nan was fine, but not the garlic nan I had ordered. The service was incredibly friendly and professional. It was a bit more expensive than Indian restaurants I'm used to, but the atmosphere is more upscale. If I visit Montreal again, I'd gladly go back."

/user_details?userid=ruvp5bIonK-72pGTsPPhMw,Sam S.,"Las Vegas, NV",4 star rating,"Honestly, Le Taj had some of the best food I ate all weekend in Montreal over vacation.  The service was 5 stars.  We had a few different masalas, and a chicken vindaloo along with some other vegetarian dishes. 4 stars only because we thought the wine selection was not so great.  There weren't many bottle options that were very expensive and the pinot was a Beringer which leaves a lot to be desired."
/user_details?userid=Vav-GApWFEVD5wGyKoXRVw,Johanna B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This place has a great Indian lunch buffet.  The food is quite good, but I'd only rate it average when compared against other Indian places I've been to."
/user_details?userid=QnmgtQ0ZQZZdRx18khQg2g,Jo W.,"Houston, TX",3 star rating,"We went for the lunch buffet.  Overall, it's a reasonable price at $14.95, but the food is nothing special and generally short on the spice.  The tandoori chicken was dry.  The butter chicken was pretty good but the sauce was a bit too sweet for our tastes.  Out of the three meat dishes, the curry beef was the best - could have used more curry flavor but the beef was pretty tender.  The curry mushroom and peas was good.  All the desserts were pretty good although the honey doughnut was too sweet.I'm also taking a star off for the service.  The waiters were good at timely removing used plates, but we had to ask for our drinks to be refilled.  When we paid the bill with large bills, the waiter did not return our change and presumed that the entire change was tip.  This was a huge no-no in my book."
/user_details?userid=xsiQuOZKdpDblJqBV8p6sg,Shikha B.,"Los Angeles, CA",2 star rating,"Okay, but nothing to rave about.  And, their Amritsari fish wasn't really Amritsari, nor was their chaat very good.  Also a bit too pricey for not anything special Indian food.  I'm not from Montreal, so not sure what the residents of the city have to compare it to."
/user_details?userid=BeYbrcUc1OpJCwe-l79eGA,Bill G.,"Andover, MA",4 star rating,"My first trip to Montreal, looking for good Indian food, so here it goes:This place looks good inside, I think it is expensive but the food was good.We ordered:a) Chicken Vindaloo - Excellent and the chicken was really good, it was not some kind of processed chicken. - I will give this an 8/10b) Lamb curry - Really nice, I give it a 7/10.c) Plain Nan - I haven't had this good in a big while. This deserves a 9/10 baby!             - In Concord, NH, in early 90's there was an Indian restaurant who made some real good nan, but that guy moved someplace.d) Chicken Tikka Massala - Massala (gravy) was good but the chicken was processed chicken, not tasty at all, my recommendation don't buy it.On the whole, food was good and therefore made one more visit before leaving back for USA.Note: Chicken Tikka Massala is so common in USA and I can't understand why people don't see the difference between processed chicken and real chicken!"
/user_details?userid=XqWiDEMPFDZcbF4exyre8A,Banana M.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"Definitely one of the best indian restaurants I have been too.  It was packed with people when we went last time.  The atmosphere/ambiance of the place is very comforting and the food was amazing.  We got the korma lamb and eggplant courses that came with appetizer, naan, rice and dessert.  It was delicious!  Looking forward to going back again!"
/user_details?userid=qpTjcwyawkg9QtUvbZgwmA,Armin S.,"Highlands Ranch, CO",1 star rating,"After reading all the good reviews I decided to give this place a try. WHAT WERE THESE PEOPLE SMOKING when they gave this place such good reviews? One of the worst Indian restaurants. Food was too bland and there was no flavor. Being an Indian, I know about the Indian food, especially the North Indian food and there is nothing to write home about this place. Service was poor and it took the Server a good 15 minutes after we signaled for the check, to bring us the same. Also, it seems the place is run by people from Bangladesh or some other country who have no clue about flavorful Indian food!"
/user_details?userid=uqHFMdStkBR7_3aIn6LUDg,Alba U.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Another Montreal winner.  Excellent gourmet Indian cuisine. The only thing I'd say that you should consider is that various guides designate it as in the ""$$"" two dollar sign category in terms of cost, and we definitely found it to be a bit pricier, a ""$$$""  being more appropriate-- but worth it none the less, due to fine taste, great service and welcoming ambiance."
/user_details?userid=9XUmIzlKftDvSNsQJUq07Q,Martin S.,"Wakefield, MA",4 star rating,"The appetizer samosas were fine (according to my guests), as was the vegetable korma. But the lamb vindaloo was the best I've had. I asked for it to be ""very spicy"", and it was quite hot (not the hottest - which is fine when the ingredients are so high quality). Comfortable atmosphere; very nice interior, and easy to get to - just off St. Catherine. Service was fantastic."
/user_details?userid=SHSCOFmA-o1KjwPIxWEqJA,B M.,"Dublin, Republic of Ireland",5 star rating,The Best Indian Food in Montreal and authentic to boot. I would recommend coming here for the weekend open buffet (12-2pm) pile your plate high with the 7-8 to dishes they have on offer grab a couple of slices of naan and some pekora and indulge. A la carte meals will cost you a lot more than the 12$ buffet but you get a large selection of authentic Indian dishes.

/user_details?userid=G9IuD25Dy-1auqsZLb2z6w,Chelsey R.,"Boise, ID",3 star rating,"A few fellow Indian food enthusiasts and I met up here for dinner. Being poor college students, we went simple and split samosas, two orders of chicken tikka masala, pilau rice and garlic naan. The samosas we nothing to write home about. We ordered one tikka masala spicy, and one mild and they tasted like two different dishes. The spicy one was enough to make my lips burn, but was still flavorful. The mild one was buttery and delicious. The garlic naan was well prepared and fluffy. Having tried four other Indian places so far in Montreal, this was the one I liked the most. I would say that althought the food was good, it was over-priced for the amount you got. Service was so-so."
/user_details?userid=qn2P2wyiZHtFP0zqfLZSGw,Vaishali P.,"Walnut Creek, CA",5 star rating,"Le Taj is the best Indian restaurant in Montreal downtown. They have an excellent selection during the lunch buffet. We were highly satisfied with all the dishes. Everything was freshly prepared and with the right amount of spices. Not only Indians will like it, but it will satisfy non-Indians as well. I will go back and highly recommend it. Staff is good."

/user_details?userid=BGsgs7CIvDk7FSolKuy5GA,Heidi H.,"Verdun, Canada",3 star rating,Tasty Indian food with good service. Unfortunately it is not child friendly since the clientele is mostly downtown Montreal office workers and they want to sit down and have a good quiet meal. Great for larger groups and they have small buffet available.
/user_details?userid=v9udHVQwrA807fO60H4CLg,Chaitra B.,"Brighton, MA",2 star rating,"I went to Le Taj this afternoon for lunch. I was having a not so great today and was in the  mood for some comfort food. Being an Indian, comfort food is Indian food for me. I did not have to wait too long and the lunch buffet food wise was descent overall. The malai kofta had this strange burnt milk smell and the naan was chewy. But the reason why I have given the place poor ratings is because of the service. Once I got the table it's almost like I became invisible. No one offered me water or guided me or nothing. Till the time I left I had no idea who my waiter was. I was just ignored. I really don't want to think its because of my ethnicity but it seemed like everyone around me was served on time. I was hungry so I got up and got my food and came back to the table. Still no trace of anyone asking if I wanted a drink. Asked for the check, they come with the swiping credit card machine to the table itself, swipe the card and hand it to you. I really didn't wanna pay a big tip cos I felt like I served myself but I ended up giving a 15% tip a) Because I know waiters don't earn a lot b) that was the lowest tip that machine allows you to offer. Went for the comfort food came back feeling ignored and uncomfortable."
/user_details?userid=YskXjIzH-ZUihX-zpDVQgA,Wendy H.,"East Hampstead, NH",5 star rating,"OK, the last night in Montreal we were exhausted and wanted to eat nearby.  We couldn't decide where to eat so we tried Le Taj on the theory we wouldn't eat as much- boy were we wrong.  We started with the Salad Katchumba,  which was very large so it was a good thing we split it.  I ordered the Chicken Korma and it was outstanding, as good as our favorite restaurant.  My Husband ordered the Lamb Vindaloo which was SO hot.  I tried it but it was too much for me.  My Husband, however, loves hot food and he really liked it.  I had a glass of the Pinot Grigio which paired perfectly with the spicing of the meal. For dessert I had the Halwa ""cake"".  It was nothing I expected, texture was sort of like couscous, but the flavor was outstanding.  The tab was $92 and worth every penny as the meal was outstanding."
/user_details?userid=53qjYo8wC3hYaAR9kxToNw,S C.,"Surrey, Canada",4 star rating,"Decent lunch buffet.  My Montreal contact told me it was a place for a quick & ""cheap"" lunch, so I am assuming it was a good price, but it still came up to be about double the Indian lunch buffet in Seattle.  Food was decent.  Service was slightly on the slower side, but then, it's buffet, so we didn't need a whole lot from the servers."
