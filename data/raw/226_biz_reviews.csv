It had been a little while since I last ate at Omnivore so I was pleasantly surprised to find that they'd opened other branches. This one on Mackay doesn't offer the kafta skewers which were really good and one of my favorite dishes. However, they have the Omnivore, Flexivore and Herbivore options. I ordered takeout and my order was good to go when I arrived. The boxes felt cold... Probably because of the salads. At home, I unwrapped the pitas and toasted one into a giant crispy chip. The other was eaten as a wrap. Not only are the plates a multitude of colors, the food is also a multitude of flavors. Omnivore chicken: the large grilled chicken chunks were cold but still good with the creamy garlic dip. Half the box was stuffed with the tangy fatouche salad with all sorts of veggies and garlicky toasted pita ""croutons"", there were 4 pickled turnips, giant dollops of hummus with a pocket of olive oil and sprinkled with summac melding into the garlic sauce nestled against the lentil rice. What's cool is that all the flavors blend together so it doesn't matter that the salad and sauces are touching. My only negative here is that the rice and lentils were still ""crunchy"" I prefer them cooked a little further. Flexivore beef: saucy seasoned beef was just lukewarm and also goes great with the garlic sauce. The dish is also loaded with salad and a side of lentil rice but the distinction here is that instead of pickled turnip, it's another pickle and purple cabbage. Another addition is the very smoky babaghanouj alongside the garlic sauce and hummus. Lastly, the orzo salad... We were too full to even get a spoonful but it'll keep for lunch the next day. I'll save the leftover lentil rice and cook it more the next day. If the food was warmer and the rice cooked through, I would've given 5 stars."
