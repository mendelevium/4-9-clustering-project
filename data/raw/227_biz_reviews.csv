/user_details?userid=9EeEpkZg5jV18N_KvrcT6g,Lauren L.,"Koto City, Japan",4 star rating,I got to try one of Montreal's legendary eateries that has been in business since 1912.  They don't speak much English so you may have to order in French.   But that's ok.  Just ask for two All Dressed and they'll know what you need .  This is what a French hotdog should be like.  Small wiener sausage in a small hotdog bun.  Coleslaw or cabbage and mustard.  Then steamed to perfection! Get a soft drink or water and you have a wonder snack of lunch.   There are pictures on the wall that shows the history of the place and the original one that was burned down which was across the street. So if you're into legendary fast food try it out.  I came all the way from Vancouver just to come here.  And it was worth the trip for me.  Montreal was just an added bonus .
/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I heard this place is an iconic establishment and had to try it. Unfortunately, it did not live up to its reputation. I ordered a poutine and a steamed hot dog, all dressed.The hot dog was fine. The bun was sort of getting soggy from either the hot dog or from the coleslaw that was slapped on top. Don't get me wrong, it was good. However, there are much better and cheaper alternatives to this one at other restaurant. As for the poutine, I heard such great things about it and had to try it. However, it was quite underwhelming. The fries were sitting on a metal staging area (which seemed for quite a while) before being deep fried when my order was placed. As such, they did not taste all too fresh. The poutine sauce was actually really good. It tasted authentic and really comforting. As for the cheese 'curds', they weren't that great at all. It was very stringy and was melting so quickly that it almost felt like mozzarella 'curds'. The taste of these cheese curds did not go so well with the overall taste of the poutine and honestly made it worse. Overall, the customer service was friendly and the order was prepared very quickly which was great. However, the food just didn't do it for me and I gotta unbookmark this place for good."
/user_details?userid=Henrt3UXBgJAMaM_9szKiA,Kathy N.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"Solid choice for poutine in Montreal. Everything from the fries to the cheese was perfectly balanced. The owner was even nice enough to bump me from a small to a large poutine when I was short ten cents (what a champ). My only gripe was that the sauce was almost too hot and the cheese was not tempered enough which resulted in a melted cheese mess and no squeaky cheese. Otherwise, a very nice alternative to add to your collection of poutine spots."

I got the cheeseburger and poutine and my husband got the hot dog and poutine. Sense a theme? The poutine was outrageous! So good. The burger was good enough - I ordered without pickles and it came with relish on it. I know they're not technically the same thing, but I would have liked it better without the relish. I wish I had known to order without. Now you know! My husband said the hot dog was one of the best he's had in his life. He got it fully loaded (which, as I understand, means mustard, diced onions, and relish). When we are in Montreal again, we will be returning!"

The hot dog was great - simple and satisfying. The poutine was good as well. TBH I'm not a poutine person so a good from me is great! There was some tables of four in this area and bar seating styles.  This place is also cash only.I would recommend this place for those who want good food and a good price!"

I came here late night on a Thursday after arriving in Montreal for a long weekend getaway from NYC. To have this place as the first impression of Montreal was a mistake. They don't take card and I only had US dollars. My friend and I ordered 2 poutines, 2 sodas, 2 corn dogs (pogos), and 1 chicken burger sandwich. The total came to be 26 Canadian which is about $18 American. This guy completely ripped me off and charged me $26 American, because he made up his own exchange rate. $26 for this meal was a slap in the face. The chicken sandwich was dry and tasted like bad school cafeteria food. The poutine was whatever and the corn dog was also nothing special. Won't be back, don't recommend."

/user_details?userid=JstDKWmAZsL026ADFxf7fw,Tony Kangrui L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Finally crossed off this institution on my TDL. The all-dressed steamie from here is the main pic on the ""Montreal hot dog"" Wikipedia article and it definitely doesn't disappoint. First off, the chopped cabbage is not at all salty, balancing the savory wiener and mustard. All-dressed from other places always came off as ""too much"" but this one is quite the thing. Then the bun was perfectly steamed, slightly sweet, which made the whole thing such a joy to eat (puffed up bun on the outside, soft wiener on the inside, and chopped cabbage to add some additional texture). This might be the best hot dog I ever had. I personally prefer this one over Décarie hot dog.The vibe is authentic and retro. Lots of locals from the old era talking politics and other AM channel topics over hot dogs, fries, and ketchup pooled over napkins.Historically signifiant and still relevant."

/user_details?userid=EXkM65SRwSYFe8eEjH8KPw,Kevin K.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,"Okay, so here's the deal with every city that has a soul - it always have a great hot dog variation.  DC has its half-smokes.  New York is eternally Sabretts versus Hebrew National, griddled versus sewer water style.  Chicago has their Vienna beef on a steamed poppy seed bun and dragged through the garden.  Buffalo has its Sahlens grilled up.  Detroit has their coneys, and Cincinnati has their cheese coneys.  Toronto has comically large bland weenies to complement their image.  And Montreal....?Before the casse croutes made their poutines, before the Jews bought forth the smoked meats and the bagels, and before the Montreal melon became extinct, there were Montreal hot dogs.  There's the LaFleur versus the Lester's, and the steamies versus the toasties (and to a certain extent, a Michigan dog).  So, what makes each special?  First, the dominant steamies - the buns and the dogs are steam cooked, and they come all-dressed -  mustard, chopped onions and coleslaw (not the mayonnaise one - the vinegary/lemony type).  Then there's the toasties, which are dog and bun griddled.  Michigan is similar to a Detroit coney - steamed, meat chili sauce on top, mustard, onions optional, no cabbage, ever.  Okay, now that we get the hot dog culture out of the way, it's time to ask the $64,000 question - why have it at the Montreal Pool Room?  For one, it's open from 10a to past 2a at the Quartiers de spectacles.  Chinatown restaurants usually open fairly late, as does the La Belle Province or the Boustan down the block, but then those restaurants are found all over Montreal, and there's only one pool room. You also don't get that sense of shadiness that you do with the pool room.  For two, check out the surroundings - during Habs games you will no doubt hear the broadcast on the PA in French, and when the announcer screams "" Une Goal, c'est la premiere goal pour Pacioretty ce soir"" the place erupts in collective approval, driven by the Habs paraphernalia surrounding the dining room.  If you are a Habs fan it's like being on the fifth line in mini Bell Centre.  For three, it's one of those places where you rub elbows with Montreal's various layers of humanity.  Maybe it's the Advocat who just got out of the palais de justice, or the civil servant who spent the afternoon at Complex Guy Favreau.  Or perhaps it's the perv who got out of the Cleopatra cafe, or a post-punk who were over at the Army/Navy store on St. Laurent down the block.  You can be a prince, a pauper, a tycoon or a tike.  All of them eat their steamies the same way.  I consider the Steamies at the pool room to be the metric used to evaluate others throughout the city.  Are the buns as soft and warm as the Pool Room?  Are their Lester's as juicy?  How about the slaw?  Is it a fresh crisp refreshing counterpoint?  How about their onion ratio?  The pool room has 105 years to get their hot dogs right, so what can I say?  Practice makes perfect.And finally, when you order those Steamies, don't forget to order a poutine to go with it.  Remember that a poutine should realize its namesake - a fucking mess.  You should see copious amounts of fresh fries, gravy and fresh squeaky cheese curds - they should make you feel like you just got a lap dance at a full contact club, that is, dirty, unhealthy and oh so nice.  You should have the culinary equivalent of sweaty-all-over-and-face-glazed-like-a-donut.  The poutines at the pool room should do exactly that.  If it doesn't, you showed up at the wrong hot dog joint."

I would NEVER steer my fellow Yelpers wrong and I would hate to think that most of the former reviews given were while intoxicated on a late night binge. That being said we went here twice, the first time was late Sunday night and there were 2 people in line ahead of us, we ended up leaving because they only take Canadian cash and their ATM machine was out of order. The second time I went by myself on a Tuesday at 5pm and there were only 2 people there. To be fair those 2 left before I took the picture... Anyway, I did not order the poutine, I ordered the #3 combo - 2 hot dogs, fries and a drink. 2 skinny steamed hot dogs with mustard, relish and onions (I chose no sauerkraut) mediocre at best. The fries were ok with a light crisp and the soda was cold. The place is clean and spacious so no complaints there but the food is no better than any corner store or gas station combo. I'm sorry but I would not recommend this place as one of your stops while in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=HXOfPXPMvdXNpQ_l0RRjKw,Jeffrey S.,"Midvale, UT",5 star rating,"This was, quite possibly, the most (stereotypically) Canandian thing I have ever done in my life. It had to be done. It was beautiful. It called out to be done, and I was powerless to the siren's song.That song, of course, is the sound of a steamé and a big plate of poutine. For the uninitiated (as I was) a steamé (pronounced steam-ee) is what it sounds like: a steamed food. Specifically, a steamed hot dog. For more learning on the subject, Wikipedia has a fascinating entry about the Montreal Hot Dog, which actually mentions this restaurant by name. The long and short of it is that they're steamed, typically pretty small, and pretty inexpensive. And also awesome. Get it all-dressed (mustard, onion, and finely chopped cabbage slaw) or you can opt for one of several other toppings with sauce. I seem to recall an Italian style with a tomato sauce, or Michigan-style, with a meat sauce.The other siren's song that called even more strongly, was of course, poutine. Oh, poutine. you delightful Canadian delicacy. This wasn't fancy stuff, this wasn't artisan, this was good ol' fashioned late night poutine that hits the spot. Hits. The. Spot. It was well after midnight, and I had just come from and amazing Halloween party, and this was precisely what I wanted. Fries. Cheese. Gravy. Satisfaction.There are a few other options. Get your hot dog toasted, order a burger, grab some regular fries. Or bundle things in a combo. It's not fancy inside, and what the fellas running the place lacked in overt friendliness, they made up for in proficiency. You get your food quick. Be aware that it's cash only, which makes for an even more Canadian experience, as you can walk in, order a steamé, toss the dude a toonie, and satisfy your belly (drunk or not) with a uniquely Montreal food."

This was an unfortunate way to be reintroduced to poutine and steamed hotdogs. The poutine was passable, though not great, the cheese was not fresh and didn't have the characteristic squeak I expect.

Poutine with just gravy, mozzarella cheese curds, and fries. My siblings opted for the same except with chicken and with tomato sauce. The small sizes are quite large, and the large is a platter. We did not finish our food. We noticed that the other patrons were actually just sharing the small size.

It's burgers, fries, hamburgers, all done to order, and quick. I have had all of these things done much better. Had a cheese burger and a poutine. The cheese burger dripped of grease, excessively so. To the point of guilt. If you want to experience classic diner food, please go elsewhere.

/user_details?userid=MmnPGQFG2KuTwwkYwM8e9g,Aiesha B.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"What Montreal Pool Room lacks in actual pool tables, it makes up for with tasty poutine. A couple friends and I shared 2 large poutines. We eyeballed the monstrous dishes and wondered if we could possibly finish it all. None of us were really hungry, but we were there on a mission. If you live outside of Quebec, it is not acceptable to visit the province without indulging in a proper poutine. There must be a by-law written about it somewhere... Gravy flowed over the styrofoam containers as we made a silent agreement that not one curd would go to waste. We ordered a couple sodas to wash down our feast - Cott's Black Cherry and Spruce beer. You can't get more Canadian than that.The room is essentially a dingy-looking diner and the service is not exactly top-notch, but we didn't go for the ambiance - We went to chow down. And chow down we did...First up was the chicken poutine. The gravy was piping hot with a rich flavour and thick, but even consistency. There wasn't a lot of chicken, so my friends and I became poutine pirates, trying to find the treasure lost in a sea of gravy. The chicken chunks were grilled, lightly seasoned with herbs and very tender - A great match for the classic fries and fresh, squeaky cheese curds. The meat poutine is smothered in a rich tomato and ground beef sauce. It's a bizarre fusion of a Quebecois classic with the Italian sauce your neighbour's mamma used to make. They mix a bit of ordinary gravy in as well, which gives the meat sauce a thinner consistency than expected. There is unfortunately very little going on in the way of seasoning - a bit of extra basil and oregano would've lent itself well to this dish. The cheese curds were drowning in meat sauce, but amazingly, they kept their shape and squeakiness. Overall, the chicken poutine is a winner; the Italian version needs some refinement. We left with a sense of accomplishment - Our mission was a success! Totally worth the residual shame and instant weight-gain..."

It is located in what I am told the former Red Light district, you can tell this because there is a ""Go-Go"" club across the street and a seedy/divey bars up and down the strip. It you are looking for a fancy establishment i would suggest going a couple blocks away close to the mall area. The venue is THE BEST people watching I have had in a while, I couldn't understand the french but that added to the awesomeness. I literally would just imagine the dialog, entertainment for hours. The food was greasy and good, just what I expected from a place like this. I haven't had alot of poutine so i cant really tell you how it was from a quality perspective but I liked it. This place takes cash only so remember to bring your loonies ;) Food came out fast and piping hot. All and all I love going to places like this when I travel because I get to see some of the local culture. There was a festival going on at the time so there was alot of people out and about but this place was relatively empty with in-and-out traffic. I feel like a found a little gem for downtown Montreal and cant wait to see what else this city has to offer."

Simply put, there's nothing quite like them anywhere else."

I guess it does have some character, but the food leaves something to be desired. The poutine is good, but not even close to being the best I've had. I certainly wouldn't use it as a way of introducing someone to poutine and I'm sad it was how my wife had her first poutine experience. It's what I would imagine poutine tasting like at a cafeteria. The hot dog was good, but again nothing really amazing. I was wondering why everyone seemed to be getting multiple hot dogs and it made sense once I got mine. It's tiny. If you want a simple, quick meal, then sure this place works. It won't be great unless you're drunk, but it's not bad. Would I come back though? Nope."
/user_details?userid=Z4qxqNBKv-9-rJIIPr5ldg,Mei W.,"San Diego, CA",3 star rating,"It's cheapish and quite good. I shared a toaste, steame, and small poutine with one other person. It tastes good in that unsophisticated, fast, gritty way. The poutine has a lot of gravy and the cheese curds melted more than I like them to, hence the lack of sophistication, but that's not a negative point. The toaste is slightly more expensive than the steame, but it's worth it to toast it for the flavor and texture  upgrade. The all dressed hot dogs have a nice slaw on them that elevates the meat heavy meal. I like the almost brusque service."

Don't get me wrong, I love whole in the wall food, it's the best kind, but this place was just less than mediocre.The servers were less than happy, and weren't very nice, the fries were okay, the burger was pretty simple, but slightly undercooked. We tried two different types of poutine and were less than thrilled, the quality was pretty low, and one person in our party didn't feel good after eating the food. Not sure where all these high reviews are coming in, but if I were you, I would skip this place, and keep moving, unless you are maybe drunk, high or in some other altered state.After looking at the reviews, maybe I should have tried a Steamie, or a hot dog, maybe I just did it all wrong, but my experience was less than satisfactory. Plus side, it was fairly cheap for 4 of us to grab some quick food on our trek around town, and the place was grimey for a classy New Yorker, but alright for a cool hipster if you follow my thoughts. Overall gripe: just didn't get a great vibe from the place, and the 4 star and 5 star reviews seem a bit excessive for this cheap fast food joint."

Many of them are now long gone (i.e Ben's Deli) but a handful remain, like The Orange Julep, Schwartz's Smoked Meat, and of course The Montreal Pool Room.This is the birthplace of the All-Dressed Steamie. It has changed location, they were at their former digs for almost a hundred years! Even then, it sits literally in the middle of Montreal's red-light district so if colorful characters are your thing, you've hit the jackpot here. If on the other hand, sketchy-but harmless characters freak you out too much, don't bother and go hang out at your local mall instead.Former Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa used to come here all the time for his hot dogs (the Premier of Quebec's office is in the Hydro Quebec building) which apparently Pierre Elliott Trudeau used to make fun of him for...until he started going there himself! People usually come here after a night of clubbing or drinking since it's not too far from the Gay Village and the staff here have always been super laid-back and chill."

We ordered a poutine and an onion ring which we shared between the 4 of us (the baby is 11 months, so she mostly just chewed on fries).Because our hotel was just a minute away (the Zero 1, on the corner of St Laurent and Rene-Levesque), I couldn't tell you about parking. But for walking distance, it's great! It's true what others say. This is located seconds away from strip clubs. But across the street there is another restaurant (deer garden) and not to far away is the Rolopan that we went to for our dessert. The location is fantastic if you want to walk around downtown.I don't really have much to say. I thought the food-value was quite good. We purchased pop cans at 1.55 each. Essentially, one person can eat here quite well for under 15$. That was the price we paid for everything that night. I could not have finished the onion rings and fries on my own. I actually quite liked the onion rings, they were crispy. Even my three year old liked cracking them open and slurping out the onions.Hubby liked it so much he wanted to go back for more.

They put way too much onion/chopped cabbage on the dog but  for $1.35 what is there to complain about? Also, I'm curious as to the markup. If a pack of hot dogs is about $1.00 and they're charging you $1.35 per dog how much profit are they making? Why does this feel like Grade 7 math?PS they charge $1.95 at La Traite so what is the difference in profit margins there? OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK How did I never not know what a steamie was?

Topped with a cabbage mixture, it served its purpose, semi satisfying hunger pangs while I made my 10 minute walk. Back in my hotel, I cracked open the poutine for some cheezy gooey goodness. The curds all melted into the fries and gravy. Just right. The secret to getting. It right is waiting IMO. Eating your poutine immediately you don't give the curds the chance to melt. Gravy was not overly salty, fries were just right. I was definitely a happy customer. Must visit again on my next trip to Montreal"

But on the way back to our hotel at around 11pm we both were pining for some quick food and Montreal Pool Room beckoned on our way with bright lights and a neon ""OUVERT"" sign. I was shocked to discover it wasn't even a pool room at all but your basic counter-service burger/fries/poutine joint!  YAY!We did not come away disappointed. Burgers were fantastic and perfectly cooked, poutine was the absolute best we'd ever had. Service was fairly quick and efficient but without much friendliness (pretty much what you'd expect from a late-night quick bite burger joint) It has plenty of indoor seating but we took our items to go. They have plenty of combo choices that mix in burgers or hot dogs with regular fries or with poutine. Easy ordering and fairly decent prices.

As for the taste, it was fairly standard. The cheese curds were fantastic (10/10) but the gravy seemed a little on the cold side and not the most fresh or flavorful.

I went for the steamie (steamed hot dog) after reading about this places hot dogs on a list of 12 iconic foods from Montréal.  For a little under $6, you get a hot dog, fries, and a soda.  The hot dog was surprisingly fulfilling and I think it mostly has to do with the coleslaw type mixture (I have no idea what it actually was).  The guys working there polite in a gruff kind of way.  It's a shame this place is so close to where I'm staying because I'm sure I'll be making many more visits than I should before I leave Montréal."

I had two beers at a local pub and found myself with an insane hankering for poutine at 10:00 pm (22:00 heure). We were staying at a nearby hotel and found the Pool Room on Yelp. It took us 5 min to walk there and share the 2 steamer/ poutine/ drink combo which cost us $10.25.The men manning the counter were polite, and I noticed the older one lovingly pouring on the gravy on the poutine. The poutine fries were toasty and perfect- they were neither over or under done. The curds were melty under the heat of the gravy, and we tore into those suckers and finished the side before even touching the dogs. It is a rich dish for sure, so I ended up adding cayenne and salt (I know... The gravy was salty, but I am half deer), and that made them even more addictive.The hot dogs were called steamers. They were good, but it wasn't anything over the top. The relish/ coleslaw/ onion combo was great though, and it transformed the dog.I know this sounds weird, but if I had a choice, I would add a ridiculously huge amount of the steamer toppings to the poutine.
