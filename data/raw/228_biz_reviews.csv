Their tacos are delicious and fairly priced. We ordered the Al pastor and carnitas (4 for $11). The carnitas were my favorite! The tacos were so good we decided to order another round! We tried the gringa (flour tortillas with cheese and porc) and the capenchana (flour tortilla with cheese, porc and beef). Again both were excellent!"
/user_details?userid=Ei127XW-Am6KWSYx3poVnw,George S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"When this place first opened, it was an absolute must for taco lovers, they had the BEST tacos outside of Mexico. The taco taste was super authentic, the owners were making the tacos, they were super friendly, the atmosphere was nice and it was just authentic. But now, they seem to have turned into a ""typical"" food chain restaurant, their portions are smaller, the prices have gone up and the quality of the tacos has decreased. Their tacos are still very good, but the quality is not as authentic as when they first started.Message to the owners: Bring back the human side of a taqueria, best way to be authentic and standout. (6 stars when you first opened, 4 stars today)Message to everyone: Go try them out, you wont be deceived they're still among the best taqueria places in Montreal, but if you tried them before you know it's just not the same as when they first opened."

I unfortunately got very ill and didnt feel good the day after.. something was off with the tacos de mais.. They didn't taste good to begin with.. the shell wasn't soft and tasted pretty stale and sandy as I bit into it... it was old. As I read other reviews I was convinced that this place was the real deal for authentic tacos, hmm not quite actually very far from authentic mexican tacos.. they tasted really commercialized and the tacos bread was not fresh and probably store bought 2-3 days old. the garnishing was drenched with parsley and cilantro was super overwhelming with herbs :/.. the beef Tacos oh boy :/ it was dry and bland tasteless.. I couldn't swallow it as it tasted like sand in my mouth and was not able to swallow it down my throat... I had to gulp 1L of water to wash that taco down my belly.. I don't think I finished my meal and just threw out both dishes in the poubelle :( I was very hesitant to write a review but then I reminded myself that honesty is the best policy and people should know the truth always.. I really am disappointed as I was really impressed with the little joint and the ambiance but unfortunately my food didn't sit well with me I was not feeling so good afterwards for 2 days.. Don't think I'll be back here"
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",5 star rating,"By far the best tacos is I've had in MTL. Before entering in the restaurant we were stopped by a woman of Mexican origin who stated these tacos are the real deal like her home country. Selection was plentiful and my fave were the beef followed by the pork. The flavours were just fresh, vibrant and juicy. Mexican style tacos are small and not like your North American Taco Bell style. Also they are on a corn tortilla whereas in NA I was raised on flour soft shells. Washing it down with a Mexican lemonade was spectacular option. Perfect balance of sharp citrus with a bit of fizzy. They do have different options of taco sauces to offer. Both sampled were tasty and complimented the tacos on different ways. I cannot wait to come back here again and sample more. They were that good and memorable."
/user_details?userid=bUPeHBFEINhqiKj9-k4-zA,Charles N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"What is an authentic taco? It should be simple, cheap, something that you can grab on the go, but turns out to be above all, high quality!During a recent taco crawl with some good friends, we stopped by Taco Trunp for some truly legit hand held miracles:Al Pastor - a specialty of Mexico City, based on shawarma spit-grilled meats brought by Lebanese immigrants to Mexico made with marinated pork and pineapples.Carne Asado - Grilled and sliced beef, complete with the searing flavours you would expect from Monterrey in Mexico.Here they only make tacos, and it'll stay that way as they are a true taqueria: a place where tacos are sold, just like on the streets of Mexico in a market. Will probably have to come back and try the Carnitas (pulled pork) and Veggie Monterrey (cheese and mushrooms). I'd also natural drinks, recommend the Mexican lemonade, incredibly refreshing and not too sweet.One more fun fact, TRUNP stands for: ""Taco Realmente Unico No Payasadas""... meaning a ""really unique taco, no clowning around."" Buen provencho!"
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Dropped in during a taco food binge in the area and they were by far my favorite! Beyond the hilarious name and great wall design the menu had some real delicious options.We went with tacos al pastor and they were DELICIOUS! OMG!!! They come in a set of 4 and have the perfect ratio of meat & condiments. They're stuff with the good with delicious meat, coriander and pineapples. We washed it down with the refreshing Mexican lemonade.Price tag here is just right and there's a lot of value on this menu. Service was super friendly and quick. The seating does tend to move you along with your day and that's fine. My only regret I live too far to make my visits a regular thing. You locals who live around the corner have a great option available to you. Strongly recommend."
/user_details?userid=vHeE-J3qSMl1tZfAILOgww,Ashley L.,"Longueuil, Canada",5 star rating,"So good! We had the tacos el pastor, beef and cheese and carnitas. The Mexican lemonade was perfect for the hot afternoon and the sauces were on point. The tortillas although not made in house are delicious and fresh tasting. The prices are reasonable at around 10$/4. The menu is simple and the food delivers, nothing crazy but honest and good food. I love a place with a limited menu because it really makes the food speak for itself and although small, tacos Trunp is mighty! I didn't notice any desserts or alcohol but for a quick bite for lunch this place was awesome."
/user_details?userid=rRKRIBTKW8IrkJsF53DonA,Ryan K.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is simple in that they basically have 1 thing in the menu: tacos. You can choose between corn or wheat tortillas with different meats or veggies to choose from. And when you have 1 thing on the menu, you have to do it right...and they definitely do! I really enjoyed my 4 corn beef tacos. They were authentic, fresh, and left a great taste in my mouth. Definitely would return for more."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"Aw man you gotta pass by here and say hi to Jesus and try these delicious, totally homemade tacos direct from his hometown of Monterey Mexico! Jesus is so passionate about what he does, and so excited, it's totally contagious. The vibe in here is completely welcoming and warm, everyone felt like a regular when we were here and they've only been open for a couple weeks. I'm eating veg these days so I can tell you, the Monterey Vegetarian with marinated mushrooms and crispy melts cheese is excellent, especially when slathered with the homemade avocado hot sauce. At 4 for $10 they are a perfect lunch.Apparently the smoked meat taco has nothing to do with Montréal smoked meat and everything to do with Sundays back home, so go try that and report back!!!"
/user_details?userid=OHTXFa3YQY0cB0nzHgjhRw,Yi T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Honestly I want to give 5 stars just for the name of this place.But the tacos were just as great. They have a short menu on a blackboard. Unfortunately there was no more beef when we were there so we took 2 orders of pulled pork and WOW they do not skimp on the portions. One of the best and most authentic-tasting places that I've been to in Montreal.Delicious homemade lemonade too!If only it was closer to home :(
/user_details?userid=KJIS0INMJKhBmGqFkHMc-A,Mai Lynn L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love how filled their tacos are! I went a while ago and had their al pastor tacos and it was truly amazing. Each plate comes with 4 tacos. It had the perfect ratio of pork, coriander, onions and pineapple. I have no complaints, really. We can tell that they really put their heart into making the best tacos and are very committed to their customer's satisfaction. I was accompanied by my 10-year-old brother who is rather picky and basically eat no vegetables and he really enjoyed it and hey, the truth always comes out from a children's mouth so if you don't trust me, believe him ;)"
/user_details?userid=S3KMGLJsbVMTy7-WXiIjjA,Steven O.,"Scarborough, Canada",4 star rating,"Stumbled across this gem completely by accident. Tried their Tacos al Pastor and veggie tacos - both a complete bargain at $10.50 for 4. I thought both were really good. My wife absolutely raved about the veggie tacos, saying they are the best she ever tasted. She's admittedly a mushroom lover, which helped a lot. The corn tortillas were served piping hot and tasted very fresh and homemade. Can't say enough about their salsas or corn tortilla shells. A bit surprised they sell individual flour tacos at a much higher price than their corn tortillas; probably a mistake as they didn't seem especially proud of their flour tacos either. The pork was very good, just not great. A tad dry and not overly flavourful. The pineapple added subtle fruitiness but not much. Still very good tacos compared to the average spot. Their homemade lemonade wasn't for me. Tasted like lightly flavoured Perrier. Will definitely try their beef tacos with a pop next time."

If you are looking for one of the best tacos in the city, look no further!PS: their quesadillas are kick ass too!Yummy :)"
/user_details?userid=Iu5mS8o02-RGpjJdxI0v7w,Harry K.,"Laval, Canada",3 star rating,"I was around the neighbourhood and was craving some Mexican. Whipped out my cell and whoop, this place comes up on the radar of the mixed nut app called Yelp. Sure, let's give it a try since a few reviews looked fake with generous stars and the others, well, challenging me to see for myself and decide if we're on the same page... taste wise. The place is a fast food concept, with few stools around 3-4 high tables. Clean and neat place. Ordered the beef and cheese tacos, $12.50 plus tax. There's 4 in a plastic basket and they come with two bottles of a green and hot sauce. My first few bites were without the sauce just to test the naked waters in order to have a fair taste judgment. Meh, nothing here to wow. Noted, penny-pinching amount of cheese. At this point and after being on this app for some time now, these overinflated reviews are a déjà vu. Tried the rest with the sauces and the party got off somewhere more fun now. Ok, add half a star just for them very good sauces. Conclusion, an average taste experience and once again, who knows why exactly most gave it 5 stars. Definitely overrated in my opinion. Yours to discover to sing your own song over here."

/user_details?userid=xyo1ZbHc8RpPma2pRTJHPQ,Scott D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Finally, good, cheap and super-authentic tacos in Montreal. I've eaten a lot of tacos in both Mexico and other places with top-notch Mexican food (think California), and these are the real deal.The standard salsa is not very spicy, but I asked the owner and he popped back into the kitchen to whip up something ¡piquante! They are also very friendly, as others have pointed out."
/user_details?userid=6qRaKVUVOEINVUvkE84ucw,Mike L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Not usually one to jump on a gimmick, I was forced to break my usual habits and enter this establishment out of curiosity. There's definitely never been something so punk and awesome in the neighbourhood, as well as authentic and delicious!Trunp's tacos are authentic Mexican street food in a city that, at least in the past, has been lacking in tasty Mexi-foods.Their hot sauce, service, and staff are all excellent and warrant this high rating.Everyone I know in the 'hood is melting over this experience."
/user_details?userid=ZfGjKYIOe03z6V49ClqfuA,Martin C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Amazing tacos, friendly owner, and great (homemade?) lemonade. Portions are good and the food comes out piping hot, as I like it. Several sauces in varying degrees of pain are offered as well. I'll be a regular :)"
/user_details?userid=-JSIfWqNjPZWc8bN2lhVmw,Ricardo C.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,These tacos are some of the best you can find in Montreal; I'm originally from Monterrey ( Northeast México) the food from this place taste exactly like home.
/user_details?userid=ulyLgrsR-cBK_HnI_5tkSw,Christopher V.,"México, D.F., Mexico",3 star rating,"Food is authentic and tasty, however they don't offer diet beverages in their menu. For this reason I don't think I'll be coming back (I know that sounds silly but it's the way I feel). You can order diet beverages in all Mexican restaurants in Montréal where I have eaten."
/user_details?userid=oYx98RSqz0BP3eHeBNH_Yw,Average C.,"Redmond, WA",5 star rating,"Wow! As a foreigner visiting Montreal, I was shocked to find legit Mexican street tacos here, so far from their origins and in such a plain and unremarkable location. Such a subtle hole in the wall would be common in places like San Diego, but here in the North East I just assumed I'd never find it. Yet here I am, writing a 5-star review, and telling all you Canadian-sons-o-bitches to get the fuck down to this place and eat these tacos. These are the real deal. Real Mexican, real street tacos, genuine salsas, and the exact right variety of meats from carne asada to el pastor. Skip the Poutine for just a quick second and try this instead - your stomachs will thank me (ok, not me but their kitchen)."

/user_details?userid=YGp6gWPQunP-xAp213QLDg,Adrian C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is amazing! Went here with my girlfriend and we had tacos al pastor and the boeuf effiloché barbacoa. These were super tasty and come in a basket. It comes with hot sauce and green lime sauce. We also had a cheese quesadilla that was amazing! The Jamaica Hibiscus juice is delicious, organic and made fresh on site. I've been to Mexico and this place is super authentic. And Jésus is the nicest, friendly owner you'll ever meet! I would jump over a wall just to eat these tacos. My top taco place in Montreal :)"
