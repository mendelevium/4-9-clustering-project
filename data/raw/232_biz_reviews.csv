We ate at the sneaky glass box  Michelan Star restaurant Toqué the night before and had fresh scallops with apple foam and on and on. It was ok. Not here, this was real food served in an amazing gastropub like setting, the scallops were served with ice and champagne. And it was ducking amazing (can I say that on Yelp?)We ate half the menu, lobster pizza, I can't remember what else but it was amazing. Everything showcased the food, and was careful thought out, but not over the top.We are American and during our visit there had been a major Heist of some million dollars in maple syrup. We were joking with these French guys all night about how the only problems in Canada was maple syrup being stolen. At the end of the night, the chef came out and brought us pancakes with maple syrup! It really made our honeymoon.Hope this place is the same as it once was! I was a bartender, a cook and a server at all assortment of restaurants over my years, but if you ever find yourself in Montreal, go sit at the bar and enjoy yourself. You won't regret it!"
/user_details?userid=vTsbejwscDEdA3Ao_aIQMg,Lawrie S.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is now one of my favourite restaurants, can't believe it took me so long to come here! Everything from the service, the ambiance and the food was 5 star. Book your reservation through their website that links you to open table as early as you can, the place isn't very big so it fills up quickly especially around the holidays. What I loved most about this place is that it isn't pretentious at all. Its cozy with the brick walls and the staff is very chatty and you feel comfortable right away. They are quick to offer suggestions on the menu as well, which we really needed as everything sounded delicious!We started with cocktails, they seemed small but were quite strong and well made. We continued with te tuna sashimi and the beef tartare, both of which were amazing! The tuna sashimi was dressed with tahini, two flavours that I would have never thought of putting together but wow, genius!We continued with the swordfish and the spaghetti squash, both of which blew us away. I could eat this every night for dinner and not get sick of it! Seriously, spaghetti squash doesn't sound excited but you NEED to taste this, life changing. We were satisfied at that point but ordered the Bremner pancakes to end with something sweet, they were divine!Finally note, when making the reservation they warned us that our table would need to be freed in 1.5h, however we stayed for 2h and didn't feel pressured at all!"

La Bremner came highly recommended by a friend who is a chef. I called to try to make a same day reservation but no one picked up. After multiple attempts, I decided to walk in (around 6:00pm on a Friday). They had one bar table left. It was perfect.We shared the tuna sashimi and a shrimp dish as the starter. Both were very tasty. I got the lamb neck pasta and it was delicious! The flavour was really good and the pasta was cooked perfectly. My boyfriend got the swordfish, and it was really good as well! I've never had swordfish before - it was a definitely a pleasant experience.The service was impeccable. Our server made sure our glasses were never empty. Another server at the bar also came by to ensure we were taken care of. And they spoke fluent English as well. The menu also comes in both English and French."

The service is excellent, friendly, knowledgeable, chatty but not too much. 10/10the pancakes, yep, you'll hear about it and for good reasons...you think, how good can a pancake be? right, i get it, i felt the same...but these pancakes idk, they're so delicious, you'd go back just for them. we ordered the Stripe Sea Bass and the cavatelli pasta - very well cooked!"

Beautiful location, definitely easy to miss, feels like a cozy basement. Fine wine, excellent ambiance very dark but romantic. Service was exquisite, food was delicious and with some originality. Loved the crudo, the dessert, the corn cacio I feel I could replicate at home, especially during corn season! Would definitely dine again! Take a walk around the water and check out the sweet architecture!"
/user_details?userid=K95X5oE2-fuDZHhzFOfPUw,Meghan L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I went to this restaurant with my husband and some friends from out of town. We were pretty disappointed. The night started out great. We ordered a plate of oysters and they were fantastic. I'm not sure where they were from but some of the best oysters I've ever had. But let's face it, anyone can shuck an oyster. We ordered a bunch of dishes to share, since the waiter recommended. The tuna tahini starter was fantastic but it was such a tiny portion we barely got to even taste it. The only veggies they had on menu was a $15 corn on the cob, 1 corn! prepared with a little spice and butter. We were served a small bowl of lettuce, just lettuce, with some vinaigrette for about the same price. I could whip together a better salad at home in less than two minutes. Then came the mains. We ordered a white fish, I can't remember the name right now but it was served alone on the plate. It was stressful to eat due to the large amount of bones. There was no sauce, no veggies, just a piece of bland fish. I would imagine eating something similar if I was stranded on a desert island and managed to catch a fish but had nothing to cook it with besides fire. It was tiny. The waiter should have written, ""you've been played"" on the bill. This restaurant is a joke.Full disclosure: I wrote this review three years ago but forgot to post and yelp just reminded me. Maybe the restaurant has improved since. I sure hope so."
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is one of those Montreal gems that makes this city a prime destination for foodies. Not only is the food excellent, but the nautical-themed vibe of this restaurant transports the diner from the cobblestone streets of Old Montreal to an old fishing pier. There is no sign outside the restaurant, so you have to go by the address. This ""too cool for school"" gimmick is lost on me. It adds nothing to the experience except for some brief frustration finding the place when the Uber drops you off.Back to the positive: The dark room is adorned with old wine bottles, corks, and opaque yellow glowing lights which mimic lanterns. The mood is further bolstered by a brilliant playlist of music in the background ranging from Aznavour to Elvis Costello, to the Chili Peppers.The food is on par with so many other iconic Montreal spots. Everything is exceedingly fresh, creative, and prepared with love. As a table of 3, we were able to sample equal portions of 3 starters and 3 mains. We began with a wonderful raw scallop dish served with sweet corn kernels. The combination of the sweet scallop meat and the sweet corn was perfectly matched. Moving on, we had a tuna and tahini crudo with something crispy sprinkled atop (I'd double check the menu in order to write a better review, but they don't provide one online). Again, we're talking about extremely fresh food which satisfies with every bite. We also shared an interesting bib lettuce and zucchini salad which was brought to life with a fresh yet subtle dressing.For mains, we devoured the lamb neck cavatelli which was extremely satisfying even during the warm month of August. The cavatelli is surrounded by a delicious stew of braised and shredded lamb which is so tender, it almost dissolves on contact in your mouth. Being a seafood restaurant, we had to see how they prepare a piece of fish. Their halibut is expertly prepared; flaky with a crispy and buttery crust. It is then topped with a lemon cream sauce which is dotted with little pieces of caviar. This is one rocking piece of fish! Finally, we had to order the fried chicken which is essentially three large boneless nuggets, each served with a pickle and ranch dressing. This is a perfect example of a chef throwing something fun into an otherwise elevated menu. Sometimes this move doesn't work and seemed contrived and mismatched. This chicken however was so perfectly crispy on the outside and tender inside, that you can tell that Le Bremner's standards for quality control are very high. The pickle and the ranch dressing are such simple add-ons, yet they make a world of difference in this enjoyable dish.For dessert, we had to try their spectacular pancake stack served with sweet cream and a maple-like sauce. These are essentially the greatest pancakes you will ever have. Although the concept of pancakes as a dessert after a fancy dinner is a little out of place at first glance, Le Bremner must figure that they are so good, it makes no difference to the diner. They could serve these as an appetizer and I'd wolf them down. Perfectly fluffy, sweet, and swimming in maple, these pancakes are spectacular for certain. Do not skip this dessert if you dine here.A well deserved 5 stars!"
/user_details?userid=vl8rjQpVAl-COvlmbDMQbA,Cary C.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"I owe Le Bremner a great review, we dined here for my birthday on my first visit to Montreal. You get stars just for being in Montreal, I really was enthralled with the city, the people, and the food. Le Bremner was definitely one of my high points.We were seated outside underneath charming lights and trees, on a quiet night with perfect weather. The drinks were tasty and our server was excellent. Polite, casual and welcoming, not to fussy.I was struck by the casual creativity of their dishes, the tartares and raw fishes had distinct, fresh flavors that definitely got my palate ready for more.The fish, probably one of the best preparations I've had. Basic, which is fine if its done right. Perfectly cooked, moist, flaky, great texture. Outside crust was wonderfully crisp, without being burnt. This is how I want all of my fish prepared everywhere! Please!I highly recommend this lovely establishment to those who have the chance. I want to come back, when I come back to Montreal."

Loved the vibe, it was cozy, comfortable, lively and fun. The staff was great , from the host to the bartender to the server, they were warm chatty friendly and energetic and service was on point , couldn't have asked for better. We sat at the bar , Sam served us and it was such a pleasure. He knew the dinner menu inside out, offered great suggestions, and mixed awesome drinks for us without us having to even look at a drink menu. The cocktails were perfectly balanced, unique and refreshing, very well done. This had to be some of the best service I've seen so far in Montreal , they have an awesome staff! The food was ridiculously good , everything we ordered was delicious. We started with the tuna sashimi with tahini sauce , this was so fresh and tasty , a must try ! We also had the spaghetti squash with crispy Brussel sprouts which had such great flavours that you wouldn't expect from a dish that sounds so simple. It was sweet and salty and had great texture with the crispy Brussels sprouts and nuts crumbled on it , very tasty. We also had the swordfish which was fresh , perfectly cooked and seasoned . We had the lamb neck pasta (pasta is made fresh in house and the lamb melted in our mouths), this pasta was to die for ! we were pretty full already but couldn't resist trying the pancakes , they were so fluffy and not overly sweet , the sauce around them was basically heaven on a plate. We also had espresso , also super well prepared. A little pricey but the quality of the food , portions and amazing service make it worth it ! This is honestly in my top favourite  restaurants in Montreal and I already can't wait to go back !"

/user_details?userid=WdQCQMjBBWG5fj1qCkNL_A,Gina P.,"Boca Raton, FL",5 star rating,"My friends and I were recommended to this spot from one of the bartenders at the cold room.  With no advanced reservation for a Friday night we were lucky to get in.  Le Bremner specializes in seafood but had a few items not of the sea. I decided to order half dozen oysters, the steamed clams, and scallop crudo. All of these items were appetizer sized which was fine by me. My oysters came out first with a side of fresh horseradish and a bottle of homemade hot sauce. There were 3 different kinds of oysters so the order had 2 of each. These oysters were beyonnnnnnd phenmonal. I ended up ordering a other half dozen immediately. The clams were steamed in a white wine sauce which I wanted to drink from a straw it was so amazing.  The scallop crudo was declious and had an amazing spicy sweet sauce on it. For dessert we ordered a cheesecake slice to share which was also great. It had a maple syrup type of sauce with bee pollen on it.Really great seafood spot in Old Montreal!"

Food was very good and staff listen and communicate well. We were given complimentary drinks when we said we're celebrating our anniversary. Thank you! The pancakes for dessert were such a treat.

/user_details?userid=S0DFh10Ff5vud6c45WdoUA,Elisa G.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"I loved this place three years ago when it virtually was impossible to get into. Now, still immensely popular, it has lost a star in my opinion.  The hard to find, hipster, nautical vibe remains, but the food we ate was not up to previous OMG status.  The swordfish with a 'Pekin"" glaze was salty and the sauce overpowered the slightly over cooked fish. The halibut with a caviar laced hollandaise was quite luscious, albeit a bit heavy. The crunchy, salty, oily super thin bread sticks were great and the oysters were fresh and expertly shucked.  The tuna sashimi was dressed in a sour sauce that was a good complement and covered with thin crispy shallots. Interesting combo."

The food was great. The service was even better. Mark took great care of us. He was friendly and talked with us for a while. I don't know if that's a typical Canadian thing (definitely uncommon in America) but we ended up really enjoying the whole experience. I recommend checking it out.
/user_details?userid=7WAVatHTHH6unUVqqNfkfg,Melissa C.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"My husband and I planned a last minute 2 day trip to Montreal for our 30th wedding anniversary. We managed to get reservations at 2 highly popular restaurants... one of which was Le Bremner. Earlier in the day while having cocktails at a local pub, the bartender asked what were our plans for the evening. He commented that there were plenty of restaurants to try that weren't getting the ""hype"" Le Bremner was getting. Well...Le Bremner lived up to the hype and more. My husband and I dine out ALOT. Just as important as is the food, is the hospitality. Alli our waitress was equally as delightful as the food. She passionately described her recommendations, and was attentive throughout the night while not being overbearing. We started off with fresh baked Tuscan bread, scallops crudo and the sashimi platter. Each pleasantly delicious. Second course consisted of A halibut dish and a bowl of cavatelli with lamb neck ragu. We ended the evening with a pastry of pistachio and blueberry mousse. From start to end it was all that we had hoped for and more. We will continue to raise the ""hype"" for Le Bremner... it is well deserved."

We walk in and were warmly greeted by the manager who walked us to the bar where we had reserved two seats. Thea was our server for the evening and she was super attentive and sweet and was nothing but friendly the whole night. We had the hollandaise scallops (best scallops I have ever tasted in my life, so sweet and fresh!) as well as the beef tartare, which was packed with flavour. The bartender, Andrew was very friendly and since I don't drink, he made me plenty of mocktails that were intricate and full of fun fruity flavours, but my favorite was the chamomile tea mocktail!We finished off their famous pancakes for dessert, so buttery and fluffy and the perfect finish to a delicious dinner. If you are in the Old Montreal area and would like an amazing dining experience with incredible staff (they even gave us hugs before we left) that truly makes you feel like family, please book a table at Le Bremner!"

We were running late for our reservation and the staff was super understanding. We had a large table for two, which was perfect considering how much food we ordered. Started with cocktails, bread and Quebec beans. Our server helped us chose a great and unique bottle of wine. My husband is still dreaming of the bread we had. Mains included the cavatelli and halibut. We finished off with the most delicious delicious desert I've ever had, apple cake with caramel sauce and ice cream. I will definitely be back!"
/user_details?userid=P6S7G1dex1QIhWntV_f0IQ,Cecilia D.,"West Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"The best restaurant in Montreal for us. We had a blast our last night in this city. This place is unmarked and about two or so blocks away from the hustle of touristy Old Montreal. At first, we were disappointed that the only seats avail with rezzies was the bar; but the bar is where it's at. We had Andrew making us off menu gin (for the hubs) and vodka (pour moi) drinks all night long. It was lively and the chef kept coming by to check out the action since his buddies were seated next to us. Get the oysters (by oyster shucker expert Edward--he'll also mix up a libation or two). They're fresh and the sauce they provide is good without being overpowering; the bottle of hot sauce is great too. We also got the delectable lamb hearts, shaved paper thin and perfectly seasoned. We could've eaten three plates. Then came the cavatelli with lamb neck which was so tasty with intense flavor. After, we got the whole seabream. The way this was prepared was beyond delicious. We wanted the head but apparently they stopped providing the head because of finicky eaters (NEWSFLASH! Everything we eat that's not a veggie has a head and usually they're filled with the best softest meat. Oh sigh). Finally, PANCAKES for dessert. How novel and brilliant! If we lived here, this would be ""our place"" for sure. Wonderful night, wonderful staff, excellent food and drink."
/user_details?userid=ky8harK6h7kNeL9Wp4tKSQ,B M.,"New City, NY",5 star rating,Great restaurant with very knowledgeable staff. The menu is very creative which adds to the experience. We thoroughly enjoyed the morels and asparagus dijonnaise as appetizers. For the main course we enjoyed swordfish with red & green pepper relish and squid ink pasta with lobster. All were served for sharing which allowed everyone to enjoy the dishes. Restaurant has no signage so be sure to note the address or you will walk past it.

I started with a lovely cocktail, based on staff recommendation. Definitely a great cocktail with Buffalo bourbon. The food is simply fantastic. We had the grilled octopus on baba ganouj to start. It was perfect. The other dishes just kept being perfect: Arctic char, grilled kale on spaghetti squash, fried chicken, and steamed mussels. We finished with a crepes in maple fudge. Everything was perfect, which rarely happens at any restaurant. The waitress provided very strong wine recommendations too. In sum, a top notch experience without the pretentious feeling."
/user_details?userid=EmrahJMelcioolXzG8TVng,John W.,"Miami, FL",2 star rating,"I heard this was a renowned experience worthy of the heightened expectations. Was surprised to find multiple issues that would prevent me from returning. For one, the music is too loud and the selection is mostly 90s era rap and R&B. Second, the lighting is basically non-existent. There is one (small) candle on the table, and ours went out three times and required relighting. Also, what mood are they trying to set with dim lighting yet rap music blaring like some lounge? Very odd juxtaposition. Third, the food is all over the place. It's trying to cover multiple bases yet probably can't solidly cover 2. I had the fried chicken. This is 3 pieces, deboned, served a la carte with only pickles and ranch dressing. And when I asked to exclude the pickles and ranch I was told I would have to just not eat them. The portion size was that of a appetizer yet it cost $16. Bottom line: this place is way overrated and doesn't deliver anywhere close to the hype. If you want a great meal with complementary ambiance, find another restaurant befitting of your time."

We loved their unique and eclectic music selection as well. #oldmontreal #lebremmer"
/user_details?userid=aV6m_LEsPoZLXFKI770oEA,Mike S.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,"This was probably the best restaurant experience we had on our recent trip to Montreal from the best music playlist, amazing service, great wines, excellent food.. it was all incredible.As others mentioned a little hard to find.. looks for the number 361 and red light into the basement. Once inside I really liked the coziness of the stone and wood decor. The absolutely killer background music was like they were playing my Spotify playist with artists like The Cure, the Rolling Stones and modern indie.. it gave the space a house party feel and made me feel right at home! No pretension, and everyone down to earth. They have an outside, but probably not the best option for muggy Montreal summers.The menu is inventive and ever changing - it almost seems like they don't have the same menu from week to week since they are always shaking things up, using the freshest ingredients and trying new things. Some items we had included the whole Sea Bream which was de-boned at the table, lobster risotto, a salad of heirloom tomatoes. Look for what you like and ask your server for recs because they will steer you in the right direction. Ask for some bread and butter, which is served whipped with a little salt smeared inside the bread bowl. Great wines as well! The place would be great for a small group so you can share more of the outstanding menu.Service was just perfect - water and wine glasses always filled, napkin folded when you leave the table, etc. At one point my wife dropped her napkin and didn't even notice, but the staff did and brought a new one without having to ask so perfectly attentive without being intrusive. I think I mentioned it was birthday when I made a reservation a month before - I forgot I told them, but they didn't by bringing out our dessert with a candle and wishing me a Happy Birthday. Our server was Elias, who I told at the end of the meal that I want to live here and want him to be my new best friend. He said sure, move to Canada! Haha, maybe, but more to the point I want to live inside Le Bremner!"

All three were really great. Wine list isn't too be missed either. Lots of interesting choices - we went with a Chenin Blanc and loved it. Our server helped us pick out a bottle to go with our meal and he was spot on with his rec. The service was top notch overall. We also started with cocktails which were pretty tasty.

I visited Montreal from the US for a short weekend with my boyfriend and was recommended Le Bremner by a bartender at The Coldroom (an awesome speakeasy on St Amable). Figured that we had to try it since our bartender raved about it.Started with a cocktail that was green, super aromatic, and had hints of cilantro maybe? I can't remember the name of it, but it was so good, I had two. We also started with the Tuna and Tahini which literally melts in your mouth. I don't always love raw tuna, but this was amazing.For our entrees we shared the Fried Chicken  and the Lamb Neck Cavatelli. Both were great. The Fried Chicken -- super crispy and paired so well with the ranch and side of pickles. The Lamb neck cavatelli was everything I want in a pasta dish -- al dente pasta and a delicious braised meat.We were hesitant to order dessert because we were so full, but we decided to get the Pancakes w/ Pimm's butter and sucre a la creme. These were literally the best pancakes I have ever had and they will stay on my mind for probably the next 3 months.On top of the wonderful food, the music and atmosphere was also great. Would recommend La Bremner to anyone in Montreal in a heartbeat. Hope I'll be back to visit someday. Also, hope that they still have those damn pancakes if I do"

The music was more meaningful and life made sense while enjoying this simple sample. I'm from Dallas, Texas and we know Fried Chicken... well... I thought we did, until I went to Montreal, Canada... who knew that the best fried chicken is in Canada that's populated by the French and is in Le Bremner... I feel that I was robbed... Kudos to to the chef, but Kudos to God for putting the chef in this world and that our paths crossed. When I took my first bite, I thought I was being ""Punk'ed"" by the French, because they knew I was from the south. If I could merry the fried chicken, I would... my wife knows this to be true and would help me filing the paperwork. The steak cooked with Rosemary was life changing... again, I'm from Texas and who knew that the BEST steak was in Canada... Vegas wouldn't take those odds. I took my first bite of steak and I knew I would have to give up my US passport and smuggle my fat butt here to eat more steak. I honestly saw Angels and Rainbows when I took a new bite. I would fight someone if they took my steak away....For the finally aka dessert, the chef made the Worlds BEST pancakes I've ever had with Amazing Maple syrup... if the pancakes with syrup were paired with the fried chicken it would be a ""10""... that's when the heavens open up and all the unicorns and all the rainbows have crazy Love to make babies of chicken and pancakes!!! Boom, drop the Mic... That just happened!!!Dear Diary... ""Jackpot""..."
/user_details?userid=67KONhD-Hax0eMo9HbA2SQ,Melissa M.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"This review is meant for the Management as I think it is very important for them to be aware of the errors made by their staff so that they can have some conversations about how to approach these kinds of incidents in the future.As soon as we decided to go to MTL for our little getaway, we booked a table at Le Bremner.  My husband had been there a few months ago and was wowed by the food and general vibe, and he knew it would be a place that I would enjoy.  Plus, we had previously had a wonderful food and service experience at Garde Manger.Cutting to the chase, this is what happened.We booked a table for 8:45pm.  Specifically chose a table vs. sitting at the bar because the dining area is very romantic, has great character, and also my knees can bother me sitting on a stool for too long.  Arrived at 8:45pm and was told that the folks sitting at our soon-to-be-table were just finishing up their post-dessert drinks.  We were asked if we would like to order a drink in the meantime, sure, yes please.  Five minutes later 2 seats at the bar opened up and we were asked if we would like to sit there rather than stand in the doorway while we waited.  Sure, that's a nice option.  But ALT RECO #1 - staff should have asked the folks slowly drinking at our table if they would like to finish their drinks at the bar, and move us to the table instead.30 mins later we're still waiting for our table.  Drinks are done, and though we are sitting at the bar, it is difficult to get the bartenders attention to get another drink while we wait.  When he comes over, he pours a glass of wine for my husband, and asks if we want something to snack on while we wait.  Well, we were going to order bread and oysters anyway..and it is now 9:15pm, so yes.  We each have some bread, but trying to save it because we were planning on ordering the mussels with dinner.  Another 10 minutes later, (so 40 MINS after our reservation) I see that the slow-drinkers are finally finished.  And then, aghast, I see the host who greeted us take two people who arrived after us TO OUR TABLE.  It takes another 5 minutes to flag down anyone to ask WHAT THE HECK JUST HAPPENED.  Host says, oh, I saw you were eating oysters at the bar, so assumed you were good there.  ...but ALT RECO #2 - ask the guests that you sat at the bar if they would like to continue sitting at the bar, or would they like to now sit at the table that IS FINALLY ready for them.  We say that we would still like to sit at a table, because my knees, and also because the bartender was still not paying attention to us, and because he was SINGING VERY LOUDLY.  And guys, we all know the music is loud in there to begin with, so damn, dude thought it was karaoke night.  We are told that a table is just waiting for their taxi and then we can have that table.  I kid you not when I say that this group of ppl stood BESIDE the table for another 20 minutes while we sat and waited, eating the bread we were hoping to save for our mussels, watching as they stood there and NO ONE from the restaurant asked them to kindly MOVE to the bar area, or to in front of the door...or out the door (any option would have sufficed as ALT RECO #3).  So we waited in total 1 HOUR to be seated at a table after our reservation. FUNNY MOMENT#1 - when the host finally goes to move us to our table, he picks up my husbands glass of wine and the half bottle it was poured from that was still sitting in front of us.  I told the host ""Oh, that's not our bottle"" and he says ""Well, it is now!"" and we laugh and think, oh good, that's a nice way of trying to compensate... except he didn't actually leave the half bottle of wine with us.  It was just a joke, hahaha.Seated at our table, we order immediately - spaghetti with clams, caeser salad and mussels.  I guess you won't be surprised to hear that these very simple and quick dishes then took ANOTHER 20 MINS to arrive.  ALT RECO #4 - ""hey chef, we've kind of fucked up this table, can you please put a rush on this order"".  But nope, nada.  To add insult to injury, shortly after we were seated a walk-in arrived, were sat in a moment and they got their food (spaghetti and beef cheek) within 5 MINS of ordering  FUNNY MOMENT #2, hahahaha.  We still ordered dessert because GD I love pancakes and I wanted to find the joy wherever I could in what turned out to be the longest most frustrating dining experience of my life.  They were fine, but I guess ultimately nothing was going to make up for it.Lastly, we were not compensated at all.  NOTHING.  Barely an apology, and certainly not a flapjack stack on the house.  NOTHING.ALT RECO #5 - do something to show the guests that you actually care about their experience in your restaurant, and do what you can to offset any compounded negativity.Based on all of the high ratings of this resto, I assume this was just a one-off, weird night, but please Monsieur Manager, use the above as a case study / lesson on what not to do next time."

I had THE BEST TIME here last weekend when we went up to Montreal for a weekend getaway. We only tried three of their dishes since we weren't that hungry but boy oh boy, their waiters/waitresses, the crowd, decor/mood of the restaurant and MUSIC was AMAZING. My friends and I met Vito and he was very attentive and made sure we were good with what we needed. He was nice enough to recommend a few places to check out since he knew we weren't from there. The hospitality was awesome and I would definitely come back the next time I visit Montreal. That's a promise!"

It was hidden as people say with no marking on the door.Because they were full, we were not able to get a table and sat in a bar like area overlooking other guests. We were fine with it, but I don't think the other guests liked it.We only ordered appetizers and those took a very long time to come out. We had three appetizers and ended up sitting in the restaurant for two hours mainly waiting for them. The kitchen was small and place was small so it seemed like the kitchen staff was stretched - at least that's how the slow service was explained to us. The good thing about the waiters was that they were knowledgable and gave us the information we needed about the food and what to expect with timing.Food was good, but not spectacular. I ordered tuna tartar with peppers. It tasted different than how I normally like it. I am a fan of sour flavors but this one was the natural taste of tuna with the sweet mix of the cooked pepper. Raw oysters were good and the kimchi patties were good too. Overall, the food was good. The main reasons I didn't enjoy the place as much was that it was in line with my pallet, the service was slow and from what we were told my expectations were too high."

/user_details?userid=v4zhnMe_T5gj5pYeh9k4VA,Daniel T.,"Sacramento, CA",5 star rating,"Before leaving the United States on our 10 year wedding anniversary in Montreal, my wife and I knew that we would have to pick a restaurant that would be special.  While looking on Yelp we learned that Le Bremner was owned by Chef Chuck Hughes.  This was someone we both enjoyed watching one Food Network and the Cooking Channel. So we made reservations ahead of time.When we entered the restaurant we were instantly happy with our choice.  The restaurant had the feeling of hanging out in someone's house.  A rustic and comfortable place to sit and eat, it was clear that Chuck Hughes made his style and laid back friendly attitude lead in all the design choices.  The first thing to come to the table was the house made bread.  A delicious soft sourdough that was truly incredible.  Not just that, but it was present in a way that I had never seen before.  The stunning black bowl that it was served in had a smear of butter along one side that was dusted in a delicious sea salt.  Truly the best bread I have ever eaten.  For me, I order braised lamb neck with pasta.  I am a fan of lamb, but I have never had a braised neck of any type.  The flavor that the meat had was truly incredible.  The depth of lamb flavor that was imparted from being braised on the bone was amazing.  The pasta was a delicious handmade pasta that just held on the sauce. Both tender and chewy all at the same time the pasta was a perfect match to the lamb. To go with my meal, I ordered the restaurants version of a Moscow mule.  It was not served in a copper glass, but then again it was not a Moscow mule, it was a delicious drink that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a great mule. Possibly the best part of the whole experience was the service.  The server was a very friendly man that was clearly happy to be working where he did.  He knew the menu very well and was quick to bring us whatever we needed.  At one point I drank all my water on purpose. Told my wife that it would be filled in less than a minute, and around 30 seconds later, there he was filling it up.  I always say that great service in a restaurant can be a major factor. Le Bremner has the service dialed into perfection."

Both restaurants are owned by Chef Chuck Hughes.  To be honest, I prefer Garde Manager over Le Bremner, but Le Bremner is a great restaurant.  Le Bremner is located in the basement near St. Paul St. The space is small and intimate. The space has a more laid back vibe than Garde Manger.  The service is attentive and friendly.To start, I ordered some fresh oysters that were expertly shucked. The mains were good - not excellent. The ingredients were fresh. The dishes were flavourful, but the dishes lacked that ""je ne said quoi"". It could be that I was expecting more from Chef Hughes. Overall, I would recommend Le Bremner. It is great option."

Believe it or not, it worked and it was amazing.  It also came with fish eggs and it was just so delectable.Also go the tuna tahini which I think was the most complex and flavorful out of all our dishes.For entrees, he went with the fried chicken which I thought was a bland choice but turned out to be so so good.  I went with the halibut, which was also very good but not really a stunner.  I appreciated that the dishes were presented very simply but were just a joy to eat.  Wait staff were so friendly and attentive - the host mentioned the possibility of opening one up in Boston which would be super exciting!Definitely worth a visit!PS - we got last minute reservations using the DINR app!"
/user_details?userid=Hib9c10vUQWvNpmysW_c0A,Victoria X.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",5 star rating,"In summary: simply outstanding night at the Bremner! The night actually started with a hiccup as we had to wait 20 mins past our reservation time to be seated and then some more for our waiter to come tend to us. However, once he did and greeted us with a 'welcome to the bremner' the night sailed oh-so smoothly from there on. The wine list: great wine list for every price point (40-1000$ bottles) as well as a short but very well diversified wine by the glass options.We ordered based on many Yelp reviews and started off with fresh scallops from les îles de la Madeleine. This was the first time we had scallops still in their shell; really fresh, super well cleaned and surprisingly very meatly in consistency.   Then came the appetizers which consisted of fried quail and lamb heart in celeriac remoulade. The fried quail was delicious! The batter was perfectly seasoned with some heat and so crunchy! Think the best fried chicken you've ever had but better since it's quail which is a more tender meat. The lamb neck was surprisingly good. My partner's favorite dish of the night. Didn't taste gamy at all and sliced so thinly that you don't get the usual pasty taste of heart. It paired perfectly with the mustard seed dressed celeriac remoulade it came with.For mains, we opted for the lamb neck cavatelli and the whole sea bream. Again, both outstanding dishes but the sea bream was the bigger star out of the two. Just a delight to filet yourself and work a bit for each bite of perfectly seasoned and cooked fish. After all this, we were so stuffed that we had no room for dessert. We have to make a special mention to our waiter, Nate who provided us with such an amazing service that we had forgotten all about out initial wait delay. Yes it was expensive (100$ pp without tip), but this was a good example of 'you get what you pay for.' From its eclectic decor to its outstanding service and food (even the music was an awesome mix of 90's rock which then turned into 90's R&B later in the night) this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a while!"

My boyfriend brought me here for our first anniversary and I absolutely loved it. First, the ambiance is exactly what you would expect for a date. Tucked in the semi-basement in the Old Port with no signs, the inside of the restaurant is warm and inviting with dim lights, art work, old wine bottles, etc. The service was impeccable, our waiter knew the food and the menu inside out and he deeply believed in it. Every suggesting was on point, we both loved him. We got two appetizers and two mains as well as wine and bubbly and the best pancakes in town. The salmon sashimi was fresh and delicately seasoned so that the flavour of the fish shined. The lobster served with chips was a bit too salty for our taste (mostly due to the salt on the chips). My favourite dish was definitely the grilled seabeam, the flavour of the grill was so strong and the fish so delicate and flaky. My boyfriend on the other hand raved about the halibut maple chowder saying how much layers of flavours it had.We finished off the meal with the best pancakes we've ever tasted! They literally melt in your mouth."

We also ordered a salmon sashimi appetizer and some specialty drinks.This is definitely a fancier restaurant than most, so prepare to spend a good amount of money for the quality of the dishes.

/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",5 star rating,"Outstanding is my simple summary of how good was our dinner at Bremner! I feel that I have to start with the service as it was extremely attentive and professional, just perfect. We were a group of nine, big crowd to take care of, but my wine glass was never empty, always filled on time. Besides perfect knowledge of the menu our hostess demonstrated amazing skills in replacing quickly a table cloth soaking in wine. The food was great! We started the night with dozen of oysters from the Maritimes, which were delicious. Although this was enough for appetizer the menu temptation was so strong that we ended up sharing the fried quail that I would eat right now if somebody brings me a piece as it was yummy. My main was the arctic char, served with white beans and almonds, and other good ingredients that will make it a perfect meal. It doesn't look like a huge piece of fish, but it is really filling. The other dish I tried and seriously loved was the home made lamb cavatelli, very good choice for pasta lovers. The chef will prepare for you a vegetarian version of the cavatelli if needed. I'm truly impressed with how good the faux fillet from Colorado looks and so was one of our friends who ordered it with its taste, and quality. The dessert choice was strongly influenced by the multiple reviews we read, we had to have the pancakes, and yes, it was worthy. The grand finale was a piece of chocolate sweet, which was perfect and went so well with the digestif, Amaro recommended by our hostess. Talking about drinks, the wine list is solid and cocktails are original. My martini was a little bit disappointing as it came in a regular whiskey glass and initially tasted distilled water. As a compensation the bar tender fixed a delicious Manhattan for my sweet heart. Bremner is cozy, the music is nice, the food is more then good and this is why I would be back!!!"

We love eating at everything from locals-only hole in the walls to street vendors to Michelin-starred restaurants - so long as it's good food done well.We were off to a bad start when we arrived early for our reservation but weren't greeted by the host while she was fiddling with the computer. It wasn't busy, so there was no reason to make us stand there. We were seated at a 2-top with white tablecloths and napkins - more formal than we expected. However some tables were booths with wooden tops, and there was exposed bricks and antlers on the wall, but also the A/C units were covered in skateboarding stickers. Music went from oldies to classic rock to hip hop - all over the place. It felt like an identity crisis.The waitress seemed nice enough at first, offered us water, and asked if we'd like a drink while we looked at the menus, and said she would be back to explain the menu from top to bottom. We ordered cocktails and started to try and decipher the menu.Okay, so it's fun when a description is just a list of the ingredients, but just called something ""Lettuce"" doesn't give you a real idea what it is or make you want to order it (it was a mixed greens salad from a local farm BTW...for like $15)The server walked us through the menu, explaining it was meant for sharing, and recommending a few options. We had the bread ($6) and warm olives ($7). We decided to go with a few starters (at $15-25 each) and then would see how hungry we were before deciding how many mains to order. While we understand that it can be more challenging for the kitchen this way, our server insisted we order our mains immediately.She checked on us a lot and kind of hovered, making us feel like we were rushed. All while there were empty tables around us.When the starters arrived, we made a comment about taking our time, and she seemed to hover less from then on.So let's get to the food:- Bread: Came in 2 large slices in halves in a bowl, with salted butter smeared on the inside of the bowl for scooping up. Was delicious and kind of a fun way to serve it. Felt a little pricey at $6, but there it is.- Olives: Warmed up with oil and herbs, also yummy, but just on a single white side plate. Here starts the boring plating. Though we did receive a small metal pot/dish/flower pot to put our pits in?- Scallops with corn, chicken skin, caviar: Raw dish, scallops were chopped and mixed, almost like a ceviche or a tartare. It was served in a circle, like a tartare, also on a boring white side plate. Nothing pops like white one white. :-| It was fine, but nothing to write home about - desperately needed seasoning.- Artichoke special: Served with curry mayo and a crumb. Tasted fine, but plating was weird and it was hard to eat. Some of the leaves were cut off and drizzled with sauce, but the stem and heart were also there. It was very hard to eat. But when you did get some of the meat, it was roasted nicely and the mayo was yummy.We probably would have ordered more starters, but since we had to order our mains, that's what happened.- Main 1 - Lobster Risotto with Saffron ($30): Again served in a plain white dish, like a low bowl you would get at a diner. The risotto itself was cooked okay, but it was WAY too cheesey. Something a child might have described as Cheesy Rice. The lobster chunks on top were way overcooked and rubbery. It was tough to eat and we didn't finish it.- Main 2 - Sea Bream with beurre blanc ($42): The best thing to be said about this was that the beurre blanc was delicious. However, it was a whole butterflied fish spread open on a plate with sauce and nothing else. It was overcooked, full of bones (but they gave us one of those metal tins again for the bones?). I don't mind paying $42 for a main, but it should come with some garnishes or be the best fish I've ever eaten - it was neither.By this point, neither of us were very impressed. But decided to give them one last chance with dessert.- Chamomile panna cotta with blueberry compote, strawberry jam and black sesame. Again in a white utilitarian bowl less than 1"" deep. This white panna cotta had 2 circles of each fruit on it, and then a sprinkle of raw black sesame seeds. Not a paste or cookie or some kind of roasted something, just a sprinkle of seeds on the top of it all. What a disappointment. Oh and did I mention we weren't offered tea or coffee with it? #petpeeveSo all in all, we wouldn't recommend this restaurant. So unimpressed with mediocre service, expensive and ugly but not delicious dishes, and an environment that didn't know what it was. Take a pass on this one friends, it's not worth your time or money. Celebrity chef or not, poor food is poor food."

Well, art imitates life, and Max imitated any given Jason Siegel character upon walking into this ridiculously cool spot (do kids even still say ""cool""?). Because signage was so 2013, you can't see Le Bremner from the outside. And lights must have gone out of style with Kelly Kapowski because you can't see anything inside, either. The I-hate-my-parents hairstyle'd hosts seat and schmooze you while the mustachiod bartenders sling you hand crafted cocktails. The leather clad crowd gawks as you walk through to see if you're important, because you need to know someone or be someone to get a table. I'd reciprocate the curiosity, but wouldn't recognize anybody notable these days. I could redeem some cool cred, knowing all the words in their 90s grunge rock playlist - unless it was just being ironic. ...but that food, though.First plate was a salmon tartare with shishitos; charred, smoky, and spicy Asian peppers over a bed of fresh, high grade fish. Then came the fried quail. This ain't no Colonel Sanders $1.99 special, this is the  General Bonaparte of extra crispy succulence. My very ladylike dinner date couldn't keep herself from sucking those quail bones dry. The second entree was a wholefish, deboned by our waiter like a surgeon. So soft, so flaky, so tasty, we didn't dare disrupt the flavor with the lemon provided. We had a coffee mouse for desert. An indulgent mix of creamy, crispy layers with a deep, rich coffee sensation that emanates a rustic aroma all the way down your pallet.So book that table however many ice ages in advance necessary to go to Le Bremner and be prepared to spend a pretty penny to get the full experience - because it's worth it (but also build in the costs of a new pair of skinny jeans and Miley hairdo before you do)."

I was in town for a conference but my hubby tagged along to do some sightseeing in Montreal. I felt lucky to snag a reservation on a Monday evening, considering many people think of Chuck Hughes is a culinary god in Montreal. I originally had dinner reservations for 9pm but my work commitments that night ended a little earlier so I called the restaurant to see if I can bump up our time slot - and they were so accommodating! They said they can fit us in an hour earlier! We walked from our hotel (Le Westin Montreal - superb, btw) to Old Montreal to find the restaurant.  I did hear that it's not clearly marked and it's easy to walk right by, so we were careful to look at the address numbers.  Le Bremner is located on the basement level of an old building so it's a fairly steep set of steps down - watch your head for you tall folks! But once inside, it's a cool, cozy and casual vibe.  It's fairly small - so reservations are highly suggested. We checked in with the maître d' and were seated right away.  The menu is in both French and English and leans heavily on the seafood side. We shared the crab kimchi toast to start and I ordered the turbot fillet with fiddleheads in an meuniere sauce and my husband ordered the arctic char. Oh my -  everything was outstanding! We finished off dinner with dessert - the pancakes with Pimm's butter for me and the chocolate pot de creme for my husband - they too were fantastic! As far as service- the servers were accommodating to our English-speaking needs :) and they were friendly and attentive. We enjoyed our dinner there and we are already plotting our next visit to Montreal. Do I think a trip to Montreal needs to include a trip to Le Bremner? QUE OUI!"
/user_details?userid=1Bljt-GngRP4XxkQFLnHHQ,Rod M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I recently took my wife out to Le Bremner to celebrate our anniversary. Although it was Tuesday night and most of the other restaurants in Old Montreal were mostly empty Le Bremner was full. we had a great evening and were very impressed with most of the food not all the dishes were on the same level. Here's what we ordered:Giant Fried Oysters: Ok so they are not giant, i'd say large. They looked and tasted great, 4 stars. Garlic Cheezy Bread: not something that you would generally associate with a top end restaurant, but wow was it good. 5 stars. Hake & Clams: The clams were good, not great and the Hake, although cooked to melt in your mouth perfection, was completely without taste. Compared to the wonderful flavours that we experienced with the other dishes this was the Hake & clams was a a let down. 3 stars (would have been 2, but the hake really was cooked perfectly which deserves props)Cornbread with Garlic Shrimp: so the shrimp were great, but frankly I can saute up some terrific shrimp with garlic and butter it's really not that hard. But wow,was that cornbread i just tasted, impossible, it was so moist so sweet, so tasty - now that's impressive. 5 stars. For dessert it was a toss up between the jelly filled doughnuts and the pineapple upside down cake. Typically neither of these would be my first choice, I'm more of a triple chocolate fudge sort of guy. On the recommendation of our waiter we went with the pineapple upside down cake which we really enjoyed. 4 stars.Le Bremner is a great restaurant that we really enjoyed and would go back to however, it is not worthy in my mind of 5 stars as there was just a little something missing. And when you're paying these prices you really need to over deliver on all fronts to get 5 stars in my books."

Now labneh is a real thing in my books that I have to include in my dairy roster.  For mains we had the fried chicken, halibut and a side of beans and figs.  Delicious! Fresh ingredients just melded together perfectly.  A wonderful setting for food.  My wine selection was not the best but the dessert more than made up for it. The home made their Ferrero Rocher and blueberry cake.  So good.  I can eat this food everyday and not feel gross!  It feels like home cooking that has been elevated.So overall worth every single dollar and will be back again"

Had a great late Friday night dinner with a good friend.  It helped that my friend knows the staff and we were able to get a last minute table.  It's on the eastern end of St. Paul. The portions are somewhat smaller, but it was all very tasty.  The fried quail and the shrimp and lobster roll were excellent!!! The fried quail is reminiscent of traditional butter milked soaked chicken, except it's with quail.  The shrimp and lobster roll is served on square piece of brioche with creamy avocado dressing. When we asked for a side of asparagus, we were twice told that it's not possible.  The second time we were explained that they only buy enough ingredients for their dishes/portions.  I've never been told this before, but I guess it makes sense if you are using local fresh ingredients...  I will certainly be back for more...."
/user_details?userid=HqMWEEsYIXoFhdDIX1NtrA,Stephanie Y.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Le Bremmer is such a romantic, speakeasy restaurant. My husband and I came here for our mini moon and they kindly sent us some on the house champagne. We shortly there after switched to a combo of French whites and red. But everything we had food wise was excellent. And I was actually a bit happy the food wasn't so rich and the portion sizes were somewhat manageable. We started off with a selection of mild, sweet oysters, to the house sourdough with delicious whipped butter- it was re used for the even more delicious lobster labneh spread. Two things I enjoy very much.  Who doesn't like a good labneh and easy to eat lobster. The dish didn't meld as I expected but the ingredients were amazing on their own.  We moved onto the cavatelli with tender, soft lamb which was my hubby's favorite. A bit salty, but rich (it was the neck), and the sauce was a bit thinner.  We also had the halibut stew which was in a light cream sauce, with yummy clams. Clams might have been the best part. For dessert we had a delicious mini pancake stack, crispy and sweet in all the right ways. Good cappuccinos too. Service was very warm, and our server was also excellent. She was so warm, and made such good suggestions, understanding how a bad meal can turn into a bad night. She spent so much time with us and was very detail oriented. Highly recommend for any romantic occasion!"

People speak so highly of this place but it seems like I've missed what the hype was for.I came here for a girlfriend's birthday. We are not fussy eaters so the birthday girl told the chef (Danny) to make what he felt like serving us; family style. Danny is an amazing person, hands down. Makes you feel welcome as soon as you walk into the resto. Greeted us with open arms (literally) and a huge smile. Love this guy. Love the staff. Amazing people.Our first round consisted of Oysters of the day, Tuna and Tahini sashimi, salad with prosciutto. The bread and butter was amazing. Super fresh. The oysters were ok. I thought they were a tad dry, to be honest with you. Never had that happen to me. Tuna and Tahini sashimi was delicious.For your second serving, we were presented with clams, lobster with mash, cauliflower in cream sauce and fried chicken. I'm not a fan of clams so we will pass right over that. The lobster with mash was very tasty but there was barely enough lobster for 4 people. Actually, there wasn't enough lobster for 4 people. The cauliflower wasn't anything to rave about but the fried chicken was quite good. I mean who doesn't like anything fried?Finally, our last course included whole sea bream, mushroom risotto and 14 ox faux filet with potatoes. I'm not a risotto person but it was quite tasty and enjoyable. The whole fish and steak on the other hand was terrible. The fish smelled and tasted so fishy that I could not get my bite down. The steak was extremely fatty and although the glaze that was placed on top was delish, the steak itself wasn't anything to rave about.Finally, the desserts. If I'm not mistaken, we tried a bit of everything but seeing as we never saw the menu, I have no idea what they usually serve (it was my first time). We had their home made Ferrero rocher, sponge toffee, home made marshmallow, their pancakes, homemade cookies and chocolate ganache tart. Their pancakes are a must try!!Setting me back $250 for two people and nearly giving me a heart attack, I would have to say that yes, the food is good but considering how much it cost me, I don't think I would go back. In my personal opinion, there are better restaurants in Montreal that will cost you cheaper. I am super glad I tried it out but I don't think I will be going back."

Something was a bit off last night when our group of three went to have a late supper. We had to wait 10-15 minutes for our table, which happens in life but there was no place at the bar and I was super thirsty. After a dozen delicious oysters we shared 3 appetizers: asparagus with summer truffles, which were just ok, snow crab which was perfect and tuna with tahini, which I liked the least. It was missing seasoning! The asparagus wasn't well cooked, a bit dry and tough. For the mains we ordered two 14 ounce faux filets, which were  cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The lamb neck cavatelli was rich and satisfying. Overall the service was just ok, not what is the norm at Garde Manger. Our plates sat around for longer than I would have preferred. Music was great, the homemade cocktail (the rocket) was super yummy! Would visit again just to be sure I captured the place correctly."

/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Let me preface my standard review format by asking one question: What was NOT perfect about my experience at Le Bremner? F*ck all, that's what. Location: Tucked inconspicuously away on St. Paul, across from the Marché Bonsecours.  It's ten minutes away on foot from the Champ-de-Mars metro, and street parking is available (metered) and there's a parking lot next door ($15). If you're not paying attention, it's easy to walk by this place without seeing it. The place: With Chuck Hughes' celebrity status, I thought Le Bremner might be pretentious and full of snooty people. HOWEVER, I'm pleased to report that I was wrong. Located in the basement of a historic building, the restaurant boasts low ceilings, wood floors, a funky bar and a minimal but incredibly cozy decor. It's easy to imagine what this space looked like when the original Bremner owned the place. As far as patrons go, there was a good mix of people, and the vibe was friendly and casual. The food: It was more than I expected. In fact, it's two days later and I'm still full from Friday's dinner. My friend and I shared two appetizers: the Burrata and the porchetta with Kimchi and crackling. We were served the entire Burrata along with tomatoes and it was delicious. Truth be told, I've had Burrata that was a little more flavourful, but I'm not complaining. When I asked the waiter if it was imported from Italy, he looked at me like I was asking the most obvious question in the world. So, the answer to that question is duh, yes. Awesome. The porchetta was hands down, the best porchetta that I've ever had, EVER, and it currently rivals my original favourite from Dolcetto (sorry, guys!). The pork was melt-in-your mouth delicious and the Kimchi was the perfect accompaniment. I rarely eat meat (if ever), so if I'm singing its praises, you should take my word as gold and order this dish. No ifs, ands or buts. My main was the Turbo with nduja butter, broccoli and well, honestly, I was so focused on the size of the fish and the awesomeness of this dish that I can't remember any of the other ingredients. Our waitress expressed such excitement when I told her that I was thinking about ordering this fish, and after explaining that it was a new dish (or rather, a revamped version of a similar dish that she now considered to be perfect), I was sold. The Turbot was huge and took up almost my entire plate. A perfectly white fish, it was flakey and not at all fishy. The accompanying sauce was perfectly buttery, and the broccoli was amazing. I'm generally not a fan of broccoli but it was out of this world. I think they used a little balsamic to cook these, and it totally did the trick. My friend ordered the clam chowder and was completely enthralled. Every time I looked up at her, I found her smiling and muttering ""God, I'm so happy right now."" For dessert, I got the pot de crème: Abruzzo coffee, chocolate and caramel taffy (I think?). In any case, I think I cried a little as I ate this. It was so good, I was sorry to see the bottom of my perfect little tea cup. Overall, I could really taste the dark chocolate, but it wasn't sickeningly sweet. I would eat this every day if Chuck gave me a bulk discount. My friend ordered the pancakes and said they were great. Even though she was stuffed, she refused to leave the last pancake behind. When I suggested she do this, she gave me this look that implied I might be nuts, and informed me that she couldn't just 'leave it there.'Service: Amazing. We were greeted by a friendly fellow whose name I didn't catch, and our water was refilled regularly - I didn't have to ask once for more water (they leave the bottle on your table). Our table was cleared after each dish and we were frequently asked how we enjoyed our dishes. Our regular waitress was Maude and she was awesome. She was super friendly, took the time to go through the menu with us, encouraged us to ask questions, made some suggestions and more importantly, she absolutely made sure that we knew how proud she is of the dishes they serve at Le Bremner. We really appreciated her attention to detail. Lastly, when I made a joke about hoping to see Chuck Hughes, she told me that Danny Smiles was working that night and offered to go see if he had a few minutes to stop by our table. It was great to end the night and we enjoyed meeting Danny. Thanks Maude & co. for an awesome evening!Price point: Expensive. It ran us about $100 per person (including a glass of wine). Do I regret dining there? Hell no. The experience was worth every penny and I would definitely go back. It's the perfect place to go when you want to treat yourself.Now, getting a reservation here is like winning the lottery so all I can say is try to plan in advance and call them about a month before you want to go. They don't take reservations more than 30 days in advance, and they're almost always full!"
/user_details?userid=hZgREoZPC30EEilayde2Ug,C L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Absolutely incredible. Exceeded all expectations.Came in on a Saturday night with a large party of 8, expecting to overpay for a high end meal as is usual in Toronto. Luckily, Montreal was different.Our kind waitress (I believe her name was Bee) thoughtfully recommended a $70 set meal so that we could share and sample various dishes (in smaller portions). I was skeptical at first but I bit the bullet along with everyone else and was not remotely prepared for what was about to happen. The chefs had cooked up absolutely everything on the menu from that night. I honestly thought they were going to do 2 or 3 of each main and appetizer in order to save on time and energy, but they went all out and covered the entire menu so we could try everything, and with appropriate portions to boot.Now, I don't know if this kind of ""sampler"" approach happens in other restaurants but as a first-timer, I was pleasantly surprised and extremely satisfied. Portions were great (which is more than I can say for most other restaurants in this price range), presentation was on point and, of course, food was delicious. Drinks were also amazing; pricey, but crafted excellently. 361 mule (or donkey) cocktail is highly recommended. Head chef Danny Smiles also personally came out for a little chat and bring a few dishes personally to the table, which was a nice touch.All in all, wonderful place. Just look for the red lights leading down to a basement."

This was one of the recommendations. Incidentally, also one of the only things that's open on a Sunday/Monday in the winter... but a fantastic find it was! Not only was our waiter tri-lingual, which allowed our Italians to order in Italian, the French to order in French and the rest of us to order in Canadian... but they were lovely and chatty and gave us some great recommendations.There's an excellent cocktail list, do have a look. We went with some tuna tartare starters, oysters and risottos, some other seafoody pics, one of our party had the rib eye and said it was a bit fatty for his liking but to be fair, this is a seafoody restaurant. This quite possibly captures what the best parts of being French-Canadian should be: welcoming, cosy, great food and they helped us get taxis for the way back to the hotels. If you're visiting, put it on your list! NB: we tried to make a reservation but nobody picked up the phone so we tried our luck and just happened to get a table."

/user_details?userid=aUhcscNphAJQlZe1R_WRow,Vincci L.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my top meals of 2015. This was on my to-try list of in Montreal. I arrived on a chilly Monday night right when it opened. I like how it's a bit hidden from the main street in Old Montreal, down a short flight of stairs. I sat at the bar, and was greeted immediately by the friendly bartender who then served me some sparkling water. I ordered a bourbon cocktail, while I read the menu. Browsing the menu, I wanted everything. The menu doesn't tell you too much about each dish, but when I inquired with the bartender, he was knowledgeable and clearly depicted what the dish would taste like. For my appetizer, I got the lobster dish.  It's with pieces of butter poached lobster, perfectly cooked, on a bed of creamy cow's milk labneh, with the spicy and sweet and slightly fishy rosamarina sauce. It was also surrounded by some fresh crunchy potato chips, which served as a good way to scoop everything onto one chip, all in one delicious bite. With a mix of textures and flavours, this was a great start to my meal.The halibut, seared perfectly, was in a bowl of chowder, with a cream stock, and then a smoky flavour is brought out with the lardons. The broth was hot and smooth, and I broke pieces of the halibut into the broth and ate it all together. Needless to say, I finished every last bit of this.Then, the finishing plate, the dessert. I was going to pass, but when the bartender told me that they would be the best pancakes I would ever have, I caved. I waited in anticipation for these pancakes. Finally, a stack of pancakes, doused in a maple syrup sauce. They were amazing. Light, fluffy, and that hot maple syrup sauce made it that much more memorable. Service here was top notch, my water was constantly refilled, and conversations at the bar was always pleasant. I cannot say anymore about how delicious my meal was. Le Bremner, I'll be back."

Initially I couldn't find the entrance because it's tucked away down below a set of stairs in the basement of some building. Inside the environment was really cosy and intimate. We sat at the bar (my go to spot) and started the night off with a couple of old fashioned cocktails. The bartender did a really good job making the drinks! So good! For starters, we order the lobster plate to share along with some sort of beef carpaccio. Both dishes were delicious! They brought out a homemade pasta dish on the house and the pasta was incredible. It was super chewy with a sort of spongey feel. For our main we had the fish which came with a side of green vegetables. Also excellent and super tasty. Because we were sitting at the bar watching oysters being shucked, we decided to order a dozen oysters too to try it out. It was so fresh - would totally recommend getting this too...but perhaps at the start of the meal instead of in the middle like I did haha.Overall the food was fantastic, the bartender and waitstaff were amazing and awesome sports for taking Jameson shots with us!

When I ordered the Arctic char with Brussels sprouts I expected at least one sprout on the plate. All I got were leaves. The chowder consistency was way too thin and the fish wasn't seared long enough. Seriously don't bother coming here.

Service was alright, the girl was nice and took her time to explain, and you gotta love the constant water service. I guess the only issue our group has was the menu. Inflexible as hell. I mean, I guess maybe if you had to point fingers we should have done research, but I didn't really feel like calling and asking for a menu rundown before going to the restaurant. I wish there was a little more flexibility with the menu. Some folks don't like pecorino, or any sheep/goat cheese, but apparently you can't do much about that. The seafood preparations were all good with exception of the tuna, which was beyond room temperature and mushy, did not feel sashimi grade. Oysters were bomb, can't go wrong there. Nordic shrimp was a questionable menu option, all cooked at variable doneness, we're in the seafood industry and man was that a kick in the ass as far as preparation and pricing. Risotto (again with the cheese). Steak was good, the jus was good, but 79 for an angus? It definitely didn't feel like 18oz as well...79 for a 45 day dry-aged bone-in tomahawk makes sense...but that ribeye was not even an inch thick... Hype."

So simple and well done.A 14oz steak with potatoes- perfectly cooked steakTuna & Tahini- One of my favourite dishes all night, we all wish we were able to have more of this.

The dish is super simple: fish, sauce, and some peppers on top. But its simplicity is the real essence of what makes so delicious. There are no showy gimmicks. It's very simple, local food made at a high level with lots of love and creativity. The flavors coming out of that piece of fish blew me away. Of course, I had heard about the pancakes and knew going in that I had end my meal with them. I did, and am so glad I chose to do so. Like I said above, there's nothing revolutionary about these pancakes, they're just simple food made with a ton of love and quality ingredients. All in all, it was an extremely positive experience.

Also had the corn cacio e Pepe which was pretty good and the very tasty beans. For a main we shared the lobster risotto. Delish! Fantastic drinks too. You can't go wrong with this place. Highly recommend."

Nothing to complain except that they didn't give me a gallon of that addictive pancake syrup which my husband devoured before I could get some! Highly recommended especially in a tourist trap area. We sat outside in the back patio - super cute, which is more casual than their main dining room."
/user_details?userid=gwIqbXEXijQNgdESVc07hg,Elvis A.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"With the fantastic Montreal food scene there are few chefs which are considered a must visit when visiting this great food city. I think the chef that runs the show here is one of them. Reservation online were impossible to get for the group size we had even though we started to test the water quite early.  Ah well I got a call back and we got a table to 6 for a 630 meal (a bit early but apparently they have only a few tables for 6 and the later seating was sold out). The entrance is unmarked. Once we got in we were walked to a nice veranda in the back which was mesmerizing and set the mood right for our group. I was surprised to see that they did have quite a few empty tables that could have seated 6 (more on that later)After a bit of deliberation we settled on the following Lobster sandwich with a 63 degree egg, fried quail, Spicy tomato salad, halibut cheeks, green pea shoots with bonito. I also added some oysters for good measures.  The wine list is decent and reasonable. We were planning to drink afterwards as the meal was so early so didn't order much booze and stuck to their house made non alcohol drinks. The server was visibly disappointed and the service suffered.We did share the food so here goesOysters very fresh and the sauces were quite good on the sideSpicy tomato salad. Average at best and I am not sure why is it called spicyHalibut was quite good apparently though I didn't try itQuail was a hit among the diners as it was very meaty and had bread crumbs which reminded me of deep fried mutton chops from the subcontinent. Lobster Sandwich hmm a chef's whose claim to fame is this crustacean I would say it was very average. The sauce being the highlight as I felt the meat to bread ratio was off. The egg added a nice touch to an already rich dish. The price is on the high side (this is old Montreal area and one expects to pay more) and for the amount we spent I would say the service should have been better. There were quite a few tables that were empty so I am not sure why a later dinning time could have been accommodated. 3 stars overall."

It all started with the phone call to reserve, where I was told that there was only space for two at the bar for the time we were looking for. However, throughout the night several tables remained empty. After that it was hard to accept 4 small slices of bread for $6 and a piece of halibut the size of half an iPhone with three asparagus for $32.

Once that tree was chopped down, the fish with the brown butter sauce and toasted almonds was delicious.The Lamb Neck Havatelli was every bit of tender, juicy, mixed in pasta joy, I've had in a long time. Although it was oily, this isn't something I'll eat daily. :)It possesses a Williamsburg, Brooklyn inspiration. With a knotty wood cabin like interior, with a chill pierced, tatted, sideway ball capped staff to accommodate.

I've read Yelp reviews strongly recommending reservations and thought that since I was dining solo, I could head there and grab a seat at the bar when one opens up. I arrived at about after 8:30PM and the place was packed. After a few minutes, two seats opened up and I plopped myself on one of the seats. The bartender cleaned up the bar area for me and then asked if I had a reservation and I said no. Oops. I assumed that bar seating was first come first served. Then I asked ""Do you take walk-ins for bar seating?"" He told me that they actually have a reservation for the bar but then said ""Don't worry, we will take care of you."" Thank you!!! He then went to check the computer terminal and confirmed with another employee that they can seat me at the bar, no problem. Then that employee gave me a high five. Awww. What great customer service. I appreciate them working it out for me.Service was friendly without being too in your face. I wanted to get an old fashioned but decided to try their version of Negroni. Pretty good I would say. The whole seabream was SO amazing it rocked my socks off. The outside was perfectly grilled and the inside was so moist. It was exactly how I imagined it to be, and better. I think they ended up being impressed on how I managed to pick apart the whole fish by myself :)I wished I could try the other items like the duck hearts but a gal can only eat so much alone. Definitely will return to try the other items. Must-go in Montreal. And be smarter than me- make a reservation."

I had been wanting to try Garde Manger for years and was lucky enough to have work send me to Montreal on the same weekend as my birthday! Unfortunately couldn't get reservations. Luckily I got reservations at Le Bremner (tip: they only take reservations one month in advance and it can be done online).The place can be tricky to find if you aren't reading the numbers. It is in the ""basement"" in between two stores (I believe the store on the right is a clothing store). But if you look out for numbers its not hard to find.The food and service was impeccable! We arrived slightly early but no worries - warmly greeted and promptly seated. Our server was very knowledgeable (I think her name was Amie.. or Mie.. just she was lovely!). We started off with the fried quails, then got the chowder and lamb cavatelli, and for dessert the pancakes and eclairs. And of course a bottle of wine. It was all delicious. The chowder was especially fantastic - complex but subtle flavours.the bill ended up being a little over $200 for two people. But it really is worth it.As a plus Chef Danny came to greet the couple beside us so I got a glimpse  and fan girled out a little in my booth."

I was not able to get reservations there so I decided to give this restaurant try (as many people do).Love the feel of the space as I walked in. It's dark and basement-like, you won't know it's there unless you are looking for it.  Service was attentive and friendly.  We ordered the quail ($16) with ranch and lemon for the appetizer. It was fresh and tasty. We also got the tartare which was delicious but a very tiny portion for the $19. We passed on the cocktails (nothing looked too appealing) and ordered a nice bottle of white wine for $50. They will provide and ice bucket and fill up very little so you can enjoy the flavors of the wine.For our entrees I got the trout (similar texture to salmon) with a crispy skin. This dish was delicious. Very fresh and crunchy. The lamb capatavi (pasta) had a good flavor but wasn't as impressive. For our dessert we got the homemade Ferraro Rocher ($3) which was rich and choclatey!We did get a glimpse of Chuck (he came out to say hello to some patrons) which was exciting.This restaurant will set you back about $80-$100/person so come prepared."
/user_details?userid=f7Q14HePdG1vZpx28PpDRg,Kyle C.,"Las Vegas, NV",1 star rating,"Food was good but service way way way too slow. Also felt the price was just a tad high for what you're getting. I give them points for creativity and unique food though.We ordered the fried quail appetizer, which was tasty. Also the lamb heart. As it's heart, I figured it would be chewy, which it was. But its something I've never had before so I assume that's the way its supposed to be. Not my favorite dish but we were being adventurous on that one. My brother got their twist on a clam chowder (basically like a regular clam chowder but with real seafood and whole shelled clams). I tried it and honestly it was nothing special. More impressive to look at than it tasted. My dinner was a fish course (I cant recall which fish it was) covered in a broth and with some veggies. It really was just not very flavorful to me. But I admit that it takes a lot to impress me with fish. Honestly I think the food is ambitious but just doesn't resonate for me. I'd say at best it was good, but for the price, definitely underwhelming. The real challenge was the service. When we initially sat down, it was great. Then we quickly realized they were either understaffed or overwhelmed. There was a 20 minute wait between each appetizer. That was reasonable compared to the 40 minute wait after the 2nd appetizer to receive our (underwhelming) dinner. The waitress seemed to be avoiding our table as if she knew we were getting unhappy with the wait. The wait was bad enough but why compound it by pretending there isn't a problem? Had they or the manager come over to apologize that might've resonated but she sort of dismissed the long wait because ""everyone sat down at once"". I mean, that's restaurant customer service 101.  We sat in that restaurant for over 2 hours! At one point, I was literally ready to get up and pay and walk out of the place without eating dinner. That's not good. Anyway the wait time really soured me on the restaurant. Maybe if we had gone at a different time and tried different dishes, I might understand the 5 star rating some are giving it here. Alas, we spent over $150 and I feel like it was a total waste of money."
/user_details?userid=sKVpHfhkG_Nvgf_Vfb91Cg,Janine T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow, I do not understand the mixed reviews of Le Bremner. Came here last night for dinner and was literally blown away by the amazingness of this restaurant. The restaurant has been closed since before Christmas, so we snagged a spot on the first night that they reopened for 2012. As soon as I walked in, I was impressed: the exposed stone walls, the decor, the chandeliers, the funky windows; it's absolutely quaint and gorgeous. The music went from r&b to reggae to everything in between and it never drowned out our conversation.As soon as we sat down, Max, the raddest server in Montreal, came over to tell us about the cocktails of the evening. Every single ingredient is made in house and they are spectacular; so spectacular that we each had two.After having those knock your socks off cocktails, we fully entrusted Max and told him to bring us whatever the most awesome 5 things on the menu are and we sat back and waited to see what he would surprise us with.- raw striped bass: the pistachio and mint topping was incredible and the fish was absolute perfection. Best thing I have ever eaten, ever. No contest!- albacore tuna: it was sooo amazing and the panko and roe topping were so tasty. Like the striped bass, it melted in your mouth and the taste of the fish wasn't drowned out by the toppings.- rosemary and ricotta bread - never would have ordered this on our own but wow, it was incredible. The honey and the cheese drizzled on top were a perfect pair.- Merlu et Palourdes/hake and clams: never before have I fought over brussel sprouts with a dinner partner but here, we did it and it was epic (and I got the last one, drenched in buttery delectable sauce)- Skatefish and potato salad was also yummy. Had a breaded crust on the outside and was cooked just right. The salad had a ton of garlic and was jsut plain awesome.And for dessert, I had the pineapple upside down cake. My dinner partner looked over and instantly regretted his chocolate ganache choice so I gave him a bite of my dessert, but only a tiny bit because I adore pineapple and I think this was the best dessert I have ever had in...my...life...This is in the top restaurants that I have ever been to.

We made reservations about 2 weeks in advance, and I'm glad we did. We arrived a little early, and were warmly welcomed. Our table was just wrapping up and we were invited to order a drink, hang up our jackets and relax near the bar until our table was ready. Their signature cocktails were great, unfortunately I can't remember what either my husband or I actually got, but I remember them being good. We shared the scallop crudo for a starter, and it was delicious. Super light and fresh. I got the sea bream and my husband got the braised lamb pasta. Both were incredible. The fish was cooked absolutely perfectly, and our server was kind enough to debone it tableside (which he did a perfect job of by the way). The lamb pasta was great too, and was a good contrast to the fish. It's flavors we're warm and savory. We finished with the signature pancakes. Do not miss these!! They were just sweet enough and a great ending to our meal. The service was impeccable, yet casual at the same time. All of the servers we interacted with were super friendly. Water glasses were never less than half full, fresh cutlery and sharing plates were provided for each course. All of the service of a top notch restaurant, but with personality. I'll admit I slightly rolled my eyes reading reviews mentioning how great the music was, but they were right. Oldies but goodies like Hall and Oates played along with newer, hipper tunes. The staff hummed along with certain songs (not in a weird way). Just a super cool and relaxed atmosphere with excellent food and service. The restaurant itself is a little hard to find, which I kind of liked. But if you look for the red diamond seen in some of the pictures you'll find it."

So I'm hoping it was a bad off night. But honestly it was really not good. The shrimp and labneh had no flavor. The lobster risotto was ok. I liked the sting beans but it tasted just like plain butter and a sprinkle of salt. My tequila drink was very sweet. The music was so loud (though great songs). Waiter was great. I basically felt like I would have been happy eating this meal at a friends house but it was the most expensive meal we had in Montreal and by far the least appetizing. Again maybe it was an off night since so many people seem to like it.

I am completely in love with it. My girlfriends and I visited on a Saturday night for their late sitting (9pm). Le Bremner is located in a basement with no signage (simply ""Restaurant""). The interior seats 30 and the back terrase had seating for another 20 or so. The place is very dimly lit and keeps the reggae music pumping loud enough to enjoy but not drown out your conversation.We sat up at the bar until our table was ready and sampled a few cocktails. We tried a basil & pineapple margarita, a strawberry rhubarb one and a peach long island iced tea. All three were amazing, made with fresh ingredients kept in mason jars lining the bar front. Our hunky bartender was chatty and explained the ingredients to us - even the syrups they use are made from scratch! The menu here has ""tapas"" or shared plates and there were about 30-35 good options in total. Our waitress recommended 2-3 per person. We ordered:Bacon cheese focaccia ($9) - Simple but possibly the best dish of the night! This is a must order dish.Lobster parfait ($30) - comes served in an ice cream sundae dish - heaps of lobster meat, Bibb lettuce, caviar and cream fraiche. Amazing. Asparagus and tomato salad ($9) - another hit, served with a perfectly soft poached egg and grilled asparagus.Kimchi & crab ($20) - this was served on some kind of potato croquette with fresh crab meat and kimchi overtop. It was great but probably my least fav dish since everything else was outstanding.Lamb & veal meatballs ($17) - again, heavenly, served with a tomato sauce and craim fraiche.Naan pizza ($20) - this changes daily, but ours was topped with seared scallops and arugula. Highly recommend this too.The food came out 3 dishes at a time, they gave us some time to digest in between courses, plus replaced our plates and cutlery with new stuff.The service was faultless and all the staff were very young, hip and goodlooking.We were WAY too stuffed for dessert but the jelly donuts looked awesome. Our bill came to $190 including tax and tip  for 3 people. Not bad and completely reasonable given the amazingness of the food, drinks and overall experience.If Chuck Hughes ever decides to open a 3rd restaurant, I hope he will consider one in Toronto!

When this was brought to the attention of the aforementioned server, she said that is how custard tarts are supposed to be.  This gentleman and the other two patrons at the table who shared in his observation felt ignored and trivialized.  I felt incensed and will say they took the custard off the bill without being asked.  I understand that a celebrity chef is associated with the restaurant.  My guess or assumption would be he is not overseeing operations at this restaurant because if he was he would be appalled.  I will add, lastly, that our group of 6 is very well-traveled and one of us runs a culinary blog and another teaches cooking classes to high school students.  Perhaps the workers in the kitchen should come and take some."

With no official website that I can find, Le Bremner seems to be deliberately flying under the radar. I really liked the atmosphere: lots of brick and chandeliers, very warm and cozy. You feel like you've been just let in on a delicious secret. They make some killer cocktails: I loved the berry bourbon. There was no official cocktail list, but the server recited a list of what was available that night. The dishes are all meant for sharing among the table, and are all roughly  the same size (they don't really have appetizers and mains). It's a bit complicated to order for a big group (we were six) but our friendly server helped guide us. We got to try many things that way. Some of my favourites were the kimchee snow crab on rice cake, the lobster parfait, and the kohlrabi salad. Everything was delicious. And then came dessert: the strawberry shortcake was simply divine. Reservations can be difficult to obtain: for best results, call well ahead, be flexible, and be patient. It's definitely quite a splurge, especially if you indulge in their interesting but expensive wine list like we did. But I think it's well worth it."

Nothing was spectacular compared to the other places that I've been to in Montreal, which is saying something good about Montreal and not bad about Le Bremner. The decor was also very nice - loved the cozy feeling of the place. The bad: there weren't any.

We all had the signature cocktail that night - a concoction which included home made ginger ale and rum and was all manner of fantastic. The wine menu is well thought out with some great options. Our bottle of white arrived perfectly chilled and our glasses never went empty. We shared a variety of starters from the menu and all raved about the lobster pizza - thin crust and perfectly garnished with a generous helping of lobster meat. I had the braised veal and octopus dish as a main and both elements were very well prepared and tasty. The real standouts for us were the desserts - we had 1 of everything and couldn't decide which one we loved more. The doughnuts are easily the best I've ever had - light and airy and not at all greasy and our waiter was spot-on when he joked that we would want to squirt the accompany lemon curd directly into our mouths. The banana coconut cream pie was fresh and light. The pancakes were very rich and decadent but buttery soft deliciousness. Our Quebec strawberry milkshake was a real standout - very tasty and not too heavy. As usual, the staff was amazing - very sweet and attentive from Danny Smiles himself to the very last busboy. It's also worth mentioning that the music selection is random and GREAT!"

/user_details?userid=HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg,Yvonne T.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"When I finally decided I was going to book my trip to Montréal, I knew that Chuck Hughes' newest addition, Le Bremner would be on my ""To Eat"" list.After his Iron Chef fame where he defeated Bobby Flay with his Lobster Poutine, demand has been through the roof.  Rumours are that his restaurant, Garde Manger was booked out by 3 months!  In hopes of offering more of his yummy food to eager diners and without wanting to disappoint and turn away his customers - Le Bremner was born.The ambiance is not too different from Garde Manger with its dim lighting and wood-accented furniture.  However, I was able to nab a reservation a week ahead which was a blessing. The servers here are all very knowledgeable about the menu and can make some great recommendations.  I must urge you to try one of their yummy cocktails with housemade syrups.  I opted for the Posemary - which was made with gin, sake, lime syrup, rosemary and grilled pears.  I was deeply and utterly satisfied.  I dare say this was the best cocktail I had ever sampled in my life!Bread sticks were offered to us, and I felt like picking one up and conducting a symphony when I saw how long they were.  They were buttery and salted.  To start we got oysters on the half shell which hailed from New Brunswick  (Chiasson and Village Bay) oysters tonight. It was accompanied by a supporting cast of regular and cucumber mignonette with fresh horseradish, lemon and Sriracha.  These were one of the freshest oysters I've had in a long time.  We devoured these quickly.Our second starter was the Lobster Toast au Gratin, which is essentially a Croque Madame with lobster meat in it.  This would be the one dish that stands out in my mind when I recall all the wonderful culinary delights I sampled in Montréal.  The béchamel sauce, the chunks of lobster meat, the buttery toast and the perfectly poached egg was like an epiphany in my mouth.  It was oh so creamy and oh so delicious!  I am dreaming of it right now... If there were only one thing I could change about this dish - it would've been the bread as I found it broke the delicateness of the overall dish.  The bread was a very sturdy bread.  I would've preferred something a little thinner.For mains I ordered the Halibut which was served with Crispy Pork Rinds and Chantarelles on a bed of Mash.  Le Bremner - how could you, Titan  and ruler of all things seafood, manage to burn my halibut?  It was as shocking and disappointing as learning that Santa was really just some chump in a suit.  So close to being a perfect evening!  I expected the crunchy (from the pork rinds), but not from the sound of biting into an unpleasantly burnt skin.  The flavours, however, were perfect!I also sampled the Cheese Steak which was topped with arugula and the thinnest fried onions imaginable.  The steak was tender, but I thought there wasn't anything special about it.  I wonder...If I hadn't tasted the wonder that was the Lobster Toast if I would've praised it more?For dessert we had the Pear Tatin. Anything with the word tatin in it usually means longer prep time, so if you are opting for this, you may want to time it better so that you're not left nursing a glass of water and twiddling your thumbs when dinner is over.The espresso at Le Bremner was so powerful I was almost thrust out of my chair.  Alas, once the dessert came, it evened out the imbalance of boldness and sweetness :)The tart tatin came out piping hot, and was topped with ice cream.  A la mode boys and gals is the only way a pie should be eaten!Verdict:Being the restaurant that served me up my most memorable dish, I can't say that Le Bremner wasn't good, but is it one of the top 10 places I'd recommend?  I must say no.  The irony that I found out Chuck Hughes lost to Beau McMillan on the Iron Chef: Super Chefs only 2 days prior to my departure was an omen? Some would argue that in his defense, tofu, the secret ingredient of the battle was not Chuck's forte.  My argument - if you are a celebrity chef, I expect you to know how to cook with any ingredient that is presented to you.Although my most memorable Lobster Toast was consumed here, the tragedy that was the burnt halibut will also remain in my memory.  The Lobster Toast is to Chuck's first win on Iron Chef as the Halibut is to his recent loss on Iron Chef :p"

Would def go back!"
/user_details?userid=J76FnutwAI2PkkB4A-LNwg,Lilliane G.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Saturday night I had what was easily one of the top 5 meals of my life. Chuck Hughes' latest restaurant, Le Bremner, is too cool for words. From the moment you step down off the sidewalk and through the doorway you know this is going to be a good night. You'll find yourself instantly seduced by the combination of it's riustic decor, exposed stone walls, hardwood floors, and dim lighting with Bob Marley playing softly in the background.  It's difficult to resist swaying to the music as the bartender charms you with his easy smile and deliciously tempting  concoctions - we couldn't resist - and every single cocktail we ordered tasted like a potion divined by the gods themselves. I had the Strawberry Rhubarb Manhattan, and my friends had the Peach Long Island Iced Tea and the Pineapple Basil Margarita...all three were mindblowingly deliciously and well worth the $12 each.  The cute bartender even divulged his secret ingredient for the syrup they use in their Long Island Ice Tea!  We had made reservations and there was a short wait for our table, but we didn't mind at all.  We happily sat at the bar soaking it all in, the drinks were delicious and it was a great spot to people watch, PLUS we had a view straight into the kitchen where all the action is!Once we were seated, our server brought us the menu. Neeless to say EVERYTHING looked delicious.  We ordered the Bacon Cheddar Focaccia, Naan Bread Pizza, Kimchee Snow Crab on Crispy Rice Cakes, Lobster Parfait, Chorizo Sausage and Lamb Meatballs, and the Asparagus with Poached Egg.The prices on the menu items we ordered ranged between $9-$30 each, with the Bacon Cheddar Focaccia being the least expensive, and the MOST DELICIOUS, with the Lobster Parfait at the top of the price range @ $30.    I'm going to list the stuff we had in my personal order of preference:The Bacon Cheddar Foccacia was by far the group's favourite...what this place can do with simple bacon and a focaccia!  Lord Have Mercy!Chorizo Sausage and Lamb Meatballs - OMG!  3 huge meatballs packed with flavour and served with a thick, sweet tomato sauce...YUMM!  The sweetness of the tomato was a perfect contract to the peppery/smoky flavour of the meatballs.Naan Pizza - the naan pizza changes daily and this night's offering was scallop, the scallops were perfectly cooked, and the pizza was topped with a lightly dressed arugala salad (I love arugala on my pizza)!  The pizza was nice and spicy too!  Kimchee Crab on Crispy Rice Cakes - the Kimchee was delicious, if I'm not mistaken there was a hint of heat in this dish and it worked perfectly!Asparagus with Poached Egg - delcious, braised aparagus served with a perfectly poached egg and roasted cherry tomatoes...seriously, this who knew that something this simple could taste so heavenly.The Lobster Parfait was probably the largest of the dishes, and it was loaded with fresh lobster, creme fraiche and caviar!  The lobster was cooked perfectly with a sweet and buttery flavour.The meal was a delicious and our six dishes were more than enough to feed us...I actually couldn't finish the last slice of naan pizza, and believe me, it was not for lack of trying.  I almost shed a tear as as I witnessed my table mates cut up my last slice of naan pizza and share it between them.  DAMN YOU tiny stomach!!We had initially considered having dessert, their jelly donuts to be exact, but we're simply too full (amateurs). I want to go back!  I want to drink Strawberry Rhubarb Manhattans and chow down on Bacon Cheddar Focaccia.  For the record, if I'm ever asked, that would be my last meal."

I was told their menu changes often; more of a reason for a return visit to Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=cqgjW23FJyu5kFlRDN1CpQ,Rawan K.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Being a total foodaholic and Chuck Hughes fan, I had to check this little baby out. It was my mom's last night in town and I thought it would be nice to take her out and enjoy the experience together. The restaurant is cozy, warm, and dimly lit, hidden in a basement just off the cobblestone street of St. Paul. Upon our entry, we were welcomed with smiles and got seated at our table.The wine menu is lengthy and offers quite the variety, if you're unsure of what to order, Le Bremner's staff is more than happy to help give you an idea of the best pairings that suit your budget and your taste buds.I love a restaurant that knows what its specialty is, and keeps its options simple. Le Bremner does just that, with approximately 3-4 choices per meat, fish, and vegetables. While I found the choices to be quite different than what I was accustomed to, I thoroughly enjoyed what I ordered, as well as what I tasted off my mom's plate. Above ALL, I would recommend the tuna and tahini sashimi. The explosion of flavours that come after each bite is beyond belief. They put just the right amount on your plate, allowing you to savour each and every bite, and each and every slice. Their spin on snowcrab kimchi was also outstanding and had a great punch to it. For our mains, I ordered the salmon and crab-bacon bearnaise with a side of green beans. It was simple, light, and delicious. I have never tried a bearnaise sauce like this before, it was packed with flavour due to the flakes of crab and bacon. My mom ordered the delicious hot lobster sandwich that comes topped with a 63 degree egg. It was savoury, heavy and complex, but oh so scrumptious. For the dessert, we shared the chocolate, peanut butter cream & salted caramel pot de creme, as well as the pancakes with pimm's butter and sucre a la creme, AND the sugar n' oats pie with blueberries and creme fraiche. My absolute favourite of the three were the fluffy, perfect, warm pancakes. I have never tasted something so perfect before. I don't have the biggest sweet tooth in the world, but I know a good sweet when I taste one, and DAMN this was amazing.Yes, it can get expensive, especially if you order numerous items and bottles of wine, however, it was all reasonable considering what we ordered. So depending on your choices and budget, I'm sure you can find something to satisfy your palate!"

/user_details?userid=XJxdQmkr94M5dqr2XEMWfQ,Ron B.,"Richmond, Canada",1 star rating,"We ordered some albacore tuna as appetizer, lobster Risotto as main and some green beans with butter to share. Started out with this super dinky little (only 3 slivers) of tuna, smothered with too much sauce. That was $19+ high tax in montreal. The lobstee Risotto- cheese was over powering. Lobsters were fishy while waiter claimed super fresh. It was SUCH a let down- flavours of the dish dont mixed together. The green beans with butter is even worse. Just a handful and horrible looking dish for $8??????Too much butter!!! The worst was they do not provide bread to customers. When we asked for them, they said they only sell bread/ sour dough they make everyday (only four loaves).... what kind of dinner is this? No bread????  After I inquired more and specifically asked for BREAD STICKS (just becauze i saw them on yelp) our waiter said maybe... I would need to check. He then came back with 3 skinny pieces without bread. We asked for butter, he said no, they dont have enough and they dont eat the sticks with butter. We almost had to fight for butter in a restaurant... thats ridiculous!!! It is surprising the green beans came with that much butter swimming in it but they dont give u butter for bread...All in all i would highly recommend ppl NOT come to this place even they are in a very interesting location!!!Foods are definitely priced too high there... do not go!

Our favorite was definitely the spaghetti squash.  I highly recommend this restaurant and know we will definitely be back."

Sean Michael, the bar tender is a genius; tell him the flavours you like and let him surprise you.We shared the raw scallop appetizer and I was surprised by how quickly it came. I barely had time to enjoy my cocktail. The scallops were sliced thin, served over pickled, thinly sliced cucumber and squash. It was topped with thinly sliced radish, microgreen (coriander) and pepper flakes. The pickled cucumber and squash was way too acidic and too sharp for my liking. The radish and the heat from the pepper flakes overwhelmed the delicate scallop.For my main course I ordered the fried quail with some shaved fennel, radicchio, frisée and mussels on the side. It was served in a plate and the dressing from the salad made my quail soggy.My husband had the cod in crab dashi broth. The cod was a tad over cooked and the broth was a bit flat. All I could taste buttery saltiness.Our dessert was the best part of the meal. We had peaches and cream and it was delicious. The peaches were halved, topped with whipped cream and serve on what tastes like creme brûlée custard."

/user_details?userid=_oFZVJPGkIKYbDsfP2YaPA,Nicole M.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Chuck Hughes has been my celebrity chef crush since I was a child. Growing up in Asia, he was the only Canadian chef on the Food Network, and I loved that. Going to Le Bremner was honestly the highlight of my entire trip to Montreal.The place is hard to spot: It's down a small set of steps without any signage. Find the place: it will be worth it. We entered and were greeted warmly, with no wait for our reservation at all. We were given menus, the raw bar options were explained and we ordered our drinks. Our main server, Antonio, was absolutely fantastic - one of the best servers I have had in my life - professional, but also the kind of person that you wish you were friends with. My sister told him that I absolutely loved Chuck Hughes, and I got to meet him in the kitchen! This was a dream come true. I'm not kidding, I almost cried. That being said, I tried my best not to let this cloud my judgment of the food, which was all fantastic anyways.I ordered oysters to start: there were two different east coast oysters and I got three of each. Fresh, not overly fishy, and the mignonette was delicious. My sister's boyfriend got another raw bar option, the prawns, which were cooked in shell and so perfectly seasoned. Really fantastic. Wouldn't have minded those just for myself. My sister ordered the salmon tartare. They were served with shishito peppers, and there were probably a few too many, but they were easily fed to the boyfriend on their own.We waited about 10-15 minutes for our main courses. I had ordered the sea bass, with a bernaise sauce and green beans. My sister got the halibut in a clam-esque chowder (he had used a dashi base) while her boyfriend ordered the arctic char with broccoli and almonds. I'm pretty sure my fish won - it was perfectly cooked, the bean to fish ratio was wonderful and the bernaise was simple, but wonderfully done. In fact, the dish was extremely simple, but the ingredients sang and I could have eaten 5 more plates. The clam chowder in my sister's dish was great, but its an atypical chowder - it's not quite as thick and rich, but the dashi brings cuts through the typical clam taste and really is quite interesting and wonderful. The char was good, but I really hate broccoli, so anything that has the taste of it turns me off in a second. I'm probably not the right person to comment on that dish.We debated about whether we wanted to order dessert, and in the midst of that debate we got the pancakes for free! ORDER THEM. They're wonderful, right down to the butter. Honestly, the service was so great. But do make sure to make a reservation, because as much as I'm sure they will try to accommodate you, people were still wandering in for their reservations at 10:00 on a Wednesday. Also, this restaurant's focus is on seafood, so if you're feeling red meat, this probably isn't the right place for dinner. All in all, one of the best experiences I've had in Montreal!Pricing: About $80 a person (without tip), 2 drinks a person, an appetizer and a main (this doesn't include dessert, which would have been worth it, free or not!)"

But it kind of *is* my Cheers...everyone there, from the manager Mike to the bartender Vito to the delightful server Maude make an effort to make you feel at home in this wonderful restaurant. It was truly a refuge for me during a 5 month stint of working away from my regular home in San Francisco.So, the service is obviously top-notch here. Not in the stuffy, overbearing way. In the way that makes one feel like they're eating at a good friend's house. The menu is relatively small and changes on a regular basis, and they'll be quick to help you explore its highlights. The music adds further to the comfortable vibe of the place - it ranges from Johnny Cash to Biggie to Alt J to The Rolling Stones and everything in between. I want their music library at my house!The food and cocktails are, simply put, awesome. Yelp says that Le Bremner is seafood, but it's not. It's half high-end ""comfort food,"" half amazing seafood, expertly prepared in every detail by the super friendly chef extraordinaire, Danny Smiles. The dishes he serves up rival those at the best spots in SF, no joke. Try the calm chowder, which is supremely light and has a big hunk of white fish on top. I don't even like chowder, but that stuff is making me drool as I write this. ;)  The salmon tartare, fresh oysters, burrata, lamb neck cavatelli, chocolate pt de creme, and pancake dessert are all highlights of this amazing menu. As for the cocktails, well, they are insane. If you want something traditional, they'll do it right (you won't find a shaken manhattan here). If you're looking for something creative, they've got you covered. Just tell 'em what kind of liquor you like, or what you usually drink, and they'll craft something that's not only compatible with your tastes, but will *blow your mind.* Trust me on that one - I'm a cocktail snob, and these guys rocked my world.Simply put - if you're visiting Montreal, go here. If you live in Montreal, you'll want to be careful...once you sample Le Bremner, you may find yourself dining here more often than your pocketbook is prepared for  ;)"

We told the waiter to surprise us all the way through and I will never do this again we weren't happy with their choices and felt that the dishes they served us really weren't their best dishes. The oysters were fantastic and the trout gravlax as well. We also had a buratta entree which was good but nothing to rave about. The main dish they served us was a whole fish with the spine and all and was not impressed. The other main was mushroom risotto which is usually my favorite but it was way too salty very hard to eat. Lasty was the pancakes for dessert which were very good. Overall my experience was not good enough to say id go back especially considering the price.

Neither of us drink alcohol so I can't comment on the cocktails that others have mentioned.  We've both had iffy experiences at restaurants when the server finds out we won't be drinking but no issue here.  The waiter took the drink menu and wine glasses away with a smile and told us about the house made sodas instead. Their take on cola was fun with an aftertaste I couldn't quite identify but really enjoyed.  I think it may have been cloves but the waiter told me his lips were sealed as it's a secret recipe. They also make their own sparkling water which was fine but honestly could have used a little more ""sparkle"".  Started with the night's amuse bouche which was tuna dipped in tempura batter and fried with a spicy sauce on the side.  The sauce had a nice little kick to it without being overpowering.  Also had some oysters while we decided on our appetizers. The oysters were good but nothing special. For our appetizers we shared the raw scallops with pear, raw salmon with avacado and beef tartare with matchstick potatoes.  All of them were incredible.  Hard to pick a winner but I voted for the beef and my partner for the salmon.  For our mains, my partner chose the hake and clams which he raved over.  The couple of bites I had of it were pretty sensational.  I had the robella and pulled pork which the waiter described as their take on surf and turf.  It was basically a white fish with a cut of pork shoulder.  It was very good but didn't blow me away when compared with some of the other dishes we had.    Desert time.  The waiter ran through the list which included house made doughnuts, crème brule, strawberry upside down cake and a couple of other options that escape me.  My partner went with the doughnuts and I went with the upside down cake after hearing that it was the waiter's favourite, .The doughnuts came in three and were filled with lemon, blueberry and spicey chocolate.  The bite I had of the blueberry version was great - filling was sweet and thick without verging into ""jam"" territory and the dough was nice and light.  Apparently the spicey chocolate was the best one although I didn't get a taste (damn it!).  My upside down cake was the clear winner though.  It was definitely big enough to share but I managed to eat most of it myself with a couple of bites somewhat begrudgingly offered up to my partner.  It was the perfect mix of vanilla cake, cinnamon and strawberries with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.I read some so-so reviews of the service, but didn't get even a hint of poor or distracted service at all.  Our waiter was engaging, answered all of our questions about the menu and his recommendations were spot on.  In fact every person who came to our table was helpful, funny and chatty without being intrusive.  They really set the tone for a fun night.  Not sure when we'll be back in Montreal, but when we are, we'll definitely be visiting Le Bremner again."

It was packed when we went and it was clear to me that everyone there was happy to be seen at Le Bremner. It definitely was a nice place, very swank ,very in, very small. I'm a big foodie. I expect to get a good meal for what I pay. I am not shy to spend if I think its worth it. Maybe I'm use to what I guess some may call Joe Beef portions.  My conclusion is that maybe this is not my type of cuisine. Small portions, a medley of flavours yet flavours that seem to resemble each other. The service sealed the deal for me, it was ok. All in all if you are an out-of-towner check it out ... if you are a foodie Montrealer I would definitely go to Le Bremner. I just won't be a repeat customer."
/user_details?userid=XEqApY2jtSPdGptPsJHumg,Lucy F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Excellent restaurant!!! Can't wait to go back.We started with the homemade bread/butter: amazing!We had the salmon tartare with fried green peppers, the grilled broccoli served caesar style, grilled fish and the fried quail, crab and the amazing pancakes for dessert. Everything was outstanding! Flavours are complex and every dish is original and surprising.Even the soft drinks are homemade and they are exceptionally fresh and delicious. Try their ginger ale!One negative thing: I really did not like the lamb cavatelli. My husband didn't like them either. We weren't able to eat more than one bite each. They were very nice about it and didn't charge us for it. I don't know if something was wrong with the dish or if it's just a question of personal taste.Still... Loved my experience here and service was very good. (Actually preferred it to Garde Manger)"

We tried the most popular dishes tonight, starting with the fried quail and ending with the Sea Bream and Lamb Neck Cavatelli. We wished we had room to sample the pancakes but just couldn't so we will have to return. 1. The fried quail in many ways was like having a mini version of fried chicken although the batter is crunchier than your standard KFC. The ranch sauce it comes with pairs nicely and isn't overly rich. 2. The lamb neck Cavatelli was delicious. The lamb was tender and the pasta was al dente. However, this dish is very rich so make sure to pair with your favourite wine or cocktail.3. The Sea Bream was the really winner; it was fresh, perfectly cooked and seasoned, and huge! And the garlic sprouts were the perfect garnish too. The servers open up the fish for you so let them do their thing and enjoy!"

We both had scallops (very fresh), and I had the tuna and tahini sashimi (too die for). Main courses were lamb neck for my husband (insanely good) and halibut cheeks with beet butter for me (subtle and delicious). We ended with a chocolate, caramel and peanut butter pot de creme. Wow. I should also mention the house-made gin and tonics. The husband raved. They also make their 7-up and ginger ale in house. Finally, the staff was terrific. We highly recommend a stop here. It is a special occasion restaurant price-wise, but well worth it."
/user_details?userid=LpOlBfFR9Ly7C_r2AQ00WA,Melissa E.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"3.5 STARS!!!!Dude, our bill was CRAZY!!! But we knew it would be. Several AMAZING cocktails (kinda think that was the best part of the night...and the cutie bartender serving them up), wine, amuse bouche, food...do not expect to not break the bank. Our bill was $100 per person PLUS tip. As I said, drinks were the most memorable. The food was pretty good but I think I am majorly spoiled in Vancouver. We had the spicy tomato salad (could make at home), a kind of pizza (also doable at home), then split 3 mains. One thing I have to say was a tad annoying was our waitress kept telling us how many plates we should order. And then when we didn't she questioned our decision. Look madame...provide suggestions then step away. Our mains were the deep fried pork (not my choice) which was the biggest disappointment. I mean this was so deep fried you couldn't taste anything else. The second main was the skate which was shockingly delicious and light. I have had skate once before and it was nasty so this was a pleasant surprise. Lastly we had the shrimp and pork rice which was odd...basically just rice, could not taste or see any shrimp and also had 3 mussels on top. Very odd and wasn't quite sure where they were heading with this one. But look, this place, minus the fact that it's entire staff was mainly anglophone (or so bilingual that even i didn't realize) is quintessential Montreal. I LOVE the space. I love the fact that it is not overly designed. In fact I don't even know what the design style is other than awesome. It doesn't overwhelm, it just makes you want to hang out and spend way too much money. This is one thing Chuck Hughes always gets right...Garde Manger is the same. You just kinda want to live or work there. So, yes, i'm a fan, but maybe not for the reasons one would think when reviewing a resto. Go for drinks...lots of drinks and maybe a few snacks...cause those breadsticks are not filling but they are delicious!"

/user_details?userid=nCEAIa3keRIY6qyZ_YUzlw,Hayley G.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"I ended up here the same way a lot of people end up here - couldn't get a reservation at Garde Manger. It turned out for the best, because this place was soooooo good!The setting is casual and comfortable, but still relatively nice and high end. It's slightly dark since it's underground, but it doesn't feel at all dingy.My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night at 9:30 (we'd made a reservation earlier that day). All the tables were full and there were some people waiting, but it didn't feel too jam packed. Our reservation was for the bar and it turned out the bar is a totally great place to eat (and yes, there is a hook for your purse). It was nice having the bartender right in front of us - he was nice to chat with and he also made us the most excellent drinks. However, I wouldn't recommend sitting at the bar if  you want privacy or if you're with more than 2 people.As you're supposed to, we ordered a bunch of dishes to share. The naan pizza was to die for, the kimchi crab on crispy rice cakes was almost perfect, the sea bass edamame was great but not out of this world, and the lobster parfait was amazing (but maybe too creamy for some).  As you can tell, this was not a typical menu. The food combinations were really innovative and if you're not into (slightly) experimental eating then don't go here - you won't find standard fish & chips or fish tacos. For desert we had chocolate ganache pie and it was good but not excellent. Then again, maybe we were just too full at that point. For two people wanting plenty of food and a couple of drinks you'll end up paying almost $200 after tax and tip, so don't go here if you're broke. My boyfriend and I think this may have been the best meal of our lives. I 100% recommend it!"

It's got a bit of a following thanks to Chuck Hughes who was the first Canadian to beat Bobby Flay on Iron Chef, and also has his own Food Network Show. Chuck was in the house the night I was there (yes, he actually WORKS in his two restaurants), although I didn't see him. But then again I didn't go into the kitchen. The food was good. Really good. But not OMG-the-best-i've-ever-had. Which is too bad because it's been consistently getting 5 stars. Their homemade cocktails however, are probably worth the trip alone. Try the bourbon berry. YUM. (The pear rosemary cocktail tasted like soap however.)The menu had changed so most of the previously mentioned dishes weren't available. We did try the kimchee with snow crab (yum!), and followed it by the seared tuna flat focicca (very nice), the cornbread with grilled shrimp (only ok), and the halibut with crispy pork (decent, but not rave worthy). We had the chocolate ganache pie for dessert. It was good, but not spectacular.The service was really excellent though, so although the food was maybe only a 3.5 stars, I'll give that extra bit for the excellent excellent servers.It is pricey though. We paid $220 for 4 cocktails, 6 oysters, and the  4 ""sharing/tapas style"" listed above, and one dessert."

The scallops were a revelation. The hubz can have texture issues with some scallops, so we ordered them thinking I would eat them, but they arrived diced with corn and a bit of creamy sauce, and we decided they were the favorite of the evening. The side of corn was cooked perfectly, and delicious. Sea bream: deboned at table and also perfectly cooked. We tried heart for the first time so I don't have a comparison, but it was thinly sliced over seasoned, julienned cabbage-like vege (maybe kolrabi?), and was very tasty.

I wish they had one more vegetarian option as the selection is limited to 2 salads, 2 breads and 1 cheese dish which they didn't have in stock (the buratta cheese).Come on Chuck, even your dog is vegetarian!

My wife had the fried quail which was also fantastic. Our entrees were the lamb neck pasta dish and the halibut and clam ""chowder"" both were outstanding. The broth for the chowder is a maple infused dashi so it is not your typical chowder broth, it makes the dish!

This has got to be one of the BEST dining experiences we've ever had. EVER.First we tried to get into Garde Manger but it was full and we would've had to wait for an hour. So my friend, who is always in the know- directed us to Le Bremner, a hidden underground spot by the same chef as Garde Manger.Upon arriving, the ambience was more romantic- dimly lit (great for couples) I loved the chandeliers. We immediately ordered a bottle of wine- The 2006 Gamay, wonderfully delightful. These are the dishes we had:Oysters by the dozen: OMG. To die for! Tasted fresh as if they were just caught from the water and placed in front of us. We were thrilled that they had siracha which paired perfectly with the lemon. Wow!Kimchi Snow Crab: Perfection. Kimchi was not overpowering, but blended perfectly with the snow crab. Asparagus: Again, perfection. The asparagus was cooked very well, with a little crisp to it and the whole stem was evenly cooked, unlike some places where the end of the stem was a bit hard and inedible. The poached egg, one of my highlights (as an avid egg lover) was perfectly AMAZING. I don't think I've ever been to a breakfast/Brunch spot (even in NYC) that has made a poached egg as good as this one. The waiter explained a special contraption they make the egg. HOLY. Charcuterie and blue cheese platter: Cheese-need I say more?! My goodness, I thought I had died and gone to foodie heaven. Superbbbb!The dishes definitely were nicely portioned...it didn't leave you feeling like, where's the rest of it?? The service was impeccable. They were extremely helpful and friendly without being too intrusive. This is a little on the pricey side, for the two of us it was $180 but really it was worth every penny. We came out of there extremely satisfied. We raved about this place to everyone. Everyone must come here at least once! I will definitely be back here."
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A quick story if I may: My first visit to Chuck Hughes' restaurant Garde Manger was a defining experience for me food wise . We went as a family for my birthday (I think for my 20th) and I just fell in the love with the place. While the overall evening didn't necessarily work for everyone at the table, everything about it worked for me. The look. The atmosphere. The awesome music. The crowd. And of course the food. Garde Manger showed me the kind of awesome experiences we here in Montreal are lucky to have and appreciate. It opened up a restaurant scene I didn't really know existed back then - places that 20-somethings can enjoy great high end food in a environment that speaks to them. Garde Manger became one of my favorite restaurants that night and remains so today. I constantly remind myself that I need to go back more often. After Chuck and his partners opened up Le Bremner in 2011 a little further east on St-Paul St., I have been pinning to go. Last Friday, that opportunity finally presented itself.The restaurant maintains a very similar feel to Garde Manger - non-descript facade, quite easy to miss if you were to walk by. Once inside, a bar on one side and a small seating area on the other. The space emphasizes the beautiful exposed stone &amp; brick walls, the wooden tables and nautical theme pieces with some low lighting, funky accents (skater stickers all over the room ACs) and amazingly great music mix. Any restaurant that plays Jay-Z and Sublime's ""Santeria"" in the same evening is alright by me.Compared to its older brother, Le Bremner has a smaller menu and one very focused on seafood of all varieties. If you don't like seafood, you probably shouldn't bother eating here. Just come have a drink instead. To start off with, the table shared a couple of different entrees. First up, there was the snowcrab kimchee served on crispy rice cakes. Great use of the snowcrab to enhance the spicy kimchee in an unique way. It didn't much for the rice cakes but they added a nice crunch to the dish.Next up, the fluke and mayo chicharron with crispy chicken skin. Very nice dish that I had never had before. Rich and creamy with the nice added crunch of the crispy skin. Given my lack of knowledge about this dish, I don't have much to critique here.The shrimp and cornbread was the final entree. Great combination. The warm cornbread was wonderfully dense but not dry which is always my concern with cornbread. The shrimp was well seasoned and the whole dish had a nice sweetness to it. The items worked well separately but even better together.For mains, the rest of the table shared the lobster pizza. Imagine a pizza with lobster meat, cheese and lobster bisque as sauce. Then add a egg in the middle. Yeah... I know. Stop drooling. This pizza was love for all things lobster. The bisque added a whole other level of richness to your standard pizza. I could have eaten the whole thing my self but I needed to save some space for this.....Octopus and braised veal cheeks with fingerling potatoes, chipolini onions and fried coliflower. Once again, this was a dish where each item was great by itself but the combination made it that much better. The Octopus portion was huge and absolutely grilled to perfection. When you add to that the fatty goodness from the braised cheeks, the crispness of the fried colliflower, the sweetness of the onions and the starchiness of the potatoes, you have a perfectly well balanced dish that covers the gamut of textures and flavors. Simply a marvelous dish.And yet, after all that, we still had dessert to get to. First, pancakes with sucre à la creme and pimm's butter. Thick and fluffy pancakes with sucre à la creme at 11:30 pm, what's not to like? I had originally expected a crepe but was pleasantly surprised when the dish hit the table.And lastly, we ordered the chocolate pot de creme with peanut butter cream and salted caramel. The chocolate and peanut butter creams formed a rich, creme version of a Reese's cup - never a bad thing. The only issue was the lack of presence of the salted caramel - could barely taste it. That would have taken the dessert over the top but alas.....This was a meal that I had waited for a long time and it absolutely did not disappoint. An enjoyable 2 and a half hour meal in the old port that has me wanting more. Garde Manger holds a special place in my restaurant Rolodex but Le Bremner has found its way close to that level. I will most definitely be visiting again.... I only hope it doesn't take me this long between visits ever again.Cheers!"

We sat at the bar as we were advised that it is always the best place to be and Vito our lovely bartender did not disappoint. The evening progressed perfectly with small plates of food ordered between drinks. We realized that they created the drinks on the menu on a regular basis so we suggested that they had free rein and just serve us what they wanted. One that comes to mind started with horseradish and pepper. Alarming sounding but delicious. The food was delicate and so flavorful. Easy to share but hard to part with. You have to really like your dinner date to give up some of your fare. We will definitely return when we're next in town.

We had reservations at the bar and let me tell you the bar is front row, centre stage for the best show on earth. My apologies to Barnum and Bailey, but Dean and the boys behind the counter have you beat. The cocktails are fresh, inspired concoctions that defy description - we enjoyed a lovely peach, ginger mint thingie that was over-the-top refreshing - not too sweet, not too bitter - sort of Goldie Locks in a glass because it was just right. We allowed Dean to steer the course of our meal and the journey was delicious - zucchini salad, tuna and tahini (so yum), classic tomato basil bocci chino, and the char. We enjoyed our meal so much that we took the chance on a drop in two days later. The staff were able to accommodate us in the back alley patio which is beautiful and fresh on a hot summer's eve. We totally changed things up on this occasion and went full-on meat - veal tartar and the 14 oz steak for two. Since I still haven't had an opportunity to try the pancakes, I guess we'll be back on our next trip."

We left before even getting our mains. We did have the Québécois salad and tuna with tahini which were not bad but the almost 45 min wait in between starter and main while being ignored by the waitstaff coupled with the crazy loud music destroyed the night. The worst dining experience I've had in Montreal.

The male waitstaff was dressed in black, very professional and you sort of wonder if the sleeve tattoo is the uniform. The waitress (there was only one) was dressed in white daisy dukes which didn't seem to be as professional attire for a restaurant of this calibre. The food was good and flavourful, though serving mixed drinks before a meal is usually frowned upon (it dulls the palate.) The food was freshly cooked. The menu was nice. The only hiccup was dessert, the pancakes were extremely heavy... definitely the low spot on our dinner."

First time, had a great time because service was excellent, the waitress had sold us on recommendations and they were indeed amazing. Decided to go back today and the whole experience was a huge disappointment. We were sat at the bar and were unfortunately a bartender that was night and day from the first one. Clear attitude issue, talking out loud with other patrons about how she made more dough at Garde-Manger, how she got wasted the night before, all this while calling multiple rounds of shots to guys next to us, which had all the appearance of being served on the house. Meanwhile, our service was neglected, we finished our first cocktails and she never bother asking  whether we'd like something else, I had to ask to get the wine menu back. She never proposed any wine to accompany our meal selection, as the initial waitress did the first time we went. Not only that, but it also heavily felt as if guests next to us were getting preferential treatment, with all the waitresses and bartenders converging at a number of occasions for shot rounds. The bartender was constantly catering to them, refilling, proposing shot mixtures. Basically she was all about shots.. Simply put, immature, Jersey Shore type of stuff, entirely inappropriate. Like I said, complete opposite from the service experience of the first time so I'm in no way trying to generalize, just describing the experience we got this particular night.If only the food had saved the night. We had the oysters and the raw scallops to begin. They were good but way overpriced for the sizes and quantities...Then, ordered the half lobster (likely from a 1-pound), served with barely a handful of potato chips and a few mushrooms sprinkled around. I'm a pretty normal guy and eat pretty normally, and wasn't overly hungry, but I went through the dish in 5 minutes...and was still hungry. No sides, heck we didn't even get any bread, nor the so-called sticks, which were part of the deal on the first occasion. My gf had the fish and clam dish. I had a taste as she spared me a few pieces to help complete my meal. Fish was ok but a bit bland to be purely honest. I could continue on but basically, this was an awful service experience, while the dining experience did not validate the price points. Much much more bang for the buck at Joe Beef, Chasse Pêche or Garde Manger, where we've been numerous times, always treated with flawless service, and generous servings of top quality meals. I will not go back to Le Bremner. It is probably the first time that after spending close to $200 on dining, I'm about to order in some pizza.PS) And for the bartender who dared asking for explanations about the low tipping, sorry baby girl but go to these restaurants I've mentioned and learn from their service standards. Even easier, watch your colleague who we also had once at Garde-Manger's bar, with a top professional service that I recall tipping at a premium. Lastly, grow up."

We had the pork belly with gorgonzola on top...much too rich - I felt like my mouth was coated with fat. The pasta (sort of like a ravioli) was hard on the edges (perhaps undercooked). It was so bad that I ended up cutting all the edges off and eating the centres (which were quite good). The appetizer (kimchi crab thing) was good but not that good.

That's right, he works his line. It was a nice surprise because I can count the number of times I've actually seen celebrity chefs in their restaurant, working, tasting, and schmoozing. Two. Chuck was the second.Bremner opened in July and it's still bustling. Noteworthy mentions include the terrasse.  I took a quite peek during a bathroom break, and it's gorgeous. The cocktails, mixology wonders not bar mixes, were amazing. (Specifically the pampelmouse one, or O-juice, if you will.  It was a balanced mix of vodka, sake, mint, fresh grapefruit and some other stuff.  It was O good, it was addictive.)The menu is divided into seven categories: Chilled Items, From Outside, Bread & Cheese, From the Stovetop, From the Broiler, Vegetables, and Dessert. Order, as you wish. My sister and I started with the kimchi snow crab because its reputation preceded our visit. Now, you should know that we are kimchi experts. So we were both pleasantly surprised that this dish wasn't a wishy-washy fusion concoction of pickled cabbage and spices calling itself kimchi. The flavours were actually reminiscent of actual kimchi. The dish was almost a perfect hit, but for the rice cracker/cookie. It was too big.  I think (emphasis on think) I know what Hughes was trying to replicate here, a Korean dish called norengie. Norengie is the rice crust at the bottom of a stone bowl pot. If you add a little water or tea it releases the rice and you eat it.  My unsolicited advice to Hughes would be to make the cracker half the thickness because conceptually I agree that the delicate snow crab needs a chewy/crunchy counterpart.  The culinary adventure continued with lamb meatballs that were soft and meaty with rich flavours.The spicy bass with edamame was a favourite.  It was delicate and deep - that's the only way I can describe it.  There was so much going on in my mouth and it was all wonderful. Another one of my favourites was grilled asparagus with poached egg.  There was a lot going on on this plate and I liked it.  Together it worked.  Separate, not so sure.  It was a bit like a mishmash song on Glee - unexpected harmony.Dinner, however, ended on a sad note. Doughnuts were implicated (I am aware I have a problem with doughnuts.  I'm in the contemplation stage of seeking help).Due to my obsession with doughnuts, you can only imagine how crushed I was to learn they sold out.  My poor sister, I whined about it for a good ten minutes, and pouted for another five.  Then, after letting out le sigh of tout sighs. I got over it and resolved to go back on my next visit.  But listen Hughes...I live in Toronto. If you stumble across this review and feel compelled to ship me some doughnuts, why, you'd be the Wesley to my Buttercup."

I made a reservation 1 hour in advance, and while my options were limited to opening the restaurant at 6pm, I was pleased to have an incredible meal. Every bite was delicious!My friend and I ordered cocktails, admiring the darkened atmosphere with chic crystal chandeliers. We shared appetizers and entrees and were totally full with amazing sea food. The menus are clearly seasonal, and I never doubted the quality of ingredients and care that would come out of the kitchen. To begin the home-made cocktail flavorings made the cocktails incredibly tasty, with full rich flavors along with that of the liquors themselves. I had an ox-eye (bourbon and ginger). We shared two appetizers, the spicy salmon tartar with shishito peppers was complemented by their garde-manger hot sauce placed on every table. Complementing salmon with fresh green pepper flavor as well as spice made the dish unique to me. We also had the panchetta, kimchi and cracklings, which was beautiful with the very swirly pork cracklings. The kimchi was a little lost under all the meat, but hey I can't complain about delicious pork products. Finally we shared the hake clam chowder. This was a beautifully fried piece of hake with incredibly juicy clams and a delicious dashi based chowder. The service was excellent, we sort of had 2 waiters because of some large groups nearby, but felt very well attended too. The environment was so transformative that we barely noticed the length of our meal, and were enjoying ourselves immensely the entire duration. After telling our waiters that we were visiting Montreal and this was our first night out, our waiter gave us an extensive list of restaurants to try in Montreal. Overall it was an amazing experience with delicious food and a comfortable atmosphere."

HOLY!First off, I love that it's kind of an ""underground"" spot, both literally and figuratively. There isn't a sign, you kind of have to know about it, and it's well, a few steps down from the sidewalk. Again, we sat at the bar, our preferred spot to sit at a restaurant. As mentioned in other reviews, how else can you chat with those ""in the know?"" We were immediately greeted by one of the best bar keeps ever! He let us know that they make all of their own mixers with the exception of soda water. WHOA! Now that's talent. He mixed us up a couple of beauties while we perused the menu. I normally don't love mixed drinks (I am a purist with vodka martinis), but these drinks were out of this world. Fresh fruit muddled, added, shaken, wow!  As we're looking over the menu, the staff from Garde who recommended Le Bremner walks in and immediately comes over to say hello. We felt like we were totally ""in the know"" and locals seeing some of their long time friends. We were told to that it's more of a tapas style, that we should get a couple of things to share. We chose the burrata, but unfortunately they were out of it. HOWEVER, they offered a different cheese and let us try it before we actually ordered the whole dish. How many restaurants actually let you do that? Ah-mazing! We also had the tuna tartare, the fresh tomatoes, shrimp with cornbread (a little bit of heaven), and a fish dish. One was better than the next. The flavors were deep but balanced. There was so much going on in each dish in a good way, we were speechless (yeah - that doesn't happen often!). Just when we thought we couldn't eat more, we finished with warm chocolate chip cookies with sea salt. Perfection!Bottom line: A MUST GO! No question about it.

Nice, fresh NB oysters and delicious scallops.  Next was the raw albacore and beef tartare appetizers.  Holy S***, this could have been the end of the meal, or my life and I would have been okay with it. Neither beef nor fish should melt in your mouth, but both did here.  Everything about the dishes from the accompanying flavors to the textures were incredible.  Next was the snow crab focaccia.  This was the star of the night.  Nice and light.  Perfect crust, nice blend of cheeses and an ample amount of snow crab, this 'pizza' was the best I've ever had, hands down. For our entrees we shared the cornbread and shrimp, and the cauliflower and pork belly. Both were delicious, but not as good or filling as the appetizers or focaccia.

After being seated it was about 20 minutes before my server greeted me and offered to take my drink order. There were a few other tables seated but it was not by any means full. It took another15 minutes for me to actually get my cocktail - the server said the bartender was backed up. We ordered the tuna and tahini, the porchetta w Kim chee, the burrata salad, the fried quail, and the shrimp and lobster BLT. All were highly praised by our server. We asked for her assistance with ordering as we're visiting from out of town. The tuna and tahini was actually very good. An interesting combo with what I think is fried kataifi for texture. Silky, crunchy, Tasty! Then it was downhill from there. The porchetta and Kim chee was meh. Kim chee is very trendy and I should know better by now than to order anything with it. It was an ok but somewhat disparate dish. The burrata salad was bland - needed acid and/or salt. The tomatoes lacked peak flavor. The fried quail was good though not mind blowing. The cheese on the BLT unfortunately overpowered everything else in that dish. We had the coffee pot de crime. Again, just so so. And wine was $15 per glass so a $250 meal that was disappointing. I guess I had high expectations because I'm a Chuck Hughes fan. I'm sure it's his menu but it all comes down to execution. I understand that there are many raves about Le Bremner but I unfortunately did not have that experience. Still a fan but cannot recommend Le Bremner based on my one experience."

/user_details?userid=rlgH96kg3ZduT8NpQwy0vw,Michael M.,"Greenwich, CT",1 star rating,Last Friday we had an 8:30 reservation for dinner.   Somehow we got lost and did not arrive until about 9:10.   We had our hotel call ahead and after a 20 min wait they were able to seat us.  While we waited we had a drink at the bar and the bartenders were very nice. We ordered dinner and our appetizers came quickly.  Then we waited and waited for our entree.    Our waitress was either to busy or just forgot about us.   She should have checked more then once with the kitchen to find out what happened.   Finally they admitted that the entree slip was lost in the kitchen.   We know this can happen but they could have handled it better.    They offered us desert but when we ordered 2 deserts they said they were only offering us one.    At this point we were tired and pissed off.     What they should have done is remove the cost of the entree.    For a meal that cost $184 we expect better service.    The next nights we went to Le Filet and Hotel Herman and had great meals.

We also had the bacon and cream of corn which was unbelievable... Main dish was the smoked sardine plate as well as the pulled pork with a fish I've  never heard of...was crazy good.  Dessert...we tried the crime brûlée, then lemon and blueberry tart as well as the beignets with different fillings.  Wow!  Service by our waitress, Katy, was friendly, helpful and very professional.  Thank you for a great night out.  DD"

I say experienced because they managed to make us feel like the entire night  was a party solely for us. So much so, that after 5 hr's , numerous drinks , amazing foods and an atmosphere ,that even though the place was full , managed to make us feel like we were the only ones there to be catered to , we said goodbye to our new friends. Vito our crazy fun filled  bartender , Chef Danny Smiles..whose dishes come  perfectly seasoned ..so fresh, so  flavorful....truly an experience we will not forget for a very long time. Thank you to all the staff for making our night one we will talk about for years to come. A very special thank you to chef Giovanni, from BEVO, for personally arranging our reservations..and for an afternoon on his patio enjoying some truly inspired ,simple, but delicious Italian tapas. We highly recommend both le Brenner, and Bevo to any and all coming to old Montreal. We will back, forks in hand."

We decided to eat at the bar, which was a great option for this place, and the bartender mixed us up some amazing cocktails that paired with our courses (starter - lobster, mains - pork) surprisingly well. In addition, the dessert, a banana and coconut cream pie, was one of the best we have ever had!"
/user_details?userid=QoUzVZly603PjLZ0rSyQow,Andrea S.,"Edmond, OK",4 star rating,"Le Bremner is definitely a foodie restaurant with a nice gourmet menu. If you come with less adventurous eaters or people who aren't interested in spending money to try new things, they may not enjoy themselves. The wine list is extensive, but offers few ""by the glass"" options. The daily specials we had were excellent. I had the salmon from the menu. It came with a bitter broccoli that I thought was too dominant of a flavor for the light sauce and the salmon though. Be prepared that the portions are fairly small, so you will probably want to have some appetizer in addition to your entree. I had the fried polenta amuse bouche which was pretty good. The ambiance is really pleasant; it is not stuffy but still elegant. The bar area looked great too. Our biggest problem was finding the restaurant. We took the metro to Place D'Arms station and had a circle on a map from our concierge. But there was no sign for LeBremner. The street numbers were on a fairly hidden basement entrance. We found it mostly by luck, but I am glad we did! It really wasn't a bad walk as we discovered on our return to the metro station, but be sure to have a good idea about where you are going and know that you will not see a banner or a sign for Le Bremner. I didn't rate it as a five because there are so many great restaurants in Montreal, and Le Bremner didn't stand out among them as much as I would have liked considering the hype and the prices. But it was good, and is worth it if you are a Chuck Hughes fan and want a truly gourmet experience with good service at a neat looking restaurant."
