/user_details?userid=yACLb6lUDPjw0g5JrNwXMg,Kyle S.,"Atlanta, GA",4 star rating,"Ended up here after searching for hours on where to get decent Italian in Montreal. Was not disappointed.Ordered the classic spaghetti with meat sauce and it really hit home for me. The bread was also very delicious. Unfortunately I didn't take any pics of my food like a good Yelper is supposed to, but I will definitely be back to this place!Very charming place too, with old fashioned decor. I believe they have a salad bar as well that was free with a pasta dinner. (Though my memory may be incorrect)"
/user_details?userid=D0Caw5JJXmQQ5luhH7ZvxQ,Carolyn B.,"Cincinnati, OH",5 star rating,"We went here for lunch. I ordered the linguini with lobster and it was very tasty.  However, my daughter had hands down the best dish at our table  risotto with chicken and mushrooms. Just one taste made you want to beg for more!!   Three of us ordered sangria which was very refreshing.  It made me think of Summer.   After lunch, my hubby had an espresso while I enjoyed a cafe au lait decaf. Unfortunately my daughter's dish was just a special of the day, so they don't always have it. She even sent her compliments back to the chef.    Our waiter was very helpful, funny and kind.  We would definitely go back there when we visit Montreal again."

/user_details?userid=5HiO4RFBVtAc7EY6w2mmRg,Vanessa V.,"Côte Saint-Luc, Canada",4 star rating,very beautiful restaurant in the heart of the old port! the portions are generous and the food was good! prices are reasonable. the only thing is that the pasta i took (prosciutto with blue cheese) didn't really have prosciutto and blue cheese. the sauce was milky (not cheesy) and i had maybe to tiny pieces of prosciutto.
/user_details?userid=KyF8TsD-5g1IHKwQRNW_DQ,Briana S.,"Maitland, FL",4 star rating,Amazing selection of comfort food. I ordered a dish with lobster and cream. It was to die for! You also get to start with the salad bar and they offer and excellent selection of wines.
/user_details?userid=RVuGMBDgPegZ7ANlPF2dOQ,Angela G.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"This spot is great for families, it kinda reminded me of an Olive Garden but with better food. Service was okay, and considering the restaurant was empty for a Friday night - they did'nt need to stick us in the back of the place. The food was all very average, my favorite was probably the pasta with shrimp. Everything else was kinda meh. I probably wouldn't come back here considering Montreal has amazing options. Keep Eating, Angela"

/user_details?userid=l9fGOqjEQDEN10Pog3cMng,Xena W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Nice restaurant in Montreal's Old Port. Prices are reasonable : main dishes (all containing some form of pasta) range from 12$ to 29$, the most expensive being the lobster linguini. Meals come with free bread and all-you-can-eat salad bar. Service is prompt and friendly. They don't have a terrace and the interior is quite dark, but it is tastefully decorated and has a quaint historical feel to it."

I ordered a red wine sangria, which was fantastic and refreshing, and goat cheese and sundried tomato ravioli and it was very good as well except the sauce which was too tart for my taste. Liked the ambiance and really friendly staff which helped me decide my order as a vegetarian :)"

Walked over from Rue de Catherine- quick, cute easy stroll to the port. And without reservation (not sure they take them), walked in and got seated right away.  Hostess was cool, sweet, and super efficient.  Everything on the menu looked good- true to mission- ordered the  lobster with pesto spaghetti- Very tasty.  Meal and includes salad bar!  The execution on the food was not a luscious 5 star meal , but the overall experience was a strong 4.  Wine selection was sufficient.  Service was casual but professional , food was solid.   Felt like a super great deal."
/user_details?userid=ai6Sb1iGQqJNh0w_Zo49Rg,Amy L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Was strolling through Old Montreal and had a sudden craving for pasta so we decided to try this place. I got the lobster linguine while my boyfriend got the lamb chop spaghetti. First of all, the portions here were huge! The linguine was delicious and had a good amount of lobster in it. However, I found it a bit strange that they used peas in this dish and would have preferred spinach or onions. It just tasted a little off. My boyfriend said he enjoyed the lamb pasta as well. The salad bar was quite simple but fresh. Service was also great. Would recommend if you're looking for quick service and yummy pasta."
/user_details?userid=g9MYC0QTNPPmbIdrtdan9A,Foodie M.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Such delicious simple pasta for such an affordable price with all you can eat salad bar and bread with garlic butter!!! Super Fancy French food is good and all but I have to say nothing beats a plate of perfectly made spaghetti! I had the white sangria which was absolutely delicious - you could definitely tell that the wine was marinated with the fruits for a good amount of time before being served.One thing to note is that extra melted/baked mozzarella cheese on the dish is an extra $4 which we weren't aware of, but I would highly recommend it as it was so good. Couldn't have asked for a more satisfying meal!! :D"

Definitely on my list of place to hit again when I come back.  The pasta and chicken was delicious!  The salad bar was so fresh and really felt like something your grandma would make and set out on the table before dinner.  The prices are really fair for what you get.  We beat the rush and had a cute little table in the corner. Definitely bookmark this place and check them out!

I wish they'd addmore seafood options (can't have meat due to halal restrictions) or add a halal option - that would be awesome. Overall a great place! We got cheesy garlic bread, shrimp (15 pieces of shrimp) and my huge dish of pasta all for 31$. All you can eat salad bar plus bread&butter to start with. The two of us were pretty full!"
/user_details?userid=dZT5pdhP-xMZ0Q7YfNBuLg,Nicholas D.,"Dallas, TX",5 star rating,"This restaurant had been recommended by a friend and it sure did not disappoint! It was the perfect place to enjoy a great meal in the charming Old Montreal area. The space is very quaint with stone walls, wood floors, and dim lighting. The staff was friendly but they seemed extremely busy and maybe short handed. There was a line waiting to get in, which did not end up taking too long. No one was really taking names or anything which was a bit confusing. The waitress was prompt, friendly, and accurate which was appreciated. Our French was very rusty and she was more than happy to speak English to us. While you wait for you food, they bring a nice bread basket with a garlic butter side. A salad bar is included with most meals, but the choices are pretty limited. Keep that in mind if you are wanting more of a substantial salad. I ordered a vegetarian spaghetti dish that was absolutely yummy. My travel companion had an eggplant dish that he thought was delicious. The house red wine was great and a good value as well. The entire meal was very affordable considering the area. I can't speak for how the desserts tasted, but they looked amazing. All in all, if you are looking for a cute and cozy place for some Italian food in Old Montreal, I would suggest you check this place out. It is not pretentious or flashy, just a great place to enjoy a good meal and unwind.  bon appétit"
/user_details?userid=Iprn7raIGsZnMXFymmruFw,Janet F.,"Edmonton, Canada",4 star rating,"While walking through Old Montreal with some locals, they suggested this restaurant. It definitely lived up to expectations! The menu is quite large and offers a broad range of different pastas and sauces. According to our waitress, the recipes have stayed the same for a long time, which speaks to the longevity of this restaurant in the Old Montreal area.Upon finally deciding what I'd eat (I went with the classic spaghetti with meat sauce, as they call it, the ""Spaghetti St-Leonard"") which cost $14. All the menu prices seemed very reasonable, especially considering that all menu items come with salad bar and bread included. The bread comes out warm and fresh, and is served with a delicious garlic butter, made in house, as well as conventional butter. The salad bar isn't huge, but it has a good range of different salads that include leafy greens, pasta or potato salads, and other marinated salads and cut-up vegetables. The dressings are very tasty, and there is a vinaigrette that is a real stand-out. The quality of the main course was also great. The pasta was cooked just perfectly (not too hard and not too soft), and the sauce was flavourful and satisfying. The portion size was also surprisingly large, so I wouldn't think anyone would leave hungry.As an interesting side note, the menu items are all named after places and figures from the local area, so those new to the area or just visiting can find some names to google while they wait for their meal (the menus are left behind as placemats).Also, the decor in this place is really nice and rustic, which suits the Old Montreal charm perfectly. This place is definitely worth a try."

We were definitely not disappointed! The servers were polite and attentive and the atmosphere was cozy and casual. I ordered the chicken parm with added mixed vegetables and thought it was delicious! My family also ordered pasta dishes and said they were satisfying and yummy. Before our meals arrived, the server told us we could stop by the salad bar. The salad bar was clean, and had healthy and yummy options. we were also given fresh bread with garlic butter and regular butter. The garlic butter was literally to die for!!"
/user_details?userid=PlOqytFARLVkJ3SH2QChNA,Lai P.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,The bad:Won't allow seating until the entire party is here. Lobster linguine has no flavor and I had to add lots of salt and pepper.The salad bar is very basic and disappointing. Sangria has very little flavor.Escargot is so-soThe good:duck is a bit sweet and very tender. I like the joyous Atmosphere and interior decor.
/user_details?userid=in0aLEL8gC5MwNywqyrdUQ,Eve W.,"North London, London, Canada",5 star rating,"I adore this location. It's perfectly situated in Vieux-Montréal and cures any pasta craving you may have. I ordered a white sangria to drink, the Golden Square Mile pasta, followed by the Tiramisu for dessert. All fantastic, highly recommend. Upon entering this location you will be politely greeted and showed to your table where the server will explain that you can order wine and pour yourself a glass located at the salad bar, and you can also help yourself to the salads (buffet style), then you are brought a basket of breads directly to the table to enjoy. None of which we were expecting but nonetheless was a pleasant surprise.Our server was polite but a bit quiet, we believe she was dealing with an agitated customer right next to us so her demeanour may have been lacking. Overall, great place for families and couples. Amazing wine selection and the food is outstanding."
/user_details?userid=IKSmm5MzHF8cMhMolKaIOw,Lorenzo L.,"Mississauga, Canada",4 star rating,"So what to do for dinner in our first night in a new city...We were in the mood for Italian while in Montreal. This restaurant was relatively close to our hotel so we decided to walk there. Unfortunately for us, the city was under an extreme cold alert, so the 20 minute walk became an exercise in survival. Thankfully, once we were there, we quickly forgot about the cold. We were promptly seated and the restaurant was fairly busy so we were glad to have a table right away. Place is a little quaint and has a nice European decor. It's located in the Old Montreal area. They bring you a complementary bread with an amazing garlic butter along with the AYCE salad bar. We quickly decided to go with the Cheese Garlic bread for an appetizer. We went with Spaghetti St-Paul (spicy tomato sauce), Rigatoni with meat sauce, smoked meat and mozzarella and Spaghetti with meat sauce and meatballs.The service was attentive and prompt as we were never out of water. Portions size were decent and all 3 dishes were flavourful. We were glad that we braved the weather to be here. Recommended."

Good value for the main tourist area. Wish we would have eaten here again instead of trying the close-by poutine restaurant the next day, which was awful.I had the spaghetti St. Paul, which was the perfect level of spice with mushrooms added.  If you like mushrooms,  I highly recommend adding them to your pasta dish."

/user_details?userid=2gLhzkyZNnfbOfJmkdw_8Q,Dipak K.,"Plainsboro, NJ",2 star rating,Were looking for a restaurant that had decent choice of pasta right before we go to see the fireworks. Roamed around a few blocks around old Montreal and finally settled on this place just because they stated they make their own pasta and had a variety of choices plus the place was almost full We ordered a bruschetta and a dish of spaghetti with vegetables. Food - portion are pretty big for Canadian standard but taste was ok. Nothing that was anything to remember. Service - waitress was friendly and accommodating to our vegetarian optionsAmbience - simple 2 floor buildingWas a little disappointed in taste as I was expecting more from fresh pasta and sauce.

/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",3 star rating,"I had heard many good things about this place and so I was looking forward to trying it for myself.  We went on a Friday night and while there was a bit of a lineup, we didnt wait too long to be seated. Service was friendly and quick but the location itself was a little dark and a little cramped. The prices are very very affordable and the quantity you get is very generous , you also get bread with garlic butter on the side and access to the unlimited salad bar with the purchase of any main meal which is a nice touch. The salad bar is okay, it has a few different options but nothing really standout.  we had the braised lamb with herbed pasta which was pretty good when you mix the sauce from the lamb with the pasta, it had nice flavour , although the lamb wasnt as moist as you would expect it to be even though it is braised. We also had the salmon pasta which actually had zero flavour , it almost tasted like KD with a little flavourless salmon inside. We had to add alot of salt and alot of parm in order to give it some sort of taste.  The house red wine was really cheap and actually very good so no complaints there. This seemed like a very family friendly place and a good idea for a casual inexpensive dinner. Not my favourite pasta place in Montreal but it wasnt a bad experience either, so I wouldnt discourage anyone for trying it out for themselves !"

Apparently this place has been around for a VERY long time, so kudos for them!Their menu is mostly pasta based, I got the stuffed manicotti and spaghetti bolognese duo. (the entrees are all named after montreal streets or areas, mine was st.denis something) Pasta was really good, cooked just right. Nothing too fancy and just hits the spot. They have a serve yourself salad bar, with about 6 different salads. The salads weren't particularly appealing but hey, eat your veggies right? They also start you off with rolls served with garlic butter. The rolls were okay but wow that garlic butter! My boyfriend nearly finished off the whole thing. Worth a try if you're looking for a place to eat in old montreal. side story: we spoke to another diner who just exited the restaurant and took a photo of the storefront. Turns out he sailed for 4 months from the Netherlands, making stops along the shore at every city he passed. He said the lobster linguine was good!"

/user_details?userid=ax9skkXMzTJ1rSj2yTakoQ,Ryli W.,"Birmingham, AL",4 star rating,"I would give this a 3.5 if I could - 4 for food, 3 for service. The restaurant is cute, and the meals were very good. Bread and garlic butter were provided, which was a nice little touch. I got the eggplant and my husband got a pesto dish with lamb. Both were delicious! I wish we would've stopped after the meals because I probably would've given this a solid 4, maybe considered even higher, but we decided to stay for dessert. I got the tiramisu, and was disappointed. It wasn't bad, but was lacking on the coffee flavor and really just tasted more like vanilla cake with whipped cream. It was a very light, nice vanilla cake, but not what I was looking forward to in a tiramisu. We also had to wait a very long time (15-20 mins) after we had clearly finished dessert before the waitress brought our check and we could leave. It got a little busier and there was only one waitress, so we were patient, but it was a very long wait with no water refills or anything while she passed us multiple times. This might have been overlooked if she was a great waitress to begin with, but even before this, the service was only okay so it was a little bit annoying. Again, I understood she was busy, but we saw tables order and get their food between the time she brought us the check and came back by to run the card.Overall, the food was good and is why I gave this a 4 star review. Not a fancy place, but a very nice dinner. The service is good when the restaurant is very slow, but could get frustrating during busier dinner hours."

/user_details?userid=y9Txs00wSYpT2kM0Vp6qfw,Judy S.,"Fairfax, VA",1 star rating,"Pros: had a salad bar that comes with your lunch but because there weren't a lot of customers the veggies seemed like it was sitting out for a while. Cons: We ordered 3 dishes the arrabiata (spicy marinara) spaghetti, pesto lamb pasta, and the baked rigatoni with meat sauce. All the sauces were way too sweet and tasted like it was straight out of a can. The pesto with lamb was awful and gamey which smelled strange. The pesto sauce lacked flavor and depth. Service: Just after ordering 3 dishes I realized it would be too much food so quickly asked to cancel 1 item. The waitress was upset and said if I cancel a dish only 1 person could have the salad bar even though we were ordering 2 entrees and an appetizer. It didn't make any sense and they were clearly desperate to make money off of anyone. Service went downhill after that and she never refilled our water cups or came back to ask if we needed anything else."

Someone walked by and commented 'Wow, look at the long line! This place must be good'. That was our thinking too but looks were deceiving. The restaurant seemed understaffed. The hostess was our waitress and also the bartender. I ordered the pasta arrabbiata since this is a difficult pasta to mess up. However, I was dead wrong. The pasta was overcooked and cold. The tomato sauce was thick chunks directly from the can. And the oil? Well, let's just say everything was swimming in it like a fish in the St. Lawrence River."

We went on a Sunday night for dinner, and we had such an awesome time. It was peaceful, and I loved how the interior was decorated with Christmas decorations. We got the lobster linguine, which was absolutely delicious. The noodles were cooked just right and was super chewy, and the sauce wasn't too salty. They also give you a decent amount of lobster meat in the pasta. We also ordered the rose tortellini with melted cheese and the lamb with pesto sauce. The only disappointing dish was the lamb with pesto. The sauce and the lamb tasted sour. They also have bread with garlic bread, and all you can eat salad. The salad bar wasn't super diverse, but the vegetables were fresh and everything went well with the food. Also, I highly recommend the white sangria! It's super sweet and tasty! (Although I wish they had put more alcohol in it). The staff was super nice and sweet. I highly recommend this Italian restaurant."

Needless to say, this place did not disappoint! The portions were generous, the service attentive, and each entree comes with free salad bar access. I settled on a plate of spaghetti with a spicy tomato sauce (arrabiata), and it was as expertly prepared and delicious as you could get. Even better, my order only came to $11.00 (Canadian dollars) after tax. If you're in Montreal and looking for pasta, definitely give this place a shot!"

Pasta was mediocre, the vegetable pasta did not have enough sauce (number 7), the daisy pasta (number 1) was too heavy, they stuffed the ravioli with cheese and then put more cheese on top, probably would be better with a brown butter sauce.

My husband and i could not find a restaurant with any tables so we were so relieved to find that they don't need reservations. Only had to wait 15-20 min while they were packed. Waitresses were super nice. Biggest disappointment was the food. The salad bar was a bit of a shock, just lettuce and dressing, unless you like mayo based pasta salads. My husband had a creamy salmon pasta that was super watery. My sundries tomato and goat cheese ravioli were really good, once i got all the oil off of them. I think because it was almost 9pm might have been why it seemed rushed together. My sangria was amazing. But it's a decent restaurant if you're looking for something without reservations."

Nice and polite staff. Well priced menu. I tried the Grand Prix. Liked it. Yummy and plenty. The salad bar is included. But it does not have much to offer. I would definitely order dessert but I was already full. The interesting point is that they serve daily wine. A glass of red (Spain's) went really well with the food. Spicy and dry."

Between $8 and $12 so it's not that cheap but kids enjoyed their meals.For the adults we were all very happy. The spaghetti sauce is great, reminded me of when people took hours to make a batch instead of buying Classico sauce. The meatballa were huge and perfect in every way. My wife took the eggplant lasagna and loved it.Bread and garlic butter on the table prior to ordering, salad and soup bar with limited options but everything seemed fresh and the homemade (?) salad dressing was very good. We were all too full to order dessert but they still brought some chocolatey squares with the bill.Service was fast and overall I have nothing negative to say.I spaghetti felt like dried pasta instead of fresh pasta like one would expect at that price point, it is my only negative point.Will return if we are back in the area."

We stopped in because it was close to our marina (traveling by boat) and it was rainy so didn't want to search. Cozy old world atmosphere. Almost immediately, were served rolls with butter that had a good amount of fresh garlic added--good. I ordered lamb shank, husband ordered arrabiata. Then we were told our meals also included an incredible salad buffet--potato, green, carrot salads, mixed greens with tangy mustard dressing, beets, green beans, and others I didn't try but all I did were tasty. Good glass of house wine only $7 Canadian. Servings were large--had leftovers. Bottom line: Food was very good, even though not amazing, but I'm giving 5 stars for value. Whole meal--including 2 hearty pasta entrees, salad bar, glass of wine, bottle of pellogrino was $55 Canadian for two--a steal."

Here.Eat too much here.Eat and drink everything including the salad bar here.I was introduced to this restaurant one blizzardy night almost 5 years ago as me and my friends sought refuge from the cold after a night of skating in old port.It was the best winter discovery of my life.Starting with the buns and ""ohmygodthisissogood"" homemade garlic butter (and yes you can ask for more but you will feel ashamed in your happiness), this restaurant really offers everything a pasta lover needs. The free salad bar is always stocked and always fresh. Their house vinaigrette is tangy and delicious and I put it on everything I pick from the salad bar, even if it's just the potato salad.I have tried nearly everything on their menu but I HIGHLY recommend the ""place des armes"" spaghetti with 2 HUGE succulent meatballs. Their meat pasta sauce is the perfect balance of tangy and sweet and the pasta is ALWAYS cooked to perfection. I'm an al-dente fanatic and l'Usine de Spaghetti delivers it perfectly every time.I have recommended this restaurant to every single person I meet who is in Montreal for the first time and every person that has eaten there has told me it was a great recommendation. The most recent people to hear me stand on a soap box and rave about this restaurant were a couple from Newfoundland I happened to overhear on a terrace (I'm originally from the East Coast) and after I had finished my -by now- very polished spiel, my boyfriend and I decided to eat there that night! And who should we see in the line up while we were leaving but the couple!I told them I would hope they enjoy their meal, but I knew they would so I just told them to get the special of the day braised beef ravioli instead.Besides the incredible pasta they also have a kick ass white sangria. I highly recommend and guarantee you'll become as much of an addict of this place as I am. Just can't beat dat garlic buttah!Quality for a great price and definitely not a tourist trap, L'Usine de Spaghetti is sure to become your cozy refuge from anything in life like it was that winter day for me."

There are choices that'll please anyone, from your basic greens to couscous, chick peas, potato salad and so on. I got 3 plates of it and wanted more that's how much I enjoyed it.I got their classic St Leonard spaghetti with meat sauce which was extremely flavorful and had just the right texture.My mom got the duck leg confit with caramelized onions and raisins, she must not have realized that it would be so sweet although the duck itself was succulent.We were 5 people and not one of us had food left on our plates by the end of the meal.It's a charming restaurant, great location and not overly packed. The fact that it doesn't have a terrace makes it a little bit more low key compared to other restaurants in the area but I found that perfect since that means it's easier to get a table.I would definitely go back, can't wait to try their tortellini or chicken parmesan.I would have given this place 5 stars had it included a desert or drink in the meal."

Be careful here too, easy to over do it with the delicious variety. I tried everything in the salad bar (small bites) but not lettuce with dressing. All was outstanding. Desert: if they have strawberry shortcake get it. It's not the American-traditional style it's WAY better. This cake (and it is a cake) is why we came back a second time but jeez the meals are wonderful!  I will tell everyone I know coming to Montreal to get lunch or dinner here!!!  Wine selection was above average.

Bot were good, but LGSM was really good. It had the most delicious goat cheese I think I've ever had. The raviolis were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Les Éclusiers did not suck either, with a well-rounded heat to it. The shrimp were a good size, and well cooked.

Not super expensive either for being in Old Port, but beware it isn't a cheap meal either. Mostly a positive experience, only issue was I felt the waiter didn't come around enough to bring water or whatever I was in need of (the water glasses are pretty small, and dishes are usually pretty hot) but they were pleasant about it and have me a whole pitcher of water!

/user_details?userid=Xjia-GO0JKjWVaT6ORUiZg,Maria P.,"Boca Raton, FL",4 star rating,We were starving after walking old Montreal for hours under the freezing weather so we really wanted to sit down and eat! This place was perfect because they have the all you can eat salads and bread while we wait for the main course...My pesto pasta wasn't the best but it was ok.
/user_details?userid=QcEbJjEFDgmvK-sCxpN55g,Kristy S.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",5 star rating,"We had a wonderful lunch here. Judith was our waitress and she was so warm and lovely. She made excellent recommendations. We had the spaghetti with lobster, today's special, and spaghetti with meatballs. Both were delicious! Great great meatballs (tasty, and very tender...meaty) and so much lobster! Nice wine as well. Desserts looked great but we were too full. An all you can eat salad bar is included with the main dishes. It was delicious! Meticulously prepared salads and dressings. A wonderful feature of this restaurant! We had potato salad, beet salad, pasta salad, Israeli couscous, crisp lettuce, and homemade coleslaw. I almost forgot! They have a Wonderful warm bread basket!!! With herbed butter. Lovely and very quaint decor...from the stone wine cellar in the main dining room, to the antique phone operators switchboard by the bathrooms. Eclectic and interesting! A great place anywhere...a standout in this touristy neighborhood."

The waitress was curt and rude and rushed us out of the restaurant. Other staff members took our plates too soon and kicked us out of the place immediately after paying our bill. I am generally an easy customer and a good tipper, but this was unacceptable as a paying patron at this restaurant."
/user_details?userid=6FYRza9vSd7rROqVTDdY8A,Andrew F.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,We just happened to pop into the restaurant while we were touring Olde Montreal.  We did it based on the menu and the crowd inside.  We were glad that we did as the food was good.  And our servers were great. Great value for the money.
/user_details?userid=wNtRrYCn5F5A6kFcs-gqGw,Roderick L.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,A gem in old port Montreal. Lunch comes with a salad bar and amazing garlic butter. Mushroom penne is so good that I wonder how they cook it out of such simple ingredients. Price is reasonable for this touristy area. Service is alright but definitely great value for a yummy meal!

They offer a great lunch special with a soup and salad bar included with your main. I had the braised beef ravioli that was very good. I will definitely come here again.

On the marvelous St-Paul. E St. This must be one of the best deal and it as established a solid reputation. Set on 2 floors, the concept is pretty simple : Free Bread (with butter or Garlic Butter) and Salad Buffet with approx. 10-12 choices which is pretty decent. The menu has approx. 50 choices of fresh pasta. You will pay approx. 20-25$ dollars for the whole thing. When we were there it was really crowdy and we were on the second floor, near the kitchen. Normally I would be annoyed but the very same place, Charles Dickinson was there when he wrote his Christmas Novel. I don't think I would go back there because I'm rarely amazed by pasta restaurant. What makes me come back to a restaurant is based on: Could I do this at home without being annoyed and if the answer is: NO well i might come back. However the quality of the food is good, and the service rushed but not pushy."

/user_details?userid=uIB8qFzG5E3PUGfiCiUmqg,Steve K.,"Flower Mound, TX",2 star rating,"L'usine's quaint old building is cool and interesting, comfortable but with a cramped feeling at the same time. The bar is fairly limited, with a few decent beer and wine choices, and the salad bar is good... But I wasn't all that impressed with the ""Italian"" food, particularly the tomato sauce. Also, our server was distracted and a little too pre-occupied with what I assume is her beau, who was seated at the barMaybe I'm spoiled with all the great Italian food I've had over the years, but my entree here was uninspired and a bit bland. Mama Francesca's home cooking it is not"
/user_details?userid=-HMryuf0scfllObkYFF0hg,Vanessa M.,"Vancouver, Canada",2 star rating,"I visited this restaurant along with 2 friends, who, I must mention, LOVED their meals. However, I would be lying if I said that I thought that the meal I ate was delicious, or incredibly well seasoned. I had the opportunity to taste their plate of Tortellini au Gratin, which was not bad, though comparable to what I could have prepared at home with a package of Olivieri Tortellini and some commercial sauce. And honestly, how sad is it to eat a meal in a restaurant that you could have easily prepared at home for far less expensive, and with more expertise? Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with packaged pasta - It can even be a life saver when you are short on time. The real problem with the meal that I ordered? 1 word. Overcooked. If you are going to use some commercial pasta in your kitchen, you should at least have the decency to serve it Al Dente. At least that's my take on it. On a brighter note, I should mention, again, that both of my friends really enjoyed their meals! I guess that this restaurant fails at pleasing some people, but succeeds at charming others."

Comfortable very cute place for a family meal in old Montreal . The sauce had a spicy tang to it that I didn't like. Bathrooms were an adventure couldn't fit in one stall and I'm not big, other stall the toilet moved when you sat on it."

Meatballs disappointing but still a decent value for Montreal. Efficient service by Fanny who was charming and dressed for Halloween. Wine was average but there are no deals on wine in Canada. Overall a lovely fall evening for us."
/user_details?userid=Ryz4y3lecA9Z5EHNCCgJKg,Ryan B.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,Very affordable spot in Old Montreal - other places nearby I found to be very over-priced. There's a great selection of pasta dishes and a delicious salad bar is also included in the price. Even the bread and garlic butter brought to the table was very tasty! I had a traditional spaghetti dish and it was very filling!

/user_details?userid=Ffar8yC7iyUroscbI3ALvw,Shana B.,"Albany, NY",2 star rating,"Not so good.  My family and I were very excited to eat here.  However,  the service was less than average and so was the food.  My son who only eats alfredo sauce had to get the gigantic adult portion because they were not flexible enough to make a kid's portion.  I offered to pay the normal upcharge, but ended paying $22 for the 10 bites he nibbled on because they added scallions on top, which I clearly stated in both French and English, no spices.  My chicken parm was dry like the desert and I am still suffering from heart burn a day later from the sauce.  My daughter ate one bite of her spaghetti with meat sauce.  My husband did like his steak, although we all ate some so he left hungry.  We did not bother with dessert, as it is stored on these low to floor case. Kinda yucky way to present desserts.  Oh, by the way,  the salad bar sucks - to be blunt.  Did not take one item.  Waste of $$$$"
/user_details?userid=K_H2SLOudDpujs2cTgPRzg,Joshua K.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"Decent food and service, can't complain.  This place is American-style Italian food, both on selection and portion size.  A bit on the pricey side ($15-25 for lunch); right next to Jacques Cartier Square this is more of a tourist spot than anything else.  Overall, good food and unobjectionable for entertaining groups."
/user_details?userid=Sz-FsPuWlDhuJsdORjWADQ,Paul S.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"So, I am conflicted here as I was taken here by some co-workers of mine who live in Montreal and the service was absolutely top-notch and the place itself was very nicely appointed and comfortable.  The issue is that none of that fills my belly and being a NY who loves his Italian, I have to weight the food heavier than the rest.  The appetizers were decent with the shrimp being the best.  The duck was a little salty.  Their sauce is meaty as one reviewer pointed out but it is way too sweet and had a pasty consistency when I dined there.  This is not how sauce or ""gravy"" is supposed to taste or at least what I am accustomed to.  Again, the menu, drinks, service, and the company were all fantastic and some portions of the meal were very good.  I just had an issue with the sauce and for me this is a core component of my Italian food experience."
