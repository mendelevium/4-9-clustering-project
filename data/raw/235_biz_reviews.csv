/user_details?userid=DlNz5SxdBYRaZ_pnyIxn6g,Rhonda B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This was my first eat-in restaurant meal since what seems like forever and I'm happy that my dear friend, who was celebrating her birthday was able to join me for a wonderful terrace lunch. Even though you're practically on René Lévesque, you are mostly sheltered from the noontime traffic. Our server Stéphanie was extremely helpful and we got outstanding service and solid recommendations. Started with cocktails (classic Margarita and a Vodka/Cran/watermelon/cointreau combo), both went down easily. Shared wedge salad, crisp iceberg, diced tomatoes, crispy bacon bits, ample blue cheese dressing, what you'd expect from a wedge salad done right. She had petit sirloin, came medium as ordered with fries. She said it was perfect. I had tuna tacos, quickly seared tuna dressed with some crunchy cabbage in an asian vinaigrette. A bit too heavy handed with the soy but the tuna was delicious. I was going to ask for the dessert menu but Stéphanie surprised us with a HUNK of home made mocha ice cream cake. She said due to covid, no candle. No matter. OMG the cake was so good. We both loved it. I'm so pleased to have chosen The Keg to celebrate a friend's birthday at."

You are then asked to go inside and give your name again and the hostess will give your table number to the waiter to seat you.It wasn't very busy which was nice not to loud and the lighting was nice and dim. Perfect ambiance.Our waiter JP was kind and very polite. We were suggested different types of drinks as well as whatSteak he suggested.We didn't eat all day so we decided to try a few appetizers (Baked Shrimp, Calamari and Bacon wrapped Scallops) Calamari: Awesome! The whipped feta dipping sauce and the Thai sweet chilli sauce were very flavourful and a niceChange from your regular marinara sauce. To my surprise it came with friend jalapeños slices which added a nice bit of heat to the dish.Baked shrimp:Shrimps were simple nothing that standsout enough to order them again. In fact the jumbo shrimps you can add on to your meals are cooked on the bbq and are way more delicious. Skip this and add a skewer on to you main.Bacon scallops: Scallops were basic not flavourful and the bacon taste was very generic and isn't out of this world. Again they aren't terrible but out of all the appetizers I tasted this didn't stand out to me.We decided on sharing the rib steak because we wereSo full from filling up on appetizers. It's a nice big piece of meat (10 oz).It came with a double bake potato and tomato with melted cheese and mushrooms. We decided to add on the shrimp skewer. Shrimp was on the bbq and had a great taste to them. I recommend added them on to any meal. Steak was cooked to perfection! Got it done Chicago style and took it medium and it was done perfectly. I will be back Just for that steak.Since it was a birthday they brought out a complimentary slice of ice cream cake. It was delicious and huge so it's enough for two people. Loved the toasted almond slices and caramel sauce.We had a great night and I can't wait to come back."
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"I usually think twice before rating a chain highly but the Keg consistently delivers great food in a class environment with great service which is hard to achieve.I've been to all of the locations (Fairview, PVM, old port) but my fave is PVM perhaps due to this being the one I've been to more frequently.I went last night for a bday dinner. We got seated in a comfy booth and quickly served water and warm bread with whipped butter.After selecting a bottle of Pinot noir red wine, we selected the lobster gratiné and tuna tartare appetizers. Both fantastic. For our meals, I got the 7oz filet mignon cooked perfectly (medium) along with the veggie gnocchi rémoulade (extra $3). Highly recommend this plate and side. For dessert I got to have some of the Billy Miner cake and it's excellent.I will continue to consider The Keg as a good choice for group celebrations. Love it!"

The service was great, good cocktails, amazing onion soup, and my rib steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. Very tender, good meat quality. I was so happy to go there. I ordered a B52 coffee that was not on the menu and they were very happy to do it for me. I will come back for sure."

It was right next door and extremely convenient We sat by the bar & ordered some cocktails along with cocktail shrimps! My friend literally only comes here for them! Can you imagine the LOVE here.. but now I know why!I was shocked at how delicious & fresh they were! We ended up ordered 4 orders & some sliders that I did not like at all! I've been to the keg a number of times and its definitely not my first choice for a steak house. Let alone eat a steak there. So I was pleasantly surprised when we had the shrimp! Which by the way .. its shrimps! Ya cant go wrong .. right?We then got our drinks , the gin basil lemonade was seriously delish! And I'll be coming for the shrimps AND basil gin! The service was literally so perfect, the girls are so down to earth and so friendly.The place has a nice low light setting vibe.. but at some point it gets annoying and I just want to turn all the lights on!! .. but I get it. Great location (west island) for parking & a little shopping before hand ;)"
/user_details?userid=XFGqNlqKAaaNFxrpkyMN5g,Rick B.,"Orland Park, IL",4 star rating,"This was a very nice steakhouse in downtown Montreal - in fact, it is right across the street from the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth hotel on Rene Levesque Boulevard. So if you are looking for a nice steakhouse just walking distance from this hotel - here it is.To begin, we each had drinks: one had a Boulevardier (3 star ok, but they really don't know what this is), another had an Amareto Sour (3 star ok), and the last had a glass of wine. All in all the drinks were just average - they don't go overboard with drinks. For example, the Boulevardier as served was in an Old Fashioned glass instead of the usual cocktail glass. They were close, but it is obvious that they don't have a specialty is these mixed drinks.For food, we started with an appetizer of cocktail shrimp (3 star nice, but nothing remarkable). For dinner, one in our group had the 20 ounce bone-in rib steak (4 star wonderful and perfectly done), another had the Homard Entier (5 star whole lobster, what's not to like when it is done so perfectly), and the last had prime rib (4 star wonderful). The potatoes were ok - both 3 star whether baked or mashed.While we had a number of wines with dinner, overall they were just ok and a bit over-priced ... i.e. we had a Chaptire for $20.50 Canadian and a Pesquie for the same price. The wines were nice, if a bit stiff in price. All in all the Keg was a very nice steakhouse. They know how to cook a steak, and they have a nice ambiance on the floor. Try it."
/user_details?userid=0dAclgpNIO90XCNwplkhmw,Sj C.,"Reno, NV",4 star rating,"Ambiance, service, food, and price point combine for a pleasant evening.  Staff works well as a team for a mostly seamless service.  Service does have a bit of a casual feel, but friendly and welcoming.  We had a reservation and were seated right away in a large comfortable booth.  Wedge salad was a good standard, cool, crisp, and flavorful, not skimping on the accoutrements.  Ciabatta style bread for the table was served warm with a crisp crust.  Steaks were good quality and cooked nicely, sauteed mushrooms come with peppers and other veggies like green beans, not a classic butter/garlic/wine mushroom, but delicious too.  The only thing I wasn't really satisfied with was the added on shrimp.  The shrimp seemed to be good, but not great quality.  Overall, a great experience and a lot of value as the pricing is very reasonable."

/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I finally made it to the keg after all these years hearing all the great reviews. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite what I expected after having been to some of the best steakhouses in Montreal. I went for lunch and had a steak that came with fries and Vegetables. I also went for the calamari. My friends ordered a burger and tacos. Overall the meal good but nothing to really rave about. Our waiter was really nice which was a plus. Ambiance wise, I found it a bit dark especially during lunch time. Convenient location  for a business lunch if you work in PVM do not want to leave the building. I can cross this place off my list but don't think I'll be back soon as the whole ""big American chains""concept doesn't really appeal to me."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"Had a wonderful lunch here on a sunny Friday afternoon. The terrace is really nice and is well isolated from the construction right out front. The inside is very dark so I do recommend eating outside if you can. I ordered the steak (it is a steakhouse) and got it medium rare, it was pretty good! It was well seasoned and was the perfect size for my lunch appetite (6oz). I got a caesar salad on the side and it was just ok. My friend ordered the tuna tartar (usually a entree but you can get a meal version) and it was delicious! I will be getting that next time for sure. It comes with lots of avocado and some cute chips to dip. The only downside is the service, it is so slow. Their lunch crowd was pretty much gone by the time I went (1pm) so not sure why it was so slow to get the menus, order, get the food, and pay."

/user_details?userid=JmEji3_Tfo2__69aLLcLPA,Jing S.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,"Situated in downtown Montreal, on Rene-Levesque street, this is a staple steakhouse. If you live in Montreal, you probably have heard of the Keg.The ambiance is always chill but fancy. I ordered their filet mignon with bacon wrapped around. Their steak is always good quality steak. I usually have my steak rare or sometimes medium rare and they cooked it to perfection; tender and juicy. It's never dry or chewy. You can have it with fries or baked potatoes. They have their twice baked potatoes which is very popular among customs; I personally prefer the fries.They have a few choices of wines to select from to go with your steak. It is obviously on the pricy side of things but it's totally worth it; from service down to food; everything is top notch. To paraphrase Gordon Ramsay's words: ""Whatever quality of steak it is, it's well past any form of good taste when you ask for it to be cooked well done."""

/user_details?userid=g_OACKYXoP_wDIvqXAoTSA,Ryan G.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"We came on a weekday evening with a reservation and were seated and served immediately. The bread was extremely soft and hot, I had to really control myself to not eat too much before my food came out. I ordered the filet (which is wrapped in bacon) medium rare and it was extremely tender. This was one of the softest steaks I have had and it was extremely flavorful. It also came with a sauce on the side that I enjoyed (although I'm not really sure what it was). I got the garlic mashed potatoes as my side and these were delicious too.Overall, this place is definitely worth it, as I have paid more and gotten way lower quality steak before. If I lived in Montreal I would be a regular here!"

/user_details?userid=zg0epjgoOGBoCG6tpYv0Dw,David S.,"Garfield, NJ",5 star rating,"The Keg Steakhouse was actually one of my highlights of my adventure out in Montreal. The decor and ambiance is upscale, the venue is huge with a lot of standing room, and I felt right at home here with my crew for our boy's wedding. One of their highlights was their selection of cocktails; I believe I had their version of the old fashioned and it was delicious. Plus, they do have a large wine selection so take advantage of that. When it came to the food though, it was top notch - I believe I had a ribeye or porterhouse or T-bone. Honestly, I don't remember what I had but I know it was at least 14 Oz because it was a large portion. They recommended that it be cooked medium and that's exactly how I had it. Sensational. I was so full of meat that I didn't need to touch whatever the side was! Hahahaha... I think it was gourmet mashed potatoes but don't quote. A restaurant says a lot when you don't remember what you had but you know how great you felt when eating the food.There was one snafu - it was a party of about nine of us and it took forever to get the steak out for two of our guys. After they realized the displeasure of the results, compounded with the place getting their order cooked wrong, they were able to rectify the two orders and give it up free of charge as an apologetic gesture. It was quite courteous of them. Anyway, if you're in town on a bachelor party, please make the Keg Steakhouse the spot to treat the Man of Honor. I would also recommend it as a great date spot as I saw many couples around us. Thanks for the memories, Keg!"
/user_details?userid=_4x70B1gvBmqqa9TzUamYA,Deborah C.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Marie-Ève was our server the night of July 23 and she was excellent!Husband and I both had prime rib. Ordered chicken strips for the kiddo but chicken breast came instead. Was totally okay because we hadn't ordered anything for our sleeping toddler and he ended up waking up and eating it. Staff swiftly got the chicken strips started and soon brought out a whole new plate, which kiddo said he really enjoyed (and does not often comment after the fact). Marie-Ève brought us ice cream for each boy which was super thoughtful. I'd say that was the best family meal of our trip. There was room for our stroller (which is a Pockit anyway), and we didn't feel rushed or cramped. I could actually nurse with space! Service was excellent, food met an expectedly high standard, and we felt very well taken care of. Bathroom facilities were excellent. Very clean and quite posh. We used the women's handicapped bathroom on the first floor as a family bathroom to take care of the kids for simultaneous diaper change and potty teamwork. Not an obvious family-friendly choice because of the price, but glad we made the decision to go! Plus, we had a six year old gift card to use up."

I thought that was so nice, and of course, had to return on my next visit to Montreal.We went for dinner and the experience was fantastic. No construction noise which was nice (seems like all of Montreal is under construction) and were seated promptly despite not having a reservation. Our waiter was very nice and explained some of the selections. I had a delicious peachy sangria and my dining partner had a local beer. We tried the escargot appetizer and it was very yummy. I loved the spices they used for it. For our mains, my partner went with a pistachio salmon that was deemed heavenly and I tried the baseball beef. I loved how they cooked it, even the char from the grill seemed to blend in perfectly. And, I can't say enough about their Asiago rice side. Divine. We were so full we had to pass on dessert but the list looked really good so we were very tempted. I'm glad my previous poor experience was just a one off as we really do enjoy visiting the Keg and totally recommend it if you're looking for an upscale place to eat while in Montreal that has delicious food, great ambiance and is within a reasonable budget."
/user_details?userid=ZkxBIUKuwrYjl2giguNs_g,Libby K.,"Falmouth, ME",5 star rating,"A pleasant surprise. Referred by a good friend and decided to give it a try. I was disappointed to find zero reservations on open table and opted to throw our name into the waitlist. I received a text within 5 minutes saying our table was ready. We quickly got ourselves together and walked .4 miles to the restaurant. I was concerned the table would be gone by the time we got there, however, we were seated after arriving....this was a fantastic solution to our dismay in regard to the reservation. Our waiter Jarred was FANTASTIC. He deserves 10 stars! Jarred asked if it was our first time at the restaurant and explained how the menu worked, his favorites, and any tips or suggestions. About 15 minutes after ordering I asked if I could change my side from the mashed potatoes to fries and he did so without hesitation when he could have easily said no. Waiters make restaurants like this great. He deserves praise and recognition. The food was all cooked perfectly. We ordered shrimp cocktail which is not show but was extremely fresh. The steak was cooked/seared perfectly. There was also a small side of vegetables which was a nice touch. The prices were reasonable. We enjoyed that is was a classy restaurant without being stuffy. Thank you to the cooks in the back who we never got the chance to meet but cooked an amazing dinner for my birthday."

It's a good place to hang out with family or friends and have a great steak dinner.  I would suggest the baked brie to start with or the calamari.  The Caesar salad is a bit disappointing.   I steakhouse needs a good Caesar.  I would suggest to management that they up their game here.  Today I had the NY Strip Peppercorn style.  Excellent!  Recommend you try the keg at least once and then decide for yourself."

/user_details?userid=VUS9-ABMF37mbHG5aMaaZw,Gabriella F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Now one of my favourite restaurants. To start we arrived at maybe 5:30 and were told we may be waiting for about 30 minutes already! It ended up being about 15 minutes but in the meantime we were brought 2 free entree tasters. The entire service was impeccable. I had the teriyaki sirloin in rare and my boyfriend had this special ""limited time"" menu, he got a steak with pesto and brie. Both were amazing and perfectly cooked. We had a side of rice pilaf, very good. We also took an entree of mushroom neptune and a small passionfruit creme brulee. Everything was absolutely divine. Although pretty expensive it was totally worth it and I am looking forward to going again. The ONLY negative point is that it was very loud, but there seemed to be some party going on near the bar."
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Ideal for lunch with colleagues or with a client ""The Keg"" is ideally situated at its downtown PVM location. The place is pure class with an incredible waiter service who are always attention and helpful. Service is pretty fast and on a special note... the waiting staff is ridiculously attractive. Not too sure about the guys but the women are smoking hot and dressed to impress. I'm totally a leg man so trust me... I did appreciate the view(s)!Anyways about the food, yeah? I went with their 8 oz sirloin steak and side Caesar salad. I found the steak decent but was more rare than medium rare. Not sure if it was cooked evenly but didn't feel like it. The myoglobin practically oozed from my steak so I expect the steak went from the fridge to the grill then once done was immediately transferred to the plate. I recommend letting meat rest at room temperature and to let it rest again on a wire rack once grilled rather than a plate to prevent one side steaming.Ultimately, I found the sirloin disappointing and it was nowhere close to how good I can make it at home. I've had far better items off their menu in prior experiences so I wouldn't have it again. The Caesar salad was decent but once again, had better. The dressing was somewhat bland. Where's the innovation? Make your dressing dressed to impress...like your lovely staff. ^.^For a franchise The Keg is better than what you'd expect but in more popular locations the experience can definitely differ.Price-tag is decent for a steakhouse. Which is surprising since the decor is gorgeous and the rent in such a location is probably ridiculously high.Everything being said, this was a positive experience but will try differently on consequent experience, if any."

The ambiance of the location is gorgeous, comfortable and is suitable for a group of friends or for a casual or romantic date. The location takes reservations and was very helpful in helping us do so. Furthermore the hostess and service staff was on the top of their game, consistently!Here's the most important part....the FOOD! We ordered a bunch of appetizers to start, including the escargot. I can say everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. One thing to note, the escargot is mixed with mushrooms so you will mostly taste the mushroom (if you haven't has escargot and want to try it for the first time, this might not be the best place but regardless, the APP is delicious!) The entree, ofcourse, was STEAK. I ordered the bone-in ribeye steak with a side of baked potatoe and bell peppers. Everything was cooked perfectly to order, was juicy and was delicious. Here is the final kicker....if you often go to top steak houses, you will know that steak can be a bit pricey. Typically aged bone-in ribeye steaks can range from $55-$90. This place had an amazing price if approximately $50 CAD. That makes the steak and overall dinner extremely affordable!If you are in Montreal, dedicated a dinner to this place. You won't be dissapointed."

The cesar salad was tasteful and rich. After that we order a steak which was prefectly cooked and flavorful. The sides were also very god. We also ordered the Salmon, was very delicious cooked perfect and the shrimp was very good. The sangria was a bit weak. But not the worse I've ever tasted."

I absolutely love this location, it's very chic and nice, but still fine to show up in jeans and a T-shirt. It's that kind of place where when you bring out-of-towners (or ur friends and family who've just not been here yet) and the immediate response upon entering is always: ""Oh, wow!"" It's an extremely popular place regardless of what day of the week it is. Chances are you will be invited to sit at the bar (free for anyone to grab a seat) with your lil electronic red light line disk thingy until a table is free. So do expect to be having cocktails and appetizers before your meal (and if you happen to luckily get a table right away, well then, tant mieux)!The food and drinks are pricey. But worth it. So extremely delicious, I've tried just about everything that's not seafood here and I recommend it all. In particular, I love the nachos with steak, i love their filet mignon, and i love their asparagus! The only thing that always bums me out is I always get an intense cheese craving when I come here, but there aren't any cheese platters nor any plates really covered in cheese (except nachos, obviously, but that's not the kinda cheese i mean). The only cheese available for the steaks is blue cheese and I'm not a fan. I really, really wish they had goat cheeses and okas and goudas available too. They do have a baked brie, however, and that's what I usually get when the craving is intense. The staff are very easy on the eyes and that's always pleasant too. They treat their regulars like friends, but still don't ignore the newbs. It can be a bit confusing as there is 2 entrances and 2 hostesses and no one actually stops you from walking right past them and wandering through the usually packed restaurant, but just approach a hostess and she'll take care of everything! I highly recommend this place as a must experience, at least once, while in Mtl (I know they have them elsewhere like another in Mtl and in Ottawa, for example, but trust me they ain't got sh*t compared to this exact location)."

I have the ""Meathead"" Yelp Badge for checking into so many steakhouses. Yet, I am giving this place five stars. And this steakhouse is in Montreal. Allow me to explain why:Food: it is extremely difficult to walk away dissatisfied with the food here, especially if you're from New York City. For $90, the two of us had steaks and one of us even had a perfectly cooked lobster tail. The restaurant may have gotten lots of feedback about flavor, because the steaks that came were perfectly marinated in my opinion, and the flavor was a source of great bliss. We did not have room for dessert, despite our mind wanting something sweet, our bodies simply said no. The portions here were quite large for a steakhouse in this French-speaking town.Service: I thought the French did not really care about service, but this place really wasn't bad. Sure, servers appeared colder than what I'm used to, but this is Montreal, it's cold around here. =).Decor: the place is a bit too dimly lit for my tastes. I'm 6 feet 2 inches tall and quite wide, but was bumped into by a server who didn't see me, likely because I was wearing dark clothing. I really hope to be back. What a treat."

However, I don't believe that the charm of The Keg in Old Montreal has transferred to the Place Ville Marie location, nor were they as hospitable or as friendly. This place is run like a well-oiled machine and we are simply part of the assembly line. When we, a party of four, were assigned a booth I requested a regular table. This seemed to be an incredible obstacle, even though there was one opening up right beside us. At this point I interjected, ""Do we have to specify that we want a table when making a reservation?"". We were then ushered all the way back to the entrance only to be brought right back to where we had been seconds before.The meat was cooked spot on, but the side dishes were miserable; a couple of green beans along with a minuscule dollop of garlic mash. And I strongly urge you to forgo the double backed potato as it is very salty. Despite all this, the wine list is extensive and affordable.To add insult to injury, they made a huge mistake on the bill by charging for the complimentary piece of birthday cake.This place is better suited for business people rather than birthday celebrations!"

Our waitress was a sassy little thing that my colleague took a shine to and shot his shot only to find out that she has a bf as I had already suspected. Beer was great. Ambiance was very fine too. Definitely coming back next time Im in Montréal!!

Taking out my gal for bday dinner and gave this place a try.  All was terrific.  Bartender made excellent cocktail recommendation-south am rum!  Yum!  Steak - lobster - sides all cooked perfectly and came out fast.  Service was excellent. This location a lil tough to find (Uber driver was lost) but we got there in time for reservation!  Nice comp bday pie was brought out too!

/user_details?userid=eY2ZgvK7gmUS_kUQWZYk9Q,Bo W.,"West Chester, PA",3 star rating,"Based on the steak alone this restaurant would definitely get a 4 or 5.  However when dinning out the experience can be greatly enhanced or hurt by everything else tangible and intangible that surrounds your main course. So starting the appetizers my traveling companion and I shared a bacon covered scallops and shrimp cocktail.  Both were pretty good although I found the cocktail sauce with the shrimp was a little bit sour and no enough heat Vs others I've had and I thought the scallops were a little dry.I had the melon mojito and it was ok, very refreshing but I could have sworn there was no alcohol in it but the server assured me there was.  I asked for another glass of wine when my steak arrived but it never came.Ok now that the ""bad"" is out of the way the steak is the true star of the show.  I had the peppercorn ny strip cooked to a perfect medium rare.  I had a side of asparagus and ofourse wished I had some wine but as mentioned before it never came.The service overall was a bit lacking.  I ran out of water a few times and did I mention my wine never came?  So final verdict,  steak was amazing but needs improvement on the drinks, apps, and service."

The steak was delicious. just wish they'd plate the steak on its own.

Given the cold night I opened with French onion soup while my wife had the Lobster Gratinee.  We both ordered the special, an amazing Kansas City steak with bone in which I must say was simply perfect.  Nice frites and sides too.  Naturally a fine Argentine Malbec helped to round off a perfect meal.  As the steak was so sumptuous and filling there was no space for desert.  One great thing about Keg is consistency; the server works with a Team which delivers flawlessly.  The food is great too!  One caution; though very centrally located, the Keg is obscured by ongoing construction in the surrounding area. But it's worth finding!"

My husband had the Canadian filet mignon and thoroughly enjoyed it! My daughter and I both had the prime rib sliders. They were a bit fatty but very good. The atmosphere here can't be beat!

/user_details?userid=Xvv0P_0B57LoyGrVHGG_8A,Tiffany D.,"West Chester, OH",4 star rating,"The Keg Steakhouse was descent. I have definitely had better food at steakhouses before. I'm not giving them 4 stars because of their food but because they have good service and accommodate their customers. I would rate their food 3-3.5 stars.To me the food was just ok, nothing special. They are pretty quick and get you in and out. My husband and I decided to come here for my birthday dinner. We made reservations and were sat as soon as we sat down but because it was a busy night we only had 2 hours at our table. This was plenty of time. We started our night with an appetizer which was the Baked Garlic Shrimp. It was good. Nothing to complain about here. Along with the appetizer we were served some bread. It was pretty good. Typical bread from a restaurant. Now it was time to order our entrees. I ordered the Bacon Wrapped Chicken and my husband ordered the Supreme Chicken. I didn't really get to enjoy my food like I wanted to. First I asked to have the slaw cabbage substituted for Brussel sprouts in which I was told I couldn't and had to order a side of Brussel sprouts. When my chicken was brought out it had a piece of hair laying on the top of it. I immediately called the waitress back over and told her.  She took the plate back and the manager came out and said that they were making me more chicken and he was sorry for what had happened. I was served my side of Brussel sprouts to munch on while waiting on my new chicken. Needless to say about 20-30 min later my new chicken came out. At this point I really wasn't as hungry. It also looked as if the chicken had been cooked fast as they were trying to get it out to me so it had places that were shiny and didn't looked fully cooked. I am very picky about the way my meat looks and is cooked as I have had food poising before and it lead to pancreatitis and 10 days in the hospital. I DO NOT play about my food temperatures. Also the chicken was supposed to be stuffed with asiago cheese and it wasn't. OOHH and when my dish came out it was served with the Brussels sprouts I initially asked to sub to in the first place but was told I couldn't. The chicken wasn't that good and lacked seasoning. The mashed potatoes were descent. Overall I just didn't get to enjoy my meal. My husband enjoyed his meal, but had the same thoughts as me. It wasn't bad but we have had better steakhouse food. After dinner we ordered the brownie and ice cream and they put candles on it for my birthday. The brownie and ice cream was actually good and we shared and enjoyed it together.Overall, the food at The Keg wasn't anything special BUT the customer service was good. The reason I gave them 4 stars was because when my meal was brought out with hair on it the manager came out to address the issue and told us my meal would be on the house. Also, they do not do anything special for birthdays or free desserts. However, if I remember correctly (this was 2 months ago.. Yes I'm late posting this review, I know. I'm also preggo and can't remember anything, lol) my dessert was also on the house because they messed up my meal. I think we only had to pay for my husbands meal and the wine he had. Although the food wasn't anything to brag about I must give credit where it is due and they do have great customer service when mistakes are made."

I had the filet mignon, which was cooked perfectly to order and was wrapped in bacon. To start, our server brought out bread and three-cheese butter, a specialty of theirs. My only true complaint- and it is minor -is the dryness of the caesar salad. This was probably my least favorite part of a top-notch meal.Our waiter was spectacular. Very charming and attentive, with a great knowledge of the food and wine menus. He was conversational and endeared us to the restaurant from the beginning.The drinks we ordered were all well-proportioned and well-priced, and our meals were similarly generous. The price tag may turn some people off of the restaurant, but you really don't get much more quality for the price you're paying."

And a large portion.  My husband got the fried chicken listed under ""casualPlates"" and really enjoyed it. Only disappointment was the wine menu. All the wine was overpriced for the brands.

The restaurant's decor and ambiance is great. Very classy. The bathroom could have been cleaner (there was water all over the counter).Our waiter (Patrick) was friendly and helpful. He was a little too helpful and present at the beginning and nowhere to be found towards the end. His presence could gave been more balanced, but it's not his fault-he's new.I had the escargot-it was good, but I've had better. It definitely wasn't worth $11.I had the top sirloin with Asiago rice. The steak was really good, but the rice was disgusting (probably not the best place to order rice). My other options of baked or mashed potatoes didn't seem like anything special. I usually finish my food, but this rice was unfinished by the end of the meal. My wife wasn't too impressed by her salmon, but my son loved his ribs. Overall, The Keg is okay if you've got the money to spend (or waste), but if they wish to continue charging what they charge, for their menu, they definitely need to step up their game."

The Keg at PVM is just over rated because it's convenient for people to go directly after work. The sirloin steak and prime rib steak are always too salty than it should be. Most of the times, if you order a steak at medium rare, what happened to me always, that the steak became out medium (over cooked).Salmon filet not recommended for this price. I personally find that people going to this place aim at its ambiance and conveninence, not the new food quality nor the price."

We got there around 6pm on a Friday night and it was busy but there was no wait, which was great. Walking to our table in the dining room we couldn't help commenting on how dark it was- almost too dark.The menu looked amazing and they had a nice wine list. I ordered an Italian red and it was delicious. The only potential downside to the wine experience is that the waiter didn't give me a small pour to taste first, he just filled my 9oz glass. Had I not been happy with the wine it would have been an awkward situation to send it back after a full pour- but in this case it was fine.  Neither one of us were starving and the starters looked incredible so we decided to split two starters and an entree. Our starters were the calamari (which came with a Thai dipping sauce and a feta dipping sauce which were equally good and we couldn't stop alternating) and the tuna tartare (which was served with avocado was super fresh and not at all saucy). We were so happy with the starters that we couldn't wait to get our entree which was the bacon wrapped chicken stuffed with asiago.The entree is the reason this got 4 stars not 5. The chicken was dry and there was a very thin layer of cheese on the bottom of the chicken that was undetectable unless you were examining the chicken for the cheese. This is a steakhouse so next time I come here I'll skip the chicken and try the steak, but I was disappointed with the chicken dish. The sides were good with the chicken (potatoes and asparagus purée) but weren't enough to save the dish."

I ordered a Rusty Nail, a cocktail which I think saw it's hay day in the 1920s, and though she admitted not being overly familiar with it, mixed up a very enjoyable one just the same. My wife asked for a Bloody Mary and though the place was busy for a 2-3pm weekday she took the time to ask my wife if she wanted a Bloody Mary of a Bloody Caesar, explaining the difference. Since the Bloody Caesar uses Clamato and my wife has a shellfish allergy she went with the Bloody Mary.The place has a dark interior, fire in the fireplace, very romantic in my opinion and would make an excellent spot for a special date.

The food was absolutely delicious, you get what you pay for and more. The service was amazing. My boyfriend and i sat at the bar while we waited for our table but decided just to eat at the bar instead. Best decision. The bartenders; i believe their names were Ben and Marie, were absolutely amazing. They went above and beyond. Quick service, we never had to wait long for anything. They bartenders were fun and gave us a piece of cake and shots for my birthday. The manager came over and talked to us after, he was also a very pleasant man.

/user_details?userid=UIYekmecs_Sb3MQdUmFGXg,Garett W.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"One of the great lies of Canadian society is that all Kegs are good. I mistakenly fall into a sort of self-induced sleepwalking state of hunger for steak every so often, and forgetting how bad the Keg really is, I give this location a try every 12-15 months.While I cannot isolate what sodium-based preservative is being used in the kitchen as a flavour enhancer or preservative, I am guessing it is STPP, sodium tripolyphosphate.  The level of sodium in the food here is beyond mere seasoning, and significantly stronger than MSG.I ordered the blue cheese filet with a side of king crab legs.The meat arrived with what appeared to be a slice of boiled bacon wrapped around it. The meat itself was mushy, not tender, just mushy, as if the protein had been artificially broken down.The sodium in the meat scalds and numbs the mouth by the second bite.  The crab legs smelled of ammonia.I was massively dehydrated for 10-12 hours after eating what little I could.I did not have a bad experience at the Keg in T.O. or Vancouver, so this must be a problem with this location. If you do go here, please inform the wait staff that you will send the steak back to the kitchen if it is over salted. They may have another recommendation."

I ordered the white wine sangria and my friend ordered a peach cocktail. Both were sooooo delicious. For my meal, I ordered the Thai chicken, with a side of mashed potatoes. It was fantastic!

I usually order the filet mignon, butterflied, medium rare. Fortunately, it usually comes to my plate just the way I like it. Perfectly cooked, butter knife tender, and very flavorful.The prices are reasonable, decor is warm steakhouse, and service and servers are definitely above average for Montreal.I'm generally not a fan of restaurant chains, but this particular Keg is one of my go-to steakhouses."

Washrooms were interesting though, they were upstairs, had to climb a flight of stairs to get to them. Parking was pretty convenient, had to park on the street, but it's Downtown and wasn't too far of a walk. I ordered the Baseball Top Sirloin. The reason why it's called a baseball is because it's very thick and shaped like a....baseball! So thick that they can only cook it to rare or medium rare, no well done! You start off with your choice of a salad, I opted for the Caesar Salad. I felt that they put wayyyy too much dressing on that salad and very little croutons, so the salad was too salty for my liking. The Keg dish comes with a side of veggies and sautéed mushrooms and a side to go with it, but since it's the Keg, you gotta order the twice baked potato.

I recommend the Rib steak, medium rare with the twice baked potato. It's basically a stuffed baked potato that has chives bacon and sour cream mashed into it. The best part of the steak was the seasoning. Even if you are a purist I think you should give this one a try! It works! Only thing I think they can improve on is dessert. All the choices seemed kind of standard, like there was nothing I felt like I had to have Or couldn't get elsewhere. For all I know it could have just been a third party delivery service. It did taste like one.The service was great too. They had an hr long wait for 5 people, when we got there so we just went to the bar to have a few drinks and one of the managers said he would get us a table right away. We were seated before we even finished the drink.Over all go there for the steak and drinks, skip the dessert.

My friend had a combo, steak w/ king crab legs, the crab leg never came out. We complained to the manager, at first he questioned us ""when did u first sit down? How long did it take u to order ?"" I believe he questioned us because he didn't believe it took an hour for our food to come out. In the end, he was very apologetic, and gave us a round for free shots and comped my friends meal.

They do not take reservations on fridays or saturdays nor special event days. Waiting time for an average evening is usually 30 mins to an hour. You can either hang at the bar while you wait or I would suggest sitting outside, or right below in the Pace Ville Marie mall, there are some comfortable seats near the food court.I usually get a filet mignon or other tender cut of meat along with baked potato, cesar salad. Meat is always cooked just right and seasoned perfectly. Their filet mignon truly feels like butter. For appetizers, I''ve tried their garlic butter shrimps, with melted cheese on top - comes in a cute little plate, absolutely delicious. They also serve a basket of warm bread for every table which I love. Bread is so soft and warm, butter melts right on it. There are other pricey steakhouses that do not serve bread so this is a detail that sets The Keg apart.If you're in the mood for desert but don't know what to pick, they have a sampler of 3 different things, cake, mouse and creme brulee. All are very good.The Keg is always a good choice for a date or special occasion, it's delicious food, great service, superb ambiance and location."

I asked if the ""mushrooms neptune"" (mushroom caps with crab and cream cheese served with fresh bread) were good and she said they were delicious so I ordered that as an appetizer.  The mushrooms neptune were ok, but not as good as I'd expected.  The cream cheesy crab filling and the fresh bread were good, but the mushrooms themselves were absolutely tasteless.  I had also ordered their iceberg wedge salad during my first few ravenous minutes at the restaurant because, like I said, I was starving and the description of it ""tomatoes, crispy smoked bacon, buttermilk ranch or Bleu cheese dressing"" made my mouth water.  The salad could've been great, but the bleu cheese dressing was tasteless so I was pretty disappointed in that as well.For my main meal I ordered what I order at steakhouses in the states, a filet mignon with a stuffed baked potato.  I ordered everything at the same time so my eyes were bigger than my stomach when I decided to order SO MUCH FOOD but I told myself that I could take whatever I was unable to finish back to my hotel to eat later.  With that being said, I decided to order the larger 10 oz ""bacon wrapped"" filet mignon.  I also asked for a side of marinated mushrooms because I really enjoy them with my steaks at home.  The steak was disappointing.  I have never had bacon wrapped steak before, but at Keg it did nothing to enhance the flavor of my steak.  It came with barely cooked red and green peppers.  There were absolutely NO juices flowing from my steak, ZERO.  Just a slightly moist juiceless steak with an overwhelming smell of undercooked red and green peppers wrapped in fatty inedible bacon.  My mushrooms were not anything like the sauteed mushrooms I order at home, they were about as bland and blah as the mushrooms neptune mushrooms, no flavor whatsoever! I ate a portion of my potato and some of my steak and asked my waitress if I could take the rest ""to go"" and if I could please have the check.  At home, every restaurant I've been to brings ""to go"" boxes or containers out to ME and has me put my food in them to take home, but my waitress took my food in the back to box it for me in the kitchen.  At the time I was pleased with the friendly service even if the food was disappointing so when I got the hefty check I gave her a generous tip.The next afternoon when I heated up my food I realized that my waitress had tossed out my barely eaten stuffed baked potato and the barely eaten sauteed mushrooms that I had paid extra for as a side.  That annoyed me because I had been looking forward to the potato to accompany my bland steak.  Later that day I opened my laptop to search for places to go that evening and to figure out where I was going to eat dinner.  The Keg steakhouse menu was still open on my laptop from the day before.  It was at that time that I became really ticked off because I realized that the wedge salad and the sauteed mushrooms which I had paid EXTRA for came WITH my meal under the section ""Keg Classics"".  I had only looked at their ""Steak and Prime Rib"" page and didn't think to look further.  Had I turned the page I would've seen the section ""Keg Classics"" which listed the 10 oz filet bacon wrapped filet mignon with baked potato AND sauteed mushrooms AND wedge salad for $43. My waitress withheld this information from me and charged me $40 for my 10 oz bacon wrapped tasteless filet mignon with baked potato, an extra $5 for the tasteless bland sauteed mushrooms AND an additional $9 for the tasteless wedge salad.  Wow.  I can politely overlook a bland overpriced meal, but I consider what she did to be dishonest, which is why I feel the ONE STAR minimum that I have to give them with this review is extremely generous."

Don't expect a huge list of wine outside of American selections - definitely ask the waitress which one would be right for you because they did run out of a few bottles when I went. I only gave this location 3 stars because the service wasn't up to par.

The customer service is amazing. Any issue you have they will compt or give at a discount. ""The customer is always right"" seems to be the motto here for sure.The PVM one is a cool urban vibe with great atmosphere, huge patio, and awesome bars. I prefer the Old Port location a bit better, but love he PVM location. I like to go to both and switch it up! Steaks are always cooked great. I order mostly the Rib steak Chicago style Blue rare. Always Cooked perfect.The apps are amazing. Bacon wrapped scallops, or calamari is amazing. Twice baked potato is great.  And ceaser salad are all my favorties.If you've been before, or never been. You'll go and surely realise this is the top contender and best steak house restaurant that is a chain, that doesn't feel like it. Different locations with different decore help achieve this. Every dollar spent feels worth it. Bills csn get pricey.  But i never leave feeling ripped off.Good job Keg. Never disappointed! !"

You would have to be crazy to order anything else.  The only thing that annoyed me about this place is that they tell you don't need a reservation, but don't mention that you will probably have to sit outside.  Steak is so temperature dependent I found myself rushing it eat it before the breeze made it cold.  On the plus side some of the tables out side have awesome leather couches that a super comfortable to sink into after a big meal.  Major bonus.  On a warm night outside gets five stars all the way.

/user_details?userid=boi3nsxTJNQoTvjNly0fkw,Paul L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Location is key for this iteration of the Keg formula. I went on a Sunday night...no hockey game, all the shops closed, the downtown core almost empty with a minus 25 chill blowing through the PVM plaza, yet at 5:30 a 45 minute wait for a table. Luckily, my companions arrived at 5:15 and already had a table. (They don't take reservations). Swanky is a good word for the vibe, but the clientele doesn't reflect that particular feeling. It was more like Howard Johnston's family crowd, understandable for a early Sunday dinner. I get that they pull people from the Queen E Hotel across the street. Still, the low light, minimalist decor, and the lovely young women in little black dresses create a certain cognitive dissonance for one's dinning experience.As for the food, two out of four orders at the table scored big disappointments. My Keg Classique sirloin was blue when ordered medium rare and was sinewy. I had to cut it as thin as possible to not end up with a sore jaw. On a positive note, the pepper whiskey sauce was very tasty. The Kansas City cut ended-up on my host's plate in a mangled mess. He remarked to the waiter that the butcher needed to be replaced. I don't know if it was the providence of the beef or its preparation or lack thereof, but it's been a while since I worked so hard to eat a piece of steak.The well-adorned baked potato was a welcome respite from my laboured mastication.The ""sorry about that"" came to the table in the form of a comped piece of the ice cream cake. It was delicious. The blueberry tea was served with Black tea instead of Orange Pekoe which changes the taste considerably...it was reported that either the Amaretto or the Grand Marnier was missing.The service is professional and the process of getting dinner was great, but the product I was served left quite a bit to be desired."

We came in here on a nice cool day in early September. We were greeted by the waitress and she was very nice and polite and she took us to our table. We got some bread to start off along with some butter, it was unbelievable, very soft inside and crunchy outside- the whipped butter was very good and light as well. We ordered, we had a nice gentlemen take our order, he was very polite and accepted every request we have given. We ordered a Caesar salad to start off with, and I ordered a 12oz Steak with fries and fresh veggies and my Grandparents order a prime rib appetizer to share. We got the salad and it was delightful with great dressing, tender lettuce, and nice garlic croutons type bread. It was very good. Then we got our food, As I took my first bite into my steak, I immediately realized that it was cooked to my request ""well done"" but yet had so much flavor and spices that it blew my mind. I gave my grandparents a bite and they loved it, even my grandmother who was not much of a red meat person, liked it. The fries were very good, as well as the fresh veggies. My grandparents tried the prime rib sliders and said it was very good. They had horse radish, fried onions and some sauce to go along with it. Very good. Overall, it was very good and the interior was nice as well, can't wait to go back soon! Thanks!"

I tried some of my friend Tartar, it was ok, not impressed either. I am not sure if the waitress is new but not the best service either. The sequence of appetizer and main dish wasn't coordinated. We never got offered another bottle of water and it took us a while to get her attention to get coffee. I understand the lunch rush is a bit stressful but if you are going to charge a high price you better deliver on it.

Round #2, the steak was cooked very rare and hubby specifically ordered medium-rare. He got only a couple accompanying vegetables (it was embarrassing), yet the first dish with the blue cheese had a huge portion of veggies. THEN, later on he discovered a fruit fly in his glass of wine.At this point he felt obligated to say something b/c our experience was deteriorating.... and fast. We weren't able to eat together because of the dish error and the wine fly grossed him out. We asked for the Manager & thankfully she handled the situation well. She apologized and they paid for my hubby's meal and wine. Third time - FAIL (but not for me), hubby's steak was not cooked to his full satisfaction. It was too rare. He said next time we're going to Gibby's. LOL! I always order the Chicken Oscar @ The Keg and I always like it."

It's obvious why they are so well-known for their steaks; they cook them to perfection, and on the rare occasion they don't get it to your specifications, they gladly take it back and redo it. I took my boyfriend for dinner as a treat, because I'm usually always on the ""receiving end"" when it comes to dinner out. This is the 21st century after all! I normally get the New York strip steak, medium rare, with a plain baked potato, but alas I was not in the mood for red meat on this particular night (a rarity, really). Also, I didn't want to break my calorie bank! I opted for the teriyaki chicken with pineapple salsa, accompanied by a plain baked potato and grilled veggies. I've had teriyaki chicken elsewhere and was a little hesitant because a lot of times grilled chicken breast come out dry in most restaurants. Knowing that The Keg normally does grilling quite masterfully, I went with it. I was really glad I trusted my gut; the chicken was delicious and juicy, the side sauce was the perfect balance of sweet and salty and the veggies were grilled perfectly. I was pleasantly delighted and definitely recommend this dish to someone looking for a steak alternative at The Keg!"

Dessert was also fantastic with an ice cream-based chocolate cake. Service excelled with friendliness abounding.  All around - the place should probably get 5 stars, but I will deduct a star for unnecessarily loud pop music being piped throughout the place."

After one phone call I found out they didn't take reservations, but did do priority seating and would do their best to accommodate us and accommodate they did. We had an excellent table, 2 outstanding servers and some excellent food. No idea who Billy Miner is, but he has some damn good pie named after him.

Real Lime Juice and well balance ; most of the time, in restaurant they try to cheat to save money by serving some concentrated lime juice. Then ordered a bottle of wine. They have a large selection of wine and a full bar selection.I took some Crab and goat cheese with some light nacho Then my main course was a Baseball surloin cut - blue - with potatoes and Aspargus and mushroom. You build up your plate the way you want and chooses what you want. approximatly 100$ per person if you drink (appero and Bottle of wine)  take an Entree and a Desert.NB: Weird fact: the Bathroom was amazing; lot of cool modern-art design, heavy wood door, large mirror."

We came here pretty late Sunday night and they seemed to be accommodating as the kitchen was about to close in 30 minutes so we put in our orders as quickly as possible before they close. Obviously it was Sunday night towards midnight so the crowd definitely died down and basically just a few occupied tables plus some bar people. The waitress was extremely easy on the eyes who was tall, overall great body and not butter-face. She was a bit more talkative than we expected but we let her get away with it since she was hot enough. Anyways before I deviate, we order some small appetizers and a few pints of Ricard's Red beer to go with our steak as I order the NY Striploin medium rare. The steak was pretty good and the side toppings of mushrooms and half a tomato was also pretty good. So overall, very good experience and definitely would visit again on my next trip to Montreal."

They not only apologized for our previous experience, but when we arrived, unexpectedly (during the second to last Habs game), we were promptly seated. It was a bit chilly, and the manager personally ensured that not only was the gas lamp turned on and working properly, but also made several good suggestions for menu items. Our server handed us French menus and seemed a bit frazzled, but considering how busy it was, it could be expected and excused. The steaks were done quite well, though the kitchen staff put the 'seafood topper' on the wrong steak (not a problem, it was corrected immediately, before the plates were placed in front of us).

/user_details?userid=zIOxNinC6ofIwwGjO9rUWg,David D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Ah The Keg. My first foray in the madness of steakhouse fanboyism. It's The Keg, was is there to say? Most Montrealers and Torontonians are familiar with it as each city has more than a few franchises. And there's the rub... franchises, meaning that everything is designed to please everyone as much as possible. Very dark and masculine decor, because let's face it, the steak obsessed are mostly men, though I know a few women who worship steak like I do. And since this is mostly a man's obsession, the service is all female and by female, I mean insanely hot women and by insanely hot women, I mean you'll forget your own name hot. Well at least in the lounge area. The dining area has more elegant women dressed in a more classical outfits. I like slutty women as much as the next guy but I always prefer elegance over sluttiness; a woman wearing a tailleur is sexier than a woman with a skirt so short it qualifies as a belt, but I digress.Again this was the first Steakhouse experience I've had and back then it was a glorious experience in steak obsession. But since then I've travelled and tried Steakhouses all over North America so The Keg sort of lost its shine and on 3 occasions my bill remained unpaid for ruining my steak. But they deliver a better than decent steak with tasty side dishes. They often have specials with their steaks, such as a New-York strip topped with Boursain cream cheese and chipotle chutney, which was amazing.All the mixed drinks come in Keg sizes as well as regular, getting you drunk fast and that bartender is often well qualified and delivers very good drinks such as Tom Collins, Long Islands, and the sort. The deserts are the boring usual suspects expected of chain restaurants but are delicious none the less. It's a great place to enjoy affordable well prepared steaks with groups or office lunches and so forth but fails to be my go to steakhouse when I want to rock my palate with an awesome steak.4 stars for what it is. If I were judging just the steak, I'd give it a 3-stars."
