/user_details?userid=F7Lo6cRfB7geXeN9VSS1Mg,Jason N.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,Nice cozy little restaurant. First time having Russian cuisine and decided to come with the wife to try it because of all the five start reviews on yelp. The food here is certainly delicious. All the dishes that we shared was perfect. We were the only ones in the restaurant so we got a lot of personal attention. Definitely will return.

It was like being in someone's kitchen in Russia.  They treated us to their sherbet with vodka, on the house, because they felt guilty that the service was slow but that is normal with such a big group.  If you want to try Real and Good food you must try this place!"

For starters we ordered soups, classics borscht and solyanka, both delicious. Main courses were duck with orange sauce and deer steak with porto sauce. Again, both excellent. Desserts we chose my old times favourite napoleon cake, just love it. Very happy with the experience and would definitely recommend!"
/user_details?userid=MzVRoK6_hlm8FtVn9XLYuw,Daisuek U.,"Fairview, OR",5 star rating,"Old school Russian and classic European kitchen. Something that one may have to travel outside of western Europe to experience in terms of European cuisines these days. As for Russian part, I knew it was real the moment I smelled the pickled cucumbers that came with my chilled vodka. Nothing like smelling the honest pickled cucumber after a shot of vodka. Oh, the bread is real (vodka friendly) as well. The best Beef Stroganoff I've ever had, and I've had them all over the world including even Tokyo. Genuine Russian hospitality. Love this place!"

Not only was the food succulent, and freshly prepared but the service was outstanding. A warm welcome, nice touches all throughout the evening and great music. I highly recommend Ermitage."

/user_details?userid=bVEQOCwSOlaCNIBHWRPfHA,Adeline C.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"We were recommened to this restaurant by one of clients from NYC.  We were not thinking eating Russian in Montreal but we did because she insisted that it is as good as it gets.  First it is not in the tourist area but by driving it took us 10 mins from our hotel in downtown.  We meet one of the owners Gala, she mends the front and her husband is the chef.  She was great and we ordered the gastronome menu because it has everything we can taste.  She suggested that we share because of its portion.  It was great because it was just perfect.  Everything was so refine and tasty and we live in Brooklyn and we never even been to a reputable Russian restaurant that does not involve a cabaret.  So it was so great to eat and enjoy the food.  We loved it so much that we went back 2 days later!  It has to be the best meals we had in Montreal and the price is right!  We went to Toque, Au Pied de Cochon, L'Express and many others but this is by far the best.  Please make your way to this lovely neighborhood restaurant that's great price and great food."
