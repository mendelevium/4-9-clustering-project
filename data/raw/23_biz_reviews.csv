So I decided I'll be trying to put my enforced isolation to good use by updating some of my very old reviews and this is a doozy - the original review is from 2011! I have eaten here A LOT since then and had the opportunity to have Omnivore do some catering for an event and I have honestly really enjoyed all my interactions with this awesome local business. Friendly, helpful, chill, funny, affordable and always just so tasty and healthy, you feel great after. Definitely take advantage of their takeout counter or delivery options if you can for sandwiches or big delicious combo platters and juices to boost your immune system (or use as delicious mixer for home mixology, your choice.)"
/user_details?userid=5QrlMMzUq_RoUlEyH2zcig,Judy K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,A little sad I think they changed their khodra recipe. Still good but something I can't put my finger on has changed. New location is beautiful and much bigger. They have a section for take out only and then a section for eat in and I believe they do table service now. Still Love this place !!

/user_details?userid=iOSH-rBKanYUBuEEabUTNQ,Julia P.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"This is a great casual spot for Mediterranean food--you order at the counter, but they'll bring the food to your table. We tried all 3 combo platters, and my favorite was the vegetarian option (which lets you select salads/Mezze of your choice), but the chicken kebab was also remarkably moist and flavorful! Highly recommend for a high quality, affordable, casual meal."
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place has been on my list for quite some time. It's a hole in the wall with very few seats and fast food style. We ordered a omnivore (5 mezzes) and carnivore dish ( 3 beef brochettes).  We had the tabbouleh, falafel, orzo salad, kibbeh and the string bean salad. Everything was super yummy except for this string bean salad that had ginger. It simply does not blend well with middle eastern food since it wasn't such a subtle taste. I would recommend to stay away from the string bean salad if you don't like ginger.It's easily 40$ for two people and fast food and the seats aren't the most comfortable. I would go back again to satisfy my Lebanese craving when I'll be in the area."
/user_details?userid=OAUd0tO-xINwkgnpthIbVA,Michael B.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This cheery cafe-style restaurant was a nice discovery during a brief Montreal visit - delicious food, friendly service, light ambiance, decent portions and inexpensive. My dining companion and I both enjoyed Omnivore platters with chicken grilled perfectly, juicy and flavorful.  The rice and lentils had nice texture and a hint of cardamom that nicely balanced the intense flavor of the garlic sauce.  The hummus was fresh and flavorful as well.  The salad was nice,  although I prefer about half as much dressing.  I definitely recommend this place for a delicious inexpensive meal.  Just ask them to go easy on the dressing and warm the pita."
/user_details?userid=7xne1rJBqzW7NEosaCn1JA,Emilee W.,"Stone Canyon, Round Rock, TX",5 star rating,All I have to say is WOW. Omnivore was my first Mediterranean food experience and I was thoroughly impressed. The restaurant was warm and inviting with cool decorations!Everything came out so quickly. I got a combo meal that came with an sandwich + salad + lemonade. I got the Inca sandwich that was super flavorful and had a yummy guacamus sauce (guacamole and hummus mixture). It was paired with a fatouche salad that was light and had a variety of spices that were very flavorful. The meal came with a refreshing lemonade that was so unique! We also got a side of delicious potatoes that came with a dipping sauce that I could not stop eating. Plus they had a chill music playlist! Marc was our waiter and he was very helpful in helping us decide we wanted! Overall 10/10 and I can't wait to go back!

We ordered the omnivore plate with the chicken option, baba ganouj and a plate of three salads : carrot salad, cauliflower salad and the okra in a tomato sauce. Everything was great! Their hommos and baba ganouj were well made. The staff knew immediately how to make the dishes gluten free without me having to specify. This place is great for a quick bite or take out.

I'm sure the food is even better when you eat it there. The chicken was so juicy! That surprised me because chicken tends to get dry if you wait too long to eat it or when you get delivery. The beef was good too but I preferred the chicken. Even the fattouche salad was delicious! The dish also came with lot of hummus, baba ghanoush, and garlic sauce. I will definitely order from here again! Highly recommend! The portions are big too! My boyfriend and I had leftovers which I ate the next day!"

It was busy but not crazy and this place is a fast casual type environment. You order and pay up front and they bring the food out to you once it's ready. We ordered the omnivore with beef and I got the carnivore with beef and chicken. The platters came with hummus, eggplant dip, and mine came with the garlicky dip too. Boo Boo's platter didn't come with the garlicky one. Hands down this place our dinner was the best food we had this short trip in Montreal. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We also more pita bread without having to ask for more at the front.Credit card accepted"

The ground Chicken Kebab/Brochettes here is easily my favorite dish during our week long trip to Montreal!In the Omnivore version, it is served with a side of salad, hummus, and rice. It was so delicious that we decided to  pack the wraps for the plane on our trip home. We also packed the Hummus and Baba Ghanouj but they were confiscated at the airport! Thank God they spared the kebab wraps as they were the most perfect bites ever!"
/user_details?userid=SwMNEMGeZPggDTmEMij2Fw,Sophia M.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,The interior is spacious and modern. Good service just a little bit slow.

Super cheap very high quality tasty food , you really cant go wrong. The location itself was not huge but there are a few tables to sit and eat on the spot. The decor is very cozy and quaint. It seemed like more people were there to pickup takeout though. We shared an order of vine leaves and Kebbe to start. The vine leaves were okay, they were huge and tasted decent but I wasnt overly impressed by them. The Kebbe however, was sooooooo good ! It was stuffed with the most delicious spinach, I couldnt get enough of this. The sandwiches we ordered were the Beef Roma sandwich and the beef Beirut sandwich , both were outstanding. The beef was so juicy and the pita was so well grilled, all of the toppings were so fresh and tasty. My favourite of the two was the Roma sandwich though , I found the flavours more pronounced. I really recommend this place for a quick bite to eat , you will not be disappointed !"

It's a cute little family owned middle eastern food joint. It's not your typical sit-down restaurant. You stand in the line to order your food. You can either take it to go or sit there if there's any space available. The food portions are quite generous. Absolutely loved their baba ghanouj! It comes with pita bread so no need to order it separately. For my main, I ordered the chicken plate. Everything was beyond delicious. Yummy middle eastern food - check!"

We went there for lunch and had a herbivore plate (4 salads and babaganoush) and a sandwich (chicken). The salads were tasty and well dressed, not oily at all. The sandwich wrap was very thin and perfectly grilled.  The place is nicely decorated with plants. You order your food at the counter and they bring it out for you. The person helping us was very helpful. The service overall was above and beyond what you expect in this price range. I look forward to going back."
/user_details?userid=VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw,WhiteFeather H.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"Ok, fair warning: this place is FREEEEZING in the winter. Even with the heat cranked, it's so cold that you won't see anyone dining without winter coat still on. The problem? Huge, beautiful front sliding windows with NO insulation. Great for the summer, but...They have delicious homemade lemonade with rose water, but I'd recommend getting tea to help keep you warm. Yes, it's that bad.My date and I had two kinds of kafta, a traditional Leb sandwich, but my Lebanese-Cypriot manfriend said they aren't really prepared traditionally but like more of a fusion for North Americans. The kibbeh was very good but I had to agree that the kafta did leave a little to be desired. I tried the Inca and fatouche combo. Fatouche was really good. Honestly, I've had better Lebanese food not far from this spot. I'm sure it's a great summer hangout, though!"

I ordered the Omnivore plate which is a choice of grilled chicken or beef, fatouche salad, lentil rice and hummus and garlic paste.I would recommend ordering an Almaza to drink, a Lebanese beer and a personal favourite of mine."
/user_details?userid=gPutIn3JgUQyVBLOeilXEA,Louisa K.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",3 star rating,"$7 for a wrap isn't terribly expensive but I expected them to be a bit bigger. They are long but thin and might not fill you up if you're really hungry. As a combo with a fresh juice it's $10 but be aware that it's very carrot-heavy and possibly not to everyone's taste.The meat in every sandwich can be replaced with a vegetarian alternative. The SAMAC sandwich with the veggy option was very tasty. The only originally vegan sandwich, the KHODRA, is not well balanced in flavour. It's quite bland and unexciting.I liked the vibe and decoration of the place so I might give Omnivore another try. Maybe the $11 combo of sandwich + salad + drink will make it a more satisfying meal."
/user_details?userid=pV5yh55j12SWmipNv53qsQ,Thea M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I had heard so many rave reviews about Omnivore over the past few years and it certainly did not disappoint. I went two times in as many days because the food was just so tasty and affordable. The restaurant is tiny but with a lovely earthy ambiance, and again - the food!!!!! On my first visit, I split a 5x mezze with my friend. The falafel was a bit dry but the hummus made up for it. All the other salads and dips we chose came recommended by the server, and we didn't regret a single one. The second time, I ordered the Samac  sandwich + fattoush + lemonade combo. There was a bit too much dressing on the fattoush and I found it lacking in variety of vegetables but it was good nonetheless. The lemonade was freshly squeezed, herb-infused, and so so so refreshing. The Samac was to die for - piping hot and possibly one of the most delicious things I've had in my life.All in all, a great cheap place and the price doesn't compromise taste. I'm sad I didn't listen to my friends' recommendations earlier and missed out on two years of this amazing food."
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It's my first Yelp review in a while since I was super busy over the past one and a half months! So technically I should've written it at that time, but s--t happens sometimes haha. Omnivore has been on my list of must-try restaurants for a while, but it was definitely worth the trek in nearly -20 degree weather to get there.I ordered the omnivore plate while my friend got one of the pitas, and we both got their homemade lemonade. It was very refreshing and not too sweet, but it wasn't overly sour either, which is exactly how I like it. The omnivore plate was seriously foodgasm-worthy, and everything about it was perfect. The grilled chicken was juicy, the rice had just the right amount of bite to it, and the salad with toasted pita pieces in it were all exceptional. I tend to notice a pattern in which the restaurants I like best often make really tasty salads, and that's coming from someone who normally isn't a huge fan of them. My friend said that her pita was really good as well.I also decided to order some sort of coconut cake-esque dessert. Dense, moist, and definitely doused with some honey, it was the best way to cap off an already amazing meal. It's better and healthier than Boustan, and I will be sure to come back again in the near future!"

/user_details?userid=JrTsaMac8BnAkLuJ3MfGzA,Aileen L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"ATMOSPHERE: From the outside, Omnivore seemed a little bit dark but as soon as you walk in, you realize how homey it feels. It's a small restaurant but has a very nice aesthetic to it. And seeing how it is on the corner of St-Laurent, it offers a pretty nice view.FOOD: I got the Thai wrap and it was delicious. Although it is a bit small, the quality of the wrap was definitely on the higher end. It was a light meal. The meat was tender and very flavour-packed.PRICE: It was quite affordable, especially for the quality that you're getting. However, like I said, the plates are a bit small so don't expect to get a huge portion.SERVICE: Omnivore was more of a ""food court"" type restaurant where you order at the counter and they bring you your food once it's ready so there wasn't too much service to be offered. But the overall the workers seemed quite friendly."

Why? I don't even know. I thought it was some vegan restaurant. Well, today was the day I finally stepped in. The staff was wearing these dope boxed tee logos that screamed Supreme: love it.Food was so good and worth every dollar. I had the plate with both chicken and beef. I got to have some salad (in exchange of half of my lentil rice) for an extra dollar. The acidity of the salad is surprising at first but eaten with the hummus and everything else on this plate, balance is restored.You know me. I love food that is simple. This is simple.My new go to. Sorry Local Jerk I'll still go there on Saturdays."

/user_details?userid=v4zhnMe_T5gj5pYeh9k4VA,Daniel T.,"Sacramento, CA",4 star rating,"While walking around in Montreal on our anniversary my wife and I were looking for something new to us. When we came across Omnivore on Yelp we knew we had found the right spot.  A Mediterranean restaurant that offered a wide variety of food to offer we knew that we were in for a treat.When approaching the restaurant, you first notice the windows have planter boxes filled with different herbs.  This led me to believe that they focused on ensure that the food was fresh.  It turns out that is exactly what they do.  The several different types of salads and pastas they offer are all made fresh every day. In addition, they make all their ground meets for their different dishes in house as well.  My wife and I ordered and then sat down at a table.  When the food came out we were both extremely happy.  I got the carnivore plate because, well, I love meat.  It came with two beef and one chicken skewer.  Both of which were incredible. The fresh herbs mixed into the meat along with the seasoning used made them extremely flavorful. The rice and lentils it was served with were a perfect side to the meat.  The hummus was unlike any hummus I have ever had.  It was clearly house made, which is not a bad thing, and had a little bit a tang to it.  Taking a bit of one of the meats with a pita that had hummus on it perfect.  Clearly the cooks knew what they were doing when it came to making delicious Mediterranean food.  Overall Omnivore is a great restaurant.  Like many great restaurants in Montreal, you may walk by it without realizing it.  But trust me, if you stop in and grab a bite to eat you will be extremely happy you did so."
/user_details?userid=5pvqFOVS2wb_y81t7iE0Bw,Denise K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Omnivore has great quality to price ratio, but only one drawback and fantasitc food. It is a bustling good fast food place with lots of local trafic from fans far and wide.The drawback is the size of the place. It is so tiny that one feels obligated to eat and go, as you can see people waiting for tables or pushing around or eyeing your plate to see how long it may take to get your spot.That being the case, I suggest take-out for this eatery. Place your order and enjoy it at your leasure at home or another location like the park."

What I really wanted was the Ominvore platter, as I love to be able to try many different things with my meal. However, I had a late lunch and didn't think I would enjoy it as much as I would if more hungry.Instead, I went with the Djaj sandwich - a very traditional wrap with grilled chicken, garlic sauce, turnip, and pickles. It was fantastic! The portion size was perfect and all the flavours went really well together. As I waited for my sandwich for takeout (which did take a little while), I got to see all of the other wonderful things people were ordering! The various salads looked amazing, as did the Omnivore dish. I can't wait to come back! The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice and, given the wait time, I will probably plan to eat in next time."
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Location: On the Main. Street parking only.The place: It's tiny and for reasons unbeknownst to myself, it reminded me of a jungle shack. Have I ever been to the jungle, you ask? No I have not but I'm sure that's what a jungle shack would look like. Very cozy with lots of warm brown colors. Also, the smell. Nom nom nom. All I'm going to say about that. Oh, and great tunes in the background. Anyone who plays Dylan is all right by me. The food: Their specialty is Middle Eastern cuisine that they prepare fresh on a daily basis. Their selling feature is that maple charcoal grill - it makes everything good and tasty! I ordered the fresh beet/apple/carrot juice and the Bombay wrap. The juice was a great little energy boost, and I could really taste the beets and carrots. The Bombay was to die for. It consisted of grilled chicken with pineapple chutney, sumac onions and red cabbage cozily tucked into Pita bread. AND it was so damn spicy I could feel my sinuses expanding as I ate. LOVE it. Flavor-wise, I would define this as an explosion of deliciousness. Need I say more? Service: Great - the guy behind the counter is a little serious but he knows how to make a mean sandwich so I'll let that go. The clerk who brought us water and rang us up at the cash was super friendly.Price point: Pretty good - for $10 I had the wrap and the juice."

Each one was seasoned very differently and I didn't feel bad eating these because they felt very light and healthy, almost cleansing. Loved it. One mistake we made was that we forgot to get our food warmed up so we ate cold food on a cold night. Oops. Still no regrets!Great healthy food for great prices."

/user_details?userid=8jz1UQxlEI8Ezx-ZjL43mQ,L P.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"I was very excited to eat Lebanese food when we found this place on Yelp. We ditched going to Schwartz's and headed up the street.  The girl behind the counter couldn't have  been nicer and the Beirut roll with salad and lemonade was very tasty. I'd have eaten two.  So why the two stars? After we ordered and took a few bites of our food, I started looking around on the walls. There are about 5 very anti-American pictures on the wall. We are American.  We are from NY. I can't say that I don't support the right of free speech, bc I do.  And I can't even say I voted for any of the presidents depicted so poorly bc I didn't. I won't try to put myself in the shoes of people from the Middle East, I can't. But I can say that I believe the first job of a restauranteur is to make your guests feel welcomed and that is obviously not a goal here.I would not go back there and I would not give them my money any more than I'd give an American establishment my money if they dipicted Lebanese as terrorists. Hate is hate and there's enough hate in the world already. What  I love most about sharing food is it brings cultures together and makes differences disappear."

I'm so glad I went towards the end of my trip, otherwise I'd never have seen anywhere else. I had the fish wrap sandwich. It was amazing. I went back the next day and had a lamb one. Still good but the fish one was the bomb! My boyfriend lives in Montreal. I live in the Uk. I might be back to see him or might it be to have another fish wrap sandwich."

I ordered take out, and even having to wait minutes between picking it up and eating - the meat was still extremely juicy and flavourful. The sides were good but nothing too noteworthy. I'm only giving this 3 stars because they completely messed up my order, giving me chicken instead of beef and having to pay extra to have something replaced but having kept the old sides . Also I wish they had garlic potatoes! I'll possibly come back again to give this place a second chance."

/user_details?userid=QVNXQfVdNL6lWs75XHBo0Q,Shoshanah F.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"While the salads are tasty and fresh, my rating of this establishment (the one on St laurent) is based on portion size, cook of the meat and overpricing. I spent over 16$ for a plate which included one chicken stick (5 small pieces) and 2 salads. The salads were literally calculated at 1 spoon each (even though I was charged extra for one) and the chicken was previously cooked and reheated (it eas not busy and I didn't go at lunch time). I was charged extra for replacing one salad with another and for asking for more garlic sauce and less hummus!!??? I was never charged more elsewhere it was a substitution of equal value...I took the plate out only to discover a snack sized version of a lebanese plate. Extremely disappointed. If they need to increase their prices to accomodate what a normal portion size is I'd pay it no problem. But I feel duped compared to the other Omnivore on St- Denis which is excellent and very well portioned (they've never charged me extra for subscriptions or asking for a bit more sauce).Take a detour and go to the St Denis location you won't be dissapointed you skipped this place. And you'll actually get an adult sized meal when paying an adult sized price."

It's pretty spicy, and so fresh tasting. I ended up buying a jar to take home. If you're a vegetarian, you can go nuts here with their herbivore plate of mezes and salads. The food was so good that I ordered another set of the exact same thing to go for lunch the next day. The sandwiches (rolls) actually last pretty well, despite being in a hot car. Because the moisture comes from the pickled chutney (at least in the Bombay one), it doesn't sog up the pita wrapper and still tastes good 24 hours later (better than a burrito holds up). I can't wait for them to open up in the US. If this were in my neighborhood, I would be eating here every other day."

I search far and wide, and I usually end up disappointed, with only the bitter (ha) taste of defeat left in my mouth.Not so, Omnivore. I haven't been to Lebanon yet, but if the food is even half as good as it is here, I won't ever leave. The hummus is amazing (only thing, maybe homemade pita would be better) and very generously served for what is really a bargain price, and the kafta sandwiches were OMG THESE WERE THE BEST THINGS EVER. I'm seriously considering going back for lunch today and dinner, too.It helps that it is a comfortable environment and felt clean but also homey. Not sure how they pulled that one off but it's okay with me. I think I might kidnap the whole restaurant and take it with me everywhere."

Am I simply addicted to their delicious wraps? The answers: kind of - it's conveniently located and healthy - and yes, I have an addiction.Today I am dining in, which is unusual and spontaneous of me, and I also ordered a trio because I just got my butt kicked at Yoga Vieux Montreal (see my review there!). The good news is that 2/3 of my trio (a hot infusion and a fattouche) were served within minutes. The great news is: this salad is da bomb. Why have I wasted so many years getting my meals to go when dining in is such a delightful experience? Look, everyone will tell you the food is great here but it takes forever. Well, if you want your meat cooked that morning (or - gross - the day before) go to some cheap, greasy, late night diner. If you want yummy (and I think you do, because you came to Yelp for advice), come here. My sandwich arrived in the time it took me to write this review. See? Not that long. And mmmmmmm...

Each element on my dish was so fresh and vibrant. The tabbouleh was the best I've ever had. Parsley was freshly green, the onions were crunchy, and the right amount of acidity came from the tomatoes and the lemon juice so it makes you want to chew the salad and suck all those juices out. The service was also fast and friendly. After finishing my meal I felt like I ate a super healthy and delicious meal which also made me feel good about myself. I highly recommend this place."

/user_details?userid=5wVMvCjRp2lVHvAsi15hAQ,Christy V.,"Boulder, CO",4 star rating,"I was craving vegetables after too many days of bagels, croissants, and poutine. Omnivore was the perfect place to satiate that desire and I also had the chance to walk down memory lane (but it was even better than the original) with a fabulously garlicky, satisfyingly crunchy (thank you, turnips) shish taouk sandwich. As so many others have said, the menu is set up very well so that you can include some vegetable and some meat options, add in some fragrant, soothing mint tea and you will be very happy at the end of the meal. We were a group of five and so decided to to order the plate of 5 vegetarian mezza for $10. It was well worth it as we had a heaping platter of hummus, lentil-studded rice, moussaka, sweet potatoes, and orzo tossed with toasted pine nuts and dried cranberries. Supple triangles of pita were served alongside and I quickly stacked mine with all the veggies that I could cram inside. Bliss. On to the kafta sandwiches: the Djaj is a ""Classique"" version of Shish Taouk except that it's a longer, thinner presentation and the quality is much higher than at the storefronts I frequented on St. Laurent in the mid-1990s. Ouch. It hurt to so blatantly acknowledge the passing of time. But I'm eating better food now, right? That must count for something. I also tried the Inca, which again involves chicken but also some crunchy tahini-laced cabbage. Star of the sandwich right there. There were so many options that I wanted to try - I will return!"

Love the home made lemonade!On long afternoons (or mornings) after golf my friends and I always debate on where we should grab a bite. Normally we choose a place on St-Laurent as it is pretty central from where we are coming from. Today we went to Omnivore, a place that my friends have been raving about for quite sometime...but clearly I've never been to. I really enjoyed the food, we had lemonade(home made of course) to start while we waiting for our food to be ready. I really like it, I think there was a little bit of rose water in it...but I am not to sure! We both ate the Omnivore plate with a beef kafta. It came with a salad, rice & beans, pita chips, baba ganoush, and hummus. The baba ganoush was delicious, you really tasted the roasted eggplant.This will be a plate I will have to try again."

/user_details?userid=vD3l2PRoJ-zI3OlJo2c1KA,Lu H.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"I am seriously considering starting a petition to get these guys to open up in NYC.HOW does someone make food taste so good in a such a simple way that one actually smiles upon chewing?  Finding this place was a miracle in itself.   We were lost on Boulevard Saint Laurent, cell-service-less in a foreign country and thus without the guide of Yelp.   We just bixi-biked (their version of Citibikes) through nearly the entire city, and we were hungry.  We wandered into this cozy joint with bizarre (probably local) artwork, tired and just wanting to be fed.  I usually stick to vegetarian meals when I eat any kind of Turkish, Middle Eastern, Lebanese, or Persian food.  In general, unless its simmering in a sauce or stew, I find the kebabs and koftas to be too dry.  The meat here is perfectly seasoned, juicy, flavors retained and released upon first bite.  It was hard to say whether the beef or the chicken was better, both were so good but different.  But I must sing the praises of this ridiculously delicious quinoa dish they served.  I LOVE quinoa, and I've had it in many forms.  This was by far the tastiest.  The quinoa is cooked and mixed with roasted sunflower seeds, peas, sesame oil, and soy sauce.  The sunflower seeds and sesame oil really give it a nutty toasted flavor, and the texture of the quinoa is broken up by the peas throughout each bite.  I could have had a bowl of this for dinner and been happy.  The other side dishes were all wonderfully cooked too - a lot of rich flavors in the roasted vegetable side dish, and even the salad was great.  The guy who mans the grill is cool, he quietly appreciates it when people enjoy his food.  I did try to have a serious talk with him about opening in NY, as we are saturated with Middle Eastern places but lack consistent quality in a casual, almost fast food setting that is also creative.  He smiled but sadly remained unconvinced. So I had to have my fill.  On a 4 day trip we ate here twice.  The first by happenstance, the second out of sheer determination.  If you're a New Yorker visiting Montreal, please speak to him about coming to NY."

The first to the last bite of the beet/apple salad was purely wonderful. So light and refreshing with subtle flavours bursting in my mouth with every bite. I wished it was an endless plate of that salad. In contrast, I found the Samac sandwich fishy on first bite (and yes, I know this is a fish sandwich), but it was a distinctively really fishy taste... not in a good way.

Their platters are delectable, and as mentioned above, super filling. If you're looking for a nice balance, the Omnivore platter is right up your alley - lentil/rice, salad, pita, hummus, baba ganoush, and a meat skewer (or two?) is the perfect meal. Feeling meatier?

After a few days of heavy meals, I wanted to enjoy some fresh and satisfying fare, and Omnivore was perfect. Great area (if you're a tourist, it's a great street to check out--lots of designers and local spots), and the staff were so friendly and helpful. I got the herbivore x3 with chickpea salad, a tomato-based eggplant dish, and hummus (came with pita). The pita was a bit cool, thin and chewy, but it was a most excellent vehicle for all that deliciousness. My hubs got the hot chicken curry sandwich--he (an avid Indian food eater) said it was good. Definitely a Mediterranean fusion style of Indian food--very tangy, as in citrus-y. It's not a strong curry, and he ate it all. I loved my own so much that I marched right back up to the counter and ordered the Beirut hot sandwich to be my brunch on our train ride the next day. I've just finished it, and I give it a delightfully satisfied 2 thumbs up, and I don't care one bit what my train-mates think of the smell of beef and onions emanating from my onboard meal.

I would prefer paying more and having a bigger portion.Another downside... They don't offer garlic potatoes, which I really enjoy with my Lebanese food.Nevertheless, the ingredients are of excellent quality and everything is delicious.

From the outside, Omnivore's not much to look at... but this is a good thing. It means that rather than concentrating its efforts to look hip and cool, tptb behind Omnivore concentrate on good food, nice service and an authentic experience. This is not to say, however, that Omnivore looks shabby. It doesn't. It's comfy, welcoming and fits the neighborhood nicely. I was particularly enamored with the mosaic tables.In the proper frame of mind, I looked over the menu and made my selection. A chilly day in a chill restaurant demands tea. Fresh tea. Fresh mint tea... as in, mint leaves, simple syrup, water, and a cup. Boisson (much like poisson, one of my favorite French words) out of the way, I was ready to order the rest of my combo. Yes, combo. For $10, you get a kafta sandwich, soup and drink. For my soup, the green garlic-type soup was filling, deeply-flavored and wonderfully-made. Eating it was like eating warm joy. The garlic wasn't overpowering but it was, certainly, the star of the show. I decided on the Bombay kafta: chicken, sumac onions, cabbage, and pineapple chutney. Tell me that doesn't sound incredible. You can't. You can't tell me that. Because it *was* incredible. The sandwich was generously-portioned, spicy and textured so that every bite had a nice crunch as well as plenty of meat & seasoning. Although I was tasked with working after lunch, I much rather have found a nice corner in which to curl up with a book and take a nap. Omnivore serves comfort food from a Mid-East perspective that's sure to delight. It made me fall even more in love with Montreal."

I go there when I want a fast, tasty, affordable, and healthy meal. On the Plateau, that's the best place I found so far to get that kind of meal. The food is really great; I enjoy middle eastern food for the subtle mix of flavors within simple dishes like a pita sandwich or a salad. I usually have the inca sandwich--I like it so much that it's hard to order something else. They also have salads; the quinoa/green peas and the rice salads are the ones I tried and they are delicious. They write that their meats are from animals raised locally and without antibiotics. I have not verified this information any further, but I am always in favor of sustainable foods. The place itself is very casual and cozy: wooden tables and middle-eastern decor. It's not very big, but we never had trouble finding a little spot to sit there.The one thing I like a bit less is that they don't take credit cards (only cash or debit).

Another note: we usually keep it low on the carbs (which is hard to do in this city), and there were a ton of options for making your meal starchy carb-free."

I tried several things from their menu (buying extra to have available in my room) and loved all of them.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  What a wonderful and yummy experience.  I am so happy I wandered into their restaurant."

Some of the dishes were a bit too oily for our taste and some vegetables looked dry as if they had stayed behind the counter for a while too long, though the taboule was quite good. The staff was very friendly even though they did not speak any french."

/user_details?userid=_h-QCZaWrjWS9ePWfBQuug,Rhiannon K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great food with really delicious and refreshing flavours - especially the salads (orzo!) and kafta sandwiches. This is one of my go-to takeout places - the only complaint that I have is that sometimes I find that the service can feel a bit unorganized (especially when getting items to go). I don't mind waiting ~15 minutes for fresh food - but if the process of ordering, paying, and waiting could go more smoothly, I would order here more often!"

/user_details?userid=LyFEeiIfsoevTYfum30-tQ,Katya R.,"Paris, France",5 star rating,"Great interior of pots with fresh herbs and wood paneling and delicious, fresh food that is reasonably priced.  We ordered two types of wraps - one with meat, cabbage and carrot and the other with grilled vegetables and pesto.  Both wraps were toasted to perfection and the food was very flavorful.  Whatever you get, I would recommend getting a side of 3 vegetables for $6 - we got the taboule (loaded with parsley), salad du jour and beet salad.  Highly recommended."

/user_details?userid=VOs1e3K5moj4lFeD7aJ7Qg,Albert G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A pleasant little tavern with pretty good wraps. ""Beirut"" is my favorite. Their meat is certified organic, which makes the whole concept even better. Too bad they don't serve beer. Anyways, I wish we had more places like Omnivore on the plateau."
/user_details?userid=Tbi5Tw94FRqgvK39WpksKw,Angela M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"When you walk into Omnivore the atmosphere is without a doubt warm and inviting.  I've always been partial to restaurants on corners because of the abundance of natural light and for this Omnivore does not disappoint.  As far as Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food goes this place is one of the best I've tried in Montreal.  I had the Herbivore Platter which involves selecting any 5 vegetarian items.  I had the hummus (creamy and flavourful with a drizzle of olive oil, just as I like it), stuffed vine leaves, a quinoa and pea salad, a very fresh tabbouleh salad and a wonderfully creamy eggplant and chick pea dish.  I even got some extra caramelized onions because the staff are just that sweet!  They also have amazing smelling grilled meats like kefta which are maple wood charred. I'll be trying that next time.  And make sure you get a fresh juice while you're there.  I had a beet/apple/carrot/ginger concoction that was delicious, very reasonably priced and has probably saved me from a lurking cold virus.  Cozy, delectable, affordable!"
/user_details?userid=W7rNiyDjfTPL60vRTlA4nw,Californian I.,"San Francisco, CA",2 star rating,"First the pros: The servers were friendly and the food was prepared relatively quickly. The hummus and pickled vegetables were good.The rest: I ordered the Beirut, a beef grilled wrap that came with hummus, cabbage in tahini, and some pickled vegetables; I also ordered a side of tabouleh.  The side was generous portion-wise, but it was really sour and it's not possible to eat that much parsley (their tabouleh comes just as a ton of marinated parsley and some diced tomatoes and onions).  When my wrap came, the beef was neither hot nor cold, just luke warm.  I was a bit worried about this so didn't eat the beef. The whole wrap was not really enough for a meal, and when I mentioned to the server that it was good except for the fact that the beef wasn't hot, he didn't have any response.  Maybe he didn't understand me, could've been a language issue...I left hungry and wouldn't be inclined to go back, however my friends ordered a plate with a bunch of different sides and seemed happier with their dish so maybe if you stay away from the meat dishes you'd be better off!"
