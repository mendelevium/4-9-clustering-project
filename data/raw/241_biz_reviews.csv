/user_details?userid=Iu5mS8o02-RGpjJdxI0v7w,Harry K.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"This is one of the restaurants you want to go with your better half only, or with a small group of friends for a nice, homemade delicious dishes in a quaint, cozy with a bit of upscalish feel environment. 12-13 tables in total so make sure you call ahead to reserve. Better not bring kids here in order to not disturb the vibe for you and the guests. Hello McDonald's, Casa Grecque etc. Of course very important to mention that it's a BYOW. Accommodating, friendly and welcoming staff. The menu consists of Italian and Persian dishes. Not a wide selection but just enough not to make your head spin and then take half an hour to decide. Cool! We came here for the Persian dishes. Although the dishes are not exactly what I've become accustomed to in terms of portions and presentation, the quality was top notch. Order a an appetizer with an extra basket of their unique  delicious warm bread if you have a big appetite. They have only one Persian appetizer called Mirza Qasemi which is smashed smoked eggplants mixed with eggs. We tried it and.... Mmmm good! My take is that the Persian dishes here are influenced with some Italian accent or perhaps it's a fusion? Not sure but definitely worth asking the friendly staff on my next visit. We took the Bakhtiari Kebab (veal and chicken small cutlets) and Chelo Mahicheh (braised lamb shank). My advice? Although both were very good, I'd recommend you not to skip the Chelo. It was just Mmmmm mmmm mmmm in simple English. You have to get that amigo/amiga. I have nothing much to add besides the above and aware it's not a good practice to sprinkle 5 stars from just one visit but sometimes you go with your gut feeling and say, yeah they got it right baby. Just hand them the damn stars."

Wonderful homemade food we had the midday special which was a soup sandwich salad and coffee for $12.99 how can you beat that in an absolutely charming atmosphere. We had the vegetarian sandwiches and they were absolutely delicious. So impressed with this place I was writing the review during our coffee. We will definitely find our way back here.

I was amazed watching the chef sauteing every meal to perfection.  For those unfamiliar with this industry, dealing with a total of 42 covers and all of your meals are saute with one person running that station,  truly awe inspiring - and then to do it without a single refire?  Incredible. When it came time for dessert,  unfortunately,  the other table ordered the last of the chocolate cake which my nieces were eyeing up the whole night.  They literally made a fresh grenache and baked a cake for them.   I've been in the restaurant business for 25 years.   It does my heart good when I experience above the board service paired with exceptional food.   If you're deciding whether or not to give this place a try, don't think twice.  Just do it.   It's BYOB so don't forget the wine!!"

Stop looking for reviews and go eat there. You won't be disappointed. I ate there last night and it was hands-down the best meal I've had all year.The food is surpassed only by the service. The owner/manager/chef/sometimes waiter clearly puts a lot of love into every part of the experience, which ideally is something you haven't read because you stopped reading when I told you to and are already on your way there for dinner.Unless you're reading this at, like, 2:00am or something. In which case, they're closed. Don't go there now. Wait until they open, and then go - the service is much better when they're open."

/user_details?userid=E8N-hgXND7_wUGOA5u9jKA,Howard G.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a great little neighborhood restaurant. It's got a warm atmosphere and the impeccable service you'd expect from a small family run place. I was not sure what to expect but was very pleasantly surprised. It's a unique fusion of Italian and Iranian flavors which is definitely not something you see everyday. The food was great, big portions & lots of flavor. Be sure to make a reservation, especially on the weekend....it's a small place and attracts alot of the local population of Victoria Village since it's smack in the middle. It does have a bit of a limited menu so I typically end up ordering the same thing each time I go. It's a BYOW place, so be sure to bring something."

/user_details?userid=3LOQZOzmDTbJbcV9Ksg-mQ,Leyla L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Lovely little restaurant with Iranian menu for lunch and Italian for dinner. Meals come with fresh hot bread, soup, salad, tea/coffee and Iranian biscuit. Flavorful dishes plated in fusion style. Portions are plentiful. The mahi (salmon) dish came with an exquisite sauce with red wine twist and the fish was cooked to perfection. Service was good and attentive. Personnel were very accommodating to my two young children and pre-split the kid's shared meal into individually played dishes. Highly recommend to try out if you are looking for Iranian food in a contemporary setting."
