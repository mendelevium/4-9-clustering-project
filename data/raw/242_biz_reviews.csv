/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Montreal has a surprisingly high amount of great Korean restaurants and Sam Cha is definitely one of them! Located at the edge of downtown Montreal, it is rather conveniently placed near Atwater metro station. One of the downside of this place is that there is often a line-up at peak hours (eg. on weekends at dinner time). But don't worry, the wait is worth it for the quality of the food.Their menu is standard for a Korean restaurant, which includes their various stews and also a selection for Korean BBQ. However, one of my favorite dishes there is something that is not found on the menu: KIMCHI FRIES. Oh man, that thing is straight FIRE. Makes poutine look like a sloppy cousin. I won't go on too much about it; you have to taste it yourself."
/user_details?userid=k0ZM8d7pRCEqbkRLWJ0-aw,Rita Z.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",5 star rating,You might wait a little bit before you sit on a table but it is worth it! We did not order a lot because we were invited somewhere else. But i saw the food on every table and they were delicious! I will come back this is for sure !The staff were friendly and respectful !
/user_details?userid=WXOPvu53iSgej-w_0tnbSg,Grace Y.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"I was a little annoyed at the beginning because they were making us all wait in a physical line instead of taking names or giving out numbers, and it was 90 degrees and there was zero ventilation in the doorway. Also they told us the wait would be 5-10 minutes, and then after a while they told the people ahead of us that it was going to be 5-10 minutes for them, so we waited a lot longer. When we were seated we realized that they actually had a lot of empty tables in the back, but they just didn't have enough manpower in the waitstaff and/or kitchen to keep up with a full house, hence making us wait to be seated.We ordered takoyaki ($4), two cold noodles ($13 each), and a kimchi pancake ($13). The kitchen was super considerate and mindful about my garlic/onion intolerance, and the chef came to our table twice to double check with us and make adjustments. Everything was amazing. The prices were really reasonable and the portions were on the larger side. The takoyaki was hot, chewy, and tasty. The noodles had great chew and the beef was tasty too. The kimchi pancake was topped with slices of pork belly and was overall such a good combination of tastes and textures. We spent about $50 for two people. Highly recommend!"

There was one table before us. After we finish our dinner there was already a long line. We had a beef tatare, a kimchi pancake , a spicy soup with tofu, pork and kimchi. The portion was huge, I thought the pancake was an appetizer, but it was a main dish size. I shared the stone bowl rice with my husband. The soup was tasty too. Only one draw point my husband complained about was too much oil in the pancake and too much fatty meat in the soup. They put generous amount of pork in pancake and the soup, but I think it's too much."

Highly recommend if you're feeling like AYCE KBBQ!"

/user_details?userid=IoW5mayfZWleMWKRjF1l3A,Jasmine And Meko S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This was our second time at Sam Cha and the experience at this restaurant just gets better and better. Nothing hits the spot better than a hot bowl of soup on a cold, rainy day in Montreal to warm the soul - that and immersing yourself in soft, Korean Pop/R&B vibe.The servers were friendly and casual - the whole atmosphere gave off a homey feeling.We ordered the usual seafood sundubu - a  seafood soup (definitely one of the best in town!) and the Vegetable Okonomiyaki as an appetizer - a sort of pancake - which I definitely, definitely recommend to try (absolutely delicious). The portions were extremely generous, hearty and quite reasonably priced!The place usually gets busy towards 6-7pm and there's usually a line up, but DEFINITELY worth the wait!We would recommend this place for eating with a couple of friends (as they are usually very busy, I feel like they would have a hard time accommodating a large group) and for a fun date night!"
/user_details?userid=Mt-_SvJyDirR9fpZx9dbEw,Tommy S.,"Bellevue, WA",3 star rating,"This Korean restaurant has been a hit or miss experience personally. At times, I received excellent service with succulent food. At others, service was practically inexistant with stale dishes. Strangely enough, this stark inconsistency manifested itself during a single visit last time I had dinner there.We were greeted by a young woman with a sunny disposition and were seated in the solarium. I ordered some tea and two dishes of Yukhoe (Korean beef tartare). Up to this point, the service was courteous, attentive, and brisk. My first dish of Yukhoe came and was absolutely delicious. The meat was tender and just melted in my mouth. Unfortunately, my second dish of Yukhoe came and bore no resemblance to my first dish. (See photo attached). The meat was darker and the sesame seeds were missing. As soon as I took the first bite, I realized that the taste was different too: acrid and pungent. To make matters worse, our waitress disappeared and no one was available to refill our water for the remainder of our meal.This visit just epitomizes how service and food can be inconsistent within the same establishment. Although the prices are very reasonable, your experience here might very well be the luck of the draw, in the lap of the Gods..."

It is a tiny store but super cozy, it smells like BBQ in the air because they also do AYCE bbq there. We got a good seat and we decided to get chicken Katsu dolsot bimbibap which is fried chicken cutlet in stone pot stir rice! We also got takoyaki which is Japanese octopus flour ball and I got yuju tea which is a sweet citrus tea. The portion of the bimbibap is amazin! It is giant and I could not finish half of it! One sad thing about it is that the stone pot wasn't boiling hot, and the sauce they gave us was ice cold so the rice is just cold.... it is not that authentic tbh. But everything else is great! Definitely will come back !"
/user_details?userid=tCM0MJ5yV6CWciWIdGaj8w,Ivan K.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I think this is one of my favorite Korean/Japanese restaurants in Montreal. I've been here many times and have never been disappointed. The okonomiyaki and the takoyaki are absolutely delicious and you can't go wrong with the all you can eat BBQ. However, I wasn't a big fan of the bulgogi and beef tartare appetizers here. This is still one of my favorite places to eat and the prices here are very reasonable. If you're coming here, be sure to make a reservation first. This place is always packed and often has a lineup out the door. Also, be prepared to smell like Korean food for a few days. The ventilation here isn't the best and my clothes have smelled everytime I've come here."
/user_details?userid=xjZOqBiFoIk4YLNv7QTgVA,Bader H.,"Pierrefonds, Canada",4 star rating,"Walking past this neighbourhood, I was always curious about this restaurant as the interior seemed welcoming. I decided to come here with my friend, since we both like Korean food.We ordered the Ramyun and Okonomiyaki dishes, which were really good and delicious. The okonomiyaki had bulgogi on top which was to die for. The ramyun was well  seasoned and had a kick to it.My only negative feedback was that the food took a while to get to us. Make sure to come early as this place fills up really quickly."
/user_details?userid=mt_xNXIW8XBJan5DQ6QWUQ,Ms P.,"Cliffside Park, NJ",4 star rating,"My sister and I were looking for a good Korean restaurant in Canada. We ordered the Budaejjigae and it was okay. The flavor was a little bland for my taste but the there were abundant amount of ingredients so it made up for the taste. We just let it the soup boil more and it was better. The kimchi pancake was really good! I wished it was a little thinner but it was the right crisp and the thinly sliced samgyupsal was so good! Overall, I think if I visit Canada again I do want to try other things on their menu."

I've had their KBBQ and I must say that it's one of my favorite places for it. The meats are so flavorful and are quality cuts and paired with Soju, it's great! I have yet to try their other menu items but it's definitely on my to-do list. I definitely recommend going for their KBBQ though.If you like Korean food, this place is a must!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my fave korean places for their spicy tofu stew. The broth is amazing and thick and filled with ingredients inside. It also comes with a bibimbap so it's definitely worth the money. The place is quite cute and cozy with some nice korean music and the staff is friendly. However, if you do go there, i hope you dont have an important meeting afterwards because your clothes, your hair and everything will smell like the restaurant during the whole day."

/user_details?userid=BeF02riVZVjF3OGSyVP1Iw,Miles Z.,"Piscataway Township, NJ",5 star rating,"I was in Montreal for vacation and I was looking for a Korean spot to eat in the area. Everything was packed with lines going out the door at some nearby establishments. It wasn't until I looked on Yelp and found this establishment. Sam Cha was packed inside but we were luckily immediately seated for a table of two. Now let me preface this with the fact that I've been to several Korean places in the states (NY & NJ) but this was probably the best I've been to.We ordered a original Budhi Jigae hotpot that came with a bowl of vegetarian Bibimbap. Typically, the places that I've been to the hotpot comes out cooked already. For this place, the ingredients are still uncooked and you let it cook in front of you which is always fun. They sell alcohol as well which compliments the warm & spicy dinner.Would definitely come back if I'm ever back in Montreal and would definitely recommend checking this place out if your there for the weekend!"

Must say that it wasnt the best idea, as the air conditioning was not strong enough!

Our menu selection was so much better this time around. Went with the beef tartare (our favourite from last time) and the entré-size bulgogi which was pretty good. I definitely recommend the tofu kimchi entrée (but actually what an enormous portion!) and the gamjatang, both tasted amaaazinnggg!!!! I honestly can't wait to taste the other soups here! Loving this place so far, I would rate it 4  1/2 stars if I could!"
/user_details?userid=Lu3bkxKrlaZnuOq6CZiQcQ,Tina K.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Sooo bomb. We've only gotten the pork bone soup for 2 ppl, so we definitely need to try everything else next time! The veggie bibimbap they provide is soooo worth. Just wish they had bancha! They don't do any free side dishes like most Korean restaurants do! The quality of the food makes up for that though It gets soo busy and loud, which is great if you like that kind of vibe. If you come at a busy time or the weekend. don't expect a seat within 10 mins. However, they do an amazing job trying to accommodate everyone by seating separate parties in one tableBest part is their music. One of the Korean boys plays amazing music from his sound cloud profile"
/user_details?userid=Fje3gO0B3izgiptEaG4yCg,Nomiko B.,"Burnaby, Canada",5 star rating,Last night my sister insisted that I give Sam Cha a try. We got there around 8pm and the restaurant was full with a line on the stairwell. The smell of BBQ and other delicious Korean food made it very hard to line up without drooling. My sister and I were 3rd in line so we were seated around 835pm. The interior of the restaurant is nothing special but clean. The food and the service is what earned the 5 stars. The staff members were all super friendly and worked as fast as they could. The food we ordered was superbly delicious and very affordable. I ordered Gamjatang which comes with a vegetarian Bibimbap.  My sister ordered her usual Bulgogi Sundubu which also came with a vegetarian Bibimbap. The portion of the food was very generous and presented beautifully. I would highly recommend this restaurant for those who likes Korean food!
/user_details?userid=D1_7CQpKK2SzK3Jduy8y8w,Anthony H.,"Irvine, CA",4 star rating,"Service 5/5Ambience 5/5 Food 3.5/5I'll let the service and aesthetic of the restaurant speak for itself. I personally enjoyed the decor a lot.For food, I had the kimchi chigae, vegetable bibimbap, seafood pancake, and bulgogi.I found the latter three delicious; the bibimbap had fresh ingredients and a well balanced gochujang, the seafood pancake was stuffed with shrimp and calamari, and the bulgogi's house-made marinade was a refreshing change from the typical, overbearing taste I find at most restaurants.Ultimately, I rate their food a 3.5 because of the kimchi chigae, which was the main entree ordered. I could tell instantly it was watered down heavily and can guess that they took some shortcuts (understandable because of how busy they are, but doesn't leave me satisfied with it). Not to say that it tasted bad, but it didn't taste like authentic chigae and tasted similar to instant ramen packets."
/user_details?userid=0Se8OFrPpi6wE2TY2IVTLA,Eric N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Went there with my mom and niece for my mom birthday dinner and the overall experience was great! We've ordered a seafood pancakes, spicy seafood tofu soup and BBQ beef ribs. The seafood pancake was a bit of a turn-off, doesn't taste as good as I expected, it wasn't crispy enough. The seafood tofu soup was amazing! Very spicy, I mean very very spicy but very tasty. The BBQ beef ribs was also good but I find it weird, they place the grill in your table but they cook it for you... I mean what's the point of having the grill on the table if we are not doing it ourself?? Both main dishes cones with a bimbimap (rice inside of a hot stone bowl) I'm usually not a fan of bimbimap but the ones they have are very good. The service was very nice, most korean restaurant are very polite and take good cares of you. Will go back for sure to try other stuff"

/user_details?userid=RIM6BfaP7ex_AYzd6UemqA,Khalil P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I would consider Sam Cha to be kind of a hidden gem. It is located on Ste Catherine right near Atwater metro but it's not all that visible. Once inside, you're greeted by a nice host and there's a decent amount of seats. I've been here a handful of times and my personal go to order is chicken ramen. It is served boiling hot in a pot. The flavour of the soup, mixed with the good noodles and chicken, brings it all together. The service here is excellent every time and the music with the lighting gives this place a chill vibe."
/user_details?userid=Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A really solid place when you get down to the nitty gritty. I had a taste of the rolled omelette, and tteokbokki with cheese, which were flavorful and a good foil for each other; the omelette had a slightly sweet sauce and the rice cakes had a great heat. My seafood soondoobu and bibimbap were delicious, even the leftovers were good the next day! A lot of various seafood were found in that delicious broth. I also had a peach Makgulli which reminded me of my first time trying to drink. Really sweet and not a lot of alcohol, which went well with the spicy food.A couple of downsides, a single bathroom for the whole restaurant, and a smokey and hot interior. Service was ok, it was like a rotating cast of waiters and waitresses after a certain point. They had a really sweet waiter whose name I never got, but braces guy - you did a great job with our demanding and bossy bunch.I'm sure I'll be back at some point to try the raw beef and their ramyun."

We have made a tradition out of going to Sam Cha everytime we watch a movie at AMC Atwater.I've had their Bibimbap which is the bets one I've had in Montreal so far. Packed with flavours and a suepr spicy sauce to compliment it.But the showstopper are their Ramyuns. All of their Ramyuns are great but my favourite is Chicken Katsyu Ramyun. The Chicken strips are deep fried so their are multiple levels of texture. The broth is spicy (and by spicy I mean PoC spicy because I am South Asian and my level of spicy is pretty high). That being said, they control their spice level according to customer's taste (which we took advantage of and requested extra spice and wow did they deliver!). Super authentic taste. Fresh!! Best part is that their prices are affordable and really worth the value. Staff is super friendly and accommodating and they make great recommendations. Go to this place for an amazing time!"

My ultimate favourite meal there is probably the seafood sondubu. It comes with a vege bibimbap and the portion is very generous and very affordable! (15$ for these two). You can always change the bibimbap for a bowl of rice, which is what I did last time. The food stays hot for a long time so you don't have to worry that it will cool down. Also, the staff are very nice and the decor is very cozy and the waiting period isn't really that long. (I went around 8pm each time)."

We were enticed in here one Saturday night by the big windows and delicious smells coming out of these windows (great marketing technique!) and were so happy to stumbled upon Sam Cha. Being avid Korean BBQ goers, we opted for the AYCE grill for two. This comes with the most delicious sesame salad, onions, mushrooms, pork, beef, short ribs, chicken and probably a couple other things I'm forgetting. Our favorites from the meat selection are the chicken and short ribs but all items are delicious. Service is good and they top up any or all dishes as much as you like. Only bad thing is that the table for 2 is definitely too small for the grill and everything else they bring to you which makes the experience a bit uncomfortable. Otherwise, yum and fun!

Love how simple the menu is lol. I was quite surprised that their stew costs 14$, which is really pricy for average korean stew, but thats because for every stew you order you get a free vege bibimbap. Now the price makes more sense. I had the beef soondubu jiggae, the seafood pancake, and the beef tartare.- soondubu jiggae: probably the best i had in a long time. Lots of onions and beef, the stew is not too spicy and really flavorful. Loved it.- seafood pancake: their pancake was really thin compared to those served in other places, so it has extra crunch at the bottom. Love the fact that they put green onions and zucchini in it.- beef tartare: Suuuper good! I'll probably order this every time I come. They topped it with a raw egg yolk and sesame seeds. The sauce is sweet and salty, they put thin apple sticks at the bottom. The texture of the beef itself is great, you don't have to chew a lot. And for only 9$ you get quite a lot.The only dowbside is that food comes relatively slowly, so if you have a 1 hour lunch break you might feel tight on time. Definitively gonna come back for sure!"

Their waitress was really friendly and accommodating, I could see her explaining the dishes to the people next to us, and she kindly assured me that they make their food when ordered so she can make anything vegetarian. Their portion for the rice and soup was great, especially for the price (I think it was about $15, but I'm not really sure). I initially thought it was going to be plain white rice with jjigae, but NOPE. I was super pleasantly surprised when it came with a bibimbap! My taste buds were raving. The only drawback was that the food took quite a while to arrive, about half an hour, hence the 4-star (the taste honestly deserved a 5). But it was understandable since they make it all from scratch. I would definitely go back again, you know it's good when you spend an hour enjoying every bite of your food"

Prices are good, I went with my friend and she got a bibimbap and jjigae for just $16 (both regular sized portions). Warning to my vegetarian friends: there aren't many options. But if you want a good cocktail, this could be an option for you. A downside though is the service is pretty slow - it took them almost an hour to get our food and we only ordered 3 things.

I always leave the place with a big smile and whomever I took here they became their regular customers also . You just have to not be lazy and cook the meat by urself . If you are super hungry it will be better to order a dish that comes ready ."

Price is reasonable. Warm friendly decor and they play some great tracks! (K hip hop and future R&B) Ideal for small parties, or dates I guess. Would definitely go again and try some other entrees. They need to give banchan though! Authentic Korean restaurants can't skimp out on that."
/user_details?userid=OtMW3wzS-akygZm7erZ3qA,Kevin N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Favorite korean restaurant in Montreal. Perfect for either a date or simply hanging out with a few friends. The place is quite small (sits around 30), and is often full, so I recommend that you make a reservation if you are more than 2. Beef tartare is amazing. I highly recommend the dishes for two people that are cooked at your table. Ask for the fried rice instead of the bibimbap, you won't regret it. I came often, and never said that a dish did not taste good."

For 15$ i was surprised it came with a full big bowl of rice mixed with kimchi and sides. It was delicious! You get to mix the rice with all the ingredients and paired with the soup, I was in heaven. The tofu was super soft and meat was very plenty and tasteful. Extremely comforting meal. We also ordered raw beef that we usually like. Its very good! Best korean restaurant so far. So happy they exist."

/user_details?userid=nalYzoVpwA-AB20K0ybMkg,Pechsiree P.,"Universal City, CA",1 star rating,"The food is extremely slooooooow. The bulgogi and kalbi taste mediocre (though better than other Korean places in Montreal).They also force you to pay 15% tip for their bad and slow service. The stove also takes so long to cook and burns pretty easily. When we said that we weren't happy with the service, they said that they changed the grill for us so multiple times so they had to charge us 15% (and they did not inform us this when we were dining). They also told us not to come back and they don't care if we write them a negative review on Yelp. Unbelievable."

I ordered the beef soondubu jiggae based on a few credible folks here and it really hit the jackpot! This spicy soft tofu soup comes with a broth that's so flavorful, rich, and well-balanced. The portion and solids in the soup are quite generous. On top of that, it comes with a free classic bibimbap :O I hereby proclaim this the most delicious and filling $15 meal in Shaughnessy Village!"

Definitely eat their bibimbap with the sauce cause it's so good! Their portions are big which is good for some or not so much for others. The service was pretty bad. They didn't pay attention to our table at all even though we were right in front of the register."

Although the menu variety and decor are not nearly as nice as Chako, I really enjoyed the meat itself. I thought the marinate was done much better than at Chako and the quality was a lot better for the limited menu items you did get!Its definitely worth a try, especially if you're not a fan of random menu items like tempuras/sushi etc. at other kbbqs and just want to go for strictly the kbbq!"

Everything was flavorful and delicious.  I had to wait a bit longer than I expected, but when I tucked in to that first bite, I said out loud, ""this was worth waiting for.""  If you get there when it opens you should be able to snag a seat pretty easily.  Go - you won't be disappointed!"

Go ahead and order the pitcher of Sapporo for $17! It's a great deal and you'll finish it guaranteed! We ordered the kimchi tofu and that was amazing!! We eat meat,  but wanted something vegetarian to go with our other meat dishes. Once you eat that, you won't miss the meat, bc of the pop of flavor! The tofu noodles and chicken bibimbap was phenomenal. Make sure you go there hungry and craving flavorful, zesty food! This place will not disappoint you.  Be sure to make reservations!!"

/user_details?userid=YKm-0aMn46Yi0Re2lN1XRQ,Ivy L.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"I've been here many times previously for the group all-you-can-eat BBQ in the back of the restaurant for a celebration. The party space is very cozy, with picnic style tables, dim lighting, and a 1 mic old-fashioned karaoke. Only recently have I tried the front area of the restaurant where I actually order dishes. I regret not having discovered it earlier. This restaurant has hands down the best soups (kimchi and soondubu jiggae) in town, and I've tried a lot of them. So flavourful, a lot of ingredients, a good portion, and just spicy enough. The only downside is that it comes with a dolsot bibimbap, which jacks up the price to 14$. You can however change the bibimbap for plain white rice for 2$ less. It is still more expensive than other places' soups, but it is worth it. I also love their spicy soup for 2 option, which comes on a stove that cooks its content right in front of you. There's ramen, kimchi, pork belly, sausage, mushrooms, bean sprouts and more. It also comes with a dolsot bibimbap. There is plenty enough food for 2 hungry people and it's only 30$. Strongly recommend (at least for the soups)!"

One of us ordered a kind of appetizer and I ordered shots of a certain liquor but they ran out of both. They only told us (and I guess, they only realized), when they were working our orders so there may be lack of planning with their supplies."

/user_details?userid=MieuIn24iFp_fD3E5biDxg,I L.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"PROS:1. The food is delicious, authentic Korean. All the stews come with a bibimbap. So you will not leave hungry!2. It's a small place which looks family owned. Staff are friendly and quick.CONS:1. The decor is pretty confusing. It looks like you're inside an Irish pub hosting a birthday party.  2. Ban-chan (small side dishes) are NOT provided as they customarily are with Korean food. Which I found surprising and disappointing since that never happens in Korea.OVERALL:-I'd say Chez Bong and 5000 ans are tied as my best Korean places downtown. If you don't care for little side dishes, go to 5000 ans. But if you want a true Korean dining experience go to Chez Bong. -I'd recommend the Pork Bone Soup (spicy!) miam!!"
