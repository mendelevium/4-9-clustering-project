/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I wish I had known about this place for empanadas and other Latin cuisine/Chilean specialties which they have up on a chalk board menu before.The rows of freshly baked empanadas are somewhat artistic and tasty looking. It is pretty clear they make them in-house on a regular basis.It was only for one beef empanada with their slightly spicy tomato based salsa, but I found the experience was quick and friendly; the taste fresh and not greasy; and the price was fair at $3.80 TI for a decent sized filled pastry.  They even had a soft-serve ice cream corner, which I assume is for the summertime, but you never know what goes with a warm empanada..."
/user_details?userid=rbbN4r05yZX7fcftyOUbJQ,Syam R.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"I am new to Montreal and have tried many renowned places. From the fancy le Serpent ( meh) to Bocadillo ( way overstuffed with little taste). Anyway, of all the places i have tried so far , i would say the best have been the least expected; Epicerie Pimpui in the Mile End, a dumplings place in China town and La Chilenita. The cubanita (  braised pork)  sandwich is honestly perfect.  Not too stuffed, perfect balance of flavors and still very filling. The pork was cooked perfect.  No weird pork aftertaste, tender, generous on the avocadoes ( not some dolluted avocado sauce). Totally perfect.  And although the word lentil is a turn off for many: the lentil soup is amazing!!"
/user_details?userid=F6MPrQ5oxQL2Wq1v5ENDzA,Robert S.,"Providence, RI",4 star rating,"A very good Chilean empanada.   The crust was light and flavorful.   The filling was tasty and full of veggies, olives, beef, etc..   The setting is cute with indoor and outdoor seating. When I ordered my empanada, the lady put it in the MW first to warm the inside, then in the toaster oven to crisp the outside.   Even though her steps were appreciated, my empanada was still cold inside and the outside was not flaky nor crisp....And I waited like 5 minutes....!!Still, the taste and the dough were very good.  I'd come back again, but ask for them to take their time with the reheating."

The dough is perfect, not tough or too thick. And the beef enchilada was amazing. A variety selection of fillings available for every liking."

I took 2 beef empanadas to go since u was in a hurry, looking around the small resto I noticed they had many variety of empanada from beef chicken and vegetarian options.Biting into the beauty delights I was surprised that there was not only beef but olives, egg, and other delicious veggies in he empanada, and it cane with a spicy sauce which I wish was a lot spicier. I will definitely come back and try more things here, they also have tacos, burritos. Looking forward to my next visit, I'll make sure to take more pictures also"

/user_details?userid=uMDPDpIjtH3agrdFvXFF9Q,Francisco S.,"Ajax, Canada",4 star rating,Nice little and clean place in Montreal. They have several items in the menu ( Chilean and Mexican food). We tried the empanadas. I've got the beef empanadas. The meat to onion ratio was good. The dough was ok but in overall basis very flavourful. One of the best I have tried in Canada
/user_details?userid=4EUPFzTM-V1P1IBF5bQ84g,Caroline T.,"Dorval, Canada",5 star rating,Loved this place! Really reminds me of the authentic thing. Felt like we went back to Chile. Their empanadas are awesome!!! Delightful place with really nice staff too!
/user_details?userid=aYL7qtwOMdzYayaddq_Hnw,CT M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Decent Food. Fair Prices.While their reputation for empanada isn't completely undeserved, I find their pastry dough on the heavy side. The fillings, however, are delectable.As for their other fare, everything from their sandwiches to burritos are well-worth the value, but I wouldn't consider this place for much more of a lunch spot if you happen to be in the neighbourhood AND happen to be craving empanadas or some other Latin flavour."
/user_details?userid=oP0wbnAOH4754U1SdGzHMg,Sarah R.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"There are not many places in Montreal for empanadas, so this place already gets credit for that. The empanadas there are awesome, I highly recommend. Haven't had anything else on their menu, but it looks good."
/user_details?userid=w8ppbCuER9XHcTAyxMO_fw,Stephane A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great place, the terrasse is really good in summer, up on Roy street, which is pretty calm too. Vegetarian options are really good, whether it's for a burrito, quesadillas or empañadas. I strongly recommend it."
/user_details?userid=nfb9ig6yyOrEU98JNqUYXA,Sabrina A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I live around the corner and really like this place. Lots of vegetarian options. Good, simple food, good prices. The empanadas are fantastic- I usually get half a dozen to take home in a box- and their burritos are tasty. The beef is always thinly sliced and nice and lean. Family-run, friendly staff. Little area with plastic chairs and tables outside, shady in the afternoon. Come here to satisfy your appetite!"
