We haven't had a single item from Icehouse that was not absolutely amazing. I cannot recommend it enough. We can't wait for summer and hope that the public health order will allow us to dine in and thank you guys in person for the incredible meals. If you are perusing Yelp deciding what to order in tonight, LOOK NO FURTHER, seriously."

/user_details?userid=7PTwhPEM7VWclYIS_1dSiw,Jéssica C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Super cute place, with a tiny cozy terrasse. We had their famous chicken on a bucket, it's delicious! Perfectly cooked, tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. Perfect for a casual date. The chicken that comes in a bucket is basically put over the table with a paper tower under it. It's a nice little authentic move :) It came with a side of potato salad and a cabbage salad. It was around 20$ and definitely shareable if you're not hungry."
/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Good try at Tex-Mex although I personally would call it Tex-Can. What Texan in his right mind would put french fries in a burritto? Having said that, the steak burritto WAS very good with plenty of steak, pablano chiles, onions and the previously mentioned fries. The bourbon lemonaide was also quite good but could use a touch more bourbon for my taste. I dropped $50 for a burritto and a couple of weak drinks which seems a bit high for what it was. Tasty though so worth checking out."
/user_details?userid=DlNz5SxdBYRaZ_pnyIxn6g,Rhonda B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Very chill unassuming little spot on Roy, just east of boul St. Laurent. Nice little terrasse in front for al fresco dining. Stopped in for brunch and were warmly welcomed, French press coffee followed. Brunch with southern emphasis. House made pork neck sausage patty on just made flaky biscuit with rich gravy and topped with perfectly cooked egg that sister said was best ever anywhere. My 2 breakfast tacos were generously filled with eggs, cheese, crema, pickled onions, green onions and cilantro. When I added a good dosing of the shisito sauce to the tacos, the flavours were outstanding. Accompanying was burnt ends with beans. Shredded brisket mixed with beans was sweet but balanced by some squirts of yellow mustard. Brunch for two (incl tax) $38. Can't wait to come back for their dinner offerings."
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"Finally tried this place last night. We managed to grab a table at around 7pm on a Wednesday night so I think that as long as it's not the weekend, you'll find a comfy table for small groups. Started off with a pitcher of the bourbon lemonade ($40), which is deliciously sweet and strong. Honestly, I would go back just for that. We weren't starving so we ordered the popcorn shrimp appetizer ($12) and 4 orders of tacos (8 total tacos). We got 4 mahi mahi tacos ($16), 2 portobello tacos ($8) and 2 pulled pork tacos ($8). I can't speak to the pork tacos but I really loved the mahi mahi tacos. The portobello tacos were good for vegetarians but lacked the punch I tasted in the fish tacos. My favourite thing was the popcorn shrimp appetizer. Sweet, tangy and spicy simultaneously! All in all, Icehouse has great food, drinks and ambiance. Love the terrace in the summer! Next time I go, I'll prob try the fried chicken and sides."
/user_details?userid=A5UmPoM48Y8NOzMg7gjPuw,Natacha G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I had heard a lot of good things about Icehouse and decided to check it out! Its a small restaurant but in the summer they have their outdoor terrasse which is almost as big as the indoor restaurant so they're able to welcome more people (Highly recommend going in the summer) We started off with oysters and then ordered the mains 2 crispy beef tacos , 2 pulled pork tacos and their famous fried chicken. Everything was absolutely delicious!! I was really surprised at how delicious their tacos were, I've been to mexican restaurants that don't have tacos as good as Icehouse. Their fried chicken batter was also amazing, it came with coleslaw and a potato salad. Everything was great really loved Icehouse, only thing is I found it a bit pricey for what it was; oysters, 4 tacos and half a bucket of fried chicken for almost 90$. But I would definitely go again!@natachaeats"

This was my first time and will definitely won't be the last! The staff and service is agreable. Once you get in, they seat you and there's the menu on a board. They have a good variety of tacos and burritos. They also have fried chicken! We had the Mahi Mahi taco (made with fish) and the fried chicken taco. Both delicious! They also have one of the best fried shrimp I ever had. Sweet and salty at the same time !!They have more stuff in the menu, so I definitely wanna go back! The bourbon limonade is the best! I hear their ice tea is amazing too."

We were greeted by the chef/owner who was truly so charming as well for his waiter who was truly helpful and mindful of details . We ordered the shrimp popcorn and the ribs . My boyfriend says it's the best shrimp popcorn he's had and I say it's the most tendered ribs I've had.We both wished it had came with more bbq sauce but we asked and they gave us more without charging for extra or anything.We also had a bourbon lemonade I believe.One word delicious !My boyfriend and I keep on wanting to go back
/user_details?userid=r6PbQjtij6gcalYWBBrILg,Maria B.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,If you know me you know I love tacos and this place is doing tacos right. The chicken tacos at ice house are out of this world. There's only a couple ingredients but they com together well. Fried chicken jalapeño lettuce and a delicious sauce make them killer. I'm not a big fish person but the fish tacos here are worth trying. And if for some reason tacos aren't your thing they have buckets of friend chicken fried oyster po boys and just so much more to try it definitely come check out ice house
/user_details?userid=theKAKaqiAGsLhpSyXBtSQ,Triston J.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Im American. Generally speaking, it's good to be American. It's behind basically all other western developed nations in terms of disposable income at the bottom of the economic distribution but that doesn't stop it from being one of the wealthiest, and safest places in the world. However, when you move to Canada there are a few things which make you feel a bit like a fish out of water. First of all, there is some strange culture of consensus here... it's weird! It seems like a lot of people feel like they have agree on everything. A lot of social situations take on this toned down NPR vibe and everyone seems to be glancing at each other all the time trying to infer social expectation.Also, there is no Trader Joe's here! I miss dear Joe! I hope in my next review there is some great opportunities for me to talk about the things I love about Canada, of which there are many! Icehouse is Texas themed. Love it. Think the main server guy is a genuine Texan.Delicious nachos. Good joking around with the staff. Great vibes.Price to portion ratio on some of the smaller items seems pretty off to me. I think there should be some cole slaw or something that is served with the burritos and sandwiches. Nothing big, just a lil bit of something else to give the ol' pallet a rest."

I highly recommend the bourbon ice tea I hate sweet cocktails but this one has it down perfectly! For food go all out definitely have the crab stuffed jalapeños to die for, hands down one of the best things on the menu. The bucket of battered chicken with a biscuit a real biscuit is sooo goooood!Alert: they have $3 burritos $2 drinks on Saturdays - if your on a budget go for it!The only reason why I cannot give it the full 5 stars is the price ... it's definitely over priced for a Texan girl. 1/2 a bucket of chicken with two apps and one drink each for two will rack you around $80 which is a bit steep for Texan comfort food ;)"

We got a nice table  on the terrasse and had some great bourbon lemonades. The popcorn shrimp was incredible and the lobster roll was good but NOT WORTH 25$! Omg!

The host said the could not serve me just fried chicken and I would have to order the sides as well. 4 pieces of chicken for 20$ plus tax. The host offered me tacos, which I found very offensive seeing as I am a visible minority and my request was for fried chicken, not tacos. Most of the staff was outside smoking and seemed annoyed when I showed up to order food. Avoid this restaurant"
/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I recently tried out this cozy resto located on rue Roy and totally loved it!  The resto itself is quite small so not good fot groups of more than 4. They don't take reservations but not worry as the wait-time is max 10 min during peak times. It is a texas style BBQ cuisine and their bbq chicken is delicious! Now what is unique about this resto is that the food is not served in plates! Yes that's right!  They basically come to your table and pour the bucket of chicken or ribs on the paper table cloth...it's actually kind of cool. We also tried their pulled pork tacos which were absolutely delicious!!  So tasty ! Must not forget to mention their delicious thirst quenching bourbon lemonade!! Amazing!  Not sweet just perfectly made! The service is so super-friendly and welcoming! Shout out to our waiter Francois who was super friendly and gave us great service!  I would strongly recommend trying this resto at least once!  So worth it! I will definately go back!!!  This testo is a perfect place for a date or night out with  close friends. Bonus..in the summertime, they have a small outdoor terrasse which is perfect for a summer evening!"
/user_details?userid=_QcAZTM110FOEMMFpKO-3Q,Aidan R.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"To be frank, I hesitated to write this review. My fondness of this restaurant makes me not want to blow up the spot, as I value the low-key deliciousness that Icehouse possesses. As a city dweller I'd like to have somewhat exclusive knowledge of this hole in the wall gem. Fortunately for y'all, my integrity as a yelp reviewer won this battle, as here we are. I'll start with the drinks. The margarita pitcher was more than adequate, but the real winner was the bourbon lemonade. I mean if you could liquify the entire texmex food genre and pour it into a pitcher, it would be this bourbon lemonade. Gr8 stuff boys.Icehouse fried chicken is likely the best I've ever had. In addition, the included sides of potato salad, coleslaw and biscuits are each incredible. Yelp I never thought I'd say coleslaw, the wackest part of any southern meal, can be incredible. How dare you do this to me Icehouse. The potato salad features smoked potatoes, and at this point I think smoking anything makes it better. Anything. Fuck I'd drink smoked water. I went with the vegetarian nachos, which were great on their own, only made better I'm sure by meat. In conclusion, last night I committed the sins of gluttony, and, let's be honest, lust for that goddam chicken. I ate until I was in pain, and probably gained several pounds. 5/5 no doubt. Fuck me up."
/user_details?userid=RZCMYtGPWZTgERAYiKQDUA,Anmyn G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Very nice and fun place. Staff was really pleasant. Good burritos and tacos. Loved the bourbon lemonade. The only thing I don't like there is the fact that they don't take reservation (long waiting time), they can't split a pitcher and they only have the menu on a blackboard (you stand in the way of people passing by when reading the menu). Still a good place to eat with friends."

The owner is great and super involved. The bourbon lemonade is absolutely delicious! Like sooooo amazing! The honey drizzle on the fried chicken was perfect. The potato salad  left me wanting more and more. It's a super chill atmosphere. I'm so glad I didn't let the 3.5 drive me away from coming here. It's so worth it!!! Go! Oh and the biscuit!! Yuuum yum yum.
/user_details?userid=JstDKWmAZsL026ADFxf7fw,Tony Kangrui L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Creative comfort food served on parchment paper in a hip little corner.From left to right on the picture are: popcorn shrimps, half-bucket of pork ribs, coleslaw side, and potato salad side. The popcorn shrimps had a very textured and sweet batter (coconut?) with green onions bringing out the flavour. I don't easily get impressed by fried food but this was very good. The ribs were covered by a very sweet un-tangy sauce that I liked a lot. The rib pieces themselves were not all equal: some fatty fall-off-the-bone pieces and others that were dry and invited a toothpick. The sides were adequate. The watermelon and lemon iced tea cocktails had a nice distinctive bourbon sweetness. The food was plenty to split in two, and we paid just under $30 + tip per person.It's pretty creative on every front, on the food, the drinks, and the setting. I don't find it cheap though, so a 3-star. But it's promising enough for a second visit, maybe a redemption for 4 stars."
/user_details?userid=hiEj-3X8gV4-kBNkySOSJw,Diana L.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"If you feel like eating fat and getting dirty, I highly recommend Icehouse. Fried chickens are on tables and it comes with coleslaw and potatoes salads. Chickens comes it realy big pieces and they are very crispy. It also comes with a piece of bread in the bucket and it is buttery and a bit sweet. We also ordered mahi mahi tacos and pulled pork tacos. If you are a sensitive to spicy food, beware of the mahi mahi tacos. One of the garnish is hot pepper and it can get pretty strong."

Tried the all dressed nachos which were amazing but have to be shared as it is a huge portion. Also had the portobello mushroom tacos which I highly recommend as they were filling but not too heavy. My friend ordered the lobster burrito which she loved as there were huge chunks of lobster in it. Have also tried the steak burrito on a previous visit which was good but huge and very filling, almost needed to be rolled to the car afterwards! Service was great as well, would definitely go back."

/user_details?userid=J4Rr11p5K9XbM-QdEUJIfw,Riya D.,"Washington, DC",3 star rating,"I'm a little conflicted about Icehouse. I want to love this place - it has all the things that I love: tacos, nachos, sunshine, a totally casual vibe and a patio. On the other hand, dinner for four of us was $200 and we ended up feeling a bit underwhelmed and hungry - we grabbed more snacks afterwards. The four of us had: a pitcher of a bourbon lemonade cocktail, 3 dozen oysters on the half shell, 6 tacos, an order of fried chicken, and an order of the crab nachos. The food was all good, but nothing really stood out as amazing. The nachos were a generous portion - but really expensive. I think they were close to $30. All in all, I would come back for cocktails and split the basic nachos with friends but that's it. For what we spent, I think we were expecting to be wowed."

Though, could have added a bit more guacamole.  The place is rusty and has a great vibe. It gets busy. Open long hours and patio is just right for a beer. They have beer from west cost micro breweries to local MTL beer. Close to Saint Laurent busy area and also a bit quiet just cause it's a block off the main street."

I'd eat here every night if my waist band and wallet allowed me. I love their popcorn shrimp, portobello tacos, their veggie burrito (guac for miles) and their crab nachos. This place has something for everyone. Also, their bourbon lemonade is the perfect libation / thirst quencher. They also sell pitchers of beer.Don't be surprised if you bump into Win Butler."

/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,We wandered in here on a Thursday night because we were nearby and my friend had raved about Icehouse.  It's a small restaurant and they don't take reservations. On a Thursday it wasn't a problem but I could see where on weekends you might have a wait.  They also have a great looking terrasse which I can imagine would be fun in summer.  Sadly it was the end of November so we couldn't get to try it.This is a very casual restaurant.  You don't even eat off plates here.  Prior to serving the waiter places a piece of brown parchment on the table and that is what you eat off of.  Also there are no menus.  The waiter comes and tells you what they are serving that night and what the prices are.Icehouse specializes in Tex-Mex.  None of us were particularly hungry so we split a serving of fried chicken (5 pieces) with potato salad and coleslaw threeways.  It was fine for us because no one had an appetite but normally I would say split this among two people max.  The chicken was very crispy and sweet too.  It was also fairly moist and juicy.  The potato salad was smoky and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The coleslaw was as good as any.  We had some bourbon lemonade with this and it was pretty strong.Our meal came out to about $18 before tip which wasn't so bad but as you can see none of us ate very much.  That being said the rest of the prices seemed reasonable for the part of town that we were in.

I didn't like that menu was written up on a chalk board wall . I couldn't read half of the items ( not many ) and had to basically go near and around other patrons to read the menu. They should provide a paper menu at least. The service was fast and efficient no fuss. What we ordered :fried chicken taco,old school beef tacopopcorn shrimpsbbq chicken burritoWe also ordered a big jug of bourbon lemonade The tacos were yummy , the right balance of ingredients and spices. The only thing i would change would be the soft taco shell on the fried chicken taco.I wasn't a fan of the popcorn shrimps WAY too sweet and they were tine shrimps. As for the BBQ chicken burrito whoever came up should *^*&%$%^#$#! Im sure there somebody out there who loves it, but as for me NOPE! I dont know if it was the bbq sauce who messed up the whole burrito. I believe our total was about 70$ or maybe more. Icehouse is worth the try.  But don't expect too much!"

Service was great and the food was delicious and reasonably priced. The server suggested that we grab a range of dishes and then share between us which was a good idea. We had the fried chicken, the ribs, coleslaw, potato salad and fries and it was more then enough! Didn't get chance to try the tacos but they looked good from what I saw others eating.The only strange thing I found was that they don't have a handout menu that you can have a read of at the table. The whole menu is on a giant board at the front of the restaurant which is no big deal but a strange decision.Shout out to the friendly, bubbly girl that kept coming around with water and took our payment."

The highlight of our dinner was definitely having the bucket of BBQ ribs or the fried chicken poured over the parchment paper on the table. It was just so much fun to grab the food and eat it with your hands. Every ""bucket"" of food was accompanied by coleslaw and potato salad (there was in my opinion nothing special about the sides).My favourites were by far the fried chicken (extra crispy and very filling), the beef ribs (large, very saucy) and the fish tacos (so crispy and fresh). Make sure to come early or during a nice and sunny day because there aren't many tables indoors."

Pretentious Service.I only eat here because I live around the corner.None of the items on the menu are particularly memorable or remarkable. In fact, just about everything tastes like what you'd expect from a hipster who developed an interest in Americana cuisine and has watched too many YouTube cooking videos.The drinks, however, redeem a visit. They have a solid selection of local beer, and their bourbon lemonade and ice tea are better enjoyed by the pitcher than by the glass.When it comes to the service, though, it ranges from rude to condescending, and is always slow (which is odd given how small the place is). The staff just generally tends to treat you as though they're doing you a favor for letting you eat there.If you're in the neighborhood and you're looking for a quick drink and snack before you move on to something better, it might be worth visit. If you're looking to enjoy an actual meal, though, I'd urge you to look elsewhere."

The chicken batter was tasteless. The batter is so important to any fried food and if the batter is lacking seasoning you failed the entire dish. The ribs were basic bbq ribs that you can get anywhere. the vegetarian burrito was lacking flavour. Overall it is alright but not worth the price and there are better places out there. The bourbon Lemonade was good.I do enjoy the outdoor patio and atmosphere is good for a friends night out but could use a lot of salt, pepper and cayanne. The place is also very small is not good for large groups."
/user_details?userid=kneX5ZeKlEVJ7qvg_EXBeg,Lizzy A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I mostly enjoy this place because it's a fun spot to go with friends. One of my favorite things to do for an early dinner with a few pals (early because Icehouse fills up so quickly), is to order a pitcher of bourbon lemonade, a bucket of chicken, and a bucket of ribs. It's a pretty amazing feeling when you're super hungry and someone comes over and just dumps a mountain of fried chicken and biscuits on the table right in front of you. It's a super-casual good time and feels just like you're at a backyard BBQ that you never ever have to clean up. Honestly, though, I go to Icehouse more for the feast-fest than because I love their fried chicken and/or ribs. I think they add honey to their fry batter or something -- not sure. Normally, I can really get behind a killer savory-sweetish combo, but when it comes to fried chicken, I'm a traditionalist. Don't get me wrong, though -- it's still good (maybe even great). But just not my fav. The ribs are fall-off-the-bone, which is exactly how I think a rib should be, and they sure are tasty. But again, just not my fav."

The only menu is on a chalkboard at the front of the restaurant but the menu options are mouth watering. We had the fish tacos and popcorn shrimp.

Unfortunately it was not. The chicken was kind of dry, the batter was interesting but was missing something. A bit over sweet; not enough pepper or other spice. Maybe their ribs are better, but based on the chicken we will not bother going back."

Felt bad for the people after us because they had to wait outside (it is -10 tonight).The handwritten menu on a board it was hard to see - the writing is small (I wear glasses) and some parts have no light at all. Ordered the shrimp ceviche (on special) and popcorn shrimp and a bourbon lemonade. Bourbon lemonade was way sweet, had very little lemon, and maybe had a shot. For $10. Waited at least 30 minutes for our food. This I didn't mind so much. Shrimp ceviche: the portion was palm-sized. Tasted good. They brought us a shrimp po boy - not popcorn shrimp - but my companion was too hangry to complain. I didn't complain because it was loud, so maybe it was an honest mistake. Anyway... The remoulade on top was very, very sweet, it was too much. The shrimp themselves were good but they got so soggy in that sauce. (I'm from the South, no sauce is that sweet.) For the portion sizes and taste, it wasn't a good value. We paid $40 including tip and came away hungry. We could've ordered a bucket of chicken for almost the same price. The service was friendly and they were enthusiastic about the menu. They were really nice. It gets loud. Just depends on if you're in the mood for a rowdier setting.It's really unfortunate that we weren't pleased with our meal. I've read reviews where when it's not packed its good, and just forget it if it is crowded. I have to agree. But I was so disappointed, I won't be back."

The 5 of us arrived at about 10pm on a warm Saturday night (kitchen is open till 2:30am) and found the place relatively empty so we were able to snag a table on the wooden terrace. The tables are basically pic nic tables, there are no menus (there's a very visible blackboard), very little in the way of plates or cutlery (bring baby wipes!)....and lots and lots of fried food perfect for sharing!We shared the bucket of fried chicken with biscuits, cole slaw and potato salad - which was literally served on parchment paper directly on the table. The chicken was crispy and delicious. We also shared the jerk shrimp tacos, crispy beef tacos and the lobster burrito (tacos come in 2s and burrito is cut in half). The shrimp tacos were very good, the beef were good but not particularly exceptional and the lobster burrito was pretty good."

Everything was great.  Sure, almost everything was fried, but I would argue that's WHY it was GREAT. Apparently they use a method of frying called ""chicken frying"", which (strangely enough) doesn't always involve chickens... Whatever. It tastes great. Especially the fried chicken taco, which basically re-defined the dish for me - I now know why I had to fight Matthew for one of them, and why he fought like a wild dog over a bone for it.Same thing for the fried chicken - absolutely fantastic. If you can handle your friend food, then you need to try it. It's not even that fried, so don't worry about taking out extra life insurance.The atmosphere and decore is spot on too; nothing too fancy, but keeps with the theme of the food, and is cool.

/user_details?userid=cqgjW23FJyu5kFlRDN1CpQ,Rawan K.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"In the mood for some Tex-Mex? Then make your way to Icehouse for some deep-fried southern comfort! They do not take reservations and there will most likely be a long line up that takes around 30-45 minutes to get through, so mentally prepare yourself and keep your group limited to 2-3 people since it is a small, but cozy place. A great restaurant to enjoy some bourbon lemonade over their hot and spicy comfort food, their menu is written up on the wall by the open-kitchen and ranges from fried chicken to tacos, to burritos and spicy popcorn shrimp, among many others. They have an interesting variety to choose from, which I have never seen elsewhere in Montreal.Their tacos are soft, loaded, and come in two's. You probably could not tell with all the filling that takes up most of the space on the plate, but the meat is definitely under it all and comes packed with flavour too. The pulled pork and shrimp were great picks. Next on my 'to try' list? Fried Chicken Tacos. They also have an array of hot sauces to choose from, some of which may definitely clean your colon dry.Ever heard of a lobster burrito? I definitely have not, not until I came to Icehouse anyway. Apparently it is one of their best menu items, and it better be for $20. Mind you, the burrito is huge; if you split it with someone, paying $10 for it will seem much more appropriate. Loaded with corn, beans, and other typical burrito stuffing, the one thing this mouth-watering wrap was missing was a kick of spicy heat (which I could have added on my own if I was not too busy stuffing my face). The lobster tasted great, soft, and fresh - not in the slightest bit rubber-like or chewy. Definitely a must have! Next on my 'to try' list is their Oyster Po'boy, which looked phenomenal and their Catfish BLT that just sounds fantastical.The popcorn shrimp was pretty good, I was not expecting it to be spicy but that did not bother me. They are the perfect snack if you are in the mood for something on the smaller, lighter-fried-side and not looking for a heavy meal. Alternatively, the lobster roll can also be considered a lighter option depending on one's appetite. ""Delicious, savoury, an explosion of flavours in your mouth, and totally satisfying,"" are just a few ways my friend described it and she would eat it again in a heartbeat. Next appy-must have? Crab-stuffed Jalapenos, yes you read right.Icehouse has so much to offer, it blows my mind. It is on the higher end of the price range, and most likely in large part due to the ambiance and popularity, but definitely worth it once in a while."

The only plus side was the barman who didn't ignore me and my friend and made us an awesome bourbon lemonade. So we arrived to a waiting line and we got to sit outside to wait before getting in. Ppl kept coming in and the terrace got full pretty fast. The ppl already sitting when we arrived had drinks so I expected the waitress to come over to us and ask our drink order but no, in fact the ppl who kept coming in after us got that privilege. So we just sat there wondering if it was our faces she didn't like or our choice of clothing, anyway she completely ignored us until we got called in to sit inside 40 mins after we arrived. Luckily the barman noticed us and offered us drinks. So we sat there and drank for about I would say 30 mins looking at the ppl who just sat down getting their orders taken. At that point I was ready to leave but I was starving the car was far and it was cold out so we just waited. Ppl who came in after us were already eating. I had dragged my friend there so she was giving me this look of like girl why you hate me so much lol.  Finally this other waitress came to us and was like have you been served and my friend said ""ummm no"" so we asked what was good and she suggested the mahi mahi taco. We also split a steak burrito and fries. So food arrives. First the burrito,  the menu said it would come with cheese sauce but I guess they replaced that with soggy fries and jalapeño. I was confused because the menu ingredient for the burrito didn't include fries and not a mention of how spicy it was and I can handle some heat. Then the taco. Another disappointment as it had jalapeño as well and we were not tasting anything at this point. It fell apart in my hand and it tasted awful. The fried fish was soggy and was covered with so much batter that you could barely see the fish inside. We just wanted to leave so we went to the cash and waited another 15 mins of the 2 waitresses walking by us ignoring our presence. Not even a "" ill be with you in a min"" our waitress decided to clean our table spot while we waited standing like tourists. I really don't see what the big fuss with this place is about and I rarely leave a bad review but this was just such a disappointment."

Every item on the menu is overpriced, and the staff have never been particularly attentive to me or my party in the several times that I have visited. I used to live in the southwest, and though I was very excited to see a frito pie on the menu, I was sorely disappointed by it. Not even real fritos! Had the consistency of stale deep fried tortilla strips.

/user_details?userid=o_G9cuzzwQv5f2lCbF0Cuw,Tim S.,"Portland, OR",3 star rating,"This is a decidedly Montreal take on a classic Texas staple: the ice house. The concept of the ice house is this: it's damn hot outside, so let's sit in the shade, order a bucket of cheap beer, and let our dogs run around. So what then is an establishment like this doing in Montreal? I don't know the answer to that, but the similarities to Texas ice houses stop at the decor, meaning the decor is Texas themed. They have Shiner Bock posters up, but do not serve Shiner, what gives? Next departure would be prices. Ice houses are supposed to serve a bucket of cheap, light beer cans (Lone Star, Shiner, Coors, Bud, ect. choose your piss-water). Instead beer here is still piss-water, but damn expensive piss-water, even by the pitcher. Never far from an ice house is a $1 taco truck serving up delicious street tacos. Montreal's Ice House serves delicious food, but it's $$$. Have you ever paid $16 for a burrido? Now you can.

But not anymore. I was quite disappointed in the way they handle their clients if they happen to be a pair. Here's what happened: On our arrival we were asked if we would like to sit outside but declined because it was windy and cold. Despite there being 2 free seats at the bar we were told to wait - I did mention them to the waitress but she didn't acknowledge me. I just figured they don't use those seats for customers. After 10 mins of waiting in the cold a table was freed up and we were asked if we would like these seats but that we could only have them if we're willing to share with 2 other people. We said sorry, no thanks.  So a pair of ladies came in and was promptly seated at the 4pax table because they were okay sharing tables. Another 15 mins go by and two guys show up and the waitress asks them if they would like to sit at the two seats at the bar that were  free (but we thought it wasn't available because she ignored me when I asked about it), to which they reply: ""But these 2 were here before us""and she says""Ce n'est pas grave"" (Oh don't worry about it)And in they go to sit to eat. Why didn't see give those seats to us before and why is she letting them in before us?!Needless to say we were getting annoyed as it was the 3rd pair of people who were seated before us. We felt like we were being punished for not wanting to have our dinner right next to two strangers.Shortly after a table for 4 becomes free and after 5-10 mins of waiting (expecting they would give it to us..) I ask the other waiter what's the deal. I tell him we've been waiting 30+ mins in the cold and that there's a free table inside that we could use. He says ""We only have two 2pax tables and this is our policy."" I tell him it's a ridiculous policy and he shrugs it off and leaves.What a terrible way to treat your customers, especially when there's no one waiting behind us in line. It's not like we were even holding bigger groups back or anything. We just stood there incredulous and decided to leave. Lesser patient people would have made a much bigger fuss much earlier. Instead I felt this review would be enough to let others know that if you're a couple and don't wish to sit right against 2 strangers, you better hope those 2 places inside are free and that the waitress doesn't pick favorites."

Buckets of ribs and chicken some with potato and coleslaw- they are friendly but their style is aggressive. They will throw things onto the table (coleslaw, ribs)- there are no plates, just a roll of brown paper on the table- there are no knives and forks unless you ask for themThe good:- the ribs where very good- lobster burrito was also very good- positions where fair size, burrito was enough for an adultThe bad: - its very expensive, burrito was $20- they make you wait outside- the dont take reservations- if you are only 2 they will mostlikely ask you to sit with someone else unless a table of two is available...

Maybe you'd planned to go home and cook, but those plans are quickly being squashed by the urgent rumble in your tummy. Well, Icehouse is perfect for that moment.They don't take reservations, so it can be difficult to get a seat. It was getting on toward 10PM on a Thursday when I went and the place was still full (the patio especially packed), but we managed to score seats at the bar lining the wall, conveniently close to the paper towel dispensers on the wall (these aren't the neatest eats).I loved the bourbon lemonade and its mix of sweet and sour at just the right alcoholic strength (i.e. not too strong for me, a bit of a wimp that way, but you could definitely taste the bourbon). And the lobster burrito was an amazing combination of textures and flavors. Super satisfying and filling. Yum!My only complaint is that our meal was quite pricey for what it was. Our bill for two lobster burritos and two tumblers of bourbon lemonade came to almost $75 after tax and tip. That said, it would have been more reasonable had we not chosen lobster - the other mains are less expensive.I'll definitely return and try some other items on the menu (the tacos, for example).

I went alone, and the servers were very nice and attentive. I didn't know how the ordering process went though, so I made the mistake of getting my seat first then asking for a menu. There is no ""menu"" per se, it's written on the board inside, so you have to read there and then order. Also, it's only in French.  Ordered the fried chicken tacos and a beer ($17 for both). At first, it looked like there wasn't much chicken in the tacos, just pure lettuce, but underneath was a fair share of chicken. The chicken had a bit of a fishy taste to it, I'm assuming it was in the same batter or same oil as the chicken? Nonetheless, it was pretty good. Crispy outside, juicy inside. I didn't like the fact that there were tons of jalapeno chunks inside the taco though. Perhaps they should serve those on the side, or put less? Also, why don't places ever use corn tortillas?? I think they make tacos taste much better. I wasn't super full from my meal, but full enough. Getting a dessert would have been nice, if I was able to read the menu from the outside.

Since it's only about 100 feet away from me, I figured it was only a matter of time before I stopped in for a beer anyway. When I heard they had good bourbon lemonade, I was sold, since it's pretty hard to find good bourbon outside of the U.S. The bourbon lemonade was pretty tasty, though fairly pricey as well, considering that it is not very strong. I know alcohol is more pricey in Canada in general, especially for things like imported bourbon (they use Maker's Mark in their drinks). But, I couldn't help but think that the bourbon lemonade was all part of the owner's business plan to serve people salty food that they greedily wash down with sweet, expensive drinks in order to run up their bills.The menu features all kinds of regional American cuisine, though you'd never be able to eat the things they serve here at a single place in America. For BBQ, you go to a BBQ place. For seafood, you go to a seafood place. For tacos, you go to a taco place. Once more, you're not likely to find great seafood and great bbq in many of the same geographical regions in the U.S., so not only would it be hard to find these items in the same restaurant, but it would be hard to eat them all in the same state.The fish tacos my table ordered were quite delicious. I did not eat any of the oysters the table ordered, though they reported they were delicious as well. We enjoyed everything for the most part until the bill came - everything was priced a bit higher than we would've expected.The place is very tiny inside - it looks more enjoyable when the patio is open."
/user_details?userid=UvZKaPFy85iPjoB2Aj40kQ,Oleg R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Icehouse is a controversially good place. I've been postponing a visit there for a long time for one very annoying reason - they don't take reservations. And I don't go to places where I don't have a guaranteed table. Me and long lines are clearly not friends. Anyways, Icehouse is an interesting take on a New American cuisine taqueria style:Location: located one block from the St Laurent madness, it's very convenient to stop by for those awesome tacosReception: this place doesn't take reservations, and is a little too proud/arrogant about it. I understand that one of them has studied economics 101 and figured out that low supply (or impression of it) will result in higher demand. Food is not economics. You have influencers, who get pissed off at waiting and no reservations, and you have everyone else who will follow influencers. I personally know at least 20 foodies, who refuse to go to Icehouse just because they don't like the uncertainty and possibility of waiting. Ambiance: it's a garage converted into a restaurant. Super simple design, good, crowded, loud ambiance. Slightly pretentious in its simplicity, but still interesting. Food: food is great. I had all kinds of tacos, burrito, sides - it is all good. Sometimes a bit too much sauce or parsley, but guess what - tastes differ. Drinks: they don't have coffee, tea, or anything non-alcoholic except water and lemonade. So if you don't drink, you are shit out of luck. And no espresso after your dinner. Suck it up and go to second cup around the corner. And then re-read my point about pretentiousness/arrogance above. Conclusion: I will only go back there on weekdays around 6-7pm, since this is when they will likely have free tables. If they don't (and they don't take reservations), I will totally log back on here and change this review to a much worse one. Note to owners: People, there is opentable, telephone, text messages, internet, mail pigeons for gods sake to take reservations. If you don't make enough money to install phone/computer to take reservations, I'm sure there will be plenty of Montreal yelpers who will donate enough money to buy you a netbook! I will be the first one!"
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Living downtown has a number of perks. One of the big ones on my end is the proximity I have to so many great restaurants. It hits the bank account a bit but when I get a craving for a certain type of food, I am usually close enough to a restaurant that can satisfy my desires. Last Friday, I had a serious hankering of some tex-mex BBQ. Luckily for me, I am a short walk away from one of the best Montreal has to offer. So I called up a buddy who I knew would enjoy the experience, we braved the cold and made our way to Icehouse. Icehouse is chef Nick Hodge's second restaurant, he of Kitchenette fame. This small, probably 30 seat space in the Plateau serves up comfort food with a decidedly Texas flare. Tacos, Burritos, fried chicken, ribs. You come here hungry and you most certainly leave here stuffed.As soon as we walked in the door, we were given a complimentary cup of warmed Dr.Pepper with bourbon. Warm and sweet, the bourbon added a nice kick to it. Given the stiff cold we had to deal with outside, it was a most welcomed surprise. Once that drink was done, we each ordered a glass of the house Bourbon Lemonade. I simply love this drink. The perfect balance of sweetness and sour of the homemade lemonade with the punch of the bourbon. When I've been here in the summer, there is nothing better than ordering a full pitcher and enjoying it on the small terrasse outside. Regardless of the food you order when you visit, the Bourbon Lemonade is an absolutely must.As an entree, we ordered the queso fundido with chorizo. While I had expected a little more chorizo that we got, it was a very good dish. The consistency was good - thick enough that it stuck to the tortilla chips but not so much that the chips broke when you dipped in. Nice balance of the cheeses - slightly sharpeness but still mild enough. A good start.For the mains, my buddy ordered the Lobster burrito with pico de gayo, corn and chips. As a side, he ordered some fries. Now I am not a burrito guy. Really not. This one here may have changed that. Absolutely stuffed with lobster, so much so that my buddy was a little surprised, the combo of the lobster with the pico de gayo and the corn had a great balance to it. The fries were perfectly executed as well.On my end, I ordered the half bucket of HP sauce ribs that comes with coleslaw, smoked potato salad and a buttermilk biscuit. The biscuit was flaky and rich. The coleslaw is more of the creamy variety if we were to use the St-Hubert coleslaw scale but still light enough to offset the richness of the potato salad. The Ribs were picture perfect. Just fall off the bone good. The sauce had a nice smokiness and sweeteners that basically made you want to suck up every drop of the sauce that was on the paper towel laid below the ribs. It is so good that once the ribs were done (and believe me, that didn't take very long), we dropped the fries into the sauce and finished them off that way. Believe me, if you order the ribs, you need a few towelettes but frankly you won't care.Icehouse is one of my absolute favorites since I discovered it last year. Note for couples, it is not the place for a quiet sit down meal. Despite its small size, it gets relatively noisy quickly pretty on top of the great music that they play throughout the evening. We walked out of there waddling slightly but very happy about the meal we just had - just like every other time I have visited.If you are looking for a cool, relaxed setting to enjoy a great meal, Icehouse should be high on your list.Cheers!"
/user_details?userid=8apKnC2iVfWnfB4cIgUBMw,Jason L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Icehouse takes the meaning of ""a bucket of chicken"" to a whole new level... because it literally comes in an actual bucket - a metal one, not one made of cardboard that will eventually turn see-through. Thin battered crispy fried chicken covered with a couple of hot sauce shakes. The chicken was juicy and really soft, which leads me to believe that they were sitting in a vat of buttermilk before they met their impending fry-o-lator doom.One friend had the lobster burrito. This thing was the size of her head. Stuff with generous chunks of lobster, corn, homemade corn chips, black beans and drenched in a tarragon aoli, The burrito was the size of a football... if the football was the size of a Nalgene bottle. I had a bite of it and it was really delicious. I really enjoyed the crunch from the chips against the bite of lobster. My friend made it a point to tell us how good it was because she said it after every bite, and made these faces that even *I* felt violated for the burrito."

Different flavours of burritos and tacos but also other stuff so you'll probably be able to find something you like. I had a chicken burrito and jalapeño poppers.. Honestly I wouldn't come here for burritos again, but the jalapeño poppers were tasty so I imaging that other stuff is tasty too.. But the burrito had very litte flavour, but the fries were tasty, crispy and salty/flavourful (not included with burrito). They do have a number of fun hot sauces to try (at no extra cost of course), one was in the millions of Scoville units, it's fun to try and dare your friends.The iced tea that I ordered tasted like salt - not like a real iced tea (despite it being homemade in house).I think that it a chill fun and unique place to try, I would go again with a group of friends to hang out but I wouldn't go with the sole intention of eating their food - although it's by no means bad, I just wouldn't crave it as nothing really stood out, except maybe the poppers.Fyi expect to have to wait a bit for your table, but they have heaters outside to help you not freeze while waiting on their patio even in pseudo winter weather."

Do not drink on an empty stomach or you may end up tipsy before you start eating. The lobster burrito is incredible. It has chunks of lobster in it, black beans, corn and some sauce. It is one of the main reasons to go.  The fried chicken is also very tender. The presentation is great. The waiter puts a paper over the table, turns the bucket upside down. All the chicken scatters on the paper and enjoy. They also have a variety of hot sauces (if you like things spicy) you can add to any meal. The seven layer dip is beautiful. It has the right amount of creaminess. With perfectly fried tortilla chips.  Every time I go I get the popcorn shrimp and the lobster burrito and I have yet to be disappointed."

The chicken, although harder than most fried chicken, was  double fried and had a great taste to it. We loved the flavour of the sauce they used over it. My personal preference would be that the batter wasn't as hard and crunchy but it was still so tasty that I wasn't bothered by it. The coleslaw and potato salad were top notch; both very tangy and flavorful. I'm not usually a cornbread liker but even this was good. Not as dry as most I've tried.

/user_details?userid=IIVTHna4vd7EOJJTKaS5uw,Angeline C.,"Singapore, Singapore",2 star rating,"Chicken smashing!!! Okay, I must admit that I arrived at Icehouse with high expectation after seeing it aired on Food Network TV Canada few weeks ago while in Ottawa. I have a couple on my list after my Ottawa stay and is trying to clear as much as I could if they are within reach. Since Icehouse is within our radar, we decided then to explore the area where Saint Laurent Boulevard would lead us. The street is long and in between, I spotted some of my ""must-eat"" gems and marked the landmark to make a return. Turning right into one of the lane, I enter a quaint street away from the crowd from St Laurent and into rue Roy E. I excitedly trying to eyeball for Icehouse while focusing on my GPS assisted google map working in the background. Smart enough, I knew I have arrived! I rolled my eyes to the left and couldn't hide my excitement when I saw the signage with a calf standing atop the grilling at the entrance. The day's business has just began, it's 15mins past 4pm. We were their 1st couple on Thursday! We chose our 2-seater and the lady came to us with a glass of tap and asked if we wanna start off with some drinks. Bourbon lemonade's  a winner, leave the ice tea out! The latter is so tad sourish and lifeless for a $4 while I enjoyed the former much even though it cost slightly higher at $9. The lady politely introduced the special for the day and told us the menu is on the chalkboard right above the bar counter. Right away, I admitted that I came here for their fried chicken and she was happy to list me all the sides that came with it. Well, I guess she's thrilled about the media publicity seems to work. We were the only Asian gals in the petite dining room. Crowd floods the room soon. Within 15minutes, she returned with a brown parchment paper ripped off from its roll and laid it on our table, along with 2 forks and towelettes. Along with, she brought along 2 condiments that she sing praises: less spicy nectarous mustard sauce and another more fiery one. I opt for the former while my sister went for the latter. I agreed with the lady that the condiments did a good job on the fried chicken for a more flavorful experience.Seriously, I do not know what makes a good tex-mex fried chicken but if it was going to be something I had at Icehouse, then I will be disappointed. The chicken parts  were decent in size, not too small. But the problem we had lies in its rock-liked crust. I am not sure if that was how it meant to be when u claimed that its a Tex classic? The meat was bland, bare and unseasoned. If that's the reason for the hot/sweet mustard condiments to work magic on, then there's no way I would agree more. If the DP sauce has been a bit generous, then the deeply fried bird could be coated well in the vinegary element to reverse its disastrous fate. The texture in the parts were tough but slightly better in the drumstick and wing parts that form 2/5 of the half basket. It will be questionable to spend $18/5 fried chicken only to get a dry texture wrapped around a thick layer of battered stone crust, extremely charred. But I did appreciate the buttermilk biscuits which are intensely buttered in taste, moist and soft, very moreish! The biscuit was baked thick and good for 2. Then comes the 2 salads that I loved the creaminess with a hint of tanginess in the soft boiled new potatoes. The slaw did a good job too. Slight tart and very refreshing, a good companion to ward off any greasiness. I enjoyed the causal dining atmosphere but less on the famed fried chicken. I guess they have other well deserving dishes which I didn't mange to try, perhaps the burrito is one? Not sure."

My sister on the other hand warned me that it really wasn't worth trying, she was right.The service was horrible!! The concept of not having a menu for every table and only having it on the wall really fails to work when your location is L shaped and half the restaurant has to get up and awkwardly stand beside other tables as they eat and chat while you in a rushed fashion try and decide what you'd like to eat.I was willing to put the crappy service, crappy menu placement and lame, nasty, gimmicky serving aside (they basically dump the food on the table) as long as I was about to eat some great food, that didn't happen either. We were a large enough group with big enough bellies that we were able to sample almost all that the menu had to offer and didn't find a single item worth going back for not to mention that their fried chicken has to be one of the nastiest things I've ever tasted.You won't be seeing me at icehouse anytime soon and I know that I speak for everyone that was with me in saying...not deserving of the hype"

When we ordered a beer, a coke, and a glass of water, he snarkily responded, ""Oh yeah, part-tay!"" We were there with a person who had a food allergy and we asked him for a suggestion of what he could order, and the watier responded in a very dismissive manner. ""Just tell me what you want to eat,"" he said. When we mentioned that two of us were planning to share a bucket of chicken, he suggested we go for the large version. Now neither my friend nor I are Jabba the Hutt, so there was no way in hell two people could finish so much chicken. He then forgot to place our order and left without telling us he was switching servers. We had to order again after 30 minutes and when the food did come, it was giant baseballs of chicken and they were thrown unceremoniously on the table on a brown paper mat. There were two measly halves of a biscuit thrown in with the chicken, and when we bit into one of them, we noticed that it had the consistency of chewing gum and realized that it was still raw. We thought that they were apologizing by giving us a discount on the chicken (charging us for the small bucket rather than the large), but after we paid, our waitress realized that she had mixed up our order with someone else's. We were then forced to pay for this disgusting bucket of chicken.  Wouldn't recommend this to even Jabba the Hutt!farm5.staticflickr.com/4…"

When my friend suggested Icehouse for dinner, I decided, why not. I should have gone with my instincts.We ordered the fried chicken bucket. The fried skin was as hard as a rock and had a strange tang to it. Once I was able to get under the skin, I found that the chicken was undercooked (pink in some places). The biscuits were also undercooked, with a jelly of raw dough in the middle. Disgusting!Not only that, the waitstaff was incredibly rude. They might want to take a lesson from the people whose food they're (doing a very poor job of) imitating and learn a thing or two about Southern hospitality. When we sat down, our waiter asked us if we were ready to order. When we said we didn't have menus, he got really impatient with us and told us that the menu was on the wall. He then preceded to ignore us for 20 whole minutes. When he finally did take our orders, he got impatient when one of our party was indecisive and left our table. In the end, we got our food 2 hours after we were seated. Some places have bad food but nice service. Other places have good food but bad service. This restaurant, having both bad food and bad service, has absolutely no redeeming features.

Where once stood a mexican style restaurant with a great tequila menu but hardly the clientele to support it, Ice House now has taken over, boasting a constantly packed house of patrons eager to fill their belly's with authentic Texas style eats.What's Really Good: We've got two words for you: Lobster burrito. Yup I said it. The Fried Chicken is good too. Ice House has what I call a ""lo-fi restaurant style"". With its simple brown paper tablecloth, chalkboard menus and diner style napkins and cutlery, Ice House is pleasant and welcoming, especially considering there really is no sexy way to dig into a bucket of pork ribs or the aforementioned fried chicken, (both available in half or full bucket servings.)The taco menu also offers you the usual, chicken, steak, seafood and veggie options. You'll find all the other Texan fixens such as popcorn chicken, crab cakes, wings, oyster po-boy's and a brisket sandwich.You'll wanna know: Depending on the day, the bourbon lemonade can set you on a fast-track to a blackout (my personal preference) or taste like liquid sour patch kids. If you prefer consistency, opt for a nice spicy caesar. When you think you've ordered enough, go for one more dish. Sharing is caring after all. Finally, the atmosphere is awesome. Ice House is loud, fun, vibrant, and most probably full of familiar faces. You'll definitely be tempted walk out with your top button undone."

The chicken and red fish tacos were good. The stuffed jalapenos were excellent (but don't bother if you can't handle some fire). Good location for people watching, and the napkin dispensers on the wall are great idea since these can be some pretty messy eats. Perfect for a late evening meal before heading out on the town. I'll be back."

This was a sick display and offensive, as staff offered us 3 tequila shots or a free desert but charged us (very overpriced to start) for the chicken with no real apology. Eating here is a health risk, staff are arrogant, the menu and design are overpriced mock brooklyn, GIRLS + Ubisoft, with attitude. Massive GMO still bleeding? Come on. Southern food in Montreal? No thanks."

/user_details?userid=2av488ePvb-Z4qgeNDpWCg,Emilie M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I have mixed feelings about the Icehouse. The first couple times I went with friends were awesome. The Bourbon lemonades, the crab-filled jalapeno poppers and the fish tacos are amazing. They also make this awesome watermelon-tequila drink of which you will dangerously want a whole picher for yourself!! But lately I took my boyfriend there since I had been craving for more of their awesome food and we were extreeeeemely disapointed. The cheese-sauce and steak burrito is such a bummer, filled with french fries (why??) and it was way too sloppy. But that was nothing compared to the fried chicken. There are no words to express how bad that was - hard as rock, badly frie chunks of chicken. I give it a 3 stars because their drinks and apps are great but I would definitely recommend you stick to the basic tacos and avoid the chicken bucket!!!"

The skin was not edible and the meat was dry. Yuck. The drinks were decent though, I'll give them that. I won't be going back."

Everything was really good but the lobster burrito hit it out the ballpark for me. The drinks are not too strong and complement the food really well. 2. Service is fun and friendly. The atmosphere of the place is very cool and relaxed. Great place for drinks and food at night.CONS:1. Pricey but I'd say it's a place you'd only go once in a blue moon, so the cost is worth it.OVERALL:-I'd recommend it and would go back.-Worth every penny!"
/user_details?userid=9r15-GGBQ4cwNt54tNxMYQ,Nicole G.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This review is long overdue, but hey, better late than never! I had heard a lot about Icehouse and that it was a must-try resto in Montreal. I am a fan of Southern comfort food so we ventured here for a friend's birthday in November (the month is relevant, you will see why soon enough). I had heard that it was rather small, and found out they did not in fact take reservations. When we arrived, we saw why; they have a max. seating of 25 people (we were originally 15 people in our party, of which 6 ended up staying to actually eat). We had given our name to the ""hostess"" (mind you, there wait staff takes on the hipster ""I'm too cool for you"" attitude which can be very off-putting) and were told it would be awhile. We ended up ordering drinks on the patio (which had heaters, but it was mid-November and pretty nippy out, so not ideal). We ordered a pitcher of beer, which came out half-head (such a rip off) and ended up costing 23$. After about 30 minutes of waiting outside, our group dwindled down to 6 people. We had debated leaving, at which point I went inside to pay for the pitcher, and was met with a rude ""we're not allowed to only sell alcohol, you have to order food too"" speech from one of the waitresses. I explained to her that we had been waiting for over half an hour and had yet to be seated inside. We eventually decided to stay anyways, and were told that we could eat outside if we wanted to. Although I did not like the idea, we ended up staying. After ordering more drinks outside, a table freed up inside which we quickly grabbed. The tables are by no means capable of holding 5 big guys (and me), but we squished in and made due as we had no alternative. We each placed our order; I had the shrimp po-boy, while others around the table ordered 1/2 bucket ribs + 1/2 bucket fried chicken, full bucket of ribs, etc. Although our orders were, by my standards simple and easy to understand, the wait staff still managed to make a mistake. Instead of 1/2 & 1/2, they brought a full bucket of fried chicken and 2 half buckets of ribs. After explicitly explaining that they made a mistake (as they fought us on the issue saying that that was what we ordered), they brought out another 1/2 bucket of ribs. The food was decent, but not close to being as comforting as authentic southern food. And the wait staff left something to be desired in the customer service area... That being said, I would not recommend this place, nor would I willingly go back."

I can't bring myself to order anything other than the lobster burrito as a main (though have sampled other people's fare) and have always found it to be perfect. The appetizers are alway perfect for sharing (popcorn shrimp, jalapeño poppers and oysters have always been crowd pleaders). The only thing I am not a fan of is the potato salad.... though this has more to do with personal preference than the quality of the product. The service is friendly and the locale charming. Wash it all down with a bourbon lemonade and you'll be set.... Get there early or you'll be waiting awhile."
/user_details?userid=c_t1YkYP1c962tHQqFBXtA,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Just came back from the Icehouse and it was amazing.We had trouble finding it at first since its really small and not well indicated.  Luckily, we found it and got a table. The place is soooooo small! it has 4 large picnic tables, 3 small tables made for two people and counter space.  Super quaint and super cute though. To drink, i had a bourbon lemonade....... SO GOOD. went down the hatch pretty well. my friend had a normal gin and tonic.To eat, we were recommended the crab cakes, lobster burrito, chicken wings, short rib tacos and bbq chicken tacos (new to the menu).The crab cakes were the best i have ever tasted, Crispy outside, tender inside, and tasted only of crab. We settled on two different kinds of tacos (comes 2 on a plate); the short rib and bbq chicken. The short rib taco was a bit dry to my liking but my friend thought it was awesome.... so varying opinions. The BBQ chicken was amazing! it was topped with fried brussel sprouts..... really interesting. On the side, we ordered a biscuit. it was really good and ginormous. Next time, try a bucket. they just empty it out in front of you on the table. Cool concept. Total bill: 53$ not bad for the amount of food we had and quality.Tip: get there early since there is limited seating and don't expect to be there long. Service is quick and efficient."
/user_details?userid=cAuun3J7hefatKrhfkY-Hg,Britt M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I went to Ice House this evening after reading a great review in Night life Magazine. I thought the atmosphere and the set up was fantastic. Little red tables, tight cozy terrace. The music was great and the place just felt like home cooking. The waitstaff was fair but don't ask the bartender a thing she was a bit rude. The food was good to mediocre I got the fried chicken basket $18 bucks for 4 pieces and two sides, creamy coleslaw and potatoes with a buttery biscuit. I've had better fried chicken in my life the biscuit was great the sides had a bit too much mayo for my preference. They don't skimp in their alcoholic lemonade. The only thing that bothered me was getting a pink piece of fried chicken and having the waiter try to convince me to eat the pink chicken. After much discussion about how I didn't want to risk eating pink chicken he eventually brought me another (much smaller) piece. I think when you serve someone even slightly semi cooked chicken your immediate response should be Im so sorry I'll get you some more. Go to Ice bar for the atmosphere and drinks but t don't expect an overly amazing meal."
/user_details?userid=_PlVMtt4bwiOAalr1wso9A,Grant H.,"Victoria, Canada",4 star rating,"First and foremost, come here for the eats.  When one walks in to this fine little hidden gem amongst the rough of lower Plateau they are immediately confronted with a comfortable and relaxed décor, some punk music jamming on the stereo (as was the case tonight), and plenty of happy patrons enjoying delicious grub.I tried all of the different tacos (chicken, ribs, porc, portobello, ""red-fish"") and was happily surprised at all the results.  Everything was delicious and the waiter brought out some home-made tabasco and habanero sauces which were very much appreciated.As far as the drinks go...not my cup of tequila.  Don't get me wrong, the bar offers great options as far as unadulterated beverages (tequila, gentlemen jack, etc.) but the Micalada (not too certain on that pronoun nor its spelling) which is essentially a caesar with beer in lieu of vodka and mexican soy sauce and worcestershire in lieu of clamato (not really like a caesar...) was an underwhelming and underboozy beverage for my taste.  I attempted to order a pitcher of margarita (hey, I'm from California) and was informed that it would a) cost $50 and b) be worth it.  Overall, a) it did but b) it definitely was not.  I don't know about you other yelpers, but when I drink a margarita i expect to taste tequila.  If I wanted to drink candy, I could go drink at any crappy bar on the lower main.  If I wanted to pay an insane amount of money for said candy beverage, I could ask some idiot first-year from McGill where Candy Bar is.In any case, I can get a nice little drink at Else's down the street, and head over to Icehouse for a delicious little snack.  After yoga at Moksha, of course."
/user_details?userid=IM6ss5QP852np0C4Ponv2g,Concertina F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A friend and I passed by Icehouse last Tuesday. I had heard a lot of fairly positive things about it, as well as some grumbling about price... so it was high time that I made it over there to formulate my own opinion. We arrived before 8 o'clock and the place was almost completely full. We managed to get seats at the counter on the terrasse, which turned out to be the most awkward restaurant seating I've experienced in a while. The counter is too shallow to comfortably sit straight, yet the chairs are too close together to be able to sit sideways without being forced to play footsie with your neighbor. Not to mention, on a beautiful summer day when you want to sit outside and do some people-watching, you've actually got your back turned to the action and you're facing a wall. Moral of the story: don't sit at the counter.We started off with the bourbon lemonade, which was very tasty and generous on the booze. I had two of these over the course of the evening and I was definitely tipsy, even after all the food we ate. Yum.Between the two of us, we shared the fish tacos, the lobster burrito and a side of the jalapenos stuffed with crab. The fish tacos were entirely forgettable - I can't even remember what they tasted like. Probably nothing. The lobster burrito on the other hand, was really really REALLY good. Wow, yum. I think the stuffed jalapenos were good too, but the lobster burrito was so tasty that I went into obsession mode and literally couldn't think of anything else while I was eating it.We were still hungry, so we decided to order an oyster po boy to share. It was really tasty, but not much like the oyster po boys I've had in New Orleans. I was also thrown off by the fact that the waiter described a po boy as a ""sandwich that basically has anything fried in it"". Not quite, buddy. In any case, I definitely understand the appeal of this sandwich. Messy, saucy and tasty. I really wish there were more oysters though. We cut our sandwich in half and I only had one oyster in my half. (To be fair though, my friend had tons in his half). It was good, but the lobster burrito was better. Or... maybe I was just hungrier when I ate the burrito. Who knows.The total with tax and tip was well over $100, which, yes, is way too expensive for what it is. But next time, I would just grab a lobster burrito at $20, and that's it. No $9 bourbon lemonade X 2 next time. Okay, so it's not exactly a ""cheap eat"", but cheap lobster is kind of an oxymoron.Service is... not fantastic, but it wasn't BAD either. This is a fun place with a casual vibe, so no, you won't be doted on, but you'll get your food with no problems.Would I go back? Sure. I probably wouldn't order any fried chicken or ribs because I've spent time in the southern US and I'm not sure that Icehouse can hold a candle to the freakishly good side-of-the-road cheap wonders that I gobbled up down there. But it's a fun place. Just don't sit at the counter."

The place we'd originally wanted was packed to the rafters so we started to walk back to the car when...there was Icehouse. 2 folks from Ottawa, one from Toronto and my partner and myself - we were greeted promptly and the friendly and welcoming service continued right through the experience. Drinks were not only great but special requests were accommodated without a second thought. I am in love with the bourbon lemonade, so refreshing and wickedly wonderful.  We sat out on the porch and had THE best time. Didn't want too much to eat but the old fashioned beef tacos really hit the spot. The Ottawa folks asked for some of the fried chicken with one taking the coleslaw and the other the potato salad. The raves over the chicken, the incredible corn bread kept coming with superlatives being added with almost every mouthful. I personally loved the potato salad though some found it too sweet. The coleslaw was just right. I can't wait to go back there and really dive into some of their other dishes. What a find! What a treat!"

But was quickly disappointed, not so much by the food, but the poor service that we received. Our waitress was outwardly rude to us throughout the evening - like she decided when we sat down she didn't like us! We asked for help with the menu since it was our first time, and just told us to go look at it. When our food arrived, the coleslaw splattered all over my friend, when it was dropped on the table. Accidents happen, but when our waiter realized it, they weren't any ways apologetic and didn't even offer a wet-napkin for her to clean up the coleslaw that was on her dress and hair. The coleslaw also splattered all over her drink glass, when we asked for a new glass, our waitress looked as us confused, ""you want to wipe it""? No, we'd like a new glass since this was smothered in coleslaw. We ordered the fried chicken and 7-layer dip and the food itself was good and something I would normally enjoy.

Tons of attitude.   The menu on the wall was noy visible from half the restaurant.  I asked for a menu and the girl looked at me and told me it was on the wall and to stand up.   I get that they are trying to give a certain feel to this place, but if you can't get the food to make up for it then it fails.   I've been told the cooks have changed in the last few months so I'm going to blame it on  that.   I do not recommend even trying this place.   Horrible.   There are many new BBQ place in the city that are cheaper and better"
