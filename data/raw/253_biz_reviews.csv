Boy were we disappointed. We were a group of 7 on a Friday evening.  4 of us began our meal with the Spring rolls, 2 had the fried Imperial rolls and one got a Won Ton soup. The rice paper on the Springs rolls were so hard to bite through that it was so chewy and hard  and not enjoyable. It was served raw! They did not taste fresh. The fried imperial rolls were good. The won ton soup was bland and boring. We all then took main dishes. The Pho soup broth was very underwhelming and disappointing. For a place to charge 14$ for a Pho soup, it better be damn flavourful and satisfying. It was so bland. The papaya salad had no whoa factor and the veggie curry was just a mess. Although the service was great and the waiters were super sweet we 7 highly do not recommend this place. For the prices they charge for Viet food, you can get much much better in Chinatown or any other hole in the wall Vietnamese restaurant. We all kind of looked at each other while we had our first bites of food and we quickly regretted our decision on picking this place. Thumbs down!"
