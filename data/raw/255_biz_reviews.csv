The order came with the gluten mention on the bill , really nicely presented take out bowls, same quality of delicious meals i have come to expect from them. Overall super satisfied and will definitely order from there again..."

I was surprised that this title went to a vegan place but here we are. Seriously though, the lasagna is amazing. I've had their other food also (the burger, Mac and cheese, cheesecake) but I think I will definitely come back just for the lasagna. Prices are reasonable considering you're downtown. You'll be spending around $20/person, not including drinks. The lavender latte is also one of the best I've ever had. It's a bit pricy ($5.50) but it was so creamy and rich. Service is phenomenal. Their waitstaff are super attentive and energetic. I always feel like I'm in a fancy place when I go here. To top off the great service, the actual restaurant is super aesthetically pleasing. You can also reserve tables as I know it tends to get busy. Overall, a very positive experience!"
/user_details?userid=XODoytYipc9zy6Wx9MnebQ,Alice A.,"Sacramento, CA",4 star rating,"Love LOV!First time visiting LOV and ordered take-out due to tight schedule. We orded the LOV poutine (fries, miso gravy, vegan mozzarella) and the BBQ Burger (jackfruit, lettuce, tomato, caramelized onion, aioli) with salad. This was my first Montreal poutine...and it was freaking amazing! The gravy was spot on and with the hunks of cheese, this plate of fries was just the right about of salty goodness.Most restaurants in the states do not handle jackfruit very well, but the LOV version of the BBQ jackfruit burger holds it shape through each bite! The tangy BBQ flavors all come together for this delightful burger. The side salad is a good breakaway from the saltiness of the meal. Since our take-out experience was superb and the restaurant looked amazing, we came back for a full dinner experience a few days later! I was really craving some Asian food so we started with their Dumplings appetizer (mushroom, vegetables, almond butter, kimchi sauce). Each dumpling was perfectly crispy and the sauce was thick and spicy- this appetizer was tasted amazing!First main entree was a cold dish, the Pok'ai' (cauliflower rice, cucumber, avocado, compressed watermelon, edamame, cashew, wakame, shiso, sesame and ginger sauce) mimics the poke bowl. This was a very raw and refreshing take on the popular Hawaiian poke bowl. The second main entree was the Mushroom Risotto (arborio rice, cashew cream, oyster mushroom, green peas, vegan parmesan). This creamy dish was a lot heavier than it sounded and can probably feed two or save half for a second meal! The peppered mushrooms were great in this dish. And the highlight of the night...the creme brulee! The thick sugary shell and the warm creme waiting underneath was a match made in heaven! Overall a lovely dinning experience with excellent customer service!"
/user_details?userid=l9fGOqjEQDEN10Pog3cMng,Xena W.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"LOV used to be vegetarian but now it is fully vegan. I would say that the appetizer options are way better than the main dishes... I had the quinoa fritters which were so-so (they were a bit mushy, could've been a lot crispier), but I would've liked to try their avocado toast, arancini, mushroom tempura, mac n cheese, and poutine. For my main dish I had the truffles and caviar, which is zucchini noodles topped with tapioca caviar and mushrooms. The mushrooms and tapioca were fragrant and delicious, but the zoodles were a bit bland and kind of hard. The portions are small and quite expensive (expect 25-30$ per person). The atmosphere is sleek and minimalist, and the menu is made from 100% recycled paper. I applaud their eco-friendliness. I probably won't come back but I don't regret trying this restaurant. It's always great to see more vegetarian and vegan restaurants popping up."

It's really not as hard as people think it is to make delicious vegan food.However, Lov is one of those places that over-complicates vegan food. I want to tell them that vegan doesn't have to mean super-healthy, kale everything, and horrible fake cheese everywhere! Unfortunately, every time I've been here, that's what I've had.The highlight is the kimchi poutine, but the only resemblance it has to poutine is the fact that it contains fries. The gravy is replaced by mayo, and the cheese curds with kimchi, so... how is that a poutine? It's super tasty but not AT ALL what it's described as!A lot of the dishes here are pale imitations of carnivorous or omnivorous foods and I really wish that I could go to a vegan restaurant that could just... make good foods that happen to be vegan! Please! I don't want any more cheeze! Or fake bacon! There are so many dishes that don't use meat or dairy without having to resort to cashews and kale! I BEG YOU!"

I love their creation, everything tastes so good and you don't even think about it being vegetarian. The service is excellent and this location is bigger. I really recommend their burgers, caesar salad, tacos, and soups! They are so filling and delicious. Their poutine is good too but I've had many friends tell me they find it too salty and they don't like the vegan cheese."

The decor was a nice white vintage look and very spacious. It took a while before we were seated, but the service was great. I got the Mac and cheese with sausage, while the girlfriend got the waffle with strawberry. We shared a smoothie.The Mac and cheese was very light on taste but had a cheesy flavourful nonetheless. The waffle, however, was extremely chewy and unpleasant to eat. Perhaps it was because of the vegan flour that had to be used in its preparation. Even then, I would not recommend. The best part of the meal was definitely the hashbrown, because it was crispy and well seasoned."

/user_details?userid=0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA,Joi B.,"Hudson Valley, NY",5 star rating,"More love for (yet another) LOV. I have been to their location on McGill twice now and pretty much adored the food, the vibe, the just about everything. But this LOV had me at the front door. And, more importantly, this LOV had me at that incredible vegan cheese plate. What a stunning place, with its greenery peeking out from everywhere, blonde woods and merry lighting. Everything is a Pinterest dream and if you don't believe me, just take a look in the damn ladies room because that use of a toilet for a planter is about the coolest thing I've ever seen. This LOV will appeal to lovers and friends alike, as it lends itself well to both intimate tête-à-tête and small gatherings (there's so much space!) I think the only thing I didn't love about the location on McGill was how my friend and I were crammed in on the high top family table, but it was a couple years back when they first opened. Still, that memory makes me more likely to pick this location over that one. Our friendly host sat us wherever we wanted as it was a cold snowy Tuesday night and we had our choice. Honestly, there's not a bad spot in the house, a rarity in restaurants! We chose to sit up front by the windows and next to the bar, a positively cozy, but pleasantly bright little spot. I'll be the first person to turn my nose up at a Mimosa (look, I just want more damn Champagne), but I could never pass up a Mimosa made with with pear juice! Whole next level (and a bit more of a Bellini, which I also prefer). I had one, it was delicious, if a bit on the sweet side, and then switched over to the Prosecco. I think it would make a great choice for dessert.The cheese plate deserves its own paragraph, friends. That cheese plate. Mon Dieu! It came out and I died a thousand deaths with one bite of the herbed smoky Gouda-esque cashew cheese. Then there was a tangy Bleu cheese made with Spirulina, a work of edible art. A creamier, slightly sweet & nutty goat-style cheese rounded out the plate and the bubbled crostini made the perfect pairing (if you're into a sweet chutney, you'll love this, also on the board, but not really my thing). One of the best vegan cheese plates I've ever had.I also enjoyed the gnocchi, though I took a chance because it's a sweet potato gnocchi and I hate sweet potatoes. Luckily the sweet potato flavor was super subtle and the pesto/nutty parmesan dominated the plate, along with tons of arugula, which is my favorite. I'd probably order something else next time, but I enjoyed this dish very much.On to the cheesecake, a dense, super creamy NY-style, encrusted with nuts and delicately placed on a tart berry coulis. Perfection. If you must know, I cried a bit at first taste. This dessert belongs in some kind of cheesecake hall of fame. It's perfect to share as it's very rich and pleasantly dense. Decadence is always best in small portions, no?I cannot wait to return to Lov. It's truly become one of my favorite vegan restaurants."

I ended up being really sick afterwards, and I haven't been this sick in a long time from a restaurant. I have to say the restaurant is cute and charming. The service was very good, our servers were great. And a side note, the bathroom is pretty cool! You have to check out the design and decor ! My friend and I orders a few items to share. We had the nachos which were great and super good! I didn't think a healthy version of nachos with sweet potatoes would be so tasty. We asked for guacamole on the nachos but that never came and we were too hungry to wait. My ordered a burger which she loved and said tasted great. I ordered the poutine which was just awful. This is a very small portion and I didn't finish it. The gravy was over cooked and had a burnt aftertaste, it was too salty so I kept drinking water. It was also very thick and cold! I'm not sure if someone checked before pouring the gravy over the fries but it was goop. My friend tasted it and felt the same. I ended up finishing the nachos. They have a very interesting take on vegetarian/vegan meals, so I'm most likely to go back and try something else off the menu."

I had a captivating syrah that combined so well with the delicacies. Now, if you want a big group, let me advice you that I had to make a reservation by phone, since their website does not allow you to make one when you need a place for more than 10 people.Birthdays, Romantic dinner, business, or just a nice reason to treat yourself like a royalty, come to LOV.

If you want to sit outside during the summer, make sure you make reservations! the decor is adorable, the food is delicious (considering it's all vegan) We got the following items:*kale mac'n'cheese = does not taste like your typical buttery/cheesy mac and cheese but it's delicious! it was a bit dry for my own taste but does its magic for those that need dairy free goodness. *French toast = wow. this is a must get! It was delicious. * some Benedict dish with tofu (I forget the name ) = delicious!! Also worth getting. Their fries were perfectly crispy. My impression is that the dishes are constantly changing.

I've dined at the old Montreal location, and I was in downtown and excited to try this location. I booked a reservation and was seated right away. Just be sure to request your table preferences in advanced. They have a really great menu full of different vegan and vegetarian options. The menu seems very well thought out and has hearty, satisfying foods and also lighter more refreshing foods. They also have some unique appetizers like kimchi fries. I decided on kimchi fries for the app, a jackfruit burger as my main, but also tried some other dishes that my table ordered like the power bowl and coconut curry. The fries came first and they were delicious. The kimchi was spicy and filling and the fries were perfectly crisp. The vegan aioli was amazing too. Definitely a must try at LOV. The jackfruit burger was delicious...kind of looked like a pulled pork burger. It was amazing - filling and tasty. You could really tell the execution was done right. The power bowl was really tasty as well - filling and healthy! The coconut curry I wasn't a huge fan of - but the flavours were nice. The service was also attentive and friendly. In all, a solid experience at LOV!"

Though none of us were vegetarians or vegans, we loved the look of the decor and thought we'd try something new. It was a nice open space, very clean and service was great. I loved that they had lots of dietary options such as types of milk and even vegan and non-vegan cheese. Great for people who are looking for alternatives. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy the kimchi poutine I had. The fries were cold but the flavours were good. A bit too much mayo. It could've been saved if the fries were hot and crispy but unfortunately it wasn't so they were soggy and kind of tasted like frozen McCain fries. I did however really enjoy the minestrone soup. If I wasn't already full, I could have eaten several more bowls! I also had the Matcha latte which was very good. The Matcha flavour shown through and wasn't too sweet at all. Great option for your vegan or vegetarian friends or just something different. I loved the feel of the restaurant and most food was good. Great for pictures too!"

I love myself clean white walls and decor.  The food is all organic and vegetarian. Presentation and taste are amazing! We had the beet tartare to start (a must try...melts in your mouth delicious); the lasagna (eggplant, cabbage, cashew milk cheese) - this was tasty, but I do think I miss real cheese and pasta; and my friend had the truffle and caviar zucchini noodles (tasty as well...tapioca caviar, but the noodles were a bit too wet for my taste).The best part about LOV is really the decor and ambience. There is a great buzz to the inside of the restaurant whether you are having a group dinner or a small rendez-vous. I would love to try out other items here again when I visit.p.s. if you use the ladies room, watch out for the potted plants. =D"

Our host was super sweet and welcomed us with a big smile and showed us to our seats right away. Our server attended us soon after. They have swings at the back if you would like to sit there and relax which was awesome. They also had a big patio for outdoor seating which was about three-fourth the size of the indoor space. We got the truffle zucchini, pesto gnocchi, poutine and coconut curry and each and every one of them were beyond delicious. You can add an egg for extra protein if you would like. They had a nice brunch menu for weekends, but we were there on a weekday so we missed out on that. They had kambucha mojitos!I highly recommend this place for breakfast and brunch to everyone!"

It was party of 1 for me and being outside with the beautiful greenery and lighting really made it special. I'm not vegan or vegetarian but the menu was so welcoming and interesting I had to try this place. I got the limonade with ginger to start. It came in a cute beaker glass with fresh lemon slices and a sprig of rosemary. For my entree I chose the sweet potato gnocchi with pesto. The fresh arugula and tart lemon sauce really made the dish come together nicely with the warm and soft gnocchi. It was a perfectly filling portion and I was so happy that my belly was full of goodness. I highly recommend this amazing restaurant!

Didn't know what else to take at first, but the nice waiter made us recommandations and we decided to try the truffle and caviar zucchini noodles with the avocado toast and a matcha lattee. We were disappointed with the kimchi fries. The kimchi was too sour and the combination with the fries was just odd. There was too much sauce on top and the bottom fries were drenched in the kimchi juice and became soggy and sour. However, the other dishes were very impressive. The zucchini fries was delicious and refreshing. Even though it was with truffle sauce, it didn't feel heavy after eating the whole thing. The avocado toast was also very good and light. The matcha latte we tried it with almond milk and coconut milk and they both had distinctive flavors and were perfect. As for the place itself, the place is beautiful with their marble tables and the greens. They also have a beautiful terrasse outside."

Last time we went to the one on McGill street for dinner and this time for brunch. For brunch we ordered the sugar shake, LOV Benedict, one chai latte, one hot chocolat and one regular coffee. In our chai latte and hot chocolat we had almond milk added under recommendations of our waitress. Though I love the restaurant for its decoration. The food is very disappointing yet expensive.The sugar shack was too salty and greasy and I literally was swallowing the food.The hot chocolat is horrible, it take like 95%dark chocolat and the drink was very diluted. Normally I feel bad to exchange the drink but for 5$ this drink is just unacceptable I had to request waitress to exchange to a chai latte same as my friend which turned out very delicious. I don't get the rave about this restaurant. For me this restaurant would give a nice instagram picture for its clean and refreshing decorations but if you want some decent vegan food better head to cooper branch. At least the latter has bigger portion that will fill your stomach."

Initially, when suggested this place I was a little hesitant to try it out. They have another location on McGill College that I didn't have a great experience. However, the LOV on de la Montagne is a completely different experience.First of all, let me just rave about the decor and ambiance. When you're walking in, they have a beautiful outdoor patio/terrace. During this winter season, they have it decorated with lovely Christmas lights and trees. It gets even better when you walk inside though. Their decor remains in the same theme as the other location, with a predominantly white/green color scheme. Such a gorgeously designed restaurant and they spared no detail when decorating.The only thing better than the decor was the food itself. My friend and I ordered the basil/arugula pesto gnocchi, stuffed portobello mushrooms, and the kimchi fries. I'd highly recommend the kimchi fries, it's excellent and perfectly seasoned! Their food is delightful and fresh. You can tell immediately that they're using high-quality fresh ingredients. Was thoroughly impressed with all the dishes and can't wait to come back and try out more. It's quite rare to find a vegan/vegetarian upscale dining experience that isn't completely overpriced. LOV manages to hit the ball out of the park and you will enjoy every single aspect of your dining experience.This restaurant experience is equivalent to receiving a beautifully wrapped gift only to find out it gets better and better as you start to unwrap it. Don't waste time debating a restaurant choice and get yourself to LOV asap."

We went for dinner and were seated at the bar (because all of the other tables were reserved). The menu featured a wide selection of food that all looked really good, and the aesthetics of the restaurant were absolutely gorgeous! The main issue here was the service. Our waitress was not friendly at ALL - when I asked for the flavour of the soup of the day, I received the reply of ""I don't know"". There was no attempt on her end to ask any of the other staff which I did not appreciate. The rest of the service we received from her for the rest of the night was also not great as she would often take our plates away without asking if we were done first. However, the rest of the wait staff all seemed lovely so perhaps she was just having a bad day. Apart from the service, the rest of the experience was mediocre - the food was good but not worth the high price. I might try the other location for brunch (and hopefully better service!) but would not come again for lunch or dinner."

The servers were very friendly and repeatedly checked on us and it was really nice how once he found out that one of my friends has nut allergy he double checked everything for her. It was very sweet :) The food was the best I really liked it!! We first ordered an appetizer which were the nachos and they were seriously AMAZINGGGG they tasted better than regular non vegan nachos in my opinion ahaha. If you go I seriously would recommend getting the nachos you can even order it separately for yourself because it's very filling and they give you a lot. And then we each got our separate dish so I got the lasagna which was ok in my opinion because they topped it off with vegan cheese which I really didn't like but once I removed it the actual lasagna was really good. My friends go the gnocchi and three different types of burgers and they each enjoyed theirs also.So yea I would seriously recommend this place not only is it really freaking cute but the staff are super nice and the food was really delicious :)

The bright whites and greens still remain central to the decor. The menu has expanded with a lot more options for our vegan and non-vegan friends. I am a non- veg, and I love eating here. I had a glass of red along with the bahn mi tofu burger- didn't really taste like anything like the viet-dish but I still enjoyed it. The burger came with a huge side of fries-that are easily good for two people. I loved having the tea here, it was really more for wanting to spend a tad bit longer to take in the lovely view.  Good for big groups, walk-ins with no reservations are fine for groups of 3-4 or less."
/user_details?userid=J5vEo3tpxCriMr0cTsN5pw,Tiffany J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",2 star rating,Nice menu for those who are vegan and vegetarian. But I'd strongly advise avoiding the french toast. Super bland and not a great mix of toppings. Felt like it was really missing flavor. Hashbrowns were super good but not filling. Atmosphere is nice.

Though at first the brunch didn't impress me, I thought the portion was kinda ridiculous, the dinner however did. I went to both locations and for a group, you are better off at De La Montagne because it's bigger. They are both as nice so it's really just about the size of your group. The service is always excellent with friendly and helful staffWe ordered quite a few things to share: Mac n Cheese, Grilled cheese, quinoa fritters, Curry, Salad, Noodles and the Mushroom delight (You can get gluten-free version of a lot of things) Everything was delicious. The ""ceviche"" though doesn't taste anything like a ceviche should, was delicious (they probably should rename it to avoid disappointment...)Go and see for yourself, it's worth it :)"

We found this place online and booked it, and it was one of our best decisions in this trip.The food was so unique, amazing textures and flavors! The cheese platter was the favorite dish, followed by the risotto, the gnocchi and the beet tartare. The service was superb, and our experience was amazing!"

/user_details?userid=aVxpgZk6ZwUBKzvCs2Ae4w,Jacqueline N.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Really delicious vegan food! I'd already been to the other location before for brunch (I recommend the lumberjack skillet!) and then realized I live a few blocks from this one! My brothers recently showed me an episode of 'Worth It' that featured the kimchi fries, so I knew I had to try them! They were unique! I love fermented things, so naturally I liked the taste! The fries are topped with a creamy sauce, kimchi, and kelp. The flavors and textures were pretty fantastic, although so new to me that it took a few bites to be able to tell whether I liked it or not. I also got the lasagna and caesar salad. I love caesar salad and this one, although simple and minus a crunchy crouton, was scrumptious. The dressing was subtle yet so creamy along with the ""cheese"" that melted in your mouth. The lasagna was warm and delicious with every bite and filled with so much veggie goodness! My friends highly recommend the gnocchi and get it every time! We also shared some poutine, which tasted kind of like a miso poutine. The ""cheese"" tasted very much like the tofu in miso soup, and melted in your mouth. I personally prefer my poutine fries more fried and soggy in that classic poutine way, but am always pleased to see vegan options on the menu! For dessert, we had some raw cakes and a cupcake. The cupcakes come from Sophie Sucrée, which has a special place in my heart, but it was somewhat hard to justify the price when you can just go to Sophie Sucrée and get 6 day olds for $5 instead of paying $5 for one that tastes like a day old. I wish it was a little bit fresher! Everything overall was great and as always, the environment is one of the most gorgeous spaces of the MTL culinary scene!"

The atmosphere/decor is beautiful, the service was exceptional and the food was unreal and priced fairly. The best part about LOV is the original options on the menu which are all mostly soy free (I had a hard time making up my mind as all the dishes listed were vegan items I had only dreamt about which are not available elsewhere in Montreal). We ended up going with the Kimchi Fries, the Hero 2.0 and the Truffle & Caviar. All three of which I strongly recommend, especially if you are into umami based dishes. I'll be returning ASAP (and then again and again)."

The venue itself is obviously Instagram worthy but also more spacious and comfortable than the first location. The menu being the same, I can attest that this is by far my favourite vegan fare in town! Great variety of vegetable and soy based dishes. The fried quinoa balls were stupendous. The Lov burger is my go to with its delicious toppings and moist veggie patty. The mac and cheese is always popular but i found it a little dry. Best part of the evening was definitely the dessert; their cheesecake is the bomb! Vegan or not, it's silky smooth and and delicious. For those like me that love wine, their list is quite impressive and includes a variety of whites, reds and even orange wine at fair prices. Definitely will visit again."
/user_details?userid=b9EOHQgkDuWP8WrM3cBzbw,Sarah L.,"Scarborough, Canada",5 star rating,"First place me and my sister went to as soon as we arrive in Montréal. We were promptly seated with the given option of either sitting outside on the patio or inside the restaurant, we didn't really care much to where we sat so the host sat us outside. We ordered a Big Lov Burger w/House Fries and a Banh Mi Burger w/Kimchi Fries. Big Lov Burger: Burger patty was made from shredded young jackfruit but somehow you couldn't taste the jackfruit at all, it legit looked like a meat burger taste and texture wise, it was delicious but super messy to eat lolBanh Mi Burger: Crispy tofu patty topped off with shredded beet coleslaw and spicy pickled carrots (holy crap so spicy lol). Pretty standard fare. Not much to say about it.House Fries: For me...very salty, was drowned in salt but the white sauce used for dipping was so yummy, it was creamy and tasted like mayo but it was for sure not real mayo.Kimchi Fries: Beautiful done, loved the addition of same. The Kimchi they have is made in house which is freaking awesome, I love how sour it is, it was perfect. Favourite for sure. This place is a definite go try if it's your first vegan food experience, there was a couple sitting across from us that were so stunned by how delicious the food was and the waitress was quite helpful explaining what their items were made from. Big recommend from me."

I went there during dinner time, around 8:30pm, on a Friday evening. Going in the restaurant, we were seated fairly quickly. The decor itself is very nice and welcoming. The service was also outstanding, and quick. The menu offered multiple choices of appetizers and also main dishes, and all are vegan/vegetarian choices. For the appetizer, we went for their vegan poutine, which to be honest was not great unfortunately. Or it may be as well the weird taste and consistency that threw me off, but definitely not a favorite at first bite. For the main course, I went for their risotto, which was good, but after a few bites. The mushroom that came with it complemented well the plate. Overall, a nice place with great decor, excellent service, and good vegan/vegetarian food."

/user_details?userid=933NaWG9W6Z-1pXMFPKOoQ,Mimi J.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"I came on a weekend for brunch, as one of my Montreal friends raved about this restaurant to me. I was immediately blown away by the attention to detail put into the decorations inside the restaurant! I was able to get a spot in the high ceiling section, which offered lots of natural light. There are swings in the back which you can relax in, and lots of tables. I tried: - The waffle: this was made with a vegan yogurt sauce, with chia gel and fresh fruits! It was quite a good portion size, and came with sufficient yogurt sauce (that was minimally sweet, but rather tart), and lots of fresh fruits. The chia gel definitely helped to fill me up! This wasn't too sweet overall, and felt very healthy. - The lumberjack: made with breakfast potatoes, lentils, fennel, dill, vegan smoked onion sausage, and caper aioli - this was a really good choice for a savoury dish; I was pleasantly surprised at how real the texture of the sausage was (given that I'm not a vegetarian), and it had a good smoky flavour. What really made this dish stand out was the copious amounts of savory sauce that had caper aioli; I kept wanting to dunk the potatoes into it! I even ended up dunking some of the waffle pieces into the sauce. Really satisfying!- Coffee - cappuccino:  this came quickly and was strong. Perfect way to give a burst of energy for the afternoon! Service was attentive but maybe a bit slow at the end. I relaxed by hanging out in the hanging chairs at the back of the store before heading out for more shopping! The restrooms are also unique and very clean/cozy. Although I was full, I could have been more full...but it was an interesting experience!"

The overall experience was all-good, but nothing particularly amazing or worth coming back for. The first myth I want to address is that this is a ""healthy"" restaurant. It really isn't. I mean other than ordering a salad, which you can get anywhere, most of the other options aren't healthy (when was the last time a burger was healthy!?). The second myth is that this is a vegan restaurant. As my friend and I found out, there were many items on the menu that were vegan, but others not. So if you are strictly vegan, make sure you order accordingly. I had a salad while my friend the burger. Both meals were good, but nothing special. I have to admit everything else though. was lovely. The space is beautiful and has a lovely terrace in the summer. The service is also quite good.  Another consideration is that there aren't that many good options for a nice meal on the area, Lov is really one of your better bets. A solid 3 star to me."

It was quite easy to make our reservation online with Open table.  The experience, in overall, was pleasantly smooth and relaxing.  It is unbelievable how busy they were on a weekday night, a Thursday evening. The service was exquisite and well organized in term of food order and table delivery.  The alcohol and mocktail we ordered were perfect and unique as they are serving, uncommonly seen in where we came from.  Thus, the experience is one of a kind to us as a traveller.   We look forward to return or one day, Lov would be a worldwide brand across the north America and the world.P.S. glad to try their special combo Lov burger or banh mi burger with fries also including a wine or beer or kombucha fut.

Soft drinks are available, from a local sparkling beverage company (1642). So many selections I would have liked to try on the menu! I settled for the soup special of mushroom and potatoes which was delicious. It had a beautiful consistency-not too thick and very flavorful. My entree choice, gnocchi di casa (buckwheat sweet potato gnocchi in a pesto sauce over a bed of arugula) while flavorful were on the dry side. The larger pieces (they were not of even sizes) in particular, were quite dry. My friend who ordered the same agreed. My husband, daughter and our friend each had the BBQ burger, one with a side salad, one with French fries and one with sweet potato fries.  All members of my party except for me are meat eaters and all enjoyed. The  service was good and our server refilled our water regularly. I would love to come back and try more selections!"
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I have to say my experience at LOV was better than the time I went to the McGill location. The decor is similar to the McGill location. I love it! It so zen and romantic...especially now with the Christmas lights outside the building. I arrived at 6:50pm and there was a 5 a 7 spécial which meant $5 cocktails! So worth it! I ordered two right away. I ordered one cocktail with gin and berries and another with Canadian Club and cucumber. The first was fruity and sweet. The second was light and refreshing. Both were good but you couldn't really taste the alcohol. I think a lot of ladies would like it. I feel like both would make for very nice summer drinks. I later ordered the miso cocktail with sake and pineapple miso but I didn't like that one at all. I switched to Blanche beer after that. So I only ordered the gnocchi. It was good but the plate was small. I should have ordered an entree as well. That's my bad. I thought eating pasta would be filling enough. There was half a lemon that I squeezed all over the pasta. The gnocchi was with pesto, Parmesan, basil and arugula. The size of each gnocchi was big for gnocchi but I just wish there had been more gnocchi on my plate. My friend gave me a kombucha battered onion ring and it was the best onion ring I ever had! They were humongous and so crunchy! With the aioli it was even more delicious! You don't taste the kombucha. I also tried a bite of my friend's vegetarian burger. It was just ok. Nothing special. I would not order it. The fries were solid though!! Considering we were a group of approx 15 people I have to say the service was good! The waitress kept asking if everything was ok which I really appreciated. When I went to the McGill location I remember the service was terrible and I was only with two other people! On a side note, I have to add that there were some inconsistencies with the menu. They had a special  with the burger or banh mi which came with either beer, wine OR kombucha as stated on the French menu but on the English menu it said beer, wine AND kombucha so it was a bit misleading. For sure it was meant to be OR because otherwise it would have been too good to be true but still my friend got excited at the thought of getting wine beer and kombucha when he read the English menu lol I am not vegetarian so this is not the type of resto I would pick for myself but if I had to go to a resto with a vegetarian friend I would def come back to this resto. So for me this place is def A-OK!"

I visited the Old Montreal location for dinner on a rainy night. It wasn't crowded when I arrived, and I didn't have a reservation, but it soon started to fill up. The first thing I noticed when I walked through the door is the restaurant's beautiful decor - it's light, airy, rustic, and botanical. Even the bathroom was decorated beautifully.My server was really nice and helpful, which I greatly appreciated since I only speak a little French. I ordered a lemonade while I looked over the menu. There were so many vegan options that it took me a while to decide what to order! After much deliberation, I started with the Kale Mac'n'Cheese. I don't always like vegan Mac'n'Cheese, but LOV's version was really yummy! The kale added a nice flavor to it. For my entree, I chose the Gnocchi Di Casa, which came coated in a hemp basil pesto and almond parmesan. It was my first ever experience with gnocchi, and it was truly delicious! The gnocchi were like little pillows packed with flavor. Even though I was just about full, I couldn't pass up dessert, so I ordered a vegan chocolate cupcake to end the meal on a sweet note.LOV is a nice restaurant that I would go to for a special occasion or on a date.

It's more of a pleasure to sit and stare around the interior design and architecture.I wasn't so impressed by the food. I can safely say to stay away from their version of ""Mac & Cheese"". It was dry and cold, playdoh-like and didn't even come close to the flavor palette. I couldn't even finish it.I did enjoy their version of crème brûlée. Very impressed that it could be 'veganized'. I have rarely been disappointed by vegan desserts.A bit expensive for my taste. You're mostly paying for the location and space.

We came here the night of a show at the bell centre for an early dinner, giving ourselves 2 hours for dinner before the show, which we thought would be plenty of time.  We had a very friendly greeting and were seated promptly.  Drinks and starters arrived quickly.  I had an ok cocktail, it was pleasant but not outstanding.   Had the quinoa balls as a starter which were delicious.  Things went downhill from there.  I had ordered the mushroom and onions as my main dish.  My friend ordered a pasta dish.  We waited half an hour... no food.  Asked our server, got a nice smile and a promise the food would be ready any minute.  20 more minutes go by.  Finally our meals arrive.  Mine is stone cold room temperature.  It's a small portion, overpriced for what it is.  If it was served warm, it probably would have been quite good, as the veg were nice and fresh.  But the sauce was cold and congealed at the bottom of the plate.  My friend's meal was apparently warm and delicious.  We skipped coffee and dessert as we were already late for our concert as a result.

After inquiring several times, finally our main courses arrived. I had the Big LOV Burger and my boyfriend had the Club sandwich. Both were great and for our extraordinarily long wait, we were comped two desserts. I'll admit, we grew quite upset after watching over 10-12 people being served their main entrees before we received ours and we arrived well before they did, however, our server was so nice, and even the manager explained to us that there was a mix up and they apologized profusely.  We then decided to continue with our meal.

She removed my beverage without asking before it was empty, was missing for ten minutes after I finished my meal when I was looking for the check after she had not been seen from before I had received my food til then. The icing on the cake was when I charged my credit card and as I was counting my cash for a tip, she proclaimed ""you know tip isn't included in this right?""

I ordered the club with fries & garlic aioli.  I am a VERY picky eater, so I took my first bite with trepidation, not sure of what sorcery the kitchen had concocted for the vegan ""bacon"" or ""chicken"".  My husband watched carefully, leery of me making ""the face"" that would signal the end of our dining experience. We were both amazed when my taste buds burst with joy as the flavors and textures combined in perfect harmony.  I devoured half the sandwich then reluctantly relinquished the other half in return for the other half of my husband's gnocchi (we had agreed to share).  The gnocchi had the most amazing pesto and with a slight squeeze of lemon to add a little zest, it was delightful.  Portion sizes were on point and the food was not too heavy, so we decided to try the two desserts on offer:  the chocolate brownie and the cheesecake.  While the brownie was a bit heavy and nutty for my taste, the cheesecake was light, fluffy and truly the best way to end the meal. I would go back JUST for another slice of that heavenly ambrosia.  My only disappointment was that the service was a little slow (it took about 30 minutes for our appetizers), but that could be attributed to it being the first week in operation.  The overall experience was amazing and we will definitively be back to sample some of the other delights on the all-vegan menu - like the burgers that we kept seeing go by.If all vegan food was this good, the world would have far fewer carnivores!"

I hate to say I am disappointed with the food. The burger looked sad and unappetizing. No effort was put in the plating, with nothing at all on the side and it tasted similar too. Patty was most generic bean patty.I also ordered hash browns and they came with mayonnaise and tasted alright. Nothing good nothing bad about them. Didn't like the mayo though. Again, good ambiance and other items might be worth the hype (my Airbnb host mentioned gnocchi is good here, after I shared my experience with her) but, I would not be going back."

/user_details?userid=XK5NeMRDrwqSa9XQIWyskA,Yacine M. D.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Ok here is the deal, Lov is a beautiful restaurant with gorgeous decor, a nice vibe, and ""good enough"" tasting food. I also loved the attention and care of the staff and additional points for a convenient downtown location! However, I must admit that they fall very short when it comes to food portions/quality compared to pricing. Maybe I have a bigger appetite than most, maybe I'm cheap and maybe I expect a lot from a brunch ( how can you not with all the different amazing brunch choices in Montreal and it's brunch, it's supposed to be filling and uber satisfying ), but It just didn't cut it for me.I ordered a Jasmine tea ( $3, usually tea or coffee is included or cheaper in other restaurants), then took the vegan omelet for  ( $10 ) which on top of being small only came with a salad, no other sides ( just salad leaves and cherry tomatoes, where are my potatoes, bread or fruits?? ) + a side of fruits ( $3 ).  Since neither I or my friend ( who took eggs benedict ) were full, we ordered the Apple pancakes ( $14 ) to share. These were supposed to come in 3, but they only served us 2 because supposedly the ones they usually serve were smaller in size ( baffling as the pancakes they served were actually small ). On top of this, there were no apples or applesauce included. Granted after I explained this to them, they made me another batch of 2 pancakes on the house.All in all, while the experience and food weren't the worst, the impression I have of Lov is that they target the type of crowd who cares more about appearance then actual substance. As someone who is vegan, I really find such places annoying because it confirms the stereotype that eating a plant-based diet is unaffordable and unsatisfying when it really isn't.Lastly, upon placing the reservation, there is a section to mention an occasion, I indicated that it was my birthday and there was no acknowledgment of this - In that case, what's the point of asking to specify an occasion?!All in all, I would not go back to Lov unless they reconsider their portions/quality to be more in alignment with their prices.For a great vegan brunch in Montreal, I would recommend Aux Vivres!"

Prior to visiting Montréal, I did my research, and made a list of some vegan restaurants I'd like to visit during my stay. LOV was one of them, and I was excited to try the food they offer. My boyfriend and I got to the restaurant shortly after they opened, so there were only 2 tables seated before us. We placed our order and proceeded to admire the decor - which was beautiful. During our wait, we saw more and more customers coming in and were being seated. Every table that were seated after us, got their food before us. Even the tables next to us were surprised that they got their food first, since they ordered much later. We arrived at LOV around 11:45am. Got our appetizer at around 12:10pm, and didn't get our mains until 12:56pm. We waited an hour for our food. I understand delays and usually don't fret over them, however, there were such a huge time gap between our appetizer and our mains! It was also upsetting to see groups (large and small) that came after us, finished or was finishing their food, while we were still waiting on ours. We got so frustrated at one point, we asked the server why our food wasn't here yet, but she assured me it would be there shortly... nope.We ordered the Buffalo Brussels Sprouts as an appetizer, the LOX Bagel, my boyfriend ordered a Big LOV Burger and LOV poutine. The Brussels sprouts were delicious, but wasn't tossed properly. The sprouts at the bottom of the dish were drenched in thick buffalo sauce, while the ones on top were light and crispy. I found a piece of hair on my LOX Bagel, but because I was so hungry at the time, I didn't care. I just ripped off the piece of bagel with hair on it. The poutine was good, however, the portions were quite small. Overall, if I were ever in Montréal again, I think I'll look for another vegan place for brunch."

I celebrated a special anniversary with my Honey in Montreal in June and we visited LOV three times in four days! We had dinner twice and just wine and dessert for a final visit. The food is fantastic.. I left feeling sated and energized but not at all overly stuffed or heavy. Each culinary piece had it's own balance of elements and favors and was aesthetically pleasing. The atmosphere is casual and romantic at the same time. It is a very pretty restaurant and we could sit there for hours. Plus all of the staff we encountered were friendly.

/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"I took a risk and invited my entire family for a birthday dinner at a vegan restaurant. My grandma arrived and said: ""I've never eaten vegan before, someone order for me!"" Thing is, she's recently lactose intolerant, and so are my Mom and sister, and my boyfriend is vegetarian, and I'm not eating meat for the last months either since every time I do it bums me out. Hard. My family is kind of steak and potatoes by default. They have a New Years resolution to eat vegetarian but they, like most of us, struggle to figure out how to get out of their patterns and do it. So Lov was a risk, but one I thought could pay off big, and it did, and I was so freaking delighted. It was a birthday miracle. Service made the night so I'll start there. When you take your entire weird glorious family to a chic hipster restaurant sometimes it goes well, and sometimes the waiters are dicks and make your poor Mom feel uncomfortable for taking like an hour to order. (Just kidding! Love you! Take your time!) At Lov we were in such good hands we didn't feel like we were downtown on de la Montagne at all (let's be real, there are some douchebag vibes in that area sometimes.) Instead, we were somewhere cozy and warm with just friends and family where it was fun and ok to laugh and try new things. Our waiter snuck my grandma a little extra splash of wine, and made my sister laugh, and so I love him forever. And when my man and I got there early and starving, we ordered from a guy with his hands full of dirty plates and he brought us beers and fries while we held a 6 person table and never felt rushed or annoying (even though we probably were.)And the food. This is vegan comfort food, delicate flavours but also hearty and cosy dishes. Collectively we had the kimchi fries (super yum) the coconut ceviche, which was inspiring and tasty and great. I wanna do all kinds of things to coconuts now. The wild urban mushrooms dish, which was crazy delish but could have come with a grain of some sort to soak up the delicious sauce and be a proper main. The vegan mac and cheese, which almost made my sister cry since she loves mac and cheese so much and can't eat cheese any more. We had the gnocchi at our table too which was tasty, those who ordered it seemed happy. And we shared all the desserts, the cheesecake was the winner but all were nice. In general my thought on the food would be to order a bunch of the small plates next time, the mains didn't stand up all the way to the creativity and flavours of the smaller plates for me.The room and patio are huge and beautiful as others have mentioned. The food was tasty and cosy and you feel happy and healthy after and the prices are totally reasonable and fair. But as I know well from reading one zillion Yelp reviews in my job, what makes all the difference in the world when you bring people you love somewhere for a special occasion is the service, and these guys nailed it and I'm super thankful. All the stars! Birthday miracle!"

Place is noticeably much larger than McGill. Service was on point. Went for brunch and asked to be seated inside so I could have the chance to get a good look at the place. Had a mimosa and the fruit bowl with vegan yogurt. Never cease to impress me with their food. Mind you, I'm not a vegan, but this would be my favorite vegan spot."
/user_details?userid=IlvHu0uu8OuHeB8tsKfg3g,Avita T.,"Chicago, IL",2 star rating,"This place was interesting. It truly is a very vegan and healthy experience, but maybe not in the best sense.I came with a couple of friends for brunch. As we sat, our waitress first came by to ask us for drinks, and a friend of mine asked for coffee. Our waitress obnoxiously responded saying, ""what type? there are so many types - espresso, americano, latte....etc."" Fine, we get it. You know so much about coffee. Then, she asked what type of milk, ""Cow's Milk? Oat milk? Almond milk?"" and when my friend said regular milk, our waitress responded, ""So cow's milk?"" The whole thing was so bizarre.My friend after her asked for a soy latte to which our waitress obnoxiously once again responded saying, ""We don't serve soy milk. There's too much oestrogen in it."" We understand this place is attempting to advocate for healthy foods but there is no need to be pretentious about it. We also felt this in the fact they charge an extra $+2 for any dish that we want to use animal cheese rather than vegan cheese. Usually, it is the other way around but we just thought it was plain weird they did this.In terms of drinks, I got a hot chocolate which was not sweet enough which would have been fine but it was not chocolately enough either. Ok -- hopefully the food would be better. I ordered an apple pancakes and sweet potato gnocchi to share with my sister. The apple pancakes sounds divine on the menu with the chai cream and fresh fruit but to be honest, it was just weird. I have had many buckwheat pancakes before but this one had an extremely odd texture, probably from the misuse of buckwheat. It felt like they did it to make it feel healthy, which I'm sure it was but it definitely did not taste as good as it looks. The sweet potato and buckwheat gnocchi was possibly the best dish, but I could not taste any sweet potato at all. The pesto and parmesan tasted nice and fresh but the gnocchi itself was dense and did not have that light, fluffy and sweet taste I was looking for. The pesto saved it, thankfully.Ultimately, this place just felt overly pretentious to the point that they were willing to compromise on the taste of their food to preserve its healthiness. This is NOT necessary for vegan food. I don't think I will come back."
/user_details?userid=yEuBYXzQ5i0ixctfXfjtMg,Toni S.,"Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Canada",4 star rating,"Restaurant LOV is the perfect haven for vegetarian foodies. The name is actually an acronym meaning Local, Organic and Vegetarian and not Love of Vegetarian, but this could be also said of this beautifully decorated and hip restaurant that appeared on the Montreal food scene late in December 2016.Started and owned by Dominic Bujold of Pizzeria 900 & Crudessence, it has the winning formula as most of his concepts in terms of décor, food and popularity.  There are at least a dozen good vegan restaurants in Montreal, but none do it prettier than LOV.Set on rue McGill in Old Montreal the restaurant is impressive when walking past it in the evening. Lit up with tons of lighting and painted in hues of white and light green, it exudes a crisp clean feel of simplicity, with hints of nature here and there. Yet Restaurant LOV is not only for the healthy conscious, it has a happening bar scene with long communal bar tables and seating and a great wine and cocktail list. The menu created by Stephanie Audet formerly of Crudessence is innovative, original and absolutely delicious. There is lots of interesting choices to be had even for the non-vegans. I have to admit this foodie is somewhat of a carnivore. I like a good portion of meat with all my meals and do not feel satisfied just on a bowl of veggies. But there are times at lunch and breakfast in which I prefer salads or just fruit. Vegetables are less heavy and somewhat cleansing and have much more beneficial health properties than meat these days which are filled with hormones and antibiotics.I began eating more vegetarian meals after eating at Crudessence and seeing that vegetables do not need to be bland.  They can be used like any cut of meat; some creativity is required but today there are many combinations for meat replacements. Lately, I started visiting the Copper Branch Fast food outlets and sampled tempeh for the first time. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted and started to think of ways where I can incorporate this, many more items in my menu. Monday evenings have now become Vegetarian night. We take a break from eating meat and we cook stir fry vegetables, casseroles or stuffed veggies. I am starting to experiment with different ideas and eating at LOV and Crudessence has been inspirational.The evening I visited LOV, I was running late and was rushing to get there on time.  I little stressed and nervous I managed to find a parking lot a few doors away but had to pay $ 15.00. for parking, I knew it was going to be an expensive evening.  As I rushed down the street and rushed up the stairs I could not help being awed by the lighting, the brightness and the decor. My friends were already there waiting and had scored the table next to the window in the alcove. The perfect spot to people watch. As I settled in, I looked around and really liked the feel of the place. I started to feel less stressed as I perused the menu. The restaurant was already buzzing with a youthful vibrant crowd seated at the bar tables. My girlfriends had already gotten their wine and it took about 35 minutes for the waitress to come back around to take our order.  I ordered 4 oz of Vale del Maule 2015-Naranjo a natural orange wine for $ 15.00. A full glass of 8 oz will put you back $ 24.00, our waitress Justine was nice enough to advise me before I placed my final order. This made up for the slow service we received. The wine was delicious and perfect with my starter of endive and citrus salad.  For starters we ordered the stuffed portabella mushroom, quinoa fritters, endive salad and LOV Poutine.The endive salad & Citrus salad at $ 14.00 was refreshing and a perfect mix of bitter and sweet. Topped with walnuts and Goji berries, it was a good start. The Quinoa Fritters - $ 10.00 were just as delicious. We received 4 quinoa fritter balls made with jackfruit, Konjac and Corn topped with a turmeric aioli and pineapple salsa. Different in texture and flavor, the fritters were innovative and original. The fritters came packed with tons of health benefits. I had never heard of Jackfruit, with some research I discovered it is a tropical fruit that resembles Durian. It has lots of health benefits and it is sweet in consistency but must be cooked. Konjac is a flour which does not contain starch or sugar and is used more as a thickening agent, perfect for those with gluten intolerances. The Stuffed Portabella mushroom-$ 12.00 was stuffed with a walnut and prune Duxelle, it came with a drizzle of apple vinaigrette and topped with organic vegan cheese. The presentation left much to be desired but the texture and flavors were wonderful and tasty.The last appetizer was the Poutine LOV-$10.00, their signature dish made with sweet potatoes and miso gravy. Topped with kale chips and organic vegan cheese curds. I liked this dish, although my friend found the Miso gravy too salty. Everyone loved the mix of salty and sweet potatoes and the crispy kale gave it some text"

We got a couple of sandwiches and salads. It was good, original and pretty to the eyes but I have to say... for the price, I was a bit disappointed. Nearly 50$ and we were still hungry.I know it's a lunch menu but some people (i.e., me) like to do things backwards and eat a big warm plate of food at noon and lighter for supper so it would be nice to have more filling items for lunch too.

The kale Mac n cheese looked way better in the picture than in life. The kale was saggy and wet when I had imagined it savoury and crisp. Don't get me wrong, I ate everything on my plate anyway but the flavours were not nearly developed enough for the price tag. The decor is lovely and staff very pleasant but for that price I unfortunately will not go back. I had two cheap glasses of red wine a started and a main for 60$ before tax and tip, my friend with same meals but pricier white wine paid 80$ before tax and tip."

It is a warm feeling when you step inside the main doors. This weekend was my first time I tried Lov for brunch and I was excited to see what's on the menu. It was a beautiful sunny day and my friend and I asked to sit out on the terasse. The servers were nice about it when we asked to move to another table in order to get the most sun. There are a few tables outside on the terasse which can fit 2 or 4 people if they are put together. The tables are too close beside one another and the next table can hear your entire conversation. So if are loud talkers, perhaps you should ask for a more table in the corner. There are also 2 picnic tables which can hold 4-6 people comfortably if evenly spaced out. We were bit squished when a trio arrived and sat in the middle. They were practically sitting on our laps, which was not the most comfortable. I opted for the waffle with vegan yogurt and chai seed coulis and an order of the vegan smoked onion sausage. Finished both easily. There was nothing unique about the waffle, it was fine. Although, the sausages were flavorful and the texture was soft. They stop serving brunch at 3 p.m. and start turning away customers as they are turning over and getting ready for the evening service.  I'm glad I tried it, although I prefer Lov for dinner."

I dined here twice and found some of the items delicious and some of them just ok. The kale mac and cheese was ok, the noodles were a little bit too overcooked, but it came out quickly when I was looking for a fast lunch.I got the onions as a starter for dinner because I saw someone else had ordered them. I think I was in love with the first one I had, but they were so heavy and greasy that it turned out to be a bad idea and I definitely wouldn't eat more than 1 again. I got the gnocchi for my main as gnocchi is one of my favourite pastas. The gnocchi were good but the sauce was a little bit lacklustre. I guess I prefer tomato sauce compared to vegan pestos.I would return to try some more of the menu and hope I would pick better choices next time."
/user_details?userid=T8ImanqlT3KYn9G4oCYwrQ,Michelle P.,"Hudson County, NJ",4 star rating,"For my first entirely vegan restaurant, I would say not bad at all. My personal favorite was the quinoa fritters, crispy on the outside and the quinoa was perfectly cooked and was fluffy on the inside. The table favorite was the nachos. I didn't feel like I was lacking with any of the flavors and the vegan cheese used was inscrutable from the real thing. Mac'n'cheese was not a table favorite but the kale added an interesting flavor profile for me. My main course was the coconut curry. I felt that it wasn't creamy and the gravy wasn't not harmonious with the other ingredients in the dish. It was also a tad salty. I would've done a few more apps instead of the main in my opinion. I did not get drinks, but the people at the table were not entirely pleased with the cocktails. Of course the entire place is beautiful, the greenery and white play off each other to make this restaurant feel like a unique dining experience."

Otherwise they both delivered the perfect experience (one star lost for the uninspired dessert though, sorry, we are demanding).- The decor is what strikes you first of course. It's light, playful, refreshing; elaborate and curated but not taking itself seriously, like the food.- The food is on point. It's not a vegan restaurant that hides its preference, or a baba cool hippie from the 60's with only grain dishes. Each dish has it's own flavor and texture; inventive, satisfying, good proportions and careful presentation. May be the dessert was the disappointment (hence the lost star) as it was not up to par with the rest of the meal. Don't tell your carnivore friends it's vegan, and they will still be satisfied.- The service was nice and easy. They may be trendy and full, but they still have a smile each time they interact, and they take their time with you. You don't feel rushed and the service is friendly without being unprofessional.A very rounded experience - the price is right, for a well delivered and executed experience. It's an experience that makes you smile and be happy, like the decor."

Also, I ordered the Hero 2.0 which had something very sour in it and was too salty. Overall it didn't taste that good for being almost $20!! Also the portions were quite small for what I spent here.

But alas... we ordered the ""lasagna"". It was a small straight-out-of-the-can tasting tomato mush topped with a decent vegan cheese. Not at all lasagna like, no discernible layers or separate flavours.  The risotto was equally bland and disappointing. Got a vanilla cupcake on the way out in hopes of redeeming the meal some what but it was realllyyy bad. Tasted like expired unsweetened soy milk and I ended up angrily throwing 2/3 of it on the road outside. Aaaanyway I will give this place another chance as I think we may have ordered the ""wrong thing"" but really there should be no ""wrong thing"".  All in all quite disappointing.

/user_details?userid=LHlKkrkppF-HIV3MOqAKcQ,Margaret M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"TL;DR: Inconsistent service and quality depending on how busy the restaurant is. For the love of God, do not order the ""chicken"" pot pie. I've been to Lov a number of times and my experiences have varied widely. Ultimately though, the positives have not been able to outweigh the negatives.The positives: When I came here for Montreal à Table I had an amazing experience. The meal consisted of roasted brussels sprouts, lasagna, caesar salad, and crème brulée for $23. Everything was delicious and I left with the impression that Lov is capable of great food and excellent service. The décor is also nice and the restaurant is comfortable.The negatives: Unfortunately, the quality of the food and service varies a lot depending on how busy the restaurant is. We once waited 45 minutes after ordering before finding out that they were out of what we had ordered and the server had forgotten to come back. They did give us drinks to compensate, but I've noticed that it is not uncommon for them to be out of things on the menu. The main reason this is a 2 star rating is that the menu is incredibly hit or miss. Considering Lov presents itself as a relatively upscale restaurant, everything on the menu should at least be good. However, my friend had the misfortune of ordering the ""chicken"" pot pie and we were both shocked by how terrible it was. The filling was not cooked in any kind of sauce - it was completely dry and served with ketchup (why?) on the side. The ""chicken"" was jackfruit, which I normally love, but it was flavourless and unseasoned. It seemed to have been taken directly out of the can and thrown in. Finally, the only spice that we could taste was cloves. Cloves! The entire thing reeked of them even from across the table. It was one of the most baffling dishes I have ever tried at a restaurant; we honestly thought they had made a mistake with the recipe that night. I just read another Yelp review that has the same complaint though, so I guess that's just how they make it? All to say, Lov does make some delicious dishes, but no self-respecting restaurant should have anything on their menu that is that bad."

I'm always so excited to see vegan places that step it up a bit and offer a fancier location for more sophisticated outings. It reminded me a little of the restaurant Planta in Toronto. The decor inside was very nice and botanical. We asked to sit outside, but the patio was closed since there was a chance of rain so we were seated near the window instead. We ordered the gnocchi, the mac and cheese, and the quinoa fritters. I loved the gnocchi and pesto -- it was a fresh spin on a dish that usually isn't plant-based. The quinoa fritters were also tasty, and it's always fun to see restaurants get creative with how they use ingredients. In my opinion, the kale mac and cheese was fairly standard. Tasty, but it doesn't live up to the comfort food feeling I want out of a mac and cheese (even if it is vegan). We thought it was pretty funny that the waiter offered my mom and I separate bills, but overall the service was also great and efficient. Would definitely go back here on future trips to Montreal!!"

I guess people go there mostly for the vegan food. I have found myself wondering many times - with so many classy, chic restaurants in Montreal how come we don't have a classy, chic vegan restaurant - where people could enjoy both the food and the ambience. Restaurant LOV does just that - it has a nice selection of food and wine, great decor and gives the feeling that you are eating at a proper restaurant and not a food court.To be honest I haven't tried any of their main dishes - so can't really comment on the general quality of the food.

Salads are fresh, using locally sourced ingredients. There are numerous options for other items, including starters, sides and  sandwiches, though we opted both nights for a main course. In particular, we loved their Urban mushrooms, which used oyster mushrooms accompanied by zucchini, pearly onions, fresh peas and a delicious sauce. They wisely provide a soup spoon as no way you will leave a drop of the sauce behind. We had their brownie (gluten free) for desert and it was quite tasty but also light.

In regards to the food, the veggie burger was satisfying and tasty. I enjoyed the vegan poutine, though the vegan cheese we ordered with it (instead of cheese curds) didn't melt, but organic cheese is an option if this is something that concerns you.

We ordered the mac n cheese, the poutine and the club lov to share. Every single dish was delicious way beyond my expectations of vegan food. Little attentions like various staff members refilling our glasses with water every time they had a chance to the manager coming by our table once we received our food to wish us a great meal - every little detail was on point. I think the biggest winners for me were the taste of the food which was splendid and the friendly attitude of the staff. I can't stress enough how way too many restaurants in montreal make you feel unwelcomed and snob you unless you fit into their idea of a high-end customer.We felt welcomed and at ease and it was overall such a good experience I can't wait to come back with more people.

I'm talking clean lines, white on green on pale green. It is a floral masterpiece. There is ample seating, you would never guess from the way it is tucked into a quiet part of bustling downtown Montreal that it would be so SPACIOUS! This is a great place for groups. The food was delicious as well! I'm always in the mood for a delicious vegetarian meal, and this menu has been curated well. I met my buddy from Austin for a light dinner on a Tuesday evening. I started with a Mango/ turmeric lasso- which I'll admit was my least favorite part- WAY too much turmeric and not enough mango flavor. We had the quinoa fritters to start which were absolutely delicious! I need to learn how to make these. I had the LOV Burger with onion rings and loved every bit of it. My partner and buddy ordered two very good dishes, one was a zucchini squash dish that I don't see on the menu and I can't remember the other one. The food is what knocks this rating down a star.

First of all, our waiter looked like he is having the worst time ever doing his job. We asked him what he would recommend and he said a salad. We asked him if he could offer anything else since we didn't wanna come to a vegan restaurant for a salad and he just stared at us and said the salad is good and said I'll give u more time and left. Now the food. The avocado toast was okay, nothing special but to get an extra egg it was 2 dollars?!? And the portion was really small so it was kind of disappointing. The kale Mac and cheese was so dry but it tasted alright. The best dish was the Indian curry but the pancakes were also dry and again was nothing special. The burger came with nothing else other than a maybe a pickle, it tasted as depressing as it looked, had no flavour at all. The gnocchi was horrible, it was dry and just tasteless.

The bar was very crowded, to the point of being uncomfortable. The restaurant atmosphere and aesthetic were very nice, it reminded me a bit of Planta in Toronto for a variety of reasons. The food is a little pricey for what it is, but given the restaurant aesthetic it is acceptable. What really hindered our experience was the service. Our waitress/the bartender was not helpful, and a bit rude. When asking what the soup of the day is she responded that she didn't know. When further pressing asking if it was perhaps salty or sour, she responded that she still did not know. When asking about a salad recommendation, she told us that she had no preference. I ended up getting the Mexican salad, and my friend got a small house salad and the mystery soup of the day (we are still unsure of what was in it!) My salad was very tasty and actually quite filling, but with tip came out to nearly $20 which is excessive for a salad IMO. My friend also enjoyed her meal, but the slice of bread she was given with her soup was a tad stale. Overall the food is decently good and the restaurant aesthetic is lovely, but the service and high prices make me not want to return."

Thankfully I made it back to my hotel to throw up. Don't know if it was the burnt broccoli, dried out noodles, or what. I was so hungry I ate it anyway as the unique blend of spices did make it tasty. On a positive note, service was excellent and ambience relaxing. However, I will never go there again because it ruined my evening."

So good I ordered gluten free mac n cheese to go. Service at the bar was attentive. And they feature smoothies, wine & cocktails. I'll be back!"
