/user_details?userid=7P_niUmr1Vzatr3vOeEc1w,Sonya G.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,Pricey for what you get. No A/C. A few items on the menu were not available. Service was quite good but the coffee was absolutely horrible. Not drinkable. The resto was quaint but really not worth going. Save your money.
