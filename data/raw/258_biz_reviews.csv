/user_details?userid=lyCFE0yaq-lOyKlgI-5GwQ,Matt K.,"Scotch Plains, NJ",5 star rating,"I was in Montreal for a short trip, and for a quick local breakfast, this place hit the spot! Quiet, atmosphere with Wi-Fi and a small library of books you can read. I had one of their delicious Sumerian sandwiches recommended by the owner herself. Their coffee is also excellent if you're looking for a pick-me-up.The most surprising thing about this place was that it's relatively new. That said, it's a great find tucked away in the neighborhood."

/user_details?userid=yfIYXJVRjjBA0l0dkAMb2A,Andrea N.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,I got two sandwiches for take away and we couldn't even bring ourselves to eat them. They were a soggy mess by the time I got home (which is a 5 min walk). The ingredients are most certainly not fresh. A huge waste of $22
/user_details?userid=8Dkl4802CAxxmlj8vaFWRA,Haley Z.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Wanted to find a place to relax and catch up with some friends and Oh My Deer was it!  (Owner informed me that Cafe M changed the name to Oh My Deer.)  Two great things about it was fresh baked goods and non caffeinated choices!  The amazing Columbian owner just put out some fresh bread pudding in the afternoon, which I couldn't say no to. Have to say the bread pudding was perfect on the sweetness scale especially when I prefer lower sweetness than most Americans.  The owner even informed me that a simple syrup could be drizzled on top for a little more sweetness, which I couldn't say no.  Yum!  Crunchy on the outside and chewiness for the center.  Order it!For the drink side I ordered something called Aromatica, which was amazing for a cold day.  It was a hot berry infused drink that gives you memories of summertime on a cold day.  Just a hint of fruit infusion with sweet berries right after you finish drinking.  Next time I am in the area this is a place to come and relax with a book."
/user_details?userid=5apWVR7R45quFUWbN0r7kg,Fredi O.,"Cherry Hill, NJ",5 star rating,Sweet little breakfast lunch place. Just a few tables and a small garden. Coffee delish and a perfect omelette with her secret ingredient that made it special! Corn! The prop. Is Colombian and says corn is a staple there. Really enjoyed this little treasure.
/user_details?userid=5f8JgpON757iJmO9D5VYPw,Andie G.,"Wilmington, CA",2 star rating,"Food was decent but we ordered two sandwiches and two coffees and it took 40 minutes to get our food AND 45 minutes to get our coffee. It was not busy. There was one couple ahead of us that had also order sandwiches. Only come if you can wait that long for practically a snack. I got a sandwich with lettuce, the lettuce was wilting and barely had any dressing. It would've made the wait not feel so awful if we could've at least gotten our coffees first."
/user_details?userid=uko4LnUv_hD8nD1uBiDB9w,Catherine P.,"Camarillo, CA",5 star rating,"I loved it here. The coffee and omelette were delicious. I felt as though I was  enjoying a cosy breakfast in a friend's house. The decor, the food at the hospitality was excellent. I highly recommend a visit to Oh My Deer!"

/user_details?userid=z_cDkvZbyKEYoMHgAjoCmg,Daniel P.,"Greenwich, CT",5 star rating,Excellent little cafe. Went here when I was in Montreal for F1 and came twice in a day. The service was lovely and I will be back next time I'm in town
/user_details?userid=-yFt7W1ZpbFnnle3T8cQrw,Emily K.,"Somerville, MA",5 star rating,"This place is adorable!  I love the atmosphere, the service is great, and the drinks are delicious !"
/user_details?userid=o6rHcSB3Z3F5PSy8YvzFqA,Sally X.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The coziest little cafe tucked away on Duluth, featuring great food and excellent WiFi. The couple who owns the place is super friendly. It's a bit small but there's plenty of seating, and the jazzy music is upbeat but not loud. Great low-key spot to grab lunch and get some work done."
/user_details?userid=t1ncm4HMJ9VZTSBcL85KQQ,Brad M.,"Oakland, CA",5 star rating,"Very nice ambiance, friendly staff, and good coffee. The menu is a bit small, but if you're looking for a good coffee stop with a relaxed atmosphere, look no further!"
/user_details?userid=OyWhTonjjiaIzjSeNPeGcA,Koji S.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Like, if you have a small space and want to convert it to a café, *this is what you should do*. Cozy colour scheme, many seating options (counter, small and large tables), small bookshelf. The actual food was fine - matcha latte a bit pale, croissant that was much closer to a brioche (but would have been an excellent brioche). Bugs were pretty annoying (but it was the summer)."
/user_details?userid=ppUS3G3bVNNqvjAKsi1BbA,Jinny L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Had to give this place a 5 star. Not only is the service seriously 10/10 but the food and drinks are bombbbb for a cafe, and the atmosphere is super cozy! ALSO, I have a serious pet peeve with studying in dirty environments, and even though this cafe is always bustling with customers, the place is always clean and the counters are never greasy! Most of all though, you know the cafe's good when the owner seems to really care about the customers. He's not that good at english but he's one of the most enthusiastic and genial cafe owners i've met! After staying nearly 30 mins after closing time, I finally realized that no one was around and that he was calmly waiting at the register just cleaning the same old corner for the past 30 minutes waiting I guess...for me to leave. He didn't even mention it, and was so sweet when I apologized for my finals week obliviousness. PS: please take the green matcha cakes they're so good!!Ugh love this place"
/user_details?userid=Jbvk_EtNS303eBobAPl6tg,Stefan W.,"Calgary, Canada",4 star rating,"Great little spot with healthy menu options and good coffee. The bagel burger is a spectacular creation featuring a variety of sautéed vegetables (zucchini, squash), kale, and your choice of bacon or ham. Excellent value here. Not particularly English friendly, so it is good to know what you want ahead of time and be clear with the staff. Otherwise, I'd recommend Code Black up Saint Laurent."
/user_details?userid=tmqAnKBcKcVrAi2RxAD91A,Natasha F.,"Menlo Park, CA",5 star rating,"I first came to this place after seeing a picture my friend posted on Instagram of what looked like epic coffee. The day my boyfriend and I planned to go, he came back from his run in the morning saying he had stopped by with a friend and was blown away. This made me even more excited to check it out.We went around 3pm on a Saturday and the place was pretty full. Despite this, we were immediately greeted by the owner, and he personally took our orders. We just showed him the picture, apparently it was the chemesc option. He also made sure to ask if I wanted my milk warmed up or not. I was blown away by both the quality and presentation of the coffee. There was enough coffee in our big chemesc to have about 3 teacups each- a really great value. I also had a green tea muffin and my boyfriend had a hot chocolate which we enjoyed.I returned on Monday afternoon in order to do some work. The place was pretty quiet, a few other students working. I ordered the matcha latte. To be honest, I didn't like it that much. Since I was there so long, I decided to order a chai latte which was delicious and made up for the mediocre matcha latte. The owner was so sweet and kept asking me how my work was going, what sort of student I was, and he even brought me a free orange cranberry muffin. I will definitely be returning here often to do work, or to just have a delicious treat. The service, quality, and atmosphere cannot be matched!"

/user_details?userid=OHTXFa3YQY0cB0nzHgjhRw,Yi T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"As soon as I walked in, I fell in love with this place. The decor is impeccable, the wi-fi is top-notch, nice music selection (jazz, soul and old school pop) and the owner is a sweetheart! Coffee is good and strong, and their baked goods selection is bound to make your mouth water. And they have an adorable little terrasse out back. This is probably one of my favorite coffee shops in Montreal now. (About getting served in English: the barista there was anglophone as far as I could tell. You shouldn't have a problem!)"
/user_details?userid=8o5YaBnbnTJfjc7wpsiGUw,Kristie N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I absolutely love this cafe! The barista and owner of the cafe is the nicest man I have ever met. He is super friendly and is willing to help me improve my French. Their baked goods are really good, especially their matcha baked goods. I tried their matcha muffin with white chocolate chips. Their cappuccino is also very good! The cafe is great to meet up with a friend and to study. It isn't that spacious so it would not be recommended to study with a group here. This is an absolute must try!!"
/user_details?userid=f_6ZjA4KhYXYDmbIzEVzyw,Shaunesy D.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This is an adorable coffee shop, with even nicer staff! We came to Montreal from Toronto and were in desperate need of coffee to start off our day. Pleasantly surprised to find that there was a little local coffee shop down the street from our Airbnb. The shop itself is a nicely sized coffee shop, maybe on the smaller side. It has books to enjoy while you drink your coffee (unsure if it is free or not). They also sold little jams, coffee beans and other charcuterie supples. The coffee was delicious!! We both had a double shot latte and adored every last sip. Would recommend to anyone in the area."
/user_details?userid=jf-dJu8YgjozH8jdOPENMQ,Jacqueline M.,"Cleveland, OH",5 star rating,Totally charming. Great service--spectacular actually. The classic tartiflette was delicious. Randomly found it off a side street. I will intentionally return my next trip.
/user_details?userid=aNfG4yqETNKXNQgc2qTToA,Doris Z.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",2 star rating,The Barista girl was super nice but she doesn't know how to make coffee. All the coffee we ordered were bitter and the muffin was as hard as a rock.
/user_details?userid=IuwryTK_t9zblPlcqhDS1g,Dee G.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Fantastic service! Kenyan roast for the cortado was delicious. The music was amazingly relaxing. I wish I had brought my book. Free Wi-Fi. And again the service is amazing, so kind and attentive."

/user_details?userid=ZiQnNl4MAZJm6PSvc3NwvA,Jennifer M.,"Keller, TX",5 star rating,"This is such a great place!   The Salmon sandwich is so good!  The staff is awesome also.  They were super patient with our questions (we were there with my elderly mom and my 9 year old so double whammy) and made a few tweaks to our order for us.  They were very nice, great coffee and great food - what more can you ask for?"
/user_details?userid=6Ew38SOYeKrbD13mpgOb_A,Briana L.,"Columbus, OH",5 star rating,"Found this cute cafe while visiting Montréal and loved it! The baristas were so nice, my bacon and egg croissant was made fresh and delicious, and I really enjoyed my latte. The soft jazz playing in the cafe added to the perfect vibe."
/user_details?userid=MuuyKX394rrnMbYcDvj7PQ,Alice R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Check out Café M on avenue Des Pins and St Dominique! Amazing coffee, nice atmosphere,quiet enough to work and very good home-made food! They have tartiflettes,galettes bretonnes and other specialties that you don't necessarily find everywhere with such a friendly staff! My new favourite place !"
/user_details?userid=agtq93Xl8LTLXq8kqZysgw,Mackenzie S.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"I was recently in Montreal for the first time staying Airbnb style like a 2min walk from Cafe M. All I can say is the food an atmosphere was the best. The guy behind the counter was the SWEETEST and the food is made from scratch, not premade like the crap most cafes in the States do. My boyfriend got the Breakfast Burger and I got a potato and cream dish that was to die for. If your in the Boul St-Laurent area look down the side streets and you will find little gems like these!"
/user_details?userid=ifBAyw26vmE7ciPOb1xwZQ,Natasha A.,"Kamloops, Canada",5 star rating,Cute little cafe with delicious pastries made in house! Chai also made in house and very tasty! Excellent service.
/user_details?userid=FRYoDBJUIKidCYKAVK8G2w,Hope C.,"Bellflower, CA",2 star rating,We stopped by yesterday finally after months of walking past it. The place was nice and cozy yet full for a holiday. The owner was so adorable and nice we ordered two lattes one was almond. While we had no expectations the lattes were too hot that it probable burnt the crema and they both tasted like watered down coffee. It was too bad because we were excited to taste verve a roaster out of Cali.
/user_details?userid=h1Vsz24g7TLA9ZfIDiFjbw,Sarah W.,"Calgary, Canada",4 star rating,"Cute, hipster cafe with organic food options and yummy drinks.   I had an iced chai which was delicious and not sweetened.   Their scones are very fresh, with great ingredients - I had a cranberry, walnut."
/user_details?userid=HJFm-Ex-xt8-d7pBGnwIpA,M G.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Canada",4 star rating,I found Cafe M to have a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere. Perfect for students studying or to meet up with a friend. The presentation of the drinks was also very nice served on a small wooden platter. Staff very friendly. Definitely recommend as a place to check out :)
/user_details?userid=ehUiGocUY4BneutjcZAWUQ,Rebecca K.,"Shaughnessy Village, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is great--super conveniently located off st lau, fantastic coffee and really amazing staff. The place is pretty big even though it looks tiny from the outside. There are candles and plants and the ambience is really nice. Seating is comfortable, hardwood floors and a pretty sophisticated looking espresso machine and kitchen. Quiet save for the barista making friendly conversation with a customer"
/user_details?userid=2aWnt5QkGigX-MiYi0SNTA,Peter C.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Overall, this place needs a lot of work to survive in the Montreal cafe scene.  A few good points, the barista was nice and the service was good.  Note though, I've read that people who work here don't speak English, and I found that to be true.  I switched over to French and it was fine, but for those who can't communicate in French, ordering and such may be a bit difficult.  Another good point is that the place is quite clean for those who care about this kind of stuff.  Onto the negatives, first, the coffee is in desperate need of improvement.  The cappuccino was bland and watered-down.  This place screams of ""we offer coffee but we don't appreciate coffee at all.""  Second, the muffin I had was dry like cardboard and also devoid of taste, closing in to the point of not being edible.  Third, the atmosphere was a bit strange, the music was like stuff you'd hear in a dentist office, and the space itself is a bit tight in a way I'm not sure I would qualify as cozy, but more that it's just a somewhat crammed space with furniture oddly laid out.  So style-wise, it doesn't really fit the vibrancy and warmth you can find at other Montreal cafes."
/user_details?userid=VE7JiL_nBKYbdNyzsyWHAQ,Allie L.,"Jersey City, NJ",5 star rating,"While visiting Montreal, we stopped into Café M several times. Each time we were there, the chemex coffee was great and the breakfast sandwiches were delicious. The atmosphere was very nice and comfortable. The owner was so nice and warm that he boosted our experience from great to exceptional each time we visited. I would highly recommend this place and would certainly make a point to visit again if I find myself back in Montreal."
