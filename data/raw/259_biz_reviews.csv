The menu has the perfect amount of food to choose from as well as a full wine list. They do offer beer but only 2 types on bottle and nothing on tap. I really enjoyed their food and and service. This is a very nice place to take that special someone for a nice relaxing dinner, it's small and cozy but not small to the point that everyone is cramped together. It's a good sized restaurant that can fit about 80 to 120 people from my guess. When we sat down our server brought over a plate of fresh bread and a plate of what looks like brushetta but instead of bread for the base it was a refreshing block of fresh mozzarella.The Calamari Alla Piastra (grilled calamari) was very tasty tender and not tough at all cooked to perfection highly recommend it. The Filetto Di Manzo ( filet mignon ) was also cooked perfectly and paired with truffle mashed potatoes drizzled with a red wine reduction, the sauce was very deep and flavourful. The grilled tuna was very fresh light and complex this comes with a mix of fresh veggies as well, this one is a daily special not on their daily menu.I know BYOW is very popular in Montreal however this one is not a BYOW. Their wine selection a full menu with probably a selection of close to or over 100 types. The price ranges from $45 to north of $600 depending on what your budget is and by the glass is about $10 to $15.Our server was always on the balls or her feet always swinging by to check that we had our sparkling water topped and wines topped. She was very friendly and always smiling, whenever someone would leave the table we would find her folding the napkin back and placing onto the table very nice touch. It's not expensive to eat here but not cheap if you order a bottle of wine I think on average if you don't order by the bottle you can walk out paying around $60 to $70.Would recommend to anyone looking for a fancy place to dine."

/user_details?userid=Zd3wzNdevk15CwMIJdbjZw,Diana S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This is where you come if you want a guaranteed-to-please food menu, full wine list, and quiet, spacious seating. In other words, this place is not one-of-a-kind, hipster, different than any other 4/5 star restaurant you've tried in any other city, but at least the food feels familiar and place still feels posh and serious enough to entertain special guests. The main pros that make MKT stand out would be-1) Spacious and quiet, even on a Friday night (not meant to be a backhanded compliment). It's rare these days to find a centrally located, nice restaurant where you can just walk in, get seated immediately, and still be able to hear your party from across the table.2) Good lighting! Yes, even at night! But might be too bright for certain occasions that might demand more intimacy...3) Attention and care given to the food. Despite ""basic"" Italian/Mediterranean menu items, every dish showed evidence that the kitchen cared about our experience. The vegetarian truffle gnocchi was small, but well presented, and ultimately flawless in texture and taste. I was in love with my seafood stew, which featured giant, juicy scallops, tenderly cooked fish, and an abundance of clams and mussels. The stew tasted so fresh and I was very impressed with the generous portion. Overall, the place lost 1 star for being ""basic"", but 10/10 I would return if in the area and just want a place that I know will satisfy."
/user_details?userid=wWHeaOS28fnCnFN1Pmo3xg,Shaan A.,"Thornhill, Vaughan, Canada",4 star rating,"This was a cool spot in an old building just off of Sherbrooke. They have an after 9 special which is what I was most interested in (an appetizer and a main for $26). Came on a weekend night and luckily I made reservations as the place was quite backed. It was a very contemporary, bustling environment which pink lighting, marble tables, and comfortable seating. The servers were very kind and courteous and seated my party immediately. We all opted for the after 9 special, which gives you the most value for your meal since otherwise each main costs about $26-35. I decided on the soup of the day for my appetizer or entrees (en francais), and the salmon tartar with house fries as my main. Oh btw, the menu is in Italian and French for the after 9 special so bear that in mind if you're having trouble translating. The servers are happy to assist you thought with anything. Before the appetizers came out, they brought some lovely fresh focaccia with homemade goat cheese. It was absolutely delicious. The appetizers came out piping hot and quite fast. The mains however took a while, but the server gave us some additional bread to tie us over. I've heard seafood is well known here, and indeed it did not disappoint. The tartar was delicious and fresh. In all, a really great choice for dinner. I'll definitely be back soon!"
/user_details?userid=V_yDb-sO60p2w7hPxV5P5A,Alexander S.,"Birmingham, AL",4 star rating,"Good Italian restaurant, but nothing extraordinary and prices are too high.Have been there for a dinner. I've got grilled octopus with white beans for appetizer and braised veal rigatoni for main course, my wife ordered gnocchi with mushrooms, and daughter picked up the meatballs. Octopus was properly cooked, maybe slightly overroasted, but still tasty. Veal was a bit underdone, there were meat pieces with unseparated fibers, the dish as a whole was good, but I would say in Tutta Bella they make it better. Gnocchi were very delicious, with tender pasta and properly done mushrooms. Meatballs were meatballs - good for kids, but too much tomato sauce for me. We also got two glasses of Chianti, which was average, but you can't expect much from the wine by the glass, and a couple of gelatos, which weren't bad, but you can get better and cheaper ice cream in the underground passageway across the street. So overall experience was good, decent Italian food with polite service and pleasant atmosphere, and I'd give this place 5 stars, if not for their prices. The total bill with taxes was about 150, and if my wife got an appetizer, it would've been 165-170. The day before, we had a dinner at Bonaparte, which is a restaurant from a different league, and our bill was about 180. So MKT should either add some masterpieces to the menu, or lower their prices."

Everyone enjoyed their main courses we had fish and meat and everyone was satisfied. I took a large group of work colleagues and clients and the servers were very attentive and helpful.

When we stepped in we noticed restaurant had a nice ambiance with just a hint of Mediterranean feel.I ordered chicken breast with grilled veggies and my husband ordered risotto bouillabaisse. Unfortunately kitchen made a mistake and it took a while for our food to come out. My husband got seafood bouillabaisse instead. Regardless, the food was very tasty. Our waitress apologized for the mistake and talked to the manager and they did not charge for my husband's meal. Now that is what I call Customer Service!!! If you get there after 9:00 pm you can get 3 course meal for $28!!!!!"
/user_details?userid=cF1oFZ2cl1xpQIsq-yA4mQ,Aretha C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here for mtl a table, where they offered a three course meal for $31.The atmosphere is relaxed and modern, bordered by neon pink lights. The lighting and noise levels were all just right, making the dining experience extremely comfortable. Service was also fast and courteous, our server explained to us the selections of the day and was really friendly. They served us homemade ciabatta and goat cheese to start, which were extremely impressive. The bread was sooo fresh and pillowy, laced with black olives. First, I started off with meatballs and polenta. A real comfort! The meatballs weren't anything special but the dish as a whole was very well balanced. That polenta was sooo creamy and dreamy. I also tried the other appetizers offered, which were the fresh mozzarella with artichoke, and the octopus salad with beans. Next, I got the seafood and fish bouillabaisse. This dish showcased a variety of seafood, including salmon, mussels, scallops, clams, squid, and octopus. The flavours tasted rather uniform with the strong broth, but you can tell the seafood was high quality and fresh. I also tried the grilled chicken breast (wonderfully grilled!) and the pasta with wild boar.For dessert, I got the ricotta and Nutella pie. I always think pies are supposed to be warm so I think I'll call this one a tart. Kind of dry, so I think it could've used something more.Conclusively, the price for the quality of ingredients offered was phenomenal (at least during the event). Food wasn't mind blowing delicious, but it was a wonderful dining experience and I left satisfied with the meal."

Samuel C kills for anchovies but I did not miss them here.)A comforting salmon tartare.Farfalle with goat cheese and pesto with addictive pan sauteed pinoli nuts.I ate the other bitefuls waiting for the next pinoli nut treat.* * *Now for the silver prize and the gold legendary trophy:The Silver Prize is for some of the best french fries I have had EVER.Now upscale restaurants tend to have really really good french fries.So no promise that your local French bistro does not make french fries that bring tears to your eyes.But these babies were pure and unadulterated cocaine.Potato raised to the highest level of flavor and nobility.If you were to be reborn as a potato,and you were to be dug out of the ground - you would want to have mkt make a french fry out of you.Your existence in your life as a potato would have been justified.* * *And the envelope please ....The Gold Legendary award for Awesome and Unique Dessert:(drum rolls, rotating spotlights, Katy Perry's hand shaking as she hands the envelope to the emcee ...)The winner isTHE LEMON TIRAMISU CAKE!(The crowd roars!)* * *I have never had a dessert like the Lemon Tiramisu cake.It was NOT sweet.The only function of the sugar was to cut the lemon.It had a head-filling mouth-filling lemon taste without being either cloying or tart in any way.It was a cake - but it was light as chiffon.There was none of the stodge that comes with a chocolate layer cake or a banana cake or a red velvet cake.It was not laden and rich like a tres leches cake.* * *This cake floated like a helium balloon and sang its lemon song.* * *I floated like a helium balloon and sang my lemon song.* * *The world was creamy.The world was white and yellow.* * *Undoubtedly with all that filling, the cake had more than its share of calories.But it tasted like I was eating a lemon cream breeze without a calorie to its name.* * *I will undoubtedly come back to earth tomorrow When I weigh myself after all that olive bread, farfalle, french fry and cake.* * *But right now, I am flying in a canary colored sky.Not a bad result for one night at a restaurant."

/user_details?userid=aIqDek9d1fDEgLIAWXMGSA,Robert L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4 star rating,I was invited out for lunch to this place from my FX dealer as I call him. Normally we go for noodles but this time he spoiled me. I guess he is making money from me. Service was excellent and always important they speak to me the language of my choice or they lose a star. The cream of Mushroom was excellent. I ate it so fast.....My main meal was the filet Mignon which was also really good just a tad over cooked. But still acceptable. the only fault of the place was that there is not salt/pepper and neither for Â my soup or meal was I offered and I love my pepper esp. for the soup and did not get any. So that cost time a star!!Dessert looked good but I try to avoid and did not have any.

Â Staff was top notch. Â Atmosphere was upscale but not at all stuffy. Â And the food? Â Holy heck it was amazing. Â The appetizers were wonderful (especially the meatballs and the lamb). Â The main courses were phenomenal: Â I have the pasta with five smoked meats (or something like that) and I was in heaven. Â Two people had fillets; one had pasta, and the final had one of the fish specials. Â Everyone was thrilled.I highly recommend the restaurant.

Portions are reasonable, a little on the small side, prices are high average. Meals are 25-40+CAD, appetizers/salads are 10-18CAD. I felt like the meal alone wasn't quite enough, I think you are meant to order some appetizers. I also felt like I wanted to lick the plate, the food was truly fantastic. The space is really lovely, a very enjoyable evening all around."
/user_details?userid=5G1LLdZNxwswR1TjMfiMig,Iatemontreal Q.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"How to construct an ideal dining experience. It is not easy we can tell you that. But sometimes you just hit on that magical combination of atmosphere, team and cuisine, and voila, a dining experience that is second to none. We recently discovers this perfect storm when we had the opportunity to dine at MKT. A lovely Italian bistro on Metcalfe street in the core of downtown Montreal. This establishment is fresh and brightly decorated, and is reminiscent of dining in the heart of the Mediterranean.Although the evening menu is set, but Â lunch service offers a different selection each day depending on the creativity of the chef. Ideally you could eat there for an entire week and be served a unique meal everyday.The dinning room is thin but quite long, with walls lined with art and scrolls announcing specials and menu items alike. One side sports an inviting bar and across the restaurant is an enticing display of available wines. The brightness of MKT makes patrons feel warm and is perfect to chase away any leftover winter blues.We were greeted by our host and MKT owner Parry, who gave us a little of the history of his vision. Having opened only one short year ago, this bistro has lived up to all expectations and offers the public a complete Italian dining experience.Our evening began with a taste of bruschetta and a sampling of a Greek white wine. The 2014 Biblia Chora Areti was flavorful and crisp and complemented the first two plates we were served. Both the octopus served on a bed of MKTwhite beans and the calamari prepared in a tomato sauce. It would be difficult to beat the pairing of the wine with the two dishes. Although the wine was quite complimentary it was subtle enough as it did not overwhelm the taste of the seafood.We moved onto the next two dishes and a bottle of red wine. First came the quail presented on salad and the gnocchi served in a delightful mushroom sauce. The taste was exquisite, and enhanced by a wonderful Dominique Piron Fleurie. Fruity and flavorful the wine was an MKTexcellent addition to our meal.After trying these amazing offerings we were sure there would be no way to top this meal. We are happy to say we were wrong. The bouillabaisse came next, warm and brimming with seafood, the dish was seasoned and excellently prepared. Each bite was a joy to eat.Sadly it was time to come to the end of our meal. But not before something sweet. The choices for this evening were the hazelnut gelato and the nutella and riccota tarte. The desserts were so good we dare you to try them and leave without finishing.Our evening meal was a wonderful event and you have to try MKT to create your own amazing dining experience. Trust us when we say it will be an adventure you will never forget."

Â The food was great, the wait staff attentive, and the place itself was very comfortable. Â  We had oysters for a starter, Kathleen had the Haddock Special and I had rabbit special which was quite good. Â Given the different things to eat, and the fact we were running in the Half-marathon in two days, this wasn't the evening for splitting a bottle of wine. Â So we went to the wines by the glass which, while only limited to a handful of choices, were all fine for the meal. We occasionally get to Montreal and this place is on our keeper list."

Â We started off with the grilled octopus over chickpea (basically hummus) purÃ©e and an endive spinach salad with pears, pecans and blue cheese. Â The octopus was very good and the salad was exquisite, an excellent combination of textures and tastes. Â For main courses, we had the bouillabaisse (seafood stew) and tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms and mascarpone. Â The stew was excellent, with many chunks of perfectly-done fish, shrimp, clams, etc. Â the stew was wonderfully tasty. Â The tagliatelle could have been improved just a bit. Â The taste was wonderful. Â I would have used a pasta with more body to hold up to the full taste instead of a thin fettuccine that was a tad over poked and not al dente. Â But, overall a lovely meal with excellent service."
/user_details?userid=AIAMsfb3UUP6q85XQk4iwg,John L.,"Outremont, Canada",3 star rating,"This place is overrated and expensive. Beware of the specials. Ours were more expensive than the mains on the menu. Bland halibut went for $36 (close to $50 with tip and tax!) while an enjoyable seafood risotto was $35, while, if I remember correctly, nothing on the menu exceeded $30. Could it be that the ""specials"" are designed to extract ""special"" prices from guests who are reluctant to ask the prices? My wife regretted not returning her over vinegary salad. The wine was excellent and the service courteous."
