First time I came here, we had customized drinks from a really fun bartender. We really enjoyed them.Second time for date night, we ordered the Thai chili coco drink and whiskey sour. Again, good choice of base alcohol (we got to choose the whiskey) and good service. However, the music was a bit off.Would come again because of the overall good experience."
/user_details?userid=HUkLmF3TUDZQRw7kfw0Pxw,Kartik G.,"Boston, MA",3 star rating,Wanted to try something new and heard good reviews on this place and wanted to check it out. Sat at the bar and ordered my drink. Had a good conversation with the bartender and learnt new things about drinks.My reason for 3 star is solely based on the experience I had. I just wanted to the restroom and when I came back my drink was gone. The waitress had taken my drink away. I just had few slips and it was not close to empty. I felt they could have offered me a new drink or give a complimentary something but nothing. They took the drink to the back of the kitchen and I am not sure if they kept it on a sink and just wiped and gave it back to me. I wish they would have done something better.
/user_details?userid=9TYpecJwv-HtNJtadramWQ,Chris U.,"Miami, FL",4 star rating,Hipstery. Cool music. Friendly bartenders. Gin-heavy custom cocktails.  Great variety of beers and ciders. Good sense of humor while trying to accommodate my dumb American friend trying to order a Cosmopolitan in a place like this. Nice vibe. All around great place for cocktails before dinner in Le Plateau.  I'll be back.
/user_details?userid=VseHlPAVhHbNZqyl_zRKBQ,Stephanie C.,"Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"If you're looking for non-basic creative cocktails, Le Lab is definitely the bar to check out! My friends and I decided to try this place out for a birthday celebration, and we were not disappointed at all! It's not your average bar, with such a huge bar selection and liquor, their creative cocktails are made with great ingredients - making them not only unique but delicious! You'll also notice that their bartenders and waiters know their drinks, and will be able to give you best recommendations for what you're looking for! Moreover, they offer great food, if you get hungry throughout the night. I definitely recommend the Basilica Colada, Long Island Colada and Irma cocktails, and the smooth Agave Moi shots! Overall, this place has great drinks at a fair price, and great service with lovely employees! Definitely will be coming back to try more of their cocktails."

The service was very slow and we had to ask multiple times to get some water while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. It wasn't even busy. The oysters were served on a mountain of salt, which we found to be wasteful. The oysters were not bad at all, but they weren't amazing, as there were multiple small pieces of shell. I was surprised that the drink offered was fixed and there weren't 2 or 3 choices. The music was a bit too loud, the staff was not very attentive and the food was ok. Therefore, it was a solid 2 stars."
/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,This is a fun cocktail bar with a large menu. I like sitting at the bar because the bartenders are really nice and put on a show. When they're making the drinks and you can see all the crazy things they make and there are some pretty interestingly presented ones. The bartenders can also make you drinks or give you good recommendations based on what kind of liquor and taste you want. The only food I've tried here are the fries but they were good. I'd like to go for their $1 oyster special as well.

This place is Great for drinks and food! I love how they had a full on menu. We pretty much ordered everything. In particular , we loved the Beef Cheek Dish!! It was sooooo goooooood. Like melt in your mouth and almost want to scrape the plate w the side of your fork, kind of good. XD the charcuterie board was good as well. We got a bunch of drinks. They have some specials for $9 which is a good deal. We also tried the Apple Pie shot. On their menu it says  it comes with Maple syrup, apple, calvados and Marshmallow skewer. This was Such a fun shot! It comes w some cute small marshmallows on a stick. You set the marshmallow skewer on fire , then set the shot glass on fire lol then drink it! This was definitely the highlight of our night xD Do it!!"

Gimmicky? Absolutely. Tasty? Oh yeah. My girlfriend loved her cocktail too, and the bartenders were very friendly. Side note - the soundtrack of early 2000's gangster rap really hit the spot. Nostalgia!"

Service was a little slow, but very helpful with recommendations. The cocktail menu is a unique booklet of descriptions and illustrations. I had the Santa Mule (whiskey, cinnamon, pear and homemade ginger beer) which was wonderful! Just a note: the restrooms are individual stalls with sinks outside. (visited 3/17/18)"
/user_details?userid=3RU_U3HdYU3AOs_r9rgoBg,Alex S.,"Vaughan, Canada",5 star rating,"I'm not a big fan of cocktails as usually I find them to be too sweet, but not at le lab! Both of the drinks I ordered (one was British island and unfortunately I don't remember the second) were just the right amount of sweet and liquor. This is not your typical bar where bartenders would pour Coke and liquor into a glass and call it a cocktail. The bartenders here are true cocktail chefs, each drink takes a few minutes to make and they use the best fresh ingredients.  Also their liquor selection is amazing, there were some items on their menu I haven't seen anywhere else. The drinks are priced accordingly (average $15 a cocktail )."

Lots and lots of flaming drinks are available for your pleasure, if that's what you're into.*I am not super into flaming things, unless I'm sharing a tiki bowl, so I went for a smoky manhattan. Pretty much everyone else at the table ordered different concoctions, and they were all delicious. One of them was a snifter where you inhaled warm banana steam before drinking the shot. What. I don't actually understand that much about mixology, but I know this place takes it seriously without being too pretentious. Reservations are recommended.

/user_details?userid=wZ0AkUZQmB3qMF1e2vYJvw,Kathryn T.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Le Lab is the place to go to for cocktails in Montreal. It is more than just a bar where you can get some drinks. Le Lab is a revolutionary bar where cocktails are created at the intersection of art and science (yeah, I went there).Here is what you need to know:1. The place can get so busy. If you go right when it opens, it'll be pretty empty at the bar but tables are generally reserved for all the hours that Le Lab is open.2. You have so many options. There's the rotating menu, specials written on a whiteboard hanging above the bar, and basically anything you want can be created here. 3. Why art and science you say? To make my drink, the bartender LIT IT ON FIRE and mixed it with flames engulfing the tequila. My friend's drink was served in a multi-tiered teapot.4. The drinks are strong.5. It's more of a small group of friends vibes.6. Mostly locals, some tourists.7. Service is great.I can't recommend Le Lab enough if you love cocktails and are in Montreal. It's a place you have to check out and experience."
/user_details?userid=3QnoTcrxuafMCoTzW_AH7A,Sari Marissa G.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"Le Lab is a pretty fantastic spot to grab a cocktail or to 'drink' outside the box with the absinthe experience or a flaming shot. We took a seat at the welcoming bar and right away were served cucumber water. Very nice touch. Everything about this place with a sexy, lounge-y, dark, speakeasy vibe was really quite perfect. The mood lighting, the playful French music, the modern meets vintage feel, the handsome bartenders clad in prohibition era garb and of course the very extensive cocktail menu with some incredibly innovative gems as well as some seasonal specials on the chalkboard menu. This place has the best of both worlds... a perfect mix of old meets new which I am such a fan of. It's done so incredibly right here. For example, they offer an entire page of just gins and classic hard drinks, but also a plethora of carefully crafted cocktails as well as an entire page of ones they light on fire! Le Lab also has a few modern touches such as subway tiles, geometric tiles and exposed brick as well as vintage photos, a vintage cash register, textured wallpaper and ornate mirrors and vanities. Love it! A ton of personality is found here in the decor, the offerings and even the wording in the menu. We each chose one of their creative cocktails for $15 Canadian we absolutely LOVED!! ""Pumpkin Paste"" which had butter orange Regans, purée de courage, gingerbread syrup, dry Curaçao, Pierre Fernrand & Couvoisier ""Matcha Misu"" which was topped with matcha powder and coconut. It had mascarpone in it! A lot of thought went into the design of every single aspect of the place right down to the drink garnish. This is not just a bar, it's an experience. If I lived here this would absolutely be my favorite place to grab a drink and I highly, highly recommend stopping by here! Perfect date night spot."
/user_details?userid=8_VB4EgpEV6OH4InYdQkug,Cassie W.,"Merrimac, MA",3 star rating,"Overall, my experience at this place was really good. I got the Waloma and I loved it! I'm not normally one to drink whiskey, but in this drink it was amazing! As good as my drink was, the service was very slow. When we got seated our drink order was taken pretty quickly and our drinks were quick to follow. However, the issue came after my friend finished his first drink and wanted another. No one came to check on us for quite some time. We weren't the only ones who experienced the slow service that night as the two people next to us were waiting to put in a food order for a long time. I would go here again, but only if I was going to get one drink."
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"They just opened three days ago. It's the first time I've been in the Lab. They offer more than 1000 cocktails according to the waitress.I was impressed first by the beaker on the bar. I haven't seen one in years since my high school. Real thing, like in the chem lab.  I thought those are for decor but the drink we ordered required the beaker instead of the shaker. i had a Japanese sake martini and my husband had a dry martini.I love the design of their menu and the background music. Everything was just perfect. They have a huge selection of cocktail. Can't decide which one to have? Just describe what base you like and what tone you may want. The bartender will have something for you. Our bartender Tony was amazing. He really got some techniques for the drink. He is so cool. Will come againThe most important thing they own a Pokemon Gym."

Great to see such enthusiasm.Watching the bartenders prepare the drinks was like watching a great chemist in the lab - poetry in motion as the add the various bitters, spray perfumes on the top, etc.I had the tropical Gibson.  The pickled pineapple was pretty interesting.  Everyone at our table was amazed at how well-balanced the flavors of their drinks were.  When making these kind of exotic boissons, it would be easy to go over the top with any particular flavor, but that was not the case here.We left happy and a little tipsy.If you are into truly great cocktails, try this place.  Haven't experienced anything like it since New York city."
/user_details?userid=q7S0YHoPVvVYNnBLt0otAg,Jackson H.,"Muncie, IN",5 star rating,"One of my favorite places I went while in Montreal. The inside is so cool. Hardwoods. Full bar. Dark lighting. Industrial decor. The bartender was super friendly, and recommended some really good drinks. Every drink he poured was a literal show. I had a Moscow mule and 'peach secret' speciality drink. The peach drink was meh, but I don't like peach flavored drinks a whole lot. The mule was amazing. Mint, ginger beer, lime, etc. One can't go wrong with this. One of my friends had this wild jerky drink? That was entertaining. In terms of prices, maybe a bit high. I'm not sure. This place is an experience, so I was happy to pay and tip a bit more."
/user_details?userid=Pmu2Aqe_6JkXgaIH0gGo2w,Sherry B.,"Oviedo, Orlando, FL",2 star rating,"It pains me greatly to give this bar 2 stars, but wow, the service was terrible. Let's start with what was great. This place has an incredible drink menu, filled with unique, complex, creative cocktails. Very speakeasy vibe. The drinks were on the pricier side, which makes sense given the ingredients and sophistication of each cocktail, but it is worth noting. The decor is also quite lovely, continuing with the prohibition/speakeasy ambiance. Even their menus nailed ""the look"" and were beautiful to peruse.Our problem arose with getting service. When we entered the bar, we were patrons #8 and #9. There was virtually no one there. We became the fifth and sixth person at the bar, with three people in a booth near the front. We got our first round of cocktails immediately. Great.We wanted to order some food. We were informed the kitchen was closed but we could offer something from their late night snack menu. Just getting that information and the the subsequent delivery of said menu took 20 minutes. When we had settled on what we wanted to order, we asked the guy who gave us the menu if we could place our order. He said orders could only be placed with the bartender. Apparently this guy we were talking to was a greeter/water delivery person only? OK, fine, we could order from the bartender; we needed another round of drinks anyway. Only problem is the bartender just could not manage to get over to us. Probably because another table of four had sat down and each person had ordered one of their wildly complex cocktails. And yet the bar was, no lie, 10% full. How is this business scalable?Here's the thing about awesome, competition-winning cocktails: You can't have only one person in the entire joint who can make them. And you also can't have this person be the only person who can type a food order into the computer screen.I would love to come here again next time I'm in Montreal, but I just cannot imagine spending that much time awaiting service. Sorry guys, only come here if you've got time to blow. And maybe your own hip flask."

I remember on the menu they ""strongly discourage"" you to order this. so usual me, that's the first thing I'm going to order.she brought our cocktail with two glasses, after some mesmerizing moves and rotation while flames are dancing in your glasses she puts snifter glass upside down over the other glass and killed the fire.Here is the trick the fire creates an alcoholic vapor inside the snifter glass, so you have to pick up the snifter, inhale the alcohol vapor and then drink the rest. I'm telling you it's an experience that you have to try."

They have an EXCELLENT cocktail menu with reasonable prices, along with a long happy hour (something like 4-8pm). The happy hour features a few bucks off three different cocktails and a beer. The staff is very nice, but things can run a bit slow when they are crowded. It took us a while to get our first drink order in and to come, but after that it was not too bad.

The drinks were good but the food was pedestrian and mediocre, while service was absolutely horrible. Seafood roll buns were not toasted and bland, salad was under seasoned, tataki was overcooked, but the ravioli was good. That's not the worst part though. The worst was it took 2.5 hours to get 4 dishes. It took 45mins to get water. It took 15mins to get cutlery. On top of all that, when they run out of food, they tell you 2 hours in. Absolutely horrid service. They don't comp or even worst they dont apologize. I dont know if it's just the guy with a moustache/beard that gave bad service, but this is hands down the worst service in Montreal for a reputable establishment. I still gave the server 15% tip."

The cocktails taste extremely artificial due to the extensive use of flavouring, and most of the staff is inexperienced and tends to be quite rude.Overall there at so many better places to go to in Montreal if you enjoy good quality, handcrafted cocktails - don't waste your time by going here."

My wonderful date took me here and we had a blast challenging niko to create me custom drinks with anything i can think of! First drink: raspberries, elderflowers, sweet yet sour - niko nailed it! I was in heaven sipping the carefully crafted drink. It took him a good 10 mins to make it, sneaking in little shows like flipping bottles and muddling with one a 1 foot muddler. Second drink: no foam, peach, rounded glass, also sweet yet soury. Nailed it again. I called this drink 'le suzana'. Topped it off with a burning sugar cube. Cool stuff: it's like a vintage bar with magic potions and syrups. They take care to custom craft the drinks, and their menu apparently has editions, so they are always mixing it up. We were on menu 17 at the time!They also teach bartending here, so these peeps know their stuff! They speak france french... which is... Music was a tad bit too loud, and peeps were a tad bit too young, but it's one of my top 3 bars in montreal for sure!"

So my friend and I split the smaller tiki drink, The Beach Comber. It was exactly what the description had described... fruity, complex & strong. Although the prices are higher than other bars, it worth the premium & hype. The quality shows through. Definitely on my list when I return to the city!"

I was offered nothing in return and there was no supervisor nor manager with which to settle the  matter. I was pretty much ignored by my server afterwards, saying she would ""check to see what she could find out"". Stupidly, and because I was hungry, I ordered the calamars and artichoke frits. There were perhaps two chiclet-sized artichokes and it was served cold. Cold fried food is not so good. Oh, also I was moved from my original spot because ""a big party was arriving"". No party arrived while I was there yet a small group of three was seated where I had been sitting. Mind you this table was in the back without anyone seated near it whatsoever.

Okay, let's start with their decor, it's not too much and not too little, I would even say cool. Definitely, gives you an impression that it's a serious cocktail establishment. It is a little bit small so it may not be the place to bring a group of 15 people or more.  I  really like how creative they get with the drinks, my Sex on la beach came in a ""plastic"" looking cup, topped with a flower and a cute card. Maybe I just like pretty cocktails, but it did tasted delicious. There is also, some kind of drink show going at the bar, flaming shots and all.

He even suggested some speakeasy cocktail bars to try around Montreal that we would've never known about otherwise.We loved it so much we came back the very next evening for another round of drinks.

/user_details?userid=0L0jUiuVpU6AiGZj1TYndQ,Vanessa P.,"Boca Raton, FL",2 star rating,"5 stars on the ambiance and options for drinks. 1 star for service.We really wanted to love this place. It had everything going for it - ambiance (fun old timely type music) plus an array of wonderfully creative cocktails. The downside? Lack of service. We were only able to order one drink and then our waitress went completely missing in action. The drinks we ordered (one was a maple old fashioned, the other was also a slight twist on an old fashioned but forgot the name) and the good thing is that they were all great. It's just a shame that we only had the chance to enjoy one drink due to service. Granted it did get busy (was a Friday night) but the table next to us had to chase the same waitress down to pay their bill, and we eventually had to do the same, waiting about 25 minutes after we flagged her to give us the check. The truth is we had planned on enjoying several drinks, but with such poor service we couldn't justify spending anymore time nor money. My advice to the owner is get more service help otherwise you're likely to miss out on more $$$ from consumers who actually want to give you money.In short: if you don't want to have bad service sitting at the bar will likely do you wonders."

I am a light weight drinker so I can't really give feedback on how strong the drinks are (every drink is strong to me..). But they have really fun and interesting ones. The place is definitely understaffed as I caught myself wondering if the server forgot about our orders, but it turns out he just had too many tables to take care of. They don't really have a good selection of bar food at night since kitchen closes at 10 or 10:30pm. They have stuff like popcorn, but no chicken tenders or fries.I'm not sure how it is at a later time as We stayed for only a half hour before we headed somewhere else. Good place to pregame though!"

/user_details?userid=VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw,WhiteFeather H.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"BRILLIANT!! This is my new fave bar in Montreal, hands down. I've been wanting to come here for months, and finally had the chance. I'm not sure I'll go anywhere else again. It's all about the craft of cocktail mixing at Le Lab, which well-informed servers and bartenders take great pride in here. I've now had Le Lab cocktails that blow the socks off any cocktail I've ever had, anywhere. Extreme creativity goes into crafting these liquid delights, not only in the combination of exquisite ingredients, but also in the naming and presentation. Let me give a few divine examples:CHUPACABRA (named after a frightening creature of Latin American fame that eats children) - Comes thick and bloody-looking in a martini glass - Beet syrup, grapefruit bitters, chipotle tabasco, egg white, lime, curacao Pierre Ferrand and Cazadores tequilaTaste: ***** (impeccable)UNION PACIFIC (for cross-continent travelers like me) - Comes in a low champagne glass, perfect for making toasts - Cardamom and curry bitters, Old Timer tonic syrup, lime, mandarin and Pisco (a Chilean liquor)Taste: **** (Perfect if you love a punchy cardamom and curry taste - delightfully sweet and bitter together)RENAISSANCE (for elegant ladies - they say, ""Remembering a pilgrimage to the Sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin of Miracles in Saronna..."") - comes in a low champagne glass with a hot pink orchid propped against the side (orchid is edible) - Lavender bitters, China China amaro, Thyme Bigallet and Di Saronno AmarettoTaste: ***** (delicate, balanced, miraculous really)CALAMITY JESS (a true mouthful of magic) - Comes in a low glass with a snifter turned upside down and holding in the liquor steam that accumulates after the drink has been lit aflame - Peach and vanilla bitters, cherry syrup, water, Benedictine and Jim Beam Black bourbon - the magic is in the first inhalation of steam that's been captured by the snifter, which you lift off and inhale before your first sipTaste: ***** (pure witchcraft)Also, dears - FLAMBE SHOTSThe COULEUR CAFE is some serious delicious action. It requires a minor tutorial before you are allowed to consume it. You must sip it with a straw slid into the flaming liquid, because, well -flaming beards- and ringlets otherwise. This is epic-ally delicious - Tia Maria, Amarula and Absinthe. Taste: *****I could go on, but that's a small sampling of the beautiful cocktail paradise that exists here. There is a massive, well-designed booklet of a booze menu that includes no less than 13 types of absinthe, an extremely decked out gin selection, nearly two full pages of whiskeys, a good selection of local beers, rums and tequilas and mescals, nonalcoholic mocktails for the pregnant ladies, as well as a small selection of their own handcrafted syrups (ie. Hell's Ginger, Tiki 1930, Tropical BBQ, etc) - I will be picking up one of those treasures the next time I'm there, which likely won't be too long from now. This is an extraordinarily long review, but this is an extraordinary bar, a true mixologists' dream. Tip: everybody in the know wants to come here. Call ahead to reserve a table if you're smart! Beautiful interior and cushy décor. Very classy. If you like dressing up, this is your chance. Otherwise, casual is ok. But, this is a perfect place to live out a fantasy.PS - they also have a small but refined selection of table snacks, too, if you're feeling nibbly."

The mixologists are extremely talented and know exactly what to mix together (and what not to).The drink menu is vast. You can also ask them to whip up something based on your tastes, but I find sometimes that can be a little overwhelming. I started with a Mai Tai (not your traditional overly sweet kind, but mixed with all the right juices and liquor) and the 1848 (definitely a heavy ginger taste, beware). Reservations are a must (even for the bar) or you'll be standing. Drinks are pricey, pace yourself."

No problem- we were only staying for one drink. The one drink took FOREVER to get and Le Lab was practically empty. I ordered a hot cocktail off the menu, the guys ordered bourbon neat and the other ladies ordered basic drinks. We knew we were in trouble when the server came back after 10-15 minutes and didn't have the bourbon on the menu. Nor did they have the second choice. One friend ordered Patron and soda and the server asked her to point it out at the bar because they couldn't find it!! All in all, it took 45 minutes to get six basic drinks and 1 cocktail from the menu. My advice is to avoid this place - there's so many great bars in Montreal- this place won't last with service like that."

The bar has an impressive selection that showcased various liquors.Our mixologist (Gabrielle?) was amazingly friendly and had this really cute french accent I couldn't help but ask where she was from. She was very accommodating particularly after some coaching from my Yelp friends to let her create a drink for me, which you'll see enclosed below.One thing is for sure, they take their mixology pretty seriously. I watched her mix up my drink and she looked like she knew what she was doing.

We finished our ABC flaming fire shot and said we would be back tomorrow.  We returned the next evening before our dinner plans. We ended up staying much longer than expected. It was was so hard to leave Jessie and her amazing drinks and personality. She would ask our favorite spirits and make the most delicious and creative drinks I had seen (my bf and I are both bartenders too). Both Tonys were super nice and funny, and they kept us very entertained as well. Taller tony had even remembered my name and it was my birthday from the night before and proceeded to sing happy birthday again. It really made me smile and feel really special.

Once you push the red curtains guarding the entrance aside and walk into the bar you're immediately transported to another era. Dim red lights are illuminating this Moulin Rouge-like bar, the bartenders are taking shots while playing with fire, and the brouhaha is pouring into your ears - what a time to be alive.Once seated, the menu was handed to us along with a glass of water. Exactly what we needed since Le Lab was our third bar stop and dehydration from the alcohol was kicking in? Anyways, my pick was the Tiger Thai Collins which was probably the best cocktail I've ever had. The coconut added a creamy richness, the lime gave the drink a citrus zing, and finally, the hot pepper delivered the knockout punch into heaven. It was so good that I wanted to try other drinks but it was time for our next bar stop.Expertly well thought drinks accompanied with crazy butt clenching pyromaniac stunts, a definite return. Truly a must try bar if you're in Montreal."

Tony, the bartender was very nice and we were able to chat for a bit as it was a slow Sunday night. We had a few other drinks, of which I don't remember the names...because as I said, we had a few other drinks. All were good and unique. Tony also worked on a new drink, trying to find a new drink of the month, he let us try. All in all, a fun experience on our final evening and I would return on a busier night for some more drinks!"

You don't go there to order a vodka-cranberry or a beer. You go there for the specialty cocktails prepared expertly by skilled mixologists using great liquors and ingredients.Service is superb. You can order from the cocktail menu, or if you feel adventurous, you can provide some guidelines and they'll mix something up for you. For instance I'm a big mezcal lover and there were no mezcal cocktails in the menu. They proposed something mixed with scotch and it was fantastic!Food is secondary there, small bites, but it taste good and can ensure you don't get drunk too fast.Will I be back? Of course.

Our server didn't handle the crowd very well, and it took a long time for us to get our order in and drinks when they were ready. I made the mistake of ordering the Zombie goblet, which is listed under a punch bowl. I chalked up the hefty $25 price tag to what I thought would be a generous serving, but was only slightly bigger than a pint. It tasted exactly as you would expect of the strongest liquors thrown together: not great, but if you have the money and want to get drunk, go for it.My friend got the strange jerky lab jack, which came out with a piece of jerky on a mini-pulley. It was better than the zombie for sure. Everyone else also got flaming shots. Fire seems to be a key theme here. I had a bad seat, but the bartenders started doing some kind of flamethrowing show while we were there that everyone ooh-ed and ah-ed over. Everyone else, my friends included, seemed to be having a great time, so I figure four stars is fair. I was just disappointed that we kept hearing this was The Best Bar in all of Montreal, and it didn't quite live up to that."

In doing so we probably drank more than we should,as we walked around the city we would stumble upon a place that looked cool so we would take a break and have a drink.    Le Lab was one of those places. we walked in on a Thursday at 10pm. I was so surprised that we were the only people in the bar. That lasted for about an hour and then it became a popping tiki-esque lounge. The cocktails we had were out of this world awesome. The choice of bitters alone was staggering. Ever flavor imaginable, which made for some pretty terrific cocktails. My favorite drink had to be the jerky Lab Jack, featuring a base of Jack Daniels, BBQ bitters or mist, and a small clothes line featuring a sizable piece of beef jerky.     I also had the pleasure of having an award winning mint julep made by the man who won the title. It was absolutely phenomenal and exactly the cocktail to enjoy amid the humidity of summer.    While there we also had the opportunity to talk to one of the owners/investors, Daniel. Who was one of the sweetest and coolest dudes we met while on our travels. He filled us in on the top places to grab a drink. We talked about the differences between the city of Montreal and Toronto. The latter may just be our future home.   I am so glad we stopped in, and if you ever find yourself in the area you should stop in too!"

I'm terrible with names so I never got the bartenders name but we searched for a place that offered absinthe and we found this quaint place. This is not the flagship store, and significantly close for us. We drank the colour Café shots (small, $6 for 1, and $20 for 4). He insisted on more, and we didn't understand why at first. He combined our order with others and did a little ""show"" including pouring the shots, drinking alcohol, and blowing fire! We had a wonderful experience overall. Arrived too late to order food as the kitchen closes at 10 pm. The bathrooms are individual stalls that are unisex so you may wash your hands with someone of the opposite gender.

That said, the worst cocktail bar experience I've ever had in Montreal. Came in around midnight on a Wednesday (during the Jazz Festival). The place was barren, though a spot a few blocks away was doing fair business. Should have taken the hint, but tried anyway... Drinks (only one for me, but true for my companion's as well) were unimpressive, which might have been related to the bartender being completely distracted from her job, by video on her phone *while making the drink*, and by her friend the rest of the time. The waitress left the building entirely for a while (with/after the friend), so no help there.My choice, their ""signature"" drink, once eventually delivered, was in a fancy apparatus, into the design of which someone (else) had again put some effort. Mine, however, included the remnants of a missing clothespin, which might have been intended to actually hold a third morsel of jerky as highlighted in the drink's description, and a beverage which was bland in a cup almost entirely filled with ice (note: I entirely get the use of a lot of ice to slow melt speed and balance the drink; this wasn't that).Finished the little there was to the drinks, and then had to walk up to the register get someone's attention to pay and leave.All in all, this visit not only turned me off to this bar, it ended my night entirely, and might have also caused me to not buy a cobranded bottle of vermouth from their partner supplier had I not already done so during my tour of the near Eastern Townships."

I saw the awesome review and figured i would check it out for myself.If every bar held their standards to the level this place had, the world would be a better place. Four of us came in around 11 pm on Saturday night and got one of the best seats in the house right across from the bar. I immediately loved the decor, it was very dimly lit and cosy. The fabrics on one wall, the brick on another, the display of bottles behind the bar, the entire design was fantastic. The bar is extermely eye catching and the drinks did not disppaoint. You are paying anywhere from $10-$16 a drink but they are fantastic cocktails that you can tell some love was put into making them.We did not try any of the food but we had about 6 drinks total and everyone was great. I immediately can spot a good bar when before even taking your order for a cocktail they bring you a glass of water. Not something everyone cares for but its responsible, and personally i like it. The bar tenders will spin and throw bottles, use fire, and do big swinging pours which is awesome to watch and it makes the entire experience a bit more exciting then your traditional bar.I would absolutely recommend this place to a friend.

/user_details?userid=dhPp4t9_fD0R0eNsp_gYZw,Mike S.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,Eureka!!! Probably the best cocktail bars in Montreal and arguably Canada.  The bartenders here are PhDs in their art.  True bartending has lost its way but the lab has meticulously revived it like Dr. Frankenstein's monster.  The selection and vast array of liquors opens up the menu to a cornucopia of options.  They will design drinks to your specifications and entertain you with witty stories and the history of their trade.  Next time you're in la belle province you must stop at Le Lab!

The decor and atmosphere were incredible, and the bartenders were so friendly and knowledgeable. I had a great time watching them mix drinks behind the bar with incredible precision and attention to detail. My friends and I each ordered a different drink, and the drinks were all pricey but fantastic. The drinks that stood out in my mind were the Chinatown (like a Moscow mule but better), the Dali-Labma (the elderflower was such an interesting taste), and behind the bar (smoky, strong, and well balanced- the bartender confessed this to be her favorite as well). This was overall an incredible experience, and I have never enjoyed drinks more than the ones I had here."

Nothing on the menu was really recognizable as a classic cocktail. I usually get an Old Fasioned. The waitress recommended a cocktail that was comparable. It was fantastic. The drinks are all made with care and they take some time to come out but they are worth it. When the bartenders make a drink its really a performance. They light things on fire, flip bottles, and incorporate smoke. If you go to Montreal make sure you stop here."

Upon sitting at the bar, Darwin the bartender helped us make a decision from the prettiest little bar menu I've ever seen. He was an expert mixologist who had a remarkable level of precision creating our drinks. He served us 5 different delicious cocktails throughout the evening, creating the most unusually delicious concoctions we've ever tasted. My favorites were the Mary Poppins, Pomme de Pins, and the Ananas Flambé (it was actually on fire!!) I would highly recommend sitting at the bar and watching the mixology take place. We will be back!"

That skill is a part of the act here. We came at about 6:00 pm on a Wednesday. I think they had just opened as the place was empty. The set-up has an old school feel but it's modern. We sat at the bar for a while watched the bartender juggle cocktail shakers, then bring one of them around this back and walk it along his shoulder. Pretty cool trick I must say. He told us they have shows some nights where all the bartenders would be doing this kind of stuff and they get so packed that they have to lock the door. Intriguing!As I was going through the drinking menu, I noticed how much detail they put on there. Not only did they put on the ingredients for each drink, but they also had a phrase or two behind the inspiration of that drink along with a small drawing of the glass it would be served in. I settled for the De La Louisiane - an excellent concoction of bitters, absinthe, red vermouth, herbal liqueur and rye which was referenced in some 1937 drink mix book in New Orleans.  My wife got the Japanese Gimlet#2 which was a light, refreshing drink with sake, grey goose and basil.  I wouldn't hesitate recommending either one of those depending on your mood. Also refreshing and equally tasty was the Fleur de Lys but it had maple vanilla listed as one of the ingredients and I told the bartender that I didn't want the drink to be sweet. He added very little and so my drink wasn't sweet at all.I came to Montreal and found a little bit of NY in Le lab. It wouldn't be out of place at all if it were located somewhere in the West Village. The bartender told us the cocktail scene in Montreal hadn't really taken off yet but if more places like Le Lab pop up, it won't be too long till it does."

Went for a Yelp event so I may be slightly biased, but the whole experience was phenomenal. From the moment you step through that velvety red curtain, you feel like all time outside this bar has stopped, and the only thing that matters is what's happening inside . We had a signature (tropical) cocktail, and partook in their infamous punch bowl - fortunately, it was a Hawaiian themed event so getting loose was a prerequisite - which is actually a year round beverage option. Because who doesn't love sangria in the dead of winter?! After looking at the menu, I'd say this is probably not the place where Joe Average would become a regular (drinks are pretty pricey), but it's dolphinitely the kind of place that I could see myself coming for a drink or two (or three). Oh, and I also have to give them bonus points for their dazzling internet videos. If you haven't seem them, go check 'em out. It'll give you a good sense of what I'm talking about."

/user_details?userid=kAaNTkRUKrTkIJIyJrVHyA,Jess C.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"After much research, I felt like this was THE bar at the forefront of mixology in Montreal. They had the most promising menu and reviews, and despite a mishap with a lost cab + the bitter cold, we made our trek here. And we weren't disappointed.Past the velvet curtains, you find yourself in a dim-lit, dark-paneled room with suddenly chatty French-Canadians, mostly late 20s to 30-somethings (+ older), thanks to liquid courage. Small talk might not be their strong suit, but tame dancing definitely is (no twerking here) avec le DJ de la nuit.Their menu is a tad overwhelming, but you can't go wrong with most of them. They have everything from creamier drinks e.g. Lemon in the Sky, classics e.g. martinis, shareable punch bowls, and even mocktails. However, if you want a show, you want one of their flaming shots/drinks in the back pages. We quickly bonded with Eddy, one of three bartenders working that night (and my high school writing teacher doppelganger), and he introduced us to the ABC - absinthe, bacardi, chartreuse - which involved two glasses, maniacal (just kidding) shaking, and some fire, of course.It seems that I'll be back in town sooner than I anticipated, so I will definitely be ordering the jerky lab jack and apple crumble shot this time!Notes:- They have happy hour! select drinks for $8 before 8PM (normally $14)"

You can get some pretty cool drinks made by the bartender where they will do crazy tricks but expect to pay up to 50$ for one of those. The cocktails and drinks are a bit pricey at about 10-20$ depending on what you get, but the ingredients they use are pretty unique and I doubt you could find their selection of drinks anywhere else in the city.

/user_details?userid=-_2h2cJlBOWAYrfplMU-Cg,Billy K.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"I stopped by with some Yelp friends on a Saturday night at about 1:30 am. It was busy but we were still able to find a table. I'm normally a beer guy but decided to try some cocktails and get a glimpse of the bartenders in action. Drinks are set on fire, mixed by pouring multiple bottles into a single glass and tossing / throwing bottles between bartenders. The show greatly contributes to the overall experience.It took a little time to place our first drink order but once we did, service greatly improved and we had no problems ordering for the rest of the night. When our server was busy, one of the bartenders actually left the bar and came over to take our order. Great teamwork & service! One of the bartenders introduced himself and started a conversation with us. When he found out we were from out of town, he brought us a round of shots on the house (and had one with us). A modest gesture but it left a big impact on me.The drinks are really interesting and like nothing I had before. I tried the following:1) The Zombie ($28). The price is high on this one but it's huge - many times the size of other cocktails. This drink had everything in it (I lost track of all the ingredients), it was fascinating to see it being made. Despite all the ingredients, the drink came together nicely.2) Beef Jerky cocktail ($14) made with actual house made beef jerky (they also sell the beef jerky as a snack if your hungry). This drink is smokey in flavour with a large piece of beef jerky in the cocktail. Not sure I could drink this all night but definitely  worth a try.3) Blazer Bastard ($14) was a warm / heated cocktail. The drink arrives at your table covered so it's warm when you start drinking it. Another unique drink experience.Although this is clearly a cocktail bar, they had 8 beers on the menu including selections from St. Ambroise & Cheval Blanc.  Note - If your from out of town, the servers speak english and the menus included English. The website appears to be french only.I will definitely be back on my next Montreal trip. A great display, relaxed atmosphere and interesting drinks ensure you will have a great evening. BK"

I usually find these places too crowded and noisy for me but I do like a good original cocktail once in a while so this place was recommended.It was friday night and it's downtown so expect the place to get very busy very quickly. The lighting is intimate verging on the pitch dark and they have a live dj pushing the decibels to the max.We got there early, before the masses, and got two seats at the bar just to watch the ""chemists"" do their things.One of the bartender was super nice and funny... Unfortuntaly, we got the other one who I hope was just having a bad day. He was rude and arrogant, not just with us but with many of the people who ordered with him.The cocktails we tried (Not-for-the-goonies, vent-de-provence and bébé-dragon) were all quite good and usually served in an original way (glasses and all). They are quite expensive which I wouldn't mind if on top of being good, the service was good too."

I love cocktails and have tried many places and this place wins hands down! If there is any place from my recent visit to Montreal that will make me come back for more, it's this place!Le Lab has the retro-cool vibe as soon as you enter. You can see a vintage cash register and some other cool stuff lying around. The place was super crowded but I think we got lucky and found a table pretty quickly. The place is very dimly lit and we did have to use our phones to read the menu. My favourite drink was 'lemon in the sky', it said in the description that it was like a dessert drink and yum it was. It wasn't super sweet but it came with vanilla cream on top and the cream was so creamy, it was the creamiest cream I've ever had, that's how creamy it was! Just writing this review is making my mouth water for the drink. There was not a single drink that any of us ordered which was below par, each drink was fantastic! Next on my list was a flaming shot that came with marshmallow. This again was superb! My final drink for the evening was another shot called 'Kiss me baby' and boy did I want to be kissed again!All of us had 3 drinks each and everyone loved their drinks. We may have sipped each others first drink but after that everyone was pretty protective of their drinks. The DJ here was fantastic and the performance by the bartenders was so much fun!

Their drink menu changes twice a year, one menu for Spring and Summer and then another for Fall/Winter etc. They have a small selection of food as well.

The fire cocktails and flare bartending is incredible. Be sure to sit in the middle of the bar for an amazing show. I had the Lab Jack, the Perfect Martini, an Old Fashioned, and the Apple fire thing (forget the name) then a Old Fashioned made with Gin and fresh lemon grass.Jerky Lab Jack - This cocktail is amazing. It is made from Jack Daniels, their own homemade BBQ bitters, and some other stuff. It is awesome to watch it being made. They mix up some liquor, set it on fire, spray on the BBQ Bitters which makes a giant flame (se my photos) then throw on ice and JD. It's finished with a piece of beef jerky. Very tasty; a smokey BBQ taste. Its good.Perfect Martini - This drink was crazy. They make a martini like you usually would except instead of ice they use a volumetric flask and dip it into liquid nitrogen to cool the cocktail. They also chill the glass with liquid nitrogen. The result is an amazing perfectly made martini - no dilution. Old Fashioned - this was a great old fashioned. First they sprayed the glass with Absinthe, then the usual sugar, orange, bitters, and Markers Mark. It was almost perfect just wish they would have used Augusto Bitters as opposed to Perrins. The Absinthe was a nice touch and added a complexity to the drink. I'm going to try that at home now.Apple Fire thing - I forget the name but this cocktail was CRAZY! They take a small pot, put in a bunch of brandy and a chopped up apple. They then cook the Apple and warm the drink with a torch, then they set it on fire and pour the flaming mixture between two pots to make a fire show. When its served to you you first pull off the glass, inhale the alcohol vapor, then eat the apple pieces finish by sipping the warm drink. This is a great winter drink. Very tasty; not to sweet or strong. Perfect. It's worth ordering just to watch them make it; it is a show on its own.Gin old Fashioned - this was my favorite drink of all. It was made with fresh Lemon grass, and gin, orange, sugar, and bitters. Really tasty and smooth. I love this drink...So please check out this bar. It is a great place. nice atmosphere, great music and vibe, not much I would change about the place. I just hope I can find something like this in San Fran."

/user_details?userid=3lUkFxUQKeMUYH7-z_kmjg,Angela P.,"Aurora, IL",5 star rating,"Love Le Lab!  We arrived in Montreal on a Sunday evening during Happy Hour, so the bar was fairly empty when we arrived, and about half full when we left.  We enjoyed some great cocktails in a dimly lit, fun, and inviting atmosphere.  The bartenders were friendly and courteous, one even stopped to take a picture for us tourists.During happy hour, a select variety of drinks are only $8/each.  My first (and only) happy hour cocktail was the Bernardino Sour, with Disarronno, Lavender, and egg white.  Happy Hour was, indeed, happy.The rest of the cocktails are typical ""cocktail bar"" prices, $10-14/drink.  The chalkboard menu was a little difficult to decipher, as we are non-French speakers, so some ingredients were a bit puzzling.  The printed menu had both English and French descriptions.  Tuesday night is Tiki Night!  Their regular cocktail menu is a comprehensive list of drinks:  rum, gin, tequila, bowls to share, and shots.  On Tuesdays, there is a menu of 5-6 different tiki-themed cocktails as well, one an homage to Hemingway.  But is there a cocktail bar these days that doesn't tip its hat to at least one writer?  The Hemingway's Secret is meant to be served punchbowl-style for a group of people, but the bartender kindly offered to make a single drink for me.  The mojitos are good here too.I raised an eyebrow at the ""Apple Crumble"" shot - with roasted marshmallows.  You'll get a shot glass concoction, they light it on fire, you toast your mini marshmallows over the drink, then you you drink it up FAST (through a straw), and proceed to cough like a dragon with bronchitis.Those shots were an interesting experience, but they scorched my throat and left me sore through the next morning.  Don't do more than ONE of these."

Highly recommend stopping here before or after dinner for some lovely drinks. There is an excellent Happy Hour menu featuring $8 cocktails. All are well-balanced. There are two scenes here: early and late. Early on it's quiet and will remind you of a turn-of-the-century parlor. Prohibition-style, of course. You'll be able to sit at the bar and enjoy the repose of a strong cocktail without the buzz of the city weighing you down. Late night, forget the repose. It's loud, it's raucous, it's crowded. Fight your way to the bar and get some shots in addition to the cocktail. Loud music, lots of noise. Both scenes have their appeal and their downsides - it all depends what suits your mood. Rest assured, you won't be disappointed by the cocktail menu. Most cocktails are priced around CAD $13-15. Wonderful variations on mint juleps. Salut!"

Everyone is already there with someone and the layout of seating makes it difficult to interact with others. The bar is very limited in its space and we were ignored by the bartenders (busy making drinks - but could've paused to greet us) so we sat down after a few minutes of aimlessly standing around.Bonus is getting their house cucumber water!"

The innovation behind each and every cocktail just simply portrays the genius mind of those who works at le LAB.  The staff is challenged to create upon one specific ingredient every month, as they commonly name ""the prescription of the month"". Whether you want to take on revisited oldies or you want to go out of the ordinary with their Jerky Lab Jack (Daniel's, Cointreau, and a slice of smoky beef jerky), Le Lab is the place to be. You're an indecisive person? Well rest assured! Go with a ""impress me"" or a ""make me a drink"" [don't forget ""please""], and let them do their magic.   Staff - Exceptional! Also known as ""Labtenders"", they are challenge-thrived creationist whose prime endeavors are to... please you and offer you the fittest cocktail for your taste buds! They are always up to a friendly conversation and are exceptionally knowledgeable. They are not barmen, rather mixologists ! Ambiance - old jazzy-acoustic music playing in the background, massive wooden bar, and the place has the reminiscence of 60-70's cocktail lounge (at least to my opinion). The music is just enough loud to be heard, beautifully tuned so that you can speak without shouting. And on Fridays and Saturdays, they display amazing flair with fired joggling bottles along with some fire breathing! Definitely something you don't want to miss."

/user_details?userid=_I6LD9kS6At7yBE8AgOOCA,Dustin W.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"What an interesting bar.  Let me begin by saying that we very much enjoyed our visit. The bar is a little all over the place, which makes this review a little hard to write.Think of Le Lab as a cutting edge cocktail bar, mixed with flair bartending, mixed with a dance club.  They obviously take cocktails very seriously, and the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable, not stuffy like some cocktail bars can be.  The service is very good and the staff are friendly and attentive.  That being said, something about the combination of the flair tricks, the DJ, the atmosphere as the night wore on, and how extremely young everyone was (patrons and bartenders), something was just a little bit off for us.When we walked in, our bartender was in the process of making a variation of a Blue Blazer.  I was pretty impressed as I've only seen this drink made once and most bars will refuse to do it.  Here at Le Lab, it is actually on the menu!  The drinks are very very good, and though I enjoyed them immensely, nothing really blew me away.  They do have a large and interesting cocktail menu with two special rotating menus, one focused on a particular spirit, and one on an ingredient.  Those menus when we visited were Canadian Club Maple and Sriracha Hot Sauce.  All the drinks were very inventive.The service was very good, and attentive.  We were offered some tastes of unfamiliar ingredients and their house made vermouth which was very cool.  While I found the flair bartending aspect of Le Lab interesting and unique at first, it got somewhat tedious by the end of our visit.  I was never sure what to say when they did a trick and then looked right at you, and I almost felt obligated to keep affirming the fact that they just threw a shaker around a bit.  While we always appreciate chatting with our bartenders, we felt that at a few times at Le Lab we could have used a bit more space.  I think this is probably because most of the bar staff seemed very young.  I love the engagement and excitement, but there also needs to be a balance of giving the patrons some privacy at times.As it got a bit later, the place got packed.  Standing is allowed in the bar area which makes it very crowded, but the bartenders handled it well.  Le Lab actually had enough bartenders working (at least 4 full stations set up) to handle the crowd.  Why is this so rare at cocktail bars?  Because of this, we didn't really feel the crowdedness at the bar unless we got up for some reason.  However, the atmosphere after a certain point was not really what we look for in a bar.  There was nothing wrong with it, it just got very young and somewhat clubby.  A DJ that started up at some point, and it was very much a party atmosphere.  When things like rounds of flaming shots started to happen, it was time for us to go.Overall, Le Lab was a positive experience and I would definitely recommend it.  Really, there was nothing that I would point out as a negative experience, just a few things that are not really our style in a bar.  In addition to this, they had a lot of really great positives happening, and they did a lot of things well that for some reason many bars seem to do poorly.  If you are really into the party atmosphere, I think you would absolutely love this bar late night.  The bartenders for sure know how to get a party started.  As for us, we would definitely go back, but we would go early, around when they open, and probably try to head out before the crowd hits."

No one is really doing mixology here in any serious way (other than Le Lab).What's to like:--Pretty decent music. The night we went there was a very capable DJ at the MacBook helm.--Cool decor.--Nice menu with good recommendations. What's not to like:--Overstressed, underserving staff. It appeared one server was servicing all the tables, so she would disappear for looooooong stretches during which one might like to order another round or get more water or a check. She was overworked and, though sweet, just too slow by virtue of the setup.--A bit TOO loud (so thankfully the music was good).--$15 each for our less exciting cocktail round. STEEP for cocktails that would cost about $10-11 U.S. and really should have here, being not so special. (Our first round at $11 and $14 was much more exciting.)"

On the weekday night I was there, the bartender I spoke with grew a little impatient with my questions about different drinks and ingredients-- I went on for a little while, but really was not overlong. This sort of peremptoriness wouldn't have occurred at the former two places, where 'mixologists' seem enthused (or at least are trained to seem so) to talk about cocktails and their histories at length. Drinks here are considerably more expensive than at the former two (around $14, compared to around $12/11), so one would expect quality and service to be on par, but this isn't quite the case. The ambiance is nice, about as pleasant. 3.5 stars. If cocktails were priced a little more reasonably, would have given it 4."

/user_details?userid=zUGNL2kbzomjtB9YMzpY6g,Len S.,"San Francisco, CA",2 star rating,"This joint has all the ingredients, all the trimming, all the possibility to be a top notch spot for imbibing however, like a good cocktail the execution and careful measurement are absolute requirements to ensure precise flavor control and a delicious final result. Le Lab has an amazing selection of bitters, home made and bought, infusions and a decent selection of booze. I found myself wondering why they needed to serve Jack Daniels when behind those bottles were far more interesting bourbons? Then it dawned on me, this place is trying to be everything to everyone instead of drawing a line in the sand and standing by only top notch ingredients. I had the cocktail a la Louisiana, an old school drink that I'm very familiar with. Too sweet and too heavy handed on the absinthe, and don't get me wrong, I like my absinthe, but I like my cocktail to have balance. My wife had a tall glass full of mint leaves and some overly sweet swill. Our compatriots Talisker came with cold water for dilution out of an ice melt absinthe drip fountain. The water was sweetened. I watched our very congenial bar tender mix drinks and realized he wasn't measuring his citrus, bitters or sweeteners, that's right, long pours and eye balling them. The only thing measured was booze. HOLY CAW! Where's the quality control?!In the end this is a great little bar if you roll in with bales of cash. Cocktails run as high as 29 each, sharable ones in the 40s. The soundtrack, a weird melange of 80s and early 90s, leaves you wanting a little Kruder and Dorfmeister, and the drinks are so sweet you think that Willy Wonka is behind the counter. Everyone there was perfectly friendly, but the construction, the measurement, the execution needs a serious rethinking."

Those things weren't negatives though, it was actually a really fun atmosphere!The most important part of a cocktail bar is the drinks, and Le Lab has those down perfectly. We made our way through four cocktails that were conceptually interesting and VERY tasty - my favorite was an absinthe drink that tasted like a mild Orange Dreamsicle.The only thing that was a slight negative was that the waitstaff was stretched a bit thin. To their credit, they were flying around the bar, but with another server or two around we would've ordered a few more drinks and stumbled home instead of walking. :)"

The bartender explained that they only do the flair thing when they have a crowd for it and since the place was rather empty there was none of that, which was great for us.

That's not the case when it comes to Le Lab--this was the perfect spot for a night of cocktails that we were happy to visit twice during our short trip!Our first time in was on a Sunday around 9 pm, and my friend and I were the only two people in the bar. The manager was friendly and gave us excellent drink suggestions, and every single one of the drinks was on point. I don't remember the names, but I had a peach cocktail that tasted extremely fresh, and my friend had a scotch-based cocktail that was hands down one of the beautiful drinks I have ever seen. We came back on our last night and were served by Tony, who has officially made my list of top 5 bartenders ever. We started the night off with a couple of drinks off the menu. I had the High Desert Princess, which was delicious. After drink #1, Tony told us he was done with menus and proceeded to make us unique drinks that were among some of the best I've ever had (high praise--I think I've been to dozens of cocktail bars in NYC, Paris, London, and Atlanta). Not only were they tasty, they were also visually stunning, adorned with all kinds of crazy things like port floats (yum) and pretty flowers.

Granted you will pay for those bar tending skills in the prices for these drinks which won't run you any cheaper than $11 each, but man are they creative and fancy! And they even have a whole list of crazy absinthe cocktails too! Whatever you do, don't ask for a drink blindly....Our friend Lindsey asked for something on fire and then a few minutes later she found herself being cheered on by the whole bar and the bartender handed her a straw to chug her flaming coffee drink which they had to switch out half way through because the fire melted it!!

The drinks are amazing and the bartenders definitely know how to put on a show for you. From juggling to setting stuff on fire, if you can get there early definitely sit at the bar and you won't want to leave. The have all types of cocktails from shots that put hair on your chest to ones that make you feel like your laying out on a tropical beach. We sat at the bar almost every night and made good friends with the bartender and she was great. I believe her name was asilex. She gave us a couple of rounds of free shots and you could tell through conversation and the way she worked that she had a great passion for her work, which is very rare to see and great too. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the one night that we sat at the table the service was pretty slow. A little understandable because the place gets very packed but I felt they could maybe limit the amount of people inside. Otherwise, the place was phenomenal and we left there every night walking sideways."

Just a relaxing but yet fun as hell atmosphere.  The 12 page menu is no joke. There are tons of cocktails to try and there's something for everyone.  Watching the bartenders mix the drinks was a show in itself.  Everything they make is top notch and delicious. They are also friendly and are awesome at concocting something off the menu. The bartenders also performed a juggling act with bottles of fire and they also spitted fire out of their mouths. It's was not overly cheesy either. Highly recommended if you're in Montreal for a girl's night out. Drinks to try: Vanilla and Raspberry Collins, Harry Goose, West Indies Colada and Haute Societe."
/user_details?userid=d8p3glnoGKABuC9X3tD7OQ,Isabelle S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"AtmosphereWhat to say about Le Lab besides that it is probably the best Montreal bar I have been in a while. I went there for the first time for my birthday a couple of days ago and I had a blast. It is just a small cozy bar with great music and great atmosphere. At one point during the night, the bartenders started putting on a show with fire which was very impressive and entertaining. You could see everyone from each table getting up to go take pictures of those two bartenders juggling with balls of fire. To top it off, the song they chose to go along with their show was thunderstruck from AC/DC. Simply awesome! If you are not too many, I would even suggest going to the bar, considering the bartenders would do tricks in front of you and entertain you constantly throughout the night. The Lab gets 5 stars for its atmosphere and entertainment.  Drinks & FoodThe drinks the Lab has are very varied, going from exceptionally original drinks to an entire page for non-alcoholic ones. It has a beverage for every type of person.  I was actually surprised to see they made Pisco Sour, which is a drink I discovered in Peru and could not find anywhere else, and even though it did not taste the same, it was still pretty good. Another shocker for me that evening was a strange looking device they used to pour drops of water on a cube of sugar for absinthe. I have to say that, from all the drinks I have tried that night (and, trust me, I have tried many) the one that caught my heart was the Jay's Basilic. If you love raspberries, it'll be your favorite as well. However, if you are looking for a show you need to order the Rouleau Parisien which is a shot they put on fire in front of you. At this point, I forget which type of alcohol it was, but I remember it was really good. The prices of the drinks are pricy but worth trying at least once (the drinks are also incredibly strong). Therefore, for drinks, I give le Lab 5 stars. ServiceThe service at le Lab is extremely slow and our waiter was not very pleasant at all however they do warn you in their menu that the service will take a while considering the complexity of their drinks. I was not very satisfied with their service but the show and the entertainment that the bartenders provided made up for it partly. Also being with a good crowd makes having bad service more bearable. I will give the service of this Montreal bar 2 stars. LocationThe location of le Lab is not really accessible without a car but being close to la Banquise on Rachel Street makes it totally worth taking a cab for. For those who know me, they know I love ending there after a good night, which I totally recommend against hangovers. The location gets 3 stars.The total amount of stars I would allocate to le Lab in general would be 5"

/user_details?userid=CJmtS1Uk1KSsY2MWol_E7g,Asuka N.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Although we had a bit of trouble finding Le Lab (thanks to none of us having international phone plans, a cabbie who apparently was unfamiliar with Montreal's geography, despite telling us everything about where the gangs are; and the address being listed as 351 on some websites), we finally made it with a couple hours to spare before closing time. It's a dimly lit area that makes it feel like a speakeasy, but with pop music blaring and a much louder vibe than you'd find at a quiet bar. We sat at a table that could fit our party that was closer to the entrance, and our waitress was good about coming over and taking our (rather frequent) drinks orders and being a good sport about it despite us being English speakers.As for the drinks themselves, they're definitely a bit on the pricey side (everything seemed to be in the $12-15 range, which is basically NYC prices), but they were pretty good overall. The Jerky Lab Jack is pretty much a must-try, as it's a house specialty. I'm not a huge fan of whiskey on the rocks (which is pretty much what this looks like), but it turned out quite well - the BBQ bitters add a hint of spiced flavor that Jack on its own doesn't have, and the beef jerky itself (which is good - well-flavored, and not too chewy, with the right amount of toughness) helps to temper the edge on the drink. Jay's Basilic also turns out quite well; the basil serves more to provide an herbal whiff as you sip on the drink, which is heavily based on the raspberry but delicious without being overly fruity. The Tiger Thai Collins is also really good - the chili adds a dash of spice, but aside from that, it has a very bubbly and refreshing taste to it.In all, the drinks here are all pretty well-done. I do also like that there is a small beer selection, in case you'd like to switch it up. This is a very chilled-out bar and a great place to sample interesting drinks and have a great time. It's not a dance bar, so don't come here expecting to rock your moves out; it's pretty much a speakeasy but at regular bar volumes."
/user_details?userid=nBotK5rAhsUCkBKhzShKXA,Melis B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Really great bar. Favorite was the Peat Martini super smooth and also the tonic they use for their gin and tonics is incredible. They make the syrup themselves it has spices and herbs infused in it with orange and cloves hands down incredible. Waitress was super friendly and at tentative even though it was a Saturday night and super packed. Really fun spot for a group of friends not a chill spot more like hangout cocktail hour. The drink menu is extensive and what's even more impressive is how's it's divided up very unpretentious and a good time...
/user_details?userid=QfRm0TaEBwDweuhDBqyuRA,Jennifer M.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,Speakeasy vibe to it. The bartenders are pure genius with the cocktails they have created. The show that goes into making each one is so unique. You get more than just a drink when you order with them. This place would make a killing in New York City.

I've never see such a variety of booze and mixing concoctions, the cocktail list is EXTENSIVE, expect to ask the bartenders (who were super friendly) for recommendations.  We happened to stroll in during happy hour (which goes until 8PM and a selection of drinks were $8 vs the usual $14+). My husband and I both had 2 of the La Citadelle - awesome and spicy!  I saw someone get the jack daniel's beef jerky drink that looked amazing and involved fire. Very very cool spot, def. a must visit.  We were raving about the cocktails the whole weekend.  No food though (unless you count the beef jerky)."

And the bartenders are fun to watch as they make concoctions. I saw flames, juggling of bottles and precision.

/user_details?userid=EUtFaImcQQq5YDCRL1dHHw,Adam M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"You should know about Le Lab, if you like anything at all.The building is a bit anonymous, located at the corner of Rachel and De Lanaudière. My friends and I stumbled in some time ago, without prior knowledge of the bar, because going to bed at 1:00 AM on a Wednesday is for conformists, apparently.First time patrons will most likely be impressed by the tasteful decoration and ergonomic planning of the bar. The tables, high and not one of them wobbly, are dispersed to provide ample elbow room. Behind the bar proper, customers are invited to look at a truly staggering array of liquors and spirits, most of them SAQ rarities or straight up discoveries.This is all good and well, but it's only a preview of Le Lab's true strength: its endless supply of original mixed drinks. The bar's menu is updated every six months with a new batch of creations, and none of them taste like anything you've ever had.This might be a bit much for more casual drinkers, and the staff (Labtenders!) is always more than happy to guide your choice according to your preferences and drinking history. Want a drink that bites back? Here's a Margarita Enchilada, a tequila and tabasco potion so strong it almost fights your mouth. Would you prefer something sweet enough to pass for dessert in most restaurants? Here's the Sortilège, with enough maple and orange flavours to make its whiskey base a mere afterthought. There is truly something for everyone, as much as dislike clichés. In spite of all this alcoholic exuberance, you will find no drunks at Le Lab. Drinks start at 10$ each... during Happy Hour. Most cocktails will cost you around 13-15$ dollars, depending on tips. This strongly curbs the drunkard scale in favor of social sippers and foodies looking to taste something new. This price range, however, makes it a poor choice for a regular hangout.Still, if blowing your entire booze budget on two drinks is turn-off, I invite you to muscle through an evening of relative sobriety to experience the Lab firsthand.  There's no such thing as a fast order there; Labtenders WILL take the time to flair the crap out of your drink. The showmanship is the best I've seen in the city and when you see the entire bar set on fire to light up five shooters, you will want to buy something expensive from these people, and tip them well.In conclusion, even if the establishment tends to be somewhat exclusive because of the price of admission, you would do well to stop by at the first opportunity and treat yourself to one of the most serious, original and entertaining evenings in Montreal. Le Lab is right for you, whoever you are."

The menu is as extensive as it is expensive!  Mixed drinks average at around 13$, and go as high as 28$!  I will warn you though, not only are they worth is, but once you have one, you'll want to try them all.  The bar itself is beautiful; the doors are draped in red curtains, the bar is the most fully stocked one I've ever seen, the TV flashes anti-prohibition ads and the brick walls just seal the deal.  The blackboard above the bar features daily specials, which are worth trying.  The bar and wait staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  There's no pretension at all.   The waiters and waitresses are more than happy to answer questions about drinks.  The bar staff practice flair bar tending; depending on when you go, you'll probably see some bottle juggling, spice smashing or maybe even a bit of a fire show!  I got to see all three.  This is easily my new favorite bar in Montreal.  I'm so glad I found this place!"

Jessy, our bartender. She was super helpful, sweet and had the kind of all over the place (in a good way) kind of personality that I love. She let my boyfriend and I taste and smell different ingredients and drinks and just made their pricier cocktails worth every penny.  She was also able to take what I liked and with a couple more questions pin down a drink and make it for me for my tasting.
