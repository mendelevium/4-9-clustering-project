She thought l might enjoy it, and she was right. We were the only ones there, and l ended up with the three meats (chicken, lamb and beef) in Table D'hôte.The good: Very nice concept. Great broth. Good Table D'hôte. Very friendly service, with a constant smile. Beautiful presentation. Soft drinks served in glass bottles. Beef terrific! Bathrooms clean. Food fresh. Veggies terrific!The bad: Plates of meat are prepared in advance as my chicken was still partially frozen, and shred in pieces when l took it off my original plate. Place could be very busy on a weekend. Arrived at 4:55pm, told us to wait outside 5 minutes (even though the doors were unlocked). Restaurant very cold if you are the first ones there. Careful, it will be messy!This place is a nice discovery and a wonderful experience. We will surely go back!"
/user_details?userid=nMjQkTbqFMINyuErVqqebA,Wd S.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Not bad! I like the ambiance and I think they are real Japanese. I was quite surprised since let's be honest most Asian restaurants are owned by Chinese.P.S. The food looks pretty healthy and fresh.
/user_details?userid=iqQBsjqOF9xgIAbsZ2sAZA,David M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I love saying the word Shabu Shabu, so here goes:the place is a quiet respite from most of the other Chinatown restos. Most people are seated at the counter and we basically cook our own food in the broth.I'm not an expert, but i get the impression this food is very healthy, lots of vegetables and not too much meat. It's a fun experience but the traditional broth i chose lacked flavor and i would recommend to talk to the waiter and ask for suggestions.I have been to a Mongolian hot pot in the same area and that one was too spicy.I would not mind going back and trying more, the prices are more than fair considering the effort put into this setup"
/user_details?userid=bodsG6iX9Vh1BAyl-JkpcQ,Dee K.,"Centreville, VA",4 star rating,"Let me start by saying the service was great, friendly and warm. We were here today to celebrate a family members milestone birthday. We reserved a table of 11 right Infront of the lovely mural of my Fuji they had; great for family party. The vegetables meats and noodles were clean and very nicely presented. We had almost all the broths and the spicy was the most delicious. The tomato broth was our least favorite. Our only gripe was that 3 out of the 11 received our food more than half way when the other people finished. A little disappointing especially since it was for a milestone birthday and I flew in from the states for it, making this reservation more than a more than a month in advance. Regardless, our waitress was super sweet and the food was fresh quality and delicious."

My first time having Shabu Shabu and I wanted give it a try as I've had hot pot before. For the vegetarian option it was pretty affordable at $15 but I would have loved to have a little bit more tofu or rice. Everyone who orders meat or seafood gets the same amount of vegetables, plus their meat. I got 3 pieces of soft tofu and 2 small pieces of frozen tofu. I tried one of the Japanese sodas, the black current flavor and it was really delicious. I never drink soda but it was nice to try and I'd probably try it again. Overall it's a really nice restaurant, clean, the service was good and it seemed like a good value."

I had the brunch set and it comes with rice, salad, juice and dessert! I personally think the portion is the right size for me because I always like to add the bowl of rice into the pot to make it into congee in the end. The broth(I had daishi essence) was really good and the ingredients were fresh which made the congee amazing!"

I've had shabu shabu once before, in Tokyo, but this was a first time for my husband and kids. We got there around 1:30 to miss the lunch crowd and there were only a few other people there. Waitress spent some time explaining the process and brought my son a fork when she noticed he was struggling with chopsticks. Spicy broth was fanatic, very flavourful. Chicken das so good. Definitely give this place a try!"

/user_details?userid=NkMOVXd9lb9V57tLaQ4vNQ,An T.,"Rawdon, Canada",5 star rating,"I believe this is the only restaurant in Montreal that serves japanese shabu shabu. They have different choices of broth (traditionnal, dashi, tomato, sukiyaki, chicken & spicy) and different combos (meat, seafood or vegetarian). Each combo comes with veggies & noodles. I usually get the nagano pork combo or the premium beef combo. Meat is super tender, broth very flavourful (especially the sukiyaki & spicy) and veggies always fresh. I usually come here for dinner but they are also open for lunch (i believe it's cheaper at that time of the day but portion may be smaller) Definitely recommend if you're looking for a delicious japanese shabu-shabu experience."

You get a good yummy portion for a decent price. I came back lately and I have to say that it feels different, of course. I was surprised to find corn and tomato in the vegs plate or the spinach instead of the wakame, but I think it's still worth going back!The waitresses are friendly and will answer your questions the best they can. The place kept its big 'U' table - I like this feature of the restaurant :)"
/user_details?userid=ZRYqMyXtb-kmHIhDrRdI0Q,A. U.,"Cote-Saint-Luc, Canada",5 star rating,"A regular haunt of ours for special date nights and celebrations. The perfect winter meal, although you come home smelling a bit like soup. We just tried the new menu--outstanding! Try the new Sukiyaki broth--it was so flavorful and really comforting. I kept making yummy noises with every spoonful until my husband had to try it. They serve it with a raw egg as an additional  dipping sauce, which isn't my thing, so I just cooked the egg in the broth the further enhance the soup (sort of like egg drop soup, which I guess is not Japanese, but hey.) Still thinking about it and wondering when I can go again.New side dishes to dunk in as well. We had the Korean rice cakes and the fish balls. I would order more fish balls next time, if possible. And new noodle choices and meat options as well. The long awaited chicken was okay, but the lamb and beef were the star proteins. Next time I'll order the two different cuts of beef (which is a new option) and the lamb.Be aware that you get less broth than before, but who can finish it, anyway? Also you do get charged $1.00 for ordering extra rice, when it used to be free. The new chocolate ice cream covered in rice cake was yummy, but too frozen, so the ice cream was a bit hard and not as creamy as I would have liked.Overall, the new changes were great and the whole experience was a ton of fun, as usual. Arigato, Chef Kagayaki! We'll be back!"

Japanese comfort food par excellence! I order the B combo of lamb. The soup was light and comforting on a rainy and cold night! What i like about this place is the they give you a nice presented place of veggi will a bit of everything (carrot,daikon, broccoli, spinach, cabbage, seaweed, mushroom, tofu, bok choy, udon). The house sauce is so yummy with rice will definitively come back during the winter time"

But if you are a regular customer, you can ask for the usual menu. We've been there quite a few times and there has been a rise of price in the two-three years.

You're also given a bowl of rice on the side. You ""cook"" the thinly sliced meat in your broth   a la fondue style along with the veggies.Everything is super fresh and super healthy.

But   when we ask him why some new ones have gotten the table when it was available and he never called us. here's his response, ""I said I'll call you when it's available, it's not available now.""  Well, I guess if you are  reading this review, you know now why the 1star."

The food was just as good as any other hot pot place I have visited.The staff here, however, are not very friendly, nor helpful. Our waitress asked us to order almost as soon as we sat down. We told her we needed to look at the menu and she didn't even answer- she just walked away. At the end of our meal, after receiving the bill, we put the credit card down and waited... and waited... about 20 minutes. In hind sight, we could have asked or flagged down the waitress but it seemed she was avoiding us all together. We finally saw others pay at the little stand and got up to pay also, after wasting time just sitting there and no one telling us to go pay at the stand. SO THERE'S A GOOD TIP!Atmosphere: It was kind of creepy how quiet the place was. There were about 5 other patrons, but no one talked and if they did, it was a whisper. We were here on a Saturday afternoon (around 5pm) so it was just unusual.The food was a bit pricey, but that's to be expected with hot pot. Nothing new there."

/user_details?userid=sFJjEc7ytSUV28Y7PpdMjQ,Mathieu B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I needed to add this business to this website for 2 reasons: 1, it's awesome and authentical.2: My friend believes restomontreal.ca is a better restaurant review website than Yelp. So as I prefer Yelp and wanted to proove him wrong, I needed to add that business.One of the issue I got with Japanese cuisine in Montreal it's that it's mostly marginalize in Sushi and Crazy Chef mumbling funny stuff and doing a flame while cooking your shrimps. I went to 2 great Japanese restaurant in my life and one of them is Mikado and the other one is Hanashima. Mikado would be more in the Modern New Japanese cuisine style with some really talented chef and Hanashima would be more into the Traditional Japanese Cuisine. Now, I'm not an expert, but my friend is really into Japanese stuff and knows more about it. From what I understand, Traditional Japanese cuisine focuses on the taste and quality of the food. The menu is quite simple. The restaurant is welcoming and it kind of feel like a bar with the exception that it's japanese fondue restaurant!You have 3 choices of broth. Chicken, Neutral (algae) and Spicy (which I was told is really spicy). Then you choose your sides. Vegetarian will be happy to find some great vegetable and meat lover will be happy to find their meat too. It's one of the most healthy meal you can have: Boiled in a great broth, with sides of rice and soya sauce and peanut sauce, this meal is so simple, yet so good and CHEAP, that it's worth a 5Stars.Alcool + Shrimps + Meat plates and Veggie plates, + Chicken Broth with Tip cost me 40-45$.

It was kind of hard to find the place because it was upstairs, It took me a while to find it especially because It was my first time in Montreal. I came in and it was fairly slow, but I did see there were multiple reserved signs around me. I ordered the beef.Their ponzu sauce tasted a little diffferent, I can't seem to put my finger on it, there was something lipstickey about it, if that makes sense. The beef was a little too thick and didn't have the ""melt in your mouth"" aspect that I'm used to.  The service was decent, and the server was somewhat friendly. What was also pretty nice, was that there was dessert that came with the meal. pretty much-- this place didn't exactly wow me, nor did it completely disappoint me. ""EHH"""

I also love the counter environment.  Price wise I don't think it was too bad.  All I know is after we were done eating I was in a food coma.  I kind of remember leaving and walking, a lot.  After the food had settled, maybe an hour or two later, I was good to go.  Shabu Shabu places tend to run the same lines in regards to menu items.  Where they differ is service and decor.  Hanashima, has both my friends.  Next time I'm in Montreal I will make the trip back in."
/user_details?userid=z5YKMFtISMlMMPoBy4s9Fw,Jeff C.,"Seattle, WA",2 star rating,"Hard to find if you are not looking at the numbers on the buildings for the address and then still hard to find. A bit stark/cold feeling atmosphere. I'm not sure why all the high ratings except if maybe when people eat in a novel way they lose sight of what they are actually getting for their money. Service was pleasant and reasonably attentive. The veggie plate looks impressive the way they arrange about $0.75 cost worth of veggies. And for $15 to $20 total you get maybe 2 ounces of meat but it's cut so thin it looks like a decent portion. Only one ponzu dipping sauce but that might be what's traditional I'm no shabu expert. So you'll just have to fill up on cabbage, broth and rice! I would have to spend about $30 here to get the protein I'd get at a $9 teriyaki joint. Still, it Is unique to cook your own food. But in my opinion this place is a very poor value for the amount of protein you get.  Borderline scammish .   I'd rather hit Pho Bac 97 for half the price and just as if not more meat, more filling and the broth actually tastes rich. Only difference is they dump your meat in for you right before they serve it. But if you want to pay double to have a burner in front of you so you can dump your own meat in, be my guest. Or their sucker rather.You might see other reviews saying something to the effect of ""the experience was fun""  but to me dropping $25 and being hungry 20 minutes later isn't fun."

The experience is definitely fun, but the food is just okay. I had the spicy broth because most people claim that the traditional and chicken broths are too bland (definitely agree.. Fiance's chicken broth tasted like nothing). We both had the beef and had to order a side order of beef on top of that as well as two sides of mushroom. This was because the restaurant wouldn't accommodate our request of switching out the rice and noodles for salad or extra veggies.. So it was not very filling. Overall, a cool experience, but won't be returning. 3 stars for cleanliness, price, and concept. If you want food that tastes great, this is not the place for you..."
/user_details?userid=AhM5oL_rv0FN7hkViTpc8g,Vu T.,"West Hills, Los Angeles, CA",2 star rating,"This is one of the very few places that serves Shabu Shabu in Montreal. As much as I anticipated to have some nice Japanese hot pot in a still cold March, this place is not what I have expected it to be. It was on a Sunday night when I went to dine in this restaurant, with around only 6 people currently eating around the round table of hot pots, excluding me and my friend. As it turned out to be, selections were very limited as there were only 3 flavors for the broth, and only two dipping sauces (soy sauce and peanut butter sauce). The dipping sauces were underwhelming as it did not mesh with the veggies/meat fairly well. I ordered the spicy broth as people stated that it's more flavorful while my friend ordered the chicken broth. I find that the spicy broth was also bland along with the chicken broth....the broth only had pepper powder mixed so it tasted similar to that. On top of the burn to such a delicate Japanese style meal, service was VERY slow; it took them over 20 minutes to bring a cold pot of broth to us, and we had to wait an extra 5 minutes for it to be heated. The meat slices were way too thin for me to enjoy such delicacy either.If this place wants a second chance, I would be anticipating for a variety of broth and dipping sauces and faster service considering that there were only 6 people dining and it took them that long to give me the meal.+1 star because we got mango ice cream for free."

/user_details?userid=2LptcvhkcFyNXT_NZDPpaQ,Luca M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Where I come from, while having a shabu shabu you might as well drop your wallet into the pot so expensive is the experience.Hanashima hits the spot on all fronts. Firstly, it is a very informal setting and elegantly minimalistic. High stools, a long counter and an individual burner for each guest are really all it takes for shabu shabu, no bells and whistles added.Secondly, it is incredibly well-priced and they make a perceptible effort to keep their prices down. In the two and more years I've been a patron, the prices haven't changed by a digit.Recession bit them too, so today instead of ice cream PLUS iced coffee for dessert, you get one or the other. Additionally, if before prices included tax, today the tax is extra. It is still a bargain.Thirdly, the service is efficient, polite, cheerful and fast. I would go to Hanashima just to have the waitress smile at me.Fourthly, the menu is simple but the meal is filling and involves a variety of courses. The extra sides you can order make the customisations almost endless.Even ethnic food sceptics appreciate the straightforwardness of Hanashima's approach and the sheer quality of their food. I've seen it happen first-hand.Other reviewers mentioned another website that lists Hanashima (restomontreal). After reading the reviews on Yelp, heading over there for the vouchers can actually offset the sales taxes (10%). (I hope this doesn't breach Yelp's terms).Hanashima is a spot to keep in your books due to its perfection and its location. In the heart of Chinatown, it is close to great Chinese bakeries where you can get an extra dessert and bubble tea.I also recommend Hanashima for a cheap and no-strings-attached date, or for post-important-introductions dinners. The counter seating doesn't require guests to stare at each other for the meal's duration, the crowd, decor and food provide great converation starters and the gentle broth's bubbling fills in the necessary moments of silence.A relaxed meal in an unusual setting without the pressure of it being too unusual. Vegetarians are catered for with the huge veggie combo, meat-eaters are spoilt for choice, seafood lovers will delight in the seafood combo and everyone will have a great time at an excellent price.Get the regular portions, splurge because here you can!Reserve whenever you go: I saw it fill up pretty fast on both weekday (sometimes) and weekend nights (always)."

Everyone have their own individual hot pot so no worries of losing your piece of food and for it getting it picked by someone else ;)  They serve the hotpot with a seaweed salad and a marinated cucumber at the beginning.  They also include a soya sauce as well as very yummy sesame sauce. You can choose either a vegetable, a meat or a seafood platter.  The two latter includes a large vegetable platter with interesting choices such as chinese radishes, udon noodles, bok choi, several types of mushrooms, etc.  If you choose the vegetable option, you will only have a larger vegetable platter than others.  You are also allowed two bowls of rice (most people dont know it!) There is a certain order in which you should add your ingredient in order to optimize your experience and not find yourself with overcooked or undercooked items.  As for the broth, I strongly recommend the spicy one since I find the others quite bland.  They also have a seasoning wheel you can ask where you can add green onions, chili powder or radish puree. Finally, a dessert is included!Affordable, healthy an fun way to enjoy a meal between friends :)"

I was hoping Hanashima would change my idea that good hot pot in Montreal is really not possible. Honestly, this place doesn't do it for me. I came for the first time with my boyfriend awhile back and we ordered I believe the regular broth with just vegetables, no meat.  The broth was flavorless and bland, and the vegetables were very little on a rectangular plate. It was very expensive for what was given. I think it was an extra 5 or 6 dollars for more vegetables...which is strange because vegetables shouldn't be that expensive. The only decent dish we ordered was the salad, but even that was given in such a small portion. I prefer Mongolian in terms of broth/soup base. They have more flavor and taste. Service was ok, but food did not live up to my standards."

I had the vegetable plate and added some shrimp. The presentation of the food was great, the spicy broth was not too spicy, but had some flavor. I wish they gave us a little more instruction on the cooking order of the food, but we figured it out. The quality of the vegetables and the shrimp was great. I saw other plates with beef and pork and they all looked like good sized portions. I would go back again when in Montreal."
