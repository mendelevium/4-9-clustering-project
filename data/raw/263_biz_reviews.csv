First, the free spread of warm baguette, seasoned butter, marinated olives, and balsamic vinegar\EVOO is a nice touch. The grilled octopus was perfectly charred, mixed with a nice contrast seasoning and beans.For my main I ordered the halibut. I'm always cautious thinking in the back of my mind that the portion size will be dinky. Well that fear subsided when the fish came out pretty big with a heathy bed of veggies. The halibut was cooked really well with an crispy exterior yet moist and flaky inside. I normally don't comment on the veggies but this dish stood out. The side included eggplant, bok Choy (with a refreshing balsamic reduction) has and squash grilled, potatoes roasted, and broccoli steamed - three ways of cooking!The service is attentive as well. Overall a very surprising treat. Would try again if I'm in the area."

You know what...this is a pretty good restaurant.We have gone for two meals so far and have been treated quite well. The food has been healthy and consistent. A tad saltier than I like, but that is just me.I have loved the grilled vegetables, the chicken croquettes, the grilled octopus and the foie gras. The margherita pizza was quite qood, especially the next morning. I like the service. Both gentlemen have done well to ensure there are no child disasters, but that we have a nice experience, too, as adults. The ""house"" wines are good and go well with the food for a reasonable price."
