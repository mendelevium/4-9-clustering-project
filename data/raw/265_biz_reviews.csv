/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It will probably seem like I'm gushing about this eating experience, but that's because I am. Since it was one of the more memorable meals I've had in quite some time. Let's face it, take-out may be convenient, but it's no replacement for superb service or a beginning to end meal that makes you feel like a VIP. On that note, I want to mention Luc was a highlight of the evening and oversaw that every detail was attended to. To the point where it even surprised me. He is experienced and polished (but not in the stuffy way).Perhaps, what made this meal even more memorable was for its simplicity. It was virtually bread, a main, wine and an after dinner sip. To be more specific the bread was an incredibly fresh, warm and fluffy focaccia with traditional olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping purposes.The main, the focal point of the meal, was a daily special of trout with crispy skin (they should trademark this method) stacked on top of a saffron risotto base; with al dente vegetables like zuchinni and eggplant. To sum up the most delectable of plates - it was a trifecta of excellence: taste, quality and value. Usually, a stack is just a fancy way of plating, but in this case it somehow enhanced the dish. Otherwise, it was just so darn tasty, I'm making more of a big deal of the plating, to make sure the exemplary nature of the dish comes through in this review. Finally, a well paired wine and an after dinner sip to round things off.Perhaps, it would have been easier to simply say the meal was an all around five or better yet, I would like to eat there everyday; if I could."

This is my second visit to Jacopo; previously, I enjoyed a delicious and beautiful brunch. Tonight, Let's say it was a memorable evening. Outside, we were freezing, but the luminous decors outside give you a slight warmth in your heart, then in the restaurant, full of people, the vibrancy is all over. Then our waiter Benjamin is the most friendly, animated person I have encountered. Initially, I wasn't sure he was annoying or clever, but honestly we fell in love with him. He is very knowledgeable  about everything, and you can get into an easy conversation about any topics. He is so infectious, the couple beside us became part of our conversation. For happening gourmand, we had the table d'hôte menu. I had a honey old fashioned cocktail (A+, excellent) followed by a cauliflower salad (A+, perfectly flavored), then squash risotto with blue cheese (A-, creamy but little bitter) and apple pie with caramel and ice cream (C, too sweet). All this 29$ plus 10$ for the cocktail. Perfect deal! The restaurant itself is beautiful but the meat rack in the glass window is slightly disturbing. Service, food, and ambiance are excellent. Recommended!!!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Came here for happening gourmand during brunch time. I tried the italian eggs benedict and a donut duo with custard. The donuts were delicious. They were warm and covered  with caramel with a chocolate middle. The custard was very creamy. The eggs benedict were ok. The portion was pretty small and it was kind of dry. The service was great and the inside is nicely decorated.
/user_details?userid=7PTwhPEM7VWclYIS_1dSiw,Jéssica C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This Old Port elegant yet not pretencious place was excellent! With the dim lights and modern, cozy vibes, it's perfect for a date night.The service was great, the staff is really friendly and warm. They are really knowledgeable and patient, our waiter really took the time to explain us the dishes, give recommendations and helped us pick the right wine for the meal, which we loved.The food was also amazing, we got the tuna carpaccio, which was really tasty, the osso buco and the tiramisu for dessert.The carpaccio was delicious, really well seasoned, and the osso buco would just melt in your mouth. The pole ta that comes in the osso buco was one of the best I've ever had! They have a different take on this osso buco, the sauce sort of reminded me of ""parmeggiana"". Different from others I've had, but really delicious! The tiramisu was also amazing, very light and not too sweet.Definitely recommend!"
/user_details?userid=vj-gGhmf8zw4FJiJ4oWGjQ,Beantpreet K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Their burrata is my favourite! And their bread is really good. I ordered gnocchi and it was pretty good. Our server was super helpful and nice!
/user_details?userid=0C_kTzETOV_1m-fSeYGuJQ,Vivian S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,Prices are very standard for Old Montreal bit I'm happy to report the food is absolutely delicious.The mortadella is delicious and perfectly slices thin..the burrata is amazingly simple and perfect.  Extra creamy and just lovely...only wish it wasn't served so chilled..but I'm guessing it needs to be?Anyways the service is top notch and the location could be more in the heart of things.
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a fairly new restaurant that opened a little over 3 weeks ago in the main heart of Old Montreal, the Place Jaques Cartier Square! Closeby  Maggie Oakes. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable of the menu to give suggestions. I loved the outdoor terrace that truly captures Montreal's heart and soul. Sip on some wine and dine while you see and hear street performers in the square.For the menu, we opted to try a couple of items. For 22$ you can pick from a variety of cheese and charcuterie, Add 3$+ and try their truffle honey (highly recommended). I thought for the price and considering the location of the restaurant, you get a good bargain for your food. (If it weren't Old Montreal, they could be a bit more generous with the cheese portions). For the main course: we tried two of the handmade pastas-the squid ink seafood pasta (3/5) and the squash stuffed ravioli (5/5). The first I found a tad salty, I really enjoyed the ravioli. The prices for the items are reasonable as well, around the 15-18$ range. Dishes are good to share. The cocktails are also good.Overall, a lovely space- I think I found my go to of Old Montreal. Second to Perche as my favorite rooftop in the area of course!"

We all ordered their bomboloni (Italian donut). It was delicious, fluffy and drizzled with caramel. Most of us took the Italian Benedict - the prosciutto was so crispy! I have never had it like that and was pleasantly surprised. Everything was so tasty. The potatoes literally melted in your mouth. The only thing that I was disappointed with was their latte. Don't get me wrong it was good but I was expecting it to be bigger. It came in a regular coffee sized  cup. I've always had my lattes in big cups. I finished it halfway through my brunch."
/user_details?userid=HzQs-j_6B1D-MvvRmm9KPQ,Dan Z.,"Hudson, Canada",4 star rating,"Feb 15, 2020I received a promotion from American Express for a special valentine dinner at Jacopo for $250 taxes and tip included.  So I tried it.It's a nice restaurant in a very touristy part of Old Montreal, Place Jacques Cartier.  However, we went in Feb when there are very few tourists.  Like everything in Old Montreal, parking is an issue but I think Jacopo has valet parking.  I found parking nearby, illegally, cause it was a for permit only, so I didn't use the velvet service.The service was excellent. Our waitress, Marilou, was excellent.  Very friendly and had great recommendations.  She was very friendly and very considerate.  We didn't feel rushed at all.The following is the meal we had for 2 people:AntipastiMerluzzo carpaccio1. Smoked black cod carpaccio, roasted red pepper, marinated eggplant, lemon & honey2.Artichoke stuffed with sausage, rapini & taleggioSecondi Vitelli e polpoTo share Grilled octopus and grilled veal chop with sautéed mushrooms and truffle mashed potatoesDolciPanacotta con vino rossoRed wine panna cotta with candied baconWe started the meal with a really good Prosecco included in the package.  It wasn't part of the regular Jacopo Valentine menu.  All the other food was.  The food was excellent.  The portions were a little on the small side.  We added an order of fried calamari and had had 1 glass of red wine.  This added about $65 ( tax and tip included) to the all included $250.  At the end of the meal, we were give a really nice bouquet of flowers.  All in all, this was a really nice evening. The food was really good.  The artichoke was hard to eat but the stuffing was really good.  The cod carpaccio was very good.  The second part was extremely flavourable.  The veal chop was cooked to perfection.  The octopus was delicious.  The mash potatoes were just so tasty, it's crazy.  Lastly, the dessert was good but seemed a little overshadowed by the rest of the meal.For $315, the price is a little high.  The portions are on the small side but the quality is absolutely there. But, the price is a sore spot.  Too bad because it's really a good meal.  For the same price, I've been to other excellent restaurants that offer more at the same quality or more."
/user_details?userid=pLloOwQ2MNgjF9VwkUxLoQ,Kathryn B.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,Had lunch on the outside deck of Jacopo and it was absolutely wonderful. The service and food were both great. We got the pre-fix lunch menu which was an amazing deal for only $22. We both got the salad starter which was delicious. For our main lunch my boyfriend got the Orecchiette with sausage and I got Gnocchi. They were both super yummy. For dessert the pre-fix meal comes with biscotti with chocolate chips and marshmallows. I told them I had a nut allergy and they provided a separate dessert which was Panna cotta. Absolutely so good and such great attention to those will allergies.Would definitely come back!
/user_details?userid=oPZbf9FnG3BNRsSk2JhUlQ,Jenn C.,"Salem, NH",4 star rating,"My husband and I ate here for dinner twice during our annual trip to Montreal this year, and we were pleasantly surprised with this new restaurant! Between our two visits, we ordered the charcuterie board (adding-on the truffle honey is HIGHLY recommended!), Cacio e Pepe, Spaghetti Carbonara (pictured), Orecchiette con Rapini e Salsiccia (pictured), Risotto ai funghi (pictured), and Tiramisu (pictured). Every dish was well-seasoned and perfectly prepared, though our favorites hands-down were the Spaghetti Carbonara and Orecchiette con Rapini e Salsiccia. The food service was a little slow, but the servers were friendly and the food was definitely worth the wait!"
/user_details?userid=W90xlJgPOqkwWPN1KORPOw,Andrew C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The waiter and bartender were so attentive and treated us (and I noticed they treat other guests too) like VIPs.  The restaurant decor is pretty romantic too. Perfect place for a date night. It has Old Montreal charm yet modern and stylish. We had few pretty good appetizers and I highly recommend the delicious Ravioli di Zucca for main course for guests who feel like having vegetarian meal. You know the saying: ""People may not remember exactly what you did, or what you said, but they will always remember how you made them feel."" In my case, I don't remember exactly what I ate at Jacopo aside from the Ravioli main course, but I will always remember the WOW experience I had after leaving the restaurant.  5 Stars!"

/user_details?userid=rB47A0-KXwd0k3O1Xor7SA,Owen H.,"Pasadena, CA",4 star rating,"I had a reservation here, and requested to sit outside but that would have been 20 more minutes.  Oh well, we got inside and it was beautiful and not too loud.  We ordered the cacio e pepe and gnocchi.  We thought the gnocchi came with burrata, but it did not.  It would have been $18 more.  Despite the small disappointments we had a wonderful meal and the staff were excellent."

Meghan was an absolute dream and gave us suggestions on not only drinks but also places to go while we're in town and even helped us get on a guest list for a club by us! We stayed for a good hour or two and never felt rushed or pressured in any way at all.Besides the (amazing) service, the cocktails were delicious as was the rose sangria. If you're strolling old town and would like a place to grab a drink outside, this is a great spot."
/user_details?userid=nWpC7AVncdf8XthF77mtQw,Nhu-Bang N.,"Dusseldorf, Germany",5 star rating,"Absolutely great experience. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff which made us feel ""at home"". Hands down the best home made pasta (authentic Italian) I had in Canada so far. Some North Americans might not like it, due to their pasta being served al dente"
/user_details?userid=GnJ2w63izmrICmt1wNCGOA,Laurence V.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"Pretty much your typical old port restaurant with an outdoor terrace, perfect for the summer! Service was average, food was good but the portions are not filling, and the price was okay. Not the most authentic Italian restaurant, but definitely traditional with a modern ambience. There are other items on the menu I would want to try so I would still come back, but for lunch most likely because that seems more worth it. 3.5/5 star!"
/user_details?userid=vHeE-J3qSMl1tZfAILOgww,Ashley L.,"Longueuil, Canada",3 star rating,"I was really excited to try this place unfortunately I feel like it fell short for the standards of great Italian food we have in Montreal. We started with the happy hour spritz pitcher for 35$ and a choice charcuterie plate. The charcuterie was pretty basic, nothing out of the ordinary. The spritz pitcher was good except every time the waiter poured me a glass I just got more and more ice with very little spritz. I got the bruschetta because it's August in Quebec and tomato season is upon us! The tomatoes were not ripe (white tomatoes should be a crime) and tasted like the Fontaine Santé premade one you can get at the grocery store. What a let down! I had the pasta with speck in a light cream sauce. It was good. Basic. Passable. My husband has the orrechietti with sausage and rapini. It was tasty and spicy although I found the rapini too bitter (while rapini is always bitter I've had better). The service was good, the restaurant itself is beautiful (although I could do without the fake wood oven and charcuterie fridge) and they seem to accommodate groups well. It's unfortunate that this is another tourist place that reminded me of why I generally stay away from old Montreal."

Although simple, it was the best bruschetta I've ever had and the pasta was phenomenal."

The gnocchi with burrata was really good, as well as the grilled calamari. Only downgrade would be the entertainment outside (no fault of the restaurant), which was very distracting, so maybe sit inside if they're performing."
