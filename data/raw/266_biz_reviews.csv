/user_details?userid=EbzIOck2feoZrGxRjyPDyw,Vichet O.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"I'd been here before 2 years ago and forgotten the restaurant name and location, but somehow, by providence, I was staying down the street last week and saw that excellent poutinerie that haunted my dreams since my last stay in Montreal.The pizza is gourmet style thin crust, flash baked for that singed, but still bready/spongy texture. Many of their gourmet pies are loaded with tasty haute-cuisine toppings, like the Angry Goat (arugula, balsamic reduction, goat cheese). Others are loaded with tasty and decidedly middle-American sensibilities, like the one with mac and cheese and smoked meat (I mean, the smoked meat is a Quebec thing, but deciding to put it on pizza is a middle-America thing). All of them are great as far as I've tried, because all of the individual parts of the pizza are great.Then we come to the poutine. Whoo baby. It's 3 AM. You're stumbling down Mont Royal Ave looking for something, but you don't know what it is yet. And then, like a sign from the potato and gravy and cheese gods of the old times, Dirty Pizza appears, holding a boat of poutine and sporting an awesome French Canadian accent. They've got you, bro.First, try the classic. Freshly made fries, super thick and meaty gravy, squeeky cheese curds that, thanks to the fat content of the gravy, are just a little bit melted on the outside. Share with friends, and then regret that you did.And that's not even its final form. Go in for the options. Smoked meat (think French Canadian pastrami), Korean bbq beef, mac and cheese. Some other stuff I can't remember because I was drunk.Don't trust my review due to my questionable drinking habits? Well jokes on you, friend, because every night after our first, I ate a boat of poutine before going out so I could drink even more, and the poutine was just as amazing each time!Ah, Montreal. Oh yeah, the service is excellent as well. Really friendly guy (or people, it was a different person two years ago) running the place."

I think that's how pizza was invented, as humble food stretched to last longer. Needless to say the pizza I ordered didn't last long. It's so easy to eat and it's simply delicious. There were many options to veganize and I picked the vegetarian one and they simply replaced the cheese with a vegan version that I jazzed up at home with thin slices of Gusta pepperoni."
/user_details?userid=r6PbQjtij6gcalYWBBrILg,Maria B.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Came in for a quick bite before a night out since they had vegan options for my bf. I was surprised that such a small location could put out such delicious vegan pizza so quickly. The inside is small and probably only sits 8-10 people so if you pop in late at night things might be crowded. We got the vegan pizza which is any pizza on the menu but substituted for vegan options. The pizza was thin and cooked perfectly and I easily could have eaten more the half yo myself. If you wanna to treat yourself and be surprised hit this spot up !

/user_details?userid=eMqCPTl-VRfYqy3niVHnPA,Calvin T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Order from Uber eats, so fresh, so good! Probably it's the best pizza I've had this year!!!!!!!will order again for sure!"
/user_details?userid=_h-k-LFugDsuX9Qf5vx9jg,Jessica B.,"Severn, MD",4 star rating,I had a half Angry Goat and half a Pig Mac and wow this is delicious! Thin crust and perfectly cooked! The guy with pink hair working that shift was algo very helpful suggesting flavors and combinations! Price is a bit steep but if you are visiting I would say it's totally worth it!!
/user_details?userid=iYCmtuB2mPKKTU5z0eabGg,Dawn P.,"Waterbury, CT",5 star rating,Found this place while visiting the city. Great pizza and service. Very friendly and lots of great different choices for pizza. The hot mac and cheese was excellent!! I would highly recommend coming here.
/user_details?userid=voFxNdzhG-cDrW_9NzFGbw,Denzil D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Ok, I had take-out so this isn't a fair representation of the food served in the restaurant. That said, it fit the bill for us on a take-out nite and we enjoyed it. I feel that to give it a real chance I should also have a poutine match but obviously poutine is not a take-out choice. Give it a try, I will again. Enjoy!"
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"I've had every other variation of the Mac attack from this franchise (burger, poutine, hot dog) and they have all been good just not enough mac and cheese.Now, it was time for pizza mac and cheese. A true 50/50 for me. Don't like pizza that much, love mac and cheese like it was my child.The pizza mac attack was good. I enjoyed it more than I would've enjoyed normal pizza but again, the taste of the mac and cheese was overpowered by the pizza side.It's a recurring problem here that the taste of the mac and cheese is non-existent because what they couple it with is just stronger. The only time I actually really tasted their mac and cheese was if I ordered the hot dog or the hamburger and put no other sauces on it. I've said this before but they need to add just mac and cheese on their menu. It would be so much better!The service was medium but there was only one guy to make all the pizza's and man the cashier so I understood. Our pizza came with a slightly burnt crust, but I never eat the crust anyway so it didn't bother me. The guy let us make the pizza half mac attack and half goat cheese. The goat cheese half was actually pretty good! Fresh and tasty. I would get it again."

Service is very friendly and even though there is always one guy in the kitchen and behind the counter too, service is still super quick. Great place for Pizza and Poutine.I love the La WiseGuy pizza and their Classic Poutine."
/user_details?userid=2YHsHuK27jVtHl-FjSBhUg,Kevin C.,"Springfield, MA",2 star rating,"DoorDash delivered on time but the pizza was not very good, thin crust with a thick layer of cheese & barely any sauce. Did not meet expectations."
/user_details?userid=ngS7nhw10RJcxsIH7lBonw,Avril D.,"Long Beach, CA",5 star rating,This place is way better then other places I've been with vegan poutines. Not saying any names though. They give you a huge portion of cheese and gravy. Unlike most places ! The street parking sucks all the time. But hopefully you'll find a spot. Seating is limited inside ! But they have a patio in the summer which is always packed and I see why. Honestly everything is priced on the menu at a reasonable rate ! The Vegan huge poutine came to $11 and you can share it between 2 people easily ! Bring your appetite these guys don't skim or are cheap. My only suggestion don't buy a beverage. It's pretty high the soda ! The owner was there and he's a super cool and funny guy. The decor is super cute and the place is very clean too. Also I am not sure if they have a washroom. But try one of their crazy pizzas off the menu or a poutine with these guys you get more then your money's worth. And they love paying extra money for the best ingredients !
/user_details?userid=GbDfPbqp7gKRwbn116KDSA,Ben K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is a review of Dirty Pizza, and I haven't even tried their pizza yet. No, this is about their poutine. Crispy fries, sauce is *on point*. They make it to order so the fries are extra crispy. These guys have their formula down. Extra tip, I asked them and they're cool with bringing your own container. Tell them if you have your own utensils before they dunk a plastic fork into your poutine. 5/5, I'm salivating just thinking about it."
/user_details?userid=rRKRIBTKW8IrkJsF53DonA,Ryan K.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I stopped by here for a quick lunch today. The menu is simple at first...pizza or poutine! But these aren't your usual toppings on both (although they have the usual ones too). I have no idea why, but I went for a poutine pizza! Yup...poutine on pizza dough covered in cheese. I was actually pretty good! As I was waiting for it (doesn't take too long at all),I was looking through the menu again. Lot of interesting option. How about kim chi with a Korean sauce...next time I guess. Shout out to the one employee in the restaurant. Really nice guy. Welcoming. Friendly. Clearly enjoys being there. I will be back!"

/user_details?userid=cI4HOmEOCT8ig5e9nQsAwA,Joanna A.,"Dorval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Located at 25 Avenue du Mont-Royal E, Dirty Pizza is the place to go to for amazing poutine and pizza.  Mount Royal is a major tourist attraction here in Montreal, and you can count on seeing hundreds of people enjoying Tam-Tams every Sunday while the weather allows it.Being a stone throw away from the mountain, makes this restaurant the ideal place to stop at.  While we were eating, we overheard the passersby say that the food looks so amazing, that they will have to come back.  The customers of the pub next door, kept looking at us while we enjoyed our meals- with looks of envy and jealousy- with good reason.While the indoor customer capacity is bit limited, it is cozy.  The walls are filled with pictures of celebrities enjoying pizza.  It is fun to try and spot your favorite celebrity while placing your order- which, took us several minutes to do because everything sounded so good.  I had looked at the menu all morning, and I still couldn't decide what I wanted because everything is so appetizing.We ended up ordering La Angry Goat Pizza (Goat cheese, roasted red peppers, pesto sauce, balsamic reduction),  La K-Pop Pizza (Kimchi, BBQ sauce Dirty Dogs, black sesame seeds), La P.I.G. Mac Poutine (4 Cheese Mac & Cheese, pulled pork, caramelized onions, BBQ sauce Dirty Dogs).Delicious.The pizzas are amazing.  Any fan of Kimchi, needs to try the K-Pop Pizza.  It had the perfect amount of heat to compliment the cheese.  Just like many of the dishes, they offer toppings that you can't get at your local pizzeria.  There is a reason they say they offer gourmet meals!""I don't think I've ever seen Kimchi as a pizza topping before!"" - A Happy Dirty Pizza DinerThe goat cheese, mixed with arugula on La Angry Goat pizza, was perfect.  Plus, any pesto lover will love the sauce.If you ever have any issues concerning the toppings, they will work hard to accommodate your needs.  Half and half pizzas, vegan options- they want to ensure that you love your meal.I will definitely be returning to enjoy several other meals, and I hope to see you there!"
/user_details?userid=1Bljt-GngRP4XxkQFLnHHQ,Rod M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"3 stars for the pizza and 1 star for the service.  Let me be clear I have no issue with the guy who served me, he was friendly and doing his best. However, the owner of this shop is out to lunch.  So it was Saturday evening at 8 PM,  it's the middle of mural fest and it is Grand Prix weekend. There was one guy working in the restaurant!  He was taking orders, manning the cash, serving, prepping the food and he was also the cook. That's right, at peak hours on the busiest night for Montreal restaurants in the entire year there was one person working in the restaurant.  Not the best plan. I must admit he handled it well. He was telling people that it would be 25 minutes for a pizza, perhaps up to 45 minutes if you were a group. As for the pizza, they have a creative menue consisting of all sorts of dirty options, many of which are available vegetarian.  I went for the all dressed. It was perfectly good. Nothing spectacular,  but would hit the spot if you were hungry and I. The mood for pizza."
/user_details?userid=AP884nbKG4B9v9qzUG93RA,Zoe B.,"Wilbraham, MA",1 star rating,"Pizza took two hours to get to me. That's enough for this place to be bad. I'm disappointed. Maybe fix your service to get good yep reviews it can't hurt to be nice on the phone either. The person who picked up kept saying ""you know what I mean."" I don't know what that means. At this point it does not matter if the food is good or bad because I don't have it lol."
/user_details?userid=jtLeaMInqLu_qAfPUoqsTA,trish t.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"Researched vegan pizza places online, found Dirty Pizza a couple of kilometers away, and decided to walk over on a beautiful afternoon. Looking in windows, porches, and balconies along the way as per usual, I encountered more cats than usual - -    . A good omen indeed! Anyway, ordered a medium sized vegan ""vege pizza"" for take out from the very friendly owner. So glad I gave it a try. It is definitely the best vegan pizza I have had in Montreal. Thin, crispy crust with just the right toppings (I substituted olives for jalapeños). So tasty and fresh!"
/user_details?userid=GO_Sn1FaNOKaEppoIwxQiQ,Ryley A.,"Woodroffe - Lincoln Heights, Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,DIRTY PIZZA does NOT mess around or leave you unimpressed. From the amazing creations to filling portions this is a hot spot to stop anytime of day! I tried the Mac attack poutine and it was a highlight of my weekend!
/user_details?userid=XZfv70IsujPrIMGKeL9kdw,Vanessa F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Small pizza joint with a good selection of vegan pizzas and poutines. Service was friendly and my pizza (veganized version of the végé, with cheeze) was tasty. Located close to Mont-Royal. The price was indeed rather steep though -- 13+$ for a small pizza. I would come again, though."
/user_details?userid=4zSzVek19TMfFsSL3Pg7sQ,Katelin B.,"Huntsville, Canada",5 star rating,"We stumbled across this place after arriving in Montreal from Ontario and ordered pizza to eat out on the front patio. Really amazing service (cut our pizza into kid-sized slices for my two year old, without us asking) and good tasting food. Pretty great value for a medium pizza that fed all three of us."
/user_details?userid=yMyeQHV16449-fCkkC2c-A,Mason P.,"Honeoye Falls, NY",5 star rating,Literally the best pizza I've ever had. Crazy low prices and fast service. This pizza has to be the best the city definitely worth a try if you're in the area or around it! Does not disappoint!
/user_details?userid=6UjqJov4DQfkU2VUGHUuBg,Jess G.,"Stoney Creek, Hamilton, Canada",5 star rating,"Came here with my friend to order a pizza before (aka during) a night of drinking. I'm vegan and was surprised to see a vegan pizza option, although i'm gluten free as well so I ordered the poutine; I can confirm that this vegan poutine is the best drunk food there is. Although I can't decide what was better, the food or the service. SUPER friendly, helpful, and funny. Wish i could give this place 6/5 stars. -sincerely, the hamilton girls"
