They add so many sichuan peppercorns and peppercorn oil in the food that even water tastes citrusy. The thing that makes me come back to L'Appétissant Sichuan is the Dry Pot Frog Legs (5/5). The flavour of frog goes SO well with the dry pot mix. I know I lot of people claim that frog tastes like chicken, so to check if L'Appétissant Sichuan had unlocked a heavenly secret dry pot mix, I went back to the restaurant the following day and ordered their dry pot chicken (4/5) and dry pot frog legs to do a side by side comparison. The dry pot chicken used the same dry pot mix and was good, but the frog legs shined through.I also tried a bunch of other dishes from the menu, and they tasted very authentic (no flavour dilution)."
