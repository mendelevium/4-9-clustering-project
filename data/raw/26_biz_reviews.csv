/user_details?userid=azZdNaUfeb8J9H1k_aoWJQ,Agnes W.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,Top rated and reviewed for a reason. Bouillon Bilk does not disappoint! I've been fortunate enough to eat at some wonderful restaurants and this place definitely ranks near the top of the list. The place bring a unique elegance from the decor to the food. The food looks almost effortless but definitely brings satisfaction.

We tried their chicken liver pate, smoked fish, the scallop dish and the linguine. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented.I will definitely consider revisiting next time I'm in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Amazing food with great service. We took the 8 course menu for 100$. Everything was delicious. The plating is beautiful. The combination of the different ingredients and sauce in each dish is perfect. My personal fave is the veal tartare and the foie gras. They're able to change the menu and accomodate you according to your allergies and intolerance which is awesome. The service was a bit slow. It took us almost 3h30 for the whole meal. However, the staff were very nice, friendly and professional. The place's inside is very simple, no extravagant or fancy decorations, but it is clean."
/user_details?userid=MqhhHaIcNwDCTblkCOf1Ug,Jean JD Audouin D.,"Lake Clear, NY",5 star rating,"I was introduced to Bouillon Bilk by my fellow chef friend who said this was her favorite go to in Montreal, so it was imperative that I take the time to try it. We arrived for an early lunch, were greeted at the door, and offered a few tables to pick from. French is the language of choice but they were accommodating to both of us as I spoke french and my guest did not. Decor is minimalist, clean and open. Staff were very attentive and knowledgeable.Their daily menu changes with available produce and this menu had a distinctive Asian flair which got us excited. Our coursed out meal started with a steamed oyster with black bean, ginger, pear, and tempura. This delightful mouthful was extraordinary. Presented on a bed of stones, the oyster was delicately steamed and placed in a bright broth of tamari and mirin which danced on the tongue. The added textural component of this dish was the expertly prepped micro cubed pears and the blossoms of celery. One of the best single bite fulls of the year so far. Yes it's only January but it's off to a great start! We followed that up with the Hiramasa tartare, a light Yellowtail Kingfish. This was prepared with yuzu kosho, grapefruit and fennel. The yuzu kosho citrus and chili pepper forward sauce paired with the additional grapefruit and anise bite of fennel was the perfect foil to the kingfish. The dish was presented with a thin airy crisp that melted in your mouth. We truly enjoyed this dish!!! Next came the Celery Root dish. Presented with stracchino, harissa, grapes, sunchokes, and coppa. A well balance dish. The celery root was lightly breaded and perfectly seared adorned with its accompanied by the milkyness of the stracchino cheese, sunchokes and coppa made this dish very tasty. Great texture and mouth feel along with some dollops of savory sauces made this dish a pleasure to eat. Our scallop entree arrived which were perfectly seared and seasoned nestled in a bed **zucchini, beurre noisette, pears and shiitakes. What jumped out of the dish ( beyond the perfect scallops ) was that each accompanying item on the plate could stand on its own on the flavor profile spectrum, but when treated as a single, blended bite, it exploded with harmony. **I was blown away by the prep on the zucchini. A zucchini sliver, ever so small, was battered then deep fried, following a traditional blossom preparation but this was a puffed out ball of serious yum. I now understand why this was my friend's go to property. I will return soon to sample the diner menu and report back of course. I cannot wait. Bouillon Bilk is located on St. Laurent and surely busy during the evening hours. Although we did not have lunch reservations,  my suggestion is you secure them for the evening service."
/user_details?userid=JXn62GKSc3ZnyUQd3A5nFA,Magda C.,"Englewood, CO",5 star rating,"Yes, very tasty, well executed dishes here. Expensive too but I would say it's worth it once in a while.From the appetizers the salmon one was delicious as well as asparagus salad.The cod entre was good but so small for the price.And finally dessert was the only one that I say it's normally sized, and tasted delicious.So if you have no money concerns this is a great place to eat at."
/user_details?userid=wJF-NdtxYCk_SrwG4UUL9Q,Stephanie L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been here for dinner as a tasting menu and for the à la carte lunch. It's a great restaurant for celebrations! It's located near Saint Laurent metro very close to Places des Art. Bouillon Bilk has a nice clean ambience, they have a bright space and at night it's not too dark like some fancy places. Their food is very clean and beautiful. This review is more based on my recent lunch, as I went for the tasting menu a few months ago. The tasting menu was very good and diverse, and actually very filling. Thé à la carte lunch was great as well. They had many options from salads, soups, to tartare. I opted for the hamachi tartare it was very delicious and fresh tasting. For the entree, I got the pork cheeks, super tender and delicious. My father got the fish, he really enjoyed it. He is not tolerant of salty or rich food and was pleased with this. For dessert we shared the apple cake, which was accompanied by cinnamon ice cream. Great dessert for the season! The service was also very good! I do recommend this place for a special occasion or celebration! Or if you just want some great food and to treat yourself!"
/user_details?userid=KFsbACIHXQxyff_W6CN1LA,Karen H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This French trendy cuisine was suggested by customers where I work, and surprising that's where I ended up having lunch. Greeted by a host upon entering I chose to sit at the bar. The decor is open and minimalist. Lunch menu's are minimized compared to the dinner menu, so the few choices were quite interesting. I started  with a celery soup  drizzled with truffle oil topped with thinly sliced prosciutto and walnuts. Wonderful splash of flavour! I decided to go vegetarian and ordered the Brussels sprouts which was tempura, portobello with sour cream, kale, hazelnuts and apples. Surprisingly it was wonderful, light and filling. I enjoyed so much! There was an older man sitting next to me at the bar sipping on some wine and  we picked up a conversation on food. He wasn't a foodie like I am, he was just passing time but he was polite  to share on what he ordered. He had the lobster dumpling which he seemed to have enjoyed and the main course was the Quail. Yesssss, I did have room for dessert! Prest Brest, which was a pastry type cookie shape with Chantilly cream sandwiched in. Cappuccino is always my go to at the end of my meals. I can't wait to return and try out the dinner menu. The service was absolutely fantastic. Love is food!"
/user_details?userid=w-US6FCjLJvqTiRsnQz89w,Josie W.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I were visiting Canada from the USA for the first time. On our first night at Montreal, we were cold and hungry. We walked to this restaurant and we were both not disappointed.This was by far my best restaurant experience in a long time and looking back definitely favorite restaurant in our entire trip.Service (5/5): They were accommodating and nice.Ambience (4.5 /5): It was warm and comfortable. The decor is unassuming. The place was small and we sat very close to other couples.Food (6/5): We decided to save $20 and skip the 8 course tasting menu to do 5 course tasting menu. For less than $100CAD tip and tax per person, I'm glad we got this one. The portions were smaller and the atmosphere felt cozy yet elegant. The dishes were beautifully plated and each bite surprised me.  Do you know how you can eat really good food, but not be blown away by the flavors? For example, let's say mac and cheese is your favorite dish and you find a great mac n cheese spot. The moment you bite into it, it floods your system with the feel good and euphoric response, but if you ate let's say really good Bone Marrow, it's amazing but doesn't have the same reaction as that amazing Mac and Cheese. I felt the first way for 4 out of the 5 dishes we had at Bouillon Bilk. The fourth dish was delicious too, but I suspect they were not my flavors. I was wondering how did they get that perfect amount of sweet, salty, savory, acid, spicy, into every dish?! I don't want to overhype this place but each plate was SERIOUSLY delicious. That duck?! OMG. That Hamachi? UGH. SO GOOD. Cons:The only issue I had was that the time it took in between each course was longer than I'd like, sometimes 10+minutes. Especially when it only took us 1-2 minutes to savor the bites and finish the plate, we wanted MORE! But it was still worth the wait."
/user_details?userid=65kdUhcdbgCqc0tvfK56Eg,Jessica S.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"If I could give this place a 6 star review I would - this has genuinely been my favourite restaurant in Montreal, possibly my fav restaurant EVER. We came here on a rainy Thursday for lunch and were just completely blown away by the food!!!!We ordered the escargots (their daily special, $10) and their salad of the day to start. The escargots dish was the most heavenly thing I have ever tasted. It came with the most fresh and well seasoned mushrooms (never knew mushrooms could taste so good), some kind of magical sauce and it was genuinely just sweet, salty, and nuanced. Like, WOW. Seriously I could eat it for the rest of my life.The salad was a constructed Caesar and it was the thing that I wasn't a huge fan of because the cabbage was super bitter but my partner really loved it.The mains were mind blowingly good. I got the pork dish and my partner got the lamb cavetelli. They were super different from each other with the cavetelli being more rich and cheesy while the pork was a bit lighter. I am in love with the pork dish. The sauce it was marinated in was tangy and umami - and it came with a side of grains/salad - and when you put it all together it was this explosion of flavour and deliciousness. I could write for years about it but honestly just go and try it for yourself.To finish off we both got desserts: their chocolate cake (very interesting, it was deconstructed with plum and ice cream) as well as their mignardises that included 3 tasters. The dessert did not disappoint and was the perfect finish to the meal!For all of this plus two alcoholic drinks, it came out to $110 before tip and for the elevated level of food we felt this was amazing value for the price.Honestly, as I said above, I am IN LOVE with this restaurant and can not wait to come back for their dinner menu. I am seriously considering coming back the same day to eat here again."
/user_details?userid=0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,Cindy Feng Xin L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,I have never tried the food at Bouillon Bilk but I have tasted the arrogance and ignorance of the staff member at the front desk telling me to get lost because I did not have a reservation. I will never support business that is turning clients away in such a mean way. Bye adieu!
/user_details?userid=Rinh3I45DL3ksjnXzG6q2w,Jem S.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"TL;DR: Bouillon Bilk is a classy restaurant great for a date. Tasting menu is an excellent value for five to seven delicious dishes, especially shrimp linguini and steak and uni tartare.VERDICT: I recommend.The restaurant has a classy ambience that is good for a date without being a romantic spot. When I went with two other friends, there were couples, businessmen and women, and friend groups. I recommend making a reservation to ensure a table at the desired time.They have a la carte items, but if it is your first time at Bouillon Bilk, I recommend the tasting menu. They had a five and eight course menu. The five was sufficient to satiate my hunger and taste buds. The highlights were the steak and uni tartare, shrimp linguini. I liked the quail and foie gras; however, the foie gras was especially smooth and left something to be desired with regards to texture. It may be wise to save some bread to eat with the foie gras. Still, it was super tasty and cleaned my plate. The dessert was interesting. The ice cream and hazelnut flavours were rather refreshing without feeling heavy and decadent. I also really liked the crunch that was added to the dessert dish.The staff and servers are very friendly. No complaints there with five stars all around. Bouillon Bilk has top notch food without breaking the bank."
/user_details?userid=Nh_bEaSu3MQo4MZGoExIKg,Victor L.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Wow. This place is not for everyone but it is for me. Upon arriving I was asked by the impeccably dressed host if I had reservations of course I did not. I asked if I could sit at the bar and he gave me the option of a table if could be finished within 1.5 hours when the next reservation was due. I said yes! The restaurant is clean, crisp and modern without trying too hard. The tables are made of reclaimed wood and the walls are a warm Ralph Lauren white. The menu was small but well curated. The aromas that fill the room are marvelous.   I have to admit the wine list was extensive and huge , the waitress suggest a few wines and it was perfect.  The food was delicious, the table ordered the sea bass and the steak and lobster. Wow amazing."
/user_details?userid=dRd4dfPWP8wI4zBNEpL44A,Ora X.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,It's a little french restaurant with Japanese fusion. The beef plate with layer of black truffle and the cucumber dessert were really outstanding. Platings were stylish. Seasonings were playful but well balanced at the same time. Service was attentive and relaxing. Definitely worth a visit
/user_details?userid=tUg8KgP-DTmIcNNUoEjkPA,Shirley Z.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,"Wonderful meal- price was decent and the food is delicious!The beef is a hanger steak with radish and a potato Mille-feuille. It was so flavorful and the radish provided a nice cleanse to the palette The mushroom pea soup was very hearty and the crispy bread was a different texture. The little slices of kumquat added acidity to the soupThe skin on the white fish was perfectly seared- so crispy. The portables mushroom was a good complement to the cucumbers providing a wonderful variety of flavors! Lastly the dessert ""Chou"" was a profiterole with hazelnut ice cream, coffee, and candied bits. Bill came out to 80CAD but it was one of the best meals and service was superb!!"
/user_details?userid=jpF5VxuG9moPTZzDfAPuSA,Tram L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This was on my to-try list, finally took my parents there for Father's Day.The place is modernly decorated. Classy. The staff is very courteous, helpful and attentive.The food was great. We tried out the amuse-bouche, the foie gras, beef & lobster and black bass. Everything was very well seasoned, all the tastes worked together harmoniously. When I mentioned I don't eat gluten, they actually came out with rice crackers which was nice. The bread was apparently very good. The dessert was also very interesting: parsnip ice creaam with roasted bananas and chocolate!!!!I like the portions, I was actually slightly more full than I thought I would be but keep in mind that this is not a bistro type place with hearty servings. I definitely recommend this place and would come back :)"

Loved the tartare, scallops, deer, and ravioli.I wish restaurants like here would stop using the yellow pages booking system as it sucks.They just redid their decor and its ok but felt bland or sterile but the service elevates the game."
/user_details?userid=HhRcq4INJlID3helYAcLug,Melissa H.,"Fremont, CA",5 star rating,"Bouillon Bilk was the last meal I had in Montreal, and it really ended my trip on a good note! They offer very reasonably priced tasting menus, but my boyfriend and I chose to order a la carte + two cocktails to share. Each dish is so well balanced and so aesthetically plated! Highlights: - Oysters: these oysters were INCREDIBLE. I've eaten so many oysters in my life but these definitely ranked among the top. They let you choose between West coast and East coast oysters (we chose East) & they come with 3 different sauces : green mango vinaigrette (my personal fave), soy sauce & ginger, and balsamic vinegar. - Scallops: perfectly seared & paired so well with the mushrooms and microgreens on the rest of the plate. Decor and service is also top knotch. Making a reservation was also really easy online!"
/user_details?userid=towpACt4pwuCrKL0mh93fg,Joel A.,"Wilmette, IL",5 star rating,"What a lovely and beautiful meal!  We resisted ordering the degustation and created our own four course meal.  No overlap so we tried many different dishes.  Each was outstanding.  Special kudos for my wife's cucumber starter (as beautiful as it was delicious), my hiramasa (sushi) starter, and the scallops.  The staff was well-informed, attentive and friendly, and the overall vibe was wonderful. The restaurant is pricey but I never felt it was inappropriately so.  I don't give a lot of 5 star rating but this was well-deserved."
/user_details?userid=qKvgarukmApf6V0Yo6psyg,Annie Z.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Amazing service and food. The variety of taste blended so well. If you are in Montreal and are looking for a good place to eat and experience (and also willing to splurge a bit, because it is on the pricier end), I would recommend Bouillon Bilk - it would not disappoint! As a tourist, you can easily walk to Chinatown and Old Montreal - wonderful places to explore."
/user_details?userid=8PmYg12cee5WiVvVwxOXCQ,Shane S.,"Memphis, TN",4 star rating,"This place earns it spot on just about every Montreal's best restaurant lists. It's sophisticated, but not stuffy and the staff is welcoming and eager to help. I sat at the bar and enjoyed the tasting menu. They have Cuban rum (Havana Club), so I asked for a mojito and it was great. All of the dishes were great and it felt like a ""best restaurant"" experience."
/user_details?userid=mI4JiIhxbL_oNC6Dkd7pZg,Clea C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Bouillon Bilk has always been one of Montreal's best restaurants. They serve French influenced cuisine, which means every dish is delicate and a combination of interesting flavors. Each beautifully plated ingredient adds distinct flavor to the whole dining experience. For example, a dollop of jelly brings a tint of sweetness to the savory dish. My favorites are their yellowfin sashimi, and scallop with shiitake mushroom. These two are their staple items and definitely worth a try.Service is great with super friendly waiters explaining everything, and making good recommendations."
/user_details?userid=oXhCkT0hmSfRbrVtDRUllw,Austin W.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Came on a Saturday evening to a packed house.  Be sure to make a reservation to avoid disappointment.The restaurant is dimly lit with a very minimalistic decor.  The servers were quick to fill our waters but weren't the most attentive as they did not really check up on us.On to the food, we ordered the foie gras, scallops and duck.  The foie gras was amazing and was complimented well with the rhubarb and white chocolate.  It does come with a mini English muffin which was really good but we wish there was another one because we ran out too quickly.  The scallops were giant and packed with flavor with the sauces provided. It went well with the cauliflower and mushrooms.  This was the highlight of the meal for me. Lastly, the duck was quite good and cooked perfectly.  There is no wonder why this is regarded as one of the best restaurants in Canada.  The price is very reasonable for the quality that you get here."

I reserved via Resy online and I've added a note to not ask for split bills because I would like to treat for my friend's birthday. To our surprise, when we selected the dessert, it came with a candle :) I also mentioned that we would splits all dishes, so the waiter gave us extra serving plates. My favorite was the scallops but seriously, everything was delicious and well balanced. Every plate had its crunch. We had a lovely dinner. Heads to the chefs and the staffs."

We came back here for the scallops dish and it tasted even better the second time aha! Tasting menu would be a great option too.A-la-carte option is good to share between 2 people so you can taste more variety. Surf n turf is amazing! Scallop dish is a must-try. And don't forget the dessert at the end!
/user_details?userid=12oju1uZ2BdI7naEEM7wNg,Mi Rae C.,"North Bergen, NJ",5 star rating,Sometimes you need to take a culinary journey.  Excellent 8 course tasting menu a la Francois Nadon. Pretty presentation and sophisticated tastes.  I had 2 glasses of the dry Cremant sparkling wine which was perfect.  Great quality and comparable to Manhattan tasting menus bravo.
/user_details?userid=4Fn8B3ECp6-oqh7a8kOyjA,Stef M.,"Brampton, Canada",5 star rating,The short version of this review is excellent. I highly recommend this place. One of the best places I have been to and they did everything right. I am usually very critical of restaurants especially when I'm in a bad mood. I was out of town for a week and just wanted to get back home. Not much to do but dine out alone and I just hate box restaurants that basically serve left over precooked airplane food. This is not one of those places. Everything is scratch made with thought and care. No detail is overlooked. This place takes pride in everything they do. It started with the phone call. Very polite and welcoming with accurate information. Then I arrived and was immediately greeted and welcomed. The vibe at first impression was very welcoming and I couldn't wait to see what's next. The wait staff were all amazing and personable. Friendly and polite and attentive. This for me is a big indicator of the establishment as a whole. So thank you to everyone that looked after me from the kitchen to the bar and the entire staff that helped make one of the best meals I've had. The atmosphere and decor is comfortable and spacious but intimate. I ordered a Moscow mule for drinks as it is refreshing and it was made perfectly as I expected. Now the food. I like to cook and be creative so I look for inspiration when I eat out. This tasting menu was humbling. It made me question my skills but also inspired me to reach new heights. The 8 course tasting menu actually had 9 dishes. Everything was fully explained in English to me when it arrived. I was excited to eat it even more after the explanation. I wish I was a food critic or reporter. I would love to interview the people behind these dishes to see what inspired them to create these works of art. The pricing was right where it should be for this type of meal. I can't wait to go back to Montreal. I will be eating here again for sure
/user_details?userid=6K1L9XdkMiKpFQ-1B5PrqA,Allison B.,"Tiverton, RI",4 star rating,Fast and professional service. My Eggs Benedict Florentine (with a side of salmon on top) was spot on and the very generous portion of fruit was sweet and ripe.  I'd recommend this place any day over Eggspectation around the corner!
/user_details?userid=qdU1O2_ERYJlk6zAlR5kkw,Yuting Z.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Bouillon Bilk was highly recommended by one of my coworkers when he heard I was going to Montreal, so I knew I had to try it out. I easily secured a 9PM table on a Friday night. Unlike in NYC, restaurants in Montreal have your table ready as soon as you walk in the door (probably because they offer fewer seatings per night). The space itself was dimly lit and very modern/upscale - would be perfect for a date or special occasion, though I saw many large groups of friends here as well.We ordered the 5-course tasting menu for $70 CAD (8-course also available for $90 CAD), and thought it was a steal for the caliber and quantity of food. Everything was delicious. Only nit I'd have was that the pasta in the shrimp linguine seemed slightly overcooked and gummy, though that didn't detract from how good the rest of the dish was. Cocktails were well mixed, and my friend also had a wine that she loved.In a city of great food, Bouillon Bilk still stands out. I would definitely come back the next time I'm in Montreal!"

/user_details?userid=WMK1j18ACm-EtopEznV4Rg,Jana T.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"Things I like about Bouillon Bilk:A) Everything I had dinner here a few years ago and was impressed, I can't believe it's taken so long to come back.  If it's your first time here, don't be put off by the location, on a rather gritty part of lower St. Laurent.  Yes, you are in the right place and will be ushered into a serene modern space where a friendly host will whisk away your coat and seat you.  I was there for a work dinner so had to talk politely about lung disease instead of taking dozens of pictures of my food.  Please take my word for it, it's very very pretty. Absolutely gorgeous plate presentation.  We took the five course tasting menu, consisting of sashimi, beef tartare, a pasta dish, quail and dessert.  Each course was superb.  The meal was nicely paced, taking about 2 hours to finish.  We were pleasantly full by the end. The sommelier recommended a very nice Italian red that was moderately priced and paired well with the tasting menu. Service was excellent, friendly and attentive without being intrusive.  Bonus: love that this place is open on Mondays and is walking distance to Place des Arts.  Great spot for pre or post show dinner.  I definitely won't wait so long to come back again!"
/user_details?userid=0Pd-LScDP0zLf4ShnV8L0Q,Katie D.,"Manhattan Beach, CA",5 star rating,"Our lunch here was my favorite meal out of a long weekend in Montreal. Bouillon Bilk is located on the famous St. Laurent, in between the bar area and Chinatown. Certainly not the most appealing of areas, but as soon as you walk in the door, this light airy modern dining room greats you. Ahh...For a lunch menu, there were quite a number of options for starters and entrees. The cooking here is modern French and everything is absolutely beautiful. The service was also very attentive and the best we had all trip as well.CHICKEN LIVER MOUSSE: Damn it's good. The mousse has a little more structure to it (meaning not too soft) but it was incredibly smooth. The brioche that it served with was equally great and oh so buttery. The toppings of fruit, a little herb, mustard seeds and crunch provided really nice contrast of flavors and textures.SALAD: The waitress called it a chickpea salad which I think is probably inaccurate. It's mostly young spring vegetables and endives with a few pieces of green chickpeas through in. Super fresh and light.RISOTTO WITH BRAISED RABBIT: Perfectly cooked risotto is often hard to find and this was perfect. Not too soft, plenty of sauce. And the rabbit was so tender that it really blends in to the rice.ROBALO (or snook): I love myself crispy fish skin and this plate delivers that on top of tender fish underneath. The peas and veggies that accompanied the fish really brightened the dish overall. Excellent.I don't have a single negative thing to say about Bouillon Bilk. It was a top notch dining experience that is definitely deserving of its high rank on Yelp!"

I know this place requires reservations in advance and I was beyond thrilled when my little sister took me to dinner here for my birthday.Good: The space is intimate, clean and has a upscale ambience. The host was prompt to greet us and sat us at our table. The water was constantly refilled and each waiter was knowledgeable about explaining the dishes. Overall, fantastic service. I also want to mention that the desserts are amazing here.Bad: *sigh* I really wanted to like this place...We ordered the tasting menu (one 7 course and one 5 course for 2 people), which is way too much food for the two of us. The plates were beautiful works of art with creative pairings, but didn't leave any lasting impressions. Not to mention, we stayed at the restaurant for 3 hours, waiting for each course.Bottom line: This place requires patience and a big appetite if you want to try the tasting menu. I would probably only come back for the desserts though..."

/user_details?userid=WEAKuClK0BjhjHWGunMXQA,Ann W.,"Northville, MI",4 star rating,"Despite the early hour, dusk had given way to darkness as we made our way to the east end of the Quartier des Spectacles. We nearly passed the restaurant, ten minutes late in meeting a friend and claiming our reservation. Luckily, she had already arrived and was presiding over banquette seating towards the back. The restaurant was already filled (on a Wednesday evening!) as we squeezed into our seats. The front of the restaurant sported a large square bar with comfy seats surrounding it. The minimalist decor appealed to me.The restaurant offers both a tasting menu, in addition to their regular offerings. I did not do my usual research and regret not giving that menu a try. What can I say? I was tired and did not want to sit through a 3+ hour meal. But I do regret it now, after having sampled the chef's inventive offerings and seeing how well our neighbors dined.After exchanging Christmas gifts, we started with the dorado amuse-bouche. The small bites of raw fish were silky in texture and well complemented by the seaweed-wrapped pear and delicate, miniature mushrooms.Next up, we all selected the appetizer special, a thick slice of pork belly with a light touch of barbecue sauce. We all agreed that it was delicious; I even thought it was swoon-worthy. The pork belly featured layers of silky fat, as well as tender meat, was well prepared and served with strong accompaniments.I enjoyed the scallops for my main course. The large, pan-seared scallops were served with pear slices, puréed cauliflower, shiitake mushrooms, watercress, with a golden butter sauce. The dish was so lovely that I slowly savored each bite, concentrating on the delicate flavors.Selecting a dessert to cap off the meal was difficult. We all ended up with something different. For me, I went with the stewed and diced pears, cake and honey ice cream, topped with millet cereal and sunflower seeds.Service was wonderful. The server was responsive and explained each dish in detail, sometimes more than once, and refilled our bread basket more than once, as well."
/user_details?userid=jIB7NPdDQ8btRKIEx0Eb7Q,Tracy J.,"Livingston, NJ",5 star rating,"This was my most favorite restaurant in Montreal. We got the foie gras as an appetizer. For the entrees we got beef and lobster, and the scallops. As a cocktail, we got the margarita rosada. These were top notch choices (better decision than the $70 tasting menu) and portions were huge for a fine dining restaurant. The foie gras was extremely silky (yet cohesive) and melted in your mouth. The raspberry, white chocolate, and radishes were a very good complement to the savory taste. What made this better was the English muffin coated in a light butter. Placing all of the dishes elements on top brought everything together and I had a foie gras delight in my mouth!!!The entrees were quite a surprise as I had said the portions were big. The scallops were huge circular chunks and sitting on a bed of a savory cream. There were about 4-5 pieces on the plate. It was amazingly tender and every bite was doused in the sauce. The shiitake was a great addition of umami notes and super tender. It's a must buy and worth the price. Lastly the beef and lobster, I was skeptical at first cause there's a bunch of lettuce on the plate. But the beef was cooked to perfection (medium rare) and lobster tender as well. Each piece was seasoned perfectly with the amount of salt and pepper. Even more awesome was the compressed potato as it was slightly seared and cooked well. Great service overall too! Seated quickly and the waiter knew we wanted a picture. Lol!Come eat here!!"

No wonder that they are among the best restaurants in Canada(no 34 out of 100 in 2017). Hubby took me here for my birthday. We took the 5 service tasting menu with wine pairing. We could of gotten the 8 service for a little more but I don't eat that much and most of the time, Felix helps me finish my plates lol! Our waitress Marie-Alex was extraordinary! She was so amazing that it only made the evening so much more memorable. For example: there was a course in the 8 service that we really wanted to try and she made it happen for us for only a 10$ extra (for both. Not each!). EVERYTHING was on point and delicious. From the bread and butter to the last crumb in the dessert! This restaurant is a ""special occasion"" restaurant for us due to the price. But boy it's so worth it!!!"

Bouillon Bilk offers modern French cuisine, in a simplistic and elegant environment with unassuming yet knowledgeable service. A solid, winning combination. This is not your run-of-the-mill restaurant. Thought and detail are put into everything they do. From sourcing local ingredients to reinventing classic dishes, you are always in for a treat at Bouillon Bilk. It's not inexpensive, but considering the quality and experience, it is most definitely well worth the price. Many trendy restaurants in Mtl have a much steeper price point, and don't come close to Bouillon Bilk. The menu changes seasonally, so whether you're in town for a show, have a business lunch or are looking for a quaint date night, I highly recommend giving this place a go!"

I came here on a friend's recommendation, alone, for my birthday. (I was traveling for work!) I had a reservation and sat at the spacious bar in the middle of the restaurant. They have both an a la carte menu and a set menu, and I opted for the set, since the price is quite a steal comparing to fancy establishments near SF where I usually hang out.The whole tasting was just amazingly fresh and delicious. The menu didn't particularly lean towards a cuisine - there was Cantonese influence in a dish, French in another, and Japanese in yet another. I can still taste the umami of the seafood - they definitely did those spectacularly - but the meats and vegetables were delicious as well. The presentation was also beautifully arranged.They do serve some interesting stuff like rabbit or squab, so if you are not a fan of game you might want to go a la carte. Although, their game is really well done and not gamey at all!I didn't order the wine pairing but had them recommend 2 different glasses to go with the whole meal. It worked out really well, and I got to try some old world wines which are harder to get to on the west coast. If you are in Montréal, go visit this place now! You definitely will have a wonderful time there."

/user_details?userid=2XHr-Pdqqdp__sgK3pcKZQ,Sonia N.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Hands down the best meal we had in Montreal!   This was the ""special occasion"" meal of our trip and so, I was worried that it might end up being just another overly hyped up restaurant. Thankfully the many 5 star reviews for this place are legit. As soon as we sat down at our table, we were excited to see that they offered a great 8 course tasting menu and thought immediately that we were going to do just that.  However, a few more closer glances at the a la carte menu (which isn't large by any measure) and we couldn't resist the temptation to trail off and make our own tasting menu roll out.  For an amuse bouche, we went with the evening's special which included lobster, peanuts and daylilies.  Highly highly recommended.  Excellent flavor combo and we loved the nice added crunch from the peanuts.   Moving on to the actual apps, we shared a half dozen of PEI oysters, the crab and the duck.  Oysters were freshly chilled and served with 3 different kinds of sauces; All very enjoyable and the crab had a bolder curry taste served in a spring roll like shape.  Plates were pretty in  presentation but also great in flavor.  Although I didn't try the duck myself, it received very high marks.  For my main, I tried their scallops which was a larger portion than I'd originally expected. It came as 4 half silver dollar sized coins with a reasonable amount of vegetables.  Each and every bite was savored.  It was amazingly light, clean and fresh with the shiitake adding just enough of a contrasting taste without overpowering the scallops.   We loved the dishes so much that 2 other entrees were ordered, the venison and the quail!  When asked which was better, the response was ""It's like asking who you love more, mom or dad.""  Enough said, all are must-haves.  Last thoughts on this restaurant - Is it expensive? Yup.  Are the portions small?  Yup.  But are you going to regret it?  Nope.  It's definitely not an everyday place to go but if you're looking for an upscale restaurant that will make your taste buds sing on a special occasion, this one will surely fit the ""Screw it because I deserve it"" bill."

The portions were quite small as these dishes were appetizers. But...quality over quantity for sure. The lamb was beautifully seasoned and with the perfect garnishments (including dif textures such as crunchy and soft). The lobster in the linguine tasted fresh, but hands down the lamb tartare stole the show.For dessert, had the hazelnut financier - it was fruity with sorbet scoops. The sesame seeds were a nice touch. Also tried a bite of the tamarind cake, which was really good and had a complex flavour profile.Quality of all the food here was spot on.

They even allowed us to bring a last minute guest and allowed 5 people at a table meant for 4. The service was spectacular. The sommelier recommended a Sancerre - that we loved.

Or you can do a first course (left side of menu) and main course (right side of menu). The full tasting menu (8 courses $90 cad) was amazing, specifically due to the thoughtfulness of the textures in each dish. My favorites were the clam, the hamachi, and the truffle linguini. Drinks - if you order the tasting menu, you can pair wines with each course ($75 cad for full menu). I tried several cocktails but my favorite was the house take on a moscow mule. They used fresh ginger and that really kicked it up a notch. Service - All staff are well knowledgeable and lovely. While some spoke only a little English, they were so nice and seemed to enjoy practicing their presentation skills in English. We had Gabriel as our main server and he was wonderful."

Hence, we were pretty full after the 2nd main dish. We struggled to finish our last main dish...which was actually my less favorite of the whole night (venison was kinda tough...I had better elsewhere). As my friend said during our dinner there, the sauce used is well balanced and compliments the main ingredient very well. We particularly loved the scallops and poached salmon dish.Please reserved ahead of time if you want to eat there on a specific day and time (we reserved a week ahead and could only get a table at 9:30pm).Expect to pay over $100/person if you are going to consume alcohol."
/user_details?userid=uqd0G-uoYzwYAuquCjfE7A,Mari K.,"West Hartford, CT",3 star rating,"This was a nice evening, but honestly for the high price tag (I think it was $350 for the two of us) I expected more. I've done a number of prixe fixe tasting menus in different locations. While you can choose to order a la carte here, we went with the tasting menus. I did the 5-course tasting menu and my  husband went with the 8, which included the same 5 but had 3 additional courses. While many of the dishes were creative, I actually think they overdid it with trying to be overly creative with flavors, and many of the foods seemed to lack cohesion to me. Some dishes had one bite that would be really great and another that was a bit chaotic, with too many competing flavors. I also felt like some of the wine pairings weren't ideal. There were so many ingredients in each course that I am sure I'm missing a bunch, but I tried to recall most of what we had: 1st course: sparkling beer, fried clams with peppers, some crunchy things served on a long thin shell. The clams were tasty, and the sparkling beer was a nice start. There were a lot of flavors. 2nd course: red snapper, cucumber, sesame, and a bunch of other things paired with a cru Riesling3rd course: ret trout, trout roe, edamamae seeds, radish salad, nectarine, paired with a chenin blanc 4th course: venison carpaccio with strawberries, a sweet sauce, what seemed like puffed corn cereal (I really thought this detracted), served with a Morgon Cru Beaujolais5th course: shrimp linguine with truffle oil and fava beans. This was really tasty and simple. served with a wine called la levee 14, which was a sweet, oxidized wine. I didn't think this pairing worked well. 6th course: rabbit salad, with rabbit three ways (including rabbit liver), with potatoes, foie gras sauce, onions, brussell sprouts. served with a Bourgogne pinot noir (one of the better pairings)7th course: fig tartlet with swiss raw milk cheese and greens, served with vin de voile. pretty nice.8th course (dessert): ice gream, gin, yogurt, berries, white chocolate, jelly, something crunchy. I don't know what to call it but it was an interesting combination of flavors, textures, and temperatures. It was served with a dessert wine (Jurancon?) that was tasty. Again, nice experience, but I don't think I'd come back when there are so many other options to try."

We were going to try the tasting menu, but we were told that the tasting menu was only available at dinner. The interior decoration style of this place is simple and tough. It generates a clean, serious, and quiet dining environment. I believe it would be an appropriate location for business meals. But the spaces between some tables are too close, which decreases the privacy. We ordered 2 appetizers and 6 main courses to share. Most of the dishes tasted really good, and they were all in good looking. However, the octopus was not cleaned up very well, it tasted really sandy and fishy. But the server quickly replaced this order with a well-cooked new one. The service was good but not perfect. The server made a great recommendation for my drink, and I like it to go with the veal."

The vibe is a little more low-key and modern, it's not ultra fancy but they take food seriously here and it is seriously good. Our waiter was lovely and engaging and we definitely felt taken care of. Foie gras appetizer (5/5): a bit of a mishmash of cooked and raw, sweet and sour and savory elements to pair with foie gras, all marrying together so well that even my skeptical parents kept going back for more. Beef tartare (4/5): quite traditional and prepared very well. The beef is fresh so that it actually tastes less ""beefy"" and has a clean flavor. Strawberry salad (4/5): are all Canadian strawberries this full of strawberry flavor? Small but packing a punch, the strawberries were artistically plated with an assortment of vegetables in a light appetizer to celebrate the season. Linguine with shrimp (5/5): savory rich seafood flavor, nicely executed.Scallops with cauliflower (5/5): I still dream of this dish, plump and firm sweet scallops perfectly cooked, cauliflower 3 ways (pickled, pureed, and sauteed), crisp pear, it was classic and so so perfect. Guinea fowl (5/5): juicy and well-seasoned, with luscious spongey morels and a square of irresistable layered crisp potato. Familiar but totally elevated and again, perfect. Profiterole (4/5): quite good but as with most profiteroles, difficult to eat and difficult to share. Arlette (5/5): the dessert that stole my heart. Barely sweetened and rich smooth very dark chocolate, a fluffy cloud of sour cream, and a crisp for texture. If you enjoy dark chocolate, mousse, and not-too-sweet dessert, definitely order this.Dacquoise (3.5/5) and rhubarb (3.5/5): the weakest desserts, just nothing that special about them. Appetizers and desserts are small and shareable, entrees were a hearty portion. The menu has since changed a bit but order with confidence and go by your waiter's recommendations - ours steered us towards an excellent meal. For someone who is used to New York prices, the value was outstanding for this excellent meal. Also an excellent option for anyone who does not eat gluten, the menu has plenty of options."

M ordered the duck. It was amazing. She let me try some. It was tender and melted in your mouth. It melted and it mixed with the sauce and contrasted with the fresh greens. It was a full song with harmony.I got the cucumber salad. I love the freshness of cucumber and Bouillon Bilk took that characteristic and let it shine. It was enhanced with a few radishes, some goat cheese and some crispy nuts. It was crunchy, soft, and light.Next, we got three desserts: a cheese plate, strawberries, and chocolate. Yum, yum, and YUM! When we first made our reservation, we were told that the table would need to be free by 8:00 PM. As that time drew closer, and we were still enjoying our dessert, I asked our server.

We started with the ""Quebec Cheese Assortment"" (5 cheeses for $20 or 3 for $15). Of course we got 5, and they were each local and incredible. I can't remember the exact names of each cheese, and I know they rotate depending on what's available, but they're five very different and beautiful options. We ate every single bite, of course. What's better than cheese?? I can't think of anything.For my entree, I ordered the scallop dish which comes with zucchini, shiitake mushrooms, pear, and watercress served in a brown butter. Oh my stars, you guys. These scallops were the most buttery, perfectly seared, velvety pieces of fish everrrr. The brown butter was rich and fantastic and the pear provided a really interesting sweetness. This particular dish was $31 which is a bit pricey considering the small portion.

We decided to do the tasting menu which was about 8 courses. There was a little bit of everything on this menu. It does change from time to time so what we had may not be there when you go. Thats fine, keep people guessing is what works best. My favorite item was the raw fish that they poached with a hot bonito broth right in front of you. Price was amazing. I'm visiting from New York so in comparison the same tasting menu in Manhattan would be $175.00 per person. This was only 90$ (Canadian) which is like half the cost when you convert. This has been the case with all the restaurants I have tried in Montreal. The whole dining experience took over 2 hours which isnt the norm for me.

The Moscovite cocktail was incredible, one of the best cocktails I've ever had. For dinner, we ordered the linguine dish and scallop dish. The scallops were cooked perfectly.

/user_details?userid=FMl9PobVRMpSAPCEAWCa0g,Diana N.,"Mountlake Terrace, WA",4 star rating,"Found this restaurant on Eater's list of must eat restaurants in Montreal. The restaurant is small w/ fine lines, white linen tables, and has a modern feel to it. Street parking only. The restaurant is a little tricky to find since there is no sign in front of the building itself, just the name on a semi hidden front entrance. We totally missed the restaurant & walked 2 blocks too far until we realized we passed 1595. Staff and service are both friendly. There are 4 separate restrooms with a public sink area. I definitely called the restaurant to make a reservation based on another yelper's recommendation. Eating early definitely has its benefits. We set the rsvp at 5:30 and sure enough the restaurant was packed by 6:30-7pm on a Monday evening. For appetizers, we ordered:Cured mackerel w celery, green chickpeas, mint & rhubarb gelee (Amuse bouche of the day) - I didn't eat this dish bc I'm pregnant and it's ""raw"". Hubby was thoroughly impressed & raved about this dish. Steamed jumbo oyster w/ radish, pears & ginger fermented black bean broth (special of the day) - this oyster was packed a flavorful punch. Everything worked so well together and the broth was magnificent.Pork shoulder tagliatelle - this dish was good, but we could of done without it. Pasta was cooked perfectly and pork was tender. The sour cream added a slight hint of ""cheesy"" tang that I didn't care for.Sweetbreads w/ veal tongue, celery root, shishito peppers & pineapple - WOW! This dish was amazing. The sweetbreads were perfectly cooked & crispy, the veal tongue was tender & full of flavor, the celery root purée was silky smooth, the thinly shaved celery root was pickled just right and the char on the shishito peppers added a nice smokiness to the dish. The little bits of caramelized pineapple added a nice amount of sweetness.For our entrees, we ordered: Halibut two ways w/ a broccoli purée & florets, shiitake mushrooms, potatoes, Muscat grapes & hazelnuts - the crispy halibut nugget was the best element of this dish. The main halibut itself was delicate and tender, but had a slight fishy taste to it. Not sure how fresh the quality of the fish was.  The grapes and onions added a little bit too much sweetness to the dish. The shiitake mushrooms were bland and the broccoli florets were a little over cooked. This dish was crying for acidity and a squeeze of lemon definitely helped. Quail w/ quail egg, fava beans, potato, & parsnips (special of the evening) - OMG this dish was divine! Perfectly seasoned & cooked quail. The quail was slightly crisp and the sauce that came w it was smooth and rich. All of the elements were superb. Overall, we would totally return to this restaurant bc everything was executed well and the flavor profiles of each dish was exceptional (except for minor issues w/ the tagliatelle and halibut). The only thing I didn't like about this restaurant was the inflexibility of the chef/cooks not wanting to cook any proteins above medium rare. For someone who is pregnant and careful with how her food is prepared, I would have appreciated it if the chef/cook was willing to cook the protein to at least medium/medium well so that there's less of a potential illness or harm to my unborn child. For that reason, I had to go with the halibut dish which I wasn't that impressed with. I definitely recommend this restaurant. Some yelpers commented on how small the portions are, but if the server times out each course right, the dishes are actually filling. If not, fill up on their complimentary bread and butter!"

/user_details?userid=wQLqTg9_f9KxV4yr_I0JYA,Brian C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"After almost 6 years in business Bouillon Bilk has become a bit of a local legend among Montréal foodies. I have walked by this restaurant many times and because it is located on a somewhat sketchy block of few restaurants and many electronics and hard goods stores one must look carefully to actually find the place. There is no prominent signage but a close look in the window reveals a super sleek and buzzing restaurant. Based on the excellent reviews and word of mouth we have been saving a visit to Bouillon Bilk for a special occasion. The occasional arose when some highly food obsessed folks from New York City recently visited Montréal after a very long absence.The evening's objective was an eight course-tasting menu accompanied by a wine pairing with each course. A splendid array of meat, fish, fowl, pasta, sweets and interesting alcohols awaited us. We are so happy to report that our table of ""been there done that""diners was totally blown away with this incredible menu. It was a flight of fancy combining the best elements of contemporary cooking on the fly, Omakase, and classical French and Italian dishes.  The first offering was a formidable amuse bouche, of blue fin tuna tartar/ceviche and was followed by three sushi-esque courses that rival the best sushi offerings that we have had in this city.  Razor Clams,yuzu kosho, peppers, peach and sesame. All these ingredients were elegantly minced down to size and decoratively placed back in the clamshell.  No rubbery razor clam going down here. This artsy longboat of clam went down sensuously. The wizards in the kitchen almost knocked it out of the park with this one setting the highest standard for the courses that followed; Hamachi with blackberries wild rice and cucumber; and artic char with dill, squash, nectarine, fennel and radish. They were just superb.I will mention the ingredients of the next three courses in detail because they are so original and the combinations of taste texture and seasonings worked so well together. Veal with sea urchin, French beans, artichoke, and cashews. Linguini, shrimps, black truffle, fava beans and olive.  Venison, offals, strawberries , cauliflower, and shitake.  The veal with sea urchin was a not too abrupt departure from the Japanese influence of the meal up to this point.  The Linguine a perfect combination of home made noodles lovingly adorned by the other ingredients and soaked in a savory bouillon.  The venison was whimsical with just the right touch of strawberry sauce to balance the meat and the offals.The desserts of Fig Tartelette and Pecan and Chocolate Soup kept up with the quality and creativity of the first 6 courses.Of the eight wine pairings we surprised by the first, which was an artisanal beer of very complex flavors.  The wines overall were very good although we thought the sommelier was a little off on the selection of the red wines as they weren't quite up to the loftiness of the foods. The whites for the most part were more interesting and very drinkable. The repast ended with two very nice dessert wines a 2000 Gailliac Mauzac with tones of honey and a Monstrum Grenache of anonymous origin that closed this extraordinary event with a sweet and flavorful memory.Bouillon Bilk is for certain the best of Montreal and a great value given the quality of the food,  the super cool and unpretentious ambience and service. In this city of endless restaurants, many of which achieve international critical acclaim, the tasting menu here should be on your list for one of the best dining events to be had anywhere."

The front windows let in lots of natural lights. The restaurant had a refined minimalist decor with a warm buzz of activity. *Reservation is recommended. *Bouillon Bilk's menu isn't very extensive - around 5 to 6 dishes for starters and mains. *All the ingredients are sourced locally and the menu changes according to what's available each season, thus some of the dishes I had for the night might no longer be available.*loved how the restaurant gave off a high-end vibe, yet service was incredibly friendly and well - you don't need to dress up at all. -Fluke Tartare - $20 On the initial bites, I found that the fluke was quite salty on its own, however the fresh slices of apples really helped to tone down the saltiness of the fish. The truffle added just a right amount of earthiness to the dish without losing the freshness and character of the fish.-Scallops - $31the scallop was glistening when cut open! Loved the fresh pear that brought out the sweetness of the scallop. The brown butter sauce had a nutty aroma and richness which really brought the entire dish together. The only complain I would have was the portion of the scallop. Though there were several pieces on the plate, they were quite small for a main dish at a $31 price tag.-Venison - $34The venison was tender and had a perfect medium rare temperature all the way through. The meat didn't have a gamey taste and it just melted-in-your-mouth-goodness. The rosti underneath was crispy on the outside, soft and meltingly, well, potato-ey within, it was so good!  I believe the sauce contained both juniper and honeyberries, which provided a sweet, peppery taste that stands up perfectly to the robust flavors of wild game."

I was lucky enough to get in without a reservation early on a weeknight.I dined with my partner, and we ordered:- $17 - calamari, tomato, melon, thai basil, wild leeks, samphireWow. Just wow. The texture of the tomato and crisp melons perfectly complemented the taste and texture of the squid. This dish was spiced to perfection. - $34 walleye, dashi, peach, celery, kale, potatoesExquisite, and one of the best fish dishes I've had all year. The walleye was cooked perfectly, and the lightly toasted breadcrumbs added a great bit of crunch and texture to the meal. On the night that I dined in, the peaches were replaced with clementines which made for a light, fresh tasting entree. - $36 venison, sunchoke, coffee, hazelnuts, turnip, onionThe venison stole the show. Again, perfectly cooked (see a trend here?). It was medium rare on the inside, tender, and flavorful. The coffee and hazelnuts added a smokey rich taste, while the bites of turnip and onion were refreshing in comparison. Perfectly executed. (prices in CAD)The freshly baked bread was the perfect accompaniment to the meal, and I used it to soak up the sauces and juices of the dishes I tried throughout the night.The service was impeccable and the waiter made a great recommendation for a glass of red wine to go with my veal.This was the highlight of my week of dining in Montreal, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to treat their tastebuds to an amazing experience.

Since I was soberer for the former, Bouillon Bilk gets a wink and a gun as the de facto winner. Our larger party mostly hadn't arrived in Montreal yet, and as such, we took the opportunity to squeeze in a fancy pants lunch at nearby Bouillon Bilk.We arrived right as it opened, sans reservations, and were lucky to be seated. Within 15 minutes, the dining room was packed with patrons on a Friday morning. So I think we made a good choice.The menu, officially described as Canadian (New), was overtly French-influenced and not unlike the multitude of good ""American (New)"" places you find in major cities like Chicago or San Francisco. Separating the wheat from the chaff is often difficult, but in Boullion Bilk's case, I feel comfortable designating it the former.Despite the weekend of indulgences awaiting us, we still went overboard with the lunch. For starters, we went Kayne-style ham, getting oysters, foie, and tartare (tuna or hamachi, can't remember which). All just fantastic, but at a French-inspired place, the foie better be a cut above, and it was.For mains, I had a hard time deciding between the octopus and the duck confit, two personal French favorites that are well worth the coin when cooked well. I opted for the former while my compadre did the latter. Again, both dishes were wholly excellent. Overall, lunch at Bouillon Bilk was a great starter kit to a fun weekend."

The food is really good here. Everything is decomposed and reinvented. Had the scallops which were great. The brown butter sauce was amazing. Only knock on the dish is that the scallops were pretty tiny. I would expect bigger scallops for $30+ plate. The seabass was pretty good as well and the venison was very tender. The quebec cheese was great too. 5 cheese for $20 is a steal of a deal. And the desserts were great too. Got the rice pudding and it was delicious. Would definitely reccomend this place."

The food was plated beautifully and tasted heavenly, but portion size is not what you're paying for. I still give it 5 stars because the food was really tremendous. We order two appetizers, a dozen oysters, two main dishes, and two drinks and spent over 200$ with gratuity. Everything we ordered was scrumptious. Started off with a dozen oysters from Nova Scotia and British Columbia, then had appetizers of big eye tuna (special) and turbot. Our mains were halibut for the wife and scallops for myself. Since we had all seafood, it probably contributed to a not so full stomach, but every bite was delicious.French food isn't meant to be filling right?"

I'm not sure if being able to speak only English  has anything to do with it, but the waitress we had was quite rude. She had very little patience and walked away in fustration when taking my order.

This restaurant is outstanding across the board - food, service, atmosphere. A ""top 10"" experience. The restaurant has a refined minimalist decor with a warm buzz of activity. Our server was exceptional and attentive yet unobtrusive. At least 2 other people tended to us as well (water, bread, folding napkins, cleaning and resetting table). But the food, oh gawd, the food. It's been a few weeks so the exact details are a bit fuzzy, but I do very clearly recall being blown away at each serving.  I tried checking the menu to refresh my memory, but its mostly new. I will 100% visit again when I'm in MTL next."

As a frequent visitor of the beautiful city, it wasn't until my most recent trip that I decided to give this place a visit. The food here is absolute perfection. Everyone at the table raved about the food. Everything is prepared perfectly from presentation to taste to texture. This place defines culinary execution. I ordered the halibut and it tasted as if it were caught that day.  The cooking temperature ensured that the freshness of the fish hit me upon my first bite, at which time the flesh melts softly on the palate giving way to the sweet scent of the ocean. That same consistency carries through the meal from the first bite to the last. The perfect execution even carries to the vegetables and fingerling potatoes. A million kudos the the chef. The sommelier was able to offer the perfect selection to pair with our dishes. All in all this made for the perfect dining experience."

/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Hands down one of my favourite restaurants in montreal!! The first time i went was perhaps threw years ago. I don't remember exactly what I ate but I remember that ai enjoyed every dish especially the pasta. I came back yesterday night with my boyfriend and it still lived up to my expectations. We showed up thirty min late and luckily they still kept our table. We showed up at 8 pm but our just for laughs show was at 9:30 pm. We each ordered the five course tasting menu and we told them we were in a hurry so they brought everything super fast and we made it to our comedy show. Not only was our service fast but they were very attentive and made sure to ask if we wanted another drink. The bloody Caesar was nothing special but the imported red wine I had was awesome! I wish they had it at the SAQ!We started with the shima-aji (fish from Japan ) with elder berries, blackcurrant, cucumber and dill. I'm not fish person but I loved it. The fish was so fresh and was not fishy at all.  We then had the veal tartare with sea urchin, cashew nuts and it came with two lavash which resembles a cracker. So good and so many different textures. Next we had the pasta which was good but did not blow my mind. It was a linguini with truffles, shrimp and green peas. Honestly it tasted like fancy instant noodles to me. According to the menu we were supposed to have duck but they didn't have any so they replaced it with lamb.  It didn't bother me because I love lamb. It looked like a duck magret but with lamb instead. The meat was fatty and cooked to perfection. The portions are not big but I was full at the end of the meal. Lastly we had the coconut dacquoise. Its like a cake with coconut and white chocolate on top. It was delicious ! It also came with a raspberry sorbet but I preferred eating it separately rather than eating it with the cake.I definitely recommend this restaurant! Not only is the plating like art but the food is absolutely delicious!"

The restaurant itself is small and trendy, and the hosts and waitstaff all very polite and knowledgable. While the ambiance of the space and the attentiveness of our waiter definitely contributed to the experience, the real star of the night was the food.We started with cocktails and appetizers; the hamachi, and the sweetbreads with veal tongue. The hamachi was served raw, and was paired with yuzu kosho, grapefruit, fennel, and cucumber. Delicious, clean, and light. The sweetbreads may have been the single best thing I had all night, and both they and the tongue were melt in your mouth tender. For our entrees we had duck three ways (dumpling, breast, and heart), and halibut two ways (filet, and fried cheek). All three variations of the duck were amazing. The heart was meaty and tasty without being gamey, the breast was tender and paired perfectly with the cara cara orange, and the dumpling was good enough to be a dish of its own. The fish was just as good, especially the cheek, which flaked apart as soon as the fork hit it. We ended our meal with a pistachio financier served with black current, white chocolate, and basil. Just sweet enough, and the perfect ending to a great meal. The courteousness of the staff, the beautiful plating, and most importantly the flavor of the food make Bouillon Bilk a must try."

Shrimp in a thin layer of daikon radish with shimeji mushrooms, a touch of ginger, and shishito peppers. 2. Two pieces of Hamachi sashimis with a slightly sour sauce that also had some soy sauce flavor. Very fresh material but the flavorful sauce kind of overshadows the fish3. Cavatelli with crab and green peas. This is my favorite dish! A light pasta in a savory light yellow sauce with refreshing flavor from the peas. The crab was a highlight. 4. Beef and foie gras with truffle and fiddleheads. Foie gras was pretty good. Beef came medium (they didn't ask us how we wanted it) and was okay. We thought it would be great if was more tender. I've never fiddlehead before but it had an interesting texture. 5. Rhubarb dessert with white chocolate and pistachio crumbles. It wasn't too heavy and had a lot of interesting flavors: rhubarb, pistachio, hibiscus, and lychee (even though we couldn't taste this one)"

Always packed. So do make reservations. However - if you alone or do not mind eating at the bar, you can still score seat there.I asked sazerac as soon as I saw it on the list, but alas, it was not available that night, and my server (who was very helpful and nice, btw), recommended another drink of similar composition (name escapes me at the moment), which was incredibly well made.It's all started with perfect drink... Followed by bread and butter... Then, beautifully presented sweetbreads, veal tongue & celery root appetizer arrived. My eyes lit up, and my taste buds started singing. It was delicious. But it was not over yet - my cleaned to the original shine plate disappeared magically, and in it place came main course - perfectly seared scallops, cauliflower, shiitake mushrooms & watercress. I closed my eyes in joy and savored it piece by piece... I was not planning on dessert (ok, that's a bold fat lie if you know me. shhhh!), but I could not resist special that day - chocolate macaron, a scoop of ice cream & little cup of warmed wine, all together complimenting each other in taste pairing and in presentation.It was an amazing meal all together.For me, the class of Bouillon Bilk stands up there with Envy and Juni - with service, food and presentation being on the level that put it on the list of my forever favorites."

All the plates I managed to dig in were delicious. For everybody who will bother to read this review, the menu of the restaurant changes periodically and my descriptions below may not be valid in few months. The best of the appetizers:The risotto with white truffles was amazing, you won't find it on the menu and the portion won't fill you up, but the ingredients are perfect;Linguini with rabbit and snails, perfectly balanced, filling dish;The amuse bouche is not optional, you must have the bone marrow.  Mains were even better:I would definitely come back for my venison, it was perfectly medium rare cooked, surrounded by rich combination of side flavours; The cappelleti with parsnip, lobster and chestnut is absolutely the best alternative as a  main course for seafood lovers;Are you scallops addict, don't hesitate, the chef knows how to prepare them. The desserts are delicious and presented with imagination: parsnip ice-cream was my little discovery for the night. The wine list is long, rather then reading and pretending that we know what to choose we followed the sommelier's advice. He brought us three bottles that should match our predominately seafood choices and the two of them we picked were wonderful. Beware the restaurant will charge a deposit for big group of people, they accept reservations up to ten and the deposit will be reimbursed back to your credit card once you are at the restaurant. Fantastic restaurant for our first group dinner in 2015!"

Overall I would give it a 4.5/5.We dropped in for our 8pm reservation. The place was busy, there was a constant flow of people coming and going. The host had this really awesome flower jacket, he was friendly and quick to offer to take our coats.Decor: Felt modern and elegant, with the white walls, which did make the place seem bigger. However, there wasn't a lot of space between some of the tables. Especially the single tables. Would have liked just a bit more room to navigate. They had a mix of different tables. Higher wooden tables by the bar, and the shorter tables, with white table clothes in the main dining area. Also some tables with booths.Service 3.5/5There was a long wait between some of our appetizers and our main meal. We didn't leave the restaurant until 2.5 hours later. They did forgot about 1 of our appetizers, so it was slow in coming out. And then the main meal took a bit longer to come out. Since there was a bigger group that put their order in before us. They did apologize for the longer wait time, which was nice.Our server was great at describing every dish. She was also very knowledgeable about the ingredients and the different wines that would pair well with our meal. She was friendly and checked to make sure we had what we needed.Food 4.5/5 Each and every dish was presented beautifully. Truly works of art.Appetizer - Every appetizer we ordered was delicious.The sweetbreads were delicious and fried nice and soft. This was my first time trying it and I really enjoyed it. The veal tongue melted in your mouth. It was soft and not chewy. I loved the pear toffee reduction. The toffee was unexpected, but add a nice sweet caramel taste. The pear and toffee paired nicely with the sweetbreads and the tongue. We order the special scallop amuse bouche twice because my boyfriend like it so much. The scallops came with clementine and parsnip. Scallops were fresh and succulent. The sweetness of the scallops, were brought out by the clementine and lime juice. The special appetizer of sashimi fluke was my favourite dish of the night. I definitely had a wow moment after eating the dish. It was that good. This was accompanied by beets and plums. That were sweet and delicious. Fried capers were a lovely crunchy treat that added a crunchy texture to the dish. Very pretty to look at. MainVenison with hedgehog mushrooms. Venison was very tender and delicious cooked perfectly. The meat melted in your mouth. The venison didn't have a gamey taste to it at all. The inside was still pink and juicy. This was served on a bed of quinoa with chestnuts and greens.  The chocolate coffee sauce brought the whole dish together. I usually dislike chocolate in savoury dishes, but here the chocolate was light and not over powering. My boyfriend ordered the sirloin steak with hedgehog mushrooms, snails and onions. Steak was soft and pink in the centre. You could truly taste the beef flavour coming through. This was a good dish, but it was my least favourite dish of the night.We ordered the pear molasses cake with pear ginger, parsnip ice cream, to share. I was truly blown away by the parsnip ice cream. Who would think that this would make a nice ice cream flavour? It was really delicious and you could definitely taste the parsnip. It was a nice way to finish the meal with something sweet but not overly sweet, which I find a lot of dessert can be. It also wasn't too heavy, which was great especially after all the other food we ate.I would definitely come back to try their other dishes if I was in Montreal again."

The hamachi was beautifully presented with incredibly fresh yellowtail. The white truffle risotto was to die for. If this was the last dish of my life, I would die very happy. There was a plentiful amount of white truffles along with crispy leaves of Brussel sprouts. It was so good, we ordered a second order for desert. For our entrees, we ordered lobster cappelletti and scallops. Both really good dishes with perfectly cooked scallops. The let down was desert when compared to the rest of the ordered food: chocolate mousse brioche with shaving of (frozen?) foie gras. Overthought and salty. I would skip this one. The sommelier here is super knowledgable and will surely pair your choices with the perfect wine. On my next visit to Montreal, I will surely be coming back to this gem.

Maybe it's just because I am used to New York City prices, but I thought that the alcohol was quite reasonable (even with out the USD:CAD conversion ;) ).We opted to get a tortellini and duck dish to start which was delightful. It was a little small for two people, but we certainly wanted to save room for the main course so it was okay. For the main course, we got the venison and the scallops. I am so torn on which one was better. I did enjoy the scallops because they utilized a lot of different sauces and textures which really added pizzazz to the fish, but the venison was cooked absolutely perfectly. You really can't go wrong with either. Now, the absolute BEST part of my meal was the pumpkin cake dessert. It featured a variety of nuts, cream, carrot shavings, and was topped with a little dollop of ginger ice cream. Given the complexity of the dish and components, every bite that you had was completely different than the last and legitimately made my mouth the happiest place on earth. If it had not been out last night, I would have made my boyfriend go back just to get that wonderful dish one last time.Seriously this place is amazing - I can't recommend it more. The chef clearly puts a lot of effort into building the flavors of each dish, and the result is something you have never had and probably will never have again."
/user_details?userid=fHrCK0tAEzUPXBVGObGzAQ,Emily L.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"FINALLY made it to Bouillon Bilk! It's been on my list for a very, very long time and the hype was definitely worth it.  First off, a 5:30pm reservation is definitely where it's at. The restaurant opens exactly at 5:30 and you will be one of the first tables seated. Within minutes, the rest of the place will be packed with all the other smart cookies who had the same plan as you. That way you don't have to deal with too much of a backlog in the kitchen as you would if you were the second seating in the evening. You even get the added bonus of dealing with extra-friendly staff at the beginning of service.In terms of decor, the crisp white tablecloths and the sparkling wine glasses are the first things you notice when you walk in the door. In the middle of the dining room, the wooden bartop is attention-grabbing (Note to self: Ask to sit at the bar next time... Just gorgeous!). For service, the staff is VERY attentive and as another reviewer pointed out, they are absolute experts on the menu. The waitress and chef were very accommodating for the dairy and nut allergies at our table. Now, onto the foooooood: Lamb tartar - This was my first time trying lamb tartar and now I'm a big fan. The combination of the smoky cabbage, crispy topping and some sort of stonefruit all on top of the lamb was just unreal. Beef duo - Special of the night. Grilled strip loin (""Melt-in-your-mouth"") with braised beef cheeks (Super tender), veggies, mushroom and gnochhi (Original dish has butter, parmesan and sweet potato puree as well).Lobster cappelleti - Rich and indulgent, in the best way possible. The mascarpone and cream filling was soooo savoury and satisfying. Big chunks of lobster on top. Crispy fried bits and some plainer green veggies on the side... I was literally tasting perfection. Chocolate ganache - With sour cream ice cream and lemon cream. I was warned by previous reviews that dessert is not Bouillon Bilk's strong point. I agree that it was average but there is nothing bad about the standard chocolate ganache. To explain my four-star rating... We both agreed (like other reviewers) that a five-star rating would be granted with slightly larger portion sizes. Even after having three full courses, we were not that full. Yes, the flavours, service and decor are top notch but just a little bit more food on their plates would be ideal!"

Service is excellent. Couldn't ask for a better server. Attentive and knowledgeable. The food is presented like a work of art and tastes as good as it looks.There's a discovery of new flavors and textures for every bite you take. Everything on the menu is minimally described but once you get to taste your dish, you'll notice that there's a lot more going on. A spoonful of one side of the dish will not taste the same as the other side. It's almost like exploring a huge new world that is on your plate but you don't know where to start and where to go but everything seems so right.You don't go there to eat, you go there to experience."

I started with a delightful parsnip and cauliflower cream soup; the lip of the soup bowl was decorated with thin slices of apple and lightly pickled cauliflower. Next, a halibut ceviche (waxy texture and outstanding flavour) with pecans and almonds on a bed of crème fraîche which was a revelation. Then when I thought it couldn't get any better, crémeux chocolat, a delightful marriage of milk chocolate mousse-like peaked cones and dark chocolate cake bits complemented by candied orange and a bittersweet citrus sauce. Including a local gin martini and an espresso the total was a very reasonable $50 solo. The service was polished, the atmosphere casual. A perfect meal."

/user_details?userid=Jp9xBkyPiLSV2IPrPqNIUw,Melanie K.,"San Diego, CA",3 star rating,"We dined at Bouillon Bilk on our second night in Montreal. It was good but not great in my opinion. Maybe I expected more from all of the stellar reviews? I'm not sure. We both started with the amuse bouche, which was sea urchin the evening we were there. It was pretty good. My husband wasn't a fan, but that's likely because he wasn't super familiar with sea urchin to begin with. I had the steak special for dinner, I can't remember what my husband had. The food overall, aside from the amuse, was rather unmemorable. I had to look back through pictures to remember what I had. Comparing that to other meals we had while in Montreal, which I am still remembering fondly, is enough of an indication that we aren't really interested in returning. The service was okay. Our waitress was kind of spacey. They accidentally misdelivered a dessert to our table with birthday candles on it (it was neither of our birthdays). Someone, who I assumed was the Maitre D, came over didn't introduce himself and made a weird comment about our choice of dessert (strawberry something) was good even though the weather in October calls for something richer (wtf?). I thought he was going to apologize for having the wrong dessert sent to our table, buuut I guess not? Seating was cramped in an irritating, not cozy or intimate, way. Again, overall it was fine, but unmemorable. For the price there are plenty of other restaurants in Montreal we'd return to first."
/user_details?userid=FuW1EwnbQoHyDMeOGrljsg,Khanh L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Everytime I come back here, I eat something new!!!Carrots, whoever thought carrots were tasty, but it was!!! We had the carrot risotto, the lobster with almond sauce, ravioli, and sweet breads and octopus, yeah it's like this weird surf and turf and for dessert a banana cake with ice cream and chocolate sauce, it was weak and really not on par with the savory stuff. I find this place extremely interesting and original. They come up with the most unsual combinations of ingredients and when you think about it, it's not clearly obvious why someone would put these things together, then you eat it and you're like wow really this makes sense why didn't people think of this...Nothing is straightforward here, it's always an obtuse and oblique interpretation as usual!!! I'm not saying I've liked everything I ate here, but some of the stuff I didn't like, I can still see there was some thought put into it, what the chef was trying to do. That for me still gets points even if I didn't like the dish. When I eat here I can feel the intense passion for the food more so than most other places, I don't know who creates the menu at this place but I'm thinking it has to be someone so interesting!!! I know whatever, let me have my fantasy!!! lolexamples from previous visits:foie gras and rhubarbe, (foie gras is torchon not seared, I think the seared foie gras would have been better)seared shrimps with bone marrow and orange miso sauce !!! this one was amazingAnd this time carrot risotto with passion fruit, sweetbreads and octopus.The carrot risotto, carrot in the sauce, with carrot bits, seriously could be the best risotto I've had the past few years. Maybe there was too much sauce or too runny as they say, but I didn't mind, It tasted great. My one only caveat was the shrimps were kind of like those mini cocktail shrimps and they didn't add anything to the dish, maybe a sear could add more flavour. The dish was amazing never thought carrots could taste so good.The sweetbread and octopus. the sweetbreads was crispy and octopus was tender, garnished with peach slices, string beans and mushrooms. a pleasant dish fresh with contrasting textures colours and flavours. very nice, I promote this place to be my new favourite french resto in MTL.The ravioli was much better meat was better salted this time around huge improvement over last time, and the ravioli texture was perfect. The lobster was so so, didn't fly for me.FYI: they just expanded about 3 weeks ago, it is now twice as big, they took over the space next door."

The host was warm, congenial, and incredibly professional. He made us feel welcome, offered us some choice seats, and had us comfortably seated in moments. The wait staff was superb and congenial as well. The food was EXQUISITE. The dishes were creative and incredibly delicious. Everything was artfully plated. The plates were a perfect portion unlike the indulgent serving of other places we went to in Montreal. My husband and I had 4 plates of food and for the first time in our trip we were able to eat everything.-Duck Tartare 18With foie gras shavings, coffee, dates, jerusalem artichoke, trevisio, kamut, and hazelnuts.This was absolutely divine. The entire dish melts in your mouth. Hazlenus with duck and foie gras is a revelation and one of the best things I have tasted.-Mackerel 18With crisp fried sweetbreads, white asparagus, dashi butter, plum, samphire. Simultaneously light and rich. This is beautiful to the eyes and taste buds. -Venison 34With rösti, cabbage, labneh, juniper, honeyberries, yellow foot chanterelles.Hearty, flavorful, and oh so satisfying.-Cornish hen 30With liver, fava beans, morels, bacon, fiddleheads, apple, mustard. I gave my husband shit for ordering chicken but it was perfectly cooked, juicy, tender, and seasoned beautifully. All the ingredients just worked. There's a great wine selection  but we were happy with our beers. The pils cauwe (pronounced cow) and brune reserve was great.We wanted to do the 8 course tasting menu but decided against it. We were informed that it would take about 3 hrs or 4 hrs, something like that to complete. We had a long day and a eventful itinerary for the next day so just ordered a lot of food. If you want to try the tasting menu set aside time for it. Everyone in your table must participate. We had a great time. I would come back."

Service was down-to-earth and friendly, and despite my last minute booking we were able to nab a table for 3 on a Friday night.  Granted, we were only given a 10-minute window to actually get to the restaurant, but as we lived nearby anyway it wasn't too much of an issue. With the goal to stuff myself silly with foie gras over the weekend, I started the meal with a foie gras appetizer. A generous slab of deliciously seared foie, sitting on top of a slice of toasted brioche and prettily dotted by pureed raspberries and a beet reduction. Apart from their regular menu were also a few daily special additions for the night (of which I unfortunately can't remember), but the scallops entree had caught my eye already anyway.  3 scallops in drool-inducing browned butter, the portion is a tad scanty but it makes me hungry just reminiscing about it.  My scallops were a tad bit overcooked - though far from the dreaded rubbery state, my inner bratty food snob says it could've used a literal *touch* less heat to retain more umami mouthfeel.  Hey, I did admit that it's quite bratty of me to point out such a minor detail - cause it was otherwise delicious. The dessert, a rhubarb, strawberries and juniper dish with lime gremolata and little islands of buttermilk cream seemed to float in a translucent pinkish red pool, which turned out to be a very thin layer of set rhubarb gel.  Lovely dishes and all-around lovely place."

Each plate is carefully thought out and the combinations of tastes and textures are simply perfect and original.

We completed the meal with the rice pudding, which was the perfect ending to an excellent meal.  The prices were very reasonable as well, ranging from $10-$20 for appetizer and $30-$40 for mains.

The server pretty much memorized the menu, he told me about the special they were having $5 for 3 shrimps. So I said why not! I should had known...... tiny tiny tiny shrimps. Picture below. Well, I guess I kinda got 3 and a 1/2 shrimp. He was being very generous.  I got the pasta. Oh - it was delicious! I tried so so so hard to not just eat it all in one bite.

But for the price point, I was totally disappointed. Let's start with the good: the food really was incredible and imaginative.While I was deciding on my order, I had the G&T no. 2 off the cocktail menu. A nice, strong g&t with tea-infused tonic water. Loved it.I started with an amuse-bouche consisting of beef tataki with gochujang mayo and some shaved radish. The beef was cooked more than I would have expected for a tataki, but this was delicious nonetheless, and a generous portion for an amuse-bouche.My appetizer was the mackerel with sweetbreads. The mackerel was absolutely gorgeous and paired beautifully with the plums, asparagus, sea beans, and dashi butter on the plate. The sweetbread, however, was an unwelcome attendee to this party. It looked like a chicken nugget, and tasted like Chinese takeout. It really didn't belong on this plate, and certainly not drowned in dashi butter considering it was already quite greasy. Points for creativity and unexpected combinations though.I chose the venison for my main course. This portion was generous (seriously, I don't understand why everyone keeps complaining about the portions at this place; I found them to be perfect), and the venison (which I was told was slow-cooked over 2 days and served medium rare, though I found it to be medium, slightly more than I would have preferred) was served with brussels sprouts, pearl onions, a rösti with a dollop of labneh, and a juniper berry sauce. This dish was PERFECT-- except for the fact that it was lukewarm at best when it reached me.The biggest issue here aside from my main course being cold was the service. This place was clearly understaffed; my waiter was lovely and was doing his best, but I was not getting what I wanted when I wanted it. I was planning to have a glass of wine with my main course, but I didn't see my waiter once between when I received my appetizer and when I finished my last course and asked for the check. That's at least 30 minutes. Totally unacceptable. Venison isn't the same without a glass of red wine, folks.Certainly a minor thing, but the decor felt pretty shabby too. No decorations or anything, just sterile white walls and a black bar.If you want a restaurant of this caliber, price point, and level of creativity, check out Hôtel Herman over in Mile End instead."

When I walked in, the girl at the front wasn't smiling or very warm, other than that, it felt amazing! I sat at the bar, it was my first time dining alone, but it was fun! The bar tender was super friendly and polite. He explained the menu in English for me, made some recommendations for both food and wine and said Bon appetite to me for every single dish! I took his recommendation for hamachi as the starter, the Arctic chat as the main course and white wine from burgundy as my wine pairing. Oh boy, all of them were amazing! All the dishes were aesthetically pleasing, and they all had great creativity with a certain degree of twist. The hamachi was very fresh, but the chef used yogurt to add a sense of creaminess. The main course, Arctic char was cook to perfection! One side were so crispy and the fish was still tender and juicy! I asked for salt for some extra seasoning, and the black chick peas were definitely unexpected for this dish. But they complimented well with each other!And the wine pairing! So awesome, it brought out an extra dimension to the dishes. It was perfect with seafood for sure, I was able to taste the crispness of the fish. I wasn't a big fan of wine before but now I don't think any meal is complete without wine!No wonder this place is among the top restaurants in Montreal! Stunning!"

And I have been to many good restaurants. The service was impeccable and the food was brilliant.The restaurant is rather elusive. It is hidden between two cheap electronic stores and there is no sign on the door. I had to walk twice in front of it to actually find the door. Once inside, it was actually rather entertaining to see other people do the same.The wine selection is rather large and they offer a lot of wines by the glass. However, I asked for something non-alcoholic: an iced tea. I was sitting at the bar and the bar tender told me: ""we don't have iced tea. I can make you one if you want but it will take five minutes."" Awesome. That Iced tea was very carefully crafted with a but of sweetness perfectly balanced by a little lemon. I loved it. And I love that he just made it on the spot.As a starter, I ordered a special: some crab salad on a perfectly toasted bread with radish, avocado purée and charred avocado. Right after the first bite, I was absolutely amazed. It was so fresh, flavorful and balanced. Then, I had scallops with charred zucchini, shiitake, pear and watercress. So much pleasure into every bite.Then, I asked if, by any chance, the bartender would be willing to make me another iced tea. Not only he was willing, but he had thought about it ahead of me: I thought you might want a second one so I had prepared a little more. That's what an impeccable service is.Finally, for desert, I had a ""baba aux fraises"". It was great but could have been better. The strawberries could have been sweeter. it was still delicious though."

You definitely need to make reservations in advance. The entrance to the restaurant is not apparent at all. The only way to spot the restaurant is to see the numerous tables through the windows then look side to side for the entrance. The restaurant is classic looking with white table cloths and servers wearing white button down shirts. The server was very helpful and was able to answer our questions. They were able to accommodate my boyfriend's gluten free allergy, which we were happy about. We ended up not doing the tasting because we weren't very hungry. I hope to try the tasting next time. To start, we ordered the hamachi in a sashimi style which came with fennel and grapefruit. It was delicious. The fennel really added to the dish nicely. For an entree, I ordered a walleye fillet. I never had that type of fish before and I was excited to try it. It came with peaches. The dish was great. The flavors were delicious and it was cooked perfectly. My boyfriend ordered the giunea fowl. It came with a sauce that was made with foie gras, and green apples and some pecans. He really enjoyed it as well. We were full by that point, so we didn't have room for dessert. Overall, we really enjoyed the food and would certainly return."

The plates were beautiful and portions were just right. The flavors were subtle enough that they all worked well together. 2.5 hours was excellent managed for the meal and service was excellent. Wines paired perfect as well. The noise level was constant and I would have liked it a little less but it wasn't too detracting. The tables are a little cramped and when the table next to us needed service, the waiters were a close to us with their backs. But that's the only negative. Aside from that it was great."

/user_details?userid=z6gseuVl0cR7tRLQa_DXuQ,Joey C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This is one of the best meals I've had in Montreal. In fact, it's one of the best I've ever had. I was already riled up from all the reviews and what other Yelpers were saying about this place but expectations were blown out the door.You can tell everything was meticulously prepared. This is as refined as it gets. Anything from meats to fish and vegetables is cooked to near perfection. The flavours have all the trademarks of fine French fare; subtle, rich, balance and harmonies. I have absolutely no criticism regarding the food other than maybe the portion sizes but that is expected for a place of this caliber. This place is surprisingly pretty good value considering the quality of the food.This place does get busy though so a reservation is recommended. Their wines are also sublime but that is expected. Of all the great eats in Montreal it's tough to stand out from the crow but this place not only does, it towers over others."

The ambiance was nice, the food was amazing and the staff was kind and attentive. Oysters, foie gras, scallops, duck, and beef were just a few of the things we ordered. All were artfully prepared and kitchen staff came out to explain exactly what was on each dish. A sommelier helped pair wines.The drinks however, were just ok. Small portions and somewhat unnecessarily strong."

/user_details?userid=JmrZp13UyBro1SiS30Q45Q,Karina L.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"- BOTTOM LINE:By far the BEST BEST meal we had in Montreal (and this included Au Pied de Cochon)...perhaps the best meal I've had in a few years. Make reservations in advance. The walk to Bouillon Bilk was not far from downtown and also close to a ton of great bars for post-dinner nightcaps.- THE SERVICE:We stumbled into Bouillon Bilk reservation-less and the French skills of an infant. The hostess told us the wait would be two hours and we were disappointed but definitely not surprised. Then, she smiled and said what the heck, and managed to squeeze us 4 in right then and there in a fantastic corner table. THANK YOU for giving us the gift of this meal! I do not know your name, but you had a really cute blue shirt with artichokes on it. The rest of the staff was awesome as well. The menu was clearly explained to us and our cups remained happily filled with cocktails and water throughout the meal.- THE SPACE:Intimate but unpretentious. Great for parents, dates, and old friends.- THE FOOD:Amazing. Spectacular. Our fois gras on toast, strawberries, and beets hit every note of texture and flavor imaginable. Us four shared this appetizer and were all able to get ample bites of the fois gras. The fruit and beets provided a refreshing break from the heaviness of the fois gras.I had the special of the day - veal 3 ways (veal cutlet, veal sweetbreads, and veal pastrami) and it was phenomenal. What an experience. The cutlet was perfectly cooked and medium rare, the sweetbreads crispy and juicy, and the pastrami perfectly salty and fatty. I really appreciated how much they try to push the envelope but still keep their flavors true and homey. My boyfriends sea bass had the crispiest skin ever. I aspire to cook fish that well.Overall, an amazing experience at this place. I'm so glad we managed to squeeze in here without a reservation...but I suggest you make one in advance! It was by the most memorable food experience we had in Montreal."

The opening of a raw fish with fennel, apple, lime, and poblano was simply incredible, and not a flavor combination I would ever consider. The second course of a tartar was, while not quite the bang of the first course, was perfectly prepared and had a balanced flavor. The third course of mussel linguine was also good, though I am not particularly fond of linguine. The mussels and the pepper sauce were incredible. The main was a simple duck plate, with perfectly medium rare duck and a sauce that is to die for. The desert finished the course with a bang, and presented a beautiful cardamom ice cream with chocolate, candied nuts, a chocolate mousse, and clementines, a flavor combination that sang. All in all I was very satisfied, and I would certainly come again"

It will be a 5 star review if the service improves. Lack of proper training and waitresses bump on customers chair, drop forks, drop everything else on the ground so often you have to be mentally prepared. Is a weekly regular at this place, but last time I went they give me a bad positioned table. I called very early to make that reservation and they should've given a better one. I tipped them 20% every time I went because I appreciate the food. Clearly, the wait stuff deserves so much less than that."
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Oh Bouillon Bilk, I have walked by you a thousand times and never tried you until recently. Why was I such a fool. I guess better late than never?We went for a late Friday afternoon lunch and the place was packed with people, mostly office/government workers that work nearby.  Luck was on our side when we walked in as that they had an empty table for the three of us! Would definitely make reservations though. Atmosphere is great and the vibe is very, very relaxed.To start, we tried the:- Daily soup ($5) - cream broccoli with goat cheese and grapes. My grandma wanted more but it was great. Not too creamy and a couple bites of goat cheese and grapes was a nice touch.- Daily salad ($5) - mixed greens with coleslaw. A very simple salad but had a nice depth of flavour to it. Very fresh and summery.For entrees, we each ordered and shared:- Gnocchi  ($16) - came with shrimp, squash and sage. This is what I ordered and it was my favourite of the three. Sauce was so good and the gnoccchi was light, not heavy, you know?- Veal flank steak ($17)  - came with chorizo, clams and coriander. I tried a bit and the chorizo had a bit of heat to it. - Red sea bass ($17) - came with spetzel, ratatouille and brussel sprouts. Fish was tender. Really liked the spetzel which you don't see very often.All the dishes were flawless and presentation was just amazing. Everything we ordered was tasty and we were all impressed. Great food, great service (our waiter explained in detail the whole menu to us) and a great place. You have to try Bouillon Bilk if you haven't been yet, it's worth it."

The atmosphere is very trendy/modern, and upscale with an expansive wine list (the sommelier was a good resource).Menu is relatively small, which I like, with about a half-dozen starters, the same number of mains, and some daily specials. I ordered one of those specials, the guinea fowl, for my main, and it was really, really awesome. The cavatelli appetizer with truffles and other goodies was also excellent.This would be a five-star meal if not for the portion size, which is extremely small for a large price tag. A favorable exchange rate does help, but it's a lot of money for what you get (which admittedly is an excellent, excellent fine dining experience). Our meal for two people included two appetizers, two mains, one dessert, one cup of tea and a bottle of wine. Total price was over $200 Canadian, which was worth it for a splurge.Definitely make a reservation if you're going to come!"

The tart appetizer was nice, though a bit too sweet for my taste, I'm sure others would love it. The fish was delightful, on a bed of grilled vegetables and an olive oil sauce that just let the seafood flavor come through perfectly. Don't know if it is worth TripAdvisor's 8th best restaurant in Montreal, but definitely a solid place. Best of all, very affordable for the quality of dishes."

Having dinner there is a special treat!It's clear that a lot of thought has been put into creating a multi sensory dining experience. And I usually tend to be skeptical with fancy nouvelle cuisine, as I find mixing too many flavors often results in loosing the taste of the main ingredient.But at Bouillon Bilk that's not the case. Everything we had was perfectly balanced and delicious.We had the hamachi, the smoked salmon with pears, the bar, the scallops, the guinea fowl, a cheese platter and desert!

The service was amazing and the atmosphere was great. It's not a big place so you feel nice and cozy. The appetizers were perfect and the dinner was superb. I had the hen and my husband had the venison. The portions look small when they come out but believe me, you will leave very stuffed. This is a little gem in Montreal and I highly recommend.LOVE!!!"

This place is fabulous. At first, the restaurant's exterior and interior decor is very plain. You wouldn't expect this place to have it all. But I came here not for the decor. I came for the vibrant and decorative menu as well as the nightly specials. Each dish from appetizers to dessert was thoroughly planned out with complimenting ingredients, bold colors and overwhelming flavors. Calling the items I enjoyed fantastic was not enough. I came here already full from the day's endless eating but had to make an attempt to sit down at Buillon Bilk on my last night in Montreal to try something. I had the lobster appetizer and sea urchin linguini. Both appetizers were drop dead fabulous! I can't imagine how numbing everything else on the menu could be. I'm at a lost for words. I could die happy. Note to self: Come back to Montreal for more Buillon Bilk."

Saw a sign for an electronics store and thought I got to the wrong place at first. What a pleasant surprise! The interior of the restaurant is modern and minimalist. Not very large and very busy. We started with the uni linguine. It was creamy and the uni was fresh and brought nice flavor. It's a small portion, but because it is very rich, it was the right amount. For the main, we had a prime rib special. Boy, was that a treat! Large 1 kg of meat that was perfectly cooked and presented with the bone in. Feast for the eyes and the stomach.  There were a couple parts that were a little raw but the waiter took it right back and cooked those slightly more. Came back out great. The prime rib also came with 3 sides, all of which were delicious. Mushrooms were simply prepared but were my favorite. There was also a cauliflower and mini carrots. Potato salad with bacon bits was very nice as well. There was so much food that I think this dish is best shared by 3-4 if you want to order appetizers and desserts. The service was excellent. I was given great wine recommendations that paired well. Overall, a great experience. Helpful service, beautifully presented tasty food, cozy and modern setting. Worth a visit!"

Visually stunning and tasted just as good.For main I had the the grilled artic char with artichokes, clementines, blood sausage, olives, cashews.  Skin was crispy, fish was cooked to perfection and again, visually like a piece of artwork.  Every bite with different combination of the accompaniments brought out new flavor combination.Definitely would be back for more if I visit Montreal again."

The server informed us that the main special was duck breast with truffle oil and shaved black truffles with chantrelle mushrooms, apple slices, latkes and parsnips... which was absolutely incredible. $38, but in a restaurant like this, you understand that the portion size won't be massive, but the taste will be out of this world -- which it was.Service was good, vibe was cool -- classy, but not stuffy. Reflective of Montreal. Would definitely go back, but again -- make sure you're ready to spend."

I was so glad we came here because the food here is soooooo yummmy that makes the whole trip worth it. We had the tomato mussel and blue fin tuna for appetiZer. It was absolutely delicious. We had steak and scallop for entree. We literally clean the plate. This would be one of the reason that makes me wanna come bak to Montreal. :) love it!!!

Drinks were also good something hard to find in Montreal. We ordered the foie gras and three cheeses for appetizer and cod and veal for entree. I loved the cod! The veal was ok wasn't a fan of the tongue . The desert was chocolate with ricotta ice cream! Loved That. Perfect for a date night in Montreal

We came here for dinner with a large party for my bachelorette party, and they were super accommodating. We ordered basically 2 of everything from apps and entrees, a special of the night, and most desserts. Usually, when you have so many dishes, you have your favorites and your no thank you dishes. However, here, there wasn't a single dish I didn't like or was indifferent about. Everything was awesome, and it was just varying degrees of awesome. Apps, the standouts: -The linguine with sea urchin was so good that we ordered another round of it. -The lamb tartare was another favorite. -Hamachi was good, but people liked the special of the night the seam bream with fried shisito pepers even more. Entrees, the standouts: -Scallops - perfectly cooked. -Beef short ribs - rich and tender.  Dessert, the stanouts: - strawberries and goat cheese - light and refreshing - pistachio cake - surprise of the night- tasty! Cocktails were tasty. Service was on point.

I really liked it alot. For the main course, I had the venison. This is served with cauliflower, chanterelles and labneh. Also very good. The deer was cooked to medium-rare.

It was the best dinner I have had in a while. Since Joe Beef was closed during our visit, we relied on Yelp to help us find another restaurant to dine at. Fortunately for us, we found Bouillon Bilk. I called to see if they had any openings and they stated they had some bar seats available.We headed over there and lucky for us, they were able to sit us in the main dining room. I would have never guessed a restaurant like this was in the neighborhood that we walked through, but surprises are sometimes good!We ordered the prosciutto and coffee amuse bouche. I have never tasted anything like it. It was simply delicious. the salty meat mixed well with the sweet chocolate and coffee. The coffee bits added a nice depth of flavor and crunch. It was the best bite. Then we got our appetizer. We ordered the rhubarb and foie gras. My God, the flavors there was amazing too. The creamy foie tasted so good with the crunch tart veggies they added on, and the sweetness of the rhubarb really balanced out the dish. I cannot explain how delicious it was. We were licking our forks to savor each ounce of food.I ordered octopus and sweetbread. The octopus was cooked perfectly; it was tender and not chewy. The sweet bread was fried nicely. Everything on the plate had a purpose and cooked to perfection. My boyfriend loved his scallops and mushrooms. He was a happy camper across from me.The desserts were the weakest link. For dessert we ordered a chocolate lava type cake and a banana cake dessert. It was both just ok, I had better versions of the chocolate dish in Seattle. Also, the banana dessert reminded me of a glorified banana bread. However, it still provided a nice, sweet ending to our meal. It was an amazing experience. I am sad that they are located all they way in Montreal."

All dishes were perfectly balanced with nuanced flavors. The red wine from the Rhône region in France was a perfect accompaniment.

We arrived without reservations and had no problem getting a seat at the bar, as the place was packed, but that's a great spot to catch all the action and chat with the bartender from. We started with the amuse bouche of the day, enjoyed fresh bread and cocktails to start, and were blown away by the quality of our main dishes. I tried a scallop dish that had a delicately arranged variety of textures - shiitake, zucchini, fried leek. My date tried the bacon wrapped rabbit with shrimp, polenta, and apple, outstanding. I could not resist a dessert, though we usually don't have any room - the meals are not huge here but they are intensely satisfying and great value, as long as you're OK with things a bit upscale. There was no music but the vibe was still wonderful, the din of diners making up for the lack of song. The decor is stark, just simple with white on most surfaces and not much in the way of decoration. Bouillon Bilk simply doesn't need anything fancy to dress it up, the focus is 100% on the food and drinks. The service was excellent, and the hostess explained at one point that they've expanded the original space, so it's perhaps twice as big as the hole in the wall size that some of the other Yelp reviews I read described.Don't miss this place!"

We already knew something was wrong. Appetizers were okay although I couldnt even taste the fine and delicate hamachi in mine because of how strong the yogurt like sauce tasted. My guinea fowl entree was really ordinary and super small and the fried oysters in the beef dish resembled frozen tempura fish nuggets. Desserts were okay, the rubarb one was delicious! Overall portions were super small and leave you hungry and they use appealing words like foie gras and urchin but they're only present in sauces you don't really taste them. Way too expensive for what it was and hostesses preferred talking to each other than saying goodbye to us even though I tried to!"

On top of that it was a very busy night so not once did the waitress come to ask us how we were doing. One thing I have to give them props for was that they allowed substitutions for 2 courses I did not want.

Every ingredient went well with each other and we felt that the food was carefully designed and prepared. The dessert, the dark chocolate cake, was fantastic! The best chocolate cake I've ever had. With that being said, the service was not prefect - it was pretty good but not perfect. When the waitress took away our empty plate and dinnerware, she forgot to give us new ones. When I told her I didn't have a fork, she only brought a fork for me without paying attention to my friend who didn't have a fork either. Also, the wait between two courses was a little long.

For an appetizer we had the oysters and for dinner she had the Veal and I had the Guinea Hen. The service was excellent and the food was prepared and presented to perfection. My only complaint was that the oysters were a bit pricey and they did not have much flavor although adimittedly, we are a bit spoiled due to the fact that the oysters from the Chesapeake region are almost always readily available to us and their salty flavor is much different from those found in British Columbia.

If you've been disappointed, you should try their Poutine here.  I bet that they use real stock for the poutine!  Delicious!  Oh well, I have to go there again and try more times to say something very fair but the first impression?  Absolutely you should try.  Oh Oh Oh!  Did I tell you that there is nowhere to go around Place d'art?  so try it! :)"

My first impression wasn't very good though, because the place was very crowded. The interior is very simple and the exterior doesn't reflect that it's a restaurant. I usually like a relaxed atmosphere with less people, and I prefer restaurants that have a cooler and stylish interior design. However, the food made up for everything that I considered as a fault before. This restaurant has a world-class cuisine. Hands down for the chef!"

Before I even get to the food, I have to say I was impressed that, within minutes of booking our reservation online, I received a personalized confirmation text noting details from the special comments section; a nice restaurant read and responded within minutes, in their secondary language, to a reservation. Then when we checked in for dinner our server commented about things we had noted; again, attention to detail. The food was all wonderful. With a chef-driven menu like this, you expect quality ingredients arranged in unexpected ways with every detail deliberately chosen, and this was no exception. Between us, hubby and I got the strawberry and tortellini appetizers, the scallops and halibut entrees, and strawberry and mascarpone mousse desserts, and the only reason I wouldn't order them again if I went back tomorrow would be to try one of the other delicious options instead. Service was attentive without hovering, and atmosphere was vibrant but still allowed for conversation. I'd absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a nice meal in Montreal and would definitely come back on future visits."

/user_details?userid=bhLMo_nNvtASjL08S6HYxg,Venetia A.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"The Montreal food scene is well talked about, with the added advantage of it being one of Anthony Bourdain's favourite places to visit because of its decadent food culture. My trip to Montreal, was a little less Bourdain-ish if you will- given that my trip was not consumed by the quest for a dish of foie gras, stuffed inside a red, bleeding hunk of meat, topped with another type of foie gras (you get the drift..). I was looking, however, to go for one very good meal, as a belated birthday dinner for my companion and boyfriend, Ben! After  much deliberation, I settled on Bouillon Bilk. I made a reservation a couple of weeks in advance, just to be safe. The atmosphere at Bouillon is somewhere in between casual and fine dining. It certainly doesn't give off the 25$ per person brunch restaurant vibe and  it certainly isn't the kind of place you'd never to think to go if you didn't have a jacket on. It makes for easy digestion, which can sometimes (in the very snotty restaurants) be hampered by the constant feeling of being stared at by your faithful server. Do not mistake this for sloppiness- the waiters are well dressed, attentive and well spoken (even if ours was rather stern at the start, she softened up later). Now for the food. My starter involved very soft, fresh crab meat, that was given character with the addition of sweet peas and an interesting almond crumble. Together, the three made for a good flavor combination on the palette- slightly bland but very good. Ben's starter was particularly unusual and excellent: linguini with uni (sea urchin). The portion was just right, not too much, but enough to fill a few fork-twirls with linguini, which was lathered with a sauce that had hints of fennel (pollen), citrus and chilli. Competing for 1st place with the sauce were the 4 pieces of uni on the top, succulent and sweet. Moving on to the main course, Ben's dish was scallops with Shitake mushroom, pea leaves and courgette done 2, perhaps 3 ways and also pear. The scallops were fresh, and the tender texture of the scallops and the Shitake mushrooms was balanced with the sweetness of the pear and the courgette. A very satisfactory and rather filling entrée. Mine was a ricotta ravioli with rabbit- the ravioli was topped with tender, tiny slivers of rabbit meat, morel mushrooms and a smattering of spiral green vegetables (that reminded me of the stickiness of okra but had a nice crunch to them). All of this in a light sauce and topped with crushed pistachios. Very good. And finally, dessert. I must mention that I almost never choose anything with chocolate for dessert, but I did this time and I wasn't sorry. We shared a chocolate Crème Prise with ricotta icecream. Three dollops of delightfully rich chocolatey goodness- a texture somewhere between mousse and ganache. This was accompanied by ricotta icecream and topped with cherries, cashews, coffee cream and a rich and bold coffee crumble. The cherries and the coffee had strong flavours which cut through the richness of the chocolate, while the icecream gave relief between each bite of chocolate, cleansing the palette for the next. We finished with tea (we also did have a glass of wine each, one of which was sub-par, but that can be easily forgiven and might also just be a matter of personal taste). The meal was, all things considered, excellent. I'd go back when next in Montreal and I highly recommend it."

We select cod and veal as main entrees. Veal is especially memorable. It contains three parts of cow: veal, sweetbread and tongue. Sweetbread is just out of the world. The service is perfect too.

This has to be one of my favorite new restaurants when I visit Montreal. I only had lunch. The soup was good and paired well with the smoked mackerel. The poutine was a bit overwhelming, but not in the slabs-of-foie-gras overwhelming like Au Pied, but sort of flavor wise, a little too much between the scallions and the turkey confit that seemed to overwhelm rather than mesh together. Still, it was really really good. 4.5 rounded up."
/user_details?userid=icho881NakuYDGXcPi4lxg,Katie X.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The reason that I'm not giving 5 stars is that the food quality is somewhat uneven. I went here for dinner and it was fantastic: all of the flavors were so expertly matched, everything converged into a really gorgeous scallop dish, and a delicious umami-infused lamb tagliatelle. But on another occasion, I had lunch here, and although the service was equally excellent, the food was not as good - the ingredients did not seem as fresh, the flavor combinations were less inventive. So I would recommend dining here - but be aware that it is quite expensive. Still, ambiance + food + service = a great experience, especially if you are in the mood for something on the fancy side."

Must try if you are around Montreal...managed to snag a lunch reservation and the staff was SO polite, attentive, and accommodating. The gnocchi entree was supposed to have rabbit in it, but since I don't eat rabbit, I was originally dismayed that I would have to order something else. However, they easily whipped up another veggie alternative and I was definitely impressed. The flavors were great...especially for the sweet potato w/ duck soup of the day, the New Brunswick oysters were pretty fresh but on the small side, and the osso bucco as well. The only thing that was a bit meh was that they took forever to deliver a second glass of wine and the espresso for dessert after. So we were all done with the chocolate orange cake dessert (eh....I think I could have passed on this hindsight) and waiting for the check by the time the espresso came. Oh well, still a really good gem and the exterior threw me off for a bit since there wasn't a big sign. But no worries, you're probably in the right place...all nice, sleek, white, and contemporary!"

We pretty much ordered one of every thing on the menu, but my personal favorite was the cold lobster salad. Everything was so artfully prepared, I almost (but not quite) didn't want to ruin the perfect plating.

Personally i don't eat raw dish, so i almost had no choice for appetizer. 2. I asked for recommendation for a red wine that was not too dry. The waitress gave me a recommendation but it  was actually really dry when tired it. I told her that was too dry. She took away the bottle and asked another bartender to help. However, i can tell her face gave me attitudes at that moment.The bartender was patient and nice to let me try some other options but all of them were really dry. At the end, he told he didn't have any non-dry red wine on the by -glass list. If that was the case, they should have told me at the beginning. This was really not professional. I noticed the table besides me asked for wine recommendation and the waitress brought the same two bottles she recommended to me earlier to their desk. So i guess they always recommended the same types of wine to the customer regardless their needs, which was not what i expected at a fine dining restaurants at this. And I have to mention that after that, the waitress gave me attitudes for the entire night. 3. The food was not, but not amazing. There was not suprise. You can have similar food at all other French fine dining restaurants.I don't think i will recommend this places to any of my friends."
/user_details?userid=zIOxNinC6ofIwwGjO9rUWg,David D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I heard about Bouillon Bilk a while back on Guide Resto-Voir. Finally got around to grabbin' me some tasty grub. An eatery this is not. This is a tiny little resto, maybe even a bit cramp, but it serves some very, very fine dining. First let's talk service. The service here is sublime. The server will go through EVERY item on the menu with you and to top it off he or she has some sommelier skills and can offer you the correct wine to pair with your meal. This is something that's not often seen in today's ""casual fine dining"" scene, so appreciated, even from me who doesn't drink wine. What I do drink is Whisky. And when I asked about what malts they had, he veered me towards a delicious bourbon drink which blew my mind with its sweetness. The server really knew his way around the spirits and the food and offered us great, above-par, service. Enough so that I felt guilty on my way home, leaving the guy only 20% for tip. He deserved 25% easily, and more. Let's not forget that the very elegant owner who took the time from her very busy restaurant to discuss with us and get our feedback which was pretty much as follows:GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD-DAMNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN­N THAT WAS AWESOME!Pardon my French.First of all, let's talk risotto... yeah. Kind of a pet peeve of mine. Firstly is risotto, not risotto - can't stand the common mispronunciation, just wanted to get that one out of the way.I've had some great risotto, I've had some average risotto,  and I've had some horrible risotto (I'm looking at you Liverpool House and your choke-on-your-food-its-so-dry-rabbit served on the most horrible risotto I've ever had - made more disappointing that it was prepared by a world renowned chef and the golden child of Montreal cuisine - that looked and tasted like Uncle Ben's 5 minute instant rice and was dryer that a nervous virgin on prom night, pardon my French again) but I digress. We're here to talk about Bouillon Bilk and their risotto. Their risotto is the absolute best I've had so far in my life and there's a twist. It was prepared not with chicken stock but carrot juice. I know what you're thinking, carrot juice, can they do that? Yes and the execution was mindblowingly delicious. A masterful production of flavour; it was served with sunflower seeds, curly slivers of rice vinegar marinated carrots and clementine supremes topped with a tiny dollop of crème fraiche, which if you're smart you keep for the end. Let me explain to you the best I can, how brilliant this dish was... I had to sit back in my chair and hold back some tears... yes, yes, tears. I haven't eaten something this delicious since I ate the cromesqui at Au Pied de Cochon a few years back. The only bad part about this risotto is that I couldn't eat a bucket-full of it. This brilliant starter was followed by an equally brilliant. Guinea hen with foie gras, polenta, porcini, figs, and walnuts. The guinea hen brings another level of flavour that the versatile chicken lacks, although I think I missed out on the duck my friend partook of, but seriously there's was nothing wrong with this plate. I don't know how they prepared those figs, but they were like crack, the porcini; heavenly. The foie gras, was foie gras... meaning awesome.  Even the polenta, something which I don't dislike but don't particularly care for, was better than what I've had in the past and had a very smooth texture to it. The plate looked light on food, but don't let that fool you, there was plenty. All the flavours perfectly connected with each other and had distinct ""terroire"" brilliance that I find, again, rare these days. (For a terroire-gasm, I invite you to seek out La Vieille Histoire in Ste-Rose, Laval; how they prepare boar, is sublime)Top this all off with a very playful desert; a mason jar of piping-hot fresh chocolate chip cookies. But to keep with the playful motif, I think it should have been served with a glass of milk with ""mousse-y"" head. I mean, if you're gonna make me nostalgic for my childhood, go all the way. But they were amazing, hot, melting chocolate-chip goodness, the kind of chocolate chip cookies you dream of but can never obtain. It's like chasing the chocolate-chip cookie dragon and actually catching it. Mission Accomplished.In the end, a sublime meal with great food, perfect service in a very nice dining room (though a bit loud) a hop and a skip away from Le Quartier des Spectacles and the St-Laurent Metro. It's on a block you wouldn't expect to find a fine dining restaurant, but there it is... now everyone... GO... NOW.... RIGHT NOW.... you won't regret it."

In addition we got the amuse-bouche of lobster bisque and crayfish, a few spoons fulls of creamy, salty flavor with tenderly cooked crayfish. I ordered the venison which was cooked at a perfect medium rare, the meat was a simple salt is pepper crust, however that's all it needed to respect the meat for what it was. The others got the Guinea hen which had a crispy buttery skin, and the scallops which were quote ""the best scallops I've ever had"" (which she has had a lot of scallops in her life).

/user_details?userid=W-l8Y9FnJt8zv1C7d3H5rQ,Mahmood Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I am not sophisticated enough language-wise to talk about this gastronomique restaurant, but I will do my best. We went there with my girlfriend and a good friend of ours. We had entrée, plat, dessert and a couple of bottles of average wine (from around 2005-2006, 40-50 each) and the bill was around 350$. Totally worth it. The food was original (well, gastronomique), and the waiter was very fun, charming and in very good mood. We discussed quite a lot with him, since he was an artist returning to Europe...I am rather picky on what I eat, and I have been living in France for long enough to get even pickier, but despite my reticence to ingest anything unfamiliar, my adventurous side couldn't resist what the chef was serving. We had lobster, some fried lamb brain and duck confit (with a secret sauce) as main dish. All were excellent and I even tried the lamb brain, although I could not stand looking at it, and it was delicious - a tad bit sweet, a tad bit greasy, but just striking the balance. All herbs used in the food were fresh and coming from the private garden of the restaurant. Despite the sober looks of the restaurant, the atmosphere is very happy and lively, as opposed to relaxing. Every now and then a loud and pitch female laughter rings in your ear, and the walls are not soundproof, which makes the sound reverberate even more. You can hear all the cutlery at work around you... This is not a downside for me, as I see it as a part of the concept, but I'm just warning those who are searching for a cozy and relaxing experience that this is probably not the place they are searching for. I also do not recommend the restaurant to the non-adventurous searching for normal food and reasonable environment. Absolutely not recommended for a first date either, as the food can be too weird and the menu too limited. Principally you have to eat what the chef serves at that moment (the menu changes regularly). Great place for foodie experience, though..."

The place can be a bit pricey, especially if you hit the bottles of wine, but let me tell you it is an investment for your personal education. Amen."

/user_details?userid=XfFowd4YzyWuRfrbtFCTkg,Ming P.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"My wife and I went over for our anniversary dinner. Overall, the restaurant was great and the service was wonderful. Here are what we ordered and some suggestions for the owner and chef to improve upon on. There are definitely rooms for improvement both on the food and the restaurant itself.We both order a fried oyster to start from the daily specials. $5 each. My wife enjoyed hers. Mine was really tiny. You could tell the size difference when the two plates were put on the table. I gave the bigger one to my wife. All I could taste was batter on mine and no oyster. I think they should leave the smaller oyster to serve fresh but to pick the bigger one for deep fried.I ordered the lobster appetizer ($19). My wife ordered the tuna appetizer ($21) from the daily specials. Both were great.I ordered the duck and foie gras ($35) for my main. My wife ordered the octopus and sweet bread ($34).The foie gras was prepared and pan seared to almost perfection. It could be more crispy on the outside before it melted in my mouth to be perfect. Good generous portion for the foie gras. The duck breast, however, was prepared very poorly. It was very very very very very chewy. I googled afterward why duck breast would be chewy. Apparently, it was because it was not cooked enough. It was very red for sure and there was still a lot of fat left on the skin. The skin was not crispy either which meant it was not rendered properly to cook out all the fat under the skin either. I probably should have sent it back instead of forcing it thru my guts. I hope the owner and chef will buy more duck breasts to properly train their sous chefs on how to cook duck breasts properly. (I was wondering why the waiter had brought out a steak knife for the main course.)My wife's octopus and sweet bread was prepared well although she was unhappy with the side dishes. The menu said it should come with grilled red peppers and eggplants which she liked both. However, neither made it to the plate. It came with maybe 4 pieces of green beans instead that she did not really like. At $34, they really could have given her more greens to substitute for the grilled red peppers and eggplant.They could use some candles on each table for a better ambience too. The street entrance was littered with smoked cigarettes and empty beer boxes. They seriously could sweep that 5 x 10 feet area on the street right in front of the entrance before they open each day!!!"

We ordered the hamachi appetizer (with grapefruit and yuzu) followed by two entrees - salmon (divine with a kind of Indian curry sauce) and guinea fowl (with radish, lentils and greens). The salmon was seated gently. No fishy taste and perfectly tender. The guinea fowl was so succulent. We paired it all with a glass of local Chardonnay and didn't even have room for dessert - likely because we'd OD'ed on the bottomless basket of homemade sourdough bread. Everyone from the host to the server were extremely kind and attentive and new the menu inside out. The restaurant was full of smartly dressed diners, across age ranges, even one family with well behaved children. As mentioned by other reviewers, the acoustics are poor and it gets a bit noisy when every table is filled. So go early."

/user_details?userid=e9jyPJxYuZxYAxlLG_1bzQ,Yar B.,"Morningside Heights, Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Having walked about 30 minutes in the wrong direction absentmindedly, I completed my long hike to Bouillon Bilk. In Montreal for a conference, it was dinner for 1, with my trusty friends The New Yorker and The Economist my only companions. I was delighted to find that the restaurant has seating along both sides of the large central bar, ideal for the lone rangers among us. The decor is unpretentious and minimalist without being sterile. The use of high and low tables helps make the dining room dynamic. For its small scale, it has a sense of theatre. My server, Naomi, was lovely and attentive. As she explained the specials it became clear that this is a restaurant that constructs dishes with many elements-- varied ingredients, garnishes, sauces-- it all sounded very ambitious. I ordered the duck, with cherries, brown rice, snow peas, a mustard reduction, and topped with seared foie gras. On the side I ordered a special of various Quebecois mushrooms, apparently in season. Some hearty country-style bread and an excellent local Pilsner tied me over until the main courses arrived. To get to the point, the food was excellent. Better executed, more satisfying, and more delicious than most similarly ""ambitious"" eateries in New York. With all the things happening on the plate, every bite was so well balanced-- savory and sweet in a killer combination. Dessert was also on point. They kindly accommodated my request for a simple bowl of ice cream-- scoops of both homemade sesame and coffee flavors, at once delicate and rich. And as Naomi explained, the chef couldn't just send out two scoops ungarnished, so the bowl had little pansy petals sprinkled on top. I highly recommend the restaurant for those who want to instantly confirm that Montreal is a city with a serious and apparently thriving food culture. And importantly, aside from the food, the atmosphere is convivial and relaxed. It was worth the hike."

Although the quality of the food was quite good, I felt that the portion sizes were quite small, and that is saying something from me! I had the beet salad as a starter, the pork stew with ravioli for a main and the grapefruit mousse for desert. The desert was great but the other two dishes were just good in my opinion. The service was very good and the ambiance was so so. I don't think I will go back soon, not trying to be harsh, but there are lots of other great places to eat in Montreal."

/user_details?userid=S0wtyMwO-7-zzTO8EISvRw,Di F.,"Harrisburg, PA",5 star rating,"Bouillon Bilk is truly a gastronomic gem of Montreal! It's a bit hard to find, tucked away in an otherwise run-down area and un-noteworthy part of town. Francois Nadon is truly one of Montreal's best local chefs and his food exemplifies Montreal cuisine at its best! All the ingredients are sourced locally and the menu changes according to what's available each season. For our dinner, my bf and I ordered the following:[Appetizer] Fraises, cresson, pacanes, crème sûre, quinoa:A salad composed of strawberries, watercress, roasted pecans, sour cream (made from goat cheese according to the english menu), and quinoa. Everything worked so well together on this plate! The strawberries added a bit of sweetness and tartness; the roasted pecans added some depth with its nutty, earthy tones; the goat cheese sour cream worked with the quinoa to smooth out the flavors and bulk up the salad; and finally, the watercress added a bit of crisp and brightness to the palate. A truly fantastic salad![Appetizer] Asperges, langue de veau, vadouvan, morilles, oeuf Asparagus, veal tongue, Vadouvan, morels, and egg (it looked like a quail egg but may have just been a regular chicken egg). I've never had tongue in my life, let alone veal tongue. Not usually an adventurous eater, it took quite a bit of bravery and willpower to stomach the tongue, even though, psychological trauma aside, it was absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked. Everything on the plate was a work of art! The asparagus paired well with the various sauces and purees that decorated the plate, adding a bit of earthy, grassy flavor to an otherwise heavy appetizer. I had never had Vadouvan or morels before; I still can't tell you what Vadouvan tastes like cause it was incorporated so well into the dish, that I don't remember having tasted it; The morel, however, wasn't my thing; I didn't know at the time that it was a mushroom so it just looked like a deformed pickle to me and tasted somewhat pickle-y too. The veal tongue was served on top of a moist, delicious, perfectly cut, square piece of bread and topped with a perfectly round, perfectly cooked sunny-side-up egg. Cutting into it, the egg yolk ran delightfully down over the tongue and bread. There is a certain joy to be taken in beautiful, breathtakingly precise, gastronomic presentations. The tongue tasted like a cross between filet mignon and brisket. [Entree] Roasted baby rooster specialI can't remember what else was in this dish but the rooster was, in my bf's words, ""The best chicken [he's] ever had!"" This dish was a chef special for the night. With crispy, well-seasoned skin, and meat that was so moist it simply fell off the bone. The rooster was a delight![Entree] Canard, foie gras, cerise, kamut, carotteDuck, foie gras, cherry, kamut, carrot. Obviously, foie gras was #1 on my list of things to try in Montreal since it's so hard to come by in the States. This dish, though, was much more than I bargained for! Intensely rich and again, impeccably, expertly cooked, the duck plus the foie gras was enough to constitute two meals in and of itself. The cherries and carrots provided a bit of sweetness to the dish while the kamut (which is a type of grain similar to wheat and rice) provided some substance to ground the fatty goodness of the duck and foie gras. The duck was flavor-rich and browned on the edges while remaining soft and moist on the inside. The foie gras, the spotlight of the dish, was fantastic! (Though not entirely my thing...) It was nicely fried and somewhat crispy on the outside, especially on the edges, which I loved (tasted much like deep fried bacon). The inside, though, was just super fattening. It was definitely delicious and expertly crafted foie gras; I've just decided that foie gras isn't really my cup of tea.[Dessert] Banane, glace sésame, chocolatMy bf got (in english) the banana, sesame ice cream, and chocolate dessert. The banana came dipped in syrup, the sesame ice cream was delightfully creamy, and the chocolate was served both drizzled over the plate and as thinly sliced sesame-covered dark chocolate pieces.[Dessert] Strawberry soup special (with tiny flowers, pieces of melon and cantaloupe, sprouts, and a dollop of frozen yogurt, I think)Again, this was a chef's special for the night so I don't remember all too clearly what was in the dish. It was absolutely delightful though! (And a very welcome light end to an otherwise super heavy meal, seeing as how I ordered both the tongue and the foie gras.) I remember the soup being wonderfully bright and ever-so-subtly sweet, with floral and fruity notes. The frozen yogurt added some substance to the soup, creamy and tart; It was also obviously handcrafted frozen yogurt since I could taste some individual ice crystals (something I loved!).Food: 5/5 -- superb!Service: 5/5 -- top-notch! (the waitress even folded my napkin when I left it on the table to go to the br)Atmosphere: 5/5 -- chic, modern spaceOverall: 5/5"

I actually never had something similar in taste before...also it was kind of a small portion so i was even more hungry than before i walked in the place lol which is a good thing because the main course was incredible. I had the rabit raviolis (ravioli, ricotta, lapin, morilles, têtes de violon, pistaches). It probably one of the best and interesting flavors ive ever had the chance to taste in my life. I think its the first time that i truly enjoyed mushrooms !!

One of the most delicious, decadent, inventive and creative meals I have ever had.  It was a Saturday night and we needed to decide where to eat.  I looked into Yelp and found two reasonable choices near the hotel. Bilk was the closest and had delicious looking pictures.  I called and we luckily landed a table for four at 8:00 pm on a Saturday night.  We started our walk early in order to not to fall asleep while waiting since we drove up the night before from NY. We arrived early and asked if our table was ready. We were about 20 minutes early but luckily there was another table ready for us! yay! We were seated and ready to indulge.  The menu seemed small but it all sounded delicious and special.  The dessert section was as big as the appetizer section.  The entree section was the shortest.  The waiter came by quickly and explained he had a lot to tell us.  When he came by and started expertly telling us the specials, a look of wonder came upon my boyfriend's and his friends face.  The words that were coming out of the waiter's mouth seemed like heaven to them.  There was linguini with a quail egg bacon and, many items with foie gras and other mouth watering items described.  We ordered, the amuse bouche, 5 appetizers and an entree each. The appetizer all came together first, (the waiter forgot the amuse), we were so full and happy with all the appetizers that we did not need the amuse. The appetizer were all creative and delicious.  I felt like a judge on Iron Chef with the privilege to try such inventive yet tasty dishes.  I've eaten at many fancy restaurants in NYC, but so far none as been as wonderful as this experience and for the very affordable price.  The entrees were equally awesone. We all dug in and smiled throughout the wonderful meal. Every bite felt like a flavorful delight to our taste buds.  I mentioned to the waiter that it was ok not to give us the amuse..he apologized for his mistake with a cookie jar of delicious chocolate and white chocolate cookies.  We ordered espresso and a foie gras dessert at the end and it put our meal over the top of awesomeness. The espresso was strong and flavorful and the foie gras dessert was amazing. The pomme cake with foie gras on top was a ridiculously brilliant invention.  Savory and Sweet mashed together into a heavenly taste.  We would come back ready to try this Chef's new menu. As I understand it is always changing but always amazing.  So if you are in Montreal, I highly recommend this restaurant. You will not be disappointed."

The food is good and a reasonable price, but is it a revelation? I think not. There doesn't seem to be a definitive fine dining restaurant in montreal, so don't come expecting a world-class meal . With that said, you will likely have a good time here. If you are in pursuit of the best food, I honestly enjoyed my food more at Joe Beef, but it is less formal there and a different experience."
/user_details?userid=_KEmccOyQLiPW3sMUg_9aw,Ying K.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"This restaurant is basically what I wish Eleven Madison Park in NYC would be. Lots of diverse flavors packed into each dish, but all were well balanced and light. The dishes were very complex, yet tasted somehow simple. Fantastic dining experience and would absolutely come back multiple times. Great atmosphere and good service."

/user_details?userid=v0nLst5k8TOUhwFXZhUoUA,Jennifer G.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",5 star rating,"This place was so cool. I mean, seriously, I felt like I didn't qualify as cool enough to be there. It's an experience and the food is top notch, with unexpected flavors that go amazing well together. It was also very expensive and we puzzled over how the hipsters who were eating there could afford it. We barely could. If you're looking for upscale that is interesting and unstuffy, this should definitely be one of your top three picks in Montreal."

Ended up with the best food i have ever seen in Montreal. We shared snapper sashimi, smoked duck, octopus and pork flank.It was served with grace and joy. All the food displayed great technique, an appreciation of flavours, and was complicated but not fussy.This is a unique resto with a  fun chef and a very special vibe.I wish them great success."
/user_details?userid=9EI94e2iuU7-zWxr05eJGQ,K W.,"Olympia, WA",5 star rating,"so excellent and so not a burger place, as yelp has it listed. both service and food were above and beyond.we arrived a half hour before closed and were uncertain they were still seating but they were very welcoming and seated us. our waitress also informed us apologetically, what they had run out of and that there was only one scallops dish left.we looked over the menu and i decided i wanted to scallops but it was too late! someone else had already ordered them. but maybe it was meant to be because i got giant shrimp with sweetbreads (it's normally lobster but they were out of lobster and said they could do the same dish with the shrimp) and the boyf got ravioli over pulled pork. they were both so good!(i'll add this since there are no dollar sign ratings on this place yet: dinner entrees run from $22 to $29, add glasses of wine, and i'd put this at just making a three-dollar sign rating [$$$].)the ravioli was delicate and not over-salted, with the perfect, light sauce.but my dish was the star! the sauce was rich and buttery, also not too salty, and so so creamy and aromatic. the shrimp were huge and tender, not at all overcooked, as shrimp often is. the sweetbreads were my favorite part. they were seared to perfection with cripsy edges that gave way to softness. we didn't figure out what organ they were. we thought they were maybe brains, from the way they looked, but later found out that brains don't usually qualify as sweetbreads.our water glasses remained filled and we did end up being the last people there, a little past closing time, but our waitress still offered us dessert, which was very sweet (get it?), but we declined so they wouldn't have to stay even longer for us. but if i'm in the area again, i definitely want to try more of their menu."
/user_details?userid=O6ThF87h8jz6Jan5RYdwhg,Bridget W.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I really liked my dessert (the sable) it was definitely the highlight of the meal. In terms of the mains, my scallops arrived cold and over salted, and my boyfriend said his fois gras was just ""fine"". The atmosphere was extremely loud (similar to a high school cafeteria) and it was interesting having my waiter shout the specials at me. Not at all what I would expect at a restaurant of this type but might be fun if you're a large group and not on a date."

We were a party of 6 and everyone loved their dishes, from appetizers to entrees, like salomn, beef..etc...finally desserts! Don't pass on desserts, which is presented artfully. We definitely would come back here the next time we're in Montreal (BTW Old Montreal is wonderful!). Make your reservations and enjoy the phenomenal food!"

/user_details?userid=PJbXrnHk9L0pRtGKr_FkbQ,James F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,This is one of the best food experiences I have ever had in Montreal... or anywhere.  Food quality... A+  Wine list... A+. Service... A+...  There is only one negative. I am all in favour of a trendy / elegant / sparse decor... But please think about adding some sound absorbing materials to the space.    Being able to converse easily with my dinner companions would make this place perfect... 5+ stars.
/user_details?userid=Ot3haUnzoKmC_3DlAnxTHA,Fred B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I am rarely impressed enough by a restaurant to want to take the time to write a review, but in this case I just had to add my voice to the rave reviews. You'll find here a unique combination of a small, friendly-yet-trendy neighborhood restaurant atmosphere on the one hand, and absolutely exquisite, innovative and refined dishes on the other. I went there to celebrate a birthday with a group of close friends, all of whom know the Montreal restaurant scene very well and have travelled extensively. We got to taste most of the dishes on the menu that evening and were blown away. I had the roasted garlic broth and the lobster dish--pure bliss."
/user_details?userid=XJpf3JRg5TDWCvaNPjf4gw,Truth B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Ok, Delta Airlines lost my luggage on my first day in Montreal for the jazz festival. I was hot as in mad as hell, but determined to have a good time. With help from the yelp app on my iPad, I found Bouillon BIlk. Lord have mercy. I had grilled shrimp with foam, fruit puree and beef bone marrow. Doesn't sound good but it was so yummy, I was'nt so upset with Delta. I had a red wine called, Air. It was so mellow and palatable, I almost forgot about my mishandled luggage. Main course was salmon tartar. Wonderful!  Dessert  was white chocolate mouse of some sort. Everything was splendid. Now, if Delta would only find my luggage. But if they  don't, I can say I had one fantastic meal in Montreal."
