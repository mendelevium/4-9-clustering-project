/user_details?userid=hwSSM8Jn29dXRW4ym-roDQ,Mel T.,"Hoboken, NJ",4 star rating,"My BF and I dropped in on a Sunday at around 1:30, when a nearby brunch spot we wanted to try had too long of a line. I'm kind of glad that happened because it led us to this place. All of their food is $5.95!! (not including any add-ons). To start, we had the pierogies, which came with 8 pieces. These were pretty basic but they'll fill you up. For our mains, I went with the mushroom swiss burger. Due to Montreal (or maybe Canada in general?) laws, the beef has to be cooked all the way through, so I couldn't get it at my usual medium-rare. Still, it wasn't bad. The mains also come with your choice of a side salad, soup, fries, or onion rings. I opted for a side salad since he was already getting the french fries with his chicken sammie.For drinks, he had some kind of rose lemonade with gin, that he enjoyed. It was way too sweet for me. I had the Caesar, which is basically Canada's version of a bloody mary. Not bad.Is this the best bar food you will ever eat? Of course not, but for the price, the quality is pretty good."

I want to give 6 stars if possible.First off, $5.95 everything, all day, everyday?!!? Is this even real life???Food: 5VALUE and DELICIOUS! I got a burger, pork chops, and Mac n cheese which were all super fresh, good size portion, and yummy in my tummy. Even when it was busy, it came out after a short wait.(Also, if you like sweet drinks, the Pornstar tastes like a jolly rancher)Service: 5Server was quick and bilingual, no need for us to speak French! When we also ordered drinks, the bartender came by very quickly with the drinks at our table.Atmosphere: 5Dim, high Boise level, good music, not too much seating so you can expect a wait if you come here at peak times. Good space between the tables so you don't have to yell too much 10/10 will want to be back if I find myself in Montreal again!"

This time we got the Asian noodle salad and the Caesar salad.  Both were very good, to the point, that we want to go back and have salads again.   The ribs with fries were not great..  Would not get again. We sat outside on the sidewalk and it was a nice, easy dining experience.If you get there during peak hours, expect a line and a wait.   They do not take AMEX."

Same food, same menu, same decor, but $5.95 for each meal.This location is just as popular, with a line outside the door. Ordered the ''construction'' burger and it was good, I got the tomato soup on the side and it was also good. The reason it's a 3 star is because I think it's too regular tasting now but it is still a great deal."

The sweet potato fries are the best I've ever tried. Don't forget to ask for the mayo. Delicious. They do have a couple of vegetarian options and BELIEVE ME... it worth trying. The service is very friendly and the ambience is the best to come with friends. It Music is very loud, But you'll see that it's part of the whole ambience. Also... It can have a line outside on weekends. So be sure you get early."
/user_details?userid=RVxKR7YHIbtIxR2oFCJjLQ,Jon L.,"Richmond, Canada",3 star rating,"This place.is like el furniture in vancouver bc. A no frills diner with comfort food all for the affordable price of $4.95...Ordered the smoky burger paired with soup . Wife had the fish tacos and had poutine with maple bacon for appys. Burger was great. Not dry. Moist and juicy and portion was awesome. Cheese was perfectly melted. Only thing negative was the bun. In vancouver, they use brioche bun.which was lightly oiled and toasted. Here, it was more like $ store bun. Very dry and stale. I ended up not eating the bread. But the patty was seasoned well and everything else came together. The soup tho tasted weird...it was like a mix.of grits.and cream soup.and garnished with chinese green onions!! So weird!  Maybe the chef was trying a fusion.of some.sort...but let me tell you...it did not work. Fish tacos were awesome. Fish was perfectly breaded and tasty and came with a wedge of lime. The salsa and veggies accompanying the taco filling all complemented the dish. The poutine was awesome. Fries nice and crispy...curds were aplenty and creamy...maple bacon was generously sprinkled on top. The sweetness of the maple and saltiness of the bacon...complemented the gravy curds and fries magically. Definitely a must have. Service was great. Iit was quick and spot onFor price and value ration: a must try for sure. A nice and affordable place.given the chic neighborhood of mont royal.Happy eating!"

/user_details?userid=6UJPdr0y8UDtylRHpSKAqw,Sneha S.,"Los Gatos, CA",4 star rating,Amazing food! Very unassuming place with a college crowd. Everything is cheap which is why we thought the food wouldn't be good but we were wrong. This has one of the nicest veggie penne pastas that I've ever had. Nice touch with the sundries tomatoes. The drinks were cheap too. The starters however weren't good. They give you an option to donate a meal to the less fortunate which we did.
/user_details?userid=gjB4ORFO2LDOOSjS5wuTGw,Katie F.,"Miami, FL",4 star rating,"As tourists all the way from Miami, FL, my boyfriend and I really enjoyed this bar/restaurant that we randomly found through a quick yelp search while being in the area. I'm a food blogger that focuses on affordable eats so when I saw that the whole menu was just $5.95 I just had to try it. We sat inside since the patio was closing when we got there and ordered some cocktails that were definitely to our liking. Based upon our lovely servers recommendation, we went for the union street noodle salad and the calamari for an appetizer. We absolutely loved the noodle salad that was refreshing and a large portion size. The calamari was definitely lacking and I regret getting it over a burger which from glancing around at other tables looked delicious! I would still highly recommend stopping in if you're looking for a meal for a great price since it was still an awesome restaurant and the video dj was killing it! IG: @KFitzEats"

/user_details?userid=theKAKaqiAGsLhpSyXBtSQ,Triston J.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"I had two epiphanies while here. First is, ever since I used VR I haven't exactly shaken the feeling that I'm in VR. When I was 19 I had a life changing experience. I was watching Eckhart Tolle and long story short I was sent into an all consuming and entirely convincing experience that I was one with everything. That I was God, and everyone around me was too. It was an altered state of consciousness. I didn't need to eat or sleep much. Everything around me was intimately beautiful and I was it. After four days of this state, I switched from my Journalism program to psychology, and pursued a new life in Montreal, feeling reinvigorated and reborn. But part of that experience is a disillusionment. You recognize that you've been living in a simulation. It's an experience of waking up. So since I ""came down"" as long as I'm not in that state of consciousness I have this latent sense of fakeness in regards to everything. Makes me feel psychotic sometimes. Anyways.VR is like simulation inception for me and can be shocking. I've been doing more psychedelics and I can get into this crazy space of unreality and it's been pretty scary.So I really untangled that. Thank y'all so much  L'entrepōt. My second epiphany was that I NEVER understood what people meant when they referred to drinking after a hangover as ""hair of the dog."" I simply never completed that idiom... hair of the dog that bit you! Wow. Always complete the idiom. Food was great but the waitress was better! She was so real! Just not playing into the whole ""waitress"" thing. I liked it.My friend (the painter one) also has some opinions:"" I like it. Last time I was here i sat inside it was too loud, now that I'm outside on the patio noise isn't a problem. I think I am allergic to gluten """

We were skeptical to try it when we saw that everything on the menu was for $5, thinking it may just taste like regular bar food and we would be disappointed. We decided to order three things from the menu but were pleasantly surprised at the huge portions and the great taste. We have had their tacos, burgers and pasta so far and everything has been consistently good. Turns out this place has the best comfort food and quickest service in the area."

/user_details?userid=jImKbs4In8xg5c73Gb0NTQ,Eric C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Good burger for the price but the potato with skin were not tasty, though the portion size was generous. This is the restaurant selling point; all dishes are priced at 4,95 making this place very popular with young people. Drinks are offered at different price, but the cocktail I ordered had practically no alcohol; your luck may vary depending on the barman. Music selection was great during my visit, but make sure you arrive early as the restaurant will get crowded and loud on evenings. They have several tables outside if you enjoy the sun or Avenue Mont-Royal wildlife.Certainly a great place if you need to invite friends and want to save money on food, perhaps less on drinks; or you are feeling festive."

/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,This place always has a lineup when I walk by so i wanted to check it out and see what all the hype was about. I loved it!! I went on a monday and sat at the bar with a friend. The crowd is young and a bit loud so if it's not your scene don't go! It makes sense that the crowd is mostly under 30 since the food is only $5. These guys next to us were doing shot after shot! So fun! The food was pretty damn good too! I had poutine with bacon . No complaints here. Bacon was good. My friend had the chicken ranch wrap. I was really impressed with his plate. It was delicious! It came with a side of salad or fries and he chose the salad. For drinks I had a double Bloody Caesar of course. It was pretty decent. The drinks are normal bar prices though. I then proceeded to have two gin and tonics and it was regular. I would go back to this place if i was in the area and if the lineup wasn't too long! Food was good and so cheap! The bartenders were really funny and nice too. One was teaching me how to whistle with a straw.

/user_details?userid=wio2PT99Eth_4Kf0MynIDw,Aron G.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I visited L'Entrepôt for the second time, last night after a Yelp event, accompanied by a few Yelp friends.  I like L'Entrepôt for a few reasons, everything is $4.95, there are a bunch of vegetarian options, and the place is open until 3 AM.  The first time I went, I only had dessert - a fried apple pie with vanilla ice cream - that was delicious!  I was excited to come back and try a whole meal.We arrived around 10 PM Wednesday night, and the place was packed, there was a bit of a lineup but we were able to wait inside.  We were a party of four, but we didn't have to wait very long to be seated, and we were quickly and attentively served by the staff.We started with a shared order of pierogies, a plate of 8.  I liked the presentation, but we found them a little doughy.I initially ordered a Mac and Cheese, as did one of my companions, but due to some honest confusion only one was brought.  Luckily I was able to try some of it nevertheless.  I found it to be a little uninspiring, I was hoping for more flavour in the sauce.  The dish was a little spicy, and the kick was welcome, but not enough to really impress me.This gave me the opportunity to order a different dish - the vegetarian quesadillas.  I found these to be much more enjoyable.  There was a good variety of vegetables, even green beans to my surprise, giving a nice flavour palette to the dish.  Coupled with tasty sour cream and a piquant salsa, it was a success!My companions ordered salads, a poutine, and a burger.  I can't speak for those items, so you'll have to wait for their reviews :).For dessert I had the fried apple pie with ice cream, it was pretty good but not quite as awesome as I remembered.  The ice cream, however, definitely lived up to my high expectations.In terms of the ambiance, I found it to be loud and dark, like many late-night bars.  It's not my preference, and sitting right beneath a loudspeaker didn't help either when trying to have a conversation, but this is the nature of the beast, and I've had worse.  I only mention this so you know what to expect, not a real negative.We all enjoyed the majority of the playlist that consisted mainly of 90's and 00's rap, with a smattering of pop from other eras.  You can never go wrong with James Brown's ""Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine"" ;P.  I had a lot of fun singing along with half-remembered Eminem and House of Pain lyrics, and I wasn't the only one :P.Cash, credit, and debit are all welcome here.  All in all, I think it was a pretty good experience, and I will definitely be coming back."
/user_details?userid=OvkB2G-ZLhwocrIprjaYDw,Sara B.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"This deserves 5 stars for what it is. I'm all for accessible food and this place delivers! With 2 entrees and 2 drinks per person (and a shared dessert), this meal came out to $25 a head. The quality of our meals was well above average and they were very decently sized. We certainly didn't leave hungry... or thirsty, the drinks were also very very generous! This place has something for everyone, including vegans and the health-concious.The interior was dark and crowded. You should be ready to wait in line on the weekend for dinner. The music was pretty loud but either we adjusted or they lowered it after a while. There's a fun modern jukebox to play around with so at least you can choose what super loud music you want to hear. The service was also very good and checked on us consistently. Overall, I definitely recommend this place for a casual night out!"
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Location: Mont-Royal corner Boyer. Street parking available but metered. Most residential streets are zoned so keep your eyeballs peeled for any restrictions. The closest subway is probably Mont-Royal (orange) and it'll be a 10-minute walk from there.The place: I think I've had L'Entrepot bookmarked for like, a year - so it was about time I got my arse over there. I really like the feel of the place - it's very pub-like and dimly lit, super casual, no-frills and no superficial bullsh*t. Also, not a hipster in sight. SUCCESS! They've got booths and tables as well as bar seating (I might be making that last part up though). The goods: One might feel a little suspicious about the quality of the food served here, since all dishes are $5. Yep, you read that right - FIVE DOLLARS. But have no fear - despite the cheap eats, the food is amazing! I ordered the turkey sandwich on cranberry bread, sans fromage, with bacon (extra) and fries. Loved it. The portion was quite substantial, the bread was fresh and the peppered fries were crispy and tasty. The bacon was lacking flavour but I can live with that. My friend had the tacos and loved them. Good food all around.Service: Quick and friendly!Price point: Like I said, $5 for everything except drinks, and the assorted extras. Check it!"

I have tried the queso, tacos, beet and goat cheese salad, calamari, and the braised beef sandwich. All were decent relative to the price but nothing too special. The calamari were overly breaded/fried and the tacos were fairly plan. I really liked the queso trempette though!They kind of get you with the price of the drinks (have to make money somewhere).

Just straight up cheap as dirt food that ""hit's the spot"".The staff is young ""Le Plateau"" french people, not be confused with nearby Mile-End consisting of a lot of hipster duffus...not that there's anything wrong with that!

It's written on the menu! Which should be done right after you get your meal, so not to mess with his original buzz and mess your food.$5 menu?Nothing else to say.$5!That's it. Try it.

I also ordered the SALADE DE NOUILLES ASIATIQUE wooooow it was huge for just 5$ damnnn how impressive. My friend also had their mac & cheese that I tried and was so succulently delicious. The service was very quick and satisfying. The atmosphere was great a lot of throwback 80's& 90's music hehe amazing just a little too loud as it turns out into a bar/ club at night. We couldnt hear each other talk very well and have to say it was noisy. It's not the best place to take you date to but if you plan to chill and enjoy yourself with a group of friends on a night out it's definitely a great choice.Overall, it was super amazing good music, laughs and giggles.

Good service sometimes. Drinks are great! But its easy to get carried away  since the food is 4.95$ ...the drinks are regular price between 7 and 14$ so if you are having more than one drink your bill can surprise you.  Upside down corona in pink lemonade is my fav drink so far...looking forward to trying more.  I ordered chicken nachos and soft tacos for my friend.

We went for a late dinner as not much was open and the place was recommended. There was no wait, we walked right in and were seated. It's a dive bar where the younger (just turned 18) locals flock to. The place was full and everyone seemed to be having a great time. It was a bit dark and dungeon-like. The music was amazing but way too loud for us older folks lol. We had to scream at each other to have a conversation. So the prices are great, 5.95 for any entree. But remember, you get what you pay for. It was late so they didn't have much left to pick from. I had mac and cheese (don't do that) and my husband had the burger. It tasted like frozen microwaveable meals. We were not surprised  though. Overall the worst meal in Montreal during our 6 day trip. I ordered two drinks, both doubles, tasty, but I don't think there was any alcohol in them. In the end, we ate fast got out quick, and went in search of a more appropriate establishment for dessert and night cap. That's another review..."

You can't expect first class food for 4.95$. However, compared to the sister restaurant on Crescent, the service and atmosphere was much better. It is a good place for a quick bite with a friend or group. The service was relatively quick and our waitress was pleasant. I shared the quesadilla and Caesar salad wrap with my friend. The quesadilla was pretty soggy and was falling apart while the wrap was pretty yummy. The fries were tasteless and had clearly been frozen. It's more of a bar with music and music videos playing on the many flat screen TVs. It was packed on a Wednesday night and we waited in line for 10 minutes at 11:00pm.

Definitely not a spot to take your date or to catch up with a friend - at least not at night! The food is very good, I was pleasantly surprised as every dish is $5. Yes, you read it right $5 only, AND they don't skimp on the quantity and quality. I took the spaghetti with tomato sauce with braised beef and parmesan. It was scrumptious, I would definitely order it again. I recommend the cheese and spinach dip as well but it's quite rich, it's best to share with someone.  My friend ordered the pierogies and I was jealous. They are tender pieces of fluffy goodness - the perfect comfort food!I was surprised with their cocktails. Not only are they cheap too at $6.50 but they're very tasty and original.Their sour key drink was a hit for all my friends and I.

I have been here several times and I'm pleasantly surprised with the size of the dish every time. It's not gourmet food - but for 5$ you should not expect it to be! Drinks are priced like every other bar around. During lunch (weekend) and dinner there is always a line. They have a take our option - but it costs more (?!), and the one time we tried it - it took more than half an hour to get the food - and we could have gotten a table by then anyway. The Quebec version - Le bureau de post - has the exact same menu - with different design but similar ambiance. I can recommend everything that I have tried so far (except the poutine - it's not very good, but there is plenty of selection otherwise).Good for both vegetarians and carnivores."

Maybe I'm biased because I ate at Cinko first and fell in love but although the price point is the same ($5 for everything on the menu) the experience is a lot different.Upon approaching the restaurant we already saw a lineup that didn't seem to be moving. It took us about 30 or more minutes to finally nab a seat. Once inside the service was incredibly slow but drinks came faster than our food. They had music videos playing loud for music and it was definitely a younger crowd. We both ordered quesadillas and the food was satisfactory. But we can't complain because of the price point. That being said I'd recommend Cinko on St Denis for a better experience.
/user_details?userid=yRB4UrgnLs3BxbVM1QQ0Gw,Sababa S.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,The drinks are really expensive. The waiters were all french-speaking and im not. One of the bartenders made an announcement (i guesss he made a joke) in french and then everybody started laughing (everybody in the restaurant) except me and my friend because we didn't understand a word of it. I had never felt so left out and foreign in my life.

Our B&B guy was so excited about it though so we decided to give it a try. Big mistake. We had to wait awhile to sit outside, but it was so nice out we didn't mind. Once I went inside I was really glad we waited. The prices are super cheap. I think that's the only good thing about it. The service was horrific. It was slow, but then it became obvious that the waitress just forgot our food. We complaigned that tables that came after us got their food first. The waitress didn't seem concerned at all and never apologized. When we got the food it was obvious it had been sitting under lights for awhile. It was okay, but nothing great. I'd skip unless you are trying to save money."

If you order an alcoholic beverage you have to order food as well from the menu due to their liquor license which we were unaware of, we originally wanted just drinks. We ordered off the only menu they had which is $6.95 for each item on it.We got the chicken tacos which I enjoyed, the pierogis which were ok wouldn't order them again, chicken fingers were ok, grilled cheese and tomato soup was good, also the Asian noodle salads were very good! Attached picture of our pierogis.We enjoyed the music very much, played today's hip hop hits which right now are drake and other artists. Unfortunately the outside patio was closed because it rained that morning but it looks like a nice spot to sit at as well, inside is much darker.Overall ok food, good to pop into for a quick bite and drink if you want both. 4 stars for pub food, not anything gourmet."

The quality is slightly below ordinary, the music is way too loud (you cannot hear the people across from you at the table), the line is usually an hour long and the service in the restaurant takes for ever as well.

The first time I went, I didn't expect much from a $5 menu, and was surprised in a really good way. I tried the mac&cheese, a few burgers, and the donuts. All of them were quite good. Drinks are also quite abordable (beers starting at $5, cockails at around $6 if I remember well).This place is always busy by the way, except during lunch. So I recommend you to go there during lunch. If you still want to got at night, expect to wait around 30 minutes or more (waited around 40 minutes last time I went there, worth it though)."
/user_details?userid=ZGiwU16rhGvWAYUzkWL0xw,Boz X.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We got there around midnight and the place was so packed we (3 people) squeezed in a table for two. The music was loud af you have to yell on top of your lungs to get your conversation - any sound waves - across the table. Thankfully though, you can, in turn, select what goes into the speakers from the jukebox where you could play some Canadian classic such as 'Boyfriend' by Justin Bieber. As for food, even at 4.95$ a dish (dirt cheap), I still feel like I've been underwhelmed on most parts other than the salt profile: everything (including the sauce and soup) was saturated with NaCl (or sodium chloride for non-chemists; table salt for scientifically-illiterates). I felt like I was walking Bob, my chihuahua, down in New Orleans during hurricane season, where Bob and I involuntarily swallow a couple liters of sea water each  -- except at L'entrepot, t'was a torrent of iodized table salt and no water (very busy night, despite the numbers of waiters).Well that's that on the saltiness, other than that...5$ maple glazed onion rings sounded like a nice deal until you realize it's just a fancy name with no maple taste or maple what-so-ever. In fact, it's regular onion rings with a thin coating of burnt sugar.The burgers, namely the 'constructeur', the 'BBQ fumé', and the 'Swiss aux champignons' had cheap patties that 'felt like Harvey's'. In terms of dressing, I'd take a bacon McDouble over the 'constructeur' any day of the week (excluding weekends cuz I might be drunk enough to not mind). With this kind of a review, why I am still giving out 3 stars? Because the place was full while the streets were empty and people seemed upbeat despite the plated salt and music (Boyfriend) by a Canadian literary genius. It's hard to argue with success."

First of all, the place wasn't packed at all, but oh my was the service SLOW. We waited 40 minutes for a salad and pasta... Our waitress never showed up to ask us how the food was and i had to grab a bus boy to ask him for some water while waiting for our drinks... Now i wouldn't have mind if the food was good. I know its 5$, so already, i wasn't expecting much. but wow was it disappointing. I got the beet salad and the rose pasta, the salad was INCREDIBLY salty, it wasnt edible. I thought maybe it was just me, but the girls sitting next to our table got the same salad and she had the same reaction, wasnt able to eat her salad. So hey, i guess it wasnt me. Normally, i wouldve asked for something else, but i did not feel like waiting another 40 minutes, and more importantly, go on a search for our waiter. I asked someone, not our waiter, for our receipt, and he told us he was going to grab our waiter to ask her to come see us...um waited another 15 minutes with no receipt. When i finally flagged the same person, clearly showing that im unhappy and still waiting, he brought us the receipt himself. Overall, just go to Cinko, food is much better, so is the service."

It's a super sweet deal, and the place has a lot of charm. We'll definitely be back.Edit- you've just lost a star: Came back with a friend for drinks... Definitely not as good as last time. Minimal glaze on the onion rings, the potato skins had sparse toppings, and the hard shell of the tacos were STALE.

Discovered it a few weeks ago through my girlfriend, she told me everything on the menu is $5 and everyone she went with really enjoyed the food (especially the donuts - I was told they were fighting over the last one! Haha) I'm vegetarian, so when I took a look at the menu I was pleased to see that there were tons of options for me to choose from. From quesadillas, to tacos, to pasta, to nachos - even a veggie burger! That was the holy grail for me. I was incredibly curious since I've never had a veggie burger not made by myself from anywhere but Harvey's and decided to try it out. Let me tell you... It was BOMB. Harvey's can't even begin to compare. This is the best veggie burger I've had in my life. The brioche bun is toasted perfectly, has an incredible texture, the corn salsa is such a unique touch that adds a kick, the avocado makes everything so smooth, the cheddar adds excellent flavour, doesn't taste fake or processed (I have an intolerance to dairy so I've had the burger without the cheese and it was still amazing), the macho sauce is the perfect condiment, and overall its just... Well, everything you'd want in a burger. It feels so right. Not to mention, the side salad has such a great dressing. Yam fries are on f*cking point, as well as the donuts. I've never found a place with such satisfying texture for all of their items. Add the price into the mix and L'entrepôt beats just about any place I can think of. Worth the waiting time (which has never been too long for me) and DEFINITELY beyond worth the price. The flavours work so well together. Everything is seasoned wonderfully. You can tell they care about the quality of their food. The chefs know what they're doing! Well done to everyone working in the kitchen!"

I didn't have high hopes for a restaurant where everything on the menu is $5. They gotta cut costs somewhere, right? Apparently not here. I'd have to say, if they did, it's in their mixed drinks. My friend and I both got mixed drinks, she got a blue caracao drink, and I got a sangria. Neither of us could taste any alcohol in our drinks. So it was basically $7 fruit juice, I'd suggest getting something bottled if you opt to grab a drink with dinner. I got the Chiang noodles entree. A little spicy for my preference, but I have a low tolerance. It was delicious though. One of my friends got a grilled cheese, which much to her dismay did not have melted cheese. Maybe that's only in America? Not sure, but the bread was delicious, the cold cheese was just off-putting. My other friend got the braised beef spaghetti, which was, again, delicious.

Definitely the best pasta I've had in awhile!! I also ordered a drink, ""Bulldog"" and it was obvious the bartender didn't know how to make it. He flipped through some printed out pages by the register before just looking right at the menu and using that to guide him.

The theme was cool inside - had a skater vibe going on. They were playing throwback rap jams on the television which is always entertaining. Understandably, the food took a while to come out and the portion sizes are what you expect for the price. The only thing that took away from my experience was that our waitress was rude to my group. I understand that the place was busy, but as somebody who has worked at a restaurant, you should always treat the customer with respect. They certainly don't deserve the attitude. My friend ordered a Negroni, but she brought over a Corona. It was an honest mistake, as the restaurant was loud when ordering, but when he told the waitress that he had ordered a Negroni, she said ""No, that's not what you said - you said Corona"" in a very rude manner. I heard my friend say Negroni as well, but regardless, who is she to say what my friend said? I would recommend the owner to have a small meeting with the staff, as it seems other reviewers have occasionally received rude comments.

First of all, we went for lunch and was guided to the table away from the windows and the room was pitch black at 11AM, I understand it is a bar but get some lighting at least for lunch time? Food was quick to arrive and the waitress was nice enough. We have ordered their noodle salad, potato skins and penne pasta for two people, and frankly, even though the proportions were impressive, all the dishes weren't properly seasoned. The potato skins was blunt, even with bacon and cheese and sour cream on top, it still manage to be very blunt. Their noodle salad was so salty and tasted maybe with a hint of soya sauce? The greens in the salad had no seasoning what so ever (maybe it was meant to be eaten with the noodles but believe me, I tried, and ended up with just a bad taste of leaf and salt). Coming from an Asian background myself, some sesame oil and black vinegar would have helped that dish a lot. The sauce of the penne pasta was so heavy, way too much oil and creme. Their peach ice tea was so watered down when it came and tasted not much more than water. Overall: was it cheap? YesWere the portion big? YesDid it taste good? Not really"

I ordered a raspberry mojito that was refreshing and light, and my boyfriend ordered a Jack and Coke, which he claims was the best he's ever had. Considering the price per meal, the portions were well sized. The only downfall of this place is that it was very crowded, even for a Tuesday night. But I definitely recommend this place for anyone visiting the area!!!"

Don't go expecting fine dining, but it's far better than you'd expect at 5$ a plate. The bar food options are the best IMO. The smokey wings are delicious, the burgers hit the spot, and the peppered fries are a nice touch. The tacos are a little boring but the beef is well seasoned. The salads can be a little disappointing (the Beet Salad for example skimps on the beets) but again, at 5$ a pop, it's all much better than you'd expect. Avoid peak hours (6-9) though as it gets busy and the line is poorly managed. But once you're in the service is great, with friendly, smiling staff."

I love everything that I had the chance to try there. The atmosphere is fun, there was great music and nice servers. I definitely want to go back!"
