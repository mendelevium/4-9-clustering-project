They specialise in soup noodles and you can choose the kind of soup, the noodle, some toppings and a drink for only 13.50$. This time, i tried the laksa. It was not too spicy but had a lot of flavor. The vermicelli were perfectly cooked. I got it with fish slices and a sausage. The sausage was grilled to perfection and there were a lot of fish slices in it. I took a HK milk tea. It was very good and creamy but the tea was definitely too strong for me. There are plenty of parking outside. The wait time was a bit long on their first day so hopefully it will get better with time. Although you can only do takeout for now, the broth is still hot after a while and the food is still delicious."

Set menus including milk tea or coffee. Ordered original fish soup customized with two toppings ( took tender beef brisket and mushroom pork meatballs), beef brisket curry and added fried pork cutlet. Everything was yummy even after reheat (air fryer/microwave and stove)!"

They specialize in soup based noodles, Everything from Alexa coconut soup base to A spicy Szechuan base. For only $13.50 you get to choose your soup base the type of noodles that you like and multiple toppings that are included in the price. If you'd like to add an extra egg fried egg soft boiled egg it's an 1$. They also offer side orders of fried chicken rice cakes etc. All the sides are very affordable.Crowd of people who aren't looking for a soup base dinner third offer A westernized menu for 12.75$. It's also very customizable from ox sliced tongue to fried pork chops. We ordered the laksa soup , the deep fried pork chop with rice, Bacon and onion cream sauce and The sausage luncheon meat and pan fried egg. You could substitute the rice for spaghetti or penne for a dollar extra.For the price of the laksa soup there is a lot of ingredients inside a lot of vegetables the noodles are good portion very filling. I'm normally not a fan of coconut but the laksa soup was very good it wasn't overly potent with the coconut taste. The deep fried pork chop were really good and crispy and still moist and not dry inside the sauce was thickWent really well with the pork chops.Every order comes with coffee or tea milk tea to be exact. You can have the choice of adding a specialty drink for only $2 which is an incredible price! For the drinks we ordered the apple milk tea and a mango milk tea. They were both really good really refreshing! (It doesn't come with bubble it's an extra charge for it)If you purchased either Western menu or a soup I suggest I recommend also grabbing a drink for2$ it's truly worth it for the price and the size. Also while you're waiting they give you a small cup of toasted walnuts to snack on which is nice, thoughtful And different from other restaurants.Every meal comes with a milk tea unsweetened they give you sugar to add to your liking.Highly recommend this place"

It came with one bowl of rice, but you can literally have 5 with the Malaysian style curry. Yea, it's that gooooood.HK Style lemon tea, it isn't the best but certainly something I missed from any restaurant in mtl.Laksa soup rice, it smell soooooo good, you can actually have it with noodles but my wife chose rice, not a bad choice though. She said it's so tasty that she could taste all the ingredient.The spicy beef tongue... It's not my thing I didn't eat, but she said it's good so... OK.. LolHK style milk tea... That I must say was surprisingly good. It's so smooth, milk and tea ratio perfectly balanced.Overall food is a 4/5, that I think it's due to take out, if we could have it fresh right at the restaurant I'm confident it will taste better.Price, I find it a bit high but I think there's a reason to it... Deer Garden Signature is actually a well known franchise that keeps high standard on their food quality. So for that, I'm okay with the price VS values.Now, my closing question... Will I go again?Well I already planned to go back tomorrow for another round of curry lol"
