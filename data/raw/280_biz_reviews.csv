We were peckish and didn't want anything too heavy- and this place hit the mark. The hot dogs are LEGIT- not overly fancy and overdecorated like you sometimes see- it's like an elevated DELICIOUS La Belle Pro, with drinks. Free unlimited popcorn with a pitcher. Great place to stop in for a quick snack and drink!"

Turned out that the had a vegetarian sub, which is not always a given, so we decided to give it a try. We ordered the Beyond Meat sub and an order of onion rings. I have to say that the sub was by far the best sub I've had since I stopped eating meat. It was juicy, messy and everything that a good sub should be. My only suggestion would be for them to add some saut√©ed mushrooms. As for the onion rings they were also awesome. Perfectly cooked, really crispy and exceptionally tasty."
