/user_details?userid=Pm4mT5MZAbDOMxgLD8JW3w,Wei L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I'm a regular costumer of this warming and lovely Japanese style restaurant. At this special period, it is better to choose the delivery method if you miss this taste. There are varied dishes in both Taiwanese and Japanese styles. The owner spent much time on the menu design and new dishes creation at the same time. Ramen is really my pick in the recent past 3 months."
/user_details?userid=vTsbejwscDEdA3Ao_aIQMg,Lawrie S.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Came here to grab a quick dinner and catch up with a friend. Neither of us had heard of this place but were excited to try Japanese fusion and walked right in. The inside is very clean and freshly decorated with plants along the walls. The staff was very nice and greeted us right away, bringing us the menu that resembles a photo album with pictures on one side of the menu and a description on the other side.We ordered the okonomiyaki to share (pork pancake which they made vegetarian upon request). It arrived after our main dish but was nice and hot. The flavour was good and a nice addition to the dish. I had the gyu don (beef rice bowl) the beef was very flavourful and it was filling.We finished with a brown sugar ginger tea. The waitress explained the concept to us: you receive a mug of hot water and a rock made of ginger and brown sugar with a spoon. You let the rock dissolve to the sweetness/flavour you would like. You can remove the rock when you want and she will keep filling up your mug until you're done. It was so nice to end with this hot drink on this cold winter night! The whole meal was less than $25 and we left feeling very satisfied!"
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We ordered the Torikatsu & Gyu Don (Beef Bowl). Food tasted great. However it was definitely a day + old. The beef, chicken & vegetables were not fresh & that really turned us off the entire meal. The taste was like a good home cooked meal but felt like we were eating leftovers from the previous day. We will not be ordering from here again, nor would I recommend anyone to order from a place that uses days old meat or ingredients."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We tried the torikatsu, gyudon, the tomyum as well as yam fries and other appetizers. They were all delicious and the rice bowl were nicely presented. The torikatsu was very crunchy but a bit dry and it was laid on a huge bowl of rice and unflavored lettuce. The gyudon's meat was very flavorful and well marinated. The tomyum was good but it felt like eating those instant powdered ones. The service is great. The food comes quickly and the staff is nice. The place is very small with only a few seats so it's quite possible that there won't be any available. However, it's a good place to grab a quick lunch if you're on a budget but still want something nice."
/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"I had dinner here with my husband and we both really enjoyed it. It's a small restaurant that has a natural/green feeling to it. It looks like it used to be one of those places that just sells salads or a tiny cafe (?) Anyway, it's super cute. We ordered the popcorn chicken to share ($6) and I had the Gyu Don ($11) and my husband had the Torikatsu ($11). The popcorn chicken was good, but was a bit salty for my tastes. It was dark meat, so not as lean as I would have liked, but still enjoyable. I really liked my Gyu Don. I asked for no corn and no sesame seeds and my dish came as requested. It was a bed of rice, shredded cabbage, shredded carrots, half an egg, and thinly sliced beef. I loved that the beef was lean and not all fatty and gristly like at some places. The meat was also tender and well marinated. The rice was a bit sticky, which I liked. The cabbage and carrots were finely shredded and at first I thought there was too much dressing, but it ended up being ok. The egg was tasty, but for some reason was cold. Is it supposed to be cold? I don't know. I was expecting it to be hot like the rice and beef. I had a taste of my husband's dish, which was essentially like mine, except his protein was a breaded chicken breast. We requested no sesame seeds with his dish too, so I could try some, and he was ok with corn, so got corn with his meal. The Torikatsu does not come with half an egg though.I had a piece of the Torikatsu and it was good. I liked the lean chicken breast and the breading was tasty. Service was very nice, friendly and attentive. The server came and refilled our empty water glasses several times without prompting. We got our food fairly quickly too. You pay at the cash register when you are done.Really cute spot. I would definitely recommend it for some quick and cheap Japanese food."
/user_details?userid=Mt-_SvJyDirR9fpZx9dbEw,Tommy S.,"Bellevue, WA",4 star rating,"Came here for lunch and the experience was very ordinary.As soon as I entered the establishment, I was greeted by a cheerful waitress who ushered me to a table and handed me menus. There were only two other patrons at the time, so service was swift and attentive. I ordered the chicken curry katsu dish and a hot sugar/ginger/osmanthus tea; the total came to about 20$ after taxes and tips. The tea was interesting because we had to infuse it ourselves: we were served with a cup of hot water and, on the side, a mixture of the concentrated tea ""dough"" that looked like a piece of gingerbread cookie that we had to break apart and mix with the hot water. My appetite did open after taking a few sips. It was not bad, but not out of this world either.The katsu arrived at a reasonable delay, and looked appropriately delectable. I was somewhat disappointed because the katsu was concurrently crispy and mushy because some the meat was overly drenched and saturated in the curry. I would have preferred more substantive ingredients such as meat or vegetables, and less rice. To be fair, the food was not bad. Nonetheless, it's nothing to write home about.Overall, it was a positive experience, and I do not regret trying this restaurant. However, I would not go out of my way to return."
/user_details?userid=uYyfXuaimxhvRuT6hEtIWg,Gia Loc D.,"Mont-Royal, Canada",4 star rating,"Torikatsu Japanese rice bowl * Chicken has quite a good crispy and juicy bite * Sauce was sweet and soya based * Veggies were shredded cabbage and a sprinkle of corn * Generally, great flavours. good balance between sweet and salty. * Decent price for the portions you get, especially that it is located in downtown. Tasted very homemade versus fast food = good quality meal"

/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This review is will be part shout out (to this stand out in the midst of the construction fences and signs that might drive those not in-the-know away) and part overview. Either way - I think you'll feel me on why I give five.To start off, just show up. Believe me you can do it, you can walk besides the construction fence (I hope it will be down by now, and you'll be like what fence - trust me they endured a lot of fence time) via the sidewalk and up the stairs - take the door on the left - the door on the right is Pizza Hut.When you seen what's inside; the light coloured décor, open concept and the authenticity you'll be glad you did. You won't find a chain or cookie cutter look/feel or menu here - what you will get is a focused menu of specialties, smells of delight wafting out of the open kitchen, and enough Zen energy to keep your day going on the right foot. Come alone and sit at the counter or bring a friend or two. Regardless, you'll be treated kindly and leave with a happy belly.One of their specialties - 'donburi' bowls (it's kind of in their name ;-) - will not disappoint, and almost look too good to eat. But eat them you shall, and with a cup of proper tea you'll have the kick you need to go back to work or study or both. I guess it won't be too hard to tell by reading this review - me likes."

/user_details?userid=9wsWryy58qIezVd82W3fEg,Eve A.,"Cypress, CA",3 star rating,"In a city that is lacking a variety of Asian cuisine, this place is very welcome.  However, as someone who is familiar with Asian food, I was not very impressed nor comforted by this place during my trip to Montreal.It is a little difficult to find.  The entrance is at the side of the building along with a couple other small restaurants.  You need to kind of walk into a tiny almost alleyway to ge yo the door.The restaurant itself is small but cute. It's very well decorated.  The food is very presentable as well.  My issue was with the taste.  It was too salty for me. Another issue I had was when one of the servers walked by, I got a strong whiff of cigarette smoke.  I can only hope she is at least washing her hands thoroughly before serving the customers.A+ for effort though."
/user_details?userid=VtiHkMISkk69btfo_s0cYw,Luis G.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Small restaurant and coffee shop with a nice variety of donburi. I especially liked the atmosphere and the tasty food. The chai lemonade together with the gyudon bowl I took made for a great dinner.

Whole meal with tax and tip cost me 26 bux.1 hr after leavin the restaurant,i m feelin thirsty as hell n dizzy,maybe msg or something?Food looks good but Not worth it and won't return"
/user_details?userid=Xlqxirfs1rZogrv2tukNqw,Jane L.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"This little Japanese restaurant is so charming and has the most innovative and delicious cuisine. So far, I have not seen something come out of the kitchen that hasn't made my mouth water! The bowls are all great - my favorite being the torikatsu (breaded chicken). Also, the matcha lava cake with ice cream is to die for."
/user_details?userid=apg4zq2NocVW49x6YQA3iA,Neel L.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"As soon as you walk in, you'll notice how nice the restaurant is. It's clean, quaint and very aesthetically pleasing. I've had their beef and pork rice bowls. Although the meat is very nicely seasoned, they don't give you much of it and the other veggies in the bowl are pretty much raw and unseasoned which make it quite bland. Although its very nicely presented, I don't find it too flavorful taste-wise but at least it's healthy!"
/user_details?userid=z03qroysMrMEAZi84QMfUQ,Jimmy H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I have heard about this place for a while among my friends and I haven't had a chance to try it until now. For the price/food quality/service, this is a place that's both worth the visit if you live far or visit regularly if you live near.It is a cute little restaurant on bishop and it's unfortunate that it is blocked behind all the Montreal construction, but hopefully Montreal government will do something about that ( we all know that it's going to years lol ). As soon as me and my friend entered the restaurant, we were greeted by the friendly waitress and we picked a seat near the window. The food came in a very reasonable time which is great. I ordered the Taiwanese cold noodle. The sauce is a very authentic Taiwanese cold noodle sauce (I'm Taiwanese) and there are sliced fried eggs, diced carrots, bean sprouts and sliced cucumber, definitely way more toppings than what you normally get in Taiwan which is AWESOME, the only thing that I would change is that the carrots are not in slices when the other toppings are but it doesn't affect the taste. My friend ordered the Yakidon and it was really good and well seasoned. I would recommend this place to anyone."
/user_details?userid=JrTsaMac8BnAkLuJ3MfGzA,Aileen L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"ATMOSPHERE: The thing that stood out the most for me was the decor of this place. Its a very cute spot for lunch and perfect for pictures.FOOD: It was nothing extraordinary. I had the beef and rice dish. The portions could be a bit larger in my opinion. The taste was okay but like I said, no flavours stood out. Also the veggies seem fresh and the meat was decent but the sizes were just small in size. Its sad to say but it looked a lot better than it tasted. PRICE: I don't think the bowls are worth what you're paying. It wont break your bank but its still pretty steep for the portions that you're getting. The prices are around 15$ for a simple bowl.SERVICE: The staff here is super friendly and greet you warmly."
/user_details?userid=iUm-7BfhWB5WP85RgNRRDA,燕园,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"As a donburi lover，I was very excited to see this restaurant . However the dishes here did not reach my criteria...I ordered Curry Katsu ，Yam fries，Genmai Tea and Matcha mini cheesecakeKatsu was small and dry，with too much rice and too little curry sauce.( And their curry was not homemade)Yam fries was crispy and sweet，good to try.Matcha mini cheesecake had right sweetness but it tasted ...neither like matcha nor like average level cheesecake.Anyway, I think it's a good place to go if you're passing by but don't expect too much on it."

/user_details?userid=kec5XHqHME_bM0vrm6o0bw,Veronica R.,"Vaughan, Canada",5 star rating,"Heard about this restaurant from a friend, and we decide to give it a try. The decoration is not fancy but cozy. We ordered yaki don(BBQ pork), and the curry fried chicken. The portion was not too much, but enough to feed us. The seasoning was in my style. Overall, I think it is a restaurant that worth to try."
/user_details?userid=FA-yxr7YzKo4dcbGsljzxw,Ashley W.,"Cuddebackville, NY",4 star rating,"This is a cute little place tucked away in Montreal. The road in front was going under construction so it was a bit hard to find, so for anyone who's wondering, just follow the Pizza Hut sign and it's literally right next door.Let's get to the food: the sweet potato fries with sour plum powder is da bomb. I'm Asian so the authenticity of the flavor is what struck me. The sweet potato is crisp on the outside and fleshy on the inside, and the sour plum powder wasn't just a thin coat on the outside, but rather mixed into the batter as well, so the taste permeated the whole fry.We got three rice bowls (udon was out that day): fried pork, gyu-don, and curry chicken.The gyu-don was a bit salty and not slightly sweet like the ones I've been used to. The curry chicken was a fried chicken cutlet and a curry sauce. The fried pork cutlet one was probably the best; I really liked the Mayo on it.We also got a brown sugar ginger tea thing since it was cold that day. You're given a cup of hot water with a brown sugar+ginger cube on the side."

/user_details?userid=zc0K1rGDQwdfYhK2ArCVOA,Jackson A.,"Plattsburgh, NY",4 star rating,"Great food, I had the torikatsu which was amazing only complaint was the amount of chicken used in the dish wasn't as much as I expected. However, it was a great dish the service was excellent, the restaurant itself was very cozy, creative, and cool. I would highly recommend if you're looking for an affordable, lowkey, quiet, and nice dinner."

/user_details?userid=M7mCQqhzWtSeIm8I6D-xBA,Alicia Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Ordered curry chicken katsudon, burger steak don, and fried chicken. The bowl and the amount of food is large. Not recommended if you don't eat much. The burger steak don and fried chicken are great but curry chicken katsu does not met my expectations. Both fried chicken and curry taste like Asian fusion instead of Japanese flavour. The food and service is generally good."
/user_details?userid=76w2G_fBAGRkW9U6cFdBqQ,Priscilla L.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,One of our favorite places when we visited Montreal. We are from NYC and have lots of Japanese and we highly recommend this place. We were a group of 14 and they were able to accommodate us. Super friendly too as half the group were kids.
