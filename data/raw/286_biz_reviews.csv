It's a nice change of pace from Sushi Shop. The poke bowls are great and there are so many ingredients you can add. You can build your own or pick one of their pre-made combos to make it simple. I'm a big fan of the Ahi tuna because it has tuna, mango and edamame.  They don't drown the bowl in sauce or put way too much rice like some other places. The fish portion is pretty decent too. I've only been in the evening and there's normally just one guy there who is super friendly and fast. I haven't tried their other food, but I'll probably give the soups a try at some point. There's a good amount of seating and restaurant is almost nearly empty when we go in the evening. No complaints really, I will definitely keep coming here!"

Cheap, fast and friendly service! They have the option of crafting your own poke bowl. You get to choose from a variety of proteins, toppings and sauces! It is in the $12-15 range which is pretty reasonable. Poke Star also serves ramens and phõ. I got the salmon poke bowl to go and it was delicious! The ingredients were very fresh!Delivery and pickups are available."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Got a large make-your-own poke bowl with salmon and fried shrimps. You can choose up to 5 veggies, 2  crunches and 2 sauces. The house sauce were delicious and very flavorful. The shrimps were crunchy and not too oily. For 18$ after tax, I would've expected a slightly bigger portion or a bit more ingredients. However, it was pretty good so would definitely come back."
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This brand new restaurant replaces Café Simon. Poké Star offers, of courses, poké bowls (which is Hawaiian), but also sushi, ramen and other asian food often thrown in the same bag (e.g. pho). We went there last week to try their food. The place was empty as we stepped in but we were warmly welcomed. Their menu was designed as a serie of multichoice questions, which you complete prior to ordering. We went for two large poké bowls, which gave us 2 choices of protein and 5 choices of toppings!I picked brown rice as base, salmon as protein, coriander as ""taste"", corn-caviar-cucumber-wakame-wild rice+edamame as toppings, nori as ""crunchiness'' and the signature Poké Star sauce. The food came very quickly and looked very good, although the portions were smaller than I expected for a total of 40+$ for two people. There were a few mistakes in the order (e.g. zucchini instead of cucumber, white instead of brown rice), but the food was tasty and overall quite fresh. Note: It's cash only!"

All the ingredients, especially the fish, was so fresh and delicious. I will definitely be coming back for another poke bowl.My only gripe is that the portion size of the fish is a little small for the price - I expected a little bit more salmon. That said, everything else was great!"
