Staff was very welcoming and the room had great decorations. The Pho Ga was delicious in a strange way. The broth was supreme and the chicken was grilled. I very much enjoyed the subtle difference with the grilled chicken instead of the usually shredded or thin sliced stock.Overall, great food, great people, fantastic experience."

Although this place serves pho, I wouldn't say it's traditional pho spot since it has some modern twists to their dishes and presentation. Me and my partner started off with some chicken imperial rolls, which were pretty good. We then ordered some beef pho, which came with an option of a side of stir fried veggies. The pho came in a nice presentation, with a broth so clear, and had the normal toppings on the side. Although the pho broth was good, it was a little too sweet to my liking. For dessert, we decided to try their fried banana with Nutella, which was fried perfectly, had a nice texture and tasted good, which I recommend ending your meal with. Overall, this place still has decent food and a great staff! It is a little bit pricier than your regular pho spots, but then again, they don't serve regular pho."

The broth lacked flavour and didn't really taste like anything AND the noodles were over cooked and felt soggy.Such a shame because this place is conveniently located in the heart of Downtown Montreal. Also, the prices are great which isn't something you come by often downtown. However, I did find it odd that to add vegetables to your pho, you have to pay 2.00 extra - never encountered this before.I recognize that they've just opened recently. Maybe, they're still trying to get in the swing of things?"

/user_details?userid=N8oEcSShL_-tkVtDhbZ3Xw,Jeannette L.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"amazing broth- no hint of msg, real beef slices, no hot pot meat, homemade beef balls, we've never had a bowl of pho like it and we frequent alot of pho joints. The place is clean and spacious, actually convenient for kids too (I brought both of mine). we will definitely come back because it's good hearty, homey food in the middle of downtown at affordable prices! I'm told they will also offer a liquor menu for 5a7s. excited to come try this with my coworkers."
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here last night for a quick dinner and was instantly warmly greeted by our hostess (sad I didn't get her name because she was awesome!) Anyways, we quickly sat down and were given menus to peruse as well as a 4-8pm specials menu.  We ordered the vegetable gyozas to share and each had the 4 beef pho. Service was quick and in what felt like no time, we got our gyozas. To be honest, I didn't find them that exciting - they were almost missing flavor but presentation was great. The pho was delicious on the other hand - great broth, and yummy sauces/sides to add into the soup. Another person from our party joined us later and ordered the lemongrass chicken dish with vermicelli - he said it was delicious so I guess a good on that front! The only 2 critiques I have would be that the beef balls were almost rubbery so I would avoid those next time and that the drinking cups have a crazy chemically taste to them which we all experienced. Total bill was $65 with tax and tip so slightly on the expensive side considering but good nonetheless. All in all, a good experience and a solid 3.5 stars but I rounded up to 4 because of the great service we received!"
