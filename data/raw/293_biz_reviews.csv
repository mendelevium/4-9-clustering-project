/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,We ordered the Greek Salad for $7.95 and added the Chicken with it for $6.95. Total was $15 without tax. Food is EXCELLENT here!! Portions are big. Husband and I shared it for dinner and it was enough for two people. Will definitely be ordering from here again! Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap meal of excellent quality and taste!

Their chicken marinade is absolutely delicious... especially when it drips down on the fries and makes them soggy (unpopular opinion?). The spicy marinade is a great option too..I don't like to go there myself because the kitchen looks a little dirty and off putting to my taste, and the waiting time is often long. Thank you ubereats"
/user_details?userid=iqQBsjqOF9xgIAbsZ2sAZA,David M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Sparta's chicken in Westmount could be a strong contender for best in Montreal, not just best Greek chicken but B-E-S-T chicken. PeriodIt's a bold claim but I can back it up saying it is the juiciest, most tender, perfectly seasoned chicken one can find, the spices are delicate and don't overwhelm and mask inferior quality chicken.To see a new location around Christmas made me believe in Santa again, so I had to try it out. We got a full chicken takeout, it's about $18 with no sides but I always keep pita and tzatziki at home anyway. The skinny fries are binge worthy but i was trying to stay away from the carboload.The chicken was still hot and fresh, one half spicy as requested and it's enough for 3 or 4 people.We spoke with the owner who was super friendly, it didn't seem that busy when we went (weird that they open at 3PM?), but the other location took some time to get it's reputation around the area. So all the best to this new location."

It is said that he learnt it from a reclusive hermit grandmaster while training in the mountains. He may or may not have taken his life once the secret recipe was revealed to him, we'll never know.The chicken in question is the perfect balance of:1. Tender2. Moist3. Flavourful4. Seasoned5. Spicy6. Lightly charred7. Decent priceIt's taste is barbecued but with a unique blend of herbs and spices sprinkled on top, and the spicy sauce has a nice kick that doesn't overpower the flavour of the chicken and herbs. I'm not crazy about fries so I recommend taking a chicken and a small salad, it's a great combination.Frankly I hope this franchise expands to other locations in and around Montreal, because Sparta chicken is a phenomenon you simply must experience as a Montrealer.The added bonus that it's Halal is just that much more awesome."

I tried the chicken souvlaki pita and it was pretty much perfect. Chicken was tender, full of flavour, moist and tasty as hell. The fries were great too, and to top it off the staff were super nice and helpful! Would go back in a heart beat :)"
