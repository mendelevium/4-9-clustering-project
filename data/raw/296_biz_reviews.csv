Intimate setting, not too loud, friendly staff, and the food is decent! Ordered the Kimchi Jeon to share which is a Korean pancake with kimchi and bacon, it took a really long time to make but it was worth it! Very delicious.I ordered the Salmon teriyaki which came with rice and vegetables on the size and the portion is very big. I couldn't finish it all. I thought the salmon was missing something but the rest was delicious.My date got the Jeyuk Jungsik, pork and mushrooms with stir fry vegetables and rice. He enjoyed it as well! All of our meals came out sizzling which I love."

We had the chicken wings as appetizer, them being so juicy and crispy mmm, then we had a bibimbap which was perfect. I would recommend this place to anyone!"

Perhaps I'll convince the staff to add some more vegan options tee-hee!"
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great new little restaurant to discover. They opened a little over a month now and I believe is still trying to adapt. But first let me tell you about the food. DELICIOUS!!! It did not disappoint. Hubby and I shared two appetizers which were the takoyakis and the chicken wings (spicy of course). The takoyakis reminded me of those I had in Japan and the wings were crispy, moist and tender packed with flavours. He then had the jjamppong, a spicy seafood noodle soup. It was a big bowl that hubby finished! I had the dolsot bibimbap. It to be honest, it was a little small for the price. Compared to other Korean restaurants, it had less garnishes. But it was very good none the less. The down side is that we had to pay 5$ for banchan. At other restaurants, it would be offered free of charge with unlimited refills. The banchan portion here was tiny! The only drinks that they offer for now is beer and shochu. Pricy :( Â  Our drinks were more expensive then out meal itself. 71$ for five beers and a bottle of shochu. 56$ for the meal.So now the down side. The service. Not that they were mean. The waitress and waiters were super nice and sweet. It's just that the service was extremely disorganized. They got our orders all wrong. It's a long story. I am sure they'll get better with time. As for me, I'll be returning (for sure) but will probably wait until they get their wine permit."

As a Korean, I would think $8 for only four dumplings is rather expensive, and the spicy Jeyuk was too sweet, but the dishes were displayed very well and knew how to please non-koreans. Overall, the service was good and the food was delicious. I recommend the hot steamed bibimbob."

Every time I visit from out of town, I make sure to come here for the tea and amazing food and unparalleled ambiance. The staff are so sweet. I think one of the workers could tell I was having a bad day, so she offered me some side dishes to try. She had such a kind demeanour and big smile that I instantly felt better. Simply put, the kindness overflowing from the staff and the love put into the food makes this one of my favourite sp"
/user_details?userid=sOL82Hbfza89tKL6m_wBJA,Marie H V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Le Petit Seoul offers such a fun experience with the bibimbap! It's a rice bowl with meat (or tofu) and veggies, served in a super hot bowl that keeps the food hot until the very end of your meal. The most interesting things that happen while you eat are: the raw egg yolk they put on top cooks while you eat the food, and the rice at the bottom of the bowl gets crispy as it touches the bowl long enough. (Mind you, don't touch that bowl with your fingers!) In addition of offering a different lunch experience, I have to say the staff was friendly, the price was good, and the service happened at a good pace. I want to go back to try their other menu items, like their ramen."

Everything we had was fantastic and as authentic as it gets. The restaurant itself is beautiful and would be perfect for a date, and everything was incredibly affordable (all the mains are around $12-16). The staff was also incredibly kind and hospitable. Can't wait to go back!"
/user_details?userid=nzOYpdMv3XST5O4C0Vs7Jg,Francois L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,Horrible service!Waited for ever and no one came to check... left without eating after 45 minutes. Will never go again.
/user_details?userid=7u8Q7oSoDyWxl3gEOd-iRA,Lee C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Delicious food! I loved the things I got the two times I went. They always serve miso soup as an appetizer too which I love! The staff is really friendly and explains the dishes well if you have questions. The service can be a little slow (hence the 4 star review), but it's definitely worth the the wait. Also has a really cute interior! Would def recommend. They also have a selection of korean beers which pair nicely with the meal."
/user_details?userid=KJIS0INMJKhBmGqFkHMc-A,Mai Lynn L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is such a nice discovery! The service is A1 ; the waiters were so nice, the food is very good and the ambiance gives a romantic vybe with the lighted candles in the middle of the tables. There's a lot to choose from and it's also very affordable. The soondubu jjigae, which is a spicy rather thick broth with sweet tofu and seafood comes with a bowl of purple rice and with a bit of kimchi as a side dish. Also, the chicken wings were very good. It was made like how I usually like them : crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Miammm. My only concern (and it's not even that big of a deal) is that the menu didn't have images so if you don't know much about korean food, it's a bit hard to know what you're getting. But all in all, it was great and I would most definitely go back again when my craving of korean food needs to be fulfilled."
/user_details?userid=ZGEhXakRfim-bgebo06YMA,Justin P.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"This is my new favorite Korean restaurant! When I went I was pleasantly surprised by great jjamppong (when most restaurants put instant noodles and call it a day) and also really chic decor. The restaurant is run by a really nice Korean family and it's located in a cool area in Mile End. So great to finally see a Korean restaurant that reminds me of Seoul in terms of food, feel and experience!"
/user_details?userid=Rlwhnwqrg2QkKcDougcJqQ,Shaun Z.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,The Korean young waitress is the worst waitress I've ever seen in Montreal. No manner and courtesy. The old lady is perfect.
/user_details?userid=jXHrSe9-iqyUa0sQGQtAOQ,Victoria I.,"North Hollywood, CA",3 star rating,"I really want to love this place, and honestly I plan to go back a few times. A great Korean place in this area would be wonderful. We had the Bibimbap and the Pork Bone Soup, along with one order of banchan. The banchan coat $5, which is fine since the prices are low for the area, however the portion and number of banchan is low. I wish they had bean sprouts and tofu, which wouldn't actually cost them more, and it would feel like a better value. Both our mains were pretty great, but the kitchen was clearly overtaxed, and the mains came out 15 minutes from each other, including the banchan. The waitstaff was similarly disorganized and really frantic throughout the evening. I love the diversity this restaurant adds to this part of Saint Laurent, so I'll keep going to see if they can improve both the service and the options. If they start serving beef soon tofu (not just seafood), I'll be a religious visitor."
/user_details?userid=ucZ4Nty1qPPvisPdplzNDA,Yasha S.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Fantastic new spot in the neighborhood. My girlfriend and I went for a weeknight dinner here during their first few weeks open. The beef tartare, hoedopbaap (sashimi salad), and sundooboo jigae were as authentic as it gets. The space is really nice too. Food is fresh and authentic, friendly service, and warm ambiance. A must try!"
