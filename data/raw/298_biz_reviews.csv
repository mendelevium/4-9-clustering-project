She was awesome.Come here for the food, ambience, service and location."

The decoration is so nice, really a pleasant place to hangout with friends. This is like a tapas style: order a bunch to share with friends! The food is good, but they look much better than they taste and are more on the expensive side compared to other Izakayas.I personally really like their edamame~ salted and buttery!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Average food but great service. We got 4 dishes. The KFC was juicy and pretty good with the mayo. The mochi bacon was way too salty to be enjoyable. The chirashi don was disapponting: there were too many non-fish ingredients that overpowered the taste of the fish. The ebi kare don was delicious. The service was great. The food came quickly and the waiters were friendly and nice. They warned us about the small portions and made recommandations. The place is nicely decorated. We sat on the terrasse and it was comfortable. Unfortunately, the food wasn't amazing and I don't think I'll go back."

Cool modern and hip decor with a little bit of old port charisma with the stone walls. The food is top notch! But most importantly for me???? The service is absolutely amazing. From the hosts to bar staff! I give Hanzo 5 stars for food, management and decor."
/user_details?userid=ao7Jt5QoBWO15lGdZH16Kw,Christina T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Super surprise we got a good Izakaya here in Montreal! The choices of food are quite good and the price is pretty decent. My first order was the chicken ramen which was a little bit too salty for my taste. The second time I ordered was the Tako caré don for takeout and they substitute the octopus for shrimps which still tasted great but the price was 2$ more from the original takeout menu. Overall, I am impressed!"
/user_details?userid=GnJ2w63izmrICmt1wNCGOA,Laurence V.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,"I randomly saw an add on a social media outlet advertising the first izakaya in Old Montreal so I decided that was the perfect place to celebrate my birthday! I generally love the food and the vibe of an izakaya so I had high expectations. First off, I knew we would be around 20 people so I contacted someone weeks ahead to confirm that they had a table for me the day I wanted. The response was quick and they informed me of a sharing menu which I found very clever and an amazing idea! However, due to many diet restrictions, it made more sense for my group to just do an à la carte menu. I was given the option to choose which service I wanted to attend to, and decided on the second one at 8:30 pm. We exchanged emails for weeks and they were very helpful, answering all my questions and making my reservation as well. Now the day of my birthday supper, when I came in, they had set up the tables for my group in the middle of the restaurant where we were the only tables, so it felt isolated and private. The izakaya is inspired by the movie Kill Bill, specifically the scene with the Crazy 88, which I could kind of see it. But apart from the cool neon signs, a picture of Bill on the wall and a few cocktails referring to the movie, I expected a bit more from the ambiance. It was pretty full in the restaurant so it was loud, the lighting was dark, but I could tell everyone was having a good time. Everyone ordered their own drinks and dishes, and I'm not even kidding, I think everyone in my group loved the food they ate! I personally got the nago bay cocktail which was average, the katsuo tataki which was good (I first wanted the hamachi sashimi but they ran out of it), kinoko which very buttery and filling so pretty great and finally my favourite dish, which was the mochi bacon and it was to die for! Although some dishes had questionable ingredients in them, somehow everything worked and tasted amazing! The service at the beginning was a bit slow, and they rushed because the kitchen was closing soon. They were yelling name of dishes and asked who ordered what, which was quite hectic at first, but afterwards they would give the dish personally to the person. However, I understand that we were the biggest table there and I believe the last ones to order so they were just trying to get our food out as fast as possible, so I'm not bothered by that. A waitress was so kind and offered everyone shots of sake which was a nice surprise, and I even got a brownie with a sparkler for my birthday! Finally, when the bill came in, I was pleasantly surprise at how inexpensive the bill was and how full I was! Especially that we are in the Old Port, I definitely think it is worth it food wise, vibe wise and service wise! For a large group like mine, everything went down pretty smoothly. Despite the little mishaps, I know I will be recommending Hanzo to everyone and I know and I will be coming back soon!"
/user_details?userid=M52QrSGBxYao0zqzTZdntg,Denis M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Hanzo Izakaya is a great addition to what is traditionally considered a ""touristy"" area of Montreal. Despite this, I definitely recommend that locals check it out if you're in the area.The vibe and ambiance is awesome being inspired by Kill Bill, which should please fans of the movie and of Japanese fare in general.That being said food is what will make me come back. Last visit I had the Kamo Yakitori (Duck Hearts), KFC (Konbini Fried Chicken), Sashimi, Edamame and the Spicy Gyoza. All this with a Nago Bay cocktail. For squeamish, the hearts were super tender, well marinated and well seasoned so worth the leap of faith to try. KFC is a solid choice for those who are coming in with an appetite. The sashimi is super fresh and has a great light sauce on it. Gyozas were pretty solid and I got them pipping hot which was great. Surprisingly the edamame also stood out as they were seasoned with the usual coarse salt but also has additional spices and a delicious sauce.Shout out to Yuri, Yasmine who treated us wonderfully.Will definitely be back to try the ramen and takoyaki."
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I went to Hanzo Izakaya on the second day of the soft opening. this is the first Izakaya restaurant to open in Old Montreal. Located next door from Mandy's, you can reach in minutes from Metro Square victoria OACI.  The restaurant decor largely resembles that of the owner's other businesses: Biiru and Gokudo: classy. I absolutely love the ambiance- as neon shaped lions light a dimly lit restaurant, you'll be invited into an open space. The service is incredibly attentive- we were walked through the menu, most items were available for purchase. With the Izakaya concept comes the sharing of platters tapas style- we ordered hamachi sashimi (5/5)-12.95$  this came with himachi served with a ponzu glaze, red grape, truffle capers, sesame oil. The texture and flavors were perfect for this dish- my favorite of all items. The kani korokke (3/5)-10.95$ were fried maple crab cakes, with maple tonkatsu, big mac sauce, relish. On paper it seems like an odd combination- but once you get the dish- it came with two crab cakes, light in big mac sauce- not heavily covered by relish. Not bad. The kamo yakitori (5/5)- 5.95$- duck heart skewers with red miso tare were great! Not too hearty- and perfectly grilled with the right amount of sauce. The takoyaki octopus balls (2/5)-9.95$ were my least favorite. The dish came served with melted cheddar cheese that was cold by the time we ate it -but the cheese itself overpowered the dish. The kiniko (2/5)- 11.95$ is a good vegetarian option that comes with a melange of mushrooms, corn tempura, ponzu butter, togarashi popcorn. Something about this dish lacked originality but the ponzu butter was a very nice touch. The jimami tofu (3/5)-5.95$ is a great dessert choice with peanut tofu and peanut caramel- it felt like I was eating peanut butter without it being it!For cocktails I tried their rendition of the whiskey sour garnished a local berry powder and soy sauce! It was a cool drink with the sweet and salty play on the cocktail.Amongst the two of us- we paid around 50$ each excluding tip. I was very full and satisfied with my meal. The prices were affordable given its location in Old Montreal. If you go next week, you're guaranteed to have the full sashimi menu- TRY IT!"
/user_details?userid=ggP5hWgIo6GyveBjeHIkNg,Brenda Jiwon L.,"Sunnyvale, CA",4 star rating,"I've been to a lot of different izakaya, but I've never been to one with this type of atmosphere! The setting was more modern and I absolutely loved the atmosphere. It did get a little noisy as people were shouting and counting down for the sake bomb, but I loved the bar scenery and how cozy it got. All of the dishes are small, great for sharing and having a little dinner with drinks. I highly recommend getting the takoyaki, which had cheese melted on it! I've never had takoyaki with cheese before! We also had the beer tartare with raw quail egg, which was really good and great with the hot sake. Service was a bit slow, but everyone was super friendly and nice. Also, we were lucky to get a seat, but I highly recommend making reservations before coming."
/user_details?userid=A7YlcidsiAZzU-tCSsrTSg,Anny T.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I've came here on three occasions, and each time was because my boyfriend took me here. This establishment has never been my first choice for Izakayas because we have so many good places like Otto Yakitori, Imadake or Ichigo Ichie.Good: It's located right in the Old Port next to Mandy's, so you have an idea of the trendy crowd that comes in here. The decor is really nice, dimly lit ambiance and really has a cool vibe. It is the ideal place to stop by and grab a bite before a night out in the old port. The first time I've came here, the service was fine. The food wasn't memorable, but I had no issues.Bad: Second time I came here, everything started off fine. After our table had finished eating and the staff cleared our table, I've realized one of my dishes (the takoyaki) didn't come yet. I've asked the waitress if they haven't started the order, can they just cancel it since it's clear that all the food for our table has already come out for awhile. She obliged, and then 15 mins later, a hot plate of takoyaki arrives at our table. I've worked in the restaurant industry before, this is a classic move to get customers to spend more and therefore more tip. I had previously told the waitress that I had a sesame allergy and so I don't want any sesame on my food. She just drops off the plate of takoyaki and said 'there's no sesame, I've checked."" Well upon closer inspection, clearly not, because the dish was covered in sesame. I sent it back and said I cannot eat this due to my sesame allergy and no need to remake this dish for me because I had asked to cancel it anyways. This whole incident left me annoyed and I was definitely not feeling this place and their staff's carelessness. The third time I came here, I get the SAME little blond waitress again lol, but this time she was attentive to my food intolerance and I thought 'ok, maybe that was a one off incident because service was better today'. Food was underwhelming as usual, service was a bit slow (which is understandable because we're a group of 40 so I wouldn't fault them for that). Everything was fine until we got to the bill. One of the guys on our table was ranting 'no, they don't have the right to do that! I don't mind paying for the dinner, but you have to no right to automatically apply the tip on my bill' Turns out the waitress applied an 18% tip on EVERYONE's bills. She came over to explain that the 18% is justified because by law, we're a big group and therefore the automatic tip amount is applied. Then the guy was like 'no it's not the law, I am a lawyer.""Now she was a bit flustered being busted, she offered to refund the 3% difference (like who's gonna take a $5 back in front of a group of 40 people and delay payment for everyone?) Anyways, I just thought that is such a shady practice for them to do that and that was not cool.Bottom Line: There are plenty of better Izakaya spots with better food, ambiance and service."
/user_details?userid=S3KMGLJsbVMTy7-WXiIjjA,Steven O.,"Scarborough, Canada",5 star rating,"As far as thematic restaurants go, Hanzo is a tier above the rest. The restaurant is a beautiful ode to ""Kill Bill,"" complimented by delicious small dishes and very friendly service. I think their dishes compliment each other quite well. Their bacon wrapped mochi is wonderfully salty, a nice contrast to their delicate sashimi or tender duck hearts. If you want a bit more flavour, opt for their tako don with delicious bits of tomago, octopus, and truffle. Their ""Gomae"" Gaelan was another favourite, and was pretty sweet and saucy. I'm pretty sure they have crunchy/fried dishes too, but didn't try much in that department. I'd highly recommend a visit for their atmosphere alone. Their  snacks and cocktails make it an even easier choice for a night out with friends."

For starters the inside is beautiful and is perfectly located at the Old Port. We had a couple of different items here, with everything being superb. You have to try the fried chicken!! Probably my favourite Izakaya in Montreal after experiencing the service and food here."
/user_details?userid=uIwTV6mRlco87jrQFAY60Q,Elisa K.,"Las Vegas, NV",4 star rating,"Located in old port, this place was on a point with decor. Great selection of Japanese food and tasted amazing. I went there for my birthday and we were a group of 10. The waitress offered us a tasting menu for 35$ each. It was so worth it !!! Need to mention also that the cocktails were amazing as well !  The karage ""KFC"" chicken was LEGIT !!! CRISPY outside and so so tender inside ! That 35$ was worth it and so filling !"
/user_details?userid=sBwchHg_AxcgaN-e_UoraQ,Doug S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Tried Hanzo for lunch today and unfortunately it was pretty underwhelming. I also found the portion sizes to price value very disappointing. We tried some of the rice bowls which were undersized, under seasoned and pretty unimaginable overall. Also had a salad and the fried chicken both of which were not bad but not something that would bring me back."
/user_details?userid=rkPrz6uwJIefZdH2Oqv4Tg,Christian C.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Beautiful Izakaya in the heart of old Montreal, with a wide selection of cocktails as well as sake bombs! As with any Japanese bar, it's recommended to try at least 2-3 plates per person, and oh boy, the flavour combinations were out of this world amazing! The vegan options are plentiful, the waiter even slipped in an extra vegan dish that wasn't on the menu, a lovely vegan gyoza appetizer. I would definitely come back again soon!"

/user_details?userid=UquP-tl-JE0N8L1m_UynMQ,JZ S.,"Cambridge, MA",3 star rating,"I wish I could give Hanzo 3.5 stars, but since I can't, I'm going to say that it was OK. Nothing particularly bad about it, but nothing really too exciting either, especially for the high cost. The best parts were the service (excellent and super friendly/charming) and the outdoor seating and setting in the Old Port on a quaint side street. If you're in the area, then great, go there. But I wouldn't travel to it and won't return for a second time given all of the other great restaurants in the city and nearby in the Old Port."

We ended up ordering Hamachi Sashimi, crab croquettes with à big Mac like sauce, a Mushroom dish (my favorite!), soft Tofu with a caramel sauce and takoyaki. We waited to long to eat the Takoyaki and it ended up being a bit soggy and oily. They also had very interesting cocktails. As it W's their second night and a Thurs, it wasn't super busy. The ambiance was nice and the staff friendly and enthusiastic. I would definitely go back."

/user_details?userid=RlCxlCuiKzJjVQ39kdlfJw,Nick E.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Excellent Izakaya style (Japanese small plates). Definitely a notch or two above any I've tried before. You can see the Old Montreal bones of the place, but it has been decorated beautifully in a Japanese rustic style, with a nod or two to Hatori Hanzo's bar in Kill Bill. The red tuna dish and the bacon-wrapped rice ""gnocchi"" were our favourites. Tried the eggplant as our last dish and it was intriguing, but heavier and smokier than expected."

/user_details?userid=_B5q4HW4YRtq5-ILjkSI9w,Tanya W.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"This place is a gem. Yasmine our server was incredibly awesome and sweet. The beauty of tapas style food is that while the portions are small, we were able to try a good majority of the food menu. The hamachi sashimi, kani korokke, duck hearts were my top three favorites. Dashi Nasu, black gyoza, Jimami cold tofu, and KFC were quite exceptional as well. Overall, the menu felt very authentic Japanese with a bit of a western twist. I would say the tako parm ramen which doesn't come with broth, was a bit binary in flavor. It was creamy and delicious but all parm and really no hint octopus. At all. That said, my bf who has a very conservative pallet and was wouldn't try anything on the menu other than the KFC chicken really loved it."

/user_details?userid=N8oEcSShL_-tkVtDhbZ3Xw,Jeannette L.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here tonight with coworkers, was enticed by the good reviews and the $$ rating. Some disappointments: the plates are tapas size, there is no ramen in summer time. Some highlights: the plates were pretty well done. I had the terriyaki skewers, fried chicken, gomae (gai lan veggie dish) and rice, total with tip was 34$. If you compare with Chinatown or Concordia hood, its $$$$ for what I ate but for old port, I guess it's ""cheaper"" then neighboring eateries. I was full and I was impressed by the Gai lan, it was made with a black sesame sauce and very good portion. The rice bowl was sprinkled with seaweed and peanuts I believe, the skewers were hearty (2), the fried chicken was good, not excellent but good. Others at my table had the ribs which looked great actually! I could've gotten that with the Gai lan and rice and it would've been filling too. All in all, quality is up there, if you're feeling for Japanese Izakaya food in old Montreal, this is the place to be."
