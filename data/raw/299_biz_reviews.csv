In fact, the staff were so good that after walking around for a bit, we returned for dinner, to amazing bangers and mash and a really good steak & frites.Lots of good local beers on tap, a great courtyard patio, great service. I'm a fan."
/user_details?userid=fM_UsuFAYu2TVUqJiYAKsg,Lori R.,"Raleigh, NC",4 star rating,"After seeing Aura, four of us ventured further into Old Montreal to find yet another Pub for some drinks and a light dinner.  We were lucky enough to score a table in the dining room, where we proceeded to have a good time.Note:  it gets REALLY loud in here.  Funniest moment for us was when our Server arrived and was startled to see a Clown at the table next to us.  Looked like they had let him in to perform for a small party. Drinks & food were good.  None of us were starving so each couple shared a dish.  Bangers & Mash for two and a Clam Pasta dish for the two of us.  Then had dessert as well.  Our chocolate one was definitely better than the other one. Prices were a bit steeper than some of our other Montreal restaurant experiences, but we were all pleased with our evening here."

/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I really want to love this pub, but I'm not there yet. As others have said, the space is beautiful and the outside patio (heated and with retractable roof if needed) is great and will certainly be very popular this summer. The cocktails I've tried have been good to great. I love gin so I was excited to see a lot of gin cocktails on the menu. My standout is the Slow Gin Spring - so fresh and light and sweet but not too too sweet. I also tried the Blueberry Boozy tea (tasty and surprisingly tea-like) and the Pimm's cup. They have wine and beer on the menu as well, but the cocktails seem like the move.The food was more mixed. We started with the duck heart bolognese because we're suckers for anything that sounds out of the ordinary. However, it was a pretty standard bolognese. The flavor of the duck hearts was kind of lost and if you didn't know you might just assume it was a regular ground meat. The stracciatella is a nice touch, but the toast was probably the best thing about this dish for me. The beef tartare was tasty and I would order this again. It wasn't too out of the ordinary but quite savory, and the cheese crisps on top were a nice and interesting touch. A good amount of toast with this once too (a lot of places give you like 3 crackers worth of toast.) For main dishes we both got the steak special which was a bavette with watercress salad, cheesy cauliflower and fries. The bavette was perfectly cooked, medium rare all the way through. I would think it was sous-vided from how perfect it was. The only downside was that it was criminally under-seasoned. Steak doesn't need much, but it does need a bit of salt and ours were seemingly missing that. The sauce helped, but we both ended up adding some salt to the dish. The watercress salad could have used a bit of dressing or something to cut some of the bitterness, but mixed in with the steak sauce it was fine. Can't go wrong with cheesy cauliflower. Kind of like mac and cheese but with cauliflower. The sauce was a bit more liquidy that I would have liked, but all in all a a good dish. Fries were good and came with tiny amounts of ketchup and mayo. Although we were so full we couldn't finish them all. Our waitress was very friendly and our water glasses were kept full (a low-key thing I appreciate about any restaurant.) Food came out at a reasonable pace. All in all a good experience but as we came here for a special dinner (a birthday) I was hoping for/expecting everything we ate to be great."

/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"As soon as I heard the guys from Burgundy Lion are opening Wolf & Workman, a British pub in the heart of Old Montreal- I couldn't wait to go check it out.The venue will be familiar to the foodies as being an old home to previous residents including Scarlet and pop-up Miracle bar. The menu is simple yet creative. Items can range between 7$ to $23 most dishes are large in size and are good to share. I tried the W& W burger for 18$- what a great bite. Burger revolves every week, the dish comes with Country styled french fries and a really good burger that's cooked medium rare. We also got to try the lamb curry pie -23$ which is a meat pie that is quite large in serving and comes with a salad. I enjoyed the lamb curry with Siracha sauce. For dessert, we tried to two items that were not on the menu-blood orange trifle (My personal favorite) and a chocolate pistachio tart for 7$ each.Along with the full bar featuring Quebec drinks there were also original cocktails-Blueberry boozy tea-11$ which was a sweet and lighter twist on a Long Island iced tea. Pimm 's cup was also refreshing.The team was great, super happy to find a nice place to hang out in Old Montreal that isn't pretentious but genuinely authentic and fun!"
/user_details?userid=KFsbACIHXQxyff_W6CN1LA,Karen H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"On a late Monday afternoon during a Pandemic not too many Restaurants were open. We walked around till we bumped in to this place on St Paul St. It looked cosy and one guy was at the bar as we peeked in. Who doesn't like pub food?! Little did we know they had an open terrace in the back and we chose that. The Host sanitized our hands, they were masked up and they also took our name and phone number if they needed to reach due to the Covid. Bravo! They are practicing safety and I'm feeling safer.  Everything looked good on the menu so my friend and I chose burgers and fries! So delish. We ordered bar made lemonade and lime soda and that was so refreshing on a hot day. Cheese burger with leeks on a bun, dry homemade fries was better than the best. After 3 months in lock down it was nice to go out with a friend and enjoy the resto experience once again. It's a thing and how I missed it! Be safe!"

The rear patio is so dreamy with their stone courtyard and ivy growing everywhere.Their beer list was not extensive but we were able to pick a good wheat beer that left us (my boyfriend and I) both very satisfied. We ordered the charcuterie plate and ""tartare de beouf"", both were very good. Such a great spot to spend an afternoon in Old Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The Wolf and Workman is a new pub located in the heart of Old Montreal.  I was excited to hear about this opening because the owners of this establishment are the same ones as Burgundy Lion, one of my favourite pubs in Montreal.  Like the Burgundy Lion it bills itself as a British pub.When you first walk in the pub looks small but there is another room on the side where you will find plenty of seating.  I would reserve to be sure you get a seat because I can see this spot becoming very popular especially in summer when the tourists are around.  It is housed in a historic building and the pub captures that ambiance.Since it bills itself as a British pub you can expect a menu that focuses on standard pub fare.  I thought I would keep it simple and order a burger.  The patty was thick and juicy and cooked medium rare but the bun became very soggy with all the contents and eating the burger became a messy affair.  The fries were delicious and I also tried a mouthful of my friend's clam chowder poutine, which actually worked well despite sounding like an odd combination.  That was finished off with a blood orange trifle which was citrusy, delicate and very well-balanced.While they have a good selection of beers on tap I was in the mood for cocktails on this particular visit.  The menu features some classic ones as well as their own creations.  I ordered two Spritz which were both lacking Campari which gives the cocktail its distinct taste.  That being said the Workman's Sling was much better. Given their prime location I think the Wolf and Workman will do well.  It lived up to expectations and offers people an excellent option for a drink when they are in the Old Montreal area."
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I was excited to try this pub because I love Burgundy Lion! The food is good and the drinks are good so I was expecting something similar but more fancy in terms of decoration and menu items since it is located in the old port. It is actually located where the Scarlet restaurant used to be. It's definitely less loud than Burgundy Lion. It wasn't packed but it wasn't empty. Considering it was Easter Monday and pretty early in the night, it had a chill vibe.I love the chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, and the vintage mirrors and picture frames against brick walls. I remember really enjoying the terrace in the back when it was Scarlet. There used to be tons of colourful cushions and lots of plants. Now it's just simple chairs and tables. We went on Monday which was a nice day but by 6 pm there was no sun in the back and for some reason they wouldn't turn the heated lamps on. It was too chilly to eat outside so we went back inside. We each got a bloody Wolf cocktail which is basically a Bloody Caesar. It was good! Very spicy!!We shared the New England chowdah poutine and the W&W burger and fries. The food was good and the portions were pretty big. However the poutine was not what I expected. I expected clam chowder with some fries and cheese. What I got was something more dry. The sauce was thick and less soupy than expected which is not bad because the fries did not become soggy. There was a lot of squeaky cheese which is always a good thing! However there were no clams!!! How can you have clam chowder poutine with no clams?! All I saw were onions, carrots, celery and herbs. Maybe the clams were so finely chopped that I didn't see any or maybe it was blended with the sauce but I think there just wasn't any.The hamburger apparently changes every day. The burger and the fries were good! The hamburger was simple enough with lettuce, tomato and homemade Big Mac sauce. The bread became a bit soggy and it was a bit messy to eat as most burgers are but I still enjoyed it.If I am in the area I would gladly go back and try their other cocktails. It'll be awesome to hang out on the terrace in the summer. I also want to try their bolognese aux canard which was recommended to us by the waitress. We were just not in the mood for pasta at the time."

We sat in the back courtyard which was semi-private and had good vibes. Ordered the duck poutine and tuna tartare - highly suggest getting both."
/user_details?userid=7zkmP0Eav9LnkgjASOVmLw,Abe K.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"Great drinks, lovely space. Service is a bit spotty, for a long time, our server disappeared. Eventually, I had to ask someone else to get the bill. Also, my fiancee and I came just to drink. I'm not sure if it's a Montreal-wide policy or just here but we weren't allowed to just drink so we were forced to buy food which was a bit annoying. Overall, a good time though."

Was told by the bartender she only has a Food license so you had to buy food to get a drink. Get a license or offer a 1$ food item. Otherwise it's a trash bar"

My friends had a great appetizer off the menu I had trout which was fabulous steak frite was had by another friend and the beet salad by another was simply huge all the food was great
/user_details?userid=vjn7LQjT_lDrbnICrJK5XQ,John G.,"Cambridge, MA",4 star rating,"A great location and interesting menu, with extremely nice staff. We really liked their steak tartare. Their clam chowder poutine was not particularly good, although the portion was generous. The lamb shepherd's pie was interesting and baked-to-order, but I felt that it was a bit under-seasoned. Nonetheless, this is probably one of the best options in the Old Port area."
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"In the heart of old Montreal we walk in this English pub. Beautiful spot, a true feel to Britain. The service is exceeds perfection. The staff are nice, caring and super quick. We ordered sparkling water with clam chowder poutine, trout with mashed cauliflower and spinach cream and fries on the side. When the waiter poured my water in my glass, there  was a tiny spill. He apologized and right way wiped it. When they brought food, he warned us the plate is super hot. He brought fries with mayonnaise. Without asking, less than a minute he showed up with ketchup. I really appreciate their service. Food wise, it was a disappointment. The taste was really bland. The trout was well cooked but all the side dish was super salty. The clam chowder poutine was heavy feeling with no flavors. It was filled with carrots and celery, maybe I tasted two or four claims. The restaurant is super beautiful, the service is impeccable and food is low in taste."

Atmosphere was great and felt like a real local bar and get together spot. Our waiter Scott was also fantastic and told us more about the city and what it's like to live there, perfect for us tourists! Didn't have any main dishes, so can't speak those but it looked like some pretty interesting meals too!"

/user_details?userid=fw7GQ34xVS3cZpuV5UmMFA,Irene D.,"Deux-Montagnes, Canada",5 star rating,"Same owners as Burgundy Lion, a beautiful English pub in the old port. This will do well both with tourists and locals. The decor matches great for a date night, all dressed up, or for a casual, let's just go grab a beer, night.Their menu is small which is good, big menus tend to be overwhelming. They have a bar menu with some sharing plates and a menu for dinner. They carry local beers, which always makes me happy; support local! and they also have a few vegan options.We started with drinks, of course, and ordered their hummus with flatbread and their homemade Salt & Pepper chips. All were excellent!We then went on ordering the beet salad, the clam chowder poutine and the butter chicken. All dishes were good, but I highly recommend the poutine. Different, but oh so good.We also ordered their dessert, the only one they have. Don't know what it was but it was really good. Not too sweet, very light and citrusy.The service was on point. Very friendly and attentive. We didn't feel rushed and got to enjoy the whole experience.I definitely recommend it and I definitely will return. I have to try their falafels and lamb pie..."

/user_details?userid=QXHmwiDzysyDNTZMty-1kQ,Mike D.,"Venice, CA",5 star rating,"My wife just got in from Dallas for my brother's wedding. The concierge at our hotel recommends this place for late food (it was about 10:30pm) we sit at the bar and the bartender is a charming, professional nice person. I order the steak and a glass of wine. Some of the owners are sitting next to us and we have a great conversation about orange wine (we learn some new things). The steak arrives and it is literally perfectly cooked - the sides are cauliflower and fries - both perfectly done and delicious. As I'm leaving one of the guys we were speaking to tells me they've been open FOUR WEEKS! Wow. As someone with family in the food industry who just finished living in LA for 10 years - one of the better spontaneous dining experiences I've had in years. To have a place working that well in 4 weeks is a big testament to both management and staff. Bravo! We will be back. - OH, and 3rd time back in 2 days - Steely Dan abides."
