/user_details?userid=xZz56LNb1L1HUt2qb7rRBA,Roseanne N.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"When you're in Montreal, you definitely need to stop by a Portuguese chicken shop. Fortunately, there are plenty of restaurants serving fresh rotisserie chicken with freshly baked Portuguese egg tarts for you to feast on. We ordered a whole chicken, poutine, and Portuguese egg tarts. We originally planned on getting each half a chicken but decided on a whole chicken which was only $15. I found the chicken to be a bit on the dry side. The seasoning however was pretty good. You can opt for spicy or regular chicken, and I asked for the spicy. It wasn't really spicy though. I should have gotten some sauce on the side for the chicken. Poutine here is great. They load up on cheese and gravy for your fries, which is always welcome. The egg tarts were very tasty. The top is slightly crispy, and the filling is creamy and sweet. These will always be a guilty pleasure of mine. When you order here, you simply tell the kitchen what you would like and they serve you at the spot (quick takeout). You then proceed to the cash counter to pay."

From the time we ordered to when we received the food, it probably took 20 mins.We got the 1/2 chicken with rice + salad, 1/2 chicken with fries + salad, and egg tarts.The chicken combo was really big, we probably only needed one portion for the two of us. The rice is really delicious! I was surprised to encounter such tastes rice here, which only made us sad we got the fries. The salad is pretty small, just a nice side when you need a break from the carbs. The chicken itself was really delicious and tender! However, it's really salty in my opinion. Also, I feel like Costco's rotisserie chicken might be more worthwhile...The Portuguese egg tarts were quite nice. They are probably sort of overpriced compared to other places, but delicious nonetheless. However, I will say I'm more of a Chinese egg tart fan."

For those of you who have not had the pleasure, these tarts consist of a sweet creamy custard nestled within a crispy flaky pastry shell - heavenly!  I couldn't leave without grabbing at least a dozen! The girls serving at the counter are very courteous - I asked to pick out my natas as I like them more browned/burnt on the top and she kindly agreed. Prices are super reasonable, packaging is good but most important of all, they taste oh so ooey gooey ahhh-maaazing!"

Delicious juicy chicken, fries and salad served with a hot or a mild sauce. The setting is not fancy, but it's cheap, delicious and generous.I tied this classic Portuguese Rotisserie when we went to Montreal last year. There was a long line up, it took me more than 1 hr to get to the ordering counter. There are 2 lines, one for walk in and second for order pickup. Yes you can order in advance and skip the long line. I got it packed and also got few egg tarts. Went back to our hotel and ate it after 2 hrs. I was blown away, the chicken was so flavourful and juicy. Even the egg tarts were good. I will definitely go back there. Sometimes I get dreams about this chicken, and believe me I will someday just go for a drive from Toronto to Montreal and back just for this chicken."

It was cold when it was served to us, which I did not mind at all. It reminded me of Creme brûlée a lot and the flavor was addicting.

The location is pretty easy to find (given we took an Uber) and it's a casual setting inside. We ordered a half chicken combo with 2 Portuguese tarts. Our total was $15. Great price for 2 people sharing the meal. Our order came with a half chicken (choice of mild or spicy sauce), salad, rice and fries. The chicken tasted fresh and flavourful right off the grill. It was plentiful. The salad was nothing special- regular shmegular salad. The fries were DELICIOUS and they are very generous with the serving. I liked the rice but I wish they gave a bigger serving. Maybe cut down the salad size and add a bigger serving of rice. If you're looking for cheap eats and good quality Portuguese food, look no further !"

BUT! Romados really has given me the best rotisserie chicken I've ever had in my life. Chicken is juicy and bursting with flavor from the skin to the meat. The smokiness to the chicken tasted like a hybrid of a backyard BBQ + in-house rotisserie chicken. My order came with fries I didn't care much for, but nothing to complain about here since everyone comes for the chicken anyway."

When you call in to tell them, they fight you. They deny they made a mistake. It's completely insane. Insanity!!!! Sometimes they give you the desert, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they give you a bun, sometimes they don't. They make it up as they go along. Oh, and they can't read. Don't bother putting a note. They won't read it, or can't. It's incredible. I almost systematically get a 7$ rebate from foodora as a result. I appreciate the rebate, but I'd prefer it if these people would get it right. Is that too much to ask for Romados owner?"

It's tasty and affordable and am easy place for me to fill up my college-aged boys who consume massive quantities of food. The only downside from my perspective is eating in - I don't really care for the ambiance but the smell is amazing. What has worked extremely well for me is to order a large quantity of chicken for take out and then eat it at home while preparing my own sides. I even did this at my Airbnb and had the whole family over for a ""thanksgiving"" - way easier than dealing with turkey prep. The other thing about takeout is that you can call in and order it which is a lot more convenient than waiting in their long lines. Heck, the long lines are a good sign but I don't love to wait."

Romados has perfected their chicken, and even though you don't see the chicken in this picture, it's hiding under all those fries! You get a good portion of fries and salad and rice too, and couldn't even finish all the fries. We got two half combos, and three of us couldn't even finish it! So much food. Also definitely try their egg tarts! I was hoping the egg tarts would be warm, but they're cold. A sweet dessert, and while they look like Portuguese egg tarts I've had before, didn't quite taste the same. Still yum though."
/user_details?userid=9Zu4BPDntg_52YmNwViyOA,Daron D.,"Ypsilanti Township, MI",5 star rating,"This place literally saved my Sunday night. Heard a lot about the Portuguese chicken and figured this was the place to go to. Came in at about 8:15, which was close to closing and wasn't busy at all. Got a whole chicken (don't remember the exact number of pieces but it was in the low double digits). The chicken was juicy, succulent, and was just flat out great. I did get there hot sauce on it, which was more of a oil based sauce to me and it accompanies the chicken well. For my sides, they had ran out of rice which greatly disappointed me, but I found a complete and greater love in the fries. The fries have like a crack seasoning on it and upon eating them, they are flat out some of the best fries in life and will put you in heaven. I also had their salad, which is your basic tossed salad to me. However what sets it off, is their mustard-vingerette dressing, which sets it off and takes it to another level of greatness. Overall this was probably the best place I had overall in Montreal. Nothing weak on the menu, the place is small (seats about 20-30), love their Portuguese pops as well and great service. Must come to in Montreal."

I stopped by on a Friday evening thanks to a sudden craving, and it hit the spot. There was a ~10 minute lineup when I arrived at 8PM. Very affordable prices for what you get - I got a 1/2 chicken with two sides for $12 (you can choose between salad, rice, and fries). Decent portions. The chicken is amazing - comparable to Ma Poule Mouillée and a LOT closer to St Laurent lol. Also got 2 natas (less than $2 each)!Other comments: Pass on the fries (they're a bit bland). The 'spicy' is not that spicy, just a little flavour kick. Getting the sauce for a little extra would help. They don't accept Amex (unfortunately). And enjoy!"
/user_details?userid=JstDKWmAZsL026ADFxf7fw,Tony Kangrui L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Long overdue review. I used to go to Romados almost on a twice weekly basis as a university student, resorting to means such as pushing a Car2Go in snowstorms to travel halfway across town for my chicken fix or going for protein-rich ""healthy"" fill-up after hitting the gym, ha!Romados is iconic for cheap & fast charcoal-grilled Portuguese chicken served with an absurd amount of fries, all brushed with oily spicy piri-piri sauce. Don't forget the Sumol or a soft drink or 1L of water to wash that down cuz gosh I'm always devouring the thing so fast that it's hard on the tubes.My only complaint about Romados is consistency of the food. From one day to the next, the chicken ranges from texture-perfect to overly-dry to stayed-in-the-warming-tray for too long. From perfectly seasoned fries to major salt attack. That's why when the fire happened and Ma Poule Mouillée opened, I became a regular of the new kids on the block instead. Now that Ma Poule Mouillée also caught on fire, guess where I'm back at.Although there are many better/more consistent joints nearby, Romados remains for me the OG of this city's overstuffed Portuguese chicken meals.Tips:- The half-chicken set meal is really big (appropriate for 2 ppl)- Get some Pastel de nata, the custard tarts- Did I mention salt attack? Don't tell my doctor, please- Places takes debit/credit, no AMEX- Call ahead to skip the line- Seating is limited, please share"

About 15 years ago, I was attracted by the smell of this rotisserie while wandering around the area, and was hooked ever since. This is my first time back after the rebuilt from the building fire. The bakery side is smaller than what I have expected from the past.However, the grilled chicken is exactly as I have remembered: moist chicken with just enough char smothered with a splash of spicy piri piri sauce. There is constantly a line up in this joint and I am not surprised. If you are in town and want some casual eat, here is an excellent choice!"

While certainly not photogenic at all, I know now why people are so crazy for this place. Quite possibly the best rotisserie chicken I have ever had! Incredibly moist and seasoned perfectly with crispy skin, what more can you ask for from chicken?! So good that I went twice in my short trip as well.You can cancel getting the portugese tarts.

We were in the mood for Portuguese food so we looked on yelp for restaurants and this place came up. It had good reviews so we decided to check it out. When we got to the place we could see a bunch of  chicken being cooked in the back. It looked amazing. My friend and I shared the half chicken meal. The portion was huge and definitely enough to share. The meal came with rice, fries and salad. The fries were fresh and crispy. The rice was very flavourful. The chicken was cooked perfectly. We loved everything about the meal. We also got the egg tarts for dessert which were again very good.You have to order your food first at the front and pay. There was very limited seating available to sit there and eat. My friend and I ate our food there but found it a little tight. Would recommend getting take out. This is not really a sit and dine kinda restaurant.If your in Montreal definitely check out this place!"

There is a cafeteria style lineup to order and pay, and an area to sit and eat as well. They also have a variety of portugese baked goods to try and sauces to purchase. FOOD: 5/5YAAS. I wish we had this place back at home because this is such a gem! Firstly their portions are MASSIVE. ~$9 for a 1/2 chicken combo already sounds great but it's actually an INSANE amount of food and variety! They fill the box right to the top! 1/2 a chicken is already so much but they top it off with a huge scoop of fries on top, as well as the salad and rice on the side. This is probably enough to feed two people.But not only are the portions big but every bite is DELICIOUS. I'm not a fan of rotisserie chicken but this place is amazing. Their piri piri sauce is SO good I dipped the fries in it. The people in front of me ordered a weeks amount of food at once, and I totally get why.SERVICE: 5/5The line for food moves a bit slower than I expected but they are very nice about it! They also have a ton of Uber eats/foodora orders coming in that they have to fulfill too. The staff were all very helpful and nice.This place is a gem I 100% recommend it!"

It comes with their famous Portuguese chicken, salad and a ton of fries on top. I really mean a ton of fries. For ~15 CAD it's a ton of food.  The chicken was really good and tender.

This place came up when I did a general search on things to do, see and eat in Montreal before leaving. Bookmarked. Also came up, while on the Mile End Food Tour. This was my first soirée with Portuguese chicken, so I had no idea what was entailed. The place doesn't have much seating, but that didn't seem to deter the long line of faithful locals. Got here around 7:30, and they had a few massive orders before us in line, so it took about 30-35 minutes from front door to table. No, there's no waitress. Seating is free-for-all. We saw how monstrous the servings were, so we went with one 1/4 dark meat chicken meal and a quarter piece extra. The meal combo has a massive heaping pile of fresh made French fries that were seasoned so perfectly, I had to remind myself to slow down and really savor the flavors. And the Portuguese seasoned chicken? Yeah, it was unbelievable!! It's roasted over flames on a caged spitfire rotation. And this is the whole dang thing roasted. None of the proportioned crap. The whole enchilada. They slide the puppies off, then BAM BAM BAM! The chicken is chopped into pieces right in front of the patrons using super sharp knifes. They do it in about 4-5 loud bangs. They bast on there special liquid seasoned rub, and end of story. Done. Chicken portions are put in styrofoam to-go container based on what you ordered (no plates and metal silverware). Chicken put in first. Then a hujass clump of fresh hot fries cover the gobble-gobble, along with the side salad and dressing in the small corner compartment. Container closed, and your handed your boxes to take to the register to pay. The whole chicken chopping process is pretty cool. And everything is made right in front of you, so no questionable practices. I absolutely, positively can't wait to go back. One of the top meals I've had in my life!"

One maybe it's just me but my experience with their food in the day is way better than in the evening. I have been thoroughly disappointed my last few visits with the quality of the food! Rice was over cooked to mush and the chicken was so dry and over cooked it hurt to swallow! They're lucky their food is so damn tasty. Second! What's the point of calling in and preordering? Makes no difference as every time I end up waiting in the line anyways. And when ppl respect their two lines, by the time I get up to the front and tell them I pre ordered, they ask my name and I still have to end up confirming what I order on the phone for them to prepare it! So what's really the point? All in all I love you guys but it sucks being disappointed by your favourite place. You have a few things to work on. For me it's more than just good food!

The menu is small but there's actually more options than I thought. Honestly, I've only ever ordered the chicken combos.- 4x 1/2 chicken, fries and salad ($9.85) - the 1/2 chicken combo with comes with a mountain of fries, side salad and rice. They also throw in a white bun. Anyways, what to say about the Portuguese chicken? Delicious. ENSURE you get the spicy sauce because it makes all the difference in the world.- Natas ($13.00 for a dozen) - no trip is legit without an order (or dozen) of natas. It's $1.45/each but gets cheaper the more you buy. So light, flaky and creamy.It's hard to pick a favourite Portuguese place in town these days but I'll end with saying Romados is cheap, filling and satisfyingly good."

They're synonymous. It's that good. Combined with the fact that their sides are also the bomb, this is easily one of my favourite spots in the city.You're probably thinking a 1/4 chicken meal wouldn't suffice a hungry stomach, but Romados gives you a ridiculous amount of sides, and good ones to boot.Their chicken was incredibly juicy and the skin with a reasonable crispiness. The chicken was on the saltier side but that's where all the flavor is. You can also taste many spices and it's amazing. They give you their chicken 'gravy/spicy sauce/oil' which is heavenly when you dip just about anything in it. The fries, the rice, and the chicken, and the result is a flavor explosion.The fries were full of garlicky and herby goodness although they weren't the same as the last time I had them which were the clean hand-cut fries. Regardless, they were crispy and delicious. The salad was a necessary component, and the rice was perfect. I really appreciate that they give you all these sides (including a bread roll). It just completes the meal experience.All this for around $10 tax included. How is this possible?!"

I only regret not getting a whole chicken lol. At the counter, they'll brush the chicken off w/ either spicy or hot. I opted for the former and it wasn't that spicy, but still good.

We ended up splitting a half chicken and a small poutine and it was plenty for us.

While the chicken was great and one can't go wrong with too many fries, the real winner for me was the nata pastries they serve here.

Let's see what this place is all about.The chicken was nice and juicy, but sadly, the sauce wasn't to my liking. Seemed a little more on the grease side as opposed to the sauce side. It wasn't horrible, but not what I was hoping for. I tried, but I just didn't taste a whole lot of spice. The fries and salad were solid. Would I return here?

I explained to my friends the wait was well worth it. 20 minutes later we were eating delicious tender succulent charcoal grilled chicken. The flavour is really out of this world. The mix of the spicy sauce and grilled flavour is 7th heaven. The fries are light and heaping in serving. Also provided was a small salad. My friends had to try the chicken poutine and it came as a massive serving with a heap of chopped chicken.

It's good to have the wife of the great patriarch of Montreal chicken ask how you are enjoying yourself in their presence.Food - yeah, as if you need to read my reviews to know that they are good.  Look at the satisfaction ratings - it's 90% above 4 stars as of Fall 2014.  But just in case you don't pay attention, here are the facts:a) Chicken - juicy tender and flavorful with that smoky flavor, the peri-peri based spicy sauce is downright addictiveb) Fries - plentiful, crisp yet soft and savory, salty like the way it should bec) Poutine - see fries.  Now add a healthy (to the cuisine, not to your heart) amount of cheese curds, properly set up so it's not cold, and then add some very warm and spicy chicken gravy on it.  It's Poutine as it was meant to be at the good places - it's pure and well crafted.  No silliness like guacamole, no bell pepper sauce, no hot dogs, no smoked meats like the has-beens at Resto La Banquise.  Just good, crispy soft greasy salty spicy dirty mess.  Like embarrassing good sex that leaves you itchy and sweaty all over.  Yes.  It's that good.d) Sumol - I know it's not an exclusive of theirs, but shots of Sumol should be poured while enjoying their chicken.  It's citrusy, it's effervescent, it's cheap(ish), won't give you a weird buzz like Guarana, and it's not coyingly sweet like those godawful American sodas.  Just do it.e) Pasteis de nata - the quintessential Portuguese custard/egg tarts.  There's a reason why they are ALWAYS sold out by 7p.  It's soft, it's crispy, it's savory, it's better than 90% of the tart practitioners in North America (and I should know - I hit the joints in Newark often).  Just buy some, and then try the other places in Montreal (a certain stall in Marche Jean-Talon comes close, just like some of the Chinatown bakeries on Rue De La Gauchetiere, but it's just not quite the same).  You'll see WHY it's better.  Value - $9.50 for a half-chicken meal, served with fries and tasty fresh salad.  Piri piri sauce optional (but highly recommended), or just fine by itself.  I dunno, the last time I ate at a Yelp 4+ stars rated place in MTL I had to fish out at least a Borden (AKA the Canadan Benjamin).  Here I whip out three Macs and got me some loonies and a toonie, that's good for me and the lady, plus we got leftovers good for breakfast the next day.  How about that.  If that's not value for the Canadian dollar, I don't know what is.  So yeah.  If you are in Montreal and just so happens to be in the Plateau, GO.  Pick up a Turkish coffee from Cafe Replika nearby, savor the evening, admire the street murals and await your turn with chicken goodness."
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is it folks.  You won't find better Portuguese chicken than this in Montreal.  In fact you'll probably have to go all the way to Portugal for better chicken.  Romados is an institution here and it has rightfully earned its legendary status.It's a fast serve place so you order at the counter and once you get your food head over to the cash to pay.  You can call ahead to order so you can skip the lines which is wise since this place can get long line-ups.  They are prepared for the crowds though so things move along quickly.  There isn't much seating so if the weather is nice you can always take your food over to nearby Parc Lafontaine for a picnic.Now let's talk about the main attraction: the chicken.  Romados claim to fame is their Portuguese-style rotisserie chicken and it is so delicious.  The chicken is tender and juicy and the skin is nice and crispy.  I like to get it with the spicy sauce because it adds a little hint of zing without being too intense.  The fries are also excellent being thick-cut (my preferred style of French fry) and seasoned to perfection with herbs and spices.  They are wildly addictive and you won't be able to leave any behind even if you're full.  Also let's face it, leaving behind Romados' chicken and fries would be downright shameful.In case the promise of Montreal's best Portuguese chicken isn't enough to entice you it gets even better.  In addition to being wildly delicious the food is dirt cheap.  A 1/4 chicken thigh with a MASSIVE side of fries and salad will only set you back about $8.  My meal in total came to $10.50 and that was because I got a drink with it.So now that you have plenty of reasons to go what are you waiting for?  Get down to Romados now!"

/user_details?userid=2XDTpvVKW2aJwlyyNWwGsg,Christina M.,"Asheville, NC",3 star rating,"This was my first experience with Portuguese char-grilled chicken.  I didn't really have any preconceptions; the closest comparison I have is Peruvian chicken a la brassa.  Major differences? The Portuguese chicken tastes like there is wine in the marinade, and the skin is not nearly as crispy.  It also comes drenched in a pretty bland piri piri chili oil rather than being served with flavorful dipping sauces.  The chicken was also a little flabbier than expected, as though the fat needed to render more.Overall, I liked but didn't love this style.  We sprang for a papo seco (fluffy, crusty Portuguese roll), which was a good call dipped in the chicken drippings. I also enjoyed trying a passion fruit soda -- not something you find every day.  Maybe one day I'll have the chance to try a competitor's chicken to see who best represents."

As I mustered up the courage to order in French, the guy behind the counter asked for our order in English. Great, I thought. But he kept questioning our order in a dismissive, impatient tone (1/2 chicken + 2-person salad), and ultimately gave us a whole chicken - a mistake I didn't realize till the cashier rang up over $20. We accepted the mistake, chalked it up to bad communication on our part. But then were told cash/Canadian debit only. ""Well, we COULD take credit card if you don't have enough cash,"" she said, while watching me fumble for cash. Why the rule of cash/debit if you're wiling to concede? More importantly, why no sign of ""cash/debit only"" anywhere? (I looked - none in English or French) Meanwhile, the cashier turned to her colleague, rolled her eyes, and chuckled her look-at-these-dumb-tourists chuckle. How un-Canadian! ... I can say this because I'm Canadian, and we'd experienced great service everywhere else in Montreal as tourists.I came up 65 cents short in cash, apologized, and thought she'd simply let it go given the total amount. But she stared at me, shrugged, and repeated ""cash or debit card only."" No mention of credit card this time. We gave up a drink to reduce the bill, and bought the whole chicken - the leftover of which still tasted good the next day, but not enough to rid of the sour taste left in our mouths."

My friends and I made this our first stop after driving 5 hours from Toronto. The fries and chicken went a lot way to fill our empty bellies and warm us up on a cold night.For three people, we ordered a Poutine with pork, a half-chicken with fries, and two soups of the day (veggie). Ramados' generous serving sizes meant this was more than enough for us.The chicken was flavorful, but a bit dry. The fries were very delicious. I actually disagree with other reviews that said the fries here are greasy - I detected no unusual amount of grease with mine. The Poutine is mediocre. Flavorful gravy, but no squeaky cheese curds, which signals a quality Poutine. The veggie soup had good flavor. It was quite thick and seemed to be made with a potato base.Seating was a nightmare, even around 8-9 pm. Order yours to go or be prepared to get aggressive. No Canadian kindness from me.

We ordered a delivery directly from Romados; 4 chickens, fries and salad with extra sauce. They charged us for the additional sauce and for the delivery (which they notified us about ahead of time). We were shocked by what we received! It was a big deception!When opening the bag, there was sauce everywhere specially the extra sauce. Additionally, the bag in which the chicken came, got perforated and the chicken fell out of it. They fell everywhere. That's really unprofessional!

Nothing fancy, no gimmicks, no attitude and amazing prices. Just roasted Portuguese chicken, fries, sauce, salad and a bread and Portuguese and French pastry counter.There is absolutely nothing more that I can add except to say that if you are visiting Montreal or a naive Montrealer who has never gone then GO. Like NOW.Chicken roasted to perfection, juicy and yet still practically falling off the bone. So good that you're going to use your hand to get right into the bone as well.And then the fries. These are perfect salt and pepper fries, which reminded me of the salt and pepper chips which the Kettle brand makes. Try to get them slathered with the spicy sauce and it's a joygasm in your mouth. They also sell homemade Portuguese sausages, buns and of course natas, their sweet egg custard cups which are probably the best in the city.For $13 bucks for a whole chicken, it's worth your while to pick up a bird or two, a large order of fries and take them home, keep them in glass containers to keep them fresh, and you have a great lunch meal to take to work for a couple of days.While you're waiting in line, it's an interesting place to people watch. Everybody seems to come here, I saw Portuguese aunties, guys from the hip hop crowd, snotty Westmount chicks waiting in the Land Rovers outside, professionals coming from work and everyone in between. That's the thing about great food; it brings everyone together."

I probably wouldn't go to this place again, cause I feel it's not worth the wait. However, price wise it is very reasonable. The salad is very basic, nothing special.

Romados seems to be the most popular place to go for Portuguese chicken, it was recommended to me a dozen times. I had high hopes based on the extreme hype I received and I was mostly satisfied. I got the chicken sandwich and fries, my boyfriend got the 1/2 chicken and fries. I also got a Portuguese egg tart. The fries were solid, hand cut and tossed in a tasty salty seasoning. The portions were generous. The chicken sandwich itself was tasty too, the chicken was very juicy and tender and I like the hot sauce they put on it, so much so that I bought a little container of it and poured it on everything, it kind of reminds me of chili oil more than any other hot sauce I've tried. I actually didn't like the bun they put it on, I'm not a huge fan of crusty bread, I ended up tearing a bunch of it off. The skin on my boyfriend's chicken was mindblowing, much better than kfc's. mmmm.The real star of the show was the egg tart for me oddly enough. They're sooo good. They're just tarts with custard in them, I'm not sure what makes them so delicious but they're creamy and flaky and amazing. I bought a box of 6 on my way home to Halifax. Try the Portuguese sodas. They're great. They have tons of different baked goods, and different items on the menu besides chicken that I'd love to try. Not to mention its very reasonably priced. If I lived in Montreal I'd be a regular."

So this review is solely based on the fries and service. I ordered a small fry to go and noticed they scooped the fries out of a metal bowl that wasn't even being heated.. The fries were dry and barely warm. I requested gravy but they said they didn't offer it except for with poutine?!?!  But I don't really eat dairy so I just wanted gravy and would pay extra.. Nope they refused to sell me gravy. I only had a few bites as the fries were dry and then when I got home (TMI sorry) I rushed to the bathroom. I guess my system rejected this crap.PS- no A/C during 33 degree weather.My tip to you: Go here when it's busy and make sure there's a bathroom nearby.
/user_details?userid=Rq8m7cL8SG7mYgNvOXq80w,Marine B.,"Paris, France",3 star rating,"Romados has the best facade. It also has very good chicken. But the service is tremendously bad - as if they knew they were a local institution anyway, so no need to be nice to customers. The cooks / cashiers don't say hi or thanks, there are signs everywhere that you are not allowed to drink anything else than what you buy here, and your chicken is thrown in a plastic bag with about as much care as Trump discussing women's rights. Also, prices make no sense - it is more expensive to order 4 portions of chicken and fries than 2*2 portions. How?!!!"
/user_details?userid=1TC5reWTNXrMHCynBAfH9w,Tuan L.,"Austin, TX",4 star rating,"Two visits in one trip pretty much sums up how much I enjoyed Romados. The thing I love about this is the chicken first of all and you get a complete meal for a very reasonable price. Let's start with the chicken. The chicken is marinated in their special blend of Portuguese goodness. It's then butterflied onto their rotisserie racks which is cooked slowly over a open flame. While the racks turn, the fat renders from the chicken and juices from the chicken drips onto the neighboring racks causing each chicken to base it it's own juice. This process keeps the chicken from staying moist and tender. To order the process is quite simple. You can either order the chicken by itself or combo meal which come with fries, rice, small salad, and roll. The chicken comes in the following sizes, from 1/4, 1/2, to full, and spicy or not. If you order 1/4 chicken, you can either request leg or breast. The fries are enough for 2 to 4 skinny people or 2 fat people. In other words, they give you a lot of fries. The fries are piled on the whole plate covering everything so you have to dig through the fries to get to the chicken. The rice is not so great. It doesn't have much flavor and pretty dry for my taste. The side salad is pretty much that, a side salad topped with their dressing.In addition to having great chicken they also have a variety of baked goods. I do not know the name of these wonderful delights, but the egg custard thing was awesome. It reminded me of the the Chinese version that I see at dim sum and Asian bakeries. I also had their chocolate eclairs. I'm guessing it's more of a french thing than Portuguese, however the eclairs were delicious. Each eclair cost 1 Canadian dollar. Normally you find eclairs for 3x as much and much smaller. Seating is very limited, but from my experience, it seems like most people order their food to go."

I had the quarter dark meat, without any type of sauce. It doesn't need any sauce as far as I am concerned. The meat was juicy and extremely tasty. The fries were perfectly seasoned and they were really nice and crispy. I am a big fan of crunchy textured foods and these fries were perfect. The small little salad on the side was good, wish they would give you more, as their homemade dressing was delicious!!! The drink and pastry were really great as well, both were not overly sweet.The staff were really great, friendly and nice. I do not speak a word of French and that was no problem. They took their time explaining the menu and answered all my questions. I got there late afternoon on a Thursday in late October and the place was not full at all, had no problem snagging a table.I ate absolutely every last morsel of what they put in front of me.

To this day my Avo still buys her natas from Romados, which truly speaks to how authentic they are. They also have specialty Portuguese products you can't find anywhere else, like the real deal chorizo and massa de pimentao. They are famous for the portuguese chicken but their baked goods are made fresh and I highly recommend ordering pao seco or natas (or quejiadas if you are from the Azores) next time you visit."

Romados is Romados, and even after I've gotten their roast chicken multiple times during my studies here, I never get tired of them. My go-to order is the half roast chicken combo with salad and fries, and they always give you so much for what you pay for. It's impossible for your mouth to NOT water while the wafts of savory, juicy chicken reach your olfactory receptors. And once you bite into it - my personal favorite parts are the legs and thighs as I think breast meat is somewhat bland - the collective harmony of crispy and peppery skin, spicy sauce, and bone-licking good meat all seems to make sense. Served superbly with a fresh salad and vinaigrette along with crispy, yet soft-on-the-inside fries, it will always be a hit. I can never pick between Ma Poule Mouillée and this place as they both hit the spot. Enjoy!"

/user_details?userid=LMaU1eIPujKxtG9wGtIomg,Tim F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Mmm chicken. Said to be an institution in the heart of Montreal's historically Portuguese neighborhood, the menu of the day featured both chicken soup and BBQ Salmon. Both options made my mouth water but seeing the dozen or so BBQ chickens in the background grilling, not to mention the aromas of chicken from block away, I really couldn't bring myself to try the fish. Ordering:This is not a traditional sit down restaurant. To the right are pastries and bread you can order at an walk up counter. To the left are some tables to eat at should you decide to eat on site. And down the middle are two line ups, one for preorder pick up and one for ordering. My girlfriend and I opted for a large chicken poutine to share along with a chicken soup and a traditional Portuguese dessert, pastel de nata. The food:First - A large chicken poutine: It's literally assembled in front of you. The staff took our order and grabbed two chicken thighs from the grill, stripped the meat off the bones and packed it into a Styrofoam box - I dock of points for Styrofoam  - with gravy, cheese and fries. There was so much food; between us we could have easily shared a small.  The chicken was so delicious - moist bbq chicken cooked and flavoured perfectly -  though with the fries, gravy and cheese it was salty for my taste. Second - the soup was also generous in proportion.  I can see myself needing/wanting/craving it on a cold day or if I had the flu. The chicken melted in my mouth, but the noodles were soggy. Lastly - among the wide choice of pasties, the pastel de nata is definitely the way to go. It was a nice way to end the meal, not too sweet, the pastry flaked off nicely and it's making my mouth water now thinking about it. Overall - the value for money is unbeatable. It's totally possible to have dinner with leftover for lunch the next day on ten bucks per person."

This is a Portuguese chicken Makkah for BBQ lovers from all over town and the world!  There is always, always, always a line. The first time I went there I looked at the line and kept on walking, but then I passed by the window to the kitchen, took one look at the rotisserie and went back to the line... I was not disappointed, and I keep coming back again and again.  There is a line for spontaneous people, and a line for people who pre-order on the phone, but most people just don't do that.  However, don't worry, the line moves steadily, and sure enough, you'll get there - and get to ask the servers for what you desire. They have all kinds of combos - 1/4, 1/2 or whole chicken with fries / rice and salad.  Sometimes they will make you choose between rice and fries and other times they will give some of both, depending on the server's mood. When they are in really good mood, you will get extra pices of chicken as well (happened to me once!). The portion size is huge though, and I was never able to finish. I always have leftovers for the next day.  Other times I just come in to get a whole chicken to take home, and that keeps me going for a few days! They also have sandwiches, but the Bifana (pork sandwich) is not nearly as good as the chicken.The quality of the chicken is consistently superb. It's super tasty and I personally prefer the spicy sauce. The down side to this place, other than the line, is that the servers just throw the food in Styrofoam boxes, and their way of chucking lots of everything in there unfortunately extends to the the salad dressing as well... the box is always overstuffed with goodness, but it's more of a take out thing, and for those who want to sit down and eat there, it's kind of a bummer to be eating out of Styrofoam... (no plates! or non plastic cutlery).While their prices are very reasonable, sometimes you can get coupons that will make it even cheaper!"

Their chicken entrees, comes in all sizes in multiple of 1/4 with tasty crunchy fries and salad, comes out to be under $10 or an entire chicken for sharing between four people for $24, what a steal. The chicken itself is extremely tender, every string of meat down to the last of breast tastes juicy, no evidence of dryness at all. The sauce was delicious, it reminds me a little of the flavor from China's smelly tofu, slightly spicy and full of flavor. The accompanying portion of fries has an rustic and chewy flavor, resembling the richness of the skin of potato wedges. We inhaled the meal in under a few minutes.

It seems to have been cooked well -- not dry and the skin was somewhat crisp. The main problem is that it had an unusual ""off"" flavor (almost like a spoiled taste), which I think comes from the hot sauce that they slathered on it. Maybe it's just me, but I find it rather unpleasant.A whole chicken combo (which they call a family combo) includes an ungodly amount of fries (which were pretty decent) and a pretty good salad.I'm sad this wasn't as amazing as other reviews make it out to be."

I ate at Joe Beef, and all the top restaurants in old town and Rotissire Romados kicked them all to the curb. 1/2 chicken with spicy sauce, fresh fries, and salad... all for under $10? You seriously can't beat that. The chicken juices and hot sauce seep into the fries if you let it sit for a few minutes. Take yours to-go, walk down to La Fontaine Park and enjoy the best chicken while sitting on the grass. I wish we had a restaurant like this in San Francisco!"

It's such a good deal that buying chicken alone here, already cooked and seasoned, can be cheaper than buying a chicken at the supermarket. The fries and salad are mediocre and I think the chicken is really the highlight here. You can reserve your chicken ahead of time to avoid waiting in line, so make sure to do that if you go during busy hours. Romados is simply the best budget meal you can buy in the area. Highly recommend."

Ugh, shut up.That said, I call Rotisserie Romados ""the purveyor of the single greatest roasted chicken dinner I have ever had in my entire life, based on my level of hunger, state of sobriety and availability of Five Alive juice drink.""From the millisecond we stepped through the front door, the unreal aroma of those no-longer-egg-laying, piri-slathered, fire-kissed birds and fresh baked bread had us throwing 'bows to skip the line. In our minds, anyway. Other Yelpers talk about the pastry counter that tempts the poultry patrons, but I cannot comment. I wanted - nay, NEEDED - chiggin.A mere 15 minutes and 18$ CAD later, we're presented with Styrofoam go-boxes overstuffed with tender white and dark meat, a mountain of crispy crinkle-cut fries and a surprisingly fresh salad of mixed greens tossed in a light (mustard?) vinaigrette. We sat, transfixed. I took a picture of chicken for the first time ever. We ate. My soul took a picture of chicken for the first time ever.Remember those people that name everything? They might also be the type to talk about fleeing the States in times of political strife. ""Can you believe Congress?,"" they'll say, ""That's it. I'm moving to Canada."" Whatever.

The chicken was tender and well cooked but wayyyyyyy too salty, and so was the salad dressing. The portion sizes are great for the price (understatement: HUGE) but I just wish they would add less salt to the chicken and maybe not overly dress the salad--or even better--leave it plain since everything else is salty and oily? The service was a bit questionable--we had an incident where we were refused tap water even though we were customers?

I've been to Romados several times before when the food was decent with generous portions but today was not their day. First off, if you've bought a Groupon, they don't tell you to first head to the cash to validate it. So we waited in line to order food only to then be told to go line up at the cash before coming back to order our food. Then we go back to the guy prepping the food with our validated Groupon who's fulfilling our order and he hands us a bag of fries. We're hungry, we've been waiting for a while so we start eating them until he says ""no, you don't get fries, only poutine"" and takes it back only to throw the rest in with the large batch of fries for other customers. How DISGUSTING and unhygienic. Finally (to put the cherry on top), we decided at the last minute to take a small bottle of coke instead of the 1.5L water bottle included in our order. The old woman behind the cash literally opens the door and is ready to chase us down the street, which almost gets me run over at this point, and rudely tells me to return the coke that I stole. I explain that I took the coke instead of the water but at this point, the experience had deteriorated to a point of no return. She grabbed the coke, returns it to the fridge, and doesn't even bring me my water. When I ask her for it, she tells me to go get it myself and won't even look at me. Congratulations, you really stopped someone from stealing(!) I will make sure to try every single one of their competitors instead and never return. Word of mouth is a powerful tool and you've just lost a loyal customer."

Judging by the setup, they are prepared for insane lines. Luckily for me there was no line at 8pm and I was in and out in less than 5 minutes. I got a 1/2 chicken and some unnamed desserts; one tart and another thing that looked like an ice cream come. Dude the chicken smell filled up my car and turned me into one of those eating and driving people that we all hate. The chicken was awesome! No need for sauce, ketchup or any other dressings. It was nice and juicy and even glazed the fries with some of its awesome. The salad was a bust as the chicken was hot off the fire and caused the greens to wilt before I could eat it.

On the one hand, the food here is consistently delicious and cheap; the kind of feel-good food you treat yourself to on a weekend or a busy weeknight. You've seen the reviews.On the other hand, ordering from here is a huge pain. Ordering in advance serves no real purpose (I've ended up waiting longer than the walk-ins every time) and the line system is confusing and poorly laid out. For instance, there's a reason every fast food place ever has you order and pay at the start : it avoids the type of checkout bottleneck that is at this point a staple of Romados. Another annoyance is the two side-by-side order lines with no divider; a solution that would be much more elegant and effective than 3 different signs above and below customers' line of sight (cue arguments with other patrons). And another: no credit card and no paywave payments make payment unnecessarily slow every time. I could go on.But when all is said and done, the chicken is so good that I still end up braving the crowds and coming here nearly once a week. Problem is, Romados' management knows it, too."

And I don't feel that the quality has changed over the years - even after a fire and major upgrade in capacity. You still can't beat the price of a half-chicken dinner. We had one each last week, which we took to the park. We are not tiny eaters and we only finished half of our respective dinners. We ate the second part as a fully satisfying lunch on the train back to Toronto and still had extra fries which made it into an omelette at breakfast the next day! Fries are plentiful but also top notch. The only drawback over the years has been with increasing popularity the line-up has grown. Sometimes this has us holding back, but it is always worth the wait. Or call ahead and get in the pick up line like a pro (which we never do)."

Has that classic neighborhood bakery look/feel. There are two lines, if you're only ordering bread/pastries/stuff from the freezer, get on the bakery side. Chicken is the left side.Rotisserie doesn't start until 11 am. So if you show up early and there's no line, that's because only the bakery is open. Once lunch time rolls around, no matter what day of the week, there is a wait. We queued up at 11:30 and even though the line wasn't out the door, we still waited maybe more than 30 mins. So if you live in the area, call ahead. Limited seating, but when we went, not many people were sitting to eat, so you might find an open table during lunch time so long as your group is small.//Food\\Very reasonable prices, generous portions of fries (short, thick cut). For the popularity and wait time, I just didn't get the hype behind the chicken. Maybe I should've gotten the spicy seasoning, because beside a strong taste of wine, the chicken didn't taste that special to me. It's not bad, but not a taste I'd wait so long in line for. The seasoning on the fries are good, but a little too sweet for me. You get a lot of fries for what you order, so think twice before placing a separate order or even going for the medium or large fries.I really liked the egg tarts.The crust itself was thick, chewy, layered, and flavorful. A good pastry base, which isn't always present in most egg tarts. Although the custard was much too sweet for me (with a smooth and non-curdled consistency), I was pretty impressed by the crust, and my kids thought these were the best they'd ever had."

This was by far the best meal of my trip!Located in The Plateau neighborhood, Rotisserie Romados is about an 8-10 minute walk from the Mont Royal Metro station.  Upon first glance, I honestly thought that the outside facade of the eatery reminded me of a church.  That being said, this ""church of chicken"" is a fairly small eatery with a few seats if you choose to eat in, but primarily a place to order take out.  Besides the roast chicken, Rotisserie Romados also has a bakery that serves up a pretty respectable selection of mouth watering Portuguese pastries.As far as the food is concerned, let's just say that something is seriously wrong with you if you leave here hungry.  Eager to feast on some chicken that I had heard so much about, I ordered the 1/2 Chicken Plate that came with a salad and was covered with a  mountain of fries.  At only $8 CAD, this was such a great deal especially with the portions being so generous.  Grilled over charcoal, the roast chicken was extremely moist on the inside, but still retained a crispy crunch on the outside.  Although the chicken was probably tasty enough as is, I decided to have my chicken slathered with a spicy Piri Piri Sauce to get the full Portuguese Chicken experience since I had come all the way from Hawaii.  The spices from the Piri Piri sauce and the drippings from the chicken were the perfect sauce to dip my fries in to scoop up all that yummy flavor.If this were not good enough, the lady at the register also added in a free dessert to my lunch.  This would be more than enough for most people, but I always have room for dessert.  I do not speak any French or Portuguese, but I made sure to remember the words ""Pastel De Nata.""  This Portuguese Custard Tart was the perfect end to my chicken feast and just blew my mind by how creamy delicious it was.       Just writing this review makes my mouth water and brings back fond memories of my trip to Montreal."

The chicken was moist and the sauce was just the right amount of savory and spicy. I had the rice (passed on the fries as I had A LOT of poutine recently - that said the frites looked very good) with my chicken. As a first time visitor to Montreal, I was told by friends to visit Romados; you guys did a great job! Highly recommend!"

Rue Rachel was closed down and St Laurent was packed but we finally found a parking spot and made our way to Romados.The place is pretty small and there was  a LONG line. The line on the left is for people who haven't phoned in an order and the line on the right was for people who had ordered by phone and is coming by for pickup. In my honest opinion, both lines seemed to be going at the same pace. There are also sodas on the side - I recommend the pineapple soda.We ordered the $20 family meal which can easily feed a family of 3-4. A whole chicken chopped up, drenched in sauce, a HUGE bag of poutines, and a box of salad. ALL FOR $20. It is a cheap meal and fed my family of 4 pretty well.The chicken is moist and the sauce goes really well with it. The poutines are AWESOME and are well salt and peppered. The salad has a vinagarette sauce which makes you less guilty for eating something that is so greasy. Overall, a really good meal that is flavorful. There is limited seating and the place gets pretty packed. Most people were taking their food to go.The servers were super friendly. Then again, most of the people that I've met in Montreal are super friendly. Bottom Line: Traveling around Montreal? This is definitely a hole in the wall to try out!"

The taste of Ramados chicken is really nostalgic to me since I've been eating it since I was a little girl. I went back yesterday with my partner, I had the 1/2 spicy chicken with fries, salad, rice and a nata on the side, while they had the chicken poutine. We both loved it, I was in heaven eating the delicious food after waiting something crazy like 3 years. Still as good as I remember!"

Got to the hotel and opened up the container and was in shock at how much fries there were. The chicken was moist and flavourful and the fries were a bit soggy but pretty good over all.

For $11 bucks total, you can have half a chicken and a ton of fries(you can opt out from the salad and get more fries). Everything is seasoned really well and you have wonderful flavor in each bite! The food will definitely hit the spot if you come in hungry. For global customers, this would be one tier higher than Nando's in taste!"

Sauce on the chicken but also tell him or her to put on the fries.  Trust me.As you sit down and open the box, just be careful.  The fries might be overflowing.When you will bite into the perfectly cooked chicken, you won't be able to help but notice how crispy the skin is and how juicy and smokey the meat is.  It literally falls off the bone! Just make sure you lick those bones clean, I sure know I do!I don't live in Montreal anymore, but when I do come back, I make sure I make a pit stop at Romados.  Every time my friends tell me they're going to Montreal, I tell them they have to go to Romados.  They come back thanking me and telling me that it was the best chicken they have had in their lives!  YES, I'm serious!Once you're done, if you still have space left, get one of their pasteis de nata (Portuguese custard tarts).  Simply delicious.  By far the best place for Portuguese chicken, or any chicken for that matter, in Montreal.  There's a reason that there's always a line up."
/user_details?userid=FUA0fhXu8v2MvDul4qzTTA,Kyle A.,"Whitestown, IN",5 star rating,"Awesome place to get a heaping pile of greasy, delicious chicken and fries. As American tourists, we found the menu (which is mostly pictures) very confusing, but in the end it didn't matter. Go up to the counter and ask for half a chicken. They'll put it in a box with a huge helping of fries and a salad. Throw in a drink for around 14$ Canadian.Once you sit down to eat, you'll have to excavate your chicken from under the fries and it'll be an oh-so-delicious process. The chicken juices and BBQ mingle with the fries and make everything taste that much more delicious.PRO TIP: The first night we went, the place was super crowded and we tried to eat standing up. A helpful local suggested that we take our dinners a block (north)east on Rue Rachel to a neighborhood bar. The bar was next to a bike shop and had absolutely no sign on it, but was a fantastically chill place with a sort of 60's vibe to the decor. Perfect spot to enjoy some beer with our chicken and fries."

The chicken was moist, perfect spices, and the hot sauce had a good amount of heat. If you want more heat, ask for more sauce. Surprisingly, the side salad that came with it was perfect to cool off the heat from the hot sauce on the chicken. Fries were good, but I can't say I remember too much about it. Service is fast and the place really seems more for take-out or eat and run. Use your fingers when eating this chicken and eat everything off the bone. I didn't try the pastries, but maybe next time when I return to Montreal. Simple (protein) food, decent price.. I can't find anything wrong with that."

Warning, they DUMP tons of fries on top of the chicken/salad. The chicken was juicy and the sauce is really nice and a kick to it. The fries are really good. It's the way I like it, lots of pepper. The lady at the cashier offered bread, and i said yes. This is a lot of carbs and it's gonna be a pretty heavy meal.I really wish that they had egg tarts at the time.

The chicken was nice and tender with a crispy skin and had a nice spicy sauce to it. The fries come well seasoned with herbs and spices and taste even better when you upgrade it to poutine.

Walking along Rachel, there was that unmistakable smell, that scent of grilled portuguese chicken. (Note line ups here are not just insane, they are UNSANE! Best to order for pick-up ahead of time)Back then there was this tiny adorable Portuguese lady who took your order from the window (a really really tiny window before they renovated). From personal experience and observation, this lady would flirt with every man, young or old. I would order in my bad portugeshe - ""Peito du frangu avec fritash et salada"" to which she would respond with an impressed ""bravu"". There were times when i would just order only the chicken, she would ask in a disappointed tone ""pas da fritash?, but when no one was looking, would sneak in some fries for me!!!!!She doesn't work there anymore, but the quality of this place is everlast.

Once we took a good look at the menu, we noticed that the line behind us was out the door. We picked up lunch, which was so delicious and filling that we didn't need dinner that day. For ~$8 for a half chicken, special sauce, small salad and boatload of fries it is a real bargain! It's a ton of food (especially if you aren't bashful with the fries) that remarkably leaves you feeling full in a good way.  The meal also came with a huge Portuguese-style roll that I didn't eat until the next day at breakfast.The chicken was excellent - wings and legs were perfect, though the breast a little dry. The ""spicy"" sauce was a perfect touch, more an addition of flavor and moisture and a gentle hint of spice. It was a perfect dipping sauce for the fries at the end. The fries themselves were outstanding - seasoned to perfection with a hint of aromatic sweetness that seemed like celery. Yum!"

Grab an interesting-looking drink from the cooler and lots of extra napkins, then walk over to Park Lafontaine, sit by the pond and gobble it all up. Even after eating your fill, you will probably have enough leftovers to make yourself a sandwich using the yummy bun.Catch a show at Théâtre de Verdure in the evening as the sun goes down.

I ordered a 1/4 chicken meal which you have a choice of white or dark meat for a $1 difference. They only have two sauces that they slather on your chicken, mild or spicy. I highly suggest that you go with spicy. It's not incredibly spicy but it is extremely tasty! The meal comes with delicious, crispy fries (have them put a little sauce on that too), and a side salad (so you feel so bad for eating all of those fries). With a drink, my total came out to just shy of $10. Though, the amount of food I received could have fed me for 2 meals. They also have pastries and baked goods, which I wish I wasn't so full after the meal or I would've indulged. Overall, it's delicious, fast and affordable food and I'd happily eat there again."

In fact, I've never actually eaten at Romados. Sometimes the lineups are very long. The wait is worth it though because the BBQ chicken is that good, hands down. Big portion, little price. Fries are nicely seasoned but VERY greasy. Romados is best with a side of Netflix or the park when the weather is nice! Outside of that: great meal, great value, and great BBQ chicken. Once the fries get cold you should throw them out because they won't be edible anymore. You'll know when you're in a Romados kinda mood."
/user_details?userid=ogWRV3CCqcQ9QRmZbANxTg,Raja Sudeep B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Hi everyone ! Here goes my  first review... I am a big foodie and my craving for spicy Indian style grilled chicken brought me to Ramados ( after extensive search online - Portuguese chicken). I ordered a half grilled chicken (spicy) for a take away. I was really surprised to see the large portion of fries with the three large pieces of chicken. The meat was falling off the bone and had all the flavors. The fries and the salad soaked in those flavors gave an added taste. Really tasty and absolutely delicious. Reasonable pricing.Though I would prefer more spice in the chicken but I have no complaints. I loved the food. I would surely visit them again.
/user_details?userid=U8HPxbR61-xgSEJdxbAdEA,Andrei Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The half-chicken is an amazing deal! Comes with fries and salad, and the chicken itself is very well seasoned and full of flavor. The seating space is a little bit limited though, and the pastry section's desserts seemed not very fresh. Altogether, a great experience because the chicken was top notch. I will definitely revisit this place, but I suggest to avoid the desserts section in the evening."
/user_details?userid=VXbi8ndacawnd6kidQF8dw,Marie P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"So I have nothing to say against the food. The chicken is always super tasty and well cooked. My chicken sandwich was excellent and my salad was good. The only thing is I wish they put a bit more love in their service. I mean the lady literally throw a huge handful of salad in my styrofoam box, add way too much dressing and force the cover to close. So I'm walking with salad hanging out my box and dressing dripping all over...not the end of the world but I like love served with my food. That's all."

There is also a bakery here and some authentic Brazillian products, but I didn't have any more room in my belly after I consumed half a chicken.

Being Portuguese i basically took the reigns for ordering for my friends the chicken was amazing perfectly tender with crispy fries and an awesome spicy sauce. If I lived in Montreal this place would be the death of me. I also bought 6 Pastel de Nata (custard dessert with a flaky crust) by far the best version i've had in a while. I usually get them in CT but these were defiantly memorable. BTW  you get a 1/2 chicken fries and salad for 9.95 theres no beating that.

Rotisserie Romados offers the most delicious chicken. The place isn't the most attractive or spacious, but that doesn't stop people from waiting in line to get some good food.After waiting in line for 30 minutes, I got my quarter chicken combo (chicken, salad & fries) - around $7. At my request, the chicken was smothered in spicy oil sauce which gave a nice mild spicy taste to the food. The chicken is very juicy, hot, tender and perfect! The salad was good and the fries were thick but lacked the crispiness I like, but they tasted really good too. The portions are gigantic- you've been warned. Romados doesn't have lots of seating space and is usually crowed. The bakery there seemed nice and the staff was nice and efficient. I didn't like how my hot food was placed in a floppy styrofoam box- yuck.

Romados chips + 1/4 chicken + gravy made from the spicy sauce = deliciousness. If you haven't gotten it yet go and do that now. Also as a word of caution - the poutine portion is enormous.Always call ahead before coming. It's not like they take your order over the phone and set it aside; it just allows you to rock up in front of everyone and get your order in. Silly system but might as well take use of it."

It was just plain old chicken and rice with fries and salad on the side. I was expecting something great but I guess my expectations were too high!

The sandwiches are just the chicken in a bun. Nothing fancy.The pastries and bread aren't worth it, to be honest.TIP:The seating is limited and is that of a Deli. If you aren't planing on eating in, I recommend ordering ahead of time via phone. You do NOT want to be stuck in one of the busy long line on a weekend.

Good price, good value but most of all amazing taste. Chicken comes in two flavours mild and spicy.Been going here for over 15 years (before it burned and got re-built) and it is consistently good. Wish they had good seating area but there is a park not far."

It wasn't too busy on a Tuesday afternoon thankfully so we got our food quickly and found some open seats. Their seating is limited but there is a park nearby so that wouldn't have been a bad idea to take it to go and eat there. We got the half chicken which came with so much fries. The chicken was seasoned so well and the sauce is very good. I thought the half chicken was more than enough to share between two people.

I ordered the same at Romados and this place met expectations. Chicken meat was juicy (I skipped the skin as I usually do); they brushed a sauce over it which was tasty (I got the mild sauce, but I believe customers have a choice of mild or hot). Fries (plain frites) are delicious. Salad was a green salad - lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, with a vinaigrette - overall good balance of flavors in the combo order."

The salad was huge and I swear the fries were never ending and they were REALLY good fries too! The chicken was moist and spicy and so delicious, I now dream of it."

The shop is on the edge of a sweet little neighborhood. Parking is plentiful or you can easily ride your bike here. Great bike lanes all the way down Rachel. Ordering was funny. For me. Not for my mom who fumbled her way through that only written in French menu. She tried to order by the price. I'm laughing now only because it was so damn cute. I love my mom, even moreso when she tries to speak French with her sweet southern twang. The chicken is moist. Juicy. Delicious. Spicy. Just like something else I know. It's kind of indescribably good. Really. It comes with a MOUND of french fries, so you're better off just ordering a whole chicken platter. Split it with someone and you have a delicious, filling meal for under $15. Order it spicy. Eat it there, although the space is a bit uncomfortable. I just cannot imagine it would be as good later on."

/user_details?userid=V6MsTK2hkVOMqilpcZpb1A,Yu Z.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"My well anticipated visit to Romados! Having heard so much of this rotisserie, I arrived with high expectations.We each ordered the 1/4 chicken meal, which comes with a side salad and a mountain of fries. Gosh. If you are craving fries, these will have you satisfied for weeks to come. Apparently you can ask for rice too (50/50), which I regret not doing because the meal gets quite dulling with only fries.OK, now about the actual food. It was good, but not enough to leave me breathless. Now I gotta say, the chicken was well cooked and very savoury. The side salad stole the show for me. Fresh, crunchy, aromatic. I need their salad dressing. It balances the dryness of the rest of the lunch. Fries were slightly cold and not crispy enough, yet the spices generously coated on the fries still leave you wanting more. Tip for those who still haven't visited Romados yet... Get yourself something to drink !! or bring a bottle of water with you. The amount of salt you ingest is crazy!VERDICT: I liked their food, everything was very flavourful, but sometimes a little bit overwhelming (saltiness). Price is very reasonable considering the abundance of food served. 1/4 chicken is definitively more than enough for lunch. Location is not optimal and it's a hassle to find a place to sit. Good idea as takeout to go for picnic. I will return if ever I am by the neighbourhood, I am intrigued to try their poutine!"

I ordered a full chicken and the fries for 2 people. This time they put the fries separately, in a bag, and this allowed them to be way less soggy. I was able to appreciate their seasoning for the first time this way. Anyway, no matter what, it's a win-win going here!

I opted for the 1/4 chicken breast and my boyfriend got the 1/2 chicken both with spicy sauce, we also got 2 drinks and 6 custard tarts and it came to about $27 which is reasonable. I was expecting a lot from the chicken and it wasn't up to what I expected as I make Portuguese chicken at home and I have eaten it in Portugal and it doesn't really compare and was a little dry. You also get salad and a lot of chips with it, dip the chips in the spicy sauce to make them taste better. Overall, it is a lot of food so a couple could easily get a half chicken and that would be enough. The Custard tarts were probably the best thing but you don't get any free with your meal anymore but they are still worth a try.Overall, worth a visit for quantity but far from the best chicken I have ever eaten and definitely not worth waiting for a long time in line."

A downside is that it'll be hard to find a seat, but you can walk to Mont Royal park and eat there if you have the patience!And if you order a meal deal at the weekend until 2pm, there's bread and a pastry included... if you can eat them!

You get in the long line, you scope for hints that people are leaving one of the three tables, you figure out what you're ordering in advance to getting to the counter, you get it spicy. It's not really much of a task to figure out what to order; besides the baked goods at another counter all they do is chicken. And my, they do it well. I ordered the quarter chicken meal: chicken, salad, rice and French fries. The chicken was so tender, so fall-off-the-bones, I didn't want to use any cutlery. Spicy wasn't spicy, just spiced and just right. I didn't get the rice, still not sure whose fault that is. The salad was unnecessary. A lot of it just got soggy and cooked beneath the chicken. The fries on the other hand were great. A bit over-peppered at times, but still rank A. The portion was HUGE. $6.99 for a Styrofoam meal box. And then they give you a bun at the cash register too! I guess it's like them giving you a business card to try out their bakery. I say take the plunge, the roll was a nice addition and all the treats on display looked really good. Four stars for the fries (I'm disregarding the other sides), five stars for that chicken. So I'm rounding up. Oh, that chicken. If you can get past the dozens on rotating chickens, the black gloves the intense looking men use as they wield their meat cleavers and that long line then go.  Join the club."

Call and put in the order or you will be waiting in line drooling for 15-30 minutes.My GF and I order 1/2 of poulet combo. It came with Fries and Salad. The bill was around 10 bucks or so. The bird was bar b q really well. They give you a big portion. We try not to order big meal because we want to go to as many places as we can when we were in MTL.

Yet, the meal I would have again in a heartbeat, the meal that highlighted my stay, resides in this amazing and humble establishment. For a light lunch, my parents and I split a half a chicken and fries. The chicken was perfectly cooked: mind-blowingly flavorful, juicy and enveloped in the crispiest, tastiest skin. Also, the chicken had the perfect level of spiciness, whetting the appetite with each bite. On top of this, the fries were a mountain of pillowy potatoes which I would say rivals if not tops Pommes Frites in New York. Once you put one of these babies in your mouth, you can forget about that diet you've been trying to keep because you will not be able to control yourself! I have to stop now because I'm literally salivating too much. Rotisserie Romados is definitely worth it in every sense of the word!"

You walk in then order from the cooks what you want. The cook we spoke with spoke very little English but after a few finger pointing we were good to go. We got 4  chickenbreast combos which came with half a roasted chickenbreast a small salad and a ridiculous amount of fries. I have two teanagers. That was a hit with them. You are asked if you want spicy or regular sauce poured on top. I went for spicy and it was awesome! Not too hot for you novices out there. You move to the right to pay but they should move the cash register to the right of the pastries!  There were some incredible looking deserts that I would have gladly inquired about had my wife not already paid for our meal!

I remember that first time when I had walked through your doors and headed straight to that line formed outside the food-serving window.

I would be mighty upset too if I had missed out on the heavenly chicken that you cook. I remember, that greasy-and-delicious-barbeque-chicken smell coming out of that window was INTENSE. It was a hurried experience. The sweet young lady standing on the other side of the counter shouted ""PIQUANTE?"" when I ordered the chicken and I wasnt sure what was happening, but 'piquante' is always a safe bet for me so I said ""YES"" and bam! She had the chicken legs in a little container, grabbed her brush and basted that piece of chicken with this greasy delicious-looking sauce before handing me the container and shouting ""NO MORE CHICKEN SORRY!""I felt like a little kid who had just gotten the last ice-cream from the ice-cream man. I hurried off home clutching the precious container in my hand. As soon as I got home, I opened the container, took in the aroma wafting from the chicken, and dug in. I took the first bite, then the second, then the third... and I knew. You were irreplaceable. I would search far and wide, but nothing would ever compare. Its true, Romados.

And, the international language happens to be english. I wish I could say I was the only one it happened to. It happened to another person as I was paying. Any who.

So simple and so unique.Rotisserie Romados will surprise you. Make sure you get the chicken. A ""1/2"" will surely fit two starving stomachs and get a good load of spicy sauce. You may ask for breasts or thighs. And by the way, yelpers perhaps do not highlight it enough but the fries are excellent: crunchy and tasting like potatoes. Drinks wise, I recommend the imported Guarana soda and the Portuguese bottled orange soda. But Romados is also a pastry and will serve you creamy egg-tart and cappuccinos (or might be as well-off going to Neve right in front of it).  Furthermore, given quality and quantity, prices are unbeatable. 1/2 Chicken + 2 sodas + Dessert = $15.

They also have ribs and other tasty specialties but the chicken is always a winner.  If you're in a rush, you'll want to call and place your order ahead of time.

But honestly you can't see what's underneath the giant pile of fries!The chicken had a lovely taste to it. The spicy sauce wasn't as spicy as I'd like it to be.

But the breast was a little dry.  Also wasn't a fan of the fact that the spicy chicken is a regular chicken with chili oil added after the fact.  Portugalia (down the street at the intersection of Rachel and Clark) puts the chili oil, etc. on while they grill the chicken.  Fries are ok, but both the chicken and the fries seemed to be much better with the added chili oil.Bread was great and $10 for 1/2 a chicken, salad, and a ton of fries was more than enough for 2 people.  Food was extremely quick, despite other reviews that had a long wait.Not much place to sit and eat, and no drinking alcohol in the restaurant.All in all, a fantastic place to grab great Portuguese chicken and fries (maybe some beer) to take home.  But if you want equal quality chicken with crispier fries and the ability to sit and enjoy the food with a beer and a few olives, give Portugalia a try, you won't be disappointed."

My friends dragged me to Romados on a whim, because the day was so beautiful. I wasn't familiar with the place before, and neither was I familiar with Portuguese cuisine, so I didn't know what to expect. I thought this would be a full-blown restaurant with all sorts of Portuguese specialties. This is more a hole-in-the-wall sorta place: you order at one small counter after waiting in line, and choose from maybe 6 different meal options written above the counter. The Menu is fairly small and as the ""Rotisserie"" part of the name would suggest, consists mainly of chicken. I usually don't go out to eat chicken and ordered a pork escalope sandwich and a custard bun. Judging from all the reviews before me, I guess this is where I made a faux-pas. The sandwich was good. No more, no less. The bread was fluffy and bland, the escalopes a bit overcooked, what really bound everything together was the fat. Full-on fat, everywhere. The fries certainly benefit from all that fatty goodness and the next time I stop at Romados I'll gladly order a side of fries: they are well-seasoned and delicious and I promptly finished my friend's portion. The pastry stand is gorgeous to look at but nothing is named, and I always feel a fool trying to describe what I want. What is Portuguese? What isn't? I'm looking for something authentic here! My custard bun was good as well, with a hint of artificial processing in the custard's taste.  The prices are so low I'll probably be back a couple more times and see what exactly it is I seem to be missing out on."

Beyond its ridiculously tasty chicken, Ramado's is also a full fledged Portuguese bakery which offers some of the finest custard tarts in the city and really nice Portuguese buns which they will include as a compliment to the chicken meal if you ask nicely. Make sure to lather that chicken and fries in their delicious homemade rotisserie sauce because it is such a flavourful addition to an already superb meal. You won't find better value anywhere else in Montreal and dare I say, in the entire country for the simple reason that no other restaurant could survive offering such incredible value.

/user_details?userid=Nc7ZdIWbWNrvozcNllLpbQ,Ari S.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"This place totally rocks!  I got the 1/4 thigh combo, which was a huge portion of chicken, a salad, and an enormous amount of seasoned fries.  They pile on the fries OVER the chicken and salad-- the amount of fries is that much.  It also comes with a bread roll, which is very good-- soft and chewy on the inside, and goes great with the chicken.  As for the chicken itself, it was incredible.  Perfectly seasoned and crispy on the outside, and tender and juicy on the inside.  SO good.  PLUS, it's a really good deal.  You get ALL of that food for $5.99 CAD!I also got an egg tart, which is somewhat similar to the Chinese egg tarts.  Compared to the Chinese egg tarts, the filling in the Portuguese style is more creamy and sweet, rather than solid and gelatinous.Highly recommend this place and will be craving to go back."

Get the spicy sauce- it's not super spicy but it's very flavorful. Oh, and grab an egg tart for dessert.You must try it!"

Anyone raving about the chicken at this place has never eaten chicken that hasn't been pumped with hormones and god knows what else. There is a distinct difference between this and organic farm raised chicken. Yes, you get what you pay for but after trying it a number of times and being consistently disappointed about the taste and texture, my friends and I have vowed never to go back. I guess they are able to offer the prices they do due to the sheer volume of mass produced chickens they sell. If only they used a higher quality product...and were still able to maintain the necessary supply and prices. Then again, finding unadulterated food these days is becoming harder and harder and more and more expensive. Enjoy the assembly line chicken."

The chicken meal was huge and I definitely couldn't finish all of the food I had ordered with the half chicken meal. The chicken itself was delicious, particularly the skin and the sauce that came with it. The chicken didn't ruin chicken for me, as there were some pieces that were far less moist than others, but overall, it was a delicious piece of chicken, perfectly complimented by the soft but flavorful french fries."

So...  get two chickens for a party of 6-8 and then ask for the smallest side of salad and the smallest side of potatoes and that will be more than enough for all your party..."

This is by far the best barbecued chicken place in Montreal. Saint-Hubert, Scores and other are great places for chicken but Romados takes it to a new level. If you can call before you arrive you will avoid the lineup and will get your chicken faster. The sizes of the portions are unreal and the complementary ""pastel de nata"" (Portuguese custard pie) and small bun make this meal a true Portuguese experience. I keep returning to Romados as the service is also amazing. A little trick: while they are serving you at the counter make sure you place heavy coins on the wooden tip box and your portion may even increase (ehehe) If you buy portions for parties don't be surprised if you pay for 6 chicken and they give you seven. Romados is the best charcoal Barbecue Chicken in Quebec!"

/user_details?userid=nErrKrmvVWDDuisJKvLXSA,obscure b.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Pros:Excellent chicken and fries, warm and friendly smiles.Very good prices.Best chicken and fries I ever tasted. Every time I visit montreal I have to drop by. I tried almost all the other chicken places in montreal and none are even close. That includes cote st luc and chalet BBQs chicken.Get the spicy sauce  and  the fries. They are a must.If you are visiting montreal I suggest you try this place once. It is up there with schwartz and fairmount bagels.Cons:A taaad bit unhealthy, lol. But hey.. who can resist the fries and spicy sauce?Sweets and pastries are not that good. Would concentrate on fattening one's self through the fries and chicken.Didn't like the chicken sandwiches. Just some slices of chicken stuffed unceremoniously into some average bread.Waiting times can be long. Order via phone and arrange for a pick up at a convenient time. Otherwise expect up to 45 minutes waiting time.Small seating area. Better to do take out and gorge and wallow in shame in privacy.Alternatives and Suggestions:No alternatives in this life time.Learn how to say: 'Please!  For the love of god! No more fries!' in french before ordering from the nice old lady. Trust me..For dessert, walk south on st-laurent and you will find ripples ice cream. Also, further south on st-laurent is juliette chocolate for some good coffee and dessert."
/user_details?userid=aHTIpUytYGf7d6xhDBX-eQ,Zackary V.,"Kirkland, Canada",5 star rating,"$11 or $12 gets your SO MUCH food. I always get half fries and half rice and they basically give what any other place would consider a full portion of each. Then you have a roll, some salad, and of course their delicious chicken. This is chicken exactly the way you want it prepared. It's juicy and well seasoned. The only thing that I would have preferred would have been a more salad. The give so many fries and very little salad. I guess I'll have to try and ask for that one of these days when the place isn't so busy (which is extremely rare)."

/user_details?userid=SUMGKjiTdVEy4HpCw-9uwQ,David H.,"Berkeley, CA",5 star rating,"This place is amazing, I used to go all the time during my days at McGill. The must have menu item is of course the rotisserie chicken (actually grilled over charcoal) doesn't get any better than this, best I've had or probably will have. Comes in many forms, if its only one or two of you go for the plates (quarter chicken, breast or leg, or half chicken, mountain of fries and small salad, rices occasionally available.) Chicken is perfectly cooked, nice and juicy and well seasoned. You have a choice of spicy sauce or mild, word to the wise, go with the spicy (it's not spicy at all actually). Fries are pretty good. Prices are even better. When I started going there it was $4.75 for a quarter chicken plate (enough food to feed a small family). Prices have gone up recently but still absurdly cheap.You should also know that chicken isn't the only thing Romados makes. It's also a bakery! I recommend the rice flour cupcakes/muffins. Awesome, nice and dense but with a fluffy texture.Highly, highly recommended to the Montréal native or visitor."
/user_details?userid=42If7J8Dk7FNL8nWOCibmQ,M B.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"There are two types of people in the world. Those of adventurous and unpretentious character who enthusiastically get their coat and shoes when a visit to Romados is suggested, and those difficult prissy ones who go along listlessly and reluctantly but secretly find the resto's downmarket appearance, long queue, and lady who barks brusquely at you whilst still referring to you in terms of endearment alarming.These are also the ones who will queasily whinge at the carbohydrate content, exuberantly massive portions of chicken painted with the deliciously lurid oily piri-piri sauce (only if one specifies- you can have your chicken piquant ou pas piquant), chips/fries, rice, salad, lovely little bread roll (and sometimes if one gets there before 2pm, a small custard pie). These latter people are drags, and I hope if you know any you cut them out of your life. They are no fun unless they are in circumstances that allow them to pretend they are in a dull television series about lawyers or vacuous trophy wives. If you must keep them because they are related to you or they owe you favours, don't take them to Romados. But if you are perhaps dating a manic-pixie-dream-girl of some sort for example, she will be delighted by all of the aforementioned as well as the enormous case of colourful and wonderful pastries you are pressed against as you pass ever so slowly through the queue to order. To pass the time, you can imagine which gorgeous little cake or tart you'd choose if you weren't about to have an enormous meal (which, really, anyone sensible stretches it to two or three meals), you can wonder how long these pastries have been sitting there, feel a bit less desire for them, feel a bit melancholy and hope they are being given to the poor, or perhaps wonder how thorough their dumpster protection might be. The half-chicken is the best deal. 2 or 3 sittings out of it for a mere 7.99, and far better than any chicken in the city. Occasionally, the rice is left off, or the bread is different (and occasionally disappointing)  but it's all part of the magic. There are drinkies of all types in the fridge case and if you are feeling particularly adventurous try the sumol.One can eat inside amid all the bustling, at small tables covered charmingly in brown butcher paper, changed after each patron's grease smeared mark is left, and once (fairly long ago) we had the unfortunate and insalubrious experience of seeing a yuppie customer with obvious entitlement issues as well as a complete ignorance of hygiene change her not very small infant's soiled nappie on the lunch counter next to the door. It was barely noticed except by our party and the poor gobsmacked bastard who had been minding his own business next to the ridiculous cow.In good weather it's much nicer to carry your meal and walk across the street or down the road to a nice park for a picnic.Romados always gives me a much happier experience than nearly any upscale restaurant in Montreal. For all the dubious princesses who are put off by the sort of food that looks as if it might make you fatter, there's no need to gorge oneself there. I eat there once a week and have never gained weight from it."

/user_details?userid=NtWoJ66Qv83k_7-_ciI6TQ,Heather W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,oh Romados how we miss thee (since moving from the plateau) let me count the ways....1. The barbecued chicken... with crispy carmelized bits that are full of flavour2. The Portuguese spices on the chicken3. The spiced hot fries4. The yummy spicy sauce they will drizzle on the fries and the chicken if you want... your choice spicy or really spicy...5. Large portions for the price6. Yummy bread - soft and lovely on the inside... crunchy and firm on the outside7. NATAS NATAS NATAS (need I say more? Probably not but I will anyways... if you love custard you need to have one of these... two... or 10.... if they let you pick go for the ones with lots of colour... the carmelization thing again....)8. Salads are fresh but because they are in with the hot stuff they get soggy really quick... so I don't miss those that much... 9. I would say I miss the rice if we ever got to eat it (the one time I did have it it was yummy)... but this place is always so busy that they run out of it early and I have rarely had it.... go earlier if you want it.10. NATAS NATAS NATAS... (and try the white bean tarts as well for an unexpected surprise... who thought beans would make a tasty dessert? )Well worth the wait in line... but if you want to avoid waiting at peak hours... phone your order in and pick up a half hour later.... the pre-order line is always way shorter. Be sure you do so before their 6 or 6:30 deadline... otherwise be prepared to be patient. If the line stretches to the door... plan to wait at least 45 minutes... but it will be worth it...Also note that they do have a few tables but often no room... more of a take out place at rush hour.... there are a few parks nearby - one in between de bouillion and hotel de ville streets about 1/4 of the way down and of course only a few blocks from mount royal park.... just remember to clean up after yourselves and use the garbages
