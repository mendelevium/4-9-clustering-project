Friendly and efficient staff, great selections of beers, ciders, and cocktails. The food is snack/share style. LOVED the duck tartare. This is the kind of place you'll definitely love eating oysters at, not just because oysters are delicious, but because the Parisian atmosphere lends a lot to the experience. It has that very St. Laurent vibe of marrying vintage and contemporary elements, and the warm lighting gives me fuzzy feelings and fond memories. Also, not super expensive, so if you feel like taking a break from cheaper eats and dep wine come to this place for an upgrade."
/user_details?userid=jqqB8hWF8kIrv2-qWt23xg,Kristen L.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"If you're in Montreal and want to have an exceptional meal that isn't poutine, I would highly recommend Le Majestique. It is a very unpretentious spot, vaguely resembling a diner meets dive bar but the food is anything but plain.The smoked mackerel spread is creamy, soft, and flavorful. The duck tartare is incredibly delicious, paired nicely with daikon and cucumber. Both are appetizers but were hearty openers and come with a side of bagel chips.The shining star was the 12 inch hot dog, which is garnished with all manner of deliciousness: apple, red cabbage, other crispy vegetables. The hotdog itself was tender and savory, and it was perfect to split between two people.Topped the meal off with the Rice Krispies treats soaked in a Bailey's syrup. So good, I will be dreaming about this meal for ages."

Sure, we knew the drinks would be stellar (it just LOOKS like the kind of place where good drinks are made), but the food impressed us too! Great oysters, and that hot dog... worth getting."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",3 star rating,"I am so back and forth on this bar! I love the look of it, I love weird toys and collectibles and the pretty lights and the tiny lovely cosy space. When I popped in recently with a group of 8, just to see if they might have time for us to grab a round of oysters and drinks before dinner, they squeezed us in and it was super helpful and fun. The oysters were fresh and delicious, and there were a couple near-beer options for the preggos, and tasty glasses of bubbly and wine for the others. Small bémol: The people in our group who were excited to order local beers were disappointed to find they were served warm, and there were astonished laughs at the table over the 20$ hot dog. Fair enough. I definitely still dig this bar and have had some great times here, I just wish the menu were more appealing and filling, and things in general just a little more consistent. I think I'd be there way more often."

Food was food. Oysters and snails were my highlight. duck tartare was okay .. perhaps the snails stole its thunder. Will return
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We were headed to another place to eat but it was closed but we were so hungry and Majestique was right nearby so why not!  We told the waitress, don't talk about drinks--gimme food!!! And food they delivered! I wasn't sure if it was a good idea to eat at a place that focused mainly on drinks but here we go...We started with the oysters 3 different types. My favorite was the Cheebooktoosk oysters from New Brunswick. Light, crisp and sweet tasting! Next was the salmon confit, it was lightly seared on the outside and raw on the inside. The crunchy pistachios, candy beets and endives worked in harmony together. The salmon was perfect.The roasted cauliflower plate had new unique flavors I had never tasted before! Definitely worth a try. The texture of everything was really interesting. Then crispy pork belly on a bed of parsnip puree...sooooo good. They make brussel sprouts sexy.Deer tartar was a bit tendony even though it was cut in small pieces but fun to try if you're into tartar :) the uber long bread sticks aren't strong enough to dig the tartar, it's easier to spoon it up.All these plates were delightful but THE dish of the night was the buttered Welks with bread. If you thought escargot was special, it's cause you haven't tried this dish yet! The bonito flakes topping gave it a nice smokey flavor, complemented with lime juice and baked in herbed butter--then soak all that goodness up with some soft bread and.... I think I just died and gone to heaven!!!  Service was great up until the end when it got really crowded. We had to flag a waiter's attention in order to pay but we were done anyway so it didn't matter. Who cares if this place is a bar--I'm here for the good food!"

The oysters (and espresso martini) were fantastic but it was the ambiance and service that blew us away. In particular, Dillon and Kevin were wonderful, made sure we felt welcomed, and gave excellent recommendations for nearby spots to try. Highly recommend!!!"

Lovely service from our waiter Dylan & manager Kevin. They coached us on our French & made superb recommendations for other places to try in the city. Definitely worth a visit."

We weren't disappointed at all. Great food, great service, great ambience, great bar for late night food! Can't recommend more."
/user_details?userid=5DLeXZ3ghivbgacb7OVW2g,April K.,"Newton, MA",2 star rating,Not a huge fan.... not sure why that hot dog was $22. It was just a thin long average hot dog with shredded cabbage on top and very difficult to eat. The pork belly dish was dry. Duck tartare was very small portioned and dry. The whelks were good though. Overall spent almost $100 on a below average meal.
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"If you're looking for a cool place to have oysters and bubbly, look no more. Le Majestique has everything you need - great service, delicious oysters, good selection of drinks to choose from and relaxing atmosphere. It's a perfect place to have to meet up with friends, that special date or afterwork drinks with colleagues. Definitely a must to visit in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=23y0Nv9FFWn_3UWudpnFMA,Graham R.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my favourite places that we went to in Montreal. Majestique is essentially an old diner that has been converted into a trendy snack bar with delicious food and drinks.After slamming back cocktails at Big in Japan a few doors up the street we decided it was time to eat. We tried the pate and the whelks because frankly I've never heard of a whelk and love to try new things. Neither disappointed. The pate was incredible and the whelks were fantastic also.Unbeknownst to me my wife arranged with our server to bring over a dessert with a sparkler at midnight as it was my birthday. Service here was fantastic.They also have a really great craft beer list. I can't remember exactly which one but one of the craft beers which our server said was an APA was incredible and I wanted to go back just to get another one of those beers while we were in Montreal.All in all if you are looking for some small plates to share and drinks with friends, this is the place!"
/user_details?userid=pQ02Y1VCqcV7vZV_id2VsA,Sophie L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The ambiance of this restaurant is sooo cute. Very montreal-like and perfect for a date night!I had the duck tartare (super good), the bacon (incredible but a pretty small portion- i was still hungry after the two) and my boyfriend had the 22$ hot dog. It does seem like a lot of $ for a hot dog but OMG! It was so big and sooooo good!! I would go back just for that hot dog.Overall, highly recommend, and their patio is super cute too :)"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Decided to come here with a group of friends after seeing the popularity and the good reviews of this place. The place has a nice ambiance: feels canadian, not too noisy, good lighting. Our waiter was very friendly and nice and made good recommendations about their specials. We tried the duck tartare, the cold scallop soup, the veggies, some oysters and the salmon. The oysters were about 2-3$ each (one of them was cheaper because it was happy hour) and were very sweet and delicious. The other food were also pretty good. The portions are a bit small so in order to be full, you would have to take many plates as well as fries to fill up your stomach. I didn't really want the fries, so I left the place with a stomach half-full. Overall, it's a nice place with good food. If you do go, do take something filling, otherwise you would end up going to another restaurant after like me."
/user_details?userid=16XDM4M2G8NvLVLLOhM1nA,Sandrine L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Awesome and unique spot. Food is delicious, never disappointed. Ok the hot dog is a bit pricey but hey, you'll pay the same price at the Bell Center and it will never be as close to the hot dog at Majestique. It's a must. The new Tequilana drink is really dangerous, it's my favorite. Even if like me you are not a fan of tequila, the Smoke Show sauce is just brilliant in this, you will completely forget about the tequila (and be tipsy sonner than you think). I like that they have in season ingredients like asparagus and beautiful tender lobster to die for when I went for the last time on Monday. Nice food and nice drinks. Staff could be more attentive. They could also have have comfy bar stools and it would be perfect."
/user_details?userid=6S4mFABPjK488ozYnGGZvQ,Alice W.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,Great place to hang out for drinks and dinner. The drinks were excellent and I ordered the raw oysters and the Canadian version of gourmet hot dog. It was very good. Great atmosphere and friendly staff.

/user_details?userid=3ZrY316WfsTrFKbUCc9waw,Diane M.,"Rotterdam, NY",3 star rating,I had this on my list places to check out.  We found ourselves in town and was able to secure a table for five. We were still within the happy hour special for the oysters two dollars. I did see in the reviews about a complaint with small portions that's So accurate. The price was high for what you got.  My husband went with the special Venison dish. I would say where's the beef but it's venison it was small. So small I felt bad asking him if I could taste it. I went with the foot-long hotdog so did my daughter and two others.   I don't know I don't get it.  The hotdogs were $22 each didn't even come with french fries still trying to figure out how they came up with $22 for this hotdog. It was very awkward to eat. My personal opinion if I was spending $22 on a hotdog man I would like that dog to stand out instead of the cabbage apple slaw mix that they had on top of it.  That's just my opinion.  The bill came to $166 for the five of us. I know we left thinking where we really going for dinner.

It's very cosy and quiet.The inside's atmosphere is pleasant. They have small tables and the bar is where I sat down to take my order. Service wise: Top notch!!! They are so friendly and accommodating!the bartender is pretty awesome. He wips up any kind of drink you want! He was so enthusiastic and even joked with us!!The food: Above average but does not have a lot of variety which I was a little bit disappointed. However, they have amazing oysters on the menu and really delicious quality tasting food ! The also disappointing factor is the portion sizes. I found the portions were very little for the price you pay. Overall, the service was beyond tremendous and that is the one reason I rated high 4star but the food has to be improved! Delicious but lacks a selection in variety and portion size. I would definitely recommend this place as they are open very late and it's awesome how their kitchen is open very late! I recommend this place very much"

The house sauces are mediocre so everything really does depend on oyster quality.Actually, not everything.It's an oyster bar - and that means bar.They pour a lot of really really good gins.This way you can drink away your sorrows if you don't like your oysters"
/user_details?userid=zlBdFXvn44TIDCqmxbIETg,Ariane L.,"Cambridge, MA",5 star rating,Yesterday my friend and I were on the terrace at Majestique enjoying some oysters when a homeless man came up to the waiter to ask for a glass of water. I was expecting the waiter to turn him around real quick but was delighted to see that the man was served a glass of water like any other customer. Thank you for treating humans beings with the dignity they deserve.PS: Been to this place many times and the food is always delightful. So is the decor! I'm from Montreal and always take friends from out of town to this place.
/user_details?userid=jN1NaVL9EKL1khaT6Urv_A,Matt J.,"Wilmington, DE",5 star rating,"Lovely service.  I had Eastern Canadian oysters, which were served with two mignonettes and two local hot sauces - fantastic.  Also had two tapas-style specials that were on the healthier side and delicious: a lobster bake with corn and a string bean and pea dish.  The beer selection was good and I was able to get one of the Canadian hot sauces served with the oysters at the store next door, thanks to our server, who directed me there to get it."
/user_details?userid=B41w9LUYQHbkTjFRfpHEjA,Vivian B.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,"We originally wanted to go to Schwartz because it was recommended by sooo many people.. didn't anticipate the line up to be ridiculously long. Couldn't wait anymore, I went on yelp to see what was the next best thing to eat was and Le Majestique was up next for Canadian food. Wasn't too far of a walk from Schwartz either. Upon arrival, there was a nice cozy hipster vibe to it. Lights inside were dimmed out and OFC always starting off I ask the waiter what is recommended here to eat. He suggested to try the 12"" hot dog as it was the most popular. 3/4 got that and 1/4 got the shrimp sandwich. He was right! It was so good but the price for it was kinda steep although the portion makes up for the price. Service was great. If I'm ever in the area again, I probably would come back for that!"

/user_details?userid=Gz786XMe_7pSuDAEW8Wr9w,Reubin D.,"Alexandria, VA",4 star rating,"One of several options on the main strip, but certainly a gem. They have small tables for an intimate evening but they can also be put together for large groups. The atmosphere is low key with a rustic-hipster vibe. The sangria options are super tasty and made to order. The food portions aren't quite American size but they are still plentiful. The brazed short rib practically melts in your mouth, but wasn't too filling. The shrimp rolls where sooo tasty, I could order them daily. It was served like a sandwich of seafood goodness! The service was really good too, everyone spoke both French and English and welcomed us."
/user_details?userid=rN4RItq4xONM-cjgSfbvDQ,Kendall S.,"Fort Worth, TX",5 star rating,"You know, this was probably our favorite find that we didn't plan on finding, which is typically the best kind. We'd been stumbling around, walking aimlessly, and enjoying this part of town for hours. We'd already made our way up and then back down Mount Royal, walked across campus, and found ourselves in need of sustenance. Not just a simple swig of water and a protein bar kind of sustenance, okay, I yearned for a real and cozy connection to the city in some way. A place to enter and feel welcomed with positivity, comfort, no rushing, and quality products. I needed a long break of casual leisure! What I'm trying to say is, I needed good food and drink in a cool spot.Le Majestique was perfection. The waiters and bartenders were so calm and cool. Even the random dude sitting in there working on his laptop while he drank an entire bottle of wine was the coolest. I just wanted to immediately be friends with all of these people and lounge over the craft cocktail menu, which had some beautiful, classic choices. A great wine list and even McKeown Cider, which I'd been looking for. Ciders aren't easy to come by in Montreal, but this biz felt like a very ""me"" place (and I betcha they give off that same familiar feeling to most of their patrons, which is why they're so great). You just kind of find parts of yourself in the restaurant. In the decor, in the menu, in the vibe. Somewhere. We ordered the fries of course, which were unapologetically, classic, big, fat, hot, greasy fries. Not bad greasy though, the good kind. Then we ordered the salmon dish.. A perfectly portioned beautiful filet that'd been smoked halfway through and then caramelized on top. Oh my god, the flavors and textures were brilliant. Best piece of fish I ate in all of Montreal. And they can easily accommodate for the gluten free without hesitation, an attitude, or lack in quality.We didn't stay in here for long, just sort of popped in for a sunset rest before we headed out to prepare for dinner. But when in Montreal again, I know now to seek out Le Majestique and take better advantage of its killer space, unique menu, and stellar drink options. Plus, brunch?! It's just the greatest restaurant, you have to get in there, relax, and see what you can find."

/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"So Majestique is a beautiful bar/restaurant. The food is good and the oysters are fresh. Here's my problem. It's expensive and somewhat quite pretentious (i find). Yes, ok, the 12-inches hot dog is good. But is not because there's some fancy fried shallots and other fixings on top that it's worth 22$. We had a hard time in the beginning to get service due to the fact that the staff was busy greeting their friends and the regulars. The service needs to be improved because we felt that some waitress (there was only one that night) didn't really care about the patrons. The food portions are on the small size scale. Don't expect to be full unless you're ready to dish out serious money. We ended up going to Chinatown. No reservations are accepted so first come, first served. I don't thinks i'll be coming back here."

We opted to sit at the bar, which was the best idea - we enjoy interacting with the bartender and you can really learn about a place and the food that way.First off, the cocktails are very good. You can tell that the bartenders really care about their creations, and their old fashioned was one of the best I ever had. They use cheesecloth to skim the contents, so the drink is very light.The food is also a particular stand out. We opted for the Asian slaw, which, although it was a good portion, we almost want to order a second one because it was so good. They're also known for their hot dog, which ultimately my partner liked more than I did. Those were the two stand-outs.Overall, we had a great meal at Le Majestique, and I would definitely recommend it to people who are visiting. Very intimate and romantic vibe, though the restaurant turns into a busy bar/club scene eventually."
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I could name similarly nostalgic-better-dinning-type places in the city who all try to take a stab at what Majestique gracefully accomplishes, but they're not worth my time. Firstly, the oysters were divine and hella cheap during happy hour. The beer/booze list is absolutely spot-on and the service was great. What more does a Montréalaise need??While I loved our dishes (also all very reasonably priced!) it was pretty tough for me to get a feel of what the portion sizes were while we ordered- and they ended up ranging from cocktail snack-sized to meal-sized. Long story short, we got a second dinner afterwards. I plan to go back to Majestique- but definitely for more just happy hour fare.Word to the wise- arrive early in the evening, the place fills fast!"

/user_details?userid=A7YlcidsiAZzU-tCSsrTSg,Anny T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is one of my favorite hidden gems! Located right on the Main, this place has a really intimate and fun vibe. The ambiance and decor is fits perfectly for anyone looking for a night out in a lively atmosphere. I was initially a bit hesitant because it was a bar (not exactly the place for amazing cusines, let's be honest), but all doubt was cast aside as soon as we tried their food.Good: Have you ever looked at a menu and can't decide on what to order because all the description sound incredibly creative and delicious? The waiter recommended a specialty scallops, and we decided to try it. A bit pricey for $14 for 4 small pieces, but it was really good though! If you come here for dinner, expect to order tapas style. I had the salad and I didn't I would love toasted chickpeas as much as I did. The presentations look really fancy, without the $30/dish price tag. I only wished the portions were a bit bigger though. Bad: This place is not for first dates, it's loud in here!Bottom line: If you don't feel like dressing up to eat fancy, this is the spot for you! I will definitely be back here again for their amazing food!"
/user_details?userid=933NaWG9W6Z-1pXMFPKOoQ,Mimi J.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here with two girlfriends for dinner as their menu looked promising and reviews stated they were a hidden gem! My advice: get their escargot. I would of eaten JUST the escargot, it was THAT good! The food is pricy for the portions, but they have some really good dishes. Special of the day - in season fiddleheads with pork cheek: you can really taste that the fiddleheads are in season; they were tender and fresh. The pork cheek was cut in cubes and was crunchy, but really savoury. Whatever the sauce was made out of was amazing, and we asked for more bread to mop the sauce up with! Escargot with ciabatta bread: MY FAVOURITE of everything. The buttery sauce was super addicting and mopping it up with the bread was perfect. I wanted to leave no bits of sauce/garlic behind! Delicious and worth the $14. Salmon tartar: This came with long thin breadsticks which worked well (I don't prefer the usual super crunchy toasts that accompany tartare). The salmon tartare itself was fresh and there was a good balance of salty and tangy. I enjoyed it (it would be my second favourite dish) but it was pretty small. Hotdog ($22!): This came at the end of our meal, and we had to wait for it. The price was what really intrigued us. The server cut it into 3 for us which was nice. The top has a ton of fried onions, and you are supposed to smash/squish it down with a fork before eating (otherwise it will be really messy). The blend of flavours and sauces was yummy, but the dog could have been bigger, and there could have been more toppings. The bun was nicely toasted and the whole thing came fresh and hot so it was delicious, but WAY too pricey. Half price would have been more reasonable! Service was prompt, and the server translated the entire 1 page menu for us to English (it's a small menu, but I guess they put effort into each different dish). The inside is really cozy and dimply lit but warm. The women's washroom was hilarious; the soap is attached to the wall and it's a phallic shape so you have to rub your hands up and down it...LOL!"
/user_details?userid=xM11eZw5O3xHCcJOy0XoUw,Wess C.,"Etobicoke, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,Good food with fairly priced menu with the exception of hot dog($22). We ordered the following: Sex on the bay oysters - $2 each before 7pm. They were fresh but some of them were pretty small. We ordered sex on the bay because of the $2 special. In hindsight it might have been better to get other oysters instead considering how small sex on the bay oysters were. Whelks - decent - will order againBraised pork belly - soooo yummy!!! Must try!!Hot dog - tastes good but would not order again as it essentially is just a long hot dog with some salad tossed on top - not worth $22

We had a full view of the bar action and we were treated amazingly by the staff/ barman. Very pleasant, we chatted throughout the nite, politely answering my GF's questions about the menu and suggested ""specialities"" which were not on the menu.  Of course, we obliged ...and we did not regret it.After various cocktails and beer ; Martini Majestique, Quebec 22, Beer La Pitoune, we had the Snow Crab (very well detailed, presented and opened); Guedille de crevettes (a must) and fries (delish). All very good, especially the snow crab (how come snow crab tastes differently from Some places -vs- others...what gives???)Thank you Le Majestique. We had an amazing night."

It's nice that the servings are more snack-sized so that you can try a few different options. I would give it a 5 but the cost is just a bit over what I think the food is actually worth (maybe around 20-25% overvalued). I would also have liked more options for beers on tap (lots of bottled options though). Either of these would push this place to 5 stars. Definitely would come back! In the end, we went to our local drinking hole (Reservoir) just around the corner for a few more drinks after dinner."

/user_details?userid=2XDTpvVKW2aJwlyyNWwGsg,Christina M.,"Asheville, NC",5 star rating,"We stumbled into this place after passing it one night and thinking the atmosphere looked inviting.  I looked it up on Yelp and, lo and behold, people actually like the food.  Score!I really had no expectations going in and was pleasantly surprised by everything we ordered.  I enjoyed a nicely chilled, inexpensive rosé, and my hubby had a cocktail with gin, Dolin blanc, and Cointreau in one of those tiny cocktail coupes.  So far, so good.Food-wise, we went with two specials and one salad from the menu.  The format is small plates, so either don't come famished or plan to grab poutine afterwards, as we did.  From the regular menu we had the tomato-strawberry salad with basil aioli.  This was just delightful with ripe, juicy fruits and vegetables, crispy croutons, and a flavorful, light dressing.  The corn and wild mushroom special was our favorite of the night -- I was stunned by how much flavor they coaxed out of simple vegetables, perfectly cooked and dressed with nutty brown butter and herbs. FANTASTIC.  The other special was sauteed turbot with tomatoes, crispy bread crumbs, and (I think) white asparagus.  The fish medallions were tender, nicely browned, and perfectly balanced by the fresh vegetables, crunchy, buttery bread crumbs, and creamy sauce.  Highly recommend if you see this on the daily menu.Service was good, and quite friendly, although we did have to ask for share plates and more napkins.  I was bummed they were out of two white wines I asked about, but oh well.  The bill can add up quickly here if you're not careful (especially if you're very hungry), but the fact is, this was our most delicious meal in Montreal.  I'd highly recommend stopping in!"

/user_details?userid=zTHK_nlgh8Bz_AXPksPKng,Will R.,"Minneapolis, MN",1 star rating,"Our one and only disappointment during my family's Montreal vacation du gastronomique. I had read and heard a lot of amazing things about Le Majestique. So, our expectations were high coming here....... but sadly we didn't even get to eat.    We came on the early side shortly after the restaurant opened (5pm). There were plenty of empty seats. The maitre'd looked us up and down and said ""We have no seats available unless you have a reservation"" On Yelp and on their Facebook page it clearly states ""No Reservations"" Perplexed, my brother asked when is the next reservation? The man replied probably after 8pm. My brother then said may we make a reservation? The man replied, ""I am not in charge of the reservations, only the front of the house and immediate seating, you'll need to call our telephone to make a reservation"". We step outside, my brother calls and the person who answers says ""Sir, we do not take reservations, but if you come to the restaurant we have plenty of seating available right now and we probably won't fill up until around 8pm"" Now we weren't perplexed, we were all downright pissed off. My brother goes back inside and confronts the Maitre'D. He mumbles something, goes in the back and out comes the gentleman that my brother spoke to on the phone. He apologizes for the whole situation and immediately seats us. We thought, ""ok, we have a seat and things are fine"". Well, we were wrong. A server comes over and slams 3 waters down on the table and walks away without a word. Another server comes over and more or less says ""what'll be?"" We had just been given menus only seconds before. My brother says ""We are leaving"". We did just that.      This was our only pretentious experience in Montreal. This is clearly a place to be seen as much a place to eat. I understand that many places want to curate a ""look"" inside their restaurants. But, my crux with this is that while my Mother and I might have looked like peasants compared to the rest of the patrons, my brother didn't. He works for Chanel, and he was dressed to the nines. He certainly could hold his own anywhere when it comes to looking fashionable, so why the snub Le Majestique?   I think the fact that I had to write out this explanation of our experience clearly shows that this establishment is more about style than say substance, food, or experience. There are so many welcoming and inclusive places in Montreal, I suggest you avoid Le Majestique and find some of those."

Best accident that ever took place! How often do you get to say that in your life! Yes, decor is fun and keeps your eyes discovering more. Yes, the booze menu has enough for you to never get bored. Yes, it's got a bar vibe but never feeling over crowded - even when the place is full. (We were sitting next to a table of booze guzzling 8- and couldn't even tell). I bet you didn't know that you can email for a reservation. I reserved a table for two for a Friday night via email and got accommodated. I was greeted by a gentleman at the door. Who (you can tell was handling many things in his head) but gave me undivided attention. Seated my promptly. So yes, welcoming, attentive and youthful staff. Just enough to make sure you have what you want and leave you alone at the same time. Best part is the menu. Let me make this easy for you - Get the plates that have the following:- Blue cheese- snail- bacon - mushrooms. Their menu isn't always exactly the same. The blue cheese: stinky and spicy on a warmed lettuce head, mixed with roasted nuts. The mushroom was a special. These people know how to cook mushrooms! In whatever dish, they get it right! The snails: (Bourgots, beurre D'algues, pain frits) is so buttery and delicious - hidden under these crips/salted yum bites. [FYI: They use to leave them whole but now they cut them in half.. I prefer the whole). The bacon: thick chucks, crips on the outside, mixed with some veggies on these puree bed of love. I consider it the best plate in the house (next to the octopus). And, my date can't stop thinking of the bacon. You see eyes just light up when the person eating the bacon takes that first bite. It's really a surprise delight. They have this special sea food platter plate. I am heading back for that and will keep you posted. There you have it. Go on now - get! Grab a friend and go treat yourself with a drink and a bite, or two or three - seriously the bacon!"

From their fresh oysters with interesting accompaniments, to the 12"" hotdog, you're on a roller coaster ride of a menu of things you shouldn't be putting together, but you do, and together it sings. For me personally, it allowed me to break some traditional rules in a fun and imaginative manner.From a service perspective, it's professional yet casual. From a price point perspective, it's high value for what you're getting.

Good cocktails and a nice wide range of local beer and (impressively) cider. I would say the food menu ventures more towards seafood but there's a wide range of dishes. I had the salmon tartare and it was amazing, although (like at Darling), the portions are pretty small. There's also that same time of amber colored lighting which makes it perfect for a date. My only complaint is that it can get quite crowded which means you might find yourself yelling over the table at the person you came with."

Looked packed from the outside but there were actually plenty of tables available. Walking through the place, you are immediately struck by the charming vintage decor. The kind server led us to our seat and we scoped the menu. Expansive drink options, maybe 7-10 food items. Asides from the fries and the oysters, not your typical menu by far. We went with a mixed beer salad and the potato salad with braised pork belly, as well as the aforementioned oysters. The beet salad had cooked red and golden beets, some thinly sliced raw(?) beets, some kind of crispy chip things, yogurt and goat cheese. Like nothing I've had before, delicious. The potato salad had broccoli potatoes and onions in a mustardy kind of sauce (my partner hates mustard so this one ended up being all mine), and some braised (more like fried hard) pork belly. Also delicious, though I might've wanted more pork lol. The oysters were great, I'm pretty easy to please on that end. They did have a smoked hot sauce that was amazing. Couple Canadian clubs to round everything off, and we had a pretty nice little nightcap. Would definitely come back again."

It's all a blur, but the times I have reflected on the trip (like right now months later back in Texas on a Monday afternoon...), my thoughts keep coming back to Le Majestique. I think it was the ONLY restaurant that was completely unplanned. We walked down from Mount Royal through McGill and up Saint-Laurent, enjoying the walk (hike??) back to our hotel. Peering into Le Majestique, we decided to stop for a drink and ended up having the greatest siesta of the whole trip.I suppose quaint is the word to use. There's some really, really odd decor going on, but the service and atmosphere were very warm. After having a cocktail, we decided to stay a bit longer and ordered some delicious fries + dipping mayo. And then more drinks! There were plenty of other menu items that sounded great and looked amazing when nearby patrons had them delivered to their tables. If I ever make it back to Montreal, I'll definitely stop by here again if not only to try more of the menu but simply to enjoy the ambiance. It was a nice reminder that the best times in life are unplanned and without direction. When you sit down for food and drink without any other thoughts and watch life go on through the window, that's what it means to relax."

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Moving away from the Main as I have recently have led me to think about all the great restaurants up and down the Main that I have enjoyed over my 9 years a short walk away... The only disappointment to my new location is I now have to bike or drive to them all! Despite my best attempts, there were also a few spots that I never got to in my time so close by.. luckily a beautiful Sunday evening recently allowed me to cross another one off the list, Majestique.Located in an old Lester's deli, owned by the Holder brothers and with the menu designed by the former Chef-de-Cuisine at Toque, Charles-Antoine Crète, Majestique recently has an interesting pedigree within the Montreal restaurant scene. The vibe is very casual but the menu and cocktails speak to a certain level of refinement. Looking at the menu, it's an interesting mix of dishes but one that really doesn't fit any true designation. Given the beautiful day, we requested a table on their small terrasse but as there would be a slight wait, we started our evening inside in a room that is probably best described as hipster deli/chalet. The old deli is still clearly visible but just covered in an insane amount of knickknacks ranging from sports pinnies to bowling pins and coke bottles. The look is not from everyone but I really enjoyed it.As we waited for our table outside, I went with the SPF 45 cocktail - White Barbancourt rum, lime juice, kaffir lime syrup and dashfire chinese bitters. A surprisingly mild cocktail where the lime really comes through. A solid summer terrasse drink.Very shortly after, we sat down on the terrasse and ordered some oysters to start because my girlfriend had never had some raw before and because why not? Served with a classic mignonette and a very interesting apple cider mignonette, these oysters were beautiful and fresh. As always, more could have been ordered but with the rest of the food ordered, we held off to save some room.The first of our entrees came up next. First was the tostada topped with sushi rice, avocado and nori. What a lovely dish! The tostada in this case was using rice paper which had a light and fluffy texture. The combination of creamy avocado, sticky rice, the nori and a spicy mayo worked very nicely on top.The next dish was whelk served with herb butter and fried bread, so sea snails served like traditional snails but with a twist. The herb butter was a great discovery on my end - didn't overpower the natural fattiness of the whelk like traditional garlic butter but still brought a subtle adjustment to the flavour. The whelk has delicious and the fried bread added a bit of crunch to the combination.Then came the squid salad with cherry tomatoes, pancetta and fava beans. Such beautiful squid - so rich and tender. Paired simply with the fresh veggies and herbs, the squid is so good that frankly it could have been the only thing on the plate and I would still love the dish!A dish that definitely surprised was the burnt salmon confit served with an apple and almond salad. I really didn't know what to expect from salmon confit and the answer was a ridiculously soft texture. It may perhaps be seen as too soft, almost mushy to some people but we really dug it. The salad was very non-descript and honestly just felt like filler on the plate.We couldn't say no to a side-order of fries and those came through nicely as well. Good sized with a nice crunch and already salted, they paired very well with our final main dish - the foot-long Nordic shrimp roll. Best dish all night and it's not that close despite the positives I stated of the previous plates. Great flavourful shrimp filling in an insane toasted brioche-like hot dog bun. Best hot dog bum I've ever had without a shadow of a doubt. Knowing what this ended up being, I would have skipped one of the previous dishes to order another just for myself. So so good...For dessert, we had two options available to us - sucre à la creme and cheesecake with rhubarb. The sucre à la creme was small in portion but oh so good. Dangerous little sugar packages. The cheesecake was nice and creamy with a nice rhubarb jelly over top. Solid sweet options to end our meal.Majestique was quite a nice meal from beginning to end. Solid cocktails, great technique and execution throughout the meal. The overall menu left me somewhat baffled in terms of how one describes this place. Regardless, the quality of the food and the fact that the kitchen is open late nights makes this a great option for a late bite along the Main. Majestic is just another sign that the heart of the Main food wise continues to work its way northward and now I have another reason to re-visit my old neighbourhood.Cheers!"

/user_details?userid=ZPdRpKnZN9xTrjozt5Qckw,Hannah E.,"Gatineau, Canada",4 star rating,Great food! We tried almost everything on the menu and ordered wine and oysters. Everything was delicious. The price was a bit more than I usually spend considering each dish is just appetizer size but I definitely recommend it.
/user_details?userid=dmN6SfMI-pQyT-ouOmEkjQ,Noor M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Come here for oysters! Their salmon, deer, and tartare de canard was great too, we tried the squid as well but didn't enjoy it. Their portions are on the smaller side, otherwise service was great, the design of the place and its vibes are wonderful, its a cute little spot to check out in the plateau. *** they don't take reservations, but we came on a Sunday during their oyster happy hour (4-7pm) and were able to find seats."

The hotdog for two is always a must, and on a recent visit I had an outstanding quinoa salad with grapes, fresh herbs and hazelnuts---gotta love a place that takes some care with their salads and doesn't leave them as an after thought. The service is friendly and prompt. It's a bar-type atmosphere (i.e., pretty loud and pretty cramped), but people are having so much fun that you can't help but join in. A great place for after work drinks and dinner. (Please put that cream soda/tequila cocktail back on the menu!)"

It was just sitting there.- likewise... ignored for most of the night- when we left some of us decided to give a limited tip of 10% due to what happened ... our server finally paid attention to us, suggesting after looking at the receipt that the tip was not included already.- honestly it wasn't that busy and it was late at night."

We sat at the bar and we're expertly helped by the bartender. He explained the menu in detail along with recommendations and secret items. He also helped us with the wine list and pairing suggestions. As for the food, the seafood was quite fresh and good but the panseared mushrooms is what got to me along with the coffee, chocolate and nut ice cream. A unison of sweet, rich, and salty. Gosh, I'm craving it now.This is a wonderful place with an exceptional staff."

But this is a restaurant, not a bar and I feel it should be reviewed as such. First off, there is no English menu, and when you ask the wait staff for one they will proclaim (triumphantly was it?) that they only have a French menu. I was not offered an apology or an explanation... It's montreal in the summer time, cater to your tourists a bit!The food was uninspired and incredibly over prices. $14 for a scant cup of cold diced steak and some shaved raw veggies? $22 for a hotdog?!? I don't care if it's 12 inches, it is just a hotdog!!Montreal needs more late night eating options but this just fails on so many levels"

All the bartenders seem really adept at actual mixology, and they're really friendly and social. I'd even recommend sitting at the bar and getting to know them so that they can get to know your taste in cocktails.There's also a nice snack menu that includes fresh oysters because, well, it's supposed to be an oyster bar, so if you're into aphrodisiacs from the deep, you'll wanna check that out, too."

Its not a burger joint! we had oysters ( very fresh) snow crab (mmm) and salmon.  Our pairings were Chablis wine and their Beaujolais, and they were both very good.  Its good to see a bar that pays so much attention to the quality if their food.  Ambiance is fun young and hip.  Bartenders and servers are very fun and energetic.  This place just opened up and we were glad to be in town to stop by.  Def...

/user_details?userid=dnHvmhmUgO2eLn-oJZdQbA,Erica L.,"Columbia Heights, Washington, DC",4 star rating,A great place for a mid-afternoon drink.  The decor's quirky with wood-paneled walls and plenty of chachkies and flea market finds scattered about.  Great chill and diverse music.  My friends spent half our time there shazam-ing the playlist to find out what all the songs were.  The service was friendly but not overbearing.  The smoky laphroig 10 manhattan with orange liqueur and vermouth and rye was  balanced and packed a punch.  I'm sure it's a great neighborhood bar.

If you can, sit at the bar and chat with the friendly and knowledgable bartenders while they shuck oysters, declaw crabs, and mix cocktails. Everything on the menu (and I've tried almost all of it) is delicious, particularly the whelk and the smoked trout dishes. The prices are very reasonable for the quality and portions of food offered here - a great place to share a few dishes while sampling their extensive wine/drink list. The atmosphere is both fun and relaxed, the decor the perfect amount of kitsch vs. class. There are a lot of great restaurants to sample in Montreal, but I will keep coming back to this place for as long as I can."
/user_details?userid=ZnJG2X-EPrkqBaEyMS4udg,Thao N.,"Purchase, NY",4 star rating,"Came here with the beau on our hunt for fresh oysters, ended up finding way much more. Love the vibes, very chill and nostalgic. We ordered a dozen of oysters for $33, a 12 inch shrimp roll and the duck tartare. The oysters were fresh, the sauces went really well. The shrimp roll is good, not the best I've tried. But the duck tartare was the bomb, a perfect mixture of juicy meat, a hint of lime juice and crunchy breadsticks. We also ordered drinks, I got the white bloody Mary, the sophisticated sister of the usual one. Personally thought that the original would go better with the food we got, but this worked just fine. The only thing that got in the way was the only-French menu that we have to Google translate every time we want to order. Overall it was a satisfaction and I would definitely come for more!"

They have a beautiful cocktail list and a few good wines. Some of the highlights are the oysters, the huge dog dog and the burgots/snails. They're opened late at night and it's usually busy all week long. I love the look of the place, they managed to keep the spirit of the old fast food that was there before and incorporate some key elements that makes the style unique, like the maple sirup cans used for the ustensiles :)"

We had planned on going somewhere else and while the plan failed, we were surprisingly happy to find Le Majestique. It was a little hot in the back, but we were happy to have found a good restaurant close by (or so what people said on the street). So, all of my girlfriends loved their meals. The meals are on the small side, so expect to eat two to be full. I got the fries and  quinoa salad: expect full flavours in all the dishes. Even fries were f*ing delicious! LOL Anyway, I was able to try some of my friends' food and enjoyed theirs very much. The service was great, their wine was good, overall: no complaints, this was a great place for a girls' night. Giving it a 4/5 because they could have more vegan options. Otherwise, 5/5 for the flavours!"

We had the house hot dog, in its sculptural and tasty glory, and shared the asparagus salad and smoked fish (a real winner with long breadstick crackers and lemon). Benoit recommended a rose wine that complemented it all. The food was fresh, with inventive twists, presented well, and in a charming atmosphere with vintage plates and posters in the wall. Benoit was also glad to recommend a host of other restaurants and a bit of history in Montreal. It was a wonderful introduction to a lovely city."

And then the octopus salad was the perfect combo of light and exquisite taste. Who knew you could be ordering hot dog and octopus for the same meal and enjoy it! We also ordered the fries and oysters which were also scrumptious. The only thing to note was the service was really slow but we didn't mind as we were in no rush."

Sitting somewhere between Maison Publique and Dominion Taverne in terms of quality, price and style this is hipster food at a price even the grungiest hipsters can afford. Nothing here is crazy high quality, but the enthusiasm and vibe of the place make up for it. We started with oysters (too big and too creamy and took way too long to get to us - hint, don't have your bartender also be the oyster shucker), but passable. The escargot was your standard buttery affair, but the quality seemed a little higher than most places, the snails big and toothsome and maybe even fresh? The fried quail was bland and boring coming off pretty much as a smashed and deep fried chicken wing. The coup de grace was the hotdog for two - a Lady and the Tramp style weiner big enough for a couple to share absolutely smothered in fried shallots and resting in a butter fried bun. Yum! But, the one thing not to miss is their cream soda cocktail. It's tequila, campari, popcorn bitters and a splash of cream soda. Seriously the best cocktail I've had in a year!"

Must try the bourgot (forgot the word in English) and their ginormous hot dog. The apple slaw is fantastic!!! The sausage is very tasty and savoury. I'd go back for these two items and some oysters. They lack in the desert department completely, it was Sucre a la creme (3-4 little cubes of sugar). Cool but not tolerable for a restaurant to serve that as desert only!!! Weirded and annoyed but I like everything else about this place."
