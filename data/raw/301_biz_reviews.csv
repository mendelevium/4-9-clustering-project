It was Saturday night and I couldn't find a seat in the main area. Finally, I found one at the bar section and my beeper lighted up. I appreciate how quick the food was ready.I had the Veggie hamburger Signé Toqué! (eggplant chutney, roasted onion, tomato, lettuce) from Burger T! The burger itself looks picture perfect. From the bun to the softness of the patty. I love the tangy taste of the eggplant chutney and the fries are so crispy. I wish they gave more ketchup. Toqué! definitely makes good food. I realized that the music was very loud. Not sure if it's the entire floor or only in the bar section. But I definitely like the dim light atmosphere of the Market."
/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",2 star rating,"So I believe that Time Out Market is in the space that used to be the original Eaton's store, which then became Complexe les Ailes after Eaton's went out of business, a separate mall next to the Eaton Centre. Well, coming full circle, Complexe les Ailes has now been annexed by The Eaton Centre. Anyhow, Time Out Market is a so-called ""high end food hall."" I personally did not like the look nor feel of it. All the storefronts look more or less the same, with their restaurant names in the same font. The vendors are all next to each other and form a circle. I prefer Le Central (at Ste Catherine and St Laurent) or Assembly Chef's Hall in Toronto, where the vendors are staggered throughout the space and they can express their own style in their kiosk (different fonts, decor, theme, etc.), and it looks like an eclectic mix of businesses instead of a big corporation controlling everything, which is what it looks like to me at Time Out (this may or may not be the truth, I don't know, it's just the optics).  I also noticed that #1 the prices  are quite high and #2 most places don't sell drinks and you have to buy your beverage at a ""soda bar."" How inconvenient. I'll just say that at Le Central, most vendors have a water dispenser where you can get free water, some with lemon or other fruits infused. I definitely did not see this at Time Out. Also Time Out was super crowded and it just felt chaotic in there. I looked around and perused some menus, but I had to leave without getting anything because I couldn't stand the environment. Perhaps it is unfair for me to review this place without eating there, but I think the look and feel of a place is important, so take this review for what it is. Personally, Le Central felt to me like a welcoming place that made me want to eat there and Time Out felt like a money grab that made me what to leave ASAP. Just my opinion."
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"My least favorite food court compared to Le Central and Le Cathcart. The negative points are1) the court is too dark2)sitting area  is like picnic type with basic wooden benches and table, and not even  comfortable. 3) beyond expensive for example one single taco from Grummaan 78 is 17-18$, where at the restaurant for the same price I can get two tacos. 4) I tried 4 kiosks; I didn't like the food from 3/4 kiosks. At Grumman 78, the food was super salty. The papaya salad at Red Tiger was not flavorful, the pasta at IL Miglio was watery. Positive points are1) The bar has a great vibe2) The service is good3) Pizza from Moleskine is exceptionally delicious As I mentioned early, Time Out Market isn't that appealing compared to other food courts."
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Definitely an exciting place that offers a nice selection of very good food. We've dropped by a few times already and tried:  - Hof SuCrée (Juxos, Brownie + caramel) - Demo Kitchen - Laurent Godbout (Meatballs, The perfect egg, Carbonara d'ici) - Paul Toussaint (Jerk Cornouaille, Djondjon jambalaya) - Marusan (Tonkotsu ramen) - Olive et Gourmando (Croque on Your face, Cubain)Hof SuCrée's Juxos is an absolute gem. The first bite filled me with a whole day's worth of happiness. The crunch of the crust speckled with sugar crystals, the buttery crispness... SO GOOD. Then the beautifully tart cream cheese filling that makes everything cohesive, balancing the crust in both texture and flavor. It was a revelation!We tried a few dishes from the resident Demo Kitchen, which offered a very attractive and creative selection of dishes with local roots. The meatball with polenta was so comforting and filling. The perfect egg was rich and packed with delicious, tender mushrooms. The cauliflower carbonara was an interesting take on a much-loved classic. Comfort comfort comfort.Paul Toussaint's jerk was full of flavor. The use of fresh herbs and spices was particularly nice. The heat was well dosed and the meat was juicy and tender. Marusan's tonkotsu was tasty and rich. The portion was comparable to that of any other good ramen place in Montreal, with two good slices of pork and drops of a fragrant oil on top. Olive et Gourmando's cubain was crisp and fragrant on the outside. The melting fat from the pork on the inside made the whole experience so much better. There's actually plenty of sitting area, but just a loooooot of people. The beepers allow you to go find a place to sit while waiting for your food. But it is quite awkward to walk around with your platter when all tables are occupied - a bit like high school caf. Otherwise the spaces were clean and workers were helpful. We had some live music one time, which was lovely. Definitely a place to come back to, and a fantastic addition to the mall."

As my mother in law might say ""Take my picture because you won't see my face here again.""I'm sitting in my office where I should be working now, but I'm just so pissed off with my lunch experience here today, that I had to write this while my mind is still fresh.I understand the concept of a fancy restaurant and I understand what a food market is. This is a food court. This is not a market. I've been to markets. They are humble places with reasonable prices where you get some great food. This is nothing more than an investment by wealthy individuals seeking a handsome return on their dollar. The question is are locals stupid enough to fall for this? Allow me to elaborate.I understand the concept of paying premium prices for a great experience like a memorable night out. You will not have any of this here. What you will get is mobs of people sweating in their winter jackets standing in close quarters. I placed my order at the Vietnamese place for a beef Banh Mi sandwich with a bit of plain Pho to dip......24$!!!!!!!!!!!! For a sandwich. No rice, no salad, no sides, no drink. It's a 24$ sandwich. ""Can I get a diet 7up with that please?"" ""No sir, we don't sell drinks. You have to visit the soda bar across the market"" Soda Bar???? WHY IS THIS A THING??I wait 10 minutes with a buzzer for my sandwich. They get the order wrong and prepare a soup instead. The guy argues with me as to what I ordered. I show him my receipt. The dude is STILL giving me attitude saying that his computer says I ordered a soup. I say ""Listen bud, not only did I order the sandwich, I have a receipt showing I paid for a SANDWICH. What are the chances that I'm wrong here?"" Major panic ensues in the kitchen amongst the 15 employees scurrying around. Eventually the Banh Mi is ready and I carry my tray through the human traffic to the f!@!%ing soda bar. They don't carry diet 7up, only diet coke. I say how about a water? They give me my water and ring up a bill of 4$!!!!...for a bottle of water. Who do you think you are? Cineplex Odeon?Long story short, a sandwich and a water for over 28$ at lunch. A lunch where you have to sit on a bar stool at a counter, carry your own food, get drinks separately, and contend with a crowd of humans reminiscent of the bathroom line at the Bell Centre during a first intermission of a Habs game. I understand the gimmicky popularity of this albatross of a business model as it is thrust on the Montreal market. I almost NEVER spend 30$ on a weekday lunch at work, but the rare time I do, you better believe I'm going to be seated at a table by a human being and served with a menu rather than be treated like cattle and ripped off hard at this ridiculous place.Oh yeah, the sandwich was ok. The meat was kind of dry. You want a decent Banh Mi downtown? Go on Yelp and find it. I bet you find a family run place that knocks it out of the park for 8-10$. I'd rather support them than the soulless venture capitalists behind this monstrosity who are probably bending the restaurant owners over their knee.Glad that's off my chest!"
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",3 star rating,"I'm gonna give this place another try once the hype dies down. It's just so expensive and there's nowhere to sit. It's even more chaotic because of the Holiday crowds. A life hack for now is to get your food and eat in the bar area because it's 18+. You'll have more luck. I do admit I shouldn't have visited for the first time on a Sunday but it was unplanned and I still thought it was a beautiful food court. It's just so dark there. I get that the vibe is chic 5-7 cocktail all the time but if I'm having lunch after shopping with my family, I kinda don't think the lighting is suited for that. I tried the burger from the chef toque and it was expensiiiiiiive. I got a regular cheeseburger with extra bacon and it was tiny. They also forgot the cheese and bacon but I'll forgive them because they refunded me and were so nice about the whole issue. I also got the fries on the side. All that for $18. Steep. Next time I really wanna try the ramen."
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"I went last night, yes on the Saturday night of opening weekend (big mistake). While I liked the vibe, it was SO CROWDED. There were very diverse people, some dressed up, some casual, some tourists, mostly local Montrealers which was cool to see. Finding a seat was not an easy task but we managed to squeeze into 2 high chairs. Essentially, it's a fancy food court. Ordering from Le Red Tiger or Romados took 30mins each. Marusan and Grumman were a little quicker. Dalla Rose - forget it! The line was crazy long by 9:30pm. I found that a lot of the food I tried was dry. The tacos from Grumman had no sauce whatsoever... where's the salsa? The papaya salad from Le Red Tiger was excellent but the satay chicken bowl was bland and dry... again where's the sauce? The chicken curry from Marusan was interesting and yummy but I wish they'd have added some veggies. Lastly, the natas from Romados were good but not worth the 30mins wait!I will for sure go back once things have calmed down and it is worth a visit. Cool things are coming to Montreal :)"
/user_details?userid=7PTwhPEM7VWclYIS_1dSiw,Jéssica C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I actually really liked dining at Time Out! So many options to pick from, and the ambiance makes you feel like you're not in your everyday shopping mall food court. Althought it's definitely an elevated take on the food court, I do feel like the lack of branding made me more confused and I took so much longer to decide what I wanted to eat! I wish they had photos of the dishes somewhere! But overall you can for sure sense a more gourmet vibe from the restaurants. It's a good thing to do during winter, especially because it's accessible through the metro station, but I'm not sure how it will be during summer. Anyway what we had was really good (I forgot the name of the place but it was on the other side of Olive and Gourmand, the place that has the kitchen in an ""island"".I had the chicken corn flakes sandwitch and my bf had the canard risotto. Both really good!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Love the concept of this place. You get some of MTL's best restaurants all in one place, so you can eat a variety of stuff at the same time. We tried the djondjon rice from Paul Toussaint and the octopus and pork from club chasse et peche. The djondjon was amazingly flavorful and delicious. The octopus and the pork were very tender. As for the price, well it's a fancy food court. Fancy = pricey. We spent around 70$ for these 3 dishes. Although the food was good, we weren't full and we would have had to spend more. We went at around 5pm so it was relatively easy to get seats. If we went a bit later, it would have been much harder. My main issues with this place is the size of their menu. It's written so small that it's kinda hard to read and you have to be very close to the counter to get a glimpse on the description of their dishes. Also, they don't have an english menu. Although I'm perfectly fluent in french, my parents aren't so it was hard for them to order. Would I come back? Probably, but considering the price, I would prefer to spend that money in a real restaurant."
/user_details?userid=GlEhxPlaofxOOvcf-5guvw,Cindy D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Time Out Market Montreal just opened it's doors today and I had to check what all the fuss was about.Located on the mid floors of the Eaton Center and what used to be the Complexe des Ailes, Time Out Market is what I would call a modern food hall: top quality food, with well-known banners and chefs... a foodie's dream!I got there around 12:30, and as I expected from a grand opening day, it was crowdy. I initially wanted to try Paul Toussaint, but the line up kinda made me try somewhere else (I'll try it eventually tho). We ended up at Montreal Plaza Deli with their original soups, I ordered their pork sandwich with their Accra soup and sparkling water (+25$). Then we ended up going to Olive & Gourmando for some coffee and cookies everything was perfect and service was quick for both vendors.Needless to say that I'll be back, there are so many things to try (hi wine bar!)...I have to admit that I'm curious to see the impact of all these food hall openings on the Montreal culinary scene."
/user_details?userid=ahDxPzmaQuSOQtQMvZryZw,Anthony B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Came on a Saturday evening and it wasn't too crowded.The decor, music, vibe, seating, and layout is really cool. It definitely feels high end. The problem is that the prices everywhere are jacked up because of that I think. You have to come here willing to spend a bit of money for the 'experience' along with the food.On my first visit we ended up trying OQuebec, which was one of the most interesting menus. We got a meatball ontop of cheese polenta and a ' racclette' bowl which had various racclette dipping staples with cheese melted over it. The presentation was restaurant quality, and they tasted better than you'd expect from a food court. However for the price I didn't quite think it was worth the quantity of food we got. Polenta, cheese, ground beef, tomato is cheap but this cost $16. Not terrible but cough up another meatball!We also tried the Moleskine Brooklyn pepperoni pizza. Again, a good pizza that was done neopolitan style - crispy edges and thin slice with just the right amount of sauce and cheese. But it cost $16 for this tiny pizza. If you compare it to a place like Pizzeria 900, you get more for less. You're upcharged like $4-5 for nothing.Lastly we stopped at the bar. It's cute because it has cocktails from each of popular speakeasies from around Montreal like Coldroom. Prices here actually aren't that bad. A handmade signature cocktail for $12 isn't out of this world compared to most places. But boy it was so slow to be served despite the fact that it was not crowded. We waited like 20 minutes just for the bartender to acknowledge us, and when they finally did, it was like we were bothering them. People we're ordering ontop of each other, which complicated the whole thing. They need more than 2 people making cocktails on a Saturday. It may not have been crowded at that time, but I can't imagine how it would be like.There is also a beer and wine section which I thought was pretty neat. The wine selection looks interesting and the prices didn't seem absurd but I'm not a wine expert.I'll come back here soon to try more. The pho, taco, and pastas looked good. The longest line we saw was for the portegeuse chicken Ramados. I don't quite understand why that's so hyped up, these places are a dime a dozen in the city. There is plenty of places to go that's cheaper and nicer, I don't know why you'd come to the Mall food court for it."
/user_details?userid=WMK1j18ACm-EtopEznV4Rg,Jana T.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"When I first heard about the concept of an ""upscale food court"" it kind of sounded like an oxymoron to me... but checking out the bustling new Time Out market has proven me wrong.  In a long neglected space in the Eaton Centre, a beautiful vibrant open concept food court has been created, with some of Montreal's finest restaurants having outlets here.  The likes of Foxy, Plaza and Moleskin as well as at least a dozen more can be seen.  Each place offers only a few items and there has been attention to ensure that there is little overlap between the restaurants.  Mains are generally priced at around $14-20.  It was hard to choose which place to try, but I was nursing a cold on a chilly night and a big bowl of ramen seemed like just the thing.  Marusan has three ramen options, regular, black garlic and spicy miso.  I took the black garlic and really enjoyed the flavourful broth, tender noodles and tasty slices of pork.  Service was really friendly and quite quick.  They give you buzzers so you don't have to hover while waiting for your food.  Seating is on large communal tables.  On a busy Thursday night we had to hover briefly to get a spot but one soon opened up. There were some other great spots like a demonstration space and a lively bar that looked very promising that I didn't have time to visit but I am definitely looking forward to my next Time Out!"

/user_details?userid=X-_KbWOstBeSLw6rm9S56Q,Narendgie M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Friday night after work my friend and I went for our typical catch up date. We were amazed by the beauty of the place and how modern it looks. Enormous variety of food kiosk. Different culture, taste, spice and most importantly very creative. This time I went for the Haitian booth ""  Paul Toussaint "" and ordered the "" Djondjon Jambalaya "" very delicious I enjoyed every bite. The exact Haitian spice taste that I'm familiar with. Fancy looking but succulent. My friend went to "" Moleskine "" where they serve wood oven pizza and got the ""  Marguerite with extra burrata cheese and a side of antipasto "". I'm more a conservative when it comes to food, I stick to what I know but after tasting this meal I will be definitely more open to more and more varieties. I did have a bad experience there. As they only accept cards at the restaurants I was advised to purchase the store gift card for the amount of bill but when I went back to pay my meal I've changed the order as I realized they had something I wanted to try instead. The cashier was very nice however some technical issues had her call for support from the "" Time Out guy "" he's probably a manager or something. The most horrible human being I've seen in customer service. He was rudely talking to the girl as she was stupid for not being able to complete the order on two different cards. When he processed the order and give me the receipt and buzzer. He gave me the dirtiest look, like what was I still doing in front of him when he was done. His face expression had no filter when all I wanted was to have the card back so I can refill it to use it around because they don't accept cash. I also have to mention that it is hard to find a sit there. The place is very popular since their opening in mid November. But they have a bar section 18+ that I'm dying to go back and experience it. Also the dessert and ice cream booth. Will definitely go back and recommend it too."
/user_details?userid=vTsbejwscDEdA3Ao_aIQMg,Lawrie S.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Very cool concept food court. I think it's a great addition to downtown Montreal and a big step up from the department store which used to occupy this space. It's not the cheapest food court but it makes up for it with the quality of the food, the (seemingly) hundreds of options available and the live music. It was busy with all sorts of people, young families with children as well as older crowds. It's separated by a food area and a bar area where only adults are allowed. There are so many interesting restaurants, many which would usually be out of my way so I was very impressed with the selection. You're free to walk around and once you decide to order, you pay right away and are given a buzzer. I would suggest finding a place to sit if you are with multiple people and take turns going back to get your food if you are multiple people.I hope they include more seating in the future because it is very crowded. Maybe once it's novelty wears off it won't be so busy. It also took a lot of time for each of us to get our orders and it was over half an hour after we entered the food court that we were seated with our drinks and enjoying our meal."

But we did have a few places we knew we would want to eat. So when we stumbled on to the Time Out Marlet as we wandered, we were thrilled to find a space that featured a few of the places we wanted to get some food, like Moleskine and Rosado's. (They are as good as people say they are!) There's lots of communal seating and lots of staff quickly cleaning off spaces. And since the place gets busy, it can be tricky to find seating but a little patience will land you a place to perch with Montreal goods. Be sure to stop by the merchandise area - they stock a lot of interesting items to take home for yourself or to give as mementos of your trip."
/user_details?userid=bUPeHBFEINhqiKj9-k4-zA,Charles N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Montreal's second food hall, Time Out Market, is the city's most ambitious culinary project that brings together 16, and counting, well known local chefs and restaurants in an enormous 40,000-square-foot space which comfortably seats 600 people on the second floor of the Eaton Centre. From its humble beginnings as a magazine to market, the approach of Time Out Montreal was similar to its global locations where carefully curated chefs and restaurants are given a one year contract to serve the hall.What makes the Time Out Market concept relatively unique is guest don't have to fork out hundreds of dollars to satisfy their fine dining adventures, in fact one can order a dish or two all under $20, and don't require reservations to be made weeks in advance.Conversely, what makes the market attractive to restauranteurs is that they don't have to worry about the hassles of a building, furnishing  kitchen equipment, marketing or permit issues and only have to cover labour, ingredients costs and revenue share in exchange for the turnkey service. Here's a list of the establishments you can choose from. More will be added in time:Le Burger T!

Unfortunately we got there literally 10 minutes before closing so only 2 vendors were sweet enough to let us order! We had the sausage pizza from moleskine - absolutely perfect! & beyond flavorful and fresh! Next we had classic romados - now hear me out .. maybe because it was closing time and the left over from the day? But my chicken was so dry it needed a glass of water! However romados is by far my #1 spot for chicken! And ofcourse chalet bbq! Anyways I enjoyed the fries. Overall the entire concept is super cool! I definitely want to go back and try out some other restaurants. Love the decor to this place and how clean it is as well! There is always someone cleaning and constantly! Home for the foodies

Too crowded, no where to sit, too many restaurants for the little amount of tables, tried already different places, disappointed. Had a tostada at a taqueria, old iceberg lettuce, little toppings, very bland. Had a mushroom campagnelle at a pasta place, looked very good, tasted awful, too much msg's. There was a bakery where everything looked dry. Looked around, nothing seemed good. To pricey for what it is. The only place that looked good was a Caribbean one that serves a huge rib dish, I'll probably try it one time, people seemed to enjoy that one."

This time I was here I had a early lunch so waiting time was only around 10 mins. I thought the whole point of bringing all these fancy restaurants together as a food court is for people to try more choices at same time but with lower price or tapas kind of menu. But it's opposite, prices are high, menus are mostly main courses. I do think  the burger I had from burger T was very average and pricy, consider it's just a regular burger, for 14$. 4$ extra for fries. For other stands, I think the food is also overpriced for small portion, no ambiance and no service. No regular drink sold with the food. I had to go to soda bar and order a house soda, which was refreshing but it wasn't mixed well, the bottom half was too sweet for me. No where to hang coat so the coats took some stool. Making it harder to find place to sit. All menu in French, not so friendly to the tourists. I prefer to see some pictures on the board. All menu on black board are so plain and boring. With so many to choose from, it's overwhelming to decide. I prefer to visit their original location if they have one."

The cocktails were excellently crafted, and even though there was only one bartender working she took her time to make each cocktail well, while still maintaining efficiency. The atmosphere in the area was very cool, and we especially enjoyed the music that was paying.

I may be biased as a vegan, but the menu looked promising at first, what with all the veg options listed before the launch. Needless to say, Marsuan's vegetable curry has tofu simmered in beef broth, disappointing. The veggie T burger was a basic bean patty that was bland if not for the eggplant chutney. And the vegan hot-dog from food chain had to be the most stereotypical vegan thing: a bun with shredder tofu mixed with condiments. No Beyond sausage here, too bad. The not so nice part was that all the dishes were served on the cold side, and not just the vegan ones it seems.Overall not a bad place but I can't get myself to give it 4 stars, at least for now. It desperately needs vegan options."

I can't remember the name but it was fresh and delicious. It's a great spot to convene with friends that have different appetites or drinking desires. I gave it 4 stars because I found it pricey. The meal attached cost me 60$

So I was really excited about one opening here in Montreal. I was a bit disappointed in this location. This place is nothing like the one in Lisbon. The food is so unreasonably priced for a food court like place. They have a DJ onsite; hence, it's quite loud (people talking + the loud music). They have made it this market like some fancy place: expensive food, loud music, separate bar area. It's interesting how this food market is in the eaton centre, core downtown. And the unreasonable food prices do not attract the ones who work in the area. Very few people are okay with paying $25/meal frequently. I am fine with paying $23 for a pasta if I go to a restaurant because I'd get a separate table, a server serving us food, etc. Whereas, here I am paying the same price but no service and no separate table. The prices just don't make sense for a food court type of place. Just a fancy and expensive food court."

The food is overpriced and the portions are really small. The choices are also mediocre, i had to walk 3-4 rounds to pick something up. I have tried the tacos, they are alright,but notthing too exciting to talk aboutThe pizza is pretty good and i would recommend it.The pasta place mushrooms pasta decent, the tomato salad is good but 11 buxThe french peche place is okay, flanc the porc with some veggies.It's a good place to hang out and have a drink after work,but the drinks start at 10 bux plus tax n tip.If you want to be full,get ready to spend about 40 bux"
/user_details?userid=xZCVxM7KS49Jj2F_CiiRmA,A. R.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Stopped to grab a sandwich at the Montreal Plaza booth at Time Out at 7pm on a Tuesday nite. I can never turn down an option for extra variety (read: I can never make up my mind ) so I went with the half & half sandwich option: half pork tonkatsu and half egg+egg, on Hof Kelsten bread . (I swear, every time I see those words on a menu, I hear angels chanting in the distance ) Unblessedly, the only miracle here was that both sandwiches managed to be dry AND soggy at the same time. This must mean one thing: they ran out of HK bread, right? Right?! #denialBut seriously, don't blame the bread. Both sandwiches were obviously pre-assembled, God knows when. Even the wax paper wrapping was cold from the fridge.Sadly, the fillings did not atone for the sins of the wrapper. The egg salad was a bland chunky paste swimming in tasteless sauce (I won't insult mayo by calling it that). And the pork may have at one time aspired to be a chop; it was more like a thin slab of cold meatloaf that got breaded and fried a few days ago, then tossed in a pile of prickly bitter cabbage that seemed to be there solely to fend off predators. Did I miss a turn and end up at the airport by mistake? Where else do you get to pay $20 for a bland, soggy, overpriced pre-made sandwich, sit in uncomfortable seats and fight off constant noise over the PA system? They should just give in, rename this whole place YUL East and start running a shuttle to Dorval."
/user_details?userid=2tOny3tty9BlhrGRLWPHqA,Christina C.,Hong Kong,3 star rating,"It's a high end food court.  Food is good.  You get to try most of the popular Montreal eateries under one roof and in a central location too.  (Some of them are not open for dinner or weekends.  E.g. Il Miglio)What I didn't like though is that the POS automatically asks you to tip, as if you are at a sit down restaurant.  Maybe I am just cheap but again, it is a food court that charge CAD15-16 for a pasta.  It is completely self served.Also everything is written in French so if you don't read French or is unfamiliar with the restaurants, it will take you a few minutes to figure out what are on the menus.  (I know this is Quebec but still...)Finally, card only.  No cash is accepted."
/user_details?userid=zZYpI2V_6C36JPa9Ul_bFQ,Alec Y.,"Richmond, Canada",3 star rating,"An elevated food court that features many cuisines in the heart of Montreal. I went to Romado's (Portuguese) and Marusan (ramen) and enjoyed the food for $15, but found the portions to be lacking for the price paid.Timeout is a stylish area and very uniform, which is cool and a pain point at the same time. Each food option has a black storefront and menu with small text, making it hard to distinguish between the selection and decide on what to eat. Like others said, it's also hard to find a place to sit during lunch.Overall, there's a lot of hype surrounding the market that's partially justified. I have my reservations but I wouldn't mind going here again to eat or show a friend around."
/user_details?userid=j_ywrYvgiy63z1paw-ToUQ,John G.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Early lunchtime visit had me try Paul Toussaint and Montreal Plaza deli. Over 20$ for each item, so with sida,  a 50$ lunch. Was it worth it? I sort of say yes for the chance to taste some of the city's better cuisines at a fraction of their dinner prices. I also say no, as portion sizes reflect appetizer servings and leave you hungry for more. Thus my two purchases. Paul's ceviche were great while Charles Antoine's whelks were amazing. might come back to taste-test a few more but the place was a ZOO by shortly before noon. So some UPDATE: Went back to try Romados, one of my go-to Portuguese chicken spots on Rachel E., aNd delighted to see them at T/O market. But no, very disappointed in service and quality! Cold chicken, no spicy sauce, lukewarm fries. A major downer..."

Highly recommend eats from Hof SuCree, Foxy and Paul Toussaint.

/user_details?userid=AFNpn4nZzSkPB5-J-PbnIA,Lily S.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,I didn't go in with a lot of expectations because my experience with the Boston Time Out Market has been lackluster. But one of the stalls here really amazed me! I got the salmon confit from Montreal plaza (Charles-Antoine Crête & Cheryl Johnson) and it was one of the best things I have tasted during my visit in Montreal. The salmon was so fatty and well seasoned that it melted in my mouth. The sushi rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned with a sweet soy-like sauce. The scallions on top and the tempura bits were the cherry on top that gave the whole dish a nice finish and a crunchy texture. The staff at the stall were also very kind and patient with me as I was being extremely indecisive of what to order. Overall I highly recommend trying their food or their restaurant!

Hopefully it will become Montrealer's foodie landmark."
/user_details?userid=KFsbACIHXQxyff_W6CN1LA,Karen H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I heard only good things about this food market. Finished work and was on my way. Upscale mall dining! I was overwhelmed by the choices. There had to be 25  or more different food kiosks, different flavours, cultures and all open concepts. A huge bar on the side, alcohol is served as well. Took me awhile to choose, I can be indecisive when so much to choose from. I chose a place called Foxy, Griffith town BBQ. My dish was pulled duck coleslaw with a side  of grilled yams in a spicy mayo sauce. The flavours and spices  just exploded in my mouth. I was hooked immediately. The yams were grilled to perfection, I had to use my knife to slice it. The sweetness mixed with heat was absolutely satisfying. Overall I so enjoyed my choice this evening and want to return so I can once again step out of my box. Oh btw they do not take cash, cards only!  Next choice will be Paul Toussaint which i have a passionate fare for Caribbean food.. yayyyy. Ended with my signature, a good cappuccino. You will love this place!"

/user_details?userid=MDXqulpNz_WcAJd-mclwoA,Jackie S.,"Mont-Royal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great concept and amazing variety of great restaurants. The Time Out market is essentially a high end food court. What is great is the selection of restaurants. Things that need work: it is often hard to find a place to sit. Secondly, the menu is in French only (I believe). This can be a challenge for out of towners who would definitely be visiting the market."
/user_details?userid=F-C-G3GTkA0pBkwkpHDYqg,Gabriel P.,"Lexington, MA",1 star rating,"The idea of a ""high end"" food court is a great trend. We have been to some amazing ones in New York. Great food, great varieties, great prices. I see the advantages to the chefs as they focus on just their plates and let the market take care of the rest. Great business model that should give the consumer great food at great prices. The Time Out Market in Lisbon does this. Unfortunately, the one in Montreal does not and is a flop. The food options are not good. Not a good variety at all. Instead of going after high profile chefs, find up and coming chefs who are willing to make a effort. These chefs are resting on their laurels and are not even trying. They probably think they are doing the masses a favour by exposing us to their food. As a result, prices are outrageous and options are poor. The prices may work in a sit down restaurant with service, but in the food court they do not. I am sure you can find chefs willing to provide much better food at much better prices. If you want to stay in business, you should replace 80% of the existing shops. Other problems (I hope you can fix them):-not enough seating but if you don't fix the food/prices, this won't be a issue-drinks in a separate area does not work. Is this a city by-law? It is a problem. -why do the payment systems ask for tips? Not right in a food court (even a ""high-end"" one).  We order at the counter, we pick up our own food, we seat ourselves, etc. No we should not be tipping. Pay your workers appropriately. -English menus would be much appreciated Bottom line: the idea is great. We will see more and more of these places appear and if they are run properly, they are great for consumers. It is the future of the food industry. However, the Montreal Time Out Market must change their business model and philosophy. Right now it looks like you are trying to expose famous chefs to the masses. Wrong. Try this: provide great food at good prices. Forget the ""famous"" chefs. If you can adapt, you are onto a great concept. If not, the current model will not work."

A great fuel for the rest of the day - however, the ""security guards"" or whatever-the-hell's were highly unpleasant inside the 18+ bar section. One approached me and very rudely stated how I ""clearly don't look 18,"" that is until I pulled out my ID and hushed him up. Rather than being professional and apologetic of the situation, he proceeded to give me a snobby attitude prior to leaving my table. Honestly, it ruined the experience for me and truly put me in a crabby mood the rest of my meal. In retrospect, perhaps avoid the bar setting if you're 5'3 , like myself, and ""don't look 18,"" unless you're not looking for a similar unpleasant experience."

You also get a free apple with every meal from Foodchain. Don't mind if I do!Sat down and ate my meal in the bar area with a beer.

Shells were good, fish ball filling wasn't ""wow"". Their sweet potatoes with garlic were beyond ""wow"" absolutely must try. Romados chicken was disappointing for the men - they said it lacked the ""wood fire"" taste and was just like regular chicken. Only one area to buy beer and wine and you have to have your meal there. In other words, no buying a beer and sitting elsewhere - you have to wait for a seat to open up. Not smart. The beverage stations provided water, soft drinks and cocktails. $5.00 for water is a bit pricey (they do offer pitchers of regular). Only one person manning each station so if you're stuck behind someone who has ordered cocktails - you'll have to wait for water and your meal will be cold be then. Would not go back in the evening - might consider it as an alternative to a fast food lunch."
