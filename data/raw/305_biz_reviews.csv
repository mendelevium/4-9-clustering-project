/user_details?userid=0Se8OFrPpi6wE2TY2IVTLA,Eric N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Small little cozy place, very tasty Japanese/Korean food.We ordered the following: Shrimps tempura, pork bone soup and Korean style BBQ pork.The shrimp tempura were crispy, but soft crispy because its all freshly made unlike other restaurant where they refry the tempura multiple times and it becomes super hard.Pork bone soup, smell very good, an amazing taste of authentic Korean soup.Korean BBQ pork, one of the most stunning dishes tonight for me. Although it's a little bit over burnt, but it's super tasty, licking good! The meat were falling of the bones easily.Recommended!!"

The food was exceptionally good. I shared the vegetable tempura and ordered the fried chicken udon noodle soup; wow! The tempura was not only generous in portion but super delicious with a crispy batter. The soup I would go back for a million times over! Spicy, delicious broth and the noodles were so so good! The only reason I'm giving this place a 4 is mostly cause the decor may need a little freshening up, and although we were a big group, the service was a little slow. Will definitely visit again!"

The resto itself is small but good for a group of 12 max..reservations are highly recommended as it is has become a popular place. The ambiance and decor is really cozy and modern with it's lightbulb fixtures filled with flowers. So pretty! The service is absolutely great ..superfriendly and warm. The food was delicious and reasonably priced..not expensive at all for the great qualityWe tried several dishes which were beautifully plated and yummy!! I would definately recommend this place for a date, night out with friends, birthday celebrations or family supper!Check out my pictures of the food!"

/user_details?userid=9MD2Ry2jQ08z1_4VKpEmfQ,Kate G.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"The food is okay - I had the chicken katsu with cheese, which was awfully sweet, and despite being a ""bento box"" it came with only one piece of tempura and a salad with way too much sweet dressing. Also there was some kind of mashed potato in the chicken, which was weird. Worse than that though was the fact that the service ignored me completely the whole time I was there. I was the only one in the restaurant and the only waiter was playing video games. The chef had to refill my water because he acted like I wasn't there. I could see his computer from my table - he was playing games at the bar!Won't be coming back to this place."

/user_details?userid=3FrXYUTywEhmO8rTMq18XA,John J.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Super tasty and fast affordable spot to stop by for lunch. I've had the bibimbap, chicken katsu and chicken teriyaki. All are excellent but the katsu (without cheese) is probably my favourite."
/user_details?userid=vHeE-J3qSMl1tZfAILOgww,Ashley L.,"Longueuil, Canada",4 star rating,"We stopped in here for lunch on a whim.  We were happy with the food, the atmosphere was nice.  Overall a good place to stop in and have a bite.I had the shrimp katsu and it was really good, served with tempura veg, dipping sauces and rice.  We got some starters to share and everything was great.  I definitely recommend the fried octopus balls, I could have licked the plate clean if that weren't frowned upon."
/user_details?userid=iqQBsjqOF9xgIAbsZ2sAZA,David M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Just looking at the outside reminds me of Japanese menus in Tokyo.Colorful pictures with each plate and price put right on the street, I love itI had a the bulgogi plate, BBQ Korean Beef Bento Box ($12:95)comes with soup, salad, mixed veggies and rice.Awesome, the tempura veggies were perfect.I wanted to try their sushi, but the selection is limited and bit pricey, so better for next time on it's own.It's definitely a rare gem and not unlike anything else in this area."
/user_details?userid=KJIS0INMJKhBmGqFkHMc-A,Mai Lynn L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"So let's go straight to the point : their salmon salad is really delicious. It didn't feel like an authentic Japanese salad but I'm not even mad because I just really enjoyed it. Now, their seafood udon isn't the best udon I had. Let's just say it's not packed with flavours and it kinda felt a bit cheap. But in the past, I tried their shrimp bento and it was really good. I would probably not order their udon again but I'll definitely come back for the salmon salad and their bento boxes. Also, the ambiance is quiet and intimate which is nice when you want to hold a conversation."

Good portion.  Good to shareIt is more Korean meals than Japanese foods. I like the pork bone soup. Salmon sushi is good, big piece and fresh salmon. Not too cheap but a little bit too much of rice"
/user_details?userid=JJMVRbtxw7M-geC6xStS_A,Mathieu B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Excellent, everything was fresh and taste perfect.We tried the takowasabi, udon noodle and bento box shrimp.way better than other japanese / korean in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=kf_CbmP0sVhzC1gA1zFEMw,Sprydle M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Quite possibly the best bibimbap I've had outside of Los Angeles. The salad and soup were equally good. All for $13, quite the deal.  Service was friendly and quick and the decor is a eclectic mix of Japanese and Korean."
/user_details?userid=-d2274Q6FcljUcshAqcWtg,Nhi N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here twice; one time with a friend and the second time was with my family.Food was good, but do not expect authentic Korean or Japanese food. It's a fusion kind of restaurant. As for their services, it was really good.The price is fair for the quantities we get."
/user_details?userid=-y8mv6-8C-IJWsy00EWAfA,Jehanne A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Nice fusion Japanese/Korean place on St-Laurent. We started with the wasabi octopus - amazing - seriously you have to try this and you will want to eat more and more and more forever and ever.We then had the gamjatang and the bulgogi - both were good and quite filling - you won't leave hungry that's for sure!The service is very friendly and the food is good. It's neither completely Japanese nor completely Korean so if you're looking to try typical food from one of those you might be disappointed as this is really rather a mix of both kinda place.

/user_details?userid=6mgPpxdEGM4u4CvU37t_oA,Julie L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Recommand for couple night out. The Chicken Karaage was really good. Highly recommand. But the pork bento was 8/10.
/user_details?userid=XxNd-LIlQE-K3cCajrFmtw,Mei Y.,"Tokyo, Japan",4 star rating,"have just had dinner with Asian food hunters. we reserved our place in advance but wasnt crowded at all. maybe its still too new. anyway lucky us to stay for like 3hrs.food was beautiful and creative. i paid like 12.50$ and got shrimp fries/spring roll/tempura/even fried potate on my plate, on top of rice. there is more luxualy choice like sushi and sashimi as well.but best part of this resto was their ""cleaness"". not only bcz its new, but also their way to serve, to clean the table, to pour water, to present dishes... they are really careful in many ways. good service."
/user_details?userid=zpsx2bCau4CtMDRW1e8cGQ,Jess R.,"Oakland, CA",5 star rating,"Just had one of the freshest korean meal in a long time! The most delicious Gamjatang, spicy pork soup and amazing fish tempura with a perfectly suited Miyazaki soundtrack. It's a new restaurant in Petite-Italie neighborhood and I highly suggest it! Miam!"
/user_details?userid=p5ImLIQ8dWev2ECadU1Shg,Jennifer P.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"My husband and I came to Makoto as he'd had a wonderful lunch here recently and was excited for me to give it a try.  The decor was lovely, the service was excellent, but the food left something to be desired.  The  sashimi was still frozen, the pork katsu was tough and overcooked, and the seafood okonomiyaki was undercooked and gooey.  Overall, not the experience I was expecting."
/user_details?userid=ItDonnwQLDPWr3fbktJQKA,Keith L.,"Pleasanton, CA",4 star rating,"Awesome food.  The soy sauce Korean ribs were the bomb, flavorful, fall off the bone, crunchy a bit and broiled to perfection.  The Japanese pancake, Okonomiyaki, was like what I had in Japan, full of vegetables with a great sauce.  The golden gate roll was big but the rice was a bit dry.  Overall great place but they need to improve the service and it would be 5 stars."

/user_details?userid=wC9kAmaXAnxv45hRn8CW0w,Shooka S.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"My husband and I just had lunch there.. Having few Korean friends and having eaten in many Korean restaurants, I have had experienced many great Korean dishes.. Today we just wanted to try a new place and I found Makoto on yelp.. With positive reviews... Went there, I ordered beef Bulgogi, my husband vegetable and shrimp tempura... In my bulgogi there was little beef.. Very greasy... Very little rice, and above all it was tasteless, no flavour.. In my husband's tempura, there was only three shrimps and the rest was sweet potato tempura or something like that.. Bad experience, and if you are reading to go there.. Dont bother and try a different place"
/user_details?userid=RwI-DtK_1D7Rf5sL7i3gdg,Dave T.,"Dorval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Small menu (expecially for sushi) but its good. The takoyaki were amazing. The price were amazing as well.
/user_details?userid=J7aVQ1Pzr8bq2SZHCuC3FQ,Evan F.,"Calgary, Canada",5 star rating,"I was extremely pleased with my visit here.Located near the northern end of Little Italy, this newly opened Korean-Japanese restaurant is truly a delight.The decor is pleasant, but nothing too special; they took over from an older restaurant; it's not a new construct. The server is quite pleasant and the menu is detailed and comprehensive. They have a decently wide range of items, including takoyaki, udon, yakiudon, okonomiyaki, etc.Prices are quite affordable: 11-13 dollars in general for bentos and noodles, while certain dishes like the galbi are closer to 18. Tempura and karaage are around 14 for large orders. They also have sushi and sashimi, which range in the 18 to 28 dollar range.They stay open until 9 o'clock, but if you're there already they won't force you out even if it's past 9. The meal presentation is extremely tasteful and clean, and added a lot to the dining experience.Now the food! Everything was fresh and hot. The salad is a sesame-vinaigrette common to many Japanese restaurants, and the miso soup is quite delicious. I ordered the takoyaki appetizer, which was also fresh and hot, and quite flavourful. For the main I had the pork katsu bento, which includes spring rolls, vegetable tempura, and garlic potatoes on top of rice. The katsu was freshly fried and hot, with a sweet and tangy katsu sauce complemented by spicy mayo. We also ordered karaage (fried chicken) to share, which was delicious.Overall this was an extremely pleasant experience and I highly recommend it."
/user_details?userid=DK7vRHzRJUzYZHN1frKxdA,Kober O.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"Their gamjatang had more bones than meat. Their seaweed salad had more cabbage than seaweed. The place is clean and the service is pleasant, though."
