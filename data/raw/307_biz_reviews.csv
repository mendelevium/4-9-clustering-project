/user_details?userid=nlisSJSWQ6zpkhCTjfnOeA,Amanda J.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,Amazing food and over the top service!  the chef is super talented!  I'm so happy my friend took me to her favourite restaurant in Montreal.  It is the best kept secret :) she ordered the galbi ravoli and the pork main dish and I had the succulent beef bugoli.
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"3 1/2 stars. After reading a critic on Tastet, we knew we had to come here to try it out ourselves. Being a fan of BYOB and Korean cuisine, it was a no brainer. A bit more expensive then most Korean (even for byob), keep in mind that it situated in the Plateau. So still good eats. This place has been opened for 5 months now and still needs some refinements with the service. This opinion is from the fact that we had our order taken 45 minutes after arriving and that we had to ask them for certain things such as the banchan that they forgot to bring to our table. The food itself was tasty and all but lack that Korean punch that I was looking for. Perhaps they've adjusted to fit the more "" Americanize "" palette? I've taste way more authentic even though this establishment is Korean run. One of our appetizers, the fried chicken in a sweet sauce (we both said it's a general Tao) was 6 tiny bite size for 7$, had more batter then meat ratio. Too expensive in my opinion but very crispy and tasty nonetheless. Both our mains came on a sizzling plate but not sizzling. It was more for presentation then anything else. It wasn't pippin hot. My husband had the squid that was supposed to be spicy but wasn't. It was on the chewy side (over cooked) but still tasty. I had the bulgogi and I thought it lacked a bit of character. Now don't get me wrong. This place is worth coming if you're around the area. Maybe just not worth the 50 minutes drive (plus another to return home). That's how long it took us to get here. Service itself is ok. They still need to refine their method and communicate a bit more. I've notice some errors but nothing major. Although they were super busy, this family run restaurant still managed to make us feel very welcome!"

We were greeted with the sweetest smile from the owner & the young waitress. The food was authentic (a bit less spicy due to the ""plateau""effect) and well-presented, and It was exactly what we needed! It's also relatively inexpensive for the neighbourhood considering the attentive service and the beautiful decor. You can even make it a weekend night combo with Pit Caribou after for a beer. Im gonna be a regular here after my first experience (ps: better arrive not too hungry on weekend, the food comes out a bit slow when it's full house) !"
/user_details?userid=TVl-6rwmk98I0mHLIKGjVg,Jean K.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Delicious fresh ingredients. I'm Korean, and I enjoyed the food. We ordered the Haemool Jeon and the dolsot bibimbap and bulgogi. Everything was fresh and well presented. (I am miffed that we had to pay for kimchi- that is rare). But nice vibe to the place, pretty, well decorated. They nailed the ambience. We came on a Sunday night and the entire restaurant was full. It is BYOB, there is a convenience store down the street where we picked up some beer."

Everything was delicious: dumplings, tofu and crispy chicken. I took the pork BBQ as my main, which was very flavourful, and she thoroughly enjoyed the vegetarian poke bowl. Excellent service, reasonable prices, and most importantly, great tasting food."
