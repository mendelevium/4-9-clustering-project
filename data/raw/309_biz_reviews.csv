/user_details?userid=QRIzeHyThRsY6_N7r4A4tw,Shaw T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Must-try for their warm spanakopita and other Greek phyllo pastries. Portions are generous and prices reasonable. Also, tasty. Very tasty (although I have only tried the spanakopita). It was just perfect as a mid-afternoon snack; i guess it could even be a light meal if paired with a salad.I cannot believe I waited all this time before trying, particularly for the spanakopita sucker that i am.Head over for a quick Greek bite if you're in the area.Efkharisto, Melina!"
/user_details?userid=nJVS18mJIB1hCHq1YsFbUQ,Bonnie C.,"Newton, MA",4 star rating,"Stopped by here for a small treat and ended up ordering the Spanakopita because we were craving for something savory. They offer outside seating and has a couple of tables inside. The staff was extremely nice and pleasant. For $5 CAD, they offer a nice portion of the pastry. The phyllo dough was so delicious - delicate but has so many textures. I honestly cannot get enough of it and I am so envious of locals who get to eat this often! Will highly recommend and will be back for the sweet pastries and coffee"
/user_details?userid=i_4JP5Co6WZqgoPHnIPh4g,Bertha F.,"Portland, ME",5 star rating,My spouse is Greek and knows here Greek food. She insists the we come here every time we have one our hedonistic Montréal weekends. It's superb!
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,"There's nothing much to add about this place because everyone's already said it. It's delicious food, the service is excellent, the people are friendly, super affordable, etc....I've had most of their pastries as well as the spanikopita and the ricotta and feta cheese phyllo. Try this place ASAP!"
/user_details?userid=tAtblebDRTiB9TkAxupncQ,Ivan M.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"Best spanakopita I've had since leaving Toronto's danforth  neighborhood!Prices are good, the place is very small and has far more seating outside than in - definitely worth the trip if you like Greek phyllo pastry dishes!"
/user_details?userid=NfHDvT0wU6EZlOT42UgEPg,Rachel K.,"Portland, OR",5 star rating,"I've tried every pastry here and they are all amazing. My favorite savory pastry is the spanakopita. For the sweet pastries, I don't think I could choose a favorite they're all too good, especially the vanilla custard and the baklava. Last night we actually ordered way too many pastries. I had a large assortment set aside when we all went in so that there was plenty for everyone. I made sure there would be a few left over for breakfast. But then my MIL and husband also ordered extras for breakfast while I waited outside since it's a small shop and is always so busy. I'm not completely sure they realized how many I had already ordered. A lot of people also stop in for cafe drinks to go. Every time I go in here, it's packed with people enjoying chats and patiently waiting for their turn. But it's a cheerful and pleasant place to be in spite of it being so busy. So we now have pies for days and I couldn't be happier about it. I love Montreal."

My boyfriend had the Melinda sandwich, which was very flavorful. Small menu, small restaurant, but very friendly staff and great patio."

Happy to see childhood acquaintances do well :)"
/user_details?userid=yudgVIfAQzuP1tcaetfvlA,Lino M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,What I tried I liked - a lot....Looking forward to being in the area so that I can pop in again!
/user_details?userid=MWCPUFk-fnNXehPosCtwHA,Geneviève F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Amazing, welcoming service that makes you want to go back just to say hi! The Greek salad is the best one I've found in this area by far and is not expensive at all. If you can catch a freshly cooked full meal such as the Greek lasagna, those are also definitely worth bringing back home (and you should stack up on them and freeze them!) Great quality for the price, try it!"
/user_details?userid=zrxI4UP5BhuzX_5SsmzQEw,Beatrice L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"FANTASTIC little neighbourhood spot. Slow down as you approach its blue signage because it can easily be missed as you walk up (or down) Park Avenue. I got the ricotta phyllo...which was quite heavy but VERY good. These things are big, so bring someone to share it with! THEIR COOKIES ARE TO DIE FOR. SERIOUSLY. Honey cinnamon (or something of that nature) was devoured within a minute of gobble time. Chocolate chip walnut, same deal. Getting hungry again just thinking about them. Soft and chewy, just the way I like my cookies. But go for the phyllo experience, of course... OH and the girl who served me was so sweet and adorable. HIGH rating for her!"
/user_details?userid=2Vghk7w3PLUgfXJb42lPvQ,Ylani B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I am a little obsessed with their spanakopita.it is just like in greece.it is served warm and they cut it into small pieces to make it easy to munch and give you more time to savour the deliciousness.I've tried almost everything on their menu and will keep coming back.this is the cutest greek bakery in montreal.
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"Every time I've grabbed Spanakopita from here it's been still-warm. That alone is remarkable and the flavour, size, and price of these hot flaky little bundles of joy puts them way over the top into heavenly. Too salty is the usual downfall of Greek savoury treats, because of all that cheese, but these are light and buttery and just perfect. The place is cute as a button too: highly recommended."
/user_details?userid=mYQmaTeWp87sGnE-rHvIOw,Evelyn G.,"Golden Square Mile, Canada",3 star rating,Its fine.  Tiny place. But love the local flavor.  Cute place with lovely staff.  I tried the Baklava.  I have had better.  Cappuccino was nice.  Yes - I would stop by if I walked by and needed a coffee boost.
/user_details?userid=O_vUuQcWa6-QuMzpIDaElg,Jen W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,The spinach phyllo is out of this world!!! Can't wait to return and try everything on the menu!!
/user_details?userid=2pInNXbdv1GI88GPlj9aOQ,Joe L.,"Montreal-West, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been coming here since they first opened. All their ""-pitas"" are amazing. Very similar to what you get in Greece. Ohhh that bougatsa is sooooo good."
/user_details?userid=O9rbVxtEnxnjKIdeuBjPOw,Jenny G.,"Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is a hidden gem on Parc Avenue. Blink and you will miss it. I have heard about this place for a year or two and just never made it out that way. On the way home today I told my mom that I wanted to treat her to a tiropita or spanakopita. She asked for a keratopita (meat pie) but it wasn't on the menu. I ordered 3 cheese pies and one bougatsa.  Since they were to go the lady serving us asked if I wanted her to cut them into bite size pieces. Great idea. Since I ordered the bugasta I was offered the choice of cinnamon or powdered sugar I choose both. She was happy to oblige. On the way home my mom and I dug into the pies and damn. They were good. My mom is super picky about tiropita. Most places make them so thin as if feta costs a million dollars. Melina's wasn't cheap with their feta. The bougasta was AMAZING. I devoured that and I'm not even gonna pretend I didn't. I will make it a point to stop by anytime I am in the area. Good luck to the owners on a cute, unique, and very GOOD phyllo bar, something Parc X was seriously lacking."
/user_details?userid=djJj85oFgpFbqZpu92OvaQ,Eleni G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I just returned from Greece and searched far and wide for good phyllo...it was surprisingly very difficult to find an offering better than Melina's tiropita and spanakopita. The rest of the menu is also marvelously delicious: the fresh and tasty Greek salads, the classic frappé ice coffee, the array of greek sweets done so masterfully with an expert nod to the greek flavourscape. If you're in Montreal, don't let your taste buds miss these delights while sitting on the patio and do some the best people watching in the city!"
/user_details?userid=T9z-1ejqPT-kGOEBYuxznA,Demetry O.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Classic tiropita and spanakopita as well as the sweet Bougatsa. Add a frappe coffee and you're all set.
/user_details?userid=V02tvvsw4EZB3wNa2FD-KQ,A E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Melina's is always such a treat! I've tried just about everything on the menu and can confidently say that ALL of the food is incredible. Not to mention, the location is killer! Great vibes in the restaurant and such an awesome team!"
/user_details?userid=0srYAm87LvDbnWT0NKm13g,Robyn P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The kind and chatty staff at Melina's make you feel instantly welcome - and help you make some well-educated choices about which of their delicious phyllo treats you'll want to take home with you or eat on the spot. The Spanakopita is a personal favourite (and it's almost always fresh from the oven), but don't rule out the Melina's special sandwich or the delicious (and huge) greek salad. Top it all off with one of their many imported greek soft drinks or an espresso and you'll be all set to tackle your afternoon."
/user_details?userid=mEo8JEkOaoX09Z2jD7Cb-w,Viviana D.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,I'm addicted to the Spanakopita! Staff super cute and the cappuccino is soo good.
/user_details?userid=hWzEicuhQjuB5ZM7CVPAIw,Melanie C.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"Whenever I'm in the Outremont area, I always make a point to stop by this cute little hole-in-the-wall: most people usually go for the spanakopita, but the prassopita is the one phyllo pastry that has my heart and soul. Take a bite and the fragrance from leek and onions are to die for.....dagnabit, I already got one this morning, but I might just pop in again before they close!"
/user_details?userid=eJvWbwv5AcNd-x-N_OjqNA,Chris H.,"Communauté-Urbaine-de-Montréal, Canada",4 star rating,"REALLY GOOD PASTRIES. This is a small, quaint shop selling a limited but very good selection of Phyllo-wrapped pastries. There are other offerings but every visit, for me, ends with my walking out of the place with several delicious pastries in my hand (I always pick-up / take-away). There's a small counter as well as outside bistro tables ... when weather permits."
/user_details?userid=XduciX-f9ONDZ-rUhs3PfQ,Sam C.,"Saratoga, CA",5 star rating,"Great Phyllo wrapped pastries.  Honestly never knew what phyllo was till I came here, but wow.. these were good.  My favorites were the Spanakopita (spinach and feta)  and Brougasta (custard sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon).  The owner is super chatty and cheerful."
/user_details?userid=3N6_8zDqMjpuYjc6LZgmfg,Raj P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Unbelievable, amazing food and great pricing.  Best Greek food I've had since Mano's Greek Taverna in Tagaytay Philippines - This is not run of the mill souvlaki or gyro you find in nearby Greek restos."
/user_details?userid=oLsAQ4gtPwiLsS0UFkDGFw,Billy S.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,What an amazing place!! What an amazing owner!! I was in Montreal for couple days and i visit Melina's and I loved it!!
/user_details?userid=pBZh2rXKaWSV-9y9adQ--w,Elise O.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I were looking for an affordable, but good place to eat, and we found exactly what we were hoping for (and more) at Melina's. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the loveliest two women- they were so friendly and genuine. We ordered the spanakopita, a Greek salad, the Melina sandwich, and two hot chocolates. They could not have been better!! The owner was raised Greek, so this was real, authentic Greek food. I have never had a better Greek salad in my life. The sandwich was absolutely amazing too! As we sat, we chatted with the owner and it was clear how passionate she is about food and this restaurant. To top it all off, the hot chocolate was delicious and everything was pretty cheap! They even waited while my boyfriend went to an atm to grab some money (they take Canadian debit and cash, but no credit) and then gave us recommendations on where to go for some great beer and bagels. Could not have had a better experience! If you're looking for great food at a great place, do not miss this!!!"
