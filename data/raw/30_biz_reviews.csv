/user_details?userid=RmnLFQF7c-kbp4qQ8mIUgg,Gloria V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,So good!!!!! I've been meaning to try this place for a couple months but it's only opened for lunch. Pretty decent pricing I got the chicken teriyaki (tori) don and it was great. The chicken was tender and crunchy and the rice was the classic sticky sushi rice. The sauces paired really well on top. The cashier was a sweet lady who recommends using spicy mayo on top. I got the points card but you have to pay an extra dollar for it. A little weird but I'll take it. This place was super busy the whole time I was there so get there early when it opens at 11:30. Definitely coming again because I want to try their Gyuu don and Chicken Katsu!
/user_details?userid=gRTJX1byUA31E0OBqfYPIw,Veronica C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Japote serves very affordable Japanese food near McGill University (a 3-minute walk from McGill) which locates in the food court of the Scotia Tower. It was a bit hard to find the first time. The food were pretty decent for the price. We tried the gyu-don and the oyako-don, both were pretty good. The service was great and the staff was friendly and welcoming! The staff recommended us which sauces to put on top of our dishes. You should check it out if you're in the area for lunch! Keep in mind that they only accept cash and that they only open on weekdays and they close at 2:30 PM."
/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"So I've had Japote on my bookmarks forever. I love little independent food court vendors! However, Japote is only open Monday-Friday and only 11:30am-2:30pm, and these days if I'm in Montreal, it's usually just for the weekend. Or I might arrive as early as a Friday evening, so I hadn't been able to try this Japanese food court vendor with an apparent cult following...until recently! I was on a weekend getaway with my mom and we decided to get into Montreal on a Friday morning. So lunch at Japote it was!So the place is in the food court inside the Scotia Tower/Tour Scotia. It's in the basement, along with Subway, Lily & Cie, and a few other vendors. It's the one with the longest lineups, lol. I got the medium #8 Katsu Don (fried breaded chicken with egg on rice). It was around $6. And my mom got the small teriyaki chicken (#3 Tori-Don). It was around $4. So I'm giving it 4 stars for being good for food court food, but it wasn't like super duper. The small was really small. Unless you just want a snack (which my mom did because she just had a smoked meat sandwich at Schwartz's like an hour earlier, lol), I would recommend at least a medium. I enjoyed my Katsu Don. The breaded and fried chicken cutlet was tasty and the egg was really soft. The white rice underneath was slightly sticky, but not mushy. I had some of my mom's teriyaki chicken and I found the sauce too sweet. However, the chicken itself was lean, like my dish, and was still good. I also got a scoop of matcha green tea ice cream for dessert ($1.50). The ice cream was really rich and creamy and full of matcha flavour. It was a tiny scoop, but just the right size for a little after meal dessert. It is pre-scooped and placed in the freezer in a bowl. I had never seen this before, but I guess if it's busy, this makes the line move faster. Service was very friendly and efficient. Definitely a good place for an inexpensive weekday lunch. I've heard so many people raving about it so I was expecting it to be mind-blowing, which it was not, but it was still excellent for the price and for the fact that it's in a food court."

Add a beverage and soup to your order for a small fee.Do not leave the line once you get your order. Walk down the line and make sure to top your dish with one of their 8 sauces.Don't know which sauce to use for what dish? They've got you covered. Each sauce is labeled with the menu item number so you are sure to select the correct sauce for your dish.You can even order a half and half plate. This includes 2 dishes from their primary menu. I ordered the chicken and beef and added the two sauces that are supposed to accompany those dishes.Man oh man this did not disappoint!It was delicious! Even the portions may look small, it is very filling.Stop by if you're in the area but make sure to go around 11:30 or past 12:30 as the line up is very long. It's composed of mostly students from the nearby universities.J'capote when I'm at Japote!"
/user_details?userid=wWHeaOS28fnCnFN1Pmo3xg,Shaan A.,"Thornhill, Vaughan, Canada",5 star rating,"4.5Yes. Just yes. This place is good. Very good. In all seriousness, it's a super authentic Japanese restaurant in the food court of the scotia plaza...though a bit hard to find at first, you definitely won't miss the line for this place. The cash only cafeteria shop boasts a quit extensive menu of at least 10-13 dishes...there's pork chicken and vegetarian options - so everyone will find something they enjoy! Came on a weekday for lunch and luckily I beat the crowd, I ordered a vegetable tempura dish...and then waited a few short minutes. Each dish comes served with steaming rice, and the veggie or meat. The rice was really really good - I got a medium which was honestly the perfect size. It was filling and satisfied me. What I love about the tempura is that it was not overly fried or engorged in batter - it was very refreshing and tasty...and don't forget to add some spicy mayo on top! The price is super super good and the food is very authentic (the owners are Japanese). All in all a great spot, just don't forget your cash!"

/user_details?userid=H2CzH8OayhuClaDUew4Oug,Hector S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Food felt like home made food, tried the pork with ginger and was goooood, like homemade food. I'll come back again to try other items in the menu.It's very affordable too, the staff is friendly, you feel like eating in a Japanese underground joint."
/user_details?userid=ZGiwU16rhGvWAYUzkWL0xw,Boz X.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Super cheap and quick lunch place in the basement of the Scotia Bank tower. Japote is a small family (food court) restaurant that serves authentic Japanese food.On the menu, there's chicken, pork, beef, eel, and vegetarian options for under 10$ after taxes -- which is hella cheap imo.I like the concept of open cuisine, where we can watch the chef/owner cook passionately and delicately assemble every plate. The food is great in general (I've tried everything on the menu), and I'm especially fond of #3 (chicken) and #0 (pork). Although I note that it's a little salty at times, so bring a water bottle or something. The best part? If you purchase a loyalty card for 1$, you get 5.00$ discounted on your next meal for every 5 meals! Sometimes I end up getting a large bowl of - my fave - Tori don (chicken rice bowl) for only $1.50...!? Where do you get 'free' food like that??Lastly, it's cash only so make sure you bring a little change heh."
/user_details?userid=ttzPfe_tLnpoI21JMYXZBA,Marie-NoÃ«l L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I totally fell in love for their food/menu back when they used to be at the Faubourgs !!! It was so good that it became my comfort food very early on and I kept going back for their Tori-Don. I don't get to go as often now, their schedule changed, they aren't open as often as they used to and I tend to get a little lost to find their new place, but the food is still just as good and their choice of sauces to complement it is so satisfying :) ... Plus the people owning the places are kind and smiling, it's a gem in the rough ! And it's very affordable, what more to ask ?!"
/user_details?userid=vLaMSGUWv7oDcshpep2iWw,Shomoita A.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Amazing food for amazing price. Normally I avoid rice dish for lunch as it makes me feel sleepy, but this one was very clean food, non-greasy and flavourful. It's a shame that I didn't know about them given that they're so close to McGill. Got my membership card for $1 to get my 5th dish free! Definitely going back again! I ordered the tori don and my boyfriend ordered a half and half of pork with ginger and beef (0 and 2) from the menu. All the dishes were so good. And I loved their sauce collection, specially the ginger one."
/user_details?userid=CUnPcNRfqs040C_9-0-a_g,Bhavyaa C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"absolutely LOVE this place and have been going for almost two years now between classes at McGill! they have amazing & friendly staff, delicious food, and super reasonable prices! I always go with #3 Large (caramelized chicken teriyaki i think?) which is a fan favourite and one of their cheapest dishes. Keep in mind that it's open from 11:30 am to 2:30 pm on weekdays only, and usually not on government holidays (you can check their facebook page to make sure). There's also usually a huge line when they open (especially during the school year at McGill!) so I recommend going a little later in their hours if possible."
/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Easily one of the best deals in downtown Montreal! As I was looking for a spot for lunch, my friend suggested me this place. Previously located in the Faubourgs on Ste-Catherine, it is now located in the food court under the Scotiabank building on Sherbrooke, right across the management building of McGill.The first thing that struck me what the super low prices. Seeing those prices, I expected a small portion. I was suprisingly surprised by what 8$ gave me: a good portion of chicken and rice and a croquette too. The taste itself reminded me a lot like homemade meals (in a positive way). There are also many different sauces by the counter and you could put in your plate to enhance the flavour.Honestly think that this is a solid alternative for cheap lunch for McGill students who are tired of eating at Super Sandwich, also very quick service when I went there around 12:30 on a weekday!"

I loved this place when I used to be in the faubourgs near Guy, now it's moved underneath the Scotiabank tower and it's still just as amazing. The potions are generous, taste is authentic, and price is so cheap!!!! Highly recommended over and over again. This place will always have a place in my (tummy) heart."
/user_details?userid=hBADi4exXG7eTd90WKwQjw,Eric L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've legitimately been here 15 times over the last 20 weekdays for my lunch break.Phenomenal taste, and very cheap for the quality of food. Usually a large fills me up decently ($6.50), but often I'm still craving the unique flavor that this place gives its food.My personal favorite is the number 4 with some spicy mayo and sweet soy sauce on top (they have lots of sauce options).The staff is EXTREMELY nice. Overall I'd give this place a 9.5/10, the 0.5 deduction because it's not open 24/7"
/user_details?userid=w7Lr5GQOAa4XhoYm18yWHA,Christie W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Authentic and fair Japanese don. The restaurant hides below the Tour Scotia near the metro McGill, and is accessible by the underground. For a big fan of Japanese don, the food, even though not the best, is quite tasty. The price is also very beautiful $6.00 after tax for a medium vege don, with a miso soup. The staff is very welcoming. I definitely will come back for lunch."

/user_details?userid=lwC7xAzMI49xDU2G2LeFaQ,M A.,"MA, MA",5 star rating,What a happy surprise to bump into this authentic and delicious place run by an efficient family group at lunch time after visiting the Museum. The menu offers three options (Small/Medium/Large) depending upon appetite size. Â In our group all choices were a great success and our only regret is that we live in the US so can only dream about returning!
/user_details?userid=HpzMECWPO4H1fJihiMG1Pg,Lanyi L.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,So good. So cheap. So friendly. Authentic Japanese food and it's delicious. They have a bunch of sauces you can choose from and they give you recommendations. I had a filling meal for $5.50 with tax. I WILL BE BACK!!!
/user_details?userid=W90xlJgPOqkwWPN1KORPOw,Andrew C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This quick eat place has been on my radar for a while. Â I want to give this a 4.6 stars! Â The food is simply delicious! Very authentic, kind of a mix between home and street cooking style. Super friendly staff! Â The only thing I want to mention is that all the pics submitted here makes the food portion looking humongous; naturally I was a bit surprised when I saw the actually portion, which is still very very good, but not as big like the photos posted here. I ordered a medium sized and wished I would have ordered large instead because it was so yummy!! Â My friend however, ordered number 80 medium and it was really really small... he wasn't as happy as I was. Â And I have to admit, his number 80 medium was more like a kids meal. So, here is my suggestion: go for the large portion!! It will be totally worth it!"
/user_details?userid=Fo7QxWwvWD609BSyFBUNng,Jill B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"McGill staff and students rejoice! Some of the best home-style Japanese food in Montreal is hiding in the basement food court of the Scotiabank building, right across from the McLennan library. Rice bowls topped with your choice of chicken, egg, eel, beef, Japanese curry, pork, and tempura vegetables are cooked to order at lightning speed. An assortment of homemade sauces sit next to the counter for you to season your dish to taste. The staff are very polite and friendly and the food is simple but spectacular. And the price? I often meet my boyfriend here for lunch and never spend more than 10$ on both of our meals -- including tip! My only complaint is that they're only open for lunch and only on weekdays because if I had my druthers, I'd be eating here on the weekends too."

/user_details?userid=ek8FY4qv4uR6VFenVdG2Qg,Tracy L.,"West Side, Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Nice small place in the food court, a bit hard to find for the first time. Food is good for the price, and it's more of a home style than restaurant-type. Line up can be very long in peak lunch hours. It's cash only which could be a bit inconvenient. Charges extra for takeout. Oyako don is really good, curry is a let down"
