Really cool place in heart of old port. Simple, quality food that I will for sure return to. Perfect to grab & go and enjoy the beautiful scenery at old port. We need more places like this!"
/user_details?userid=-r16-IkjlJzzW3gMvStU0A,Beatrice T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Had to go downtown for errands and after the recommencions of sis and bro in law we were so hyped to try this place! Service is fast, breezy, and friendly. We paid for two slices, the pepperoni and Calabrese, they heated them up, paid, and out we were to find a quiet outdoor spot to savor these New York style slices. I love place that sell by slice but this will definitely be a bit pricier at $5.99 per slice. Portions are generous and you do feel full after a slice or two. So... the not so great is maybe because it wasn't warmed up enough, by the time we walked a block and a half to eat, pizzas were near cold. So, it unfortunately took away from the taste and experience. Pepperoni was really good for flavor; peppery, a bit spicy, great covering of pepp and cheese and sauce all around. I can't fault it, it's a great slice! But.. somehow still not very exciting to us. Same with calabrese that was comforting and yummy (spicy always good in our books), but somehow still just tasted ok. Crust is nice and crisp with great bend to eat ny style (fold in half). I've always associated a NY pizza being good because in part it was so hot it darn near burns the roof of your mouth, so maybe that's just me. Those are perfect for eating on street corners of cold ny winters because they doubly act as hand warmers and belly comforters. We'll try to come back hopefully when it opens fully again and we look forward to trying them at their best! In the meantime we hope they do well and keep classing up that part of downtown!"

The slice of pizza was bigger then my face and was delicious no skimping on topping or cheese. The gnocchi was warm and tasty and had plenty of basil in the sauce which gave great flavour. The cookie was tasty but since it wasn't warm it was a little hard, but had I had some self control and gotten to a microwave I'm sure it would have slapped.With a great price and giant slice add this on your bucket list of places to eat!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Delicious new york style pizza and soda. I tried the carnivore and the vegetarian pizza. The carnivore had a lot of meat and was very flavorful. The veggie one was good but a bit too salty. I took the combo with a creamy caesar salad and the passion soda which tasted great.

/user_details?userid=iVXISIgh-unsJz57-qOHTQ,Sheryl L.,"Candiac, Canada",5 star rating,"I happen to walk by this place and the neon sign ""slice and soda"" caught my eye. I walked in and I loved everything about this place. Walking through the doors you're transported to the 90s era with the dark wood, old picture frames and pinball machine.  I'm a meat lover so my cravings were driven straight to the prosciutto pizza.  For drinks I asked the women at the register for suggestions on the ost popular soda. The women suggested the grapefruit for more of a sour taste or the apricot for if I wanted something sweeter. The prosciutto pizza cost 5$ for 1 slice and 4$ for the grapefruit soda.  The pizza slice was HUGE and delicious! I love nothing more than a place that doesn't skimp out on the toppings!The pizza is thin crust with a lot cheese prosciutto slices, cheery tomatoes and spinach cooked in a wood burning oven.  The grapefruit soda wasn't too sour just enough to make your mouth pucker and it went perfectly with the pizza.  I enjoyed the pizza so much that i ordered a whole pizza to go (30$).  When you order a whole pizza you can have half and half. I took the Carnivore and the prosciutto to go.  (Mind you the box to go is INSANELY huge to carry). I'm 5'1 and I was carrying a insanely huge box of pizza everyone was looking at me haha! I do think 30$ for a thin crust pizza but the taste is there!One thing you guys need to fix GET YOURSELVES A BATHROOM FOR  CUSTOMERS TO USE PLEASE!!!"
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"I finally tried this place this weekend, after all the great reviews I was curious to try it for myself.This place is pickup/takeout (not sit down) and they do offer delivery through door dash.  Great location in the heart of the old port and a good option for a quick bite. I had their apricot soda and a slice of pepperoni and cheese pizza. I'm not usually a soda drinker but their apricot soda was good not too sweet and fun flavour.The pizza was decent, really nice thin tasty dough but I wasn't blown away by the flavour, the cheese wasn't super tasty and the pepperoni was standard. It wasn't bad by any means and not too greasy which was nice , their sauce was tasty and I would be curious to maybe try a different slice next time instead.I found it was a touch overpriced but prices weren't over the top either especially considering the prices of other restaurants in that area. Service was good and fast as well and the location was super clean. I wouldn't discourage anyone from giving this place a try , grab and slice and eat it in the park by the water for a nice lunch in the old port on a summer day."
/user_details?userid=RwQUv7Cn61gTkPXcytSrSQ,Amy Yu T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I ordered Slice and Soda during Covid confinement, so it was delivered to me and by the time it got to me, it was already cold (by no fault of the restaurant).The thin crust was delightfully topped with pepperoni and cheese. The dough was chewy and the pizza was greasy enough to be fulfilled, but not too greasy to feel gross. The pizza was salted perfectly. Overall a satisfyingly good pizza.I'm excited for the day when I can go and enjoy the joint's decor, as the other reviews seem to rave about it."
/user_details?userid=ooHF-vRzlkyN9UEVMKocAQ,Mercedes C.,"Bronx, NY",5 star rating,"While Montréal doesn't offer gluttonous amounts pizza options in every block, Slice+Soda came through...in a cool and almost eye-opening sort of way not far from our hotel in Rue Saint-Paul. Don't be fooled by Slice+Soda's mish-mash style with a Beastie Boys mural on one wall, a motorcycle of some sort by the window and a life-size Santa that spooked the hell outta me- this place does seriously good pizza- slightly different, but for Montréal......it's good. That said, the tomato sauce was simple and free of seasonings exactly how I like it and the crust was puffy with a slight chew and crunch. Even the pepperoni and regular slices hubs ordered for himself- the cheese on it, seemed fine and wasn't drenched with it. Instead of me outright asking for a 'Vegan' slice, I asked for 'no cheese'- in hopes they understand that part better. So I tried my luck and asked the owner(?) and the manager(?) for a slice with...'no cheese'. Between talking about whether they should/shouldn't make a 'no cheese' slice amongst themselves, he asked me how many and I said two. And in case you were wondering about the menu- we went in with blinders and decided on what they're named for- so find out if there's anything else to eat as a meal other than pizza. Despite Slice+Soda's ""NYC"" vibe, the Music was awesome with a 'Chill'-esque playlist. Price? CAD$26 (less- if you do American conversion). But think about it...all 4 of our large slices, super fresh veggies on my 2 and our 2 sodas- was good. One point to mention though- a couple came in and asked someone else who wasn't initially there when we first ordered- if they make 'Vegan' slices and the guy behind the counter said ""no"". But a few things ran through my head: (1) does this place not know what 'Vegan' is? (2) does this place understand better what 'no cheese' mean? (3) or does Montréal have not gotten on the Vegan bandwagon??? I almost felt bad for the couple who left- since here I am- eating my ""no cheese"" slices. However, hubs corrected this last guy and told him I had 2 ""Vegan"" slices. The guy seemed a bit dazed and somehow made me realize they don't know what 'Vegan' is. Aside from this major hiccup and this guy- the initial folks we placed our order with were particularly friendly and made it even more of a draw. This place is new so be prepared to queue once Slice+Soda gets popping. Is it a pizza connection? I think it was...I think you guys need to pick up a thing or two about what ""Vegan"" is. But other than that...this place is a very nice addition to the pomp and circumstance Rue Saint-Paul O. strip."
/user_details?userid=iJ_sn6RfwO5unR9YgFTd4Q,Camille R.,"Côte-des-Neiges, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Great pizza. All kinds were good. My favorite was the spicy salami ! Good for a quick bite. Slices are pretty big and decent prices. 5$ for a big slice.
/user_details?userid=NAs9A-CgIIs1nYd-6Ab-ow,Michel P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Great pizza and huge slices! Most of the time I order the duo with the ceasar salad that's also surprisingly good and generous. I work in the old port and I go there about once a week.
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,My new go to pizza place! Currently we pick up from la New Yorkaise a lot and this pizza is a bit similar in the sense that they are both New York style pizzas. Both are amazing! And the pizzas are huge!!! One slice and a half was enough for me. We tried the prosciutto pizza and it was delicious! I love prosciutto and there was so much of it! They didn't cheap out. I will definitely try out their other pizzas! Highly recommend!
/user_details?userid=5HiO4RFBVtAc7EY6w2mmRg,Vanessa V.,"Côte Saint-Luc, Canada",3 star rating,"can i just say their photos are amazing on instagram? thats why we went to try their pizza. it looked like their competitor ADAMO PIZZA but let me just say it was nothing like it!! first of all the price is just crazy. 6.85 CAD$ compared to 4$ at Adamo's for a slice.  it's not juicy at all, tastes like frozen pizza (cheap ingredients) amost no cheese and no tomato sauce? it's not comparable to NYC pizza at all!"
/user_details?userid=rRKRIBTKW8IrkJsF53DonA,Ryan K.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Another great find for a slice of New York style pizza. I strolled in here while walking around Old Montreal. I was hoping for a slice of pepperoni pizza, but the people in front of me took the last slice. Oh well! So I went for a slice of boconccini and basil. Really good thin crust, fresh, and tasty. And while I was ordering, they had a sign showing they sell gnocchi too. Couldn't resist, and I'm glad I didn't! Don't know if it'll part of their permanent menu, but I highly recommend it while they have it."

Unfortunately I cannot comment on the pizza since it had to be thrown out, will not be going back."
/user_details?userid=akNTT3ekmo4yj98J9Hk0aQ,Crewe D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If you are looking for a quick bite in the old port, it is really your only option! Inexpensive and has a bunch of Italian groceries if you are looking for something a little different to eat on the side."
/user_details?userid=KWd-M--zHq-GXVI-XBCIkA,Igor K.,"Queens, NY",3 star rating,The pizza there is awesome. It's thin crust and reminds me of NYC pizza. However the service sucks. Asked the guy a question and his answers and remarks were awful. Needs a class in customer service
/user_details?userid=tnkBQzsRTt3gXvXqG2eURg,John R K.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Slice + Soda is a welcome addition to Old Montreal so I was anxious to check it out shortly after it opened.My first experience wasn't great. I noticed that a cloth on the edge of one of the trays of pizza in the display case was partially touching the pizza. Gross. When I pointed it out to the server and asked that I don't get THAT slice, she rolled her eyes and said nothing. I returned recently to give Slice + Soda a second chance. This time there was a young man behind the counter who was much more friendly and polite (and spoke English). The pizza slices are quite large and the toppings are good. I like that the slices are not drowning in tomato sauce (there's just enough). The homemade sodas are just alright and probably not worth what you pay. Order a bottle of Coke instead.The place itself is cool with communal seating in the middle and stools at counters in the windows. This is a great place to stop by for a quick bite."
/user_details?userid=IAnv_53Q0S3IajNWZ4U7-w,GrubbinWithGes M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If only this place was closer to me because the pizza will definitely fill that craving. The ambience going into this resto was fun 90s rendition with old school Missy playing on tv alongside a pinball machine and an incredible mural. My eyes directly went to the cook in the back who you can see making the pizza himself and I love that. I had the Calabrese slice (and it's a VERY generous slice) because I do like a spicy salami and it did not disappoint. I tried their infamous apricot soda and it was a definite hit. I plan on going back 100% Only reason for my 4 stars is that I wish they had better seating arrangements (it's small and the center of the resto is 1 big Table to share with others), however, I do get the concept of getting a slice and walking out."
/user_details?userid=UTM_Lz1RPlZ7pqz8i-i47w,Tim C.,"Temecula, CA",5 star rating,Happen to come across this place by accident.  Daughter was hungry and we were trying to get out of the rain.  Some of the BEST pizza Ive had in a VERY long time.  We ordered another slice.  Just hung out in the shop watching the raining and listening to 90s hip hop.  It was so good. We drove back the following nice and got 4 slices to go
/user_details?userid=KiAnPohnbVZ3pWWe-U_tww,Hannah M.,"Manassas, VA",5 star rating,My family and I have been looking for a good pizza place since we got to Canada because we have seen so many. I'm so glad we decided to stop into Slice & Soda for a quick meal. The prices are very reasonable for the size of the slice you get. The veggie pizza and prosciutto pizza were delectable. The crust was thin but had the perfect crunch and the toppings had so much flavor. Their homemade soda is very good too. I am tempted to go back for dinner tonight!
