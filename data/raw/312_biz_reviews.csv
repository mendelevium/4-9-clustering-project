MeiWei is a small dumpling restaurant in NDG/Westmount run by a cute Chinese family. The wife takes the orders and the husband cooks / brings out food. The service is great and they are very nice. The resto is clean unlike a lot of dumpling places in Montreal. But most importantly, the dumplings are delicious! I got 1/2 fried, 1/2 steamed lamb & coriander (sooo good) and my sis got steamed 1/2 beef curry, 1/2 veggie. The veggie was kinda boring compared to the flavour bombs from the meat ones. Will 100% go back and order these delicious morcels of heaven again. The best part? There's a whole other part of the menu to discover, with yummy sounding appetizers!"

Tried the spring rolls , steamed beef curry dumplings and the boiled lamb coriander dumplings. Overall, dumplings were quite good (freshly made and had nice texture) but personally, I found that they lacked a little in flavour compared to other dumpling joints in Montreal."

Very quick and friendly service !!I tasted; lamb-cumim and shrimp scallops pork. Took plain shrimp to steam homeGood seasoning and fresh ingredients. The dough is the traditional slightly more ""al dente"" compared to the cantonese style which rice starch to soften the dough and make it more trans lucid.  I prefer the al dente dough but the filling was was crumbling instead of remaining  firmer more like a meatball. But overall they deserve a thumbs up as they are trying hard and i am sure they eiil one of the top dumpling house in Montréal"

Decided on one order of curry chicken dumplings. They turned out to be very good, even after eating them 20-25 minutes after receiving them. They have a nice selection of dumplings, with a few other menu items as well. Can't wait to come back to try more. The restaurant itself is a nice little place. They even have a few tables on a terrace. The owners (I'm assuming they were the owners) were really friendly. I will definitely return for more."
/user_details?userid=vj-gGhmf8zw4FJiJ4oWGjQ,Beantpreet K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Yummy dumplings alert!! Ordered curry chicken and beef onion dumplings from here for the first time. I always eat vegetarian dumplings because I don't like the way the meat in dumplings tastes. But I decided to try chicken dumplings this time. Result:  no regrets. Loved the curry chicken dumplings. And my husband enjoyed the beef dumplings. It's a bit far from where I live so I don't think I would go to the restaurant. So I am really happy they're available on UberEats! Already raved about it to my friends.

/user_details?userid=5Ft9idBxDU-f1Fyz__4zVw,Brian H.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Ordered the peanut butter dumplings, pork and chives dumplings and the crispy pork with katsu sauce.Unfortunately the pork and chives dumplings tasted no different from the type you can buy from a grocery store, from the taste of the ingredients inside to the exact thickness of the dumpling skin.The pork with katsu was underwhelming - the pork tasted like it had been placed in a microwave to be defrosted.The peanut butter dumplings were the best part of the meal, even if the sauce was very watery.All in all a disappointing experience."
/user_details?userid=94QoUiuwl4dtBsBG5E6pUA,danielle c.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Update: also, BEST wonton soup ever. Not your run of the mill wonton soup at all. Super delicate and fresh broth and wontons. The large size includes noodles--it's perfect soup for the cold weather. Add some of the chili sauce--so good. Veggie dumplings (got the tofu mushroom) are also the tastiest vegetarian dumplings I've had in Montreal. Hot teas are also excellent. This place has it all--outstanding food, service, and atmosphere."

Vegetarian and pescatarian options abound. The seaweed salad with garlic and vinegar was just what the doctor asked for on a cold winters' day. Service with a smile. Two thumbs up!"
