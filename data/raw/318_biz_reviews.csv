They take obvious pride in personal service, as shown to newbies (my wife & I) and to several regulars in this friendly, unpretentious place.Panzzerrottis were a delightful first course, with the lightest, flaky shell you could hope for. They accommodated my wife's gluten free needs easily and deliciously, so bring your GF appetite here!Pasta and sauces were all first-rate, so I heartily recommend for an enjoyable dinner. BYOW since no liquor sold here."

This is one of the hidden gems in the area and I'm sad it's so far from what I live/work! Cute little resto with a small fantastic menu that'll can make you as happy as you ever possibly be... if you're a foodie like me!A panzerotto (also known as panzarotto) and thus in plural panzerotti!.... is a turnover which resembles a small calzone in both shape and in the dough used for its preparation. They're fried however instead of being baked. So expect some fast greasy goodness stuffed with the goods to come your way quickly!They have a nice selection of them and I REALLY loved their Philly! With a side Caesar salad you can have a great lunch for less than $15. What a deal. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Owner is a sweetheart asking about you like your food. 5 stars is easy and I'll be back for sure!!!

The food is outstanding. I love how this place embraces the neighborhood vibe. Can't wait to come again.

A great little Italian gem with fantastic friendly staff and food to die for. The Panzzerotti is fantastic and the salads were tasty and fresh. My 3 kids loved it so much we had to eat there twice during our 3 day visit, and they wanted pictures with the chef! My son couldn't get enough of the ""stretchy cheese"" and ate more than I've ever seen him eat. Would highly recommend it for a special night or just a fun time with friends or family. Bring your own wine."

Â Turns out I was parked right in front of this little restaurant...Panzzerotti. So I called to get a pickup order (don't judge me, I was feeling lazy). As soon as I walked in I was greated by the waiter and the owner with smiles and a very warm welcome. They inquired how I had heard of the place and told them about Yelp and a picture on there that looked pretty yummy. The owner asked if I've had a Panzzerotti before. To wich I replied ""Only cheap ones at Pizza Pizza"". She looked at me with a big smile and said ""Oh. This is very different. I put my heart and soul in these"". I thought that was very cute and made me smile. Gotta love someone passionate about their cooking. Now for the actual review of the restaurant and food. The place is really cute and well decorated. Very convivial for groups or family and you may bring your own wine. I ordered the Pepperoni and cheese Panzzerotti. The crust is amazing. Light and crunchy, perfection. The cheese was gooey and the pepperoni was high quality although a little bit more would've been better. I looooooved and was craving another one soon after. (I should've bought 2 )So if you live in this area or just passing by. Make sure to drop in and try it. You will not be disappointed. And note to the owners....Bravo for such welcoming customer service and the food is AMAZING!"

The menu is not big but the food is delicious. They usually bring free appetizers to the table. We received a beet salad, 3 small slices of homemade pizza, 3 mozzarella sticks, bruschetta and olives. The staff is courteous and polite. I totally recommend it if you're in the neighborhood. It's also a bring your own wine place!"
