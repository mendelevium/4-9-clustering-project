/user_details?userid=MWCPUFk-fnNXehPosCtwHA,Geneviève F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The quality of most sushi was 5/5, but some pieces we got were disappointing and the portion size is very small for the price. I wish they would give us / let us buy at least extra rice so that we aren't left still hungry by the end of a 100$ meal/person. THE GOODThe best sashimi I've eaten in Montreal! (except the salmon, more on that below) The quality and range of fish available is simply wonderful. The Otoro is amazing. Beautiful presentation. I am convinced that my exploring the (pricey) menu, I would find the perfect line-up of fish to order for it to be a 5-star meal. Unfortunately...THE DISAPPOINTING It seems we got 'bad cuts' of the salmon (tip of the fish) so they were presented in 'round shapes' instead of regular. Clearly they knew this cut was different as it was even presented different. Those 4 salmon sashimi pieces were unfortunately not very good and chewy. The lobster rolls weren't very tasty. It's a shame. I wish it had given me the 5-star experience I know it can reach. Plz give/sell a little rice/filler :)"
/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Having tried several well rated sushi joints in the last 8 months, I had nearly given up my quest for good sushi in Montreal. Well, I'm always on the lookout anyway, and last night my wife and her sister wanted to meet up after work on Peel Street. A quick Yelp! search guided me to Ryu for the first time. It won't be my last!Walking in, the long and fairly narrow space is dominated by a beautiful bar area. They have some cool house music playing that sets a modern vibe. The music is a little too loud at the bar but seemed about right at the table we were seated by up front. We were warmly greeted and had someone check our coats within seconds of entering. Settling in with the menu, we were searching for some selections that had cooked seafood and our waiter was quick to point out several options for the girls. They ended up with edamame, some kind of crab and cooked salmon roll, cooked shrimp Nigiri, and an eel roll. I prefer Nigiri and opted for Hamachi, Salmon, Scallop, and O-Toro, all of which were excellent.Service was excellent and we really enjoyed our visit. So much so that we've already made our next reservation for this weekend!"
/user_details?userid=SMkOnEZkfHPdCUmQM2Qn8g,Cindy T.,"Brampton, Canada",2 star rating,"Sigh, I am a bit conflicted with what to rate this place. The food was delicious, all the sushi tasted very fresh and tender. Despite enjoying the food, a couple factors regarding service completely underwhelmed my experience:First, BRO ... tell me why the portions are SO SMALL and the price point SO BIG? At all ""classier"" sushi restaurants I've been to have ALWAYS offered ginormous special maki rolls but the portions at Ryu is just sad. The sushi rolls are as small as the rolls at AYCE sushi restaurants.. so you're telling me I am paying almost $15-$20 for 6 tiny sushi maki rolls. The ""special"" ingredients to the small sushi rolls are not worth the price regardless, I find it rather ridiculous really. Ryu is WYLIN'. I have never felt so ripped off in a sushi restaurant LMFAO! Second, the service is slow. Like, HELLA SLOW. I'm very easy-going and often don't mind waiting for my food, but it was just so ridiculously and noticeably slow. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that it was just super packed and they were backed up with orders. Though I've been to plenty of busy restaurants and never had to wait this long for my food, even when we were given notice that there would be a wait. My friends and I had all the time in the world, but when you are a group of 5 eating one dish every 20 minutes (most dish is basically 1-2 pieces per person), it doesn't even seem like a proper dinner anymore.. more like us grabbing snacks. The entire meal didn't even touch our stomachs because the portions were so small and the wait periods between each dish were so long.. we had to grab something elsewhere following our dinner at Ryu to satisfy our hunger. Expensive night and we were still as hungry leaving Ryu when we entered.. does that seem worth it even if the food was good? A positive note though, our server did provide very helpful recommendations with the menu and our tables were cleared quickly by another worker. Other than that, service was nothing out of the ordinary. Our server wasn't as enthusiastic as you'd expect servers to be though and for a restaurant with such high prices and classy atmosphere I'd expect him to be. But with the lack of notice/apology for the slow service we received, I wasn't really surprised. Combining these two factors together with 5 hungry people doesn't make for a pleasant experience. I somewhat understand if they were so backed up with food orders, but they should take some responsibility for it and inform their paying customers. I've worked in the industry for a few years and one very important lesson I learned that I think Ryu needs to consider for the future: Good service will almost always make up for bad food... but bad service will never make up for good food. This describes my experience at Ryu perfectly.. no matter how good the food was, my friends and I just couldn't bring ourselves to enjoy our food in its entirety because of the service. If you are willing to wait and aren't too hungry, Ryu would be a good choice.. if you don't mind spending big bucks either. All in all, definitely not on my list of restaurants to return to when I'm in the area."

We ordered five rolls between the two of us, a couple glasses of Riesling, a mojito, edamame, and their take on a s'mores for dessert. Everything was wonderful. We were seated right away. The restaurant is beautiful and the decor is really unique. Great value for what we got! ($150 before tip for 3 glasses of wine, a mojito, edamame, three basic rolls, two specialty rolls, and dessert.) Go to Ryu!! You won't be disappointed."

/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Overpriced sushi. We had the nigiri set with 12 nigiri for 44$, the salmon truffle roll and the hamachi baby roll. When you get charged almost 4$ for a piece of nigiri, you would expect the fish to be at least bigger than the ones at all you can eat sushi restaurants. The fish slices were very small and thin and definitely not worth its price. Some of them tasted very bland and didn't have the fresh sweet taste of fish. The hamachi baby roll was okay, but the jalapeno on top didnt blend well with the rest of the roll. The salmon truffle roll however was absolutely delicious. The salmon was torched perfectly and the truffle taste was subtle enough. I would give my 2 stars just for that roll. The total after tax and tips was 104$ for 2 people. I was ready to pay more money for this meal since it was for my friend's bday, so the price wasn't really an issue but I was really disappointed that the quality didn't match the price. As for the place itself, it's small and if you don't get a place at the bar, they have these awkward benches on the wall where everyone eats facing the same way. The service was quick for us. The restaurant doesn't have a toilet so you need to go inside the building and go up a floor where you can find a kind of creepy washroom down the dark hallway. Would I go back? Definitely not. Especially when I know that I can find better quality sushi for the same price."

Just got ripped off from over priced mediocre  sushi.  I could've gone to the takeout sushi in the same neighborhood and it may have been same or better.Decor -  looks good until you look at the unfinished walls.  Industrial?  At least patch the holes.Service - it's average, because if server was going to ask how's the food, I could have told him.  They were also getting rest to close after lunch.  Food - if you are a sushi lover like me...you know what is good sushi and not.Got the 6pc mixed sashimi for $19 (I think).  The cuts were thin and broken.  And why the heck they torch my tuna and salmon.  As I leave the restaurant, I saw pre-slice sashimi in counter case, no wonder.  Good Sashimi should be at least quarter inch thick and shaped like triangle or rectangle.Got a Special Salmon maki, all mushroom inside, with small pieces of salmon on top once cut (It's like 3 slice of salmon for a 12 piece roll) Got the Uni maki (2 piece).  Why the heck they put brown sauce top....again SIGH...lucky uni was fresh and they're not trying to hide something.  Got a poke roll and the salmon are not cut in chunks, rather broken or smash somehow, why?  Keep it fresh.Also, took a while to get our dishes tooAnd $12 can of SapporoI miss my Sushi from the states.  This place is a tourist trap."
/user_details?userid=a4O0mK_qg7VBe2n0doOxeg,Valerie L.,"Houston, TX",5 star rating,"Fantastic sushi spot. The shop itself is fairly small but it is super cute and clean. I'm from Houston where there is an abundance of sushi restaurants so I was fairly skeptical about sushi in Montreal. Thankfully I was not disappointed.  Everything at Ryu tasted fresh. My favorites are the salmon tataki, wagyu nigiri, O-toro handroll (super buttery), ryu shrimp nigiri, and one of their specialty rolls with hamachi. I can't remember what it was called but it was recommended by the Manager and is apparently not listed on the menu. Thankfully I have photos attached below! Definitely worth stopping by if you're in the area with a sushi craving. Don't settle for the other sushi restaurants! One thing to keep in mind is yelp says they are open all day but they actually close from 3:30-5pm."
/user_details?userid=c4lTZbA8NeZBgB1YYB6Izg,Julie C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I went to Ryú for lunch this week. I've heard lots of great things about the place so I was excited to give it a try. My friend and I had the lunch combo C and D with an extra order of unagi sushi(2 pcs). The miso soup was really tasty and the complimentary edamame was a nice touch. The food itself was pretty good and fresh though not mind blowing and portions were small considering the price. We also had a glass of wine each and I believe the bill came to be over $100 which is kind of hefty for a quick "" lunch combo "" meal.Verdict: good food, good service, okay pricing, would probably come back but it wouldn't be my first choice for food in this area."

Service pretty slow from the preparing part. The waiter was very amiable but when asked question about portion or recommendation, he seemed clueless. I got the California Maki; it's very small portion. I did ask the waiter about portion and if it would enough for lunch. He said he thinks so; I guess he thought I was too big, I must not eat too much... . The dish was good but not enough; and I didn't feel to order more since the prep time takes so long (30 minutes for my tiny dish). My dish came about 20$ (tax and tips included), which was very steep. After I left, I just picked a latte to fill the rest of of my hunger."

/user_details?userid=3FrXYUTywEhmO8rTMq18XA,John J.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I feel weird calling a chain my favourite sushi place in Montreal. I haven't tried any of the other Ryu's but this particular store make great sushi. In particular, the nigiri is excellent. I highly recommend the omakase. This is where I find it superior to places like Park. The fish is fresh, tasty and has a very clean flavour.Whilst the rolls are pretty good, they're on the small side. Ryu is definitely relatively pricey for the amount you get but it's definitely quality over quantity. Also big ups to the new location. The old one while cute was very cramped and awkward if you weren't sitting at the bar.Service ranges from acceptable to excellent. They also have A4 Wagyu and Sea Urchin (both pricey). With the price, it's definitely more of a treat yourself place."

We had to wait 10 min for the sushi which is fine, since it means we get freshly made stuff. When we got home my sin loved it ate 11 pices. I also loved it. I got a very basic veggy ones but the rice was perfect, the soy beans were excellente, the only down side is that we got only one soy sauce serving for 32 pieces of sushi! They gave enough wasabi, enough ginger so are you so cheap on the soy sauce?"

White Dragon and then Hamachi Baby maki.  Great balance of sweet and spicy. The Hamachi Baby has some serious heat from the fresh slice of Jalapeno.

/user_details?userid=1Bljt-GngRP4XxkQFLnHHQ,Rod M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"After coming across Ryú on yelp it has quickly become my favorite sushi spot in town. The restaurant is quite small and not the best spot for a larger group, but the sushi is excellent. The menus is relatively short and simple but the quality of the fish is second to none. Everything that I've tried, and I've now had the chance to cover most of the menu, has been very good. The fish is fresh, the dishes are well prepared and the presentation is very nice. If you choose to do take out everything comes in these nice cardboard boxes which separate the different rolls and prevents everything from getting smushed or falling apart. I think the boxes are brilliant! Not only does their packaging work really well it is all recyclable or compostable. All the fish served at Ryú is certified as sustainably caught or responsibly farmed which is a terrific initiative in my mind. The menu is pretty concise so it is hard to pick out the key/best items. Honestly, I've enjoyed everything that I've order and haven't been disappointed by anything. Even better Ryú is in the process of opening a new location on the corner of Greene and Ste Catherine which is two minutes from my office. Yippee!"
/user_details?userid=5lT1GxGTIArrYbZGazAm-A,Ida K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The restaurant is very small and is great for a peaceful lunch break and perhaps not ideal for a fri. night get together with friends. BUT what matters the most is that they have outstanding sushi compared to what is available in Montreal. I got lunch here today and tried a few nigiri and a couple of rolls and found everything quite satisfying. The fish is excellent and they come from responsible/sustainable resources. The  sushi pieces come at the perfect size with a beautiful mixture of flavors each -  yup! I've found my new fav sushi place in town. They have 3diff desserts, premade and displayed in the fridge next to the entrance door. The dessert containers have labels that clearly list all the ingredients, a blessing for anyone with any kind of food  allergy. I tried the matcha and thought it was fresh, smooth and well balanced. I'll try the chocolate one next time.Ryu is definitely on the pricy side, particularly if you used to live in Vancouver.... But if you are in Montreal and are craving great nigiri and sushi roll with fresh fish that melts in your mouth, this might just be the place you are looking for :)"

/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I recommend this restaurant if you are downtown and want to pick up some good affordable sushi. The only thing is that I wish it was more of a sit down restaurant. My friend took me out here for my birthday and I felt the tables were very small and we had to sit side by side because the restaurant is set up that way.  All they have is wine, sake and beer. The waitress said they would come up with a cocktail menu soon. We ordered the Dinner menu #2 which was only $30 and then added another sashimi and two sushi rolls. First we had the edamame and it was good! They were salted and had sesame seeds and I think even sesame oil. I will definitely try to recreate it at home if I buy frozen edamames. The salmon sashimi was not what I expected. It's not your typical pieces of sashimi. It was more of a tataki. The ""sashimi"" were thin slices and it was in a sauce. We also added the Hamachi Jalapeno (Yellowtail) sashimi. The jalapeno was spicy and really added a kick to the sashimi! Both sashimi were good and fresh but the hamachi was probably my favorite because of the jalapeno. I love spicy but for people who don't stay away from this sashimi. Then we had three different types of nigiri (the striped bass, the albacore, and salmon). They gave two of each type of nigiri. We had the Ryu Rainbow which is made of tuna, salmon, cucumber, wakame (seaweed), tempura, soy paper, rice paper, spicy mayo, and basil mayo . We also ordered the Bio Salmon which is made of salmon tartare, torched salmon, nori, and spicy mayo. Both were good but I preferred the Ryu Rainbow if I had to pick one. The only downside was that the sushi would stick to the plate so it was hard to pick up with chopsticks. The Bio Salmon has little cut up lemon on top and I preferred it the sushi without it.  I was going to give this restaurant 4 stars but as I'm writing this review I just now realized that we never got our Toro Cut Roll (4 pieces) and the Hamachi Cut Roll (4 pieces) that is supposed to come with the dinner menu!! I had asked the waitress if there was more sushi coming and she had said no!!  They had taken back the menu so I did not question her and I did not check! Damn that's 8 pieces of sushi that we never got!! Not cool!!!"
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Unfortunately my second time here wasn't so great. My first review was based on a lunch chef's choice. So for my birthday, I went in for a sit down lunch. To my surprise, their combo menu changed and both lunch and diner combo are the same (including the prices). So I opted for combo 2 with an order of o-toro and a Cajun tuna roll. This place is pricier then the regular sushi restaurant without being at JunI or Park. Because of that, I was expecting more then what I had. The nigiri just fell apart when I would pick it up, with chopsticks or my fingers. The rolls were quite small and uneven. Plus, I was expecting more freshness from the fishes. The only thing I really enjoyed was the seaweed salad. It was quite good! What I liked the least was paying 15$ + taxes for two o-toro nigiri that fell apart on me. Just at under 100$ (with a 12$ glass of Pinot) for a birthday lunch, this was very disappointing to say the least. Next year's birthday lunch will definitely be elsewhere."

Super fresh and extremely tasty fish and they are small portions, yes, but quality over quantity.The menu is not a huge selection but will appeal to most sushi appetites and tastes.And yes it is expensive but if you want good fresh sushi and a unique experience then this is for you.The place was packed when I got there for lunch and went off for 25mins shopping accords the street and a seat at the bar opened up. Nobody seemed to mind the prices so they all must have been there before.Service was attentive and service was fast for being so busy.If you are taking clients for dinner then you certainly can impress them with the quality and unique menu but be wary it will be a big bill at the end.The place lived up to some of the good reviews and worth visiting again."
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Ryú on Peel has now been open for 8 weeks, and its business seems to be booming.This location is a more upscale version of its stores at Carrefour Laval or the airport. No more siracha bottles on the tables or sushi burritos on the menu! The place can accomodate about 20 guests at a time, which is reasonable considering that they only have two employees working the room and two chefs behind the counter. The place is small, but clean and modern, with pale wooden tables and well-placed faux plants. The logo of the restaurant, which is also its name, represents the kanji for ""dragon"" - it shines over the patrons, basking the room in a gentle red neon light. The framed logo of Supreme is on a wall, and select 90's pop and hip hop hits are playing.We liked the restaurant as soon as we walked in. The head waiter, whose witty professionalism was inflaillible throughout the evening, welcomed us. We chose to sit at the benches by the wall, and peered at the menus. The items were mostly traditional - nigiris and sashimis designed to let the fish shine. Since it was our first visit, we decided on the omakase (the chef's selection) numbers 2 and 4, as recommended by the waiter. Not long after, we were presented with edamame as snack. The beans were salted, and mixed with sesame oil and sesame seeds. Although a bit salty, these turned out to be the main entertainment during the widely variable waiting time between dishes. I asked for the bathroom to wash my hands, and  was given quite long, but precise directions: you go out of the back door, turn left, turn right to find the elevators, ride to the first floor, and continue straight ahead to find the loos. Ryú is a tenant in a rather upscale, fashion-oriented building, but since it was the weekend and the building was not active, this trip turned out a bit creepy. The first floor was dimly lit, with empty locals peering through papered windows. The women's bathroom was dark, and I patted the walls to find the light switch. To my horror, one of the two stalls was a complete mess, the toilet filled with the most disgusting... anyways. I closed the light, turned and left quickly.Back to the restaurant, the first dish, salmon tataki, had come. The outer layer of the salmon had been slightly cooked, and the perfectly cut, thin slices looked delicious. The tataki was bathing in a slightly sweetened vinegar that gave the meat a little kick. There were five pieces, which we devoured in no time. A little later came three nigiris: salmon, red tuna and albacore. After a rather long wait, we then received the rest of our order almost at the same time. The Rainbow Ryú maki and Tuna Poke maki stood out from the bunch in appearance and taste, with the Rainbow maki being the most interesting, with basil in its flavor profile. The bill for two came up to about 70$, which is in my opinion rather expensive for the quantity of food offered. ""À la carte'' orders might be worth a shot, but they probably won't be any cheaper. The cost is likely related to their strict use of sustainably-sourced, and when possible, local products. If you take a look at their website, you can find more details on their commitment to the environment and charitable organizations.It was a good and pleasant meal, without any kind of surprise. Although at first Ryú reminded me of Saint Sushi because of its music, dynamic team and urban vibes, it turned out completely different. There's no funky creations here, and the makis are much smaller."

The tuna tataki is about a third of what you'll expect, and the rolls are tiny comparatively to other restaurants. The wait staff was incredibly more interested in chatting at the bar with each other than doing things. Asked for the bill, it was brought over, and then we were left waiting for fifteen minutes. In short, just go somewhere else unless you want to drop $100 on some appetizers and then go have dinner elsewhere."

Edamame were too salty for my taste as they were seasoned with soy sauce, black and white sesame and sesame oil(?). The Ryu rainbow makis were good but I only wish that it had more fish in the middle. They were interesting with the little drop of basil mayo on top but the fish was scarce.. even the salmon sashimi was cut too thinly so it didn't have the mouthfeel that I enjoy. The spicy salmon rolls weren't spicy at all.. not enough sriracha? The rest were adequate but nothing special that would make me come back. Only positive thing that I can think of is the sushi rice which was seasoned properly.Maybe the other items in their menu are far better and worth a try but at that price.. be prepared to splurge a little compared to the other sushi places downtown because of their use of sustainable fish and modern minimalist decor."

The place is not good for bring kids what so ever, so don't do the same mistake as I do and bring a toddler. Strongly avoid doing that.

The whole meal came down to around 35 bucks each person. For this price we were expecting a bigger portion and a higher quality of food but unfortuntely it was a bit disappointing. As you could see the portion of the $26 worth combo in the pic, neither of us was filled after the meal.Food wise, it was our first time here and Ryu rainbow roll was the best overall. recommend ^This restaurant also has an odd table setup - my friend and I were sitting right next to each other facing the same side.

Not really ideal for groups or lounging more like a fancy upscale sushi bar/shop. I had the miso for an appetizer and then the sashimi platter. The speciality rolls also look very good. The price is steep but it's good sushi and sustainable fish.
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"After seeing and hearing so much hype about this restaurant, I finally stopped by for a quick lunch last week and I am honestly still unsure of what the big deal is with this place. First off, as cute as the interior design is here, the seating is pretty annoying - tight with everyone facing the counter (so you're sitting next to whoever you came here with rather than in front of them). Second of all, the price is a bit much for what you get. I ordered the lunch special #3 + a dessert and somehow ended up paying close to $40 for lunch. Third of all, and probably most important of the three, the sushi is seriously nothing special at all. Yes, the fish is fresh, but the food is borderline bland here which is a shame. The dessert on the other than was delicious (I had a chocolate peanut butter mason jar of deliciousness). With so many amazing sushi restaurants in Montreal, this is not one that I'll be returning to."
/user_details?userid=I1j4x5jie4VKuksHGhkfnA,Rein C.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,Very hip Japanese restaurant in downtown Montreal. Lovely decor and great food. Staff is very friendly. Super fresh fish and uni. Get the uni wagyu nigiri it's amazing! They have some great desserts like matcha tiramisu served in cute glass jars
/user_details?userid=_VCbPhqHhvNf_GoLbLD7WA,Jimmy S.,"Twinsburg, OH",3 star rating,"Great little sushi place in downtown Montreal.  Very small and intimate interior, without feeling cramped.We ordered two of the dinner omakase options, #1 and #4.  Something to note, because it's not specifically mentioned on the menu, omakase #3 is for 2 people, not an individual.The sushi was very good, but nothing unique, and we were both satisfied. Technically, Ryú's ""omakase"", isn't true omakase, which usually involves the chef crafting several courses tailored to your tastes and what you like.  Ryú's version is more akin to a dinner combo.  But still very good."

Saturday night, we were one of two other patrons on a Saturday night (we were eating really late near closing time), and we had the full attention of the amazing staff. The sushi itself is really fresh and buttery. They were also able to accommodate a custom roll request, which they knocked out of the park. We also got a complimentary glass of wine due to a transitional time for them (they weren't serving a full bar at the time), which was the cherry on top to an already amazing experience. I highly recommend this place!"
/user_details?userid=RZGVBegkU_946fuXg6w4xw,Jerry F.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"I have been to sushi places ranges from $10-Chinese to high ends like Miku, Yasu, Jabistro. Worst experience ever.Service: 50 min before any food AND drink (tea) came. My table was empty before then. The server then tried to calm us with a complimentary edamame, which, like another commented, was cold and didnt taste good.Food: nigiri prices were as high as top places in Toronto, but the fish were very average and sushi poorly made / presented. The rolls are like the ones you would find in supermarket. My friend did not want to finish them because the fish smelled. And how dear they called that beef slice wagyu...TLDR: overpriced below-average sushi with very slow service."
/user_details?userid=cAlVYX6hjZoaAv2RxVM4Ig,Peter M.,"Repentigny, Canada",4 star rating,Walked by and heard about Ryu sushi so ima give it a try. Turns out it's really good sushi is above average price is more also but your downtown so it's obvious
/user_details?userid=QMeZrGPwIbQL8nKYOjhsrA,Claudia C.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Pretty good sushi for Montreal standards! I got the salmon roll and the wasabi scallop roll. I would probably get the salmon roll again. The wasabi scallop roll was a bit pricy for what it was: small and couldn't really taste the wasabi. I sat at the bar with my friend. The workers were super friendly. They gave me a hot towel (to wash my hands) before the food came out! The set up of the restaurant is meant for a quick bite. There is also an fridge hidden in the front where you can buy pre-made sushi and drinks. I feel that if you were just peeping into the restaurant, you wouldn't be able to see the fridge. The food came our relatively slow, however; I think it's going to improve, considering that it's a new restaurant."

Cozy little place, only counter and a bench with small tables. So if you ask for a table for 2, you actually seat beside each other instead of in front. Nice service and nice ambiance!"
/user_details?userid=4AXFk3I2vnWFp9vnHLGbHw,Tansy R.,"East Rutherford, NJ",3 star rating,Tuna poke and salmon tataki were good. Edamame was served cold which I didn't like. Food was good overall but was expensive for the quantity & quality.
/user_details?userid=6R34X3AGLkDigsmutDZnEw,Vynam N.,"Edmonton, Canada",5 star rating,Loved it here.  We looked for a place to just sit and have a snack and a drink and stumbled upon this place.  The supreme framed logo made me already feel like they are in the know for urban culture and the sushi was top notch. Initially we came for a snack but I'm going to eat as much as I can before heading back to Alberta but I would highly recommend this place to any sushi lover.
/user_details?userid=5ca2MkCJFAMafDrRxLMlXQ,Ash L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I like the atmosphere of this little restaurant. I tried the Ryu pokebowl twice to-go since it's so close to my office. It's a good recipe, sophisticated execution and very healthy (not overly salty), but I feel like the fish here (tuna and salmon) is simply not great enough to appreciate minimalist seasoning, and as a result Im less intrigued to come back for the sushi, but maybe some cooked dishes"
/user_details?userid=WbnYGH4JhNrmNe52oFm_bw,Michelle K.,"Arcadia, CA",3 star rating,"The food isn't the most fabulous or the worst. I had the Jack Sparrow which I'd hope to enjoy a lot more due to the price. The quality of the fish is good but the combination just didn't do it for me. I also had the Baby Hamachi which was small but again good quality, the red chili pepper slice threw me off. Probably a little overpriced for the value. Maybe people come for the ambiance."
/user_details?userid=qIFHATFDM67R2xuPhmzPQA,Anna Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,Cute spot for sushi! Love the outdoor seating situation on Peel street. Spicy scallop roll was delish!
/user_details?userid=2RNmvMFZmy9mcy7pZ8Helw,Patrick Y.,"Brea, CA",5 star rating,"Small, modern Japanese restaurant with great sashimi and unique poke bowl! Sashimi was really fresh and delicious. The poke was not your usual rice bowl that's drenched with ponzu sauce but more dry and delicate taste. The dessert was disappointing. Very small place so you will probably have to book ahead during peak hours."

The food was OK. Not the sort of place for an intimate dinner. Tables are like desks facing towards the bar. This is probably a good place for a quick lunch if you're in the area."

We were all very pleased with our sushi and Sashimi. Service was very friendly but unfortunately a bit slow. The great food more than made for the slow service!
/user_details?userid=Vknk1r0RDo59NhjBPdcH9Q,Sarah C.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,"PHENOMENAL! My boyfriend and I were in Montreal for the Grand Prix weekend and decided to walk along Peel street on our last night and find a place to enjoy a nice meal. We walked by RYU which had a stunning patio assembled and was playing awesome music. We ordered edamame which was incredibly seasoned and dined on four rolls (8 pieces each) - Hamachi baby, White Miso, Salmon Truffle, and Halibut. This sushi was so incredibly flavourful, fresh, and innovative. Our server, whom I regrettably forgot their name was fantastic! He was quick to make great recommendations, made great conversation and you got a sense that he enjoyed coming to work. The atmosphere was everything you could want, especially during a celebratory weekend like the Grand Prix. The music was great, and created for a lounge type feel. This restaurant is a fantastic spot and I will certainly make a point to come back on my next trip! An absolute must!!"

When delivered, the portion was less than half the size of the bowl. When speaking with the manager he was rude and would not do anything to compensate. They tried to blame the delivery service without acknowledging their mistakes. Average poke bowl, expensive for the portion size,  and less than par service. Would not recommend."

Service was fast and the quality of the fish was mind-blowing. From the configuration of the bento box to the quality of the rice and the fish, it is indubitable that Ryù is worthwhile. I took the combo 2 and the hamachi was the scene stealer. The only reason I did not put 5 stars is because the edamame was bland. Otherwise, one of the best sushi places in Montreal!"

/user_details?userid=QaoXLhacVlI0N4R0EzTfYw,Mariana G.,"Arlington, VA",3 star rating,"My expectations for this restaurant were really high. After reading some reviews, I decided to pay a visit. Upon my entrance I was greeted at the door, the host/waiter was very enthusiastic and I liked it. The ambience was very pleasant too - cheesy music from MJ to The Police. The sushi was excellent. However, they kept on messing up with my order. I ordered a hand roll, and got a cut roll instead. Then they gave me the hand roll on the house (corrected the issue). But this wasn't the only issue. I also ordered extra nigiri that didn't make it to my table until I reminded them. It's okay if the restaurant is new, I take lightly this type of mistakes. Something that I hope the owner takes note though: is how employees should treat the customer. The host kept on poking me on my shoulder and obliques whenever wanted to check on me. Let's see if they improve!"
