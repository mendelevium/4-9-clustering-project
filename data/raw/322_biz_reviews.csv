/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wahoo! Our home cooked dinner plans didn't materialize tonight so I was sent out in the cold to grab some takeout. I had seen Le 409 from the outside many times and even researched it a little but had never stopped in before this visit. It was a little odd tonight because a sign on the door was limiting service to takeout due to the COVID-19 virus. The decor is really cool with yellow walls, wood and leather accents, and some Art Deco inspired sconces and artifacts. Also there is a large bar in the center of the space that looks quite inviting. It was closed tonight so I didn't get the full experience while waiting.I ordered butter chicken, shrimp with coconut curry (spicy!) some rice and naan to go. Wow, that's some of the best Indian I've had, which is really saying something as I've been to India at least 20 times over the years. The curry was pretty spicy for the average pallet (just the way I like it)! The shrimp was cooked perfectly, the chicken a little over done (hey if you're going to make a mistake with chicken I would rather err on the overcooked side). The sauces and naan were also outstanding. That was an excellent meal and I can't wait to go back."

For drinks, I ordered mango lassi mixed with rum which was excellent with a shot of rum which was a perfect combo mixed together. It's not on the menu but do give it a try ;-)We ordered a variety of tapas: vegetable curry, lamb curry, naan, butter chicken and several other dishes. The dessert, ""les gulabs"" was absolutely heavenly and I strongly recommend it. Service was great. I will definitely come back soon."

Our waiter was fantastic, very professional and suggested great wine pairing. It's great to see an Indian restaurant elevated. Keep up the great work team!"
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We came here after seeing the Alegria Circus show. What a wonderful way to finish our evening! As soon as we got in, we were greeted by a warm welcoming (probably the manager - super nice gentleman and involved). He gave us a nice spot for six and with a smile too! The service was very warm and professional. I absolutely adored our waitress that is originally from Saint-Hyacinthe (tu sais qui tu es :) )Now onto more serious matters. The food. Everything we ordered was delicious! I was first worried that it wouldn't be spicy enough but I was wrong. Now I don't really think this restaurant should be compared to other Indian restaurants in Park-Ex. It's just not the same. The service, the decor, the quality of the food are nothing like Park-Ex. It's better. Yes. It's more expensive then the other Indian restaurants in Park Extension. I'm guessing the rent in the Old Port of Montreal is higher lol! The food here is very VERY good and the wine list is great as well. A lot to choose from at an affordable price. We got a bottle of Chianti that was paired very well with out meal for 59$. We ordered a soup, an appetizer and two mains. We were full and we had some food left to take home for a late night snack. So the portions were just fine! Will I come back if I'm around the area? Heck ya!"

All three of us took the vegetarian Thali plate: more than enough food and all four dishes were excellent. Sadly they only serve the Thali plates for lunch or for dinner on Mondays. The cocktails were also very good. For the price, this place is lovely for a nice dinner with friends or a date :)"
/user_details?userid=ahgcM5gvEyu8Fg0d1RFnlg,Michelle V.,"Dollard-Des Ormeaux, Canada",3 star rating,Le 409 is a new project located in the old port. I personally would like to describe it as a retro Indian upscale restaurant. Beautiful decor but definitely on the higher end side; can't complain because the location is very much self explanatory. This butter chicken was $16 but felt like it wasn't even enough for one portion. It was good but not memorable. Maison Indian Curry on Jean Talon still remains my favourite restaurant.
/user_details?userid=X5xxw-vfOuYwVd0wo8enCA,Miho N.,"Ypsilanti, MI",3 star rating,"This is a regular Indian restaurant that serves fancy alcoholic drinks. The food is actually nothing special. Lamb was cooked well however our appetizer fried onion fritter was way over fried. Masala poutine potatoes were burnt. They do not serve you the curries with rice unless you order it specifically, which was a first for me. (All other Indian restaurants we've been to serve rice with all saucy entrees). Service was nice and prompt."
/user_details?userid=c4uDSBsnHosIqaM5QFwNag,Oh K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This review is for a delivery order. The food was great - tandoori chicken is moist and flavorful, saag paneer is nicely spiced with bright greens and a generous amount of paneer. The pilau rice is very nice (I loved the caramelized onions on top), but my only tiny gripe is that I didn't see an option to order just plain steamed basmati rice. It's possible they have this at the restaurant but it didn't make it to the Uber Eats menu. Either way -- not a dealbreaker!I look forward to eating at the restaurant."
/user_details?userid=R65lN486-D04wV9e1xvDLQ,Shwetha H.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The food was good. It is not a traditional Indian food restaurant. The cuisine is a fusion of Indian and French like you have naanwich, chicken with cauliflower puree etc. A bit expensive but the taste is really good. The most spicy one is also tolerable. I ordered vegetarian thali and vegetarian naanwich. Both came with either soup or salad (included in the price). For both orders, the quantity was decent."
/user_details?userid=kDcRSO9BCdX_wccwfvcT8w,Ronni M.,"Nokomis, FL",5 star rating,"Wonderful food in a chic setting. This is far from the typical Indian restaurant as far as decor. You'll find many of the usual favorites, though. We enjoyed chicken tikka masala, chana mandala, onion fritters and garlic naan. Rice was not included, but we ordered it. All delicious. Highly recommended!"

/user_details?userid=XEqApY2jtSPdGptPsJHumg,Lucy F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place has a very trendy vibe going on... beautiful decor and atmosphere. It is obviously catered to adults. However, I really wanted to try their food so we showed up with our two year old daughter (with reservation). They made us feel welcomed and gave us a corner table so my daughter had space. I ordered a soup as soon as we sat down to keep the little one happy and they obliged by bringing it out before we even ordered our drinks. All the staff was beyond nice and very friendly. Our waiter was also very helpful in helping us deciding what to order. The food itself was excellent. We tried many dishes as they are quite small, so you can try a good variety. My only criticism is that some dishes lacked salt, although the spices and herbs still came through wonderfully. For me, lack of seasoning is a big deal so if I were reviewing the food only, it would be a 4 star. The naan was perfect. Not too dense but airy and with crisp edges. One of the best I've had.As for the prices, I definitely do not agree with other reviewers. Given the location and ingredient quality, they are more than reasonable. Service was superb. Enjoy!"

We had 3 small children and a large group of adults and this restaurant could not have been more perfect. Wait staff was incredibly friendly, helpful with the menu, accommodating to order changes. Food was delicious and unique with some great variety within the single orders of the entree plates. Our kids had room to roam and enjoyed the food. Great experience all around!!!"
