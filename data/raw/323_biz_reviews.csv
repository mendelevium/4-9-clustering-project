We were met with someone super lovely, happy to explain and recommend everything we asked about. With 3 vegan ramen bases, they taste pretty good- not the best I've had but definitely still up there. You get to choose between an 'original' miso flavour, spicy or more mushroom taste. Each come with different toppings and you can of course add more. I opted with extra tofu and noodles!! Others in group got extra tofu and the other added an egg and pork. Both enjoyed their bowls! The ice-cream they offer is super creamy with a good range for vegan options. The lady that served us offered to try one of the new vegan flavours which was so good! So if you're in and they have the chai vegan flavour definitely give it a taste"

Tasty, freshlY done, homemade broth love it. The best of the best is that you could have an ice cream (one of the best in town) as a dessert ;)"
/user_details?userid=rkPrz6uwJIefZdH2Oqv4Tg,Christian C.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"They offer 3 vegan ramen bases which you can top with more stuff, I prefer tofu of course, tofu is life!By far their best option is the spicy one which is topped with an incredibly delicious minced mushroom 'meat'. The ramen is available only starting October 1st and they do delivery too. Winter is suddenly much cosier thanks to this delicious ramen!"
/user_details?userid=7iZOLfdpS_iRYLR7hi6hPg,Cole S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious miso ramen with generous portions, tasty noodles which are ever so slightly thicker than my usual fare. Unique mushroom choices. There's isn't a ton of space to sit, so it's great for takeout , but if you can score a seat at the counter you can enjoy your soup in a cheerful friendly atmosphere. (There's also amazing Dalla Rose ice cream to be devoured afterwards) Â I will definitely be back!"

I almost feel like it's improved every year since opening.If your Vegan and looking for good Ramen - this is your spot! This is my second visit in two days so.....Enjoy!!

Looking at the pictures, I had such high expectations. I have had much much better ramen from other restaurants. I won't recommend this place to anyone."
/user_details?userid=R6bkoHDNURXSl20x0ZJ2Qw,Rawan H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Okkkk. My review is for the non vegans around (if you're vegan this place is pretty good given the limited options in montreal lol). If you're not vegan DO NOT GO!! Not worth it. You're better off going elsewhere. The pork has a weird after taste and everything else is pretty mediocre. I definitely won't be returning for the ramen - the ice cream is delicious though!
