I thought it was going to be just vegan sushi and nothing else, but I was wrong. They do a bento box and I got general Tao tofu and a miso soup with steamed rice and edamame as well as the samurai maki pieces. I also tried the ""black angel"" which had a delicious vegan tartare in it that tasted surprisingly fishy. For desert I got the fried banana which came with a delicious creamy scoop of vegan ice cream.Oh, I also tried the lemongrass soup, pretty refreshing!Will definately order again for movie night!"
/user_details?userid=jrEiNGTP_s7i8XSGCek8Hw,Helene C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I love this place! It's bright, it feels nice and welcoming.I came here to try the roll with black garlic as I haven't found a vegan meal made with it before. The Black Angel is made with black rice and it's topped with black garlic. Besides the sweetness of the black garlic, I also liked the flavor of the shiitake mushroom. The plate is beautifully decorated. However, it's a big roll of 6 pieces. Each are too big for a bite and it makes it difficult to eat without falling into parts. I wish they could adjust the size of the rolls, like more pieces in smaller size. Besides the vegan menu, they also have a gluten-free menu. This place is walk-in only, which I greatly appreciate. I am definitely coming back for more!"

It's the best way to try all the different rolls they have. My favourite will always he the eclipse maki roll. Simple, yet so delicious. There's something about the black rice that gives it that extra special feel"

Staff is also very nice."

I was there with my boyfriend and we ordered 4 different sets of makis, all were delicious. We ended the meal with their fried banana dessert that comes with a scoop of ice cream and fruit pieces. If you want a good experience and good vegan sushis, it's the place to go! Also, excellent service and the staff is very friendly!"
