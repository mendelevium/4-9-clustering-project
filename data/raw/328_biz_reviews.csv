Oh boy do I have the place for you! A sloppy plate of lasagne swimming in tomato sauce. Did I mention carbohydrates?I mean seriously, it's cold as f right now. Did you see the weather forecast for overnight? I just got a *snow squall watch* notification on my phone, gourd dangabbit. WTF. Someone get me a bathtub full of that tomato sauce, STAT"

Sublime lasagna, really affordably priced, friendly and quick service. If you're thinking about standard take-out fare this evening, give this a shot instead. You won't be disappointed.Since my initial visit, have been back many times - staple in the neighbourhood if you're looking for tasty comfort food."

The lasagne is very thick very home made style. It was a very nice surprise."

/user_details?userid=ZAOvKAGtQ64h8UQVqwoWCA,Sky M.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"I was craving lasagne and I'm so glad I found this place really close to where I was staying! I think most of the business they do is take-home-and-heat-up-yourself lasagne and catering but of course you can also eat it in the shop. One hearty serving was about $9 and a double serving was (I think) $13, so it is a good deal to get the bigger size and either share with a loved one or have leftovers to eat the next day. They have three kinds of lasagne at a time and the kinds change each week and use seasonal ingredients (for example, eggplants in August). When I visited there was veggie, meat with red sauce, and meat with ros√© sauce. I ordered the veggie and waited about 20 minutes for it to be heated up. I chatted with the owner while I waited and he was really nice. The lasagne was heavenly. It tasted really home-made, hearty, well-balanced, and fresh. It was very saucy and cheesy with perfect little pieces of zucchini and carrot. I will definitely come back and try the vegan lasagne that he told me about!"
