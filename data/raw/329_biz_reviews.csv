/user_details?userid=mm4ppq4u_5pqXfMYkSnJDQ,Soniya P.,"Springfield Township, NJ",5 star rating,Me and my boyfriend waited over an hour and it was totally worth it! The food here was great! My one complaint was while we were waiting on line one of the owners ushered this couple behind us to sit at a table but the older owner quickly fixed the mistake and took them it was not their turn. After dining we spoke with the older owner and he was very nice and welcoming. If I ever visit Montreal again I will definitely go back :)
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"We have been regulars at this establishment for years and I have always raved about the food here. We have chosen this restaurant for many celebratory dinners and it's been a constant stop when craving Indian/Pakistani food. Unfortunately I have had to bring down my 5 star rating, after several back to back disappointing experiences. We had a below average experience in the restaurant a few months ago, however we decided to order in, in an attempt to support local restaurants during the COVID lockdown and give this place another shot. Within the last two months, we have ordered food from here three times and each time the experience has been worse then the last. We ordered the Aloo Parathas & Butter Chicken Thali last week and the quality and the taste were horrible. The chicken used for the tikka in our Thali had gone bad, the taste of the food was bland. It felt like the order had been put together using leftover ingredients. I have no idea if the quality has been compromised because of the current situation, but an establishment should not take orders if they can not deliver. Highly disappointed and will not be ordering from here again."
/user_details?userid=XcXLzPjxQNbSmhXLVzGQHg,Shamir P.,"Seekonk, MA",5 star rating,We were in Montreal and need a good Indian restaurant.  Called a friend of mine who lives in Montreal and he recommended this restaurant.  My friend had called the owner and informed him that we were coming.  The restaurant has a great vibe. The decor is traditional Indian.  The staff is very friendly and welcoming.  The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious.  The best part is that you can bring your own alcohol in.  The best compliment I can give and Indian restaurant is that they cook genuine Indian food.  And this place cooks genuine Indian food.  Everyone in Montreal or visiting Montreal should try this restaurant.

/user_details?userid=G3IJqpS3BwGNFuBNcDxSLQ,Ekta P.,"Bensalem, PA",2 star rating,Figured we would give this a try since we were visiting from the US and it was walking distance from our Airbnb. Food wasn't that great. Service was HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. We ordered our food and then when we wanted more of it took easily 20-40 mins for it to come out and about 15 mins for the waitress to come take our order. We would get our naan and then we would get our entree 20 minutes later so it was a wait game with the food the entire time. The entire time we were there we were trying to flag them down as they did not stop by our table not even once to ask if we needed anything. We asked for spicy food and it wasn't spicy at all but rather tangy and sweet. I would not recommend this as a nice indian restaurant to anyone. Not sure how they have such good reviews on yelp.

I was craving indian food and wanted to try out a new restaurant. So i searched in Yelp and stumbled on this one. Only 5 stars review! Great!!!When my husband and i entered the restaurant, we were hit with so many delicious aromas and our mouths started salivating lol! A lot of choices on the menu. I chose the lamb curry thali which came with stewed vegetables, basmati rice, salad, naan bread, a tandoori chicken drumstick and a lamb stew. All that for only 10.99$! My husband chose a lentil soup, pulao rice, naan stuffed with meat and rogan josh chicken. Everything was so, so, so good!!! The portions were generous, the prices are great! With tax and tips, the meal costed us 43$. The service excellent! And to top it off, it's a byob! Last but not least, it's about 5-8 minutes drive from my place. I no longer need to go all the way to park-ex! One or perhaps the best indian restaurant i've had in a long time!"
/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I love this place! One of my favorite Indian restaurants in the city, and we've tried a few. The food is great and spicy when it should be. The prices are average, and the portions are generally generous. The best part though is that it's BYOB. We save so much  money eating out when we can BYOB.I came here for my birthday dinner and they have a prix fixe menu for large groups on weekends. I think it was $23/pp and there was SO much food. Pakoras, chana masala, butter chicken, lamb rogan josh, tons of rice, etc. Like way more food than we could have possibly eaten. They offered for us to take the leftovers home, but unfortunately we were going out after and couldn't take it. They were just a little weird about setting the table for us though - I had reserved for I think 12 or so and they only set it for 10 and wouldn't add the other two chairs until the people got there, so when they got there it kind of felt like they didn't have chairs and were forgotten from the reservation or something. Besides that though the service has been good and pretty quick."

Butter chicken is my favorite and it's not that spicy. The second favorite thing is the lentil soup: delicious!Other things I like but they are a bit more spicy: chicken biryani, chicken tikka, vegetarian samosa, chicken curry.Of course, you have to order the plain naan which is the best I had ever!Enjoy!"
/user_details?userid=JLY3gZSFTbOTHLxHS6SpNA,Kuv S.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Being in Montreal, for me, is a real treat. I speak fluent french, and have little to no respect of or for a native french person's deliberate attitudes towards natural english speakers. If you get this, you know where i'm coming from, if not, travel some more and you'll get there. So, Montreal. City of Churches, city of cold, cold winter nights, city of hot humid sticky summer days, piety and sin, Montreal is a world to itself.  Boom - chicken tikka masalla. Not Bengledeshi is this even chicken meat, not cann'd tomato paste masalla, the real deal holyfeld (if it were a real dish, in india), chicken tikka masalla. Deliciousness. Naans - and people i'm a damn expert on Naans (i own my own tandoor), perfect, garlic/onion, on point. Daal - do kaali daal, and both palak paneer and shah paneer are on point. Mango Lassi for the kids? Ofcourse, fresh and worth it. After the meal, whaaaat? you're in Montreal? Thats great, food so good i forgot i was in another fun and exciting city. Worth it."

The Channa Samosa is unreal. It is my go to place for all my special events. The decor also adds some fun to the atmosphere! It is my favourite Indian restaurant in Montreal.

The sauce was not watered down like in other places. It had texture because it was full of chopped up ingredients ( not fake thickeners and what not). Truly delic
/user_details?userid=jMHlwDq5b2zqhV5TyyFKPA,Yojna J.,"Victoria, Canada",5 star rating,"Hands down to this restaurant, as a Indian food lover, I always have the tendency to look for the best especially for consistency and freshness of the spices. Singh's fascinated me and I fell in love with their food and restaurant. This restaurant is very cutely decorated with Indian puppets and idols. In addition, it is very clean.I went for the vegetarian thaali and it consisted of rice, naan, and 3 vegetable dishes. I had the aubergine, dal and kofta. They were all delicious and so filling but as I loved their naans because they were so soft and melted in my mouth as well as the crunch of the naan. In other words, just cooked to perfection. I'd definitely go back to try other dishes at this restaurant. Plus it only cost me $6.99 for this dish which I found really cheap compared to other restaurant. I'd definitely recommend it if you want the real authentic foods from India and Punjab as you'd definitely fall in love with that place just like I did today. My tummy is a happy camper after this sumptuous meal at Singh's. :)"

Myself and the hubs hit this place when we crave some North Indian style food. The service is good, they are accommodating to food requests as well. The thali has decent portions and tastes alright as well. They could improve on the air conditioning on a hot summer day."
/user_details?userid=INsYmDEYGLImdSJUnxti_g,Fairooz K.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Great Indian restaurant in Montreal's Plateau neighborhood! Service is quick and very friendly, it's BYOB, and usually bustling around dinner time.  The tandoori chicken leg is tender and fragrant, served with a variety of sauces and chutneys. The garlic naan is extremely flavorful: the curries don't come with rice and I would suggest skipping an order of rice altogether and going with the garlic naan. We also ordered the lamb curry and palak paneer, both of which I would recommend.Prices are comparable to other Indian restaurants in the area."

The best Indian style food I've had in Montréal so far.I ordered my vegetarian go-to: shahi paneer, palao rice, and samosa. I was not disappointed. Particularly good was the channa samosa; I hadn't had it served ""wet"" before. Very, very good. The palao was tasty too.The service was also good and (who I assume is) the proprietor was friendly and helpful. They also have a gigantic goldfish that I'm kind of a fan of after sitting next to him/her at dinner. :)"
/user_details?userid=GbDfPbqp7gKRwbn116KDSA,Ben K.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Sadly, I'm still reeling from the mysterious loss of Chef Guru's thali plates. When is it ever wise to go forth, after a breakup, looking for something to fill the void, but always comparing that new thing to your ex? Is that ever really truly fair?My approach to Indian restaurants, like my approach to breakfast places, tends to rest mostly on a single dish/plate: For breakfast places, it's just two eggs over easy and bacon; for Indian joints, it's their thalis.Here at Singh's, it's.... okay. The Tandoori chicken was reasonably fresh and tasty. The lamb curry, a little nondescript, sadly. Rice is rice, and the naan was pretty good. No papadum. Of course, what is a thali plate without Curiously Sad Iceberg Lettuce Salad Syndrome(tm)? I simply cannot understand why this is on the plate. Sometimes they come with those pathetic ""baby"" carrots you get in a bag. Who started this thing? Is this to cleanse my palate? From what? Why can't the Habs score to save a life this year? Will we really see a Pink Metro line in our lifetime? What's the meaning of life? SO MANY QUESTIONS.As per service, well, what can you say. Aside from the perfunctory functions of bringing your food and taking your money, don't expect much here. Despite being the *only* customer on a quiet weekday afternoon, there was no service to speak of.All in all, this gets a rating of Iceberg out of Lettuce."
/user_details?userid=NqxB4wbUSgRTy8HJqWgzJA,Sonalika T.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I'm going to give this place a bad rating, only because of the management and their attitude. I took my friends there to make them try some authentic Indian cuisines and everything went fine until the end. First of all, the waitress refused to take the orders separate and said that she will only take the order once when all 5 of my friends arrived, which I found a bit weird as we were really hungry but ok. Later, they handed us the bill when we didn't even ask for it. We then told them that we didn't ask for the bill and we have a coupon we would like to use so pls make it again. The coupon was a legit one generated from Fido, the management refused to accept it and said pay us cash only which was really weird again. They said they never gave any coupons to Fido but it was still showing as redeemable on the Fido app all over Montreal! After 15mins of this scene and the whole night that went really went, finishing off with a bad experience especially for my friends who were here for the first time, we left. The management is ridiculously arrogant and sly and try to cheat you!"
/user_details?userid=aYL7qtwOMdzYayaddq_Hnw,CT M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Incredible Food. Wonderful Service. BYOW.Simply put, this is the best Indian restaurant I've found in Montreal. Everything I've tried on the menu has been exquisite.The Fish Pakora is a great starter. Light so it doesn't ruin your main course, but a delectably subtle heat.The Palak Paneer is the freshest I've ever had. And the flavour! It was like a Bollywood wedding recital in my mouth.And they have Dosas! Delicious, mouth watering Dosas that wrap you in their warmth and make you forget all your troubles. You should eat these Dosas.And the Service! Never, in my entire life, have I had such warm, personable service. Every member of the staff is nothing short of charming and endearing.So if you enjoy Indian cuisine, you should try Singh's at the very next opportunity. In fact, you should stop what you're doing (reading this), and consider when that very next opportunity might be, and just get'er done. Because until you do, you're missing out on one of the best things this city has to offer."

I'm Indian so I think I can tell :) The service was really great, they asked how the food was but didn't bother incessantly. The ambience was cozy and authentic, with interesting pieces of art that weren't too garish. Now the food, it was absolutely delicious. We went for the onion bhajia, the palak paneer, vegetable biryani, and two naan. The onion bhajia were warm, and could've been a bit more crunchy but they were absolutely delicious. The palak paneer had a perfect warm spinach flavour and the paneer was very nice and tender. Naan was nice and light, with a bit too much butter, but very fresh. And the biryani had the perfect ratio of vegetables to rice! I'm very pleasantly surprised, I wish we had a place like this in Toronto!"

/user_details?userid=LPDOx50zUR-rEovzOhADbA,Rachel C.,"Chicago, IL",2 star rating,This place is extremely over priced! I ordered the shrimp vindaloo and it was a whopping 15 dollars and it did not include rice or naan. To top things off it came in an extremely small bowl and it was mostly potatoes. The only thing that was fairly priced that I bought were the vegetarian samosas. The service that I received was also lackluster; the waitress only came to take my order and serve the food. I definitely will not be visiting here again.

The meat was on the dry side though (we had the butter chicken), but the sauce was perfect. Naan bread was fluffy yet crispy, and I would recommend picking coconut rice 100%.Do try the 2 specialty desserts: ras malai which is like a crustless cheesecake in sweet cream, and gulab jamun which is a honey-soaked fried ball of dough.

So, I came in a few days before, made an order for 12 people, and even got a 10% discount on the delivery menu prices. The whole process was very friendly and painless. They even offered me tea while they were taking the order. I had to pay a small cash deposit and the rest was paid on delivery. I called to add a couple of things on the day of the event, and it was no problem. Delivery arrived on the agreed upon time, the food was hot, nothing was missing from the order, and it tasted excellent. I even had leftovers for the next day.

We ordered a veg thali and they didn't have any curry options. The salad seemed to be frozen one. Moreover while we were eating our paneer tikka they bought our thali at the same time, hence naan and everything else went cold within few minutes. There is a difference between Starters and main course... and I don't eat everything at once!! Onions in paneer tikka were rotten so I didn't really enjoyed the tikka and rest of the food"

Firstly, the server who initially greeted us lead us to a nicely located booth, but then the manager came in and asked us to sit in a table in the middle of the restaurant, claiming that the booth was ""reserved"". It seemed that no such reservation was in place, as after a while when a group of white people came in who also had no reservation, they were lead to the said booth. Secondly, we had ordered a vegetable jhalfrezi, but our server returned with a lamb jhalfrezi - he was quite casual about it and said ""eat this, this is better"". While he was aware of his mistake, he didn't offer us a vegetable jhalfrezi, and in the end we were charged for the lamb jhalfrezi which was slightly more expensive than the vegetarian jhalfrezi.

We finally went as a group of three and each ordered a Lunch Special, two butter chicken thalis and a vegetable thali, as well as two appetizers.First the server brought a fantastic water jug and metal goblet-like cups to our table. We enjoyed pretending to be royalty.Our onion bajis and paneer pakoras came quickly and were incredibly fresh, a rare occurrence in cheaper Indian restos. They were accompanied by three sauces; a salty bright green mint cucumber dip, a sweet tamarind dip, and what seemed to be a (very) spicy mango.Soon after this our thali plates came, piled high with rice, naan, and a small simple salad. The butter chicken plate also came with tandoori chicken, which was very moist and flavourful. However, the serving sizes between the plates were inconsistent. The butter chicken had a thick, creamy sauce that was mildly sweet but uncommonly savoury (a good thing!). The veg plate came with a vegetable korma in a rich cream sauce, which was agreed to be the best part of anyone's meal. There was also some sort of tasty dal. Both plates came with a green pepper and mushroom curry that was very tender. The rice was average and the naan seemed homemade and fresh, but not as thick as found in some other restaurants, but better than the dry flat ones found commonly.It was raining when we came in, and owner kindly showed us where to leave our umbrellas. When paying he wanted feedback and was very friendly. Overall very impressed with this place, much better than the competitors within two blocks. Tasteful decor and very reasonable prices."

You can bring your own beer or wine, as they do not serve alcohol. Everything we've tried here is delicious--butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, mattar paneer, shrimp biryani, baingan bharta and garlic naan are our favourites. As soon as we tried Singh's, it became our go-to place for Indian food in Montreal. We've been many times and it's consistently great. The waitstaff are all really friendly, and a meal at Singh's is always a truly enjoyable experience."

/user_details?userid=nZUsDCm1v1tSJVWJHFEflg,Shin Ling L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Singh's was a let-down in terms of their service. After reading all the amazing reviews about their food, I was ecstatic to try them out. However, it took a good 40 minutes to an hour for it to even arrive! The waiters even forgot our mango lassi, and only brought it when we reminded them. The food was good though, however. I ordered a palek paneer (my vegetarian go-to) with tandoori roti, and they were both pretty good. After our meal, we had to wait for another 15 minutes for the bill because the person on the counter was on the phone. It was just a lot of waiting to do. Overall, I would recommend the food here because it was quite good (as an Indian food lover though, I don't think it was anything special/phenomenal), but I wouldn't go here if I didn't have the time or the patience to wait for an hour."
/user_details?userid=Ma22Bz0x2PGmMRvL9-SI_w,N P.,"Lachine, Canada",3 star rating,"Friendly staff, but understaffed and our table had to constantly look for them and wait long periods. A waitress grabbed our dipping sauces from our table to put it in front of two other clients without having replaced the sauces and cleaning the dish they were served it. This left us questioning the sanitary etiquette and what else goes on in the kitchen.Bathrooms dirty and dated. It looks like they cut corners to save $. Food was delicious but I will not go back because of serious concern regarding sanitary etiquette."

The service was wonderful!  Pleasant, great food recommendations and price was decent. We brought our own wine so that was good too. The curried lamb was amazing as were the other 2 chicken dishes we ordered. (Don't recall the names) Nan bread was fresh out of the oven and delicious! Atmosphere was comfortable. I would definitely recommend this place and will go back again."

Delivery guy said its an external company and they just called him 10 min ago and it took him 5 min to get to my place. Had to call the restaurant three time to check if the food is coming, the first time it was after 45 min of waiting and they seem like the order was not initiated."

The experience at singh's was extraordinary. Loved EVERYTHING!!!!! the butter chicken was great as was the chicken tika. Their naan (garlic bread) is to die for. The waitress was so pleasant and helpful with her great recommendations. Their manga lassi as a beverage was very nice. Finally we met the owner, manjit, who is a true gentleman. I'd rate this place 10 stars if I could"

/user_details?userid=ebjfLiQXXwgCxb_xgsYU_Q,s v.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"It's so disappointing when Yelpers lead you wrong, but this ended up being one of those places. It was our first night in Montreal and we wanted to get some takeout since we'd been driving all day and were led astray by Yelp saying Curry Majal was open until 10:30 (it's not open at all on Tuesday, the night we came in, and only open til 10 week nights). This place was close and well-reviewed so we came here instead. The hostess was fine and took our order, but asked us to pay before getting groceries across the street. So we wait for the man ringing up another tab and then he disappears into the kitchen. He finally comes back and tells us to sit down. We say we just want to pay as instructed so we can pick up some groceries and he tells us to pay when we get the food. A waste of five minutes but we were accommodating and came back 15 minutes later. The man made us tell him everything we ordered again since he hadn't bothered to get the check from the hostess, then turns to me, looks me up and down and says ""you don't look like you're from here, where are you from?"" As an ethnically ambiguous brown woman I'm used to this bs from white dudes but it's worse from brown ones - you should know how crappy it feels to be singled out and have others think they're entitled to a reading of your family tree while you're just trying get some damn dinner, so don't do it to others. I simply said ""New York,"" which clearly didn't satisfy his curiosity as he frowned giving my white husband the check. To top it off, they forgot our samosas and were completely unapologetic when we had to walk back to wait for them to make them, and the bizarre man took the paper bag they were in and told my husband they were ""very hot"" and tried to touch the greasy hot bag to my husband's skin to prove it. WTF? Our butter chicken thali was incredibly small for $12 and had been packaged so poorly that most of the sauce spilled out into the bag. The samosas and lamb saag were decent, but given the poor service I would advise others to look elsewhere."

We were originally planning to Darbar but we missed lunch by 15 minutes. One of the employees recommended we check out Singh's and I am forever grateful! The food, ambience and service was wonderful!! We had a fabulous time, and we can't wait to go back again! The spices were outstanding and each dish was better than the next. The chicken tikka masala was dynamite and the lamb jalfraizi was one of the most flavorful dishes I've had in my life. We were traveling with our 14 months baby, who loves Indian food, and the staff was super. They were so welcoming and very thoughtful! They offered to bring out some rice for our son while the other dishes were prepared because he was quite hungry when we arrived. I wouldn't hesitate to take any one of my friends or family to this restaurant."

I usually get the channa samosa to start and then a few vegetarian dishes with some rice and naan bread. I've tried the aloo gobhi, the saag paneer and the tarka dahl. All delicious. Once I went with a friend who prefers meat so we got a chicken dish as well. The meat was very tender and the sauce was great, but the amount of chicken was a bit sparse considering the price. Other than that minuscule complaint, which is really more of an observation than a complaint, this place is has it all. The owners are also great and very funny. I hope they will be very successful and I will certainly do my part to help!"

This was my first Indian restaurant in Montreal and was hesitant because I'm wasn't sure how it would turn out. The food was really good. We asked for it spicy and boy was it spicy! Usually b Indian restaurant cater to their demographic audience but Singh made sure it was authentic. The service was phenomenal and took care of you. I had an issue with the meter and the guy as the front came out and explained it to me. Only knocking it one star because their service size was on the smaller size but was still plenty. Their naans were really small though. My family and I, at other Indian restaurants only order 3 naan and we will be stuffed, here we had to order 5. Both overall, the service was good, decor was decent and food was tasty. If you had to choose between this restaurant and darbar down the street, go with Singh's. Darbar was garbage and the owner was unprofessional."

We had the all-you-can-eat table d'hote option for $22 and let me tell you, it was soooooo good! Saved us from having to make tough choices between all the delicious-sounding menu options 'cause they just brought us a fabulous variety of dishes. The food just kept coming, until I was stuffed to the gills. Bring your own wine, so the meal is actually very reasonably priced, all told. The server was hilarious, kept joking with our group. Great ambience, too. I would stack this up against anything I ate while travelling in India and say that it's at least as good if not better. I hope they're around for a long time 'cause I can see this place becoming one of my favourite spots."

I must say however service is Really poor. We had no one to really look after us even when there wasn't a rush. We had to keep reminding the servers for what we requested and at one point they were more into cleaning up than even seeing that we needed something. Overall great food would recommend take out and not dine in!

I am regular to this place and their Chef never disappointed me. Try their lamb dishes with Naan. Try mango lassi to cool down after some hot and spicy food ;) Try their Baryani if you happen to be a rice person.
/user_details?userid=Cp55I2xxGpB3dovZdnrysg,Kori S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A great find. Their lunch special is ridiculously good for the price. 3 Veggie thali for 6.49? Very hearty and deliciously spiced, and very good nan included. I also ordered the veggie pakoras that were crisp on the outside, fluffy goodness on the inside, served with three sauces. What a gem of a place. I had the butter chicken lunch 2 days ago, which was served with a juicy and crisp tandori chicken AS WELL, AND a veg dish, salad, rice, nan .... for $8.99. So yes, I went back today. And I'm so happy after the veggie meal I took a delivery menu home. The ""non-lunch special"" dishes are not expensive either. Maybe this weekend!"
