/user_details?userid=c4lTZbA8NeZBgB1YYB6Izg,Julie C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is my favourite steakhouse in Montréal and if not ever! The service is always impeccable, the wine list is extensive and not pretentious, the food is over the top and the steaks are just to die for. The restaurant used to be a horse stable and is one of the oldest restaurants in the heart of Old Montréal. My favourite thing on the menu is the rib steak At gibby's you order a main and it includes an appetizer and a 'palette cleanser' (a scoop of house made sorbet). I highly recommend the gibby's salad; their dressing is to die for! You can also just purchase the dressing by itself for $6. I've been doing this over the pandemic and make the gibby's salad at home. Best decision ever! The main also includes a side along with your protein - i highly recommend the montecarlo potato (twice baked with bacon and sour cream). Oh of course we can't forget about their pickles and bacon and the AMAZING homemade bread. I'm usually way too full by the time my main comes because their salad, bread and pickles are just too good and I always forget to save room for the main.Atmosphere is very intimate but a bit rustic and old school. I like it, but it's not a 'modern trendy vibe'. Dimmed lights, dark colours and stone / brick walls. Value/price 4.5/5Food/quality 5/5Portion 5/5Service 5/5Overall: 5/5Love love love this place!"

Seriously outstanding service and the food is delicious.  An absolute delight and we will be back.

PeriodCalled this evening to pay for my sisters birthday dinner with my credit card. The young girl who answered was polite, but the ""Manager"" was curt and rude. ""Too much fraud"". End of story. This is not the first time I have done this when she has been away and I have not been able to celebrate her birthday with her ON the actual day. This ""Manager"" should probably learn the value of good customer service ESPECIALLY in the post-COVID market economy. There was a 25% tip waiting for the server for their trouble. Shame this poor management can't go the extra mile for anyone. Perhaps it was because I mentioned I was from Toronto. More likely he just couldn't be bothered.  Harbour Sixty in Toronto is MUCH better service, and probably better food."

We made a rsvp and was lucky to find it because it was packed when we got there. Service was amazing and food was delicious. I had steak, my gf had the lobster. Both were perfectly cooked. The waiter was really attentive even though he has a full house. Overall the experience was really nice and even brought me a happy bday cake - big one actually.Thank you for an amazing evening."
/user_details?userid=8Ggt4vDYC73pv5wfYTPJsw,Zoejaiwah F.,"Fort McMurray, Canada",5 star rating,"Heard so much about Gibbys; while I was in Montreal for a wedding I had to visit.Made a reservation and thankfully so, they were crazy busy.The environment and dining experience was world class. The food was just amazing, I cried a little when my steak melted in my mouth. I don't even know how that was remotely possible to make a medium rare steak that just fall apart when chewed. Gibby's definitely takes the #1 spot for steaks in my books.Do visit the spot when in Montreal, you won't be disappointed. Their staffs, environment and menu offerings are way too surreal. The other meals were just as amazing."
/user_details?userid=17V3SlS2v5KLSuWQhcemJw,Paige G.,"Winter Springs, FL",3 star rating,"This place is getting three stars for the food. If it was based off service alone, I'd give it a one.We made reservations a month prior for a Thursday night at 7pm. The ambiance reminds me of a cozy old school steakhouse. We were seated immediately and greeted by our waitress. She seemed like she was in a hurry and this would continue throughout our meal until the very end when it was time for the check. I would expect a higher quality of service from a fancy steakhouse, but unfortunately that was not the case.Our table was right in front of the waiter station. So there was constant movement around our table which included NUMEROUS waiters bumping into the back of my chair. One time my hair must've been in the way because it was pulled as well. We had bread, bacon bits, and pickles brought out to the table first. Then came our salads, which we both enjoyed. It has a nice zesty Italian dressing.I ordered the ribeye and my boyfriend got the sirloin. My steak was cooked as requested, medium rare, but my boyfriend's came out more well done. My steak was good, but I've had better. Very disappointing for the price point. We both ordered the monte carlo potato for our side and it was pretty good. The asparagus was forgettable.We decided to skip dessert, based off our dining experience, but you're given some chocolates at the end of the meal if that excites you. The restroom is also upstairs. Not a big deal, unless you're wearing a dress/skirt and have someone below look up as you're walking up the stairs /:There needs to be more emphasis on service and food quality before I'd ever recommend this establishment.Also...move that table."
/user_details?userid=Q2euBRlNqfn4C1D635hNnw,Eric L.,"East Brunswick, NJ",5 star rating,"Gibby's is as good as I remember it to be. I've been coming here (on rare special occasions) since my father lived in Montreal in the 90s.It is probably my favorite steakhouse in the world. The combination of the great location in old Montreal, great ambiance and good price for high end delicious steak, and great service. The restaurant also has a unique charm. It is a special place and a jewel of old Montreal rather than a tourist trap. Not to mention that unlike other most steakhouses, the delicious steaks come with a generous crispy salad and a tasty sorbet (to cleanse the palate prior to the main course steak). Gibbys has an old world atmosphere and a nice courtyard in the back it shares with some old Montreal businesses. On our recent visit, my family played there as we waited for our table. It's a nice space for kids to run around and adults to enjoy the atmosphere. Almost like a hidden little gem, which by the way Montreal is full of by the way. Unfortunately these are becoming increasingly rare in my hometown, NYC. They have complimentary valet parking, which we didn't take advantage of as we took a nice walk over from the nearby famous Notre Dame cathedral in old Montreal.The steak we ordered was the bone in ribsteak but our waiter, Jeff ended up giving us the boneless ribeye - one of his 2 gaffes of the evening. The other being not telling us ahead of time that the mediocre kids pasta was a whopping $30. He was otherwise a personable and very good server.The steak was simply delicious. Not  salty and super buttery like they serve at Ruth's Chris or Mastro's. It was lightly seasoned but the steak quality and flavor of the meat itself was incredible.The accompanying Montecarlo double baked potato was really delicious too. Super soft and fluffy and nicely dressed with bacon, and a bit of sour cream and chives. Everyone loved it and we got it with each of our steaks. We also had the beef wellington filet mignon, which was as delicious as I remembered it. Upon ordering it Jeff told us the wellington usually takes longer for to come outfrom the kitchen than other steaks. It was cooked medium though we had wanted it medium rare. Jeff offered to replace it if we wanted it cooked medium rare and I was surprised when he said the new one would be out in only 10 minutes. We decided to just eat the one we got.It was fabulous and continues to be one of my favorite steaks anywhere.The steak is topped with mushrooms and a layer of puff pastry covers the entire thing. The flavors just enhance each other very well. A side order of spicy jalapeño sausages was on it $13.75 and had a super delicious smoky spicy flavor. I should have figured that anything meat related would be top notch at this high end steakhouse.Creme brulee and crepe jubilee dessert were both excellent."
/user_details?userid=5fr0MkDRhF3-k23UehMs4A,Shevon M.,"Marietta, GA",4 star rating,Glad we called for reservations the restaurant filled up pretty quickly. The pickles were excellent they brought in the beginning. The palate cleanser before the ribeye was also excellent. The ribeye was ok. My husband and I love Ribeyes so this was just ok. Same with the desserts.. they were big and we should have shared one... hubby had the chocolate dessert and said it was just ok. I had the cream brûlée which was good but a lot for me to finish. The service was top shelf.
/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I really wanted to rate this place higher but honestly the experience was average at best for a premium steakhouse. We somehow managed to snag the absolute worst table in the place, downstairs between the door and the service table. I might have preferred sitting in the hallway by the coat check...The wine list was good and had a nice selection of reasonably priced reds. I ended up with a 2016 Petit Manou which turned out to be a very good value. The food was solid but not worth the price of admission. The bread and pickles were meh, the 12 oz. fillet was a perfect medium rare and the twice baked potato was quite good. The Bearnaise sauce lacked flavor and depth. The steak, although cooked perfectly, was under-seasoned and somehow dry. Portion sizes were huge.I was hoping for a better experience at Gibby's. I walked away thinking my grandfather would have loved this kind of place."
/user_details?userid=vWZbYMFteqB85HlMCA5GMw,Jenny T.,"Washington, DC",3 star rating,Pretty good. We waited a few hours in the bar area upstairs because we didn't have reservations on Christmas night. It was comfy and quiet and spacious. The food itself was decent. The service and quantity was more impressive. My salmon picture was blurry but it was pretty good. The gazpacho and oysters were good. The atmosphere was great but the food wasn't unforgettable.

Everyone thanked me for choosing this location as a stops.  The appetizers, deserts was amazing too.  Make you you try the Gibbys chocolate delight desert which is layer with chocolate and crunch.I had high expectation for this restaurants as on earlier tourist stops, we told people we met that we planned our dinner at Gibbys and everyone one said yeah that is one of the best in Old Montreal.Prices are on premium side but you get what you paid for."

I was dining alone and arrived at 6:00pm before the restaurant got too busy. I ordered food immediately, and enjoyed the warm bread and creamy butter. The house salad was delicious, and they gave me a taste of lemon sorbet after I was finished. I ordered my steak medium and the server offered to add some extra spices to it, which was delicious. I ate every bite and enjoyed their house dessert, which was very rich!"

It's as if you're going to your chalet far north but in the old port of montreal...Fancy and comfy as soon as you enter you feel like you travelled back in time.Free Valet parking is always great and efficient Service: A1 from the valet jockeys to the hostess and waiters , the service is amazing and attentive even when it's busy beyond belief.We were seated at a great table secluded and we were happy we could hear each others voices talk.Food: Amazing and deeelicious.I had started with their clam chowder soup, it's my favourite here they really are generous from the way they plate it in front of you to the rich creamy broth you indulge in , it was superbe. We had some Rockefeller Oysters melted in my mouth.For my main, I had their eggplant Parmesan with rice pilaf decided to go vegetarian that night lol (kind of) definitely worth it and I was full! It was really good and generous portions.Overall, Gibbys is a classic Montréal landmark and if you have not been here you're definitely missing out. It's one of the best restaurants and definitely worth a treat to visit. Cheers!"
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I think the last time I came here must of been 5 years ago. I'm sad to say that they did switch up the uniforms which I find to be blah now just a regular black apron. Back in the day they used to wear these burgundy long dresses that made the women look like they were collecting milk on the farms.Our waitress wasn't the best she just seem to not be happy or she didn't like us which she had no reason not to be especially when we are there paying a hefty price. Just very blah attitude a fake smile and super quiet when she came around our table. Yikes. We were a group of 6 tucked away in the back beside the window not a very loud spot as we came at 6 pm so the louder Saturday night crew of people hadn't arrived yet.We started with cosmos which were ready in a heart beat and than of course we jumped right in to our mains. I got the steak teriyaki and chose the Monte Carlo Potato which is pretty much the best double baked potatoes of life. (Ask for sour cream ) The asparagus were bland nothing to wow me over. Steak was cooked medium exactly how I like it and the sauce that cameWith my steak was (teriyaki) it was very sweet so didn't eat much of that.I noticed our waitress didn't offer the different salad dressings which should be told to you I mean since I've been going there I know the options but if you're a out of towner or a newbie it would be nice to know they have Gibbys, French, blue cheese etc. (You're welcome)The best part of the dinning experience is the bread and pickles everyone loves them, I mean can you really go wrong with fresh warm bread and big pickles ? It's not my favourite spot for a steak personally I know a lot places that are better and cheaper but Gibbys is just a thing to do or to say hey guess where I went. It's not all that. Valet crew was yelling in the streets at people which was kind of weird when we were waiting for our uber nobody wants to hear yelling pipe down.Would I go back ? Yes Of course still not my top places to eat in mtl tho."
/user_details?userid=Mt-_SvJyDirR9fpZx9dbEw,Tommy S.,"Bellevue, WA",1 star rating,"I cannot recommend this ""establishment"" due to the poor service. I reserved a table for two for a special occasion a month in advance. When we arrived, we were ushered into a peripheral room and a table that was poorly located. There were many other nicer tables in the center of the restaurant, where the ambiance was much nicer. You'd think reserving one month ahead of time would guarantee a good table but guess again. Because of the poor placement of our table, people were constantly passing by and disturbing us. Even the waiters weren't paying attention when coming and going. I was personally shoved twice during my meal and our table was hit at least 5 times, and once our cutlery fell on the floor due to the impact. Service was barebones: took our order and brought our food and drinks. The most basic service I have ever received at an ""institution"" that prides itself for its reputation. At least it was easy to catch the waiter's attention when we needed him, because he kept on passing by. The steaks were above average, but certainly nothing to write home about and not particularly memorable. For the price that we paid, it was not worth it. In summary:Despite reserving one whole month in advance, we were giving arguably the worst table in the restaurant even though there were much better tables available.  Now I don't know for sure, but I suspect that our original table was switched by the host who greeted us. If that is the case, then this would be called profiling and is something that I do not condone. If this is not the case, then there's no point in reserving ahead of time because you end up with a bad table anyway. I apologize if this review seemed harsh -- maybe we got really unlucky that day -- but at the end of the day, it was supposed to be a special occasion and our experience here was more than just a fly in the ointment. In my humble opinion, for the price, there is no excuse for how we were treated and I will not return."

As we were walking in, I held the door open for easily 10-15 people. Not one said thank you. So that's the crowd that goes here.... (not Gibby's fault!)Service was excellent! Food amazing! Piping hot. I loved the pickles at the beginning of the meal. We ordered the escargot. It was very good and now I'm looking at buying an escargot dish online. Haha! The salad was surprisingly good! My boyfriend (now fiancé as he proposed later that night) usually doesn't eat salad unless it's Caesar, and he cleared the plate. The dressing was very good. The steak was perfect and the Monte Carlo potato...I will have dreams about it. It was so creamy and rich. We took what we didn't eat home with us and ate it the next night. Nice little celebration again as newly engaged for the following evening at home. Highly recommend going here."
/user_details?userid=fQcfRZkcOO-MXFYD5umf2w,Alan S.,"Houston, TX",4 star rating,"Relatively affordable fancy dining. The fillet mignon was $60, but it starts with pickles and fresh bread, comes with a nice sized yummy salad, a pallet cleansing lime sorbet, the Monte Carlo (twice baked) potato and even cute little chocolates at the end. I feel like this is the place you go to celebrate a birthday or other event. The building is beautiful to boot as it's an old stable in old Montreal. They even have valet included... Cause dealing with parking would be a total bummer before going to eat at a place like this. On top of it, there is great service. Not the best steak I've eaten (hence the 4 not a 5) but still solid."

It is a cozy and rustic restaurant with wood throughout.  Great atmosphere with a cabin/ski lodge feel.We started with their Jumbo shrimp & Garlic Escargot.  Huge shrimp with excellent cocktail sauce.  The decadent, garlic, buttery Escargot were exceptional.  We paired the starters with a local Amber IPA- St. Ambroise-which was light and not too hoppy.Next was the Caesar Salad with Anchovies-excellent!   We both ordered the ""Gibby's cut"" with the twice baked potatoes.  We added the spice and pepper topping.  The bone-in ribeye looked like a tomahawk & came out a perfect medium rare.  The meat was tender & the added spice topping gave it just the right added punch.  Use your table bacon bits on the potato-you won't be disappointed.  We paired dinner with a J. Lohr Cabernet which was excellent!The Key Lime Pie is a specialty so had to try it.  Good for sharing and tasty!  We had a couple of servers that took care of us and all of them were exceptional.  Offering to take pictures and refilling our wine glasses with just the right amount of check-Ins between courses.You can buy a bottle of the steak spice on the way out.  Epic meal & by 9 when we were finished it was full so reservations are recommended."

/user_details?userid=sGJvx1MTsetDzsnrHfJHLg,Aaron E.,"Orange County, CA",5 star rating,"Looking for an old world Steak House experience while in Montreal? I suggest you stop at Gibby's. A respected Old Montreal establishment,​ most of the Gibby's structure was built at different points from 1765 to 1850; it was renovated in 1967 along with many other historical buildings in the tourist trap known as Old Montreal. This Steakhouse is actually part of what was once called the Youville Stables and is now known as a top steakhouse in Montreal. Known for their outstanding red meat and thick cuts, going to Gibby's is an expensive night out, but it is worth the coin. Walking through the doors you immediately get a sense of the history behind the building and the amount of seriousness the kitchen and staff put into their product. The hosting is swift and nimble (and uses a written card system straight out of 1920), the servers are gregarious while rushed and the dining room is packed & loud. Even the menu is probably too busy for its own good but Gibby's almost asks ""If you can do it at a high level, why not?"". Oh, and get reservations because you'll need them. All main courses are served with a choice of ""Gibby's Salad"" (Anchovies on request), or the Soup of the day. I chose to try the Gibby's Salad which is a rather simple affair with their signature Dressing that is also bottled and sold at the restaurant. This is remarkable in today's ""a la carte"" times that try to squeeze every penny of revenue out of the appetizers, side dishes, and most fiendishly to date - tap water. In the middle of the table, a bowl of the famous Gibby's ultra sour Pickles and a loaf of freshly baked Bread taunted me throughout the meal almost begging me to overeat. And I did. For my main, I opted for the magnificent Filet Mignon of Beef Wellington thanks to the suggestion of a neighboring table 's hard push. This culinary madman includes an 8-10 ounce cut of perfectly medium rare Filet that comes covered with Mushrooms Duxelle and wrapped in a gloriously golden brown Puff Pastry which is served with Bordelaise Sauce from the heavens for dipping (or slathering). The lot of it must weigh close to a pound - preposterous I know - but it gets better still...Flanking any meat course is a mandatory threesome of Asparagus Spears and Tomato that you will undoubtedly ignore but their partner called the ""Potato Monte Carlo"" is what will have you screaming for mercy. This is a half of a Russet that is Double baked with Bacon, Sour Cream, and Chives that is as addictive as cigarettes seem to be in Quebec and probably just as healthy. The issue is you just keep eating until the plate goes away. You have been advised. (Note to California: This all come at you for just over $50.00. Try that at home.) I know some will scoff at the crowd and I will be the first to admit it is ""mature"" and ""fussy"". Okay, let's be real - this would be my father's favorite restaurant in Canada. That doesn't mean Gibby's doesn't crank out an astonishing product and deserves a stop while in the area. I saw 2 Hawaiian shirts and 3 pieces of Supreme in my 20-foot sight radius alone so don't get worked up about the stuffiness. Gibby's is for the people. In a city with so many culinary options, this Steakhouse really ought to be on your radar.j"
/user_details?userid=g8Xvvv4HSB93aLk4vkgWjA,Kimberly H.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"One of my favorite dinning experiences in Montreal. The restaurant itself is interesting as it is in a renovated historic stable, and it plays this up quite a bit in the decor. The food came out in courses starting with oddly enough whole pickles. I'm a pickle gal so I loved this. My husband was confused so I just ate his pickles. I ordered a steak medium rare & my husband got the Beef Wellington, which had a lovely flaky crust and a perfectly pink center. Overall very well done. If you get the baked potato side, definitely get the Monte Carlo. It's like a twice baked potato and it's Oh. So. Good.The service was excellent and lived up to a fine dining experience. I was nervous because we were traveling with our 5 month old baby and I wasn't sure if the staff would be comfortable with us eating with him, but they were very accommodating and allowed us to bring our stroller right next to the table so the baby could sleep."
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Gibby's is without a doubt as good as it gets. Not only as a restaurant, but also as a life experience.The restaurant is unapologetically unhip, rustic, and old-fashioned. From the minute you are escorted your table, it is clear that you are a VIP guest being closely looked after. Virtually everything served is made in house. They do not cut corners here and for their efforts they are rewarded with endless customer loyalty.Upon sitting, you are immediately served with a loaf of delicious home baked bread that is still hot and has the consistency of pastry. Spread with butter and the complimentary homemade bacon bits, it's like biting into the forbidden apple in the garden of Eden.You are also supplied with a never ending supply of dill pickles as well as full fat cottage cheese with chopped green onions (upon request). Up to this point, there is no charge for anything listed in this review.Pair the free bites with a stiff drink or three and you are already well positioned for a great evening. Then comes the famous Gibby's salad included with every meal. It is a fairly simple salad composed of mixed greens and tomatoes. Where it excels however is with the addition of the homemade garlic dressing, homemade croutons, fresh cracked pepper, and anchovies (on request). After a few slices of the bread with butter, bacon bits, pickles, and salad, usually someone at the table will say that they are full and don't even need a main course. Ignore these people for surely they are deeply unhappy and damaged. They might even be a danger to themselves and the public.The steaks here are both humongous and divine. While they don't get the same level of caramelization on the crust as some classic American steakhouses, they do come with spices and chopped garlic upon request and are usually cooked to perfection. From memory, they have 2 sizes of filet mignon, a gigantic sirloin, and the mighty ribsteak. Other spectacular dishes are the rack of lamb served in the classic style with classic mint jelly, shish kebab, and beef Wellington. On the seafood side, their butterfly shrimp is spectacular. You are served with about 8 or 9 huge butterflied shrimp which are lightly dusted with garlic breadcrumbs and served with garlic butter. They also have lobster tails, and fresh fish which is well prepared....but seriously, don't ruin your life by ordering the fish. We're here for a good time, not a long time.Each meal is also accompanied by a side. Gibby's signature side is the Monte Carlo potato which consists of a twice baked potato prepared with sour cream and bacon. It is outstanding and actually goes well with the garlic butter or mint jelly if you happen to have them on your plate.Desserts are also stellar, but somewhere between the salad and the main, even the seasoned bon vivant will throw in the towel and beg for mercy before it is offered. Most often, we are served with their (say it again......) HOMEMADE and complimetary birthday cake which is made with real butter cream and oranges or peaches. Even if you are busting at the seams, have a bite of this. It's beyond solid and tastes even better when eaten the next day on an empty stomach.Did I mention you are served with a small cup of sorbet to cleanse the palate between the salad course and main course? Did I mention that the salad and the side dish, as well as the bread, bacon, pickles, cottage cheese, sorbet, and even mint chocolates are all included in the price of a main course? Did I mention that a meal here averages somewhere between 40-60$ per person before wine? This is what makes Gibby's a special place. While certainly not inexpensive, you get spectacular food and value for every dollar spent. I'm genuinely grateful that this place exists and in my humble opinion it continues to define the gold standard for dinner in Montreal."

They actually charge you for what it costs to have the portion bottle of wine instead of most places charging 12-15 American for a glass. I started with the bisque. My husband had the French onion. Both were amazing. He said it was the best French onion he's ever had. The homemade dressing on the salad was really good. I wish I would have bought some. For our main entrees we both had the beef wellington and the monte carlo potato. I could go on and on about this dish. The beef inside the flaky crust was cooked PERFECTLY. How do they even do that? The potato had so many flavors and melted in my mouth. I currently still have dreams about this meal even months later.For a classy steakhouse, this place isn't exactly cheap but it ended up being less expensive than we expected. Highly recommend."

We ordered our dinners... a Gibby's cut ribeye medium and a 8 oz filet medium well. Salads are included with entrees and came out quickly and were delicious. Entrees also came out in a timely manner shortly thereafter. My wife cuts into her filet and it is medium rare at best. She flags down the server to ask if it could get it cooked a bit more. No problem they take it back. The manager, Ani..Anni.. something like that comes back with it after a few minutes and it was not anymore done after he requests we check it and personally sees that it is still quite rare.He apologizes and says he will have a new steak out shortly and we are disappointed, but still ok at this point. He comes back out a few minutes later and says that the steak will be 7 more minutes. Roughly 15 minutes later we tell our server that we do not want the steak anymore as she has lost her appetite but a moment later the peach Ani, puts the steak on the table and my wife tells him she is not even hungry anymore. He huffs and puffs and takes her silverware and food away with him.Our check comes and the steak was removed but there is a $10 charge for her salad. My wife heated at this point approaches the manager and questions the salad charge. He explains it is company policy but rudely replies that he will take off the charge if it makes her feel better. The situation should of been handled differently for a steak house of this caliber and the kitchen and management missed the mark.There is so much potential for this place as my steak was delicious but also underdone. They need to learn how to cook to temperature and how to treat customers/ how to handle objections."

We came from Toronto for my boyfriends birthday and heard so many rave reviews for this place, it didn't disappoint!It's situated along a small cozy street and we had a reservation for 4 at 7:30pm. We were seated quickly however it was busy and the manager who seated us was walking rather fast and it was hard for us to keep up.Once seated our server Milton was great! We all had the Gibby's Salad. It came with freshly cracked black pepper and croutons on the side offered by Milton and the dressing was very tangy. I had the rib eye steak and my boyfriend had the rib steak. We all got the twice baked potato and it was delicious!The steak came out a perfect medium rare and it is HUGE. For a 50$ steak it is really worth it considering the keg back in Toronto can be just as expensive. It comes with a black pepper and garlic sauce on top however I opted to have it on the side. We aren't fans of red wine so we just stuck to drinking Stella that came in bottles.The butter bread and pickles that came with the meal was pretty good considering we didn't eat all day on the bus ride here."

We did once have a bad experience with a new waiter, but there is a learning curve, so no big deal. Easily the best steakhouse in Montreal. Everything is always cooked to perfection, sides are included (you see a of places where you have to pay extra for a side of potato, not his place). Everything is homemade, meal starts with fresh warm bread, butter, bacon bits, and pickles. Salad is included, and is delicious, I keep meaning to buy their dressing when I leave but always forget once I'm in the absolute food coma you get from their food. For an average price of $100.00/person with drinks, you can't beat it for a nice night out, especially in the summer, because Vieux Montreal surrounding Gibbys is so nice for a walk afterwards."

Your meal begins with yummy warm homemade bread, pickles and delicious butter to go with the warm bread.Then your main dish comes with the option of soup or salad- my pick is the fresh salad. Then to change your palette, a scoop of sorbet is served. For the main course, I usually order rib eye steak, filet mignon or lobster. Each one is heavenly and well spiced. Not to forget the dish comes with your choice of rice or potatoes. My favorite is the monte Carlo potato. I am normally full after indulging so much however if you have some room left, I strongly recommend ordering and sharing the Irish coffee. It really hits the spot and as a bonus you get to see them prepare a whole show in front of you.This place is always packed for a reason so make sure to rsvp.

A tender steak wrapped in a flakey crisp wrap, I can see why Gordon ramsay is all about it. My steak did look a little bit more on the rare side, not sure if that's how it is but it was so tender that I didn't even mind. Better than it being over cooked!Dessert- too full for dessert but they do offer a whole birthday cake (vanilla sponge cake with whip cream and fresh fruit) if you noted that it was for a birthday/special occasion when making reservations.

Very cute to take pictures of with your friends or significant other. It has a very rustic vibe to the restaurant. Cons: - Food: Our clam chowder was not very good. The clams were not fresh and had a different taste to them. We also got the Filet Mignon of Beef Wellington and the beef did not taste so great either. My partner got the Lobster Tails and they did also not taste fresh. - Price: For the quality of food I got and the weight of the price, my partner and I were not to happy. - Parking: You will probably have to pay for valet here. Unless you leave early and can find parking in the area. Unfortunately, we are from Toronto and did not know the area well. Overall, I do not think I will be coming back.

The restaurant itself is located in an old stable, so it's a really interesting venue. The restaurant is also located in old Montreal, a historic part of town with some really interesting architecture and old buildings. The service itself is quite nice, attentive, and responsive.I ordered the ribeye, or what they referred to as the Gibbys cut, which was a standard 22oz steak. Being in Montreal, I wanted to try a steak with true Montreal seasoning, and it actually was much less salty than Montreal seasoning rub you would buy in a store, which I liked as most places tend to over salt their meat.  One thing to note is that their medium rare It's probably a little bit more rare than you would typically expect. Also, they only season one side of the meat which was a surprise to me. The cut of meat wasn't spectacular for a ribeye steak... it also didn't taste that spectacular. The asparagus that came with the steak was also not seasoned at all and tasted like it was simply blanched.  The salad had a dressing mixed in which I asked for to be on the side but the salads were premade so the only thing the waitress could do was request a light dressing -- it was tasty but still a bit too heavy on the dressing for my taste.  The Monte Carlo potato is basically one where they scoop out the potato, mash it and add bacon bits, chives, etc, and stuff it back into the potato.  Menu price ~$54.  The ambience is nice, and you don't have to cook it yourself, but an average tasting ribeye, blanched asparagus, a salad, and a baked potato for that price just felt a bit too high"

When you order a main plate, salad and potatoes come with it. Salad was very good, nice light dressing, Monte Carlo baked potato was out of this world. The ribeye was very delicious however my beef wellington was not that great. I was watching master chef and Gordon Ramsey was showing how to make beef wellington and it looked so good. So I searched Montreal restaurants and found that Gibbys had this item on their menu. But I was let down, first I had asked for Medium cook but the brought Medium rare. I asked them to cook it more. Once they brought it back, the meat was not seasoned at all and was kinda tough. I did not enjoyed it at all.I am still giving it a 4 star as everything else was excellent.

There is a nice, large waiting area upstairs where there are many couches, seats, etc. The restrooms are also located by the waiting area upstairs and to my surprise it was a gorgeous, clean restroom (strange observation, I know, but too many places these days don't take care of their facilities).Dinner service starts with bread, homemade pickles and fresh bacon bits. I didn't know what to do so I just ate the pickles and scooped some bacon bits in with the mixture. Their pickles are DELICIOUS. They are giant, whole pickles with lots of flavor and crunch. I started with the French Onion soup and wasn't impressed. Soup was very sweet and didn't have a whole lot of flavor. I'm more of a salty French Onion person, but that's just me.For dinner I had the escargot. Escargot was delicious, but I was surprised it didn't come with toast or bread of some sort to dip in the oil. My Mom enjoyed her salmon and said it was perfect. It did look great and the vegetables accompanying the dish were just the right ""al dente"" style so I would say salmon there is a safe choice if you're looking for a fish dish. My fiancé had the filet and loved it as well. It was cooked to the temperature of his liking. I guess for the money I would expect presentation to be more than it was. None of the dishes had that ""WOW"" look to them. Taste is always more important than presentation, but sometimes presentation can deceive the mind into thinking the food tastes better, or vice versa.I do want to note that the service was SPECTACULAR and we made sure our server knew it. She made our experience memorable. We were here celebrating my fiancé's birthday and she came out with a birthday cake (not sure if it was complimentary as I did not see the receipt) that said ""Happy Birthday Ryan!"" and was enough to feed 6-8 people, if not more. The cake was light and not too rich, with some lovely fruit in the mixture. We all loved it. They also take your picture and then at the end of the meal come out with a Gibbys paper frame with the picture inside! It's such a unique touch and we greatly appreciated the gifts. Everyone from our server to the hosts to the reservationist and management were extremely friendly and welcoming.I would say this place is so popular because of the nostalgia feel it gives the folks of Montréal who have been dining here since they were children. The food was just OK to me. I'm glad I tried it, but don't know if I would go back."

You will hate it!!This place is the type of place my parents would enjoy.  It's dark, dingy, the server outfits are outdated, and the food is over priced.  Yet, this is a well known restaurant in Montreal so it keeps packing in the people.Being from Texas, I know good steak, this is not good steak.  I've had better steak in Denmark.  Having traveled the world, it is rare to take a recommendation from a trusted source without first consulting Yelp but I didn't have Wifi so I went with the suggestion and now I wish I hadn't.There is not a full service bar to eat at so if you're a single person, you will be seated at a table.  My waiter was Asian.  Nothing against him at all but from the start, you knew this was not going to be an authentic meal at all.They bring you bread, butter, pickles and bacon pieces.  That's strange but I went with it.  All were pretty alright.The wine selection is unimpressive to say the least.  I ordered Osso Bucco because I heard from the table next to me that the steaks were over cooked.  And I saw that the table next to me was served a well done steak.  Again, being from Texas, the cook should know better than to butcher a good cut of meat.The Osso Bucco was a large portion and the flavor was not memorable.  As my side, I had a baked potato Monte Carlo which I was grateful for as it was the only food item I could really eat and it was not great.  On the side I was served carrots and asparagus, they were not prepared with any uniqueness at all.  They do provide you with lemon sorbet to cleanse your pallet and that tasted good, ha!  Oh, they do give you tiny chocolate square when you pay that are edible.I don't know why people dine here, I can get better food at Texas Roadhouse.  I guess it's nostalgia?? I looked around the dining room and there were both young & old people so I'm guessing it's their reputation or name that keeps them in business.  I wouldn't dine there again."

The food was delicious and satisfying - our favorite was the Monte Carlo potatoe], which is essentially a twice baked potato. The house salad that came with our steak could have used more flavorful tomatoes. The reason I am giving only four stars is because this is a steakhouse and our steaks, while tasty, were tough and chewy. We got the Gibby's cut of ribeye.

/user_details?userid=r6PbQjtij6gcalYWBBrILg,Maria B.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Gibbys is as great a steak house as they come. Located in the heart of the old port you get an amazing feel of the older part of town. If arriving by car you are greeted by valet who handles the hassle of locating parking in this area. The main entrance is beautiful courtyard and a rustic wooden door. Wherever you are seated you'll get this great warm feeling as the atmosphere of the restaurant sucks you in. My go to order is the fillet mignon with Dianne sauce. I have never been disappointed by this cut and always have it cooked just right. For dessert a flambé coffee is the way to go. If you still have room you can grab any dessert or simply munch on a mint chocolate in the shape of the iconic gibbys door. Worth the splurge every time !

Was also let down by the cream spinach, as it didn't even taste like cream spinach. Last we had dessert. We ordered a crepe and cheesecake.

Unfortunately my wife and I were marooned to a back room among boisterous business bores. The salad was good but the Wellington was not. The pastry had an agenda quite separate from the rest of the dish. The duxelles was more of a mushroom sauce. The filet was undercooked. The service was friendly and efficient. The price was high for such mediocre food. The building itself is attractive but overall the experience was not a good one. I will no longer recommend this place and we won't be back.

Drinks were never close to being empty throughout our 2 hour meal.The food is phenomenal--from the appetizers to the meals. We had the shrimp cocktail, French onion soup, Gibby's salads (yum! Where can I get that dressing in the US), a Gibby's cut ribeye and a petite filet Mignon. Both steaks were cooked perfectly. I was jealous of my husband's steak because he got the garlic butter/herbs on his, but mine was fabulous, too. The Monte Carlo potatoes are also delicious! I wish we had room for dessert--the apple crisp that was going by looked to die for.The only downfall to our dinner was that we were seated in the basement area, and it was extremely loud. I know Gibby's is located in a city, and I know the majority of loud parties were Americans (like myself) enjoying a night out in Montreal, so I can overlook the small let down. Just be forewarned if you're looking for a romantic dinner, this may not be the ideal place to go on a Saturday night."

We decided to try out Gibbys after reading all the reviews. We are so glad we went. To begin, this place is so nice and comforting inside. You feel like you're in a cottage with how the holiday decor looked. All the waiters and waitresses were beyond nice and helpful. We started off with a bunch of appetizers: the jalapeño sausage, mushroom tart, and French onion soup. Loved all of it! I'm not the biggest fan of mushrooms, but the tart was very tasty. The French onion soup was delicious with all that gooey cheese. The sausage came with mango chutney which paired well with it due to the sweet and spicy. At the table itself, they serve pickles, bread/butter, and a bowl of bacon bites. We were all in love. We each ordered our individual entrees (which the lady told us when ordering appetizers it's a lot of food, but we didn't care). My petite filet was good, however a little undercooked from what i had asked. Right away the waitress took it back and within minutes brought me a new plate with new sides. I was beyond shocked because usually i would just get the steak back. The Monte Carlo baked potato was really good with sour cream, bacon and chives. The asparagus was okay, a little too thick. For dessert we ordered a cake for my friend, which you can tell was homemade. The cake itself was very light and fluffy and the cream was a fresh buttercream. Others at table ordered the tableside Irish coffee which was a wonderful show to end our evening and it tasted so good. Once we were done (we were one of the last groups in the restaurant, we asked if they can take a picture which they did and even helped us ""stage"" the picture by picking a nice backdrop and moving the tables/chairs. Hands down one of the best steakhouses I've been."

Like being in an old lodge or tavern. Word has it that is used to be the stables for the horses way way back! Onto the menu. There are so many different cuts of beef that even the most difficult curmudgeon will find something to his or her liking. They excel with their peppercorn or mustard sauces on steak. Also there is an excellent selection of fish (salmon, tuna, swordfish, Arctic char) just to name a few. Shrimp and lobster of course. Really a super duper menu! On this fine evening I had selected the curry shrimp. I know this is a steakhouse but eating a big morsel of steak at 8:00 pm = a bad nights sleep for me! The curry shrimp came out on a very generous serving on rice with pampadams and asparagus. I found the curry sauce a bit gooey but it had a decent spice and was flavourful and fragrant. One the less!

Magnificent and stunning. I had nature oysters as the appetizer. They were absolutely delectable. These were followed by the Gibby's salad and the Petite filet mignon, very rare AKA blue. One word to remember here : tender. To top it off, I added to the whole experience the Gibby's layered chocolate cake. Dinner couldn't have been better without it. Simply delicious and special. Only thing that could be improved is their wine list. Since I'm a wine lover, I love to pair good and funky wine to my delicious dish. Sad that their ""exhaustive wine list"" isn't that exhaustive.

/user_details?userid=Xq-fN7JMQcdCmoY2sokQYQ,Paul R.,"Brooklyn, NY",3 star rating,"I'd say three stars overall, two if you give much weight to the price. On the plus side, it's in a beautiful building and has a great vibe, and the valet parking is a life-saver for anyone (like us) dumb enough to drive into this neighborhood thinking they'll save time. On the minus side, the food ranges from decent, neighborhood restaurant-quality (the steaks and fish) to standard diner-level (the salad and appetizers), to supermarket-level (the bread).  We were treated to some surreal comedy by a deadpan waitress determined to hard-sell the salad:""Are you sure you want the gazpacho? We're famous for our salad.""""That sounds nice, but I'm really in the mood for some gazpacho.""""We're FAMOUS for our salad.""""Yeah, I don't know ...""""And our dressing. You've never had anything like it. We're FAMOUS for our SALAD.""So almost everyone ordered the salad, which turned out to be a big bowl of iceberg lettuce, big wedges of half-flavorful tomatoes, and what tasted an awful lot like Newman's Own Italian dressing. It felt a bit like a Seinfeld episode. I was the only one at our table who took a chance on the gazpacho, which, while better than the salad, didn't distinguish itself in any way. It was under-seasoned (it hit the spot after an addition of pepper and the bacon bits they give you to tart up the bread)The arctic char I had was competently cooked, on the conservative / flaky end of the spectrum, and well seasoned. The ribeye steak I sampled was good quality and perfectly cooked medium-rare, with very little temperature gradient. It didn't taste like it had been dry aged or that it was any special provenance. It would have been an impressive steak at a lower price, but I hope for a little more when the price goes north of $50. We had a great time here, but I doubt I'll go back on future Montreal trips. I suspect the city has much better offerings. Gibby's reminds me of many New York City restaurants that have been around forever, and are now mostly famous for being famous. As such they mostly attract tourists (like us) who haven't done enough research."

Just kidding, I don't give Yelp that much credit because come on it's Yelp.There is not a full service bar to eat at so if you're a single person, you will be seated at a table.  But fortunately I'm not single, so we got a nice table. My waiter was Asian. Nothing against him at all but from the start, I knew his race would not affect the authenticity of the meal at all.They bring you bread, butter, pickles and bacon pieces.  That's strange but I went with it.  All were pretty alright.We got the 20oz rib steak Gibby's cup with herbs and spices medium rare. It was near perfect. Not he best steak ever but it hit the spot. We were able to share and had leftovers. Also got lobster tail, mushroom tart, and they came with generous portions of sides. All were delicious.We also got some wine and cognac. Generous pours. Need I say more? Oh, excellent service.I now know why people dine here, I can't get better food at Texas Roadhouse. That's not surprising. I looked around the dining room and there were both young & old people so I'm guessing it's their reputation or name that keeps them in business.  I would dine there again and highly recommend."

We came here to celebrate my husbands bday while on our first visit to Montreal.  And I'm so happy that we chose Gibbys. I would like to start this review with a huge Thank You to our server Tammy! She was so great, attentive and had such wonderful energy. We ordered fillet and lobster with a side of baked potato.  The portions are massive. Their salad was delicious. Bread was sooo good. Little things like after the salad, gelato was served to clean your pallet. Warm water with fresh lemons was served to rinse our hands after lobster.....  blew my mind. Nothing really surprises me much and very rare a particular restaurant exceeds my expectations. This one did. When Tammy found out it was my Husbands birthday, they brought out a small cake with candles!!!!! Not a piece of cake but a small entire cake.  Insane! Their dark chocolates made on premises ... Delicious!!!! Apparently all is made on premises. She then came out with a camera to take a pic of us. I'm thinking they'll post this on the restaurants site or something. Nope. She came out with 2 printed pictures each packed in Gibbys paper card. Basically, their attention to detail is nothing like I have ever seen. And we as a group dined in some amazing restaurants in NY and DC. Again, Thrilled with our experience and will recommend this place to anyone who makes it out to Montreal."

It really is the perfect place for any special occasion. I went to Gibby's a couple months back to celebrate my birthday. Although it's a little more upscale, the staff is still welcoming and friendly. It's nice to be in a place where it seems like most guests are enjoying a special night out. 1. Bread & pickles - The bread is amazingly soft and warm. The pickles are little too salty and (dare I say) I might prefer the ones at Moishe's. 2. Oysters - Deliiiicious. Very fresh and a fresh start to a steak dinner. *Citrus sorbet as palette cleanser3. Filet mignon with baked potato - Very tender and meaty. Cooked to our expectation 4. Beef wellington with Monte Carlo potato - The pastry was flaky and the beef was extraordinarily tender. Really nice mushroom sauce. The potato was so creamy and satisfying. Ended up taking half of the portion home and it still tasted delicious the next day. No room for dessert but will have to go back another time!"

So you don't have to spend another $8-$12 per side like most steak houses that are comparable. If you don't understand my post... get the lamb!  :)"

The filet was perfectly cooked to medium. The baked potato was just the right combo of flavors to set it apart from a regular baked.  The chocolate dessert was a slice of sinful richness.

From the outside the building looks quiet and small, but once we walked in we were surprised to see that it was not only full, but a very large restaurant. The dining room has a homey feel to it, like it's a popular local mom-and-pop place. The service was excellent and we really enjoyed the complementary bread, butter, bacon pieces, and pickles. The pickles were especially good - very vinegary and salty. Drinks were also great, and so was the French onion soup, although it was sweeter than I like. Portion sizes are huge here, so don't get carried away like we did. I thought the salad that came with dinner would be a normal side salad size, but it was huge - almost a meal in itself. The steak was great and cooked perfectly, and the swordfish came with a Cajun seasoning that was pretty spicy and good.We didn't have any room for dessert and left very happy (and with leftovers). While paying the bill I talked to the waitress and she explained that almost everything is made in-house, including desserts, pickles, and bread.Definitely worth a stop, especially if you're very hungry."

I must admit the location is prime: right in the heart of Old Montreal and the restaurant has been there for a very long time. I guess that's why people like it so much. 1- ordered a half a dozen of oysters, one of them was a bad oyster (could have gotten poisoned). 2- my bloody Cesar was probably one of the worst I've ever drank. 3- waiter took 5-10 minutes each time I asked him for something.4- the fillet minion was ok. Definitely not worth the money. It's overpriced and overrated. 2 stars because the valet driver was amazing."

Looks kind of cave like inside. The servers and hosts were very friendly. To start, they give you a fresh loaf of bread with butter and pickles. Yum! Our entrees came with a salad which was delicious as well. We ordered the filet mignon and rib steak. Both were accompanied by Monte Carlo (which is a baked potato twice baked with bacon, sour cream, and chives) and asparagus. I was soooo full before the entree but HAD to finish the Monte Carlo because it was Soo good. I would totally recommend anyone in Montreal to come here for a good steak dinner!

Honestly, I thought this place was overrated and over priced. I love steakhouses, but I was utterly disappointed with the flavor and taste of it. It was a little lackluster.Foodwise, I ordered the French Onion soup which was okay. I've had way better. The top was too burnt and for an onion soup, the flavor wasn't there. It was just okay. My coworker and I split the Canadian lobster tail and the Gibbys ribeye steak to try the best of both worlds. So, portions were massive! For the price you are paying, I sure hope so. The lobster was good. It was cooked well, the butter sauce was good and I had the double baked potato which I think was the best thing I ate out of everything. The steak was a great piece, but as I've mentioned, the flavor didn't really hit me. I was expecting more, especially with all the great reviews from others - but I was disappointed.The ambiance was pretty cool. It's a busy place so expect to be there for a couple of hours. We were there probably for 4. If you want an over priced, average steak, this is the place for you."

Service was good although a little slow at times but it's a huge place and the staff were doing all they could.  One nice thing is that there isn't a ""it's not my table"" philosophy - if a staff member is near you they will check in to see if you need anything.  We didn't pack dressy clothing and felt perfectly comfortable in slacks and nice shirts. I've read some of the negative reviews on here and my response to them is check out the menu before you go.  If they serve something you like you will be very pleased, if it's not what you're looking for, go somewhere else but don't blame it on the restaurant."

Scaring the cr*p out of me! my bf had to kill it in order for us to continue our meal. They did offer us a digestif as compensation.

/user_details?userid=3Mils6AfdsCgUah7jmTd1Q,Charmaine C.,"Ann Arbor, MI",2 star rating,"We had Christmas dinner at Gibby's, and experienced some lapses in service during our time there. The food was generally good. The grilled Arctic char and gibby's cut of steak were cooked well and pretty delicious. The Monte Carlo potato and the chocolate delight was yummy too! Portions were humongous. However, the escargot, Gibby's salad, gazpacho and creamed spinach were so-so and could be skipped. The wine we ordered was not bad, but we later discovered it was priced at least 3x the average commercial price for the bottle. The ambiance was also generally good. We were not rushed and were able to have good conversations and sufficient privacy. In terms of service, my friend who ordered the lamb rack got her order delivered wrong twice. Once it was overcooked to the point of being difficult to separate, the next time it was delivered almost blue inside. While our waitress was courteous and did all she could, including offering a complimentary dessert for this, these mess-ups at the kitchen side still delayed our dinner considerably and made it awkward for my friend who felt bad returning the food, and who either felt compelled to finish her meal fast or sit awkwardly without her dish while waiting for a replacement. We also experienced an incident at coatcheck, with a friend's gloves and metro card falling out of her pocket during the time. Luckily she realised her gloves were gone before we left and returned for it. The coat check lady clearly knew that the gloves had fallen out of someone's pocket as she was able to quickly retrieve the gloves from the front desk, but she had not proactively displayed the gloves or asked if anyone had lost their gloves. My friend only realised her metro card was also missing when we reached the metro station after a grueling walk in the ice and snow. We called Gibby's to request they do a search and confirm if it was with them. Gibby's front desk was rude and curt, and said they would call back IF they found the card only. As I explained that we would want to know WHETHER they found the card or not as we were waiting at the metro station and would walk back immediately if so, Gibby's front desk initially refused to do so but later cursorily said that they would. We spent some time waiting at the metro and eventually decided to just repurchase a metro card as it was late and cold. We never got a call back from them. Those incidents really ruined our Christmas night, which was a pity given that we spent quite a lot at this restaurant (almost half a thousand for a group of 6) and had looked forward to it as our festive treat for our trip. Therefore I feel extremely ambivalent about recommending this restaurant or returning again."

After securing a reservation for us, we took an Uber and we were so excited from the moment we saw the charming restaurant. The stone building held the traditions of a great restaurant. The menu is full of choices but it seemed clear to us to get the additional lobster tails with our steak which based on pictures on Yelp and our server, it was good enough for 2 people. The steak was a little more well done than the medium rare we ordered but it was good nonetheless. The lobster was tender and came on top of rice which we did not order but accompanied the lobster well. The baked potato with all the fixins already blended together in the potato is worth trying. It was my birthday and it was so sweet when our server took a picture of me and gave it to me in a Gibby's picture holder.

I started with the Gibby's salad, the rib eye steak and the Monte Carlo potato followed by the blueberry cheesecake. The steak was ok but the cheesecake was very good! It's not too sweet and it's pretty big and filling!On Friday, one friend n I had the beef wellington with the Monte Carlo potato. The first time I had it, it blew my mind!! The pastry was crispy and the inside was nice and tender! It was perfection! Since then it honestly hasn't been as good at it was the first time but it is still my favorite thing on the menu. However that night, the waitress gave my friend a beef wellington cooked medium-well, which was not what she had asked for but when she cut it it was actually more on the medium rare side which was what she wanted. Whereas I asked for medium rare and it looked more rare than medium rare. We still ate it and it was still tender but it wasn't cooked the way we wanted it. Our friend had the rack of lamb. It was breaded and very tasty. We let them know in advance that it was our friend's birthday and they provided a whole vanilla cake for free. They also took a polaroid of the group and they gave it to us...it's a nice little souvenir. The service on Friday wasn't as good as the service on Thursday. In general I did notice that the service is a lot better during the week when there are less people, which I guess makes sense. For example, it took awhile for the waiter to fill our glasses of water on Friday and we had to refill our own wine glasses but on Thursday our glasses of water and wine were always filled. One time I went and the waiter was so nice and gave me extra bacon for my leftovers and extra chocolate mints to bring home which I really appreciated. Normally I really enjoy the service here. Gibby's is good but I wouldn't say it is the best steakhouse in Montreal."

The restaurant is busy.... perhaps a good idea is to tidy the toilets a couple times a night. The carpet on the steps is so old and down right GROSS.

I also have to mention their excellent service. There was a small portion of lemon sorbet serviced after the appetizer to cleanse your taste buds and get you ready for your main course.

My wife wanted a steak and Gibby's was listed on the hotel restaurant list. We were a little concerned about what would be acceptable attire since we were running around the port all day and didn't even bring dressy clothes. At Gibby's, you can go and be comfortable in shorts & a golf shirt (like me), jeans, dressed up or anywhere in between.The building and decor are phenomenal, even if you show up without reservations (like us) and upstairs is full...downstairs is really nice also!The wait staff were very professional, but would read the tables and be goofy / humorous if that was how your party was. We had Michel as our server and his interactions with us and busting my 14 year old son's chops was wonderful, but all still with superb service. The food was great; two of us had Chicken Kiev which was really good, one Beef Wellington which was cooked to perfection and very tasty, and one teriyaki steak which was a thick, juicy and perfectly prepared medium. Deserts were also outstanding!This restaurant is not cheap, but compared to lower quality places nearby, the slightly higher price is well worth it since you get such a higher quality meal and service.

/user_details?userid=iJ_sn6RfwO5unR9YgFTd4Q,Camille R.,"Côte-des-Neiges, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Went here after many friends telling me this place was excellent and I have to say I was quite disappointed. My steak arrived over cooked when I asked for medium rare. By the time I got the plate back I wasnt even hungry anymore since I had stuffed myself with the Monte Carlo potato and the bread at the beginning. Moishe's is definitely better. Not sure I would give them a second chance.

This place is old fashioned and reminded me of the type of steak houses my grandparents used to take me to as a kid. I love the value for the amount and quantity of food they give you. I had the mustard rack of lamb. The lamb tasted great and was cooked perfectly. The entree came with a delicious fresh salad, the monte cristo baked potato which was delicious, and perfectly cooked fresh broccoli. I had a bit of my friends rib eye and it was one of the best steaks I have had. The homemade chocolate dinner mints at the end were a nice touch. This place does dinner right and it tastes amazing. I'm making another trip to the city soon just to eat here again!"

We ordered 3 steaks and some shrimp and a bottle of wine. The steaks were over cooked the first time so we didn't get to taste them. Then they came back and they tasted like low quality oily steak. The shrimp tasted like one big garlic, the server was no where to be found so we had to get up and find croutons, napkin, and silver ware. Oh and to top off our night they spilled steak bloody sauce all over our white $4000 leather jacket and shirt.The nastiest restaurant, and worst steak in our life! They said they would clean the jacket; but they didn't follow through, and even then white leather doesn't clean that  well when the stain is blood and steak sauce!!!"

They also serve amazing bread with this cottage cheese dip and amazing pickles reminded me of Home!  With the steak I ordered the mashed potatoes it was so creamy and good .My boyfriend had a steak with a bone and it was the best marbleized steak with so much flavor pouring out of it.

It was my husband's birthday and he loves steak and apparently Gibbs's is an institution. The atmosphere was something from the 70's, and seemed dingy and dark. While the portions were large, nothing was very tasty. It all seemed like something from a 80's era Sizzler.  My kabob's were cooked to my request but lacked flavor. The Gibby's salad was just a standard salad with a basic dressing, not sure why everyone raves about it. They did provide a huge amount of pickles at beginning of the meal, which my husband appreciated. They also provide a palate cleanser of lemon sorbet (too sweet) between servings.  The recommended wine was barely palatable. Our waitress was kind but she had so many tables to attend to, we hardly saw her. For more than 250 CAD$ I expected delicious and just got ho hum."

We had escargot and shrimp bisque for appetizers. Everything was cooked perfectly. The service was terrific, friendly but not too over-the-top. We had mentioned that we were visiting Montreal for my wife's birthday and they brought her a birthday cake, not a piece of cake, nor a cupcake, complete with candle. A very nice touch. We left totally satisfied and grateful that we make the trip to Gibby's.The building is beautiful exposed stone.

We went for dinner in a Friday night, we booked 3 hours before so I cannot complain about that. We didn't have the best table, but the ambiance inside is very good wherever you are sitting. The restaurant is very cozy and warm and you really feel like back in the days when you are inside.About the food... I'm a steak lover, so when we arrived and saw the menu I was pleased to see that many options. The rib steak ""gibby's cut"" is amazing! I loved it and it was perfectly cooked. The portion was huge and the sides complements were also well served.We ordered creme brûlée for dessert and it was also not disappointing at all.The menu appetizers looks good as well, but if you are having a steak do not order anything extra or you will not finish everything.Service was not the best, but in a Friday night there're not too many restaurants that can offer excellent service; it was not bad at all, but for the price you're paying, of course you expect an excellent service.This is my best recommendation for a steakhouse in Montreal so far, I will definitely come back!"

The potatoes, salad and asparagus that accompany the entree were always great.  Gibby's cut makes steaks from other Montreal restaurants look like a joke.  The difference is unmistakable."

In fact, the steak here was better than most of the steaks I've had at ""upscale"" steak houses.To be honest, they got me at the bacon and homemade dill pickles (which you get as soon as you sit down).

Very tender.  My wife had the eggplant parm, which she said was tasty. For desert, she had the creme brûlée.  The custard was perfect, but the sugar topping was not crunchy as it should be.  I had the chocolate desert, which was over the top.  A little pricey, but not to the point where you question the value.  The place could use a little freshening up in terms of the carpeting."
/user_details?userid=zqoFIokUaNpvBimkoJXHEw,Andrew S.,"San Ramon, CA",4 star rating,"Went here for business meal in mid December and the place was packed.  We were able to get a table for 6 but quarters were tight.  There were some very energetic and interesting waiters & waitresses but, ours was soft spoken but attentive.  Gibby's is in a 200 year old building with a rich history ... tall people need to be very careful. The historic building and old world charm of the restaurant really makes you feel like you're in a different time.  But, the menu prices brought me right back to 2015 (a strong US dollar helped make it reasonable).  The food lives up to the reputation as a high end chop house.  We all had steaks of some kind and everyone enjoyed.  Starting with the fresh baked bread that keeps getting replace with a full loaf and the famous Gibby's salad - which comes with anchovies and is similar Caesar.  Both were delicious.  I had the Beef Wellington rare.  My first time trying this dish and it was terrific.  They use a filet cut that was so fresh, it actually came across as almost tasteless.  The mushroom & pastry coating were great. But, the mushroom gravy was amazing.  If it was appropriate, I would have drank some straight from the gravy boat.  Bottom line is that Gibby's is a high end restaurant in a historic part of old Montreal.  It's a fancy place and you pay ""fancy prices.""  But, the food is very good & worth the money.

I've only been here on rare occasion, for special celebrations, and the last time was over 30 years ago. I brought my daughters here tonight so they can experience one of the city's finer establishments. And I was so glad at it was just as I remembered it to be: gentile and refined with a sense of tradition and history the moment you walk in.First, how wonderful that they offer free valet parking. I made it known that we were just coming in for desserts and coffee, and they were still happy to park my car for me (note: as many may know, parking is a royal pain in the patootie on a busy Friday night at 8pm in the summer! And nearby lots cost $15 to park in them). We were told they could seat is in 30 minutes, so we strolled the old port and Place Jacques Cartier Square, marveling in the business and vibrancy of this great city. Upon returning to the restaurant, we were immediately seated. Tables clothed in white linens, leather-bound dessert menus at our seats. The waitresses were all dressed in period uniforms from the last century. Oh, and the food was divine! My youngest had the epitome of a chocoholic's fantasy: the Chocolate Delight,which was a decadent chocolate mousse-like cake with a crunchy chocolate topping, plated on a gorgeous swirled sauce. She said it was the best dessert she ever had. Meanwhile, my other kid and I shared the Crepe Cerise Jubilee: a thin, delicate crepe with vanilla ice cream with lots of cherries (and some blueberries). This was, hands down, the best dessert I've ever had. Ever. I was in heaven. My cappuccino was too strong for me, but my daughters enjoyed their French teas. And how lovely, to get some dark mint chocolate medallions on our table as a complimentary treat. Very lovely gesture."

It's simple and flavorful. 20 oz bone in so go easy on the apps as the portions are of a bonafide steakhouse. The Monte Carlo potato was a big win with the steak. Essentially twice cooked mashed potato stuffed back into the skin. The dining room had all the steakhouse charm with a quaint touch of Old Montreal.

The portions here are HUGE so I opted to skip the appetizer.  Besides you also get a starter included with your meal (salad, tomatoes and onions or tomato gazpacho).  I opted for the gazpacho which despite being tomato based was loaded with lots of other vegetables such as green peppers which really upped the flavour of the dish.  Be warned though that there is lots of garlic in the gazpacho so it is not the best choice if you're there for date night!I opted to have the lobster tails as my main with a Monte Carlo potato on the side.  The Monte Carlo is a baked potato with sour cream, bacon and chives and it is definitely a cut above a normal baked potato.  The lobster just fell apart and when dipped in butter was like a little taste of heaven.I finished off with blueberry cheesecake for dessert and the texture was just right.  Also it didn't taste too rich.  The waiter also brought mint chocolates at this point too which was a nice way to finish off a good meal.The service was pretty good except for a couple of minor errors where they brought us the wrong items.  That being said they did correct the mistake quickly.  In the end it was a good meal but given the prices here it's the kind of place where you come to celebrate a special occasion."

These were accompanied by rice, asparagus and a baked potato (either plain or Monte Carlo). The meal also included a starter (Gibby's salad, gaspacho or tomatoes/onion dish). I ordered the gaspacho (chilled, tomato-based blend of fresh vegetables and herbs), which was light and simple, though a bit on the garlicky side. My only complaint was that the bowl was too big! I would have been satisfied with half of what they gave me.  My mum ordered the salad, which was a bit plain but very fresh.  My dad started with grilled jalapeno sirloin sausage, served with mango chutney. I had a bite and found them to be nothing extraordinary. The only thing that stood out for me was how spicy they were, but the meat itself was lacking in flavour.  He then had the Rib steak (Gibby's cut), which he raved about for the rest of the night - fresh, full of flavour and about an inch thick.We ended the night by sharing profiteroles for dessert. This dessert is meant to be for one person, but it's huge - with the sizeable meal portions, there is no way I could have eaten 3 of those! They were good, but I'm pretty sure they were frozen, which was a bit disappointing.  The wine list was OK, but not great if ordering by the glass.Overall, a great meal, but a bit over-priced. The service was OK but not fantastic.  I recommend Gibby's if you want to treat yourself, or for special occasions. Get the scampi!"

Ambiance and decor is definitely old school, maybe a bit more crowded than I'd like with most of the way the tables are laid out, but we were a large party and sat towards the back in a slightly more spacious area. Steak was excellent, cooked perfectly. Pretty good drink selection too from beer to wines and also a full liquor bar."
/user_details?userid=QdQWkr7T-SCkklEQPCS9jA,Drew B.,"Owasso, OK",5 star rating,Met some friend's here during the Grand Prix Weekend. The place was popping! Got here around 7:40 for our 8 PM reservation. They had the table ready and seated us on the spot. Ordered some drinks and a few appetizers. I had the escargot and they were perfect! For dinner I went with the swordfish that was fresh and delicious. My wife had the rib eye and it too was fantastic. Great flavor! It did seem kind of weird that the whole upstairs lounge looking area was empty. You'd think they would get a bigger kitchen and some more staff and fill that place up too when big events are in town.In any case it was delicious and the decor both in and out was very unique. Get a reservation on the weekends though because this place was BUSY!
/user_details?userid=eXLmI1TE6qMAGoVQowRDcQ,Rob C.,"Belle River, Canada",2 star rating,"2 stars is accurate for the experience we had especially since our stay in Montreal has been a culinary extravaganza. The good: Napa wine and crown ManhattansThe average: the service; wasn't up to par with every other restaurant we visited in terms of sincerity and helpfulness. The bad: my ""Gibby cut"" was overdone and my wife's fillet was underdone-they were sent back. We were 1 of 3 tables (that we witnessed next to us) that had ""temperature"" issues. The manager did not charge us for the Rockefeller oysters which, for sure, were made with an ""Italian herb mix"" because they smelled and tasted like pizza.  Also, I pointed out to the waiter that 1) there are lots of spider webs around the picture frames that have been there a while because of the dust build up, and 2) the centipedes crawling in and out of the old stone wall were...not appealing (another table next to us, they did not have temperature issues, said on previous visits that they have had centipedes jump from the wall onto their table). Unfortunately, we must have hit a bad night because the Yelp reviews are spectacular, plus, two different friends from home strongly recommended this place, but, we can't deny what we had or experienced...we do not recommend this restaurant nor will we return. I hate to write poor reviews, but, with the high quality of food and service we've experienced in the last week we cannot justify the risk of another sub par meal when the city is filled with fabulous cuisine."

It's been a while since we went, but I'm fairly certain I can remember what we got!To start, I went with the Gazpacho and my husband got the salad. The croutons were AMAZING.We had planned on splitting a steak, but in the end, we splurged and each got the Filet Mignon (I got the petite). They were perfectly cooked and we both cleared our plates.For dessert, we split the Crème Brûlée and Gibbys Chocolate Delight (a medley of smooth, dark and crunchy).We were completely stuffed after, but it was totally worth it.

Dont forget to add croutons and bacon.  The pickles and especially the bread put out on the table are delicious.

We started with shrimp cocktail and the salads that came with dinner- both delicious. I ordered the Filet Mignon and added the Canadian Lobster Tail- absolutely incredible, the best best steak and lobster I have ever had.  My husband felt the same about his dish, he ordered the sirloin steak and loved it.  The waiter was great and service was amazing.

Our party waited over 45 minutes after our reservation time to be seated, and the host was incredibly rude, blaming us for not checking in with him, when we had gone to see him 3 times prior to being seated.  Several other patrons had been waiting 30 minutes past their reservation time as well.The manager unfortunately did not help matters.  Recognizing the issue at hand, he offered complimentary drinks or dessert, but his demeanour quickly became highly offensive when after providing the drinks, he said ""Are you smiling now? Give me a smile."" That said, the food and wait staff have always been and continue to be exemplary, but the host and manager have been enough to dissuade me from ever going back to a family favourite.  Very disappointing."

Both were pleasing and mine was particularly strong. Dinner was Filet Mignon Wellington for me and I don't think it could have been better. A light flaky crust quickly have way to an expertly prepared steak. My girlfriend ordered the rib eye and it was just slightly over done (we still enjoyed about 80% of it). Dessert was perhaps the best I have ever had. Crepe filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with blueberries and raspberries had me full to bursting!

We went there on a Friday night, expecting a wait to be seated and another way to find a parking space. We were wrong on both counts. They have valet parking and we were seated immediately. Our waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgeable, considering my lack of fluency in French. The restaurant is in old town, sat in brick, which of the fashion of the area. The interior carries out the same thing in this relatively large restaurant. Although large, each table achieved a degree of intimacy. A unique feature of Gibbys is the fact that all dishes are served on pewterware. Never seen this before, but it did add an elegant touch. Uniquely, on the table was a bowl of sourdill whole kosher pickles and a small cup of bacon bits.For appetizers, my partner and I shared mussels Provençal and escargot. The former was outstanding and the latter excellent. We shared the rack of lamb, which was huge. They split the dish for us each receiving four lamb chops. They were just delicious. Even though it was split, each of us was allowed to pick our own side dishes. The baked stuffed potato was a standout. Even though we shared the meal, we were both too stuffed for dessert.All in all, this was definitely a five-star experience!"

Three floors with a mix of modern/contemporary decor. Wood on inside with big fireplace. Stonewalls covered with beautiful vines on the outside. Patio closed today due to down pour of rain. Quite the fine dining experience! Service was on par with knowledgeable staff. Bathrooms located on top floor where there is a lounge or the bottom floor where there is rooms for lager group events. Knowing for their Rib-eye and strake- also has a seafood option. We started off with Fresh baked bread with creamy butter and large dill pickle. Your choice of wine or cocktail. Next can the Appetizers and ended up getting the regular green salad and others tomato /onion. Portions were not small- so pace yourself and be prepared to eat. I got the Steak of Dianne with an amazing gravy glaze that cannot be explained with worlds. Meat was cooked to preference. Came with rice/ veggies and lobster tail. Others ordered 1/2lb of lobster which looked and tasted like it came fresh from the sea that day! They gave us lemon glacé to cleanse our palate between meals and then when we thought it could be enough- there was dessert. Known for their chocolate moist cake and featured key lime pie. Choice of coffee or after dinner drinks. We were so full - we had to sit for a bit longer in which staff did not mind they were quite friendly and entertaining. One ordered the chocolate bourbon latte and there's was a cool ""fireshow"" to go with it. Our waiter did not disappoint. Can buy local sauces and dill pickle in jars of u so choose.

While the place can get crowded and the atmosphere can get a little loud, the tables are large enough and far enough apart that you don't feel too constrained. The building (inside and out) has a very old-world feel - lots of stone and wood and fireplaces. It was very warm and welcoming.But the food is where Gibby's was really perfect. Let's start with the bread - amazing. A hot loaf of pretzely/sourdoughy bread arrives at your table with lots of butter, pickles and bacon. Very fine. I was tempted to ask for a loaf to bring home with me. Our meals (I think all meals?) came with a salad-like starter option. We picked the regular salad option (although there were others), and the salad was plentiful and had a very delicious and light dressing. After the salad, we were given little cups of lemon sherbert, which was light, tasty and the perfect amount. The entree was incredible. Both my husband and I had the petit filet mingon, which was cooked perfectly, topped with garlic and herbs, and accompanied by mouth-watering, burst-of-flavor-in-your-mouth asparagus stalks and (we chose) a plentifully large baked potato. The filet was as easy to cut as butter and melted in our mouths. It was definitely one of the best steaks I have ever had and, while we didn't take anything home, they certainly didn't skimp on the portions. We finished up with the chocolate mousse which (again) was plentiful and mouth-wateringly good. With the bill they also give you some mint-dark-chocolate squares, which were a nice treat. The service was excellent. Our waiters were professional and answered questions. At the end of the meal, Gibby's (like other restaurants we saw in Montreal) settles your bill right at the table with a hand-held electronic system which is fast and easy. Overall, the experience was great from start to finish, and I'm so glad Gibby's was recommended to us."

Their bread is so delicious, kind of like pretzel bread, and they also give you some tasty homemade pickles, and even a little dish of fresh bacon bits. What more could you ask for? Fresh bread dipped in bacon bits? Yes, please. We (two of us) ordered some French onion soup to share, it was cheesy and delicious. We also ordered a ribeye to share with their Monte Carlo potatoes, and it was more than enough for both of us. Their ribeye is cooked perfectly at medium rare, with an excellent crust, perfectly marbled, garlic & spices in abundance, and no shortage of juicy flavor. Their house salad is great, throw some of those bacon bits on there too along with their house garlic croutons. If you don't have room for some of their delicious creme brûlée, don't fret, because you can satisfy your sweet tooth with a bite of their complimentary homemade dark chocolate with a hint of mint and the perfect balance of sweetness. Their wine list is to be envied by most places, particularly their delectable Bordeaux available by the glass that pair perfectly with any steak. This place is a MUST VISIT in Montreal."

I tried to buy a bottle or two, but they were repackaging it and didn't have any on hand at the time.  I'm sorry to say the salad dressing was the highlight of the evening and things went south from there.My coworker and I ordered the beef wellington next.  I have never tasted a more bland and utterly inedible piece of meat in my life... my coworker felt the same.  I wouldn't have taken a second bite if my boss wasn't paying $50 for the thing.  It tasted like it was barely sprinkled with salt - no other marination whatsoever.  The accompanying mushroom gravy, A1, and Worcestershire didn't help either.  I couldn't imagine how much worse it could taste reheated, so I most certainly did not take the rest to go.Another coworker who ordered the rib eye steak was also not impressed, even after dousing it in the sauces mentioned above.  Another coworker order the fish course, which she was not fond of either.  Our team is from Texas and we've had some truly great steaks there for half the cost of Gibby's.  The service, however, was excellent.  I couldn't bring myself to mention to our kind and attentive waiter how disappointed I was about my main course. If you've absolutely got to experience Gibby's, have the salad, a side dish and dessert and stay for the cozy atmosphere and great service."

/user_details?userid=felKiMPaxPNsC3kRZBghfA,Mick A.,"Sydney, Australia",3 star rating,"We came on a good friends recommendation. We took an 8.45pm booking.On arrival the restaurant was fully occupied so we dined downstairs - which was also full. The welcome and service was friendly attentive and informative. We were given ample time to select our options. I do like the initially serving of the pickles...what a healthy and different starter.An important aspect to selecting a main course is that it comes with a three starter option of which we choose a salad and a soup. This is built into the pricing of the main dish. The menu is dominated by fish and steak.We really enjoyed the gazpacho soup - the salad was more basic. On the night my partner was looking for a white meat option and choose the only one, Chicken Kiev. On reflection not a wise decision given the focus of the menu.....this dish was ordinary. Conversely the Fillet Mignon was a splendid choice. Presented to perfection as was the taste.....a very substantial piece and was adequate for us both to share. We shared a crepe, the 'Jubilee'- it was all ice cream and limited crepe.A good wine list and we enjoyed an Amarone, a reserve - it was drinking well. We did have to request that it be decanted.This is not a fine establishment - it is all about the red meat (and the fish).....come with an appetite and you will not be disappointed."

Gibby's has a very large wine selection with a wide range of prices. The onion soup was superb. The salad was fresh and served with a homemade house dressing. We had the osco buco and the petite filet with grilled lobster tail. All fantastic. We met some locals while dining there and they told us this is the place to go. I would recommend giving Gibby's a try. Make reservations as the restaurant is very busy."

/user_details?userid=cbBxBySpq87KPiLG25N76Q,Daniel H.,"Costa Mesa, CA",3 star rating,"Twas the night of a bachelor party, and Montreal was stirring. We'd eaten many hours ago, and our stomachs were purring. A top three steak house and dishes seemingly hard to beat; I think I would've enjoyed my meal had they just turned down the heat!Poetry seems fun as I write this review from the air on my way back from a weekend full of debauchery in Montreal. Gibby's. Oh Gibby's. I'm torn on the rating here. We were a large group in a very crowded basement dining room (had a country club grill room feel to it).Eight of us seated at a round table that would've been optimal for six. The trouble came when the servers had to get to the far side against the wall, a feat only accomplished by squeezing between chairs and reaching over others. Staff didn't come around much in the beginning though, and we probably sat around for 20 minutes after the drinks came before ordering any food. Meh.Things picked up once the meal was served, so on to the important part; the meal.Here were the orders around the room:- Petit filet mignon- 2 lbs lobster- NY strip- sirloin en croute- tuna steak- salmon- halibutThey provided a lovely bib for our lobster eater; he looked like he was going to the dentist. Funny stuff. We all enjoyed our food. My tuna was expertly prepared. So you're wondering, why am I torn?Although the featured items were great (minus one issue with an overcooked sirloin en croute), the dish also included a choice of rice pilaf/baked potato/baked potato Monte Carlo and asparagus. A lot of steakhouses only serve sides a la carte, so this was a perceived plus...Most of us ordered the rice pilaf, which the sever described as wild rice. It tasted great, but was nothing more than plain rice with some specs in it. We each received three spears of asparagus. Herein lies my issue. A top steakhouse can have real wild rice and can afford to be a little more generous with the vegetable, no?In the end, I felt that at least my dish could've been something I made myself. That's not what I expect at a top establishment. So what I felt I got was a really good tuna steak with some rice and a little asparagus that I could've made and spent less money on, all the while enjoying a drastically more comfortable dining environment. The restroom area was at least 15 degrees cooler.The restaurant did comp our coffees because of the overcooked steak, and they also made a complimentary special cake for our special bachelor, which was very, very nice. Unfortunately this place left me feeling underwhelmed, especially in comparison to some of the other steakhouse experiences I've had.All things considered, I respectfully submit three stars for Gibby's. A fine place, but I'd likely look for a new place given the chance to return to Montreal."

Gibby's house salad was just ok. I ordered the beef Wellington medium rare one half of it was completely raw and non edible. Wife ordered the Gibbys rib medium rare  it was huge and a bit over cooked. The monte cristo potatoes were very good. Portion size was large so even if the temp control was on point we would never of finished the meal anyway. We saw almost every one walk out with doggie bags.

An olde stone building with lots of history, reminiscent of an olde tavern. The atmosphere is warm w/ a sense of luxury.We came for 6:00, promptly seated by friendly waitstaff.Bread, butter, pickles...... & bacon bits served with every meal. Very tasty.The french onion soup was very good, if I had to nit pick....too much cheese.Salads were very fresh, crisp lettuce, onions & very nice house vinaigrette dressing. In between courses a seldom seen citrus Sorbet, an old classic!We opted for the smaller rib steak, even the small was at least 16 oz. The Gibbys cut would have been far too much beef.The steaks were cooked perfect with just enough seasoning not to overpower the flavour.We recommend Gibbys steak house for great food, atmosphere & dining experience.Please be aware Gibbys is not a cheap steakhouse, it is worth the visit. A table for 2 could easily spend $250."
/user_details?userid=le4ojs4va6f4WSjKZEF7wQ,Jenny Y.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Two words: clam chowder. The BEST I've ever had and I've been from east to west of Canada with no restaurant that can compare to here!! It is so rich and not too filling, with so much hearty meat (seafood ofc), seasoned so perfectly! My mouth is watering just remembering back to it. For the steaks - they are HUGE. Keep in mind, they don't mention the size (oz) of the steaks on the menu so I did not expect the big portions at all. My boyfriend ordered the Ribeye Gibby's cut which turned out to be 19oz, WITHOUT the bone. I ordered the NY Sirloin which was 16oz!!! Perfectly cooked to our preference and oh-so juicy. We were both wow-ed by our first bites. For the sides, we both got the Gibbys salad which was okay. The monte carlo potatoes on the other hand - definitely a treat if you want something more savoury than regular baked potatoes. It was recommended to us by our waitress and it did not disappoint. I really wish I had room for dessert, because that menu looked pretty good too. But with the shared clam chowder & a steak each, my boyfriend and I had some leftovers and were beyond stuffed. The service is amazing too - free valet, seated right away without a reservation and our waitress really took her time to go through the menu with us. 1 star taken off my rating because the restaurant was more than half empty yet the host sat us down right beside the workers station. So it was a teeny bit annoying trying to enjoy the ambiance when workers are constantly coming to the wall behind our table to wait around, dump their dishes or prepare their settings. Other than that, the food was amazing so will definitely be coming back."

I was very grateful as they were busy and did it with a smile.  Our server was excellent and very friendly...explained everything along the way.  I ordered the Beef Wellington and it was delicious!  I could not believe the size of the filet they give you in this dish.

I've enjoyed my share of excellent steaks at top-notch steakhouses in NYC, Chicago, and other major cities. Dry-aged, prime beef well-seasoned and cooked to perfection...perhaps my expectations were too high for Gibby's, but my wife and I were not impressed with the experience. We were seated promptly for our 7:30 reservation on a Thursday evening, given menus, then ignored for 15 minutes. Seriously?  It isn't like they were packed tonight. After finally placing our orders, they brought out a bowl of good garlic pickles, small loaf of bread (nothing special), and 1/2 a stick of butter plopped onto a small searing dish. Wife had the gazpacho & I had the Gibby salad, although the anchovies I requested were not to be found; otherwise, both were serviceable if nothing special. For dinner, I had the Gibby's rib steak. Totally lacking in salt, pretty clearly not dry-aged - I do better with Costco rib eyes on the grill @ home. Decent ambiance, but no way was it worth the $145 for two entrees + two glasses of wine."

And the usually quick service was so slow that we noticed the table beside us turned TWICE in the time it took us to receive our main course. Our appetizers were delicious - when we finally received them. I had the  smoked salmon and my husband had the mussels.     Both were perfection.  The main course arrived quite some time later and while my husband enjoyed his grilled salmon, my filet mignon was cold and under-cooked to the point that I could barely choke it down.  It was so bloody, it made a soupy mess on my plate - I had asked for medium-well.Dessert was somewhat redeeming.  My husband opted for the sorbet trio, which was the perfect light ending to his meal.  I chose the more decadent chocolate delight, which was scrumptious - though had I actually eaten my main course I probably would not have been able to finish it.Overall, the evening was a disappointment because I know how good Gibby's CAN be. It just sucks that they were having an off night on our anniversary :-("

It feels like the type of fancy restaurant geared to families in the 1970s, but not one thing has changed since then. You get a bowl of pickles and a stick of butter with your bread to start. And they go around individually serving croutons for your salad like they're still a novelty. Food is pretty simple but if you want to dazzle it up, they'll give you a little bowl of capers to spoon on top of anything you order. In the end we really enjoyed ourselves because we got to peak into a world we never see. A world where culinary progress stopped dead in it's tracks sometime before I was born.

They're on the saltier side but damn good tasting. The waiter also brings out a bowl of grated Parmesan (I believe) cheese, which left me confused at first as it's obviously not meant for pickles.My drink, a Bombay Sapphire and tonic came out in 2 separate glasses, one with ice and gin in it and another with the tonic water, you mix it yourself from there, which I quite enjoyed.For an appetizer I had escargot, they came out boiling hot in a wonderful Bourguignonne sauce. Which after eating the tasty little snails I sopped up with the excellent bread they give you.Your main course is served with a choice of soup, their house salad or some sort of vegetable dish. I chose their house salad, the Gibby's salad. For the life of me I can't remember the dressing it came with but this where the Parmesan comes into play, it goes great with the salad and I do remember that I ate every last piece of it.For my entree I had the Gibby's cut rib steak, medium-rare of course, with an au poivre sauce because. It came with steamed asparagus (my favorite vegetable with steak) which was cooked perfectly and the best potato I've ever had in my life, they call it the Monte Carlo, it's double baked and has bacon, sour cream and chives in it. It's a little piece of starchy crack. I could have eaten 10 of them no problem but alas I had a beautiful steak to take care of. Speaking of the steak, it was cooked to perfection and amazingly tender and flavorful, same with the au poivre sauce, just perfect. One of the top 5 steaks I've had in my life.With dinner I originally wanted a glass of Beaujolais-Villages because I'm a fan of very light red wines. The waiter, a prefect representation of a steakhouse waiter (and I mean that in the best possible way) did not agree with my selection and instead advised me to try the Pinot Noir, he was right, it went great with my steak.And because I intended to gorge myself I got the creme brulee for desert along with a B&B, like the rest of the meal, it was great.On a side note, the menu at Gibby's is in English however our waiter was definitely a Francophone, there wasn't any problem with ordering though. The portable credit card machine was in French however and because my French is incredibly limited I had to ask for assistance with it."

I live in New York City and this restaurant is a good 5-6 hour drive, some fridays after work i legitametly wrestle with the idea of going up for the night just to have Gibbys. The service is top notch, atmosphere is extremely rustic, almost a medieval feel but i love that. Stone walls with raw wood trim everywhere, roaring fireplace, the works.  Everytime i go i get the escargot to start which is the best ive had and the steak en croute. Its an expensive dish, no doubt, but extremely tasty and worth the hefty asking price of $42.00. Its basically breaded steak cooked to perfection, served with a warm mustard peppercorn sauce on the side. Bliss. If i were to have one gripe about this place and it is only one, that is their beer selection. Nothing from canada on tap. As a matter of fact there is nothing on tap at all.

The total bill (including tax and tip) was about $2700.  We asked the waitress if we could have a round of Jameson shots on the house as we paid the bill.  She said she had to ask the manager - she returned and informed us that our request was declined.When you spend $2,700 on dinner, I don't think asking for a round of shots on the house is unreasonable.  The previous night, Weinstein and Gavino's gave us a free round of shots without us even asking, and our bill was significantly lower than $2,700.Bottom line: the food was excellent and so was our service, but the management is low class."

I ordered the smoked salmon and my boyfriend had the NY steak. I felt like the salmon was over-smoked. I wanted the Monte Carlo potato, and asked to have no bacon added in (I don't eat meat), but the server said the potatoes were already pre-cooked. Kinda sucked. The bread roll was very good, sweet and served alongside with bacon bits, and pickles. They also have an extensive wine menu. It was a busy night when we went- the restaurant was packed, so staff wasn't as attentive to our table. Yummy chocolates at the end of the meal. Overall, we felt the food was fine, but overpriced."

Arriving at around 6 on a Friday night, we were seated immediately. We ordered the clam chowder, the crab cakes, the mustard encrusted steak and scampi on the side. We started the meal off with complimentary bread and pickles. Pickles get me every time. Then came the surprise of the night- lemon granita to cleanse the palate! Unexpected, but most welcome. The clam chowder was very good and hearty, plenty of seafood and potatoes. Definitely made my insides smile. The crab cakes on the other hand were a let-down. For 17$, you get 2 small crab cakes with a red chili aioli. The crab cakes tasted like burnt breadcrumbs more than anything. Definitely made my insides sad.I'm not much of a red meat eater, but according to my boyfriend the steak was good, perfectly cooked to his medium-rare-liking. The steak came with a ""Gibby's salad"" and a Monte Cristo potato.The service was impeccable- our server Cynthia was fun and attentive.

The place has an old-world charm. And considering what a nightmare parking in downtown Montreal is, the valet parking is a blessing. Ambience inside is pleasant. Tables are not packed too tightly, and so it didn't feel cluttered, and is conducive for conversation. Service staff were attentive and cheerful. As for food, the steak is outstanding - with a smoky flavour and cooked to perfection. However I have to say that I find the portions too large. My wife chose the petit filet mignon and it turned out to be a better size. The Provence prawns served with garlic butter was equally outstanding. So was the lobster tails. The desserts are also of huge portions each. The chocolate cake was memorable even though none of us could finish it. The coffee flambé (Spanish, Irish or Brazil) were wonderful - ""performed"" (mixed and flambé) there and then by the servers. A dramatic end to top the evening. Price of food and wine is on the high side for casual dining. In our case, inclusive of 2 bottles of wine our bill worked our to $100 per person. I would still come back for the special occasions."

In addition, the filet tasted like medium pot roast even though I ordered medium rare.4) Waitress took back beef wellington and said that she didn't charge for it, but when the check came, she still charged me for a ""salad' for the sides that came with the meal.5) My wife's rib-eye steak was extremely fatty and lacking flavor6) Wine was no better that Trader Joe's 3 buck chuck... anyone who knows trader joes knows that their wine is amazing for that price.

Found this on Yelp and disappointed doesn't say enough.  Shocking that this restaurant has received so many favorable reviews.  The food was greasy, tasteless, old fashioned, and of low quality.  Not one of the dishes ordered for the table was acceptable.  Both salads were filled with yellow iceberg lettuce.  The shrimp appetizer was surprisingly cooked well but swimming in butter. Beef Wellington was greasy, unseasoned, and extremely over cooked. It is served with a gravy that is most definitely poured right out of jar. Lobster tails were cooked reasonably well but totally unseasoned and tasteless. Lobster tails themselves had no flavor (I'd guess that they are frozen and not fresh). Accompanying the dinners were sides of white rice (Gibby's refers to white rice as Rice Pilaf) and over cooked asparagus.  I suspect the kitchen is run in a similar fashion to a cafeteria rather than a fresh cooking restaurant. In a city with so many wonderful restaurants I have no idea how this place still exists.  On top of the terrible food the service was also poor. Our waitress seemed as if she did not know what to do with children at her table and came off as quite rude.  She came by no less than 4 times to ""remind"" my 4 yr. old to sit down.  As with any child he cannot sit for extended periods of time. He stood in place (holding a conversation not even eating) and this seemed to bother our server immensely. I didn't really think about her constant reminders until a guest at the table behind us leaned in to share that she thought our server was being extremely rude with her ""constant hounding of our son"".  Regardless, I do not let bad service ruin the night. I am a former chef and when I go out to eat I am there to eat. The food ruined the experience.  This sadly was one of the worst meals I've had out in a while.    The only positive is the building.

We ordered the rib eye and Gibby's cut.  I am giving a high rating because our waiter was fantastic to us.  The wine was excellent.  I enjoyed the sorbet.  At the end, our waiter gave us dark chocolate that we all liked.  The place had a lot of tourists, which is nice.  The decor was rustic.  The waitstaff in the front was a little stoic to me... meaning, there wasn't a welcoming greeting nor even an attempt to be welcoming.  Weird huh?  Like I said, the best part was that our waiter was sincere and really nice.  Forgot his name but our table was all the way in the back.. so maybe you can ask for that area for seating? hehe.One of the most recommended sides was the monte carlo loaded baked potato. that can be shared.  I also had the escargot, YUM!  Reservations must be made in advance."

Gazpacho was really not good so I couldn't finish even a third; Beef Wellington was rare when I ordered medium rare (but still good one!); Gibby's cut rib steak was in much lower quality than before (better at Baton Rouge if I may); Monte Carlo potato was bland but salty; Rockefeller oysters were bitter (having assumed that they put too much liquor into the sauce or cheese), so we returned those and had the fresh ones but they were pretty much the same.After the waiter was told that our last time visit ""together"" was a year ago, his manners became changed and kind of rude/condescending thereafter. What a strange guy. Gibby's service couldn't be better before if I remember correctly. Too bad. Compared to the previous experiences, only the decor (&servers' uniform) is still lovely.

The setting is different than the vast majority in NYC, and surrounding areas. It has an old feel with the entrance being hidden in a stone walkway to a courtyard. As you enter you notice the exposed framework made from big, heavy timber, warmly lit, and a feeling you just went back a hundred and fifty years. The waiters wear, I'm assuming, a sort of traditional uniform and were the most polite and bubbly servers we had in Montreal. The recommendations were spot on, the spicy sirloin sausage was great and the Oysters Rockefeller were insanely good. I pride myself on my impeccable manners, thanks mom, but I definitely grabbed a second before confirming everyone got at least one. I ordered the center cut fillet, and the waitress coerced me into the Monte Carlo potato; I buckled, but assured my self I would only eat 1/2 of it. Turns out I took it right to face, killed it, it was amazing... the fillet was cooked perfectly, and with a table of 8, all ordering a various steaks, each of ours were cooked perfectly. We were all discussing how amazing the dinner was, thinking the ride was over. We then ordered some Irish coffees... they rolled over what appeared to be a dessert cart with a big flame in the middle... they caramelized sugar on the rim, lit the whiskey in the glass on fire (then added a little more). Added the coffee, fresh whip cream, and then lit Irish Mist on fire, and poured the flaming liquor into the best Irish Coffee I've ever had.  Gibby's is the Truth."

/user_details?userid=0Bm2BA66nUSJtgpOI9XBPQ,Pete J.,"Naples, FL",4 star rating,"A quaint building houses one of Canada's best steak houses. Rural old-world charm. Wooden tables, comfortable plush chairs and dimly-lit dining areas give this restaurant a romantic feel.Reservations weren't difficult to get on a Sunday night when called in the day before, although we were told to come at 8-ish. We were seated promptly when we arrived at 8pm.The server brought fresh bread, jumbo pickles and a ramekin of bacon crumbles to the table when we sat down. Pickles seems to be a Montreal tradition, but I've never seen bacon served with bread before, but when in Rome! It did add an extra dimension to the bread though.Appetizers consisted of escargot bourguignonne and mussels provencale. The escargot was excellent, very tender, prepared in the traditional way with garlic, shallots and white wine; served out of the shell in the usual escargot dish. The mussels were baked instead of the more familiar steamed, with tomatoes, herbs and garlic and more bacon!All entrees include a choice of Gibby's salad or gazpacho and are served with a starch choice of baked potato, Monte Carlo potato or rice pilaf. The Monte Carlo potato is similar to a twice-baked potato with cheese and chives. Asparagus was also included.We ordered the filet and the petit filet. The regular filet was massive. I would guess a good 14-16 ounces. The petite had to be at least 10. They are on the expensive side, but given the size and the included salad, starch and vegetable it worked out to be good value for money. The steaks were tender and cooked to the correct temperature and the Montreal style seasoning (pepper, onion, garlic) made them delicious.We rounded off the meal with a shared triple chocolate dessert, which was delightful. We passed on the offer of table-side flaming coffees ($14ea), but the table next to us did order, so we got to see the show.Service was good, but the server would often disappear for extended periods of time between courses. The tobacco smell emanating from her clothing told us where she had been...."

Much of the stone building was still a part of the modern day restaurant today. We went on Memorial Day Monday which is not a holiday in Canada, so it made reservations a piece of cake. The pickles and bread that come beforehand were delicious. The odd thing though was that the bread came with a dish of bacon bits. Now, I know that bacon makes everything better, but no one was quite sure on what to do with it. However, who are we to question it. We ate our bacon and it was good!!!Ordered french onion soup and shrimp bisque for apps. The FO soup was really good. Very traditional French presentation and flavor. The shrimp bisque was ok, but was my least favorite item during the meal. After the app course, they gave us lemon sorbet as a pallet cleanser. This was a nice touch!!!The entrees consisted of petit filet and regular filet. They were $43 and $49 respectively. They came with asparagus and a baked potato/twice baked potato/or rice pilaf.  The steaks were both huge. Both steaks came out perfectly cooked coated with a pepper/onion/garlic seasoning that was great. We added on a side of mushrooms that were tasty as well. We also ordered 2 bottles of Cote de Rhone wine. It was delicious. On a side note, they were offering a 2 lbs lobster for only $47 dollars. Not a bad deal at all. If I did not live in Boston and was not at a steak house, I would have gone with the lobster for sure.For dessert we shared a triple chocolate dessert. It was light and delicious and the perfect ending to the meal. They also gave us chocolate thin mints that were actually chocolate, not the standard mints that one usually sees. The server was friendly and nice, but disappeared toward the end of the meal. When she came back to the table smelling like tobacco smoke, we knew where she went. While we may have been her last table, this knocked a star off the review. With that being said, if you are ever in Montreal, this place is a must."

Free valet parking also makes this restaurant a great choice for those cold winter nights.As per price, most people might consider Gibby's a little on the pricier side, but I've been to many steakhouses in North America, and Gibby's is a little bit more moderately priced than some others.I highly recommend the filet mignon, to which you can add on an order of jumbo shrimp grilled in garlic butter if you're a surf and turf lover like me, or I also recommend the 2lb lobster, which can be served grilled or boiled.They have a wide selection of other cuts of meat, seafood, and chicken.All main courses come with a choice from two or three appetizers, but you should definitely go with the ""Gibby's salad,"" and you also get a choice of potato -- baked, mashed, fries, or double baked. Double baked is commonly referred to as a Monte Carlo potato, and that's always the one I choose!"

We called about a week beforehand and they told us they were full until 10pm. We pleaded with them informing them we only come once a year and it's our favorite restaurant, so he was able to accommodate us at 7:30pm with this long table in the back for 14 people. Knowing we were hungry, the waiter brought over the pickles and bread and butter. We quickly scarfed it down and each ordered our own entree.The table got the Gibby's steak, artic char, beef wellington and a few other steaks. My Gibby's steak, which I get in rare, was pretty good. I wouldn't say it's the best steak of my life, but it was passing. The steak was cooked to how I like it. Everyone seemed to be pretty satisfied with their meals.I wouldn't take a date here though.

Ordered the jalepeno sausages and rib steak, Gibbys cut for main course.  The sausages were good not great and the steak was average.  Ended with the gibbys chocolate desert.  chocolate is always good but this was a little different with crunch that reminded me of stale rice krispies.  Some other tables ordered the apple desert that looked awesome.Atmosphere is what you would expect of Old Montreal and service was very good.

It's tucked away in old town; the restaurant itself is sort of in the basement. Surrounded by old grey stones, like a crypt; up on the first floor they have this regal bar. Looks like something of out the Godfather set, with maroon leather chairs, and heavy oak tables. Has a great selection of beers including some local brews. Once you make your way down to the dining hall, don't try to count calories or (Canadian) dollars, and just go with the recommendations. They whipped out this great baked mussels dish. Loaded with butter and garlic, they had these enormous mussels actually baked into a clay dish. Then I got the Dore Amande, Canadian wall-eye, baked with a side of potatoes and greens. Simple as can be, but damn good. I think it was combination of how they probably poached it half an hour before and what they seasoned it with (and probably because they poured loads of butter on it). Chasing it down with sauvignon blanc. Risking not being able to walk to the taxi outside, I couldn't resist their chocolate cake, and had to obviously pick a nice single malt to wrap things up.All in all, if you're in Montreal, don't miss out on Gibby's."

Menu had a few off the wall mains including shrimp curry with mango chutney, which really is a bit out of place given the average price of mains is $40+.  Server seemed already overwhelmed while the crowd had just begun to file in, and forgot the drinks of two people out of a party of six at the table. Steaks are still the best bet, my filet mignon was perfectly cooked med-rare, but was not as juicy as you would expect for $50 hunk of meat. Monte Carlo potato is overrated, and so is the famous Gibby's salad. Bottom line: if you are looking for overpriced but undersized portions with an underwhelming service in a picture perfect setting, Gibby's is the place to go."

Even after we moved out of Montreal when I was 6 (I'm 24 now), we continued to make Gibby's our go-to celebration spot. I'm obsessed with Gibby's birthday cakes and with every trip to Gibby's to this day, my family tries to trick me into thinking they stopped doing the cakes. When you're seated, they bring over their amazing homemade bread along with my favorite pickles and a bowl of cottage cheese with chives. I could make a meal out of those 3 items alone, but then I'd be missing out on the whole Gibby's experience. French onion soup is exactly what it should be- rich broth, sweet onions and lots of golden cheese. Fantastic. The salad dressing is some of the best garlic dressing I have ever had. It's so garlicy that they bring you a citrus sorbet (as a child I was really excited about ice cream in the middle of dinner!) to cleanse your palette before they bring out the entrees. Steaks are consistently great cuts of meat cooked perfectly. The monte carlo potato it comes with is a nice change from the usual steakhouse potatoes. We mostly order filet in my family, but ribeye and rack of lamb are also great. Every trip to Montreal includes at least one visit to Gibby's, sometimes more and I would never have it any other way"

This is definitely a red meat type of establishment. And save your appetite, the portions are large and the bread they serve beforehand defies description. It is incredibly fresh. I read some reviews where people were confused by the bacon bits on the table with the bread and pickles... I finally found a use for them. Great to add to your baked potato side and salad.The salad dressing is one of my husbands favorites, and is luckily available by the bottle now.This is a great place to go in Old Montreal if you are looking for somewhere cozy on a frigid Canadian night.  After eating here every time we go up, though, I'm tempted to try something different next time..."

/user_details?userid=Gf-ehxnP9ahdU2VuYmRYXA,Jayson D.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Service was borderline passable.  Nothing spectacular for the price, but nothing to really complain about either.  Standard bread and pickles on table to start off but if you want pickles bread and coleslaw go to Moishes especially for the after 9 specials..  Started with a salad which was extremely disappointing and kind of insulting.  it looked and tasted exactly like the pre shredded lettuce bags I get at Loblaws.  The sauce, despite the waitresses claim of being fantastic and popular no better than what is found in the grocery aisles.  I ordered mignons of beef diane which was good.  Perfectly cooked rare, but both the sauce and steak tasted too buttery, and suggested wine pairing with dinner wasn't a hit and didn't go well with the mushrooms and sauce.  If I could have gone back I would have saved myself a few bucks and pick something cheaper as this was not a $50 dish.All in all, I left somewhat disappointed as the food was nothing exciting, and nothing I can't get elsewhere for cheaper.  I don't mind paying a premium on food prices if justified with a nice setting or top notch serve such as Queue de cheval  and it was nice eating in the old port environment.  I'm glad I was dining with some friends and total damage was around $90  instead of ~$200 if I was with my fiance, at which point I would have left absolutely disappointed and annoyed."

/user_details?userid=60XFRD-0MSrbNxjIMPHFvQ,Linda G.,"Wayne, NJ",5 star rating,"I would move to Montreal just to go to Gibby's on a regular basis.  After reading the reviews here (thank you Nicholas M), we decided to keep Gibby's on the list of possibilities.  We were up in Montreal for the weekend (basically, all day Saturday, and Sunday morning) with a hockey fan club (Go Devils!!).  After walking around Old Montreal for the day, my hubby and I went back to our hotel to freshen up and head back out for dinner.  We were staying in the trade center and there weren't too many options for dinner (or nightlife), so we wandered down Rue McGill for about 15 minutes, didn't see anything that interested us, so we went back to the hotel to get directions to Gibby's.  Thankfully, we did!!!   We walked about another 15 minutes, turned the corner, and found it - very unassuming - stone/brick front, people waiting in the alcove for the valet parking attendants to bring their cars around...we weren't really sure where the door was, but had 4 people following behind us and we wanted to get in before they did in order to get a table first!  (LOL)...  We found our way in to the packed lobby, the hostess took our name and noted that we were a party of 2, and told us it would be about 45 minutes, but we could go upstairs to the lounge and order a drink while we waited.  We said sure and were lead upstairs to a huge lounge, with only about 8 other people waiting.  We sat at a little table by the fireplace, and ordered 2 glasses of wine from the waitress.  She brought our wine and the hostess came up to tell us that our table was ready!!  The dining room was packed, but not too loud.  The decor was stone and exposed beams and after reading our menus, we found out the history of the 400 year old building (it was part of the stable and the hospital run by the Grey Nuns)....    We checked out the menu and I decided on the Grilled Swordfish special, while my husband got the full-sized filet mignon.  We noticed that all entrees came with a salad, a choice of baked potato, Monte Carlo potato (twice baked potato, blended with sour cream, bacon, and cheese - THANK YOU, AGAIN, NICHOLAS M!!), rice pilaf, and asparagus spears, so we opted out of getting an appetizer since it seemed that the entrees themselves would be more then enough.  After a loaf of tasty, fresh bread was delivered, our salads arrived, and although they were salads (with fresh ground pepper added at the table, and fresh, crunchy, but chewy, croutons, also added at the table) these were the best salads I've ever had (there was a little kick to the balsamic vinaigrette dressing, and some serious garlic...YUM)  After we finished those, a scoop of palate-cleansing lemon sorbet was brought to the table.    Then came our entrees....which were filled with one of the best meals that money can buy (or at least, the best grilled swordfish, filet mignon, potatoes, and asparagus that we've ever had) - My swordfish was perfectly grilled, with the grill marks and all - it tasted like a steak!!  It was PERFECT!  My husband ordered his filet with a  medium temperature - it was more toward medium rare (which is my choice), but definitely NOT disappointing to him nor me!  And the Monte Carlo potato...to die for!  Baked, and re-stuffed with the potato, blended with just the right amount of cheese, sour cream, and bacon, not so you could taste any one part separately, but so all parts 'blended' together into one palate-pleasing medley.  And the asparagus was good, too...  Before our meals came, we noticed some desserts going out to the tables around us and I said 'no matter how full we are, WE ARE GETTING A DESSERT'!!!  Unfortunately, we just had to finish our dinners because we couldn't stop eating, and couldn't let such a fabulous meal end - we had not one inch of room for dessert.  I asked our waitress what time they opened on Sunday, because we were going to come back JUST for dessert, but they open at 5 PM on Sundays, and we would be on our way back to NJ by then.  Next time, I WILL make room for the pastry with the apples and caramel and ice cream, or the chocolate thing that we saw passing our table....  Apparently, Gibby's is the place to go, and  you should have reservations (we found this out on Sunday, after speaking with a 'native' Montreal-an) - but we lucked out and didn't have to wait long for our dining enjoyment.  The prices were a little high (dinner for 2, with all the accompaniments and 2 glasses of wine each, came to about $100/couple) - However, it was definitely worth it for the quality meal and friendly service that we received.  PS - don't go if you are in a rush - they give you time to enjoy your experience - we were there about 2 hours...which was fine with us - We will be back, Gibby's - see you soon!!!  XO"
/user_details?userid=vxNjUAnrEPqPjBmIe7F4GQ,Michelle W.,"Pierrefonds, Canada",2 star rating,"I found it expensive for what it was.  Very old school.  I started with the escargots - which were tasty, if a little salty and rubbery.  I was then brought a mixed green salad, which consisted mainly of iceberg lettuce (which was a bit rusty). I ordered a filet mignon for my main, although it looked as though it was cooked perfectly (medium rare) strangely it was rather dry and at least one other dining companion had the same complaint. Could it be that the meat had been frozen and defrosted rendering it bloodless? The accompanying rice was so dry and tasteless it would be better served coming out of a Gatling gun, absolutely dreadful. The sorbet in between courses was ok if that's your thing and the pickles were rockin'. I ordered a Brazilian coffee to finish as I heard that they put on quite a show. They roll up in some rickety old cart and heat the glass etc etc, not very impressive honestly.  The service was ok. Our server was kind of grumpy at first and then got friendly as the night went on. One of the servers looked really anorexic. The horrible uniform they make them wear was hanging off her skeletal frame. Not who'd you'd expect to be serving your food - you have to wonder what she's doing on her break? I'm sure I'm forgetting something but that speaks for itself.  Overall I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It's dated and a tourist trap."
/user_details?userid=qQ_IOstGA56cnBQ_LxvQXg,Nathan L.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"How can you not like a great steak especially when its in this very cool rustic stone building which is over 200 years old. Apparently this is a tough place to get reservations at but I had no problem calling that morning and reserving a Saturday night dinner at 8pm for 4 people. When we got there we only waited around 15 minutes for our table to open up and considering how packed it was I was pretty happy with that. We sat down and and had 4 completely different dinners all of which are cooked just right and tasted delicious. I had the prime rib, my friends had the rib eye, lamb and some other meal which I have forgotten, but I tried it, and I will vouch for whatever it is that he had. The drinks were a served a little bit different from what we were used to. Now its hard to tell if its a Canada thing or if this restaurant just made it a little different. That hardly takes away from the meal though as there was enough food that we were all satisfied. If we werent going out that night t party after, we would have finished off the food and been stuck in food coma till the next morning...but then again, thats usually what a hearty steak dinner can do to you anyways. Since I dont live in Montreal and its kind of a trip to get there Id love to sample other restaurants before I go back but you better believe I will be telling all of my friends who visit to check out Gibbys."
/user_details?userid=4cGaJNqVPIgBECDetqaDTg,Adam F.,"Middlebury, VT",4 star rating,"I'm not sure why they serve pickles with the bread, but they are fantastic!  I had a hard time not eating all of them.  I ordered a ribeye that was rubbed with garlic and it was cooked perfectly!  I have been to a lot of high end steakhouses and I can honestly say this steak is near the top of the list.  I wasn't a huge fan of the atmosphere though.  For the price, it was pretty loud and crowded and tables were basically crammed into a giant room with very little in the way of ambiance.  The service, on the other hand, was top notch.  The waiter was excellent at being very attentive without seeming like he was hovering over us.  Our water and wine were constantly refilled and the food came out at an excellent pace."
