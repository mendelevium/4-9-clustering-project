/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We've been there twice, always at night. A quick glance at their menu will tell you why - it features high protein, high fat fast food, perfect for late night munchies. I mean, how can layers upon layers of (halal) meat, cheese, egg and sauce stuffed in a chock full sandwich ever go wrong?The first time we went, I found myself staring at the menu for at least 5 mins. So many possibilities! So much calories! I wanted to try all of them.We each ordered a sandwich. I was expecting a giant pile of grub, but instead received a decent looking, neatly packed sandwich. It felt a bit like ordering a Double Big Mac, only to receive a slightly deflated version of it. Anyways, the price felt a bit high, but soon all was forgotten - the food was great.  If you're hungry and most places are closed, I strongly recommend checking out Centrale Bergham. P.S.They tend to be short on staff at night (I only saw one guy working), so waiting times vary."
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",5 star rating,"Holy Tabarnouche or Sacremouille de ratatouille! (My weak attempt at French humour)Dammm there are fast food places that one would consider on the edge of legendary... this is definitely a surprising visit. My first selection was closed so I felt like a sandwich and this showed up. Reviews looked promising so I dove right in. Decor of the restaurant is nothing glamorous but their food is a surprise. I went with the tandoori chicken sandwich and it came with delicious light crispy fries. The sandwich was light, flavorful and a bloody heaping serving. I've never had something so tasty and surprising for fast food in a while! The chicken had a light tandoori flavour but was delicious! I never knew this place existed and Algerian fast food is smokin good! They give you an option of two sauces. I had both. One is a tangy creamy mayo mustard. The other is a spicier mayo. Both are delicious compliments and great for dipping your fries. Fantastic place for lunch, greasy dinner, late night or after bar food to lock down that hangover.  All under $10 with a drink? Seriously? How could one go wrong? I salivate just thinking of when I can go back!"
/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"We decided to visit this Bergham after going to the one on St Catherine first and checking the reviews only to be disappointed!We were impressed by the Yelp reviews for this branch so we decided to try it out.I ordered the cheese burger and my husband went for the Maximum. Staff seemed friendly and our order arrived super fast despite it being a Saturday evening.I decided to dig in straight away and was instantly put off... My burger was literally cold! The patty was fairly warm but the buns felt like they had just come out of the fridge! I was so disappointed so I decided to take it back and told a member of staff. I would have expected them to create a new burger for me but to my surprise, they just whacked it in a microwave and served me my already bitten burger again... What a complete shock! This made the burger soggy of course and it lost its burger feeling :(My husband's sandwich looked OK but was really messily put together and was falling apart. The poutine was very good however so at least that is something I enjoyed but aside from that, I would never ever visit this place again! Their competitor (MStar/Mtl Star) are wayyyy better in quality of food and also customer service. I think I will be sticking to that from now on."

/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Crazy sandwiches, super generous portions, low price, and good taste. With all these positives, why didn't I give them a 5 star review? My sandwich personally was nothing out of this world (Le Majestic). It was good, yes, but nothing special.The people I was with loved their food so maybe I had very high expectations from the amazing reviews on this place? Who knows..Would I go back? Not purposefully, no, but I wouldn't be opposed to it either.Check it out and maybe be a little more daring in your choice than I was! Maybe that's where the magic lies :)"
/user_details?userid=CgEDXbmrdID5HffBhn-Zdw,todd s.,"QC, Canada",2 star rating,"Nine dollars plus tax for a small Chef poutine (chicken with mushroom sauce).It started out tasting well, and the texture remained decent (small fries, tho).But in the end, the saltiness was so bad I literally spat out(side) the last mouthful.It's not their specialty (sandwiches), but it could at least have been edible."
/user_details?userid=CUC2wuc4d8a6U5yUg7l7lA,Yulu H.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,Got supreme sandwich - fair taste. They have multiple TVs in the restaurant so good spot to grab a quick sandwich and watch a game.
/user_details?userid=o9qSsU-zzbHbUt0Gbtj9fA,Salman S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Pretty good sandwich place. Pros: for a fast food restaurant, very good in terms of service, food quality and cleanliness. Cons: food took awhile to prepare. Maybe it was just a slow day. But other than that, pretty good."
/user_details?userid=98cazUVXEPUBKxFKcZXbJw,Jaheen H.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"The algerine sauce is so freaking good. We bought extra of those bottles to take back to the US. The fries with the sauce were dumb good! The burgers are also so great. This place is convinient because its open so late, up to 5am. Very good late night quick grab."
/user_details?userid=Z74hyVnwfPS2OdXx-oDSvw,Brian Z.,"Palo Alto, CA",5 star rating,"Sandwiches are juicy and delicious, fries are crispy and the sauces are amazing. THE place to go in the AM. But the customer service is even better!One time I simply asked for a to go bag for my sandwich and fries and remaining sauces. But what happened was this: the server took my tray, rewrapped the sandwich in a new paper, put the fries into a new bag, and gave me new filled sauce cups that had lids on them for the fries. I DIDN'T EVEN TELL THEM TO DO THAT! These guys go beyond what customers ask for. That is truly amazing customer service. This is coming from a guy who normally doesn't care about customer service.That's why I will always tip well here.tldr; HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
/user_details?userid=NUJsFBSaa6RfHETL-ybBCA,Camille L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Ordered from this place last night through uberEats, and the delivery guy never showed up. This is not the fault of the restaurant, as they had given him the order, however these guys went out of their way and delivered another order for us themselves, out of their pocket. We had the two tandoori chicken sandwich combos, which were very tasty with lots of meat in them. Overall great service and food, can't wait to try the other items on their menu."
/user_details?userid=r3UaLIhGqpSullNT9dtZmg,Ragnar L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Slow service , took 15 min to cook the food and thats only because i was the only one there Tiny portions for food , maybe worth half what i paid for"
/user_details?userid=JkSd88xYkDpjMEzftpm9bg,Prashant V.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,Great late night food spot in Montreal. Gets really packed after midnight. I would definitely recommend their sandwiches. Filling and will help with absorbing the toxins you ingested all night .
/user_details?userid=JkTMViJW5b_Tzn94GivETg,Jonathan K.,"Frederiksberg, Denmark",5 star rating,"A fast food place that tastes better than most cafes. The staff is friendly, but mostly only speaks French. Their poutine is also really good in the early mornings!"
/user_details?userid=5cKbxXPP-8gzSl1bpakB7w,Amine K.,"Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,I gave 3 stars because it is very expensive. Worth it? I would say not really for that price. Too overpriced.
/user_details?userid=XTkJuIDgJDoS6xiLkj7iQw,Kevin C.,"Cary, NC",5 star rating,Best fast food in the country. If your a tourist in Montreal skip the restaurants and eat here. Try the special!
/user_details?userid=VYubovlk7tEhd0tAyV4Gcg,J Y.,"Fremont, CA",3 star rating,"After eating multiple times at this place, the magic of the first time was never recreated. The food was usually bland and monotonously made.  Except for the algerienne sauce there is nothing more to this place. Overall decent to eat in a crunch but that is about it..."
/user_details?userid=h1UcaSPIPpQqMiWf12Csqw,Jill M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Just ordered from this place, it took over an hour for the food to be delivered. the food was cold and my drink was warm. very upsetting for the price, my friend asked for an iced tea but got a sprite. i got the tandoori sandwich, it was decent, but the fries were soggy and cold. i will not be ordering from here again."
/user_details?userid=nicGnkYxQLXQFHAcNp4rsA,Steve X.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"This place is my salvation in Montreal. I found out about it very recently and I vow to come here as often as possible. It's pretty ridiculous to have a restaurant this good open only during late nights, i mean that to me is such a tease. But that's what makes this place extra special. I don't even know where to start on how great this place can be for the human species in Montreal, QC. This place seems like a fast food joint you go to when you are not sober and craving some junk food. But I will tell you this place is much much more. Calling Centrale Bregham a ""fast food joint"" does not give the place one molecule of justice. First of all their staff is ridiculously nice, everyone I ordered from were very helpful in identifying what I would like and they are all very patient with customers. The price is also very fair compared to other Montreal fast food joints. I personally came here sober at least twice and thoroughly enjoyed my burgers and sandwhiches. It really doesn't matter what you choose, I truly believe everything on their menu will taste good and be mouth watering. They use a special type of sauce in all of their heavenly creations and any meal you order will fill you up. I mean the food is absolutely unique and different from any other sandwhich place or burger joint you will walk into. In fact, this is my favorite place in Montreal and this is coming from a pretty classy guy that guys to upscale restaurants periodically. Just writing this review makes my taste buds tingle and my mouth wetter than it was before I started writing this review. That's how powerful and tasty their food is. So if you come here, ladies and gentleman, bring extra lower body undergarments because this place has food that will make your body experience something pleasant that you will not forget."
/user_details?userid=plOnLo8TTsLSs9jB8LxGzA,Thuy-Van Lisa H.,"La Salle, Canada",5 star rating,"Tried this place for the first time with my boyfriend. There is a lot of choice, after a while of trying to decide I chose ""le maximum"" combo and it was delicious. very meaty and it made me so full I had a hard time finishing the fries that come with it! My boyfriend tried ""le speciale"" which is tandoori chicken and really liked it too. The place is quiet and well lit, nice chairs and tables. It took a bit of time to get the food but its well worth the wait. Highly recommend this place to anyone who's into sandwiches or a quick burger."

/user_details?userid=KIBnDrvylvrvhr4Ow6OIAw,Edgar M.,"Villeray-Saint-Michel-Parc-Extension, Canada",4 star rating,"Greetings fellow Yelpers!! This is my first time coming to Central Bergham and after enjoying the Classic Sandwich I know I'llbe back! This quiet yet vibrant Algerien owned business is hidden on the corner of beaubien st and langelier. As you enter, you see the cooks at work, families sitting, youngsters talking but as soon as the food is served, all you hear are ""hmm""'s. crunching into those sanwiches gets better with every bite. It's so good you won't notice  your finishing it! FYI I here there is another one beeing built in the downtown are. Enjoy Yelpers!!"
/user_details?userid=dfIOLWBUkZvULJUqDeJ-Nw,Brian L.,"Dartmouth, Canada",4 star rating,"Great selection of sandwiches, delicious chicken and steak options: the Philly chicken, the Camembert, the majestic (Philly steak), and they were all great. The grilled chicken poutine was very good too. Four stars for the great food and low prices, but only because we got takeout. The restaurant is nice enough, but I'd say maybe three stars if you're eating in. Staff were very friendly and helpful."
/user_details?userid=hWf_rv3aONGGhcckSsPS1A,D C.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I come here all the time because i live around the corner, the food is good but overpriced. Hangover food more than anything. I just xame on here to say that they usually take a long time...by long i mean minimum 10 mins. Avwrgae 15. Right now its been 25 mins ive had time to go outside and smoke, and even to download this app just to write this review. They are unapologetically slow and don't care. Several people have complained and i still don't have my food. Imagine if i was at my work lunch break....ridiculous."
/user_details?userid=Gkxe9U9E2WR2937cjIZboA,Jason K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is great!There is a ton of selection and everything is different. it was super cheap. for 2 sandwiches was like $14 which makes it cheaper than eating at subway. When I left I left thinking about what I wanted to order next time I came back. it was very good street food. The sandwiches are messy and hard to eat which makes them perfect for walking around and snacking. the place seemed clean, user friendly, and very cost effective. I would highly recommend"

/user_details?userid=TCf3Qt9yyaU6kYERVTcBWw,Imran K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Very good food. Sauces are amazing. Vast selection of items--I'd like to eat there more often but I like limiting my junk food intake. Atmosphere and service is so-so. Decor is beautiful. I highly recommend trying it out.
/user_details?userid=-hYXtPvvRTbEGbtvFaPHiw,Floyd F.,"Denver, CO",5 star rating,"The angelic employee (a reference to his ability and not his appearance) somehow understood my poor attempts at ordering my dinner in French and put an orgasm on a roll, wrapped it in foil and handed it to me in a paper bag.  That's it.  That's all you need to know."
/user_details?userid=K5paQmVqij5COiggtePIGQ,Mark M.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,The best burger I have ever had! I recommend this place to everyone I know. The Biggie burger is the best.
/user_details?userid=siCkQhJcmmUzOq6qUTCUhA,William Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I had ""la Maximum trio"" and it was amazing! They stuffed so much meat in it that the bread can barely hold the meat. The taste is great and it only costs $12.xx"
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The term ""Sandwicherie"" may or may not have been invented by this establishment, but I'll tell you from looking over the menu panels back and forth I'd say maybe they have the right to. The unique creations using various types of marinated chicken, beef and fish topped with cheese, fresh vegetables and mild or spicy sauces are noteworthy. I commented to the order taker and sole counter person that I would have to come back to take in all the choices. I therefore opted for the first thing on the menu ""Le Rouge"". An elongated pita pocket meets roll, stuffed to the gills with Tandoori chicken in a sauce I liken to butter chicken sauce, with orange cheese melted through it, lettuce, tomato and onion. I figure by now you can imagine this thing dripped on the tray liner, but was worth the mess. In a way a dream come true butter chicken in a bun. I'm sold for another try. The second item is ""Le Jaune"", so who knows where this rainbow of food will end. To note all sandwiches are priced with or without a trio (fries and a pop). The meat is Halal and there is plenty of it throughout the menu. No need to mention this place must rock at 2:30am and all that meat (and some grease) is a great absorber of other items consumed on The Main. Simply put it's a lot like sit down street (truck) food."
/user_details?userid=8fv38UQlBoIVSDkEvfcP6A,Saad K.,"Oakville, Canada",5 star rating,"This place has a very interesting approach to burgers. We came here because of a recommendation from a friend. I had the spicy burger, a friend got the two meat sandwich. It was absolutely delicious. The only thing we weren't that fond of was the poutine, and honestly it didn't matter since the sandwiches were just that good."
