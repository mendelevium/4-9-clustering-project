/user_details?userid=OHTXFa3YQY0cB0nzHgjhRw,Yi T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Walking into this place feels like going back to your Grandma's: knick-knacks everywhere, wood furniture, cosy lighting, comforting food. I tried many things on their menu, including the blue cheese burger, the veggie burger, salads and the poutine, and it never disappointed. Price is good for the large portion size, and they have a good selection of beers. The specials change often (look for the chalkboard!). It's perfect for a romantic date. A gem in the often overlooked Vieux-Longueuil."
/user_details?userid=lpPAOEn3FUWuKd-FQnUJsQ,Chris A.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"The ""experience"" is immediate; as soon as you enter you are struck by the detail of antiquity, with a genuine feeling that you are walking into a classy 1890s restaurant. That attention to detail comes through in their dishes. The Dijon Mussels were rich in flavour and the wine sauce in which they sat becomes a tasty bisque like mussel soup. My friend, George had the Fish & Chips cod, which came out served on a breadboard; delicious. The sangria was excellent, served with fruit that was seeping long enough in the pitcher that it wasn't simply a decoration, but an integral part of the drink. Dishes are very reasonably priced; most are under $20. The entire evening was quite an experience and our host--whom I think was the owner--was charming and warm. Interestingly, one of the Yelp reviewers commented on the restaurant's name noting that ""Comme par hazard"" translates to ""as by chance""; St.Charles Road in ""old"" Longueuil is a quaint little strip, and this restaurant is an old, well kept house from the early 1900s. When you step in, the atmosphere really does ""wow"" you with its turn of the 19th century feel; it is that pleasant surprise, and the excellence of the food, presentations and overall experience, that I assume the name is clueing us into. I really look forward to returning."

A little on the small size, but it was moist and good.  It lost points for the over cooked duck burger but the service made the night."
/user_details?userid=wipLfdbfvPIGZ3N94Bpqzg,Elena M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Let me start by saying that this restaurant has amazing mussels! So, if your intention is to eat mussels than it is definitely worth going to this place. Why did I give it a 2 stars? 1. every time we asked for a beer there was no more, I asked for a Corona she offered me Heineken instead ( in what world is this the same). I took another type of beer and when I ordered a 2nd one she told me she is out of this one also. I mean who orders alcohol in this place? C'mon ppl its Saturday night not Monday ! 2. I ordered a carbonara pasta which was horrible. I asked to change my plate which the waiter agreed to do and asked me what was wrong with my plate. I explained that the sauce its not carbonara, more like alfredo, probably had used half and half . Another waiter comes and asks me the same thing +  ' do u know what carbonara tastes like?' I thought that was very rude because even if I wouldn't have known the sauce was still horrible. There were a lot of wrong things with this place; think twice before going !"

/user_details?userid=zA7bpBJbXN-Et5F7o7cXpQ,Marie B.,"Longueuil, Canada",3 star rating,"Good food, nice terrace ...  I give it a 3/5 stars, the food was delicious, we had escargots, tilapia, beef and salmon tartar.   They could really dress up their outdoor tables, no placemats, old glasses, we had to ask for utensils.   Escargots were yummy, all this great sauce left with no spoon or side bread to finish this great experience.  Fairly priced, I'll give it another try later, maybe indoors this time.   FYI, they had no AC on a night of 35 degrees."
/user_details?userid=UVxY0iyPaqY7s4BSFtt-xA,Wanugee N.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"Comme Par Hasard (literally ""for as random,"" or ""by chance"") is a cute old home in old downtown Longueuil converted into this very nice and cozy Bistro. It feels like you were invited to a friend's or Grandma's house for dinner, with old traditional chairs and decor, soft lighting, and really friendly service. They have a good local biere (beer) menu that has strong beers (7.75% to 9% alcohol) as well as beers on tap and foreign bottles. There is a daily changing chalkboard of specials and favorites.The three of us all opted for the same daily special, an Okoberfest special with weiners, sauerkraut, with side spoons of dijon mustard, served with pomme frites and 2 small glasses of beer (biere blanc et rouge). The special ($21.95) included  soup or salad. The soup was a deicious pumpkin cream, and the salad included pumpkin, cheeese, greens and beets. Dessert was a large mix of chocolate pudding and chocolate mouse, but they had many other choices, like pumpkin creme brulee.Prices were not astronomical and service was very friendly and welcoming. I would recommend this place for friends, romance or business."

The sauce was tasty, but not really creamy (it was more of a broth). The mussels were a bit dry.Reasonable pricesNice outdoor seatingService a bit slowThe bathroom has an interesting decor.. (I was actually scared to go in so I didn't use the bathroom)."
/user_details?userid=-JkdEOYH9qYWsDglcRC5Yw,Darren M.,"Newmarket, Canada",5 star rating,"We had a romantic lunch on a quiet Monday afternoon . Demi Pichet of Sangria was delicious ! Moules Bleu Danois came highly recommended and were decadent , so my compliments to the chef . Our server seemed calm & confident as if she owned the place and gave us plenty of space and time to enjoy our lunchdate . If I were in the resto business my menu would be exactly like theirs , & if I lived closer I would treat my girlfriend to more dates there and try their Nachos , Veggie Burgers , Brunch , and the poutine du jour!! Thank Goodness we chose Comme Par Hasard ,over their neighbours , that day!"
/user_details?userid=cswqM0HVm6aNpLln3dRnfw,Paul L.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"I was visiting Montreal and I wanted a place that is non-touristy. This place does not disappoint. Each time I returned to Montreal, I travelled across the bridge to enjoy this fabulous place.  Friendly staff. Great traditional French bistro cuisine. Few tourists. Very reasonable price. The menu changed every time. I liked it that most diners spoke French. I tried to speak French too; but when my French started to fail, the waitress graciously helped me out in English. Definitely check out their bathroom: they decorated it like it was from a Hitchcock movie."
/user_details?userid=fi38ETFUNBBndrkKqLqUtA,Tina M.,"Austin, TX",4 star rating,"Comme par hasard is a very charming French bistro which was built inside a house in Vieux Longueuil. Entering at Comme par hasard feels like being invited to eat at your grandma's table; the décor is filled with antiques, drapes, warm light, as well as mismatched table cloths, chairs, plates and utensils. The food is tasty and cooked in their kitchen (resulting in a longer wait). For the vegetarians out there, they have a section in their menu dedicated to veggie burgers (which are excellent). If you have a sweet tooth, I recommend the banana cake; it was so delicious I almost fell off my chair!"

/user_details?userid=PVGy6XG5Le10wZuSXtxj5w,Daniel P.,"Pompano Beach, FL",5 star rating,Cozy warm and quiet atmosphere. you can talk without shouting. Food and service excellent too. 3 person with wine $120. Quality vs price excellent. I will return
/user_details?userid=pVu8VmaEdCFSvHtlDcOHkA,Romy F.,"Saint-Hubert, Canada",4 star rating,"The food was good, portions were adequate (meaning here that you are full afterwards but not too full), reasonably priced for the portions you're getting. The staff was very nice and smiley, but we had to wait a little long by the end of the meal. They actually apologized for the wait, which made it ok. It's got a very kitch decor that makes it quite unusual and unique. Very friendly over all."
/user_details?userid=zoMRgX9-o0aNugob1G8Zeg,Bruce G.,"Calgary, Canada",5 star rating,"As a Western Canadian, I wanted the real Quebec bistro experience. We found it here and now I want to marry this place. Upon walking in the front door you are surrounded by the cosiest, warmest and most inviting atmosphere. The smells set our mouths watering as we surveyed the menu. Being French language challenged, we sought the help of our server and were soon laughing and joking with her as we both worked at interpreting.My wife had a chèvre chaud salade and I had mussels in cream and mushrooms with wine plus the regular burger and fries. The menu seems dominated by mussels and hamburgers however there was also an extensive chalkboard with many additional items available. We added to our dining pleasure by ordering a half bottle of the house wine. Each item we ate was exceptionally good. The mussels came with a warm basket of in house buns and they were well used in sopping up the wonderful mussel creme sauce. My wife's salad had her raving for hours and she madly wrote down the ingredients with hopes of repeating such a delight back in the west. My hamburger and fries were spectacular and so large that I actually could not eat it all and I am no quitter in the dining department.We highly recommend this marvellous bistro."
/user_details?userid=VaapXwWZyKm083hcORD8lw,Andrew K.,"Liverpool, NY",4 star rating,Great meal tonight...only wish my sweetheart was with me as the place is a home that was converted into a quaint romantic restaurant. Calamari is excellent!
