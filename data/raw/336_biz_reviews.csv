The bathroom is only a unisex single,  but it's pretty big and clean.   They use the space to store their cleaning supplies."

/user_details?userid=00bBCxn1CljPrkB9czooRQ,Jessica A.,"Deux-Montagnes, Canada",5 star rating,"Hidden gem! The presentation was gorgeous and the sushi was unique and fresh! Their original creations did not disappoint, and we even went back again in the same week because we couldn't get enough! Ambiance is similar to a sushi shop, so it's not the restaurants strong suit. Good sushi for a good price."
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Omg it's so good here!!! The rice is perfectly seasoned and al dente. The flavours are fun and you get a ton of variety. Everything is fresh and and well prepared. The lunch menu is affordable and you can make it a combo as well. I had the 14 pieces that costs me roughly 12$ with tips and taxes included. I'm so glad I found this place. On the plus side, they also do delivery. I have a feeling that I'll be ordering a lot from them. Staff super nice and the place really clean. I'm not a big fan of nigiris and this place offers to substitute it with futomakies. How fun is that?!! I love it! Besides great sushi, they also have salads, soups, poke bowls, bentos... I mean, I just finished eating lunch and I'm already placing an order for dinner lol. Can you tell how excited I am about this place?"
/user_details?userid=JrTsaMac8BnAkLuJ3MfGzA,Aileen L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,ATMOSPHERE: It's a pretty small restaurant. It can seat up to 15 people max. Seems to be more of a take-out style restaurant in my opinion. The inside is nice and modern. It's about a 3 minute walk from the metro so it's very convenient.FOOD: The food was very good! I had the salmon and tuna poke bowl. The ingredients were fresh and very tasty. The flavours merged well together and the bonito flakes mixed with rice was heavenly. It didn't fill me up but it was still yummy. The sushi looks promising as well. PRICE: I came here during their opening day so I was able to receive 50% off and it came up to 9$. Pretty worth it! Poke bowls range from 13-15$ with sides that are 1-2$ extra.SERVICE: The service was very good and quick. The cashier had a bit of difficulty speaking English but it wasn't a big deal at all.

/user_details?userid=PbLbbOtij3itB1ZgLpVbDQ,Siyu Y.,"Bezirk Pankow, Berlin, Germany",5 star rating,Amazing small restaurant!The poke is obsoletely delicious! Very big size with cheap price. And the sushi is also good!
/user_details?userid=xDg4gp_oBUudXbZz31yf-A,Helena U.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been to this place twice and I was satisfied both times! The sushis are prepared by the chef and evry pieces were fresh. It is not pricey at all. During lunch time, they have a lunch menu combo. I chose the 11 pieces and it cost me about 7$ which is really not bad!! The place is small, they have few tables but they keep it really clean! I would definitely return to this place and have more of those delicious sushis! Give it a try:)"

/user_details?userid=hQrb3DaAPA6LsfyUEPfChw,IG-38 G.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is probably the best sushi  place I've ever had in my entire life.  At first it seemed sketchy that it was four and a half stars and only 3 reviews, but the reviews are all correct, it is the best!!!!  The service is great and the bathroom is clean.  It is also perfectly priced."
