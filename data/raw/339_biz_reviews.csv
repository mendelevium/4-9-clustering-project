/user_details?userid=RWxAmmEmOod3HbI3KNp2Sg,Yann M.,"Atlanta, GA",5 star rating,The food was fantastic! I wish I remembered what I ordered but it was absolutely amazing. I can't say much for the drink though. We made reservations but there was a quite a line when we arrived around noon. The service was great. The waiter spoke English and French. The restaurant was very artsy and casual. The potatoes that I ordered were so well seasoned and coated with syrup. I highly recommend!
/user_details?userid=IMHvG_ysz6akYIM-GO18kg,Andrea D.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This has been my favourite brunch place for the last   8 YEARS ! I'm always trying out newer places recommended by friends, but l'avenue still stays at the top of my list. Their menu is very varied  - brunch plates (eggs, meat, potatoes, side of bread) , omelettes, eggs Benedict, sandwiches, sweets (waffles, pancakes etc), steak and eggs, cast iron dishes- but the quality of their food stays so high. I've tried out different things on the menu and am consistently impressed. One of my favourite things to order is the ""undecided "", basically a mix of all of the above when you just can't make up your mind. Or when I'm less greedy, I go for their eggs Benedict dishes.  Toppings are AA quality, hollandaise sauce is so creamy, poached eggs cooked to perfection.  Last tip- you NEED to check out their bathrooms. Bring your phone, you'll want a selfie!"
/user_details?userid=yACLb6lUDPjw0g5JrNwXMg,Kyle S.,"Atlanta, GA",5 star rating,"This place lives up to the hype it has on Yelp and social media. Hip spot for breakfast and brunch. I was unfortunately only partaking in the eating part and none of the drinking as I had to drive back to the states, but the food here is amazing and comes with A LOT. Each meal comes with a fruit skewer that I thought was awesome. I ordered the French toast Benedict, and it was literally so much food I couldn't even finish. And I'm a big eater, I usually always finish my food at restaurants. And it was delicious too. The egg was cooked perfectly (pet peeve of mine when an eggs benny egg is not poached well). Great mix of flavors. The side of potatoes was good too. Again, just SO MUCH FOOD. Pro tip: come here early before the rest of the hipsters and trendy people wake up and do brunch."
/user_details?userid=aZvNQg3zSF7sPHMJvSTOpw,Joyce K.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"L'Avenue was one of the highly recommended restaurants to try in Montreal, so we dropped by on a Friday morning for brunch. I was a bit surprised at the long line-up out the door since it was raining that day. Fortunately, the servers came out with umbrellas for those of us that just have our hood on, which was very much appreciated. After a half-hour wait, we were seated in the bustling dining area that had a hip and retro décor, and given an extensive menu that offers omelets, crepes, toasts, benedicts, pancakes etc. We decided on the classic eggs benedict, rainbow eggs benedict, and Bobby does Dallas. The classic eggs benedict came w/ 2 poaches eggs, beer braised ham, hollandaise sauce, and roasted potatoes on the side. The rainbow eggs benedict was presented the same way, except it had smoked salmon, cream cheese, and capers in place of the ham. For both dishes, the poached eggs were perfectly runny, and the hollandaise sauce was smooth and creamy. The flavors were rich and went well with the ham/salmon. The potatoes were also nicely seasoned and aromatic, with a slight crisp on the outside. Only caveat is that the ham was sweeter than I prefer. As for the Bobby does Dallas, it was a massive cassolette w/ eggs, steak, cheddar cheese, mushrooms, potatoes, and a baguette on the side. The dish was delicious for the first few bites, but then the sweetness of the bbq sauce became a bit too overwhelming. Pairing it with the baguette helped to offset the sweetness a little. Overall, L'Avenue is a solid place for brunch; just make sure that you come early to avoid the line."
/user_details?userid=8qu5Zyurap002eIj1kLdOg,Joana Z.,"Saint-Lambert, Canada",3 star rating,"L'Avenue is probably one of the brunch restaurants in Montréal that gets the most hype and buzz around. My friend and I went there on a Friday morning and the restaurant was packed. We wanted to sit facing a window or close, but it was all taken so we got a seating in the middle of the restaurant. The restaurant itself is gorgeous, the walls are painted with graffitis and you have to take a photo in the bathrooms! My only issue with the bathroom was the water on the floor (it was everywhere) as well as toilet paper. I believe it is normal to wait before being served, especially if the restaurant is packed, but my friend and I waited 15 minutes before the waiter first came to get our drinking order (2 mimosas). We then waited another 10 minutes to order our food. Again, our waiter was running everywhere because of how packed the restaurant was... maybe they were understaffed? As for the food, the mimosas were very good, filled with alcohol, the fruit brochette they bring in the beginning was delicious as well.I ordered L'indécis and got bacon and sausage with a Nutella/strawberry waffle. The waffle was delicious, perfectly creamy. The potatoes are a classic, they were very good. I didn't love the sausage, it was pretty dry. Also, they only bring one strip of bacon (I would've expected more, especially for 18,88$). The eggs were delicious as well, no complaints there. Another issue my friend and I had were the flies everywhere in the restaurant. They don't have any nets on their windows and they opened the doors wide so they are EVERYWHERE and eating with them is truly annoying."
/user_details?userid=RwQUv7Cn61gTkPXcytSrSQ,Amy Yu T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"L'Avenue is a classic in Montreal. However, ever since they changed their menu, they don't serve my favourite item anymore (œufs coin coin), which made me decide to remove a star from them because they do not stand out from all the other brunch places in Montreal anymore. They serve breakfast like a two or three course meal, and the entree is a skewer of fruits, and then they bring the ordered meal. I had the smoked salmon bagel, which was decent and the portion of smoked salmon was very generous. Overall, the quality and taste of the food served here is pretty consistent and never disappoints. They serve a good selection of coffee and other lattes as well.The vibe is a fun one, not too snooty nor too posh. I also want to point out that there is always a line after 10:30 on the weekends."

It's been a while since I've come and I definitely waited way too long to return! But this was my 1st time at this location. Bottom line, it did not disappoint! I couldn't resist ordering the Mac + cheese waffle, even though there were so many great options. It was delicious. I loved the seasoning on chicken. The portions of course are humungous, so don't forget to bring your appetite! I will definitely not go so long before coming back."

The meal is huge and I was stuffed by the end of it. The space is very cool with graffiti/cool artwork lining the walls and colourful, lit-up washrooms that are great for a silly picture.

I highly recommend you give this place a try if you're looking for some brunch downtown Montreal. They give you a fruit on a skewer as a free appetizer which was an amazing touch. I had a sweet and crunchy eggs benedict, which was eggs benedict with ham on top of French toast. my mom ordered the chocolate banana shake which I got to try some of which was also delicious. A little under $20 a person the prices are even reasonable!"

Their fruit skewers are pretty yummy and add a nice touch. The French toast is the best French toast I've had, it's somehow crispy on the outside but fluffy on the inside. How they accomplish that is besides me! The Californian Benedict was very good as well!"
/user_details?userid=vekEZkHLDO3iqm90es-rmw,Mazal S.,"Boise, ID",4 star rating,Wonderful service. We came here twice with huge group of ppl. Were served really fast and servers were very helpful and attentive. Loved the healthy options for kids and adults. But the bathrooms... were the coolest ones I've ever been in. Especially the red bathroom. They have the Dyson airblade tap with hands drayer fan. So cool! Felt like in a 60's movie with the endless mirrors and disco music. Only wish they installed the diaper station in a different room. My 9 months old was scared to be in the florescent / ultra UV themed bathroom. It was trippy for sure

Although he was friendly and gave me nice advice on the menu I think he got a little excited and forgot that he was working and thought he was at a night out ( I do have that effect on people) I had the Oreos milkshake, the indecisive with ham and home made sausage which was divine.

I had amazing carrot cake pancakes, which of course I topped with lots of Canadian maple syrup. AMAZING! The service was great, our waiter was so fun and sweet.**Reviews had me worried since they don't take reservations and we were a group of 5. I anticipated a long wait and line, but I arrived an hour before closing and there was a short line and we even were able to skip the line since they had a 5 person table available before a 2 person table. We probably waited on line no more than 10 minutes.So glad we got to check it out"
/user_details?userid=5QrlMMzUq_RoUlEyH2zcig,Judy K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Now please don't get me wrong the food is absolutely delicious, the decor is most definitely on point and the staff are all unique, friendly and hard working however I'm docking a star because  the owners just don't care. The last three times I've come here the floor has been short staffed and there's no structure enforced. Today I witnessed our waiter serve roughly seven tables alone; mostly small groups of 5-6. Now for the none waitstaff reading this review that means; serving water, then drinks and/or coffee, taking the order and explaining the very detailed-tons-of-options menu, dropping off individual fruit plates per client who ordered ANY dish, clearing said plates, refilling coffee, bringing main courses, refilling waters... etc etc etc.  We waited twenty minutes to be served and I patiently sat and watched our waiter do this all alone. No one ran a single plate or drink, he bussed more then the majority of his plates himself.. while the support staff did zero support. They were understaffed and management wasn't directing the busboy or helping his waiter who was clearly in the weeds.This is the third time that I've witnessed good waitstaff get thrown to the wolfs. Our waiter was apologetic and acknowledge us as much as he could, sure he forgot our hot sauce and he might of dropped a piece of toast but he was pleasant and did the best he could while upper management set him up to fail. Very disappointed in the owners."
/user_details?userid=Tnn_sY9W24ho4Kw9uwuK6A,Sheila C.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"Although I do feel like the mont royal location serves prettier food, this location is prime for the reduced wait times for delicious food.We got the eggs Benedict with Montreal smoked meat and an indecisive with pecan toast. Like my other review on the mont royal page, the eggs Benny's made well. Although the Benny's held a strong Montreal influence with the smoked meat, I think I prefer the original with ham. This is because the added mustard on top is a bit off balance for me. I must say though, the French toast here was beyond the mont royal location! Thick toast and a scrumptious pecan sugary treat topping. It was the best addition to the salty favours from the rest of the dish. The sausage was also cooked to perfection with a sweet after taste. The balance on the indecisive was better than the smoked meat Benny's. Overall, stellar performance by the L'avenue crew. Do expect to drop at least $25 a person at this brunch restaurant."
/user_details?userid=OOWr74yjYooXIxgOQD0vhg,Tatiana S.,"Frederick, MD",5 star rating,"The brunch at L'Avenue is top rated! With a diverse menu of options with plenty of vegetarian choices, I found myself pleasantly lost in their menu as I decided what to get. As a french toast connoisseur, I leaned towards the breakfast options and didn't regret any (caloric) decisions I made on this day. I had the banana nutella french toast with a side of scrambled eggs & blueberry basil mimosa. The french toast was the most delicious french toast I've ever had. Apart from it being drenched in an appropriate amount of nutella & English cream, the second best part was the toasted coconut flakes on top. The scrambled eggs were pretty good too and the blueberry basil mimosa made made feel like I was doing something healthy for my body  The service was good and the only negative thing is that, because of their popularity, you will wait in line for a bit. Totally worth it though!"
/user_details?userid=r6PbQjtij6gcalYWBBrILg,Maria B.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Fran fricken tactic breakfast !!!! I've been searching for a great breakfast place since my favourite spot got shut down and I'm very please with the find. L'Avenue is an amazing breakfast/brunch spot and the st Henri location really has a way of fitting in with that hipster/dive-y vibe. When I first walked in the decor really got my eyes I noticed a big neon sign for the lavazza coffee that they serve and a really cool bike piece that felt like it was right out of tron. The theme is continued in the seating area with a cool graffiti wall and the bathrooms have multiple neon lights and mirrors that are great to play around in and take some pretty cool pictures The menu is a work of art with so many choice is felt almost wrong to not pig out a bit. To start we ordered a strawberry and watermelon mimosa and baileys coffee, while the waitress put the order in for drink we turned the page and saw the rest of the drinks menu so obviously we had to get more and the Caesar was my next go to The main plates were the duck eggs benny amazing taste and pretty self explanatory next dish and wait for it ... sweet savoury and crunchy eggs benny. Picture the most perfectly poached egg covered in a perfect hollandaise sitting on top of Swiss cheese and a plank covered French toast !!! Bruhhh I was in heaven for the duration of the meal. Somehow I managed to also eat the house potato's which were seasoned amazingly and I also chuffed down half a milkshake.Seriously don't know how I got up to walk to the car after all of that but I made it and would 100% recommend popping in for a great breakfast meal !"

I decided to have shakshuka for the first time and I fell in love!!! It was pretty good with potatoes, tomatoes, peppers and poached eggs. I had it with a baguette as you have a choice from breads to choose from. I think they could improve the dish with some more seasoning otherwise I really like it. My friend ordered a pecan french toast. It was very sweet but very scrumptious. You have the choice of having your caffeine drink in a cup or a bowl. I ordered a latte in a bowl which I enjoyed throughout my meal. However, it does cool down fairly quickly. I am lactose intolerant and unfortunately most restos don't carry lactose free milk. However, they had almond and soy milk so I chose that for my drink. Service was great. We didn't have to wait long. Our server was very good and helpful and polite.

Like good drinks at really nice prices? Well than this is the place for you, and certainly me!L'Avenue takes breakfast/brunch to a whole new level of awesome with massive portions and cheap drinks. We strolled in on Friday around 1 and waited only 5 minutes for a table. Not too bad considering I knew this place usually has lines out the door on weekends. Their egg game is strong.I got a massive 4 egg omelette behemoth called the St. Ambroise, which had beer braised ham and St. Ambroise cheese in it. Very very good. The only thing I was disappointed with was the St. Viateur bagel that came with it. Being a devout NYC bagel lover, I must just not like the Montreal style.My friends got two different kinds of benedicts that they said was very good and devoured. All the dishes came with an array of skewered fruit which was a nice refreshing start to the meal. The drinks were made well and very fairly priced. & Service was solid!Oh and the interior design of the place is really fun and vibrant. Walls splashed with crazy murals and bathrooms that have multi-color lighting and motorcycles hanging from ceilings. You know... just your average restaurant decor!"

Just like the main brunch spot, the dishes maintain their great quality and generous portion! The same menu and atmosphere is kept as well. And because this location is much bigger than the one in Montreal, the line-up and the wait time for the food is much shorter, and the service is much faster.

Graffiti wall, cool colorful lights, suspenders and bow tie clad servers, garage door that open up the back terrace area.  However, the menu did not look like anything special other than two, YES, TWO, full pages of cocktails. Good looking out for the boozy bunch!  Thanks and cheers!It took me a while to decide on food because it all sounded the same. I let my server's recommendations narrow my selections and ordered the Duck Benedict and a coconut maple coffee concoction. The coffee was great. I had never heard of it before so of course I had to try it. Now, the duck...omg...that was good. The English muffin was a little tough, not sure why I had such a difficult time cutting through it but after a while I was getting so full; there wasn't any more room left for bread so whatever.  The poached eggs we perfect. The duck was tasty. The potatoes...man, you know a place is legit when something as simple as potatoes are spot on delicious!The service was excellent!  I did not get my servers name but she was so awesome.  I'm so glad a Yelper mentioned that she liked this location better than Mont Royal. She was not lying. It's fantastic. I suppose I cannot compare since I've never been to the other location but I've passed by several times and there was ALWAYS a long line. I'm not standing in any line when there is amazing food all over this city.  Anyway, back to my amazing server...she was delightful. Warm, charming, checked in with me at appropriate times, totally girl crushing on her!  Even the manager stopped by to check on how everything was.As if that wasn't enough...the surprises never end. Ok, so if you happen to be here and you are completely hungover or high I suggest not using their restrooms without assistance. You will not be able to find your way out.  Pictures attached....  Man, I forgot to snap a picture of the damn sink!  The water was a little too hot so I'm trying to look for the ""cold"" lever. Instead air is drying my hands!  Thanks, Dyson. You are a clever old man.  Love all your stuff. Hahahha...enjoyed this place thoroughly."

I definitely recommend the egg Benedict section. The portions are huge.I'm giving a 4 star just because the waiter knew that I got a birthday free meal but instead of communicating with his manager , I had to remind him several times. I understand that it was a busy day but instead of responding to me with the bill with both meals priced, "" sorry let me correct that or follow up with my manager"", he said ""the manager needs to approve it"". At that time, the manager has already approved it since we were seated. That's my only feedback that I could give for improvement. Otherwise the restaurant was great!"

We maybe waited 30 minutes before getting seated near the door but I was happy to be sitting indoors! The service was fantastic, quick and very friendly. Waiter was nice enough to decipher the extensive menu for us even though the place was packed. I opted for their pancakes with cheddar and bacon; portion was huge and I really liked the sweet and savoury mix too!

The braised pork recipe definitely was changed as it lacked the usual wow factor and gave us an is this even seasoned  feeling. We had no choice to try their Panko French toast instead which itself was only one soft bread and did not offer the crisp that panko is intended for.Service was great but after two attempts  the food quality is just not what it use to be and has reached a point where it no longer makes sense to spend your money there, as the quality and value once was no longer exists."

Their water is flavoured with huge slices of real watermelon, so refreshing! Really cool Decor with interesting graffiti art on one wall, all kinds of neat fixtures. Lovely polite staff and truly delicious food. Best breakfast potatoes I've had in a while! I really enjoyed this place and having finally tried it I would say it's certainly worth the wait. If you try to go early on a weekday you might have better luck getting in right away."

The line was there when we left :) It is a small place and this can partially explain the line. Staff are very nice and helpful. The food is plentiful and colourful (my choice was indeed). They serve some fruit to everyone before serving the meal. I liked the potato and how they make it here. Priced are similar to other brunch places I've been to.

First time here and we made the mistake of ordering one plate per person and we left half of the delicious food on the plate.

Next time I'm in Montreal I will come back for sure."

We all got the indecisive, where you get to pick eggs your way, 2 meats and 1 sweets from the menu. We all got different combinations with the fries. The carrot cake pancake and the guava ones were standout and delicious! The beer braised ham was meh for me but my boyfriend loved it. The sausage was yummy and the creton was a lovely surprise. We also tried the exotic juices, the mango pineapple and the pinapple corriander one.  We ordered 2 of each, and little did we know THEY ARE HUGE. I think they were for sharing, haha. The corriander one is lighter in flav and more herbaceous, if thats what you like. The mango pineapple is just what you think it would taste like- sweet. TLDR; carrot pancake and guava pancake are must tries. Get the indecisive to try alot of diff things. Portions are giant, share or take home if you can. WORTH THE WAIT!"

Their breakfast was good, but nothing amazing, and not worth waiting more 45 minutes for. We also couldn't really enjoy the decor as we were seated close to the exit/entrance. They have a ton of options and their portion sizes are large. All the food is aesthetically appealing, but overall the food was just ""good"". Service was decent, but slow as they were incredibly busy.The smoothies were alright, but so incredibly thick (one smoothie can serve two, fyi). I got Bobby Does Dallas, which is basically beef, potatoes, and bbq sauce skillet with scrambled eggs on top. Delicious for the first several bites, but quickly becomes overwhelming to the taste.Still worth a try if you're in Montreal and have time to spare.Fun surprise - visit their restroom but be wary of their scalding hot water that somehow turned on without me understanding how."

I went to the new-ish location on Notre-Dame on a Wednesday for ""brunch for lunch"". Nice restaurant amid the horrible construction currently ongoing on Notre-Dame. I think maybe because of that fact, there were SO MANY flies and bugs banging and buzzing against the window right next to where we were seated, which made for a less than appetizing environment. If it wasn't for bugs, I would've probably given this place 4*. I loved my vegetarian omelette with baguette bread. Loved the fact that they served the fruits on a separate plate so thumbs up for that! The coffee was your average, refillable filter coffee that's much needed at that time of day.I would only go back if they fix their bug problem!!"

You'll see it through their service, execution, and atmosphere. This second location is not as busy as their original location, which means you get the same experience but probably with better service here. I ordered the bacon eggs benedict and latte which was the perfect combination I needed for my first day in Montreal. I felt that I was transported back in the 80s with the Polaroid camera menus, music, and retro decor, and recorders. The eggs benedict was executed with perfection. The hollandaise was not too runny or thick. What was surprisingly great was the bacon. It married well with the spinach and asparagus. Another well-seasoned side was the potatoes. When I thought I couldn't be even more impressed, the complimentary fruit skewer was the perfect refreshment I needed. The only thing I, unfortunately, could not give outstanding review was their latte as the woman barista did not calibrate the machine well in the morning and gave the drink this subtle off-taste. I'm glad I was able to experience at least one great dining experience here in Montreal. It helped make the trip worthwhile. Kudos to the talented french chefs in the back."

The menu is just the right amount of sweet and savoury, ""the indecisive"" option caught my eye-the one that you can get sweet and savoury.

Finally I had the omelet with goat cheese, which I was happy with. Definitely worth a visit, but if you don't like waiting in line ups, better go during the week."

The bathroom here is also one of the most lit bathrooms I've been to date - it was quite an experience using their bathrooms lol. My only suggestion is to be more attentive on service. By the time we were finished, we ended up sitting for 15 minutes waiting for our server to give us the machine for our bills. We ended up just paying upfront even though most of the patrons have left by then (we left at almost 3). Overall, great place for brunch!"

I WIll steal a bite from my friend's Benedicts (duck confit or steak). It's inevitable.However, I am upset that the grand Marnier brulee french toast did not make the new menu.

The place is new, big and bright. The decor is close enough in both locations.I go there during weekends. Always expect to find a line from 10am to 2:00pm.  For small groups (table of 4 or less), the waiting time could go as long as 20min and for big groups (more than 5) the waiting could go beyond an hour. I had to wait once for 1hour & 10min and I can tell that it was worth it.Right at the entrance, you can take sneak peak at the kitchen and check the chef preparing the platters. You will also notice the big Nutella jars ! Once you're in, facing the bar you will notice that big transparent water container filled with watermelon. They serve water from this container and it tastes good. The watermelon remove the back taste of the chlorine you get from drinking tap water.When it comes to ordering, all their platters are good. You won't be disappointed. Nevertheless, if you do not know what to choose, go for the L'Indecie. I posted a pic of that dish. The bathrooms are designed in a funky way.Despite the waiting time, the service is excellent and feel free to ask questions to the waiters as they are professional and will be very happy to answer all your questions."

Also:The server didn't bring in the correct order for one of us and that person had to wait for the order to be reprocessed. By the time her entree came, the rest of us were done eating.

I have never been to their other location in Plateau Mont-Royal.We wait about 45 minutes to get in but we were lucky to cut the line since we were only 2 and everyone in front of us were larger groups. If you want to try this restaurant (which you should!), I suggest you go only with one friend. We had the duck confit Benedicts and the ""I'll take it all"" plate. The plates are enormous, the waitress later told us there is an option to share a plate.Both came with the largest fruit skewer I have ever seen. Fruits were fresh and sweet. The duck Benedict was great. LOTS of duck with caramelized onions, the poached eggs were cooked perfectly. And the site of potatoes, OH.MY.GOD. So good, plus you can add one of their hot sauce or Cajun spices, available on the table. Then ""I'll take it all"", a plate of eggs your way, French toast, pancake, bacon, herbs sausage, pork rillette, braised ham, beans, potatoes and a side of bread (choice of bread, Baguette or St-Viateur bagel. Scrambled eggs were very fluffy, and probably represented more than two eggs. Ham looked a little like pulled pork and made me regret my benedict choice. Rillette was creamy and topped with pickled onions. I am not a fan of beans but I have to admit that they were good. We did not touch the pancake or French toast so I cannot comment on that. French toast looked a little dry. All plates are served with real maple syrup, which is always a plus. Coffee is not included, which I always find a little disappointing.

The Basic Omelette was exactly what its' name implies: basic and an omelette made of four eggs making it thick and impossible to finish. However, I must give L'Avenue credit for making absolutely phenomenal smoothies with kale, and other vegetables I don't remember that actually tasted great, and for the fruit they serve with maple syrup - Very Canadian! In short, while lacking in the basic omelette department, L'Avenue did not disappoint in all other aspects, (including service and decor) but make sure to get an interesting main dish if you can afford it and avoid my mistake."

I've passed my L'Avenue several times and there's usually a line, but we were lucky to arrive just early enough for there to be some open seating still. Walking in, one can't help but be struck by the decor: a motorcycle hanging from the ceiling in front of a graffiti mural, cute asymmetrical lighting above the booths, retro chairs, a huge replica of a can of syrop d'erable, a gigantic mirror in the back. A good selection of music served as a backdrop as we checked out the cleverly-designed game show themed menus. Food wise, lots of great choices, but for my birthday, I went for the duck Benedict, and it was definitely what one might expect: rich, fatty, juicy. Not sure if I'd order that on the regular, but it was delectable to say the least. My boo got the ""Indecisive"" with the Creme Brûlée French toast (amazing), the homemade sausage and cretons. All the food was on point. Their coffee by the way is cheaper than Timmys but a million times better (however I doubt they take to-go orders for it). Finally, nature called and I paid a visit to thee infamous restroom. Nothing like taking a tinkle while surrounded wall-to-ceiling by black light-illuminated artwork. I felt like I was peeing in outer space. In short, L'Avenue is a one-of-a-kind dining experience that hits on all the essentials: food, service, and ambience.

We got our menu when we got our table and a few moment later we got our water which is great as we didn't need to request for it and at the same time she ask us if we want it coffee and we all accepted. The coffe was good but I am not a black coffee taste person so a normal flavor coffee would be fine since I had cream and sugar. We all order Milkshakes and 2 of us got a shot of espresso in it, I got choco-banana milkshake and the other 2 got oreo biscuit milkshake. The waitress were friendly. They took our order where we all order different egg benedict, I took steak & egg benedict, my girlfriend took Montreal benedict smoked meat and my friend got Saint-Ambroisse Benedict. It was really delicious and we got our plate fast too. We even got a small entree of fruit to start off and there was a few mix of different fruit to eat.The only thing why i would reduce one star it's because the time we waited for our table, before we could order and to get our bills. But it's understandable has there was a lot of customer and a lot of people came to eat there. I would recommend the place. It wasn't too noisy and the environment was good."

I have eaten in some great places but this was the most incredible Eggs Benedict I've had. They used a pulled pork instead of ham, the hollandaise sauce was perfect, the eggs equally perfect. But those potatoes - roasted somehow and just incredible. But it wasn't just my breakie, it was the skewer of fresh fruit that everyone got, the giant smoothies thy were all so delicious, his awesome the staff and ambiance were all just great.Montreal has some real gems but for breakfast this is by far the best place I've ever been to. Oh - and the prices are competitive with any chain restaurant but you're eating some of the best Montreal has to offer. There is always a line up and it was packed from the second we got there to the moment we left but now I know why."

The decor of Avenue is super hype as usual, featuring street art graffiti wall, eccentric model, motorcycle on the wall, crazy neon toilets (all three of them were different and insanely original), so it's very instagrammable in every aspect. However, they didn't offer the fruit brochette as they were doing at Avenue Mont-Royal, but that's a minor detail. I ordered Huevos Rancheros, which is tortilla with generous salsa mountain, cheddar, egg as well as potato on the side, the portion was huge and the price very fair. I would definitely come back again!"

/user_details?userid=chgTnp84tlV4UUJlfIVJzA,Anuj S.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"After having breakfast at the hotel, a bunch of friend we were with decided to have brunch. I guess most of them had missed the hotel breakfast. I had hoped to go with the lunch menu to get a sandwich or something like that, but after sitting down we found out that they don't do the lunch menu on weekends. The only other thing that was inconvenient was that there was a really long wait, which was a bit frustrating. But this place did have some great breakfast...Some of the biggest fluffiest pancakes I've ever seen. The menu was all in French, so that made it a bit difficult. I didn't realize crepes were pancakes until we asked the waiter. He was super-helpful with options and so forth. So the pancakes came with this nice creamy syrup on top plus maple syrup on the side. They were also topped generously with fruits. Oh, that's one thing at L'Avenue... there are TONS of fresh fruits. You get an entire plateful of this fruit kebab when you first sit down - that was pretty cool. With all the sugary goodness going around, I really enjoyed my order of savory breakfast potatoes with my order. That balanced all meal out for me. I could only finish two of those pancakes... I strongly advise sharing for people who visit this place as the portions are enormous.Would definitely recommend for a big hearty breakfast."

/user_details?userid=Qwrbfgn8iGcHQ5MaQfXiTA,Seasy H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"So amazing! What an awesome brunch experience. Typical of Montreal brunch places, we waited ~30 minutes for a table. It was a Saturday morning, typical brunch time, so that was nothing unexpected. The first thing we noticed was the menu. The designs and names were so quirky and cute! I got the nutella latte, which tasted exactly how you'd think it would taste. Caffeinating and chocolatey, perfect for a Saturday brunch. I love duck, so it was obviously the duck benedict for me. The indécis is perfect for anyone who doesn't know what to get! I saw a tip saying it was better to ask for the pancakes on the side, which is what we did. A definite bonus: the filter coffee is both unlimited and cheap! Overall amazing brunch with fantastic drinks, main dishes, and side dishes (those potatoes though omg). 5 stars well earned."

That hole in the wall that always seems to have a massive lineup? Yup, you've found it. The place is quite cramped for their enormous popularity but you will definitely enjoy your time there. Your menu looks like a dating game show; interesting! The food is quite tasty. Being used to your traditional breakfast places that give you the choice of brown or white bread, I was shocked when they asked if I'd like brown, white, baguette or bagel (bagel, please!). My favorite part of my dish was the crème brûlée French toast - so crispy and sweet. I will surely be back!"

The diverse menu has something to offer to every taste, ranging from conservative to more original dishes. My favorite was the ""indecisive"" option, where you get to choose from different savory and sweet options to build the perfect plate for yourself. I had high expectations coming to L'avenue's new location, and I was not disappointed. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant is modern yet laid-back. Even on a Tuesday morning the place was vibrant and the staff was energetic and timely. The presentation of the dishes was simple but appealing. I really enjoyed their cretons and the mac and cheese pancakes which were the sweet option that I chose (although they were more savory than sweet...). The oreo milkshake was just perfect, not too sweet, but it should definitely be shared as it is pretty huge. Most of the meals were very filling and I felt like the staff was used to preparing leftover boxes. Don't forget to visit the restrooms in this location! Each one has a unique and hypnotizing setup. Overall a perfect brunch!"

The Reese milkshake and maple syrup coffee are pure delight. The ingredients are clearly fresh and the open kitchen increases your confidence.

/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"This was my first time at this location -I came here for brunch on a Saturday around 1ish. There was a lineup but not a huge one and the wait for a table wasn't too long (although we were two -I think the wait time for larger groups would be longer since the space inside isn't huge). The service was friendly and the prices aren't over the top. The decor in the avenue restaurants is always a little funky (In a good way) bright upbeat colours and always clean. Their filter coffee was actually very good compared to most breakfast places (they use lavazza coffee  I believe) Even their water has a little something extra always cold with a hint of watermelon flavour. I tried an egg Benedict dish which was very good such great flavour without being overpowering and the portion size was more than enough to be filling. My boyfriend had a chorizo scramble which was also a huge portion and was very tasty , but he said he would prefer to order one of their more unique items like the one I had because it's something you can't really order elsewhere in terms of the flavours and  the unique twist they put on the dish.they also bring you a little plate of fruit as a kind of free starter which is a nice touch . I would recommend this spot to anyone who wants good quality breakfast/brunch since they have your more classic eggs and bacon dishes but also offer some more unique options for the more adventurous eater ! (Lunch items also available for those who aren't crazy about breakfast but still want to go out with their brunch loving friends or significant other etc) . No outdoor seating available but they have a somewhat open concept towards the back of the restaurant on warmer days where you can still enjoy the fresh air"

But one Saturday we were in the area rather early and decided to give it a try. God, was it worth it!!! Starting with the coffee. Simply the best coffee of the kind I had in Montreal so far. Real coffee. Everything was delicious, inventive, in generous portions. I will definitely go back, even though I got the impression the line outside is more due to the time it takes them to clean a table than to the amount of people wanting one."

All that being said I think this is my new favorite place. So far the best regular coffee I've had with a brunch. The food portions are very generous and quite tasty. In a party of three we couldn't really decide from all of the interesting options available so they conveniently have an ""indecisive"" option which allows you to mix and match some signature sides. The music was great, the vibe was hip and fun, the service was excellent and even the bathrooms were fun with different colour coded themes! Definitely recommend!"

The atmosphere is fun and inviting and I loved the decor around the restaurant. I started off with a latte in a cup and it was delicious. The menu is big, there's lots to choose from which led me to decide on the ""Indecisive"" breakfast which let's you choose the choice of 2 savoury items and 1 sweet item. This meal comes with 2 eggs, potatoes and either a st-viateur bagel, baguette or toast. I chose sausage and baked beans for my savoury and the caramel pecan French toast for my sweet and I had wheat bread. The sausage was delicious, and the French toast was by far the best thing I have ever had! However very  sweet as one might expect, I could only finish half of it. My only complaint is the potatoes, way too much garlic in my opinion. I only had a taste and didn't touch them the rest of the meal. Overall I'm very pleased with my experience and the food was superb. I will definitely return!"

I then kept waiting for coffee refills and then he forgot that I wanted just a little more. By this time, I was ready to go, so he did offer me a coffee to go, but then payment was next, he brought the receipt and when I took out my AMEX card, he kindly rejected since they did not accept AMEX but then walked away. He didn't even wait to see if I had another method of payment. I would have left him a bigger tip if he was a little more attentive. I got up, payed someone there with cash and left."

I've tried a lot of the popular places like Cora's, Allo Mon CoCo, and the like, but none of them ever clicked with me. L'Oeufrier is okay too, but it just didn't have what I was looking for. This place checks everything off my list: sick decor, nice staff, clean and visible kitchen, huuuuge selection on the menu, and great drinks. I haven't read the other reviews, but I really recommend checking out the washrooms (as weird as that sounds - lol, just thank me later!) I ordered a nutella coffee to start and wow - it does not compare to the plain blah coffees I got at other places. It was served with a strawberry and a little chocolate, so maybe next time I'll order it after my meal. The omelette I got was so big and filling that I had to take part of it home! This place is pricy but you really get your money's worth. This is a new favourite spot for me!

When I went last time, it was hot and I was thirsty and yet I couldn't drink the water I was served. Please keep in mind that not everybody likes watermelon and I sure don't like people assuming my tastes. I know it's not that big a deal but afterwards I had to justify why I wanted tap water when I should be served that in the first place. Anyway food is awesome but beware of the watermelon water!"

Nice menu I really enjoy their eggs Benedictine, especially the chorizo and the spinach/goat cheese, but if you like big brunch the""bon ben j'me la prend toute"" is made for you. Everything is good, go over there for a nice brunch :)"

I had been eyeing the carrot cake pancakes for the duration of our half-hour wait in line, but when it came time to order, I chickened out and ordered the grilled chicken egg white omelet instead (no pun intended). The omelet was studded with chunks of grilled chicken as well as spinach and swiss cheese and was absolutely delicious and satisfying. On the side, they offered homemade jam that I happily spread onto my gorgeously toasty baguette. Luckily, my friend ended up ordering the carrot cake pancakes so I got few fork-fulls in and boy oh boy were they good. Although my omelet was pretty great, it would be foolish to order anything by those pancakes. Fluffy, sweet, and smeared with cream cheese frosting and walnut pieces, I still dream about them sometimes."

It was the first breakfast we had, and definitely the best (even though the other food was great too)! We went on a week day and there was still a wait, but not too long which was appreciated (the best restaurants are worth waiting for)!I liked the serving of fruit first, and my eggs with mushrooms over toast was phenomenal, and enough to take home for seconds! There was a huge variety on the menu. Would definitely recommend going to this establishment! I'd definitely go back if in Montreal again!"

We started with fresh fruit. There are a dozen delicious options for eggs Benedict. I had eggs with caramelized onions, mushrooms and cheese. Fantastic. Great coffee and fresh juice. We didn't have mimosas but they appeared on point. I'll definitely be back!"

The service was good, coffee was great, food was even better! In a sea of mediocre, over priced brunch spots- especially in Griffintown, this place is definitely worth checking out!"

Cappuccino awesome, fruit plate before meal is delicious. My husband ordered the complete meal called something or other in Spain. It was really good. The real treat was my meal. It was a sweet/savory/crunchy eggs Benedict. A.MA.ZING. must have. Service also excellent!!"
/user_details?userid=eL9wiskWF5bnlvZQdjbajg,Virginia Y.,"Western Hill, Saint Catharines, Canada",1 star rating,Very unimpressed with the service. I have food allergies and the staff was rude and not helpfull at all! They were not willing to accommodate at all or make a lunch item early because they had nothing that I could eat. The closest option was a fruit skewer. Which was pitiful. My children order fruit and egg platers and they had more fruit then what was offered to me. If you have any allergies don't go here!

/user_details?userid=wXwOc-uRstawwnR-zt_yFA,Betsy L.,"San Francisco, CA",3 star rating,"Went this morning and got there early, so there was no wait.  We both ordered an omelette, his with a bagel, mine with brown bread.  While we waited, they served us each a fruit brochette.  Sadly it was put on a plate that was so hot out of the dishwasher it was still quite hot when it got to us.  The fruit was not great. I had a couple of pieces.  The cantaloupe was not really ripe, the banana was brown on the ends.  I gave up after that.  Finally the main meals arrived.  They looked good, but they really aren't omelettes.  They are more like frittatas.  There was their homemade sausage in mine, and I really enjoyed that.  The omelette was massive, but mediocre.  Not bad, just mediocre for the money.  The brown bread was a multigrain and it was great.  It had almost no butter on it though, which would have made it even better.  Service was weird.  We were served by a few different people, and everyone seemed to share every table.  This doesn't really make for good service.  It took quite a long time to have anyone notice we were done eating and clear our plate.  Most of the people who finished before us left with a take home container.  We ate half of our omelette each, yet when they cleared the plates no one asked if we wanted it to go.  Like the food, the service was not bad, just mediocre.  For the money and hype, I expected a lot more."
