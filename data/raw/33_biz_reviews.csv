When we got here they told us we may have to wait up to 45 minutes, which we agreed to, another move we didn't regret! The food was amazing and rather unexpected, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable. We enjoyed every bite of every plate!! Good environment for a date or a fun night out with friends!"
/user_details?userid=MWCPUFk-fnNXehPosCtwHA,Geneviève F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Got this delivered. Ramen was great, best delivered ramen ever. Got the one with pork broth, creamy and delightful! Thick noodles were great. Vegetables were fine, but not wow (could have been better however since I selected that over meat). I loved the amount of customization available, too! However, the appetizers didn't come out well : pork belly skewers & oyster mushrooms were meh. Pork belly was overcooked. Mushrooms were soggy, kind of cold. I would like to believe however that with the right selection, this would be a 5/5. I shall be back and try it again! :)"
/user_details?userid=yACLb6lUDPjw0g5JrNwXMg,Kyle S.,"Atlanta, GA",4 star rating,"Rated as one of the best ramen spots in Montreal, so I decided to give it a shot. Busy spot with dim lighting, pretty simple lay out with tall tables and bar stools. Bar sits at the entrance but you cannot order from the bartenders unless you already have a bar seat for food, which was kind of a bummer deal. I started with a gin cocktail which was a bit strong, but I liked it. I got the karaage and the tonkotsu ramen. The karaage was definitely the highlight of the meal. The chicken was fried perfectly, and really didn't mess the mayonnaise. The put some lemon over it which I thought was a nice touch and gave it another level of flavor. The ramen was great, but nothing I would rank; maybe I was there on an off-night. The soft boiled egg was a bit overcooked. And maybe I'm used to American portions, but I left the place still a bit hungry even after my app and my ramen. Either way, the karaage was delicious and I definitely recommend trying it if you go."
/user_details?userid=h8xK7S1xXUBP2qXW0ZPxxA,Laura R.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"A popular restaurant with the twenty something crowd, make sure you make a reservation, or else you will wait a while. We enjoyed our food, and the highlights were the salmon tartare and the beef short ribs, which you cook at your table. Prices are very reasonable. You share 5-6 dishes amongst 2 people. One thing which I didn't like was that if you make a reservation, you cannot order from the ramen menu. It is supposed to be so good, so was disappointed that we could not try it. Perhaps they should change the policy, so that you can order 2 dishes, and then have the ramen."

XDThis time even though I told my friend that my mom's braised pork is better, he insisted on trying it anyway because he never tasted it before so we ordered it along with my favs: king oyster mushrooms, salmon tartar w mthfkn tempura nori crackers (omagerd!) smoked duck breast and of course, the ice cream & mochi dessert. We also had some cocktails & sake.The waitress was very nice & helpful (I mean, the staff here is always so great anyway)I already knew I'd like it as it's one of my go-to spots and my friend, it was his first time, liked it too so I thought Id post some more pics just because."
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"We were starving after being out all day. The crew wanted ramen so we Ubered over to Ichigo Ichie/Yokato Yokabai. They share the same digs but we sat on the Ichigo Ichie side.We dropped in on a Sunday evening (around 8:00pm) and put our group of 15 on the wait list. There was no chance we'd get seated together so we split up our group to increase our chances/lessen our wait time.The place was bumping and the crowd a fun mix of students and young professionals. Didn't realize the place was so big; if you walk down the stairs, there's even more seating. Service is friendly, young and enthusiastic. Makes for a fun, vibrant ambience.The menu is izakaya style; appetizers, salad, cold, hot, fried, noodle & rice and dessert. There's a separate ramen menu from the YY side; pick your broth, toppings, noodles and extras. A bit odd that you can't order thick noodles after 6:00pm.For the ramen, they bring out four condiments; garlic, sesame seeds, pickled ginger and chili oil. - Premium select Gekkeikan sake haiku (~$36.00) - I can't remember exactly how much this bottle cost. Surprisingly, for a Gekkeikan, it was reasonably smooth. Good to share between four.- Tonkotsu ($14.50) - for my bowl, I opted for the cha shu and thin noodles. Kept it simple to see how their ramen is in its purest form. My buddies did the same. Verdict = very, very close to what you get in Japan. Broth was fantastic; rich, hearty with good depth and flavour. Noodles had a satisfying toothsome bite. Everyone devoured their bowls.Easily the best ramen I've had in Montreal. 4.5 stars."

The appetizers were so-so, but I'd go back for that ramen again and again. I took ""normal"" for salty level and green onion level and it was perfect."
/user_details?userid=rkPrz6uwJIefZdH2Oqv4Tg,Christian C.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The boozy brother of Yokato Yokabai, this Izakaya has a wide menu of classic Japanese dishes and beautiful punchy cocktails with a lot of floral depth. My favorite cocktail is the Tokyo Sour, it comes with a smoked cherry and I could see they add smoke to cocktails on the spot using a smoking gun and that has inspired me to be more adventurous in my home kitchen with smoke. They have two vegan items on their menu, apart from the vegan ramen of course, and these are the agedashi tofu and the the yasai tempura. I'd love to see even more vegan items on the menu, but regardless, this is my all time loved Izakaya in Montreal, and the lines speak for themselves."
/user_details?userid=xg_96kkO-lF9oCc1PzrQgA,Leo L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is a must place if you like noodle soups.I recommend that you get here early, and that you are ready to wait. I suggest once you get on the waiting list you stay for a drink or look for something to do on St. Denis street. It is worth it!One experience I like to share about this place is when I was dinning here with two other friends. We were finishing our soups and suddenly a waiter asked us if we had any inconvenience in moving to a smaller table. He explained his demand so he could sit 6 people where we were at that moment. We did not hesitate. Not two minutes went by and the waiter offered us something on the house for the trouble. These gestures make you feel like home.The other part is you can customize your Noodles. I will always recommend a place where the food stays personal, the sake is good, and when its more about the experience than just eating."
/user_details?userid=ZFxfMReOr2SFvSSRmGZ7Gw,Vikrant T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is one of the popular izakayas in the neighborhood. But prepared to wait 15-20 minutes at least. Also, it is very noisy inside. If you go with a big group, you can only order from the tapas. However, in our case, the waitress managed to make an exception upon request for vegan food. The food is good and have enough vegan options, but mostly greasy. I prefer other izakayas with more spicy and savory options."

I am so glad I finally made it there after having it bookmarked for months!!!!I give it a well deserved five stars for food, service, ambiance and presentation. We had: tuna, fried calamari with salt and pepper which was absolutely delicious, the beef was even more delicious and we were also given a plaque to fry the meat. Let's not forget to mention the best part of the meal... the desert!!!! I had such a hard time what to order since I was debating between 2-3 items . I ended up ordering the matcha tiramisu and it was to die for. I hope you get the chance to go there at least once in your life and have the same experience I did. Tip: rsvp before going  since it's a very popular restaurant even on a Tuesday night ;-)"

When we got there, The atmosphere was hot and stuffy, the staff gave us looks as we were waiting for our food. They said that the food would be ready in twenty minutes so it should have been ready by 11:04, however, they were quite late and it arrived at 11:34. We had already paid and we were waiting for a half an hour in the hot waiting area with little accommodation. We already tipped but I feel that we shouldn't have due to the service we were given. Overall a poor experience, I have lost my appetite."

I came here on a recommendation of a friend of a friend. Came in on a Friday night around 6pm & waited about 15 min for a table for 2.Loved the option to customize your ramen! Especially loved the options you have for seasoning which comes out in portable containers (see picture) & where you can add as much as you want :) The soup base is PHENOMENAL. I generally don't drink much of the soup after, but I couldn't help myself to consuming every last bit in this case. The noodles were also perfectly cooked in my opinion & everything came together so well. It was a packed restaurant & had a bar vibe to it. I enjoyed the hustle & bustle of the clearly hardworking servers and appreciated the attentiveness when they had a moment to spare. 10/10 would go back if I ever find myself in Montreal again!"

The service was amazing. Can I please give a special acknowledgement of our waitress Sue? She is the tiniest, funniest, sweetest thing ever!  She was so knowledgeable of the menu gave great suggestions and was just really attentive despite it being a packed house!We opted for the negima , butabara, kinoko udon, and zuke don! Everything was delicious but the butabara (pork skewer) was seasoned so well I would have had  5 more! And I was basically licking the bowl of kinko udon! For dessert my friend could not stop looking at what was coming out of the kitchen which resulted in us getting the donuts from the their fall menu. I have a sweet tooth so really didn't contest too much and they were delicious. Honestly I would come back Montreal just for this food! Thank you guys"
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"The decor, atmosphere and service are the reasons I'm not giving this place 3 stars. Our waitress was nice, attentive and using her iPad, remembered our names and our orders. Our waters were frequently filled up. It's a VERY LOUD and HOT restaurant so if you're a big group around the large rectangular tables on the top floor, chances are you'll only hear the people next to you while sweating buckets. Dress lightly.Overall, I found it overpriced. I had one cocktail (mango & berry) and ordered the ebi mayo and the albacore tuna sashimi for $43 (including tip). The ebi mayo is essentially 2 shrimp tempura cut up with mayo and some fried noodles... it was ok, kind of bland. The tuna was delicious, fresh and paired really well with the pink peppercorns. I got to try the garlic and pepper edamame which was delicious. The deep-fried calamari appetizer burst in flavour and the beef sirloin rice bowl tasted pretty good. Props on plating too - creative visuals using gorgeous plates. Again, just overpriced. Fun vibes, great service and would consider returning if I wasn't paying!!"
/user_details?userid=GnJ2w63izmrICmt1wNCGOA,Laurence V.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,"I came here for my mom's birthday. Since we were a group of 5 people, we decided to reserve ahead of time. Good thing we did because we skipped a line and got the spacious booth! The service was a bit slow throughout the night but the busboys were fast because the moment a plate was empty, they removed it from the table to make room for the next dish. We got the edamame (average), sa-mon tartaru (my favourite dish of all time), tako carpaccio (tasty, tender octopus), gyu tataki (good), kakuni (good but fatty), karaage (average), ebi mayo (really good and huge portion), nikujaga (savoury but can be soggy), kinoko udon (too salty), garlick fried raisu (biggest surprise of the night, amazing), zuke don (average). We were so full by the end of the night but very satisfied. I asked the waitress if they did anything special for birthdays, and she said no. However, she surprised us with a cake for my mom! It was very nice of them and greatly appreciated it. We ended up paying about $40 per person which I think is reasonable for the amount of food we got. I had a great experience here and would definitely come back! I cannot give a perfect score because we were not aware that if we reserved, we couldn't order ramen. We still enjoyed our dinner but it would have been nice to have the delicious ramen from the other side. For this reason, I do have to give 4.5/5 stars."
/user_details?userid=9-AbJMMxFABvQzrgnHCS8w,Benedict D.,"Alhambra, Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,"Visiting the city the first We are group of four people here for dinner, the pros are the food is good and the price is reasonable. The service is good, the people here are very polite and willing to help. The cons are the parking is very hard to find since they don't have a private parking space for costumers. The waiting time is more than 15 mins, and the waiting area is very narrow to fit more than 6 people. I checked in with their staff, they told me there was no space available, but when we went inside, there were a few empty tables available. I am not sure if they do that to pretend they are over-booked, or those tables are reserved. Overall, it is a good place to hang out and get some good food."

The staff hand torch it at the table, and the torched mackerel tastes so good with the acidity of the lemon and sweetness from the kiwi! The flavor combo blew our minds!Garlic fried rice - delicious and not clumpy! It has great garlic flavors and sesame, and the most surprising element is the ume that gives the fried rice an unique fragrance!Carbonara udon - nicely cooked and chewy udon!! It was such a good texture. Overall flavor was good and doesn't feel too heavy.Karaage - batter was a bit heavy for our taste, overall the chicken was well seasoned and tender.If we lived in Montreal, it would be one of our staple izakayas for sure! I think this place might be better than some popular izakayas in Toronto!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Large variety of tapas to eat with your ramen. The takowasa is a bit salty. The burdock roots and the salmon tartare with the nori chips are a must. I love the fact that you can customise your ramen according to the salt level. The service is quite fast and the staff is friendly. Would recommend this place if you cant decide between the ramen from yokato yokabai next door or the tapas.
/user_details?userid=0Hh53SYAw7JYclTCShWLbg,Eunice C.,"Little Neck, Queens, NY",5 star rating,This is the best Ramen place I ever been so far. The soup base is just amazing. You can totally taste the high quality and the hours of cooking for the soup. The Ramen noodles taste fresh made. And the half cooked egg just melt in your mouth. The service is pretty fast. And Bartenders are very nice and friendly. The green tea tiramisu and Macaroon are so delicious. The matcha on both taste very authentic. It gives you a real authentic Japanese food experience. I will definitely come back. I can have the ramen everyday

/user_details?userid=C2YxxeHBKtJ5Eokpi2urcQ,Anna N.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Some of the best ramen in Montreal - at least in the top 2-3. Although they're famous for their tonkatsu broth, it can be a bit heavy. My recommendation is, if you're a meat eater, either get vegetarian + meat or tonkatsu + vegetable toppings + a piece of meat or it'll be too heavy. Their vegetarian broth and the new sesame ones are great.The izakaya itself is a bit expensive but the quality is on par. I've never gotten it so I can't recommend any. The drinks are delicious and really well thought out. I recommend the tokyo sour or whatever it's called. Really unique. My boyfriend loves the negroni there and says it's his favorite in montreal.The service is extremely professional."
/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"After tasting the ramen in the small shop right inside named Yokato Yokabai, I left with very good memories of good ramen from Japan. Remembering this, I was itched to try the other restaurant. And then voila, the moment presented! My friend decided to organize her birthday in that restaurant on a Saturday evening. Being a large group, we had access to the higher floor, where they were able to reserve for about 25 people. So let's get to business now! Going in and checking the menu, I was kinda overwhelmed by the prices, I mean 12$ for small plates is kinda a big ask IMO. But that did not stop me and I was determined to try to get my nostalgic vibes from Japan again. After all, I decided to go for a few plates including a plate of beef where you can cook it yourself, a plate of fish belly, and many others that I cannot remember, unfortunately. I have to admit, it was good, but not outstanding, especially all things considered such as the pricing and the amount of food. The vibes at the restaurant were also very nice! Overall, I'll give it 4 stars, 1 lost because of value."

I am a regular at Yokato Yokabai, and this was my first time on this side of the restaurant. If you specifically want ramen, they seat you in Yokato Yokabai, and if you want an Izakaya menu, then they'll seat you in Icho Ichie.I had their Kinoku Udon, which was well done, but I thought the portions were too small. It was also quite pricey, which I was slightly disappointed about.I am also not crazy about the ambiance; it is loud, hot, and dark. The server looked like she wasn't happy to be working there, although she remembered our names and efficiently took our orders. They do, however, have an interesting 'Ginger Sapporo', which is essentially a slice of ginger in Sapporo beer for a $1 surcharge. It was an alright experience, but I was not crazy about the ambiance. The portions are a little small, but very tasty!"

Some may opt out of dining at Yokato Yokobai and just walk down the hall to order small plates; however, others may bypass the bar area to just focus on the ramen.  Restrooms are located down the narrow small-stepped stairs.  +down the hall from Yokato Yokobai+small Japanese plates+MIA host"

We rolled up, put our name on the list, went to a nearby bar, enjoyed a glass of wine and they called us when our table was ready. We were tucked into a booth that felt both cozy and in the thick of things, and the bartneder came over to do a complimentary shot with us because they took a little longer than they had estimated. Super kind and cheerful kickoff to a great evening. We ordered way too much food, as you do when you've been drinking hungry for an hour, but we left with zero regrets.This is basically the same menu as Yokato, and then some. You can get truly rich veggie ramen here as well as the crazy delicious pork on rice, and a take on French fries that is somehow both light and totally indulgent. Super great meal and awesome experience. Merci!"

They pack the room pretty tightly with tables, and it was far from what I would compare to being an intimate dining experience. 3) Come hungry, and order a lot of things communally for your table. This place has so many good little skewers and plates of tempura covered awesomeness that you'll want to try and share a lot of different things.Between the 2 of us, we over ordered to the point of having leftovers to take home. Even despite that, and throwing a couple drinks down each in the process, the meal was only around $120 post-tax/pre-tip. I've seen some people complaining about prices, but frankly for the amount we ate and drank, we were quite impressed. As such - 5 stars it is for Ichigo Ichie!"

First off, the shime saba (torched mackerel) was fantastic. It was served with torched kiwi as well, which was a strange mix, but the servers torch it in front of you. Quite a show! Though this is only after they forgot about our order and I had to remind the servers. Most of the food we ordered were below average compared to other Izakayas. For example their takoyakis were extremely mushy and had very little octopus in it. The menu is beyond overpriced for its quality. The reason why I gave it 2 stars was the absolute terrible service. I've never felt so attacked in my life. We were one of the first customers to walk in at opening (5pm) and they were already in a bad mood. At the door, one of the servers rudely told us to wait at the door to be seated, talking over my question, which was ""can we eat Ramen in this side of the restaurant?"". Throughout the night, the servers only did what they had to do, serve the food without looking or explaining the said dish, ignored me to the point I had to foolishly wave both arms in the air to get the 4th waiter's attention.There were only 2 great waiters this visit that did their job correctly, but honestly, 0 stars on service for the rest of the staff of about 5 people. Terrible terrible terrible. We were expecting to drink and enjoy our time tonight, but instead we felt very unwelcomed and had to finish off our night elsewhere."

So we arrive and they decided not to serve our table of 12 a few bowls of ramen.

Street parking available (in the residential zone). And please remember to make reservations, we wished we had done that before waiting about 30 minutes for a table. :) Also note there are 2 entrances to the restaurant. There's the ramen shop side and then there's the tapas side. Originally my partner and I wanted ramen but the line-up was so long we switched to the tapas. And we were glad we did because the tapas side includes ramen as part of their menu, yay! We ordered the chicken katsu as recommended by our Airbnb host. It was just simply Japanese fried chicken - made well but nothing too exciting - although the mayo type of sauce paired well with it! We also got a bowl of ramen - it was delicious!!! We have never seen the pork slices so thick and big - such a generous ramen shop (we were very satisfied!). The soup base and noodle itself were delicious as well, must have been made in house of course. We also ordered beef tataki. It reminded us of the one we ordered in Distillery District. It was very tasty as well. Lastly, the grilled calamari was worth trying - it was just quite a lot for 2 people though. These tapas would have been better if we came with a bigger group, so we can try a variety of their food. The barista was also very friendly as well. He recommended us a plum sake I think - I wanted something sweet! It was great. Overall, we had a great time eating here. We will come again when we visit Montreal again."

It's definitely a spot for those who are adventurous with food. My group of 6 luckily got seated right away on a Saturday night. The spot was packed, but the timing just worked out! We sat in a booth around the corner - not as good for people watching, but it made the space feel a bit more intimate.Ambiance is trendy and definitely feels like a izakaya in Japan, with all its unique dishes and fun atmosphere.

/user_details?userid=o6rHcSB3Z3F5PSy8YvzFqA,Sally X.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"3.5/5 - Came on a Friday night around 8:30 and waited 45 mins. Friendly staff, excellent service, nice ambience. The portions were very small - smaller than what you'd usually get at an izakaya. Our party of 3 ordered 6 dishes and still felt hungry (we typically don't eat a lot either), so I recommend at least 3 orders per person. We ordered:- takowasa (octopus tartare), spicy and pungent - torched mackarel, which was torched tableside - served with kiwi and lemon slices - amazing - garlic fried rice, which didn't live up to the hype. Small portions, cooked al dente, not worth it - grilled pork belly - juicy and fatty - karaage - ridiculously small portions but very good - smoked duck - delicious, comes with duck fat sauce"

/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",3 star rating,"I'm not sure if this review should be written for Ichigo Ichie or Yokato Yokabai. I actually wish I could somehow add the two businesses to my write up, but we were served in Ichigo Iche, so they are receiving the feedback. Sunday Thanksgiving night. Six of us are in mood for Ramen. The wait is 30 minutes and actually one of our friends is there 15 minutes early negotiating the table. We are finally seated in Ichigo Iche at a comfortable corner to order ramen. The set up is the following, if you want ramen, Ichigo Ichie will accommodate you and they will bring the ramen from Yokato Yokabai, but you need to wait in line, no reservations accepted. If you want Japanese tapas dishes you can reserve a table. As Yokato Yokabai is relatively small, bigger group will end up anyway in Ichigo Ichie. Meanwhile the underground floor was half empty, but this is the peculiar way the things are managed there. The food. The ramen broth is thick and heavy. The options are simple and you can select few side dishes, broth style (vegeterian, spicy...) and add extras. The ramen bowl is huge, it is enough to order one side dish and may be one ice cream for dessert to share between few. My friends raved about the fried chicken, but I'm not a fan. The fried gobo is my favorite. I also ordered the the agedashi tofu for the table to share, nice flavors, but nothing extrodinary. The ramen was delicious, but... I woke up early in the morning with bad pain in my tummy and I'm not the only one who complained from the same. We collectively believe the reason is the ramen was not boiling hot, when served and raw ingredients were added to it, indicating how slow were the things that night. That leads to the service. The service was slow and slightly disorganized up to the non pleasant point, we had to wait for drinks, for water, for food and of course bills. Would that impact the quality of the ramen, may be. I'm ultimately happy with the Bloody Ichigo, pretty decent version of the Bloody Caesar a la japonaise.Would I come back. May be, may be I would give Yokato Yokabai specifically a second chance as everybody claims it is the best ramen in Montreal, but I really don't know now."

/user_details?userid=ZGiwU16rhGvWAYUzkWL0xw,Boz X.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Ho.ly.kamoley. How is this place not on yelp?! It's pretty legit.That must have been the best japanese food I've had in my life. It's a tapas style restaurant, so a friend and I shared 9 dishes for a total of 40$ per person... Usual pricing I'd say, for an izakaya.Alright, I'll start a sorted list strting with what we liked best (see photos for reference):- Grilled black cod (5/5): o.m.g. Marinated to perfection, the taste, the texture, the sauce, everything was perfect. Downside: you can probably eat 4 portions of that - which translates to: pretty expensive.- White tuna with watercress ...(4.7/5): Whaaaaaaat, just try it, and don't forget to eat the pink peppercorns: it has a lemony tingling feel. It was so good I forgot the name of the dish...- Salmon tartare and avocado dip (4.5/5): Really have to eat them by putting avocado dip and salmon on the nori crackers.- Grilled squid (4.5/5): a whole squid grilled to perfection: not rubbery at all. Well seasoned, had a char flavour, and with a squeeze of lemon juice and japanese mayo, it's heaven for my tastebuds. - Takoyakis (4.5/5): fried calamari balls accompanied with fish flakes, mayo, and takoyaki sauce (similar to worcestershire sauce).- Negi-pon takoyakis (4.3/5): Not sure what it was that made it excellent, but the fried calamari balls was dressed with spring onions, mayo, and ponzu sauce (soy sauce + citrus vinegar).- Grilled steak on hot stone (4/5): Very well seasoned and marinated, but you have to cook it yourself on the hot stone - a unique experience. It's very fatty and chewy if not cooked properly (under or overcooked).- Simmered duck (3.5/5): Worth the experience of having smoke coming out of a covered bowl. The duck itself had the texture of pork belly and good flavours, but there were only 5 small pieces and it costs 10$... Not worth.- Jumbo shrimp tempura (3/5): Two jumbo shrimps that were fried to perfection and flavourful. The accompanying sauce was tasteless though, I don't remember what it was.- Japanese sausage (2.5/5): Waitresse hyped it up for us, but that was the biggest scam I've been through today. She said it is the best sausage she's had in her life, but I found it pretty average, and I don't think it's a subjective matter. The truth is, the sausage came as a pork patty, mixed with onion and possibly garlic and ginger, but it didn't taste like what she was describing to us, and certainly not a top tier sausage. Worse part, it was 2 for 6$.- Karaage (2/5): Now I understand why KFC is Japan's national restaurant. The fried chicken were just underseasoned KFC. The accompanying wasabi-mayo was underwhelming and didn't go well with the fried chicken. The chicken is dry and underseasoned. Lastly, the layer of batter was a bit too thick, so the pieces looked bigger than they are.I don't have a sweet tooth, but the desserts are worth a mention:- Green tea pudding (4.5/5): Tastes like green tea syrup on egg pudding. It was very tasty, but also very sweet.- Sake ice cream (4.5/5): Tastes like my rice cooking wine, but it's very balanced in terms of taste (of sake) and sweetness. Excellent.- Green tea tiramisu (4/5): Flavour faded in comparison with the green tea pudding. But looks more familiar to westerners and american born asians. People fought over the tiramisu, but the pudding was better gg.The ambiance is bar-like AND almost romantic. The waiters were very quick and attentive, grabbing finished plates from the table seconds after they're empty. And water was refilled before I thought I'd need more (5/5 for service)."

There are some cold fish dishes, we had salmon tartare, but no rolls.  Also, they love wasabi here.  Be warned if you don't like spicy or wasabi.  At least 3 dishes we had were not just unpleasant, but inedible to those in our party who didn't like spice or wasabi."

The location, ambiance, service, food and presentation are excellent! Every single detail is well thought of, and whatever you order you will not regret it. I got to try  Simmered duck,braised pork belly (this one is a must!), rice cake rolled in bacon  (tastes like cheese!great texture), tilapia ceviche and tuna sashimi seasoned and slightly grilled on the outside, and edamame spiced with garlic and red peepers to accompany all these plates!Desserts! Do not forget about dessert, Ichigo Ichie has homemade sake ice-cream. It is extremely soft and creamy, very well balanced. Oh, and the green tea tiramisu, definitively my favorite and a must try! (and I am not a big green tea fan, for those hesitant about the green tea word being there).Last but not least! Ichigo Ichie also have their own beer and they have cocktail drinks, but ask the bartender to make you a special invention. These guys know what they are doing.

I have to say this is just a regular Japanese restaurant. I wonder why people are so obsessed with Karage and endamame which are not consider as a real dish in Asia. The squid is not tender but dry.But they do have some specials like the deserts. I won't come back.
/user_details?userid=WmIqb6uCqJbxWp9k7ZU-hw,Jennifer T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Ichigo Ichie has two floors, the basement level only offers Ichigo's menu while the main floor has both Yokato and Ichigo's menus. Thus, you can order ramen and appetizers from Yokato and other Izakaya food from Ichigo. I actually prefer the main floor because I get to order the karaage and gobo from Yokato (I didn't quite like the ones from Ichigo and I will explain later).During our first visit, we asked the waiter if they take reservations and he said no, both Yokato Yokabai and Ichigo Ichie are under the same system: no reservation. However, once we got there this time, the waiter asked us if we had any reservation... We were quite confused to be honest... My best advice is to get there when they open (5:30 pm) in order to not get caught up in lines! The restaurant gets fill up quickly on the weekend.We ordered the simmered duck, jumbo shrimp tempura, stone grilled steak, kushimori, karaage, gobo and Yarai style grilled squid.The simmered duck had an interesting presentation. The waitress told me to get my camera (well phone) ready because the smoke disappears very quickly once she removes the cover! The duck breast was really yummy and tender. It is mixed inside a yuzu sauce and there is a spicy sauce outside the bowl that I didn't try because I don't eat spicy. But I find it overpriced for 5 small pieces of duck meat slices.. The jumbo shrimp tempura came with two jumbo shrimps and it was good (but the other time, the shrimps were chewier, I guess fresher). I liked how the shrimps were well-fried (but not over-fried) and the sauce went well with it. It also came with two shishito peppers.The stone grilled steak's meat was well-seasoned. However, the meat was definitely not steak meat.. It was short ribs (which I like) but I find the menu to be misleading. The stone was not hot enough for two rounds of ""steak"" grilling (but you can ask the waiter to re-heat it). The experience of stone grilling was fun but I wouldn't order this again if I go back.The kushimori came with 7 skewers: shishito pepper skewer, chicken gizzard skewer, chicken thigh skewer, chicken and leek skewer, Japanese sausage, pork belly skewer and bacon wrapped asparagus skewer. My favorite ones were the chicken gizzard and pork belly skewers. -The shishito peppers were not spicy (yay!) -The chicken gizzards were grilled to perfection! They weren't hard at all. I loved the texture of it. We ordered another chicken gizzard skewers afterwards because 1 skewer wasn't enough!-The chicken thighs were tender and flavorful, it was pretty good.-The chicken and leek was good but nothing special about it I find.-The Japanese sausage was a big round sausage (looked like crab cake). I don't know what it contains because everything was chopped and all mixed-up. It was good but not ""wow wow"".-The pork belly was very fat this time. Despite looking all fat, the pork belly's fat wasn't disgusting, it was actually quite chewy! I hate when the fat ""oil"" explodes inside your mouth or when the texture of it is soft and tender... If I had to eat the fat, I prefer when the texture is ""chewy"" and not soft..-The bacon wrapped asparagus is pretty much self-explanatory. The karaage from Ichigo came with wasabi-mayonnaise sauce on the side. The chicken were crispyly fried but not too dry. But I prefer Yokato Yokabai's karaage because theirs is juicier and less dry since they added a yuzu-lemon ish sauce on top of the chickens. Yokato's gobo came with a homemade mayonnaise sauce but at Ichigo Ichie, you only have 3 choices of seasoning: spicy, corn chowder or barbecue. Our waitress told us the spicy seasoning is like Yokato's gobo, so we picked that one. It is not spicy at all (trust me, I can't eat spicy). Ichigo's gobo just doesn't have the mayonnaise sauce, but it was still very good! Actually, you can eat it without the sauce and it is still delicious.The Yarai style grilled squid was my mom's favorite dish. I remember it had a strong charcoal taste which made the squid really tasty. The tentacles were my favorite parts because they were a little bit crispy but not burnt!  One thing that I find it weird was the ice cream. My godparents ordered ice cream and this time, it came with a waffle cookie (which tasted like fortune cookies). The last time we ordered, we didn't get the waffle cookie nor the pocky sticks... Normally, Yokato's ice cream comes with pocky sticks and Ichigo's comes with the waffle cookie... How come last time, we got nothing but the ice cream scoop... Our waiter was attentive and constantly filling up our cups with tea. He also emptied our plates very quickly too. Sometimes, when we had a few pieces left on the plate, he would ask us if we were done, which I didn't like because it felt like he was rushing us to finish our dishes..."

Originally I came in for the ramen shop but I was in the mood for a little drink so came here instead. I got the Pork Belly skewers and Kaarage (fried chicken) and a pint of Sapporo. The food took a while to come out because of some issues with the kitchen so they gave me a couple drinks on the house. Personally I didn't think the wait was that long but hey I'm not one to turn down free stuff :). The food itself was plentiful for its price and delicious. The staff are very attentive and friendly. The ambience is very nice for a small pub. I can honestly say this was the best experience I have ever had in any restaurant/bar and will definitely stop by for a drink or two whenever I'm in Montreal.

Unfortunately,the few times we tried to get in this winter the line - up was way to long. Last night,however, was the perfect opportunity and we were seated immediately in a new section of the restaurant called Ichigo Ichi. So good news for all the yelpers like me who hate long lines. Now is  your chance to try this combination Ramen house and Izakaya as they have plenty of seating. Even better there is now a cool bar serving up very nice drinks where you can sample the best of the Ramen options and order off of the menu from the new Izakaya. I complement the design and the decor of this entire restaurant. It is authentic and at the same time has a cool industrial look that's akin to one of the high-tech sets that you might find on one of the food channels. I think they went all out on their kitchen which you can see as you are served in the Izakaya part. It's simply great.As for the food, the Ramen lived up to all of the great reviews. It was absolutely delicious and totally authentic. The noodles were of the highest quality and the savory and creamy broth was exceptional. Clearly the Ramen bowls here are made with a lot of care and love. The Izakaya items that we ordered were beautifully presented and had everything you would expect of the tastes of real Japanese cuisine.The avocado and salmon salad tartare was just plain yummy and really pleasing as it was served on a glass block. It also contained some of the  tastiest and crispiest Japanese rice chips that I've ever had. We also consumed a smoked salmon salad ,artfully presented with a great variety of lettuces and veggies on the plate, as well as scrumptious chunks of  in-house on demand smoked salmon. The fried chicken Kara-age was right on the money and should be entered in a championship competition.We went easy on the Japanese tapas so there was room for dessert. We chose a green tea tiramisu and a play on ice cream and waffles utilizing mochi and green tea ice cream. Both were satisfying, unusual and pleasing to the eye which is a good thing when one opts for dessert.Hands-down this is the best Japanese place in Montreal.  Its affordable, cool and hip. The staff were really friendly and they try very hard to please. New York has Ippuddo and quite a few other Japanese greats and I'm happy to say now Montreal has this place. I hope you yelpers out there will be kind enough not to storm this place after this and the many other great reviews as I'm hoping there will be a place for me when I return sometime very soon."

We went with a group of six so that we were able to order a good variety and enjoyed more options. They also have quite a large selection of sake. In the end we all got pretty drunk but had such a great time. Supposedly they are a complex of three sections - this one for tapas, another for ramen, and a bar. Look forward to try the others next time!"

/user_details?userid=Ui6IqXD_cvB6VBQK96ZKMA,Amy D.,"Louisville, KY",4 star rating,"My fiancé and I are both suffering from colds and wanted some comfort food--what better comfort food than ramen? We both ordered the pork with Kara-miso (their spicy broth) and added a whole egg. Service was fast and friendly, and the ramen was delicious! It had a rich, thick broth, and the pork was so tender it melted in your mouth. The spicy broth had a good heat, but wasn't overwhelming. They also brought out some add-ins for the ramen: hot oil, garlic oil, and sesame seeds. We both ordered cocktails which were okay, but not very memorable. Definitely worth a visit for the ramen!"
/user_details?userid=5gj1dhFLlkgSJj4Jts-rqg,Marco R.,"Washington, DC",1 star rating,"A scam. An absolute scam. We live in New York, and good food can be expensive, even for izakayas. But this was an absolute scam. The seared tuna was meh and was basically a tasting. Tempura mediocre. And on top of it, the waitress was implying it was our fault that we had so little food, because we didn't let her help us with the order. Never again."
/user_details?userid=IzuP-7SD1qGatQm__nbnWQ,CJ L.,"South Pasadena, CA",1 star rating,"My wife and I were in Montreal for a week.  We were here on a Friday night, and we knew it would be busier.  Well, when we arrived, there was a group of 4 in front of us.  But I noticed a place for 2 at the bar.  Without an attendant or host, we went to sit at the bar thinking it was open seating.  We sat there for a few minutes until someone said we couldn't sit there and had to wait in line.  Well, we went back in line.  After 15 minutes, the group of four was seated.  Then, once they were seated, we took the same two seats at the bar.  I feel like this was unusual, but maybe it was a Montreal-type quirk.We ordered a pair of beers and some food.  The food itself was okay.  It was smaller portion than what I expected considering the price.I wouldn't recommend this place, especially if you have had Izakaya somewhere else.  This is really is not an Izakaya in my mind."
/user_details?userid=YdcZFLyX-PyjCiW3KMy2tQ,Pii K.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"After a quick Wikipedia search, the phrase ichigo ichie, which means ""never again"" or ""one chance in a lifetime"", perfectly describes my experience at this restaurant. We came here instead of the mediocre ramen place next door because there was a long line (temporary lapse of judgement). Once we got seated, we were left alone for 15 minutes by our server while there were only 3 occupied tables in the dining room. Although After the food arrived at our table quite fast after we placed our order, the bill took another 15 min. The dishes were ok but pricey: the beef nigiri was good (although the dressing tasted like instant noodle flavour mix), but at 2 PIECES of sushi for $8! Negima (chicken and leek) and karaage were very flavourful but both were too heavy on the seasoning.The entire dining experience took less than 50 minutes, which was quick for something that costed ~$50/person. Also the atmosphere didn't feel like an izakaya, the cooks just did their own things quietly while servers were constantly on their iPads."
/user_details?userid=YMLSg6HwJPZ6hqpUHic7DA,Bram P.,"Miami, FL",5 star rating,"Incredible place. It has everything. The vibe, decor, food, drinks and service. I had the Sake Sangria which was amazing. Sweet but not too sweet. The Sake bloody mary was also great. Aki the manager was really friendly and by the end of the night was having shots with us. Mike our server was attentive and knowledgeable. The seared tuna was amongst the best I have had. The green tea pudding and sake ice cream was also a treat. All around 5 stars."
/user_details?userid=EVLjWwkF3y9wEi3KoOCKPA,Megan S.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Ended up at Ichigo Ichie after we were told that there would be a delay for ramen at Yokato Yokabai, however we were not at all disappointed! The atmosphere was low key, the staff were friendly and the food was fantastic. Our server was very helpful with menu recommendations, one of which was the deep fried octopus balls - my favourite dish of the evening. Will definitely be returning to try out the other items on the menu!"
