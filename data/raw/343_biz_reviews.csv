The chicken was well seasoned, juicy and the outside was crunchy. However, it was a bit too salty after a 2-3 pieces. The coleslaw was creamy and delicious. The wait time was amazingly short. Got my order very quickly even though there was a lineup."

The coleslaw is very good. The gravy is tasteless, really not worth it. The sauces are 1$ each.. a bit pricey to me. Overall, service need to improve bc they dont really listen your order from my personal experience , and there's a big lack of flavor for the gravy, literally taste like hot water."

I mostly knew them for their killer fried chicken in Chinatown, and the tantalizing smell that fills that area throughout the day. So seeing this new spot around Concordia was really exciting!The interior was shiny and clean, with soft yellows and a quirky giraffe (?) patterned-counter. We tried the fried chicken sandwiches (classic spicy and deluxe) and the Chick'n Sweet (fried chicken and waffles). It was a really busy understaffed day, but they really made the efforts to make the food in a reasonable time. The food was hot and the chicken freshly fried. The sandwiches were good, but could have used a bit more sauce. The buns were particularly soft and good. The chicken and waffles were also pretty good, and I liked the use of real maple syrup. I think I personally still prefer the good old fried chicken by itself, but these are definitely popular options. A great addition to the neighbourhood!"

The spices give a really nice taste. Prepare yourself to wait for some time if you order the chicken waffle. The lemonade is great and quite refreshing!
