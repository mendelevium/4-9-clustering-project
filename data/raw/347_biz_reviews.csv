/user_details?userid=-r16-IkjlJzzW3gMvStU0A,Beatrice T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I'll say it once, I'll say it twice, and I'll say it again: Jumak is the best. We went back after a long hiatus (too long) and once again they remind us of just how amazing they are at what they do. This lovely couple still serves one of the absolutely best Korean food anywhere in Montreal and it's especially because of their flavors that pack a punch and are unlike any other Korean places out there. We hope Jumak continues to thrive even during these hard times and it always warms my heart to see others flock to this magical place and see how happy they are picking up their delicious smelling packets home to enjoy. Amazing food, service, prices. 10/5 stars"
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I have been here twice. It's a family owned small restaurant. The service was very warm. The waitress was always smiling. The food is good. I had a rice in stone bowl. I like the veggie combination here. They are not boring and with some surprise. I also had a kimichi soup once. I liked it very much. Will stop by when I am in the area.
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"*3.5 rating*After reading all the hype about this place I was really eager to try it out. It's a little restaurant with about 10 tables. We were greeted with tea, seaweed, green beans and kimchi. For the main course, being a huge bibimbap fan, I ordered the beef bibimbap along with the beef Cupbap. Bibimbap is a very popular Korean dish served with rice, vegetables and an egg in a hot stone bowl. The beef Cupbap was served with sweet potato noodles & rice and heavily dressed with a sauce. Of the two, the bibimbap was definitely a better choice. Both dishes can have more meat especially the Cupbap which hardly had any meat.  I have had much better Korean meals and would say this one was decent."
/user_details?userid=Mt-_SvJyDirR9fpZx9dbEw,Tommy S.,"Bellevue, WA",5 star rating,"We came here on a Friday night at around 7:30pm and were warmly greeted by who I assume to be the wife of this small mom and pop shop. The menu takes the shape of an Asian hanging scroll. I ordered ""Sun dubu jjigae"" (spicy tofu soup) but I opted for the version with curry. It was so flavourful and delicious. We also ordered ""Jjam Bbong"" (spicy noodle soup) and that also knocked our socks off. Although it's a very small restaurant, you can see how much effort the husband and wife put into ensuring that their clients enjoy their meal: service is efficient and friendly despite the skeleton staff, and the food packs a punch and sticks to the ribs. All things considered, I would recommend you try this place at least once."
/user_details?userid=42tCZY6aLgYJJGp96rHK_A,Sandy D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Cozy little restaurant, the taste was fine.I tried the bimbibap beef and kim chi, nice combination of veggie plus an  egg.Staff is friendly. Not one of the best Korean place, but pretty ok if you are around the area and want to have Korean food."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Like korean restaurants, their menu consists of the regular korean dishes for a reasonnable price, such as bibimbap, fried chicken, etc. I tried the spicy chicken Cup bap which had chicken, japchae, rice and salad. It's was pretty good but wasn't really spicy. The side dishes were ok, but the kimchi was saltier than expected. The place itself is clean and cozy. The waiter was nice and friendly. Overall, I don't have much to say about this restaurant. It was good but not good enough for me to go back."
/user_details?userid=llYPhmerOxf43oVLYdVdyw,Josie L.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"Love love love this place! When my friend and I got inside this really small restaurant, we no expectations what's so ever. We ordered my favorite Korean sweet potato noodles with some fried chicken and a soup with a massive beef bone in it (That was impressive! Very tasty!!! ).The fried chicken was so good! They serve it with fries. Careful, it's addictive! If my friend wasn't there, I would've eaten it all by myself! This place can maybe seat 20 people max. It's really cozy and the staff was really fast on the service. I'm definitely going back to try some other things!"
/user_details?userid=tCM0MJ5yV6CWciWIdGaj8w,Ivan K.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've come here many times over the last couple months. Their menu isn't extremely long compared to some other Korean restaurants, but everything I've tried so far has been delicious. They have some of the tastiest takoyaki I've tried in Montreal and their kimchi pancake is delicious. They are also one of the few places in Montreal that offer Cupbap. I got to try their friend chicken during my most recent visit and I really liked it; it was very juicy. Their fries are also a little sweet, if you're into that. I highly recommend this place for some down-to-earth Korean food. The only minus I've found so far is that they don't accept credit card, only cash and debit."
/user_details?userid=o_IEnOVNuir0QNVkANzyXQ,Esteban Y.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I just love this Korean place, better than the ones downtown. Food is absolutely delicious. I have been here twice and want to go back to try the rest of the menu. I love their papyrus menu hehehe. It is a small place, but the couple of times I have been there, it is not packed, so you will find easily a table."
/user_details?userid=y-mwVNTsWOFxRsdcvdGVlA,Marc M.,"Sainte-Thérèse, Canada",3 star rating,I have mixed feelings on this place for my first visit. I reserved for 5 without knowing how big this place is. We turned out to be six sitting at a table for 4. Kinda tight. My girl and I enjoy discovering foods. We loved the octopus balls. Dumplings were a little too crunchy. I'm used to steamed. I had the bibim something. Quite tasty but I screwed up and drank my miso instead of pouring it in. My bad. I gotta try it again. My friend had a large soup. She really enjoyed it especially with her cold. The others had mixed feelings especially with a really late plate. They enjoyed themselves because of the company but indifferent about the food. One had pork chops which looked like Shaken Bake. I think she should have ordered better. Bring cash or debit No CC. 4 people tops. Order the specialties. Don't be rushed Repeat!
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"I was so happy to get to go visit Jumak. I'd been curious about the reviews I'd seen coming in on Yelp and waiting for an opportunity. I have a bestie who lived in Korea for a couple years and I owed her a favour so I took her out for a dinner date on Queen Mary. When we got there we made friends with Jo who is co-owner and runs front of house. She was excited and proud of the food and rattled off her favourite suggestions and my friend's eyes lit up. We ordered a vegetarian pajeon, eggplant dumplings, a spicy noodle soup and the pork rice cup. Everything was honestly exceptional.The eggplant dumplings were a delicate surprise- they were thin pieces of eggplant rolled around creamy crab meat and fried - lovely. The pajeon was surprisingly light and not greasy and I could have eaten that spicy noodle soup forever. This is a Mom and Pop shop run by a young cool couple who are working their butts off to provide really high quality Korean food, exceptional warm kind service, at fair prices. They are doing a great job, go give them some love!!"
/user_details?userid=DxqxvSnjW-DLBXR-k_6OdQ,James L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,One of our favorite meals while staying in NDG.  Comfort Korean style with fried chicken and the beef udon stir fried noodles. Friendly and accommodating service.
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Korean is my go to comfort food so I'm always up for trying Korean! The resto is small seats about 24 at full capacity. The walls are decorated with asian fans and pics of food.  We got a table at the front window and ordered on their scroll menus. Btw, it's a cash and debit place.  We ordered the seafood pancake, a bulgogi beef cup bap and a soup and noodle with beef.  The seafood pancake had shredded sweet potato, lots of onions, some zucchini and a little hint of chili peppers. It's very light in texture. The taste was great as a veggie pancake but there were only microscopic amounts of seafood. I found a tiny shrimp and a shred of squid. I would've liked more seafood. The bulgogi cup bap was good, reminds me of the vegetarian rice bowls with dressing but with meat.  One thing I noticed was that they don't use Korean styled rice completely. It looks like the rice is a blend of the short grain rice with long grain white.  This changes the flavor a bit. I prefer my short grain rice straight :)  The banchan was delicately flavored with shredded daikon, kimchi and seaweed sheets.  The daikon was really good so I got seconds.The price is very reasonable so if you're in the neighborhood and looking for modern Korean and fast service, this is the place."

/user_details?userid=52p2iAxobpwrBAYBtBmWHg,Jane C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My current #1 place for korean food in Mtl!Amazing food, very nice owners, very cozy and laid back place!The kind of place you end up when its cold outside and you need some warm comfort food! It's 9am on a sunday and I would totally eat the Pajeon from Jumak even if I'm not even finished with my 1st cup of tea.Will go back. For sure."
/user_details?userid=HVGfPIZ-w4f0_CfejUGhxg,Joyce N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"When I first entered the restaurant I was amazed by the warmth and intimacy of the place, especially when located on such a live street like Queen Mary. For appetizers, we had eggplant dumplings and the very famous seafood pancake. For mains, we decided to go with the pork and vegetable rice bowls. Needless to mention all of them were delicious, though a bit too oily. Also, the waitress was super nice and patient. Would definitely recommend!"
/user_details?userid=qnZkCGvLz6AB5cQN_J_pUA,Jack D.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",4 star rating,"There is something about the way streets and sidewalks are set up in some parts of Montreal that make it difficult for the usual passer-by to notice certain storefronts. Perhaps it is because people have their heads down or looking straight ahead, trying to get from point a to point b. Sadly, this means that some really quality spots get totally overlooked, and I would have to say Jumak is one of those places. This place has been around for roughly 8 months, and it's only really because of Yelp (haaaaay!) that Jumak fell on my radar. And finally, my partner and I had a little free time during lunch (and some errands to run nearby) and decided to give it a try. Now I grew up in Koreatown Los Angeles, arguably the most Korean city in North America. So I have moderate expectations. And I have been let down. Thankfully, Jumak did not disappoint. The restaurant is a cleanly, simply decorated place that seats about 20 people or so. The server was super nice and helpful. And the food was SOLID. We ordered the seafood soon du bu and bulgogi bibimbap. The soon du bu was perfectly spicy with a nice seafood-y twang. The bibimbap was clean, had a great portion of meat (sometimes places only have a little bit of meat). Both we delicious and hot devoured. This place deserves more popularity. Maybe a more eye catching sign and/or A-frame on the sidewalk. I hope the summertime brings out the outdoor tables and sidewalk curiosity. Can't wait to come back!"

Authentic Korean cuisine offering all the dishes you crave with cool music.The chef /owner and his wife front of house offers gracious service while the chef cooks some of the most flavorful foods. We've been here 3 times trying everything from the delicious miso cod, seafood pancake (huge!) and yummy gizzards to start. Perfect 'dolsot bibim bap' and 'jiam bbong' and oh so good tofu soup 'Sun dubu jjige'."

We were a group of 7.First of all it's a very small restaurant so place is limited and it's pretty busy.The waitress was amazing. She had a smile all the time and very polite despite being very busy which made our experience very appreciative. The food was delicious.Everything we ordered was good.Price is reasonable.Will return for sure.It's a little hidden treasure.Gomabseubnida to the Jumak team!
/user_details?userid=bj2_KPCKpQdNlN8hlHSxdg,Cat D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great Korean food, with a lot of items on the menu, including some I haven't seen in other restaurants in Montreal; I think some of these dishes are on the ""trendier"" side of Korean cuisine, and I welcome the chance to try food I haven't had elsewhere. I first went here on a whim in the dead of winter, the pictures on Yelp making me salivate the whole way up Decarie. First good point: parking is usually easily found either directly in front of the resto, or max, a block away. There is a mix of pay and free parking (free parking is a bit further on some side streets). As mentioned by others, this place is small, and while we didn't have problems getting a table during the cold months, the last two times we went, with good weather, lineups had started. The banchan are great (wish the portions were a bit bigger, but they'll give you more if you ask), with the kimchi having this perfect balance of salty, spicy, sour. They also always give some toasted seaweed coated in sesame oil. This one is my favorite, as the oil really gives it great flavor! We usually get a full order (they have a half size as well) of the fried chicken as a starter- great portion size, these are boneless pieces of chicken on top of a bed of honey coated fries. Again, the honey, while unusual at first taste, became addictive. They also give a mayo-based dipping sauce. For mains, I stick with the bulgogi beef cup bap: a bowl of rice with super tender pieces of marinated beef, sweet potato glass noodles, shredded lettuce, sweet sauce...and I'm probably forgetting some ingredients! When we first went, the owner/ server made sure to tell us multiple times to ""mix well! Keep mixing!"" so as not to end up with plain rice at the end of our meal :) Other winners we've tried are the kimchi beef bulgogi bibimbap, and the spicy chicken cup bap. One caveat: most of the dishes I've tried and enjoyed, lean toward the sweet side due to the sauces used. So for those that prefer salty and savory only, go for other items rather than the cup bap selection. There's much to choose from! And if you wish to wash your food down with an alcoholic beverage, they do have a small menu of beer, wine, etc. We usually stick to the hot glass of tea the owner brings as soon as we sit down. Service is attentive and friendly. Portions are generous. Prices decent. What more can you want?"

The host was very welcoming and very interactive and made sure we were doing okay and that everything was up to standard. The food was really good, we had the cupbap and udon noodles, as well as takoyaki and dumplings and it was very delicious. We also enjoyed the little appetizers they gave in the beginning. Overall one of the best service ive received at any restaurant"
/user_details?userid=3aKBF6QsI0IXl3hUNqeHLw,Jean-Philippe F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I wanted to try Jumak for quite some time and I'm not disappointed. The place can allow about 20 people. The menu is presented with a scroll, nice way to display a menu.There were no one when I arrived. I've ordered a seafood pancake (haemul pajeon), a pork bone soup (gamja tang) and a spicy tofu and seafood soup. All were delicious. Overall I'm satisfied with this Korean restaurant. The only thing that you need to be aware is that they don't accept credit card."
/user_details?userid=Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I am so mad at myself for not taking pictures, but I was starving when I arrived and had left ordering to my sister and friend. We shared a number of items including the lunch special bulgogi, fried chicken with sweet french fries (really like a honey glaze), sun dubu jjigae, donkatsu kimbap, and haemul pajeon. Then we also shared one coconut hotteok and one brown sugar hotteok.The pajeon (seafood pancake) is out of this world good, the sun dubu is one of my all time favorites though. I also really liked the fried chicken, sweet fries, and coconut hotteok. The other items were really good too, those were just my personal favorites. Banchan was simple: seaweed slices, grated daikon, and some stellar home-made kimchi. I'll be back as soon as possible, this is going to be my new go-to restaurant for soul-warming Korean food.*If you want to see some more examples of their food, their FB page has a bunch.*"

Tried the cod entree, perfectly cooked fish and really tasty sauce. For mains, had the bibimbap, the udon and the pork tonkatsu. Everything was delicious, the tonkatsu was extraordinary.

They serve authentic korean food and aren't  afraid to explain what's  in dishes. The food is seasoned perfectly and I could taste everything rather it being overwhelmed with seasoning like some other places I've  been. It is super afforable and really great atmosphere. They also have this amazing lunch special for korean bbq from 12 - 2:30. I absolutely have to come back and try it!  I came for the beef and kimchi dolsot bimbim bap and the hotteok. The hotteok is a must try! Absolutely delicious withot being overwhelmingly sweet. Their kimchi was delicious and most of their dishes are made with a hand made house sauses. Because it is homemade there is a comfort in the food. Seriously, this is now going to be one of my favourite local korean food places to go to. The staff is very friendly and attentive. You will honestly not be disappointed."

It's that good!For a small, reasonably priced spot, Jumak really delivers on taste & quality. You are served immediately with the regular appetizers, and their homemade kimchi is outstanding. It's based on their family recipe, and it's the perfect balance of salty and spicy. Very refreshing! My favourite dish is usually dolsot bibimbap, but this time I had a spicy pork dish called cup bap.It's so worth the visit, I highly recommend you try it out!#korean #koreanrestaurant #kimchi #spicyfood #foodgasmbmwired"
