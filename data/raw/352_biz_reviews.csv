We were greated and seated immediately. Cute second floor terrace for a 5@7. It's a good spot for small groups or duos. As the name says, food is mostly snacks and small entrees. We shared oysters (very fresh, served with lemon slices and special hot sauce) as well as the Terre plate to share (3 different breads, olives, sweet potato and red pepper dip, 2 different cold cuts and pork rillette). The wine pairing suggested was great (organic white wine). It's a little bit on the pricey side but it's worth it once in a while. ."

Lots of outdoor seating available and had a nice relaxed atmosphere. The service was fast and efficient and the prices were not bad. We ordered beer and fries , a simple order but both were just what we wanted. Ice cold refreshing beer and nice crispy very well seasoned fries made fresh with a side of herb mayo for dipping, this really hit the spot! They don't have a huge menu but they have a few different things you can order like a burger or poutine or salads , wings etc... and they have a variety of beers and cocktails (as well as pitchers of white or red sangria -perfect for summer).This is a nice choice for a casual lunch or drink."
