I didn't get a chance to check it out when they opened in August but their patio and their dining area looks super cute - very aesthetic with lots of plants. We got takeout for their tasting menu for two (La Taquisa) so we could try a variety of items from their menu. It came with two Azteca soups, their Kaizen nachos, hot and spicy jackfruit tacos (3), adobo tacos (3), and a brownie. The Azteca soup was unbelievable. So flavourful and especially enjoyable during these colder days. It came with tofu that, I kid you not, looked and felt like pork belly. We were amazed at the fact that it wasn't real pork belly. The Kaizen nachos were interesting: dumplings with three different sauces. The tacos came in an ""assembly kit"" which is great so you can add as little or as much topping/sauce as you want and your tortilla isn't soggy and falling apart by the time you eat it. I personally enjoyed the hot and spicy jackfruit more than the adobo but they were both super flavourful. I will for sure be going back to try their different tacos as there's 7 on their menu and they all sound very appetizing! It was hard to just pick two for their tasting menu. The portions are very generous, in my opinion. We saved some of the taco fillings for the next day, which reheated quite nicely as everything was packed separately. I am not vegan and I thoroughly enjoyed the meal so I would highly recommend to anyone because the food is packed with so much flavour!"

Fushion style food can be a little tricky, but Casa Kaizen seamlessly delivers delicious Mexican-Japanese fushion and best of all - it's vegan! The tasting menu (I believe it's called ""The Engagement"") is delicious and their cocktails are fantastic, using unique ingredients. Overall, a memorable and enjoyable experience. We will be back!"

Me and my friends, we thoroughly enjoyed our meal here. We were super impressed and pleased by the vegan food. Skeptical at first, but once you bite into that fried 《chicken》, it'll have you say O.M.G. WHAT!! My top 3 of the night were : fried chicken, tofu jalapenos and the gyozas. I would definitely come back with a meat loving friend to have their opinion on this. Overall, it was a very tasty and it opened my mind about vegan food and tbe possibilities.Note : the cocktails were ok. Not super good but not undrinkable. If you're not a drinker, they have flavoured water."

Everything was delicious, from the shiitake based fried chicken to the nori Infladita and the desert. They even have a soy-based salmon nigiri dish that's very interesting and beautifully plated.Just go try everything ok the menu, you'll find your favorites pretty fast.My personal favorite was not on the menu, it was the desert which was a sweet tamale that can pair perfectly with a cafecita."
