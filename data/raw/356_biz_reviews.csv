I love the unique flavor combo's, platting and use of techniques and I wasnt sure how they would be able to replicate this as a takeout menu. Le menu's they have created are extradordinary and with just a little of preparation at home deliver just as good a meal as being in their restaurant.The only thing missing is their ambiance and service.The thanksgiving menu:-milk bread, very generous portion of 6 buns--chicken liver moussegreen salad with curry mustard dressing - most inventive vinagrette I've had in a while!-charcoal brocolli with fennel-squash salad-cornbread with whipped honey butter mixture-Dauphinois patatoes with incredible creamy fine herb sauce- one of our favorite dishes!-tuna and daikon shaped as a rose with a soy dipping sauce - beautiful!-poultry ballotine with a supreme sauce  -one dessert: chou pastry filled with cream and blueberries,The 28 day menu:-Tuna burger , so delicious!-tomato and sweet habanero salad-chips2 desserts: white chocolate pudding and a canneleHighly recommend ordering from Le Mousso !!"
/user_details?userid=CdjhLoudvFZ2VfVIvGxL3g,Yun C.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"A great tasting meal at Michelin quality! It is seafood heavy and definitely hit the spot for me! Price is very reasonable for this quality! 150/person (Canadian dollars!)Le Mousso is innovative, a depth of flavors and well balanced!I was so ready to write this place off because the reservation process was slightly irritating. I booked this about a month in advance and had to call to make the reservation. The staff was polite but be aware they will easily try to push you to their sister restaurant next door which is a la carte and not a tasting menu. I had to repeat multiple times that I want to eat at Le Mousso and not something else! We were kinda put off by this and almost wanted to cancel but luckily we did not!The food was amazing!This meal is 90% seafood but even the vegetables and meat (we had duck) were cooked and flavored perfectly! THIS is what I imagined Noma 2.0 seafood season would be but got extremely disappointed at Noma's one note flavor profile! Le Mousso does what Noma was unable to do with their seafood meal! They enhance each seafood instead of overpowering it with weird ingredients that sounds nice but taste horrible! My favorite were the grilled lobster on a stick! It had the perfect smoky flavor and the sauce balanced the lobster well. The most memorable was the tuna in raspberry shoyu sauce which was super refreshing!The uni, caviar and hazelnut was very unique and worked well especially with the endive!The peas 3 ways with saffron chip and egg yolk was amazing, fun and crazy appetizing! The bread with aged whipped butter was so good! Crunching outside, tender and soft inside and hot - how bread should be served! It came with a rose water whip to clean your hands after.The cod was perfectly cooked and so tender!The trout was probably my least favorite but still cooked well but slightly more salty than I would like. I thought the seafood would be the highlight but they seem to also really impressed me with the duck and mushroom! The mushrooms were cooked to a crunchy yet tender texture which I have never encounter before. The duck was seasoned well and was so good! The deserts were a good finish but I was so blown away by the seafood and duck, I thought the desserts were overshadowed. Another plus is that they offer half pour wine pairing which is great for the Asian glow people like us. It's 55/person for 1 oz pour instead of 85/person for 2 oz pour. I felt she was pretty generous with the pour - I almost couldn't finish all the alcohol! FYI for parent, they allow kids (my girl was two) but will be very persistent in trying to convince you to go to their sister restaurant instead. Make sure to call and let them know if you are bring your child. No high chair. The environment is upscale yet relaxing with moderate dance music to cover any minor unwanted noises .Must try if you plan to come to Montreal!"

One of the more well cooked balance seafood tasting menu I've had. Few options for wine pairing $55 for an ounce or $80 for 2oz. The dishes, only highlighting the ones I admireShrimp gazpacho so clean to start the meal of and setting that seafood taste for the rest of dinner. Of course you had to follow with a little veggie in the way of grilled, blanched and raw peas combine giving you the char the crunch and the cooked taste.Lobster on a stick not much else to say right?!?!?! and what do they do with the better half of the lobster? Of course they purée the guts and make a broth with chunks of claws. Tuna with raspberries was an added dish. Beautiful presentation dark red and the contrast of the raspberry to show the tuna. Little soy and slice thin to perfection. Duck was fantastic tender and the combination of the mushroom. Every bite you get that awesome smoke and not dry. Wine pairing worth it, I think the $55 is not bad couple wines are pretty good. I'm not a wine connoisseur. So that's for someone to find out and tell us. If I'm ever back in Montreal, I know where I'll be dining. Until next time. repas délicieux"
/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",3 star rating,"3* is given because of the price is way to pricey for what you get.This restaurant has been on my to go list for the longest time. I remember that when they opened a few years ago, their tasting menu was something like $65 or so. Now you need to pay $140/ person + $80 for wine pairing.Went there to celebrate my birthday and had high expectations. First 3 items on the menu (amuse bouche) was SOOOO good that I was really excited about the next dishes to come. Basically, my excitement stopped at the amuse bouche. Got served a scallop fish with some broth. They had cut a whole scallop into 4 slices and have us each 2 slices. Scallop was fresh so can't taste bad...there was nothing special to the broth except that it tasted very butter heavy.I can go on and on about the other dishes...really nothing special to them besides the fact that they are tiny. They are really one biters!And the wine...not even half a glass if given per pairing.Desserts were good...I guess the meal started and ended on a good note but nothing in between was worth mentioning.The worse is that they served bread and butter as part of one of the tasting menu dish! They are homemade but come on..:lots of restaurants serve in house baked bread with butter for FREE!!!Don't get me wrong...I'm not saying the food wasn't good. It was decent good but when you charge $140/person, you really expect it to blow your mind.Total for the night for 2 with wine pairing, taxes & tips included came down to ~$600.If money is no object and you want to give it a try, go ahead but if you simply want good food, then skip this place. Might be worth it for $70/person + $40 wine pairing but not more than that!I have been to much better restaurants and for a fraction of the cost."

Everything was good but I especialy like the the Bettrave et gras de boeuf, the smoke and grill lobster humm so good. A gem to discover. The Morue et chou fermentė the combination just perfect. One of the 2 dessert Miel Sarrasin was a big surprise. Le Mousso as an Urban style but its very simple. I think they can do a little bit better for the deco... For the rest im satisfied.

/user_details?userid=yIFyaNq4oCLoYkY1Gi0XAw,Corey D.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,"This is by far the best meal and dining experience that I've ever had in Montreal.  You can only take the tasting menu which changes based on season and availability of the ingredients. You should take the wine pairing, to me it was the best part of the experience, almost to the point where I found the wine surpassed the food.  The dessert which was ice shavings made from raspberry kombucha with bits of caramel. It was the perfect combination of sweet and fresh. By far one of the best desserts I've had.  Please don't hesitate to come here and encourage this restaurant. It is on the pricey side but you won't regret it. In the contrary you'll be raving about how good it was."
/user_details?userid=NDpDbLel51kGekwWhdhb9Q,Natasha R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Just went here last night w my husband. Its a set menu with 13 courses at $150 (no a la carte options) w $85 wine pairing , which we opted for. So all in this has been our most expensive dinner in a decade (the only meal more expensive was Abac in Barcelona in 2010 - 3 star michelin): $650 for 2. Was it worth it? No. Why? Lack of diverse flavours in food and poor wine pairings. What we ate: 1)Foie gras cotton candy (fun, a highlight), 2)Amuse  bouches which were not memorable, 3) Sea urchin with caviar & chestnut & chestnut chips, sounds interesting but tasted dull, *note: I hate sea urchin so my take on it is likely biased*4) 3 month aged beef -- a highlight as it had flavour5)lobsters bbq on stick 6)homemade bread & butter7) lobster (again) with tarragon 8) trout, lightly grilled on chive-ish sauce9) cod, also grilled - a highlight 10) duck slices with mushrooms 11) dessert 1-rose sorbet and homemade white chocolate ice-cream12) another dessert I can't recall13) petit foursWines--2 sparkling, all others high acidity whites & 1 pinot from alsace. All the wines were ok but pretty similar probably cause most of the dishes were similarly flavoured. I wanted more range & I prefer red wines so the pairings were a bust for me. Plus there were no veggies (if you didn't count the sauces) which is disappointing to me as it's nice to break up the meat with something lighter. The positives: great service & gorgeous presentation of each dish. Other negative: the decor was sparse and cold. Not very welcoming."
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I ended up at Le Petit Mousso by complete fluke since Le Mousso was complete for reservations. (Be warned the original Le Mousso has a horrible reservation system - by voicemail only- they call you back and let you know if you have a spot.) So when the manager called back to let me know there was no space - he recommend the sister site - le Petit Mousso that has been open for a little over 2 weeks. So, I decided to try out the sister site instead.Le petit Mousso is located in the same building as Le Mousso but to the left side. Industrial look, with weird throwback 90s r&b hits playing in the background. Really odd and doesn't really jive with the restaurant ambiance.We were seated quickly and given a menu listing tapas styled dishes similiar to Vin Mon Lapin. We pretty much tried everything on the menu- there was a large presence of seafood. All dishes were good to share for up to 4 people. My favourite was the asapargus and shrimp dishes. The cocktails had weird unappetizing names- but they proved me wrong. One of the cocktails had shitake syrup that was actually a quite nice with gin. The wine selection was a good one.A few other issues came up that I noticed. People from Le Mousso were dining in the sister site. It made no sense really you are at a complete different restaurant and I was told reservations were full at Le Mousso - kind of misleading, no?2) when I tried pouring the wine for myself, some guy popped up and told me not to - and he would take care of it. I get he was trying to be professional but I don't need to be served everytime I fill my glass of wine. This site has a lot of potential - as the food quality was great comparable to the big guys like Joe Beef level, but they need to tweak little things like management and reservations, etc... to really give the full experience.On a happy note, I was able to make reservations for Le Mousso!"

The service was on point, professional and personable. The restaurant didn't really look like one but I say that in a good way. It felt like I was dining in a modern dining room at someone's chic home. I enjoyed this different approach to creating ambiance. And now for the food...all beautifully presented dishes that used different techniques, textures and combinations. The sauces were outstanding and added layers of complexity to each dish. For someone who doesn't like the texture of mushrooms, those were my favourite dishes! I have no idea what they did to them but it was delicious. There was a good balance of vegetables to seafood to meat to gluten and the order/progression of the dishes worked well. While the price of the tasting menu is steep, for a three hour plus dinner it was well worth the food and entertainment for a special occasion."

I know that their reputation is phenomenal and really glad I finally made reso for dinner.The space is modern. The staff is very friendly, enthusiastic and helpful. They seem to be having great fun working which is an amazing thing to see. I could feel their positive vibe (and they should because this is 2 days after their Laurier win)The concept is simple: everyone eats the same thing! I have signaled them in advance about a need for glutenfree friendly and they absolutely took care of my request. Everything that had gluten, they replaced it with something else just as delicious.We took cocktails to start: The mushroom miso & the parsley basil, both made with gin. WOW! I especially loved the charred mushroom slices atop the drink.The food was frigging amazing! Great flavor balance in every bite. Almost everything was fish & seafood except for the chicken and beef. Very well executed in terms of herbs & spices. Some surprising matching as well like the cucumber & white chocolate ganache dessert: whaaaattttt!!!!! Wow wow wow!We also took the wine pairing service and everything was on point (i would suggest taking the half size if you are here mid-week lol!!!)I would definitely come back and highly recommend this restaurant. Treat yo self!"
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I was so excited to read online that Mousso opened a bar next door to its current location. I came here with my cousin and a friend. One is vegetarian and the other is on the Keto diet. That being said they still managed to find something to eat so that says something! It's pricy so we each ordered two-three plates and my cousin and friend left hungry. I, on the other hand, ordered two plates and shared one with my cousin and felt so full because the two dishes I ordered came with tons of bread and I ate all of it.The location was a bit confusing because it wasn't indicated very well which part of the establishment was Mousso and which part was Petit Mousso. We asked for Petit and they brought us to a room on the left which I immediately recognized from having been there once. Turns out what used to be Mousso is now Petit Mousso. So basically Petit Mousso is the room on the left and Mousso is the room on the right behind a curtain. My friend took me to Mousso for my bday and it was just heaven! One of the best bday gifts for sure! If you haven't gone, you need to go! So I was so excited to try Petit Mousso. Mousso only had a tasting menu but Petit allows you to select from a small menu. Both have different menus but are very similar in style. I read online that it was supposed to be fancy bar food but it's not at all. I def think it's more of a resto then a bar. For one thing they only have three signature cocktails and the rest are wine bottles that you can buy. The cocktails did not look appealing on the menu because i didn't recognize any of the alcohol names and there was weird stuff in the cocktails such as tomatoes! I ordered the third cocktail on the list and it was amazing! It had a liquor similar to aperol and it was decorated with pretty purple flowers on top. It was refreshing. Online I read that they offer snacks so in my head I was expecting fancy bar food like gourmet sliders and fries. They did have potatoes with cheese and truffles but for $15 I rather eat meat or fish for that price. I started off with the mousse de foie with elderberries and walnuts on top. It came with four big slices of bread and it was my favorite thing! So delicious! The perfect balance between sweet and salty! If you like foie gras definitely get this!  I tried my cousin's doré (walleye) crudo and it was good! Light and lemony! The pieces of fish were so small. My friend had the cold soup with veggies inside (not a gaspacho). She said this was her favourite dish of the night. Secondly I ordered the raw lamb with tomatoes and onions. This dish also came with bread. My cousin said it tasted like tomato paste.  I enjoyed it but it was definitely not a must have. My cousin then had the pea with sturgeon and this was better than lamb dish. Lastly we shared the beef short rib that is cooked for three days with their homemade ranch sauce and on a bed of greens. The beef was so good. It perhaps a tad too salty  but I try not to add that much salt in my food at home. I loved the ranch sauce and Chinese celery that came with it. I left feeling full and satisfied but I think it was mostly due to the bread that I was full. The portions are very small so definitely get a few to share. The plating is superbe. The food looks like a work of art! I loved it and I definitely recommend it but honestly I probably would only come back for a special occasion because of the price."
/user_details?userid=wJF-NdtxYCk_SrwG4UUL9Q,Stephanie L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place was absolutely amazing and exceeded our expectations. Came here on a Friday night with my boyfriend and we were absolutely blown away. There is only one choice and it is the tasting menu. Small dishes of the chefs choosing. The plates were so beautiful, we eat with our eyes first! And the taste matched the beauty. We started with beverages I got the Chinatown which tasted amazing and had absinthe in it, my boyfriend had a beer, there was only one choice, red stripe, but that was fine! When our amuse bouche came it was insane. 3 dishes with the theme of charcoal. My personal favourite was the cotton candy with foie gras inside, but all of them were mind-blowing. On one of the dishes we found a fly, we told the waiter, just expecting an apology. But he went above and beyond to correct what was out of his control. The service made the amazing meal even better. The chicken and mushroom dish was to die for. Usually I don't like to eat chicken at restaurants because it can be dry, but it melted in my mouth. The lamb dish was also amazing, so tender and the sauces were divine. We literally wiped each dish clean it was all so amazing. Dessert was also very interesting. I prefer my desserts not to be overly sweet and they delivered. Really unique flavors I would never have thought to combine. All in all, I definitely recommend this place, especially for a special occasion.  Food and service was exceptional."

The atmosphere is industrial chic and laidback (don't arrive too fancy). This is in contrast with the meticulously prepared meals on the tasting menu, which all packed a punch of flavor despite their deceptively small size. We accompanied our meal with their own wine pairings. The selected wines were, I assume, selected for their funkiness (i.e. unfiltered characters). The staff was knowledgeable, but at times seemed flustered and disorganized. Nonetheless, the restaurant is a Montreal gem that perfectly encapsulates the city's vibe."

/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I really enjoyed this place. In my opinion, the price is very reasonable given the food and the overall experience. My group and I ordered the 10 course menu (only baseline option) and some of us also ordered an extra optional course.In terms of actual dishes, among the 11 I received, I found 3 to be outstanding, 2 to be excellent, 3 to be solid, and 1 to be a disappointment. The other 2 courses were tiny bites that were enjoyable but I don't find them to ""move the needle"" in terms of my overall experience.The outstanding dishes were a sea urchin tarte and the two desserts. The tarte was incredible and its sea urchin filling was eye-opening - it embodies several tastes that I associate w/ foie gras but also preserves a uniqueness because, among other things, it is lighter and more colorful. The two dessert dishes were: (1) a buttermilk ice cream with a duo of strawberry coulis and thin pepper meringue (just wonderful) and (2) a camomille (and milk?) popsicle with crumbled bits of maple sugar and frozen foie gras sprinkled on top (a nice refreshing way to finish the meal - the use of maple and foie in the dish exhibited restraint and, consequently, these elements managed to play a deliciously supporting rather than overpowering role in the dish).The excellent and solid dishes had great elements but also incorporated slightly odd components which didn't jive with my pallette. We all have different pallettes so this assessment almost surely would vary from person to person. Regardless, this experience is par for the course at ambitious restaurants that constantly change their menu (even the very best ones). The disappointing dish was a halibut topped with smoked chanterelles that was accompanied with a heirloom onion, brocoli puree (and sauce?), and the leaves of some sort of flower. The most disappointing element of the dish was the fish. I presume it was salt cured and, possibly, rehydrated (though I may be wrong). The end result: it was excessively salty (remark: I usually love salt) and the texture approached that of a paste. Everyone at the table agreed that this was their least preferred dish. Don't take this the wrong way though, one disappointment over the entire N-course meal is perfectly acceptable to me.Beyond the taste experience, I'd like to add that all the dishes were aesthetically beautiful and the service was extremely pleasant and accommodating. I will definitely revisit Le Mousso in the near future."

We were a party of 4 who reserved for 9h30 on a Thursday night. I called last minute to say we would could only make it for 10pm, thinking they would turn us down but instead they said no problem and that they would accommodate us without a problem. We really appreciated this.The place was packed upon arrival. Walking into the restaurant felt like walking into a friend's kitchen. The staff greeted us warmly and our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable. I didn't really have any expectations although I heard good things about the chef's past work and was really hoping for a good experience. The tasting menu was a fixed 7 service meal. Every single plate was a work of art and meticulously put together. I really appreciated how much thought was put into the pairing of ingredients, tastes and textures. Everything was good, and 4 of the plates really impressed me. The mussels and tartar were to die for, and so was the dessert. It was a little pricey with taxes and tip but worth it for the experience. I really enjoyed the fact that you can finally enjoy fine dining in a completely unpretentious setting (the playlist was a good mix of mostly hip hop tracks). Would recommend it and am looking forward to going back."

/user_details?userid=-y8mv6-8C-IJWsy00EWAfA,Jehanne A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"As others have said, this is an expensive place. Probably, one of those places where you go once in your life for something important to celebrate, deciding to pay the money for the experience. You will not come out at less than 100-150$ per person.Having said that, the menu, the quality of the products served, the flavours, the service and the atmosphere are all part of this experience and the experience is (for once) worth the price.It serves a seasonal menu with a set number of services... We had 9! Starting with cotton candy foie gras all the way to the fir tree marshmallows. There are fish plates and meat plates and entrees and dessert... Your stomach will not believe its eyes! Your tastebuds will thank you later!So why only 4 stars? Because some of the plates were not well balanced... The trout and hollandaise was more of a big bulge of hollandaise with a small piece of (delicious) trout (really, there's just so much hollandaise one can eat). Same thing for the celeriac mousse and oysters.And really, because the menu could do without a couple of services. When you have to force yourself to eat the last couple of plates because you're simply not hungry anymore, you're just not enjoying the food as much as it should be, which is a real shame given the goodness that is in front of you."
/user_details?userid=OHTXFa3YQY0cB0nzHgjhRw,Yi T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Where do I start? For one, I am in love with the casual atmosphere of this gastronomic restaurant. The chef walks around with his beanie and talks to customers without pretension, the waiters are down-to-earth, and if you go to the bathroom and pass by the kitchen, it's awesome to see how much the staff is having fun. The surprise menu is an adventure, and some dishes are very audacious (I mean, a dessert with beetroots, chocolate and goat cheese? Who does that?). The menu is cryptic: it only lists the main ingredients but says nothing about how they're cooked or how they'll be used together. Surprisingly, for a gastronomic restaurant, the 11-course meal left us quite full. For the experience we got, the price was very reasonable. I won't spoil the surprise by describing the plates in too much details, but I was pleased to see that there was a strong theme around which the meal revolved. Elements of the forest and nature (pine branches, stones, minerals, grass, wood, shrubbery) were a leitmotiv, masterfully incorporated into a feast for the five senses. The plates often combined many surprising ingredients together. I mentioned the beetroot/chocolate/goat cheese combo, but there was the equally audacious mushroom + maple taffy, and foie gras + cotton candy. Other plates were more tame (such as the harissa and lamb, with a carrot macerated in butter), but quite eclectic in influence. There was a loaf of homemade bread, with its homemade butter, and right before, there had been a duo of perfectly seared scallops in their pearly shells; the rustic standing alongside the fancy. I especially loved the special emphasis on locally-sourced products. The only downside was the seating; we were sitting at a 6-people table with 2 other couples, and we kept getting spoilers from seeing the plates served to the people on our left. The only thing we could do was to completely avoid looking to our left.We'll definitely come again when the menu changes."
/user_details?userid=Rq8m7cL8SG7mYgNvOXq80w,Marine B.,"Paris, France",2 star rating,"We had the worst experience of our holidays at the Mousso - it was so bad that it has been a running joke since then (and yes, I am aware that I seem to be the only Yelper to think so...)First of all, there were really, really a lot of sea products - in the same day, we ate oysters, urchins, clam, fish eggs (and that's not including the actual fishes). Since it is a set surprise menu, it is a bit of a risk if you are not that much of a sea person. Second, most of the dishes ranged from bland (a potato just cooked in hay, with no seasoning whatsoever) to bad (a wayyyy oversalted white fish) to disgusting (stag heart, dried up then grated over a plate). There is a line between inventive cuisine and dishes gone wrong, and the Mousso was on the bad side the night we visited. Desserts were good though - less creative, but way better tasting. Service was friendly, but a little unorganized - we had to wait 20 mn to get our (reserved) table - during which they kindly offered us a drink on the house -, then the time between each plate seemed quite random. Oh, also, the restaurant was way too cold and the music way too loud - but at this point, it was just one more fail to laugh about. If you are looking for a nice restaurant for a special occasion (as we were), try Bouillon Bilk - we loved it! And it costs the same price: ~80 Canadian dollars for the degustation menu, excl. tips and taxes."

I love restaurants with fixed menus because I generally want to try multiple dishes. We took the 11-course tasting menu with wine accompaniment. It was absolutely brilliant. Highlights include the sea urchin pie and the foie gras, maple and chamomile dessert. The atmosphere was relaxed and all is served on  hand-made plates and bowls. The taste of each bite was elevated by the different textures. All in all, it was an edible artistic experience."

Service was top notch!  Wine pairing was well done!  Communal style seating, but don't be shy...everyone is there for good food and good company!You will not be disappointed!"
/user_details?userid=LuCvK2xtrK_gFom-O9spAQ,Richard A.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",3 star rating,Not sure why everyone loves it. We were 4 people and we all didn't like the food. Each plate was interesting to look at but the taste wasn't to our liking. Service was good and menu interesting. We had fun but we wouldn't go back due to the taste.
/user_details?userid=ZaSTfhLHx0ZC4FuwtIkIZA,Leigh W.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"This is one of the best meals, if not the best meal, I've ever had. Twelve of us were visiting Montreal from the States and we couldn't have asked for a better evening or experience. Everything from the food, to the wine pairings, to the cocktails, to the atmosphere, to the service was phenomenal.  One person in our party was allergic to shellfish and I am a pescetarian. They did such an amazing job of swapping out ingredients where we had restrictions to the point where we were excited dish after dish to see what variation they were going to come up with for us, and we never felt like a burden. I would HIGHLY recommend this place for anyone from a date night to a large party. I'm even contemplating coming back to Montreal just to share the experience with my fiancé."

We were greeted with so much warmth and felt comfortable right away. Started with delicious cocktails then the waiter came to start our journey on this exceptional foodie experience! I will try and describe each dish as accurately as possible. It was a menu in collaboration with the Festival Montreal en Lumière. So i took the seven service with wine pairing menu and Felix took the eight service with wine pairing menu and the extra truffles in one of the dishes. Every dish was as mesmerizing as the other. Not one single bad criticism about any. I am, by profession, a pastry chef and usually would have something to criticize about. Nope. Not this time! We were taking on an unforgettable journey! I am a sucker for good service. Ok. This, what we had was exceptional service! I will most definitely come back as soon as I can. The bill totalled up to about 450$ and it was all worth it. A special occasion for a special person in my life at a special restaurant! Look out for Jocelyn. He was our waiter. Attentive, professional, nice and all around very pleasant to talk to! Cute too if I might add!"

To top it all, the staff was witty, funny, welcoming and knowledgeable.Now, on to the main course: the food.We have, for the first time, in years, tasted real talent!We could go on for hours about how everything was so perfectly martched, the flavors so unique, the recipes so so original...and offered with the right wine, but it would be much more interesting for you to try it first hand.Best culinary experience as long as we could remember!"

Reminds me of Luksus NYC but with wine instead of beer pairing.A must try.

Chef Antonin Mousseau is the sun of amazing Quebec poet Michel Rivard, Grandson of  Jean-Paul Mousseau, who painted many Montreal Métro masterpieces. Color and originality show up on the plate.

The menu is a list of seven colors.  And every dish is spectacular. Fresh, well prepared, and so tasty!The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and so much fun.

There is only one menu so take it or leave it but trust me you'll want to take it !! It was delicious, and the wine matches perfectly the different plates. Good to know : on Wednesdays the 7 services meal is $50 only ! But you easily end up paying much more with a few drinks ! Like Arnold Schwarzenegger said : ""I'll be back"" :)"

I just got home from having the same menu the second time and it was even better this time. Go here, easily the best place in Montreal right now. Insanely inventive, crazy well paced and tasty as hell. This is punk rock food at its finest."
/user_details?userid=TNY-H6X1YLWVavD6dEnrEA,Deb M.,"Berkeley, CA",5 star rating,"This was one of the best meals in my entire life, and MADE my trip to Montreal.  I was alone in the city and had caught a cold.  I phoned at noon to ask for a reservation, and they agreed to squeeze me in at 6 PM opening time as long as I left before 8 PM.  I declined alcohol due to my health, and they brought me hot water with lemon.  I was totally catered to - all dishes explained, no rush - just as if I was the most important customer they ever had. Although the prix fixe sounds expensive in Canadian $, it worked out to be reasonable in $US.  The presentation was gorgeous, the tastes delicious, variety charming.  I will certainly return if/when I go again to Montreal."
