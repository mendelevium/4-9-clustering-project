/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We were craving Thai and decided to order it in for dinner. We normally order from Prathet Thai, as it's our favourite & most authentic spot for Thai in Montreal. However we decided to try Thammada, after reading all the reviews online. We ordered Beef Pha Naeng & Chicken Green Curry!  Food came within an hour. Portions, quality of ingredients, authenticity & taste were all 10/10. Both curries came with sides of rice.We will definitely be recommending this spot to our friends, try more items from the menu and dine in someday!"
/user_details?userid=skb_gKS1hn-_5xyRBc3MWA,Takeshi K.,"North York, Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I ordered their Shrimp Pad Thai and Tom Yum Goong for takeout. I also tried their Khao Soi from my friend.The staff was nice and the place was in this hole in the wall kind of place with a nice interior.I love Thai food so I've had a lot and ao I can be a bit harsh. Personally, I'd rate them as 3.5/5.The shrimp pad thai was nice but very oily considering how clumpy the noodles were. But the shrimps were nice and the pad thai was overall pleasant (until the oily-ness got a but overwhelming towards the end). My favourite pad thai place in Canada so far is PAI in Toronto btw.And the Tom Yum Goong was also great but quite salty.I also found both of them to be a bit pricey for what you get. Especially the Tom Yum Goong portions were tiny for $9. And it DEFINITELY was not that spicy (the menu had three chilis on it lol).The Khao Soi was great but the portion felt a bit small. It would be nice if there were more noodles.Overall, I think it'd be a nice place to go on a date or something."
/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Update:After having been here at least 5 times, the food is always on point, service always above and beyond and the atmosphere consistently excellent, I've updated my review to a 5/5!!Original reviewAlmost would have been a perfect 5* if there was a  little more consistency with their prices and portions.We came here after a subpar thai food experience somewhere else the night before. Luckily, after snagging a last-minute reservation, Thammada satisfied our Thai food cravings! We ordered a lot of food for two people! Probably too much to be honestWe shared a papaya salad and a pad see eew and then we each had a khao soi. When we were done, they told us there was one dessert available (mango sticky rice). We didn't ask for the price since we assumed it couldn't be more than $6-7 but it turned out to be $13Pad see ew: 5/5  $16Great portion size, perfect flavour Khao soi 5/5 $17Highlight of this place is that it is one of the only Thai restaurants that serves this dish. Very comparable to the real deal Chiang Mai classic. 5 stars earned just on this dish!! Must tryPapaya salad 5/5 $10Fresh, flavourful, perfect contrast to the heavier flavours in the other dishes. They tried to up sell the fancier version of this salad but this one was perfectMango sticky rice 4/5. (Value 1/5)13$ for a half a mango and a half cup of sticky rice. If I would have known the price ahead of time, I would not have ordered this. Way overpriced!! It was tasty but the portion was tiny. Kind of put a negative spin on an otherwise great meal.Overall, lovely service, great atmosphere and delicious flavours! I'll be back! 4.5/5"
/user_details?userid=d_uSfozaAZR4OpDNa8IiZQ,Dy M.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,This place was so great and good vibes! It was like a well kept secret in Montreal. We came pretty late and there were like 2 to 3 people around. Prices range from $11-$23. It seemed a bit steep but it was really good. Worth every penny! I just wished we got to try the mango sticky rice! I can't wait to come back to try more food!
/user_details?userid=vj-gGhmf8zw4FJiJ4oWGjQ,Beantpreet K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I so wanted to check out this Thai restaurant before the pandemic, but couldn't. I was super happy when they partnered with Uber Eats, Skip the dishes and other delivery services. I have tried their green curry, pad Thai, pad se-eew, and gai tod prik pao (spicy chicken bites). I liked everything and my favourite is gai tod prik pao dish - absolutely delish! I can't wait for the dine-in experience, so I get some mango sticky rice. If you want to give this place try and order through one of the delivery services, make sure you don't wait until close to their closing time, because by then their famous dishes are sold out. Their food is in demand!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious thai food with excellent service. We shared the satay chicken, the spring rolls, the mooping, shrimp pad thai and the minced pork with basil. They were all delicious and very flavorfu. My fave were definitely the satay chicken with the yummy peanut sauce as well as the pad thai with 4 big shrimps and chewy noodles. I also got the iced tea which tasted great. The place isn't very big, but it's clean and cozy. They have a bar so you can also get drinks here. The waiters are super nice and friendly. Would definitely come back."
/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Literally came here just for their khao soi, and it did not disappoint at all. Although most reviews say that the portions are small, the khao soi was just enough. The flavours reminded me of the exact same khao soi I've had in Thailand that I keep dreaming of. This is probably the only restaurant that has this dish in Montreal (that I've seen or heard of at least). The chicken slid off the bone and into the creamy and spicy broth, which was delicious. The crunchy noodles also blended perfectly with the softer ones in the soup dish. I can't wait to go back to this restaurant as the dish was very authentic, even the spice level. The staff are also super friendly and are always around for anything you may need. They even set up the dish in front you so that it is picture ready!"
/user_details?userid=akCG-uYnMqaRR0fr1zpyig,David G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I had the shrimp pad Thai here and I loved it! I've been searching for good Thai food in montreal, and this was probably the best pad Thai I've had. The flavor of the sauce was noticably better than that of other places, you could taste the shrimp in the sauce, while in that of other places, it tastes more cheap and basic. It's definately pricier than most places, I paid a total of $19, +3 for shrimp, but the quality was great.Two things I just have to mention. I ordered takeout and they did not include hot sauce which I was a bit disappointed by. The flavor was good and it didn't need it though. There were only 3 shrimp in the dish. They were large and tasted great but for the price I would have expected at least 4-5."
/user_details?userid=za-_E0w58gRS2_9mHicmkQ,Li S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This was an excellent diner and overall a memorable evening. Will definitely come back with more friends! The service was attentive and very flexible on your cocktails orders which I love! They also had a small selection of vin nature, which we were able to try first. The meal stated with a platter which I highly recommend to share and taste a little of everything. That was followed by the main dishes, which were incredibly tasty. This is one of my favorite resto in the city. The extra thing I love about this place is the extra topping which included spicy Chili crisps and Thai hot peppers in fish sauce. Man I was sweating!!"
/user_details?userid=k0ZM8d7pRCEqbkRLWJ0-aw,Rita Z.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",5 star rating,A really nice place with great choice of food! Their tom yum soup is delicious!!!! Take the spicy salad if you can handle itI will come back thats for sure!The decor is nice its cozy!
/user_details?userid=7EVsupIaYa9Cmfo4jJoTmA,Emma F.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"A newly opened restaurant that I'm so glad we stumbled upon on Yelp. The decor of the restaurant was very modern and aesthetic. We shared the chicken satay appetizer, chicken bad thai, and green curry. The satay was juicy and the peanut sauce it was paired with was delicious. The pad thai flavors were a bit more muted than I like. The green curry was delicious and you could taste the coconut milk base. I was craving mango sticky rice that just happened to be the seasonal dessert! The rice was slightly sweet and the coconut milk to pour on top was perfect.Highly recommend you visit the restaurant if you are in the area!"
/user_details?userid=iJ_sn6RfwO5unR9YgFTd4Q,Camille R.,"Côte-des-Neiges, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"we had the street food platter - it was a nice plate to try a few of their appetizers. Next time , I would get the full portion of Thai style green papaya salad - it was phenomenal. Then we had their chicken pad Thai which was delicious and would highly recommend it. Then we had one of their beef dishes that wasn't on the regular menu - it was good but I would probably not get this one next time - lacking a bit of originality. Finally, we tried their Khao soi soup - first time having it since my visit to Toronto - it was very good as well and would order again. When you go to pick up your food you get 10% off. One of the bets part of my visit was their super friendly staff. I would definitely come back to try more !!"
/user_details?userid=R9Cx2rilFJe-K_DQ5i2EAA,Ashley H.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,After the reviews I decided to give this place a try! For now I will give them the benefit of the doubt and say that this is a common issue when ordering certain restos through Uber! Your experience definitely will not be the same as sitting in the restaurant as I'm sure they are rushed and unable to take proper care in the quality or packaging of the food when trying to quickly ensure it's ready for Uber pick up! I always review the restaurants on Google and Yelp before ordering and given the reviews are fairly new but decent I gave this place a try! However was HIGHLY disappointed! My green Thai legit had 2 inches of oil visibly sitting on top of the green curry. With that much oil makes me wonder if eating out is even safe anymore?!
/user_details?userid=fg84diFNYRKQCH_dkj_eBg,Rabih C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Ordered out. Excellent happy service. Explained and helped choose great three choices.
/user_details?userid=5vXMMeonwwLUv1sPkXzYHQ,Kaman S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,This restaurent is One of my favourite authentic Thai cuisine in Montreal. Staffs are friendly! Canadian may find the portion is a bit small.
/user_details?userid=iMmxJQMeHv9asInkPP_q7Q,Andy C.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"Food taste very good. Just a little salty, I personally don't eat things with too much salt therefore I would think it's salty. But service and atmosphere is amazing here."
/user_details?userid=HxgYMXZiMEm8kcVDfJmhxg,Chris R.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is thai food. As authentic and delicious as it can get outside of thailand. Is there more to say?Yes! Cozy atmosphere, super nice staff, fair prices, great quality. 5 stars well deserved. First thai place I found that serves Khao Soi, so I was excited to go and try. This specially is usually found in the northern parts of Thailand around Chiang Mai. The creamy tangy broth and the chicken thigh topped with crunshy noodles. The fresh onions make the special taste in this dish. And Thammada served it perfectly. We also ordered some side dishes and the tom yum starter soup. Pork skewers (Moo Ping) were soft, juicy and delicious. The Son-in-Law eggs are worth a try. The tamarinde sauce and that style of egg is another thai flavour  off the beaten path. Minced pork with thai basil... served with rice and spicy fishsauce to add for your liking. Just the way I love it. So was the Tom yum. Tha thai inspired cocktails were all done with great care and thought. I chose a Bangkok Ice tea. Great peachy flavour. My wife had the Lost in thailand. Subtle taste of the holy basil. And I later had The muai thai which comes with a slightly spicy note. Oh did I mention the super nice staff? We felt well taken care of and are looking forward to come again soon as this place really brings back all the memories of thailand and its flavours. Thank you for that"
/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Went to this newly opemed resto with a group of 10 foodie friends and loved it! First I must comment on the resto decor which was so charming and elegant . The resto itself is small but we were able to reserve for a group of 10. They also have a gorgeous outdoor terrace. The ambiance is very upscale and romantic - perfect place for a date, marriage proposal/ anniversary celebration or a night out with friends! The menu has a tapas concept so I strongly suggest ordering 2-3 entrees to share per 3 persons and two - three main dishes to share as the entrees are small portions. I ordered their thai ice tea which was amazing !  So refreshing and not to sweet. The food was super amazing delicious!! My favorite dishes were the crispy chicken which was too die for!!  Second favorite was the curry beef and pad thai - one word DELICIOUS !!! My least favorite was the papaya salad which was to spicy!  Service was friendly and welcoming!  I would recommend this place as their dishes were very authentic and yummy!!! Will definately go back!!!"
/user_details?userid=B2dCuPWehjXPGvcemFA1_Q,Aras B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I organized a birthday party for my wife at Thammada.  It couldn't have gone any better.  Owner, Chitakone, took amazing care of us despite being a large group of 12.  We started with some delicious cocktails designed by a mixologist specially for Thammada.  Everyone loved them!  I would come back just for these amazing drinks alone!  There were so many unique items on the menu it was hard to choose.  We shared a few Street platters and duck dumplings to start.  Just amazing!  For my main I had the Khao Soi Gai which became an instant comfort food for me.  It had crunchy fried noodles along with soup noodles giving the dish an inviting mouth feel.  It also came with a perfectly braised chicken leg and some kind of wonderful diced pickle on the side.  There was attention to detail in everything.  The most unique and authentic Thai place in the city by far!"
/user_details?userid=NEek9tPD5ve2tg_br7CE_w,Bob B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Excellent Thai restaurant. We had the spicy papaya salad (excellent, full of lime and fish sauce), spicy Tom Yum pot-au-feu (creamy without any coconut milk in it, thanks to a masterfully done broth of calamari and shrimp), and the green curry (very well done).Khao Sao Gai was actually our least favorite, a bit blander than the rest, and the chicken was just a small drumstick, nothing too special. Still a delicious soup overall! Just surprised to see others rave about it that much.Spice levels definitely aren't toned down, the dishes with three chili signs deliver a solid spicy experience if you're a fan of that.Slightly smaller portions, but decent prices considering the neighbourhood."

/user_details?userid=reipvRp7rg-O2HoKwopcxA,Jennifer P.,"Brighton, Canada",4 star rating,"I hate to be breaking the five stars but I thought the food needed improvement, especially for the Outremont prices. Something was missing in the curry of my khao soi (and the taste had a floury element to it that I did not compute) and I've eaten this dish all over Thailand, including the north. The papaya isaan was appropriately spiced but somewhat small in portion. The drinks can be stronger. But these are somewhat minor issues and I am grateful to have another Thai place nearby."
/user_details?userid=ZXB6_76VBI85AnRAKHlYHQ,Xuemei X.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Great restaurant! Food is good and the owner is very hospitable. Will definitely come back again.

The service is sweet, welcoming, and engaging. The ambiance is beautiful, playful and inviting. Definitely the best restaurant on Avenue Bernard and the most inventive Thai restaurant in Montréal. The staff at Tham Ma Da are all exceptional and Twan is simply THE BEST!"
/user_details?userid=vgtrVZhrt5LpMLCtbD4kvg,Judy P.,"Arlington, VA",5 star rating,This is some of the best Thai food I have ever had. We picked this restaurant on a whim while staying in Montréal. What an amazing experience and meal. I recommend trying their specialty - the Khao Soi Gai. It's seriously amazing - great flavor and depth. The specialty cocktails and great music set add that extra element. The service was amazing. Check this new restaurant out - you will not regret it!

/user_details?userid=JOHrgLqMRTIUIwM20nVa8g,Marina B.,"Outremont, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,My husband and I had a great evening at Thammada. The ambiance was casual and cozy. The cocktails were great ( we especially loved the Mai Thai) and the food was amazing. We even order twice the same appetizer since it was soo good ( the duck dumplings which were an evening special). The portions are not huge but they were satisfying. We will be back for sure!
/user_details?userid=SOnhzfUKirZHcWu3zSJdoQ,Kevin Y.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,This is the best Thai restaurant I've tried in Montreal. The green curry noodle and the red curry rice are amazing. The environment is cozy as well. I like the decoration style very much.
/user_details?userid=oXzsOcEooE99YHd-3GE64g,Ashley O.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,I went to Thammada last night with my boyfriend and we were pleasantly surprised. We got an order of Satay skewers as an appetizer and ordered the Pad Se-Eew and the Khra Prao. We also ordered two cocktails called the never ending summer and Mango sticky rice for dessert. We absolutely loved the food and the ambience. My boyfriend and I spent a month in Thailand a few years ago and the food was even better than the food than the food in Thailand. The service was amazing too! The waiters were friendly and polite and explained all the dishes when they arrived. We will definitely be going back!!
