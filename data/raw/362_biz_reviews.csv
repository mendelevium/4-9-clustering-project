I feel maybe it's been improved further? Goma ae also delicious. Happy to have found a great ramen with a non meat broth! For delivery the soup and the veg/noodles are separate so no spilling and also the nori stays crispy!

Creamy broth, great mix of flavours, the meat was perfectly seasoned and tender. The egg complimented the broth well. The only thing missing was corn! The only thing I found a bit weak were the noodles. They were thin and a bit too stuck together."

Maybe I just need to get used to it because this dish is completely new to me but I thought that the ""rich broth"", as people say, was greasy. If you like creamy texture, go for it but I am just warning you, if you prefer broth similar to water & that is easy to drink, choose another option."

/user_details?userid=ahDxPzmaQuSOQtQMvZryZw,Anthony B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Quick service in a small ramen shop, but the ramen left me wanting.The noodles were good, the pork was braised great and super tender. However the broth of the tonkatsu did not stand out to me. It wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing either. I went with regular saltiness, but next time I'm going to try extra salt and see if it's better. If the broth is better, I'll probably edit the review and up a starI also had edamame that was pretty good. Piping hot and nicely salted.It's not a bad spot. Welcoming, pretty tasty, but there's a bunch of ramen spots in town that I may rather go to for now. I will be back!"

I was looking for something new in the area and I found this little place. Their spicy ramen is delicious and so is the regular ramen.The place seem to be pretty popular, we arrived around 17:30 and it was already pretty busy, by the time we finished eating there was a 10 something people line in front waiting for a table. It's inexpensive and rich in flavor and their takoyaki is pretty good too. Definitely will be coming back there again!"

So many people were waiting, and we got a seat at the little counter area. I loved the vibe, it was so cozy and warm. A server helped us immediately, and the food came out quite fast. There are great vegetarian and vegan options. I ordered the veggie spicy miso tonkotsu, which was pork-based broth with tofu and vegetables. They have vegan broth available for those who don't eat meat at all. The broth was HEAVENLY. I ordered low sodium, and it was fine for me. The tofu came in very thin layers, and they were SO TENDER. I was in shock that the tofu could be so delicious. The noodles are the proper thin, straight ramen type. Soft-boiled were delicious (I got an extra one), and I felt that the portions were very generous. The chicken karaage was also excellent, especially the sauce that it came with. I would definitely come back. The ambiance and food are perfect for wintertime!"

I planned on having dinner there with my husband since it was recommended by the locals. Unlike most ramen places I've been to, this place was quiet and it made us look like loud Americans which we didn't intended to. Our servers were nice and attentive. She recommended us getting the Chashu Tonkotsu with spicy miso. I also loved that you could choose the saltiness of the broth! I went with low (from low, regular and high).I'd give my ramen 5 out of 5! Loved the pork bone broth and braised pork. I asked for extra egg and Nori and stuffed myself. Be aware that the portion is big, so don't order any extras unless you add really hungry! For $13.50 (Canadian), it's so worth it! And it's located in such a nice location in Mile End. I would definitely come back next time I'm in town!"

Place is very authentic and have cute decorations. Lots of appetizers to choose from. The pork is very flavorful. Egg has a unique sweet taste. If you like spicy, definitely try their takana and spicy miso. Also have a vegan option, but I prefer the pork bone broth. The matcha cheesecake is very good.They have a 5 to 7 where beers are half off, cheers! I enjoy the ambience and food is top notch."

The broth was interesting and also allowed you to choose the saltiness level. The egg tasted nice and overall was a good meal even though I'm not a fan of ramen. The appetizers were very savoury: the karaage chicken was very rich in flavour and the takoyakis looked splendid.

/user_details?userid=HUkLmF3TUDZQRw7kfw0Pxw,Kartik G.,"Boston, MA",3 star rating,Wanted to try Ramen and found good reviews about this place. The way you order is different from how I am used to order in the US. They had you a paper and you tick the options you want. I tried the veggie ramen. The broth was okay. It had tofu and veggies. The portion was quite a lot. I wish they could make a spicy veggie broth. They have happy hour for half the price on beers. My only suggestion is that maybe the veggie broth they could add some more flavors like make it spicy or have different options like the meat broths so that it could be made more attractive and tasty.
/user_details?userid=wJF-NdtxYCk_SrwG4UUL9Q,Stephanie L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Located in the heart of Mile End on St. Laurent, this place has a great location. There are many shops around for some pre- or post-meal exploring! When you enter the restaurant, you are greeted in Japanese with a hello! This actually happens in Japan, so they're trying to give a nice authentic vibe. It's a cute space, with lots of wood and some plants. It does feel like a little Japanese ramen shop. They offer both vegan and vegetarian for options. They also have a variety appetizers including chicken karaage, salmon sashimi and some other things. My boyfriend and I have tried the karaage and the sashimi, both are pretty tasty. When you are seated, the waiter will give an introduction of how things work in the restaurant. Similar to other ramen places, there is a little ordering sheet which you can select the type of ramen and any other extras you want. I always opt for the original Miso (sometimes I choose spicy) broth with char sui (BBQ pork). It's a good ramen, large bowl, coming with seaweed, hard boiled egg and generous portions of pork. This hasn't disappointed me yet. Now I'm not sure that it is the best ramen in the city, but it's pretty good."

The place is quite nice and had a nice ambiance for ramen. The takowasa is inexpensive and is amazing. It wasn't too salty like many other places and had that wasabi kick in every bite. As for the ramen, i was pretty disappointed. It wasn't anything special and lacked a bit of flavor. The people sitted at the bar had those gingers and other sides to add to it, but we didn't have any at the table. The service is just ok. They never came to refill our water bottle and we had to wait in line at the cash to pay. I dont think I will come back."
/user_details?userid=933NaWG9W6Z-1pXMFPKOoQ,Mimi J.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"I won a birthday giveaway contest on Instagram for a free ramen and drink so I came here to try it out on a Sunday evening.I got takoyaki as an appetizer as I was starving, and it was yummy; crispy on the edges and ooey gooey on the insides; it could have been slightly more hot/fresh, but was still satisfying. I got the miso ramen with the spicy sauce on the side, which I suggest you do so that you can taste the broth on its own. The broth itself is not too thin and somewhat thick, and has a great depth of flavour. The meat is super tender and not oily. The noodles are very thin and soak up a lot of the flavour! The addition of some green vegetables was welcome and balanced the rich broth and meat. I really loved the fact that the garlic oil was at every table to use as one pleases, which adds a lot of depth of flavour. I added some oil and some of the chili sauce/oil (that I had requested on the side) with each bite, and it was a wonderful harmony of salty, spicy, and umami. The only aspects I miss are having the pork be a little crisp on the edges, and the wiggly strands of seaweed (not nori) that are sometimes in ramen bowls (at Sansotei). Overall, I found the ramen very authentic and brought back memories of my time in Japan this year. Service was friendly, and the atmosphere was fun and with an open concept kitchen. They also have a happy hour special on Sapporo beer!"
/user_details?userid=W90xlJgPOqkwWPN1KORPOw,Andrew C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Cute simple ramen shop. Tonkatsu broth was just right on, not too salt, not too blend. Just right. I can totally understand that some might find it not salty enough since it is just right on. So, if you are used to salty flavor ramen, make sure you go for extra. Otherwise, a regular broth does just the job! I would totally rate this place 4.5 stars, but I end up giving a 5 star because it has one of the best Takoyaki (Crispy octopus meatballs) I ever had in Montreal. I still fantasize about it when I think about it. It is crispy and yet it just melts in your mouth. The flavor/sauce of Takoyaki was just perfect too. Â Perfect spot for quick lunch or after-work meal."

I go here at basically every chance I get to order my standard (spicy chashu pork ramen with extra egg) and it's absolutely delicious every time. The broth is creamy and super tasty, and their spicy miso sauce adds just the right amount of kick! (they usually give it to you in a small separate bowl so you can add as much as you want.) Their karaage and chicken cold ramen are also fantastic. amazing decor and ambience too! I recommend going in the early evening for dinner or else for lunch since they have been super crowded with no seats available later at night."

/user_details?userid=Y_h-nrOIIZWBF-AFzdQbgQ,Matthew P.,"Laval, Canada",4 star rating,Really enjoy my meal at Tsukuyomi the ramen was excellent was perfect weather to stop by and enjoy a nice hot soup. Felt like a anime character enjoying there food lol . The appetizer was a fried chicken that was also good . The ramen plates are all beautiful when you get them and 13$ is not so expensive for the amount you get . Few problems is that it's small and the seating is not super confortable it's kind of one of those bar tables where people are sitting really close specially when it's packed they have a few tables but not many and it's for groups of 3 or more . The cheese cake is good but a bit to small wish I hade just a little for for my 3$. Over all I day worth trying for now this is my number 1 ramen place.
/user_details?userid=cpChkPvGOhp8lcyiLwj3eA,Hibeh D.,"Berlin, CT",4 star rating,"Like many in the area, Tsukuyomi offers fast, flavorful food in a casual setting. Most seating is shared/counter style. We tried two of their ramen options, the chicken and the vegan. For the non-vegan option, you are given the choice of saltiness in the broth-low, medium or high. All come with a spicy Miso option which is served on the side so you can control the exact degree of spiciness. If you want a no frills bowl of ramen and a side this is a solid spot."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-SupÃ©rieur, Canada",3 star rating,"The 'vegetable ramen' is delicious, but be careful - the broth is actually pork bone broth, not veggie. When we realized this and ordered a vegan ramen instead, we were bummed to discover that the vegan broth is very basic. There's so much more you can do to make a vegan broth amazing! Miso! Mushrooms! This was pretty flavourless, sadly. But we loved the room, cozy and calm and lovely and traditional. We loved the young Japanese staff working hard behind the counter. The location is great and if you eat meat there are lots of I'm sure wonderously tasty options. I definitely recommend getting the spicy pickled mustard greens to add to your ramen - such an awesome flavour!"
/user_details?userid=7jdjcNBbcpNKFlHRduZIxA,Sophia L.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Honestly confused why this place has such low ratings considering my experience...but let's break it down: SERVICE: We arrived ~6pm and it was a good time, because we got a choice of seats. The way it works is confusing. You look at a menu, but then you write check your order down on a piece of paper in front of you (1 paper/meal/person btw we tried to put both our orders on 1 and they just separated it for us...). After that, it definitely took awhile for the food to cook. I could see why though, they have a small kitchen. And actually, it's a kitchen, dish washing area, bar, and reception/pay area. It was a small giant mess, so they didn't have too many cooks in the kitchen to do everything at once. Our sides came first, followed closely by our ramen. After we finished our food, it had started getting busy (~6.30) and that was when the service went ""downhill"". Downhill only because there was only really one waitress waiting on everyone, waiting for people to order, sit down new customers, and bringing the food to people. If you go around then, be prepared to initiate with the waitress and don't wait. We weren't in a rush to get anywhere, so we were ok waiting for her. FOOD: We heard good things about their karaage from other reviewers, so we ordered that and the takoyaki. The takoyaki was ok - it was deep fried. If I had to redo our order, I would've just ordered 2 plates of karaage (each plate came with 4). I ordered the charshu spicy miso ramen. The waitress would ask you if you want it on the side and...I recommend for anyone who wants spicy but cannot necessarily handle it well to get it on the side because you won't regret it lol I wasn't paying attention and just told them to put it in the broth...it was a good mistake. The spice was SO GOOD. It would taste so good in the first bite that you would keep eating it, but then it's the kind of spicy that eventually builds up the more you want to eat. Even though I cannot handle spice, I still loved it. My bf got the original/regular charshu miso and it was good for him too. I actually had to finish the rest of my noodles + charshu in his broth and it was good too. ***NOTE***: If you go before 7pm, their Sapporo is half off. $3 for a glass of beer is pretty good in my opinion. ***NOTE #2***: You get a LOT of bang for your buck. 2 large piecs of meat that just melt in your mouth, and soooo much noodles. Even my bf was pleasantly surprised by how much noodle he was consuming. We are used to ramen places that give us 5-7 good scoops of noodles and we got about 10-15 scoops easily. (Scoops using chopsticks btw.) For the price, you cannot beat this meal. It was not super expensive and we were so satiated after. OVERALL: Visit. It was the only ramen place on our list for this trip, and it was WORTH IT. Even though it's far from DT MTL."

This place is not nearly as bad as many of its competitors. But it's not good and it's not cheap. Service is good but the ramen is just not. Flavorless broth, bean sprouts, small amounts of pork with a lot of fat. There's like pink sushi ginger at the table?"

/user_details?userid=RWWXHxog0xp9wQsVraJZHQ,Fei Heng Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Their ramen is very delicious! I highly recommend this place if you are looking for an authentic Japanese ramen with Tonkontsu broth. Their broth is the best one I tried so far, it is really rich and creamy. What surprised me the most is that the broth is not too heavy neither too greasy. Not to forget their egg, it is so well flavored. I usually take their most traditional one which is the Tonkotsu Chasu ramen. Their Chasu (pork meat) is really well done and tasty. What I like about their Chasu is that it doesn't have a really thick part of fat on their pork meat. If you like your ramen to be spicy, they have the spicy takana to add in your ramen, and it is absolutely Â something you have to try!"

We went there on a Friday night and got there at 8pm. There was a line up with 10 people in front of us and we waited approximately 50min so we actually had a lot of time to observe (and get hungry). There was clearly a lack of efficiency in the service and the restaurant needs to review their logistics. We finally sat down and ordered two tonkotsu ramen with chashu and a side of goma ae (Japanese spinach). The ramen was not bad, I actually found the broth pretty tasty (I added the black garlic oi), the noodles were ok. The piece of pork that I got had also too much fat for my taste. I liked the ambiance, it was cozy with fun Japanese music.Overall, it was ok ramen but I wouldn't get out of my way to go there."

I heard so many good things about this place, and truly the sauce for the ramen was well broiled with the pork. (although I felt the pork tasted little bit like a bbq) I liked the ramen in general as it wasnt too salty or strong with the meat flavor."
/user_details?userid=WmIqb6uCqJbxWp9k7ZU-hw,Jennifer T.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I got so excited when I saw there was a new ramen restaurant in Montreal as I'm a huge ramen-lover! After seeing a lot of pictures of this new ramen place in Montreal and really good reviews from my friends (one of them is a food blogger!), I decided to try it out with my friend.We went there for a Saturday lunch and surprisingly there wasn't any lineup at 12:15 PM (there were still at least 10 seats available). Maybe it's because it's summer time and the weather is still nice (23 but feels like 30 degrees Celsius) so people are not craving for a boiling bowl of ramen yet? Nonetheless, it was a bit odd as other brunch places around the area (Lawrence, Sparrow, Faberge) were packed with people and there were lineups around the same time. And also, with the opening of new restaurants, there is usually more people who would want to try it out, right? (FYI, they opened on August 7, 2017)Tsukuyomi's ordering system is like Yokato Yokabai: there is a sheet of paper that you can fill out your name and check what you would like to order. The menu is simple, they have 6 sides (edamame, salad, goma-ae, takowasa, mini chasu don, steamed rice) and 4 different ramen (veggie tonkotsu, chasu tonkotsu, chicken tonkotsu and vegan). You can customize the thickness of your ramen (thick or thin) and the saltiness of your broth (low, regular and high). You can also add extra soft boiled egg, chasu, chicken, nori and spinach.I settled down for their chashu tonkotsu (pork bone broth + braised pork belly topping as described on their menu) and I added a soft boiled egg as I didn't know the ramen also comes with 1/2 of a soft boiled egg. To be honest, I think their menu is a bit misleading as it didn't include what exactly the ramen comes with. Usually, in other ramen places like Kinton, Misoya or Yokato Yokabai, it is clearly indicated what it comes with (1/2 or 1 egg, the number of chasu pieces, nori, etc.) so customers wouldn't have to wonder whether it comes with other toppings or not and whether they have to add extra toppings or not. In my knowledge, usually what is described under the name of the dish is usually what it comes with (ingredients/toppings), so I thought this ramen only comes with the braised pork belly. And yes, some ramen places in Asia like Ichiran would serve a bowl of ramen that comes with chasu (no other toppings unless you add them). For the thickness and saltiness, I decided to go with their thick noodles and regular broth. When my ramen came, I was surprised to see so many soft boiled eggs! That was when both my friend and I said: ""Oh! It comes with egg already?!"" And veggie (spinach), nori, and bean sprouts! Their noodles were really thick; the thickest ramen noodles I've ever had, very different from the other ramen houses! I don't know how thin their thin ramen noodles are but it might be better than the thick ones. Don't get me wrong, their thick noodles were really chewer, ""stretchy"" and firm (the way I like) but because it was so thick, it couldn't really absorb the broth, so almost every bite I took, I was only able to taste/eat the noodles that were a bit bland. The regular broth was on a blander side as it was not salty at all but lacking a bit of flavor I feel. The broth was light and not greasy. I wished the broth could be thicker and creamier though. Maybe next time, if I decide to go back again, I will pick their thin noodles with high saltiness broth (trust me, I have never went for high saltiness because usually it would be too salty).My piece of chasu was a disappointment. From the pictures and description of my food blogger friend, the chasu was a big as her hand but mine was barely 1/3 of hers (and half of my piece was just fat). The more I compare my bowl of ramen with hers, the more I feel cheated. I'm not sure if Tsukuyomi gave her a bigger piece with more veggies too because she is a food blogger and it would look nicer in her pictures but that would be a bit misleading and unfair for regular customers, right? (this is just my assumption though, no harsh feelings!) Their chasu was however very tender and flavorful! Their soft-boiled egg was a bit disappointing as well. The yolk wasn't runny (it was a bit overcooked) but it was well-marinated and still tender. The amount of veggies I got wasn't as described by my food blogger friend either (I felt the need to add extra spinach). They also didn't have the black garlic oil as mentioned by my same friend... Our waitress told us they only had spicy oil. I think with garlic oil, the tonkotsu ramen would taste even better (definitely richer in texture). Overall, the bowl of ramen was pretty small for the price ($13).I hope they will re-adjust their menu and make the size of the chasu piece more consistent. The staff were friendly but not very attentive as it took them a while to notice us when we asked for the black garlic oil. For now, I give them 2.5/5 as I think there is a lot of room for improvement."

He was trying very hard and being apologetic, but there was a feeling that some things were probably forgotten or delayed due to the crowd. I'd also suggest that everyone pick the extra-salty option for the broth; it more or less equates to ""regular"" at most of Montreal's other ramen shops. Those two points aside, it's wonderful to finally have a good ramen shop in the Mile End; the decor is cozy, the menu strikes a nice balance between simple and interesting, and the ramen itself is pretty serviceable.

We have had several excellent meatless ramen broths (in Montreal and elsewhere). Sadly, the broth here had no flavour. It tasted like a very basic vegetable stock. A bouillon cube would have made a tastier broth. The kitchen clearly did not take any extra steps or use ingredients, like roasted mushrooms, kombu, or miso, to make a rich tasty broth. The ramen was garnished with some sad looking string beans and raw, cold cherry tomatoes. This is supposed to be vegetarian ramen, not a dumpy vegetable soup. The tofu seemed to have been marinated in only soy sauce and maybe some sugar and barely heated through in the broth. The egg was nicely cooked with a soft yolk, but cold in the center. I ordered the octopus appetizer (I can't recall the name) and the tonkotsu chashu. The appetizer was a mixture of octopus, seaweed and spinach that you wrap in sheets of nori and eat as a roll. The octopus was nicely seasoned with wasabi, but there couldn't have been more than a tablespoon of octopus in he mixture. So you're really paying $4 for some seaweed and spinach. As for my ramen, the broth was pedestrian. Not terrible, but lacking the full flavour and palate coating richness that I like in ramen. The pork itself was fine, but the portion was meager. Overall, the place has a patina of authenticity but lacks substance."

It's solidly tasty ramen, especially once you determine your personal fave combo of saltiness, extras and condiments. The service is friendly and welcoming, and has gotten over some initial opening hiccups mentioned by other reviewers. The seating setup and decor is quite neat too."

The noodles were a bit more al dente than I like but still nice and chewy. The regular broth was flavourful. Not the best ramen I ever had in Montreal but a good option in that area. Went for lunch and the whole resto was full. I liked the ambience... natural light, natural wood. It was very zen! Not a lot of option of broths and toppings (would have liked to see ground pork, corn, etc) but honestly I can't complain as the chasu hit the spot for me."
