I wish I could try some of the other things! Also it's not a great idea to eat in the winter, they do have much better options! They also have bubble tea which was good too! Service was quick and it is also very interesting that a lot of people had takeout!"
/user_details?userid=gRTJX1byUA31E0OBqfYPIw,Veronica C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Meet Fresh has an extensive choice of dessert! It is a great place for Taiwanese desserts! They serve both hot and cold drinks and desserts such as Taiwanese shaved ice and hot red bean soup with taro ball. It is quite pricey, but the portions of the shaved ice are large. You probably need to share one with 3 to 4 people to finish it.The red bean shaved ice was incredible! The condensed milk dripped slowly down to the milk shaved ice and to the red bean from the scoop of vanilla ice cream. Heaven! It was very sweet, however, if you take a sip of the purple rice drink, it balances out the sweetness of the shaved ice. The Gemini shaved ice was very good, not too excessively sweet compare to the red bean shaved ice. The strawberries and mangos were very fresh! I would recommend ordering this one if you prefer something less sweet.The toppings in the Q mochi shaved ice include a scoop of ice cream, taro ball, pudding, tapioca pearls and Q mochi. The toppings were very chewy and my favourite would be the taro ball! The taro balls were soft and chewy with a subtle sweetness.Red Bean Milk Shaved Ice ($10.7)Gemini Milk Shaved Ice ($13.7)Q Mochi Milk Shaved Ice ($10.7)"

I found their price is slightly higher than average but the amount of food is not more than average.  The restaurant is very clean and nice.  Overall I'll go back to try more things."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",3 star rating,"I'm not sure how to feel about this dessert. I've had variations of these in Singapore and they were never my favourite thing. However, I do appreciate that there is finally somewhere to get these in Montreal. The restaurant is very nice and cute. Their menu is very well made even though it is quite confusing if you don't know what the items are. My friend ordered for us so I'm no sure what it was called but it had condensed milk, boba, lychee, red bean paste, shaved ice, mochi, and tons more I probably forgot. The desserts are huge, impossible to eat alone. If this type of dessert is something you enjoy, then I think you'll absolutely love this place."

/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A chain dessert bar from Taiwan. Chinese name is 鲜芋仙。I tried it in China before and I loved it. When I heard about it opening in Montreal I was so thrilled. There is always a line when I passed by before. This time I found a late night time 9:30 to visit, and it's still packed. Went to counter to order and got a beeping reminder to pick up the food. We had one bowl of taro and taro balls mixed(#4), and one almond pudding( like a soft tofu) with mochi ( sticky rice cake). They were authentic. We loved both dishes. The shaved ice was poured on some black sugar syrup, so good. Mochi was covered with same syrup too. The texture of mochi was very chewy which was unique to me. Will come back again to try other dishes."

Can just sit and hang out with big groups too.Was looking for traditional dessert (less sweet) and got just what I wanted! Would recommend-the milk tea with taro and boba: the taro in the drink adds a root-y flavor that naturally sweetens the drink.-The shaved ice: enough to share for 3-4 people to be honest. Was a bit too much but the two of us hunkered down and finished it. The pudding was tasty, the black sesame mochi had filling. The other sides were ok; a bit tasteless but the condense milk made up for that -the hot almond drink to help balance out all that shaved ice!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Finally some good traditional chinese desserts. They serve a variety of items, such as grass jelly, mochi, taro, tofu pudding, milk tea, etc. The almond pudding is so smooth and has a strong almond taste. Everything is pretty good. The milk tea tastes a bit ordinary, but adding mini taro balls in it definitely makes it better. There was a huge lineup today for the opening because everything is half price for the first 3 days. The place is nicely decorated and the staff is nice. After ordering, the food came very quickly. Don't forget to get the app to get a free drink and points!"
/user_details?userid=qfCHqKbLR48haYCM3As_AQ,Alex F.,"Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I really like this place for dessert. Their signature meet fresh bowl has grass jelly, mochi-like taro and sweet potato balls, and a brown sugar syrup to pour over the shaved ice. They also have a Milk tea that's really good but I would advise you ask for less sugar since it's quite sweet. A go-to place if you're near Concordia and looking for a place at 10pm for dessert."
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I tried to go during their opening promotion (50% off!!), but the line up was way too long. So I waited a couple weeks and went today!What a treat!! The weather was pretty warm and we were excited to eat some refreshing desserts. There was no line up and even some available tables inside, so we were pretty happy. We got the grass jelly #2 (toppings: Sweet Potato+Barley+Boba+Mini Taro Ball) and taro ball #4 (toppings: Taro+Red Bean+Boba). They gave me a beeper and I went to wait at our table. Not even 10 min later, my beeper signaled that food was ready. The desserts were absolutely delicious!! The shaved ice was gently doused in brown sugar syrup, which gave a beautiful caramelly taste to the dish. The consistency of the taro balls was great, and the other toppings complemented each other. They forgot to give me the creamer to pour on top of the grass jelly, so I went to ask for it. They apologized for the mistake and offered to remake the bowl! I declined and just asked for the creamer, but they insisted... So I got a second bowl of dessert. I was pretty full at this point so we took the rest home. Really nice service!The menu is extremely flexible, and you can pretty much make your own custom bowl of goodness with their selection of extra toppings. Prices are not cheap, but portions are quite generous and the quality is really nice. I think it's worth mentioning that most of the desserts at Meet Fresh use ingredients uncommonly found in Western desserts (e.g. the ""medicinal"" taste of grass jelly might be an acquired taste). These ingredients are also fairly unprocessed (e.g. chunks of boiled sweet potato). It might seem unusual, but is quite refreshing!  We'll be back for sure! The shaved ice plates look amazing!"
/user_details?userid=iF_nTUa6rS-o7MfFHD1dNg,Alice F.,"Flagstaff, AZ",4 star rating,"Pleased to find an outpost of this dessert franchise in Montreal! These classic Taiwanese desserts are great for sharing, so go with others. The shaved ice was huge--almost too big! The almond pudding was nice and creamy, and the red bean was a good texture. There were so many drink choices, I just went with one I knew, but you can play around with all sorts of ingredients. The posted menu is a little hard to read, so be sure to pick up a printed menu, but then please, as a courtesy to others, step back from the counter while you decide. I saw a big group there clogging up the queue, preventing others from ordering! The teas you can obviously get to go, but plan on hanging out to eat the shaved ice. They have free WiFi too, so I can see this being a place to hang out for students!"

I tasted their boba shaved iced, it was pretty good at the beginning, but at the end it only tasted like plain ice. The portions are big, you could share the shaved ice with 4 people."
/user_details?userid=e30nkqMd2leReeIllmQdfw,Ella C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,shaved ice! Super sweet and super huge!!!! I recommend to take one bowl of shaved ice for three ppl. I saw one group ordering one shaved per person... the look on their face.. priceless! Tastes was good but the ice is bit rough. It is smoother than typical hawaiian cone ice.
/user_details?userid=uYyfXuaimxhvRuT6hEtIWg,Gia Loc D.,"Mont-Royal, Canada",4 star rating,"Mango shaved ice from the all new Meet Fresh in Downtown, Montreal * Overall, pretty satisfying * The mango flavour tastes natural and not excessively sweet * Creamy texture, made of different syrups and probably condensed milk * Compared to Zoé's, the shaved ice is not as cloudy/melty and there is no other toppings although Zoé's has its advantages I actually prefer Meet Fresh's shaved ice because the ice is not made of milk but rather bathed in milk and syrups * 7.8/10 Gia points  ..........................................."
/user_details?userid=WjubMPPFUi0Srt-62tRf4Q,Mikayla R.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"If you are familiar with Meet Fresh and Taiwanese desserts, you will know what to expect. It's nothing over the top, but they stick to basics and it works. In other Meet Fresh locations I've been to, they don't let you substitute some ingredients even though they are the same charge and separate before assembly anyways. Here they let you substitute so you can get a dessert with the toppings you want. Service is friendly and they play old-school Cantonese music. Can't go wrong! The only thing I would say is that it can be quite loud (I think the acoustics amplify regular restaurant noise levels). But that's not something they can control, they already keep the music relatively low to accommodate."

/user_details?userid=eMqCPTl-VRfYqy3niVHnPA,Calvin T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love the taro dessert of this place,and winter melon tea. I always order from Chinese delivery company FanTuan. Probably one of the best Taiwan dessert in the World"
/user_details?userid=VtiHkMISkk69btfo_s0cYw,Luis G.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Nice dessert place with Taiwanese specialties. From different types of tea (including the famous bubble milk tea) to jelly desserts. A little bit of Formosa in Montreal. Yummy
/user_details?userid=Synp0WYQsIdlaSWHvrxe0g,Cin Z.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"The flavour is not that off comparing the ones in China, but the texture is so much sheer , I couldn't even find a full red bean in the red bean based soup. Also they got my order wrong with ""hot"" and ""cold"", it's pretty annoying."
/user_details?userid=g2A5KNz1bxmD3qyUuqeCjg,Sofia S.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,Overall the shaved ice was pretty good. only 3 options to choose from. Mango and strawberry with ice cream on the top...very big portion..Quick service and price is very reasonable.
/user_details?userid=Xgnkm6ryeHNtdIlpPJ5YqQ,Huyn N.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I ordered a signature which had some taro balls, sweet potato balls and some herb jelly. The another had also some jelly with red bean and taro. Also a shaved ice mochi Q. The signature one is fine, it's not really sweet so I liked that the most. The shaved ice is a little bit clumsy cause the ice isn't fine. That made me feel like eating a normal ice cube. I came on the opening day so I got the discount 50% off which was 16$ for total. But I need to consider next time coming here cause it's a little overpriced for me. Not bad but not really special. Based on the menu, there're a lot of choices so maybe I'll come next time to try those."
/user_details?userid=SlWGENN-t346Tsuisr3QLg,Jeffery T.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Went during their opening promotion. I had their mango strawberry ice shavings for two people, large red bean soup, mochi, and egg pudding for dinner. I thank the diabetes grim reaper for not chasing me after that ""meal"". While it can't match the 糖水 I've had in Hong Kong, it's damn close compared to the other shops."
