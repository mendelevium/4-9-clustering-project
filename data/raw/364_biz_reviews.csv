I luckily managed to sit in front of the kitchen and was a delight watching the chefs interact and prep food. Everything my partner and I ordered were delicious but the herbs on every dish got a bit repetitive (mostly and lots of dill). We ordered the homemade currywurst, butternut squash cavatelli, and the poached egg open toast with duck breast, yogurt, and butternut squash. I almost wish we didn't eat through Mile End so that I could eat other things off their menu."

I loveeee bringing people here, they always use fresh ingredients and the atmosphere is super cozy and inviting. I always always get the ravioli soup, it's so hearty and savoury and I can never get enough!"
/user_details?userid=h8xK7S1xXUBP2qXW0ZPxxA,Laura R.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Food is a cut above the rest here. Although we waited upwards of 30 minutes for a table, the food made up for it. The food is a very creative melange of ingredients. I ordered the parsnip pancake, which was really good. My companion ordered the squash tartine which was fabulous. Their scones are also unbelievable.I would suggest arriving promptly at 10am when they open to avoid waiting in a long line to secure a table at this popular brunch spot."

Creative) The bacon thing was nice and their egg is cooked perfectly.It was a good amount of food and we were full.They grow their ingredients upstairs which makes the food taste extra fresh! Nice view and was busy on a Friday afternoon. Simply delightful as @unobtanable has exclaimed.Total was around $50 for 3 people!

My friend and I only came in to have dessert but she ended up getting the soup and it was so good, hearty and warm and savoury. Perfect on a cold, sunny, winter day. The cafe is so inviting and bright. Perfect for brunch. They don't take reservations but it moves quite quickly."

I came on a Saturday for brunch at although the place was packed, we were able to get seated right away.What I loved about Le Butterblume was that the menu items were super unique! Much more interesting than your typical brunch offerings and everything was incredibly tasty. I recommend ordering a bunch of things and sharing, which is what we did. Everything was delicious but the cauliflower cake, Brussels sprout toast and steamed ""bun"" were my favorites.Not only is the food amazing, but the prices are reasonable for what you get and the portions are very generous. Highly recommend Le Butterblume and can't wait to go back next time I'm in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=wJF-NdtxYCk_SrwG4UUL9Q,Stephanie L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I've passed by this place many times, it's cute and very spacious inside. It was written up as one of the best brunch places in Montreal and many friends have told me I've got to try it. To be honest, I think all of that made me have very high expectations. I rate this place as a solid 3.5, I have had better brunch in Montreal and probably wouldn't return. I came with my boyfriend one Sunday morning, we were fortunate and didn't have to wait too long for a table. We found that the menu was a little confusing... better put it was very hipster. It was unclear what was brunch, what was lunch, what was a side dish. I spent most of the time googling what the ingredients were. As a foodie, I usually know what everything is, but this time no haha. I settled on the roast beef sandwich and my boyfriend got some cake. Both were around $15. To pay $15 for a sandwich, I was hoping it would come with a little something on the side, but it didn't. It was a fine sandwich, but nothing to write home about. As for the cake, it was beautifully presented and it was tasty. I just thought it was weird having just a slice of cake for a meal. All in all, I think it was fine, but all the other reviews made me think it was the best of the best and that expectation wasn't made."
/user_details?userid=3xibmgNSEMMtiTP2PlevhQ,Amanda M.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"We were staying in Little Italy and decided to venture a bit to Le Butterblume, and am sure glad I did, since this was one of my most memorable meals. Our group of six got seated at the bar, which worked out well, since it was cool to see all the beautiful plated dishes. I went with the ravioli and this was sooo good and filling. All the ingredients complemented each other quite nicely. Everyone else enjoyed their meals as well. Prices were fair and service was great."
/user_details?userid=GbDfPbqp7gKRwbn116KDSA,Ben K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is one of my favourite joints in town. I love the space, which manages to be spacious and relaxed even when it's full. Beautifully composed plates, wonderfully delicate, layered flavours, all using brunch as a palette. Upon repeated visits, the food didn't blow me away as much, but it still a very refreshing take compared the usual bacon and eggs. Just as an example, the second time I came here I had the dish pictured below, a deft combination of fennel, poached egg, shrimp. Last time was another version served over something close to a latke but a bit dry and tough, with a smoked salmon so potent it punched the dish in the face. Good, but left me dreaming of shrimp. That's going to be my 80s electro band's name, ""Dreaming of Shrimp"".Highly recommend the dumplings in broth dish."
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"A brunch post?! It's been a while hasn't it? Well, my wife and I have crazy schedules which makes weekend brunch a bit of a challenge nowadays. However, a rare opportunity allowed me to meet up with my wife midway through her Saturday workday to finally try a more recent entry in the category of Mile End brunch staple, Le Butterblume. Part coffee shop, part boutique and part restaurant, Le Butterblume offers breakfast and lunch during the week and brunch during the weekend. Headed by Nadine Boudreau and Julie Romano, its location is easy to miss at first - right on the edge between Mile End and Little Italy just before the Van Horne overpass.Le Butterblume is very much an open concept space. There isn't much that separates the boutique front, the cash and bakery counter and then the open kitchen/bar and the seating area in the back. The accents are simple - the brick wall, the open industrial kitchen and then the open garage door with tons of natural sun light coming through with a view of the garden outback. It's simple but very welcoming and comforting.The menu, conceived by Jens Ruoff, is an interesting mix of some German/Austrian influences and more ""traditional"" brunch fare. My wife and I went with a trio of dishes to share together. First up, a gougère ""sandwich"" of nordic shrimp, sour cream, apple and pickles. The gougère itself was nice and flaky with that hint of cheese mixed in. The shrimp were very fresh but the dish in the end lack some punch. Also, the portion was limited given the price of the plate.Our second dish fared better. A 'Kaseknodel' or bread pudding of cheddar and parsley served with cole slaw & juniper berry sour cream. Very interesting texture - soft and tender with strong notes of both cheddar and parsley. The slaw had a nice vinegary note to it which paired well with the richer bread pudding. We didn't note the juniper in the sour cream but it mixed well with everything. An excellent side dish although again a little small portion-wise.We went with one main dish to share and it was the highlight of the meal - the marinated eggplant, pepper and chickpea salad topped with grilled halloumi, mint yogourt, Ontario Peaches and served with homemade pitas. The salad itself has tons of flavour with a nice balance of acidity and freshness. The halloumi of course added some richness and saltiness. The creamy yogurt. The sweet peaches. An excellent example of well balanced and very hearty dish. Sitting at the bar, it was the most common thing coming through the kitchen and I can see why.Le Butterblume is a solid brunch spot that is clearly a hit within the Mile End neighbourhood. Nice vibe, good food - well worth a visit if you are around the area. Just be prepared perhaps to wait in line a bit if you visit on the weekend - which is the classic Montreal brunch experience if you think about it ;)Cheers!"

I guess once the buzz chills this will be a solid 5
/user_details?userid=5ca2MkCJFAMafDrRxLMlXQ,Ash L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've seen more delicious, generous, creative or affordable brunch places nearby but this place is totally worth a try for its healthier options (no excessive bacon+eggs+potato kind of combo) and the extra ""vibe"" it provides: fresh flower cut, tasteful furniture, vibrant plates - small portion, high quality and easy to share. My only complaint is the lack of comfortable seating (50% bar seats and they don't take reservation) and its non-competitive price tag (smaller portion than competitors but not cheaper, coffee is not refilled). Try to be there at opening (10am) to avoid lineup on sunny weekends. I ordered 3 dishes for 2 people:  a duck bun side-dish (doesn't taste the duck much with the sauce/herbs but it's filling), German ravioli (very authentic) and the pain perdu (small dessert-sized portion but well-executed) . Probably order 2 plates / person if you are very hungry."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"Yummm what a perfect brunch! I took a Viennese-via-Vancouverite friend who was sooooo delighted to discover some traditional German items on the menu. We ordered the German ravioli and the fried bread and cheese balls, and the green salad and the tartine (basically avocado toast, which annoys me on principle but this was great.) Honestly, literally everything was really great, especially the German goodies! Give them a try! Both of us, almost as soon as we walked in, said: ""Well, I'm going to come here all the time."" It's breezy and open and light and spacious and the baked goods up front looked glorious. Service was super kind and attentive. Prices are affordable and there are enough different kinds of things on the menu to share a bunch with a group and please all palates. There is beautiful local pottery and bags and plants for sale up front, and lots of bar and counter seating for the laptop warriors. The iced tea was the best I've ever had, and I can't wait to go back for a celebratory brunch with no work ahead of me to enjoy the super affordable and lovely sounding breakfast cocktails. Wonderful new find by the overpass, can't wait to go back!!"
/user_details?userid=EJ5ybtY1FqieuS22LHbT1w,Claire L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been here multiple times for weekday lunches.Tip: try to get there just a few minutes before noon, come much after and the place will be packed! Good for groups of 2-4, you'll sit either at the bar or small tables. Filled with a lot of young mom types, and classy mile end folks.Come on Friday lunch, and you can order from the brunch menu as well! Butterblume rotates their menu, but always has the same base concepts around their plates. A fav of mine is the Tartine, which is a thick home style bread, topped with a light cheese, a veggies, and some sort of meat. Think of it a bit like Avocado toast 2.0. Friends often like the German dumplings! Another good option would be to get a homemade soup and a few fun slides (rotating). I often will take the cauliflower cake or a fresh cheese. I love their baked goods, and couldn't make it out without one! If their chocolate chip cookies are an option....just take itIn my opinion, this place is definitely on the pricier end, but it is clear they have put thought into the ingredients, seasonality, and menu."
/user_details?userid=OoRdJV3YJEC64LnSsn3DTQ,Jessica L.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"This was the first restaurant I stepped foot in in Montreal, as it was recommended by two of my friends. However, I was highly disappointed. Mainly due to the service. But I can see why it has high ratings, it's a cute-hip place with a very modern vibe. A trendy place, but defs not an spot that had been around for long. People that i talked to and have lived in Montreal for over 20 years have never heard of the place. But let's start with the food and then I will talk about the service. The ingredients in the chickpea/peach/eggplant salad we ordered were fresh and flavours mixed well together. It was a good portion and you would get sick of it after a few bites so defs to share would be best. The ravioli was too heavy for me. It came with 3 thick pieces. Wish they made it a bit more delicate and small. Again, you get sick after a few bites. The broth wasn't light, very rich and flavourful. There wasn't much texture in the dish, the filling was just bland and green which wasn't very appealing. About the service, it was one of those places that did bare minimum. The staff wasn't friendly at all, to  not topping off our water, introducing the menu, or smiling. It's like those places, u can't exactly pinpoint one thing that they did horribly but it's like the feeling where you're trying to have a conversation with someone but you know they're really not feeling it. But this is a restaurant we're talking about! Bottomline, I did not feel welcomed at all. Not sure if it's the stuck up culture in Montreal but I was not impressed."
/user_details?userid=bnvTSAivpmnJgUlkhYKkSg,Vadim D.,"Belmont, MA",5 star rating,"An excellent place to visit for breakfast or brunch!  Occupies a former industrial bakery. Exposed brick walls, modern design, small tables, and counter seating. Freshly baked goods are on display for ether a to-go purchase or for indulging with a cup of freshly ground and brewed coffee. Menu is modern with familiar ingredients but with a twist. Very busy with young upscale professionals crowd. Cauliflower cake and mushroom tartine are amazing."

/user_details?userid=c7C5QziJbx6JOnQFiOxUXQ,Youri H.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Yelp should have a feature where, once a year, you get to rate a restaurant 6-stars. If possible, I'd return to this review annually and give my 6-star review to Le Butterblume. Here's the thing: most restaurants try their hands at brunch and many of them make it passable, but Butterblume brings brunch to a whole new level.It's fun, it's creative and most importantly, it's abso-fucking-lutely delicious. Every bite freezes time as the flavours dance around on your tongue like they're Jennifer Beals in Flashdance. The food transcends time and space. It's like the Doctor Who of the culinary world. I have nothing but good things to say about Butterblume, and while I didn't eat everything on the menu, here's a quick review of the stuff I did have:- Asparagus crepe: - Halloumi salad: - Beans with salmon jerky: - Fresh cheese:"

Very friendly and took the time to tell us that a table is almost ready to be leave, so we waited patiently. The place is cozy and clean. As for the food, another spectacular phenomenon! I dont really understand the vegan world and i ordered an Deustch raviolis (raviolis allemand). The taste is succulent and light. Very exquisite mesmerizing scent of herbs. Definitely coming back for more!"
/user_details?userid=muFEehJQ-NYC1WrIuow5GQ,David E.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Had my first experience at Butterblume today. I found out about it through Eater Montreal. We got there around 1:45 on a Saturday, the place was full so we had to wait around 25 minutes to get a table (for 5). The place is a restaurant, cafe and a boutique which is convenient in case you have to wait as you can get a coffee at the counter and take a look at the small boutique. The menu is very special and not traditional. They have a breakfast and lunch section as well as a small brunch one. The meals are unique, combining interesting ingredients together as well as different textures, and the tastes and flavors are really good. We had the Israeli couscous and salmon salad to share and I had the frittata with tuna for main dish. Both were excellent. The place is nicely decorated, with a lot of white and plants, it is spacious and the acoustic is good.Will definitely go back"

/user_details?userid=HcYrIElIZ5kckQpgDgnAJw,Anne K.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,Not just a plain avocado toast but with substance and actually worth the $12+! We also had the German ravioli which was perfect for a frigid day. Minus for the uncomfortable chairs and tables which are instagramable but impractical. Coffee was excellent. I had the apricot pistachio cookie which was also good. Overall happy I waited 30mkns for Sunday brunch!
/user_details?userid=8o5YaBnbnTJfjc7wpsiGUw,Kristie N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is by far my favourite brunch place!! I came around 10:30 (they open at 10) and the wait was already 15-20 mins. I got the bok choy, carrot, bacon cheese toast with a poached egg on top ($14). It's one of their usual items on their menu. For brunch, they change their menu weekly, so you're in for a surprise each time you go! I also shared their house made sourdough bread with homemade jam. It was so delicious. My friend and I both got lattes which were slightly cheaper than your usual latte for $3.50 rather than $4. The aesthetic is really nice, so be sure to take pictures. This place really reminded me of Olive and Gourmando because it's much more veggie based and they really use the most intricate combinations of food. The baked goods looked really good as well, but we were too full to get them."
/user_details?userid=0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,Cindy Feng Xin L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Wow I was so fascinated by this place when I saw terrific photos and ratings about this place, but I was let down much by the service. Hidden behind their menu is a line of small words saying no laptop in their café from 11 to 2, I had to move from a table to the counter despite ordering food. I was more offended when I had to tell the staff 20 times that I am cold sitting at the counter because they opened the door and the wind was blowing at me directly.I have to admit that the café is beautiful and full of vibrant colours due to many flower decorations. The coffee is okay, and I tried their been, caviar and salmon jerky salad, small portion but quite good. The price is quite high according to me because I find the quantity and quality were not extraordinary, but at least the taste is fresh and they have a variety of choices. The café can get quite crowded and they tend to ask customer alone to move to the counter (which is my case) because the capacity is limited. Try to avoid going there at peak hours (lunch time). The café is also closed fairly early, at 4PM, I find it a bit odd, but anyway it is not likely that I would return due to the bad service I received."

I visited on a Saturday afternoon, and the location was crowded, so we got tea, a cherry brownie, and a scone with butter and jam to go as a lil snack. The flavours of the sweets were not overbearing; they were nuanced and really tasty. The location itself is simplistic and beautiful, but the character shines through in the food, service, and rustic hand-written cafe sign. If you're in the area, it's worth a try!"

A big big labour of commitment, talent and love. .Thank you La Butterblume! My weekend is off to an extraordinarily satisfied start.

Popular as it was packed at 2pm with a long wait.Breakdown of 3/5 rating:-The menu is pretty small but with fresh ingredients-Ordered their only toast on the menu, cauliflower toast, pork bun, and muesli... recommend the cauliflower toast and toast (looks like it changes often)-They don't really have a good waitlist system. When we walked in, no one came up to ask how many, etc and there was a large number of people waiting. When the host/server started taking names, it wasn't in order of the line. She approached whoever was closest to her at the moment and jotted their names down on a post-it. Took about 30 minutes to seat the two of us.-Nothing too special and coffee wasn't amazing--- overall just meh."
/user_details?userid=wPT7Uxcn0IMxnPa7AM-NWg,Priscilla L.,"Salt Lake City, Salt Lake City, UT",5 star rating,"This is an awesome place for brunch! I would love to go back soon. They offer brunch from Friday through Sunday starting at 10AM. Located on St-Laurent street just before the underpass before arriving in Little Italy. The space is wide open with a lot of light and an open kitchen. They have a corner at the entry where they sell a few magazines and some flowers. We sat on the counter just in front of the chef teaching her assistant how to make the food. It was definitely interesting to see them make the food, and then hand it over fresh to us directly. I loved the experience. I started with a latte, pretty good but unfortunately too small for the price. I also had the savory pain perdu. It was a piece of bread with little pieces of bacon and cheddar in it, topped with a perfectly cooked poached egg, cheddar and super thin slices of radishes & carrots. My sister had the tartine, which is basically a big toast covered with zucchini cream, ricotta, poached egg, some greens and shaved duck jerky. It looked so good, I stole a couple of bites and it was as tasty as my dish. The service was excellent as well, all the staff was friendly and gave us warm smiles the entire time we were there. For those who are a bit in a rush, you can come grab a coffee to go and pick up one of their pastries to go from their take-out counter."

I went with a friend and ordered their house sourdough with apple-infused butter, deviled eggs with miso, and a cup of tea. Can't remember what my friend ordered, but his conclusions were the same as mine: Presentation was absolutely perfect, menu offerings were creative and unique, and everything tasted better than you'd have believed possible for a few relatively simple dishes at an affordable price (I think I paid about 13 CAD for the above, and I was full). Atmosphere is great. Had to wait about twenty minutes for a seat on a Saturday morning. Sat at the bar and loved watching the open kitchen at work. Will be sure to visit again if I ever make my way back to Montreal."

I'll be back. Second visit: had a delicious smoked avocado tartine with a poached egg on top and excellent bread from Butterblume's ovens underneath. Delicious."

The food is unique and delicious and it looks like they frequently have special items in addition to what's listed on their menu. Came here on a Sunday for the brunch, but looking forward to coming back during the week when it's more chill. Oh yea before I go - we had a lentil dish, chicken savory crepe, a side of bread and this butternut squash puree. Everything was super super tasty.

They carry Montreal brands, so extra points for supporting local! Butterblume has a charming interior that looks like it came out of a Pinterest account, which is very fitting for the Mile End scene. I came here for brunch and I've ordered the beets salad. It tasted amazing and looked incredibly pretty. Their cookies are also amazing, soft chewy and really rich. My sister ordered the roasted butternut squash, thyme, poached egg, pancetta & pumpkin seeds on bread, which is another flavourful dish. Bad: Too bad the portions were a bit small because I still felt hungry after eating. I was not a fan of the ravioli, maybe because it looked an oversize wonton. Bottom line: Definitely try it at least once. Maybe order a dish and another to share because the portions aren't exactly generous, but the food was so darn good!"

The bread is fresh from the oven to the table which is a great concept. The porc i had was delicious there was at least 5 different flavours and sauce. My bf had the pancake that bread looked very fluffy. The only reason i didn't gave a 5 stars is because they have absolutely zero gluten free choice so they had non consideration for celiac person like me and i find it very irresponsable as a restaurateur nowadays to not be able to accomodate custumers with allergies. The hostess did gave the option to have granola in yogourt but what's the point of coming to a place like this and order something i eat every morning. So i had to peel the bread crumb from my porc dish which was contaminated with gluten so i got sick. Not pleasant."

The fresh, market-based menu often includes poached egg on toast with different garnishes. The staff is incredibly friendly, valuing repeat customers such as myself. My only critique would be that there is slight inconsistency in portions like one day the toast will be smaller than usual and the next time, or at the next table, it will be a different size. This is, I think, to be expected, but a quirk that I've noticed a few times. The German dumplings are incredible as are the breakfast goods. Actually, I haven't had a bad dish. Enjoy!"

/user_details?userid=sOL82Hbfza89tKL6m_wBJA,Marie H V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I like everything about this place. It's bright, welcoming, friendly. Food is fresh, menu items are original and seasonal. Prices are quite decent for the quality and quantity. I had German ravioli and expected something small (as usual for ravioli) but there was a huge amount of delicious stuffing and I could barely finish my plate. It's at ground level, accessible for strollers. It's a bit out of the way, not really close to any metro station, and still really full at lunch time, which says a lot about how good of a place it is. So remember to get there early!"

/user_details?userid=gPutIn3JgUQyVBLOeilXEA,Louisa K.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",5 star rating,"I don't know what made two Quebec ladies call their restaurant 'Butterblume' but I am certainly happy they did, because it caught my (German) eye when walking past on the way to Mile End. Although I had just consumed a large ice cream cone in Little Italy, I had to step in. The cheerful waiter assured us it was absolutely fine to stay for just a drink. The homemade lemonade and the iced tea (I think it was made from Sanddorn=seaberry!) were both delightful but I wished I had some space in my belly to try their food. I could see from the menu and from dishes served at other tables that it was right up my street. Creative, healthy, and beautiful takes on classics. I'd prefer if they had some vegan dishes on the menu but I will be at least a vegetarian for a day to try their delicacies when I return. Butterblume is worth a visit, even if it's not on your route. Just want to grab a coffee and a pastry to go? The interior design of the restaurant, the cafe bar, and the little shop area in the front are all so lovely that even a short visit will make you as cheerful as the friendly waiter."
/user_details?userid=-KpEgEen1tj-jdjIS7uVOw,Isabelle R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Interesting location on St Laurent right before the underpass, melding the mile end and little Italy into one. I went in for breakfast on a weekday and it was already hustling and bustling with people.It's roomy and airy with friendly staff to greet you. The tables are small and all sort of centered in one area, a little squished but making you feel like you're in a busy French café. The coffees were good, a little small, but good. I ordered their housemade sourdough bread and their special tarragon/anchovy butter (4$) to go along, it was good- and a large portion. The menu hosts a small but appetizing breakfast menu (with a range of pricing and sizing) and I went with the (homemade!) yogourt and granola, with confit kumquats (7$)!- delicious to every last bite. I also tried, off their more extensive (and expensive) lunch menu, the smoked avocado toast with mushrooms and a poached egg (around 13$). It was crispy and soft and salty and tasty. I can't wait to try more off their menu.They also have a few little things for sale at the front, hosting the stylish new café-boutique trend, but they don't overdo it, either. Also, the pastries looked absolutely divine- cauliflower cake?? Can't wait to try it. They have a take-out counter so feel free to grab a latte and pastry to go!"
/user_details?userid=z8ckRjVaLQWAFaqKFwaodA,Emilie W.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"Delicious. Melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I ordered the salmon blini. It was good; I just wasn't used to the sweet aftertaste coming from the macadamia nuts. My sister ordered the ""pain brioché"" which was amazing, perfectly sweet.Very hipster décor, and the prices are reasonable (a little bit on the expensive side)."
/user_details?userid=Gdyzk0Bq4CMsp8onOsdsdA,Serge N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"First of all, you can't talk about butterblume without mentioning the decor and the staff. They display some real care in every details of the experience they offer, and that's what makes them so (deservedly) unique at first glance. But their menu is the real star of the of the show. I've been a longtime fan, visiting them at least once a month to check out new dishes. The selection leans on pillars of German cuisine (bread, sausage, rich sauces) but they manage to lighten them up with Scandinavian and Quebec influences using seasonal local fruits and vegetables. The result is simply great to stare at and addictive to the palet as everything seem to come together effortlessly no matter what you choose."
/user_details?userid=1hT5oewKWdp-RsZL4J0UfQ,Sarah D.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This breaks my heart to say, however, I've visited on three separate occasions to give this spot three fair tries and each time I leave, convinced, that they don't like English people. It hurts to say that especially because Mile End is a wonderful neighbourhood of both Quebecois and Anglophones/English-speaking people. The food is delicious, you'll leave smacking your lips, but the rude service trumps everything and makes for a place I don't want to support. People come first and the ownership of this spot needs a reminder."

On the morning we were scheduled to leave, we drove first to butterblume - and what a way to end our trip! We stumbled upon this place on google maps and the pictures looked terrific - we can now report that it was worth every penny and more! The food here is unbelievable - puts abc ktchen/clinton st. and many other ""go-to"" brunch places in nyc to shame! Gives 'farm -to-table' and 'made-with-love' a WHOLE NEW MEANING!The yogurt and jam was to die for, the berry french toast was unparalleled, we had tartines topped with zucchini, lemon, poached eggs, and sesame paste ...heavenly! A must try..."

Food was fresh,  light and exactly what we were looking for in a midday meal. The salad of the week was a bean salad with cured fish- so good! I had never quite had anything like it before. The flavors meshed perfectly. I also had a wonderful glass of rosé and my husband had the gin lemonade which was incredibly refreshing. Decor matched the food- light, airy, minimalist. Overall a lovely experience."
/user_details?userid=ndm9T1Q3XFAnvC8fIBQZSA,Hans C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"It was my first time in Le Butterblume. Regardless of my high expectations due to some positive comments from some friends and relatives, I end up a bit disappointed. I ordered a german ravioli, which was supposed to be one of its best dishes and it was not something breathtaking. Nevertheless, I think it is a pretty nice place to have a coffee and a dessert. Also, I think they have a really good service, and everybody has a really good attitude towards the customers."
/user_details?userid=GSG9d8WxU2XNd5odUw_U9Q,Alex P.,"Pittsburgh, PA",3 star rating,"Visited for brunch with friends. We were told there would be a 10-15 minute wait for a table which sounded reasonable, but it turned out to be more like 40 minutes. I ordered a sampler of various dishes, a miso creamy soup, pork bun and cheese toast with egg. Soup was kind of on the salty side. Pork bun was soaked in sour cream so much it killed the flavor. Toast was pretty good. I also ordered an eggnog with a hint of orange that was very good. Friends ordered ravioli, which came in some sort of broth which was very salty. Consensus was some dishes were too salty others were very good. Service was ok. For the long wait and the crowds we would have expected something much better. Good atmosphere for brunch. I would give it a second chance because half of the stuff we ordered was very good."

/user_details?userid=bCC9m7vuNKISQ-ckJ98fJQ,She H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"A beautiful and airy space that is  refreshing to walk into. The food is savory and definitely on the healthy side. We tried a pineapple and coconut crepes that had bits of meringue over it,as well as a pork belly english muffin. Our friends had the muesli and granola bowls topped with fresh fruits. We also tried the cauliflower cake (so-so) and the ""pieuvre saisie"" (would order again). Although each dish tasted good, I think we left a little disappointed because  we wanted more variety in each of our orders. We did try many different dishes overall, but the tastes didn't quite mix well together. Also, the tiny cups of lattes did not satisfy the coffee drinkers in our group and we had to stop at Starbucks on the way home. I would certainly go back and try some of the savory dishes, they looked really interesting for lunch."
