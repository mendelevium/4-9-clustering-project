Ordering was easy over the phone. They are all setup of safe pickup, you follow a flow of arrows to receive and pay for your order so you don't come in contact with other people. Went with just a simple margherita pizza and it was really good! We also ordered their brownie and chocolate sauce ice cream, which exceeded my expectations. The ice cream is delicious and the ratio of ice cream to brownies is generous is (1:1). Really great experience, support your local businesses!"
/user_details?userid=wWHeaOS28fnCnFN1Pmo3xg,Shaan A.,"Thornhill, Vaughan, Canada",4 star rating,"Situated on the corner of Parc and Sherbrooke is Moleskine, a quaint pizzeria with soaring ceilings and a causal flare. The place is bustling with conversation, old music tunes, and the aroma of amazing thin crust pizzas. The server immediately sat me and my friend near the kitchen bar stool - the seating is very limited but the place was packed. It was really cool to see the kitchen staff working away at rapid speed preparing pizzas so perfectly. I decided on a classic margherita pizza. A few short minutes later the pizza arrived piping hot. The charcoal bubbles were still oozing and the fresh fior di latte cheese was lightly melting on the hot crust. There was also fresh basil added which was a nice touch. The waitress also brought over some chilli oil, which was a nice addition to the pizza. The pizza had a nice thin crust - and a nice balance of ingredients that was fresh and satisfying. A perfect spot for a margherita pizza - I will definitely return."

I was so happy I chose to bring Mom to Moleskine!We moseyed in and got seated close to the warm first pizza oven right away by the super kind and friendly staff. Everyone was chatty and accommodating and the vibe was lovely. I'd come back here on a date for sure, or with a friend, the lighting layout and decor were all welcoming and beautifully done and we loved listening to the old vinyl records while we waited for our food. And the food was great. I think you could have quite a fancy pricey meal here, but we just had a pizza each, thin and with awesome quality toppings and big enough for a couple slices of leftovers each. My mushroom and truffle oil pizza was heaven, and Mom loved her vegetarian so much she ordered another to bring to my sister. I have to admit, I think I subconsciously avoided this place because I find the name deeply unappetizing. I'm really glad I looked past it and got to have this lovely friendly delicious experience with my Mom."

We sat downstairs in the center seating area, and it was incredibly awkward to get into the center seats. You are literally climbing over other people. To get out, I ended up crawling under the table! Menu had several pizzas, so maybe we just ordered the wrong ones. Carbonara pizza was soggy in the middle. The Verdura was downright soupy. The pizza delivered next to us looked good, so I hope I just ordered badly. It seemed like a good idea at the time, and like I said, the service was friendly, but the food was not great."
/user_details?userid=epyaaMECqFyTzDY_4B7rIQ,Beril E.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"After looking up the most trendy restaurants to visit in Montréal, I had high expectations of this place. After my fabulous experience at Rubirosa Ristorante in NYC, I have acquired a fascination toward small restaurants with craft Italian thin crust pizzas and I thought this was going to be one of them.Moleskine definitely is small. With a few table and mostly bar seating options available, parties larger than four will definitely need some luck to sit with each other for dinner. The restaurant seemed to be pretty empty at around 6pm, right after they opened, which could be a prime time to visit to ensure immediate seating.I found the concept of paper underneath our plates and pencil to write on the paper to be cute. It reminded me of a game I used to play as a child connecting the dots with my mom. Helped the time go by fast. Since the place was empty at 6, we ordered pretty quickly. Our pizza of choice was Salsiccia which had tomato sauce, sausage, arugula, peppers, fior di latte, and grana padano cheese sprinkled on top. Considering the price of the pizza, we were expecting a large thin crust pizza for two, but what came instead was a tiny pizza that could have easily been consumed by a 10 year-old child. The tomato sauce made the thin crust pizza so soggy that the pizza was falling apart in our hands and upon consumption of one slice each, we looked like babies who got their food all over their hands and faces. The sausage pieces were few and far in between and the rest of the ingredients were just meh. With empty stomachs, instead of preparing for another disappointment with yet another pizza, we decided to save our 20 bucks and feed ourselves elsewhere. Despite the emptiness of the space, the waitress was quick to offer us our check upon our informing her of our decision not to get another pizza. I found such service a bit sloppy."

Well this was exactly what we experienced at Moleskine! My cousin came into town so we decided to try this out and it was exactly what we needed to have our intimate conversation. It's really cozy there. If you have personal space issues then this may not be for you BUT it is worth a try. It's a bit pricey but for a cute date night, it should be on your list. The food was delicious! Honestly it was a 5- star service. We sat right next to the kitchen (open space) and we not only got to experience the food and flavor, but we also got to experience and witness The chefs in their natural element and it was both a beautiful symphony and a lovely moment. Get prepared to spend a few hours eating good, talking and enjoying the time with your company because this place it"
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",3 star rating,"I gave this place a try for dinner , definitely make reservations ! I have some mixed feelings about this place. The hostess was inattentive and seemed lost and in her own world BUT the server we had was very friendly & did a great job. the downstairs portion of the restaurant was more casual and quite nosy and cramped , the upstairs was a little more chic and definitely a better choice to be able to have a conversation. The decor overall is nice , rustic chic. The prices were okay pretty much on par with most other similar pizza places. we ordered the baked olives to share which were actually the standout part of the meal , they were baked with mushrooms olive oil and fresh herbs and honestly were pretty unique and delicious ! We ordered two pizzas they were decent but not mind blowing or anything out of the ordinary. The crust is very thin , the toppings tasted good but they were very stingy with them,there wasn't much other than cheese so this caused the pizza to lack in flavour on most bites and for us to leave still kind of hungry. Not a bad experience at all BUT I also can't say this would be my first choice in the city for wood oven pizza !"
/user_details?userid=wJF-NdtxYCk_SrwG4UUL9Q,Stephanie L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The appearance of the restaurant is what first got me interested in trying it out. I had walked by many times, the window sill is always lined with fresh basil and rosemary. There are two levels in the restaurant: the downstairs which serves more casual fare, and the upstairs which is fancier and more expensive. I have only tried the downstairs pizzeria. They serve authentic thin crust Italian pizza. They had some interesting special pizzas that night, I opted to try the carbonara pizza. As you can imagine it was quite tasty, and even topped with a poached egg. It would be nice if they included two eggs next time! I loved having the yolk run on the pizza. Now, the pizza can be a little expensive averaging $18-$20, which is a lot. Thus, you should it, but it's not for every day."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",3 star rating,"Finally got to try this place on their official day open I believe. The decor stays a five star. It's a beautiful restaurant. It's cool and trendy. It utilizes the space perfectly. The seating is comfortable. But I will ultimately give this place a 3. The food is delicious but the service was a bit rusty. Which makes sense because this was their opening. The cons:Someone who came in after us got served before. There were no napkins on the tables. They forgot to punch in our order so our food took a little too long to get here. I felt like they overlooked us because we looked younger than other people there. I don't like that they judged us so quick. They basically dismissed us. The food:I ordered the frittata and my boyfriend ordered a pizza. The portions were small for the price and we ended up having to go somewhere else because we were still hungry. The frittata was lovely though. Really tasty and fun to eat. There was a side salad and it was good except the dressing was a bit too sharp and sour for me. The pizza dough is perfect. And all the flavours work together. You can tell it was made with care and attention. It was fresh. Overall, an ok experience. The staff was nice and it's not a bad place to eat and talk."

Service was excellent when I went, just a bit disappointed with the sixe of the gnocchis plate; very small for $21, like an appetizer. Go w the pizza hands down :-) They also have amazing wines. Will be back!"
/user_details?userid=YShl0mH9xxAGGTEp0Hx2BA,Carcharhinus L.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4 star rating,Ricotta gnocchis with sage pine nuts and beurre was beyond compare.

/user_details?userid=zRU14XA_RLElgqp-9SqLAg,Barry E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been here twice for dinner (upstairs) and once for brunch, and I can say that it is one of my favourite Montreal restaurants, especially in the Downtown/McGill area. The cuisine is both creative and delicious, not to mention beautifully plated.As is usually the case with such restaurants, the menu changes constantly to reflect what is fresh and in season. Regardless of when you go though, you can rest assured that the food will be delicious.For my most recent visit, which was for brunch, I had the crab and shrimp omelette with béarnaise sauce, which was absolutely decadent. They also inadvertently served me the mushroom and spring peas omelette, of which I had a bite, and it too was bursting with fresh spring flavors. Both were prepared with exquisite care. These were not your garden variety omelettes.The ambiance here is very relaxed and casual, and the servers are very helpful in explaining everything on the menu."

Only downside is the slow service! The staff is knowledgeable and polite but it took a while (both times we went) to get rid of our empty plates and be giving the bill.

/user_details?userid=3gGo8mT2yozLprrIv9stEg,Talia F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Small, cosy, intimate atmosphere. Friendly, helpful service. Good for 2 people as it's mostly bar style seating, a few tables for more. Wouldn't go as a large group. Delicious, well dressed and interesting salads. I LOVED our pizza - various mushroom and truffle. It was perfect; great thin crust, evenly and generously distributed toppings, great flavour. Loved the tastes, loved the vibes and will go back for sure. For 2 salads, a pizza and a fresh mint tea is was $70 with tax & tip; which I thought was a little on the pricey side but it wouldn't stop me from going again. Probably something to do with the location...so that's where the star is docked. I also cannot comment on the pizzas with tomato sauce - as ours didn't come with any - I'd be interested to know if it made the base soggy...next time. Overall, a big big thumbs up from me."

Pizza is my favorite dish so you can understand why I was so excited to try this place. Plus the reviews on yelp are so good that my expectations were high. It definitely did not live up to my expectations. My aunt and I shared the pizza of the day and the Mornay. The pizza of the day had corn and chorizo. The Mornay had mushrooms and cheese. First of all the pizzas were not very warm. Also we sat next to the window and it was so cold. Second, the pizzas were super thin! I like thin crust pizza but this was almost too thin. Third, its not cheap! It is not worth the $18-$19 that we paid. If you want thin crust wood fire pizza go to il focolaio!! It's the best!"

For a price of 22$ per pizza, I was expecting better. I had the culatello pizza, which was very flavourful but the use of hazelnuts on it just made it taste like nutella during some bites. Very cute decor though!"
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"There used to be an old family-style Greek restaurant where Moleskine now stands. When the new owners moved in, they transformed the slightly tacky interior into an aerated, modern space with an industrial feel. Some details from the past remain: the original blue door, rough cement floor and parts of the ceiling/walls.  We went to Moleskine early on a Friday evening. The restaurant was still empty, and from the front windows came a light breeze, mixing agreably with the subtle smell of wood fire. We shared an entrée (grilled zucchini salad with lemon and crushed pistachios), and each ordered a pizza (margherita and chanterelles/prosciutto). We were fooling around with the funny pencil dangling from the ceiling when the food came. The zucchini salad was like a summer dream. The lemon and pesto made it fresh and vibrant, the zucchinis were on the verge of being raw, and the ricotta added richness and density. The portion was relatively small, but left our tastebuds satisfied. The pizzas were served one after we finished the other, starting with the margherita. I hadn't asked for this, and was initially surprised we would not be served at the same time. Perhaps they knew that we would share? Anyways, it worked out great for us. Speaking of the pizzas, they were pretty much everything you could hope for. The margherita made the most of its simplicity. Although thin, the dough remained crispy at the bottom and delightfully moist on top. The second pizza was in my opinion even better than the first. It had the classic Italian combination of chanterelles and prosciutto, where the fattiness of the meat was counterbalanced by the fava beans, green peas and mint. Goat cheese was added on top of it all. After such a great meal, we sat for awhile at the windows of the restaurant, thinking that our neighbourhood was definitively getting better and better. Moleskine's first floor reminded me of Pizzeria No. 900, which I tried last week. Both places have a fancy pizza oven and are in the same price range, but I think that Moleskine's food is just that tad better - not only are the products amazing, the flavor combinations are bolder and better thought-out. Can't wait to try their other goods!"

We were a little apprehensive when we walked in as it was a very eclectic vibe. We soon took in the vibe and found it also creative, interesting and fun. Lobster Forzetti was fabulous with shaved fennel, pancetta  and delightful sauce with big chunks of lobster.The lamb was prepared three ways and again the sauces were absolutely fabulous.We noticed the individual preparing salads was not wearing gloves and at one point took a handful of nuts he was chopping, ate them, then proceeded to plate a salad using the same hand.  This didn't sit well with us. Otherwise, highly recommend."

I liked the pizza, but it definitely is not the best in Montreal, especially for the price. That being said, it was pretty good quality and the wine list is good. The room and the atmosphere are casual, with good energy. Although I would recommend Moleskine for a casual dinner with some friends, it would not be at the top of my list."

I had an amazing cocktail while waiting for my pizza pie, and got to people watch while sitting at the (downstairs) window bar. The ambiance of the whole place is great  - dark and modern, with neat functional decor (the pencils)! Everyone was really friendly and helpful. The pizza itself is the reason for only 4 stars - while it was tasty, I was unable to eat it like a real pizza. Each time I tried to pick up a slice, the toppings would just slough off because the crust was so wet/weak. Still delicious when eaten with a fork, but less satisfying as pizza. I would visit again if in the area!"

Sit at the little bar at the back so you can see the chefs work.  The entries are usually really good too, the root vegetable salad is exquisite. We usually get the gravlax too (4th time ordering it last night) but the one we had last didn't seem fresh and less work was put into presentation (half the ingredients missing) perhaps because McGill is on study break and we were one of the three couples dining in the restaurant that night.

Pizza is awesome.   Parfait is something you want to try.So we went back for dinner.  I am posting some picture here.  4 type of pork on the same dish and beef with nice puree and foie gras.  Amazing.

But let's start with the entrées.  Took a tataki de bison which was really good. It had cheese, tomatoes and nuts with it and it was a perfect combination. We took 3 pizzas: an American (lobster), a mushroom (with truffle oil) and a piccante (spicy sausage). They were all good but the mushroom one was simply incredible. The truffle oil on the pizza was just the perfect quantity for a great taste. My second choice was the American one. In addition to the lobster, there's some horseradish that adds a little taste. The piccante was good but a spicy one is something you can have elsewhere.  We were three and in addition to the food listed here,  had a beere (total of 3) and took a wine bottle and it came to 145l4 with the tax. Average of 50$ per person with alcohol, which is reasonable. I will be going back for sure."

It comes with a salad which to be frank was just okay, and the portion was tiny, but when the pizza came I totally got why. it's because youre gonna wanna stuff it all in your face. Service was a little too slow but they were also really busy. Big groups are a little harder to accommodate because the space is tight, but they managed to fit two big groups in there when I went.

/user_details?userid=psMZ4hXAvsWdGo7lIW6GAA,Cathy D.,"Center City, MN",5 star rating,"I would add more stars if I could - this was beyond a 5 star experience!Charles (our exceptional server) really created an absolutely memorable dining experience!You could just say this is a high end pizza place but embrace a culinary experience here and don't let the brief menu here deter you - portions are small and this place is best enjoyed tapas style starting with a few appetizers (yes a few even if you are dining alone or as a couple and ask for them one at a time) - if you come with friends just order one of each of the appetizers and have them serve in sequence you will each get one amazing bite that will leave you craving more. Start with the amazingly delicious zucchini salad with ricotta and pistachios with a delectable (perhaps shallot?)  infused vinengarette.  Certainly one of my favorite dishes of the night - not to be missed. Next the sashimi style sea trout (kinda like salmon) (just 3 pieces or so)   delivers some interesting contrasts within the dish  that includes grapefruit and an absolutely delicious marinated grated fennel. Then a absolute must try is the beef appetizer  - it's very very finely sliced carpaccio style beef with a wonderful high grade parmesan and nuts with a balsamic reduction. Charles recommended a wonderful light but peppery French red that for the quality and taste was refreshingly inexpensive ($45 bottle). It was absolutely wonderful pairing with the food!!We then had a simple margarite pizza - usually I like more ingredients on my pizza but Charles recommended this simple pizza as a end to the main meal because of its simplicity and it was a perfect call. Light delicious tomato sauce, high quality cheese and a very thin and wonderfully artisanal crust. Don't miss the dessert here - order the chocolate flourless offering - again a culinary masterpiece of flavor and textures - a perfect ending to a perfect evening!!"

We tried 3 different pizzas and they were excellent. Some weren't sliced all the way through so we had to use a knife but no big deal. The pizza cook with the black spitfire hat kept touching his nose and then touching the food which was strange."

Tomato sauce is phenomenal- great combination of sweetness and acidity. Pizzas are baked well in a beautiful looking oven. Attentive service. Price is higher than average and only critique would be that the pizza bottom was slightly soggy- may just be a matter of preference. Otherwise would highly recommend."

Unfortunately, the food is unremarkable. My tomato soup tasted as though it had come out of a can. The beet salad with chèvre sounded promising, but the taste was elusive (and very small). And everything came very slowly. A disappointing experience, especially at the price."
/user_details?userid=WmxFALsBaamF8XhlACh9ow,S T.,"Baltimore, MD",1 star rating,Rude service and uncomfortable seating. Decided to give it a chance and have a glass of wine regardless and unfortunately the selection was limited. Would not recommend this place.
/user_details?userid=EEY-yKOnWOCDVpXuT1s_aw,Mel R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,This place is a gem hidden on Avenue du Parc. The service is amazig with always a smile. Whatever I ate either upstairs or downstairs I never said a bad wprd about it. They always find a way to surprise their clients through new taste explorations. The wines are great since the owner is also the owner of a wine bar next door. You should definitely try the cocktails and the juice of the days. In everything you see the reflection of the hardwork of a team and dedicated manager. I would definitely recommend more the upstairs since there are more selections
