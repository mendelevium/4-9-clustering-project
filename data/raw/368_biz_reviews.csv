It's hidden INSIDE the Kanda restaurant near the Namur metro station. The food is so authentic and flavorful. Plus, there's lots to choose from on the menu. The quality and quantity are excellent and its perfect for large groups. I personally love their egg noodles, lobster, clams and mushroom garlic beef. But all the dishes are amazing. You'll be so full and STILL have leftovers for the next day. I definitely recommend this place - it's so worth it."

Very good for groups, we were 30 people who came for our work holiday party. They take reservations but will ask for a deposit if you want to have a menu set before hand. Also to note, they are BYOB and let us bring our own cake without extra charge!Places like this make me so excited, as soon as I see the big tables and the lazy Susan in the middle I know it will be great food and they did not disappoint. We ordered about 1 dish/person and it was more than enough. My favourites were the green beans with pork, crispy tofu, ginger and shallot lobster and the eggplant stuffed with shrimp. The only underwhelming dish was the fried rice which I would have skipped on. They had a lot of options on their menu including more adventurous dishes (shrimp wrapped in pork intestine?) that we didn't end of trying.My only criticism is that half of the menu is not in English, making it quite hard if you do not speak mandarin or Vietnamese. Also, although the service was great when we reserved and the dishes came out for all 3 tables at the same time, they had trouble providing water for everyone (I did not have one glass all night) and we had to ask multiple times for extra cutlery as they did not provide enough to begin with."

There may be an English menu but I've never seen one; the main one they use is a Mandarin & Vietnamese one. Super authentic Chinese food, very extensive menu, lots of fresh seafood selections. Great bang for your buck as well - we came as a party of 8 and ordered a ton of food including lobster and beef and fish, and the bill came to 185$ (taxes and tips not included). Portions are huge and we even had leftovers. They provide complimentary starter soup and dessert soup. It's in a super convenient location too, right next to Namur metro station."

It's actually a chinese restaurant inside the Kanda sushi on Décarie Boulevard. You literally have to go inside Kanda in order to reach this restaurant that is located in the basement of the building... I know...it's a bit weird...Food was good, very flavourful. Many choices of fresh seafood! However, after the meal, I noticed that my mouth was very dry... probably due to the amount of MSG and salt in the dishes. But which chinese restaurant don't use that eh... They have many dishes that aren't offered in other chinese restaurants. But beware of its price, a bit more expensive than typical chinese restaurants."
