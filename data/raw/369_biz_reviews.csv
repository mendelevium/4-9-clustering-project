I ate there all the time as a student at Concordia.When I was not in the mood for a bánh mì, here are some other items I tried and recommend from Miss Bánh Mì:- Bún bò la lốt chả giò: Rice noodles with an eggroll and beef wrapped in lolot leaves (Rolled Grilled Beef, Imperial roll & Vermicelli on the menu)- Bánh dày: Glutinous rice flour patties with a wedge of Vietnamese sausage in between. These are commonly eaten during the Viet New Year and might not be sold again until then.- Mango smoothie with lychee jelly: So refreshing to drink with the savoury food!"
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,What a pleasant surprise this place was. My boyfriend always eats here but since I'm more on the picky side I always pass. I've been passing for no reason at all this place is great ! The beef is what I would go with over the bbq chicken only because the beef seems to be better prepared with the toppings. They put enough veggies and sauce but if you're like me you'll wanna ask for more veggies makes the sandwich a lot better. We ordered just before closing and the lady who worked there didn't have a problem throwing together two sandwiches made with love. She was a pleasant lady and she made a killer sandwich.I can't wait until we need our next fix of this place.
/user_details?userid=GQGvCTi2SvL9U_d3fsm9Tw,Stan C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"On an icy-sidewalk Wednesday in January and following the advice from YELP (that was further corroborated by a colleague) I decided to take the metro all the way from Guy (De Maisonneuve) to Guy (St Mathieu) to lunch at Miss Báhn Mì. What great ideas these were! I had a great lunch, and by walking underground the length of the subway station I did not put my limbs in danger by risking the treacherous sidewalks. I chose the Bàhn Mì combo that came with a soup (wonton or Tom Yum) and a soft drink that set me back less than $10.00I was happy from the first slurp of wonton soup to the last bite of the sandwich. Other than being excellent the soup had an unexpected depth to it; a roundness that I haven't encountered before. The wontons therein were perfectly sized and filled with what I thought was a shrimp and pork filling. The gossamer wings of the wonton beckoned  from the broth, I was mesmerized.The Bàhn Mì was also delicious. The demi-baguette's soft and inviting crumb was loaded with the traditional meats and veg, along with a dash of unctuous sauce. The crust of the bread exploded like New Year's Eve Fireworks with every bite.  If you're lucky you can experience all this while taking in the St Mathieu street goings on. A window-facing counter has you looking down towards the pedestrians and the Fire Station. Sometimes there are big shiny red trucks, sometimes, there aren't. Due to the characteristic of the bread's crust I cannot recommend that you eat this sandwich over your keyboard. (Photo to follow)"

I hate when the bread is hard, it ruins the taste of the sandwich for me. The meat is also always tender and flavorful. My favorite so far is the pork banh mi sandwich. The sandwiches are also really cheap and cost less than most (of not all) the other banh mi places in the area. They also offer other meals but I unfortunately haven't had the chance to try them yet."
/user_details?userid=Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Probably the one of the best banh mi sandwiches I've had yet! The bread is crusty without being hard enough to cut up your palette, and soft on the inside. The traditional contained a classic mix of cold-cuts and pates, with the required pickled carrot and daikon, cucumber, as well as cilantro, and it can be made spicy if you like. They also use a mayonnaise that is not just your average condiment...it really makes the sandwich. I regret not getting something else to try because they have some soups and rice dishes on the menu too, along with a few desserts in the refrigerated case."
/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"Shared a banh mi with my mom from Miss Banh Mi.  We got the Classic Banh Mi ($4.25).  It's the one with all the meats, but without the chicken crumble.  Overall, the taste was ok, but far from authentic.I feel that the bahn mi here have been tweaked to accommodate Western tastes.  The ""mayo"" which is traditionally made with raw egg yolk and oil, tasted more like Western mayonnaise here.  It had a sour tang to it, which was unusual.  My mom said that the meats tasted like meats you can get at Loblaws and lacked the true Vietnamese flavour of an authentic banh mi.  I also felt they were a bit stingy with the meats.  Service was not overly friendly.I'm not faulting them for the Westernization of the Banh Mi.  Businesses have to make what sells and accommodate their customers.  Authentic banh mi usually contains a cold cut that resembles head cheese, which I run away screaming from, so I always welcome the omission of this ingredient, lol.  I knocked stars off for the lack of meat and unfriendly service.  They had some Vietnamese desserts in their fridge that looked promising, but they didn't have the Che Ba Mau (three coloured dessert), which is my favourite, so I passed.  My mom was going to get a flan, but the tops looked all dried out.They had some traditional Vietnamese outfits on display and pictures of women in Vietnamese dress, but other than that the decor and feel was that of a regular café.  Not a criticism, just an observation.  It was super clean and well lit, which I liked."
/user_details?userid=5HiO4RFBVtAc7EY6w2mmRg,Vanessa V.,"Côte Saint-Luc, Canada",5 star rating,Delicious vietnamese sandwich. We had the spring rolls with the grilled pork sandwich and it was so so good. Good price and very clean. The service was also very friendly!
/user_details?userid=muQTqjUNqLyXtMSdm3j_Tg,Ben N.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"I'm not from Montreal, but was attending a show at the Bell Centre. Was looking for something within walking distance that was not fast food, so I decided on this place.The inside was clean, looked modern but did not see wheelchair accessibility. There was only one other person inside, so didn't take long to order and get my sub. There was a water jug with cups for drinking.Went with the traditional sub. Thought it was pretty good, the bread was warm, soft and not hard enough to destroy the roof of your mouth. The toppings tasted fresh and I was happy with it.I personally have my favourite banh mi location closer to home that is cheaper and more accustomed to the toppings and bread texture. But if your in Montreal and in the downtown area, why not give this place a try!"
/user_details?userid=c-dchuYjRCwJVstIE5KnMQ,Mary V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Love this place! I searched the area as I was craving banh mi for quite some time. Thanks to fellow Yelpers, this spot popped up in my search. It's across from Guy metro which was very convenient. When I went there was no one in line so I ordered 3x banh mi to go - spicy beef, tofu and grilled pork. They are generous with the cilantro. The prices are very affordable especially if you are on a budget. Each banh mi is under $5 and you can upgrade for a trio which gets you soup and spring roll. Everytime I'm in this neighborhood, I make sure to get a banh mi from here. Definitely recommend this place."
/user_details?userid=QCQ19_QoFMn1vz1m0fj9IA,Barry W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I don't live in Montreal anymore, but damned does this place make me regret leaving. Crispy, flaky baguette filled with just the right balance of ingredients. Reading other reviews, I see some light criticisms, but I'll say I have no problem with the service (is it super-friendly? no. do I want super-personalized and warm service when I'm ordering a $5 sandwich? also no), authenticity (a ridiculous complaint when the food itself is a classic fusion dish, like complaining about the authenticity of Japanese curry), or the price (it's worth it for the fantastic bread alone).That said, beware: ""spicy"" does indeed mean ""chopped-up chili."" My partner loves it, but I just go without, myself."
/user_details?userid=ixOhxP1OAorcDMNlHuHuwA,Sindy T.,"Diamond Bar, CA",4 star rating,"Cute little spot, wonton soup was good and the beef noodle salad was delicious. Had a special banh mi to go and it was a bit on the salty side but the bread was yumm.. nice customer service"
/user_details?userid=Tt935I9HxMum6PiEGx7MSg,Eric E.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Exceptional bahn mi, small portions but fresh ingredients. My experience was tainted by weirdly cold service and a pixelated menu. Maybe I'm being picky but the blasted club hits and feeling out of place reminds me of more poorly navigated nights in my early twenties.Good spice levels when u ask for heat tho."
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"So this review is from m my second time visiting this place. First time was about 5 days ago and tell you the truth, i enjoyed it a lot! But today wasn't as good. Last time, everything was super tasty and the bread had a crunchy crust with a soft pillowy inside. This time, the sandwich tasted like any other Vietnamese sandwiches. A little bit pricier and on the smaller portion then the other banh mi joints, i am willing to pay more but I also expect it to be better. I didn't get as much meats like I did before and could barely taste any mayo. The prices went up as well. Five days ago, I paid 5,25$ for the special banh mi and today it was 5,75$ even though the price displayed is still at 5,25$. I asked if they give out fidelity cards to which the lady simply told me that they ran out and simply haven't had more printed out. That's too bad. I don't think I'll be coming back since I have a banh mi place really close to where I work. I had to get out of my way to buy their banh mi and quite frankly I don't think it's worth the detour anymore. Service could use some improvements as well. Ah well..."
/user_details?userid=c9xBCAAiE5v_2CVEA5YXQw,John S.,"NEPEAN, Canada",4 star rating,"There's a lot great about their Banh Mi. A great Banh Mi starts with the bread and theirs is fantastic.   I had the Traditional and the taste was excellent.   Pate and 4 different sliced meats.  The lost star was because there was not enough meat.  Although there are four types, they slice the meat as thin as possible and only one micro layer of each.   If it fills you up it's going to be because of the bun but not the meat."
/user_details?userid=jaTBzvwG6WxT9NTk4tN6Dw,Sarah S.,"Raleigh, NC",5 star rating,The cheapest Vietnamese food that actually tastes good and serves a lot of food. Highly recommend this place!
/user_details?userid=BwpuHkxY-1yzVTteP-AXPQ,Conner M.,"Verdun, Canada",5 star rating,"I really like this place. They serve a delicious version of the beef & carrot stew I love and it's why I go back whenever I'm in the area. Really great for winter, that stew. Shamefully I have not tried the sandwiches because I always get the bo kho. The decor is nice inside--the kind of place where I'd be happy to have my lunch instead of taking it away because the ambience is nonexistent. The employees are super friendly."

/user_details?userid=_b6u_JPQU3TwG4vQdCO23A,Roland F.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"Food: 5/5Service: 4/5Environment: 4/5Total (13/15; 4.33/5)Affordable, homely, absolutely delicious- they make fresh banh mi that's filling and fresh that's really similar to Banh MI Boys in Toronto. The banh mi was filled with meat and veggies on a toasted crispy bun. Their wonton soup on the side is great too - a salty warm soup that just compliments their banh mi so well.  Definitely coming back!"
/user_details?userid=Zpdth_SlQ3uEzpLbhwXWQw,Timothy N.,"Westford, MA",4 star rating,"Nice location just up a small flight of stairs with some nice seating overlooking the street. The traditional bahn mi was among the best I've had and easily the best I've had on the East coast. Lemongrass beef with vermicelli noodles, with its ample portions and perfectly seasoned beef, is also highly recommended. The service was cool but pleasant overall."

/user_details?userid=WgdozIRyj5St8VQ9it-j5A,Stuart A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"To be fair, I've only had homemade bahn mi other than this place. But I have to say this is really tasty and super cheap. I usually get the vege sandwich spicy.Be warned, spicy means that she will cut a chili into the sandwich. Not a complaint, just know that some bites will be very hot."
/user_details?userid=Y_idl1lNKpDJf01mdaR96Q,Lee H.,"Saint-Léonard, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Very beautiful and cozy place with a warm ambiance. Their banh mi is good and simple without the fuss unlike other places in the area. You want a banh mi that is close to ones found in the street of vietnam? Then, this's the best place around Guy Concordia area."

/user_details?userid=z-zbQG6l9pwzkcbfsXAgpQ,Jose S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,I went in the other day to find out the banh mi subs were smaller than before. I don't think I'll be going as often any more. Bring back the regular size.
/user_details?userid=oT2z1bXNww1I272YAlhDVA,jennifer J.,"Knowlton, Canada",5 star rating,I was seriously jonesing for some Thai food so I turned to Yelp. I came across this spot and was motivated by the positive reviews. Yelp comes to the rescue again. I did take out I had the chicken Pad Thai and the Imperial roll. Both were fresh and delicious. I'm now extremely excited to have a new go to Thai restaurant when I really need that Thai fix. Bonus the kitchen was clean and the lady at the counter was very friendly which is always nice given that often you come across establishments where customer service can be a little lacking.
