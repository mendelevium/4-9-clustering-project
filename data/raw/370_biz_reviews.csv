/user_details?userid=MnYfi2DODiZkLIwJFuwB2g,Bill Z.,"Hyde Park, NY",5 star rating,"I sometimes wonder whether a restaurant that provides dishes of a variety of backgrounds will get them all right. That certainly wasn't a concern at Om. I have no idea just how authentic their dishes are or aren't - I'll let others discuss that - my group certainly enjoyed everything we ordered. And it was a very diverse group, from 3 provinces, 2 states, and backgrounds from several additional countries. The staff easily toggled back and forth between our convoluted orders, questions, and banter in both English and French, without missing a beat in the conversation or service. Be sure to check the daily special menu, as we did, and ordered from it a combination platter for two, their Table D'hote (photo provided). We opted for the samosas, Sha ka tsa and 8 momos, 2 of each. Everything had great flavor, though I wonder if the sha ka tsa was a bit milder than usual for us. The meals also come with rice and in some cases a small salad. For our special, dessert was a single gulab jumun each, still warm, in a syrup that was not sickeningly sweet with a definite rosewater presence - so much tastier than to what I'm accustomed on Indian buffets at home. This whole experience was worldly wonderful both in the company and dining."

We placed an order for pickup. Met the sweet owner of the restaurant, when I went to pickup the food. So we tried the vegetarian noodles, veg and chicken momos, and chilli chicken. And they gave us complimentary lentil soup. The noodles were average, and so was the chilli chicken. The momos (both types) and the soup were delicious! My main intention for going to this place was the momos, and I was quite impressed. Really happy to have found this place."
/user_details?userid=YUlBxBTPMPM3mawg4Opuvw,Haque I.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We went there yesterday for a friend's farewell party and we loved our time there. The owner and waiters were super friendly and ensured we had a great time! The food was marvelous. We had pretty much everything (well not literally) lamb curry, beef curry, butter chicken, alo gobi, palak tofu, spicy tofu, cheese momo and finally salty butter tea. Their special bread was so awesome that ended up having 3 of those ( I know too much carb but couldn't check myself :( ) my most favorite was the lamb curry (spicy). We initially asked for ""very spicy"" one and then realized it was too spicy even for us (we all were from Bangladesh/India, so we were over confident :p ). So in our next order (once we were done with initial batch of orders) we asked for just ""spicy"" and that went well for all of us. The waiter laughed off saying, "" so you guys have upper limit as well""  Also he chatted briefly with us asking where we are from and also provided tips on how to survive Montreal winter :) As a whole it was a lovely evening and would definitely go back"
/user_details?userid=Jtj2jbYVaHjj9McHRuUNDA,Anne K.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"We were a table of 6 and had absolutely the worst meal in a long time. The restaurant was empty except for a couple at another table, still the service was slow and we had to wait a long time for everything. The main course meal arrived separately it took forever and the food was cold.As entrees the Pakoras looked like flat chip shapes of vegetable tempura ... and greasy these did not look like Pakoras in other restaurants. Ordered the butter chicken and it was below the caliber of a store bought sauce, the portions were small. Aloo Gobi was runny and had all of 3 small slices of tofu swimming in the watery sauce (some pieces were broken )in a sauce that lacked spinach in a spinach dish with tofu. Horrible! The owner brought a second version but only after I mentioned the issues. The last straw was 2 hairs in one of the main dishes. Not going back here it was very expensive on top of it. Big disappointment there is better out there. Giving 1 star to post but would put none if possible."

Definitely coming back if in Montreal.We had ""ThenThuk"" as appetizer, which was amazing. The entrees were good as well, just felt like the use of Turmeric was excessive in the food."

/user_details?userid=VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw,WhiteFeather H.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is an absolute DELIGHT. Such warm + welcoming service - pure charm, all good vibes. The food was completely delicious. We had the blue cheese and lamb soup with naan bread as a starter, which was perfection. Then, a sampler of all the different types of momos (dumplings) which were artfully prepared, perfectly seasoned and came with the best mint sauce of life, I kid you not. We also had the chili chicken, which was also really, really tasty. To top it all off, the prices are totally affordable. The wine selection leaves much to be desired, though, so next time I'll just stick with the super fresh mango lassie or the butter tea. This will be the place I take out of town friends from now on, and I'll be going back again to treat myself, too."
/user_details?userid=Et6YLMrlyX2PCkqtwSVAug,Sabeena S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I am so extremely happy that my group stumbled upon Om on a winter night. Here's the story. We tried to find a table at Noren (up the street) but they ran out of food before 8 pm. On this frigid Friday evening in December, we stumbled into a nearby Mexican restaurant, only to be so utterly disappointed in the chips (which we had to pay for) and terrible drinks. We quickly looked at nearby restaurants and decided on Om. At this point, our group had grown from 2 people to about 8. We walked into Om and were greeted and seated at the center table immediately. Service was exceptional! We were given many delicious recommendations and never pressured into something we didn't want. The food was Halal so we went to town ordering chicken and beef dishes. I highly recommend the beef dumplings and beef specialty dishes. Tibetan food has so much more than dumplings though, and we tried some of the delish stir fry dishes. Some were quite spicy and I loved them all. I definitely recommend Om to others. If you're looking for some delicious food at a reasonable price, go with a large group of friends and order to your heart's desire. We ate family style and were so incredibly full and happy paying around $20 each."
/user_details?userid=VkvSWEwVmdTUea3U2aBnrA,Barbara C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal.  The owner is super friendly and we always feel welcomed.  Almost everything on the menu is tasty and well executed.  The momos, although a little thick, taste great, especially with the mint, tamarind and hot sauces.  The samosas are excellent, as well as the lentil soup and pakoras.  If you like spicy food, try the lentil noodles with beef and mushrooms (ping sha) and ask them spicy; I order them everytime and I'm never disappointed.  The palak tofu (i.e. tofu and spinach in a creamy sauce) is also delicious, as well as the lamb biryani.  Stay away from the chicken chili, though: it's very bland and uninteresting."

/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Not knowing anything about Tibetan food and on the hunt for something different I thought I would give Tibetan Om a try.  Located right on Saint Laurent this is a affordable, simple restaurant cooking up Tibetan and Indian food.  They have standard Indian dishes that you would find in any Indian restaurant (curry, butter chicken, etc).  If you come here though try the Tibetan food.They have a table d'hote which gets you a soup or salad, main, and dessert for about $20.  The lentil soup was well-seasoned and perfect for a cold, winter night.  I followed it up with momos which are a dumpling.  They offer a variety of fillings (beef, cheese, shrimp, vegetarian). I tried all of them and I have to say the cheese and beef ones were my favourite.  The cheese one was surprisingly sweet but I enjoyed it quite a bit.The service was pretty good except at the end of the meal when we had to flag down our waitress for dessert and the bills.  The owner though was incredibly friendly.  I really enjoyed the experience and would definitely come back in the future."
/user_details?userid=mely8w4HtWpyV2mu7Mz16g,Vikram N.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This restaurant markets itself as Tibetan-Indian, and it's an interesting concept, but in reality I found the food fairly bland and uninspiring.We got the Butter tofu, a plate of momos and a dal soup and none of the dishes really stood out. The ingredients did not taste fresh and overall it did not feel worth the money. Perhaps we caught them on a bad night, or the dishes we ordered weren't their specialties, but I, for one, was not, impressed. There is better Tibetan and better Indian food to be had in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=O9g4Q4LbjuVtQACWT4-BCA,Pedro T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The food is cheap and very tasty. The owners are friendly and the service is great. I truly recommend it! We had momos, a veggie curry, the steamed&the fried breads (the fried bread is more on the sweet side and it's delicious) dahl soups & samosas. The portions are big enough so we can bring a lot home and enjoy it again the next day. :)"
/user_details?userid=paua782iHct_i0DEvkO2nw,Tania A.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"As a big fan of Tibetan food, I was expecting a fine gastronomic experience coming to this restaurant, but I left unimpressed. The folks who own the place are extremely courteous, but the vegetarian tofu dishes we ordered were dull as dishwater. We were looking forward to having their momos, but they turned out to be overly starchy. Made with more dough than actual filling. It's too bad, I really wanted to like this place."
/user_details?userid=P8hKMc73rWhEnXNV-qA7DA,Liam B.,"Dundalk, MD",5 star rating,"Went here tonight. Love this place. The owners are lovely (and they have a cute tiny little kid who brought us an unsolicited can of 7-up mid-meal), the room is nice and quiet, and the food is on point--and there's a lot of it, which I wasn't expecting; we couldn't even finish it. But that beef-and-bean-noodles plate is sure going to look great to me tomorrow!Get a salad, too. They make a delicious dressing, something with sesame oil? Anyway, you won't regret it."
/user_details?userid=S5c--8QmwRjHkoSCZ_ppnA,Alice S.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Great service!! Amazing food. Such a great experience. It was our first time ordering Tiberan food so we asked our server what he recommended. He recommended dishes that are common in Tibet and all of them were amazing. If you don't know what to order, I recommend asking the staff for recommendations. They are amazingly friendly and would be happy to help. No matter what though, you must order the momos!!"

To be fair, I haven't eaten there for a while and I forgot what it was that I ordered, but I just remember this feeling of sitting back after the meal with the biggest smile on my face. Give it a try, and I'm sure you'll feel the same."
/user_details?userid=tlIdj2uioPgeghrewACJyQ,Eric B.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"I found this venue through Yelp and it did not disappoint: delicious food, reasonable prices and a warm and welcoming waiter (owner?) made our dining experience a superb one. Highly recommended. Try the sweet bread and the cheese dumplings."
/user_details?userid=bxaICaGxzYHSB1MsztlGdg,Matylda K.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Let's start with the good: their house white wine is surprisingly good, by any means not an amazing wine but the type of wine I would reorder again because it's fresh, good and cheap. Now, I had an amazing experience in Vancouver trying vegetarian food in a Tibetan restaurant and my boyfriend and I absolutely loved it. Not sure if the previous reviewers tried the vegetarian meals, but we thought they were bland. After trying amazing dumplings in Vancouver and my mom's pierogies, my boyfriend and I were disappointed with their vegetarian dumplings. The dumplings: the dough was good, but they mixed potatoes and other veggies together, creating a paste without much flavour, like they put everything in the same blender and cooked it thereafter. The pakoras' dough was sweet - not my favourite. The vegetarian cari lacked the freshness of the spices, you couldn't taste the flavours. Finally, instead of a naan bread they had a piece of a round bread I had already bought in a grocery. Just call it whatever, not naan bread. Otherwise, the mango and green tea ice creams were okay, but nothing to go crazy about. You guessed it: I wouldn't come back."

/user_details?userid=3mVMqNIvOumVbkyHXNmgUg,Marc A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I'd had pretty good Tibetan food before so I came in with high hopes.  I wasn't really disappointed.  They accommodated my vegan palette with gusto and altered a few things to make them vegan, without complaint, eye rolling, or any of the other uncomfortable weirdness of some other restaurants.  My waiter?  He got it.The waiter was charming and even though the place was absolutely packed and busy, he took his time to explain the meals to us and to ensure everything would be vegan-ified for me.  They have a Tibetan menu and an Indian menu.  My concern was that the Tibetan food would be a little bland as I've had some bland ass Tibetan food before.  I ordered a bunch of stuff - I honestly can't remember what everything was - but only one thing was a tad tasteless.  Hey, I won't lie, the vegetable curry was bland as hell, but the experience in general passed my litmus test.Order some of the moist Tibetan bread that comes in this roll thing.  Just do it.  Sort of like Fruit-by-the-Foot style.  You dip it in your food and in sauces and stuff and it's delicious.  I loved it and it really hit the spot.  The samosas were also far superior to the samosas I'm accustomed to eating.  The dessert was a sweetened rice thing with raisins.  It was alright, but it normally comes with yogurt so of course the texture for me was a bit lacking; however, if you're not vegan, that won't concern you if you order it, of course.While they did not have any Tibetan beer - the waiter explained to me that most Tibetan beers were home brews and they obviously couldn't sell that stuff in a restaurant - I must say that Tibetan food makes an excellent buffer before a night out drinking.  So yeah.  I'm coming back."

While we've eaten plenty of Indian food, we were at a loss for what Tibetan food to order. Thankfully, Tashi our waitress was more than happy to assist us with order.

/user_details?userid=-98R8PA8-DMFANCBtg9-RQ,Jeff F.,"Ann Arbor, MI",4 star rating,"Getting to try Tibean food at Om was a treat so we ordered from the Tibetan part of the menu and skipped the Indian food.  The menu offers several kinds of dumplings (taste better than the word sounds) and realizing it was our first time, our server offered to bring a mixed platter of several kinds which was terrific.  The stir-fried beef with mushrooms was awesome.  Lentil soup was tasty but a bit thin to me.  Slow paces, but that was fine for us."
