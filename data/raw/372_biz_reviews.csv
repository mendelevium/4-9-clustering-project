/user_details?userid=hkCJqpgCP66qrjRfTdgXuw,Sam F.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"Such a cool place.  A distinctive concept I have not remotely encountered elsewhere.  I found this place on an ultimately fruitless internet scour for 3.0 coffee places in this general vicinity, but the unique siphon coffee provided a welcome correction.  Very distinctive, tasty and a really cool process to watch unfold.  They also have this slow titration extraction that I bet was delicious, but did not see it till after we ordered.  Located in a large apartment building/school and frequented by lots of locals, a great place to blend in for a bit and take it all in. We caught the end of the lunch rush on a blustery Wednesday in November, and it was very cozy.The real highlight for me, as a Japanese food/rice fan, was this crazy onigiri thing.  We live in the center of the US, so this may have arrived on the coasts, but has not yet made its way inland.  I will be on the hunt now, because they are *delicious* - wow,  Such a cool and simple yet flexible/diverse concept.  We got the flight of five and the bowl of miso and it was a hearty lunch.  Four is probably a more reasonable number for one person, and three is probably more sustainable ;) but it was awesome to try out the wildly variable flavors and enjoy the excellent rice - cooked *just right*, most impressive.  My personal favorite was the smoked salmon, as the oils really shone in context with the rice.  The miso was excellent as well.  It was great fun to watch the staff bustling along in their tiny space - a well choreographed unit, for sure. Very cool art on the walls as well and as a geographer, I really appreciated the huge map on the wall that showed coffee regions of the world.  Overall a top notch place a bit off the beaten path but well worth the effort to find!"

We were walking to get some breakfast a couple miles from our AirBnB and realized we forgot to get coffee at the place we love. We knew if we kept walking we would eventually find a place. Lo and behold, we turned a corner, and here was this gem. The food is Japanese, the decor is hipster, the coffee is siphoned. Never had or seen siphoned coffee, but I liked it! I swear it tasted less acidic than filtered. The ambiance in the place was so cool we had our coffee inside. We really just needed the coffee and had breakfast plans, so we didn't get to try any of the food. If we were staying longer we'd definitely go back and give it a shot."
/user_details?userid=Gf_tmJuE5s_xiUfENEq56A,Anita S.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Great industrial decor, great place to chill out, solid coffee and I can't wait to come back to try the Japanese food for lunch!Doesn't disappoint for coffee.  Didn't realize, but they don't do espresso - only siphon coffee.  Don't worry, its excellent and about the same size as a small/medium allonge.  Not quite as big as a regular filter coffee.  Oh, and they do decaf!  And its single origin Colombian and its delicious!  Seriously, never had such a good decaf in my life.  Wish more places would take decaf seriously!The Japanese food looked and smelled delicious, can't wait to come back.The location is a bit out of the way, but this area has changed so much in the past few years!  Sorry, I'm not a local anymore but I suspect the massive Ubisoft office a few blocks away has initiated a domino effect and there are now so many new more upscale places on St Viateur for example.  Sorry, I'm feeling like one of those old people who complain about gentrification! I remember the good old days!  Haha.  Lol.  No seriously, I love Falco but I remember only like 5-10 years ago and Mile End was more local and low key.  Oh well.  I guess that's where everyone now talks about Mile-X.  Thankfully for gentrification, there are clients for Falco.  Because even only 5 years ago this street was kind of a no mans land - everything was focused (even then a bit spotty) on St Laurent, du Parc, St Viateur, etc.Just don't go closing down the old businesses!  And I'll be happy."
/user_details?userid=izdAXYjPdwaztxuT6C7GvQ,Jane S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,What a unique concept restaurant cafe. I loved the decor with the bikes and the nice large tables at Falco with ample light. The cafe can be a bit noisy with the staff preparing food for a lunch rush and machines they use but it's still a great place to work and get caffeinated. They also have some Japanese magazines and a small hammock to read in. The cafe is located at the bottom of an office building and around alot of other converted industrial buildings so be prepared for a lunch rush. Their onigiri are good but not especially great but I liked that they had so much choice for food and drink. I would definitely try the pour over for the experience of watching it being made from a bunsen-beaker esque contraption. You get a bit of a show with your drink :P Overall a fun place to spend some time if you are in the neighbourhood. Beware there is a debit minimum so bring cash.
/user_details?userid=Qwrbfgn8iGcHQ5MaQfXiTA,Seasy H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I found Le Falco when I had an hour to kill before a meeting, so this visit wasn't exactly planned. However, stepping into the cafe, I was immediately impressed at the decorations. The interior was so aesthetically pleasing with the hanging bikes and the industrial theme! Though I only stayed for a coffee (cold brew), which was good, the smell of lunch being prepared behind the counter was super tempting. I could tell from the crowd starting to form that this place was popular for lunch. However, I have to remove one star for the customer service; the attitude of the barista wasn't very welcoming, which threw me off a little. Still, working in this cafe was enjoyable since I'm a big fan of natural light and open spaces.  If Le Falco were located near my house, I imagine I would very quickly become a regular. However, since it isn't exactly in my neighbourhood, this won't be the case. Still, this visit was a nice experience, and I'd love to come back sometime soon - but only if the barista I encountered today  isn't working"
/user_details?userid=cfBZdumy0jx3hYgKst3w4Q,Elizabeth K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Following in the fine tradition of funky Mile End coffee shops, this fine example is nestled into one of the several industrial buildings that have become home to the many ""indi"" business and startups that have made Mile End their home. The open concept cafe features high ceilings and industrial decor, highlighting bare concrete, metal and wood. The food prep and cash area is not hidden from the rest of the cafe, but instead is prominently featured in the center of the room as part of the industrial decor. It is surrounded with a few cosy seating areas, a window facing counter, and some tables, including a very large communal table surrounded by a charming assortment of mismatched drafting stools.The food looks fresh and is apparently prepared throughout the day as evidenced by the staff busily prepping and chopping in the central area.Their clam to fame seems to be the nifty carafes they brew their coffee in. I ordered a ""cafe au lait"" style coffee along with a soft, ""half baked"" style chocolate cookie and a chewy ginger chocolate chip cookie. I LOVED the ginger cookie, it was perfect right down to the lack of ""baking soda"" taste some of those chewy ginger cookies can have. I have to say, although I loved the the the concept of the carafe based coffee brewing, and it is a beautiful design and very in keeping with the decor of the place, I did not love the coffee itself. It tasted a bit burnt (although it is possible I just got a burnt batch and this is not the norm). Despite being a bit pricey (for burnt coffee), I would definitely return here as a pleasant enough place to sip coffee and work on my laptop, although I would probably not choose the seat directly under the music speaker!"

/user_details?userid=GHoG4X4FY8D8L563zzPX5w,Hannah H.,"Alexandria, VA",3 star rating,"About a 2-2.5: Le Falco is a cafe that's in a large warehouse, offering fair-trade coffee, sandwiches, salads, onigiris, and Japanese rice bowls.  There's communal tables and even a hammock swing!  The hubs and I came here to check them out for a mid-day snack, and I tried the 3-onigiri combo special: you get to choose 3 onigiris of your choosing and a cup of soup (miso or their soup of the day) - I tried the pork, the salmon, and the breakfast 'egg' version.  The pork was okay, as it was sweeter bits of pork inside a rice ball; the salmon was a bit forgettable, as it was dried out and there wasn't much seasoning or flavoring to it; the breakfast 'egg' version was my favorite, as it was more heavy on the sesame oil and filled with some scrambled egg.  The miso soup was not appetizing at all, as it was a watered down weird concoction - there was hardly any miso taste to it, and it had some off chemical taste to it.  Complimentary water is up by the serving area, and once you're done, there's a section where you drop off your dirty wares.  Just a note, there's a minimum to use the CC.+breakfast 'egg' onigiri+avoid the miso! T___T+hammock swing on-site!"

I've had the Japanese bowl which was ground pork or beef with veg on pearl rice..pretty tasty for $8. They have a varied asian and french pastry menu so it's quick and not over priced, like a Japanese snack bar meets a small french cafe. The cookies are freshly made and the filtered coffee is great..it's a Mile End cafe surrounded by start ups..so it's pretty much a brogrammer's dream."
/user_details?userid=voFxNdzhG-cDrW_9NzFGbw,Denzil D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A very unique coffee shop that is only open Monday to Friday for the businesses in the area. The coffee is made in a unique way and that is reflected in the unique style of the shop. Japanese dishes are served for lunch are very tasty. A great place to meet, discuss or inspire yourself. The only downside is finding parking in the area."
/user_details?userid=DSFJIs5J1xp8l_fBpUydDw,Sanam A.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"One of the most beautiful cafes in Montreal! I love the decor. Cafe Falco has bikes hanging from the ceiling, large windows, communal tables, an open kitchen concept, a hammock, and black & white art hanging from the walls. I came here early afternoon during the week for lunch and to do some remote work. The place is very bright inside and it was surprisingly quiet given its popularity. I tried the Tofu Sobolo Don, a bowl with rice, lentils, carrots, and tofu. It was less than 8$ and the portion was very fair. Take note - there is a $12 minimum for credit cards."
/user_details?userid=088ICGWrFMiVAzD5vS0cRQ,Whitney T.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"As a tourist from Toronto have to admit was not too impressed by the flavours or size of the onigiris. I had 3 - salmon, pork and egg/seaweed. To my surprise the egg one was best. Beautiful interior though and long line up for lunch time crowd. Didn't try the drinks though to comment on that part."
/user_details?userid=VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw,WhiteFeather H.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"Beautiful siphon coffee - just beautiful. A rare perfect cup in the city. The open, concrete, warehousey space is nicely designed with a clean, pared down black, white and grey colour scheme and some vintage industrial decor items like old cast iron sewing machines, loved leather chairs and drawing table swivel chairs at a large wooden table in the centre. Also, fab large scale art. I haven't yet tried the food, other than a brownie (which was good but it's hard to go wrong with brownies), but I know I'll be going back to try it out. Wide open kitchen, and everything looks fresh and clean. If you're looking to hang out sipping coffee with your laptop, don't go at lunchtime - there's no wifi during lunch and there are no outlets anywhere, so go fully charged when you do go. Bonus: lots of galleries on the street to also visit."
/user_details?userid=VMfwMYh8iJapW807Pu1Diw,Jenviev A.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Canada",4 star rating,"Wonderful hidden gem on this industrial road. I love wandering in here for a coffee or light lunch during the week. The space is inspiring and filled with local flavour. What first attracted me here, was their unusual coffee preparation method. They specialize in siphon coffee, which looks more like a chemistry experiment than your typical coffee brew. The result is delicious though. A definite must-try on the Montreal coffee circuit. They also offer a Japanese themed lunch, with rice bowls and sandwiches. Everything I tried was pretty good. It should be noted that their hours are based around the local businesses, so don't expect to pop in here on a Sunday."
/user_details?userid=7TkOKn80Yw9tHjg1IJJ21w,Christian B.,"VT, VT",5 star rating,"While in the Mile End, Cafe Falco is a great spot to rest, resource and enjoy your time. The decor is unusual, with a bike hanging from the ceiling, art on the wall. With different seating arrangements, from a couch, to communal table, from high stools to a hammock, you will find the right spot. The coffee is on point, and the food is simple but very tasteful and flavorful; it is Japanese, but hipster may be a better description."
/user_details?userid=oSkz7bxTAoFJxgDGP5wJHg,John H.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Falco is a Mile End institution, tucked away on a cavernous stretch of de Gaspé encircled by megastructures and the Champs des Possibles free-growth urban park. Montreal's railway geography means that you are extremely unlikely to come upon this pocket neighbourhood unless you mean to, and in general, you need to be quite deliberate to enjoy Falco's charms. If you want lunch, you'd better mean it: there is only enough food made to feed those who come on time, and you'll be out of luck if you want to eat much later than 2 in the afternoon. If you want to work, get your data usage done outside of the lunch hour because they shut off the wifi. If you want to come at all, be persistent: Falco is open less than your average bank, and never on weekends.Your patience will be rewarded with hard-to-find Japanese lunch treats and very good but not excellent coffee. The various bowls are great options, and I can't name another place in the city that has their variety of fresh onigiri (rice triangles stuffed with meat or veggies in a seaweed tab). Tasty chicken salad sandwiches. I like their syphon coffee for its novelty, but I can't rank it among the city's best third-wave brews and I have to admit that it is expensive. But that's an acceptable compromise to spend some time in this soothing, creative, beautiful space that makes you pat yourself on the back for living in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=6yNwk5i7LtEmW3dULoaKog,Kat Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"What a real treat to come here!  Didn't really know where to park to come here, but, parked on St-Laurent/Bernard and the walk to come here was worth it.  Took in the scenery of the park and graffiti art.  Just too bad that it's closed on the weekends :(.Have been wanting to come here for ages and luckily a buddy of mine who came to town, who is also a coffee freak, have been wanting to go too, and once we got in - we were thrilled! We wanted to try their food, had arrived a bit too early before the lunch hour, but we were able to put in our order anyway, and was served the food at exactly 11:30am.  Ordered the onigri pork and daikon salad, with a cold drip coffee.  Friend got the pork sandwich with a (potato?) soup, and house tea.  He said he liked it.  It was too bad I only got the one onigri - I was discouraged to go back in line again because once it got to lunch time, the line was just out the door...but, I'm sure the line moved quick tho' ;).  The rice was perfectly soft, but solid enough to hold the pork yumminess inside.  Once the saltiness and familiar taste of char siu hit my lips, it was gold.  The salad was fresh too.  The vinegar was light and was real appetizing.  We sat by the high chairs facing out the windows - it was great to people watch (mostly hipsters in 90's clothing that brought me back to the days listening to Crystal Waters and any dance music basically...).  And yes, the coffee was pretty ok too.The washrooms are outside of the place - they're through a hallway connected to the building that the resto was situated in - still on the ground floor.Next time, I'd like to spend the day in the hammock for one!"

I didn't expect to notice the subtlety of the coffee - I guess I suspected I'd swilled way too much to have much sensitivity left - but the layers of flavors did stop me in my tracks. I sat down on the steps in the sun to savor it slowly, and was thankful for the moment of zen."

/user_details?userid=5Ymfsf9fAYz-Ds_p0xawVQ,Anthony K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Le Falco is one of the latest additions to Mile End's ever-expanding and apparently unstoppable restaurant/café scene.  Tucked out of the way in the Garment District, this is definitely something new for Montreal:  it's got a designer feel, the menu combines sandwiches with rice balls and other Japanese snacks, and the coffee is prepared strictly in Japanese siphons and served in Japanese ceramic cups.  On Saturdays, they offer a Japanese brunch,  featuring a rice bowl with braised chicken or tofu, du puy lentils, sprouts, grated carrots, and pickled daikon, plus miso soup, coffee, juice, and a muffin (!).  Good deal, and fairly tasty too, but I wish the rice bowl had less of a hippy vibe.  Maybe I just wish that it had been prepared by Kazu or David Chang.M. noted that it felt like we were in Vancouver, or maybe Toronto, and I knew what she meant.Roast on tap was fair trade organic from Kickapoo Coffee."

I can't recommend the ginger beef rice bowl enough, soooo yummy. If you plan on eating there I'd recommend going for brunch as they have a big lunch time rush and your favourite dish can often sell out. Seating is great in there but again at lunch time it gets pretty packed!They put a lot of time and care into their teas and siphon coffee and it shows.On top of that the staff are very friendly and always thank you for your business :)"

Don't be put off by the location, the it's a great place to have a meeting with someone, or just get some work done.The space has an industrial feel that is not uncommon in Japan, but makes it different from other cafes (and refreshing) here in Montreal.It's one of the few (only?) places you can get cold-filter coffee (with the option of maple syrup as a sweetener) in town, which is nice on these hot summer days.I haven't tried the food here, but I've heard good things. The pastries I have had have all been great.They have free wifi, but it's not available during the lunch rush (12pm to 1 or 2pm - I can't recall exactly)."
/user_details?userid=ddUsCHQmQr-N4cHMl3S3fg,Jodie C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Good coffee doesn't necessarily need good space... but in most cases they go hand in hand. Cafe Falco is just a delight to sit in. Spacious, and minimalist but still warm-- now that's a good combination.  When I visited it was quiet and calm which provided an ideal environment for me to do some work. However, I did visit an hour before closing time, so I have no doubt that was the reason. I ordered a large coffee ( I was given 2 choices, a small or large) and it was served in a Japanese ceramic cup which was a nice change. I ordered the coffee of the day and it was strong but not overwhelming.  Coffee is brewed with Siphon Coffee Makers or vac pots which I had never seen before and because it was my first time having coffee made that way I can't really say how it particularly changes the flavor of the coffee. Regardless, the coffee was great. Didn't get to try their food (which I hear is really delicious) but they had small snacks like cookies at the counter. Overall, a cafe that I hope will stay around for a very long time."

If you are looking for great ambiance this place is fantastic! Beautifully creative yet serene, I love the look of the wood/white walls/antique sewing machines/plants/photos. I sat at the community table that gives you a great view of the entire layout.  It's definitely a west meets simple Japan-influenced garden. Another added bonus: The menu has a Japanese twist to their food! The food is filling (I had a Sandwich au poulet and delicious side salad Cabbage w/ Sesame) and best surprise: homemade onigiri! A serious hard-to-find in a commercial café establishment in this city!  The only thing I found a bit lackluster is the dessert, the brownie wasn't worth writing home about, and the other choices didn't seem special either.Things I spotted in the café: - Mid-Aged First Dates engrossed in a laughter filled convo then joyously agree to take a walk together- Language Exchange Meeting Russian/French with English- 2pm meeting of the Suits- Moms and Babies taking in a quick bite- A few twenty-five-ish Mac toters sketching away and creatively brainstormingSo be it first date, second date, your makeshift bureau away from home, a getaway for newbie moms, a neutral area to sign on the dotted line, or just need a place to be reflective and absorb some creativity - come check out this place, it's beautiful. Can't tell you when it opens, but it closes at 5pm."

Most people were ordering lunch, which seemed to be a sort of japanese infused cafe fare, I may give it a go next time. This time I just got a cafe latte and sat down at a long table where I was joined by a couple of lunchies who I overheard say something about ""c'est les petits delices dans la vie qui comptent"" so they must have been liking it. The latte was good but didn't amaze me by its subtlety, and it was kind of expensive, but I had fun watching it being made in their crazy coffee contraptions."
