/user_details?userid=8gZwPyesnY2mDiN5E_pmzQ,Brandon S.,"Pointe-Claire, Canada",5 star rating,I went here as I noticed they sell slices. Previously the space was a nicer restaurant. Same level of decor but now a pizza place. Slices are delicious and fancy. Slices are large and thin soft crust. You will not be disappointed. Best Brandon
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I saw someone eating a slice of their pizza outside on the sidewalk and seemed worthy of trying.It was super thin crust and the smell wafting was just the right kind, so I grabbed a quick slice to-go before dinner one night a while back.At 4.50 for a 1/4 pizza sized slice, I did have some reservations, but for the most part it was a nice example of what super thin crust pizza should be (and pretty rare to find that style in these parts).The sauce was flavorful, yet not too tangy. The cheese was almost melted parmesan-like and on the bottom - and not a lot of it. There was also a somewhat sparse amount of Soppressata (Italian dry salami) which was just spicy enough to take notice of.They have little containers of chili flakes and chili oil (which is fairly intense, so the real deal).Did I mention the pizza is hand thrown and that almost put them up to a five, still darn close.Note: All slices are priced the same, with toppings or plain."
