It is an interactive restaurant that is decorated as a setting in ancient China. You can check out an olden day pharmacy and jail cell. A neat fact: the windows of the restaurant were taken from an old abandoned village house in China. The menu is simple, you pick what kind of noodles you like. Covid-19 doesn't take away from the experience, you can have their noodle soups to go ! The seafood curry laksa is delicious. Highly recommend! Available for delivery and takeout !"

It's spicy, numbing, packed with flavor and has some crunch in it. The very potato noodles was also good and flavorful but the chicken broth was a bit ordinary. The decor in the place is amazing. You really feel like you're transported back in time in ancient china. The staff are nice but the service is a bit slow. Would definitely come back."

If you want to feel like you're travelling to China without having to go on a plane, then you gotta check this place out! The decor is impressive and the staff is nice. Once inside, you can really appreciate the effort and care they put in the restaurant to make the whole experience very memorable. You have a cute little menu and the waiter explains very well what's in each dish. We opted for the laksa noodles (it was ok, not hot enough), the chicken noodles (it was good) and the spicy peanut noodles (if you like spicy, this is a good one to order)"

Noodle Hero will take you hundreds of years back to ancient China as soon as you enter their doors. It was quite an experience. Fun fact: it took them 2 years to collect the items they used for decor in the restaurant. * We tried 4 dishes: Yibin, Laksa, Sweet Noodle, & Â chicken broth * They were all very filling, delicious, and hearty. Should I mention, they're full of unique flavours. I did have to comment on the saltiness, but regardless it was a pleasure to visit !"
