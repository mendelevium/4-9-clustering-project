It was pretty busy but we managed to get a table at 9pm on a Friday night.  This was my first visit but the other girls had been there before. I have never had Venezuelan food before and it definitely will not be my last! Everything was so good!! I ordered a pitcher of white sangria for the table. It tasted like juice which was a bit disappointing but I did not come here for the sangria. Next time I would totally add shots to the pitcher!The girls ordered two palitos de yuca con guasacaca to share for the table. These are like thick cassava fries that you dip into avocado sauce. It was so good! Cassava for those who do not know is a root vegetable similar to potatoes. It was so good I ordered an extra serving! That avocado sauce is so bomb!! I heard you can actually buy it in store but I think I will just google it and make this sauce at home because I imagine that it must be pretty simple enough to make. I put this sauce and the chilli sauce that they had on the table on everything I ate that night! So arepa is a traditional Venezuelan/Colombian gluten-free bread made with corn. My colleague who is Venezuelan told me to get either the Pabellon (beef) arepa or the Reina Pepiada (chicken) arepa. The girls and I all had the Pabellon, which is basically corn bread in the shape of a soft taco with minced beef, back beans, plantains and feta cheese inside. OMG this was good and very filling! It also came with a small side of salad which was nothing special but I still ate it all.I will totally come back and try the Reina Pepiada!! This restaurant is good and affordable. My Venezuelan colleague told me he found it expensive for Venezuelan food but for non-Venezuelan people it is A-OK!"
/user_details?userid=YUlBxBTPMPM3mawg4Opuvw,Haque I.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,It is my first time trying Venezuelan food and I loved it. The meat portion was generous and the service was really fast. I didn't anticipate it would be so good. We just wanted to try something new nearby and stopped by here. The sauce they gave was awesome as well. Would definitely recommend
/user_details?userid=XwMZ4qe0Icf7csxWJ-Wm6A,Katy Q.,"Montgomery, NJ",3 star rating,"Hipster latino food featuring mainly arepa sandwiches. Bigger, and definitely more trendy that I expected with their awesome portrait paintings.My rating is very likely due to my mistake of ordering a black bean soup (filling me up with bloated heaviness, wasn't anything special) before my main meal could be enjoyed. I managed to consume of the argula salad (bitter) and maybe 2 bites of my arepa before calling it quits. My other friends had a much better experience... ordering a variety from fancy cheeses to pulled pork to chicken, everyone loved their selections. They would probably rate this place a 4/5. Also staff was very cool about doing seperate checks to make it easier for us. Anyways moral of story is don't eat a giant can of black beans before your entree if you want to have a good time."
/user_details?userid=a6GEhVJLqK6sxp3HPwqAeQ,Vanessa W.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,A Pabellón de Pernil Arepa was delicious! The perfect blend of sweet and savory.They also provide two squeeze bottles of sauce for you to add if you want. The green sauce was amazing and I couldn't stop squeezing more and more of it on! The hot sauce also adds a nice little kick.

/user_details?userid=05AH2UJKDAxTcJVOy3XPIg,Mohamed A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"One of the oldest arepa restaurants in Montreal. Solid arepas, all the classics options available(pabellon, pernil, cheese and guacamole, extra), good desserts, and juices. Nice and relaxed service.  Price is mid-range, can't get cheaper for such ""exotic"" food in Canada. Only wish they were more generous in their white/feta cheese portions!They used to be a whole in the wall in Rachel street, I'm glad the business is in prosperity, and they rented such big space!"
/user_details?userid=wmXYo8UbPon5woxlOvVptA,Vanessa H.,"West Windsor Township, NJ",5 star rating,"A delightful place! Very welcoming and comfortable ambience. The staff is sweet and patient. There was a small wait, but completely doable on a Saturday night. We were seated and immediately served water. I ordered the vegan arepa (grilled veggie) and my SO ordered the chorizo arepa. We got the cassava sticks to share.The sticks came out in 3 minutes! They were crisp but super soft on the inside. They are served with an avocado sauce.The arepas were wonderful. They were served with avocado sauce and hot sauce. Each arepa comes with a little side salad (really delicious). The greens are crisp and fresh. The veggies are cooked wonderfully and the avocado sauce!!!! Was amazing!!! I couldn't stop adding more to my arepa.Each arepa is around 8-9$. (CAD) not bad, but I did get hungry again soon after. If you have a large appetite, I would suggest getting two."

The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is nice. The restaurant is very modern and clean on the interior. I had the Pabellon Mechado and my wife had the Pabellon Pollo.   Both were excellent and filling.

The chicken was moist and flavorful. The wonderful arepa patty and cheese just pushed it over the top. The quesllo de coco was an excellent dessert to finish the meal."

It feels like a family run business, service was fast and friendly. We had the pork La Sureño and the arepera beef number 2. My friend has sweet tooth and really disliked the sugar cane juice tho (he says it wasn't sweet lolz). The plantain cheesecake is special but oh so filling! Would come back :)Tip: music playing around 7 pm!"

Had to eat some of the filling first haha. definitely add the spicy and cilantro sauce they give you.You can either get the arepa sandwich w a side Salad or a plate which comes with filling, rice, beans, plantains and an arepa on the sideAlso you must get the empanadas. You can get a choice of filling: chicken / beef / or cheese. The breading for this was something else. Great service and loads of spots to sit. Highly recommended!!!"
/user_details?userid=-lbi7R_rgEHnqa-D-9P-Iw,Alexander P.,"Harrisburg, PA",5 star rating,"A Venezuelan arepa spot with The Beatles on the wall? Hell oui! Arepas were absolutely stuffed with meat and cheese. Great flavor, especially with the avocado sauce drizzled on top. Our daughter, who is a very picky eater, really enjoyed the ham and cheese. Awesome food, good service, affordable prices. Atmosphere is a little loud, but it didn't detract from the experience. Oh, and don't forget to try the gluten free beer!"

We came here because my friend is gluten free, and they are one of the few restaurants in Montreal with an entire gluten free menu. It is absolutely delicious, very reasonably priced and with a great, friendly, relaxed and colourful vibe. We were instantly welcomed by the personable waiter. I ordered the chicken, feta and avocado sandwich, the big fries that come with the famous (and delicious!) avocado sauce, followed by a plantain cheesecake and guava juice. I would definitely return to this restaurant. It's perfect for those who are looking for delicious Venezuelan food."
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Arepera has been on my list for the past few years. Finally made it happen on a early Tuesday evening (around 5:00pm). Get there early otherwise be prepared to wait. The inside is cozy and brightly coloured with interesting paintings lining the walls. Their juice menu is intriguing. Tamarind, passion fruit, raw sugar cane & lime, soursop, guava, lulo and mango. The menu itself is mainly arepas with a few platters. Everything is 100% gluten free. - Lulo juice ($3.00) - never heard of this fruit before but it was heavenly. - La margaretiña (#22) ($9.00) - cazón (minced shark stew in tomato sauce) and plantains. This arepa looks small but it is massive. They stack it up. Meat was plentiful and tasty; honestly, would have no clue I was eating shark if it wasn't mentioned. The plantain was a bit much though; very carb heavy. Nice touch with the spinach salad to balance things out. The game changer was the avocado cream sauce; so flavourful with a hint of heat. Absolute bomb. The hot sauce was also good but I kept on reaching for the avocado bottle. Pack and sell that!Definitely worth a try. Just come hungry."
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Cute cafeteria styled resto. They moved to this new location within the last year.  The converted church pew benches and colorful art add a sense of whimsy to the place. Service is really prompt so great place to stop by if you're starving and gotta eat like yesterday!! Highly recommend trying the juices they're refreshing! Food: we order two beef arepas--the pabellón and the popular and the shark meat one to share. The waitress brings our three arepas each with a crispy watercress salad and for some reason I mistake the shark meat for the beef pabellon!! All the while I'm munching on it, I'm totally confused cause shark meat tastes a bit like flaked tuna. It was a little bland so I drowned it in the avocado sauce. I kept thinking that it was a fishy tasting beef. Still couldn't figure it out! LolThen we shared the pabellón (which I still thought was the shark one) and to my surprise I was soooooo good with the sweetness from the fried plantains, the saltines of the feta, the garlic from the black beans and the meat all married so well together.  You must absolutely try this one if you eat meat!!! So finally I couldn't take it anymore, I show the waitress the photo of the shark arepas (which I still thought was the beef) and asked her if it was a wrong order to which she clarified that it was the shark arepas!!  I had eaten the shark one and shared the pabellon instead of visa versa!  Hence this is why we take photos of our food as Yelpers... It can help clarify mystery meat :PThe popular was quite good, cheesy. But I prefer the pabellon best! Must go back to try some more!"

I have celiac disease so it was amazing not having to worry about a single thing I ordered. My friends all loved the food as well. The service was so friendly and quick that we came back multiple times on our visit to Montreal! I highly recommend the yuca fries, and the plantains as starters. Any of the arepas are amazing!"

It took a while but i finally went tonight and it did not disappoint. The food was delicious and the service was amazing. We were a few girls that hadn't seen each other in a while, they were super chilled, did not rush us, we took our time and had a great evening. Will definitely return!!"

They have a huge menu from arepas to platters and a delicious juice selection (the guanabana is a def must). VEGAN FRIENDLY as well! 1 order of arepa is enough to make for a satisfying meal, good value.The pernil arepa has roasted pork, beans, plantains, feta cheese and is mouthwatering good. Highly recommend. Yucca fries are also A+. Service is great, everyone is nice and attentive. FYI: I recommend calling ahead of time for their hours because I think they close earlier than the website indicates. Overall, 10/10 experience!!"
/user_details?userid=IrZ37G3pEnPtH5wAk3DKdQ,Ilana Z.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"WOW. This place is amazing. The atmosphere is really cool. The decor gives of a Latin vibe and there are mountains of avocados/ plantains right near the kitchen. There are also long benches for people who are waiting to sit on so it wasn't a bad 20 minute wait at 9pm on a Saturday night. The menu is extensive ranging from different arepa sandwiches (vegetarian options too) to plates. All of the arepa's are gluten-free as well! We ordered the yuca fries with green avocado sauce to start with. Let me tell you, this sauce is something I should smuggle back to the US.. I could eat SO much of the sauce.. dipping it with bread, arepas, potatoes, anything.I ordere an arepa with chicharron, black beans, and avocado. It was AMAZING!!! The sandwich was so hot, the chicharron was cooked  so well, and the best part is that the sandwich was only $10 CAD. I would definitely come back here, and the staff like working here so it's a plus for everyone. (Music is also really good)"

This lunch diner kinda joint serves deceptively simple yet absolutely delicious comfort food. Not only is it comfort food, yay, but it's actually perfectly seasoned and if you want more flavour, they had you whole bottles of hot sauce and avocado dressing, double yay. Plus they have meat, vegetarian, vegan options. So anyone can enjoy a good meal. Totally worth checking out!! Oh!! And, the deserts were sooooo good. Just remember this isn't a fancy meal spot. This is, I need feel good food that won't make me regret life, haha. Enjoy!!"

Well, our hotel was super close to this restaurant, which is in such a cute block, close to a really nice park, and while walking around I spotted it and we just couldn't say no. The place is super low key, nothing fancy, just excellent Venezuelan food. We had arepas, empanadas, delicious juices, and of course fried plantains. Oh man, want all that again right now!! If you're in the area I definitely recommend it. The service was good, and the food was excellent. Très bon!"

Our waiter Marco was so knowledgeable with great menu recommendations, we tried everything he recommended!! Very clean and quick service. 1 star missing because we almost walked out due to the host who was not welcoming, friendly or make any attempt to communicate with the language barrier.  Her cold stares and eye rolls were non appetizing.  But one person would not stop us from revisiting."

We ordered the empanadas appetizer to share (1 cheese, 1 chicken, 1 beef) and each got an arepa. I got the chicken and avocado arepa and my friend ordered a beef, plantain, beans and cheese arepa. Everything was really good with the empanadas being my favourite part. I thought the chicken arepa needed something else apart from just chicken and avocado - maybe something crunchy. I added hot sauce to change it up. Super filling and affordable.Will be going back to try a different flavour combination!"

/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"I had lunch here with my mom, and we both loved it.We both had the arepas.  I had the shredded beef with plantains, black beans and feta arepa ($9) and she had the shredded chicken in tomato sauce arepa ($8).  They both came with a tiny watercress side salad.The arepas were stuffed full.  Mine had too little beef for my liking, but the beef it did have was tender and flavourful.  The plantains were sweet and went well with the nippy feta.  The black beans were nicely done - not too mushy nor too hard.  All the ingredients blended together well in the sandwich.  They did bring some hot sauce and avocado sauce to the table, but I felt that the sandwich didn't need any additional sauces.  The arepa itself was nice and fluffy on the inside and a bit harder on the outside, just the way I like it.  It's like an English Muffin but made of corn instead of wheat.  The watercress salad had some of the avocado sauce on it.  It was tasty, but pretty simple.  I mean, it was just watercress after all (no other vegetables).My mom enjoyed her arepa but felt that it was too wet.  She said by the end, the bottom of her sandwich was all soggy.  She also felt it was a bit boring with just the shredded chicken.  She said she regretted not ordering one of the pork ones.The place is really small, with just over 20 seats or so.  We arrived a little before noon and the doors were still locked.  They unlocked right at noon (their opening time) and we and 2 other customers entered.  By 12:30pm, the place was packed.  It was a weekday. Service was friendly and efficient.  The place is super cute.  It gets a bit loud though.  I would come back for sure :)"

I dream about these Arepas sometimes."

We got the Pabellon - it had a great mix of savoury beef, sweet plantains, and salty cheese. They come with a crunchy and refreshing watercress salad which was a nice contrast. The best thing here though is the green avocado sauce. They give every table a bottle and it makes everything taste even more incredible.We also got the passionfruit juice which was nice and refreshing, if a bit sweet. Overall incredible spot and would definitely recommend."

Not only is the food fantastic but everything is gluten-free, they've got a ton of vegetarian and vegan options, and everything is super affordable.I'm also super happy to see them in their new space. While it's definitely not the same super cozy and charming space that their original spot off of Duluth was, it's really great that they have a heck of a lot more seats. I remember waiting outside in some really icy weather at their old place for a table- it was always worth it, but I'm stoked that there isn't that issue anymore. Happily they've replicated the same design elements from their first location: the fake brick, the bright walls, the big celebrity caricature paintings- it's nice to see they didn't go full fancy with the space upgrade. Also, the menu prices have stayed the same. Yay! Go Arepera!"

Unfortunately we were disappointed.. the sandwich is small and only meat and some sauce in it. Nothing special, just normal food. Kinda expensive. The entrees were good but also small and pricy.

It is perfect for a group of friends.My friend and I arrived and were quickly seated while a small line formed behind us. We ordered plantains to start and she ordered a chicken arepera. I ordered the Dómino con plátano which is black beans, plantains and feta cheese. I changed the feta to andino cheese for no extra charge. This was the first arepera that I ever had and I really enjoyed it. The sweetness and saltiness melted together perfectly.  I would skip on ordering plantains next time as the portion is pretty small and they come in many of the areperas. Overall, I enjoyed my meal. Really great prices too. The service was good but a bit slow and the waiters were nice.Looking forward to coming back and trying something else off the menu.

We spent the weekend at Montreal and this was the first restaurant we had to wait on line for. We waited a good 20-30 minutes for a table. It is a very small restaurant and probably would not recommend for large groups. The menu is simple. 75% of it is all arepas. You pick either a vegetable, chicken, pork, beef or fish and it came with a side salad with avocado dressing. I had the pernil arepa and it was DELICIOUS. It doesn't look like much but it was packed with flavor. The hot sauce and avocado sauce was also a great complement as well.I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Montreal."

And for $3, there juices are also quite interesting and refreshing.

However, the wait time to before someone comes to take your order is always at least 10 minutes if you're lucky. Not a deal breaker as the food is worth the wait, but it can be annoying, so I recommend you call out as much as you can to catch their attention. One thing that for me, is definitely a big thumbs down is the seating. As an oversized person, the seating is unquestionably the most uncomfortable I've sat in. The metal bars on the back side crush your buttocks and is borderline impossible to lean back.All in all, great place with great food. But if you're oversized, ask for the bench seating."

/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great food for a small, family-style restaurant. We showed up on Saturday around 13h30, and immediately got a table. The ones who came after us were not so lucky, however. A line-up formed, and the ""reservation"" list on the door was soon full. The interior was cheerfully decorated with huge paintings of famous musicians (John Lennon, Billie Holiday, etc.) and Venezuela's national colors. Close to the kitchen, baskets full of plantain and avocados gave an impression of plenty. The latino music in the background added to the conviviality of the place. We ordered a plate of Reina pepiada (shredded chicken in avocado sauce) with the accompanying black beans, fried plantain and rice, and two arepas (la Margariteña and la Catira). The food came after a bit of waiting, but when it did it was piping hot and looking fabulous. The plantain was sweet and caramelized, the arepa was hot and fresh. The lulo juice I ordered was nice and tangy. We pretty much devoured the food, and soon were more than full (I admittedly overordered). The only leftovers were the watercress salads that came with the arepas. I'm used to eat watercress cooked, so the taste of it raw put me off. It was not as cheap as I expected, but definitely satisfying. Next time I will probably skip the platos and go straight to the arepas. By the way, it was my first time tasting shark (la Margariteña) and lulo. Yummy!"

The sandwich was good don't get me wrong, however I feel like it is very overhyped on yelp. The plantains paired with the salty beef created a nice savory/ sweet combo, however I found that the cheese overpowered the taste. In addition, I did not find the sauces to be flavorful at all; the avocado sauce was very meh and the hot sauce was not spicy to me at all!  The service was great however, and our waiter was very warm and friendly. Also I was told that the restaurant is moving to the intersection of Prince Arthur and Colonial starting January 1, 2018."

Located in a small corner cafe setting, we we're not too shocked to see a group of people waiting outside to be seated. However, it didn't take long before we were seated and our orders taken. I ordered the shredded chicken plate with avocado sauce served with black beans, rice, fried plantains, and feta cheese. The food was very simple yet tasty. The popular (gluten-free) bread was served on the side which are made of corn and reminded me on an inside-out sope. For dessert, I had the plantain ""cheesecake"" that was really more like a warm pudding with a soft cinnamon bottom."

First time here and it was good! Cute family run restaurant with unpretentious vibes. We ordered the chicken soup, the empanadas, a beef arepas, a chicken arepas, a guava juice and a tamarind juice. Everything was delicious! A few notes though. Even though a lot of the critics said this place to be inexpensive, i find some dishes not worth the price. True, the arepas are very inexpensive. One was more then enough for my husband and i could barely get to the halfway mark. The appetizers are what i find not worth it. We ordered the chicken soup. It was like grandma's chicken soup! With a few pieces of chicken, potatoes and the broth was very flavourful! Not worth 5$!!! We also got a mix of empanadas. It comes in threes for 6$. When it got to our table, we were surprised at how little they were. Two small bites each empanadas! Tasty but not worth 6$. The arepas were very filling and good! Service is nice too. I would definitely return for the arepas but will skip the appetizers ;)"
/user_details?userid=_iEifRDtMcDoVpc5BregGA,Smitha R.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,Love. The arepas are heavy- I came with the idea of having a couple as I was ravenous after a day of hiking around Montréal. The server recommended we start with 1 each and order more if needed. Thank goodness. It was delicious and very filling. Also got the yucca fries with avocado sauce. The sauce is absolutely delish and the manager confirmed that they used to use mayo in the sauce but have now switched it to vegan mayo so the sauce is vegan too. The gluten free beer brand is vegan friendly too and the beers were pretty good.  I highly recommend the place. Dreaming of it now

However, the food was flavourful, portion to price ratio, and service were all good. They take reservations so make sure you call ahead. The main dishes are about $9-$15 each and each side or appetizer you get is about $5 extra. I ended up getting the open face Arepera plate and the yuca fires. I really liked both. They also serve a gluten free beer and offer a lot of gluten free options. The only down fall to this place is the parking. There's no private parking and hardly street parking during dinner time"

This place was definitely a local favorite from what I could gather. There was a bit of a wait but it was well worth it!

Their coconut flan was nothing like the flan I am used to and was more like a cheesecake to me, but was still delicious! I loved the old man who came in with his guitar as well. I am now back in Los Angeles and craving arepas! I am sure they will not compare to the ones i had at this establishment.

The pork sandwiches are packed with flavor and fill you right up. I love the side sauces that they come with too: the spicy and avocado sauces are so good I could drown my sandwiches in them. I also love their plantain fries and have heard good things about their blackbean soup which I couldn't try since it was quickly sold out.
/user_details?userid=gzDnxZZGaBreY7u3ZTpfFA,Justin K.,"Jacksonville Beach, FL",5 star rating,"The Arepera was a gem tucked into a corner spot in Plateau Mont-Royal and was a resounding success! After living in a proverbial desert of Latin food in RI, our trip to Montreal offered the sabor we had been missing for so long. The wait was about 20 min on a Sunday afternoon, not too bad since the weather was comfortable. The wait list is a dry erase board next to the door. It's not easily noticeable and some folks seemed to miss it at first. Talk about amazing food choices. While I love arepa sandwiches, my wife and I both settled for the Plato de pabellón; her choice was the stewed chicken and mine was the roasted pork. The platters are a phenomenal portion given the price, plenty of food but not overkill. The pork was outstanding and the arepa was, hands down, the best arepa I ever had. Definitely recommend the side of Venezuelan guacamole to go with. And the sauces! One chile-based spicy, one avocado-based mild... Both amazing!! Go there!!"

Our waitress was extremely nice to explain the menu, and also was super friendly. The ambiance is great as they play some latin american music so it felt as if we were in Venezuela.Now for the food part, that is where we were thrilled! We had some Yucca Fries with the Guasacaca sauce and it was probably our favourite thing out of the night. They were crispy but not oily at all. I wondered how they did it! For our entrées, we had two meal plates with Rice, Bean, Fried Plantain, and chicken. We loved it!Totally recommend!PS: Small restaurant. Come early to avoid waiting lines!

It's a very popular Venezuelan restaurant in Montreal.I ordered the black beans and plantain arepa. The arepa is a corn based, popular homemade bread in Venezuela, stuffed with black beans and plantains. Absolutely delicious and gluten free!!!!  I added their famous avocado sauce to every bite. This simple, put together, like a wrap dish was a hit. Add a side of cassava fries and you have the perfect meal. The arepa and cassava fries could have easily been shared between 2 people, as it was quite filling for me. But if you're starving, go ahead and order your own.You can order your arepa with chicken, pork, beef, vegetarian and very vegetarian. I didn't make that last one up, it actually says that on the menu. The restaurant is a bit smallish, so a group of 2 to 4 max is good. Their waiting list is a white board outside the restaurant, where you write your name and number of guests. There's also no room to wait inside for a table, so you have to wait outside to be called in. That part wasn't fun on a cold winter day. But I still gave it a five star because the food was that amazing."

/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Holy cow (no pun intended). This place has some seriously good eats that are affordable and tummy-stuffing all at once, and it felt like home the minute I stepped in. The walls are adorned with paintings and photographs of notable musicians from the 60s and 70s like The Beatles, making me feel like I was stepping back in time to one of my favorite eras musically. Also, it gave me the vibe of a cute mom-and-pop shop, with a really easygoing vibe but fast service and low wait times.I ordered the mango juice; the beef, avocado, and cheese Arepa, and a small bowl of rice pudding for dessert. The mango juice was fresh and not artificially sweet, and it proved to be a great palate cleanser for the salty Arepa, whose chunky, meaty texture contrasted well with the smooth flavors of the avocado and the body of the cheese. For some reason, I thought it would be smaller than it actually was from the pictures, but it tasted so much like home cooking and comfort food within the soft, corn-based bread that I didn't mind getting more. Also, the watercress salad was refreshing and paired perfectly with the tangy dressing, making me happy to eat my greens for once. Finally, the rice pudding was the finale to an already great show, and the cinnamon-y, creamy goodness made it light but enjoyable at the same time.Arepera is a place that I highly recommend if you want Venezuelan food served up with a smile. It will make your day on all fronts because of how genuinely passionate everyone seems about the food served there. You definitely don't want to skip it!"

I loved both the spicy sauce and the creamy cilantro sauce on mine. We shared a plate of plantains for an appetizer, A got a beer (they only carry a gluten-free brand), and I tried the lulo juice, which was interesting and sort of citrusy-sweet.We were seated right away. The place was bustling but not crowded on a Saturday at 7. It was filled with couples, families, and folks getting takeout.

After reading the reviews of this place, I had really high expectations and hopes that this restaurant was going to be really good but nope.SERVICE:My experience was terrible. We walked into the restaurant and a waitress just told us to sit. She did not give us any menus/water nor did she tell anyone else to take care of our table. For about 20 minutes, the owner/waitresses just walked by and did not even care to give us the menu/water. Only until I yelled: ""excuse me, could you give us the menu/water"" was when someone finally served our table. The waitress's excuse was ""oh, I didn't see you there"". Like what do you mean you didn't see us... are you all blind?? The amount of disrespect was ridiculous. After deciding what we wanted to order, no one came to take our order until I yelled: ""excuse me, can someone take our order?"". FOOD:In terms of food, it was nothing special. The portions were ridiculously small for the price and nothing about it was delectable. We ordered the Chicken with Cheddar Cheese arepa (forgot which one on the menu specifically) and the Reina Pepiada, which was shredded chicken breast in avocado sauce. The arepa was bland and was not flavourful. The Reina Pepiada dish was not hot enough to my liking but there was no point in communicating my concerns when no one even bothered to provide good service to our table. The rice in the Reina Pepiada dish also tasted disgusting. Anyhow, this restaurant clearly does not deserve their 4.5/5 rating and I would not come back to this establishment ever again when I am in Montreal."

The wait is pretty easy for a party of 2 (around 15 mins or so), but another party of 4 probably waited closer to 45 mins-1 hr.Make sure to get the fresh squeezed juices. They are $3 each, and there are many varieties. We had the passion fruit, which was very good and refreshing.One arepa per person here is enough for a meal (vs. I can eat 2-3 at Caracas). These arepas are stuffed to the max and each come with a small salad with nuts and avocado cream.We ordered:#32 tomato, coriander, avocado and added roasted pork for $2. This one was okay. It tasted like pork with salsa in an arepa. #1 carne mechada (also known as ropa vieja or shredded beef) with black beans, cheese, and plantains. This one was delicious, probably why it's #1 on the menu. It's a classic with succulent and tender beef paired with the sweet and soft plantains.The arepa itself is really good. It tastes fresh, and it is has a soft interior but chewy exterior. Accepts credit cards, we didn't have any trouble with not speaking French, and street parking was a nightmare."

The food took a little while but was SO worth it. His arepera was outstanding - the corn shell was warm and crispy and stuffed with lots of meat and melty cheese. My dish was very good as well - I loved the flavour of the meat. The rice and beans were nothing special, but the plantains were to die for!

I'd never heard of these things until a friend of mine suggested we grab lunch here. In a nutshell, an arepera is a corn-based bread that is stuffed with meaty (or veggie goodness. It kinda looks like a smaller, fatter version of a pita. With your first bite, you will immediately think to yourself ""Sh*t, I need to order another one of these"" but wait! One's enough - they're fairly large and very filling! I ordered the shredded chicken with avocado sauce. It was so damn good. 'Nuff said. Oh, except you need to get more of that avocado sauce because it is TAYST-EE. Watch out for the red sauce - it'll open up your sinuses in no time. Service: Good! We were seated pretty quickly considering the place was full, and the wait staff was friendly. We didn't have to wait very long for our orders either, which is great because I was starting to feel a little hangry.Price point: $9 for one arepera."

The actual taste of the arepa was amazing, and the only reason I didn't fully enjoy it was my own mistake. I thought that it would have pulled pork, and instead it had more of a thin pork chop. I don't really like pork unless it's a shredded version, but again, that was my fault. My boyfriend got the shredded chicken with avocado sauce and LOVED it. We also got the cassava fries but didn't grab a pic because we were too excited to eat! Haha  Overall, I recommend this place! Great for a cheaper night out and the sandwich is actually very filling!"

Naturally, when she recommends good Venezuelan food, we are listening. I am so glad we followed her suggestion. We loved everything that we ate here at this family-owned and popular casual restaurant in the Plateau. Also, it is very family/kid-friendly!Although I am no longer a committed vegetarian, I really appreciate any menu that offers vegetarian options and Arepera has many, many wonderful vegetarian and vegan options. Who knew that Venezuelans ate such a vegetarian diet? I was completely over the moon with my garlic mushrooms! Oh my gosh, even now I am thinking about how mouth-wateringly delicious they are! My husband and I shared the black beans and plantains and we loved every bit and bite of them!One of my favorite parts of eating here is the bottomless bottle of avocado sauce that the server puts on our table! Bright green and fabulous on everything!Before eating at Arepera, I mistakenly believed that Venezuelan food must be similar to food in Costa Rica or Mexico. It has been years since my first time at Arepera and oh how naive I was! There is something all together unique about Venezuelan food that deserves to be explored! If you have not tried Venezuelan food previously, then you really must start your exploration here, at Arepera!"

I've read really good Yelp reviews and it seems promising, but the dedicated folks on the rain affirmed that this place was in fact worth the wait.Good: the interior is small and cozy, decorated with large paintings and latin style decor. It's a really small place, so seating can be a bit tight. The menu is extremely affordable, and so we ordered a couple of entrees and dessert. Firstly, the avocado sauces everyone mentions here lives up to the hype. The arepa tastes so darn fresh, and it's also ridiculously filling. I've ordered the feta cheese with grilled vegetables, and loved it for the most party except it had too much cheese (whatever, I've just scraped it off). Even my boyfriend was taken aback by how good the food was. Definitely one of the hidden gems of the Main.Bad: the dessert wasn't take great, it wasn't bad, but not really worth getting since it just tasted undercooked spongecake and the coconut flan just tasted like vanilla yogurt. Not impressed.Bottom line: dinner for 2 came out to nearly $30 for an appetizer, 2 mains and 2 desserts. So yeah, I'll definitely be back!"

I trusted this friend so I had no choice but to go to Arepera.Thankfully, Arepera did not let me down. I got a beef and a chicken arepa. Both were incredible, particularly the beef one. Although the arepas themselves were incredible, what really put this place in the 5 star category were the sauces. Sauces will make or break any meal and thankfully they made it here. They have a green, herby  sauce and a red hot(ish) sauce. A little drizzle of each will go a long way. And by a little, I mean a lot.We got here about a half hour after it opened on a weekday and this place was already packed, so I knew from the start it was going to be good.

We also ordered a side of plantains. All I have to say is ... wow! The portions are large, the arepas are stuffed to the brim, and the flavors are on point. Served with a delicious avocado sauce and a (very spicy) hot sauce, these really hit the spot. I found myself drowning every bite with avocado sauce.

/user_details?userid=FFFeLM5rk29RZn6FmGlHYQ,Geraldine G.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"For the fresh faced, wide-eyed tourist to Montreal, this place definitely tests your linguistic skills and culture shock. It was amazing to me to hear French first, Spanish - and then English.   Mind you, they speak English everywhere in Montreal but on my first day here, it was still taking some adjusting to.This is a small Venezuelan restaurant with a family run feel. Food focused with homeland inspired decor are what you will notice upon walking in.  Give yourself a few moments and your ears will be filled with house mixes of every single famous Latin singer you can think of. I loved it! The main focus is the arepa.  Something I first heard of on an episode of Bobby Flays Throw down (he lost).  It is a South American bread made of corn not flour so are an excellent gluten free option.  They can be grilled, baked or fried. The exterior tends to be on the crunchier side while the interior has a more gritty, texturized interior.I chose the stewed chicken arepa and my friend had the shark arepa. (As a side note, the menu is also in English).  I was most curious to try the shark.  They are presented stuffed into the arepa with a side  watercress salad. Hot sauce and avocado dressing/sauce to flavour.The shark tasted like, well, fish. I had no idea what I was expecting but it certainly tasted flatter than my expectation.  It was flaky like canned tuna.  Same with the chicken arepa which incidentally drips like crazy. Be warned if you are wearing something light. It is messy.The cassava chips were crispy and even better with the addictive avocado dip. The avocado sauce was an incredible surprise to me! I don't like avocado and however they make this stuff, made me love it.  I can still taste it.  So good!Incredibly inexpensive, friendly people and quick service. You really can't go wrong in trying something different."

Decent pricesNow the bad:We were 4 people who made it a point to try as many different things as possible to get a broad sense of the menu. Overall we ordered the plantains, empanadas, and yuca sticks as appetizers - the plantains and yuca sticks were flavorless which was sad because we've had amazing yuca sticks and plantains at other restaurants. For our mains, we ordered 4 different  sandwiches: chicken avocado because we were told it was a best seller, beef avocado, chicken plantain bean, and one more I can't remember. They ALL fell flat. Everyone at our table was disappointed - the food looked amazing but it stopped there. Also, it was really hard to sit there when it was close to 30C outside because there's no air conditioning. It's not really conducive to a good dinner atmosphere when everyone is sweating bullets and counting down the minutes to leaving. We even had one member of our group step out early to go sit in his air conditioned car because it was that hot....We sadly won't be back."

We sat on a bench waiting for our name. The wait was worth it. The choices of meals was what I expected. I had the chorizo plate and a side of chips with avocado sauce.  The plate came with rice and beans, fried plantains, and peppers and onions mixed with the chorizo. A side of feta cheese could be placed on the beans for taste.  A piece of flat bread came with the meal.  You could taste each ingredient. I made the misstep of putting my cheese on the chorizo. The feta would have yielded to the other ingredients better if I mixed it and melted it in with the beans.We opted for jugo de mango (mango juice).  It tasted fresh prepared.While some restaurants want to provide you with new food combinations in an effort to peak your interest, this place manages to provide you with better than your mother makes favorites.  You don't have to question the food pairings at this place."

Look no more, this is the place to try them and enjoy them.They have a wide variety for all palettes, including for those that are vegetarians. Arepas are also glunten-free.Their arepeas are done to perfection! Tender, soft, warm and full of flavour depending what the filling you decide to try. I would suggest either the pulled pork or chicken.You may think $7.00-$9.00 for one arepa could be pricey. Not at all. Arepas in general are quite filling since it's mainly made with white corn flour, always by hand. Hence why these arepas are perfectly done! Along with a generous filling of your choice.Do remember to ask for their guacamole sauce, it's fantastic!! Or if you like a little zing, they do bring you a sauce with a kick.As the restaurant is quite small, go early or go late in the day.  Their service was friendly and outstanding, our food arrived within ten minutes after ordering, while the restaurant was packed."

We were seated right away (we came in around 4 or 5pm roughly? So an early dinner and before the dinner rush) and while service was a little slow (there were other people getting their food and it looked like there was only one MAYBE two waitresses working at the time), the wait was worth it!I had the Carne Mechada arepa and my friend had the Pollo Guisado arepa. Both dishes came with a simple salad with an avocado dressing. We also ordered a appetizer of fried plantains. For dessert I had the coconut flan and she had a plantain cheesecake.

This is more a review of her business ethics than the food because we never got to taste any! We waited 20 minutes to be seated outside in the cold - not a big deal the place is small. She came and took our order and we proceeded to watch table after table that was seated after us receive their food, pay, and leave. 45 minutes went by and the waitress didn't come back to the table once. Finally we flagged someone else down because it was impossible to get her attention. We saw the person we spoke with go and speak with our waitress behind the counter and she looked over at us and then pointed at the kitchen. We thought she would come over and explain there had been a mistake and she was sorry. Instead she just continued ignoring us. After 10 more minutes we got up and politely asked what was happening. At this point we had been sitting at a table with nothing but a water carafe for an hour. She said in the rudest voice, ""there was a system error, they are making your food now."" I told her it was fine, I wasn't mad, we were just going to leave and she started yelling at me that they already started making it and there was a system error. I love arepas and I'm incredibly forgiving of errors - they happen and its happened to me before - but you need to communicate with your customers and you certainly shouldn't be yelling at me for your mistake. It was honestly the rudest and worst experience I've had at a restaurant, and I live in NYC so that's saying a lot."

My favorite was the hot, however the ""green"" sauce mustn't be discounted by any stretch.My personal favorite was the boar chorizo arepa, which during my stay was switched to a regular pork chorizo to allow it to be gluten free. The boar had a cerveza marinade in it. Tastes pretty much the same if I'm honest. Others loved the 3 cheese, the shredded chicken with tomato and pork/bean. They also had these massive plates that had rice, plantanos, meat & possibly slices of avocado. Loads of good, savory home style cooking (not that I could come up with this at home), but it tastes like it comes from a home kitchen. In summary, go there. Support local."

After narrowing down, the options: I settled on a vegan choice of tomato, avocado, coriander, and lemon and added some delicious cheese (recommendation from the server!) Totally filling, totally delicious, my friends chose the chorizo sandwich, and another the same as me with added beef. We also ordered the Yuca chips and guacamole sauce.

There tends to be a bit of a wait when you get there but their system is efficient so it doesn't take to long. The menu is simple and delightful - if you don't get their yuca chips + avocado sauce you're making a life mistake. If you go at around 7pm there is a live musician who plays latino music and sings with this beautiful soulful voice. It's a quick service and the waiters and sweet. The prices are an icing on the cake. Advice: make sure you get the avocado and spicy sauce for your arepera; adding an extra squeeze of sauce after every few bites is integral to the experience! (warning the spicy sauce is SPICY!)

/user_details?userid=wazWs5WpW2lSzvYkkmP9yA,Rebecca C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The ""Arepa"" is something between a corn tortilla and a slice of bread, probably best described as a slightly leavened corn pancake. They are used as the ""bread"" in your delicious Latin sandwich filled with your choice of toppings that include carne machada (shredded beef), cheese, black bean, plantain, avacado, or even more exciting filling like smoked pork chops or shark. Arepera du Plateau has lots of vegetarian and vegan options too, which is good news for a devoted omnivore with a vegetarian partner, such as myself!This was my first-ever arepa, but my partner has sampled them before elsewhere -- he praised the light fluffiness of these Plateau arepas, and I agree that there's a wonderful, filling, comfort-food quality to these fluffy flatbreads. Unsurprisingly, the owner told us that these were indeed the comfort food of his native Venezuela: his family eats them every day. We were both waddling out after eating a combined total of four areperas, plus delicious dessert.If I have one thing I'd change about the arepas, it's that I found them a bit dry or overly simple with only a few ingredients each; perhaps I'm too used to North American sandwiches loaded with lettuce, tomato, and mayo. I highly recommend the sauces, which you can get at your table for asking; the tangy avocado sauce is quite good and if you are interested in spicy, the chili sauce will shoot steam out your ears. Personally I was happy that the fare was quite mild, but the aforementioned partner likes steam shooting from his ears."

/user_details?userid=bKp_24TsX3kVE6smHmEdrg,Rafael H.,"Miami Beach, FL",5 star rating,"Born in Venezuela though a Chicago resident, I've seen my fair share of Venezuelan areperas and restaurants. This one is by far the best food I've had outside of Venezuela. I had La llanera which had a delicious pulled pork filling, stuffed with cheese and avocados. I also had the smoked salmon arepa. Both were large portions and reasonably priced. I should have only done one but I had to try more than one.They come with a light salad. Make sure you add the avocado sauce.... a staple in Venezuelan cuisine. The atmosphere brought me memories of my childhood back in Venezuela....filled with music and a laid back ambience.I wish there was a restaurant like this back in Chicago. In the mean time, this will be a for-sure stop next time I'm in Montreal."

We were huge fans of the original location and to be honest I was a little scared that with this new, way bigger space the quality of the food would drop dramatically just as what happened when AUx Vivres went big a few years ago. We went on opening night and aside the fact that the furniture was arranged very strangely in a way that wastes a huge number of benches to a very strange alley way in the middle that I suppose wants to be reminiscent of a church (when the chairs at the dining tables could be replaced by those benches that no one will ever sit on....) everything was good. The sauces are magnificent, the avocado garlicky and creamy and delicious, the spicy sauce is beautifully fragrant and delicious. The plantains in my sandwich tastes like they had been fried an hour or two before but given that it was their very first night opening in the new locale and there was an insane snow storm out we will give them a free pass for that one time and give them time to get settled in the new space. Long story short Arepera your food is BOOOMB please make sure the quality matches the original location. Love you thanks"

He talked me into coming there to eat the next night and I'm glad I did.I'm a vegetarian and South American food is not generally vegetarian friendly, but Arepera du Plateau is an exception. There were at least ten vegetarian arepas, plus at least one vegetarian entry. On the recommendation of the waitress, I ordered the arepas filled with garlic mushrooms. They were excellent. The arepa was crisp and tasty, and the mushrooms succulent. I also had plantains and a fruit juice made from a Colombian fruit, lulu, recommended by my waitress.

No alcohol but they have juices  that are traditional to Columbia / Venezuela. I prefer a place that I can have a few drinks, talk with friends, order a few plates to share - this is not a sharing plates kind of place and as long as you know that before you go you can plan accordingly. I wasn't sure what to expect having never been there, and while I was happy with my sandwich and salad it was a quick meal.

Nothing was under or over salted -even the arepa dough was perfect. The quantity of food left me blissfully satisfied. Servers were also really nice and gave tips.

My friend and I couldn't help but notice how much fun it seemed like everyone working in this restaurant was having.  I loved the little touches like the board with the 'word of the week' in English, French and Spanish, and the kitschy, brightly colored fun decor.  I also loved the piles of fresh ingredients by the counters - plantains, avocados, cassava. Very cool. The menu is pretty complete - for those that are unaware, an arepa is a gluten-free cornbread sandwich. The menu is laid out with meat, vegetarian and vegan options all clearly marked.  Prices are very reasonable, and the selection of options is great. They had, when I was there, 4 kinds of fresh juices, one of which I recognized (mango). I opted for lulu, a kind of colombian fruit I had never heard of and had a shark and plantain arepa. We also shared the cassava chips.  The arepas come with avocado sauce (yum!) and hot sauce (yes, it is hot), as well as a small watercress salad. For two arepas, cassava chips and a juice, the total was $24 after tax but pre-tip. I will say that although our service was excellent, and the owner offered us a free dessert (I have no idea what it was but it was tasty!) for no particular reason, I did notice a customer that came after us waiting quite a long time without attention. I'm guessing service here is a bit hit or miss."

The atmosphere is cozy, fun and homey and our waitress was a real gem, extremely friendly and helpful. The piles of avocados, plantains, cassavas and other produce in front of the counter were very charming. Don't forget to get an order of plantains!My friend and I sampled a #1 which was a stewed beef/black been/plantain arepa, which was reeeeally good, but probably the heaviest of the three arepas that we ended up gorging on. We also had a #6 (sorry, I can't remember the names) which was like a creamy chicken salad with avocado. It was good, but not fantastic. The best one, however, was the chicken chorizo arepa that we ordered as our round 2. Our meal was served with a hot sauce and an avocado sauce, both which were very tasty.My only gripes... and I reaaaaally hate to even bring these up because I like them and I want them to do well... is that there is one older fellow there who had dirty fingernails, came out of the bathroom zipping up his fly, and kept us waiting at the cash register while he tinkered with the restaurant's iPod. I wish I didn't have to write this, but I can't get it out of my mind. Thankfully, I did not see him involved in any food prep so... maybe I can forgive it. I think? I guess?Regardless, I will probably be back because I liked the food and it was super affordable and the staff is extremely friendly!Oh and by the way. The tres leches dessert is TO DIE FOR."

I ordered the guasacaca arepa (avocados, onions, tomatoes, lemon, coriander) and it came loaded with avocados! It also comes with a watercress salad, which I don't think the menu mentions. Food comes with two hot sauces, a milder avocado-based one and a spicier one that I couldn't handle. I ended up smothering my already avocado-ladened arepa in avocado sauce and then used it as salad dressing. The sauce is that good! I also ordered the side of platanos, which comes with six nicely sized slices fried to perfection and some white cheese that I didn't eat because I'm lactose intolerant. My friends all enjoyed their foods as well, and one even ordered a second serving of his arepa. We left feeling extremely full and satisfied.The restaurant itself is brightly decorated, and I loved the cozy, relaxed ambience.

/user_details?userid=wNgCoH8qlfTxAV_z11wGYQ,Adam V.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,I was a little disappointed on my last visit to Areperas... I ordered number 31 which is a vegan arepas under the vegan list on the menu. This comes with the regular salad that comes with every sandwich. Well my arepas was vegan but I started eating my salad and realized the avocado sauce was a little creamy. I asked the waitress and it turns out that there is mayonnaise in the avocado sauce. Why the heck would they list something on the menu as being vegan when in fact the entire dish is not at all vegan. It makes no sense. I tried to explain this to the waitress but they don't get it. I wonder  how many vegans ate the vegan dish and didn't realize it's not completely vegan. The waitress took my salad and didn't bring me back another salad without the sauce. I had to ask. Lack of common sense. In general the food is okay and the waitresses are nice. The portions are kind of small in general. I will not go back.

As the name suggests, the emphasis is on arepas, which are offered up in a variety of combinations can satisfy omnivores, vegetarians and vegans alike. Arepas can be ordered a la carte with salads and sides or as platers (either way only 1 arepa is needed for most people). They don't serve alcohol (I would love if this also changed!) but they do offer a range of fruit drinks which are good ... a little sweet for my taste but good.While never feeling rushed, the overall experience is all pretty quick (even at peak times). For this reason I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for an ""evening out"" destination ... it's more along the lines of a grabbing something good to eat without all the frills. I'm already thinking of the next visit and trying to figure out what's in that green sauce!  TIP: If the tables are full, even if there's a few people in line waiting, wait. The tables turn relatively quickly."

I have had arepas in the past and they weren't any better than just simply meh! This place is something completely different! Upon dining at Arepera I discovered that whatever it was that I tried those other times were simply not arepas. ¡¡Arepas, arepas, arepas, my newfound love!! Arepas are soft on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside, they are sort of in between corn pancakes and corn tortillas; grilled to golden perfection, it is used as the most perfect pillow for your filling of choice to rest it's weary self. This arepa is lulled into a serene slumber -- or more like a slumber party in your mouth. The soft subtle taste and pillowy comfort of the arepa combined with the golden crisp works off and riffs with the avocado, feta and black beans to create a cacophony of flavour that no person can resist. The yuca chips and avocado sauce are an excellent start to your meal. Also, don't miss up the chance to try one or all of their excellent freshly squeezed exotically tropical fruit juices. ¡Welcome to Venezuela!"

But boy oh boy was I ever wrong! The food was amazing, the fresh juice bar was amazing, and the ambiance was awesome. We sampled both the Vegan and meat plates which fully satisfied our hunger and left us wanting more, not because there wasn't plenty of food, but because it was just so delicious! Classic Latin music plays from a single speaker above the bar setting the perfect mood. Service is quick, home made sauces are magic on your tongue, and the price tag is cheap. If you're in Montreal you have to go check this place out!"
/user_details?userid=m4zWPtidGTzLbbS_BKPQ_w,R K.,"Saint-Lazare, Canada",5 star rating,"Visited this restaurant as it was highly rated. I'm happy to say that we were not disappointed in any way. The venue itself is small and quaint. The decor is unpretentious but very colourful as one might expect for a South American themed restaurant.  Nothing about the place feels contrived in anyway, in fact the first impression that we got was that we were in for an authentic Venezuelan culinary experience, especially after the wonderful all pervading aroma from the kitchen wafted into our noses. Our party of two, arrived for an early dinner and had no problems getting seated at this popular venue,  although I could imagine people having to queue down the street as the evening got on as it was quite full by the time we left. Arepas are of course their specialty.  These 100% gluten free homemade corn tortilla sandwiches look small but they are actually extremely filling. They come with a small side salad. I'm a big guy and I certainly would not need to order more then one. We shared the #2 (beef, beans, plantain, feta cheese) and #10 (chicken, avocado, feta). They were both excellent!!! I couldn't decide which was better.We also ordered the house made yuca chips as a starter. These are like potato chips but much lighter. They're served with a guacamole dip which was actually perfect.  The same dip is also provided with the arepas along with another spicy one which neither of us really cared for as the heat was too overpowering. The service was very friendly and efficient. As we devoured our sandwiches, a Venezuelan guitar player started to serenade the patrons with his renditions of various LatinAmerican classics. His easy smile and good humour was extremely contagious and before long everyone including the staff was taking part in the fun. At one point we stepped outside for some fresh air and we had the pleasure of meeting the owner/head chef Max who was taking a break. It was nice to get to know the man behind the restaurant. He related how he and his family arrived to Montreal and how he appreciated the multi cultural aspect of  the city and openness of its people.  He explained how above all his goal in opening the restaurant was to share with others his own cultural identity the best way he knows how, by cooking up fresh and authentic meals from his home country. Based on our experience I would say he exceeded his goals. We are very much looking forward to our next visit."

I came to this place with a friend because I read the review on The Gazette I was truly disappointed. I ordered a pabellon with chicken and my guest a pabellon with cazon (shredded shark), plus a mango juice and a guanabana (soursop) juice. The food was tasteless, boiled rice without a trace of onion, garlic, bell pepper or even salt...the black beans they seemed to be straight from the can and reheated, again no spicy flavor at all..the shark was more like canned tuna (as far as I know shark is a very expensive fish, so they should be charging more than 11 dollars for this so they can make some profit, which means that either they are losing money by serving shark, or the shark IS canned tuna)...the juices were watery, in substance and flavor, not a hint of sweetness, the only thing that we actually enjoyed were the tajadas (slices of fried ripe plantain, served with grated cheese).The service was OK, I asked the waiter for tajadas and he had no clue of what I was ordering, which means he's not Venezuelan, but I must say that he was friendly even if a bit slow.Unfortunately this was not a happy culinary experience, I lived in Venezuela for several years and I know what Venezuelan food is like, an exotic mixture Spanish cuisine with tropical accents, lots of garlic, onions, bell pepper, aji dulce, cumin, annato, I know that rice is boiled with a bit of oil, garlic, salt and a bell pepper to give it some flavor, I know what caraotas (black beans) are like, and cazon means cazon, not canned tuna. I have to say that  this place gives Venezuelan food a bad reputation, maybe they can get away with it because most of people in Montreal have not been exposed to Venezuelan food and don't know what real Venezuelan food tastes like... I lived in Venezuelan and quite honestly, I feel shortchanged. Perhaps I should get a copy of Mi Cocina by Armando Scanone and leave it at the counter.And by the way, those joropos are way too loud and prevent customers from having a conversation without yelling at each other"
/user_details?userid=LHlKkrkppF-HIV3MOqAKcQ,Margaret M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I really wanted to like this place but found the food mediocre and overpriced. My friend and I tried two items from the vegan menu (the guacamole and the grilled veg arepas). They cost $8-$8.50 each and we were both underwhelmed and still hungry after eating them. Also, even though we ordered off the vegan menu, the arepas came with tiny side salads that were topped with a mayo dressing. When we explained that we didn't eat mayo they replaced them with two plain salads (just lettuce). I would only return here if the arepas were about half the price, or at least included more substantial sides."

It did take a while, but it was very worth it when it did arrive. The service lacked a bit, but where the speed fell short the friendliness of the staff more than compensated for the wait.  The food was very flavorful and the atmosphere was very welcoming. I will definitely go back next time I'm in Montreal."

/user_details?userid=7ovIbuRLCzws1qVMUSY9CQ,Stephen H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"First timer with my wife...date night looking for a new experience. There was a line outside the door and the very friendly owner said 15 minutes and we were inside in about 5. Reviews were bang on and we took the recommended Yucan chips (hot and awesome) with the avocado sauce. Wife wanted a salad which was fresh greens/watercress/cilantro/tomatoes/onions... Excellent compliment to the guilt inducing chips. My Arepera sandwhich was shredded chicken breast with avocado sauce and my wife had the sardine Arepera. Both fresh/hot and extremely tasty with the 2 bottles put on the table of more avocado sauce and a very hot but tasty hot sauce. They also came with a small salad, same as we had as an appetizer. No regrets but next time will have a different 2nd appetizer. Very friendly and professional service throughout. The Columbia/Brazil soccer game was on the radio and the table next to us were very excited Columbian fans, who apologized for their energy. When we told them no reason to, we made new friends and got insight into the tournament. We will definitely return. Price was fair and in addition to a type of food we don't make at home it felt like a Latin American vacation right in the heart of Montreal."

/user_details?userid=h9__XVzkCWGV8ZP03s4JbQ,Amanda S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I don't know about authenticity, since I have never had an arepa or Venezuelan cuisine before my recent visit to the Arepera du Plateau, but I am really glad that I checked it out. I never write reviews and I made sure to come write one for this place because it deserves it. I went on a Sunday, and the place was packed, with a list on the door to sign your name to wait for a table. I was getting take-out, so this wasn't really my concern. I went up to the counter not sure what to order, but I am a meat-eater and have no allergies so I'm down for anything so long as it is delicious/interesting-tasting. I noted that there was a fresh fruit bar to the left of the take-out counter, with traditional South American fruit flavors (mango, lulo, and some others). I asked the man at the counter what he'd recommend, and he said that if I eat meat, the #1, called the Papellon or something similar, is a good call because it's a mix of interesting flavors. It had beef, cheese, black beans, and plantains. The food was good, and the portion huge, and after tax came to about 10 dollars. So all in all a decent price for food in Montreal.The customer service is the reason I will go back though, besides it being quite close to my apartment in the Plateau. The man at the counter greeted me with a genuine and warm smile and seemed eager to help me pick something that I would like. I waited outside for my takeout with my receipt, and because two people got their food before me, the girl who came outside to bring me my food insisted that I come inside to get a free order of freshly made juice because I waited ""so long."" I didn't consider it a huge wait, and was really surprised at this gesture on the restaurant's part. When I went inside she made sure I tried every flavor of juice before picking one (I chose lulo because I don't normally have access to that flavor). This type of customer service and the loads of happy guests inside this quaint little restaurant with its adorable decor is what makes my night. I left with a huge smile and the food was great. It was messy to eat while reading, but well worth the short walk and the fair prices. I will definitely go again, and will try to sit down the next time I go so my arepa won't be soggy when I eat it (from sitting in the paper while I walk home)."
