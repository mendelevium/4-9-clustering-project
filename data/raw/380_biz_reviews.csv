Foxy is an amazing restaurant, we love the Mediterranean inspired menu. Grilled and wood stoved baked food. We love the simplicity and the high quality ingredients they offer. Now they adaptes the menu for takeout, we love the simple instructions and the experience of Foxy at home. Highly recommended"
/user_details?userid=iVXISIgh-unsJz57-qOHTQ,Sheryl L.,"Candiac, Canada",4 star rating,"I would give this place a 3.5 star. Cute place, I love the low lighting gives the ambiance a more relaxed feeling. The layout of the restaurant needs work. It was pretty packed when I went, the tables were pretty close to each other so sometimes it was a little awkward to manoeuvre out to the washroom. When you want out you would most likely make something fall from the table right beside from how close the tables were to each other. I ordered the Chipotle and lime ceviche and the homemade feta with pita bread and squash. The ceviche was delicious the breadcrumbs really helped level up the taste of the dish.The homemade feta was ok, definitely missing some taste and flavour.For the main course we order the grilled porc chop and the grilled arctic char. I was happy with the porc chops it was a good sized portion, the crème fresh mash was very  light and fluffy. I could have done with less white bean vinaigrette, it had a very strong taste. I was impressed by the Arctic char, the skin was very well grilled crispy skin but soft on the inside without having a burnt taste. For dessert we had the chocolate caramel mousse and the apple crumble tart. The chocolate caramel mousse was Devine. The piece of toffee really elevated the whole thing. Not sure if I would go again. The food was average and underwhelming."

Or server was absolutely kind, fantastic, attentive in ways that was both embarrassing and appreciative (I must have been chewing that gum like a freaking ravage for him to discreetly offer me a napkin so I could spit it out. Thank you? haha). He was overall super nice, gave absolutely great recommendations and definitely did his job well and seriously. I'm a sucker for a good server. To eat, we share the hanger steak (WOWZA!! Absolutely PHENOMENAL!). The accompanying salad was fantastic and the potatoes even more ravishing. Overall the meal was SUBLIME and definitely more than enough for 3 people to share.To drink, we had a Hungarian wife (my cuzzo's beau is Hungarian). Though I couldn't remember the name even if I didn't try, I can remember that it was very tasty! Also, did you know that not only are they female owned, but the majority of their staff is female. YYAAASSSS to female empowerment! Also helped that I had just been in Toronto for a conference that is entirely focused on female leadership (International Women's Forum, look it up). Will I be back? Absolutely! With my future husband, that is."
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A definite well deserved 5* for this gem. It has been on my restaurant bucket list for some time and finally made it there over the weekend. For the appetizer, we ordered their famous flatbread and coleslaw. Both were absolutely delicious and brought to a whole gourmet dimension. As much as I love Moishe's coleslaw, this one was the polar opposite with a variety of flavours which blended perfectly. Both a must try! For the main, we ordered gnocchis and the hanger steak. Again, both were heavenly and cooked to perfection. We were so full that we had no room for desserts which I am sure would have been nothing less than perfect.A memorable experience, definitely worth the visit!!!"
/user_details?userid=FPv27CkYLodbfz3gj5Fnkg,Tony Y.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Another recommendation for another off the beaten path restaurant. Beautiful decor with an amazing bartender. I went with the local favorites - charred cauliflower and hanger steak. The cauliflower was amazing. It was salty at times but that's how it should be. I can see how some may not like it. The steak was perfectly cooked but may I say, the vegetables were amazing on this dish. I know, who am I and why would I ever say that?!It's okay, the food was great and the drinks even better. Sit at the bar, it's more fun that way. You'll even make some friends, which I did."

We make a trip to Montreal every year to explore and eat. This was our first time here and it did not disappoint. Cozy space with an open kitchen. The room is not huge but they did a great job making it not feel small. The service was phenomenal our waitress was attentive and helped guide us through the menu. Cocktails from the bar were great. I had the sea bream ceviche which was a great way to start the meal it hit all the right notes. The wood charred hanger steak was great, cooked perfectly. Great sear on the exterior perfect medium rare on the inside. Wine list was really good, some great bottles at reasonable prices. High quality food in a cool room with great service, you can't ask for better. Will definitely be back next time I'm in town."
/user_details?userid=oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,Rod U.,"Pearl City, HI",4 star rating,"MUST TRY MONTREAL FOOD:  OPEN FIRE COOKINGOpen hearth ablaze with burning hardwood charcoal.  The hiss of dripping fat.  The aroma of roasting meat.   Squashes and veg, being charred, their sugars and flavors being concentrated.  The smell of sweet smoke perfuming the cold night air. Farm to table, naturally foraged, a commitment to small local producers yielding quality artisanal products.  It's all here.Short menu of simple and unpretentious good eats.  Start with any flat bread the offer.  Baked on embers.  Very similar to the pizzas of Naples with its blistered crust and burnt bits add bitter complexity.  Crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside.A slaw of charred romanesco, greens, and shredded duck with a celeriac puree a refreshing way to open.  The ingredients combine to create a vegital, earthy, hints of bitterness with a background of sweetness.   Meat and fire are natural bedfellows so...Hanger steak.  Cooked normal (mid rare).  Smoky, lightly charred sear finished with sea salt.    Tender, clean beefy taste.  The accompanying side, a warm tomato salad.  The smoky, grilled beef works with its acidity to ready the palate for more.The 60 day dry aged rib steak, equally impressive.  Trimmed while retaining some fat cap that has blistered and crisped beautifully being licked by fire.  Typical of Canadian beef, the flavor is milder than its US counterpart.  Not as much funk and bleu cheese aroma and flavor but works much better with the smoke making it sweeter.Small but well chosen wine list.  Old world producers.Service is very friendly helping to maintain the charm of the restaurant.The oldest method of cooking works.  It just works."

We shared the peach and feta starter which was perfect, and contained probably the only decent peaches I've had this summer.  The house made pita that came with it was hot, delicious, and brushed with butter. My husband got the gnocchi and cleaned his plate. Clearly it was as good as our server said it would be. I had the hangar steak which was perfectly cooked and the heirloom tomato salad that came with it was incredible. For dessert we got the strawberry frozen yogurt topped with roasted and fresh strawberries and crumbled meringue. That frogurt was to die for. Apparently, it's made with two parts fruit, one part yogurt and that's what makes it so good.  Our server was friendly and the patio was perfect. Foxy, I will return for another magical evening with you."

We were greeted kindly and the service was top notch throughout the evening.My husband and I were under the weather so we didn't have any drinks so we dived into the food right away.For starters we had the pork and lamb meatballs. It was delicious and the only con is that the serving was tiny for sharing. For entrees, we had the hanger steak and the SEABASS. Both were amazing but again the Seabass was just mind blowing. For dessert, we had the pot du creme and apple tart. Both were amazing but I liked the apple tart more because it came with vanilla ice cream.This place is a gem and I can't wait to come back the next time we visit Montreal."

This restaurant should be Czech. Here's why: great ambiance? Check. Great service? Check. Great music (not live)? Check. And drumroll...great food? Double check. Now here's the thing. Just order the Ribeye. It's their thing and it's freaking unbelievable. Best meal we've had in Montréal. Pricey yes. But it's enough for two hungry guys or three moderately hungry people. We also had the gnocchi main course split as an appetizer and it was amazing. Another check. Put this on your must visit list and then check it off. You'll be soooo happy you did.

I always read the only the bad ones to see if the critics seem fair.The common thread on Foxy's poor reviews are that they are salt heavy. Most of these reviews were old so I had hoped they fixed the issue.Last week for my Anniversary we went to Foxy. The ambiance and service were fantastic. We shared a Flatbread, Salty. My wife had the trout, Salty and I had the hanger steak, Salty!The Desert was fine and the only dish not overpowered by salt.In an area where there are so many choices, I cannot recommend Foxy."

This place is worth every penny and it is rare when I love every single bite of every single dish. One noticeable trait of Foxy is that everything is perfectly prepared: cooked exactly how it should be - why can't everywhere do this?! Lobster with almond breadcrumbs to start - fresh, buttery, and tender. I had the fish of the day and partner had the steak. Both had delicious sauces that complimented the main with veggie sides that tasted incredibly fresh. Well prepared food, fresh ingredients, and good service - what more could a girl ask for?? Instagram worthy window sign? Oh yeah, they got that too :)"

First, despite reservations, we were given seats at the bar. To me, seats at the bar are for walk ins. Not people with reservations. Drinks and small plates were tasty. My main entree I had an issue with. My sea bass had a very nice presentation, but the skin was too heavily salted. The sauce did cut it a bit. Yet it was just too much salt. Restraint was needed with the sodium."

/user_details?userid=Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A definite place to spend date night or to show off with an out-of-town guest. Service on the night of my visit was stellar; wonderful wine and food suggestions, attentive but not overbearing.We started with a fruity Italian white wine, the name escapes me but it was recommended by out sever and perfectly suited our tastes. We started with the cod and the clam appetizers, which were restrained in size but not in taste. The cod had an acidic hit in the light sauce adorning the smashed cucumbers and peanuts, complemented by a touch of heat. The clams were bathed in a tomato-based sauce, with a bed of farro and a slight crunch from almond bread crumbs. We also shared a 75-day aged rib steak for 2, which was grilled to a medium-rare temperature, which is exactly how it should be served. It was accompanied by savory smashed potatoes cooked in duck fat and rosemary. Every bite of the meal was on point, so for all these reasons I have to give my first 5 star review this year."
/user_details?userid=1Bljt-GngRP4XxkQFLnHHQ,Rod M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Foxy is a classy low key restaurant in Griffintown. The restaurant is small and cozy so don't be surprised if you are seated at the bar, as this must make up 30% of the total seating in the restaurant. Foxy is not the place to come and be seen, it is the place to come and enjoy amazingly well prepared food. The menu is short and thoughtful. Each ingredient has been carefully selected and the result is amazing flovour in every bite. Everything is cooked in a wood burning stove or over a charcoal grill adding a wonderful flavour and aroma to the food and it should be noted an extra degree of difficulty for the chef.  We've been lucky enough to eat here on a number of occasions now, and each time I feel that the food is better than the last. Then I think back and remember clearly how my mind was blown over the food the time before and in the end can never really decided which experience was best. A couple of visits ago I had messed up our reservation, I made it for the wrong week so the only place they had for us was at a small corner at the chef's bar. As it turned out this is one of the best seats in the house. We got to watch all night as Chef, Leigh Roper, ran her kitchen to precision, managing every order carefully and working shoulder to shoulder with her team over the open flame of the charcoal grill. It was a lot of fun to see and added a real level of appreciation for the work, and sweat, that goes into each and every plate. Some of our favortie things to order include, Starter: the flatbreads are mind blowing, last night we had to order a second of the tomato and mozzarella topped flatbread as it was so dam good,  home made feta; Mains: you must try the ribs and gnocchi; Side: be sure to order the yams with spicy mayo and the corn that we had yesterday was terrific. Really, no matter what you order you can't go wrong. Everything that we have had has been terrific. Foxy is definitely our favorite new spot! And a must for anyone who enjoys great food. Here are a couple of key points to manage your expectations:- Do expect to sit at the bar. It is a small restaurant and this is part of their core seating area (reservations are also highly recommend) - Don't expect a Griffintown party scene atmosphere;- Do expect to enjoy some of the best and most flovourful food around;- Do expect to spend your money, this is an expensive restaurant;- Don't expect enormous portions. Foxy is about quality not quantity;- Do expect to come home smelling a bit like a campfire (particularly if you are seated towards the back). The ventilation in the restaurant is excellent, as you don't notice any smoke while you are there, but they are cooking over an open wood flame so the aroma will linger on your clothing; and - Do expect to relax and enjoy! I'm honestly surprised to see that Foxy does not have an across the board 5 star rating on Yelp as it provides one of the best authentic quality food experience in Montreal,"

/user_details?userid=cdFXJZoua1O8crvxCgOLTA,Or H.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Dark, cozy atmosphere - the smell of the wood burning fire makes you feel like you're in a (very stylish) cabin. Service is above average, attentive without over checking on you, with a sense of humor. Great natural wines by the glass. We had a unique orange wine. Shared the carrot and home made feta with a pita made in the over that is what actual dreams are made of. For my main, had the delicious vegetarian gnocchi with chanterelles - so yummy, with a good density and bright, lemony sauce to keep it fresh.We had some pre-dinner drinks and apps elsewhere so will need to come back to try more and have some dessert, which sounded amazing."

I had the pork chop, which came on sweet potatoes. I ate every bit of it! My wife had the hangar steak with tomatoes. Our appetizer was wonderful, a house-made feta with pear sauce and a bit of light vinegar. We had a ""pot au creme"" (I think) for dessert, consisting of a light whipped chocolate cup, just the right amount after we'd gorged on the mai courses. The service staff were very helpful in wine selection and attentive."
/user_details?userid=8HafK5cS8pWCWNQTIG8iJw,Uyen D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Foxy opened only a few weeks ago in Griffintown and already it's so popular that walk-ins get turned away. Part of the hype is due to the fact that the owners also own the legendary cafe Olive & Gourmando in the Old Port, which is both a local and tourist favorite. Being a huge fan of O&G's simple but quality food and service, I was very excited to try Foxy.I went there on a Wednesday night. The service was very personable and efficient; I liked that our waitress was not pushy, and really gave us time to enjoy the entire experience. My friend and I shared the feta app, the artichoke flatbread, the bbq chicken and the charred greens. Everything was a delight. The homemade feta with tomatoes, grapes and almonds came out of the wood-oven piping hot. Since the owners are both professional bakers, I was not surprised at how amazing the flatbread was. It was the perfect side to scoop up the hot and heavily spiced feta. My only complaint is that the feta was a bit too salty, but it was so unique and tasty that it really didn't matter in the end. The marinated artichoke flatbread tasted great- they really have serious baking skills! The mortar andpestle romesco sauce on the chicken was also a highlight. So flavorful. But if I had to pick a favorite dish I would have to go with the charred greens. I know, sounds boring compared to the rest of the menu. I wouldn't have ordered it either if the waitress hadn't recommended it. But it ended up being smoky, bright, and simply fantastic.The team behind Foxy and O&G really prove that tasty and interesting food can be served in a beautiful and casual setting. Loved it and will definitely be back!"
/user_details?userid=j0tcQwuG9byNUAmPS2bqNQ,Nicole D.,"Oceanside, CA",2 star rating,"I have salty feelings about Foxy. I want to give it 2.5 stars but Yelp doesn't allow that. Our experience was 50/50. I was very excited to come here. We LOVE Olive & Gourmando and read so many 4star reviews about Foxy. We were prepared to be wowed. The person confirming our reservation was really accommodating and polite. We needed to change our arrival time at the last minute and he did this without question. We then arrived very early and he was still able to seat us immediately. The restaurant is dimly lit, modernly decorated and everyone is tightly packed in there. In order for the person next to us to leave, I had to get up from my seat and my husband had to pull out our table in order to make room for this tiny lady to exit. She still struggled as the table on the other side was also very close. Her backside slid several things around on the table. Luckily no-one sat there after that or we would have been interrupted again to move the table in order for people to get into their seat. The waitress immediately introduced us to the drink special of the night which was a $23 dollar beverage filled with syrups, muddled so on and so on's and alcohol. I have had drinks all over the world and have never heard of a $23 mixed drink that wasn't from a Tiki Bar served inside of a large fish bowl with many straws. No thank you. On to the food. The menu is small but covers all of the bases, Pork, Chicken, Fish, Red Meat. The common denominator here tho is SALT. We ordered the Roast Coquelet Rose des Vents. The waitress told us it takes 25 minutes for this young chicken to cook. Any dish that comes with a 25 minute wait should be pretty amazing.. It came with, ""decked-out honeynut squash, brown butter, maple syrup"". My husband said the chicken was, ""Good"", but salty. Good isn't a 25 minute, $34 young chicken. However, the squash blew our minds. I would pay that price for a double serving of the squash any day. It was a half of a honeynut squash topped with amazingly fragrant roasted spices and brown butter and syrup!! SOOO GOOD! The salad of red jalapeños and parsley was also refreshing and added a bit of a spicy kick. I had the Grilled Nagano Pork Chop that came with blistered sweet peppers, navy beans, and crème fraîche mash. The chop was huge, thick and sadly overcooked. I must say I requested it to be cooked without pink but not to the point that it was overdone. The chop was seasoned well but had a lot of salt! The blistered peppers were crunchy yet tender and had a nice roasted char flavor. The Mash was creamy and the sauce on it had layers of flavor but again the saltiness of it prevailed.  All in all, I must say we were underwhelmed by the main components of the dishes yet overwhelmed by the side components. The heavy handed use of salt as their main source of flavor pretty much ruined Foxy for us."
/user_details?userid=A7YlcidsiAZzU-tCSsrTSg,Anny T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Upon consulting Yelp for some restaurant recommendations in Griffintown, we stumbled upon Foxy with solid reviews. After looking through some photos online, I was pretty sold. I haven't been to Griffintown in awhile but I know there's a lot of hip and trendy food spots so I'm not holding much expectations.Good: the decor is sleek, sexy and hip (like your typical upscale hipster restaurant). The food was amazing, it's a bit of the pricey side, but definitely worth the splurge. Beautiful presentations and amazing flavours blended together with different textures, I was just amazed. The servers were very attentive and jovial, which in turn put me in a really good mood too. We had the Charred Cauliflower with yogurt to start (5/5), my boyfriend had the Hangar Steak (didn't try, as I do t eat meat) and I had the cavatelli (4.5/5, only because there wasn't a lot of oyster mushrooms in it...but it was rich and smooth, very hearty). The end the meal, we also had a Pistachio Cake. The pistachio ice cream was a nice touch to the strawberries in a light syrup on top of the fluffy cake.Bad: nada...the meal, staff, location, everything had been exceptional.Bottom line: definitely go try, the service is great and the food is even better. If you're a fan of creative flavours, this is the spot."

/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Location: In the Southwest, on Notre-Dame between Guy and Richmond. Street parking is available, but you'll probably find a spot more easily on St. Jacques. The subway is a pretty far walk so if you don't have a car then use Uber or a cab.The place: I'd say the decor seems to be in line with most of the other restaurants in this area - small, wood, dimly lit. Maybe you can see the kitchen. It's cozy but does get loud. The tables, as other reviewers have stated, are close together. We lucked out and got a 2-top against a wall, and had no one beside us. The goods: OK, well, I'm not going to sugarcoat; I had high hopes when I booked here. I wanted to love it, because I am a huge fan of Olive & Gourmando, their other restaurant. But they fell short on a few fronts. First, the main ingredient in ALL their dishes seems to be salt. I like salt - but I don't want to be chewing on it all night long. Let's begin with a breakdown of what we had.... first, we ordered cocktails - I don't remember the name but it had the word 'punch' in it. Delicious - we both really enjoyed this refreshing beverage. Since we wanted to go against the masses, we chose to share the Ceviche (chipotle & lime). I've had ceviche at various places, in different cities. I would be lying if I said that this was on par with any of them. It wasn't. First of all, I don't know what type of fish was being used other then to say it was a white fish. Secondly, the very first thing I tasted was salt. So much so, that it overpowered the taste of the fish (which, by the way, was non-existent). You could definitely taste the lime, and I think there was fresh coriander as well. That being said, while the blend of flavors had potential to be great, individually, they were simply too overpowering to make this dish a hit. There was also something crunchy that we couldn't identify, and while we didn't dislike it, it just didn't seem to mesh with everything else. Also, VERY small portion for the price. For mains, my friend ordered the lamb and I ordered the seafood bucatini. My friend enjoyed the lamb and felt that the portion was adequate for her. Was it worth the price point? I don't know, since I rarely eat meat and I never eat lamb.  On my end, the seafood bucatini was OK but not mind-blowing. I'm sure this comes down to preference, but..... having some Italian blood, and having eaten pasta here and in Italy, I can say that bucatini is just not the right kind of pasta to serve with seafood. I'm sorry - you don't serve tube pasta that you cannot even twirl up on your fork, while gathering a little bit of everything into one mouthful, with seafood. I mean, it wouldn't even stay on my fork, making my attempts to eat, annoyingly well, annoying. If you're going to do this right, I personally, would go with linguini. Anyway, moving on. I thought there were enough shrimp on the plate (and they were quite good) but not many clams (which I didn't really enjoy as much as the shrimp). In terms of flavor, well, I would describe it as lime with chili peppers. The dish was OK, but it was disappointing.  Finally, for dessert, we ordered the chocolate pot à la crème and the cheesecake with Québec strawberries. The pot was great - loved it! The cheesecake was just OK. Service: Indifferent. Our waitress was polite, but she wasn't attentive. Now, I certainly don't expect to get into lengthy, or personal conversations with wait staff - they have a job to do. But friendly chit chat while you're taking our order or stopping by to check in, would be nice. Price point: VERY expensive considering the portion sizes and also, the excessive use of stones that may or may not leave me with a few kidney stones with which to fondly remember my experience.  I gave this 3 stars because we liked the space, the cocktails and dessert were great, and the food was OK, but not great."
/user_details?userid=CTkGg0tikRzvGjrv4wHiSA,Fred F.,"Portland, ME",2 star rating,"Four of us dined this evening at Foxy.  The service was excellent but not at all prompt.  The food was extremely underwhelming.  The fish was seabass, 50CAD per plate was fishy, under seasoned and riddled with bones.  Two people in our party ordered this and neither was able to make it half way through the dish.  The pork chop was well seasoned but grossly overcooked.  The flat bread was ok, prompting the 2 stars instead of 1.  The value of this meal was terrible and we will not be returning."
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Special occasions call for a certain kind of restaurant. A place of intimacy and finesse with killer food and a certain coolness as well. We are lucky in Montreal to have many places that suit these criteria. For this particular occasion - My fiancé and I celebrating our anniversary - we chose to try a restaurant in our neighbourhood that I had been dying to try - Foxy.Located on the restaurant row that is Notre Dame Street in St-Henri and Little Burgundy, Foxy is the sister restaurant of Old Port staple bakery Olive+Gourmando. The space is long and narrow with an open kitchen about midway with lots of low lighting and a beautiful bar straight across. I had heard that the room could get very loud and noisy at times but we were there on a quiet night so that wasn't at all an issue.Foxy's menu works around grilling over a live fire or roasting in a wood-burning oven. The menu is smallish but every dish inspired interest from both of us. We first started with a couple of entrées. The winter coleslaw composed of brussel sprouts, savoy cabbage, apple, duck confit and celery root puree was a big hit for me. Beautiful presentation and a very hearty portion as a appetizer. The flavour of the duck came through primarily but each of the other element brought something nice in terms of flavours and texture. The addition of what seemed like a cider vinaigrette added a nice acidic kick to top it all off. Probably as great a winter salad as I have had.Our second dish was roasted cauliflower served with turmeric, zoug yogurt, fried shallots and almonds. Another hit for us - tons of flavours coming through with the roasted vegetable, the crunchy sweetness of the shallots, the heat of the turmeric and the coolness of the yogourt. Another hearty portion as well.The positive vibes continued through the main courses. I went with the herb sausage served with pecorino cheese, mashed potatoes, blackened brussel sprouts and house gravy. Delicious from beginning to end. The herb sausage was surprisingly spicy but the addition of the cheese paired well with that. The mash and gravy mix is always a good one and more lovely roasted sprouts didn't hurt either.My fiancé went with the charcoal grilled sea bass served with aioli and cucumber celery salad. The charred sea bass was beautiful and had such a great grilled flavour to it. Just add a little lemon and we're good. Even better though was the house aioli - great consistency and very strong flavour. Perfect complement to the fish. I don't care much for a cucumber salad but my fiancé loved it so we're good ;)Dessert options seemed wonderful - the chocolate bourbon brownie had me at hello - but the portions of our dishes were so generous that we were completely full and needed to pass.... Too bad but a good sign otherwise! Add to that great food very solid service throughout the night and we left Foxy very satisfied with our meal and our choice of venue for our occasion. We continued to get spoiled in Montreal for the quality of our restaurants. Foxy quickly made its way up our list of go-tos. The fact that we can walk to it from our place just makes it even better. Now I guess I should finally go to Olive+Gourmando now.....Cheers!"
/user_details?userid=Il9EB1SLBALhvp7GOVMokw,Rich B.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,Cute. We didn't venture into the main courses but grazed on small dishes - all were tasty and well made and balanced and all that. Except for the meatballs which were pretty forgettable. Cocktail list chock full of interesting things - my favorite bring their Black Dog; kind of a boulevardier with other Amaro in place of Campari. If I recall that correctly.

/user_details?userid=Cx25X2Q9yOfft6UC1h_5Lg,Jim J.,"Hoboken, NJ",4 star rating,"I really want to give this place 3.5 stars. After reading all of the reviews about Foxy, I knew it was a place I needed to try. I Made a reservation for 2 on Friday night at 9:15 with ease. In short, it was good, but I'm not sure it lived up to the hype.Atmosphere: Small and cozy are the two words that come to mind. It's a long and narrow building with lots of 2 and 4 tops packed tightly next to each other. Definitely not a place for groups. The staff does a great job of making you feel welcome. My only suggestion is to request a table in the front of the restaurant, because the back of the house gets really warm, thanks to the giant brick oven.Drinks and Wine list: Nothing spectacular, and the wines by the glass were pretty weak and I think this is what knocked it down from 4 stars. Decent restaurants will have offer a few good wines by the class for couples who can't agree on red or white. I ordered a Manhattan and it was pretty good, considering I'm this far from Manhattan! Food: Overall, pretty good. We had the pork chop and the sea bass. the pork chop was a solid 5, easily among the best I have ever had. Cooked perfectly and the sweet and spicy flavors of the dish really just worked. I mean, this placed nailed it. The sea bass was pretty unremarkable and I would not order again. We split the winter cole slaw which had apple, brussels sprout leaves and duck confit. Definitely delicious, but it coagulated quickly and got pretty unappealing. For dessert, we split something along the lines of a chocolate mouse. Good to share if you just wan't a taste of something sweet to finish off the meal, but not impossible to finish alone."

I was very happy with what we ordered but disappointed with the size of the portions. Two little cubes of feta with a pita bread... For like $14. Where is the cheese, chef? The homemade flat breads though... Miam :-) They are savoury, doughy, but again - way too small! Aaaand $20. But of course when you pay that much you expect freshness, quality and a unique taste. Well it did it for me. Suggestion : flat bread w oyster mushrooms and truffle Italian cheese. Delish!! Service was excellent by the way and they are open 7 days a week, dinner only. But if you have a big appetite and don't want to spend $75 for yourself only, Id suggest an Italian or Greek for their generosity :D Bon app!4 stars for the quality of the food. 3 for the value. 4 stars for the service. 2 stars for the comfort (don't take the banquette...

Came here for dinner last night with a 9:15pm reservation and were seated within about ten minutes to a low table which we appreciated (our reservation was for a high table initially). Having read rave reviews, we ordered the duck coleslaw salad which was good (but not great). We also had a house specialty pita ($6 for one pita!!) which was also good but really not worth the $6. For our mains, we went with the hanger steak and the gnocchi - both highly recommended. The steak was delicious as were the amazing side onions (I could eat those all day and all night), however the gnocchi was just weird. Instead of the typical little nugget form of gnocchi we all know, this one was in square format which I appreciated in terms of creativity. The dish came with a thousand flavours however which I didn't find complemented each other but were rather distracting as a whole. Neither myself nor my partner enjoyed this dish.Apart from the food, the decor and ambiance are great as was the service. Unfortunately though, that's not enough to make us want to return. We decided to skip dessert and left paying $120 (w/tx+tip) for two mains, an appetizer, and a pita (no drinks). Honestly, not understanding what the hype is about and will not come back. Sorry Foxy!"

Very rustic chic, keeping up with the hipster takeover of new Montreal restaurants. Good ambiance for a night with a small group of friends or a date at the bar. However, it can get quite loud. The menu has less than 15 items or so but showed a good diversity and the ones we ordered were well executed. Coup de Coeur of the night was the winter coldslaw with duck effiloché. Perfect bite of fresh, sweet and savoury with a touch of acid. A must try! We also had the house feta, first bites were very tasty but got very salty as the dish was cleaned. Flat bread with artichokes and dill was also a winner but can get heavy so grab a friend to share. Would definitely go back if they update their menu seasonally."

The layout and design is great, I love the dark shades of slate grey and black reflecting the light of the fire. The Paper Planes cocktail I started with was tart and perfectly balanced and I could have drank a pint of it. We shared the house feta and the winter slaw with duck and the flat bread with ham, we weren't starving so this was a perfect amount of food for us. The flavours in each plate were especially enjoyable for their unique combinations and fresh local Quebec ingredients. There was a line by the time we left so definitely make a reservation and enjoy!

We arrived and having our drinks and conversations, while waiting for another person to arrive. Waiter came and ask if we want to start with some appetizers, we order a few dishes. He bring the appetizers and asked if we can order our main course as he proceeded to tell us that the table was reserve for another group later but they are looking at rearranging the reservation. (???!!!)We told him that we were not informed that we had to leave earlier and either way, you don't inform your clients of that right then and there however, we proceeded to order our meals. Assuming that they are making whatever rearrangement. The food came and nothing was mentioned about having to give up the table.Generally, the food was good. We've been before and usually consistent but the sea bass, definitely overfilled it on the salt. So we finish our main courses and they clear our table. The waiter came up and literally asked us how we want to split the bill??? We looked at him and said, sorry but we want to see the desserts menu and tea/coffee. He pretty much told us: "" I'm sorry but we really need this table and the other group were sitting outside but because it is raining , they needed to be seated inside. Breaks my heart to say this but maybe we can pack your desserts?? "". WHAT??? Pack our desserts??? First, if you overbooked or failed to ensure the turnaround time of your table, that is not your clients issue. Second, If your turnaround time is so strict than you should indicate it on your website and at time of reservation that you only take 2 serving time and first serving time might need to be out before the second serving.We understand that this was not the waiters' fault, don't get us wrong, he was pressured to just kick us out.

For me, it was a first visit to Montreal and I was pleased with the excellent first impression at Foxy. Our group chose a pre-fixe menu with three courses. Highlights included the baked feta & the gnocchi--I mean, we are STILL talking about this Roman-style gnocchi! Erik (sorry if the spelling is off!) was attentive but never hovering. His wine and cocktail recommendations were perfect. We all had different palates and hopes for our drinking life that night and Erik stepped into each conversation with generosity & confidence. We loved the seamless service he gave and how it allowed us to enjoy one another through the course of the meal...which was the entire point of taking a holiday together.Many in our group are service industry vets & members. Two of us own food & hospitality businesses in Chicago. We are quite far from novice diners, and from an amazing food city.

So why not five stars? Just a few hours after we left, I was already starving! We were a group of 4 but I don't think we should be that hungry if we ordered 3 appetizers, 2 entrees 2 sides and 2 desserts. Maybe we should have ordered 1 more entree. Also the food took a long time to come out to our table. I would definitely come back to Foxy but on a night where I'm feeling really spendy."

The pulled duck coleslaw was outstanding and fresh. It sits on a celery-rave and apple purée that wasn't too overpowering so i liked it a lot. We had the beef onglet and chicken as main courses. Both were really good. I love acidic flavors and I felt like they used lots of it for both plate.We had one desert to share because we were pretty full: a chocolate waffle with ice cream and pecans.It was ok nothing to die over. But I'm not crazy about chocolate so don't take my word for it. We had wine by the glass. Good selection.Service was ok and effective The restaurant is really small and the tables are really close to each other. It's on the pricey sideThe menu is really short and sweet which I like so I don't spend 5 hrs trying to choose. This place definitely deserves its place on the list. Tip: Do reserve ahead

You walk in and you smell the wood fired oven, you can see the embers and their glow and are greeted warmly.  We sat at the bar this past weekend and were excited for a great meal, unfortunately it was probably the worst meal we had the entire weekend. Service was incredibly slow, we watched everyone throughout the restaurant get their food, people who sat down 30 mins after us. I think the bartender forgot to put in our food and he had to ask us again what we ordered. The food was the main disaster. First course was a $20 pizza that was more like a tart that was sloppy and tiny, more like a tart. No flavor and no apples despite that being on the description.  The gnochi $32 is the tiniest dish i've ever seen, maybe 5 noodles on the plate and 4 mushrooms to go with. When I asked the bartender about the plate, he gave a very dumbfounded answer and said ""I don't know what to say, it is what it is."" The steak dish $34 was even worse, chewy flank steak covered in a salty dressing (tasted like ranch) with some barely cooked tomatoes and onions. Not worth the money at all."

The service was great, really good wine list. It's a cosy place with a nice atmosphere, but the food was (actually) bad.We had two appetizers (corn/chicken tamale, $17 & cod/chili smashed cucumbers, $18), two mains (gnocchi, $32 and ribs, $35), and a bottle of wine. Everything was lukewarm/room temperature, really small portions, not at all tasty or satisfying. The tamale was wet, deconstrucuted in a bowl, covered with a forest of raw coriander that overpowered everything else. The cod dish was flavourless and the fish was overdone. The gnocchi was maybe the biggest disappointment - grainy and oily, texture of leftover lasagna, whole hazelnuts that overpowered the chanterelle flavour. The rib dish was six small pork ribs floating in this watery fish sauce dressing covered with raw vegetables (the ribs were somehow dry despite the amount of liquid in the bowl?)... Really disappointing as we were looking forward to trying this place for some time, but left totally unsatisfied with everything we tasted. Made worse by the fact that the prices are twice what they are at other places in the neighbourhood. There are many restaurants around there with really high quality and delicious food - what's going on here!"

/user_details?userid=4TenUuWdhO7-bVNXRMVBpQ,Martin G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My expectations were pretty high since I'm a big fan of Olive + Gourmando. Yes, this restaurant is the new outfit of Dyan Solomon and Eric Girard from O+G. And I was not disappointed.The restaurant by itself is spectacular. The restaurant has a very welcoming and warm atmosphere, despite the industrial decor. But the superb wood fired oven is probably not a stranger to that.The star of the restaurant is the food, which is mostly cooked on that wood fired oven. The chef is quite young but has an impressive resume. Her name is Leigh Roper, and she made her classes with David McMillan and Fred Morin at Joe Beef, Liverpool House and Vin Papillon, and interships at the well known Tartine Bakery and Café, Chez Panisse et Chez Quince on the West Coast.As our first course, we had the tiny grilled beets salad, which was perfect with the minty labneh, and the November coleslaw with spit-roasted duck. Absolutely divine.For our main course, we had the scallops, which were perfectly cooked, and the grilled hanger steak. The steak size was generous and delicious and perfectly seasoned. No complaints there. The grelot potatoes cooked on the oven were tasty.Really, I do not have any complaints. It's pretty rare that I find a restaurant executing everything so perfectly, from food to service, from decor to drinks. If I had one negative thing to say, and its a very minor one, is that no bread was served with the meal. I love bread, and with O+G's expertise in bread, I was expecting some. But again, everything else was so perfect that it is a minor fault.I will definitely return, the sooner the better :D"

The decor is beautiful and I love the wall with pictures of what I feel should be a fox but looks more like a dog. As we sat down our first waiter told us they had a full bar, but when we ordered a rye and ginger our second waiter admitted to mainly only have the ingredients for common cocktails. Disappointed, I ordered the paperplane cocktail which was delicious. For food we ordered and shared :The feta maisonThe marinated artichoke and dill flatbread The grilled scallopsThe lemon charred greensThe clementine cornbreadThe feta maison was AMAZING and came with a homemade buttered pita bread, perfect for sharing. The flatbread was flavourful but very small, I'd say smaller than a personal pizza. The grilled scallops were divine and I can't wait to have it again. Unfortunately the lemon charred greens were very...very sour. I'm hoping this was a fluke but along with the small flatbread and the ""full bar"" incident I left feeling on the fence about my overall experience. The desert was odd, I'm used to eating cornbread with lots of salt and butter, not sugar, although the the homemade vanilla ice cream was really really good. I plan on going back, try a different side and desert along with the feta maison again. In a nutshell, I'd say small portions with lots of flavours, my advice is don't expect to leave feeling full unless you are willing to spend the money for it. Our total bill with tax and tip (we were two) was 163$."

Might be a great place for drinks, but not for dining. The food was okay, nothing special, relatively simple and uncreative, but overpriced. For a starter got a small $22 flatbread pizza. The pizza was covered with large rocks of salt, that completely ruined it for me. For my main course I got a $36 Mt. Laurier hanger steak which wasn't less salty than the pizza. Not sure why they're obsessed with salt there, but based on the other reviews it seems to be a big issue with the place. I'm usually not so sensitive about oversalted food, but there were pure salt rocks in both of my dishes, trust me it's not an overstatement.The server was pretty attentive and helpful at first, but by the time I had to get the bill she decided to keep me waiting until she finished chatting to 2 other tables for 30 more minutes."

Including L'Express, Candide, and *gasp* Au Pied de Cochon (all of which were DELICIOUS, but understand me, Foxy is IT). We ate snowcrab so perfect it could have gone unseasoned, but then again, that Thai-inspired, buttery jous was so extraordinary, we risked filling up on bread just to have some vehicle to keep eating it once the meat was gone. Flatbread to rival pizza in Naples, creative veggie dishes, excellent steak and an unforgettable little cake for dessert with fresh berries and housemade ice cream. The service was excellent, the vibe was lovely and I legit couldn't recommend this place more highly."

Eggplant purée was the only thing we didn't like. For entrées, we shared the cavatelli and sea bass. They were both fantastic. We finished the meal with the brownie.

/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My friend and I ate here on Friday at 6 pm on the terrace. They let us know in advance on the phone that there was a table after us at 8 pm sharp and that we were to leave before then but by the time we finished eating and paid it was close to 9 pm. They did not try to rush us out and we did not feel pressured to leave. The staff was very nice and did a good job making sure our needs were met... for example,  always making sure our glasses were filled with water etc. My friend and I started with the Hey Honey! cocktail which consisted of gin , honey, lemon and cava. It sounds like something one would drink if they were sick but it did not taste like medicine. It wasn't too sweet and it wasn't bitter. It was so light and refreshing and foamy on top. My friend had two because it was that good while I tried the Foxy Caesar ( bourbon , horseradish , hot sauce ). It was very flavourful and filling. We shared two appetizers  and  had our own mains. The two dishes that stood out the most and that I recommend are 1) the heirloom tomato flatbread with burrata and basil and 2) the homemade feta with peaches , cucumber, onions, summer honey. These two ""first bites""  don't look very impressive at first glance but they taste great. The flatbread looks like homemade pizza but the bread is so good that I don't think people at home can recreate it. The feta looks small if shared but it comes with a big puffy pita and the dish is quite satisfying. I had the hanger steak which came with tomato and onion salad. It was cooked the way I like it ... medium rare. And although it was good I know I will only remember the flatbread and feta months from now.  My friend had the grilled trout and we shared the yams with spicy mayo to go with our mains. I was expecting the yams to be fries but they were big wedges. It tasted fine but we couldn't finish it because we were full. This is a cute restaurant and I think it's definitely worth a try!"

/user_details?userid=e6KfwIcnAasN_PuUoesDiw,Daniel K.,"Williamsburg, NY",4 star rating,"Upon fighting the monstrous crowds at Olive & Gourmando, we stumbled upon a card directing us to their sister restaurant, Foxy. So, desperate for a dinner that did not involve blood pudding or extravagantly rich French food that left us broke and hungry, we decided to venture out to Griffintown. Let us get one thing straight -- a town that closely resembles a Harry Potter house name must indeed have splendors of the first-rate variety.The ambiance has all the makings of a hip and happening restaurant -- heavy wood, great music, and a wood-burning oven that released smells that would not be out of place in heaven (though sans fire, at least from the frescoes I've seen). The ""it factor"" is really embodied by the fact that everything comes forth from the wood-burning oven. Meat. Vegetable. The lot, really. The service was friendly and the wine selection robust. Food is intended to be shared and so the four of us ordered the cauliflower, flat breads, and feta dishes to start. All were excellent, though the cauliflower was a particular standout. For mains, we dabbled in steak, fish, and chicken dishes. All were delicious and flavorful, though the chicken was especially noteworthy. Pair that with a side of yams and you're in for a real treat. On a subsequent outing, we also had the clams, which were similarly delicious.This is the type of restaurant that will serve Montreal well. It is unpretentious enough to serve as a reunion dinner spot for a small group of friends, but warm and cozy enough to be a good date spot. If you are interested in hearty and delicious food, this is certainly one restaurant that should be on your radar. Not all the dishes are created equal and it is on the expensive side, but - compared with some of the other ""destination restaurants"" in Montreal - serves food of a consistently high standard.Good spot for: foodies; tourists who don't want to be exploited at the ""old school"" French eateries; couples; small groups."

Service was friendly, patient and courteous. We started off with a cocktail and hoping to order a bottle of wine but sadly the wine list is not good.  Starts at $45 for a Cahors then a Beaujelais (which we had no interest in) for $50 then quickly jumps to a few choices at $60 and quickly up, up & up! Way too expensive of a wine list in my opinion. And only 3 sad choices by the glass in both white &:red.  Not impressive by any means. I do hope they improve on that front. Food was good and fresh but I agree with other reviewers, the portions were overly small. Pricey with poor wine list or choices by the glass, but saving grace... food was good! Long term, I think they will need to offer more value if they want to sustain themselves....i. my humble opinion!"

This is a charcoal place but don't expect any kind of southern BBQ. I had the ribs and I've never had any thing like them. They were charred (not burnt)until crispy on the exterior soft, moist and full of meaty goodness on the inside and only gently seasoned. I will dream of these ribs. My partner had the hanger steak which was also done to perfection and truly medium rare. The service was great, I forgot to order a side and it came quickly when I asked for it after my ribs were served.It is on the pricy side when you consider you need to order a side separately.A great place for a date."

We were told that the steak would be cooked to medium rare but parts of the steak were very well done and some parts were raw. I mean there was 1 slice that was cooked perfectly.
