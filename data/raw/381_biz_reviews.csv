This place has been around forever and what this place is, is a burgers and fries place and that's it. Thing is they don't do it well, they go above and beyond by grinding their own chuck every morning and kicking you in the teeth with a burger-gasm. It's right up there with Restaurant Grégoire in Mercier. It's the burger that burger dreams are made of. Seriously GO. EAT. NOW.The fries are also top notch. The rings, though frozen, are still awesome and to top it off they haz Stewart's soft drinks. And all this is some cheap eats to. Wam bam thank you mam."
/user_details?userid=oXhCkT0hmSfRbrVtDRUllw,Austin W.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"This was a highly anticipated stop on our trip to Montreal.  It was a place we really wanted to love but unfortunately it didn't live up to the high expectations.The gentleman at cash was really helpful in explaining the different types of hotdogs.  We decided to try one steamed hotdog, one grilled hotdog and a poutine.  The hotdogs came all dressed with mustard, relish, onions and coleslaw.  They were small, and relatively bland.  They were not bad but weren't amazing either.  The poutine was pretty good.  It had a ton of gravy and large cheese curds, which was appreciated.  The gravy was also a little bland but it was alright.  Overall, if I was in the neighbourhood again and wanted poutine and hotdogs I'd give it a second try but I don't think I would make a special trip out here."
/user_details?userid=JstDKWmAZsL026ADFxf7fw,Tony Kangrui L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Very nice hamburger patty. Remember when fast-food hamburgers were decently priced and piping hot? That's exactly what it is. I tried Le Moelleux (""soft bread"" burger with mushrooms) and overall it was a very well constructed burger. However I found that there was too much sauce in Le Moelleux but I'll be coming back to try the other burgers.Poutine - nothing really to note there.Be cognizant that this establishment doesn't offer a huge choice of menu options. Like another reviewer said, you go there for hamburger, fries, and that's it. Maybe a steamy and grilled cheese cuz it won't break the bank.Place takes credit cardsUpdate (2019-01-29): Tried the Super Phil burger, kinda disappointing. While Le Moelleux had too much sauce, the Super Phil was the opposite, the bread to meat/other ingredients ratio was way too high making each bite very dry, and overall it's just just a good bread. Stick to Le Moelleux for a more balanced and original creation. Also, the fries alone aren't as good as the poutine. Meaning I'm not a fan of the fries, but in poutine form they're well tolerated. Will be trying that burger-in-between-2-grilled-cheese thing next time."

/user_details?userid=YkBaano32ehwZj0jAy_aOA,Jason A.,"Chandler, AZ",3 star rating,"Will keep this short and sweet. Burger = 8/10. Mouthwatering burger. Quality beef with robust flavor. Nice and smashed resulting in a nice sear on the edges. I usually get a a bacon cheese burger with lettuce and grilled onions. Amazing. 2nd best burger ive ever had (after Burger Priest in Toronto). I took 2 points off due to the size of the patty. The patty is very small and this seems to be the norm in Montreal. If it were an inch smaller, it would be a slider. Same thing with uniburger...kid sized burgers. Fries = 2/10. The fries have a great texture but zero great taste. They taste like oil. Take a tablespoon of peanut oil and add ketchup and you've tasted the fries here.Also, be ware that these people prepare your food with their bare hands. No gloves or anything."
/user_details?userid=ZN6SvJx36d5l_9GOb_Us7w,Dunkelbart F.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Look you come here for a stimé and frites or a burger, that's about it. It tastes the way its supposed to taste. The prices are reasonable. It is a miracle that this place still exists in the state its in, like travelling back to the 70s.  Notice that the other 5 star reviews in here are from Montrealers, they know what's what with this kind of casse croute. Don't go here if you are a finicky snob."
/user_details?userid=gginJ85XfgavGtEIvxs3EA,Lonny E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Excellent place for poutine, fries, hot dogs, classic canteen with reasonable prices."
/user_details?userid=cqagyVkvbBB32agnJsIhVA,Ephraim D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This has become my go-to place for steamies and fries... just ask for the fries well done if you want them crispy, like I do. Fries come unsalted, so take a packet if leaving or salt as needed. Quick service. Food comes hot. Great for take-away. As for atmosphere... if that's what you want, go to IKEA... you came here for the steamie!"
/user_details?userid=cuQ2EB0vzq3G-k9Vkf9MaA,Julian H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"If there were six stars I'd give it a higher rating. This is not health food, the decor and ambience is very ordinary. But the food: when you are in the mood for a perfect-I mean truly perfect diner burger from fresh, not from frozen preformed patties but smashed into an edible form, this is the place. If Anthony Bourdain had included this place on his 24hr layover in Montreal he would have added on a week to his visit. The ""Zeke"" is not just an extraordinary piece of diner genius (a burger in the middle of a grilled cheese sandwich! Sheer brilliance!), it is as close as you can get to a heartattack without dying while simultaneously experiencing what another reviewer here called a Burg-asm. Don't even get me started on the poutine-crispy fries, perfect brown sauce, 2 packs of cheese for the large!!! And then the service...to wit: a man pulls up outside in a motorized wheelchair and the cashier leaves his post, walks out to meet him, takes his order than brings his food to him when it was ready. Charming, friendly, helpful and an opportunity to experience unbridled mouth joy from an independent authentic Quebecois diner. Do not judge a book-or a greasy spoon-by its cover. This is a gateway to food heaven."
/user_details?userid=RBY6Cs2sYd_VqJPdu6joOw,John H.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,This place is fantastic. Like traveling back in time to a place where people took pride in this kind of fast food. The family that runs the place really seem to care. The poutine is as it should be - the fries are the perfect texture. We order 'Le Zeke' a burger between two grilled cheese sandwiches - and split it between us. YES! A BURGER BETWEEN TWO GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICHES! A real gem.
/user_details?userid=pjyiGFo8GNQ4YvcukxbOug,Max N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I am always on the lookout of a good poutine. Everyone has their idea of what makes up a good one, here is mine...Fries that are not too thick, not too thin, must taste potato like, not too greasy, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside with a little salt. As for the gravy, nice flavor, no lumps. Cheese on the bottom, then fries, then cheese, then sauce. God, I am a pig but if I am going to splurge, it needs to be worth it:)It's on Amherst in the Village, nothing special in terms of decor etc but it is always busy, the owners are very freiendly and the food is always good.Another thing... the poutine comes in a styrofoam bowl, which always makes it taste better in my opinion:) I am weird like that:)Anyway,  I always order the small, with extra cheese which they  put on the bottom, they cook your fries when you order and the counter is right infront of everything so you see it being made which I also appreciate. They do not salt their fries, so once they are cooked they bring me my bowl, so I can salt them, then take it back to the counter to finish making it.Their hamburgers are really good as well. They are no frill type of burgers, don't expect a multitude of special toppings but the meat is freshly ground on location daily, and all their toppings are crisp and fresh and the end result is a very happy mouth!Try them out if you are in the area. Oh, they are not open late, so check the website out for their hours."
