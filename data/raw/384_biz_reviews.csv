/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I love Ethiopian food and was sad to see there were only a couple restaurants in the city. However, this place is great! On par taste-wise with the other ones I've been to, although sadly they don't have Tej here. The last time we went we shared the two person platter (we chose for wat and alicha wat) and an order of kitfo. The combo would have certainly been enough for two people but I can't not have kitfo. It was just slightly cooked which was strange to me, but still tasty. Normally I get tibs as well but it wasn't included in the combo and the wots were good. The evening we went in the service was very very slow. It seemed to be only two people for the whole restaurant which was full on a Friday night. Hopefully they were just understaffed that evening. All in all a solid restaurant. I'll definitely be back."

There's just enough in a serving to tease your pallet and fill you without feeling overstuffed  the decor is also tastefully done. I'll have to make my way back here soon!"

I mean, I'm writing this review and all I want to do is get in my car and drive back there to eat their food again.Since it's my first time experiencing this type of cuisine, I can't compare. But my tastebuds and gluttonous soul were sooooo happy lol! Everything was tasty. My cousin that loves Ethiopian food and tried all of the Ethiopian restaurants here and elsewhere said that this is a very very good place. The service and ambiance of this place makes it all the better. They have a Groupon deal and as soon as I got home, I bought the deal. I  can not wait to come back!"

My friends and I got the tasting platter which comprised of 2 main dishes + one braised beef and 5 different types of vegetables. You had to get ready to eat with your hands, which makes the experience quite unique as well! We also got a bottle of wine. The price of the platter and the wine was very reasonable."

We had the tasting menu for 2 which gives you 3 veggies and 2 meats. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The flavours are different from the norm. The berbere sauce is very good. Further , it's quite an experience if you have never had Ethiopian food."

/user_details?userid=2I8gFHc3HoHxbvsvJ09U0A,Young Y.,"Tinton Falls, NJ",5 star rating,Excellent Ethiopian food at the Queen! The injera and berberi taste excellent! My wife and I had the plate for two with doro wat and minchet. Both were absolutely delicious. I added the chacha Tibs and what a meal! Excellent place for a date or a small group. Intimate setting where you can feel your food before you enjoy it. We are from out of town and we were excited to find this spot! Give it a try!

My friend and I went to the restaurant last night without having a reservation. The restaurant was fully booked, but somehow they managed to give us a seat at the bar. This being said: I recommend to make a reservation in advance :). If you step into the restaurant you smell the spices, and you don't want to leave without having tried their food. They also have a great selection of bottled wines. I wish they had more variety when it comes to ordering by glass.Also, try their coffee!"

The food was amazing, seriously good foooood. Really cute place with a nice front porch area where we had our late lunch/early dinner after hours of walk at the royal mountain. The Ethiopian bread injera was nicely sour and soft. The wait stuff guy was also very helpful. We took his recommendations for the food and we were so happy. He also called a cab for us. Very friendly and welcoming. We will definitely return!!!"

I was not disappointed! The vegetable combo (beyaynatu) gave a generous portion of all of my favorites: shiro (chickpea stew), misir wot (lentils), atekelt (cabbage and potatoes), gomen (collard greens)...delicious! The owner is sweet and attentive and humored my broken Amharic. Visiting Montreal from New York, I expected to crave poutine but found myself wanting Ethiopian, and Queen Sheba really hit the spot."

And if you're going to try it, try it here. I came here with a group and we ordered the tasting menu. Everyone in our group loved it. We had such a nice variety of what the restaurant offers. The flavours of everything we ate were phenomenal. And the price is definitely right for what you get here. This place will leave you full, but still wanting more!"

Everything was great, food & service & atmosphere. I got the meat combination (chicken and beef) and it was perfect. I have been to many Ethiopian restaurants before, but I could say the food here is the most delicious so far."
/user_details?userid=J0ZEA-chzgEnedIXBpbNZQ,Diane D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Sharing a platter of Ethiopian food with good friends is such a pleasure, but in Montreal we haven't had many affordable options, so I was thrilled to hear about Queen Sheba. The ambiance is wonderful--the tables are well-spaced, but cozy; the space is warm and clean and perfectly lit; there's music, but it's easy to converse. The food is terrific: generous quantities, and fresh, with just the right amount of spice. The service is really top-notch and friendly. Oh, and it's all really affordable! I'm already planning my next visit..."

I thought it would be more flavorful but the vegetable combo was bland. The meat (doro wat, chacha tibs, kitfo) were okay/good but the portions were really small for the price you pay.

For someone who had only known Couscous, it was a pleasant surprise to discover the richness of Ethiopia food. The whiff of homemade spices with carefully selected collection of wine, your appetite will shoots up as high as Simien mountains. And you'll find yourself at heaven when you wrap the gravy with handmade bread...  You would need to roll back home instead of walking."

Locally run: by an awesome family who has been in the city since 19923. Food: top notch, incredible variation among the veggie and meat dishes. Everything so tasty, not super spicy, but just enough.4. Atmosphere: very chill, clean, minimal and welcoming decor - not too loud.5. Music: best jazz compilation with fab piano riffs."

/user_details?userid=MPt4t8ugTIx-95fmSZV41w,Thia R.,"Boston, MA",3 star rating,"The food was good and everyone was friendly, but the experience overall was mediocre. I love Ethiopian food, so I was excited to come here. I went with a very large group which might have something to do with the problems. The service was very very slow even though we appeared to be one of the few tables in the restaurant. There was a lot of confusion how much food to share and we ended up having to ordered more.If I lived closer I would give it another try with a smaller group of people. I would also only order the vegetarian dishes (they were far superior to the meat based dishes IMO)."
/user_details?userid=RvrvX_lzajZvp6him1d5gQ,Sonja M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Food and service were outstanding. We had a wonderful evening, with food that was absolutely delicious. We picked a mix of vegetables and meat dishes. There are several different combinations either vegetarian, meat, or a combination of the two available, so you can easily find one that you like. And of course everything is served with and on injera, delicious sour dow bread. Can't wait to go back and try out other combinations!"

Not only did we have a great meal but dining with a 9-year-old and 9-month-old, they were extremely helpful making sure both kids had food to eat as well.

We made a reservation last minute and they were able to seat us quickly. I absolutely LOVED dining here. The wait staff is really polite and the ambiance is perfect for groups. They have several large tables. Plus the food was delicious, so good that we ordered seconds. I believe we had the meat platter to share- I was excited because the meat was halal. But it also had some vegetarian parts. Everything was delicious. Will definitely be back for more!"

At the outset we found the decor very cool and the establishment noticeably clean and cared for. The staff people are gracious, friendly, fun and accommodating (little changes like moving a table - it's all good , smiles and laughs.) Extensive menu, and when we were served the food was tasty and intriguing in seasonings. I actually found that my digestive system *liked* it which hasn't liked much lately. We will definitely be going back as it's our neighborhood. Happy to have these newcomers here on the Parc/Plateau."

/user_details?userid=LHlKkrkppF-HIV3MOqAKcQ,Margaret M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Oh dear. I'm always on the lookout for new Ethiopian restaurants so I was very excited to find out about this place. I noticed Queen Sheba while walking past one day, and immediately made plans to go over the weekend. The restaurant is nice and comfortable, the location is convenient, and the staff are lovely, but unfortunatley that's where the positive review ends. My friend and I ordered a couple of vegetarian combos that featured typical Ethiopian fare - lentils in berber sauce, split peas, mixed veggies, spinach, etc. The first thing we noticed was that everything was dry. Normally, the sauces from the food soak through the injera, but these dishes were so dry they were honestly difficult to swallow. The fact that the injera was thicker and denser than I'm used to didn't help. The split peas were also undercooked (crunchy), so we ended up leaving most uneaten. Finally, the taste was underwhelming. Good Ethiopian food is incredible for its spice blends and bursting flavours, but this food almost seemed intentionally bland. I'm left wondering if the other reviewers have never had Ethipian food before, because I'm honestly baffled by the positivity of the previous comments. I hate leaving negative reviews for places that I really want to support. The people here seem wonderful and I would have loved to have found a new regular dinner spot. I only hope that my comments can be helpful in some way, because I would love for this place to succeed. Considering they have good service, a good location, and a nice sized restaurant, they really just need to improve their food in order to have a winning combination.TL;DR: Food is dry and bland. Restaurant is nice and service is great. Wish I could have loved it. One star for the food, second star for the service and overall restaurant experience."
/user_details?userid=6jkzMhdPYwOJp5yryrfKcw,Ann G.,"Levittown, NY",5 star rating,"We had not been in Montreal for a long time, and our old standby restaurants no longer exist. We came upon Queen of Sheba accidentally, and it turned out to be the best dining experience in our trip. The atmosphere was casual and relaxed. We had a vegetarian combination dish, and it was excellent. What was unique about this restaurant, though, was the exceptionally friendly and attentive service. We never had to ask or look around to get our water refilled. When the waitress asked how everything was, she seemed to really want to know. Even the chef came to our table to ask how we liked the food. When we asked what one dish was, he told us, and brought us an additional complimentary serving, since we said we liked it. We were told that the restaurant was only 4 months old. We really them the best of luck and would highly recommend it to others."

/user_details?userid=Ta78yYhlIfxp9OsT-9Ux9g,Myrite R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This was a fun spot to go to with a group. We were mostly veg, so didn't get to try the meat yet- but everything was yummy with lots of selection- And when you run out of Enjera bread, they keep bringing you more until you polish it all off! Also they brought the extra portions in a separate bowl so there was sooo much food to enjoy. I have a feeling the meat would be even better. The ambiance was ok- not as cozy as I would have liked and the lighting is a little dark and night clubby while I prefer more of a La Khaima restaurant vibe but that didn't take away from the experience. Family run- really friendly service. They also serve alcohol."

The owner personally came out and asked us how the food was. One thing that was different from what I'm used to for Ethiopian food was that the spicy level was more mild compared to what I had before. Overall it was a great experience!!
/user_details?userid=tDkZ08SmPISTxRJcknyqPQ,D F.,"Hyannis, Barnstable, MA",5 star rating,Great place for delicious food.  The interior is modern and chic and incorporates Ethiopian art.  Waiter was very nice and brought us Ethiopian coffee for free. Injera was perfect.  Yeshiro Wat and Gomen also delicious.  Chicken was tender and juicy.  Ethiopian tea is a must.   Reasonable prices and great food.  Would definitely go back when in Montreal.
/user_details?userid=bj2_KPCKpQdNlN8hlHSxdg,Cat D.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"This place is so bad that I felt compelled to write a review the second after ""finishing"" our take out from there (I use quotes, because we certainly did not finish a single dish we ordered and only ate enough to quiet our hunger before we eventually make a second meal at home). We ordered the Ye doro wat, which is a common dish in every Ethiopian restaurant, consisting of chicken simmered in a berbere sauce and a hard-boiled egg. This dish was probably the least edible of the three we ordered, due to the sauce (which comprised 70% of the dish) being inordinately BITTER, and also tasting like burnt oil. The chicken was pretty hard and not flavorful and the egg was completely overcooked and hard to even cut in two. The next dish, yellow split peas, was one of the blandest, saddest dishes I've had the displeasure of eating recently! It was basically mashed split peas with no seasoning. Anyone who has had the chance to have good Ethiopian knows the amazingly complex spiciness simple veggie dishes can have, and this was like eating baby food. The last dish we ordered, Alitcha, was supposed to be tender meat cubes with potatoes and seasoned with various spices. I literally didn't even realize this was a meat dish when I first opened the container, since it looked like possibly pureed lentils. It was basically a greasy, oily mess of miniscule pieces of meat, and by miniscule, I mean each piece of meat resembling a morsel of ground meat in size. This dish tasted overcooked and no seasoning. Absolutely unmemorable. To top it off, we live across the street from this establishment and yet every dish was lukewarm at best. I suspect a lot of reheating going on (something you would never see at East Afrika in NDG!), hence the bitter oil taste in the meat dishes. The injera was a darker brown than I've ever experienced and so incredibly sour that even people who like sourdough would have a hard time eating this. Completely unsatisfying and sad. Please save your wallets and expectations and skip this place!"
