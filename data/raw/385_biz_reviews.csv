Simple menu with burgers, fries kind of deal. I came here for a quick stopover before an event to grab a drink. I tried the bourbon iced T cocktail which was nice. I really enjoyed the tofu nuggets. I had no idea this place was vegan until I was informed after by the staff. (I know I shouldn't have missed it with the Vegan angels sign in front of the patio !). Service was friendly, on point and quick with food. That's when you know this place is legit ! They are available on most takeout apps. Bottles of vino available for order as well !"

I ordered delivery and had the Mimi Burger (with Chao cheese, spicy mayo, tomatoes, pickles, lettuce, caramelized onions, and sauteed mushrooms), Caesar salad (with roasted chickpeas and nut parmesan cheese), and tater tots.I was really impressed by the vegan Caesar salad, which was so realistic. I've always loved Caesar salad but was turned off when I learned that the dressing contains raw egg yolk. This creamy salad tasted just like the real thing, and the roasted chickpeas added a nice crunch. The burger was amazing as well, since IMO caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms and cheese are the best burger toppings. The patty was thick and hearty, and the tater tots were perfectly browned and crispy. Portion sizes are generous and filling.All in all, I really loved the food from Mimi & Jones and would highly recommend this restaurant."

I've already tried the tofu nuggets and the cheeseburger and man, nothing short of amazing. I love it here. It's got the diner vibe nailed down and the soundtrack is on point. My friend and I love coming here when we have our catch up sessions. The food just tastes so good. I highly recommend the maple Dijon sauce if you get the nuggets. And definitely get the extra cheese on the burger, so worth it. I've had the chocolate milkshake and that's the only thing that is a bit off since it's vegan and so the consistency is off. Still worth a try because it's still good. It just didn't satisfy my milkshake craving. Service is super friendly!"

Also the croquettes with the Dijon maple sauce are pure comfort! The milkshakes are not too heavy and not too sweet, because they're vegan, obviously! I had the cheesecake flavored one and I was happy with my choice, but I think the vanilla or the chocolate one might've been more to my taste.Mimi and Jones proved that you don't need the Beyond burger to have a tasty wholesome burger, and tofu nuggets are always in"

Great cozy ambiance and decor, the music is fitting and the food is really good. Prices are a bit higher but the quality is great, and for a homemade independently run business, totally fair. The fries are addictive!"

You feel like eating a good old cheese burger just like the one you remember in your childhood memories straight back from the '80s? Search no more my friend! Mimi & Jones will more than satisfy that craving! Wait... how could that be? The place is vegan...? I agree vegan does not normally replace the good old stuff... but I swear this is a new level of vegan burger! There is no need to have any other burger when can eat this. The execution of the burger is simply flawless; from the cheese to the pickle.  After our meal, we called the restaurant to compliment the chef and tell her that it was worth every dollar of the ten-dollar we paid."

The milkshakes are also amazing. Super thick, the caramel shake is not overly sweet and definitely worth checking out."
