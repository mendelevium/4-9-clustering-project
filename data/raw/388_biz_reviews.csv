/user_details?userid=EKkMwPoCNkzClCB-6JBbTg,Erin P.,"Clemson, SC",4 star rating,"Interesting little hideout jam packed with tables and people. We were sort of waved to seat ourselves when we arrived and managed to find one solo table sitting below a TV and missing a chair. A chair was eventually procured but still...interesting. The grilled octopus was nice and a little bit different than the usual. The steak came with fries, surprisingly, and the mussels came with rice (instead of fries). The mussels were extremely delicious and there was no way to finish both the mountain of shellfish and the delicious saucy rice below.I expected more of a romantic evening vibe than a family dinner vibe given the prices, but this place is most definitely family friendly dining."
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a family style restaurant, definitely a good place to visit with your family or a group of friends. They are pretty famous with their seafood, it's always packed. I've had shrimp Doval for the main course and it was pretty good, although I wasn't super impressed with rice. Their squid was very good though and the fish is always great. It may be a bit over the limit for those on the budget, but it is a good dining experience to try once a while. I would definitely be back."
/user_details?userid=hVPyu7QWaSQgOlz0rppmkg,Matthew B.,"Chester Springs, PA",4 star rating,"Wow- iamazing selection of appetizers gave us a little bit of everything:  grilled octopus, calamari, sardines, & quail. All grilled to perfection, all served with salad and great Portuguese bread/olives. A Vino Verde with the meal completed the setting. A little off the beaten track- but well worth the effort. Generous portion sizes and perfectly executed. Definitely a don't miss."
/user_details?userid=ZV6JF8YJOXVu_X5cH_3CUw,Noel C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Amazing price/quality ratio. Their signature dish is the pork with clams. Their salads do remind me of Portugal. House wine is decently priced and is a great pairing for almost the whole menu. Cheers.

Plenty of good portuguese restaurants around, make yourself a favor and avoid this one"
/user_details?userid=KZ65j98DESGYG5v1jMw_bg,Don And Mike F.,"Akron, OH",2 star rating,"If you live here in Montreal, my understanding is, that residential cooking over charcoal is banded.. Chez Doval is the place to go for that charcoal cooked flavor. To be fair, I need to explain that my wife and I were there with a party of 9. I ordered the grilled squid as an appetizer and for diner the doral. My wife ordered chicken which was the favorite of others in our party. The squid was nicely seasoned and, for squid, not too chewy.. The doral was cooked near to perfect and moderately  seasoned. The chicken my wife had was tastee; dry, but had a very rich charcoal flavor. The service we recieved was bad. Everyone at our table that I spoke to felt the same way.  It wasn't that I felt we were invisible. No, just the opposite. It was like he had more important things to do. I'm going go even further as to say, it seemed that we were intentionally ignored. That's how bad it was.If you live local and want to get away from the flavor of the gas grill, it's a place to go for food cooked decently over charcoal. I would go back only if it wasn't my choice to make."
/user_details?userid=FtRhMVLcmiMEYb582-yJ1w,Richard R.,"Mississauga, Canada",2 star rating,"Very disappointing.Based on the many 4 and 5 star reviews here we expected tasty, simple Portuguese dishes prepared with fresh ingredients. We didn't expect anything fancy (this isn't Helena or Portus Calle), but we did expect well-prepared food made of quality ingredients using classic Portuguese recipes.Unfortunately, that's not what we got when we visited on this Saturday evening.  We got stale bread, dry chicken, indifferently seasoned sardines, tasteless fries, overly tomatoe-y mussels, and at the end the pastels de nata were at least two days old and soggy, with all the delectable crispiness and the fresh milky flavor of a fresh nata long, long. gone.All that, and it was a steambath -- 28 degrees C (82.4 degrees F) inside, according to the thermometer on the wall.Avoid.  There are so, so many better Portuguese places all around the area.  Or just get fantastic takeout grilled chicken from Romados."
/user_details?userid=inKaQIBzXTcGxt9Z9CJTwA,John K.,"Austin, TX",4 star rating,Beautifully prepared fresh seafood in a Portuguese neighborhood adjacent to trendy Plateau. We had grilled Red Snapper and grilled Sardines. Perfectly prepared.Very decent house red.Good service - this is a go-to place in Montreal - We have visited numerous times over the years and it remains an excellent  family restaurant. Great value too.
/user_details?userid=8dOQBoNWkHZL_UYaM9-ajA,Walter S.,"Longueuil, Canada",5 star rating,If you are ever in the Plateau in Montreal this place is a must go. They will not disappoint from sea to land and everything between. I've never been to Portugal but I can imagine these are some of the delectable foods I would be eating. You will get home drunk on food but not to the point where you're sick. I promise if you come here once you will be a repeat offender.
/user_details?userid=nM_So0J7eE_y4LohVX3SbA,Ron G.,"Milton, Canada",5 star rating,"For our last night in Montreal, we had a craving for some Portuguese food and found this place through Yelp. Reviews were decent so we checked it out. That was some great food, ambiance was enjoyable and fun with singing. My 10 year old whose birthday was the next day, got his birthday song from an old man and his guitar. We started with grilled octopus as appetizer. We devoured in minutes. It was so tasty! Rib steak was perfect at medium rare, melt in your mouth, and chicken was appetizing with the Piri Piri sauce. The mussels were huge, and dig deeper into the dish and it was served with a bed of rice in the mussel sauce. Very casual, inviting place. People were so friendly and we just kept on singing the whole night away. The bill came in at 80 bucks + tip! Highly recommend for the food and the ambiance. Will be back there again when in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=v4WE6ztGRYDLRpzUDMrUFw,Sean S.,"Lindenwold, NJ",5 star rating,The squid is excellent. The complimentary port wine at the end of the meal capped off a delicious meal.
/user_details?userid=5gj1dhFLlkgSJj4Jts-rqg,Marco R.,"Washington, DC",1 star rating,"When we saw this place we thought it was a hidden gem, an authentic ""tasca"", given the reviews. I don't understand how anyone can give this a five: poor quality of ingredients, overpriced and badly prepared food, and pretty rude service. Don't go."
/user_details?userid=jdLpY3fVbH2lcsXLHESF2A,Patricia S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Great restaurant in the plateau .. Chicken is great but my fav is definatly the seafood casserole ... A great Portuguese restaurant...The service is good ... A bit rough around the edges sometimes but you get used to it ... (It's the typical environment you'd find in a Portuguese house at supper time) Luv when the Spanish guy comes in with his guitar and sings for us
/user_details?userid=jSHGX2UfaiWbhxN8e8rhEw,Mengmeng W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"tastes amazing, friendly staff, love this restaurant :) the quails are amazing and all the dishes are very authentic. I would recommend anyone who loves portuguese food to try this place out."
/user_details?userid=r7GHYNcXMwCxd5SIHNBsAQ,Valerie G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Having been here so many times for take out, I must update that I have been going there to dine in house, several times with several parties (4-7 people) over the last few months and have discovered their entire menu.Among the new faves are the grilled octupus, which has intense flavor and a superb texture, the quail (oh how I love theee), it is messy as heck but well worth the napkins, the fishermans platter (or Portuguese sea food dish), is one of the best, and the Portuguese mussles and or clams is a real treat.  Overall I have to say that my original review though still good was not reflective of the entire menu, so I thought an update was required to give this place it's well deserved praise."
/user_details?userid=fmd6GmTvKh5UKyhud6kYxg,Cody J.,"Riley Park, Vancouver, Canada",1 star rating,"I've never skipped a tip in my life, but the service at Chez-Doval was intentionally disrespectful and quite unacceptable. On the up side, they did have really excellent grilled chicken and grilled squid. He was clearly bothered that we didn't order 2 entrees. Our 1 Grilled Chicken entree and grilled squid appetizer was more than enough food for the two of us. We even ordered a half-litre of wine. We were very full and satisfied with the food! One star: He forgot to bring the wine before the food, then finally came around after we finished eating. We had to ask about dessert, which was ""already put away"" and unavailable at 9:30.  He deliberately refused to come back to collect our credit card for payment for almost 20min after delivering the check. We were long past ready-to-go, so we had to just forget about the tip and leave barley enough cash for the bill on the table before walking out."
/user_details?userid=augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg,Coy W.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,This is such a good place for Portugese food.  After some mediocre Portugese food in Ottawa yesterday I made the most out of my trip to Montreal.  I dropped into Chez Doval to get some chicken and fries.  I came in after lunch but if you come to this place for dinner there is a chance that it will be packed and you will be waiting in line.The chicken is amazing as always!  It was cooked perfectly but the best part was being able to smell of the food cooking from the kitchen.The service is always great and the portions are pretty good!I've had the steak and pork and clams from this place and they are also top notch choices!
/user_details?userid=njgxaG5NTgld3or9yEb-Vg,Lee K.,"Hicksville, NY",4 star rating,Amazing grilled chicken!! We were in vacation in Montreal and needed to have some portugese chicken!

/user_details?userid=OKdBpBT7TiDeE29Tz_5jFA,Am B.,"Communauté-Urbaine-de-Montréal, Canada",4 star rating,Doval shrimps and Portuguese chicken were great! I'm not a fan of rice yet I loved theirs. Negatives: The mussels were average and the service was a bit slow. Go on a quiet night if you don't want to wait.
/user_details?userid=SH6uAOR2Vjp5ARuSeMKyag,Dave S.,"Stockton, CA",5 star rating,"Just the type of place I love.  We came in for lunch.  The food was excellent.  If you are a fan of grilled seafood or meat, as well as stews, this is the place for you.  The wine was good and the service was very friendly.  The pricing is very good considering that the bulk of the food is meat with most meals in the $15-20 range.  I really like these little local restaurants which are pretty much like a small diner in the US.  They have another room in the back with a full bar, live music at night, and I understand some loud political discussions.   Sounds fun!"
/user_details?userid=nxDUXP1y2Nh6vG8BCX_JXw,Jay M.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"We went fully prepared for great food and surly service. Upon arrival, the place was packed, so we sat at the bar right in front of the grill. Best seats in the house as far as we're concerned. The service was quick and to the point. I've spent 15 years working in restaurants and these guys are *busy*. There isn't enough time to dote on needy patrons. The food speaks for itself.We started with the grilled octopus app. Shared a litre of the house red. She had the grilled sardines and I had the chicken as the main. Best dining experience during our Montreal trip. We'll definitely return.Just before we left, the guitarist came out and started entertaining the guests. Don't let anyone suggest that Chez Doval isn't welcoming."
/user_details?userid=C1aZwPN5HgZsbzEIU_0V1w,Mimi N.,"Brooklyn, NY",2 star rating,"**First off, I find it important to mention that if they have run out of the fish of the day, don't get fish.  Contrary to what they say, it will be frozen.**After reading the reviews for this place, I was a little worried about the service here but was optimistic that it wouldn't be too bad.  Unfortunately, it was.  We had to wait an extremely long time for our food.  Two other tables that arrived long after us got their food much sooner.  When we questioned the waiter, he rudely remarked that it was the grouper that takes a long time to cook (which is rubbish, because fish grills up very quick).  When the grouper finally arrived, it was tough and tasteless.  The waiter had told us it was fresh, but it obviously had been frozen and that was why it took so long to prepare... and that's also why it was tough.  The chicken tasted good though it was mostly bones, and the fries were very greasy.  The squid came to the table cold.Beforehand we had had garlic shrimp for appetizer.  The shrimp were very well cooked but hadn't picked up any flavor from the flavorful broth they came in.  Wee also had grilled sardines which were pretty good.As if our own waiter wasn't lacking enough in courtesy, there was another old waiter who was very grumpy and rude.  He is constantly grimacing at everyone and brushes people off when requests are made.This is probably the first time in my life that I left no tip."
/user_details?userid=UvZKaPFy85iPjoB2Aj40kQ,Oleg R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Best portuguese place in town. Located in the heard of the portuguese area in Plateau this place is always packed. They do not take reservations so you gotta take a risk. Everything on the menu is great - chicken, beef, porc, seafood. Try their house porto - its killer. Service is great - all authentic portuguese. Good cheap date place. Walking distance from st. denis and mont royal - all the places to go for drinks after dinner."
/user_details?userid=DuPV4MXp9jYwlx1eUiPjxg,Robert L.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,The chicken and calamari are amazing.  Much of their food is grilled over an open fire- using maple wood.  Simple and delicious.This is a true Portuguese grill outside of Portugal.  DELECTABLE !!!!!!!!Muito Bom.
/user_details?userid=lRczcXlbFVEHYhQH6x3SnQ,Mark M.,"TX, TX",4 star rating,"One of our favorite meals while in Quebec.  We were sent here by a local to whom we are very grateful.  As I am hardly an expert on matters Portuguese, I cannot speak to authenticity, but I am quite proficient at eating, and we were happy campers at Chez Doval.  Salads were plain but yummy, with a delicious but light dressing.  Roast chicken was well-seared, yet tender and delicious.  Steaks were outstanding as well.  Even the fries were difficult to resist.  Large portions -- come hungry."
/user_details?userid=8apKnC2iVfWnfB4cIgUBMw,Jason L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This mainstay of grilled Portuguese delights has been permeating the connecting walls to their neighbours and littering the air with whiffs of charcoal smoke for 37 years. The waitstaff has probably been there for most of that time as well, so have the menu items and recipes. Like I mentioned, the crassness of the waiters adds to the ""charm"" of Chez Doval. Their ""take no bullshit"" attitude plus the Export As' in their pockets, multiplied by the smell of smoke on their breath is pretty much a clear indication of where you're eating. Eating at Chez Doval is like your uncle had to open up the basement to fit more people in at the family dinner BBQ; you're not allowed to look behind the bar or touch any of the miniature figurines, only you're not sitting at an old card table or using napkins bought on sale from ""Cumberland""."
/user_details?userid=WX6Xv1uhnOSAZT2GWJvD8w,Herve E.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Very authentic but incredibly noisy at lunch time. The second room seems to be favored by the Portuguese-speaking workers--that's where you want to sit if you want the full experience.  Fresh and simple cuisine, nothing fancy. I wouldn't go there for dinner, though."
/user_details?userid=R3j9EzQCoxtv-VmNmY2x1Q,Anne C.,"Mont-Royal, Canada",5 star rating,"I just moved  next to this restaurant and was always finding myself following the delicious smokey smells that comes out of this place. I finally ate their with my boyfriend and a friend. The friend ordered the grilled chicken, my boyfriend a steak, and I, the seafood plate. We also ordered french fries on the side. I have to say, their portions are gigantic!!! And still delicious! The meats were well cooked, grilled to perfection. The side salads and fries crunchy and tasty. As for the sea food plate, I suggest you share it with someone! You get a half lobster, fish, mussels, clams lying on a bed of spicy rice with tomatoes. It is divine!As other reviewers have pointed out, the service is not super friendly. However, even though the waiter we had was not very talkative, he was still very attentive and helpful with the menu. Finally, by the time we were all devouring our plates, we had the chance to listen to the waiters and to the on spot guitarist. I really enjoyed the warm ambiance that created. The boys felt it was too noisy... I definitely will come back here and go for the sea food plate again, it was sooo good! I warmly recommend this place :D"
/user_details?userid=H0-yYUhuPuc_m7sgs9fdJA,Eric W.,"Lachine, Canada",1 star rating,"So me and my girlfriend are in montreal and we decide to dine somewhere with decent reviews averaging above 4.0, so we end up here. First we ordered a beer and the shrimp and cod nuggets as appetizers along with the grilled chicken as a main course. The appetizers and beer arrive in about 10 minutes, they were good. We proceed to wait in this restaurant for AN ENTIRE HOUR after our appetizers and finally receive our chicken at which point we just want to leave. We decide to try the chicken first and then get the rest packed up for take out. The chicken was really good but the waiter we had (grey moustache with glasses) was more than rude about packing up our food to go, not to mention he was rude and not helpful the entire time we were there. This place has potential to be a good restautant they just need to fire old man grumps and speed up the service a bit. All in all the food was good, but the service was so awful that i am not going again."
/user_details?userid=_K9sKlA4fVkWI4hyGSpoPA,Robert G.,"Clackamas County, OR",2 star rating,"Nothing has changed.  The food is the same - good, but not great.  Service is somewhere between obligatorily courteous and aloof.  I'm not really aware of other popular Portuguese restaurants in Montreal (except for high-end dressy Cafe Ferreira), so go on in wearing casual attire, eat a filling meal, and don't expect to have this place rock your world.  They now have more competition in the area, so I would find it hard to put up with the brusqueness that one can only sort of tolerate if and when in Portugal."
/user_details?userid=RRsbPGYyKJ3zqMMkzcHZaQ,Lenny Z.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,"Really nice little spot off the beaten path. A great casual Portuguese grill. The service was very good, although near the second half of our dine the joint was packed and the waiter was having a hard time keeping up. The sausage app was real good. The steak was pretty good too. As was the grilled chicken. This is not high end fancy spot, so don't come here expecting anything but traditional Portuguese grilled food."
/user_details?userid=Tmbv0zu_HL09tNHtpjXOFg,Wesley H.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,I signed up to warn people of this place. After reading the reviews I thought I would take my parents to this place and give it a try. Seriously... why would anyone give this place a 5 star? The food is the worst.. you would be better off going to  Eaton center food court where you would get way better chicken and overall quality of food than this place. As soon as I walked in I knew this place was a con job and a tourist trap. They even play some music to try to make you forget about the bad food. AVOID!!!
/user_details?userid=-njC3scq41FLpi89cuy5yQ,Mike H.,"Ramona, CA",5 star rating,This is probably one of the best places I have ever eaten.  Simple and delicious Portugese food.  I had grilled Octopus with French Fries and a Salad and my wife had grilled Chicken with Fries and salad.  We went back and I had grilled Calamari and my wife had quail.  It was all delicious.  The house wine was good too.  The atmosphere is active and the service is attentive.  It was really an experience I will remember.

This was in the neighborhood where we were staying at and upon recommendation we tried it. Very small restaurant, which seems to be typcial of this neighborhood (?). i ordered a grilled octopus. I was debating betwn the grilled squid and octopus and since i never had octopus I decided to try it. The portion was big however, the meal was bland. There wasn't any flavor on the octopus. Meal came w/ a big potato, of which I only had half of. I'd prob return to give them another try."
