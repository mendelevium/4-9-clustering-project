/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"On a terribly cold and rainy day, when the all seemed dark and dreary, a few paninis from Joe's made things a little brighter. Based on a longer story, but in a way by fluke, I ended up with two sandwiches. Perhaps, it was meant to be as I ended up eating them both right away on the sidewalk, despite the rain.The first was their tuna which can be made more spicy that I requested. The sandwich which was tightly wrapped after being warmed just enough on the panini press. I hit the spot and seemed to have some kind of an onion or red bell pepper based relish which added to the overall taste. Their rolls are quite a signature of this longstanding and well liked around-the-corner-spot. I say around the corner, since if you don't pay attention you can keep walking right by it. Ironically, they have a somewhat shiny sign that is curved towards the main street -- however, it still seems a place with a word-of-mouth-those-in-the-know kind of vibe or shall we say; cool factor.The second sandwich was a real stand-out, as I was not expecting such plump fresh mozzarella slices with a unique and delicious basil infused mayonnaise to make it a nice rich treat. There were also tomatoes if I recall correctly, that rounded out this memorable vegetarian bite.  I thought that I would be too full for dinner after downing these two paninis late afternoon, but somehow I managed. If they had been two of their items with heavier fillings (they have options), I doubt it would have been the case."

Apparently, it is kind of a popular spot. However, their paninis didn't leave me speechless. It is pretty basic. I believe that there are much better paninis out there!"

I stopped at Joe's Panini a few weeks back while in search of a non Tim Horton's breakfast on a Saturday morning. This little shop had a good look to it and even though the staff wasn't exactly top of the line friendly or even remotely talkative, I didn't care because in a weird way it kind of matched the vibe of the place. I ended up ordering a BLT panini with a brownie on the side (the brownie was for later, I just couldn't pass it up). The food took a decent amount of time to come out but the cree seemed to be in the middle of cleaning when I came in so I wasn't bothered by it. The actual Bacon, Lettuce, and Tomato panini was delicious when it was done and left me wondering why panini places weren't more common, because this place was great!Overall, this place definitely lacked friendly customer service but made up for it with some really good food and that's something I will take! If you want an early breakfast in the downtown area, come to Joe's Panini!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Cheap and affordable decent food. It's rare to find a place in downtown where you can get a panini, a drink, a salad and a dessert for 10$ + tax, but this is one of the places. I tried the spicy chicken panini. Can't say it was delicious, but it was good enough. It wasn't too spicy and there's no awesomeness to it. It pretty much tastes like what it looks like. The quinoa salad was very bland even with the sauce. On the other hand, the pastries were amazing. I tried the chocolate croissant and the almond croissant and both were delicious and not too sweet with a slight crisp on the outside. The wait was a bit long even though it was almost 11pm. People kept coming in even when it was -25 degrees outside. Can't imagine how packed this place would be during warmer days. The staff is nice and friendly. Would definitely come back if I feel like a peasant and want cheap food."

My friend would always tell me about this place so I figured I would try it some day.When we arrived, we had to wait outside because it was super packed. And from what I heard, it's always like this. We got in, we ordered from the menu on the wall and got my panini 7mins later. Be patient, because if it's that packed, it will take some time. We at there. Not a big place, there was maybe 3 tables/booth.  I wasn't expecting much  honestly, but the panini was pretty good! The bread, the meat... I really can't complain. I had a poulet grillé (grilled chicken) panini. This is now my go-to for a panini fix! It's open 24/7, so if you're going out, have a late night  and have a craving, it's the place to go!"

It's somewhat-greasy fast food, so don't be expecting any froufrou gourmet paninis here.For $7.83 ($9 taxes included) you can get a panini, a drink, and your choice of soup, salad or dessert. It was approaching midnight, and we wanted a snack so we ordered a trio to share. The guy working at the counter was even nice enough to offer to cut the panini in half for us. We got the smoked turkey panini, a garden salad and a can of pop. The turkey was deli meat, which was expected. It had cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and a tad too much mayo for my liking. Nonetheless it was good. The salad was romaine lettuce with 1 cherry tomato and 1 slice of cucumber. The dressing came on the side and was oil and balsamic vinegar. Staff were friendly and efficient.  Not gourmet fare, but good for late night munchies."
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,"I mean... I think the reason this place has such a rep is because of it's central location to Downtown Montreal and the fact that it's open 24/7. Their sandwiches have good flavour and are relatively cheap (we were able to get 3 sandwiches for under $17. The ""Philly cheese steak"" sandwiches are very flavourful, while I found the spicy chicken sandwich was not spicy at all and the chicken was a bit on the dry side. The place blasts their music so no chance to have a convo here... the furniture is run-down but I guess the type of clientele who eat here really don't care about that kind of thing lol The bread is yummy and I would only go back if I was craving something cheap and on the go!"

I stuck with the regular white, and while it could have been more buttered up and more crispier, it was a cheap and a simple bite to grab.  Service was friendly, and there were some seats inside to enjoy your grub.  Just note that they only accept Canadian credit or cash.+24-hour panini shop+friendly staff+Canadian credit or cash only"

/user_details?userid=YKm-0aMn46Yi0Re2lN1XRQ,Ivy L.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"A true one dollar sign store. 5.50$ paninis, all very delicious. I've tried prosciutto and brie, grilled chicken, spicy sausage, philly cheesesteak, turkey, spicy tuna and spicy chicken. Favorites are spicy sausage and philly cheesesteak. Least favorite is grilled chicken: the meat was too dry. The only downside is that there is very little vegetables in them, which doesn't affect the taste, but just makes me feel guilty. Usually one panini is enough, but when you're really really hungry, you should get two. They also have cookies for 1$ each. They're not bad, very thin and sweet, should eat with milk (which they also have).Overall the food and price are worth 3.5 stars. Extra 0.5 for the location, the 24h, and the niceness of the employees. Would love to taste their breakfast options when I get the chance."

Arrived at destination, pondered the menu while looking around then finally placed my order.Philly Cheesesteak panini: Perfect sized baguette bread, toasted to crunchy but not burnt. Steak was beautifully marinated, sliced and cooked, not tough nor chewy. Bell peppers were medium cooked, soft yet has crunch factor. Onions are nicely caramelized and cheese was nicely melted. The combination made the best panini I have ever tasted. Service was great too. Given it was like 8:30am on a Monday morning. Definitely coming back when in town again."

Went with the promising yelp reviews.  For 9 CAD you get a panini, chips and a drink, which is a pretty good deal. You can also get panini, soup/salad and drink for same price. I got the spicy chicken panini which was grilled chicken with some kinda hot sauce. The bread itself is tasty and crunchy and hot!The place is rather small with 3 to 4 tables and some standing room. You pay at the counter, they accept debit cards but no credit cards. They also have coffee based drinks, croissants, cookies etc. Best part about Joe's is that it's open 24/7 - so if you're looking for some post partying hunger quenching Joe's your spot."

I decided to come here since I saw that Jennifer K has been here.We settled on splitting a ham and cheese panini and a chocolate croissant. The ham and cheese panini was nothing to rave about. However, the chocolate croissant was awesome! There was just the right amount of fillings and it wasn't overly sweet. The top of the croissant was perfectly crunchy. It was so good, we had to come back here before we left Montreal just to buy two more chocolate croissant."

/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"There's not really much to say about Joe's Panini other than the fact that the food tasted incredibly average. Maybe it was because I was sober at the time, but everything about my sandwich seemed a little... Off? I ordered the grilled chicken panini, and while the bread was nicely toasted, the chicken was quite dry and therefore ruined the whole flavor scheme for me, and it tasted kind of bland overall. Normally when I'm extremely hungry as I was then, I would be satisfied with anything to satiate my appetite, but I was overall not impressed.Props to them for having nicely-sized bottles of Orangina, though."

The bread was good but the cheese steak felt off, the meat tasted burnt and the cheese was a little on the short side.I felt somewhat disappointed after reading and getting into the hype for Joe's Panini but I guess I maybe took the wrong sandwich for the economic pricing of the place. I figure I'll re-visit this joint again at some point in the future when I find myself in the area and grab something else and adjust my review at that point."

/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"I Finally got around to trying Joe's Panini after all the good things I had heard. I stopped in for a quick lunch. First off, this is a no frills sandwich and pastry joint open 24 hours and is mainly a take out spot as the restaurant itself is very small (although they have a few tables for seating). The prices are ridiculously cheap as you can see in all the previous reviews and service is quick and efficient, but still friendly to get you fed and on your way ! They have a variety of different Panini's to choose from that you can order on their own or as a trio. I love sandwiches almost as much as I love pizza. So needless to say, I was very excited about this place. I tried their italian Panini which is filled with italian cold cuts, cheese and bruschetta on fresh bread and I can safely say, it hit the spot.  The only thing I didnt like was that I found the music was way too loud, especially that the space is small and is already noisy on its own , it makes it hard to hear the order numbers being called out. But ,aside from that , I am looking forward to going back and trying more of their Panini options since I had so much trouble picking just one when I went , everything sounded so good ! ....and who am I kidding , i'll definitely be trying their pastries too :) ."

The spicy chicken was his recommendation and I grabbed a bottle of water to go with it.And then I went to my wallet. Oops - no Canadian cash left. No worries, he let me pay with American. Your mileage may vary.The sandwich was excellent. The right size and with a good amount of chicken and spiciness.On the minus side of the equation, there was no wifi in the place and the table where I sat was sticky. Minor details."

I grew up eating real authentic paninis from local bakeries in east end Montreal. I have very high expectations when it comes to the quality of the bread, cold cuts, cheese and pickled toppings. Simply put, Joe's panini just doesn't cut it for me. They're sandwiches are ok, decent at most. Nothing to rave about to be honest, everything is pretty basic. On the plus side, they are open 24/7. Therefore if you're downtown late and hunger strikes, you could always head here."
/user_details?userid=izdAXYjPdwaztxuT6C7GvQ,Jane S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,Came here on a hot summer day for a quick no fuss lunch. All the sandwiches are made on the spot with fresh ingredients. I loved the baguette they used which tasted fresh and had the perfect crunchy outer with a soft interior. Prices range around the $4-$5 mark for a panini. The seating area has a mix of outdoor/indoor. They blast much music vibes videos of hip hop and RnB on a tv situated across from the counter where you order. The tables are cheap and plastic and you sit on benches or cafeteria style chairs. This is a no-fuss eating zone and that's exactly the way I like it. There isn't a large amount of seating so you might be hard pressed to find seating on a busy lunch rush. They often have lines during popular meal times.Overall would come back if I was craving a good sandwich.

I usually get the grilled chicken panini and I've never been disappointed. For a cheap sandwich, you'd expect less but nope, it's actually ridiculously good. I've also tried their breakfast plate (eggs, toast, sausage, bacon, coffee, etc). It's also pretty good, it reminds me of home actually-- very home style breakfast. Their Mac and cheese is awesome! The portions are fairly big and it tastes very gourmet and not at all like KD (though I do like Kraft dinner). They also have a chicken Caesar salad which probably stands in second place with regards to what I order the most. There really isn't anything too special about it. Just tastes like any other chicken Caesar salad you would get at a non-salad based joint. What I like is that instead of being ridiculously overpriced (I'm talking to you Mandy's), it's only a little bit over priced at I think around $7. I'd probably give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for that one time I bought two pastries (one chocolate croissant and another chocolate type pastry, can't remember what). But the croissant was super stale-- I could taste how old it was-- and the other chocolate thing had already gone bad; When I opened the brown paper bag, all I smelled was disaster. Oh and also, the macaroni salad tastes like nothingness.But other than that, I love Joe's!"

/user_details?userid=NjtdK8G5kqI1M3fKfrhmaw,Jess L.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Super let down by this place based on the great reviews they had. We ordered paninis for 4 people and every single order was wrong. One person who is super lactose intolerant had requested no cheese on their panini and their panini arrived loaded with cheese. We also requested the paninis on whole wheat and they showed up on white. Super disappointing. 24 hours is definitely convenient but this place should be a last resort, if at all."
/user_details?userid=KcFMI-hsr2Em7whfI4OM5g,Katya P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"With a slogan advertising themselves as the best panini in Montreal, I was hoping for something remarkable. Yes the panini was good, decent selection of sandwiches and sides and it's awesome that they're open 24h, but it remains just good, nothing special.Best to grab and go, as there's not much seating and this small joint looks rather dreary. Also, super noisy tv or radio blaring 90's hits.I found the panini quite small so this is ideal as a snack or lunch. For the same price and simplicity of ingredients, I think I'd just prefer getting a 12 inch Subway where I can at least get a bit of zing from the sauce.There's actually a restaurant in the Eaton Centre food court called ""Panini"" that serves a much more delicious version with garlic mayo, which makes all the difference.No free wifi, and they don't accept credit cards. Boo."

This place is right up the street from out hotel and I book marked it when looking for places in the area. I cannot say enough good things about the food. I had the spicy chicken panini, it was under $5 for just the sandwich which is a steal for how great it is. The chicken is definitely good quality and seasoned amazingly. Its actually got a great kick to it not that fake spicy a lot of places have. The panini was filling, I'm sure i could eat 2 but I know I shouldn't. 1 is enough. The service is fast and friendly. Someone barged in demanding their order faster and the cashier remanded calm and dealt with the situation. Our orders were ready in 5 minutes and we sat there to eat.Im not sure what others are complaining about but I'll be grabbing 1 or 2 of these for my long bus ride home. If this place ever opens up in the GTA I'll be there all the time. I cant get enough its almost worth the 6 hour drive to Montreal."

I am speechless !Small little panini joint, i went there on a Sunday night so it was quiet but i wouldn't imagine going there on a Saturday or Friday night.. As the other reviews says its very busy during the week end. I don't like packed and busy restaurants, and it must get pretty filled since its right in the middles of downtown near all the bars.Their panini selection is extensive, all 5$, and you can get a trio for 8$ which is cheaper and much better than Subway or Cultures... And MUCH tastier.They also have a good vegetarian panini menu. I got a brie and pruscitto panini and my husband had the BBQ Rib panini. Wow what a flavour explosion, much better than any sandwich i had ever had. The BBQ rib was so tender and just nicely coated with sauce. We took a trio, water and cinnamon bun.They have a pretty good salad and extra bars, which you can get when you take the trio, either chips, salad, soup or bakery. Everything is filling and much more cheaper than other fast sandwich joints i have been. They also have a huge drink selection(4 fridges) If you aren't in the mood to be in a crowded place don't go during weekend nights, but please try this place whenever you can for a flavour orgy with your taste buds.

After a long night of NYE partying at New City Gas, my starving friends and I decided to pop into Joe's for a quick bite before bed. First thing I did was grab a water to rehydrate from a long night of dancing to house music. The water was crisp, cold, refreshing, just what I needed to start my meal of right.Next I went to order, this was a big part of my dining experience. Being an American speaking no French I asked the friendly worker for help. He guided me towards the Philly Cheese, and I grateful accepted his suggestion. As my friends and I waited for out panini's to be prepared, I got to hear one of thief stories about him driving out of Montreal to hook up with a girl he met from the club, really spiced up the pre meal anticipation. Then it happened. ""Philly number ninety three!"" I raced over to grab my sandwich with my stomach growling. I unwrapped the tin foil and got right into it, and all I can say is just WOW. The balanced of the flavones, the streak, the bread, the cheese!  We all are our panini's with pure joy in our hearts for the next 20 minutes. From here we thanked the friendly staff for an incredible meal and continued on to bed. Upon waking up in the morning and talking about breakfast options there was only one place to go, Joe's. I got my spicy chicken and we headed on our long journey home. No Montreal trip is complete without a stop at here. Long live Joe's Panini!"

You can also get a Trio for $9.00 tax IN!

Also, they do have brown bread for the panini's but you need to tell them when you order otherwise they will give you white bread by default. The place is suuuuuper small. It fits about 10 people snugly. If they are busy, there may not be any available places to sit... it is sort of 'that' small. Very casual environment. DOES NOT TAKE CREDIT CARD THOUGH!

However,  Joe's gets bumped up to a 4, because 1) a large-size panini sets you back a little over $5 with tax and 2) it's open 24/7!! That alone is amazing, since this is one of the only places in the downtown  bar/clubbing area that's open at all times AND is super cheap. I won't lie, the place looks sketch as hell inside at night,  especially the seating.  Not the cleanest.  And you usually can expect some drama going on between patrons waiting in line,  since they are either hyped up and waiting to go clubbing or they are high as a kite and making a pit-stop to quench the munchies. I turn a blind eye to all this and just feel happy to have this option whenever hunger hits.  The panini itself (I always get the spicy tuna) is pretty tasty and fills me up. And even if it doesn't, eating two won't break the bank. Get in, keep your head down,  get the sandwich and get the heck out. I would even give Joe's a 5/5, but I will admit the  spicy tuna doesn't always sit well with me, but let's be honest, these are not gourmet ingredients. They also sell a couple sides like macaroni  or chickpea salad,  as well as some sweets and  breakfast items like yogurt. The line can be hardcore during lunch hour and on weekends late night."

/user_details?userid=FzNARdEEWnoQl9nEDzp3BQ,Nadine E.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Tuna panini was delish but not filling. $5.50 is not thaaaat cheap but considering how friggin expensive food here is... I guess it's like buying 2 bagels from Tim Hortons. Only take it to-go because the place is TINY despite the seemingly large storefront.
/user_details?userid=iXaUg4_AJd7dymrhV1B2bA,Nesh B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Chicken spicy pannini is one of the best orders you can make in this place. The quality is so great. It is worth even more than 5 dollars. There aren't much space to sit.
/user_details?userid=KCasYA9VAo2Wo7x1bQYHjA,Albert H.,"Stowe, VT",4 star rating,Pretty good sandwhiches. Its good place to go late night because its open 24 hours. Its not very high end but its a very good tasting snack. I would recommend the spicy chicken sandwich.

/user_details?userid=PJIMYeSJ6a47p4_t-LhH7g,Hera A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Delicious 24 hour joint! Try the Mac and cheese it's absolutely delicious. Their classic chicken sandwich is definitely a hit. I'm also a fan of the philly cheese steak!
/user_details?userid=h_-ZhN_mFN8QO-L46bewkA,J M.,"Alexandria, VA",4 star rating,"Arrived after midnight into the MTL and wasn't sure if I wanted to call it a night or not.  Got a tip from the front desk at the Sheraton to wrap it up with a panini at Joe's.   It was a great call.   I took in the ambience of his open-air, local hot-spot, soaking in youthful, diverse energy of its patrons.  Within a couple of minutes, some sort of hot chicken sub panini thingy arrived in my paws.   It was exceptionally good grub for that time of night.   The boys behind the counter take pride in their work, and I think that you'll enjoy dropping in too.   Enjoy!"

/user_details?userid=qn5F6kkmhZzW-2ofPpGHeg,Alexander B.,"Langhorne, PA",3 star rating,so the food is pretty good ill say. its pretty much the only place that's open late night and its always PACKED. they typically have very loud rap music playing which I don't mind and the place is always filled with drunks. the spicy chicken panini is my go to for sure. the only reason I am giving 3 stars is because its a bit of a free for all at night. theres people constantly stumbling in and out the doors and cutting the line. even when the place is completely packed people will still stand there shoulder to shoulder and eat their paninis preventing other people from ordering and the staff doesn't/can't really do anything about it. and I know it has nothing to do with this establishment and there isn't really anything they can do about it but I went there 4 times over the weekend and there is a homeless guy who lingers outside and BEGS you to give him one of your sandwiches. literally wont take no for an answer and will follow you all the way to the end of the block begging you to give him a sandwich relentlessly. I think on the fourth night my friend finally gave him like 2 or so dollars to leave us alone because he followed us across the street and we didn't want him following us into our hotel.

/user_details?userid=IryDYja2kFkQEYJ0Kw6GWw,S. S.,"Bloomington, IL",5 star rating,Arguably the best veggie burger I've ever had. The tomato and bocconcini and greek are pretty good as well. Taste is great no matter the hour.
