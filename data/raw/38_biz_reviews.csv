/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Since most of the better, more authentic-feeling latin American Restaurants are concentrated near Little Italy, it's nice to have La Capital in Chinatown. I've eaten there a few times, but their excellent takeout during the pandemic prompted me to write this review. Tacos are listed as coming in a set of 3 but actually they come in a set of four (they give you four tortillas and a very healthy portion of meat.) I love that they come separately you so can assemble them. For four tacos it's a much better value and they are delicious. Plus it makes it easier to share with my husband. My favorite are the al pastor (although i will say they give you a hilariously small slice of pineapple per taco.) I also really love the barbacoa quesadilla which is so thick and completely full of meat. Guac is standard but solid. They also give you all of the little salsas on the side so you can mix and match.  Service in person has always been fast and the people have always been nice. There's often a line since it's a very popular spot, but it's normally not too too crazy."

Everyone was satisfied with their options. The food came with all the toppings & sauces served at the restaurant. They ended up sending me 5 Ribeye Tacos! The flavours were excellent and everything tasted great and fresh, even though we assembled the Tacos at home.  The sauces were spicy and enough for everyone. Would definitely recommend ordering from here, as it tastes the same delivered like it does at the restaurant!"
/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"La Capital Tacos has been on my list of places to visit for so long, and I finally got to eat there! Overall it was good, but it was not as epic as I thought it was going to be, lol. Tacos come 3 per order and you can't mix types. I got the Pastor ($10), which was pork with onions, cilantro and pineapple. My husband got the Rosarito ($12.50), which was battered shrimp with cabbage and salsa. He also got a local beer, La Fontaine ($7).We came around 5:45pm on a Saturday and managed to snag a table for 2 quickly, but within 15 minutes the place got super busy, with line ups out the door.The food is definitely well priced and the flavours were great.We were brought some chips with refried beans. We assumed they were complimentary because we did not order them and it looked like every table had them. We dug in and the beans were delicious, as were the crunchy homemade chips. In the end there was a charge of $3.50 for ""Frijoles"" on our bill. My husband didn't say anything because the charge was not exorbitant and the chips and beans were indeed good, and I only found out after he paid and we had left, but I don't know if this is common practice at this restaurant to automatically bring you chips and dip and then charge you for it, or if there was some sort of genuine mistake and somehow the server thought we had ordered them o_OAnyway, my Pastor tacos were tasty, but I found the meat a bit on the fatty side. The filling was abundant, and the corn tortilla held up well and didn't fall apart. My husband enjoyed his shrimp tacos. I didn't have any, so can't comment on them. I can't say I loved the environment because although no one rushed us, I don't feel all that relaxed when a long lineup of people are staring at me and either consciously or unconsciously giving me the ""can you hurry up and eat so we can get out of the cold and eat too?"" look. Lol. We were sitting right by the door.  I think super popular places are just not for me. I like more relaxed places where we can take our time and linger and chat. I'm glad I tried it, but I think I'll just leave the popular places to the cool kids from now on ;)"

I had heard great things about this place and when i found myself in the area, I didn't miss the chance to go.But unfortunately, it was less than par. I ordered the quesadilla, while my friend ordered the rib-eye taco. We also ordered two drinks, margarita and mojito. They waitress told us they have the best margarita in town. Which is totally false, both of us did not enjoy our drinks asm the food was no better. The quesadilla was shredded chicken with cheese and they used cilantro as garnish which I do not like at all. Furthermore, the taco was not crispy, the ribeye was not seasoned and the only garnish was again cilantro. Yes service was fast, and maybe if they took their time they could give out better food.  Also the price  for the amount of food and alcohol they give you ridiculous."
/user_details?userid=ELMsVx1eTQ4fbs3BNcfSUA,Kelly H.,"Berlin, CT",5 star rating,"Hotel proximity, the casual atmosphere, and decent Yelp reviews brought us here first thing on our trip to Montreal.Flavorful guacamole and finely puréed refritos, more substance than salt, were a great start with our warm tortilla chips. The Ribeye, 3 corn tortillas, was great with the fruitful red wine the waiter recommended, and had a hint of spice without being vengeful. The Rosarito covered the bases for fish tacos with crunch, fruit, and spice. We weren't offered a kids meal but the portions were good for a little one (and what kid doesn't love chips?). That, and the colorful, casual atmosphere was unpretentious and pleasant for all ages. For us LCT was comfort food in a casual spot at the end of a long drive, and they got everything right. The menu was short, the food was tasty but arrived quick, and left us satisfied long after. Our Mexican/Latin cuisine, street tacos without the truck, on Chinese plates, in a Francophone city, with friendly staff sympathetic to our English, made this a great stop. ¡Muy bien!, très bien, well done overall. Not fine dining, yet so fine!"

It was packed when we walked up and we had to wait for 7 minutes before they could find us a table.I loved the vegetarian options, the beets are out of this world good and my wife raves about the beans. You get three tacos as a meal, the veggie tacos are excellent. If you love mushrooms then this is your meal. It wasn't very heavy either and the cheese added an extra level of flavor. It took 12 minutes for our food to come out which is fast because there wasn't an empty seat in the place. Apparently they have awesome drinks as the table next to us raves about the margaritas!I would most definitely recommend stoping here for a bite."

We took note because that kind of crowd on a weeknight seemed insane. When we walked back again closer to 11PM and it was STILL busy we knew we had to check it out.So the next afternoon at about 12:30 we stopped in. We were able to snag a bar spot without a wait. The margaritas were delish, and the tacos were even better. If I lived in town I would be here weekly. HIGHLY recommend."
/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Third updated review! I guess third time's a charm.I am so glad I gave this place another chance. After extremely slow service the last time, I don't know what made me choose to come to this place right before I was supposed to see a play at the Centaur theater. If it had been as slow as last time, I definitely would have missed the show. Thankfully, this time, service was fast and excellent!!We arrived around 6pm to an almost packed restaurant. By the time we got our food, a line had started to form. I was surprised to see it so busy on a tuesday! We started with the small guacamole which is more than enough for 2 people to share. They give a small bowl of chips but will give you more if you still have some guac left. This was great in reducing the ""chip to guac ratio"" anxiety that foodies often have. Phew!I ordered the ""Gringa"" and another quesadilla that must be new to their menu because I can't find the name on any of the menu pictures or on their website. The Gringa was a pulled porc quesadilla and the other one was a mix of chorizo and potato. Both were incredible and had so many layers of flavour. The potato/chorizo one was especially unique and I found the softness of the filling to go perfect with the shredded cabbage. Wonderful textures!My boyfriend had the special with was 4 fried tacos (kind of like taquitos) with shredded porc and other components that I can't remember. He loved it so much that it was difficult to convince him to let me taste! Once he did, I almost regretted my choice (as amazing as it was) because his was delish.Service was super quick and friendly. We didn't really have one waiter for our table and were served by a variety of employees. All were great.I am hoping this will be my last updated review and that the food and service will always be like it was last night."

I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was warmly greeted and given my choice of seat by the window. The Mexican music playing in the background set the mood nicely. I ordered a traditional margarita with Mezcal and asked my waiter for some dinner recommendations.  A few minutes later my order of refried black beans and Pastor tacos arrived, fresh and piping hot. The margarita on the rocks was way better than average, having a nice smokey flavor with a serious high-octane bite from the Mezcal. Nice! The beans and tacos were both delicous, the words simple and authentic come to mind. Total tab was $35 including tip which was a very good value in my book. I'll be back soon!"
/user_details?userid=wmXYo8UbPon5woxlOvVptA,Vanessa H.,"West Windsor Township, NJ",5 star rating,"This is hands down the best meal I've had in Montreal so far. The restaurant is located in China town and has incorporated some of that into their place. (Chinese plates etc) I was craving tacos and margaritas and found the closest place to my Airbnb. To my surprise, this place was absolutely incredible.Vegan tacos: hands down the best vegan tacos I've ever had at a restaurant. They used tofu skin which is something I've only seen in Chinese cuisine. It was absolutely perfection. The black beans had a good kick to them as well. I love how they don't tone down the flavors and heat to accommodate milder palates. The pastor tacos: really great combination of flavors and texture. The pineapple really made it and the sauce. The vegetarian quesadilla: a little messy but super tasty. The texture of the quesadillas are awesome. They're crispy and hold a good shape. For drinks, we had modelo and a margarita. All in all, this place is a restaurant you really don't want to miss out on."

/user_details?userid=jppvKiR_wSiShGdtDNA47g,Guitelle S.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"A really cool hipsterish taco place. My cousins and I came here on Friday after our long drive to Canada. It was walking distance from where we were staying right when you enter Chinatown. The place itself is small but they're able to fit a good amount people comfortably surprisingly. We got here right in time and got a seat at the last empty table before a crowd rush came. Their menu isn't extensive so it didn't take long to figure out what we wanted. We started off with drinks, I tried the mojito and my two cousins ordered jamika margaritas (I think that was the name). Our drinks were delish, refreshing, not sweet at all and strong. For the food we ordered guacamole and chips and refried beans and chips for our appetizers, we ordered the rib eye tacos for our entrees. It was really yummy just a little dry. I added the guacamole, beans and hot sauce to it and juiced that taco right up. All in all we had a great time here, the music was nice and the atmosphere was great. The people working here checked on us numerous times throughout our time here. The only CON was that I couldn't substitute the meat in the tacos which found kinda silly but it is what it is."
/user_details?userid=RxL3KOklOuN-j10w-nrWpw,Shirley B.,"Austin, TX",3 star rating,"La Capital Tacos is located in the Chinatown district of Montreal. Food: The menu is simple with sides, tacos, and quesadilla options. Tacos come three to an order. It's annoying you can't mix and match, so you'll have to order a full plate of three of whatever kind you want to try. We ordered the: Rosarito (battered deep fried shrimp) - mehPastor (pork with pineapple) - the best by farRibeye (beef in whole slices with a grilled spring onion) - not bad, but the whole slices made it hard to eat and it was missing  crunch, like onion or something of contrast in flavor. The quesadilla with mushrooms, cheese and chili was another tasty option albeit extremely greasy from the oils of the chili. Service: So-so. We walked in and the place was about 50% full and they were unsure where to seat us. There's bar seating at the bar in the middle and some small tables lined up against a wall to the right as you enter. Bar style seating that lines the windows looking out, a few other tables and chairs shoved in the middle and a massive family style table lining the far left wall where we were seated. Order was taken in a reasonable time and food comes out without too much of a wait. Overall: Quirky with the use of Chinese melamine plates and bowls. Silverware sits in a mason jar at each table. They take cash and card. Definitely give it a try."

Well, this place proved that it can be a very beautiful mixture of Latin warm with traditional-style Chinese. The food is just okay and I had better Mexican food elsewhere in Montreal and South shore. The service was quick and efficient. The menu choices were quite bare and the prices were high. Overall, the place is clean and the waitresses are very friendly. I wouldn't mind giving their tacos a try... However, the first time was a miss in term of food taste. I didn't taste much without overpouring the sauce and I missed out on the cheese in the quesadilla... I couldn't taste it. P.S: I took the vegetarian option - Quesadilla de Hongos."

This is such a great addition to the neighbourhood and to Montréal's Mexican food scene. Today we shared the vegan tacos and the pastor and both were good but the vegan was the standout and I freaking love that! Spiced chewy tofu skin, black beans, just awesome. I appreciate so much having both a veg and vegan option on the menu and having them be thoughtful and delicious and hearty. The room is kind of beautiful, I love the old wood chairs and woven wall hangings and the variety of seating options including a big farmhouse style communal table. The service was warm, welcoming, bilingual and quick and we didn't feel rushed even after we'd finished eating and paid. A great spot and great experience, can't wait to go back."

/user_details?userid=pmeGrUv6S22pf38FTRYCzg,Ashley P.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"We were spending the weekend in Montreal and had a craving for tacos. I did a quick search for the best tacos in Montreal and this place came up as #1. The reviews were great and we were excited to try this place.We got the restaurant at 7:30pm on a Sunday night. It was packed, but they were quickly able to find a spot for us (a table for two). I saw they have two vegetarian tacos options on the menu so we decided to try them both. We also ordered Mexican coke, which was nice. Our drinks came out right away after we ordered. But it took nearly an hour for our 2 orders of tacos to arrive at the table (1 order of mushroom tacos and 1 order of tofu tacos). I looked around at the other tables and it seemed like they had to wait an extremely long time for their food to arrive too. By the time our food came to the table, I was starving and ready to eat. Unfortunately our tacos were not warm and they had no toppings. The tofu tacos were just shredded tofu with sauce. No fresh toppings, just a sprinkle of cilantro. Our mushroom tacos were lukewarm and they also came with no toppings. Just a small side of pico di gallo and 1 slice of radish each on the taco. No slaw, no lettuce, no nothing. We waited over an hour for a plate of sad looking tacos. There was hardly any filling in the tacos too. I have no idea why this place gets such great reviews. This was certainly now how I wanted to spend our last night in Montreal."

We shared the pastor, ribeye, carnitas, cochinita and rosarito. My personal fave were the pastor and cochinita. The ribeye's grilled beef was too dry and lacked flavor. The rest were good, but not more than that. Both the guacamole and crispy cheese were good, but overpriced. Drinks are worth trying (I enjoyed all), but they're slightly overpriced."
/user_details?userid=imSdrMx1w_N8aXC9Mau95Q,Eric Y.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",4 star rating,"For the time I was in Montreal, I was pretty sure I've gorged myself on all types of Canadian staples already. I wanted something much more interesting and when I read about a taqueria that has managed to pop up in Montreal's Chinatown, I had to have it. My friend and I wandered in and seated ourselves at the bar two hours before closing. At first I thought it was odd that we hadn't been served or attended to but I noticed that they were slammed. I love the quasi Asian-Mexican ambiance of La Capital, especially the waving cat with the luchador mask! My friend and I decided to order the guacamole and chips to start and the Pastor and Carnitas tacos for entrees. For drinks I ordered a caipirinha while my friend had a jarrito. The tacos came first. The Pastor taco was perfectly seasoned. Although I typically do not like raw onions, they complimented the flavors of the taco, giving a contrasting bite to the taco. The hint of sweetness brought on by the pineapple accents the pork. Already convinced that La Capital knew what they were doing, I tried my friend's Carnitas taco. It's a shame I didn't get a picture (cause I ate it). The Carnitas were delicious as well. The meat itself, despite looking dry, was so succulent and juicy that it didn't need any extra sauces. After eating our three tacos each, my friend and I decided to split the Cochinita Pibil Tacos. It tasted similar to the carnitas but had a different flavor profile. What really stood out about the Cochinita Pibil was the accompaniment on top. Having the picked onions with the taco really highlighted the flavor of the pork. On the side they had their house spicy pickled onions. What seemed like a normal onion, was probably one of my favorite things about La Capital. The initial heat of the onions gave way to a sweet-sour picked onion flavor. Their bartender told me that they pickle the onions with spicy peppers and nothing else, preserving the white translucency of the onion. Out of all the foods I've eaten in Montreal for this most recent trip, I think that La Capital tops the charts in food I've eaten. It's funny but I came to Montreal expecting my favorite thing to either be poutine or the bagels but La Capital Tacos takes the win."
/user_details?userid=xg_96kkO-lF9oCc1PzrQgA,Leo L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my top 3 taco places in Montreal. This little Mexican Restaurant lost in the middle of China Town is the real deal. They even respect the neighborhood by serving you the tacos in Chinese plates. My favorite tacos here are the Pastor and the Cochinita. Appropriate style and adequate quantity. Usually this is my drunk food spot. Their salsas are good, but they can always improve them. I suggest you ask the waitress/waiter for the proper level of spiciness you're looking for. The refried beans are amazing! One can dip the chips in those beans without hesitation and go over three cups without blinking an eye. I also suggest the famously known ""Gringa"", which is basically two pastor tacos ""sandwhiched"" with grilled cheese. Perfection.The quesadillas also are fabulously made: Tortillas are on spot and flavors are well for meat eaters and vegetarians.  Don't miss out on the guacamole!You can add some Mexican cervezas (beer) to the equation, or if you don't drink, Mexican soft drinks (Jarritos, Sidral).TIP: You MUST come here several times in order to try out its varied menu. Yup, this is one of the best tips I have ever written."

The pulled pork was overly dry & really lacking in flavour as well. The batter of the shrimp tacos was mushy. Unfortunately, every single dish was absolutely disappointing.

Having been in Mexico for a summer, I was excited to see Tacos al Pastor (meat with pineapple, onion and cilantro). However, I was slightly disappointed because you only get one tiny slice of pineapple on each taco! I recommend asking for more pineapple if you can. Additionally, you get 3 small corn tacos (which are very filling) for about $10-12. I find this to be a bit expensive considering the entree does not come with any side dishes.Finally, this meal doesn't come with chips and/or salsa! We added on a side of guacamole, but revived a tiny bowl of about 10 chips. This guac was about $7 which I find to be ridiculous! I was slightly disappointed with La Capital, but the wait service was very good."

I was not very hungry so I had one plate of taco (3 in each plate). It seems not much but very filling. The portion was generous than other places. The el pastor was always my favorite. It is also the most inexpensive, no-frill taco in Mexican cuisine. The grilled onion was a little bit different than the one I had but it's OK. I guess we don't have that type of onion here. My husband had a rib eye taco which he loved very much.Will come back for other dishes."

Weird to see a small Mexican taco restaurant, smack dab in the middle of Chinatown.Went with a group of 6 people,so we all shared and swapped tacos to taste everything  They were good, we ordered the ribaye, fish and the pulled pork. The ribaye and fish tacos were good but the pulled pork was just ok. The drinks were tasty, a little bit too much ice but at least you could taste the alcohol. Tequila shots are the average price 5$ each. The tacos vary from 10$-15$. The entree/side are about 5$-9$. The bathrooms needs some fixing,especially the door they're really hard to close.

I had as an appetizer the chicharron de queso (crispy cheese) which was simple but delicious. I had the carnitas tacos which were great and well seasoned. If you like spicy, a must try is their homemade jalapeño sauce! My biggest surprise was the sinqueso quesadilla. The mix of chorizo and sweet potato is one of the best things I've ever tried. Vibe is like any taqueria with a fast but average service and the prices are okay. I also like the unique incorporation of typical red dishes that you seen in Chinese restaurants since it is situated in Chinatown. You will see me here again for sure!"

I could have ordered round after round of the shrimp tacos, it was like a flavour bomb going off during each bite. Amazing!Also tried the jamaika margarita and it was delish!

It's absurd to think that a country or a neighborhood define a cuisine, and every time I had passed by here before I saw a crowd, so on a hot afternoon we marched up for Mexican.Three of us came in on a tour de force of the neighborhood, and tacos were the first stop of the day. Between the three of us we shared an order each of al pastor and vegan tacos. Both were tasty, but it was the salsa that really cranked them up and over the edge. On their own I would say that they're good, with the salsa I'd say it would be hard not to want to come back and try all the things on the menu.The big window in front is what drew my attention in the first place, and once inside it lets in plenty of light and lets you watch the heavy foot traffic outside. We sat at a large table in the middle, but seating isn't too bounteous at this small shop. Still, the server was never rushing us, while still being quick about his business. It was such a lovely afternoon and this was the best way to start the food march. Six tacos divided by three people left us plenty of room for more adventure. When I come back again, I'd love to come back on a similar journey. To come back with someone who plans their day--their trips--based on the food they might encounter. We'd load up the Yelp Collections with ideas and then set out on the city to try as many as possible. Tacos would make the list."

The restaurant has community (mostly elbow to elbow) seating but the atmosphere and the wall art make up for it. The carnitas were very tender and flavorful! Each plate came with three tacos loaded with meat! The pastor was Smokey and had a nice crunch to it with just a hint of spice. Bartender whipped up Jamaikan Margeritas which featured hibiscus syrup, sweet but not an overkill of sugar. FYI- if you don't eat pork or beef, options are limited to the vegan tacos or veggie quesadilla. Wish they had more for us chicken lovers but still had a great experience overall!"

Not only was it a nice atmosphere, but service was incredible (brought us out food within minutes of ordering) despite it being pretty full and I was able to get what I needed for under 20 bucks. In addition, the food was incredibly tasty. The shrimp was incredibly fresh, so much so that it melted in your mouth like 2-methylbuta-1, 3-diene on a warm winter day on the 4th of April 1847 on a small island in between Moscow, Russia and the island of Fiji. Sorry for that imagery, but I had to note that it was an exceptional shrimp taco. Overall,definitely deserves a 5 stars for its atmosphere, service, and food !!"
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,This. Is. It. The best guacamole I've ever had (not counting the one my boyfriend makes). It tastes so creamy and avocad-y and delicious. They do sprinkle some tomatoes and onions at the top but I just scooped those out. It also has a small hint of lime which I loved.I ordered the beef quesadilla and it was so goooooood. A great mix of beef and cheese (which I dipped into my guacamole). I also got to try their frijoles refritos and watch out Ta Chido. They serve theirs lukewarm and it makes such a difference.Super fun restaurant. Tacos in chinatown? Heck yeah. Everything was served in oriental dishes and it looked so cool. Everyone was friendly while they were serving us. So worth it!
/user_details?userid=2wdHRk9mRN3zjHDS66ENbw,Doug B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a surprisingly good Mexican restaurant in Chinatown of all places. It's the type you'd pass on rue St-Laurent and not give it two thoughts but there are promising signs.. one there was a line up to get in and two the place was jammed packed as a group of 6 of us managed to snag a large shared table after a short stay at the bar drinking rhum cocktails and margaritas as we all collected together. The staff was Latin American if not fully Mexican which is also a good indication the food would be  authentic. Service was prompt and very friendly and appropriately in French/English with some Spanish added. My starter was the potato entree which i had in my head would be more along the lines of Mexican French fries but in fact was basically a bowl of mini potato's in a nice spicy sauce. One of my friends had a bean soup and said he loved it. I then had the shrimp tacos based on what other reviewers here suggested and like their conclusions I too found it delicious, quite spicy and succulent. At first I thought 3 tacos might be small but by the third I was struggling to finish up. Some of us had desserts among three choices were banana fritters and a chocolate cake both of which got high praise. Decor was basic. Simple tables in essentially a square room with a fully glass front. Nothing elaborate or overtly indicative of Mexico. Our side of the room had one long table where different people shared the setting. Good for a big group, less good for couples but because of its popularity some people had no other choice. You can eat at the bar too. Noise levels were kinda high. So to wrap up, ignore that it's a Mexican restaurant in Chinatown and just go in and try it. My meal with a $10 drink came to around $35 pre tax. The shrimp tacos were mid range. Cocktails went from $10 up most between $10 &. $12.  Pluses were the great meals and friendly service. The only slight negative was the shared table which for us worked out fine in the end but it depends who your sharing with and how awkwardly you are sitting (together, face to face with strangers etc). It's a personal choice."

/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Tacos in Chinatown? Seems rather random but hey, why not.There's a few clever details showing that La Capital Tacos is happily integrated in its multicultural neighbourhood: e.g. the melamine plates are decorated with chinese patterns, and a cute ""lucha libre"" fortune cat can be seen near the counter.We went for an early lunch and immediately liked the large wooden tables and vintage look of the restaurant. It was a sunny day, and the dining room seemed cool and shady. We ordered tacos al Pastor and Rosarito, and ""coco water"", which was kind of a pina colada without alcohol. The plates came fairly fast and looked beautiful. Three tacos might not feel like a lot, but these had generous portions of meat. The shrimps in the Rosarito were tender and flavorful, and the shredded cabbage added volume and crunch to the dish. The pork from the al Pastor turned out a bit dry, so I relied on the sauces provided on the table (which were delicious). We weren't actually full after all this, but it was a very pleasant lunch. I think it might have been better if we went with friends and tried all of their different tacos!"

That being said, I especially liked the pork and shrimp tacos. The sauces on those two were unusually rich and smooth. I also ordered a watermelon and cucumber salad, mostly out of curiosity. Surprisingly, it tasted pretty good. Very light and fresh.The service was responsive and friendly. The atmosphere was a typical city cafe, small and informal."

On this rainy day, ventured into Chinatown to get some tacos . Upon arrival, we seated pretty immediately in a table for two beside the door. It was packed so we were lucky to snag one of the last tables. The waitress recommended the shrimp tacos, I got a beer and an appetizer with watermelon, cucumbers and some seeds. Check the photo. It was small and simple to make, costs $5. The tacos took a little while to come but it was expected due to all the customers. There were three tacos, served with one lime. They put salsa and guacamole sauces the table, they are little spicy. The bill took a while to come as well, at that point we wanted to leave. There was another waitress who came with the debit machine at the next table, she was nice enough to take our payment too. Our waitress never returned after the food was finished. I would return to try other tacos and the quesadillas on the menu."

The restaurant was empty and we thought maybe they were closing the resto because every time I drive by there's always a crazy lineup. It being empty worked well for us because we got to pick wherever we wanted to sit and the services was super duper fast! I ordered the habanero margarita and my boyfriend had the Jaime el Grande. Out of the two I preferred the latter. The Jaime El Grande contains Gin Two James, Lillet, jicama, cucumber, jalapeño, lime juice, and jarrito tamarindo. It was light and refreshing. The habanero margarita was not as spicy as I would have expected but at least it was strong. The orange salt around the rim tasted like a sour mango lollipop I had in Mexico recently. It definitely made the drink better. You have the option to have the margarita with just juice and ice or put the whole thing in a blender and turn it into slushie which is what I did.  If the all-inclusive bars had these kinds of drinks in Mexico I would have enjoyed it more. The margaritas I had at the resort were no good.We started with the guacamole and frijoles refritos which is refried black beans with cheese and tortillas. I liked mixing the two. The large bowl of guacamole was really not that large. We thought they had brought us a small bowl and we asked the waitress who confirmed it really was a large bowl. It came in less than 5 min. So fast! At first I felt the guacamole had too many onions but it's just because they put tomotoes and onions on top but once you mix it its fine. I wish they had put more tomatoes though. We ordered the Rosarito taco based on the reviews here on yelp. It was very good! The tacos were also quite large and there was three on the plate. The shrimps were beer battered and lets be real anything deep fried is delicious! In the taco there was also some red cabbage, chipotle mayo, pico de gallo and avocado sauce. We also shared the Pirata (grilled beef quesadilla with cheese, coriander, served with garlic and jalapeno sauce). I'm used to eating soft quesadillas but this one was hard and crunchy, It was still good but just not what I expected. I preferred the taco.We left feeling very full and satisfied. It took awhile to get our bill because it seemed the staff members were just chilling but eventually we got up to show that we wanted to pay. On the plus side, at least they were not trying to rush us out.I would definitely come back and I definitely recommend it!"

The mushroom tacos lacked flavour but were interesting  to try. The final taco I got was a chicken taco which was a little to spicy for my taste. Get a drink try some tacos try this place out

A quick Yelp search led me to this place which I had bookmarked ages ago but hadn't got around to trying. I walked right past it despite scouring both sides of the street in search of it (convinced the address was wrong when I entered China Town in search of a mexican place?!?) Sure enough it was the one with the plain black signage with the fancy font La Capital in white, totally unassuming for a mexi joint! Place was empty-ish when I arrived at 5pm on a Wednesday evening. I was ushered away from a 4-person table in the corner and politely pointed to the few tables they accepted for just 2 people to eat at. But they were friendly throughout the process despite me finding it very strange considering it was ghost town. I was brought menus and they totally didn't mind that me n my dad just ended up having appetizers, a beer for my dad and a glass of red wine for me. The rest of the food was tantalizing but didn't want to fill up before our event. Ordered:- Small guacamole entrée: delicious and fresh,  but for someone who loves onion as much as I do...it's a tad too heavy on the onion. - Frijoles entrée: a bit of a funky taste compared to most black bean dips I've tried but a nice portion, consistency and flavour anyways.- the beer: well they didn't bring my dad a glass which he was perplexed by, but refused my offer to ask for one for him, so that's on dad! - the glass of red wine: supposedly a ""pinot-esque"" wine nourassa or sumthin like that...absolutely DISGUSTINGGGGG and served ice cold booooooo!!! I did not drink it and politely let them know it was terrible when they brought my bill. And the waiter took my bill right back and removed the glass of wine!! I found that super sweet because I wouldn't have even asked for that, I wanted to support the cute place and felt it was my bad for ordering wine in a mexi place. Won bigggg points with me on that account! Price of everything was ridiculously affordable ! Service was spectacular and friendly and they even brought us extra chips for the dips!!

They gave us a place at a table of four but we were fast moves to a counter facing the window. If it's busy like on that night, expect to share the table with other patrons. It's a nice concept but not so if you're looking for something more private and romantic.Fun cocktail menu. I chose the cocktail of the day which was a sangria. Smokey and tasty! It was good! The only bugger was that we wanted Modelo beer but they ran out so they suggested us the Corona. Here's the little problem. They're the same price (7$). Usually the Modelo is pricier.We ordered something small to snack before our JFL show. We got the large (7$) guacamole and the small (3,50$) frijoles. They both came with house baked tortillas. They came in the same sized bowl though. Hmmm. One of our tortilla bowl was bit and pieces like if they were scrapped from the bottom of the container. Then we got the mahi-mahi taco (15$) and the ""ribaye"" taco (13$). Everything was delicious! Fresh. Tangy. Great balance of flavours. Well prepared and cooked. The tortillas were moist and had a bite to them. They also put a red salsa and green salsa, both homemade, on the table. I want to buy some of the salsas. That's how good they were!The service was ok. Not bad nor good. We felt rushed and it kinda bothered me a bit. I mean i had just finished my last bite and they came right away to take it from us and half a minute later they asked if we wanted one or two bills. So, so guac and frijoles. Very good tacos.

Random place for a Mexican restaurant right in heart of China town l, seems like there are others opening up as well.  I'm always impressed the the freshness of the meat and quality of the tacos. The hot sauce (green) is amazing. It did take a while to get the food out but seeing that they are cooking on a grill and fresh I'll wait a bit. The tortillas are super soft and  loved the beaf rib eye. Home made salsa has a kick and packed with flavor. I like that it's not over dressed with sauces.. I can appreciate the the flavor of the meat. I also recommend the fish tacos.. They also have vegetarian option.. when I first went they didn't have a liquor license. Now that they do the selection is quite good. Yes they do have corona with a slice of lime! As for the decor .. if u ever been to Mexico it's not meant to be over the top .. I can't say it's eye catching at all but it's doesn't have to be. I like the common seating it brings that friendly social environment. If ur not very social that look at ur plate and partner. If you are well make new friends! I find it nice that the summer the front is completely open with sliding doors. So yes we don't live alone on this earth there will be spiders and bugs! A spider can build a complete  web in 30min...expect to see them around. I don't expect the staff to start swatting flys and bugs all night long. I personally haven't been attacked by them lol .. if you leave u windows open all day you will have uninvited guests.

/user_details?userid=rN4RItq4xONM-cjgSfbvDQ,Kendall S.,"Fort Worth, TX",4 star rating,"You gotta get Mexican food in Chinatown in Montreal, duh. This little hot spot made me soooo happy on our Canadian excursion. After many days I was really craving tacos, which we eat all the time at home. Distance makes the heart grow fonder, and I was thrilled to see La Capital pop up on Yelp when I searched for nearby lunch finds. You wouldn't expect this restaurant to be nestled amongst the many pho and ramen places or Asian food markets, but it's there and it's wonderful.It's ultra casual inside and pretty crowded at lunch time. Concrete floors, big heavy tables, and a tiny bar space (although they don't serve any alcohol as of now). They're got fresh squeezed juice on the menu, and then their speciality - authentic tacos. Chicken, fish, carnitas, steak, al pastor... the classics. We started with the chips and guacamole, which were wonderful. The chips are pretty dark and initially looked like they might be over-fried, but they tasted great. The guacamole was delicious as well, and super fresh. There are 3 different types of salsa in little plastic squeezy bottles... I believe my favorite was the green/verde, which was super-fresh, cool, and cilantro-y.We also ordered a side of refried beans which I LOVED. Amazing authentic flavor with just the right amount of cheese on top. We decided on the 3 plate al pastor tacos for our entree. Our waitress actually forgot to put in our order, and we waited for quite awhile before we realized and asked her to double check. She was super apologetic and even brought us one extra taco free of charge. I was happy because the tacos were delicious. The meat was incredibly tender and the fresh pineapple is always a beautiful accompaniment. Plus, the corn tortillas appeared to be homemade - wonderful texture and just the right thickness.Be prepared to wait for a seat right at lunchtime. Chinatown is already super busy with tourists, and this restaurant is one-of-a-kind in the neighborhood! I think it'd be worth the wait, however. One of my favorite places during our trip."

/user_details?userid=ccZ1qzr8dhNF1A3Q_duBAw,Valeria A.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,I am not a Taco person but these honestly were the best Tacos I've had and it was funny that it was in Canada and in the middle of Chinatown.Ever since coming here my boyfriend and I could not stop raving and talking about these tacos! I've told all my friends that if they ever come to Montreal this place was not to be missed.On a Sunday the group I was with wanted to go to another location but it was closed. There were so many places closed so they asked me to search on Yelp to see where we could go. I stumbled upon this place and it was open so I told them to let's take a chance and come here.I'm so glad that we did because everything was on point. The menu was limited they just have tacos and apps and drinks but everything was amazing that you won't care that they don't have anything else.I've had cochinita pibil in Mexico and loved it so anytime I see it on a menu I have to order it. I got the cochinita pibil tacos which came with three tacos and my boyfriend ordered the same. It was so amazing and flavorful so much so that even though we were both full we decided to make another order to share.It must have been really popular because the waiter told us they only had enough cochinita pibil to make two tacos so he suggested we do two cochinita pibils and one carnitas taco. We didn't care so we said sure.Turns out there had been a mixup and another table was accidentally given our second order or tacos with cochinita pibil and we got three carnitas tacos. We weren't upset and said we would still take them but the waiter must have felt bad because he gave us all shots on the house!Come here and you will not be disappointed!

I really liked their quesadillas which came in individual portions but that just means you get to sample multiple flavours! They had a great selection of tacos and other snack foods. I would skip the appetizers, they're on the small end and just get more variety of mains. I would also get a freshly squeezed coconut water if they're offering that! What a great dining experience! The only downside is that because they are located quite close to several office buildings there is a huge lunch rush between 12 - 1 and so you might be uncomfortably squeezed next to two strangers. This could be avoided with more individual tables but otherwise amazing dining experience!"

It was very packed on a Monday night and took about an hour for our food to come out. After our food finally arrived, our order was wrong, meaning it would be another 15-20 for our food to come out! At this point we cancelled our order and just wanted to pay for the one dish they got right. To top it all off they charged us for the food we didn't get and refused to give us a refund. No food is worth horrible service. They need to hire more waiters and be courteous for having folks wait an hour + for food. Everyone in the restaurant was clearly frustrated with the lack of attention. I'd give this place 0 stars if I could."

Unfortunately, it was nothing special with small portions and slightly overpriced food. We left hungry and disappointed. The  margaritas were however delicious so that was a plus. Overall, not the worst but definitely not the best spot for food.  I would highly recommend the drinks, but not the food."

If you are ordering the tacos, you get 3 per plate and depending on what you order range from $10-$14 a plate. They also have some selection of beer and cocktails if you go there at night. And surprisingly enough they have mexican coca cola! Overall giving this place 4 stars because of the price in terms of portion size."

Guacamole was nothing special but none the less excellent. You got three tacos with two types of sauce. Hint: the red sauce is the hot sauce. The bill was for over $18. So definitely not one dollar sign. Maybe not even two dollar signs $18 for two tacos in a little cup of guacamole. I'm going to put $3 signs. But excellent all around 5 stars.

We got there around noon and the place was almost full. We managed to get a table near the cashier in the back.The menu looked quite simple as there were not many choices. I've heard good comments about the tacos, but I chose to order 2 quesadillas (i'm a cheese lover): gringa & pirata.It took more than 30 minutes to get all our orders. For that kind of wait, I had high expectations for our tacos and quesadillas. You know, if it take that long to make such simple dishes, it must be something fancy or at least a big plate. But what we got blew my mind away. It was ... plain and simple...and i had something that looked like a small tortilla folded on pulled beef with nothing else... i could barely see any cheese coming out of it...The taste was good but not worth all the wait. Besides, the place is really noisy and the ventation was bad; you could see the smoke around the table and the smell sticks to your clothes. Beware if you are seated near the entrance, you better keep your coat on! I was sitting on the nack and could feel a chilly breeze.Overall, the taste of the tacos/quesadillas is good, but I will never go there again for lunch time. The service was very average. While the waiter was cleaning our table, he dropped some sauce on my coworker and seemed very lunatic. Not worth the trip."

I was told the Pastor tacos (marinated pork, onions, coriander, grilled pineapple and avocado sauce) are a big hit and it's true.  The price is $10 for 3 taco's, too be quite honest I can eat 6 of them :) Then again, I'm a big eater.  The Gringa quesadillas (marinated pork, cheese, corinader, onions and pineapple served with avocado sauce) $5 are a hit my little girl.  I do recommend this place if you want authentic Mexican food and that doesn't break the bank.

At first, I thought that I would still be hungry after that, since we were 2, but I was unexpectedly full, and was struggling to finish everything. La Capital Tacos is a great cheap option for tacos in Montreal, but please, don`t do the mistake of going there for lunch (between 11:30am and 1:30pm).

Certainly the first time I see a Mexican-Chinese fusion, and dare I say, it's not a bad marriage! That said, the tacos are no fusion byproduct: they are probably the best in the city and rival those in others in terms of taste and authenticity! Vegetarians, fear not! The El Pastor can be made vegetarian with tempeh substitution, and there is also a mushrooms taco. Our table of 4 ordered the El Pastor, Carnitas, Rosaritos and the vegetarian El Pastor. We each thought ours was so good that we didn't want to share! (Of course we relented, sharing is caring).Service is friendly.

I have string craving for Al Pastor tacos (spicy pork, pineapple) and after looking at the menu real quick to realize they served them, we walked right in. Most Mexican places serve chips and salsa, but La Capital didn't seem to as we had to order quad and chips instead. The food came out relatively quickly. The tacos tasted really good, even though I have had better. For a price of $10 CAD, you get three tacos, which is a pretty good deal, but again I have seen better. What made me sad was that there was only one tiny pineapple on each taco. The pineapple is what makes these tacos so good, but it is hard to get that taste when you only get a tiny one for each taco. Also the chips we got came in a really tiny cup, that didn't hold many chips. But, I think these were rated the best tacos in Montreal and I would definitely recommend!"

Good: the server greeted us and was seated right away. It's a charming little spot with exposed brick walls and a warm ambiance. We asked for recommendations since it was our first time checking it out, and we ended up going with the battered shrimps tacos. Hands down, the best tacos I've ever had. Filling, well portions and reasonably priced. It reminds me of the food I've had in LA. You know the food is good when it brings back good memories.Bad: no negative comments. Maybe the hot sauce wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be, but that's not even significant in comparison to how much I've enjoyed the meal.Bottom line: I've mentally made plans for who I intend to bring to this establishment.

So we go ahead and order other items to curb our now famished selves. She comes back 10 mins later saying said items aren't available either. Our patience being tested, we order again another item. She comes back 5 mins later saying it isn't available. I really thought i was being pranked. We basically ordered 3-4 times and waited about an hour for anything to arrive at our table.The food failed to impress. Big time. It was cold and bland. I only liked the beans.The only reason i didn't walk out is because i was famished and really craving Mexican. Being in chinatown i didn't wanna trek to the plateau. To top it all... our waitress ends her shift and leaves nonchalantly without saying a word to us. I was F L O O R E D. We were left without a waitress and had to get up and chase down a bus boy for our bill. I hope the owners read this. Service is everything guys!! Hire proper wait staff, train them.

I proceeded to order from said menu and got myself a drink from their daily special drink. It tasted like heavily diluted juice, basically water with a touch of flavor and coloring. Who cares, I thought to myself, at least I can enjoy the water. The surprise came when I had to pay the bill. Apparently the soup and drink together were a good 4-5$ extra and not included with the lunch deal. Way to scam your customers when you've just opened the business.At least the soup was decent."

/user_details?userid=1KNKXNYj7TDnT19hKElejQ,Geoffrey D.,"Hillsboro, OR",5 star rating,"La Capital deserves five stars for the food and six stars for the service. I'll start with the food:I started with the carrot and coconut milk soup (to my understanding it is their Thursday soup), which was some of the best carrot soup I've eaten anywhere.I also had their special, which was a shredded pork taco trio. The flavor of the meat rivaled some tacos I've had in The Mission in San Francisco (a place known for great Mexican food). If you like spice, I also recommend asking for the 7-pepper sauce. They make it in-house and it was a great, moderately spicy complement to the pork. They have 3 cocktails, a Paloma, a Margarita with homemade habanero syrup, and a Mezcal Old Fashioned. The old fashioned was not mind-blowing, but a very good drink that I would order again.Finally the flan for dessert was a great little treat to end an already good meal.Now I would also like to commend the waitress, Sandrine, for the best service I've ever received in Montreal. She took the time to describe every drink and sauce in detail, and consistently made sure that everything was to my liking. She also talked to me about the history of the restaurant, how it came to be in Chinatown, and a little bit about each of the owners. It's the little things that can make or break the experience, and Sandrine ensured that I'll be coming back to La Capital again, and next time I'll bring friends."

Staff is great, both the host and our waitress were perfect, attentive, and really friendly. The food: we had the mushroom quesadilla,  the beer battered shrimp tacos, the tempeh tacos. Tempeh was deliciously marinated (seriously, tasted like chicken), the mushrooms as well were spot on, even if a bit heavy. We also started with the best refried black beans I have ever had (we all agree) and the most delicious roasted beet salad that, as a cook, surprised me. I will have to try that. Sweet but also smokey. Drinks were good, menu was small but tasty.

Starting a taco joint may seem easy, but it takes attention to detail to really perfect the taco. La Capital - in the middle of Montreal and, funnily enough, Chinatown - has chosen to pay attention to detail and is rewarded with some marvelous little tacos. The al pastor is TRUE al pastor, meaning it's cooked on a spit. As a Texan who lives in a jungle of mexican restaurants, finding one that cooks al pastor the true way is surprisingly difficult. It says a lot to put al pastor on your menu and then not cheat!!The salsas were tasty, the juice of the day is very authentic to mexican cuisine, and the space is small but refined in that taco joint kind of way.

/user_details?userid=s6nIyADt_Xea5aPOG4Q7aA,Jaime S.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Nice place, small but tasty menu. I had the cheese chicharron and the cochinita pibil taco. The food was tasty, and it reminded me of some great old places in California - the real taquerias - well outside of Mexico. Since the restaurant is in Chinatown, it was amusing to see the China was Chinese. Service was somewhat slow and our appetizers came late while our main meal came a minute later, having barely had a taste of our starters. I hate it when the kitchen doesn't even try to space things apart. Nonetheless, the food was excellent and tasted pretty authentic so it's still well worth a visit if you're craving for Mexican in Montreal"

/user_details?userid=Ge4vGDAepn2Vm_RntV_mVw,Anne G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"What a gem!My friend suggested this restaurant and I admit that at first I was skeptical. Since living in California I generally avoid Mexican food anywhere else as it is likely to disappoint. Not this time!!A cosy and very busy reataurant in Chinatown that serves some amazing tacos! I tried the Shrimp tacos my friend had the steak tacos and husband had tempe tacos. All arrived really fast and were absolutely delicious. Service is perfect as well, incredibly friendly servers.Oh and did I mention the bottomless guacamole and chips? So much yum!"
/user_details?userid=moenrsOQO5cOa8bmlrvnsw,Naïka E.,"Charlemagne, Canada",5 star rating,"Authentic mexican cuisine at its finest! Before getting there I was scared it was gonna be another fast ""mexican"" restaurant like lots of them out there, but the overall was unexpected. The guacamole was smooth and crunchy with some peppers and onions and the chips coming with it wasnt some cliché tostitos, but real thick corn flour tortillas. The tacos I ordered were the ""Ribaye"" if im correct, a big piece of beef on each tacos topped with fresh coriander and grilled onions along with a lightly spicy/lemony sauce. Usually, im disatisfied in retaurants when I order a beef dish, because I get so little of a meat for what im paying, but this dish had the perfect amount of beef on every tacos for only 13$! There's not enough spaces tho, so coming in a big group might not be a great idea :/ They had a great variety of drinks that seemed really nice but I didnt get any this day. I highly recommend this place if you have a taco craving! (haha)"
/user_details?userid=vpldxbdbHIWdtm3CU49bsA,Joe A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Fast and friendly service despite being fairly busy. I had the pepper and mushroom taco and it was delicious. My friend ordered the tempeh taco and it was a little dry and less flavorful. The salsas on the table helped enhance the flavors a lot! Another friend ordered the shrimp tacos. They were deep fried and she seemed to enjoy them! Another friend ordered some kind of beef taco but asked to not have coriander so it was probably lacking a lot. We shared chips with beans and guacamole to start and it was very enjoyable! A great little taco place sitting oddly in Chinatown​!

We waited because we really wanted to try it!Tried to go for a second time (saturday) and a third time (sunday) but got denied. Waiter's words were "" we are under staffed so we are deying new clients right now "". And so, you got to take a risk if you want to go, not knowing if you'll be able to get in or not.Luckily for us, there are plenty more taco places in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=5ca2MkCJFAMafDrRxLMlXQ,Ash L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Hands down ""the best tacos in Chinatown :p "". But best tacos for Montreal? I don't think so. It's not lacking of good tacos here as I think the menu is very balanced and the environment is cute & creative. However, I've had one memorable taco dish each from Escondite, la temarala (mile-end) and even cartel during its $2 taco night."
/user_details?userid=_dK7T8zGVfWGpWZeX0WKVg,My Honest Review K.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"I dunno what happened to the service and food here.... The first time I came here with my friend, the tacos were delicious and service was very efficient and friendly. So I was very excited to come back again the second time. I was alone this time and was able to get a table right before the rush. I ordered the pastor tacos which i remembered ordering the first time which was amazing but this time it was very dry and over-cooked (certain pieces were burnt)..the taste was nothing great and very disappointing...the service was not good either..the young girl who was wearing all black served me the tacos without any word..very unpleasant..not even a smile..and she took the hot sauces from the next table which a young couple was still finishing to my table without asking them which i thought was very rude...and frankly awkard. Hopefully this was a rare ocassion and im willing to go back once again to be fair and decide then whether i would recommend it to others. I just remember the server from the first time being so great and attentive..that its unfortunate that it takes one negative server from this experience and inconsistency of the food to feel so differently about an establishment."

Dining setup is a bit strange.. they have all kinds of sized tables and they're very popular so be ready to share your table. On a rainy Monday night, there were people rolling in continuously between 8 and 10pm! ...with reason because the tacos are great. I wasn't impressed by the service (they seem to be understaffed for the amount of people) and I didn't really like my cocktail. My boyfriend also tried the beets entrée which wasn't worth it. Stick to the tacos and you'll be satisfied! I also like the chinese touch of having the food served on 'oriental' plates."

The tacos were great, we ordered the steak one and the shrimp. The shrimp one was by far the best, very fresh and unique flavor. Good portions, three tacos per plate. We also had the beans with chips, which were also pretty good. Definitely recommend!"

We walked in for lunch on our way to explore Chinatown and downtown Montreal and we're very impressed with the authenticity of the food and the service. We tried the guacamole, chips, tacos al pastor, and carnitas tacos. All were superb and honestly was one of the best meals we've had in Montreal thus far. I would just suggest more grilled pineapple on the pastor tacos....mostly because I love grilled pineapple. :)"

/user_details?userid=weK0TNVmohcLsCfJTzgZGg,Pauline R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Considering there aren't many options for tacos in Montreal I would say La Capitale is definitely a good one. Central, reasonably priced, well prepared food and with a good vibe! Everything you need to be happy. From the Guacamole, to the refried beans, to the beef, shrimp & pork tacos, I wasn't disappointed. Check out my full review here for more details delifeed.ca/2016/03/03/l…"

Staff was very friendly and attentive. Margarita was served frozen with some inventive lime zest, but lacked in flavor and punch. I could barely taste the tequila, which I needed after a long week.Take out tacos came fast. 1) they got my order wrong, as in skipped the shrimp tacos I'd been eager to try. 2) however the pulled pork tacos were phenomenal! Much better than the traditional pastor I was mistakenly given. STELLAR salsa Verde. I hope it was just an off night, because the place had a great vibe. Will try again."
