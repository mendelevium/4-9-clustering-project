They have a great selection of beers and cocktails. My friend and I ordered some beers which were unfortunately not in stock. The owner offered us some shots to apologize for the inconvenience. I really appreciate those small efforts by restaurant owners to make the experience as enjoyable as possible.We ordered three meals to share (tapas style): vegan tacos, kimchi potato wedges and gnocchis.All the dishes were excellent and very well prepared. They do a very good job at mixing sweet and salty flavours.The ambiance is quaint and cosy and is ideal for a tête-à-tête or for a family dinner. They have larger tables able to accommodate groups. The waiters and owners are very approchable and attentive to details.Highly recommended. 5 stars!"

I was especially delighted to pass by yesterday and see an exclusively vegan spot open in St Henri; it's literally the only one of its kind around. The experience, however, I have to admit was just not bad.The decor and design of the restaurant is tasteful although nothing out of the ordinary: vegan chique meets primary colours meets nighttime. The concept very much echoes that of its Monkland location. I'm definitely not complaining but my socks aren't knocked off either.Food-wise it was variable: we ordered a watermelon ceviche, the roasted artichokes and the green curry. The roasted artichokes were by far the highlight of the meal: the perfectly seasoned artichokes with sliced mandarins were perfect, albeit I could have probably used about 1000 more of them. I found the ceviche and curry pretty average: the ceviche took a standard cubed-everything approach (I feel like vegan ceviches need some variety on the chop to give crunch and to play the flavours a bit differently); the green curry was tasty but way too heavy-handed on the sauce- with the texture it made the dish very swamp-like.Finally, the wine (it is, after all, a wine bar): we ordered a couple glasses of their more affordable orange wine. Clearly there's been some stellar thinking going into the wine selection- that was a hella tasty natural wine. That being said, it was also hella pricey: there isn't a glass under $12 on their wine list. I would make the suggestion that these guys take lessons from the natural wine bar down the street that closed a few months ago (Chez Lavigne)- diversify your price range on your wines to make sure you keep the regulars; too many restaurants are going under in this neighbourhood."

The restaurant is massive and very beautiful with simplistic decor. The service was long but no fault to the staff at all. The waitress was wearing lots of hats today. She was the host, the waitress, the barmaid, the barista... thankfully she wasn't the cook, because she was all by herself in the front. By the time, we got in , the place started to get packed. All the tables were well set with safe distance between them for the customers.  We started with our drinks, and I had a latte with the base of oat milk. It was creamy and smooth plus delicious. For brunch, I had Benny Benny platter which consist of ricotta tofu, parsleys, avocado, tomato, hollandaise sauce , coconut, scallion, mayonnaise, coconut, scallions with bun, and on the  side salad and roasted potatoes. When the plate was place in front of me, I was surprised how huge was dish. I enjoyed every single item except the bun, which was was dry. It was a good experience and I hope the business booms. Support your local business!"

I highly suggest to try the Brussel sprouts (I used to hate it but now I'm completely in love)
/user_details?userid=C2YxxeHBKtJ5Eokpi2urcQ,Anna N.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Absolutely amazing. Every plate was divine!Don't skip on the brussel sprouts, the kimchi potatoes, and the tacos. I'm not a sweet tooth but the date square was absolutely amazing. I'm still dreaming about it. I'd recommend sticking to the tapas style plates rather than the large dishes. I was worried small vegan plates wouldn't keep me full, but they definitely will. The price was completely reasonable, it only racked up because of the alcohol - like every where else. Will definitely go again! Tip: this is better with minimum 3 people"
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",3 star rating,"We made a group reservation here for lunch and were all super excited to give this place a try ! We were a little worried as a friend of ours previously made a lunch reservation here that was confirmed only to show up and the restaurant wasn't open. However in our case there was no issue with our reservation. the decor is airy and pretty inside, very nice look and feel. Our waitress was very nice. We were a group of 15 and were the only ones in the restaurant aside from a group of 4. Our orders all came out at very different times with some people waiting so long for their food that everyone else was done eating and they had to take it to go. They appeared to be short staffed in the kitchen that day , the waitress was super apologetic and did offer compensation for the inconvenience which was nice. I had their pressed aloha juice which was delicious and refreshing. I had the hello burger as a few of us did , but we weren't told that it doesn't come with any sauce inside except for a very small dollop of mustard so we had to ask for all sauces on the side. The burger was okay , filling and decent flavour but nothing overly impressive, the potatoes were good. The people who ordered from the brunch options seemed more way more impressed with their food than those who ordered from the lunch menu, so I would be curious to come back for brunch. everything Tasted fresh and the location was clean. I think they are very new and still trying to work out some of the kinks , I would like to come back in a Month or two to give an updated review when they are more setup and on their feet."
