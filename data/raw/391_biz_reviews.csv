We go there for the rice balls, which are wrapped in a clever packaging that prevents the seaweed from getting soggy form the rice. The seaweed stays crispy, and also prevent your fingers from getting dirty from handling the food. There's a nice selection of flavors, including tuna, kimchi, spicy or non spicy, tofu, etc. It's not too expensive and quite filling! The black rice in the rice ball, which give it a beautiful purple color. A nice treat on the way to or off work."

Located right in the middle of McGill station.I wouldn't recommend to take the Poke bowl though. They are not very generous in salmon and it is already mixed with a mayo base sauce. I personally prefer soya sauce. Two onigiris for $6 and they have good variety to choose from.
