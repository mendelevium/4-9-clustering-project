/user_details?userid=yIFyaNq4oCLoYkY1Gi0XAw,Corey D.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,"I know I'm a little late to check out this new concept food court in Montreal and I'm sorry I took this long to come. Of the 4 new ""higher end"" food courts in the downtown core this is my favourite. Great variety of restaurants and prices on the lower end of high end. We found places to sit very quickly which is nice. Nothing kills the mood more than walking around for 15 minutes with your tray looking for a place to sit. I'll be back for sure!"
/user_details?userid=jrEiNGTP_s7i8XSGCek8Hw,Helene C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I really like the urban decor with the bright posters on the walls. The ambiance is casual with music playing in the background. The food stands are randomly dispersed through the space, which makes it fun to walk through. Since the dessert stands are near the entrance, perhaps grab them first, then go get a seat or order a meal next. And there's a bar downstairs.After ordering the meal, they will call the number on the receipt. I made the mistake to sit at the table and not hearing their call. Next time, I'll probably wait next to the food stand.This food hall is a great way for customers to discover new eateries. After having a delicious meal at Kamé, I would love to visit their other location in the future. Some of the things I am grateful for:There are hangers for coats. There are staff helping with the dishes and trays after the meal.The toilets have the Dyson Airblade tap with build-in hand dryer! I enjoyed my experience at Le Central and would definitely be back for more."
/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"So Le Central is one of those Food Halls that are becoming oh so popular. This place does it right though and is so much better than the Time Out Market in the (Montreal) Eaton Centre, IMO. The space is big and all storefronts of the independent vendors have their own unique style, so it looks very eclectic. It reminds me a lot of Assembly Chef's Hall in Toronto. Meanwhile, Time Out Market looks very corporate, since all the storefronts look the same with the name written in the same font. Oh and I find the prices at Le Central much more reasonable than Time Out. Also at Le Central you can buy drinks from any vendor and many vendors even have a water dispenser with free water. At Time Out you can only buy drinks from the Soda Bar and I don't believe there is any free water. My husband and I had lunch at Le Central. He got the ""Guédille de homard"" (Lobster Roll) at Gaspesie Bistro Gourmand ($16). It came with fries. I got the 4 pieces fried chicken at Ho Lee Chix ($7) and a slice of Margherita pizza at Morso ($3).I had a bite of my husband's lobster roll and a few fries and they were quite tasty. It is something that I would consider ordering for myself. The fried chicken was absolutely delicious and I actually received 5 pieces instead of 4, whoo hoo! I love bonus chicken, lol. They were piping hot, so crispy on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside. The meat was boneless and lean with no gristlely bits. Thumbs up! I got to chose 2 dipping sauces and I went with General Tao and Peanut Butter and Jelly. Both were good, but the PB&J was certainly unique. It was like a peanut sauce with a fruity and sweet element to it. I liked the creativity. Staff were very friendly. The Margherita pizza at Morso was also great. I usually like thin crust, but the crust here is thicker, as it's Sicilian style pizza, but I still enjoyed it. It was basic tomato sauce with fresh cheese but very tasty. This vendor only takes cards and no cash. Most of the seating at Le Central is communal, but they have some smaller tables as well. I am looking forward to going back and trying out some other vendors. I love the mix of cuisines. They had Mexican, Italian, Indian, Portuguese, Thai, French-Canadian, Japanese, American, Fusion, and so many others. They had desserts like gelato, Churros and donuts too. I want to eat my way through it all ;)"
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"I love that Montreal went from 0 of these food hall concepts to 3 within a year (Time Out Market, Le Central, and the one that will be opening in PVM next month). Le Central got less hype than Time Out, so I was pleasantly surprised when I went to check it out on a Saturday evening. It is located near Place des Arts and M Telus so a key area that has been ignored in the past.The first time I went, I tried BabKesh, a Moroccan restaurant with a cute stall concept. Sharing is caring so I also tried Misoya for ramen (amazing) and Mignon for churros (drool). Bab Kesh was unique - I had never tried a Moroccan sandwich before, made with homemade bread (kind of between a bao bun and a pita bread) and braised beef. The harissa spicy sauce made it for me and I wish I had asked for extra of that sauce. The garnish salad was very bland in flavour so a stronger dressing or a garlic yoghurt-style sauce would've really made it more delicious for me. The owner was very nice, great service.Misoya blew my mind with their vegetarian ramen. They use shiitake mushrooms and miso to make an unbelievably tasty broth. Definitely worth a try.Mignon killed it with their churros. So fresh, smelled like heaven and the dulce de leche dipping sauce was excellent.During my second visit, I tried Ho Lee Chix and Bogado for unique flavoured ice cream. Ho Lee Chix has some tasty sauces and good chicken, but the miss for me is that they don't allow you to choose between white and dark meat... it's all dark meat. They also say it's boneless chicken but for me if there's remaining cartilage, it's not a pleasant eating experience. So for the fussy chicken eater, nay. Otherwise, you're going to love it.Got the vegetarian ramen from Misoya again... it's just that good. and finished my experience with a small ice cream from Bogado after sampling like 5-10 ice cream flavours! The raspberry red pepper and mango sorbets are delicious.I like the vibe at this food court, more laid back than Time Out. After I think it's 5pm, they darken the lights and pretty much every restaurant has a small line up. There are large communal tables in the main area or smaller tables out of the way in the back near the windows. Love the concept and will be back!"
/user_details?userid=IMHvG_ysz6akYIM-GO18kg,Andrea D.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Had to try it because similar concept places are popping up everywhere! If you're not familiar, it's basically an upscale food court with bar, and you can order dishes from many gourmet restaurants at once. We shared (and forgive me for not remembering the names of the places... but you will find them there is one of each style of food pretty much) :Salmon pizza -crisp crust, fresh smoked salmon and a creamy sauce. Reminded me of the salmon blinis brunch at Lemeac... 5/5 Marguerite pizza - crisp crust, generous toppings with different types of cheese. You can tell this is gourmet 5/5 Fish taco of the day was cod - carefully balanced with avocado and pickled onions. 5/5 it was INSANE ! Pollo pibil taco- again I was so impressed 5/5Deep fried chicken and curry noodles From holy chix (or something like that )- so good. We had the peanut sauce and the spicy mayo sauce. Chicken was crunchy yet juicy. Noodles were nice complement. 5/5Now you're probably thinking I'm one of those 5-star raters all the time. Nope, this place deserves the 5 star rating... food is great, ambiance is casual chic but very relaxed, and bonus :  all of the above cost us less than $15 each...Time out you're next..."
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Very well known Montreal restaurants are under the safe roof at Le Central. So far, I enjoyed my favorite Le Super Qualité kiosk, also I tried Bonita's Taco and Deli, Trou de Beigne and West Sheffield. Beside Trou de Beigne; I loved the food and drinks from each of the food kiosk. I cannot wait to try others. The place itself is beautiful and fun. The services at each kiosk is excellent. There are some days, you get witness live music. Last time, I was having a lot of joy to be the audience to a jazz group who were amazingly talented. Definitely, a great food court if you compare to Time Out Market or Le Cathcart. Can't wait for the next visit."
/user_details?userid=bUPeHBFEINhqiKj9-k4-zA,Charles N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"According to research, Food Halls are no passing fancy... in fact predictions say that the number of food halls are expected to triple from 2015 to 2020. The concept has ancient roots dating back to the second century with Trajan's Market, then Istanbul's Grand Bazaar market in 1461, London's Harrods in 1834, Boston's Quincy market in 1825, Seattle's Pike's Place in 1907 and the modern concept with the opening of Eataly outside of Torino in Italy in 2007.Case and point, Le Central, one of three major food halls in Montreal has opened (soft opening). Located at the counter of two historic arteries in Montreal, Ste Catherine and St Laurent, Le Central looks promising with its 25 restaurants, each with their own space, housed in a gargantuesque 22,000 square foot hall, capable of accommodating up to 900 people... also a sure hit being right next to Place Des Arts and two steps from music venues such a as MTelus (formerly Metropolis).So what are these restaurants?- Bab Kesh: Moroccan restaurant- Bagado: Ice cream, sorbets and chocolates- Bonita's: Tacos from the same owners as La Capital in Chinatown- Buddha-Station: Quebec City-based poke bowl and sushi- Camion Gaspésie: Maritime-focused food truck- Emilia: Portuguese grill and sandwich spot- Falafel Avenue: Modern takes on classic deep-fried chickpea patties- Heirloom: Neapolitan pizzeria- Kamehameha: Poke, Spam Burger and other Hawaiian snacks, and cocktails!- Le Gras Dur: Schnitzel, Burger, Poutine...- Ho Lee Chix: Chinese-leaning fried chicken from the owners of Le Red Tiger- Mignon: Churros, and artisanal Nougat or Candies- Mignonette: Tartare bar- Chez Milo et Fine: former Breton-style crepe shop- Misoya: Bishop Street ramen- Morso: Roman-style pizza- Pintxo: Spanish restaurant- Ragu: Italian stand- La République Démocratique du Jambon: charcuterie experts from Sherbrooke- Le Super Qualité: Petite-Patrie south Indian snack bar- The Standard: coffee shop- Thip Thip: Laotian restaurant also from Le Red Tiger's owner- Trou de Beigne: Little Italy doughnut shop- West Shefford: Craft brewery- Yannick Fromagerie: St-Jérôme cheesemongersIn one sitting, we had the opportunity to try out noodles at Thip Thip, fried chicken at Ho Lee Chix, Ice cream at Bagado and Churros at Mignon... and yes we will be back to sample some more as more of these establishments open... Hope to bump into you!"
/user_details?userid=za-_E0w58gRS2_9mHicmkQ,Li S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great place for lunch downtown. Amazing selection with passionate restaurant owners. The quality of the food is great. The choices range from ramen, crepes to pintxos. There is also a bring your own food on the bar section. The ambiance and decor is modern and inviting as well as fun. It'll make you want to chill there for hours. The only thing would be price. Ramen soup with tip was 18$. Not the most affordable lunches but it's great if you're going to treat yourself once and a while. Still the quality is great and everything so far I've tried is delicious. Will be going back to try more places!!!"
/user_details?userid=XEqApY2jtSPdGptPsJHumg,Lucy F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love this place! So much quality variety. My favorite counters:Morso: Roman style pizza. Their dough and textures are spot on.La super qualité: Their potato burger alone is worth the detour.Ho Lee Chix: Very good fried chicken with delicious asian sides.Bab Kech: Setting is beautiful. Food is surprising and delicious. By far, Le Central dominates the new fancy cafeteria trend in Montreal. There is a lot of seating, the prices are affordable and the quality and variety of the food is unparalleled... from poutine to tartares, from pizza to ramen, there is something yummy for all tastes!"
/user_details?userid=AFNpn4nZzSkPB5-J-PbnIA,Lily S.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"My friends and I stumbled upon this place while wondering around the city. On a Sunday afternoon it had a ton of seating and a great variety of food choices. We got a charcuterie board from RDJ and it was such a great way to take a break from the city and just enjoy a delicious board of cured meat. The ambience is rather relaxing, there is soft music playing and the lighting is rather dark. Each stall has such cute and unique design that it was fun to walk around and explore the place. Would recommend this place if you are exploring the city of Montreal and need a quick refreshment break. :)"
/user_details?userid=tnkBQzsRTt3gXvXqG2eURg,John R K.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A welcome addition to the neighbourhood! It's like a collection of food trucks. Plenty of variety and it looks like more to come. Seating is mostly communal. Music is the cheesy kind but not too loud. We found prices to be a little high.My only complaints? A handful of the kiosks had menus that were hard to see. One place (Emilia's) didn't have a bilingual menu so I had no idea what they were selling (a bad business decision in a tourist-heavy area). There are also confusing rules about alcohol...one place wouldn't sell us beer because we didn't order food from it...but later we saw a man carrying a wine bottle and 2 glasses to his table.This place is new so it still has to work out a few wrinkles, but overall it's a great spot to go with friends because everyone can get the kind of food they want."
