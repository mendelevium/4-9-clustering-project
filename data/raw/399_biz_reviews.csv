It's rare that I give 5 stars but after I explain you'll understand. I was in Montreal visiting from Vermont and I got together with a friend that I haven't seen in awhile, we were suppose to go out for drinks at Henrietta's. Once we arrived there it was 3:30 in the afternoon and it wasn't opened yet and we wanted a glass of wine. I told her I know another place close by let's check it out and it was Veuve Chalet and it was closed. There was a guy outside and he over heard us talking and offered to open the restaurant and that he would serve us a drink.  We had a wonderful window seat, with a few glasses of nicely chilled Chardonnay followed with fresh oysters on ice. The service was impeccable, our waiter was amazing, friendly and he had a great personality to top it off. The music was an extra bonus. This is my second time coming here and I will be returning on my next trip to Montreal. I recommend this restaurant! They also have a charming terrace in the back. We had a fabulous day! Thank you Veuve Chalet!!! Sincerely, Nicole"
/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"After hearing so many great things about this resto, I finally decided to try it out with our foodie group and must say we enjoyed the experience. Let's begin with the ambiance - very classy and chic!  Loved the indoor decor!  Take note that they have booths which comfortably sit a max of 6 people and no tables per say. Thus, I wouldn't recommend for groups bigger than 6.  The ambiance is very intimant and romantic so perfect for dates or night out with close friends! Onto the food now. The food was really good but some dishes are a little on the pricey side. However, if you are an oyster lover, then this is a must go to place as the oysters are 1$ each!!  Yes that's right and they were fresh and delicious!!! All the dishes we ordered were delicious including their home made baguette bread!  We tried the salmon tartare, baked brie, burgers and fries and all were delicious.  We went on a recent beautiful summer evening and sat on their gorgeous back terrase and loved it!  Of course no meal is complete without dessert!  The waiter actually comes out with a tray of desserts - this is their menu which is nice so you can actually see what each dessert looks like! All were yummy!  I also recomnend their Sangria! Service was friendly and quick!  We had a great time and would go back!"

She wanted to take me out for my birthday so we went to M.Mme for Oystermania and we walked in front of the restaurant. There was a sign in front that said $1 oysters. So after M.Mme we went straight there!!Now let me tell you, their oysters were so much better than M.Mme!!! I would totally go back for their oysters! I believe that they have this oyster special every night!!! Those oysters were big and meaty! So good! And for $1 each, that's a steal!!We got a dozen oysters each and then shared a side of fries. The fries were just ok. I felt that some were a bit undercooked to be honest. I would totally come back for their oysters and try their other dishes though. We had a couple of glasses of cava. They really fill up the glasses ! And we had a glass of white wine each. Their cocktails are on the pricy side. I think they were $16 each but they do have a ladies night special on Thursdays where the cocktails are $10 each. I really enjoyed the music too. They played old school hip hop!They have a terrace in the back that would be perfect for summer! Too bad it was too cold to go out and enjoy it. I highly recommend!"
/user_details?userid=iZO6FkqgNcncfdpA1nEoaw,Carmen H.,"Stratford, CT",5 star rating,"One of the hidden gems of Montréal!! We were on the hunt for oysters. After being turned away from a couple restaurants/bars around 11pm on a thursday, THIS place was the only one that was very hospitable. We arrived around 11:10pm. They said they closed at 11pm, but they were willing to ask the kitchen if it was okay to do a last order of only a dozen oysters. We didn't realize that Quebec has a law that states once the kitchen closes, they cannot serve alcohol anymore. So alcohol must be served with food! *Call ahead to check if the kitchen is open if planning to go after 10:30PM.*They played throwback hip hop! Love it!Oysters were of New Brunswick.The signature cocktails are personally designed by the bartender and I would say one of the best versions I've ever tasted.Tropical Fever- (the bartender's personal rendition of a piña colada Moscow Mule - using his own sweet and sour mix and the brand ""Spicy Jamaican"" for the ginger beerDefinitely coming back during my next visit to Montréal!"

The "" tomahawk "" was worst than on the last visit. Again WAY OVERCOOKED, no taste and it took forever to get our order: even the waitress felt bad and kept staying at our table saying that it was not her fault..."

/user_details?userid=D9xOUfb5xxaLsGHb91rQ4A,Emilie C.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,What I liked to most about this place was the staff! They were all super friendly and offered a great service. They also have the best deal on oysters you can find (1$ every night!!) and they have good food/cocktails. Absolutely worth trying. I will definitely go back!

I come back here all the time as they've never disappointed. My faves to get is the oysters, tartars, & melted brie!"
/user_details?userid=Yj3qvVUufD9RTUahqJiN9g,Tarry N.,"Kirkland, Canada",5 star rating,Great food ....and the drinks are even better!!! The signature cocktails  are impressive to say the least. The hardest thing to do is only have 1 type of oyster.great place to go with a group...lots of booths!! The buckets of beer were also a delight to see.
/user_details?userid=bj2_KPCKpQdNlN8hlHSxdg,Cat D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"First time there and it lived up to expectations. Interior is super nice and inviting, and I spied a very cute looking terrace out back. Our server was attentive and gave good suggestions. They have $1 oysters here every evening/night (not sure what time the deal starts). Other items sampled were the salmon tartare (very fresh, clean taste), the mushroom truffle pasta (decadent as one can assume from its name) and the calamari (very good, nice big pieces, not chewy and good crisp). Besides a wine list, they have a pretty expansive cocktail selection. I stuck with the Lorenzo Hechter (tequila, cointreau and some other ingredients I forgot). The drinks are nice and strong, but definitely on the pricey side. They don't display the cocktail prices on the menu, expect a note that at certain times, cocktails are $9.99 (maybe Happy Hour?). My drink was $16 with tax. Ladies night (Thursday), all cocktails are $10. While there, we saw a tray of desserts passing by and they sure are beautiful! The only slight annoyance was the fluctuation of the volume from the sound system -one minute just right, the next super loud. Not many people were there for a Friday night, but the ones that were there, were definitely living it up dancing in their booths and one person even got on top of her bench at one point :) I'll definitely be back, but most likely on Ladies Night to soften the sting of those otherwise $16 cocktails!"
