/user_details?userid=NilrQC1Lq7t2O1u_54sINQ,Audrey L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I LOVE Aunt Dai for good, authentic Chinese. But first, I HIGHLY recommend taking a look at their online menu (just google ""Aunt Dai menu"" - you'll be glad you did, it's an incredibly entertaining read.Have been ordering from here more during lockdowns, as Chinese food is one of those cuisines that is just fine eaten a little later, or reheated. I'm a huge fan of two dishes in particular: 1. The Grilled beef slices (tiě bn niú li ), and2. the Braised pork belly with sweet potato noodles (Hóng Shāo Ròu Dùn Fěn Tiáo).I find that each dish ordered will either serve 2-3 if served with a side of rice or noodles.We had one issue ordering from them recently, as they had given our order away to the wrong person, so it took much longer to get our food. But they rectified the issue and we will certainly be back again for more."
/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I have been ordering from the restaurant quite often now and I'm more than satisfied with their meals. It is similar to your typical Chinese restaurant but with less breading and more meat, less grease and oil and much more flavour. I would recommend the general tao chicken, beef and broccoli, beef and spicy peppers and the Cantonese noodles with mixed vegetables. All their dishes are reasonably priced and arrive super hot (ordered through Uber eats). The food tastes really fresh and authentic (for those dishes that are actually authentic, check their online website for info!). Overall, I am very satisfied with their flavours and can' wait to order from them again!-if you plan on ordering take out/delivery, don't worry at all. The food arrived incredibly hot and all the flavour is definitely still there! Can't wait to order again!"
/user_details?userid=CUnPcNRfqs040C_9-0-a_g,Bhavyaa C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I visited this restaurant for the first time earlier this year (before quarantine began) and I was incredibly happy with the food! It is incredibly aromatic, fresh, and perfectly-seasoned. My friend brought me here assuring me that they were authentically made and tasty renditions of dishes she ate while growing up. The service was awesome and very attentive although we were some of the only customers (on a weekday early evening). The food is incredibly priced for the portion size and the amount of meat: we ordered the sweet and spicy eggplant and the braised porkbelly with sweet potato noodles and were thoroughly stuffed by the time we finished eating.Since quarantine began I've been ordering their food through delivery as well as takeout (pickup). Both times the food has been very fresh and warm, and the portion size was huge as usual! They are very well organized during pickup: if you call in advance and give them a pickup time they will ensure your food is ready, and they carefully sanitize the card reader for each customer. Additionally, I believe they offer loyalty points during this time for rewards once dine-in begins again.Some other dishes I have tried were the cumin beef and the eggplant, potato, & bell pepper dish. I loved them both as well and I highly recommend them! Definitely consider supporting this local restaurant, you will not be disappointed!"
/user_details?userid=MOOBu3osXdaNQjNN8UYusw,Chan N.,"Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Yesterday, I decided to order the cumin beef through the phone. It took less than 2 minutes to place my order.When I got there, I saw there's a bookshelf for you to donate or take books! Amazing.And the owner is such a sweetheart. I asked for a cup of water, and he didn't have any. He offered a free Coke or Ginger Ale instead, but I declined.After I got home, I savored that cumin beef. It was spicy enough for my spice levels and so flavorful. And those caramelized onions I was able to split the beef into two meals along with veggies and carbs I had at home. I'm used to having meals that include these and the meat at the same price, though I can definitely vouch for the taste and quality of this dish. Aunt Dai, I'll definitely be back!"
/user_details?userid=q7a5NR0Tj6PNIjWxmQjLoQ,Lucy G.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I am going to be very bold here.This is the best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. The best part are the comments that the owner makes on the website's menu. She is very straight to the point, telling you EXACTLY which menu items she does and does not like (often opting out of the westernized dishes.) It kills me, I find it hilarious, but I have also used her advice and it has paid off for me. My favourite dish is the spicy fish filets. I prefer the ones not served in the soupy sauce, but the drier ones. I always order it with rice. Next up is the sweet and spicy tofu (now that I'm vegan I can pretty much only have this without the egg), dry wok chicken, vermicelli salad, and the TWICE COOKED PORK OH MY GOD you have to give this a try at least once. I might cheat on my veganism here and there, and it will likely be to try something new on this menu or get the fish. Anyway, 10/10 love this restaurant. Very kind and accommodating staff."
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I had been wanting to try this establishment for years after reading all the positive reviews on several forums! Finally got around to ordering in today. After several average experiences of Chinese Food in Montreal, I placed the order with low expectations. After going over the menu and pictures on Yelp, I ordered the General Tao Chicken and Hot Pepper with Beef! Both ended up being excellent options but the beef was exceptionally tasty. The food was absolutely delicious, spicy and the ingredients were high quality and fresh! The food arrived in perfect condition as they have great packaging.We were very pleased with our experience and can wait to order again and try more things from the menu! I am ecstatic to have finally found a great Chinese restaurant in the city. Would definitely recommend this establishment to anyone looking for authentic Chinese food in Montreal."

The numbing flavour adds a nice kick to it.Sadly their portions has decreased since the last time I went, but nonetheless delicious!"
/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Ordered through Uber eats for delivery and this was the first time I haven't been disappointed with Chinese food delivery in a long time!We ordered:General tao, beef and brocoli, fried noodles with mixed vegetables, a wonton soup, a sweet and sour soup and an order of spring rolls. Wonton soup was delish. All three mains were very tasty and good portions. Finally I got chicken that wasn't overbreaded! I was very pleased. The only disappointment was the spring rolls which were tiny and bland. I'm not sure if they were fresh.One issue I've had when ordering Chinese is that the boxes aren't always sealed and it becomes an oily mess everywhere. This place uses reusable plastic containers for the most part which avoids mess and is better for the environment.One thing I wish they had is full meal options (ex. Soup, egg roll and mains as a package deal). Ordering individual dishes gets a bit expensive! It was 60$ for everything which isn't so bad and I had a lunch for the next day. However, for orders for bigger groups, ordering individual dishes may not be worthwhile.Overall, very good! 4.5 stars"
/user_details?userid=spU_FM_BDJ8CeZYsfuWo6g,Nancy H.,"Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Canada",5 star rating,"Some of the best Chinese food I've had in a while. Would highly recommend.I went with a group of 10 friends to celebrate lunar new year on a Thursday evening. We were ushered to a large circular table, complete with lazy susan near the back. It was a bit of a tight fit, but we managed. Bigger groups might have an issue, though there is more seating upstairs.We ordered 10 dishes, with a bowl of rice for each (1.50 each). Water was promptly poured, and I was glad it wasn't ice water (ice water is a horrid thing, you can't change my mind). The entire place was empty when we arrived, and remained that way for a while, though a few people trickled in near the end. The food we ordered was great! I don't have any complaints regarding what I tried. The fried rice did contain mushrooms though despite no mention on the menu, to my roommate's chagrin (she abhors them). My favorites were definitely the pork belly with noodles - probably one of the best and most popular dishes, with unctuous fatty belly chunks, thick chewy sweet potato noodles (must order!), the sacha beef or sizzling beef (similar) which had faultlessly tender beef, and three cup chicken which was fragrant and sweet, and the salt and pepper fish and fried pork were fantastic as well. They have a menu online for your perusal- i highly suggest you read the owners comments on the english version, highly entertaining and insightful info!Shockingly, we finished all the food we ordered, and the prices were very reasonable, considering how stuffed we were. Overall I'm very impressed with the food, the vibe, and the friendliness of the staff. I would definitely come back."
/user_details?userid=puMWOwZTa1A2B9oMRFl7KQ,Jason H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place lives up to its reputation.  Stopped in for lunch and ordered the Braised Pork Belly with Sweet Potato noodles - Hong Shao Rou: a savoury fatty pork dish with rice on the side.  Generous portions great service and atmosphere, I really enjoyed this dish and having lunch there.  Plenty of books and a free to use space upstairs for larger groups, they even have language exchange as well.  If you are going to go be sure to read them menu online first, well written and definitely unique.  All round a great experience, if you are looking to grab a bite and in the area Cuisine AuntDai is a place you should try.  auntdai.com/en/?page_id=…"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Authentic and delicious chinese food. Every dish is packed with flavor and didn't disappoint. The place is very gloomy. It used to be a hot pot place and they seem to have kept the tables as they still have the switches on the side.
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"I'm always looking for new places to try in Chinatown. Cuisine AuntDai, which specializes in Sichuan food, was next on the list. It's located upstairs of SAJ Mahal. We dropped in on a Thursday evening (around 6:30pm). The inside is nicer than your typical Chinese spot. Heck, they even have a massive upstairs area (which was completely empty). The menu is a mix of authentic and Canadianized Chinese food. There's appetizers, main dishes, vegetarian, rice and noodles, desserts and drinks. There's also a few pages of handwritten specials; rabbit with Sichuan chili sauce sounded good. Check their website: someone (maybe Aunt Dai?) has written a description and review on almost every dish. A good read!- Tea ($0.99) - lame that they charge you for tea. - 2x Steamed rice ($1.49)- Twice-cooked pork ($12.99) - pork, green pepper, garlic and Sichuan peppercorns. This was a tad spicy and oily but tasty. Liked the mix of vegetables (carrots, onions and green peppers). Pork was slightly fatty but cooked excellently. - Cabbage stir-fry ($9.99) - I was a bit skeptical to order cabbage but this was simple, tender and tasty.- Mapo tofu ($10.99) - tofu, beef and parsley. This came out much later than the other two dishes. Tofu was tender but the dish lacked any heat or numbness. The one I had at Délice Oriental was better.Good but oily food. 3.5 stars."
/user_details?userid=GbDfPbqp7gKRwbn116KDSA,Ben K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"For the low low price of an order of braised pork belly and a refillable plain rice (oh endless fount of the sweet grain of my people), you, too, may inherit your own Chinese aunt.The real gem here is the website, where each item on the menu comes with the *owner's own commentary*. I LOVE this. Get this description of their very own orange beef: ""Comparing to our General Tao Chicken, this one is not THAT good. Anyway, I am not big fan of North American Chinese food and it's your call.""Or the braised pork belly: ""This is a very popular dish among the customers who don't care its greasiness. The flavor is really rich and perfectly balanced. You almost want to sniff the tasty hot air above this beautiful dish... So even you love it, you may not want to have it every time if you are watching your weight because you know you cannot stop if you have started on this one. This is the only reason I try to keep myself away from this plate.""So, bring a friend, $30, a good appetite, and order the braised pork belly with sweet potato noodles, dry-friend green beans, steamed rice. DO IT. You have all winter to work off the extra grease."
/user_details?userid=jpF5VxuG9moPTZzDfAPuSA,Tram L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place was a nice little surprise. (I would take a star off for decor though because even as a ""hole in the wall"" it's still very unwelcoming as ambience. You know how mom&pop's places or your typical joints would still have that ""charm"", this place is just flat out dark and cold lol! Literally. Everytime someone walks in, we would freeze our butts off all over again)Now that I got that out of the way, let's talk about the food :D Like I said, it was a nice little surprise. I myself am not a fan of Chinese food and neither are 2 other of the 3 friends that were there with me... weird, yes but I heard good things so we went for a little discovery :)Our favorite dish was the braised pork belly with sweet potato noodles. We also took the spicy peanut chicken, spicy pork sauté with mushrooms and a beef sauté. Everything tasted good. Some more spicy than others but nothing we couldn't handle. I think we'll come back to try out other stuff next time but it'll be take-out"

My husband and I ordered a plate of vegetable dunplings, squid sizzler, beef sesame and mixed vegetable with cantonese noodles. The taste still lingers in my mouth. All the dishes were delicious. The servers were polite and helpful. The portions were so much that we had to pack half the food. The place is well lit and family friendly. I love their bookshelf, really accentuates the rest of the decor. Definitely going there again."

Like, Aunt Dai, has many many vegetarian options that are all out of this world scrumptious! I've been here so many times and I've yet to order all the vegetarian dishes. Get the eggplant with potato (Dì Sān Xiān) and the garlic and chilli green beans (gàn biān dòu jio) and Tofu Skin Salad (liáng bàn qiān zhāng ) and sweet and spicy potato (Suān Là T Dòu Sī) and cabbage stir fry (shu sī bāo cài) enjoy!!Aunt Dai is glorious. Do yourself a favour ... get super baked, hangout, get the munchies ... and then go to the Aunt Dai website. Seriously. Go to the website and look at the chef's own reviews of the dishes on the menu.You've read that correctly, folks, the chef and owner of Aunt Dai writes a review of each and every item on the menu. And guess what? They're hilarious; this is truly a specimen of true genius. These chef's own reviews basically render ... all of this (pointing to you, Yelp, and to myself in the mirror, me) ... pointless, meaningless and obsolete. Really and truly, it actually saddens me just a tiny bit right now that you haven't stopped reading this trashy pulp, thrown your phone into the fleuve Saint-Laurent and hightailed it to an Internet cafe or something to read these absolutely golden chef's own reviews."
/user_details?userid=o_IEnOVNuir0QNVkANzyXQ,Esteban Y.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"""Hot pepper with beef"" indeed. Although I like hot spicy food, this dish was a little bit too much. Maybe it is ok to share but this dish for one person is a little bit too hot. Plus felt to greasy and fatty for my taste. The waitress did warned me it was hot, I just thought I could handle it hehehe. This restaurant has good reviews, I might have made a poor choice for my taste by selecting this dish, so I will give it a try another day with another option. The menu looks appealing so I'm not throwing their review under a bus :). 4 stars for now."
/user_details?userid=Aw0x_dXz8rQbP6ZoYE8Y0g,Mike C.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"There are two AuntDai restaurants and this one is located near downtown Montreal. The restaurant is on the 2nd floor of a two-story building. The first floor is a Lebanese restaurant. The food served here is mostly Taiwanese cuisine.  During our visit the restaurant was full of patrons and it was a good indicator that all of them were Asians. It speaks volume on the authenticity of the food.  We ordered Ma Po Tofu With Ground Pork, Braised Pork Belly, and Sauteed String Beans.  All of the dishes were tasty and we will return to try their other dishes."

Other than dumplings, even the white rice was sodelicious and hot.  Again, when we arrived the place we had doubts if that will be a good choice; but i am glad we found that place, and tried it, it is the best Chinise food in there!"

This restaurant used to be located at Cote Des Neiges and had a strong reputation. Having been to this location twice. I can still vouch for the mapo tofu 5/5 (possibly the best in MTL), the braised pork and glass noodles 4.5/5, the three cup chicken 4.5/5, the spicy fish fillet 4.5/5,and the poached fish in chili oil 4/5.

I also love their ""hot pot"" dishes with seafood and tofu.The restaurant is also very clean and spacious so you can come in groups. And staff are very nice as well."

They recently changed location and moved closer to Guy Concordia, which is not my favorite area to go out, but for this restaurant I'm willing to take buses and metros if I have to. Their pork belly with sweet potato noodles is my favorite dish, the mixture of spices and flavors makes this is almost a work of art. And no, I'm not exaggerating here, it's an amazing place to eat out if you're looking for authentic Chinese flavors. Hands down, it should be on the list of top Chinese restaurants in Montreal."

We however were worried that maybe the food would not be as good. We were so pleasantly surprised when we found the food is even better. This is in my opinion the best Chinese food in Montreal and serves some of the best Shrimp dishes of any Asian restaurant.Dry wok shrimp and their spicy shrimp are phenomenal . We also like their eggplant , the spicy diced chicken, kung pao chicken, beef with hot pepper and their Cantonese noodles that unlike some other Chinese restaurants are not soaked in too much sauce. I think AuntDai has now officially completed the down town foodie leg of Asian food .You want Japanese go to KazuYou want Korean go to GanadaraFor Chinese ;O Yea... AuntDai it is."

Although some dishes were a bit too salty, the taste was still up there. I got their grilled squid (ok), pad thai (disappointing), broccoli and beef (good), tripe (good) and tofu and seafood pot (good). PRICE: Prices are a tad bit expensive in my opinion, especially seeing how it is in a student-friendly area.

On to the food, it was great. Same quality of food as the one in Côtes-des-neiges. By the way, I met the owner, he remembers me. I spoke to him in Mandarin for the first time as well! We took the braised pork with potato noodles. It is one of the popular dishes in the restaurant and our favourite. We also ordered the eggplants, red and yellow peppers with a tofu kind (or vegetable, sorry! I can't remember the name of the veggie). Near the closing time, we had a chat about the history of China with the owner of the AuntDai restaurants. Overall, if you can ignore the decor, everything is amazingly good. The owner really makes this place as authentic as possible. Apparently, 6 of the dishes are from North of China. You don't need to go to China to have a taste of authentic cuisine.

The pork was juicy and flavorful, it wasn't spicy/hot (I wish it was a little) and it was a good amount for a fair price. Highly recommend it."

/user_details?userid=XhH_xgNmL_G6TXtFq5MhrQ,Chrisy Y.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my favourite restaurants in Greater Montreal. Delicious food + consistency + great service. The winning combination that keeps me coming back. I've been to all of their locations over the years and they have never disappointed me. My favourite dishes: Cabbage stir-fry, Lamb hot pot, twice cooked pork. Tried the new Sichuan Pepper Chicken Salad for the first time yesterday. I now have a new must-order dish. Already looking forward to my next visit!"

Food was really authentic and tasty! Staff were very nice and helpful too. Nice experience and will come back soon! Ate too fast so forgot to take photos
/user_details?userid=sBwchHg_AxcgaN-e_UoraQ,Doug S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The caveat for this review is it was a takeout. I typically give more leeway for takeout because I find, things are not always equal. Picked up a bunch of food on Chinese New Year's Eve. I will also add that I've been to their previous location many times on Cote-des-Neiges and loved it every time. This time I was a little disappointed, so maybe I would have been better off eating there. I ordered the pork belly with sweet potato noodles. Good but flavour neutral, which was never the case for this dish. The green beans were as good as always, general tao (for my daughter) a little less perfect. The satay beef was good, not great and same with the beef udon. I give them 4 stars not 5 because of my past experiences but hopefully next time will get back to their usual 5 star, food standards."

Started with a won ton soup and sweet and sour- both were delicious!! Then came the salt and pepper shrimp by far the best dish for me! Then we had the satay beef which was tender and so yummy!! Then we had the three cup chicken, was a real crowd pleaser. The service was amazing. For Mother's Day, they brought a free glass of wine. Good music,Good vibesWill for sure  be coming backI would like the recipe for the salt and pepper shrimp! It was finger licking good!!!"
/user_details?userid=bxaICaGxzYHSB1MsztlGdg,Matylda K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"In Montreal, this is our favourite Chinese restaurant. For vegetarians like us, this place provides a variety of ultra tasty meals. You can request the meat to be removed from many of the dishes (yay! More options for us!). Try their cabbage (best I've ever tried), eggplants and mapo tofu. Their dishes are sooooo flavourful and well-balanced that it's hard not to come back on the next day! Fair enough, I'm a fan of Chinese food, but this restaurant is truly making me dream about their food (only Chinese food lovers will understand - how can we live without this explosion of flavours? - you get the point)."
/user_details?userid=dsyKE9mcbJORat0ZNTG_qA,Enoch L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants because of the more, rather, authentic type of Chinese foods offered (as well as accommodating the North American general tao), and their service has been great for the times that I've came here. I've had the Mapo Tofu and the Kung Pao Chicken, and they both bring back nostalgia. Will definitely decide to come back!"

/user_details?userid=m0_W4iHkNZddR0msFtXI4w,Winncie L.,"Verdun, Canada",2 star rating,"This review was based on what I ordered today: general tao, pork dumplings and tofu salad. The flavors were bland. Nothing on the plates was memorable or make me want to eat it again. Very disappointed. Maybe other dishes are better, but I would never know because I don't plan on going back."
