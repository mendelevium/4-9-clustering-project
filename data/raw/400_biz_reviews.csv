""Thali"" is an integral part of Indian cuisine with super nutritious food covering all nutritional elements to make it a wholesome meal. But, even if vegetarian, it involves a lot of dairy and with the poor understanding of what vegan food shouldn't involve, Indian restaurants, generally, fail big time in creating good vegan dishes - but not this one. We came across Hindusthali about 1.5 years ago when it was vegetarian but then gave up the idea considering that it would involve a lot of dairy. But recently, thanks to Risa's review, when we came to know that they have fully veganized the menu - we just couldn't resist the temptation. And this is probably the best meal we have had at any restaurant in Montreal, not just Indian. We went for two Thali A that have a salad, a lentil curry (Dal), Baigan Bhartha, two vegetable curries, Rice, Papadum and a Naan/Chapati. The owner, Hakim, a very kind man, was amazed to know that we are Indians too and, in fact, his family roots traced to the same state in India where we are from. He suggested some very non-traditional vegetable curries like Karela (bitter gourd) and Bhinda (Okra) since he knew our palate would be ready for that. So, in the first thali, we went for Mixed Beans and Bhinda while, in the second thali, we went for Karela and Korma. We shared the curries and loved them all. The food was very homely (and I really really mean it) with the balance of spices and minimal usage of oil. The smokiness of the Baigan Bhartha was super. The Karela sabzi was great - have started liking it since adulthood :D (hardly any child in India loves bitter gourd since, obviously, it is a bitter curry). Dal was amazing and so was rice. Hakim also provided us with his special green chilli chutney which was a great supplement with the bite of Naan-Curry. We also went for a Salted Lassi which was good. With the thickness, it was closer to buttermilk than Lassi but for Gujarati food lovers, that's even better. The ambiance of the place is great with some beautiful paintings on the wall and some instruments placed next to the entrance. It's a small space with just about 12-13 tables and the service is quite good. Reservations would be recommended if you're going on a weekend. The first time we called, they were full so we couldn't go. The food takes some time to arrive but it is definitely worth more than the wait. Overall, a big thumbs up. Definitely recommended."

We were so excited to see Hindusthali pop up on Yelp and even more excited when we arrived to see the warm, welcoming, lovely space, and the owner chef settling up a high chair for us and chatting with us about the big step of taking his delicious restaurant from vegetarian to vegan. The owner Hakim and his entire staff are warm and friendly, waving at the baby from behind the kitchen counter, coming over to share a little sample of a soup she might like, and totally unbothered when she decided to eat a mango lassi for dinner. (Picking my battles here people, and I can't really blame her, the lassi was insanely good.)This is a thali restaurant so the options are simple, pick a thali with one or two dishes and let the chef take care of the rest. The vegan paneer and garlic vegan naan were the stars of the show as far as we were concerned, these were just spectacular, rivaling any of their dairy laden peers. We had beers, enjoyed our lovely meals, soaked in a little of the soul warmth tucked out of the snow and the wind on a wild evening in February on St Denis. This just became one of our favourites, can't wait to go back."

It's a small and very cozy spot. Simple brick wall with wooden furniture. The restaurant is ran by a couple, very sweet, and their two sons would come after school to help them, plus an employee. Their menu is simple, the appetizer would be the special of the day. Main dish, are three sizes of Thalis. It usually comes with Dal, Salad, rice, papadum, either naan bread or chapati bread ... and choices 1, 2, or 3 vegetables dishes of the day. The family cater a simple ""Ghar Ka Khana"", which means home food. All the food tasted fantastic, but little kick (spicy) was missing  We also tried gulab jamun, pistachio kulfi, very satisfying desert for my belly. I also requested for a Masala Chai. That was a disappointment, first it was served in regular mug, in stead of fancy, silver Indian dish ware. Then it was to watery. To pay, we do go to the cash register and pay it.It was lovely experience; there food was ok."

And in fact it was vegan, even the naan bread which is normally made with dairy, was fluffy and pillowy and delicious!Starter was perfectly crisp and subtly spiced pakoras with the most delicious balanced tamarind sauce I've ever had!Then the main was the Thali B plate which had a vegetable mix curry, a dhal which was one of the best I've had, eggplant caviar which was perfectly balanced and a salad and rice (also a pappadam).I also tried the chai masala with almond milk, creamy and comforting! I'm a fan of cardamom and I really enjoyed the almond cream cardamom pudding, which had vermicelli pasta and chunks of almonds, also tried the Gulam jamun which was really nice and vegan too.What's even more exciting is that the owner said he's working on a new menu for the summer and everything will be 100% vegan! Yey for everyone including the mother cows and their babies!Can't wait to taste more exciting delicious balanced vegan Indian dishes at Hindustali this summer!"

The chef is from France... he really cares about the treatment of the herbs, spices and vegetables. There really is no menu - he prepares an offering each night with additional curries.  It's a wonderful way to experience food if you are open minded."

/user_details?userid=Tgw7-BlvgIq-BGuVbfGLag,Yi Z.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"Though the restaurant is small, the service and the food quality are both at very high standard. Mango lassi is the best I have tried in life. My husband ordered plate A, I ordered plate B, both are very healthy and yummy. The owner let me try some spicy green sauce. When I mixed the sauce with eggplant or beans, it adds more flavors and tickled my tongue a bit. I loved it! If you love spice food, try it."
/user_details?userid=avVUCTxoK0UmBzoUx4Arjw,Jay D.,"Phillipsburg, NJ",5 star rating,"If I had to describe Hindusthali in a sentence, I would say: A wonderful restaurant run by wonderful people!My wife and I stumbled across Hindusthali by chance while walking towards another Indian restaurant a few streets away. I happened to notice that the awning advertised they specialized in vegetarian Indian food, so I suggested that we check it out. My wife follows a vegan diet, and we both love Indian food, so it seemed promising.As soon as I walked in, I had the impression that Hindusthali would be special. The atmosphere is very relaxed and quiet. The place feels intimate, and a welcome change of pace from busy St. Denis. The walls were beautifully decorated with lots of wood and Indian-inspired paintings.We were promptly greeted by a friendly man, who I later realized was the owner, and led to a table. He explained the way the menu works: three types of Thali's (platters with several small bowls of vegetarian Indian dishes, along with basmati rice and choice of bread). He also mentioned the day's specials - freshly made pakoras with tamarind chutney and a vegetable soup - taking the time to show us pictures of the dishes on his phone. This sort of attention to detail epitomizes what makes Hindusthali so special, and it's a refreshing change from the rushed service found at many restaurants these days.My wife and I both ordered the pakora appetizer to start, and the Thali I platters for our meal. The pakoras were delicious, and tasted fresher than I can remember at any other Indian restaurant I've been to. You can tell they were made to order, and were not overly greasy (as is often the case with pakoras). They also were beautiful when cut open: bright green on the inside, suggesting that many herbs went into the recipe! Tamarind chutney was likewise delicious and added a nice subtle sweetness when paired with a pakora.Our thalis came with: cabbage salad, daal, vegetable curry, basmati rice, papadum, and a bread.The cabbage salad was a great way to start the meal. Lightly pickled and seasoned with an herb that eludes me, it was very tasty. I love cabbage, but had never seen it on the menu at an Indian restaurant, so this was a pleasant surprise.The daal was also delicious. Thick, chunky, and well-flavored (but not over-seasoned), it paired perfectly with the moist and fluffy basmati rice, as well as the breads.For breads, I ordered the chapati, and my wife opted for the naan (after initially requesting the chapati). She prefers naan to chapati, but rarely is able to order it as it usually contains dairy milk. Somehow the owner (our waiter) was able to sense her hesitation and informed her that all ingredients in the thali were vegan. That's another example of the incredible level of detail in the customer service here.In any event, both breads were excellent, as was the papadum. I liked pairing my papadum with the chili sauce they provided and the chapati with the daal and vegetable curry.That brings me to the vegetable curry (or more accurately ""curries""). We each received a different curry dish, as they apparently had two curries cooking that day. My wife received a zucchini curry, while mine was based on peas and sweet corn. Neither of us had seen zucchini or corn used in an Indian dish before, but we found both curries delicious. I never would have thought to use corn or zucchini as a base in a curry, and this shows some serious imagination in their daily menu.Last but not least, I would be remiss if I did not mention their dessert options.My wife was happy to see they offered a vegan-friendly version of Gulab Jammun (rose-syrup donuts), which she has not been able to eat since starting a vegan diet. She loved the donuts, and I thought they were the best version I've had, as they were not too sweet.I ordered the vanilla ice cream with mango, which was beautifully presented with a generous serving of puréed mango as topping. The vanilla ice cream was delicious in itself, but when combined with the mango was one of the most delicious desserts in my recent memory. I never would have thought to pair mango and ice cream, but it was unbelievably tasty, and had a nice velvety texture too.Overall, I came away with a stellar impression of Hindusthali and the friendly family running it. I get the sense that they are always experimenting in their home kitchen, and the daily thali dishes are their way of sharing their new creations with their customers. This definitely felt the most home-cooked of the many meals I have had at Indian restaurants....almost as if it was prepared by a good friend or family member (who just so happens to be an amazing cook!)I would recommend Hindusthali to anyone who likes Indian food (and is open to vegetarian cuisine), and will certainly be returning the next time I am in Montreal."

Not just vegetarian, but vegan including the homemade naan and gulab jamun for dessert. All the food was super fresh, could taste the spices. And not just regular fare. Whole menu is three sizes of thali plates - the same plus one or two more vegetable curries of the day. I already want to go back. The owners are lovely people and made us feel very welcome. Cozy space, highly recommend!"

Not only is the food delicious and vegetarian (yay!!), but the decor is so lovely. I felt like I was stepping back into India the moment I stepped over the threshold. And best part of all... the family that runs the restaurant is the sweetest. I will definitely be back and highly recommend for an all-around fabulous dining experience."
