/user_details?userid=GnJ2w63izmrICmt1wNCGOA,Laurence V.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,"I cannot insist more; you have to come here at least once in your life! Not only do they have an inspiration menu that is so affordable for the quality, this was one of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had. The waiters really take care of you, get to know you, and share knowledge with you. You're paying for amazing food, carefully thought out dishes, but also for the experience. The restaurant itself is very small, so as group of 4, we reserved way ahead and were able to get a table. 2 of us got all the different items of the inspiration menu and then just ordered different dishes made to share. We started off with foie gras, foamed parmesan and a layer of wine emulsion, which was so good. I had the squash cream soup with smoked bacon which was tasty but maybe not the most intriguing dish. I got to try the smoked herring which was beautifully plated. I love that there were different textures as well, but the taste of the fish is really strong I must say. From the tasting portion menu, we shared as an entrée was the quail, which was completely deboned and filled with foie gras instead, and the egg mimosa, which is a classic dish and so fascinating with the stuffing of crab and caviar. Both dishes were delicious!As a main course, I had the braised beef which melted in my fork practically and I tried the cod, which was exquisite as well. I also tried the truffle spaghetti which was out of this world with how creamy but not heavy the parmesan sauce was. We also had the beef tenderloin which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Now the 2 highlights of my night: the bread and the mashed potatoes. The homemade and fresh assorted breads are to die for. Only at L'Atelier Joël Robuchon can you say that you need to come here for the bread. They provide small baguette bread, a cheesy bread, the snail which is covered in butter with fleur de sel, and the bread with bacon and moutarde de meaux. For the infamous mashed potatoes; the only way to describe them is that they will be hands down the smoothest and creamiest you will ever have. No wonder Joël Robuchon won his first Michelin star with them!We ended the night with desserts, including the chocolate one from the inspiration menu which was heavy in cocoa but if you're a sweet and chocolate lover it is perfect for you. I really wanted to try the yuzu dish but it wasn't part of the inspiration menu. However, the waiter so kindly got it for my anyways and I loved it. It's a yuzu cake with a coriander sorbet and coconut mousse, all fillings inside a sugar ball with yuzu cream on the plate. It was so unexpected how the flavours worked so well together, and it was delightful.No matter how costly your bill can get, I cannot emphasize enough on how worth it L'Atelier Joël Robuchon is. The food, the experience, the service were perfect. I've never loved French food as much as I do now, and you will not regret coming here."
/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,"Slightly disappointed because it is after all JR so was expecting everything to be impeccable!Arrived at the restaurant and it is not as nice as I would have hoped it to be. I had reserved bar/counted seating and when we  arrived, we were  offered to seat next to  another 2 people when there were other places available...we finally had a little corner of our own...but thought it was weird and bad call on the hostess.As for the menu, you can either order a la carte or one of its 4 set menus. We opted for the smaller menu at $85 as it was a 4 course meal and felt it  would  have been enough for us. We started  with a basket of fresh warm bread...OMG the breads were good. All in tiny format for easier consumption. We finished the entire basket.My friend and I shared everything so got to taste pretty much everything on the menu.Everything was good but nothing was extraordinary.  I don't know if it is because I have been to lot of good restaurants and am now harder to impress?!? A friend of mine told me that this is a notch down compared to the one in Vegas so maybe that's why. Had tasted the famous mashed potato but thought it way to rich...must have like an entire stick of butter in there. Had 2 spoons full and couldn't go on.We did have an excellent bottle of wine which was recommended by the sommelier. Must say that  the wine is definitely  on the pricey side but we found a good bottle for $100.Service was also good but not outstanding. Glad went tried it but won't be returning."
/user_details?userid=sGJvx1MTsetDzsnrHfJHLg,Aaron E.,"Orange County, CA",5 star rating,"It is Joël Robuchon. Of course it gets 5 stars. L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon is a casual and delightful environment where you can freely speak with the Chefs and service staff behind the long counter housing the open kitchen while you watch the chefs preparing your food, timed to perfection largely employing the Sous Vide method. Based on a few reviews I read prior to visiting, I believe the average Yelper believes that the ""casual"" piece should mean that it is inexpensive - which it is not - so expect to pay accordingly.The interior is an interesting mash-up​ of French Bistro and Nightclub which makes you feel comfortable in a freshly ironed polo shirt while others in your party will feel just as at home in a small black dress and a pair of Louboutins. The service is impeccable, as expected, and features a unique chance to ask any question you may have while the kitchen is at work quid pro quo. This is something you could never do at restaurant Joël Robuchon located in Las Vegas. Take advantage of this opportunity and you will learn more in one meal than you would be watching a decade worth of Food Network. In a word, L'Atelier is ""fun"" for any inquisitive culinary adventurer.Chef Robuchon's kitchen set the bar high from the onset with their signature L'amuse - Bouche which is an irreproachable Foie Gras Parfait with Port Wine and Parmesan Foam that somehow tastes even better than it sounds. The rich and velvety Foie Gras is tamed by a light and cool Parmesan Foam that sports hints of Port in the close. There is nothing to not adore about this single bite of cuisine. From there a Bread Basket will make itself to you - don't sleep on the Baguette and French Butter - it is as good as any from Bouchon, perhaps better still. For my main entree, I decided to put the ""mastermind"" to the test with his Spanish Octopus featuring fresh Beluga Caviar and a marinated Spring Mix as a base. The hand-cut​ pieces of Octopus are exceptionally large but cooked flawlessly thanks to the Sous Vide method and chew more like a Steak than what you would expect from Octopus - a welcome and delicious surprise. The generous portion of Caviar imparts a salty/briny component that seems to match the savory Seafood perfectly without making the flavor profile too busy or confused. The only other detectable seasonings were a bit of Sea Salt and cracked Black Pepper and that was all that was required to make this dish exceptional. Best mated with a cold, hoppy IPA from the nearby long bar. Best Octopus dish on the planet? So far for this Yelper. I figure some will cringe at the $70.00+ tab (tip included) but I would argue that the ingredients used and the skill of the kitchen actually makes this a very reasonable value. I am excited to have L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon as my 30th Michelin Star and cannot wait to get next door as soon as possible to see what Joël Robuchon itself has in store for me. Simply exquisite - a must try if you are in MTL."

I came with my wife to celebrate our anniversary and we each had a different tasting menu. We were delighted by each item they served. The experience however goes beyond food. We had a great time, sitting at the counter and chatting with the servers and observing the chefs in the kitchen operate with calm and grace beyond all understanding. Live entertainment?Our server explained to us that if you wish to sit at the table instead of the counter, you'll need a company of at least three. Otherwise they will assign you a counter seat, in which case remember to request for one with a clear view of the kitchen."
/user_details?userid=QxyH3kOJMTVARsU1dUrIUg,Tiffany Y.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Come during mtl à table and enjoy the inspiration menu. Overall is great!! The amuse-bouche is surprising - the tasting of the foie gras is so good. I ordered the breads twice - they are so delicious that I cannot stop thinking about them!! Especially the one called snail, which rolls like a snail. The taste of butter is unforgettable :)The main course is a little salty for me so I drink a lot of water, and worth mentioning, even their sparkling water is great. And the dessert, the combination of pear and chocolate is surprising! The sweetness is moderate so if you don't like something that is too sweet you will definitely love it.After tax and tips it costs around $140 for one person. I think during the period of mtl à table it's acceptable, but in other period I find their tasting menu is around $150-$200, which is a little overpriced. Located in casino, the transportation is not so convenient either if you don't have a car. So I'd recommend come during these special festivals!!"
/user_details?userid=tKteMlXscSYxHNQkgpT16A,Cory T.,"Los Angeles, CA",1 star rating,"Shockingly horrible experience at this L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Montreal! We've dined a couple times at the full Robuchon restaurant in Las Vegas and have always felt like those were one of the top meals we've had of all time (this is including quite an extensive list of Top San Pellegrino/World's Top 50 and Michelin star restaurants).However, this experience in Montreal was definitely by far one of THE WORST.The location is confusing and hard to find, it's awkward going into a 2/3 star level casino that's loud and rowdy, just to get to the restaurant. It felt like walking thru a Walmart to dine at Alinea in the back room.Once inside though, it feels much better...BUT, our table was not ready for a good 25-30 min AFTER our reservation time, which is ok since things do happen from time to time but I would think that at the very least, the hostess/manager would offer some tea or mocktails for us while we had to wait.When we did get seated, there was no acknowledgement by anyone behind the chef's counter (which felt more like sitting at a regular hotel bar...with a kitchen behind the ""bartenders"" that you can see from your seat)...my fiance and I waited and waited and despite 3-5 staff members passing by, no one ever made eye contact to welcome us, no one even brought water/asked if we wanted sparkling or still...the bare minimum you'd expect at any restaurant esp after having to wait 30 minutes already for our seats.Next thing you know, another older couple were seated next to us and they seemed like regulars/knew several of the restaurant staff...they were warmly greeted and before the two could even get seated at the counter, they already had water and someone taking their drink orders!It really felt like a slap in the face and as I made backup plans by phone (resulting in going to Maison Boulud instead later)...my fish fiance still was not able to get anyone's attention at all despite 2-3 staff members chattering with the old couple next to us!50 minutes past our reservation, we just decide to leave...frustrated and shockingly disappointed in the lack of service here! It really did NOT feel like the classic Robuchon vibe at all but even then, I can't say I've had many/any experiences of waiting almost an hour with no one coming by to greet us or even to bring water to the table!"
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This restaurant is amazing! I made my boyfriend bring me on a Wednesday night instead of a Saturday night for my birthday because it was cheaper. The four course tasting menu was $85 which is a good deal. The first course was a cup with a layer of creamy foie gras,  a layer of parmesan and a layer of wine émulsion all in one shot glass. This was amazing!! I wish there had been more of it! For the second course I had the spicy bison tartare with whipped cream and truffle.  My boyfriend had the grilled octopus with white kidney bean salad, anise and orange. I didn't find the bison tartare spicy at all but we both loved it. Both were good but if we had to choose we both preferred the tartare to the octopus. I did taste the anise in the grilled octopus (I.e it tasted a bit like sambucca) but I did not taste the orange at all. My boyfriend and I both had the piglet rib and loin duo dish instead of the halibut because we are not fish people and the waitress assured me that the halibut tasted fishy. Both pork pieces were amazing. However I didn't enjoy the side of potatoes with lardons so I gave it to my boyfriend.We had two servings of homemade bread. It was delicious. There was one that was flaky, round and salty. Another bread was twisted like a braid and had lardons in it too. There was another that was just a regular small baguette and the last type of bread was a cheesy bread.For dessert we had a  cup with a thin layer of chocolate on top wit the name of the resto and then inside there was a chocolate mousse with crumbled biscuit and cocoa sorbet. It was light and not too sweet. I loved it! When we left (I guess it's because they knew we came for my birthday) they gave us two bottled water and a dessert to take home! So nice! Can't wait to try the dessert! This is a great place to take your significant other for a special occasion. Highly recommend!!"

/user_details?userid=0Se8OFrPpi6wE2TY2IVTLA,Eric N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Tried this fancy place last night and I gotta say, what an experience! Being a Michelin 3-star restaurant Internationally, you'll be treated to an incredible experience for the eyes to the nose, from the nose to the mouth. They will bring the food on a course basis depending on the how many you've ordered. The food are so beautifully place that you don't even want to touch it! It's simply art! For the taste, I need to say that I preferred some more than others but overall is very good! My favorite has to be my main course Wagu Beef. Ambiance was quite nice, we were sat by the bar where you get to see, from a distance, the chefs preparing the food. We had Benoit serving us most of the night with Anne. They both offer great services, every time they bring you a dish they will explain to you what is and the ingredients. Benoit is wine savvy, ask him for advice!! The overall experience is, it is a prestigious experience. Joël Robuchon has multiple locations around the world such as Las Vegas, Japan, Hong Kong, Paris, Shanghai, coming soon to NYC and also Montreal since December 2016. So for me, it's a bucket list item. Done and thank you."
/user_details?userid=6eYecZI0cGbSdVP33PawDA,Frédéric L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,This was my first time at the Atelier Robuchon I was super excited given the reputation. Immediately when walking in I was in awe with the decor which is very slick and feels out of a James Bond movie. Being seated at the counter was great because the kitchen is totally open and part of the experience. It was surprisingly quiet and well synchronized!As a first timer I chose the tasting menue which was a 7 course meal and I would say that every was really a stunning piece of art. Everything from foie gras to halibut filet to bison was uniquely prepared and dressed. The master piece was the Forest cake which is a large mushroom made of cherry and chocolate standing in a forest. They have their own bakery and the most beautiful desserts I have ever seen. A picture is worth a thousand words so the review comes with the course meal.

Few things to announce :1, very hard to book, please call in advance maybe one week .2, if you r less than four ,you can only sit at bar( comptoir) ps: this is the only problem that I don't like , I rarely sit at bar cuz too narrow and very unconfi .Food : qualified , a lot of small dishes that you can try different type and flavor , they all delicate and taste .( we ordered an tasting menu of ¥200/9 course which Is a very convenience price rate and some other dishes and another main course since we r two ) Good thing is they r not forcing you to order tasting menu for whole table service since lots of other resto must does , so you can share the tasting menu with .Service：Very kind, follow up on time. Environment: not as fancy as on google map photo Overall: I feel it's a very good restaurant hold up by casino , lol went so many times to casino never realize this restaurant.Compare to Toqué , europea , queue de cheval, la chasse et peche , Maison boulud etcMy top 3 : la chasse et peche , Joel , europea ."

The complete experience was perfect from start to finish. Every mouthful tells a story, a symphony of flavours and watching the kitchen staff is like a ballet. The drinks are also some of the best I've had. What I loved most, it's the ability to personalize our menu, the wine pairing and the relaxed atmosphere. Worth every penny. A place to go back to time and time again... Special thanks to Jean-Marc (chef), Benoit (awesome service) and Charles (sommelier)."
/user_details?userid=3NvmvvKNUcigSkT5OlLM7A,Vincent T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Had one tasting menu (7 services) + an entree + main dish + 2 glass of wine. We were both super filled. Nothing wow me. Had 2-3 items a bit too salty. Desert saved the night. Way overpriced for what it's worth (or taste).Expectation were all time high considering they spent $11M to attract a Michelin French chef to the Casino. So much more could have been done with so many local talents available at a fraction of that cost!
/user_details?userid=6N-lHUqpSOXgzfYfsTDxsw,Rossi W.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,The best tasting menu I had in Canada. Everything was carefully prepared. Best ingredients. The rank will be re arranged after this. A great experience for my birthday. It cost over $500 for two people. But you got 15 courses all together!
/user_details?userid=yQelw2nnzrK7Y7XbBX8Pyg,Carol L.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"Warning, this is a long overdue review and as a homage to a gifted and celebrated chef.  Hubby and I came here about 2 months ago to celebrate my birthday.  This was a special treat for not only me, but for the both of us.  We had reservations that seated us near the window, so we could enjoy the waterfront view as well as the dark, rich and modern interior of the restaurant.   The seating along the bar had an intricate glass display of edible art, each one carefully representing a spring themed motif.  At Joël Robuchon, we selected the 7 and 9 course menu to ensure we could sample both seasonal tasting menus.  Each course was presented in front of us and was explained in precise detail of what it was and how to enjoy it. We never felt rushed at all.  The courses came at a steady pace along with wine that complemented the dish.  The service was impeccable!  Our dedicated server made sure we were welcomed and comfortable, which immensely enhanced our night.  We had the manager check on our dining experience several times throughout the evening.  He was charming and engaging.  We were even offered a free scallop dish that was  from their new summer menu.  Since it was my birthday, I asked if I could replace my dessert from the tasting menu with their signature Forest dessert.  They accommodated my request and made it especially for me. The food was exceptionally outstanding and immaculate.  Joël Robuchon, you have selected your chefs at this Montréal location to be fabulous and inventive with the courses.  Our meal was made spectacular by everyone at the restaurant and thank you for the end of meal parting gift.   You will be missed in the culinary world."
/user_details?userid=6GN1-lN562HbUOBN51AeYQ,Frédéric T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Took a chance for a last minute table on a random Wednesday and was not disappointed. We were seated at the bar, which I recommend over the table if you are a party of two (to look at the staff work). The food was amazing! I tried the artichoke and the quail and my girlfriend had the dorade (which I highly suggest) and the Bison and foie gras and everything was outstanding. If I had only one small bad thing to say about the experience would be with the waiting staff (had a few small huckups on the service, nothing major). The view is perfect, the place is sharp and the attention to details is amazing. A+ experience."

The dessert is to die for! A must try in Montréal not to miss!"
/user_details?userid=FtGTO3MShfZdG-TAOTloGA,Johnny R.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"If this review was solely based on the food I would rate it a 5 star as the food was exceptional. We reserved online and wrote a note saying that it was our anniversary. I then called during the week to confirm reservation and ask for some adjustments on their tasting menu which they accomodated. Over the phone the lady mentioned we see it's for an anniversary as well. On the day of right before the dessert came the table next to us received a bag with gifts inside and the waitress said ""we noticed it was your anniversary when you booked online"" and offered them gifts for it. Unfortunately for us, we got the bill and it ended there. Now under normal circumstance it would have been fine, but because a few minutes before we saw the table next to us receive a gift in an exclusive bag, this upset us quite a bit."
