/user_details?userid=iJ_sn6RfwO5unR9YgFTd4Q,Camille R.,"Côte-des-Neiges, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,We arrived here with expectations and they surpassed them. The service was excellent. The dishes we had were excellent except for the grilled octopus. It was a bit chewy and the hummus next to it a bit bland. The lamb chops were cooked to perfection and they were the best lamb chops I've ever tasted. I would definitely come again and try more and have the lamb again.
/user_details?userid=LlMfTEapbG0ikzdoqA8oGQ,Alexia B.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"Amazing lunch deal. I lived a minute away from Milos for over a year but I thought it was all ""hype"" so I wasn't too tempted to try it. I'm glad my friends said we had to go because the interior design transported me to warmer lands and the dishes were extremely fresh and satisfying. If you're not sure that you're a fan of oysters get the three oyster appetizer! They were perfect; the right amount of salt without being ""fishy."" The Greek Spreads is also a safe and versatile bet for an appetizer. I had a bite of my friend's salmon and it was probably the best cooked salmon I've ever had. My salmon tartare was good and everything I was expecting from a salmon tartare. You MUST get the baklava ice-cream. No question. You MUST! The crunchy baklava folded into the creamy ice-cream was a delight. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal and the lunch price for the high-quality fare is hard to beat. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to enjoy fresh food in a classy setting and I hope to go back and try their dinner menu. The only downsides were related to service. I think it could have been a training day. It took a long time for our orders to be taken and I was left thirsty a few times. My order ticket was left on my plate. My friends asked for milk and sugar with their coffees but I had to ask for it a second time after the coffees were on the table."

Service is good & the staff caters to all your needs. With a calm & up scale vibe, Jacky has to behave. With the Blue & White decor, they make you feel like you're dining in Santorini. Parkings tough but there's valet. Jacky had the salmon sashimi & the Dorade Grillé. Both were simply prepared but brought out the freshest tastes in Jacky's mouth.

/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great restaurant. I would highly recommend it. However, I would advise going for their after 10pm special. The after 10 special costs around $25 and comes with an appetizer, main and dessert.The night started with one of the waiters bringing us bread. He then poured olive oil in a dish located in the middle of the table. Upon pouring, the oil splashed and landed on my button-downed shirt. I had to flag this before any action was taken by our original waiter. His replacement quickly brought me a cup of water and a cloth to dab it out of my shirt. Thankfully, it came out. For the appetizer, I opted for the salmon sashimi. It was quite delicious and very flavourful. My friend ordered the Milos tasting dip which was also delicious. After finishing the pita bread and still having some dip remaining, one of the many waiters came to offer if we'd like the have some more (which we accepted ). We both originally ordered the dorado fish until we were told that they did not have any left. Instead, they offered us the choice of the lavraki fish (we were told that it was of better quality and bigger, so we agreed). The lavraki did not disappoint at all, it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The one negative remark that I would make is that it only came with a single piece of broccoli, would've liked to have a couple more. For dessert, since we both wanted to have the raspberry sorbet as well as the baklava, our waiter offered to bring both! The sorbet was amazing and so was the baklava (might've been a little too sweet but was still delicious). All in all, I would highly recommend this restaurant (after 10pm of course. If not, get ready to spend a hefty amount)."
/user_details?userid=LJmdyaOmmpJSXUCvppTH7Q,Philippe L.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Canada",3 star rating,"Unless you're a millionaire that loves fish, perhaps Milos isn't the place for you.  They do seafood/fish very well and you can certainly get rare catches you wouldn't get elsewhere.  Once you go out of the sea realm, Milos' offering is average at best.  By far the toughest thing to swallow over there is the bill; their prices are monstrous considering the quality of the food you're getting.  Bottomline is that you really are paying for the decor and the atmosphere (and it's quite nice, it is an institution after all) because even the service is a little uneven.Their Sunday night $55 menu might be worth it, especially for fish lovers.  Expect to pay a little over SAQ x 3 prices for wine.To be honest Milos is a little dépassé; resting on their laurels while there are many good restaurants in Montreal that deserve your attention."
/user_details?userid=TdkAOOvCtFLoFLLsxZNL5g,Zou Y.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Lunch menu 29.5 for three course! Such a great deal. Unfortunately they don't have octopus for starters now(unless you add $15).Dorado Royal is a must try! So fresh and tender. We also love the desserts. Both walnut cake and ice cream are amazing.
/user_details?userid=U5YQX_vMl_xQy8EQDqlNQQ,Stephanie S.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,"Tip:  If money IS an object, check out this place for their Lunch/Late Dinner (after 10pm, 3-course) prix fixe menu!  Late Dinner (~$25) fixed price was quite reasonable for the quality of food served.Outside is very minimalistic, but the inside was bustling and much fancier feeling.  Dress up, a bit, unless you can impress with your wallet!  Waiters are very unpretentious though and do make you feel a bit important...despite ordering from the ""special menu"".For a Late Dinner, on a Saturday night, place was almost full and it was LOUD.  I don't remember any discernible music, but atmosphere was loud with the chattering of the guests.Everything was good, although there are some stand-outs out of the courses, namely:  Greek salad (looked soo fresh!) as App, Borade as the Main, and the Baklava...soo good!  The EVOO that was served with the bread was also very memorable.The only thing that was iffy were the zucchini ""fries"" that came as a side with the Tuna Burger.  Fries were more of a shoestring and they were too greasy and limp.Otherwise, this place gets a 5* simply because as a ""fancier"" restaurant, I was impressed that they did offer a reasonably priced fixed menu that wasn't too much of a splurge!"
/user_details?userid=WMK1j18ACm-EtopEznV4Rg,Jana T.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"This was more of a 3 1/2 star review for me but rounded it up to a 4... not that Milos needs my pity, they seem to be doing very well for themselves.  5/5 for decor, it's a beautiful space filled with beautiful people and makes you feel fancier just by being here.  It is a bit of a scene, so depends on whether you like that or not.  We were there for New Year's Eve so it was nice to have a little bit of a glamorous evening.  4/5 for the food, we had a variety of appetizers, including the calamari, octopus, and various salads.  Everything was very fresh and well prepared but nothing really blew me away.  For our main our group shared a market price fish, it was brought whole to the table and was expertly deboned and perfectly cooked.  The Greek wine from Santorini was excellent.  3/5 for value.  As others have noticed, it's ridiculously overpriced for what it is.  I've had equally good Greek food at other high end Greek restaurants for half the price. 3/5 for service.  Our waiter was borderline rude and condescending.  He forgot one of our appetizers and shrugged when we asked about it and said it would turn up with the main course.  Unimpressed with the attitude although he was very knowledgeable about the menu.  The front of house staff and sommelier were all very pleasant to deal with.  It's a Montreal institution, and I'm glad I went.  I don't think I'd go back unless it was on someone else's dime though.  You can get the same quality food for half the price with much friendlier service at places like Ikanos.  If you want a beautiful place to see and be seen and money is no object, then you will enjoy Milos.  PS: everyone tells me their lunch special is amazing value, although I haven't tried it that might be a better way to experience this place."

It tasted great though. The octopus was my favorite. We even ordered a 2nd round of it.For my entree, I went with the lamb chops. It came with a delicious greek house salad. The lamb chops itself was good but nothing spectacular in taste. It also wasn't the largest chop and had less fat than I'd prefer. My aunt's fish was good. Just olive oil and lemon on it; simple. Finish the meal off with ice cream and baklava, neither of which were  impressive.The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and our waiter was magnificent (except when it came time to pay as that took him quite a while...). But I did enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant and the food presentation was very elegant."

/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"There's no problem with the food per se. They do simple fish as well as anyone in the city. Perhaps, it's too simple. There are certain things about this establishment that rub me the wrong way. I had the halibut, priced at about 50$. It comes with absolutely nothing but an out of place, crudely sliced tomato on top. No side vegetables, no rice, no potato, no sautéed spinach...you get the picture. They give you a large piece of fish in a cast iron dish. Some might say it was mildly seasoned. Others might say it wasn't seasoned at all and was bland. I'm somewhere in the middle. There wasn't even a slice of lemon included to drizzle over the fish. To repeat myself, most of the food is quite good, albeit obscenely overpriced. Appetizers are basically 30 bucks each, give or take. Almost 30 dollars for the fried zucchini and eggplant that costs 16$ down the street at Philinos, 18$ at Lezvos, and 22$ at Zante. It the same dish wherever you go. We ordered a green salad which is nothing but lettuce with a few small pieces of cheese. The same magical price of almost 30 dollars. It's lettuce!!!!! Most insulting however, was the crab cake appetizer. For 30$, I was expecting a portion to split with my wife. They give you one sad crab cake about the size of an average meatball. Hey Milos, get over yourselves! But hey, if people are going to pay it, I suppose I admire their marketing strategy. You're not fooling me however. The food is achingly similar to the other restaurants I listed. Maybe people come to Milos to feel like they're on the scene? The interior is very ornate, and they feel the need to decorate to restaurant with a ridiculous amount of fresh tomatoes, other fruit and vegetables. I guess you're paying for the tomatoes you eat as well as those you don't. Does the ""freshly flown in from Greece"" line really make a difference in taste? Maybe you're paying for the food's airfare, seat selection, and checked baggage fee? Don't tell me they flew the lettuce and zucchini in from Greece too?......It's well known that if you don't want your dinner to cost the same as your monthly mortgage payment, you don't dare mess with items at the famous Milos ""Market Price"" I've heard enough nightmare anecdotes of people who go there for business dinners and get the fish cooked in sea salt. Hundreds and hundreds of dollars later, after everyone has had a few slivers of the precious fish, you can't help but feel like an idiot for falling for their dog and pony show. Newsflash: The ""Market"" is not that unpredictable. Come up with a price and be honest with people before they order. Market Price has got to be one of the most deceitful and opaque practices in the restaurant industry. Milos is certainly not alone in that regard.The food and general experience here is very pleasant, but ultimately, I cannot recommend the splurge at dinner time. I don't mind overpaying for a spectacular and unique experience. Unfortunately, you can get the same dinner at a fraction of the cost at dozens of similar restaurants in this city. They do however have a more reasonably priced lunch special which might be an interesting alternative."
/user_details?userid=NnjWR_EcNdHfV9P4qfSs8Q,Jeremiah H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Best bathrooms in town, (and the food isn't bad either). I've been wanting to go to Milos for years and it didn't disappoint, (but it's not my favourite restaurant in Montreal). As far as high end places go, you can go elsewhere for food that's more refined and ""orgasmic"". Milos seems to rely more on top-notch service and high quality basic ingredients. The fish is shockingly fresh! But of course it's not cheap. For dinner, appetizers will run you around $33 and a main course upwards of $50. Wine starts at $70. I hear lunch is cheaper. The grilled octopus with fava beans imported from Santorini is spectacular!"

/user_details?userid=1dYgBQ2-vJwQdbiN2eid4g,Sam I.,"Hawthorne, NJ",5 star rating,Seriously incredible meal at Milos.  The wait staff were so attentive and truly catered to making it an incredible dining experience!   We started with the grilled squid and the chopped salad with cucumber tomato and onion.  Both were so incredibly fresh.  We shared the lamb chop and the sea bass.  They came over to show us the piece of bass before cooking it which was really cool.  The food was absolutely divine.  It is not that expensive considering the quality of food you are being served.

I didn't realize how fancy this place was, most were dressed to impress.Even around 10ish11 it was still packed and ppl were waiting in line. Maybe it's for the banging deal of $25 for 3 course meal after 10pm. Amazing deal if you compare to their regular dining. So make reso.Service was amazing since they have a million waiters and bus boys catering to your every need. They are quick, attentive and professional.We ordered the salmon sashimi (amazing, we were loving the flavors of the ingredients. So simple and refreshing), lobster pasta (+$20, I think its charged by the pound, but wholley, huge chunks of lobster meat and the sauce was light and flavorful), whole steamed fish that's shipped from their hometown ( naturally delicious with no fishy taste, very impressed that it's $25 for a whole fish!!), and icecream and sorbet to finish (just regular, not complaining tho). Needless to say, we were stuffed and packed half of our meals to go.I recommend everyone to try this out!"

/user_details?userid=4He0DrXT6KM3lS_6quYtzQ,Sharon W.,"Miami Beach, FL",5 star rating,"Absolutely incredible! I live in Miami Beach, where there is an outpost, but had never been. I just couldn't fathom how exquisite food can be until I dined at the original. We had a noon reservation for lunch and the restaurant filled up quickly. The staff here is a tad more formal than I found at other Montreal fine dining establishments, but were happy to accommodate our fish-peeping and photo taking. We started with a dry Greek sparkling wine. I was a little hungover from the previous debauched night out, so I had just a sip and was impressed. We next had a sampling of 5 oysters from different regions in the area, ranging from PEI to Maine. They arrived on a bed of ice with all of their liquor and were fresh and delicious. Following the oysters was the grilled octopus. Unreal! It had a wood-grilled smoky flavor and was incredibly tender. We next went with the prix-fixe lunch; 3 courses for CA$25. We started with lentil soup, smoked salmon and salmon tartare. All were fresh and beautifully presented. Two in our party then had the lamb chops; two had the whole white fish and one had the tuna burger. The tuna burger was ordered solely for the side of fried zucchini and was the only miss of the day, as it was a bit dry and probably not the best way to experience fresh fish. I didn't try the lamb chops, but the fish was perfectly cooked and seasoned. A delight! We all finished with the baklava ice cream, the taste of which I can still recall!My only complaint was that the restaurant got loud. We were in a corner with poor acoustics and was also significantly warmer around our table than in the rest of the room. However, the service was impeccable and this meal was a true highlight of my Montreal trip!"

/user_details?userid=P_BsIX1h93u8lgiDXf-9CA,Andrew C.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"Came to Milos on a Thursday night around 11pm for their late night menu (available Thur to Sat 10pm-midnight). For those not from Montreal and don't have a car, the restaurant is difficult to reach via metro and easier by bus. Was seated at the bar as a single diner. Service was OK as bartender was busy fulfilling other orders. No cocktail menu.For the late night menu: for $25.16 you get a starter (salmon, salad or Greek platter) and a main (tuna burger, lobster pasta, filet mignon, dorade fish) followed by dessert (baklava or ice cream). I went with the organic salmon sashimi, filet mignon steak (was $10 extra upgrade) and baklava. The salmon sashimi was good but nothing special. The pieces were small and thin. The filet mignon was cooked to perfection (medium rare) and came with the big pieces of broccoli and perfectly oven roasted potatoes. Note portion size on both the appetizer and main were towards the smaller side. The baklava was pretty boring. For those who want to save some money and still have a nice meal, the Milos late night specials are for you. Otherwise, I would pass. The Lemeac late night menu is far better."

I just remember that the grilled octopus was very good but the steak I had was just ok. I went back Tuesday for MTL a table and it was my favorite MTL a table this year by far!By the way they don't have butter in case you don't like bread with olive oil. I however really enjoyed their olive oil and asked for more of it. Again I had the grilled octopus starter and it was just as good as I had remembered. My aunt enjoyed it too. The octopus was delicious. The grilled octopus was on a bed of onions and capers and olive oil.   The grilled lamb was amazing!!! I asked for it to be cooked medium rare. It was so juicy and salted. It came with broccoli and potatoes. My aunt had the grilled salmon. She found it was a little undercooked inside but she did ask for medium and she doesn't eat raw fish. Also one time I went with two of my friends and one of them ordered a whole fish and he kept spitting out the scales!! Scales!! OMG the horror!! Despite that I'm still giving it five stars because what I ate at Milos was fabulous. Plus it was probably an off night that one time because the last time I went I saw some people ordered a whole fish and it seemed fine...there was no scales whatsoever. Oh by the way, the wine menu consists only of Greek wine. I tried two different red wines and they weren't bad at all.For dessert I had the baklava duo. The baklava was the best I ever had. It was not too sweet at all.  AND it came with baklava ice cream! OMG so good! I never had baklava ice cream before. The restaurant is so nice.  It has two floors. When you walk in there's a nice bar. The walls are white with white curtains and Greek art. The bottom floor has walls of wine cellar. The bathrooms are so fancy and super spacious!

You don't feel any grease that's how good they are. The octopus was as fresh and good if not better than what I had seaside in Europe. The lamb was tender and perfectly seasoned.

We even hesitated to go in, wondering if the place was going to be too snobby. But, the rest of the night, hostess and wait staff was great. The food was excellent as well. The fish dish was amazing and was simple and fresh in terms of preparation. The olive oil was to die for - I mean I could buy a bottle and drink it - practically.

I know I said fried and not all of us eat fried. This one is different, the crispness and the subtle sweet taste will cover the sin.Romanesco is one of my favorite vegetable, it's like you're eating cauliflower and broccoli in one! The way they prepared this dish seem so simple and fresh with a touch of garlic, salt and pepper and yet so delicious. Key lime pie is also my favorite dessert and here they make a super smooth and creamy one and perfect crust as well. Overall, not even a tiny morsel left on the plate!"

Next was grilled octopus and grilled calamari. Both we warm and delicious. Next we went out on a limb and ordered the soft shelled crab (the last time I had this was in New Orleans and it was awesome) and Milos lived up to that memory. Crispy yet not greasy shell with warm flavourful meat inside. Definitely a must! We of course had the traditional greek salad which the best in the city. Their tomatoes and feta just seem better than everywhere else. Lastly we finished with the lobster pasta which was very good but the lobster was just a little overdone and chewy but did not take away from the wonderful taste.We shared a baklava ice cream which was amazing.

We shared many small plates (loved the Milos special, a gorgeous tower of zucchini chips) and a theatrical-looking fish cooked in a salt shell (fantastic). I don't have more words to express the quality of the food here, so just trust that it's well worth the cost!"

It was very busy since it was Formula One weekend but I think it typically a packed restaurant. The fish is amazing. I was surprised to find sashimi at a Greek restaurant but the presentation and freshness was outstanding. Helpful staff made sure we didn't over order which was greatly appreciated.

/user_details?userid=1MuPKtJ8hHI_L6cheig46g,Peter L.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,Caution. This time you can judge a book by its cover. This club like atmosphere was a turn off from first glance. It just got worse from there.. After reading the FORBES article I was intrigued so I made my way into Montreal to see what all the fuss was about. I would have been better off ordering a pizza back at the Hotel. The night starts off when we are greeted by the bartender. Hello how are you. Let me get you some menus. As I looked around me I was curious why the bartender had been touching the glass to balance the crushed ice and then he went as far to use a old bar rag to wipe the top of the mule copper ..my guess Mosk Mule. Anyway the Fish was an obvious choice. Again I was trouble by the fact that most of the staff looked as if they were working inside a rester aunt for the first time. Ok so I'm optimistic at this point. The eggplant is salted properly but in the middle lies a heap of Tziki.. oh ya this is the famous Saganaki dish. The waitress pushes the knife into the battered eggplant and says that's the good part at the bottom. So I decided to go for a walk. Below is what I saw shocked me. The meal was close to $500 and yet I've had a better meal inside a fast food Greek kiosk at most food courts. So the fish arrived and to our surprise it was the bartender who was making drinks stepped forward to fillet our fish. This is when I began to question how is this place so highly regarded in the eyes of critics and other so called epicureans. Here are some sad photos of our night.  Very disappointed. Oh lastly lots of kids waiting for tables. If you are wondering why the one star.?? The eggplant was light and perfectly seasoned. Short of that I feel so RIPPED OFF.
/user_details?userid=CWnLkmOV9drVdLfn514Q1w,Cheryl Y.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Staff: 5/5Ambiance: 5/5Food: 3/5I think I'm the only person in Montreal who's not an exceptional fan of Milos. Don't get me wrong, everything is well cooked, and the restaurant is absolutely lovely with great staff, but the food is exceptionally overpriced (appx $100/person), and mildly underwhelming.We had dishes in total: Fried Calamari, Lobster Pasta, a Greek Salad, Grill Shrimped, Charred Octopus, Fried Zucchini and Eggplant chips. But I'll break it down one by one.Entrées: The Fried Calamari was exceptional. It's lightly battered, nice amount of salt and pepper, and the freshly squeezed lemon added a dimension to the Calamari that pushed it off the edge of being subpar. I find it difficult to cook fried calamari well, and I thought Milos did a great job, and there wasn't an unpleasant rubbery texture that you find with so many other restaurants that also serve fried calamari. The Charred Octopus was cooked well. It wasn't rubbery, and it wasn't dry and that tends to be what you look for in a good octopus dish. That said, the Octopus had no flavour, and even when you mixed with the capers and the onions, it didn't really help the octopus itself. Mixed with the char on the octopus, it made a bitter vinegary taste that wasn't terrible, but just didn't stand out.I guess the same could be said about the Grilled Shrimp. The grilled shrimp comes with beans and a small micro greens salad. It's a lovely concept but neither the beans nor the shrimp had any flavour, and it was underwhelming at best.The Greek Salad was incredibly fresh, but lacked salt. Fried Zucchini and Eggplant Chips were EXCEPTIONAL. By far, my favourite part of the meal. It's not oily, has a great tzatziki sauce in the middle, and there are these fried cheeses on the side of the dish that you eat with the chip, and it's just incredible flavours and textures in your mouth. If I'm going back to Milos, I'm going back for this.The Tuna was lovely. It's cooked rare and it's everything a good tuna dish should be. Rich in flavour, it's very well done. The Lobster pasta was way too expensive for what it was. The lobster is well cooked, but there's not much of it, and the pasta is (very) lacking in flavour - especially salt, but if you add a lot of lemon, the dish becomes much more enjoyable."

For lunch you have a choice of 4 starters, 4 main courses and several desserts. I chose the salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, olives, feta cheese and olive oil. It was simple but very fresh. Fresh bread was also served with olive oil to dip. For my main, I had the whole, grilled white fish with olive oil, capers and lemon with a side of broccoli. The fish was cooked perfectly and was delicious. Slight taste of the capers and the olive oil finish brought out the flavor. The broccoli was fresh and perfectly steamed as well. To finish I had an espresso with a brown sugar cube and french yogurt with cherries- very light and a great way to end the meal. The atmosphere is great and the service was phenomenal. I plan to come back for dinner on my next trip."

The staff here are trained professionals and they take a tremendous amount of pride on making sure you have an amazing experience. If you aren't a fish lover -- this place might just give you a change of heart. The freshness of their seafood was impressive. Everything from the colossal shrimp with brandy were very tasty. Drinking the brandy out of the head, mixed with the seasoning and natural flavor of the shrimp was unlike anything I have tasted. The grilled octopus the smoky flavor and had incredible texture - these plates were cooked to perfection. Even the salt encrusted sea bass, served table side, was mindblowing -- the texture was amazing. The fish was so flaky and every bite was full of flavor. The service was on point and the bartenders looked like they were trained mixologist.  DIning at Milo's was definitely a memorable experience. The pictures just can't do the food justice. Everything we tasted was cooked and seasoned beyond belief. They have locations in Miami, New York City and Montreal. I can only imagine that the food is unbelievably incredible no matter what the location is. I plan on checking out their location in NYC - I will keep you posted."

I had been here as a child but I didn't remember it too well and was besieged by family members to return, I'm so glad I took their advice.We started with the Milos special, a tower of crispy eggplant and zucchini slices on a bed of creamy and tangy tzatziki, accompanied by four pieces of fried haloumi cheese. The haloumi was like a pungent feta, but the texture was excellent melted. The waiter saw us struggling to be proper, eating the tower with forks, and urged us to be comfortable in using our fingers. He was right, it did taste better that way.For an entree my boyfriend got the lamb chops, which were cooked and seasoned perfectly. I got the lobster pasta and it did not disappoint. There were huge chunks of lobster and the  tomato sauce had a creaminess too it, its magnificence cannot really be described beyond that.I only wish I had come with a bigger party so that we could have tasted more of the dishes, the two of us were stuffed from one appetizer and our 2 entrees."

The interior of the restaurant is beautiful and very classy, and service is amazing. They're very courteous and helpful. For lunch, there's a 3 course option for $25.15, which is so worth it. They also provide complimentary bread with olive oil from Greece, which I enjoyed very much. To start, I had the salmon tartare, which was very good and fresh. My companions had the lentil soup, tomato salad, and smoked salmon as appetizers, and they all loved their starters. We also split half a dozen of oysters, which were excellent. I had the white whole fish of the day as the main, which was Mediterannean porgie. It was simple but amazing and very fresh, and I love how they don't skimp on the portion size. For dessert, I had the baklava ice cream, which was super good. Also, random side note, their bathrooms are super nice! Super big and spacious and classy.Long story short, this place is amazing in every aspect - service, decor, food. Even if you're short on cash, go for the lunch menu! You won't regret it!"

Needless to say, this is definitely a special occasion kinda restaurant.The decor is bright and very white, yet very inviting. It's almost as if you were having a meal in one of those cute little white houses in Santorini.Service was top notch. Our waiter made great recommendations and made us feel at home despite us being the youngest table in a rather posh crowd.Food was the freshest we've ever had! The crab cake was made with crab so real that you could still taste some of the cartilage from the shell it was just in. And it was made with just crab, no filling! The fish aka the Lavraki (european seabass) had been caught only the day before... in Greece! and was baked in seasalt, requiring only a drizzle of olive oil to complement it's tender meat. Fresher than that and you might as well buy a ticket to Athens!Although none of their menu items reinvent the wheel, they bank on being the best at what they are renowned for. Which is serving a fresh and authentic Greek dining experience without having to fly you 8 hours to experience it. A truly enjoyable fine dining experience that we will look forward to repeating... at the next very special occasion!"

The Brussels sprout and beet sides were simple but exquisite. The entire dining experience is uplifting. It almost makes you question why you should eat anywhere else in town."

Even with 7 guests we enjoyed a meal that flowed thanks to the most impressive service. The task of these waiters was admirable, the layout of the restaurant is pretty cramped but somehow they navigate all of the obstacles. There was never a wasted moment for them, they are constantly fluttering around with massive dishes. Our party wanted to start with a variety of appetizers so we asked the waiter to give us the restaurant's best and we had 5 different platters to share (exquisite fried calamari, grilled octopus, greek salad, peppers, and one I am forgetting). They were very accomodating and the waiter quickly came up with which dishes to have and then a nice white wine to match. We then ordered our own main courses and I was blown out of the water by the lobster pasta. Wow, it was so rich with a healthy dose of butter and the lobster tasted delicious. To top it off, we all shared a decadent platter of fruit salad. In the US it is impossible to find strawberries as delicious as the ones we were lucky enough to have. They had a deep sweetness and tart which is rarely seen in the US. All of the other fruits were wonderful. An incredible meal and highly recommended."

We had the special zucchini and eggplant which I thought was the quintessential Greek dish. It was mesmerizing to watch as we cracked it with the spoon. I roll with a foodie bunch. Filet mignon was sooo good. Potatoes were so lemony (I like but not the others) but broccoli was just ok. Lobster pasta-lobster was good but spaghetti wasn't as sensational.

She overheard us talking about Greece and said we should go there.  Having been to Greece in the past I was looking forward to some great mediterranean flavors.  We started with a nontraditional Greek ceviche. Absolutely delicious and refreshing.  Our second course was the grilled octopus. Flavorful and beyond tender.  It was so good I thought I was back in Mykonos where I  tried it for the first time. Next was the rack of lamb. Simply done and served with roasted herb and lemon potatoes.  You couldn't ask for anything tastier. We finished with baklava ice cream. Again it was really good. Milo's is not inexpensive but it's worth every cent.  The quality of the ingredients and the attention to every detail from the staff was fantastic.  The best restaurant we dined in Montreal.

Love it when they have a nice showcase of their fresh seafood for their customers to consume!Unfortunately they seem to be slightly overcooking the fish here which is a little of a downer as I had an amazing experience in their Las Vegas location. They also serve much larger fish here so it's not as young so the meat might be little more tougher by default regardless of how well you cook it. So without this confirmation, I'll let it slip by as a minor issue.I came here 3 times within a week that's how much of a fan I am. Items ordered:Appetizers:Crab cake - very delicious and highly recommend it; just wished they would serve more crab cakes for that price! It was served with a spicy mayo sauce which goes perfectly with their crabGrilled Octopus - very delicious as well and highly recommend it but maybe I was either sick of eating it but the 2nd time I ordered this it wasn't as good tasting and didn't seem quite as fresh as the first time. It was a little more tougher than usual and the color didn't seem as fresh. Hopefully i would not repeat the same issue in my future visits next time I'm in townGrilled Lavraki - very delicious fish but wished they served smaller portions like the Las Vegas location. Meat was tougher than usually so I would probably still reserve my Lavraki cravings at the Las Vegas locationHalibut - this was supposedly the best fish dish in Montreal but I wasn't so impressed with this one. Halibut is a very delicate fish and can easily be overcooked even by the finest restaurants and unfortunately it was overcooked here as well. Nothing is worse than a tough texture especially with Halibut. Halibut is too expensive and prone to being overcooked that I would not order Halibut in restaurants often. So for that reason, I would not really recommend ordering this.Lobster pasta - this was amazing. I saw them actually take out the 1.5lb of fresh whole Maine lobster from their tanks to make this dish. Usually restaurants don't serve fresh whole Maine lobsters and just serve frozen Lobster tails but they did not disappoint. They even provided the claw meat which was awesome! I usually prefer lighter Lobsters as it's usually more flavorful and the meat isn't as tough. Wanted to order just the Lobster but they said minimum weight would be about 3-4 lbs which is too heavy/old of a Lobster for me. Their pasta was perfectly cooked ""al dente"" and their tomato sauce was the bomb. I wished they would sell it in retail or something as I'd buy their tomato sauce in a heartbeat!Probably the best seafood restaurant in Montreal and definitely recommend giving this place a try but be warned, it'll cost you! They have free valet parking as well which is a nice plus as usually it's hard to find parking in that part of town."

The restaurant itself is beautiful.  Clean and Greek without being tacky and blue and white stripes w/gold gilded statues.  The servers really are knowledgeable and professional to a T.  The late night menu, which is only $29 is a STEAL.  After 10pm, you'll get a started, main and dessert.  (During normal dinner hours, appetizers can be as much as $29 apiece!  Or at least that's what I saw for the eggplant app.) The food is beyond fresh-- that can't be disputed.  What can, is the seasoning.  The fish was clean and perfectly prepared...but lacked even the most basic SALT.  The filet was perfectly cooked, but again, it seemed not to be aged properly, or was missing flavor.  A steamed broccoli/cauliflower accompaniment isn't good contrast to food so bland. The appetizers were better-- the spreads, all delicious, the tomato salad surprisingly flavorful.  What went wrong, I don't know.  Would I try it again?  Well...maybe the late night menu or lunch...but if I paid any more for what we got, I'd be angry!"

We had to ask for these again mid way through our salad & appetizers.  The waiter says, someone was supposed to bring them to you. Really?So we finish drinks, salad & appetizers and the we sit there, waiting, waiting, waiting & waiting for ONE HOUR for our lobster.  What are we supposed to do with no food or drink in front of us in a restaurant for an hour?  After a good forty five minutes, I catch the waiters eye and he says, Its taking too long, right?  DUH YEAH.  So he goes and checks and says it will be right out.  Another fifteen minutes till the crustacean appears.  We should have left the restaurant but we didn't.  Then the lobster wasn't even that great.We order dessert and one coffee.  Not even a mention of ""The dessert and coffee is on us. Sorry about the long wait."" NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM ANYONE! Our bill comes  and it is $283 before the tip.  My husband, who is a gentleman tips this guy 20% and we leave!  We were on vacation and we were very relaxed and in a great frame of mind.  Otherwise,I would have never kept silent about the service that evening  We just didn't want to get into a hassle and ruin our mood.But really, this was really absurd for a restaurant of this calibre.  I will be curious if anyone responds to us here on Yelp from the restaurant,"

Salmon was terrific wine was good as well not a bad meal but for cost I would expect the food to be handled perfectly. It's a good place to drop in and I will return because of the service but not happy with raw fish! Crab cake was good as well just a bit small. So I give it a 3.5 but yelp won't allow that. I think the prices could come down a bit. My one bad experience should not hold you back from trying this poshy place!
/user_details?userid=6lELxb5duHs0u9C0oNkXtw,Farah S.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,Good food but can be found in some other great Greek restos in montreal to more or less same level. So when one goes to a resto of this caliber it is not merely for the food but also for the service and the whole dining experience. In fact the service becomes even more important than the food when you pay such high prices. In our recent visit when we took a guest our experience was really not good. My husband's steak arrived after we had almost finished eating our fish. At first we kept waiting as the waiter kept saying few more minutes but then we reluctantly started eating our dish which was smart because his meal arrived when we were done. You can imagine how unpleasant this was at 400$ plus for 3 people. Milos waiter could have still saved this bad dinning moment for us by merely offering a simple coffee on the house but he just pretended all was normal. Is his attitude a representative of the establishment ? We all know things can happen in a busy resto and even the most organized establishments can make mistakes but it is how you train your staff to deal with it that keeps your customers coming back. We def. will no longer go back.

The place was full! Our waiter started us out with some bread with fresh oregano. Yum! I had the grilled octopus which was amazingly good. Then had the lamb chops. I felt the lamb chops we're a bit oversalted. However, they were cooked nicely. Their specialty cocktails on the menu are fun to try. I would definately come back! It is a bit on the fancier side, so this is a perfect restaurant for a special occasion or a birthday."

I came here twice; the first time was for lunch and the food was good, but not extraordinary.  The second time was for dinner and I ordered the shrimp. The dish was 40$ and all they did was grill the shrimp and give me a lot of salad. I would have expected for that price they would do something to the shrimp, but they just grilled it. I understand that the seafood is known to be fresh, but they seem to use that as an excuse to not bother putting much effort in making the dish.  That dish was by far the biggest disappointment because they didn't even bother trying. There are much better restaurants in Montreal with better service and better food that are in the same price range."
/user_details?userid=grMckaez8Qx2Svop4pehqQ,Aaron L.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"When I think of Milos it brings me back to the décor of the restaurant in which the nautical theme matches their menu. Milos is an institution, whether it is the location in Miami or in Montreal, both are exquisite. I was most recently in the Athens location which caught my attention because it did not have the typical style of an upscale restaurant. Instead the waiter with a pleasant decorum came over to the table, like an old friend, and asked what we wanted out of the meal. We started off with a cevice made fresh from a fish that we picked at their pseudo-fish market at the front. We then moved on to a wonderful Greek salad and finished off with fish done two different ways. This meal was perfection because the chef really lets the ingredients shine. My favorite thing to eat at any milos location is the Barbooni which is fried whole and the bones turn to a liquid and you can eat the entire fish. This restaurant has provided some of my favorite dining experiences due to the wonderful ambiance and even better food. It is always a treat when I get to return to Milos and I cannot wait for my next visit, until next time!"

I was almost dreading going to a nicer place this evening given that I was in a cocktail dress and rocking Sorels thanks to the snowfall earlier that day, but the hostess happily checked my furry boots so that I could change into my heels before being seated.The fresh baked bread was tasty as was the wine we picked (didn't go for the Greek selection, just couldn't do it!) I had the big eye tuna which was done sashimi-style. It was hands down the best fish I have had in Montreal: fresh, cooked just right and melted in my mouth. The beet variety on the side was oh so tasty as were the greens.The service was friendly, fast and knowledgeable and my galaktoboureko for dessert was wonderful (although I would suggest sharing it given that it was the size of my head) I will definitely be back as I saw a waiter walk by with a tower of tempura that practically had my name on it, YUM!"

We've been fans of this restaurant for decades, however, things appear to be changing. We look forward to the Milo's salad and the Greek toasted bread before the feast. Last week we noticed the previously amazing Milos salad was not flavourful and the bread was a sliced tasteless untoasted French bread to go  with the olive oil.  When we inquired, we were told that Milos is modifying their recipes to create uniformity if it's new foreign chain restaurants.  The Montreal Milo's is the original and by far there was always a noticeable difference in the quality of some of the dishes compared to Vegas and New York.   We hope that Milos can be persuaded to revert to their original lighter and tasty bread, which works perfectly with olive oil and decides to add their amazing wine vinegar back to the salad. The vegetables are lacking flavour due to the reduction of artistic blending of what has always been amazing. In summary, if it's not broken don't try to fix it."

Mediterranean sea bass, served with olive oil lemon sauce. Best fish I've ever tasted. But really I'm writing this review for the service. They were amazing. I think our waiter is called ""Jerry,"" and he knew everything about everything. The waitstaff worked together on all the tables, and they seem really well-coordinated, and very concerned about not allowing us to keep our plates between courses. Once, someone even took our plates and exchanged them for new ones even though we hadn't used those ones for anything yet. Ha. I liked all of that a lot. Thank you Milos!"

If you come after 10 PM, they have a prefix menu that has an appetizer, entry, and desert for about 20 bucks. (A few of the dishes are an extra $15) I got the lobster pasta which was an extra $15. It was good, my only complaint was the sauce they used . The lobster pieces were big and delicious but the sauce had a bit of a weird taste to it (it was sweet).Overall had a great experience, and will defiantly be back here when I'm in Montreal.

I recall vividly the first time I dined here, everything I ate, everything I drank ... I'd venture to guess that in 5yrs you'd remember your meal and your experience here too.  This is what Milos is known for really . The facade is quite subdued, you could pass it easily and not realize it. Inside the atmosphere is more semi-formal than casual and modern but its also very comfortable. The rooms are spacious and typically filled with people and conversation. I really like the flow of the restaurant and the waitstaff is excellent, professional, friendly and helpful ... never an empty glass of wine or water.   I don't think you can go wrong ordering anything on the menu but I highly recommend the crab cake, its still the best I've ever had. I love the grilled sardines as well. I also recommend getting a whole fish, which you can select from the case and have prepared baked in sea salt and presented at your table and savor that moment when a group of men present you with a large platter of excellence. All of the food here is top notch really, if I could afford it I'd dine here much more often. Milos is the kind of place you need to treat yourself to, go in willing and able to indulge in it 100% and recover later."

/user_details?userid=e1sXJhBh8PEW_3uwtFL_dw,Miryam H.,"Philadelphia, PA",3 star rating,"Good late night dinner special. The first hiccup is that Milos is under renovations and has relocated to Cava down the street. We booked our reservation online and are from out of town so this caused a bit of confusion before dinner. We upgraded the late night dinner special to the lobster and steak options. My plate: the lobster spaghetti was delicious. The pasta was plentiful and creamy. The lobster meat was nicely placed over the pasta and the shell was left just as decor. What a great bonus because the last thing you want to do is get all messy for your food on date night! My husband's steak, however, was very small. It tasted great but the portion size was a surprise since it comes with an extra charge. We expected much more for the extra money. Our biggest complaint has to do with our server. We were left unattended for most of our meal: water glasses and wine glasses were left empty for 10-15 minutes at a time. Even our plates were set and removed by other wait staff. Each time we needed something: bread, water or wine, my husband had to ask another server. Never mind having our server come to our table to ask about our meal! The last time my husband actually had to go to the manager standing by the bar to inform him. Constantly waiting or asking for service is very disruptive to any dinner experience. I must say that the manager gave us a glass of wine for our trouble and it was a nice gesture. Also that the experience with our waiter would've ruined our dinner if it wasn't for the rest of the wait staff. Everyone else was friendly and attentive to our table. Can't say we'll be back even though the food is delicious because we don't want to risk the same poor service. Plus the patrons are definitely older - with a few young people scattered around the restaraunt."

This is the most we ever spent in a restaurant in Montreal and the food was nowhere as remarkable as some other places. Perhaps coming here for lunch is a better idea. Also, this placed seemed targeted for older patrons so it's not hip and trendy, but more classy."
/user_details?userid=fE5No_XpMvV5n5l2YKSnSA,Sam A.,"Los Angeles, CA",3 star rating,"Well, here is why Milos Montreal is getting 3 stars. They made us wait for a long time and the halibut was very bland. We are visiting from Los Angeles and decided to have dinner at Milos last night. I called around 7pm for a reservation for 3 people (2 adults and a 9 year old), and I was told that they can accommodate us for 9:00pm. I wish they had just told us that they were fully booked. We took Uber and arrived at the restaurant around 8:55. Upon arrival, we were told that our table will be ready in 2-3 minutes, but we weren't seated until about 9:35pm. Since we had a 9 year old with us, we just stood in the small hallway, instead of sitting at the bar that was almost full. They did apologize around 9:20pm and invited us to sit at the bar that had 1 customer left, and served us a delicious Meze plate around 9:25pm. Unfortunately, by this time I was already extremely agitated. The restaurant is very clean and VERY nicely decorated. Service is good. Most diners were regulars out with their families, and most of them seem to know each other. The waiters were very friendly with the regulars, which was nice to see. We got the octopus=excellent. The crab cake was good. The lamb chops were great, so was the lobster pasta, however, not sure what happened to my halibut. Sadly, it had no taste at all. The key lime pie was good, but the greek coffee they served tasted horrible. I drink greek coffee regularly, so the taste is nothing new to me. This coffee was so bad, I barley finished half of it. So sad that my Milos Montreal experience took a negative turn."

Both times I was wowed by the outstanding fresh seafood. For the appetizer we had the crab cake which we were told was made up of 95% crab meat. It was amazingly sweet. For the main course we had a grilled Mediterranean snapper (Balada) selected from the fresh fish bar. Drizzled with olive oil, light herbs and a dash of lemon, it was tender and flavorful - quite unforgettable. However, note that it's $45/lb so the dish cost $67 for a 1.5 lb fish. I haven't tried other similar Mediterranean restaurants, so I can't assess if this is considered the going rate. Service was prompt despite the restaurant being crowded on a holiday evening. There were ample waiters going around filling up glasses and clearing the plates. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the items on the menu, and gave a thorough introduction of the fish at the fresh fish bar. Decor of the restaurant was tasteful and provides a warm atmosphere for dining - whether you're on a date, going with your family, or dining with business associates.

Wine selection is 100% greek, so I needed some recommendations from the waiter, but he was great in steering us through the by-the-glass selections for our starter and entree courses.For desert, my friend had house-made baklava, and I had fresh greek yogurt drizzled with thyme honey.  We complemented this with fresh-leaved mint tea and a greek coffee.Again, simple, fresh, quality."

An OMG dish.- ""The best crab cakes in town,"" claimed one server. And they were quite delicious. - Charcoal grilled shrimp - Grilled lamb chops- Filet mignon- White fish, served simply with olive oil - Salad with feta and tomatoes Even my grandma, who HATES Greek food, thought this was the best meal of the wedding weekend.

But how can you mess with perfection? Milo's does the best Greek salad in Montreal! ...no discussion. Roll that in with these guys sourcing such flavorful tomatoes in May in Canada...! Grilled octopus was tender, flavored with the smoke of a real grill. No toughness at all. Oh, did I mention the Milo's Special? We ordered that first of all. It was a tasty combination of eggplant and zucchini slices, lightly fried with a couple pieces of cheese and taziki sauce: perfect for nibbling while the conversation winds up. Salted fish is a specialty...for a reason. The product was brought to the table and broken out of its salt, with much ceremony, right in front of you. Service was exemplary. Plates and silver changed between each course, table expertly 'crumbed' before dessert and coffee...you just don't see that enough anymore. Staff was professional, approachable, knowledgable. Presentation was attractive and artistic. Food was awesome!"
/user_details?userid=74sHYKCo_j4m8qtrWI9aLA,Kevin K.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Milos Montreal, owned by Costas Spiliadis of Estiatorio Milos in Manhattan, is currently in the charge of renowned Italian chef Franca Mazza, previously at Little Italy's Il Mulino.  A Greek meal cooked by an Italian in Montreal! It seemed out of place but it would have to do.  And the suggestion, purloined by a couple visiting New York from Montreal, was worth every bite.Spiliadis has taken it upon himself to elevate the status of Greek cuisine, which is commonly associated with gyros lathered in oily tzatziki, salty Greek salads with cheap feta and olives and syrupy baklava that cloys to one's molars.  Many Greek restaurants eschew Greek for the more common appellation of Mediterranean--hardly a sin, but telling.  A quick inspection of the catch, and the total absence of fishy smell, iced on display in front of the open kitchen reassures diners that the prices for this lesser esteemed cuisine is justified.  If not altogether charitable.  If people are uncertain of how Greek food can be, they need to talk to Mr. Spiliadis at one of his restaurants. Milos serves family style meals: whole groupers that feed five, enormous salads that waiters plate at your tableside, and bountiful sides such as baked beets or greens.  The two of us, unable to fully enjoy such a feast chose the five-course tasting menu and a bottle of highly recommended 2005 Assyrtico (Areti, Ktima Biblia Chora) over an Alsatian Riesling.  Greek wine is not as various as Italian or French, but this bottle worked throughout the meal.While we waited for our meal to begin, we munched on hearty bread that steeled our appetites and warmed us--the walk from the subway to the restaurant was much further than our map portended.  We noted the success with which the rustic/chic interiors had been designed and the crisp, formal (if not old-fashioned) service of the staff (my fiancé was excluded from almost all decisions and questions).  We sat at wide, spacious tables that were stationed at comfortable intervals or pushed together for large families.  The floors were a matted brown, which offset the formal white, and the fish, imported foodstuffs and ironwork reminded me of the taverna tradition.The first course arrived.  Grilled octopus atop thinly sliced, raw onions. Portioned into medallions, the octopus was nicely charred but still tender and sprinkled with sea salt and olive oil.  Filling the plate were grilled oyster mushrooms and colorful peppers whose tender flesh resonated with grass and straw flavors that met balsamic and olive oil directly.  The onions provided a crunch that balanced the dish.Quietly, the plates were taken away and we were presented with a more ambitious course: grilled shrimp on lemongrass skewers with the fixings of a Greek salad.  The shrimp were delicately imbued with the citrus notes of the lemongrass and quite succulent.  The Greek salad was comprised of tomatoes, which were a bit flavorless, a bring feta and olives arranged to fill the remaining space of the plate but offering little else to the shrimp.  This dish was the least impressive of all.  The attempt to reinvigorate the Greek salad came off as unimaginative, forced. The crab cake that Milos boasts as ""famous"" followed.  Actually, it contained a meaty lump of crab meat spiced with something not unlike Old Bay, and slices of calamari served after prolonged boiling and a quick trip to the grill.  The crab cake was bound almost wholly by meat and was not over-breaded or mealy.  The nod to Old Bay was charming, appropriate and delicious.  Having nearly filled ourselves with crustaceans and mollusks, we patiently waited for our entrees.  I was moving inland, hoping for the arrival of lamb chops and fries.  My fiancé had ordered a dish of grilled salmon and beets.I am not a fan of salmon, having eaten too much of it when it was the only fish my mother allowed in the house, so leaving the sea was an easy choice--even at a seafood restaurant.  My risk was rewarded.  The chops were rubbed with salt and rosemary, grilled to medium and served with crisp fries sprinkled in sea salt.  The salmon, however, was the superior dish.  As fresh a piece of fish as I had ever seen upon a plate, the flesh was firm, a beautiful hue and cooked with care.  An undisturbed surface yielded to glassy meat in the center.  A side of beets gave the dish weight and the deeper hues emphasized the appealing appearance of the fish.By the time dessert arrived we were ready to loosen our belts.  Knowing full well that we would be wondering through a city of French pastries, a plate of baklava seemed superfluous.  But our server insisted and I added a cup of Turkish coffee to the bill.  The baklava was as flaky and light as my mother's, but prepared with honey it surpassed her recipe.  It was topped with crushed pistachios and fresh strawberries that were surprisingly tasty."

/user_details?userid=Vp_C7oIxeztbd2PchNBOHw,D A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Much of what makes Cava such an amazing restaurant is applicable to Milos, which is obvious to many since the owner is one and the same. The flagbearing quality that sets this place apart from others is the impeccable service, practically white glove. Waitstaff ooze class - they are literally there to make your dinner experience as top notch as possible, and will focus on the little details like pulling your chair out for you and swapping your utensils without you noticing. The ambience is really spectacular - it's light, whitewashed, and vaguely resembles a cycladic landscape. The feeling is very comfortable and very unique, especially for a city that's quagmired in snow and darkness for half the year. The food is very good - simple, honest, predictable dishes that have been honed to a high standard. The fish is simple and fresh. The salads feature tomatoes that don't taste like tofu chunks, quite the feat in Montreal. Everything has this light airy feeling to it, almost like you're sampling all night. Nothing on the menu will break the mold, and if you're looking to get knocked off your feet by some stroke of culinary genius in the kitchen, forget it. Like all smart businesses, they stick to what they do best, which is why the restaurant is so popular. And, btw, not nearly as expensive as some people think. Enjoy!"

We couldn't decide whether to get the tomato or green salad as appetizer and when we mentioned this to the waiter, he let us have half-half so we get the best of both! Both salads were delicious and fresh! For the main meal (or entree), we decided to get the halibut Mediterranean style to split between the two of us. The waiter also recommended additional vegetable on the side (asparagus in our case) to compliment the fish and made it a full meal for both of us. The halibut was magnificent! It was fresh, perfectly cooked, moist and great taste! Even the asparagus was also cooked wonderfully, not too hard and not too soft. This place is simply a gem!

The fish chosen from a selection not seen in North America is cooked perfectly in my favorite way and that is salt crusted and baked now I know that most of you will disagree and opt for the BBQ method but you must try this at least once in your life just so that you can experience pure bliss in harmony between Man and the Sea. I can go on and tell you how great the crab cakes and Greek salad,octopus and of course their zucchini fries are but I recommend that you visit this restaurant so that you can concur with us mortal souls who feel that those who have not visited have been denied a little of what the Greek Gods meant for the World to experience."

Our orders did not come out as requested, this as a result of our waiter simply not putting the order in properly. He never came by to ask about water or more wine. We had to ask a busboy close by.

Estiatorio Milos could help you if you have that kind of dilemma. If you or/and your friend(s) like seafood and want to experience luxury dining, Milos offers various choices of seafood. Fresh fishes are just flown from Mediterranean and North-American sea. Be sure to take the tour to select your own fish(s). Each fish you selected will give you the amazing and unique taste that Milos can offer. * Service: Excellent (a bit slow for who has not been experienced European dinning) * Price: Pricy as all high-end restaurants would (be sure to ask price prior to complete your order if you are in doubt or want to stay in your budget) * Atmosphere: Excellent * Food Quality: Superb and great wine selections as well. * Parking: Valet parking is available or parking nearby the street (Metro is nearby and you can use public transportation if possible) * Avoid factor: Do not order too many dishes which one fish may be more than enough for two people and you still can have the great dining experience at Milos. If you want to dine there for once in a lifetime deal, you may not want to order expensive wine (either a glass or a bottle) along with your main dish.

Ask for Theodoro:)  I thought he must be a partner in the restaurant because his enthusiasm, personality, and passion for what he was doing that night were really something to experience. We started off with a personal tour of what was being served fresh that night right in front of the kitchen, where all the fish and seafood were on ice. We were given a brief description of what each fish was, and how it could be prepared. A completely cool start to a wonderful dining/eating experience. We were then presented with house olive oil, with literally, fresh snipped oregano, (the server snipped oregano off of little plants into the dishes at our table) and a basket of grilled bread, which was amazing.  We started off with the grilled sardines which were robust, as they should be and served whole, with fresh lemon.  we also ordered the Milos Special: paper thin zucchini, eggplant and saganaki cheese lightly fried, served with tzatziki.  the presentation was beautiful, and unique, and very resourceful, as the waiter dismantled the pyramid at the table which allowed evryone to grab some crunchy fried vegetable goodness, and tzatziki-see pic.  also, saganaki cheese?  hello.  That's like the cheese of the gods.   We then got the tomato salad which is the classic greek horiatki, served family style.  I should mention, that the menu is designed for everything to be shared, as it invites a communal vibe, as you would feel if you were eating at someone's table at home-it was a nice touch, but you might want to order two of something you like if you have a big party, like we did.  I was the last in line, but that was just the luck of the draw.  I sampled the lamb, which was wonderful, but the restaurant specializes in seafood, so I went with the grilled whole fish, which you can also get salt encrusted and roasted, which looked pretty spectacular.  The fish is some of the freshest I've had and really changed the way I will eat fish from this point on-seriously life changing. it was grilled whole and filleted table side and served with lemon and a drizzle of olive oil. Simple, yes, but a total culinary knockout.  Another spectacular dish was the fresh linguini and Lobster pasta dish.  The pasta was perfectly al dente and coated in a flavourful rih tomato sauce with huge chunks of lobster meat from an entire lobster. Unbelievably good.  Of course, the desserts were off the charts good, baklava, loukoumades, and my favorite, galaktoboureko; vanilla custard in honey drenched filo dough-the espresso was pretty wonderful as well.  Milos specializes in seafood, but they let us know that their sister restaurant Cava is their version of the Greek steakhouse, with specialties from the mainland, and our waiter described it as a place whee they serve thick cuts of beef, and lamb with big fiery red wines-sounds like it's worth another trip to Montreal."
