/user_details?userid=7Yv44diO5hwQb0SYa8TpVg,Michel M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Another marvelous meal today !A light seafood broth with a hint of fresh mint smoothes your palate for the delicacies to come ...The delicacy this time were sweetbreads flambé. How to describe these tender morsels with a slightly crunchy crust in a smooth creamy sauce ? Exceptional !!!

Good quality though portions are a bit too large - they harm my afternoon productivity!!! Guess I should have discipline to pack up leftovers ;-) Looking forward to trying this place for dinner as well.

The service was awesome and the decor is warm and quaint. The food was delicious. They serve mainly seafood but have other selections as well. Get the half baked cookie for dessert!

The ingredients are of good quality. We ordered the octopus, chorizo, mussels as appetizers and they were all very satisfying. The main dishes are well seasoned and the portions are perfect.I'd suggest the typical Portuguese dessert served in a verrine - exquisite.Their wine list is short, but definitely delivers.Service : our waitress was very attentive and took good care of us. Service was A+Decor : very simple and modern. Friendly-romantic atmosphere This place is appropriate for both small and large groups."

/user_details?userid=_fmzfJ1ouRpzpTAxjyzZSA,Gerard B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Ended up going to Boca Ibercia by chance. Waiter was always there to serve...he was exceptionally friendly and recommended a red wine that turned out to be fantastic. we decided to go with a few tapas instead of ordering main dishes super great idea the octopus was very very good and tender the rapini was fantastic and the stuffed calmar was nice. the atmosphere was very friendly and deafened we will be paying another visit  to Boca Ibercia. I recommend the restaurant and there's a nice terrace.
