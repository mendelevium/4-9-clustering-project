/user_details?userid=TrNYRbz0zr7kTsVFB4uw5w,Vanisha S.,"Oakville, Canada",4 star rating,Be prepared to wait. It's a pretty busy place with a full awesome breakfast menu. The variety is is awesome but getting a table can be a wait. From the time you order to receiving your food be prepared to wait 20-25mins... they serve some awesome milkshakes to keep you entertained. Servings are a good proportion if not more than you can imagine but cleanliness is key and plate layout too
/user_details?userid=Fae_znodNFsEH1HQFz4OiQ,Maike E.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"This is a nice breakfast spot with an extensive menu. We spent about 15 mins just trying to figure out what to get! Fresh, modern interiors and popular when we went on a Sat morning. By about 9.15 the place fills up. Everything we had was tasty enough, just not spectacular. I had a patatas meal with an omlette style egg on top and plenty of cheese melted on top. I was expecting the potatos to be a bit crispy, like it looks in the photo, but they weren't. The kids meals are practically a full sized serving, so that was impressive. It appears to be a chain cafe. I also had a milkshake with a shot of espresso which was good enough. Over all a decent place to have breakfast. Oh and the service was super friendly!"

I'm not a big fan of Eggs Benedict in general but I have to say this dish changed my mind.I was able to replace the fruit with bacon at no charge - bonus pointsThe staff was super friendly, the restaurant itself was bright and clean with a hip feel to it.This location has only been open a couple of months."

I had the ""Jean-Louis en Espagne"" smoothie and the Portuguese eggs Benedict.The smoothie came out first and was wonderful, I quickly inhaled it, knowing that it would never survive to my meal. Totally worth it.My Eggs Benedict was fantastic, the flavor was amazing and if I could, I would come here almost daily. If only I didn't live in California!This is a great place and I highly recommend it. Try one of their Breakfast Macs. A large number of locals ordered them while I had my meal and they looked great."
/user_details?userid=xp9UEkFyz7h7Ii1XVzU4tA,Chad T.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"A great option for breakfast. They have nice options if everything. Omelettes, sweet and savory crepes, plus an entire menu of 20+ variations of eggs Benedict. We went for the duck confit benedict, some day I'd like to come back and try the Montreal smoked meat Benedict.As far as the Oreo milkshakes go, it was more milky than the kind of thick milkshake I'm used to so I don't know if that was a case of mismatched expectations, though it was delicious."

Nice menu with lots of breakfast and some lunch options. Good presentation on plate, taste is great, good portion size, surprisingly fast service considering how nice the presentation is. Nice ambience, this location only opened 3 months ago. Oh, and Lavazza cafe!!"
/user_details?userid=lDLfwTOCkMwB5PFBChlJFQ,Bob E.,"Miami, FL",5 star rating,What a cool and unusual breakfast place. They had Poutines but I didn't know what that was so I got the eggs Benedict. Fresh squeezed orange juice. So much for eating a light breakfast but it was worth it. It was very early in the morning but there were a few people. Service was great!
/user_details?userid=FDIYCoihjsGCcDqpk0Vglw,Mrs. J.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,If you're looking for a good breakfast this place will be a good option. You will have to wait most likely. It was very busy when we went and the hostess barely had time to 'host' because she was tasked with a lot of other jobs. It was a wait in line till they get to you type situation but everyone was polite and wanted to get you seated asap. I had read other reviews that made it seem like the food was going to be great but I'd say it's pretty average in the sense that it was good but not something I'll remember. I had a breakfast poutine that quickly extinguished the hunger pangs I had. A Nutella and banana waffle was good and had just the right amount of Nutella for a sweet treat to go along with the savory items.
/user_details?userid=Eqk0ppInDgtFSuBjbchfmQ,Tina L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,Placed order after 59min wait out  order was still not out . Asked server what was the hold up . Lack of staff or anything was told no all is staff is in . It's a new place and everyone came in at the same time (lunch time ) . That was the explanation and nothing was compensated on the bill for the wait. Avoid at all cost. Food was average . Menu has too many option for the kitchen to handle . They were coming out 2 plates at a time. Every table had to wait a long wait. If I could have given no stars I would have.
/user_details?userid=daUCn67uVrhwWUT75_iofA,John H.,"Buford, GA",5 star rating,at this place for breakfast on a recent trip to Montreal the menu is incredible both my wife and I really enjoyed what we got. I got a chorizo omelette accompanied by fruit and potatoes and the house bread toasted. Everything was great would definitely go our only regret was discovering this place late in the trip so we didn't have the opportunity to go back.

Great atmosphere and friendly service.  The menu is like a short novel... it takes a bit to go through. Too many choices, if that's possible. Food was good."
/user_details?userid=YsVDZfnbbmpa73ikxgVF5Q,Daniel B.,"San Antonio, TX",4 star rating,Nice place for breakfast. The pictures of the food are accurate. I just found a review which included a picture..it came out as seen and was tasty. I would come here again.
/user_details?userid=2HuVzd4c-0HAN__SQGQvVA,Gerry C.,"Grande Prairie, Canada",4 star rating,"Stumbled upon this place while searching for a brunch place before a Habs game. Was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere of the place. Staff was great, even for having to deal with two non-French speaking patrons. Try the espresso milkshakes. Worth the visit alone! Cheers"
/user_details?userid=CzwrKdi8pwLkLQHMR9XELg,Darcy Y.,"Grande Prairie, Canada",5 star rating,I visited Montreal for the first time and tried this restaurant for breakfast. It is one of the best breakfast establishments I have been to. The decor is simple but tasteful. The servers are fantastic. The food is what kept me coming back for the next 4 mornings in a row. I would eat here everyday if it were possible.
/user_details?userid=_6weUVLeCYkUI7S534UPVA,Maggie E.,"Lake George, NY",4 star rating,"We were apprehensive going in because the menu outside had no prices listed and it was a little on the pricey side. However, the portions were huge and easily splittable. The breakfast poutine was amazing and the coffee was not given sparingly. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the restaurant was clean and obviously hip."
/user_details?userid=f3ovUvW3Z7gxWRasL-dupg,Lyndsay R.,"Rothesay, Canada",5 star rating,Food was great and portions are huge! We were there for breakfast and weren't hungry again until suppertime. The owner?/manager? was very present and accommodating during our visit. Would definitely return!
