Ex-Tapeo folks, they're cookin' up healthy, creative, colourful dishes with fresh ingredients. Poke Bowls, salads, sandwiches & anything on the menu is good even the coffee! Right on Mt. Royal, the decor is nice, staff is friendly, & parking is a mess, but the food... oh Jacky! Jacky loves ""La Poke Moi"" & the brunch on weekends is great. Prices are 100% worth it & Jacky is calling it a JEM. Don't just try them, visit often!Follow @JackyEatsMTL"

I keep ordering this burger over and over-- the cabbage and spicy mayo on top are so good! I've also had the breakfast bowl and it's very filling and has a great combination of flavors. Everything always tastes very fresh and REAL, which is the most important thing to me if I'm going to eat food that I have not made myself."
/user_details?userid=GbDfPbqp7gKRwbn116KDSA,Ben K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Close to perfection.I ordered the fried chicken sandwich (La bête) and the potato croquettes on the side.There must be a pathological slovenliness which accompanied a fast order restaurant and a deep fat fryer to just HAMMER the  out of food. Such travesties, one shan't find here. Perfectly done fried chicken, moist and tender on the inside, crispy, light and well seasoned on the outside. Creamy red cabbage slaw, well dressed, with just the right hits of brightness and acidity. Croquettes were perfectly cooked, like the dreamy Caucasian cousin of a pakora you had only friended in FB but never met in person until now.The price point is rather high, ($12 for a sammich??) but it's totally worth. Straight onto my faves lis"

Fried Chicken Sandwich - perfect combo of sweet and salty with a nice crunch from the cabbage. Poke - I could eat this every day. Simple quinoa poke with great flavor. The seeds (sunflower and pumpkin I believe) were a great addition. ""Breakfast Potatoes"" - these are actually mini latkes in a dill sour cream sauce. Wayyyy better than breakfast potatoes. The icing on the cake for this place is the two guys who own it.  Super welcoming and friendly.  They make you feel right at home."

I always feel super stuffed all day after eating it since it's so filling.I've ordered this same salad 3 times and still can't remember it's name lolGlad they let me switch the lettuce for kale, cause the fk I care about lettuce when paying this much lol. I also got to switch the carrots for beets too ^_^ That was nice, I wonder what else they've got.The tuna is a nice touch. I like how it's raw in the middle, cooked outside and covered in sesame seeds ^_^Pickled ginger slices, cucumber, avocado, tempura crunchy bits, and wasabe-no-idea-ness? Hey, it's a nice substituion when you like sushi ^_^ I really liked what they did with the sunflower seeds.Some sort of green beans, can't tell if it's soy or edame, but it's nice.So, I finally get to try quinoa and I like it a lot ^_^Their creamy dresing is also nice.I like how the salad is not mixed. Everything is separated so you get to control the balance of every bite. I know I should try their other salads, but it's hard for me to venture away from something I like a lot xpI like their coffees. Not super expenive or small and really nice/flavorful.I did get the chance to try one of their smoothies: Banana expresso! And it was soooooo good :)The restaurant itself looks like ... a little girls bedroom lol I mean it is very cute, not cluttered, small and clean. I wouldn't change anything. I just find it funny to see a place like that, but all the staff are these big muscular tall cute men lol fkn hipsters, right? lol. Unexpected, but it's fine the way it is."

They have a solid set of lunch options, with tartines and sandwiches and salads, and they also have some baked goods up at the counter. All the food was fresh, delicious, and quick. I had L'Avocat, and it was absolutely amazing. I was very pleasantly surprised. The coffee was excellent as well, thought i didn't manage to get a snap of either because i scarfed it down immediately. Both guys at the counter were friendly, kind, thoughtful and courteous. The place is very clean and the ambiance is lovely. Has free wifi. Very very cute modern place. Will be back often!!!"
