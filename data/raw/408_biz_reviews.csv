/user_details?userid=HZ-nuSEVDQa_g6B-3_BB9Q,Nick C.,"Northampton, MA",5 star rating,"Very grateful and surprised to find this excellent place on the otherwise depressing collection of blocks of rue  st Hubert, which in some blocks is filled with dollar stores and knick knack shops and other crappy retail stores. After being ignored waiting to get a table at Isle de Garde we walked around the area and found this place. We were looking for simple, quick, affordable and this met everything we needed. We had the duck burger, croquet Monsieur and mac and cheese. Drinks were a very good cider and a flight of beer. The drink selection is excellent and the food was very good. Staff were friendly and prices were decent."

Instead of drinking like one does at a bar, I just stuck around eating and loosing terribly at their weekly trivia night. And that right there is my main issue with it, the Monday trivia is now so well known that you basically have to show up at 5pm to secure yourself a table...and that's ridiculous. The teams are essentially composed of the same 15 people every week, so between two teams of 6-7 people, you are not getting those shots tonight buddy!I hear great things about the snake bite, but the food is just okay - don't go for the nachos, they get cold and soggy super quick! Same for the pizzas, disappointing. They serve their burgers with chips, which I think is the one true cop-out for any kitchen, but they are very good, so go with that ;)"

I thought I reviewed this dear joint back when there was still snow on the ground, when I was first delighted to tumble in here and discover this oasis of nice design, great local beers, decent little scotch and whiskey selection, super cool bilingual staff, free wifi etc etc and so much more to love. Le Vestiaire is tucked in between the surreal tube top shops and wedding supply stores of St Hubert, right where you would least expect but most hope to find a cool local bar. So let's give a halleluiah for that asap. There is a special sangria on the menu right now with cranberries and lychee, not sure if this is a usual occurrence but it sounds delicious enough to mention. Also there is a cute patio out front for outdoor drinking, and a few weeks of summer weather left...."

We had just dropped by a bar near our Airbnb a bit earlier and decided to take a different street back and explore a bit.Walking down the street we ended up passing by Le Vestiaire and we could very clearly hear 90s music being blasted inside the bar. We start cracking up, but we didn't head in, at least not initially since it looked like a private event. We didn't make it very far before one of the girls waved us in and at that point we couldn't say no.Once we were seated at the bar, I took a quick look at the beer menu and was blown away at the selection. I went straight for the stouts and got a 9% beer, but I didn't notice until after I got the bottle at how boozy it was, so needless to stay I would not be chugging this and then heading out.So while I took my time with my boozy stout, we made small talk with the bartender, danced to ""Cotton Eyed Joe"", sang along to NSYNC, and watched as the employees danced on top of the bar while they blasted Ace of Base. It was a surreal experience for sure. Hell of a good beer list and a really fun bar staff. I definitely plan on returning next time I'm in Montreal."

What better place to watch the game but at Bar Le Vestiaire on St Hubert street. Specializing in craft and Quebec microbrewery beers, Bar Le Vestiaire offers something for every taste. Not sure what beer you want to try, the staff is ready with recommendations, or try a four beer taster.Situated on Plaza St Hubert, the bar is located along one of Montreal's major commercial arteries, and caters not only to Habs fans but to shoppers and business people alike. Need a break from shopping, it is a great location for a light snack and a beer. The 5 a 7, offers a nachos special to groups needing a break after a hard days work. Just be sure to reserve some space for your group. On Mondays join in for quiz night, but if you are looking for some music stop by on Thursdays for karaoke. If you are looking for a celebration, join the crew at Bar Le Vestiaire for their 3rd anniversary on November 27, when a good time will be had by all.Bar Le Vestiaire is the place you go if you love beer. Since we love beer, it was the place for us. Opting for a taster, we sampled four different beers each with a distinct flavour and each one better than the last. Our recommendations came from co-owner Annick, and she was right on the mark. Not a beer fan, not a problem. Cocktails, wine and all your favorite drinks are available, for a nice light change of pace try the CID cider. Fresh and delicious it makes a nice treat for your taste buds.After our drinks it was time to eat. What better food to try in a bar but nachos. They were piled high with layers of cheese, with onions and olives, on the side were huge cups of both salsa and sour cream. We opted for a half serving and it was more than enough as an appetizer for two. Choosing a dish is often hard but not at Bar Le Vestiaire, we went for the specialty, the bison burger. Perfectly prepared and stacked high it was complemented with a healthy helping of coleslaw. As with any great meal, the only way to top it off is a hardy serving of chocolate. In this case it was Belgian chocolate mousse, and it was simply divine.After a great meal we moved on to the next best thing and focused on the rest of the hockey game. Had another cider for the road and left wanting to return again very soon.Bar le Vestiaire6634 rue Saint-Hubert, Montréal, H2S 2M3514 564-3823iatemontreal.com"

/user_details?userid=2oTG2GrBpikkonRxQywI7Q,Eric G.,"Annapolis, MD",4 star rating,"Great bar in Montreal that has an excellent beer selection and amazing trivia night on Monday nights. I was staying with a group of friends for a couple of weeks and they told me that I had to go to this bar when them and their friends for trivia. Don't speak French? No problem- there were some American pop songs amongst the questions that I could have my hand at guessing. Every time there was a song/Hollywood movie/American geography question, everyone would look over at me like a lifeline to confirm their guesses. In all, I enjoyed the bar- it had a young adult (almost all French speaking) crowd. I'd definitely go back the next time I'm in Montreal."
