A few places, but will it be 'Washoku' and delivered in a theatrical atmosphere with artistically choreographed movements? Note: Washoku 和食 is another word for Japanese cuisine Where 和 means 'Japan' or 'harmony,' 食 means 'food' or 'to eat'.While we wait for the pandemic to subside and ate allowed to dine-in again, you can sample some of the harmonious and balanced cuisine of Owner Chef Takuya Matsuda, chef Hachiro Fujise, sake sommelier Kuniko Fujita and many more from of the Okeya Kyujiro team such as Chef Aiko.Omakase Kaiseki Bento Box:- Grilled Lobster with Sea urchin- Grilled Black Cod with Saikyo-miso- Wagyu Beef Kado-Maki (華道巻き)-  Sunomono (季節のフルーツ仕立て) 'Seasonal fruit with crab and scallop'- Nishime 'Simmered root vegetables'- Edomae Style Bara-Chirashi (Edomae style egg, Bluefin tuna Toro, Salmon roe and Seasonal fish)- Today's Tempura (shrimp and seasonal vegetables)Note: Only 10 kaiseki are made per day to ensure consistent quality.

It's currently one of the two meals which are being served by the restaurant.OMAKASE KAISEKI contained the following dishes:* Grilled Lobster, Grilled Black Cod with Saikyo-miso* Wagyu Beef Kado-Maki* Sunomono (Seasonal fruit with crab and scallop)* Nishime (Simmered root vegetables)* EDOMAE Style Bara-Chirashi (Edomae style egg, Bluefin tuna Toro, Salmon roe and Seasonal fish)* Today's Tempura (shrimp and seasonal vegetables)The quality of the fish is outstanding and each dish is an explosion of unique flavours. They are currently making a very limited amount of dishes per day, so it's recommended reserving your order early. Also please note that the dishes contained in the meals are subject to change on a daily basis, since it's an Omakase (Chef's choice)."
