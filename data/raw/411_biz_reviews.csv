/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Really cosy place! We loved the relaxed and intimate atmosphere. When we arrived, there was a cute little handwritten sign with my name and our reserved table. It was super sweet for them to give us a 4 person table even though we were only 2 to give us more space. The brothers are warm and chatty. I love that they're so hands-on in their own business. The food was delicious and unique."
/user_details?userid=8qu5Zyurap002eIj1kLdOg,Joana Z.,"Saint-Lambert, Canada",5 star rating,"My friends and I were there on a Friday night (around 8:30) to celebrate a friend's birthday. The restaurant was pretty full, but they managed to give us their best spot and everyone sat all on the same table. We weren't too squished or anything, it was perfect, the seating is very comfortable. The restaurant itself is small, but it makes it cosier and not too loud. They also have a nice terrasse outside.The menu isn't huge, but everything on it is delicious and worth the price. I had the risotto with 3 mushrooms and it was so rich in cream and flavours, I finished it so fast despite it being hot and the hot weather outside. My friends made me try the poutine with chopped pork and the margarita pizza and it was also incredibly good. They have an amazing twist on what I would call comfort food.If you want to drink, I would recommend their Holy Water cocktail. It's flamed in the beginning, very impressive, very good and has a lot of alcohol in it. I've also had a mojito and it was absolutely delicious. The owners of the restaurants are extremely friendly, patient, and the service was great. They offered us shots and cut the cake for my friend's birthday in beautiful pieces with decorated plates. The music in the restaurant is amazing, I'd love to get a hold of that playlist because I was shazamming everything the whole night."

When we walked in it was very quiet which made us a little nervous, but we were not disappointed!We had the steak and the mushroom risotto and both wiped our plates absolutely clean. The staff was lovely, including the two brothers who waited on us. Thank you for a wonderful dinner!"
/user_details?userid=hSiBDOQFpMsKz7B0u-qjcA,Nick E.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"On a street like St. Denis with so many restaurants to choose from, La Demande Generale was a real find. We ordered the pizza and the beet salad and both exceeded our expectations in taste and presentation. Between us we ordered a signature cocktail, wine and beer and were pleased with all three. The waiter was extremely patient and accommodating. He suggested things to do during our stay in Montreal. It was a pleasant and enjoyable evening!"

Totally just skimmed through Yelp for a decent place that was midway between their hotel and my place and La Demande Générale fit the bill. I was so pleasantly surprised by this place! We ate out on the terrace at sunset, had delicious pizzas, and shared some beignets for dessert. The service was impeccable- very friendly and kind, attentive, and all around enjoyable!Will definitely be back to this restaurant in the future!"

Seedy as hell looking at night in this neighborhood but we were hungry and in for whatever. The drinks were game set on point and the food was one of our favorites during our trip. Uhhh, thanks Uber...???! Our meal: Burger with a fancy presentation for the guy. I opted for a single sized pizza. Great date night!"
/user_details?userid=zAB6lP0La-bPH-dlr8OHKw,Jawad N.,"Kutzky Park, Rochester, MN",1 star rating,"Worst experience ever; I've been to more than 30 cities and 10 different countries, and went to restaurants/bars in all of them, and this is the first time a place forces me to buy food after drinking half my pint; this was a very shady up selling strategy and the bartender was like this is how we do it in Montreal, you cant order beer without food, its the owners policy. This is BS (I live in MTL and this is the first time I encounter such behavior).  I definitely don't recommend this place at all, especially that this was on a Tuesday night where there was only 3 customers in the place.Update:I am sorry for the previous harsh comment, thanks for sharing the information about the legality of it, however the best approach would be to inform your customers about this before ordering and drinking any beverage, especially walk-ins that go straight to the bar after 10 pm and only ask for the drink menu. Thank you"

I know I will come back and so will my friends. Excellent service and food! One of us is vegan and had a salad, I tasted it out of curiosity.. it was purple-ish and spiced as I could taste a little garlic and it was just so good. I had the duck which was cooked perfectly, a mix of sweet and not sweet and the veggie mash it came with had a complexed tasty sweet taste. That same mash others had, was so good we had to ask the server what it was. Sorry I forgot the name but it wasn't potato and the server said its made with love and alot of butter. To me it tasted like heaven.For desert I had the beignet which came with a salty caramel sauce..... that sauce.... just thinking about it I salivate and I'm not really a desert person.We took pictures outside and one of the owners ( 1 of the 3 brothers) came outside to take picture of all of us. Did I say service was great? It was!For us 8 it was our first time and not our last. Reasonably priced and for what you're getting it feels like a steal. I've paid way more for mediocre food.  For the record, I personally don't know the owners and was not paid to put this review but I felt compelled to brag about this place and hopefully I get to eat here again.I took pictures of some of the plates so I keep in mind what I'll try next when I come back to Montreal.FYI they have a share meal that some had which included the duck with fish and ribs with that mash... I will be back"

I had the grilled romaine salad, the poutine with beef cheeks (guilty pleasure because kitchen had so much sophisticated food on offer) and beignet for desert. Cocktails, wine, and coffee.

The sound levels are well-managed so you can have a nice conversation. The seating is very comfortable. This place is great for a chill evening out with your flame or an unhurried friend soirée.They have many delicious offerings and lots of comfort food. We tried one of their pizzas and the risotto (excellent texture) and enjoyed both. We don't often order dessert, but the surprise highlight of the evening was their house donut which was tasty and beautifully presented.The servers are friendly and very attentive without being overwhelming. I live in the neighbourhood, and I'll definitely be back. I'm looking forward to when they have brunch. I bet it will be fab :)"
/user_details?userid=MLQAVuIIJ8B2AigoRYyCZQ,Steve B.,"Fort Mitchell, KY",5 star rating,"So glad we stopped here while in Montréal!  The food was top notch; I was blown away by the salmon tartare.  Pizzas were also excellent, and our server had an engaging demeanor that added to the overall experience.  Great food and service for a fair price; what's not to like?"
/user_details?userid=woxoWzgFcDmecEZrsNJh0Q,Alexis B.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"I have nothing but great things to say about this place.  I got lucky, on the walk home from work one night, I was walking down St. Denis and the menu caught my eye out of sheer simplicity.  A restaurant having a succinct list is always a good sign, it usually means they pick a few things and do them well.Letty, one of the guys who works there started chatting with me and made me feel welcome right away.  Later I found out he was one of the owners.  I really felt like an amazing salad with protein on it and a good glass of wine or two.  I started a new job that sent me up to Montreal for training for 6 weeks, so I was new to the area, it was my first day and I needed a good meal and a drink.  What came out what probably one of the best salads I have ever had.  The chef perfectly grilled a nice big piece of salmon, over a bed of arugula and some grilled veggies underneath, he made an amazing vinaigrette and I had a glass of a light Tuscan Sangiovese from Maremma.  I chatted with them about the list a bit, they do have cool eclectic list going on there.  I enjoyed my salad, had a few glasses of wine and the also asked them to pack my lunch for me for the following day so I could have another killer salad.  Again, that they did, a great piece of grilled chicken, a big salad, some roasted veggies, a little pureed squash and a new vinaigrette.  I was sold!I have been back every week and the food just continues to blow me away.  But, its not just the food.  Montreal is filled with amazing food, this city rocks my world with the food.  With Le Demand General it's a combination of a lot of things with this place, Letty and the crew always make you feel like you're part of the family when you walk in.  It's like a real life Cheers, but with great food, and a great bar.  The bartender/ sommelier really knows his stuff and is pretty fun to chat with.  The place is super cool, you have a mix of having a nice restaurant area to eat in as well as a bar to hang out, drink and chill with friends at.  One of my friends came up and visited on a weekend and we went their which was an absolute blast.  We ordered some appetizers and main courses to share and branded out a lot into their ever growing wine list.  They had a wild mushroom risotto that I need more of in my life, for sure.  We also had a beef cheek what was so rich, sharing it was more than enough.  Every bite was memorable.I know there are so many great places to go, but, Le Demande General is not a place to be missed.  They don't have anything frozen and the don't cut any corners, so everything you have is fresh and great quality.  I do wish they would do some more marketing!  When I tell my co-workers about it, not many people have heard of it, but other than that, I wouldn't change anything."

We sat on the terrace and enjoyed truly excellent cuisine. This is the type of place where the menu isn't in 5 languages, but if you're lost in the French, I have no doubt that Laki, Petros, and Costas will help you out. They are wonderful hosts!  We tried the *Mediterranean sea bass, pork chops, and mushroom Risotto - all three dishes are outstanding. Highly recommend!"

When I walked in I was a was wondering if I would be disappointed because it's a pretty standard-looking bar, but I tried all of my family members food, and every plate was amazing- mushroom risotto, salmon tartar, squash soup, poutine, and my FAVOURITE- the arugula and prosciutto pizza with truffle oil was maybe the best I've ever had."

The three brothers are passionate about making your experience memorable. Each and every platter is beautifully presented and generous. The beef cheek is so tender and flavourful, salmon tartar is hand-cut, fresh and delicately seasoned, wood oven pizza is piping hot and perfect. For dessert the pudding chomeur is decadent, creamy and totally addictive. LOVED IT!"
/user_details?userid=iogWHWv1XIk64jCg35xZTw,Marc B.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"Wow- amazing in all aspects! My favorite dining experience in our Quebec travels. Owned by 3 brothers and open since fall 2016, located on the busy Rue St-Denis it can be easy to miss but don't pass by. Service was friendly and detailed in English to help decipher the French menu. Cream of carrot soup and beer salad started us off perfectly with tender delicious beets in a beautiful presentation. My soup was creamy and so flavorful, wished I'd ordered 2, so good!Main courses of calamari over perfectly cooked and seasoned grains and my flank steak was served on a piece of slate with a large helping of creamy mashed sweet potatoes and al dente vegetables with the medium rare steak tender and flavorful with a rich au jus if desired. Reasonably priced Italian wine topped it off. Highly highly recommend!"
/user_details?userid=v5trEcduRTyetd9m6mvasA,Serena T.,"Fremont, CA",5 star rating,"This was our first night in Montreal, and the delicious food at La Demande Generale was spot on! Our family of four (including two demanding teenagers) enjoyed everything we ordered.Entrees (Appetizers):(1.) Salade Romaine Grillee -- Whole grilled romaine lettuce with bite-sized bacon and croutons; the grilled romaine definitely added a nice taste to this salad.(2.) Calmars Grilles -- Grilled calamari on a bed of couscous with the slightest hint of limePlats Principaux (Main):(1.) Bavette de Boeuf -- Flank steak; the sauce was heavenly!(2.) Poutine a la Joue de Boeuf -- A staple of Quebec; our waitress recommended this dish, and I have to agree with her that it is decadent. (3.) Prise du Jour (Fish of the Day) -- Red snapper; oh, so tender! Served with hummus and a Greek salad.(4.) Pizza - Sauce Alfredo, Poireaux, Ail, Champignons, ChorizoDessert:(1.) Beignet - I.D.G. -- Wow! The caramel sauce was magnificent! Semi-covered chocolate cherries were pluses!The mark of a great meal is when all the plates are completely cleaned. All of our plates can be described that way. We still want to go back and try the burger.Last but not least, our waitress Asma deserves a shout-out. She was friendly, informative, and hospitable. If you are ever in Montreal, La Demande Generale is one bistro that can't be missed!"

It was such amazing food and service that I would have gone back every day if I had more time. My husband had the smoked salmon, mushroom risotto, and beignets. I had the grilled romaine salad, tomato and basil pizza, and maple pudding. All of it was fantastic, but I'd say the mushroom risotto was the winner overall. It's a little pricey, but for the quality and taste I'd say it is actually a steal!"

This bistro definitely satisfies in every way. Attentive staff and creative food. For starters we had a very tender mini calamari on savoury couscous.

If everyone in our family of picky eaters loves their meal, it's a day to mark on the calendar.The poutine was a twist on the traditional - a cheese sauce over veal cheeks and mushrooms.  The short ribs were perfectly braised and luxurious.This was our best meal in Montreal.

/user_details?userid=di2qq3I54ayhNnQVt6RFKA,Tyrone W.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"Wonderful restaurant!!! I stumbled onto this hidden gem as we were looking for a restaurant between our place in the Plateau and my friend's hotel on Rue St. Denis. Came in on a Thursday evening for a late dinner. They have a nice outdoor area but we opted to dine in the cozy interior. The vibe is casual chic with a welcoming feel and I was amused they were playing hip hop. We were taken good care of by 'Laki' who we later came to realize is one of the trio of brothers who own the restaurant. I always get nervous when dining in restaurants with small menus that someone either won't find something they want or they won't like it. This place didn't disappoint from the pork and short ribs, to the salads, to the wine and cocktail recommendations everything was exceptional!! We finished it off with a platter of beignets  with berries drizzled with chocolate and caramel! I almost died twice SO good! Overall we couldn't have asked for a better meal on our first evening in Montreal. You should definitely come here!"

The 3 brother team that runs the restaurant was amazingly accommodating of our party and even had a personalized sign for our table as we walked in the door. Wine and food selection are perfect: short but well thought out and quality. The food was absolutely incredible, especially considering the price. We had probably half the items on the menu and they were all phenomenal. Drinks and wine were also on point. I had a drink with burnt rosemary that the waiter / bartender actually burnt right in front of us at the table. Quite the presentation. 11/10 would come again!"

/user_details?userid=GogtMtIltLV6i4NNsnPw0g,Jeff S.,"Stanford, CA",5 star rating,"This a gem of a restaurant.  I was visiting Montreal for a few days for work and was looking for a solid dinner, nice ambiance, and a place to unwind late.  Came here around 10:20pm (they stop serving food at 11pm) and the food, service and everything in general just blew me away.  I am also highly picky about my food (having lived in NYC, LA and now the SF Bay Area), I am also Celiac/allergic to gluten and am generally on a Paleo/Whole 30 diet.  They were able to not only accommodate my dietary restrictions but the food just tasted incredible.  Most of the items were locally sourced and everything was fresh.  They adapted some of the dishes so they wouldn't have gluten or dairy, and the staff went out of their way to make sure things were ok.  I actually came back the second night, the next day, since I had such a great experience.  The place is owned and operated by 3 brothers, who are just the nicest guys in the world.  The place just opened last October and I hope they have a long and prosperous run as I hope to be back in Montreal next summer and to come by again!"

/user_details?userid=GXYs7BReFbnirPttsTBxpA,Luke S.,"Boston, MA",1 star rating,"If I could I would leave this place 0 stars. The food is horrible. It seems that they don't know how to cook. The waiter did not offer the menu. Only after 2 nd attempt he brought the menu. He did not want to make any suggestions on the food. There is an older guy who constantly was on the phone while cooking the food. He touches his phone, cooking, slicing stuff at the same time. Very unsanitary. Ordered 2 items and they were absolutely uneatable. The dishes came in half cold like they were cooked before. It was clear that they just briefly warmed them up. Had duck which was cold. It came with some crazy salad combination, unfresh strawberries, blueberries and greens and some strange chunks of merengues. Underneath the duck leg there was absolutely cold puree which tasted quite awful. I went to many high end restaurants but have never seen duck with sweet merengues as a dish. I am all for contrasts, experiments but trust me that would make anyone to throw up. I could not eat that ""piece of art"" and just was left very hungry. Another dish was the steak.  It was a bad chunk of meat absolutely cold with vinegar flavor plus just unfresh looking vegetables. Contacted the restaurant about the negative experience and the owner was extremely rude by stating that I did not understand their food. He did not apologize and argued in a very hostile manner. It seems that the reviews are bogus because this type of food is not anything close to Montreal restaurants and we all know that Montreal has plenty of delicious restaurants. Avoid this establishment at all costs if you don't want find yourself hungry, angry and dissatisfied. Personally had to go to a local supermarket to find some food to eat after this bizarre experience."
