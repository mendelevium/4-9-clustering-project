/user_details?userid=ahDxPzmaQuSOQtQMvZryZw,Anthony B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Such a unique experience eating in the dark! And the waiters are visually impaired as well, which makes meaningful too to me. I made the reservation online the day before, came in at 5:30 on a Saturday, and I was pretty much alone. You get to look at the menu before sitting in the dark and order ahead.My waiter Matt was excellent and I did the 3 course surprise meal with a surprise cocktail and a surprise wine. The price for the quality of food, and the experience, was really reasonable too!While they prepared my food, and I sat in the dark, it began to fill up by 6 and it was loud in the room by 6:30.It was fun to smell, even touch, the meals as they came out to try and figure out what they were before even tasting it. I got something with sliced salmon and a side of arugala salad with caviar as an appetizer. My main dish was a pork ossobuco on a bed of mashed potatoes. And for desert I got a crumbled oreo pineapple and rhasberry pastry. It was all prepared excellent and tasted amazing. I was blown away by the pork and potatoes in particular. It was fall apart and extra creamy. I wanted seconds haha.The room itself is completely pitch black and the only leakage of light sometimes comes from the door the waiters go through to the kitchen. But they knock before going through in order to prepare the other side to have the lights off. You can kind of sense the layout of the room when people start talking. But since no one can see, everyone seems to talk a little louder than normal.I'll be giving this another shot soon, I don't know how often they rotate their surprise dishes, but I want to find out!"
/user_details?userid=mGpSdlT6XfHOtr-uHJgRzA,George S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"O.Noir is a special French-Italian restaurant and patrons are expected to eat in complete darkness while being served by legally blind waiters and waitresses (a population that experiences roughly a 70% unemployment rate). There are several courses available for appetizers, mains, and desserts; however, you can also opt for the 'surprise' option where you have no idea what arrives at your table. The 'surprise' option was f..delicious. The concept of the restaurant is to experience food, drink, and conversation in the dark without being able to see anything including your food, guests or even the servers (while maintaining the standards of a premium restaurant). When you sample the food without your sight your remaining senses are heightened allowing you to really savor the smell and sharpen taste of your meal like never before.The server asked us to remove our hands from the table, lest the dishes topple over. The server is visually impaired but moving around effortlessly. Carrying & clearing dishes. Attending to everyone. Chit-chatting. All at the same time. All in pitch darkness. He was in control and knew everything that is going on. Always being there whenever the customer wants you.The server was so friendly and playful and I guarantee you'll be laughing most of the time you're in the dark. You'll most likely end up speaking to the people next to you and it's a great way to socialize without feeling shy because you can't see each other. The friendly staff and servers made the experience an awesome one. We never felt rushed at all. This was an outstanding experience and I highly suggest that everyone tries it.The more important was the fact you couldn't pull out your mobile phone or look at your watch. Time doesn't pass easily in places like these. Hence "" conversation in the dark"". In an era when we usually pass time before the food is served by scrolling through our mobile phones, these minutes proved to be quite a challenge for many people. The idea was for people to talk to each other, an art unfortunately forgotten in today's times, unfortunately.And, If you need to go to the bathroom, someone shows you the way. Luckily you can pee with the lights on One more thing, it's the perfect place for a blind date. Thanks to our server, the owner Leonardo and all the staff for making this unique experience amazing"

You get to dine in the complete darkness and guess what is on your plate. If you are eating for the first time, I suggest you getting the surprise dishes/drinks, it really test your palates. I was lucky that no one in the room opened their cellphone, but apparently some people had some bad experience. Please leave your cellphone in the lockers at your disposal!The food itself was flavourful, and the meat were juicy and really well cooked. I honestly loved the food as much as the experience, they also give a generous portion. The service was fantastic and the waiters were all friendly. Will go back!"
/user_details?userid=HUkLmF3TUDZQRw7kfw0Pxw,Kartik G.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,A unique concept in eating in the dark. A must try experience to test your other senses.  Even though it is expensive but this is worth the experience and the food is quite good. In my experience I felt one side of the plate tasted with flavors whereas the other side of the plate tasted bland. Faye was my waiter and guided me and was kind and helpful. Once you enter they clearly explain you how the whole setup works and they are helpful in answering any questions you might have. It's reservation only so you need to keep that in mind.Enjoy the experience rather than indulging in the food.

/user_details?userid=LecyBjohZL6LW-pXt5PTeg,CC C.,"Plymouth, MA",5 star rating,"I remember years ago seeing a program that talked about dining in the dark and how cool that sounded at the time. Fast forward to my first visit to Montreal and a suggestion from my brother for us to try this place out. I was so game.We made reservations online and then ended up showing up 45 mins early. No worries, because they were willing to seat us then. The bottom part is a light bar area with some seating to look at the menu before you go up. There are lockers tucked in a little cubie where you have to put your stuff. Order before you head up and pay when you come back down so no worries about any of that stuff. You have the option to do 2 courses or 3, as well as the option to pick what you want to let them surprise you. You also have that same option with the paired drink for each of the courses. I opted to pick my first two courses and tried a surprise cocktail with my app and let them surprise me with my dessert. My brother is a true rebel and got all surprises. Your waiter (who is visually impaired) comes down to lead you up. Our guy was so nice, directed us to grab his shoulder, and into the darkness we went. Initially, I had a moment of panic when we first lost the light, but once he directed us to our chairs, I was able to reorient myself. The food was so good. I'm terrible and can't remember all the food (aside from the scallops), but boy I cleaned my plate. The surprise cocktail I got was delicious as well. Some ginger creation that made my whole night. Dining in the dark definitely makes you think about how important your sight is. It was weird to feel around for your food and the waiter was so great about orienting you to where your glass/plate/utensils were located. After a while, I found myself just using my hands to eat because the odds of me dropping things into my lap were high. The pacing of the food was great. Not that I don't mind talking to my brother, but I was also pretty hungry. To be fair, it really does facilitate conversation because you can't look at anything so talking is all you have. The lack of sight made all the sounds in the room ten times louder also. We signaled to our waiter when we were done and he escorted us back out to the light. The price could be prohibitive to some, but this is an experience so you pay for that. I was definitely okay with paying what I did to try this place."
/user_details?userid=SfvNfZU_Kht9EaeWuYsxhw,Kristi H.,"Edmonton, Canada",3 star rating,"At ONoir you walk in and are greeted by a host, they give you menus and ask if you would like to order off of it or be surprised with your meal choices.  Very cool option. After ordering, you are guided by your waiter into the seating area which is completely dark. ONoir hires inclusively and works with an organization supporting individuals with visual impairments; their waiters are all visually impaired!  What a great initiative!  Waiters were also fully bilingual.The drinks were ""surprise"" and delicious.  That was the only part of the meal I didn't specifically order.  For dinner I had I started with the thai salad which was interesting to eat without being able to see it. I had the grilled beef shoulder fillet - it was delicious (potatoes were amazing!).  Dessert was molten chocolate cake, which was good also.  I gave it three stars because I found the atmosphere really loud and while the experience of eating in the dark is a neat idea, I wouldn't do it again."
/user_details?userid=20LRsYfxlpfoeYfz68uFIA,Alejandro M.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Best place to have a unique experience. The food is delicious and the waiters are awesome! A Montreal's must for sure. They also have a great terrace during the summer.
/user_details?userid=zwd1X5SkEuug07g1yZrgqA,Rachel H.,"Olathe, KS",5 star rating,"Wow! What an night. While it was a very good dining experience, it was an even more valuable life experience. Therefore, I'll give you an idea of both experiences, separately.LIFE: Do you know anyone who's eyes do not work? Legally blind or complete darkness? ONoir gives you just a glimpse into what it would be like to live without your sense of sight. Initially, you can choose a dish from the regular menu, or you can ask for a ""surprise dish"", while sitting in the regularly lit lounge. They have surprise appetizers, cocktails, main dishes and desserts to ask for. This is when you mention allergies or food limitations. Once you make your choices, you are led by your blind server through a door, then a black curtain into a completely dark room with a variety of chattering voices (we listened to English, French, Chinese and probably more!). Your server directs each guest to their seat, orients you to your place setting and tells you what to do if you need help. With each course Fe (our server) gave warning where he was laying the plate of food and wished us well.At one point, we spilled our rather full glass of water. We felt embarrassed and pretty bad for the mess. No one freaked out. No one rushed to clean it up. No one even noticed. When we told our server what had happened, he just reminded us to be careful and to feel around our table before moving. What a life lesson! The embarrassment that we felt just added to the experience - even though it didn't feel good. Nothing else ""big"" happened other then the water spill, but we had many moments when we realized, ""wow - this is what a blind person had to deal with every moment of every day"". It was very eye opening and unique. I'd totally recommend this to everyone. DINING: we really liked all of our food! We had a salmon tar tar, grilled beef shoulder fillet, roasted carrots and roasted potatoes, a tequila ginger beer with blackberry current liquor cocktail, and a strawberry cheesecake with an Oreo crust. It was all fabulous. The textures were extra pronounced in our minds and the tastes were just fun - especially since you didn't know what was what! (Surprise dishes!!) there was definitely a good balance of salty & sweet, crunchy & soft, acidic & rich. Delish!"
/user_details?userid=yVnIzIQERMrFNJFXrY6M8A,EC H.,"Pittsford, NY",5 star rating,"Eating at O. Noir was one of the things we (my husband, our 12 and 14 year-old daughters, and myself) most eagerly anticipated about our trip to Montreal, and it did not disappoint! The host who took our order made it clear that the chefs/kitchen would make dishes to accommodate various allergies and preferences, including the surprise selections. This was reassuring news for us as one of us is allergic to gluten and two others do not eat fish.The food and drinks were delicious and well-paired; my husband's and my (different) mystery cocktails matched our appetizers perfectly!Our server, Felix, was terrific, making sure we got to and from our table easily and safely and listening attentively to, and answering, any questions we had. The experience of eating in the dark, however (and it was *completely* pitch black), was absolutely the highlight of the evening! Obviously, your other senses work harder when one is removed, and that was definitely true in this case. It made for a unique and fascinating experience.All in all, we loved it. Our daughters, who had been apprehensive, found that they needn't have worried - their food was exactly to their liking and eating in the dark wasn't as scary as they'd imagined! We would definitely return."

Not like night-time dark, but pitch blackness, so dark that my eyes started to see swirling colors - it was trying that hard to grasp any piece of light. Food is delicious, i got the scallops, lamb shank and mystery dessert. Highlight of the evening was trying to figure out how to eat and cut the lamb shank in the pitch black and shoveling god knows what into my mouth"

Staff was organized and sat us at our tables very fast. You have the choice to pick your menu items or  the ""surprise menu"". I strongly recommend going ""all in"" and do the surprise menu. It is actually very interesting to guess/touch what you eat. ONoir only hires blind staff which is a wonderful initiative. All of them were very competent and bilingual. Food was very good as well as the wine/cocktails. 3 stars  because 1/I would have liked to know what I actually ate. It would have been nice to have a feedback on my menu. I still don't know if my appetizer was chicken or a falafel? 2/wayyyyy too noisy. It was impossible for me to Focus on my dish. It is a small room with at least 40-50 people."

We were greated very warmly and our waiter was incredibly nice and we were treated very nicely. We had a tasting platter from a tuango coupon. The food was pretty good although the fish was very wet and had an overpowering dill taste but other than that it was good.
/user_details?userid=OmfS4QagIpYgd2lFJbefXw,Arasha L.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"If you're looking for a dinner with an experience, then this is the place to go. My friends and I travelled to Montreal for Spring Break, and this was one of the most memorable things that we did. Upon entering the restaurant, you are asked to stow away your belongings, including anything that might light up (phones, watches, etc.). You're given a menu with some options for each course, but you can also choose to have a surprise, which is what we all did. Once you give up your menus, you are led into a room in pitch black, guided by your waiter. I'll also mention that all of the waiters are blind or visually impaired, so it's incredibly impressive how well they know the look of the restaurant. You are taken to your seats and brought out your food accordingly. My friends and I were amazed at the sensation of enjoying each other's presence, rather than being glued to our screens. I will mention that it is very shocking at first. At the beginning, I kept waiting for someone to turn on the lights so I could see what was around me, but you get used to it a few minutes in. It was exciting to have a plate of food in front of us, because we didn't know what it was! We had to physically use our hands. We sat there guessing the contents of the food, and we were wrong almost every time. For our main course, we had deer, something I would've never ordered. The price for dinner is pretty expensive, especially if you're ordering drinks, but I believe that it is worth it. O'Noir is a fantastic restaurant to visit because it's more than just dinner, it's an opportunity to surprise yourself (and your taste buds!)"
/user_details?userid=67Aj5cW5xS6OkvNj6kcvsw,Hannah G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"What a fun and unique experience! Three years ago I wrote on my bucket list that it was one of my dreams to go to a ""dining in the dark"" restaurant. I am so happy that ONoir was where I checked that off. The experience of eating in the dark was like nothing I have done before and added a new layer of wonder, entertainment, and challenge to my dining. Everything is explained in detail in the light of the aesthetically calming waiting room, so there is nothing to fear. Each guest is able to pick an appetizer, a main course, a dessert, and a drink. Free warmed bread and butter are provided. The experience can be elevated by ordering the surprise dish, which I did for my main course and dessert. I enjoyed the mystery of guessing what I was eating, although if I were to go again I would select dishes I already know I enjoy. The food was good and did not disappoint, but the main appeal of ONoir is the experience. The food is pricey (around $50 per person for all courses), but I think it is worth it for the experience. Although fun, I think it is a place I needed to try once, but will not return to for a while. I recommend dining with a group. I went with six people and we had a great time describing our food to each other and attempting the great challenge of sharing bites of each other's meals. The wait staff is phenomenal. When ordering, they were very accommodating to dietary restrictions. In the dark room, all the waiters are visually impaired. Our waiter Sammy was so friendly and patient. He was an absolute delight. I hope you give it a try!"

We booked a reservation online in advance. When we arrived, we were instructed to hang up our coats and put our valuables and anything that made a light into lockers. The lit area had a bar and seating for guests to wait. The ambience was warm and welcoming. There, we were given menus and had the options of choosing our courses/drinks, or opting for a surprise. Here is where you tell them your allergies and dietary restrictions. I chose a surprise cocktail, starter and main. My SO chose the scallops for starter and the duck for the main. We were then escorted by our waiter, Matthieu, into a completely dark dining room. He guided us through the room and to our table. My surprise starter was an Asian salad with noodles and veggies seasoned with sesame oil and ginger. My main was a wild rice dish with roasted veggies and pineapples with crispy kale. The scallops were incredible and the duck was outstanding. The edges were crispy and the meat was well seasoned. Overall, the experience was totally unique and something I am super grateful for experiencing. I would recommend trying dining in the dark to everyone as it elevates your relationship with your food."

It was also super interesting to be brought into an ENTIRELY pitch black room to eat. I neverrrr expected it to be as dark as it was!However, after we were seated and bread came .. we waited for quite a while for our appetizers. They were reasonably well cooked and tastes pretty good ! I had the pork croquettes and they were very rich, but somewhat overpowered by the seafood lemon that came from the scallops next to it. My main course was supposed to be duck, but most pieces were fat and tasted more like dried pork. My sister ordered the salmon, and really liked it. We are familiar with the Caps Cod fish, but she said this dish may be too ""seafoodish"" for some. Still somewhat enjoyable. I had been confused because the duck didn't taste at all like what we expected.Unfortunately that was where it ended... by choice. We waited for over a half hour for our waiter... who never came. We ordered a bottle of wine and had only a 1/2 glass before our meal and one whole glass with our appetizer. Last time we checled, a bottleee served more than 3 8oz glasses..We waited so long that we had yo cut our 3 course meal to a 2 course mean and ditched the rest of our bottle unfortunately.Overall - fun to experience! but not worth the money"
/user_details?userid=k97c4eriYUeMG_cGw8rYLQ,Bailey M.,"Bolingbrook, IL",5 star rating,"This restaurant definitely gives diners a unique experience which allows them to better understand what it is like for a blind person. When you arrive, you will put your belongings in a locker and use the restroom if needed. Then they will have you look at a menu and preorder. After that, you will meet your waiter or waitress for the night, who are blind themselves. That is when you will form a train and enter the dark room to be escorted to your seats. It is no lie, PITCH BLACK, you will not see a thing. You will only hear the noises of the other diners enjoying their meals. If you need anything during dinner you just call your waiter's name and they will stop by. After you eat, you will be escorted back into the light where you will pay your bill. I started with the pork croquettes appetizer, this appetizer wasn't for me because it Tasted too much like mustard with tons of breading but I may be just picky. For my meal I had the beef tenderloin with mashed potatoes and vegetables. Overall I thought the portions and flavors were great. The mashed potatoes were a puree so they were on the creamier side. The meat was perfectly cooked, not too fatty, and cut up for me. To drink I had a raspberry vodka cocktail which was fantastic, I would definitely recommend! It didn't taste overally sweet or strong. Bread and tea also comes with most of their meals. My mother had the ribs which personally I think is a bad idea given how messy Ribs are.For dessert we shared the PROFITEROLES WITH HOMEMADE NOUGAT ICE-CREAM. It tasted good but overall it was a small dessert with very little ice cream And at that point I was ready to go back into the light.Our waiter Rodrigo was very friendly and funny! I'm giving 5 stars because of the unique experience done well as a whole."
/user_details?userid=xtoynUfRmTUdwZtzjXEdzw,Tanya D.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"What an amazing experience! You first step in to the restaurant where you view the menu and make your selections. You can either have a two course or three course meal. We decided on the entree, dessert and a drink. *There is an option to have a ""surprise""dish instead of selecting it yourself. I would HIGHLY recommend this* We allowed our entree to be a surprise but chose our dessert and drink. You put away your belongings in a locker. You can not bring any light in! You are then led in by your server into COMPLETE blackness. I have to admit, I have moderate claustrophobia and recurrent nightmares of being in enclosed spaces so I had a minor bout with anxiety initially. I wasn't sure I was going to make it! But you get use to it, and you start using your other senses. Our surprise main dish was pork, turnip and tomato. It was AMAZING. It was also an incredible experience learning what it was we were eating as we picked it up, tasted it, felt it. (It wasn't until after that we were told what it was). The pork was so tender. For dessert we had the creme brûlée which was also delicious. We tried the Sangria and it was very different. It was ok but almost tasted watery to me. I would stick with a wine next time. Our server Julia (I think) was amazing and so friendly. It was sad when the experience was over! Would highly recommend and would definitely come again.

Definitely not a good idea for anyone who is anxious or claustrophobic, however, I found it to be a really eye-opening (ha ha) experience and really allows you to imagine how difficult living with limited vision is. I had the beef tartare to start and the pork duology with apple and maple syrup as the main. The pork was amazing, the beef tartare was very different than what I was used to but still good."

The room is COMPLETELY black and you can see nothing. I picked the 'surprise' for both my starter and main, and the starter was delicious (a chicken curry potato salad) but the main was honestly one of the worst meals I've had at a restaurant (pork tenderloin, a bacon stuffed roasted tomato, root vegetables). The meat tasted dry, flavourless and overcooked. I felt weird sending it back though... something about the hassle of the darkness? In the end, it was a cool thing to try, but it's too bad the food isn't worth the price. I feel as though for the cost (~50 / person after drinks) you could get a waaaay better meal at a number of other places."

So when my fiancé and I were near this place in Montreal, I was excited to share this with him. Well it didn't go as great as I'd hoped.The good:I made reservations ahead of time, and that was pretty easy. They ask you not bring phones in to dinning area and offer lockers for your bags/coats, which is cool. They were friendly and quick to get us to our table. Service was overall good and we had no complaints. The bad:We were really let down by the food. I know this is an experience and its more about the experience but c'mon the food should have been better. My fiancé had some duck and it was poorly cooked. It had a very rubbery texture and was unpleasant to eat. Also the chocolate mousse I had for dessert was obviously frozen since when it was served it wasn't completely thawed. And lastly I don't think my fiancé really enjoyed the whole dinning in pitch black experience. With this experience your main focus becomes the food. Tasting, smelling, feeling, and enjoying it, since you can't see it. But when the food doesn't stack up, its just you sitting in the dark chewing on some rubbery overpriced duck and unthawed mousse. Eh, I'd pass on this place again."

We chose the surprise option for all courses and drinks (I picked surprise red wines) You are thrown into a complete blind element. You cannot see your hand in front of you. It is that dark. Its a simulation to live what blind people live through on a day to day basis. At first I was thrown off and to be quite honest an enormous amount of anxiety hit me once i got to the table. My other friends were also freaking out. Let me also mention our waiter Matthew was such a delight he was patient and kind with us. We got three courses with no prior knowledge of what we would eat. The experience was one I will be telling my kids about, not to mention the food was delicious and so fresh, the pairing with the wine was so beautifully curated. Whatever I ate I loved it!

/user_details?userid=Db01jIIxDmP5BtugEX9nJQ,Tran N.,"Cambridge, MA",5 star rating,"This review is written with the presumption you know what this place is about: eating food in a pitch black room. Food: 4/5 stars. We choose the 3 course surprise-me option. My partner and I both thought our appetizer was turkey, when it was in fact revealed to be duck. This was due to the fact that the duck was fairly dry relative to the fatty duck we have had in the past. My partner also aptly noted that the appetizer would have been excellent by any standards had it actually been turkey---it's hard to get turkey to be that moist. The main course was slightly salty, but delicious. We forgot to ask what dessert was, but it tasted somewhat like an apple cobbler.Service: 5/5 We accidentally arrived there early, but were welcomed with warm and exceptional service. I'd give this place a 6/5 had it not been for the fact we felt kind of forgotten after we were served dessert. We spent approximately half an hour or so in the dark after eating everything, trying to get a waiter to lead us back out. Atmosphere/Experience: 6/5 There is most definitely an entertainment factor that leads to this high-rating. You're lead into a pitch black room by holding a waiter's shoulder, with any others in your party possibly holding onto your own shoulders. It's silly, it's exciting, and should you choose to let the restauraunt pick your meals (which I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend for obvious reasons), everything is a delightful and savory/sweet surprise. As we were the first ones to enter, we experienced an eerie quietness with some simple music in the room, getting used to drinking/using utensils without sight. As more people were brought in, we could hear their excitement and the energy was somewhat infectious. The lack of sight is actually an excellent dinner topic, so bring your friends! Maybe you'll be as pleased by the food as we were too!"

You select what you wanna eat before hand (or to be surprised) and then a blind server will guide you to your seat in the darkness. I had the Mai Mai cocktail which was pretty great, but what's even better is the tea beer. Wow! I wanna buy a 12-pack. My appetizer was the pork with scallop mousse, and this mousse must have been the highlight of the night. Packed with flavour and a nice velvety texture, enhanced by the fact I couldn't see it! I had the rabbit as a main course (yes, I wasn't adventurous until dessert time, how boring). The seasoning had maybe a tad more rosemary than it needed, but all-around well balanced with the apricots and full of different textures. Eating it with cutlery was difficult though, maybe practice before hand? I chose to be surprised in the dessert because I figured I should have the experience of not knowing what I was being served too, so I feel that was a pretty safe bet (feel free to copy me). We got an amazing creamy dessert with blueberries and toasted quinua. Usually I hate when restaurants use quinua because they don't really cook it to its best potential (I'm Peruvian so I know I thing or two about that!) but in this case... I must say I'm impressed. Waiter was also so nice!! The only bad thing is that some people, when they have been deprived of one sense, in this case sight, start talking really loudly to, I guess, overcompensate, and there was this table far from us that was screaming so much that I had a hard time chatting with the person who was right in front of me. But that's not a criticism on the restaurant, rather a recommendation for customers to be mindful of that and try to respect everyone's culinary experience!"

The waiters are visually impaired, but it doesn't slow them down with assisting you. It's a humbling yet exciting experience eating here. You order everything before you get seated- then the waiters come and bring you to your table and let you know where all of your utensils are. I ordered the beef tartar- which personally I didn't like, but I had the beef shoulder for my main course which was delicious! Our drinks were spot on which was a major plus! Definitely recommend!"

You don't see a thing for the entirety of your meal and but that really adds to the dining experience as I believe your sense of taste and smell gets heightened. Both my wife and I are vegetarians, she got the stuffed cabbage and I got the surprise mains and we both got the mousse for dessert. I really liked my surprise main course and it was fun trying to guess what I was eating. I also got a surprise tea which was one of the best teas I have had. Also, big thanks to our server Gabriel who really helped us with our experience. I have really high respect for these guys and what they are able to achieve here !!

/user_details?userid=WtmmtVkui7AjVIZvnqQHwg,Rosie B.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"TLDR: Amazing culinary experience.O'Noire is no gimmick. The food is delicious and thoughtfully executed.We got the tenth anniversary Groupon which gave us a cocktail, appetiser, and entree. When you enter you are greeted and directed to lockers where you can keep your bags. Having bags on the floor in the dining area would be a safety hazard. You are then shown the menu where you can choose from the items listed or be surprised. I chose the surprise cocktail and appetiser but got the rabbit saddle stuffed with poultry and wrapped in bacon for the main. My friend went full surprise mode.We were then escorted into the dining area by our server. We created a train as we entered into pure darkness, which was definitely a shock to the system. You literally cannot even see the outline of you hand I. After we were seated, we were treated to bread and butter. Our cocktails arrived and I received a grapefruit, gin, and soda cocktail that was delicious and complemented my meal.Our surprise appetisers arrived, and we both guessed wrong. What I thought was a juicy, succulent braised beef dish was actually duck confit. My friend thought she had fresh salmon tartare, but it was actually scallop. Whatever they were, we devoured them with gusto.My main was just as delicious, but it was a shock. The three types of meat mixed together created a new flavour and texture that was unlike anything I had before. And I loved whenever I found a piece of artichoke heart and roasted cherry tomato. My friend thought her main was braised beef cheek with Jerusalem artichoke puree, roasted squash, and sweet potato chips. In the end, it was braised lamb with squash done three ways. We ended the meal with coffee and tea. My chai smelled outstanding, almost vibrant, and the flavours danced on my tongue.Because we couldn't see, the server would carefully place anything he was handing us on our shoulder, and we would take it from him and place it down. He was a sweetheart who would frequently check on us. The darkness did take some time getting used to, but it was such a wonderful experience that I will most likely be visiting again."

The people were amazing and the whole experience was something that you should 100% experience in your lifetime. The waiter was so kind and went above and beyond to make our experience the best it could be. The hostess was sure to answer any and all of our questions happily, even though we asked about a million and chatted for over five minutes. The reason I did not give full stars is because the food is mediocre. I would definitely over and over again recommend this restaurant for the experience of it all, but we were not a big fan of the food. We called and they honored our Groupon which included an app, 2 entrees and 2 drinks for a dinner for two.  Like I said, the experience was unforgettable and super amazing but the food was okay."

Walking up to the restaurant we notice two men with Onoir shirts on smoking outside.... cigarettes and weed. No big deal. Inside the place was cute and clean. We go upstairs to eat. When they tell you it's dark.....it's so dark you can't see your hand in front of your face dark. The waitress was very kind and explained everything. I love the total concept but and here is the rub...... my entree was barely warm when it arrived... further into the dish is actually was cool. By then I was over my food. The flavors were good... we ordered the surprise dinner and we were able to gues what the foods were. But my meal was ruined by a cool/cold entre, so now I'm thinking that there is no chef in the kitchen and that it's the two stoners plating the food. All in All a great idea but if you want a hot entre then this I'm NOT the place to eat."

Our waiter, Fay (sp?), was fantastic and completely put us at ease as we entered the dining room. The experience of entering the pitch black room was more intense than we had anticipated and Fay did a wonderful job talking us through the process. In all honestly, I imagined the food would be secondary to the once in a lifetime type atmosphere, but I would have been happy with each item served in any restaurant. I don't know if the environment elevated our senses to taste- I'm sure it did. Either way, everything was excellent. While it seems odd in a yelp review, I will not share what we ate as we opted for surprise 3 course offering. We were asked if we had any dietary restrictions or allergies and completely surprised by each dish. We are so grateful to have had the opportunity to dine with Fay at ONoir and highly recommend to others. Thank you for offering this experience and for making an impact in the lives of others."

And by dark I mean utter, complete, can't-see-your-hand-in-front-of-your-face dark. The sensory deprivation can be upsetting for some, but once you get used to it, the experience is truly fascinating! The front area of the restaurant is lit, and is where you place your orders. You're led back to the dark dining area by the wait staff, who explains how the process works. We opted for the three-course menu (appetizer, entree, dessert), which was tasty and well-priced. Our waiter was friendly as was the host in the front area. I would have given 5 stars, but they switched our appetizers, and we obviously didn't figure it out until after we started eating. The darkness made plate switching tricky...The dark dining room was also uncomfortably warm at the start of our meal, but it seemed to cool down eventually.Immediately after our meal my mindset was ""ok once, but probably never again"", but as I tell friends and family about our experience, I would do this again, especially now that I know what it will be like!"

From there you line up outside the door to enter a 'mid' room.  You put your arms on the shoulder of the person in front of you and walk in a line into the mid room (the mid room is there to ensure no light enters the main dining room).  Once everyone is in the mid room and it's dark the server takes you into the main dining room and guides you to your seat.  The food itself is excellent.  You have a choice of two items (appetizer, main or desert) for $36 or all three for $42.  All of the food everyone had at our table was excellent.  Highly recommend a visit and will return!"

We are on vacation so we don't want to make a fuss or question it to much so we just paid after the waiter told us why and what was included. This didn't match my Groupon. We think they are having Groupon to bring people in but people are no way getting a deal.Our waiter Matthew was nice, he was best part of the experience. The guy who took our drink order i dont know his name told us he is not a wine person so he doesn't know anything about The wines?! That should of been our clue to just leave.

Once your table is ready you make a line holding your waiter's shoulders and go through double doors to get to the dark room. The darkness is really impressive and disorienting. I was expecting enough light so I could see my hands in front of my face but I only knew they were there because they are attached to my body. While we were waiting for our food we were strategizing on how to use utensils and how not to make a mess (we were both wearing white lol). You have nothing else to do but to think about stuff you never think about in a normal restaurant, ""how big is our table, how do the chairs look/feel like, what do the people next me look like, do they have decorations on the walls, how big is this place, can we start a food fight, is my waiter wearing pants, etc...""Food:It was better than I expected. I got the ribs because I figured it would be easy finger food and my wife got filet because it would be easy to cut and we were both right. They were both perfectly cooked and the ribs were not the messy extra-sauce-dripping-everywhere type of ribs, which was nice in this environment.Overall:Awesome experience and it's worth trying at least once. It's a good place to eat in general but for us it was mostly about the experience. We speculate that it would be great for blind dates and maybe they should partner up with a dating sites. Note that if you don't speak French you are basically losing another sense because you have no idea what's going on around you.. (Staff speaks English)"

I've never been to an eating in the dark restaurant before and our group had a blast! Our waiter and waitress were very nice and attentive and our food and drinks came quickly. The cocktail was very yummy. The Bad: Unfortunately the food was just eh. I definitely expected higher quality food. The dark is supposed to enhance your eating experience but even the dark couldn't save this food. I ordered the beef tartar for my appetizer but the waiter accidentally gave it to someone else in my group and by the time we realized it my friend had already eaten half. I ended up with my friends Tuna Tataki. Tataki is supposed to be seared for just a second so that the outside has a crust but the inside is still raw. My tuna had no crust, was very chewy, and tasted as though it was cooked all the way through. For my main course I ordered the Lamb shank with gremolata and mashed potatoes. I definitely did not get any gremolata. My mashed potatoes had almost whole pieces of garlic. I love garlic but there was waaaay too much. The sauce on the lamb was super salty and reminded me of the gravy you would get in a nursing home. My boyfriend ordered the profiteroles with ice cream which I tried and it was actually pretty good.Go for the experience but don't expect to have a fine dinning meal."

And I said yes but I received pork is there any way I can get a discount, expecting her to take it off the bill (I do not eat it for ethical reasons and I get a stomach ache when I eat it). She then proceeded to tell me she didn't hear me specify no pork, even though both my friends heard me. She also went on to say that pork is technically a white meat. I googled it and I was correct in that pork is considered red meat, but didn't say so because I didn't want to cause a scene. It was obvious she did not want to take the dish off my bill, even though it was pricey and in my opinion she should've taken it off.

I ordered a surprise appetizer (dairy free) and a shrimp dish with a citrus dipping sauce for an entree. Gabriel wouldn't tell me anything about the dish until I finished and told him what I thought it was. In total darkness the eyes cannot relay a message to the brain ant what's being eaten and the palate is more awake. I tasted arugula, citrus vinaigrette, and what I thought was mushrooms but actually scallops!Eating in darkness is a wonderful experience.

/user_details?userid=SOdR9t79mZUrUQCRstsUyg,Jenn T.,"Delta, Canada",4 star rating,"The experience is as everyone else has said - you're eating in pitch black. A blind waiter leads you into the room and to your seat (double doors to keep out the light) by asking you to hold onto his shoulders. He asks you to put your drink close to the wall, which we supposed, was a method of minimizing spills. Only the two maison drinks (Mai Mai and Raspberry Dream) are part of the groupon. Anything else, you pay extra.Food-wise: The appetizer I ordered was amazing (Pork croquettes and pan-fried scallop - yeup, just one scallop). The entrees (Lobster Pasta) was alright - but I wouldn't go beyond that. I was initially afraid that the lobster meat amount would be small, but what ended up being the cause of disappointment was the pasta itself. The pasta was over-done, too soft, and semi-mushy. Were it not for the big lobster chunks, there would be no saving this dish.Any disappointment with the food, however, is never the focus of your attention because you're so concentrated on not dropping the fork and knife that's in your hand. I had my palms 1cm in front of my eyes and I seriously could not see anything.I went in with a groupon and still felt that the meal was pricey. Granted, there was a ""+4"" beside the Lobster Pasta option, but it would've been nice had the hostess confirmed that $4 would be added to the total surcharge for ordering the Lobster Pasta over the other entrees. Sometimes it's not clear whether the menu used for groupon users is different from the restaurant's regular menu? After the surcharges and tips, the two of us paid an additional $20 on top of the $55 groupon.Conclusion: You go for the experience, not necessarily for the food. But seriously, great experience."

The premises, a completely dark restaurant, and i mean completely dark- your eyes will never adjust to the darkness. There are no shadows, no black lights, if you close your eyes, that is exactly what you will see. Your experience begins in the very well lit bar. Where you peruse a menu and make your meal selection. You can do a two course meal of an app and dinner or a three course meal of app, dinner and desert, at a fixed price. Aside from the menu choices you can choose to be surprised as what you will receive. Not being that adventurous, i only ordered a surprise cocktail. After you place your order you are introduced to your blind server. you will place your hands on her shoulder and your partner will place their hands on your shoulders. you are taken into a transition room, when the door behind you shuts another door in front of you opens, and you will know this because your server will tell you, not because you see this door, because now EVERYTHING is in darkness. Your server takes you to your table and places your hand on the chair, she explains everything on the table, the location of your water glass, the contents of the bread plate..while you sit there and take it all in. Trying helplessly to get your eyes to adjust to the darkness, trying to find your fork, listening to other tables drop their utensils on the floor. Every time the server approaches your table, they announce their arrival, otherwise you would have no idea they were standing there. Our server was amazingly friendly, helpful and answered all our questions. I found the complete darkness to be claustrophobic, and feared my dinner partner had left me every time his side of the table feel silent. If at any point you decide dining in the dark is just too much, you can take your meal in the bar area."

This is an incredible experience, and the food is worth every penny."
/user_details?userid=hOBjl3kxWWD-m4c9U3nzWQ,Alice N.,"London, United Kingdom",5 star rating,"A truly one of a kind experience! You dine in complete darkness, and they really go out of the way to make the experience unique. Our server joked with us but also checked in the whole time to make sure we were comfortable. The sensory deprivation accentuates the taste of the food, which is already delicious- we especially enjoyed the surprise courses, where you had to guess based on taste what the food was. Overall, amazing service of great food and an experience you won't get anywhere else!"
/user_details?userid=Oo-C0qhDd3Kx5h2zPPVgtA,n k.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"A totally unique and very worthwhile experience. It's a little pricey (CA$34 for a two course, or more for 3 course) but very much worth it. You eat in the pitch black! Our waiter, Gabriel, was very helpful and funny. The food was pretty good also - just wear a shirt you don't mind getting a little messy. I ended up eating with only my hands. But nobody knew because it was dark - except for everyone reading this review."
/user_details?userid=2fX2W3owXBWE4tPGkrC01Q,Danielle F.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"This restaurant allows you to experience a meal in absolute and complete darkness. The experience is unlike anything else. The food was fantastic as was the beer. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. He explained everything in detail as to help us through the lack of sight. Really enjoyed the food and would definitely go back again. However, this experience is not for those who are claustrophobic as the lack of a sense causes a feeling of being enclosed (in my opinion)."
/user_details?userid=Z1N91kca-Ov9oGn7_sghyQ,James Y.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,Exciting experience and the food I ordered was exceptional. My gf's wasn't to her style. Also we had a server change mid meal. I don't know how that even happened it was pitch black in there but there was a lot of chatter and stimulated your other senses aside from your eyesight of course.
/user_details?userid=5dBKAgQE7F7CF-N6qRDkEQ,Cori B.,"Calgary, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been wanting to try dark dining for a VERY long time so my expectations were running high.  We don't have a regular dark dining place in Calgary and when I hear about the special events they are sold out or don't work for my life.  I went with 3 vegetarian surprise courses because that's just how I roll.  Hubs did the 3 courses of whatever you got.  I learned that the chef used to work in a vegetarian restaurant which is an extra bonus because sometimes good vegetarian food is harder to execute than animal protein. Not to set off any of the carnivores... hubs was equally enamored with his meat.Everything was quite good.  I was surpassed how accurate I was about the ingredients - may of which I don't use often and some of which I down right don't eat but really don't dislike (it's childhood trauma?).  I don't want to discuss what those are so I don't ruin anyone else's surprise but I think my momma would be surprised a certain vegetable was cleaned off my plate (I was tricked a first and then I decided I liked it enough to keep eating ). The chef was really playing with temperatures, textures, tastes and everything else to help enhance the experience of missing sight.   My husband was comically wrong... he got his protein as wrong as I think one could even manage as I don't think those particular animals taste anything alike.   I like competition and I totally won at surprise meals while blind.  Woot!  I enjoyed picking surprises because I might not have normally chosen them... I didn't like everything but it was really really fun to guess what I was tasting.ONoir was a bit different than another large chain I'm aware of because we got our own table so it really was a romantic dinner for two and not sitting around at a large table with other strangers we can't see.  It was a bit louder at times but really it was a slower Monday night and there were only a couple of others in the room.    Our server was great,  Rodrigo, and it was an honor to spend a couple hours with him.  He shared that he had lost his sight vs having adapted without it and I felt like I could much better understand his experience meeting him in his world.  At moments there was a lot of anxiety about how I'd butter my bread or find my cocktail... trivial things to my every day life and even to the other challenges blind people do through on a regular basis and it made me think.  It gave me a deeper respect and understanding for blind people and also the confidence that I could deal with a major life change like blindness if it were to happen to me too.   I think it would have cheapened the experience to have servers in night vision as  It was nice that he was there helping us orient to our tables, chairs, food and place settings. Real tricks used in everyday life for someone without sight and I'm pleasantly surprised how well I adapted. ( bonus tip:  I had to put everything back where it came from and memorize the place setting ... hubs was very random and never got the hang of the table and was always losing things or knocking a fork off the table he didn't realize was there) It takes a bit of extra server involvement to dine in the dark so it also helped that Rodrigo was just an all round great dude as he was a big part of our dinner.Not an inexpensive meal (I think we came in at about $100 for the pair), but it stands the chance of staying with me a lot longer than most good meals if that makes any sense.  Also,  I'd consider it along the lines of dinner and a show almost...  because there is definitely the experience aspect to work into the value of the night.Overall it's pretty awesome and I'd try it again when I'm back in Montreal or try another one of the styles of dark dining that are around in other cities no problem.  If you are at all inclined to give it shot I would highly recommend trying it.  I know there was another lady in the room that was almost losing it in the begining  (I've quite proud she found the courage to stay whomever that lady was..)  so I guess this isn't for everyone.  I definitely won't plan it as a surprise  without knowing it would be well received to say the least."
/user_details?userid=6EV2I-bLZKCU_NokMTZR_g,Peter B.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"This is the first time for me to dine in with ONOIR, with the completely dark environment. This restaurant serve the prefix menu , 2 courses (no dessert) , and 3 courses (with dessert).  I will give them 5 stars for over all. Food was delicious, service is absolutely more than perfect, AMAZING... Our server is Julee.  I did realize before step in to the main dining room that All servers are blind, but not sure that they are completely blind. She did a great job, she told us everything about how to eat food in the dark environment. I forgot that they will ask you to turn off cell phone , cause they don't want any light in the dining room. You can order all of course of your meal to be the surprise dishes or you can order what you wanna eat from their menu. I did choose my main course to be the surprise dish. All food is so delicious.  Also, at the end of meal, we ordered hot tea and hot coffee. She could brought all hot liquid to the table in dark environment without dropping anything. So, so, so amazing. I totally understand now how these people are in their world without any light.  I really admire the restaurant create and give these people the job to work. At least, they have some money to survive in this real world. I will absolutely go back there if I am in Montreal again. I love you ONOIR."
/user_details?userid=aNfG4yqETNKXNQgc2qTToA,Doris Z.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",5 star rating,"This was literally the best meal of my life!!!My boyfriend and I wanted to go to a different French restaurant nearby, but it was full. We walked by this place and walked in here for an casual dinner. After the waiter told us that this is the dark restaurant, we were skeptical at first but decided to give it a try. We picked the pork croquette and salmon gravlax for starter, fish of the Day and shrimps for main courses and surprise dessert. The complete darkness made our dinner absolutely amazing! Our taste bud was 100% more sensitive and exploring what's on your plate was such a special feeling. (We were using our hands to eat since no one can see us, which was something you can never do anywhere else, it was soooo fun!)This was the perfect place for a romantic dinner also! Magical would be the word to describe this experience. There were no disturbing background music, which I really love. You can really talk to each other and relax without worrying about other people looking at you. This was such a good dinner and I would recommend it to any couple! This would NOT be a good place to have dinner with your friends, but perfect for couples!"
/user_details?userid=WkAIcPWrsG_i8tNHllmfEA,Mehreen W.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"After having been to the one in Toronto, I was really impressed with the organization and menu at the Montreal one. They have a greater selection of menu items (more french-cuisine selections). It's definitely a unique experience that requires you to use all your senses except for sight, of course. Obviously, if you're someone who is anal about your food at restaurants and examines it before you eat and makes sure your meat is cooked the way you like it, etc., etc., And if you're someone who is claustrophobic and/or have anxiety about the unknown, then this type of setting would not be for you. I knocked a star because it is very expensive, dinner for 2 people can easily be around $90-150."
/user_details?userid=1B6rSBowb6AhuDGZZU9LEQ,Kebbie G.,"Providence, RI",5 star rating,"Best fucking place ever! Went last night at the suggestion of my air bnb host and honestly say can't find anywhere like this in the States! You are literally in a pitch black fucking room and once you get passed the shock of trying to find where you put your fork and figuring out where everything is on the table, your senses heighten and the games begin! Figuring out what your eating is so much fun and if you have amazing wait staff like Rodrigo and Lilly you'll be sure to have an amazing time. Shoutout to Rodrigo and Lilly for being amazing servers and for the great conversation . Cannot rave enough! Also as a note if you go do all surprises ; you're fucking in the dark so enjoy the experience and have some mystery!"
/user_details?userid=PeGqmF1U94lGP61chdctMw,Sarah P.,"Cumberland, Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,Loved everything about this restaurant. I had the surprise main paired with surprise wine. Gab was our waiter and did a fantastic job. My husband loved his main course so much that he considered ordering an additional plate instead of dessert.
/user_details?userid=2QTpk-gYv5OTKXtOOE1HnA,Henry B.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"First, I would recommend this restaurant for the experience alone. Being in a pitch black room, totally devoid of all light, for such an extended period of time is not anything I have ever encountered before. Let alone feeding yourself in the dark. O Noir made a excellent date location, although I'd be reluctant to choose it for a first date (unless you wish to have a literal blind date that could possibly be quite unnerving).Second, the food was excellent. Of course, without something delicious to devour, the O Noir experience would stand as a piece of theatre without a suitable payoff. O Noir does not disappoint. We enjoyed (and managed to share across the table) three courses that included salmon ceviche, beef tartare, lobster pasta, a surprise main course, chocolate cake, and profiteroles. Every dish impressed.Third, the staff here were so friendly and helpful. From the moment we arrived until after we left all of the staff were very approachable and put up with our many questions. Gracias Alejandro, merci Maurice, and thank you to the others whose names we did not catch."
/user_details?userid=YVHi1eJ5YNmXKUfFZ8g-Ag,Eric B.,"Saint-Lazare, Canada",4 star rating,"This is definitely a place everyone should try at least once. The meal is served in a predetermined 5 course meal, but you can choose a vegan option. They start off by serving you champagne then they walk you into the dining area which is completely black, there's no light whatsoever. I really enjoyed my experience overall. My only complaint would be that the service was a bit slow."
/user_details?userid=a6kNDYdQx9AXhDJhHKQ2Kw,Jill E.,"Mountain View, CA",4 star rating,"Fun family meal with the foodie family which included my hubby and two young adult children. The staff is friendly and do a great job of orienting you to the process. Our waitress Lily was attentive, delightful and charming. 3/4 of us went with the ""Surprise"" 3 course meal. I started with the crab salad and then went ""blind"" from there for the two remaining courses. The ""Surprise"" courses are not on the menu, so you don't need to worry about getting something on the menu that is slow selling. Lily was very conscientious in acknowledging our food allergies at our table. The food was tasty ( slightly too salty for my taste), but it was entertaining as well as challenging to share bites of food and drinks with your table mates as we like to share. The mixed drinks and wine were tasty and not over priced. Some unique combinations of food that keeps you guessing. Definitely worth trying if you like adventurous eating and a unique dining experience. We would definitely do it again! The experience 5 stars, food 4 stars, service 5 star."
/user_details?userid=bHhOIrTB8JS2NezDvC0d9Q,Ruth S.,"Arlington, VA",5 star rating,Dining in complete darkness was definitely one of the most unique dining experiences I've ever had! They show you the menu and you order before you are led into the dining area which is pitch black.  It took a few minutes of orienting myself to the table and wall for me to feel a little more comfortable. We both chose to order three course meal surprises and they were able to make mine a vegetarian surprise. The portions were a good in-between size so there was enough without it being too exhausting trying to find the food. The food was all delicious. After you head back into the light they ask what you thought you ate and we were very wrong on our guesses for everything but the salad. Definitely want to bring other friends here in the future!
/user_details?userid=Rl3sJHcN8YGL1JvmGlHomg,Eric B.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"Amazing restaurant. Took a friend of mine there on a date and couldn't have had a better dining experience, added a thrill and dynamic that neither of us knew prior to. Initially, since the room is literally pitch black, I panicked a little but our waiter (Rodrigo) did a great job on making our dinner great. Lastly, the food was incredible. I got the beef shoulder with cheesecake and my friend got the lobster pasta with a chocolate cake, everything was delicious. I HIGHLY suggest it."

All of the staff are friendly, and want you to enjoy to the fullest. There are lockers with a key that you can store your stuff in for free. We got a very nice waiter. His name is Rodrigo, if you go, I would recommend you ask for him.  After he got to know us a bit, he made some funny comments about eating in complete darkness.  The food is delicious. I asked for a surprise entree and main. You really have to feel , smell, and taste your food alot :) In the end we must have looked like cavemen eating, but who cares, no one can see! We would go again for sure!  Be aware that one of their dishes is tartar (raw beef)."

Dining in complete darkness was something I was hesitate about but I must say, I really enjoyed it. The food was amazing as well as the service.

We got the ""surprise"" menu and I think trying to navigate the dark and not knowing what you're eating enhanced the experience. It was interesting to hear the other patrons around us stumbling through the same issues and thoughts, and it was definitely something we won't forget. Our waiter was awesome and the food was just ok - not as memorable as the experience itself, but again, it's a must go place just for that."
/user_details?userid=DBe74Cp86cVHBzADisHZQA,C R.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"When we entered they took two tables ordered who arrived after our party. No apology for them either. I ordered the beet and goat cheese salad. I could have made a better salad at home. There were two pieces of goat cheese in the entire salad ( I know because I cleaned the plate because I was quite hungry after waiting for long to be served). They were out of the red snapper so I order the crab and scallop risotto.  Again I could have made a better dish myself. They used sub par scallops and crab and the risotto was over cooked. There was a bone in my dish which I almost chocked on. I have no idea why there would be a bone in a scallop crab risotto but that was a bad surprise. My date also thought her dishes were sub par. For $120 for two entrees, two mains, a desert and a drink I expect much better quality of food very disappointing."

I came here for the day before my birthday and it was great. I didn't know what to expect, so didn't have any kind of expectations. I ordered all the surprises menus. I was not at all disappointed with my option of eating something that I didn't have previous knowledge of what it was. The food turned out to be amazing, savory, fresh, and gourmet. The wine pairing was awesome too. Our waiter was very kind and was always alert in case we need something. The experience of eating in the dark it is very interesting and an adventure and experience. It makes you more aware of how someone blind feels,and to be more empathic. In general, I highly recommend this place for the experience and the food. I had the 3 course menu and don't regret at all."
/user_details?userid=IAtLQ66l8T-ebg6AZ35c-g,Sarah B.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"Such a cool experience from start to finish. We showed up an hour before our reservations for a pre-dinner drink and loved the dim-lit bar out front -- it's cute, cozy and plays great music. I'd probably go back just for another drink in the charming bar area. But the actual blind dinner was the highlight. The staff is wonderful and makes you feel so comfortable throughout the experience. Our waiter guided us to our table where we spent a few minutes feeling around to get a better idea of our set up and surroundings. We ordered the surprise menu and loved discovering our dishes and trying to pin down exactly what we were eating. Solid beer selection as well. At first, the conversation at our table focused on how interesting the completely new sensation was, but we soon got comfortable enough to almost forget the fact that we couldn't see a thing. Fascinating to hear everyone in our small group's reaction to the whole thing once we were led back out to finish our drinks and pay the bill at the bar. Each of us had a slightly different perspective, but we all agreed that we loved it and would go back for more."
