The shrimp fried rice is delicious as well. Since it's a korean-chinese restaurant, don't expect to see any tteokbokki."

The owner suggested steamed shrimp mandoo which tasted totally homemade! Waitress was very sweet and wonderful. They helped us find parking spots and gave us extra pickled radish. The owner lady treated us to a special desert she had made which was out of this world. If I am ever back in Montreal I'll definitely head straight to here!"
/user_details?userid=zXAM1pdV07PxHN7nw213oQ,Madalina S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I ordered takeout. The service was very good, the staff very nice. The food was just ok. We had the black beans noodles that I found were too cooked and pretty bland (it is the first time I have this type of plate, I don't know if they are meant to be like that). We also had a pork and noodle plate that was pretty good, but could also have used just a bit of more taste. For people eating out a lot and just wanting something in NDG, I think it is worth trying. The price is very reasonable. It is not a regular Korean restaurant though, so not the place to get your seafood pancake."

My nephews finished the noodle soup in a heartbeat! Affordable prices and clean high chairs. Great location- a walk or bus away! Will definitely go back!
