After Covid happened I was so sad to see it closed down which was the restaurant on the opposite side. Not long after the opened right across from where they used to be still serving the same food with the same quality.Truly one of the best places to get char siu,Roasted BBQ pork and duck. The prices are still very affordable for the portion size. Prices vary between $8 to $10 for a three meat it goes up to $12.Their charge see you roasted pork and dark or so juicy and well cooked. I came with my family a little late around 7 PM and the roasted bbq pork was still very crispy which is some thing I'm always worried about because usually after sitting in the window for over a few hours to a full day the skin would get soggy or mushy and it not be as crispy anymore, but their roasted barbeque pork skin was still crispy when I was eating the peas the skin I could still hear the crunch in my mouth! The white rice is soaked in the juices of the meats and topped with the traditional ginger scallion oil. If you're walking around Chinatown and you're looking for something to eat I definitely recommend this place it's very filling good portion size and the people there are very nice!"

It's tricky to find the place because pick up is at the back of the resto, but there are signs to indicate the direction, just keep your eyes peeled. Next time, will try their bbq pork!"
/user_details?userid=JoVrzT6QTcTeRmXQdQg02w,Yvette G.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I heard of this place and passed in front of it countless times over the years. And I finally tried it! Ugh. So good. The restaurant is located inside a mall in Chinatown. You order at the counter as you walk in and there's plenty of seating available.We were two to share a duck and pork plate over rice, Singapore noodles, and a wonton soup. The amount was perfect for two. My favorite of all was definitely the duck. An absolute MUST try!! The pork was also extremely delicious. I really enjoyed the wonton soup with its huge meat balls. I thought the Singapore noodles were good, but I wouldn't have them again.The two brothers who run the place were very warm and welcoming. I will definitely come back!"

/user_details?userid=fbRdDZciw4Y8pgujgbwEMg,Karen L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Probably my favourite Hong Kong Cafe in Montreal. Dobe and Andy serves real milk tea--which is pretty rare here!Strong and silky smooth!What I also like is that they have an afternoon tea menu. Reminds me of Cafe de Coral in a way. Sure the decor isn't much to look at, but the food makes up for it. Also their Asian bbq meats on rice is AMAZING! Don't forget to ask for the ginger and spring onion on the side to mix in with your rice :) At least that's how I like to do it! Oh and if you have never had Asian French toast this is an excellent place to try it!"
/user_details?userid=IMHvG_ysz6akYIM-GO18kg,Andrea D.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Love this place for their roast duck and pork dishes! Most popular dishes here are their noodle soups and rice dishes, you can pick from roast duck, roast pork, and bbq pork or a combo of all. Great flavours, homey food. Price is extremely reasonable $8-10 per dish (cash only) . They also have classic Chinese dishes, although I stick to the duck/pork combos. Restaurant is simple, no-frills. Take away is also an option. One of my favourite spots in Chinatown for local flavours. You won't be disappointed :)"
/user_details?userid=ahgcM5gvEyu8Fg0d1RFnlg,Michelle V.,"Dollard-Des Ormeaux, Canada",4 star rating,"If anybody knows me- I always order the bbq duck and roasted pork noodle soup. For those who don't like soup, you can order the rice version. IT'S CHEAP AND SAVOURY. What else can you really ask for? The only small downfall is that it's cash only. Between you and me, I never carry cash on me."
/user_details?userid=olLL4rSOwJcYn--fGisiFA,Johnny Y.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",2 star rating,I can't back talk about their food. It definitely had that old school feels when I stepped in. I ordered the classic 2 meats (Roast & BBQ Pork) over rice. First place I ever had their chopped herb sauce (Asian Chimichurri sauce) over the roast pork. Most places I've eaten usually serves that with roasted or soy sauce chicken. Why I've given them the 2 star rating. First tip. If you are a foreigner. Please make sure to have Canadian money with you. They do NOT accept any cards of sorts. Second tip. Make sure you speak or understand Chinese. Oh wait. I DO! I asked them nicely if they accept American currency. The nice lady said yes. She didn't know what the exchange rate was and spoke over me towards another co worker in Cantonese if they should just scam me? I looked up at her...without a peep. Due to how shocked I was. The meal was CAD $8. I've given her a USD $20 she returns CAD $11 and some change. So base on dishonorable services. It drops a 2. Most would've given one for the experience but I don't want to pull the chefs down base on the one employee. She even had the audacity to wish me a nice day after scamming me. Thank you lady who ran the register. Who I can only imagine is the owner of this great establishment!

The special diner is really worth it ! You buy something they give you a drink with it . I suggest you to try the cold coffee tea , it's really good . The food reminds me of the old days in china when I was eating street food after class , a lot of nostalgic feeling for me :)"
/user_details?userid=apg4zq2NocVW49x6YQA3iA,Neel L.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Go here if you want classic Chinese comfort food. The dishes are super affordable - it's soul food. I do think that the meals are a bit greasier but its what you come for. I love their BBQ pork, ramen (comes with spam so you know it's soul food) and rice noodles. I also want to try their breakfast options!This is not the place to come for on a date or anything fancy as it is a little bit rundown. You can only pay in cash as well."
/user_details?userid=qPGCe98rhNpG6JjZ3MO3ZQ,Viona C.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"I recommend coming here to satisfy your Cantonese food craving in the area. It's a lot like Big Wong and Noodletown in New York, but this is probably your best option in Montreal. It's easy to miss this place because it's in a little run down shopping mall with little to no signs outside, but it's the same building as where Kam Fung is. The food is served quickly and everything is about $10 or less. Their roast meat over rice is satisfying. Their milk tea is good as well. Service is all right. You really come here for a quick comfort meal, rather than for the service itself. It's satisfactory as they do serve you efficiently and everything is made quickly."
/user_details?userid=bQCHF5rn5lMI9c5kEwCaNA,Vincent L.,"Oakland, CA",3 star rating,"I'm surprised at the relatively high average Yelp rating here, because if this is among the best Chinese food that Montréal has to offer, then, sadly, that doesn't say much about Chinese food in Montréal. Like a true Cantonese diner, there's a large variety of offerings here, whether rice dishes, fried noodle dishes, or noodle bowls. Everything is very inexpensive, but that having been said, you get what you pay for, which might be a lot in terms of quantity, but not much in terms of quality. Indeed, I was here traveling with my Cantonese parents and they didn't have much nice things to say about the whole experience either. A cheap, inexpensive meal - and that's about all there is to say about it."
/user_details?userid=ai6Sb1iGQqJNh0w_Zo49Rg,Amy L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Decided to try this place out because my friend from McGill highly recommended it for a cheap, quick meal in Montreal's Chinatown.  This place is definitely quite run down but I don't think people come here for the atmosphere anyways. We ordered the BBQ Duck rice noodles,  Shanghai noodles, and a plate of their famous Roast pork. They seem to drench every BBQ dish (including their noodles) with a bunch of green onion sauce. It worked well with the BBQ pork but the soup noodles tasted a little strange with that much green onion. I also got their iced HK milk tea and it tasted very authentic. Overall it wasn't bad but not as great compared to the BBQ places in Toronto. I'd give it a 3.5/5 stars."
/user_details?userid=XnqY60Gvc29ehm7OH5BSrg,Sonia T.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"So good! We came here for breakfast and the food was delicious! I had read the reviews first and when we arrived I was skeptical because it's in a really quiet mall, but we decided to stay because there were Chinese customers inside and it smelled good. We ordered congee with roast duck. Wonton noodle soup with roast duck. Rice plate with roast pork and roast duck. We had no food leftover. Wonderful, friendly service. CASH only establishment. Great find!"
/user_details?userid=41XG-tkYXv7uHubdPgetJQ,Andrew N.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"Compared to Toronto (where I typically go eat Chinatown food) I wasn't too pleased by Chinatown's cuisine as it's much smaller in comparison. I actually wanted to try my friend's favourite cheap eats Chinese place and he said this place was decent. Here's my rundown:Food - I got one of their BBQ pork and rice to-go. The rice I felt was a little mushy and definitely had too much water in it and it was drenched in green onion oil (way too much green onion as seen in the picture). I need appreciate the bok choy veggies and the meat itself was comparable to Toronto BBQ pork, but the rice was underwhelming and that combined with the drenched green onion oil felt like too much.Atmosphere -The place looks a little rundown and definitely old fashioned. It reminds me of a food court dining area as it's located inside a building and can easily be missed.Service -Can't comment on the service here as I got takeout but it was ok. There was definitely a language barrier here but I try to dismiss that in my rating.Price -Price was good for what you get. It was around 6-7 dollars for this meal which was a good price. Verdict -Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place for its watery rice and too much green onion oil. The pork was ok and the bok choy was steamed alright so if you were to get this dish, I'd take it easy on the green onion oil and ask for fried rice instead (or another grain that's not as watery). There are better options that I've tried in Montreal's Chinatown though."
/user_details?userid=3kC5dUeBl32ZOrnDOzjasg,Olivia T.,"Durham, NC",3 star rating,Had duck and chicken over rice. Tastes just ok. Portion is big. They ran out of BBQ pork. So I don't know how the pork tastes like. But duck is too salty. Chicken is a little bit better.
/user_details?userid=V9iE_aW4QvqcqVKp-ssLfg,Jeff T.,"Côte Saint-Luc, Canada",2 star rating,"I have to be honest, the food is not bad but sanitation and better service is very much needed. Came here a while ago, and was served by the middle aged woman. Me and my friend were almost done eating and were talking about what we wanted to do later. This waitress decided to start removing the dishes on the floor, and wiping the table. She accidentally knocked down water all over my pants which were completely soaked. We were nice as customers, and tipped a food amount, but honestly though, she really should have been more careful. The old woman that chills in front of the cash register glared at us to make sure we were going to tip them good. I had an overall bad experience here."

/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Montréal overall has a lack of really good Chinese food compared to Toronto, Vancouver, and even where I'm from back in Michigan (shocker, right?). Anyway, I was really surprised to find really authentic Cantonese ""tea room""-style food in such a space like this. Whenever I come here, I either get the 干炒牛河 (stir-fried noodles with beef in a black bean sauce) and 桂林炒米线 (Guilin stir-fried spicy rice noodles). The 干炒牛河 is arguably the most authentic I've had outside of China, but being a spice lover, I tend to gravitate towards the Guilin rice noodles, which they can also make into a noodle soup (桂林米粉) if you prefer them that way!Previously, I've also had their roast meat (they have duck, chicken, and pork to choose from) over rice, and while it was good, I've had better in Guangzhou (roast goose over rice is still something I find myself craving almost a year and a half later). They also serve a good milk tea, and if you get the lunch special, it comes with a drink so consider getting that with your food!"

You walk nonchalantly past it like you usually do. THEN YOU STOP. You notice Dobe and Andy's to your right not really sure what to make of it. The duck calls to you. Can you dig it? Well you can at Dobe and Andys for $6 with a full complementary meal of veggies and rice. A simple, yet delicious meal that reminds me of Home-cooking. Indulge in the simple things in life."

It kinda looks likes a food court. Also, the place is a little hard to spot cause it's inside a building and there's not too many signs that make it stand out.FOOD: Classic Chinese comfort food. That means that it's nothing fancy, it's not the highest quality but it's quick and yummy. Although I did find the dishes inconsistent. It was either a bit too salty or too bland but overall, it was good! I'd come back here again if ever I'm in a rush to get a quick meal.PRICE: Super inexpensive. I'd say most of the menu is under 10$, no matter what time of day it is. Although you are getting what you pay for so  I would say that quality is not the best but it's a nice spot for a quick cheap meal.SERVICE: The service was quick and the waiter did what he had to do. For Chinatown, the staff was decent!"

/user_details?userid=TifhAmaec6Qol7Y1UmO-hQ,Billy C.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"The Worst Service and the dirtiest restaurant -Restaurant Dobe & Andy 滿地可楓林茶餐廳My sister went there for 2 order of drinks just to kill time. It costs $3.8 tax included. She paid $5 with coins ($2 + $2 + $1) as she does not have a $5 bill. The cashier gave back 20 cents only as change and told my sister - I DO NOT NEED TO GIVE YOU MORE AS YOU ONLY GAVE ME $4. The cashier miscounted that my sister only gave $4 for the drinks. Of course, my sister argued that it was $5 instead of $4, but the cashier did not listen.In Canada, normally we pay 15% tips. Of course, it is not mandatory. If you get bad service, you do not have to pay the extra 15%. No matter what, even the customer did not pay enough tips; she, the cashier, should always give the change back.The food is ok, but it is very dirty. Do not expect any service inside. The restaurant only looks for money and have no ethnic code. Very cheap and immoral place."

Just through the doors of Place Quartier, lies an unassuming Hong Kong cafe that serves up Cha Chang Tang style foods just like I remember it in Hong Kong. I always get the BBQ pork and soya sauce chicken rice. They cut their meats fresh from the butcher shop right across their restaurant. The sauce is always incredible. Chicken - tender. All at around $7-8! Great value.Highly recommend to get milk tea (remember to add sugar!) With any special for just 50 cents!"

Only a very average Chinese Bistro but I always love the free Hong Kong style milk tea come with the meal.Recently I found the quality of the food dropped.Have to admit that the price is low but the quality of the food is poor. The tableware is dirty sometime. I also experienced twice they charged me higher price since they have two sets of menu. One for special time period, and one for the other time period. I also found other people complaining about the wrong price charged. Be sure to double check the bill. I always have fish congee here because the congee took me a very long time to cook at home. My husband often has BBQ rice, but he is very reluctant to eat here.It is OK to try this place when you are looking for a filling meal and low price but don't hold a high expectation. I am just very unhappy today they charged me higher price again."
/user_details?userid=EaBKe-8LB-NHuH7Us-QhGw,Vincent V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A typical Hong Kong ""Tea Restaurant"", they have a very diverse menu and make most of their dishes very well.My personal favourite is their rice noodle stir fried with beef and soya sauce (#G on the lunch menu If I recall correctly), any of the fried vermicelli dishes, Fried rice with fermented crab sauce and beef, Salted fish and chicken fried rice and the Roasted pork and duck on rice, albeit I always order it with pork belly, which is an extra. They put garlic and chive cooked in oil on top of it, which makes it particularly succulent. They probably have the best Milk Tea in the city, made with real tea leaves, and their cold Lemon Tea ain't half bad either. Great lunch spot."

This place brings you straight back to Hong Kong. Its a typical Cha Can Ting, serving typical cantonese food: roast meat, authentic wonton noodles, etc and it is dirt cheap!! You can get a selection of two roast meat with some boiled vegetables and rice for roughly $7. Make sure you ask for their marinated green onion (it usually comes with the roast meat dishes), its the best!Try to stay away from items on the menu that do not sound authentic (e.g. Singapore noodles, curry, etc)."

/user_details?userid=DPcJ_uf07HgSP-f-noeV_g,V T.,"Springfield, VA",3 star rating,"Arrived here early in the morning, unfortunately before any of the BBQ meat was available. We had to ask the waiter to point out what was available at that time, which he was able to. They serve you with cups of hot tea to go along with your meal which is a very traditional Chinese thing to do, and I don't see this done often enough.*Stir fried beef egg noodles: This is like ""pad see ew"" at Thai restaurants. Wide rice noodles stir fried with beef slices and vegetables. Very large portion, greasy, savory, and satisfying. Easy to eat even for people not familiar with Chinese food.*Breakfast special (congee with fried noodles): For $5.75 you get a big bowl of steaming hot congee with a plate of fried noodles (without meat). We chose the ground pork with preserved egg for our congee. The congee is very lightly flavored and I feel the rice was not broken down enough for this style, but it was a good dish nonetheless. The fried noodles are okay, no meat, taste exactly the way they look.Overall this place is ""good"" and it does come across as a tad basic based on my experience during breakfast, but I may be biased because I didn't get to try the BBQ meat that everyone on Yelp raves about. Short of that observation, as an Asian-Canadian who grew up in Toronto, this place absolutely cannot compete with what we have down there.Also - who charges tax and then takes cash-only? I hate that this restaurant has this policy."

May come in early to try the congee at breakfast sometime. The service was really great, all smiles and very efficient.

/user_details?userid=8zTgQO2jEWqZHqpN1bZyJA,Cheryl B.,"Round Hill, VA",4 star rating,"You know you've hit the ""real thing"" when you enter the building that houses Dobe and Andy!!  An office building serves as the backdrop for this incredible culinary experience.  I'm all about glistening well cooked pigs, ducks and chickens hanging in the windows....the almost candied apple appearance of the succulent skin of these animals makes my mouth water just thinking about it!I promised one of my co-workers lunch while in Montreal on business last week and had him choose the spot....and let me tell you I was NOT disappointed.  The place was not overly crowded but abuzz with lots of conversations that I could not make out, because any of the Oriental languages are not my norm.  Obviously a hot spot because if the locals eat there, and you could tell there were plenty of regulars, it has to be good.Dan recommended his favorite dish of rice, steamed baby bok choy topped with the most generous slices of a combination of pork and duck.  Warm tea, not sweet, was served in brightly colored tupperware style cups...you know the ones, right?  Chopsicks and a ceramic soup spoon so you can scoop as fast as you like were served on the side.  No need for seasonings....it was juuuuust right!At a hair over $5 per person, we rolled out of there fully satisfied and ready for a nap.  If you find yourself in Montreal...by all means head to Chinatown specifically to Dobe and Andy's and enjoy!"
/user_details?userid=urKIN42uSs5WTWyo-xOh7A,Lana L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,I read a review a d decided to order....everything is horrible... Beef with rice...no beef only fat and some kind of cabbage... Soup no taste at all.... Singapore noodles salty....spring rolls just awful... Not sure what people liked at that place... Very disappointed...
/user_details?userid=_ojGqHo6cYRtoT2Z9ptUqQ,Connie L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I've had Cantonese BBQ in Hong Kong and this place is definitely on par. We got the duck and pork noodle soups and it was so delicious. The restaurant is located in a office/shopping mall which made it a little difficult to find but it was really worth it. A must try in Montreal Chinatown.

/user_details?userid=4ukZcUTZlhwKlojm8c1ozA,Isabella L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"After being introduced to this little place, my boyfriend and I are smitten. We're always looking for excuses to go to Chinatown so we can stop by and have their really tasty ""dong-lai-cha"" (cold milk tea) or ""dong-ling-cha"" (cold lemon iced tea). Unfortunately, they close really early at night (7pm), so it's only really good for lunch or mid-afternoon snack. Everybody's friendly and the food is reasonably priced. It's definitely worth it for the amount of food you get. You will never leave with a stomach empty!"
/user_details?userid=2LptcvhkcFyNXT_NZDPpaQ,Luca M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Dobe and Andy is the furthest you get from a typical chinatown touristy haunt. This means it's already scored a point.The setting is that of a dingy diner and the place is quite certainly a no-frills joint. But do not let the Chinese-only specials menu and the green tea in plastic cups deter you.I second the pork and duck combo, as well as the Shanghai fried noodles and the soy sauce chicken with rice.I found our server struggling a little with translating the specials menu (breakfast specials, $3.75, lunch specials in the $5 area). At the same time the smiles and enthusiasm completely compensated for the slight language barrier. The food, price and setting alone would earn it three stars (not a place you'd bring a date), but the service is so great I give it the four. Will be back!"

/user_details?userid=K13Y0nQfqS3CxXjPXqW8ww,Virginia B.,"Fairfield, CT",4 star rating,We found Dobe and Andy after our first restaurant choice was closed.  With a few recommendations from our very nice waitress we were pleasantly surprised with how delicious everything was. Even my picky 10 & 8 year old boys said they loved their meals. The roasted duck on both rice and noodles was a big hit. The spring rolls were yummy as were the dumplings.  Very authentic and extremely reasonably priced. Only catch is it is cash only which we didn't discover until time to pay and had to run to a very close cash machine. We enjoyed our meal.
/user_details?userid=6-1XSOw9dZ1KTbzCnSXC_w,Nikolaos N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I enjoy dropping in to Dobe & Andy for a quick and cheap bite to eat. I absolutely adore their duck soup and will keep coming back for that exact meal. They're located in the same complex that Maison Kam Fung   is located in. If your hungry and short on cash you can always count on Dobe & Andy to fill you up.
/user_details?userid=gKin_-NtLP6j7ULK7G6nVA,Sonnie B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Giving this restaurant full points since the food is tasty, simple but comforting, comes in a generous portion and is not expensive - what you want when you`re very hungry. I usually like the noodle soups (BBQ duck or Wonton), but recently discovered the BBQ duck and chicken rice which I really liked. Service is also rapid and the waiter is very amiable and polite. If you go at non-peak hours, they will usually refill your tea as often as needed. I`ll definitely be going back to this place, but maybe next time to try their breakfast or late lunch specials now that they have printed new menus with translations."
/user_details?userid=IryDYja2kFkQEYJ0Kw6GWw,S. S.,"Bloomington, IL",4 star rating,The only vegetarian lunch option (Buddha Vegetarian Rice or Fried Noodles) was very good. A huge amount of food and good flavor for a vegetarian dish. Slightly more expensive than the menu price though. Overall a great lunch and the price is still great. I was surprised there was a vegetarian option at all.
