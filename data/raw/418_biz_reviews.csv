/user_details?userid=YUlBxBTPMPM3mawg4Opuvw,Haque I.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Totally loved the food. We went there before the lockdown started again and it was the last in person restaurant visit we had :(The food was yummy and generous in portion. We tried the fresh salad option and it was so good! The kababs were great as wellWill definitely go back once things get back to normal again

My favourite thing to order is their omnivore plate (chicken and fattoush salad) and a side of fresh pita bread. They include both hummus and garlic sauce in the omnivore plate so it's quite complete. Good portion and price. Most of the time it's quite good, a few times it was a tad disappointing as the chicken was ok the drier side (but it's not so bad). Most of the time however, I'm very happy with my meal. I do recommend it!"

The value you get is incredible.My friends and I each ordered a plate and they don't play around with feeding you. I ordered the carnivore plate and enjoyed the chicken more than the beef. I swapped out the rice for salad so that no one would think i was carb loading for a race. We had a basket of pita to share to dip our toum and hummus that camr with our plates and free lemonade (there is some rosewater in it so if you don't like rosewater, you might want to pass) as freebies too.I was surprised they made their hot sauce with scotch bonnets but was thoroughly impressed how much heat it packed while managing to taste fruity. I liked the hot sauce so much i bought one to take home. $7 for a jar of store made sauce is a pretty fair price. I think they have 2 locations in Montreal and think it is a must try for vegans, vegetarians and carnivores alike"

This place was really highly rated so we decided to give it a try. We walked in and picked our seats. The ambiance was pretty nice and well presented. Our server was very kind and always super attentive. My boyfriend ordered the Bombay Sandwich combo with beer and lentils soup. The lentils soup was so delicious and was also prepared really well (definitely would recommend) The sandwich on the other hand was surprisingly sweet and was not my favorite. My boyfriend didn't really like it much either and said it was too sweet! We also ordered the Carnivore with 2 beef skewers and 1 chicken skewer. This dish was definitely much better than the sandwich! The beef was really tasty and with the hummus paired with the bread it was a great combination. Though I was not a fan of all the lentils that were given.I would say this place is a 3.5/5 borderline 4 though I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to eat here again!

The meat plates were huge. We had two sandwich combo. On the menu it is 11.5$ with sandwich and salad and a lemonade. However, I was charged 12.5$ for I had a classic sandwich, this was not printed on the menu. I suggest you add a line on the menu. We had Thaï and SHISH TAWOOK, very tasty. The salad was fresh. Lemonade very good."

Every bite feels like it is bringing you to a different place and fills you with all emotions all at once in the best way possible. There is noooooo place better than omnivore and you are just going to have to take our word for it. If you are wondering where to eat, EAT HERE!! I could LIVE here, eat here every morning and night. I want to become one with the food. It is so good. I can't express it enough."

/user_details?userid=uk4OZ0fjtkuzfFxbChq0Xw,M T.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Not impressed. The pics online looked good but the chicken is done flat plate style - Not a fire grilled. Same for all the other meats which my friend ordered. The fatoush salad was flat and tasteless. The babaganoush VERY watery and also tasteless. They are cutting corners watering down a dip! I won't go back. There are so many other middle eastern style restaurants in Montreal that are much better who make tastier food using a myriad of spices. Omnivore just hasn't mastered the spice game yet.
/user_details?userid=e2X8PwOer6LcANjXiCt9cw,Chris H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I tried Omnivore randomly on Uber Eats and couldn't believe how great the food was. The next time I was close by I had to eat there in person. The food was even better straight from the kitchen to the table.I had the Omnivore plate for $13 and substituted my rice for the Jazzar salad $1. My friend had the Herbivore which is a mix of 5 salads for $11.The portions here are huge and we gleefully packed it all down in record time. Honestly we almost licked out plates clean.It's truly the best middle eastern food I've eaten outside of the middle east (and better than most I ate there too)!
