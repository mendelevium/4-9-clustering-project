/user_details?userid=PbFGyFDcWYve_uXmjjnXUQ,Emily D.,"Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,The food is delicious and the employee who served us was really friendly. She drew a cute picture on our takeout box and she gave us free chocolate cake. Excellent service and food would recommend 100% :)
/user_details?userid=Uq4wucZLfJTpcwSA811yAQ,Amy K.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"I am Korean and let me tell you. This resto is the BEST KOREAN RESTO experience I've had in Montreal. I've tried all famous Korean restos in the city ""Omma to gandara to kantapia to all NDG places"" The food here is just lovely and tasty. I've ordered some stews, fried stuff and bulgogi (beef). They were all great. You can tell that they use very fresh ingredient. Staffs are so friendly. Â The price is super for the food (I am actually doubting how they would maintain their business since the food is really cheap for plateau area). I wish them the best! (because...I will be regular here! ) highly recommend."
/user_details?userid=VUS9-ABMF37mbHG5aMaaZw,Gabriella F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Amazing discovery! The food was delicious, the place was cute and small and the service not bad.I got the fried chicken platter with a sweet sauce and green onion salad. I don't mind that there wasn't any rice because I find its just a filler. My boyfriend got this interesting Korean looking lasagna, that's how it looked. Layers of noodles, spicy sauce, vegetables, rice sticks and cheese. Honestly it was amazing. They even had takoyaki! Which is so hard to find! The only negative point is that the service was pretty slow. It took a while to get our food even if the place was half full. I would definitely go back though!"
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is my favorite Korean place in Montreal. I've had countless dinners and some lunches there. Their sundubu is the best, literally the best one I've had in Montreal. I also love their takoyaki and friendly service. They now have beer and wine on the list, so that deserves an extra star ;) Seriously, it's a must if you like Korean food."
/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,Not a huge selection but all the necessary items are on the menu.Didn't seat in to eat so can't judge the service. Took 3 dishes to go and all 3 were pretty good. The seafood tofu stew wasn't that spicy and flavour was good. Had 2 giant shrimps in and a few pieces of calamari. Japchae was also good...not too salty.The chicken wings were very crispy and juicy.Price is fair.
/user_details?userid=wOb0jXjR6HJLXzi702kqkg,Amelia R.,"Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Went there with a Korean friend. She gave 5 stars of out 5 to this restaurant. I tried Seafood Sundubu. It's OMG good!!!! Can't wait to go back again!!! It's definitely a MUST-GO!
/user_details?userid=E2oq_BwdQmq_Vyte65icNg,Emeline V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"First time at Hoya and already a pattern is emerging: between every sentence, every bite, we'd look at each other ""This is really good you should try this"". All night long! So between bites of everything, I can tell you Hoya is delicious! After a long wait, we split the eggroll entrees which came piping hot. I had the Paejon with tofu - the first time I see the dish offered with tofu, yay! Rich, filling, nomnomnom. The beef bulgogi was really excellent, and a week later I still remember it. You know the place is good because they are Korean, and Korean families were eating all around us. That being said, I draw the line at Korean music, it too was all around us, and it was one heart-crushing ballad too many. It seems like Hoya low-key really wants to become a karaoke place, with the glass partition and little lights on the ceiling. For the moment, they are a kick-ass restaurant and I am happy."

Been coming here for a year now and I truly have nothing, but good thing to say. The staff is really nice (especially the main lady who works there (I wish I knew her name)). Me and my friend come here often. Would highly recommend. Good food, very tasty!"
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Excellent food. Excellent service. I have been ordering food from here since it opened up and I crave it every few days!! My favourite thing to eat from here is Dakgangjung; Korean sweet chilli sauce flavoured crispy fried chicken with Rice!! Definitely one of the better Korean places in Montreal.
/user_details?userid=WkAiFAJMI7aZPjFqMvsGbA,Sarah R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The food really was amazing - definitely 5 stars. We had the dumplings as an appetizer. I enjoyed the crispy fried chicken. It was cooked perfectly, was a great balance of spicy and sweet, and a huge portion! My husband had the bulgogi which was also a nice sized portion and served with rice and salad.The issue was that we waited FOREVER for our food - I think it took an hour from when we sat down to when we received our appetizer. After that, things sped up, and we were offered a complimentary miso soup in recognition of the delay. For whatever reason, the restaurant was having trouble keeping up with the customers, to the point that they closed their doors earlier than normal. Given the very high quality of the food, I will definitely give them another try and hope that the slow service was a fluke!"
/user_details?userid=gDeacL_V-4Pjb0jVHOpT7w,jewel c.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"This is my first time eating at a Korean restaurant in Montreal. I am used to having many side dishes (banchan) in NYC so was surprised with just a side of fresh kimchee. However, I was pleased with the main dish. I ordered the fish cake soup and my friend the stone bowl bibimbap, it came with a small side of miso soup. Everything was made well. This place is built suitable with the French Canadian in mind in my opinion. Not too much food but just the right amount. Water was served in wine glasses. Big spoons that are usually not used in a Korean household. The interior of this corner restaurant showed some traditional paintings coupled with the modern glass artwork, with cute figurines from Korea. They also have an appetizer menu and dessert menu. It is dimly lit. Casual but not too casual."
/user_details?userid=voFxNdzhG-cDrW_9NzFGbw,Denzil D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"A new Korean place in my hood? Excellent. Now I was a bit worried with the history of average restaurants in this building but we had to try. We tried the Sundubu sea food stew and the Jeyuk Deopbab (spicy pork) which came with rice and salad. The service was nice, prompt and attentive. I enjoyed the pork dish very much, it was spicy as promised and the Stew was very good too. I am very happy to have this option so close, since our favorite Korean is in Westmount. I think it might be 4 stars but it will have to wait until I come back and try the Korean BBQ and the........... Korean fried chicken. Yes, sweet...so excited to have Korean fried chicken in the hood. Stay tuned."
/user_details?userid=M0gkUA6Q092bzfebvEThGQ,Hannah W.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,THIS IS MONTREALS BEST KEPT SECRET. Hoya is so wonderful and such a treat. Every dish is better than the last - the food is so hot and to fresh and tastes like it is made with all the best ingredients and so much LOVE. the service is exceptional and the bibimbap is a highlight. Also the pork hot plate and the dak fried chicken is unbelievable! Go here and support this amazing business!
/user_details?userid=-4pYtFJbZYzKqmiOjGr4ag,Albert N.,"Mile End, Canada",5 star rating,Finally a good Korean restaurant in the Plateau!!Delicious Korean food with great variety and of course classics. Must try in the area.
/user_details?userid=c7C5QziJbx6JOnQFiOxUXQ,Youri H.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"YOU WILL ENJOY YOUR MEAL HERE. Trust me. WHY? Because the food is amazing, duh. ALSO, the service is exceptional. AND DID I MENTION that the food is incredible? OH, I DID... well there's no harm in saying it again. THE FOOD IS REALLY TASTY GUYS. The most important thing though, is that everything about the experience feels like it was made with love. The meals, the music, the chairs, the cutlery... it was all made to make you feel good about yourself and encourage you to be your best. NO, SERIOUSLY. You will leave this restaurant a better person. And at the end of the day, isn't self-improvement what life is all about?"
/user_details?userid=xZCVxM7KS49Jj2F_CiiRmA,A. R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Had 3 dishes here and all were really good. The spicy pork stew was thin slices of fairly lean pork served in a rich sweet spicy gravy. Spice factor was like 4 chilies out of 10, it was very flavorful but not very spicy. The spicy fried chicken was served in a tangy sticky tomatoey sauce, was delicious but also not too spicy, maybe like 5 chilies out of 10. Lastly the seafood pancake. It was perfectly cooked (tender inside not raw, hot and crispy outside) and served on a wooden board to keep it from getting soggy. Perfect balance of seafood and veggies to batter. Service was pretty attentive throughout even though most tables were full. Though it did take a while to get our first dish, the food was piping hot and fresh.5 stars to reflect satisfaction with food quality, friendly efficient service, variety of dishes on the menu, ambience and value. Everything was delicious and I'll come back here."
/user_details?userid=lDSwCgPW0FjJL2L3IJaz9A,Audrey P.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4 star rating,Pretty good place. I had the seafood soondubu and it came out nice and boiling hot with a side of rice. It's a chill place and wasn't super crowded when I went. The waiter was incredibly kind and chatted with us. The only thing I wish they had was more appetizers in the beginning. Quite new to see that they only gave us seaweed and kimchi.
/user_details?userid=6UZq1eXQb3aDWGKgaVjekg,Sylvie C.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,"Recently started to work around the area and went there to eat lunch a few times. Every time, I ordered something different and they were all very good. The best is the dolsot bibimbap so far. Service is very good."
/user_details?userid=QxWTFqzb_mgM6j5_AMMY9A,Laureanne R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Finally a decent Korean place on Mont Royal! Sure it was not crowded but it was a Tuesday night and it's newly open. The deco is chic which I didn't expect. Service was very good too. Tteobokki were ok, dolsot bibimbap was really good. I would come back again even though the ambiance was a bit stiff. I guess it just needs more time to get known."
/user_details?userid=uluaWZj04vfldDEoaIvOhg,Rachel F.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Decent food. Had the bibimbap , fried shrimp and beef bulgogi. Pretty good except for the rice that was more under cooked than I like.No liquor license."
/user_details?userid=QYC3HlU2lVeocJSU_UP73A,Alex Catherine L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"It's one of the rare korean place in the Plateau so we were really happy to try it. It just opened so it is pretty quiet (we were the only two customers in the place the whole time on a tuesday night from 8 to 9 pm). Unlike the other korean restaurants, they don't blast kpop on tvs, so if you're looking for that, it is not the right place. The food was pretty good (we had tobokki and bibimbap). I don't think it would be part of my top korean restaurants but as the only one around the plateau, it is a pretty good spot."
/user_details?userid=g9uKgUHrMa0rv5-m0muZHA,Owen C.,"Dartmouth, Canada",4 star rating,This was a great Korean spot!! We tried the bim bim bap and the spicy fried chicken. Both were amazing!! Hardly any wait at all.
/user_details?userid=ZKb3wiFJAxpDhVGW3br7lg,Edward N.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This place was great. Â Our table ordered five different dishes and they were all really good - Dolsot Bibimbap, ailes de poulet, sundubu, kimchijjigae and the mango tart. Â Prices were also more than reasonable and the inside well decorated and clean. Â Very much recommended if you are looking for good authentic Korean food at a reasonable price and in a good setting."
