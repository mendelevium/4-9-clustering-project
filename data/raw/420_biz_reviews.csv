/user_details?userid=wsT8ixKpghlsnTRsPA6RXg,Daniel S.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,Alto's is all time great delivery. It got me through university. Still always get it when I go back. Was so glad it re opened the new location is great!
/user_details?userid=MOOBu3osXdaNQjNN8UYusw,Chan N.,"Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This past Saturday, I got the small Alto Poutine that came with bacon, pepperoni, mushrooms, and red peppers. Wow, what I got was considered a small? I wonder what large would have been like.It was still steaming after I walked to Place-des-Arts to sit and eat. The fries stayed crispy throughout eating it. It did just fine for filling my tummy and was yummy, though it's not the best or the worst poutine I've had.Additionally, I would recommend the pizza. The Meatballs & Red Peppers pizza was superb and one of my favorite pizzas I've tried downtown.Lastly, I'm glad the cashier listened when I asked for napkins and no plastic utensils.Definitely check this place out if you live or are around the McGill Ghetto!"
/user_details?userid=IiFqAnURXyM8HVW8xKsrxw,Jessica K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Finally tried Alto's again since it's re-opening and was really satisfied with my visit. New location is directly across the previous restaurant, conveniently situated near student residences and McGill's campus. It's really spacious, with plenty of tables and an open kitchen concept. From burgers to souvlaki to pasta to dessert, they've got a huge variety of homey, diner-like foods. Despite the longer than average waiting time, the food really hit the spot. I'm a fan of the chicken souvlaki plate and my friends swear by the el Diablo burger. The fries that come with the dishes taste like Costco fries (the deep fried heavenly kind) and the serving sizes are generous. It's open till the wee hours in the morning (4-5am) so it's a great alternative to your average fast food joints."
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Alto is a well-known and popular spot for students around McGill. Since the fire a few years ago, it re-opened as a newer, bigger place, with a nice terrasse and cool mural. The menu is diverse, comprising of Italian, diner and fast-food classics such as pasta, burgers, poutine, etc. We dropped by for dinner and opted for the club sandwich and the chicken parmigiana sub. Food came fairly fast but was underwhelming. The chicken was cut into strips, which made each bite uneven (some bites had little to no chicken). There was a generous layer of melted mozzarella cheese, but it wasn't enough to compensate for the rather bland tomato sauce. The club sandwich had a generous layer of ham, and absolutly delicious fries. I'm a great fan of McDonald-style fries, and Alto's were very similar. I finished the fries in no time and that was my favorite part of the meal. The worst part was the coleslaw, which was cut so thin that the cabbage had the texture of wet yarn.Service was very nice but the food was just ok. I doubt they can optimize everything on their menu when there's more than 100 items!"

Service was also satisfactory. They also had complimentary wifi. Didnt get a chance to taste the dessert but everything looked good too.
/user_details?userid=pwIZ8XOrHgBNZaqLsfke3g,Kathy D.,"Fort Pierce, FL",3 star rating,My husband had a gyro and fries he said were good. I ordered the eggplant parmesan with pasta and tomato sauce it didn't come with bread or salad and was very bland. The eggplant was grilled and very tough I would not recommend this dish.
/user_details?userid=CfOe7l2uY2J6d04ZWSoo4Q,C. A.,"Cambridge, MA",3 star rating,"Late night standard diner with fast delivery.  The food isn't fantastic but it is average diner fare.  The menu is large and the restaurant open very late, making it a good option downtown for students working or studying late.  Portions are generous for the price."
/user_details?userid=swx0FJkZWb6nVP58ZsMl7w,Meng Z.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"I highly dislike this place. Located in the middle of the McGill ghetto, it is a local Montreal style diner that serves late night food to a huge student population. It is very popular amongst students but I really don't understand why. Their poutines are made with soggy fries, shredded cheese (no cheese curds!!!) and a very bland sauce. Their pizzas tastes like store bought pizza dough with some vegetables and processed meat added to it. I have yet to have something that tastes good from Alto. I definitely do not recommend, if you are craving late night food, you are better off with chef on call down the street."
/user_details?userid=w-gL6px0iCRb8lJcEFXzlA,Tamim S.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"Terrible service on delivery. Ordered at midnight to get a pasta without a single hint of salt. Eating in their service is average. Most items are blunt but edible. Overall, the place can be summed up as an overpriced ghetto diner."
/user_details?userid=1V7883W5i_F3mptabTXFIw,Sarah S.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"Seriously needs to put more salt in their food. I only come here during late nights when everything else is closed. Thr serving size is huge, the delivery is fast and efficient. But the food doesn't taste that great."
/user_details?userid=aYL7qtwOMdzYayaddq_Hnw,CT M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Great Service and Late Night Eats.While in many respects, Alto's is a bit of a generic Montreal-style diner, it stands out in terms of its customer service. I've ordered in from here in years, and the staff has always been polite, courteous, competent, and efficient. Indeed, any time there's been an issue with my order, it's been rectified quickly and at no additional charge.And while their fare certainly isn't legendary, their late-night delivery is well worth the experience when you need something greasy and comforting in the late night hours.I'd recommend the Chicken Parmesan Sub or Burger any late-night of the week."
/user_details?userid=ws6wpoOFtyeotIebsUXkbg,Jasmine R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We've ordered from Altos so many times it's not even funny. If you want late night delivery, this place is for you. Honestly everything tastes just OK and we've tried almost everything on the menu. But this place isn't trying to be anything it isn't. I would say order if you're in a bind or really love pub food. The staff and reception is really friendly though. My partner usually likes the burgers and if we make any special requests ie fries well done they always do it right. Very prompt service.Bottom line: food isn't great but it's not pretending to be. Really friendly staff and quick delivery. Open late."
/user_details?userid=IJL_HL_8q5lRl3Mw2XFWZw,Angelina Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The delivery is quick, and the guy is nice. They pick up the phone pretty quickly. However the mist important part for a restaurant is its taste. I would say the taste is just OK.I ordered wings and cheese pizza. The wings are not very crispy (maybe because of the delivery...), and there are too much tomato sause, and the flavour of the cheese is very plain.But one good thing is that they open everyday, and until very very late.Overall, this is not a have to try restaurant, but it is good when you are too lazy to cook while other restaurants are already closed."
/user_details?userid=iPemyqGqb2bTzZpmLKwv3Q,Kaixin Z.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,One of the best places to get food after 12am. Spent many drunken nights here in first year. Get the poutine or fish n' chips and it'll cure any hangover. Waiters are all pretty friendly! (Just don't let your overly wasted friend puke cuz they weren't too happy about that one.)
/user_details?userid=nicGnkYxQLXQFHAcNp4rsA,Steve X.,"Austin, TX",4 star rating,"This place has some great poutine. Their poutine is very different from other places in that their cheese are not in curds or curdy at all, it is melted goodness.They also have great subs. This is place you would go if you are not sober or you are craving unhealthy and comfort food. Staff is pretty nice and like i said, food is above average compared to other fast food places. Just wish they would stop increasing their price."
/user_details?userid=_t_duMQttntnMRneY6lZ3g,Kathy B.,"Hampton, NH",2 star rating,"I can best describe this as ""drunk food"". If you're drunk and it's late and you don't have a ton of money, this is a good bet. A mish mash of different types of food. Again, perfect of you're drunk with a crowd. Chicken pita was smothered in sour cream. The spaghetti with meat sauce was totally overlooked and poorly drained. There was water on the plate."

Definitely  we wont go back again"
/user_details?userid=8_A_OdF_OS_PHHyDE2GiZw,Jay D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I have to update my review its really the best late delivery place.Sometimes the guy who takes the ordered is going to recommend exactly what you want and it's always worth it.
/user_details?userid=P_4BzZ25zZ0joh_Bq7sLOA,Lauchlin M.,"Halifax, Canada",4 star rating,"Alto has some of the best pizza in Montreal. It's a common complaint among my friends from other cities that it's next to impossible to find decent pizza for a reasonable price in this city, but Alto is up there with the best I've had anywhere. The rest of the food is great, too. I couldn't even estimate the number of late night poutines I ate here while I was in school. The only problem is that they don't deliver to my new neighbourhood, but nobody else does either, so I can't blame them."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",3 star rating,"This place is old school and full of undergraduate late night memories. Open late and with fast delivery, Altos answers the desperate munchie driven cry of Montrealers small and wide. Eating in is, you know... brightly lit, tough waitresses with sideways smiles, plastic chairs, big pitchers of ""beer"" (no options. just beer.) and that classic Montreal mix of GreektalianQuebcooking that hits the heart just right. 10 inch pepperoni sub with piles of greek salad on top? Check. Lasagne gratine? Check. Gyro trio to go? You know you want to. And even though Altos doesn't do the best of any of these things, I always somehow end a meal from here grinning and weirdly satisfied."

/user_details?userid=k5NgVZyROlrpNeaWivWXDg,Cameron M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Best poutine in Montreal and a good deal too. The cheese is melted on the poutine which is key. Delivered to my house in 7mins. Can't beat that. RIP hope they come back.
/user_details?userid=KNRwbAKYzHXjaWGQJc_pTg,Jimmy L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Alto is a premium late late night location. If you are in their area, their late night deliveries are well worth it. The Veal Parmigiana sub is a must."
/user_details?userid=ODSH1it5oAUPu2clIgOvyg,Phan H.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"This cool little diner was my last stop from a fantastic weekend in Montreal. I wanted to try a food staple of Montreal, which is the Poutine. So my friends and I all ordered a different poutine and try each others. The regular, which tasted pretty decent, the chicken and bacon, which was a little bland because of the chicken, and the trio meat, which was probably the best out of all three. The cheese on all three were very stretchy, the type you find on pizza. We also had some house beer. The lady was very nice, even though we spoke no French, and she spoke a decent amount of English. I always try to speak the native language, but failed horribly. The prices are decent, but the beers were pretty expensive, I think the mugs are half the normal size, so ordering two is really getting one beer, which ends up being $7."
/user_details?userid=k2t-xCELlWanDIBPp5oEyg,Ian M.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"I've ordered from this place MANY times over the years, they're one of my favourites for cheap, quick food. There's a bit of variation in quality; the omelettes, burgers, and sandwiches are great, the salads not so much. But their delivery speed is exceptional, and they're a solid good-value choice."

/user_details?userid=PtZW9TGETbxG58FRbVESgg,V G.,"Syracuse, NY",4 star rating,First time in Montreal and we ordered take out based on a suggestion from a hotel staff member.  it was less than a 4 minute walk from my hotel and when i reached the restaurant I waited less than 10 minutes for my food.  The restaurant was clean and the elder gentleman behind the counter was very attentive and courteous.  The prices were reasonable and the food was good. My only complaint was that the fries were a bit under cooked but the portions were a good size.  After over spending on 'so-so' food it was nice to have a good meal at a good price.

They deliver and are open till 4-5am, which I think is their best appeal. I thoroughly enjoy their vegetarian poutine, and other poutines in general, but only when I am not in my sober state of mind. Their poutines are very soupy - lots and lots of gravy that is not as thick as what I am used to. Many of my friends find this gross, but I actually really like it!"

As far as the service, it was great. The server was on top of everything and always pre-bused. However, I was charged extra by the server. When I ordered a combo I was told that he came with a soda. I asked if I could replace it with bottled water instead (I don't drink soda), and the server said yes. However, I was charged for it. As far as the food, as other people have said it is basically bar food. I had a gyro plate with fries. The gyro was similar to Grecian Delight (didn't seem to be off a spit) and the fries had no salt. The meal was average...not great or bad, just average. However, because of the service, I am willing to give this place another try and see what they recommend."

/user_details?userid=2LptcvhkcFyNXT_NZDPpaQ,Luca M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"An eclectic mix of Italian, Greek and North American foods that can be served without compromising quality for quantity or speed.It's one of the few spots I'd define a fast food that actually serve GOOD food at very reasonable prices. Their Alto Burger trio usually fills me up pretty well, and this comes from a proficient eater.Alto is strategically placed close to the McGill campus, the ghetto, the residences and the downtown scene. Yet despite the surroundings, it is never full and you are guaranteed to find a seat even when the Montreal Canadians hockey team is playing. The common sense with which Alto is run and their great quality for the prices charged would earn them four stars, yet one can't fail to mention their insanely late opening (and delivery) times and their proverbially fast delivery service.What's more, delivery is free and I've never encountered a ""minimum amount"" barrier. I hotly suggest their burger trios and their milkshakes. Pita dishes are OK if you fancy a quick bite but aren't too hungry. The poutine is a good effort, but the cheese is normal grated brick one rather than the traditional curds, so explore other parts of the menu.It is the meeting point of the restaurant, the deli and the fast food joint. It runs like clockwork, the kitchen is always busy (indicating good grocery turnover) and if you order to deliver you will have your food extremely fast, wherever you are."

While the food is pretty standard in general terms, for latenight eats in Montreal (its open til either 4 or 5 am most nights, including delivery), their service is pretty much impeccable and their quality is consistent and most importantly, FAST. I have never once had to wait more than ten minutes for my food at altos, or more than 20 minutes for delivery. And it's usually faster. Plus their gyro and cheeseburger combos are a pretty good deal and hit the spot after a long shitty evening at the library or better yet one spent out getting crunked.
