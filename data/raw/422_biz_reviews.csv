/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Authentic Yemeni Cuisine and the only one of it's kind in Montreal.Currently open for takeout only and have taken great measures for Covid inside (menu by the door and you can order when ready)The guy serving us was super friendly and accommodating; we had some special requests and he was able to make the adjustments.Their famous dishes are the Mandi/Mazbi - hopefully once we are able to eat in, would love to try that inside as they take pride in their presentation.They have a great selection of Vegan dishes which we ordered (Edam Bamia / Veg Edam) and also their cute bite-sized samosas. Everything was packaged very well, good portion size, decent prices and most importantly, super delicious! A must to try if looking for a unique cuisine, both for Vegans/Vegetarians & Non-Veg eaters!"

/user_details?userid=sI3qFZXxXvRJC5Q97bieCw,Mohammad M.,"Lexington, KY",5 star rating,"This is the best Yemeni food I had in North America. I came in from the States to Montreal for a couple of days to visit family. I had tried several places in the past for Yemeni food, but nothing comes close. It is seasoned to perfection, with all the condiments served on the side without you even asking. The hosts are very friendly and attentive. The portions are large, leaving no room for dessert; so pace yourself. Will definitely be coming back."

/user_details?userid=tXEqXYByl9NUD1WO2DjpPA,Daniel A.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Easily one of my most enjoyable restaurant experiences in a while. Stumbled in here for dinner on a recent Friday night with some friends and we were all thrilled. The mazbi chicken had a nice flavour and was roasted well, and the mandi chicken was extraordinarily flavourful. They were served on a large bed of flavoured, aromatic rice and with two sauces (one yogurt-based, the other likely tomato-based) on the side. The portions were enormous.Also tried the kunafa for dessert which was a pleasant surprise. It was cheese and pastry-based, but with subtle flavours and complementing textures.The meal was very affordable, the staff were exceptionally friendly and the ambiance was nice as well. I can't recommend this place highly enough."
/user_details?userid=HMQYQHcBiLM8JM36q3q5QQ,Cassandra S.,"Stamford, CT",5 star rating,"We come to Montreal several times every year and this was honestly one of the best restaurants we have been to.  The fact that this restaurant has only been open a little over 2 months makes it even more impressive, they really had their act together-- the food and service were outstanding.  The restaurant is immaculately clean and cute inside.The service was incredible.  We came in about 40 minutes before they close, which I fully expected them to tell us that there was a limited menu because of the time and that there were certain things we couldn't order-- they had every right to do so or even turn us away like most places do if it is within an hour/half hour of close.  Not the case here, they even offered some things that they told us take longer to cook and have a longer wait.  They were so friendly and welcoming, it felt like we were out somewhere with friends.  The family that owns the restaurant was working and we had such a nice long conversation with them and you could tell they were genuinely happy to show us their food and culture and to tell us about everything.  We had so much fun talking to them and their service was incredible, we cannot wait to come back in August!  I really hope this place takes off and has years of great business, because it is our new favorite.We had the Magalgal Beef and Chicken Mazbi dinners, plus sambosa as an appetizer and the Fata Bilmoze for dessert.  I cannot say enough about the food, it was absolutely delicious.  The family who owns the restaurant was happy to make recommendations for us and even brought us extra things for us to try because we were so interested in their food and culture they were so happy to have us try things.  Everything was delicious.Added bonus (and I hate being that person):  If you don't speak French and struggle at times with menus, the staff speaks native-level fluent English, you forget you're in a non-English speaking city, so I imagine that will be a relief for some people who struggle with the language"

If you are new to Yemeni cuisine ( my first time) don't forget to add the tomato sauce and yogurt sides as it adds to the blast of the flavour. Price point is very affordable and portions are very good. Also lovee the meat sambosas."

The chicken is so delicious with the charcoal taste. The lamb is very tender and tasty. After the meal, we got the special banana dessert. It is really ""agreable""."

/user_details?userid=0v0DhyWCQSm3tnVcPuInGg,Kyle L.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,Delicious down home style Middle Eastern food that leaves you craving more.  My friend and I ordered the Chicken Mazbi and the Mandi Lamb.  It was all exquisite.  The portion sizes were great and the service was perfect.
