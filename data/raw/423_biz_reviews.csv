/user_details?userid=RowxQgaC5cpOXNDXX3snjw,Anis K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Sen Vang is a great little homely cozy friendly Vietnamese restaurant in my hood and I've started eating here on the regular.Their soup is tasty, the broth is just salty enough, without being over the top. The portions are just right.Their beef is fresh and yummy and so is their grilled chicken.Their vermicelli dishes are a tad too big for my tummy (not that that's stopped me from gleefully wolfing them down anyway) and their prices do reflect the larger portion size. They're so big you could pretty much split one between two people and have a smaller dish on the side.I tried one of their rice dishes, their simplicity and savouriffic salaciousness was succulent and satisfying. Seriously, the grilled chicken on rice did not disappoint.Their prices for pho soups are very reasonable, so that definitely keeps me coming back, it's a real no brainer to eat here frequently.I gotta say for a local eatery in the cote sainte Catherine neighbourhood, I'm surprised how good it is. I even prefer it to the slightly upmarket Hai Hoang up the road. The quality, value, and friendly service, everything is just how I like it.Five stars - will eat again. A"
/user_details?userid=nQ3S2QXLi8hMEEZVa1gn9A,Sansan H.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"This is the best vietnamese in town. I have tried pho lien, pho tay ho, pho bac 97, pho bang new york, etc - hands down this place has the best pho and rice dishes. Their cha gio (imperial role) is the best - it has taro, mushroom, pork, and shrimp. The food is very fresh. Highly recommended if you are in montreal"
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"Sen Vang is another popular Vietnamese spot in town. I read great things from a Montreal blogger so I wanted to see for myself what the fuss was about. I dropped by on a Friday afternoon (around 3:30pm) for a late lunch and was surprised to see it was reasonably busy. Good sign. I like how their menu is short and sweet. Only 14 items on the menu!- Bun bo hue ($9.75 large) - two sizes to choose from (small and large) so obviously I went with the latter. Unfortunately, the only difference (to me) is that you get more soup rather than more meat or more noodles. Broth was tasty but I instantly tasted MSG/salt. The level of heat was pretty fiery with the first few sips but eventually subsided. Noodles were good (but wish they gave more). The best was the beef slices; perfect fat to meat ratio and it stayed incredibly tender the whole time I was eating. They even put in pork blood; pretty authentic/legit.Wanted to really like this place but I've had better depth, more complex BBH. Cash only."
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",4 star rating,Great place for Bun Bo hue. For those who are not experienced in BBH it's a spicy beef noodle soup in a rich broth. Think of it as Pho's angrier cousin. Rich beef broth with noodles and a healthy spicy kick to it. Another way I can explain BBH is it's quite possibly the best way to clear a full sinus cavity. Thus it makes a delicious meal in the cooler months where we have those wet humid 0C to -10C days. You know the days I'm talking about.......where you feel chilled to the bone and you feel like curling up under a blanket or blasting the heat just to warm up. Go get a steamy bowl of Bun Bo Hue and PRESTO. Instant feel better. For those who are Vietnamese purists this is a delicious option in a town where Vietnamese food is plentiful. Absolutely I shall be back. Without a question. ****** Word of caution. BBH is not a first date meal. It is only if you state ground rules that you eat like a hungry dog. ****** Second word of caution. Don't wear a white shirt as those red oil stains (from the soup) are near impossible to get out. I made an impromptu bib out of paper towel (yes I'm comfortable in my own skin). Slurp it up. MEGA delish in every way!
/user_details?userid=P_BsIX1h93u8lgiDXf-9CA,Andrew C.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"I am not from Montreal and decided to make a trip from downtown to Sen Vang. As a big fan of pho and Vietnamese food, I highly recommend this place-family run restaurant-literally across the street from the Metro station-got the Bun Bo Hue aka spicy noodles, which was delicious. Some have this as a secret menu item but I saw it on the menu. Get the large, its only $1 CAD more-have also got the Pho Bac Diet aka #1 at most Pho restaurants previously, which was delicious as well with great broth; that being said you can get this at all Pho restaurants-between the Bun Bo Hue and the Pho Bac Diet, I would go with the Bun Bo Hue because its different but tasty-skip the Cha Gio aka Imperial Rolls. They are okay but nothing special-staff is friendly. Feel free to ask them for the wifi code-definitely worth the trip if you like Vietnamese food and are from out of town"
/user_details?userid=aARnRUKWYbEX8IsnVr8sgw,Erin A.,"New Tripoli, PA",5 star rating,"Been trying all the pho places in this area of Montreal for the past few months and this place did not disappoint. The pho was fresh and hot, I could barely finish the bowl. I always go for the rare beef, which was a great cut of meat. Very tender and easy to eat! Will be coming back here often to enjoy a fresh bowl of pho!"
/user_details?userid=zbpP28M6g0YHaaIJ6ZP2Xg,Elise B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I wanted to go for pho with my sister on a Monday and guess what, a bunch of Vietnamese restaurants are closed on Mondays. So we had very limited choices and wanted it to be on Côte-des-neiges, so finally, we settled onRestaurant Sen Vàng. I was very pleasantly surprised by their pho, as it also had that sweet taste in the broth that I love. However, portions once again were a bit on the small side (I ordered the large, which was the biggest format). I also learned something new that day, which is that there is an herb called culantro (no, not cilantro) and it is supposedly better than the Thai basil leaves that are typically served with pho. Maybe it's a question of what you're used to, but I definitely prefer Thai basil. In any case, it was a bit of a educative meal For my full MTL Pho Hunt review and more photos, check out my blog: Turquoise Blog (link in bio!)"
/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Beware: Cash Only!Decent lunch place. I went there during lunch time and ordered a XL Pho Dac Biet like any Vietnamese person who is hungry (and yes, I was hungry). Having seen the reviews on Yelp, my expectations were fairly high. Let's just say that I was neither disappointed nor overwhelmed. The flavor of the broth was good, but nothing to write home about. The portion was generous, but mainly because i ordered an XL size bowl (which ended up costing about 12$ before tips). Lots of meat too. Overall, good lunch place!"
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Authentic home made pandan jelly!! There was a guy who walked in an just ordered a bowl of pandan jelly with coconut milk. That's all. I had it in the tricolored dessert and it was really good! Their specialty soup and noodles was really good and their spring rolls were uber yummy!  Their grilled beef noodles was just average as the portion of meat was very small and I think was pan cooked instead of grilled.
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"On a hunt for some good Pho, I found awesome reviews of Sen Vang, and brought a group of 6 people here. Some of us had Pho, and some had chicken or beef/vermicelli plates - everything was spot on. I thought that although the Pho was good, the other plates tasted better, but that might just be because I get antsy since Pho takes forever and a day for you to finish it (yes, I get bored).Prices are super reasonable, service is great, and the food is good. Perfect for a quick low key meal!"
/user_details?userid=qnZkCGvLz6AB5cQN_J_pUA,Jack D.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",4 star rating,"Was strolling along Victoria with the boo and decided to grab a bite at this spot. GREAT IDEA :)We had the grilled chicken plate (chicken, rice, salad, fish sauce) and the special Bun Bo Hue (a spicy beef noodle soup). Both were quite tasty. I probably would ask them to hold the blood cube next time (just a personal preference), but I didn't mind it too much. Service was great, feels like a small family place the folks in the neighborhood like to frequent. There was a building alarm that went off a few times, which according to the staff happens when someone in the building sets off the fire alarm (from cooking, etc). Sadly, the restaurant has no control over that. Would definitely come back again!!!"

Count on my words, a bowl of Pho soup will be your best friend Today, I passed by Sen Vang .. A tiny place which is located just in front of Metro Côte-Ste-Catherine (you can't miss it out! they have a big green billboard lol). I ordered a beef bowl of Pho. The ingredients are fresh, the meat is super tender and just the smell of if will make you salivate.The service was fast.. Price including tax was about 10$.. The only advise I'd give you, they only accept payments by ""cash""Et bonne appétit!"

The broth is tasty, noodles are fresh, great cut of meat, the restaurant is a cute little place, clean with friendly staff.Brought some take out home for the hubby and  he quickly noticed it wasn't from our usually spot and the mister said from now on we will get our pho fix from there lol.Only downside is no fresh rolls, the menu is limited but I rather have a small menu with tasty dish over pages of ok food."
/user_details?userid=bUPeHBFEINhqiKj9-k4-zA,Charles N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Slowly the complex flavors of a generous sized bowl of Pho Dac Biet unfurl like the petals of the lotus flower in this new family-owned establishment! The beef seasoned broth served along rice noodles, thinly sliced beef, meatballs, tendon, is authentic and close to what you would expect from a homemade concoction - easy on the cloves and lean on the fat content.You will also find your staple choices of egg noodle with bbq pork and shrimp soup, various rice or rice vermicelli dishes with grilled chicken, pork, beef and the famous vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk. Recently inspired from my foodie friend's posting, I was intrigued and had to stop and try it out. Although only officially inaugurated two weeks ago, owners Son & Thao are working out the usual minor opening related kinks but this seems to be a promising outlet for soups & noodle cravings!Definitely must return to try ""off-menu"" items such as Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef and thick noodle soup) or Bun Rieu  (crab and noodle soup). What surprises do the friendly Sen Vang (Golen Lotus) owners Son and Thao await us on our next visit?Come and find out for yourself!"

Needless to say they are special for Pho. It's so authentic! Don't forget to order Cha Gio , the taste is so unique that you can't get anywhere else but Sen Vang.The staffs are all excellent, especially the cook, she is working hard to make all the dishes come out with the best taste. The last reason for this 5 stars rating is the cleanness and fresh cozy atmosphere when you enjoy your time here."

Menu has a nice variety, not as large of a selection as other Vietnamese restaurants I'm used to but has everything I'd order at a Vietnamese restaurant anyway. The imperial rolls are small though and come two per order. Think again if you think you're sharing with me!"

/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Sen Vang is a great Vietnamese place for those who crave something besides banh mi, as they offer various noodle dishes that are guaranteed to soothe the soul. From the common pho to combo rice dishes to bun bo hue, it is definitely a sit-down place that's great for those who want to try something new like I did the day I went.I ordered the large bun bo hue (spicy beef noodle soup) with a Vietnamese iced coffee for my beverage. It took all but five minutes for the noodle soup to come out piping hot and chock full of various cuts of meat that would be unfamiliar to Western palates. For instance, there were your typical un-intimidating slices and chunks of beef, but there were also pieces of Vietnamese white sausage and coagulated pig's blood. Personally, the pig's blood didn't suit my tastes, but that's probably because it's an acquired one. The broth was still wonderfully seasoned and spiced (although I did need to add some spicy oil for that extra kick), and the noodles were bouncy and fresh and reminded me a lot of Guilin mifen that I would eat in China. The bean sprouts added that extra crunch that is always appreciated for texture purposes, and the lime juice made it tangy but not too sour. As always, the Vietnamese know how to make their iced coffee, so there's nothing new to say about how much I liked it!Since I have friends who live in or are frequently around the Côte-des-Neiges area, I'll be sure to bring them here next time I'm in the area! After all, great food is always better consumed with great company."

When we went in, I thought there were two customers, but turns out one was the waiter and one was the cook hahaThe service was great and so was the food. I got the pho soup. It was delicious, and the price was good (only about $7 for the small, which was plenty). I can't remember the names of the meals my sisters got, but one was noodles with beef and salad, and the other got chicken with rice and salad. I tried both and they were also delicious. I posted pictures. I don't go to this area of Montreal often, but Will definitely go back if I'm in the area."

Servings are pretty generous in noodle, not so much in meat. But I did enjoy the beef itself, both the thinly sliced juicy brisket and the rare sirloin were on point."

This was a first time visit, ordered a soup with some veggies. Soup tasted great, but what was the cherry on the icing is when I asked to pack up what was left (which was most of it) the employee came back out and said he'd added broth and a small chili into the soup to help me feel better. Such a small gesture, but what a kind gesture. I'll be back for sure."

/user_details?userid=03bowRxuOy6g8KdNx3ogHA,Hanna M.,"Austin, TX",4 star rating,I went to this place for the bun bo hue. This place was close to authentic outside of going to Vietnam . They serve small and large size. Both are under $10. If you love bun bo like me I'd recommend ordering the large.

I tried their Bun Bo Hue, and it was AMAZING. I would say it's in the top 2 I've ever had in Montreal. It was really hot, full of flavour and definitely authentic. The chef came out and even spoke to my boyfriend and I about how he tries to make the soup as authentic as possible and how he aims for the soup to be consistent every single time it is ordered (at some places when you go it can be good on one day, a tad watery or oily the next). He was very friendly and definitely showed a true passion for cooking.It's going to be hard to even try anything else on the menu because I think I'll just keep on ordering the bun bo hue :)"

You may think that all Pho taste the same, but I'm very pleased with their soup bowls. Generous quantity, prepared to perfection, soup was boiling hot every time I order a great bowl of pho.- Haven't tried their Bun (Vermicelli) and Com (Rice) yet. I will re-review this in the future.About the restaurant:- Family owned business with professional service- Can get very busy in lunch times, that doesn't bother me because it tells me that this place is popular and is great.- Price range is exceptionally affordable.Anyhow, this deserves a 4.75 star - and 5 is closest to it so I give it a five.Definitely will be returning in the future."

Awesome food, an incredibly friendly staff, it's easy to find, and it doesn't empty your wallet. That pretty much sums up the qualities and pros of Sen Vang. The menu covers the basics of Vietnamese cuisine and does an amazing job of everything. I had the rare beef pho, and the flavor of the broth was simply sublime in it's mix of sweet and salty. The quality of the ingredients is definitely higher than some other Vietnamese restaurants in town and I could tell instantly that great care was taken in the preparation of the food as the beef was not stuck together is it can tend to be, and there were generous portions of noodles and beef in the bowl. One of the hidden gems by far. Definite 5 stars"

If you've never heard of it, it's a spicy (obviously from the picture) beef based soup that a lot of places serve on the weekend. The broth's balance of salty, sour, sweet and savoury balances on a fine line where a little bit in either direction will throw the soup off completely. There is a profound depth of flavour in this noodles dish, fragrant in lemongrass and spices, the toppings are similar to the dac biet, with the addition of black pepper ""cha lua"" - Vietnamese steamed pork loaf, the same that's found in banh mi, however, the rice noodles in this dish are thicker and cylindrical."
