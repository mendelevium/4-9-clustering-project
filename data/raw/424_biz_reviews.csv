/user_details?userid=theKAKaqiAGsLhpSyXBtSQ,Triston J.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,Walking in here you wouldn't necessarily expect to be served THE BEST PIZZA IN THE CITY... it's got a deli vibe. My friend (she's a painter) is particularly taken with the Parmesan... it's real... not the fake shit you get in most Parmesan shakers. For this La Maison des Pate Fraîches gets a five. 1 point for exceeding expectations2 points for a nice server3 points for real parm 4 points for real parm5 points for the best pizza in the city blessings of tomatoes be upon you. - Triston Jude and friend
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I guess thought it was going to be better, and I did have somewhat higher expectations --- regarding their pizzas that is. I'm not really reviewing the market's concept with looks pretty cool. Fresh pastas by weight and a fairly large selection of Italian specialties, perhaps I may have a better taste in my mouth after trying those items.In a crusty shell, I got their vegetarian pizza to go (personal size - which is actually a fair size and comes with a decent price tag $8 or 9 +T). Apart from having to wait a bit longer than you would expect for a fresh pizza it came out hot and looked pretty good. Even the first couple of bites seemed to be alright and even somewhat tasty, but then bite after bite it got worse and worse. There was an odd something going on with their dough and/or sauce and/or cheese and/or vegetable situation/combination, that made me feel a little yucky after eating it. I'm not a big fan of that happening and who would be. You should never feel yucky after eating a pizza. Even after eating a whole small. You may feel stuffed, but be happily full; satisfied and even proud you ate it all up.So, when I saw the high star rating I was a bit surprised, and by chance I saw another 1* review that concurred with my experience, so I don't feel like I'm the only one who had this feeling and experience.Note: Their system for where to go, stand and order where not very clear, so that could also use some work. The shop has a bit of a complicated layout which doesn't help matters. Maybe they've worked on that over the last several weeks/months, and if not they probably should to make it as safe and efficient as possible. I think that's fair to hope for..."

It took 10 mins to make and was served steaming hot and fresh out of the oven. There is some seating inside or a bench outside.. or there's Parc Lafontaine a 5 min walk away. I really like the vibe here, it's a classic urban deli. I don't eat gluten but my husband and son and his friends all loved the pizza. Lets just say there were no leftovers."
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I am not sure where the 4 and 5 stars are coming from clearly I didn't have the same experience. By far the worst pizza I ever had in my life ( frozen pizza and dominos is a 5 *). I would be embarrassed to serve a pizza like this to customers or guests. We ordered #9 which was bococcini, tomato and mushrooms and # 16 which was four cheeses. The dough was thick, super cheesy and the pizza was all moist and wet on the top from the tomato. You can imagine how gross that is...To top it all off we had an upset stomach after eating the pizza and I couldn't work the next day .I wanted to come back and try their other dishes before eating my meal but definitely will never come back.Save your money and eat elsewhere or make your own."
/user_details?userid=CwFebMF23wOAepWE38XACA,Tomer N.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"If you like real Italian food with a real Italian atmosphere you will like La Maison des Pâtes Fraîches. This is a restaurant-grocery shop hybrid, the word Deli would not do this place justice. If you want to buy Italian products, Fresh pasta or home made Italian food they;ve got it. If you want to sit down and have a real fresh and extremely delicious Italian cuisine They've got it. If you just want to go inside and smell and absorb Italy They've got it.My son and I had the ravioli (filled with cheese and rose sauce )  and Spaghetti (meet sauce) and licked the plate. I will definitely come here again..Definitely!"
/user_details?userid=DlNz5SxdBYRaZ_pnyIxn6g,Rhonda B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Family run restaurant and takeout serving classic Italian favourites. In several visits have tried excellent meat lasagna and veg manicotti, fresh pasta (with a large selection of sauces), antipasto, deli counter with variety of cold cuts and cheese. The tiramisu was delicious and huge portion, 2 of us left a small reminder for today. Good tip if you want take out, during lunch hours they have a long counter that is packed with folks who queue up to eat. For takeout try just before or after lunch rush. One other comment about the service, every time I've been, I have encountered smiles, HI's and even gifted foods, be it from any of the 3 sons or, like our visit yesterday, from mama herself!"
/user_details?userid=tow2Fwn6xDdYN6hUvgZDaA,M Y.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is solid. It's not the most amazing Italian food in Montreal, but it is pretty freaking awesome. Perfect for an easy and quick dinner. VERY decent prices. I order from here often and I'm never disappointed. A favorite"
/user_details?userid=-kkHPNvc4dxBHmYgHCNVfQ,Jax L.,"Boone, NC",5 star rating,"Fresh, simple and delicious! Great for a night when you don't want to cook but don't feel like going out to eat. You can just get takeout and feel like you're eating a home cooked meal, without the effort! Would recommend"
/user_details?userid=b7ijwegYC73v8FwefXk9jQ,Gigglebook N.,"Williston Park, NY",4 star rating,"Really nice Italian restaurant/grocery store. We came in on a Wednesday night about 7:30pm and took out. The pasta here is amazing. We got to choose the fresh pasta and the sauce to go with it - $8.99 was great price for the dish.Spaghetti With meat sauce (really good)Tomato pasta with rosse sauce (omg, our favorite)Linguini with white cream and mushroom sauce (aka alfredo, this was good but the other was so much better)Flat wide pasta with rosse sauce (this pasta probably will go better with the meat sauce)Bread was nice and soft stuffed grape leave (okay 3 for $1)Grilled octopus salad (a little hard, oily, and not very tender- this was 59.99 lb)Tiramisu was really good $7I would definitely go back!!!"
/user_details?userid=cL5jML80rWAyzC1z_v4HWw,Clarence W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is one of my go-to places for take-out in the Plateau and just one of my favourite establishments, period. The fresh pastas and sauces are delicious, and there's a great variety of hot prepared food and Italian grocery staples (such as deli meats, oils and vinegars, olives, salad, desserts, etc). They have everything you need to make a quick dinner for two or a large feast. Plus the prices are reasonable and the staff has always been extremely friendly and helpful. Can't recommend it enough!"
/user_details?userid=WkAiFAJMI7aZPjFqMvsGbA,Sarah R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Stopped in to get something for dinner and perused all of the traditional Italian grocery items. I ordered the Rosanna pizza. At first I thought $10 was expensive for a small pizza. However, it has a thick crust and is very filling - I got three meals out of it! I will definitely be back for some fresh pasta and sauce!"
/user_details?userid=yRgJ0HkDOkA0UeE09CiXAw,D D.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I don't know why people make a big deal about this restaurant maybe during old days when there was less options  they were considered a good restaurant , we were there Saturday afternoon place was empty anyways my wife ordered pizza Napoletan she shared with kids I got  the meat lasagna and also the pizza with aragula and oil olive ( I forgot the name ) .Pizza dough was uncooked it was so thick when we flipped the pizza  in our plates dough was so uncooked it was sticking to our  plate anyways both of us couldn't finished  the  pizza  cheese they use was very heavy I don't know if it was processed cheese or not , lasagna was so peppery and zesty it was disgusting believe  me it was disgusting ,who knows how many hours  ago it was made. After we left the restaurant both of us  had a upset stomach from the uncooked pizza dough I had to stop at convenience store to buy  Perrier so we can burp it out .it was a bad experience  I will never ever go there again . DO THEY CARE? I don't think so  but I will never ever step my foot there again"
/user_details?userid=BytRWk8X1OelSgwwfXd8Aw,Arun D.,"London, United Kingdom",4 star rating,Heavenly pasta that it perfect to get as a take out dinner so you can sit at home and enjoy food that you could only dream of making! Try their Ravioli it's perfection!
/user_details?userid=nnLSxhxJbaj4rCKGQDQlGA,Dahlia S.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Best pizza I've had in Montreal, and so affordable- only 7.99! The fresh pasta was incredible as well. Choose your pasta, choose your sauce, and it's ready in just a few minutes."
/user_details?userid=Bveyuu-GqeQMf8ereY2I2g,Sabrina N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"As an Italian, I eat way too much pasta. I was a bit skeptical trying out a place that makes ""fresh pasta"" since we do it fresh at home but this place is definitely worth your time and money. The pasta is very fresh, the sauces are quite tasty and the people working there are super helpful. I would suggest this place if you're having guests over and want to make something super quick and good!"
/user_details?userid=ILe3tzgnbGSaZfpArtJdjA,Mike S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great place! I use it more as a take away. Go buy some fresh pasta and any of their sauces, then invite some friends over and lie to them and tell them you made it all;)"
