There was an array of food options but so happy we went with this one! The oysters are only $1 CAD so naturally, everyone got 2-4 oysters for themselves. The lobster roll was the die for! I cannot say enough about it because not only was it so delicious, it was relatively big in size from previous lobster rolls I've had (which were like $20-$30 USD). The watermelon juice was also very refreshing!"

/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Decided to stop off for a tasty late lunch and wasn't sure between here and satay brothers. ( which is my fav ) as soon as we came to the counter the guy working looked as if we were bothering him and didn't smile or even ask to take out order I had to ask to order. They should really put him in the back and take the young blonde guy who was putting together out sandwich and put him in the front he was smiley and took over the other guys job because he couldn't be bother as he was playing with lids to watermelon juices that nobody was buying. I get it if there was a line up but there was only us and he didn't have the common sense to ask if it was To go or to eat there and when the young man brought it to me I had to kindly ask him just for a container to close it to go. No wonder this place was dead.2 stars for the poor customer service (not the friendly blonde guy in the back ) check pictures!4 stars for food quality!Shrimp was excellent the sandwich was great the bun was sweet and well garnished all tho I think they needed something with more crunch in there either pickled turnip or more coriander but it was good! It was spicy the shrimp po'boy so make sure you have a drink near by if you're not crazy about spice like me but it is bare able you won't die.We got a Greek salad for $5 which was really good they used cherry tomatoes and tiny cubed feta with olives that were pitted which is great. For that price they give u a pretty decent container it fed two of us and I have left overs.Great food but will most likely be trying another location.

Went for an lobster roll which was so pleasing and delicious it made me question my choice of the lobster/pasta I'd eaten previously at Joe's Beef (5x as much lobster in a delectable roll). Grabbed a kale and corn salad (don't knock it, it was amazing) since I hadn't eaten a good salad in a few days. I think there was pecorino cheese as well in a very light dressing. Envirvonment is a free for all, with tables nearby and sit anywhere you can find a spot which was fine. Reasonably priced, $17 Canadian combined but it was so delicious you'd expect to pay a lot more. Lemonade available but I grabbed some cold water and just enjoyed my lunch. Such a great choice. Go here.. Seriously, go here and support local great businesses."

The lobster roll became my new obsession - it is fresh, lobster loaded with some crunchy touch of celery that makes it even fresher! The brioche bread is lightly toasted and gives a nice contrast. It's like biting into a lobster heaven pillow. The only trouble in paradise is the price $15. You will want to come back for more! That's all you need to know!"

/user_details?userid=Zv_rMzv_8-c2-g0WtEXlTg,Bruno P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Wowwwww. I have to be honest: I wasn't expecting too much from this place. And that was a surprise. The dishes placed and exposed on market was a little bit too much for me. And I'm not into guacamole (shame on me!). By I tried the hummus, the chicken, the salad and the (marvellous) Agua Fresca! Watermelon, ginger and soda. Wow. Must try!"
/user_details?userid=NrevV_Ku8WCNZC4tyzg7SA,Melissa S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Meh. I went to Atwater market for lunch today and Lucille's has a kiosk there. I love seafood so I decided to treat myself to a lobster roll. At 16$ with tax, I'd say the price tag says ""treat"". The service was nice and friendly and the service was pretty fast. It wasn't very busy that definitely helped I'm sure. On to the food. Unfortunately that's were it fell flat for me. The tiny hot dog bun was nicely toasted but super greasy. The lobster portion was just ok, certainly not worth the price in my opinion. Most importantly though, the taste was bland and very forgettable. I don't know why, but the lobster had none of it's natural flavour. No hint of sweetness or freshness that lobster should have, just a bit of heat from the mayo/dressing they use. If I would have closed my eyes there is no way I'd know I was eating lobster. I may try the fish tacos next time, but I won't be fooled by the overpriced, underwhelming lobster roll again."
