/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"An interesting concept of a burrito like / fajita like / panini like sandwich. It's actually pretty good and I thought the smallest size was a good value with a drink and fries. Â I made my wrap with mayonnaise, ground beef, bacon, cheddar cheese, and olives. It was pretty good!"
