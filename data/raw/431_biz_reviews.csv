/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The kind of breakfast place you bookmark to come back again!  We were already starving and had planned to go to Passé Composé but alas!! There were already a dozen plus people standing outside in the December cold waiting in the queue at around 10:30am on a Saturday.  That's the only thing I'm unwilling to do is to wait in line when I'm already hungry--it's a sure recipe for hanger to come out!! So we had to come up with a plan B asap!  Happily, I follow the Yelp Brunch Collection ""Is It Brunch Time In Montreal? Top 30 Spots"" by Yelper Charles N. bit.ly/2HmeEka and was able to identify a recommended spot just minutes away.  The resto takes reservations so I called.  When we got there, we were seated at the bar and just in time for the last few seats in the resto.  I love the cosy ambiance with the wood paneled feature wall and benches, bright natural lighting.  Also like that the waiters sport straw fedoras kinda gives a unifying, unique vibe :)As for the food, they offer a small brunch list with original dishes and presented beautifully.  We opted for the smaller dishes which were the savory zucchini crepes and the sweet French toast.The soft and fluffy zucchini crepes offered a warm, rich flavor enhanced with black roe, balanced with pickled onions and acidity of the Italian parsley. The French toast had a satisfying layer of pistachio butter between slices and sweetened with crunchy choco bits of crumble and caramel. I think I preferred the sweet dish over the savory but both were excellent in terms of flavoring and really just depends what you're in the mood for. The smoothies we ordered were the very creamy avocado based--Smooth Delivery and the tarter raspberry based Rouge Passion. Both were very fresh and we each preferred one over the other so it's a tie. Service is warm and friendly, food was served quickly and we ate it even more quickly.  I took my unfinished smoothie to go in a paper coffee cup. I'd love to go back and try their other savory brunch items and make sure I go hungry!  Definitely check this resto out, it's a wonderful experience and sure beats waiting outside in the cold!"

We saw that it had a lot of good reviews on Yelp. We ordered: Crêpe de zucchini 3/5Huevos Rancheros 4/5Benedictines 4/5And a few drinks 4/5 The Huevos Rancheros tasted good 2/3 of us liked it. The Benedictine was good also, but I didn't like the thickness of the cheese or flavour.The Crêpe de zucchini was good, but had a lot of flavours going on in the dish. Sometimes a bit too much. Overall, everything was good. The staff was polite and helpful."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Great food, questionable service. I got the zucchini crepe with gravlax and poached eggs and it was delicious. The marinated onions complimented the saltiness of the gravlax well. The egg yolks were perfectly runny. However, I did find an egg shell while chewing one of the poached eggs. As for the service, we found it a little bit weird. Our waitress was a bit rude and didn't really seem friendly with us. One of my friends and I ordered the daily smoothie. After she got hers, she took a sip and it didn't taste good. Before I got mine, one of the waiters came to take hers back and said there's been a mistake. 5 minutes later, he came back to tell us the smoothie wasn't available anymore and asked us to change it to something else without any other explanation. We did get other ones which tasted great, but all that was very confusing.We came on a very hot and humid day. The restaurant's AC wasn't strong enough and it was very hot inside the restaurant."
/user_details?userid=LCZgiPzUKzigGdj76cygQA,Roberta D.,"Weymouth, MA",4 star rating,Went to Les Affames this past Saturday while visiting the Montreal area with my boyfriend. All of the previous reviews were definitely spot on - the entire menu is in French so make sure you brush up before heading in. Luckily this girl studied French cuisine on DuoLingo and was already prepared! Fear not if you're unable to read the menu because there was one member of the staff who offered to help as well. I got the biscuit which was delicious! I also ordered a chai tea latte that was potentially the worst I've ever had in my life. It tasted like room temperature milk. The service definitely followed European style in that it did get drawn out a bit. Overall the food was good and an experience for a native English speaker out in Montreal.
/user_details?userid=ahgcM5gvEyu8Fg0d1RFnlg,Michelle V.,"Dollard-Des Ormeaux, Canada",4 star rating,"I honestly don't know what took me so long to discover this place. Despite the fact that it would take me an hour to get there, THIS is serious a gem, hole in the wall and more than your average eggs and toast brunch place. Right here we have: Eggs Benedict with goat cheese, with Chanterelle and radish salad with pecan paired with a lemon, Melissa(herb) and honey vinaigrette. This picture is literally as good as it looks. PS. I highly recommend making reservations or you'll end up waiting 1.5 hours before getting seated."
/user_details?userid=DyEuyCLw-4Oq2EuclPj4Kw,Johanna S.,"Port St. Lucie, FL",5 star rating,"Delicious, fresh, homemade, innovative, perfectly paired food is what you can find here. The staff is very friendly and was able to explain everything on their menus in english. We tried the duck confit, egg, bacon, in a homemade cheddar biscuit sandwich. Wow, very good, the duck was nice and crispy, fatty;complimented the eggs prefectly. The huevos rancheros, served in a big Pyrex glass, were flavorful and filling! It's offered with 3 specialty sauces - a salsa verde, an orange one with peaches and a red on slightly spicier. The boudin (blood sausage) patty with fresh scallions on top, was a big thick slice, creamy, bloody but not too irony, crispy, on the outside just an excellent dish! It was accompanied by jalapeño cheddar pancakes, which were also delicious sweet and not spicy at all(I would've preferred more of a kick), perfectly cooked sunny side egg, and a sweet rhubarb. The original breakfast brought pastrami (amazing!), brisket, and duck confit, sooo good. To drink, the chai latte, not too spicy, milky, really good. A latte, strong coffee flavor, but not overpowering. The hot chocolate was balanced, not overly sweet, flavors of chocolate smacking your palate as you reach the end. I would definitely recommend this place and will come back for more!"

Everything was perfect, the food, rhe drinks, the super fun and kind staff and even the soundtrack was full of cool beats. The big ben cocktail was a hit and it seemed to be with other clients too. We tried the swordfish with mango puree and I never had such a well cooked one. It started the evening on a high note.Next was the quail which was equally delicious.  A substancial plate filled with flavors.The boudin was supposedly new on the menu. I think it should stay because it was one of the best i've had in my life.It's chill, it's friendly, the evening manager marc-antoine is just the very best!"
/user_details?userid=qCYSdhsOzHBKT-V72BiYNA,Suor K.,"Maple, Canada",3 star rating,"We decided to come to Les Affames after a long day at the Botanical Gardens. It was a long walk (2 km), so we had very high expectations. We arrived to a mostly empty restaurant, with only 2 tables of two and 2 seats at the bar occupied. The interior looked very modern. The menu was written on chalkboards on the wall. Unfortunately some of the words were difficult to read, so we asked the waiter/bartender to translate for us in English. Wow, he gave a very detailed explanation of what was included as well as some of the cooking preparation (e.g. some of the menu items were prepared sous vide). We thought it was just the explanation he gave to English-speakers, but upon further inspection, the menu was actually a list of ingredients. Regardless of whether you spoke English or French, the waiter had to provide a 5+ minute explanation of the menu.We ordered the salmon dish and the tortellini dish. It took at least 10 minutes before the waiter offered to provide bread. The bread was really good, especially with their homemade butter. Both the salmon dish and the tortellini dish were excellent. The salmon was presented crispy-skin side up with an excellent onion and squid-ink sauce. That sauce was amazing. The mousse was also great. The tortellini were full of mackerel and the clams were great. The sauce it came in was very tasty. I was sad that the food was gone so quickly.We were ready to order dessert, but the waiter/bartender had to make drinks for another table and then provide a 10+ minute explanation of what was on the menu. We didn't have time to wait so we skipped on dessert.Overall the food was amazing! It was definitely worth the 4 km round-trip walk. However, they would definitely get at least another star if service was better. I think there should be more than 1 wait staff (who doubles as bartender) and that the menu should be self-explanatory so that it doesn't take so long to explain."
/user_details?userid=zTHK_nlgh8Bz_AXPksPKng,Will R.,"Minneapolis, MN",5 star rating,"This place was so amazing that my family and I ate here twice on our 5 day trip to Montreal. It is that good. As a matter of fact everything is excellent about this place- the space, the staff, and the food, wow the food.        If anyone ever reads my Yelp reviews they'll know I'm not a fan of brunch, I in fact abhor it. I'd rather stay at home and avoid the crowds and wait time and cook myself something delicious. But then there comes along a place like Les Affamés.......      Translation is hungry or ravenous in English, neither of which you'll be when you leave this place. Not only is the food here delicious, it's also generously portioned with plates that will fill up a healthy adult (well, a very hungry healthy adult).      Our order: the ""Indian"" eggs benedict with spicy hollandaise and a naan bread, which didn't taste anything like naan but was still delicious, the monte cristo breakfast sandwich with fromage tater tot croquettes (one of the best things I've ever tasted in my life), and the duck confit biscuit. All of these were incredible. We played musical plates switching around and eating off one anothers plates. For me the monte cristo breakfast sandwich won out, it was an absolute masterpiece of salty vs. sweet. When I returned home I even tried to recreate the dish to no avail.     Beyond the incredible food is the waitstaff. There is something amazing about the Quebecois, they are such warm, friendly, and down to earth people. From the moment we walked inside, we felt welcome and as those we were regulars to the restaurant. Try finding that in NYC or in PDX. You won't, especially if you're a tourist. Another thing you won't find in those places is the generous plates. You definitely get what you pay for here, and then some.    Upon leaving during our first trip here, our waitress gave us a small list of some of her favorite places to eat. These people love food and want to share it with you!!! If you want incredibly delicious food without any pretentiousness then you should visit Les Affamés. You will not be sorry."

/user_details?userid=pQ1JXPWb4RBNZxrCrUkb8A,Sofia W.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"We ordered the set brunch menu - which came with coffee, a glass of wine, one appetizer and one entree. The huevos rancheros and popcorn shrimp were to die for!! Great presentation and huge portion on the entree. The coffee came with steamed milk and our waiter was so very friendly and helpful. Would recommend if you're in the area."

/user_details?userid=WwH0pahKn-3MuGsRTWexGw,Lylou S.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Although the terrace is quite small we had excellent service and the food was delicious. We had the ""Classic"" breakfast and it was a very nice twist on what you would usually consider a classic breakfast. The pricing was reasonable for the quality and the quantity, I would even say that it was surprisingly inexpensive for the food that was served to us. Overall it was a very good experience."
/user_details?userid=wxAl9CvjpJA6iJWdH4yQtA,Colborn C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Had the pleasure of trying this place for brunch, glad I did. Had the Biskit, damn tasty! The cheese biscuit, delicious, not doughy, had a great texture and fantastic cheese flavour. The crispy maple bacon and egg, loved it. Add those fantastic hasbrown's and what a meal. I was there with a party of 6 and we all loved our meals. I'll surely return on my next trip back to Montreal. Oh, and the staff is fantastic, just an overall great experience!"
/user_details?userid=oRuZb1QYxQhKzKXU5pPfdA,Monika B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is by far my favourite brunch spot in the city. I have yet to find a better quality/price ratio anywhere else! The brunch menu usually has about 7-8 very diverse options, so whether you're looking for salty, sweet, or a combination of both, there'll be something to please you. Do yourself an immense favour and try the cheddar biscuit sandwich!Service is professional, friendly, and attentive.An added bonus: these fine folks know their cocktails, so you can have a satisfyingly boozy brunch!"
/user_details?userid=bq0O3Xl612LJWRSaRkVvWw,Julie J.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I made an online reservation for a Sunday brunch, and had no problems getting my table when I arrived. The restaurant is a cute little place and the waiters were friendly and attentive. I ordered the duck confit, bacon, egg, and cheddar biscuit which also had tomatos and lettuce. On the side was a spinach salad and hashbrowns. The biscuit was incredibly tall so I had to smash it a bit in order to eat it. It was delicious but did not have as much of a duck taste as I would have liked but I was overall satisfied with my decision. The hashbrowns were quite delicious. My friend got the ""Huevos rancheros"", which was good but not amazing. Overall, it was a filling, satisfying meal."
/user_details?userid=4903LxopSfvJNWBJroAC6g,Edward L.,"Walnut, CA",5 star rating,"My wife and I found this restaurant from Yelp. People here are very friendly. As a tourist, we didn't know how to pay for the car parking. When I ask the waiter, Edwin, how to pay, he volunteered to run out to the payment post to help me out. Also the food is great. The toast with eggs and salmon fish is super. My wife loves it."
/user_details?userid=R7tJWLrePC5FVgRJ33y6rQ,Cassie D.,"Milwaukee, WI",4 star rating,"We wandered into this place while visiting the Hochelega neighborhood on our honeymoon. We wanted something off the beaten path and less touristy. I looked at the menu and it looked fabulous. They have a great little patio out front and the staff is very attentive and passionate about what they do (Plus, they had matching hats). For those visiting, I would suggest boning up on your French, the menu is on a chalk board and in French with no English translation. They are more than happy to answer your questions, but I did feel a little like an a$$hole asking them to. But, it really doesn't matter because whatever you order is going to be wonderful. I had homemade pasta with roasted mushrooms and my husband had a pork chop. It was probably the best meal I had in Montreal and we ate at a couple of very well written about places. They have a great cocktail list and they are more than happy to make suggestions about food pairings. It's pricey, one of the more expensive meals we had, but it was worth it. Very well done and plated beautifully."

/user_details?userid=Hd7ed-x0Jy9xOzbEBO02RQ,E C.,"Pickering, Canada",5 star rating,"Loved this gem of a restaurant.  The staff was wonderful, the food delicious and ambiance just right for a Sunday brunch.  First I do not speak French.  The menu is written in French but not to worry because the servers will help you decipher the daily specials and make recommendations as well.   Just ask and they will be happy to speak what English they can to assist you!  That said I ordered a heuvos rancheros, which they tweaked it so that it was Vegetarian.  If you see something you like and it has meat in it not to worry because most items can be arranged so that they are Vegetarian friendly...again just ask.When my brunch arrived it was exactly what I was hoping for...a creative take on the dish!  I love when a chef adds his/her creativity to an item to make it unique.  The food was well prepared (the potato could have been a little less cooked but I didn't mind it as it was), the sauces that were provided alongside the dish were delicious (not sure what the Yellow sauce was but it was my favorite, the habenero sauce is good but it IS hot, and the green sauce was nice but I like spicy, flavorful sauces), and the servers were lovely!  I truly appreciate when Quebecers attempt to speak to me in English when it is clearly not easy for them and I do realize my French is completely atrocious in comparison.   Hospitality is making someone else feel comfortable and that is exactly what their staff did!  They were very hospitable and if I was in Montreal in the future this restaurant would reside on my go-to list."
/user_details?userid=bUpSdxKtSWBM5zbarjConw,Chris D.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Ate here twice and loved it both times. The service is warm and friendly, and the food is absolutely delicious. The huevos rancheros are amazing- be sure to ask for their hot sauces to go along with it. The menu is posted in French only, but the servers are happy to translate any unknown words. I recommend using the Google Translate app."
/user_details?userid=wwPJ0B5fnOHt1Bn52DIEHw,Zaddi G.,"Bronx, NY",4 star rating,The waitress was very nice and helped translate the menu. The food took about 15-20 min but was totally worth it. The kitchen is open and has at least three people working there so your food is made with care and love! The orange juice was delicious and freshly squeezed. Everything else perfect. We ordered the smoked salmon meal and the cheese biscuit meal. Both came with side greens. Very refreshing. Highly recommend for that hipster brunch feel.

/user_details?userid=uQx7RRXypKCxLmI_oSBIeQ,Carole M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Mes attentes étaient très élevées car j'ai été conseillé par une bonne amie a moi.  Endroit intéressant à découvrir mais selon moi pas le meilleur en ville.  On a pas faim pour le restant de la journée:):):). Un peu déçu que la promo cocktail gratuit lors d'un Check in n'était plus valide.  Pression ressentie afin de libérer rapidement table pour autres clients.   Peut être que je vais retourner un jour mais pas dans les mois à venir.
/user_details?userid=JIHLbnnsSZ_0VfT6qM1EAw,Valerie C.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,Amazing restaurant! The dishes are unique and presented with love. It's refreshing to dine at a restaurant where the chef so obviously cares for his craft. And even more incredible is that the prices are quite reasonable.
