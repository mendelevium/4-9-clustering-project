I was very impressed by the food. The poppy seed baguettes were fresh. The seasoning on the potatoes were tasty. They make some of their drinks which I thought was very impressive. My chicken sandwich was all dressed and was a bit spicy but definitely worth it. If you're in the area you should definitely give it a try as you won't be disappointed PS: don't forget to ask for tge sauce on the side to dip your chips"

An Ivory Coast street food inspired resto that specializes in sub styled sandwiches, salads and freshly pressed juices. The decor is original and I love the picture of the two elephants you see mounted on the wall. There is plenty of seating. Service is friendly. They take interac and Credit card for payment, they also appear in most of the food delivery apps. The menu is simple with vegan options available. Sandwiches start at 10$, trios start at 15$- which is standard. I tried the Merguez sandwich (a traditional Lamb of beef sausage) topped with slaw, onions and tomatoes in a toasted choice of baguette (sesame or poppy seed). This item was newly added to the menu. The sausage was salty/ spicy but complimented nicely with the other toppings. The bread was a bit hard toasted. For a side included in the trio, I tried the spiced plantain and potato chips that were house made. These were addictive, couldn't stop at one bite. I also ordered a side of the sweet plantains which were probably my favourite. The pressed pineapple ginger juice was a healthy alternative to soda. I also tried their salad which was ok. It would've been nice to have the meat toppings packaged on the side to go."

The design of their logo is super cute too."
