The chef came out and told us about the day's specials, but also mentioned that he could curate a meal for us if we wanted. Of course we took that and had an amazing meal. Five  courses.  First was a basket of really good breads and 6 or 7 little bowls of interesting things to dip it in. This part had a mostly middle eastern influence and we loved it. Second course was a beet and bresaola salad. Again, amazing. Third was calamari and octopus salad. The calamari was easily the best we ever had and the octopus was perfectly tender.  Fourth (I'm stuffed at this point) was a beef flank with roasted potatoes and I forget which other sauces, but it was delicious. Finally, dessert was a bread pudding with burnt marshmallows and ice cream. I can't believe we ate it all The service was beyond friendly. We laughed A LOT!!!  We left feeling very well treated and satisfied. I have had many memorable meals in my 60+ years and this is one I'll always remember."

Service was superb and friendly. Call it casual perfection. Food it to die for we enjoyed the lamb tartar with hummus, duck confit risotto with some fresh herbs that I couldn't distinguish. It was different, delicious and perfect"

It never ceases to amaze me how Montreal can offer one blissful dining experience after another...We stumbled upon this little gem and managed to score a  seat at the bar on a Saturday night. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. We started off with the hummus and roasted cauliflower with house chips, which was succulent. The cauliflower was cooked to perfection and had a wonderful seasoning. Next we had the roasted goat cheese with beets which was also delicious. The sweetness of the beets against the goat cheese made for a pleasant contrast. Finally the osso buco with mushrooms and risotto! I was surprised when one of the staff members brought me a steak knife.. but I never touched it. The meat fell off the bone and melted in your mouth. We let ourselves be tempted by the pecan pie, although purely out of gluttony. Well worth the detour if you're not on Le plateau and will definitely be back. Thanks for a wonderful meal!"

Really cared about our experience at the restaurant and the rest of our stay in Montreal. The food was amazing. Baked ham dish was the special and it was amazing!  Rack of lamb was a home run. Did all desserts as a share and one was better than the next. Just go!"

The staff is an absolute pleasure, and they are very attentive. The French onion soup is smoky and sweet with a beautiful cheesy crust. The oysters, so fresh! The highlight however is the Tomahawk Ribeye for 3 people. It comes with a savory Mac n cheese and veggies. Worth the trip even if it's out of your way. I hope to be back."

They accommodated my young daughter with her order AND, the best Shirley Temple she has ever had, apparently!?! (hehe) Too good for me to have a taste!  Save room for dessert.  Absolutely the best crème brûlée I have ever had! We actually were so impressed with the whole experience, we went back a second and even a third time in the three weeks we were in Montreal.  Each time, perfect service and top quality. (highly recommend the Mac and Cheese with Truffle) These guys are obviously all very passionate about what they do and it shows.  I/we will definitely be back, and trust that Henry, Francis, Joe and all the amazing staff, will be smiling from success.  Fantastic restaurant, and thank you all for the wonderful memories! À votre santé"

We ate in the neighborhood the week we were visiting Montreal, and we dined here twice.  This was my favorite of all the restaurants, and we had very good meals."
/user_details?userid=9M8-q73NnjJgAyza9CyPcg,P s.,"Norfolk, MA",5 star rating,"Great atmosphere, wonderful meal and hospitality from John and and the other owners. We're from Massachusetts, USA and we're renting an apartment in the neighborhood so we decided to try Bungalow. Fondue, chartcuteries, beet carpaccio, seared tuna and Mac and cheese were all well executed and delicious. John spent some quality time welcoming the whole family. He and his owners obviously take great pride in their restaurant, their food, and their neighborhood. We will return next time we are in Plateau Mont Royal. Cheers John!"

/user_details?userid=YoK-ieTwGkVL4bvT7FQdZg,Phil M.,"Newton, MA",5 star rating,"My friend and I happened upon the place on a rainy early evening and we were really impressed. The design is informal and elegant at the same time. The food is serious without being pretentious. The dishes are delicious and full of contrast. A chevre appetizer was rich and creamy with an acidic, tart orange puree.  I had a risotto which was fantastic. A real find."
/user_details?userid=vPBcEHG52OXgwFbHkTZDUA,Frank D.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,This place is great. Our party of 4 people were all delighted. The cooking level was perfect. The prices are not cheap but not expensive either for the level of quality. We will definitely go back there.
