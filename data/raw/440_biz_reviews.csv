Flavors are unique and interesting.It was super cold and windy December but it was worth the bit of effort walking against the wind to get here! Cosy restaurant and love the little touch of whimsy--they had animal figurines sitting on the top of a couple of light shades.  We weren't very hungry so we skipped the tasting menu and crafted our own experience with some suggestions from our server. Bone marrow toast was rich, golden tasting. Challah bread was so yum and they gave so much fresh cheese dip that I had the leftovers boxed up to go.  We really liked the calamari dish, it's a small plate though. Although I appreciated the truffle linguini, a part of me feels that the server just recommended the most expensive thing on the menu cause we asked him what was good. Otherwise, everything else recommended was on point."
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I loved my supper at hélicoptère so much I decided to reserve for their Sunday brunch and it did not disappoint! We were a group of 8 and we were seated at a long wooden table against all the windows ( arguably the best table in the restaurant !). We decided to go with the brunch tasting menu, which consisted of 8 dishes for $30 and included unlimited good quality filtered coffee. Everyone agreed that our favorite entrée was the chicken liver mousse served on a almond cake. I also really like the duck pâté served with toasted challah. For mains, our favourite was the brussel sprout and boudin dish but honestly all the dishes were fantastic.Dessert was a simple bread pudding, which accompanied coffee very well. I found it a bit underwhelming compared to the rest of the meal but it is brunch and I suppose we didn't need a fancy dessert. Service was excellent, very attentive and friendly! The staff was able to explain all the dishes very clearly in English for our American visitors. Awesome brunch for a very reasonable price! Hélicoptère has an incredible thing going."
/user_details?userid=olLL4rSOwJcYn--fGisiFA,Johnny Y.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",5 star rating,"If you want to expand your palette. This would be a place to go to! The flavors of each plate was paired out very well. We was lucky to be served by Laurie. Phenomenal server. She knew what we wanted and what goes well with choice of wine. She was friendly and a hoot! Yes, I said ""hoot"" Yes, I have an old soul! The tomato salad was amazing, the cauliflower puree on the pasta, the beef tar tar especially was one of my top favorites. They may have an updated menu since yelp doesn't seem to have it updated. Overall, if you came hungry and looking for beasting. This is NOT the place. But, if you are here to open your palette and try new interesting flavors and hang with the cool kids. This would be the spot! Great for large groups and small if you just want to chit chat and nipple on things."
/user_details?userid=x2rtzRsNrJtnKLwUa9dp1g,Mary H.,"Lachine, Canada",5 star rating,"$55 for tasting menu which is really a bargain!I think the restaurant opened not too long ago so pricing is still affordable. It's only a matter of time that this place would become so popular that price will increase just like it did at Le Mousso.To be fair, I thought the food was much tastier than Le Mousso.Friend and I went for Friday night dinner at 8 and it wasn't packed when we arrived. Shortly after, the restaurant became full.We opted for the tasting menu which everything served was excellent...except the bread that I still think should not be a dish in a tasting menu! Small tapas type of food, but everything was refreshing and delicious. The endives wish foie gras was amazing, the smoked potatoes were also tasty. But my favorite dish was the duck tartare...simply fresh and yummy.I have calculated if we would have taken the dish on their own, it probably would have come to around the same price. I would say that it is best to order the dishes individually than taking the tasting menu if you are more than 2 people as I'm pretty sure they will give you the same size of dish for most items except maybe for the scallops where they would give you one per person.Wine selection is also reasonably priced.$190 before tips for 2 people tasting menu with a bottle of wine.In all the places I've been serving a tasting menu with the quality of the dishes that was put out, this is definitely the best one I have been in a long time.Almost tempted not to give it a good review so it doesn't become too popular and too difficult to get a reservation but need to be honest and it is really a MUST TRY!Will be back to try the remaining items on the menu."
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My friend got me a gift card so my boyfriend We started with Bloody Caesars as usual.The bread and homemade butter was so good that we ordered more. It's pricy for bread but so worth it! We used the bread to later dip it in various sauces...the best being linguini sauce. We got the carrots done three ways, sturgeon, duck tartare, calamari, guinea fowl with Brussels sprouts, sweetbread, and the linguini with truffle and bacon. I liked everything but the linguini was definitely my fave. My least fave was probably the calamari simply because it was asian fusion.  For dessert we got the coffee chocolate tarte and the mousse de foie de volaille which was a salty dessert. I enjoyed the mousse but the coffee tarte I really did not enjoy. It had cardamom in it so it tasted like Indian food to me. The spice was just too strong."
/user_details?userid=av_8mRH1QkwbCvkADGbNEQ,Julia M.,"West Chester, PA",5 star rating,"Excellent food, service, and cocktails! This was one of my favorite places we'd eaten while visiting Montréal and Québec city. We chose the prix fix, and I'm glad. We got to try 10 different dishes. I don't typically eat raw fish and beef tartar because of the texture, but I said "" what the hell "" and tried it anyway. Both were delicious! Everything was delicious. I cannot recommend hélicoptère enough."
/user_details?userid=JMP9JY5JV2HfWn8ClTBb6A,Matthew T.,"Bradenton, FL",5 star rating,"Instead of the tasting menu, we went with the al cart as that fit better what we were hungry for the the night we were there.  Had a great suggestion of wine that went lovely and great cocktails as well.  This place is worth heading out to.  It was probably the furthest from our place in mile end and some interesting bus changes to get there but well worth it.  Lots of cool ideas, great service.  One of the reasons I like holidays in Montreal is places like Helicoptere (sorry I know how to do accents on my phone but it is pain on my computer where I now sit writing this thinking of the great meal!)"
/user_details?userid=za-_E0w58gRS2_9mHicmkQ,Li S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,This was an amazing culinary experience. This little resto tucked into Homa has an amazing wine selection and the staff are very knowledge. The food was nothing but amazing. Every dish was unique and the ingredients were fresh and exciting. I would recommend this resto to anyone in the city. This is without a doubt one of the best resto in the city. If you're ever in the neighbourhood stop by and enjoy this unique experience. I will be back again!!!
/user_details?userid=HmYj8wXXzzmc80DIenufuw,Sherry S.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"I do not even understand why more people do not come here. IT IS THE BEST tasting menu in Montreal for the quality (very important), the price, the value, the waitstaff and total atmosphere of being cozy but not tight or stinky at other places where you come out smelling like food and having to wash your clothes to get rid of the smell.It delivers like crazy, and I am so happy we came here. I am booking again FOR SURE to bring more of my friends and telling everyone about it. Fantastic service, wine, atmosphere, food, great quantities that aren't too overwhelming while maintaining quality and integrity.MUST. EAT. HERE. And I am picky, plus I have eaten in tons of other restaurants as well, so this is truly a gem."

/user_details?userid=9qSNf8YBfA2Vdt_ikm1nkw,Eric H.,"Wilton, CT",5 star rating,"Being a Montreal tourist, I discovered Hélicoptère on Eater's Essential 38 list for Montreal and boy did it deliver. The restaurant reminds me of a casual farm-to-fable spot that you'd find in Brooklyn, with a laid-back, comfortable dining room that is right up my alley. We were celebrating our 10 year wedding anniversary and opted for the $55 CAD tasting menu. A relative steal to get 9 inventive and delicious small plates for $40 USD bucks. The masterminds in the kitchen really push the culinary envelope and show such skill and restraint in composing these incredible dishes. The true magic with all the plates is how restrained and not overly seasoned they are, something you might expect with so many different ingredients on the plate. There is such balance and harmony of flavors and textures, where the chefs purposefully highlight the quality of the product used in the various plates and really let them shine.I posted a picture of the tasting menu for those of you who can read French, and I will do my best to describe what I remember eating. All 4 appetizer small plates come out at the same time, which was a welcomed surprise. It was fun tasting and experiencing four distinctly unique plates all at the same time.  The standout star was the beef tartar, which was buried under house made chips and coarsely grated Parmesan. The raw beef was so wonderfully fresh, if tasted blindfolded you would have no idea it was beef. The tartar was soft and luscious, probably the best tartar we've ever had. The multi-colored beets and goat cheese dish was spectacular. The quality of these beets were insanely good, and cooked to perfection. My wife loves beets and said this was the best beet salad she's ever had. The calamari dish was so innovative, where the soft and supple calamari paired beautifully with the chili sauce and contrasting flavors from the fresh mint and fried onions. Genius! The mixed melons was a nice refreshing change of pace, with the fresh, sweet flavors complimenting the three other savory dishes. The truffle cavatelli was really, really good. Wonderfully executed and well balanced, not too rich like a lot of other light cream sauces. Truly a sublime dish. Their take on a merguez sausage and falafel were also so incredibly good. From beginning to end, this was a meal for the ages.Service was top notch too, and they even remembered it was our anniversary and brought out a sparkler with our dessert. What a kind and thoughtful touch! The restaurant was packed so clearly the word is out on this fantastic restaurant, but if you're looking for a special meal at very affordable prices, come to Hélicoptère!"
/user_details?userid=L5uq2v3GnGiYi6DzO2KunA,Daniel R.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"Ooh, first to review what will surely be a star in the Montréal food scene!We were in town on vacation and chose an Airbnb in this neighborhood due to it's non-touristy vibe. We patronized both the Hélico coffee shop and the dining restaurant. Both are fantastic. Our server was an energetic young woman from Alsace who's passion shown through with great energy. Starting with excellent cocktails, the house pamplemousse and a sazerace everything that followed was a total delight. The challah and chicken liver mousse were delicious savory appetizers. The challah served with spiced cheese and peppers, and the chicken liver mousse was served atop wonderful almond puffs, matched with apricot and pistachios to match the mousses flavor. For dinner, I had the calamari and M had the zucchini. The calamari was very tender and served with cucumbers both pickled and raw, and mint. The zucchini was prepared three ways: fried flower, cold dressed and cooked, with a creamy burrata tying the whole dish together. We then split the tortellini in brodo. This was incredible. Flavors of shitaki, bacon and sesame married together to create a mouthwatering dish. Dessert may have been the highlight, though it's hard to compare. We shared a strawberry meringue that was perfectly balanced, very sweet but offset with earthy granola and herb flavors. Ambience, value and quality. 5 stars. They will be a draw to this soon to boom neighborhood for years to come."

Delightful in every way!"

/user_details?userid=EKz7dqfRtgeX7vYinqkF0g,Darrell R.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,Hot & new corner restaurant in front of their cafe. Great food & service! Excellent homemade bread & butter. The fish was perfectly flakely. The Cavatelli pasta noodles & peas are an excellent pairing. The photo of the locally grown strawberry dessert says it all. The small plates are perfect for sharing. Bon appetit!
/user_details?userid=kKli94VS3LGl2vnUVBg4HA,Dominique N.,"Gainesville, FL",5 star rating,"Hands down my favorite meal in Montréal! We were visiting from Florida and looking for a late dinner. The atmosphere is amazing and the service was great, but the food is out of this world good! The chef put together flavors that I wouldn't have imagined and created a true culinary experience. They have a tasting menu where you get five courses but we chose to get a bunch of shareable dishes! Every single one of them was memorable and so tasty. You have to come here!"
/user_details?userid=bMNE6lESSw6vLC27drn8Wg,Abigail F.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"We happily discovered this place on our first night in Montreal. Each dish was better and more unique than the next. We got the challah, the lamb, calamari and lentils. Everything was so delicious and fresh. I tried some orange wine which was delicious too. The waitress, Lorienne (sorry if I am getting the spelling wrong) was a highlight too. Her enthusiasm was so infectious and she was very helpful in giving us many other recs for our stay in Montreal (several of which we tried and were on point). Thank you, Lorienne and Helicoptered, for a very special evening and a great start to our vacation! We would to come back the next time we visit!"

Me and my dad sat at the bar and it was very nice. We decided to get the 55 CAD per person 5 course, 10 plate meal and it was a great choice. Very culturally inspired food and amazing service. Go here. You will not be dissapointed"
