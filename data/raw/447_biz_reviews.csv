In searching for a great fried chicken place, I stumbled upon Tokyo Sando and was surprised to learn that it was located inside the Kinka Izakaya on Ste. Cath Ouest. More surprising, though, was how GOOD it was. My better half ordered the spicy karaage sando and, I opted for the ebi (shrimp) sandwich. And I'm so glad I did - it was love at first bite. I didn't try the spicy karaage sandwich (as I'm not so good with spicy things) but my ebi sandwich was incredible - like nothing I've had before. It was breaded shrimp with a hint of truffle and the slight tang of pickled cabbage, not one taste overpowering the other but working perfectly together. To satisfy my own fried chicken craving, I decided to also get the black sesame 3-piece chicken as well as the Tokyo fries (fries covered in Japanese mayo, seaweed, bonito flakes and green onions). The karaage was not as crispy as I'd hoped (due largely to the fact that it was covered in the black sesame sauce) but it was tasty! The fries were fine, though it didn't matter anyway as I was too full from inhaling my ebi sandwich. Will definitely be coming back to fulfill a craving to be sure."

We ordered their Japanese sandwiches, Karaage Sando & Spicy Karaage Sando. The sandwiches were excellent! Taste, portions, quality of ingredients was 10/10. The sandwich was a simple combination of Karaage Chicken & sauces but worked great together. Would definitely recommend this establishment!"
