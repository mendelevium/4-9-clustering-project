/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I came here with my aunt during Montreal à Table. For $33 we got an 3 services. For the first service we both took the garlic mussels. The sauce was delicious! I kept dipping the bread in the sauce. And before that i was dipping it in the olive oil which was also very good. For the second service we also both took the Nagano pork shank with fries and vegetables. The waiter highly recommended this dish which is why we both took it. The pork was mouthwatering. It just melted in your mouth and fell off the bone. I liked the sauce too.  The fries were good. The portions were big for $33! i couldn't finish my main. I think also it was because we ate so much bread. All the sauces were so good that i couldn't pass up dipping the bread in them.For dessert there was only one choice. it was an apple cake with syrup on top. It was good. The cake was fluffy and not too sweet. They only had Portuguese wine. I started with a white wine and then had an espumante which is what sparkling wine when it comes from Portugal.The food was great and the service was good. I definitely recommend it and would go back!
/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My wife and I just re-visied Aldea for a nice Friday lunch. Our waiter recognized us and welcomed us like family. Where to start? Walking in, the decor is smart modern with a cool black pebble accent wall, lots of natural light bouncing off mirrors and white tables cloths, a glass wine cabinet and open kitchen. I've been there a few times and the place is always pleasantly crowded with what seems to be a regular clientele. The lunch special is a ridiculously good value for what's on the plate: today I had soup followed by a delicious monk fish atop grilled new potatoes for $17.50. The fish was perfectly cooked with a delicious light pan sauce. I would expect to pay twice the price for that dish, I'm not sure how they do it. Bravo! I will continue to frequent this place, it's awesome!"
/user_details?userid=UJZvdj3Z0OdAFuUhCrWJRA,Ian M.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I live in the Mile End and work downtown, so I've walked past Aldea, probably hundreds of times since it opened, and I was always intrigued by the inviting elegance of the decor, and what seemed to be really beautiful plates as I saw them through their generous floor-to-ceiling windows as I passed. Finally, I decided to take advantage of a rare evening off from the restaurant I manage to try it, and I am beyond glad that I did.Honestly, one of the best dining experiences I've had in Montreal. This place is a gem.The key to the whole thing, and the thread that pervaded our entire experience, is attention to detail. And it begins as soon as you walk in the building. The room is simply and tastefully decorated, with a cozy, but modern ambience. The furnishing is stylish without sacrificing comfort. Before you order a single thing, you're already glad you came. Even the washrooms were spotless on a level I've seldom seen.My boyfriend doesn't drink, so I just ordered a half litre of the house red for my self and was pleasantly surprised by the quality. It robust and fruit forward, with a nice little tannic zip - not the flabby offering you get from most places as ""vin maison"". He and I both opted for the Table d'Hote, though we were certainly tempted by the ample selection of tasty-sounding tapas. Ranging from $30-42 for three courses, the price point is reasonable on its face, however once you see what you get it's incredible.We were presented with a basket of fresh-to-the day Portuguese crusty rolls and sliced cornbread, and a lovely unexpected amuse bouche of meatball (done in a still reminiscent of brandade) with a spicy mayo. We ordered a queso fresco and tomato salad on top of the fixed menu offering, and it came out simple, fresh, and tasty - exactly what you'd hope for from a dish of this kind. Soon after we finished that our Table d'Hote appetizers arrived - Lisbon Shrimp for me, and the chef's salad for my co-diner. The salad was dressed in a light vinagrette, garnished with strawberries and some cressons (which was a nice touch), and the shrimp . . . my goodness; large, flavourful without being fishy, and steeped in a stunning rose-type sauce (I detected red pepper and paprika notes, but I could be wrong. It was so delicious I wiped every spare drop out of the bowl.By this point, everything had been so delightful, we couldn't wait for the mains, and they didn't disappoint. My veal chop was huge (at least 10-12oz) and cooked to a perfect medium, with traditional Portuguese style roast potatoes, and sauteed asparagus and broccolini. It was lightly seasoned, with the perfect amount of char. If I did it over again, I might try to get a side of the sauce from the shrimp appetizer, but that's more a testament to how amazing that was, rather than an indication the chop was in any way lacking flavour. My partner had the Filet Mignon & Jumbo Shrimp skewer, which also came cooked to perfection. They shrimp had taken just enough grill fire to benefit from the flavour, but still maintained a nice soft texture inside, and the steak pieces were tender and juicy. His dish came with the same vegetable mix, but with chip cut potatoes, in place of the larger roasted potatoes I received. He loved them, and finished each and every one, despite rapidly becoming full from the generous portions.The presentation of the plates was fantastic, and every time a new plate arrived at one of the adjacent tables we were following it with our eyes, planning what to order on our next visit. The Giant Shrimp plate, Seared Cod, and Octopus we saw all looked mouth watering, and we were wishing we'd brought a few more people so we could sample them all.We finished off with a nice homemade chocolate mousse (which was elevated by stirring a couple spoonfuls of my espresso into it), and a classic creme caramel. We had to stop ourselves from licking the plate clean.From a service standpoint, we couldn't really have asked for me. We were assisted by two veteran waiters, who were polished, without being pretentious, and friendly without being intrusive. There is an open kitchen, so we also had the opportunity to thank the cooks who prepared such a formidable meal.The bill came out to $132, before tip for 4 courses. More than reasonable.Aldea offers what are very much traditional style Portuguese dishes. They are not seeking to re-invent the wheel, but have clearly focused on freshness, quality, and careful preparation to elevate the fare over establishements offering similar cuisine (which are ample in the quartier). For my purposes, I know I will be back, and would enthusiastically recommend it to anyone, whether for a special occasion, important date, or just a really well-executed meal in a gorgeous, intimate dining room.Again, in a city with such a diversity of offerings, this was one of the most satisfying overall experiences I've had, and it will be one of a small handful of go-to restaurants for me moving forward."

The shrimp app is great and so are the lamb chops. For birthdays they put together a great desert tray and a fun song. I've been there several times in the last few months and plan on visiting again soon. Oh and did I forget to mention how clean it is?

/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Recently discovered this newly opened portuguese family run restaurant and loved it! This resto is perfect for a romantic evening for two or an evening out for birthday celebration with friends. The interior decor and open concept kitchen is simply fabulous as one can see all the beautiful dishes being prepared. Their seafood dishes are simply delicious for all you seafood lovers and dishes are reasonably priced. Service is warm and friendly...will definitely go back.

They bent over backwards to make the dinner special and succeeded. Our food was delicious. Aps were great, entrees were great, and desserts were great. Wish we were locals so we could go more often. Highly recommend!"

/user_details?userid=vhKnyBJ2TReGPLef2cJR-g,Alex B.,"Saint-Lambert, Canada",5 star rating,"When to this restaurant (not going to lie, I was primarily intrigued by their dessert ""dream natas"") and boy was I impressed! The food was delicious (the kale soup was amazing), the house wine was actually really great, the service was courteous and warm. The atmosphere was the perfect combo of cozy and clean, it was an all around great experience. I will definitely be going back! P.S. the dream nata, which is more of a whipped dessert, was SO good :) give it a try!"
