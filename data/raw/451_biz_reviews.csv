/user_details?userid=M7vDDzoPNQDN2FdTcwCq4A,Eric W.,"Hartford, CT",4 star rating,"In Montreal on business and it's #TacoTuesday so I need to feed the beast!  I did some Yelp'ing like good Yelp'ers do and found out this place has some of the best in the city, so we started our half-hour trek here (good for working off the calories) and here's how it went!Atmosphere/Appearance: Set right off of an almost... ""boardwalk"" is this place.  There are A LOT of restaurants and a lot of tourists in the area where the cobblestone streets are king.  It's not quite ON the river, but it's across the street from it with no obstructed view.  We sat right outside since it was a beautiful late summer's evening and did some people watching.  Inside is very picturesque with colorful Latin murals and wide spaces.Service: Shania took care of us and she was everything we needed her to be.  She was quick, personable and we didn't have a complaint.Food: I came hungry to say the least.  I started off with the ""special"" of the day and they were the Fried Chicken & Watermelon tacos.  Lol.  How stereotypical of me.  They were just that, seasoned watermelon, fried chicken with a tasty chipotle sauce.  They were pretty decent. Next, I ordered the Barbacoa Tacos.  The come out a little different.  The meat is served in a bowl with a wooden spoon alongside fresh jalapeno, onion, lime and pickled red cabbage.  The tortillas are laid out for you and they gave me 3 instead of just 2.  So you make your own and there was plenty of filling for all the shells.  They were savory, hot and fantastic.Value: Mexican places usually aren't too expensive but this place is unlike the others.  All prices are in $CAD.  My drink, the El Viejo Diablo was supposed to be the strongest on the menu... but whatever. $17.00.  Sheesh.  Not worth it at all.  My first set of tacos were $14.00 and that just seems high. It's $7.00 a taco!  Do the math!  My other set was $13.00 and that's a little more reasonable.  You sure are paying for quality over quantity here and that's okay, it's worth it.In conclusion, this place is cool... I can see myself wandering back here in the future, but not anytime soon."
/user_details?userid=fM_UsuFAYu2TVUqJiYAKsg,Lori R.,"Raleigh, NC",3 star rating,"Four of us stopped by for drinks & a bite.  It was a busy Saturday night in October, but they found a place for us downstairs near the bar and the bathrooms.  Not the most comfy spot and service was spotty.The Guacamole was good although the chips were a bit greasy.  I had a Chicken Tinga Taco and a Chorizo one.  I love onions but there were so many on the Tinga that I had to remove some.  Found the chicken to be a bit dry and very acidic.  The Chorizo was more to my liking as the flavors seemed more balanced.  Gal who got the steak ones really didn't care for them.  She said they were so charred and tough she gave up trying to eat them part way through.  Restroom could have used a good cleaning."
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",3 star rating,"I was underwhelmed with this place. I came here for dinner on a weeknight and there was maybe one other table of people only so not much in the way of vibe/ambience. The decor is really nice and fun and the location Is great and super clean inside but the seating is not very comfortable. Our waitress was friendly but didn't check on us if we  didn't flag her. The food was just okay as were the cocktails , not much flavour in either one and both were overpriced. I'm disappointed to leave with the impression that I can't say I would really come back here by choice."
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It's tacos time on a perfect gloomy and rainy day. The restaurant wasn't that busy; it was nice and peaceful. We had some tacos; pescado (fish) and chile poblano (corn, chili, onion). The fish one was excellent with spices all well distributed. The chile poblano was good; the best part was pomegranate that topped the tacos. With my delicious food, I enjoyed a glass of my favorite Pinot Grigio. The services was good, prompt and efficient. The restaurant is small but vibrant with all the colors. The ambiance was perfect for friends to talk to each other"
/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I am a regular at La Catrina for several reasons. First, the staff is fantastic! Second, the margaritas are very good and there are many high quality tequilas to choose from. Finally, the food is consistently excellent. I usually get the guacamole but add some chopped jalapenos to liven it up a little. The daily specials are creative and generally the way to go, for example a recent filet mignon and lobster claw taco special was as good as it gets in the world of tacos! They occassionally offer fresh fish dishes and those are not to be missed when available. I always walk out of La Catrina happy which might be the best thing I can say about a restaurant!"
/user_details?userid=bfSkQSCq-fmTIJ6RXB4BnA,Evelyn M.,"South Gate, CA",4 star rating,"the staff here is very friendly and attentive!the margarita was refreshing and delicious, they rim it with citrus salt and it definitely elevated the taste of the margarita we got aguachiles and a jícama salad the aguachiles were NOT SPICY at all which was very disappointing because aguachile is supposed to be very spicythe jicama salad was AMAZING!! with ingredients like red onion, watermelon, avocado and jicama, i was not expecting it to be so delicious but i am glad we ordered it because it was really tastyoverall the restaurant is in a nice location, the drinks are yummy AND the food is pretty good for it being mexican food in montreal, would definitely come again"
/user_details?userid=CiZ72cfkWNzXo5DT0XfG8Q,Melissa M.,"Salem, MA",5 star rating,"Long weekend in Montreal with the family and we stumbled upon this gem a short walk from our hotel (Le Weston). We lucked out on a Sunday afternoon, not too busy and we were able to take advantage of the Brunch menu. My husband and I shared a pitcher or white sangria (peachy/blood orange delish) and each tried the mushroom enchiladas (amazing!). They were amazing. My 7 year old enjoyed the scrambled eggs and my 10 year old enjoyed the chicken tacos. The service was friendly, attentive, and accommodating. Fantastic experience--wouldn't have changed a thing!"

It was of course a Monday night and I was literally the only customer there. But it was perfect and just what I needed. They apparently are known for there tacos - I had the cauliflower and cactus tacos which were incredible. Location was easy to find. Staff was friendly."

I especially liked the Tribal 103 Mezcal. The place gets super busy so don't be in a rush, relax and enjoy a wonderful location and culinary experience. The suckling pig taco special and Grilled sea bass were among my favs."
/user_details?userid=p2EafOXowPuCykUXHQcJtw,Stephane D.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Very decent margarita, tacos are fresh and I recommend the 'grilled' option over the 'fried': The chargrill taste is very flavoured. Service is very reliable and very decent. Tried only the tacos and the Mexican plan. Excellent location in the old port, not noisy because I was on the terrasse."

/user_details?userid=L_DhUhGi3V5rdKQRbd1p6g,Bianca E.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place has a relaxed atmosphere, and wonderful attentive wait staff. The music and decor was awesome, although the terrace tables and chairs do not cater tall people.We ordered the ceviche with halibut, the aguachile, the esquites (AMAZING), the guacamole, pico de gallo, the queso fundido, the chicken tings and beef tongue taco, and octopus. Everything was really good, however, the portion in the beef tongue tacos and the octopus dish was disappointing when factoring in the price.100% will return!"
/user_details?userid=d3j6IPCQC3l_xsvqVMTIxw,Suzanne P.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Amazing food and amazing cocktails. Small but lively. The staff was great. Easy to share dishes if you want. A must if you love authentic Mexican food.

We also highly recommend the Esquites (Mexican corn appetizer). Shout out to Elise our waitress who was very friendly and informative!   We will be back this summer so we can sit outside and enjoy more guacamole!"

The fried shrimp tacos were our favorite. The Poblano chili and corn tacos for vegetarians was superb. We also had a Al Pastor m tacos with pineapple and onions and cilantro- very good. I would recommend here and go back here multiple times in one week.
