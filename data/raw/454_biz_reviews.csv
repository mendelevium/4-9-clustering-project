It was all good, I mean it was like it's supposed to be, typical Peruvian sea food restaurant with cancha (courtesy of the house) and here's the ""catch"" (get it?) the fish is actually Peruvian as well, as in they caught in the Pacific Ocean, from what I've heard. You might think, why do they do that, that's not fresh... Well, the fish there are more flavourful, bigger and just all-around better in quality (for the kind of fish that are used on those dishes, like if they needed salmon I'm sure they would just use the local ones). They had good prices and were really accommodating (considering there were a handful of kids around), it's probably a good place to go in groups. We had ceviche, jalea and other sea food from the menu (I mean, it has a Nautical theme going on so how could I not), but the real MVP was the lúcuma mousse dessert. So, so, so good, lúcuma is my favourite fruit and I had yet to go to a place where I found a lúcuma dessert that was worth it (*cough cough* Mochica) and this one is! I've moved really close to it so expect to see my face here more often. Looking forward to try that Leche de Tigre on hungover days!"

This place seems quite popular. The service at first seemed fine but as they got busy, service suffered. We waited for water, for chips and service. Despite this shortcoming I was very pleased with the food. The shrimp, the calmar, the fish, and lamb; all were excellent. Nobody complained about the food. I'll return with smaller group or a friend."

/user_details?userid=_KWSSqa3_NgsQu455PHipA,bittersweet p.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Authentic Peruvian food, with Excellent service and great prices! What more can you ask for?!I LOVE this restaurant, hands down!I went to Peru last year, and so delighted to find this little gem. The food here brought me right back to Peru. Their attention to detail is amazing. I ordered the ceviche, which I LOVE, and these guys did it perfectly. It tasted great, and they even served with with the large corn and spicy red pepper (rocoto) just like how they serve it in Peru. The Lomo Saltado (stir-fried beef) was soft, but  full of flavour. The Mero con camarones a la crema (fried fish in cream sauce) was delicious. They even accommodated us and grilled the fish instead of frying it. Even the salmon salad was great. You really cant go wrong here. Just a heads up, the jalea is basically deep fried calamari, or deep fried seafood. It wasn't my favourite, but if you like deep fried food, then maybe you will like it. In terms of the prices, they are quite reasonable for what you get- the portion sizes are HUGE. The ceviche is ~$22, and considering the portion size, is a steal. Most other dishes are around $19-20, so whomever said this is overpriced was really exaggerating.Finally, the service is AMAZING! Our group of friends arrived right when the kitchen closed, but they were kind enough to keep it open for us, AND not rush us at all during the meal.If you want delicious, authentic Peruvian food, with great service and excellent ambiance, this is the place for you."
/user_details?userid=n4rK8L6C_7p0x-A3l_43vQ,Dan B.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"I think this restaurant is overpriced and the food I had was ok.I ordered the Ceviche de pescado and Anticucho. The ceviche is big enough to share and they should probably have a smaller (less expensive) version on the menu. The meat portion of the Anticucho was just right, but the salad was not really necessary.The flavours on the Ceviche were pretty good. It was well cooked, and the corn was really good. The leche de tigre was flavourful too. I was a little dissapointed with the Anticucho and expected a stronger marinade flavour.I also had the Chicha Morada which tasted like it was made with Maiz Morado, but was too watered down and was missing some of the fruit flavours that come along with Chicha. I noticed they don't sell Inca-Kola by the can, just bottle.The chips and cancha on the table instead of bread was really nice.This is a nice restaurant but way overpriced for the food it serves. If they can get the portion sizes and prices down it'd be a good value. As is now, $50 for 1 person to have an appetizer and a main course is just too much."

So, I don't know how I got there to begin with, but I landed there for brunch on Fathers' Day, just me and my 16mo old daughter. She was not in a good mood and that made me cranky as well. Long story short the staff where the sweetest people and catered to her every need, and mine, with a smile and sympathy. I won't rate the place by night simply because I like other types of outings; but if you find yourself on Dyckman during the day give them a chance to steal your heart with kindness and you'll go back. I know I will!"
