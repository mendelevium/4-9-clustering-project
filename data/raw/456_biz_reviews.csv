This restaurant exceeded all my expectations and then some!!! I could write a novel on how my evening was marvellous and how the food was out of this world delicious!!! It's an open kitchen concept and you can see Chef Luciano and staff working their magic. For me, i felt like i was invited to an Italian family diner and i was the guest of honour lol! The owner, Luciano and the maître d' Angelo (also Sommelier) along with the staff, were so attentive to our needs that it made all the difference between a good night and a GREAT night. Just one example of so many: Our waiter opened a bottle of white wine for my friend. Smelled it and wasn't sure about it. Instead of just trying to pass it on to her, he asked Angelo for his opinion. She ended up with another white wine suggested by Angelo and was very pleased with it! The menu is short and simple so you can imagine that the ingredients must be top notch! They offer some fantastic grilled bread doused with olive oil and tiny olives while we waited for our food. We opted for the charcuterie platter and the grilled octopus. Both were very good but my octopus was perfectly executed. Tender, sweet grilled to a perfect crisp. Then my husband opted for the tagliatelle porcini and i opted for the branzino (sea bass). The tagliatelle was cooked al-dente just as it should and i regretted not ordering a pasta dish. It was creamy without the cream and so full of flavour because of the caramelized onions and the veal jus. But when i tasted my fish, i was glad i had ordered it! Seared perfectly, it came with grilled vegetables and a tangy herb vinaigrette. We were so full that i was ""sad"" that i couldn't try their desserts. From start to finish, this night at Luciano is probably one of my best restaurant experience ever! There isn't one single bad thing to write or say about this place and the staff. It took us a little more then an hour to get to this restaurant. I would do it everyday!"

Great vibe, busy and very attentive and friendly serviceA bit pricey though and the portions are smallish, and the wine List, Oh !! Quite pricey for our tastes. No wine for under $50. We would not go back for that reason. Feel this would be better suited for a BYOB place....but that's us. Give it a try though and see for yourself."
/user_details?userid=LB1dC42iB6WSjPVPwt3Zqg,Meg K.,"Lasalle, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Visited a few months ago on a Wednesday with my boyfriend and had a lovely time. For a Wednesday this place was very packed which was a nice surprise. My boyfriend asked if we could be seated at the bar since we like when we see the pasta being made right infront of us. We got the cacio e Pepe and fusilli con carne (I think). We also had a delicious glass of white wine recommended by the waiter (which I also can't remember the name). Both pastas were delicious and really enjoyed the bread that came with the meal too! Great service and lovely environment

Sometimes dinner is what you put into it, sometimes you want it to work for you, sometimes you gotta make it work.Beautiful cab ride to a pre-dinner, cocktail bar for some drinks with friends for the lady's birthday. Nice time there, despite the little knock over of beer I maneuvered onto her pink flowered shoes.Threat of rain is in the air and warnings about a tornado comes across the phone.The clock strikes ""It's time to go"" time.  1212 St. Zotique east please.  We left the umbrella at the bar for someone else. We were sheltered by a cab, maybe an Uber.I really love this woman I'm going to this restaurant with, I think it's gonna be good. I read about it, told her about it.  Maybe this will make up for the salad Tupperware I gave her before we left her house.Our waitress was the girlfriend of Luciano's son. She was amazing!  So good! I wanted her to be my girlfriend, and I was on a date... with my girlfriend, celebrating her birthday!  Think about that! ""One special left! Lobster...::"",   Sssssshhh..:.""I want it!"" The buffala stuffed ravioli with lobster on topwas mine!  She guaranteed the last plate was coming this way. TTS again! I was so happy i listened to my impulse and not my research. Impulse is part of the system. Believe in it! Is a component of preparation. The bread? You like salt and warm and YES YOU DO!  Try to stop eating it... it's a drug. Poplette meatballs were one solid point, surrounded by red greatness.  We combined that starter with the non-traditional osso bucco entry which was the surprise star of the night. So original...who does that?  The ricotta gnocchi were a nice side car to our lobster fall treat.And then there was a lovely older couple next to us that were enjoying their second visit in two weeks. Art dealers!!They eat out 300 nights a year they said. Nice to live!  They asked us what we thought. We were just telling them we were hoping we wouldn't eat so much that we couldn't enjoy each other's company when we go home (I had forgotten to get a DQ ice cream cake for later).There was wine too.  WeLoved It!TTS"
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Italian food is a major weakness of mine but as someone who is half Italian I might be a little biased on this subject.  Needless to say I get excited when I hear about new Italian restaurants opening up.  Enter Luciano Trattoria in Petite Patrie which is serving up classic Italian food.  It's a small restaurant so definitely reserve because it was packed to capacity on the night I came.  If you are just two you can also consider sitting at the bar.  The space is very welcoming and features an open kitchen so you can see the owner and chef Luciano D'Orazio cooking up magic in the kitchen.  Pricewise it is what you would expect for a restaurant in Petite PatrieThe restaurant has a small, focused menu which is generally the way I like things to be done.  I've said it before and I will say it again that it is best to focus on doing a few things well then trying to serve up everything and winding up serving only average food.  They have a few pasta dishes and one meat and one fish dish.  Now I must admit I do wish that they had one or two more meat and fish dishes but you still have a good selection of dishes to choose from.I started with polpette which I'm pretty sure were made of veal and garnished with padano.  They very juicy and tender and covered with just the right amount of sauce.  That was followed by pappardelle with braised rabbit and shitaki mushrooms.  This for me was the highlight of the night.  They served the pasta slightly al dente which is how I like it and since the rabbit had been braised it just fell apart.  They also didn't try to cheat and make the dish mostly pasta.  The serving of meat and mushrooms was quite generous.  Dessert was a Nutella ricotta tart which was well balanced in flavour.  You could taste the ricotta layer without the Nutella overpowering everything.  The portion size was always just right for everything.  I always felt like I had enough to eat without feeling like I had gone overboard.Be warned that the bread here is wildly addictive.  They drizzle it with olive oil and toast it before sprinkling salt on it.  Normally the bread is such a minor detail of a restaurant meal but here it is so good you could almost just eat that for the whole meal.  If you are not careful you will fill up on bread leaving no room for the other amazing food that you will eat.  Let's just say that it boded well for me that I was absolutely starving when I came because I did enjoy that bread quite a bit.The waiters do a great job here of paying attention to the customers.  I don't think I saw them stop moving once until the end of the meal when the restaurant was starting to empty out.  They were constantly topping up empty glasses, bringing out plates and checking in on diners to make sure they were well taken care of.It does get a little noisy in the dining room and I wasn't crazy about that.  I'm not a fan of having to scream at dining companions when I eat out.  I have definitely experienced worse though.  On a whole this restaurant is an awesome addition to the neighbourhood and definitely worth the visit."
/user_details?userid=CFvuVba8YakPTsnVpOM16A,Andy L.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Service is #1 at this family owned restaurant. The staff are very friendly and entertaining, being very attentive to your needs. Our waiter even took the time to  translate all the menu items and give detailed descriptions. For food, the complimentary bread is delicious. The one-page menu has a wealth of appetizing choices to choose from. I personally ordered the salami and cheese board to start. It's definitely a good sharing dish in combination with the bread. My entree was the spaghetti cacio e pepe. It's a spaghetti pasta covered in a melted pecorino sauce topped with lots of fresh cracked pepper. The nature of the cheese makes it veer on the salty side, but not overwhelmingly so. All in all, we had a great meal and I would recommend this place wholeheartedly!"

For that reason I can't return and recommend that restaurant ever again. We shouldn't support businesses like that."
/user_details?userid=16CxQAR0tYMnwhk7TTzOgA,Erica W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I am visiting Montreal for the first time, and somehow happened upon this restaurant.  I can honestly say, I have never had better Italian food anywhere in the world.  Each course was completely mind-blowing. But, as great as the food was, the family who runs the restaurant stole the show.  They are completely charming.  The restaurant's namesake Chef Luciano d'Orazio and his wife and two teenage sons all work at the restaurant.  To say that this is an entertaining group would be an understatement.  By the time we left, we were sad to go. The warm reception we received from all of the staff at this restaurant was beyond any experience I've ever had.  TIPS:  1) Make a reservation, we didn't have one-but it was clear we probably needed one. 2) Alessandro, one of the sons recommended the Papardelle coniglio.  It was incredible. I will likely be dreaming of this pasta forever. 3) Do not try to choose a dessert, order them all.  You'll thank me. If I lived within two hours of this restaurant, I would dine here weekly.  This was truly the best dining experience I've had in my 38 years."

Simple and clean in design, warm and welcoming staff.We had an amazing lobster salad and a perfectly cooked Branzino for the main course. The place was very busy but he staff was extremely attentive and took pains to make sure we were not neglected.The menu is small because the food is seasonal and very artisanal . The wine list is very complete and we had lovely Sancerre that complemented our meal perfectly.I would recommend reservations .Can't wait for my next trip to Montreal for a return to Trattoria Luciano ."

We've been to many restaurants in different countries and never experienced a service like this before.Unfortunately, I have to say the owner was aggressive and we were kicked out of the restaurant for some reasons that I'm still trying to understand."

So bad that the hot head owner and his family communally lost their cool and kicked my family and our friends out for reasons that are still a mystery to most of us. At least i'll never forget my 36th birthday!"
