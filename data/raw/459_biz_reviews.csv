/user_details?userid=HhRcq4INJlID3helYAcLug,Melissa H.,"Fremont, CA",5 star rating,"I tried the tasting menu with a wine pairing here & thought it was extremely solid. It's definitely pricey, especially compared to other nice restaurants in Montreal, but worth the splurge at least once! I don't remember what each dish consisted of, but by far the standout dish was the seared foie gras. Foie gras is illegal in California so I try to eat as much of it as I can when I travel elsewhere, but this was definitely the BEST foie gras I've had: super buttery, not gamey at all, pretty huge portion! Wine pairings & cocktails were also nice! The servers were very knowledgeable about the different wines served & how it fit with each course. Nice experience!"

/user_details?userid=WrrBkce8Hlw13a0VfbozZA,Eleanor Y. W.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I visited Toqué by myself in Jun 2018. It was a dinner reservation squeezed into the 2-hour long free time slot before having to head to the airport. Because of this time constraint, I had to opt for the a la carte menu though the tasting menu looked very attractive.The experience was...interesting. Lots of the details of that meal has faded, but I'll always remember the scallop main course. How delicious was it? Well...I almost always browse random stuff on my phone when I'm dining alone, but upon taking the first bite of that dish, I just decided that I should put my phone aside and just focus on eating. It was almost magical...the scallops had perfectly thin and crispy crust, salted just well, and the interior was still very tender. Other things in the plate included some crispy fried scallion, pieces of mushroom full of umami flavor, and some other ingredients I couldn't fully recall. Every single bite was so delicious that I didn't want to be distracted by anything...I just wanted to taste it. Luckily the portion was quite generous so I had a lot of enjoyment :DHowever, the appetizer and the dessert were quite underwhelming. There were elements in the dish that didn't mix well with other ingredients, or just...tasted a bit strange.The restaurant seems to also have a large wine collection, but I didn't try any that time."

/user_details?userid=uZbG8iEcYmZnW9qbahj2tw,Kris Y.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"The most phenomenal meal we had on our visit to Montreal. We came for lunch, and they offer a fantastic deal of table d'hôte menu.Overall: 5/5Value: 5/5 (lunch)Food: 5/5 Service: 5/5The way table d'hôte works is that you choose a main course (differs in price based on dish, around 40-55CAD) and get an appetizer and tea or coffee included. I got the trout to start and then the quail. My dining companions tried the shrimp and salmon main. I had a bite of the the lobster appetizer which had a 13CAD supplement, and it was amazing! Warm and perfectly poached in a delectable vegetable based sauce. The trout was a great portion for a starter and was well cooked. However the quail is the star! A plentiful portion and incredibly tender and well seasoned. So delectable! Even the tea is top notch quality. Highly recommend this restaurant for lunch since it can be pricey at dinner."
/user_details?userid=ThXhCAadsHdm-6a1ulAuuQ,Sommaly L.,"Vacaville, CA",3 star rating,"Hubby & I came here recently on a weekday evening for dinner. We made reservations about 2 months in advance. I found this restaurant in the Michelin guide for must-trys when visiting Montréal. When we first came in, we were greeted by a staff member who offered to hang our coats up. We felt kind of confused at first, because we didn't come dressed up at all (we were wearing our outdoor snow gear), and even had grocery bags with us (because we just left the local Provigo, lol!). Our reservation was at 8pm, so we got seated right away. We decided to go with the tasting menu and my husband had the wine pairing. The courses were quite small. Our first course was the size of my palm... overall, we were not impressed, considering we paid over $400 for the tasting menu and wine pairing. And even though I told staff I was allergic to seafood, they gave me 2 dishes of seafood and I had to send it back to the kitchen. The kitchen was also a bit slow, took 3 hours to finish 7 courses. This is probably our 4th Michelin Star restaurant and maybe our 10th restaurant where we had the tasting menu offered. We were pretty disappointed in the food portions, as well as the flavors. Food tasted a little bland, and some flavors just tasted odd mixed together... The staff and service was great though. But maybe our pallets are not accustomed to the flavors of this restaurant."
/user_details?userid=sGJvx1MTsetDzsnrHfJHLg,Aaron E.,"Orange County, CA",5 star rating,"Toqué is often called Canada's best restaurant. I completely understand​ the argument, their kitchen earned it. My visit to Toqué started 3 days before I arrived. Every Uber driver mentioned this juggernaut when I asked them ""What is the best restaurant in Montreal?"" and then added,​ ""It is the best restaurant​ in Canada."". Needless to say, expectations were high from the jump. Toqué basically kicked off​ the Canadian ""farm to table"" scene that showcases ingredient-driven cuisine helped along through intense collaboration between chef and supplier which might seem pedestrian in today's Orange​ County but this happened in 2004 - 3 years before the iPhone. Rather than ""deconstructed this"" or ""fusion that"" chef Normand Laprise lets the natural flavors of his ingredients do the work on their own legs to stunning results. The menu is simple, the service is marvelous​, and the cuisine is... possibly as good as you will find in Canada. There is a 7-course​ tasting menu available for $142.00 which looked compelling and was probably the right call but my appetite didn't require such an investment that evening so our table decided to do a tapas styled testing tour that worked out very well. When in Quebec you ought to stick to the rich and decadent. With that in mind,​ we started off​ with the Foie Gras Terrine which is a sublime number made of meat people protest over along with Brioche points, Almonds, Raspberry and a Sumac Purée for garnishment. There is nothing not to love about this dish and I would order it again right now. Protesters be damned.Being Californian I had to try the Black Cod and I was amazed by this number. Corn Purée, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Green Beans, Kalamata Olive (powder), and a dusting of Tarragon has never tasted so magnificent together. Soft, Flaky, and superb would​ be the only descriptors I would be able to muster. The building that houses Toqué is gorgeous​ and the surrounding area is also stunning. The interior, however, is a bit long in the tooth with a 2005 vibe. I don't know that I care about that much - to be real. I truly enjoyed my visit to Toqué and would recommend a stop to anyone at finds themselves​ in Montréal. A 5-star gem."
/user_details?userid=hUAdp0AnlHwxzlxAlvB-Ag,Diego M.,"Springfield, NJ",5 star rating,"Bottom line: delicious high end dining for honestly not that high a cost for what you get. Gluten line: almost everything could be made gluten free on request and they even had gluten free bread! (Pictured)Long line: from the moment we walked through the door, we felt special. A sommelier approached us and went over the wine menu. Our waiter appeared promptly after and was very welcoming when we discussed my wife's celiac requirements. The appetizer, Princess Marinated Scallops with Strawberry and Tomato Vinegar with radish, peach water and tagetes mousse was crazy good, and main plates (duck and black cod) were absolutely AMAZING. They even gave wifey a nice birthday card and a small dessert. Highly recommend it for a night of fine dining in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=LlMfTEapbG0ikzdoqA8oGQ,Alexia B.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"Delicious fusion of French, Québécois, classic and contemporary cuisine. The dishes on the tasting menu are a surprise! My favorite dishes were definitely the sea snails and the fois gras. Hot/seared fois gras isn't my favorite preparation of fois gras but I extremely enjoyed the dish at Toqué. There were many additional accompaniments to the fois gras so that I could make every bite unique!The wine tasting menu paired perfectly with all of the dishes. However, I was surprised to see wines from outside of Canada based on my expectations of this restaurant serving more ""local"" produce. A lovely place for small family gatherings, business meetings or anniversaries. However, if you don't frequent haute-class restaurants and want more of an ""entertainment factor"" with your dining experience I may recommend going another restaurant in Montréal that provides more ""bells and whistles"" with their dishes around the same price range."
/user_details?userid=SylEGnr9k2nmB5bwKS8xfw,Brad C.,"Portland, OR",3 star rating,"AMAZING FOOD AND SERVICE.The decor is ghastly; really quite laughable, it looks like it was designed by Marriott.  Single biggest gripe.  It's appalling.  What were they *thinking*?!But this aside, wow.  Beautiful food.  Courses more generous in size than I would expect.  Only one miss out of five plates, and there was nothing bad about it, just nothing inspired.We had an exceptional lobster starter making great use of seasonal asparagus and morels, as well as a venison tenderloin main and a pork rack main.  All sublime.Drinks were excellent (we had cocktails).Service was very, very good.  Our primary server occasionally approached mind-reader level in his timing.  Bedside manner of the runners could be improved a bit, but this is why they are still runners, and I'm being really nitpicky here.I don't think the restaurant quite ticks my box for value, but certainly good for a splurge.  I think it's unlikely that I would repeat."
/user_details?userid=H5pubo53Joclw01ZPqhoMA,Cassie A.,"Philadelphia, PA",3 star rating,"I had super high expectations of Toque after reading that it was one of Montreal's must-go fine dining restaurants. I hate to say that it really didn't live up to the hype for us. All of our dishes were good, but not memorable (in fact sitting here right now I'm having a hard time remembering most of the dishes we ate), so that's a big miss for me. In addition, our 7 course dinner lasted over 3 hours. Im all for long dinners as long as the pacing is right. At this pace, we were eating about 1 dish every 30 minutes which felt a bit drawn out. All said and done we paid about $400 USD for 2 tastings, a average priced bottle of wine, tax + tip. At that price I just can't say that Toque is worth the value for me."
/user_details?userid=KE4aIUuvl8p2BABubh0cdw,Daisy Y.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Ranked #2 in Canada for 2018, and aptly so.  $160 for the 7 course tasting menu (foie gras optional,  so priced accordingly depending on what you want). I paid an extra $20 to add on 40g of black truffle (just for the sake of trying,  but my unrefined palate didn't really appreciate it). Water - ""regular"" or tap is offered.  You're also offered bread - my choices tonight was a sunflower bread or a brioche, served with salted butter. Was hoping for something a little more innovative,  but the slice of sunflower bread I had was good nonetheless. Start your meal off with a complementary amuse bouche - I had a refreshing melon foam in rosewater. Meal started with a bang with an amazing appetizer - a seabass sashimi. Lobster bisque risotto won my heart.  I had a lamb and venison  dishes as well,  both meats which I don't usually eat or care for,  but was pleasantly surprised.  That lamb aftertaste I dislike was very subtle,  and the venison was so tender and juicy! When your meal wraps up,  you're offered the option of a cheese plate or a pre-dessert (essentially another dessert). Having a sweet tooth, it was a no brainer for me to get another dessert.  Wasn't a fan of some components of the pre-dessert, but overall,  very good.  Your bill then arrives with a few sweets (perhaps to soften the blow) - I received a raspberry jelly which tasted like it was just picked off a raspberry bush and a delicious piece of coffee fudge that was bursting with a creamy coffee flavor.  Awesome presentation,  creative dishes that come with a great explanation from the server.  Pace of the meal could've been a little faster.  7 courses in 2 hours felt a little slow for me. Good portion size,  I was nicely satisfied by the end of the meal.  Excellent service for the most part; the fellow who asked what kind of water I wanted rubbed me the wrong way.  Free wifi.  Short walk from Place d'Armes metro station if you don't want to drive and pay for parking."

/user_details?userid=PYbjreZpONNMp25uRSPB-A,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"KenScale: 8.25/10During the recent MLK weekend, my wife Jun and I traveled to Montreal for a quick trip with my college friend and his French Canadian girlfriend who is from the area. We had a fun time in the city, although it was not always easy to navigate around when the weather was sub-zero and the snow was almost constantly falling. For our culinary journey, I had very high expectations for Montreal's diverse scene, especially Toqué which had long been considered one of the best fine dining establishments in the city for its ingredient-driven philosophy and marriage of French and Canadian traditions. Our traveling companions could not arrive at the city until late Friday night, so it was just Jun and I who ended up dining at the restaurant for dinner. Was Toqué a game-changer? It certainly is a pretty good restaurant, but I also confess that there were some puzzling moments throughout our meal too.The restaurant has both a la carte and seven course tasting menu options (at CAD 142 per person), and of course we went with the latter to fully explore what the kitchen has to offer. Each dish was meticulously prepared with beautiful plating, and a lot of them were delicious but some of them posed ""what if?"" questions. Yes, the sea urchin that came with ricotta cheese, marinated white asparagus, yuzu gel and green onion was delicious, but what if we had something a little more crunchy than shortbread as a nice contrast to uni's soft texture? The foie gras which came with clementine confit was also well-done in terms of texture and didn't feel too greasy, but we both agreed that it could've been a really fantastic dish had it come out a little warmer. On the other hand, the roasted trout with chanterelle mushroom and daikon shoots was quite outstanding thanks to the way peach puree gave an extra dimension in flavor to the fish. The last two savory courses was a head scratcher as well. How often do you see a restaurant serve two similar meats in a row such as quail and squab? After the quail (which was accompanied by Brussels sprouts and oyster mushroom, and was a little too salty from the combination of fir salt and Bordelaise sauce) was finished, Jun and I were expecting something like a beef or maybe a fish. Instead, we got a squab that came with roasted cipollini onions, roasted peppers and carrot accompanied by puree of shiitake mushroom and black garlic. The squab was very competently cooked to give the kind of texture you would look from this meat, but we were nonetheless confused why the kitchen would think to have a poultry feast to end the savory courses. After a delightful palate cleanser of grapefruit and gin cream along with ice cream meringue, we both immensely enjoyed the final dessert of chocolate cake and wild strawberry sorbet. The spongy texture of the chocolate cake worked beautifully with the refreshing sensation of strawberry sorbet. At least for me, it was the best dish of the night.Getting a reservation at Toqué could be challenging especially on prime time during the weekend, although the dining room was not quite full during our meal on a Friday evening. The dining room, perhaps because of dim light, felt surprisingly a little dated for my taste but the service of the staff was quite nice, and there is a large wine list from all over the country to choose from to complement your meal. Oddly, we were only able to get a written menu of dishes in French which, for a restaurant with global appeal such as Toqué, was somewhat surprisingly despite where the fact that the restaurant is located in the part of Canada where French is more ubiquitous than English. Toqué offers a very nice fine-dining experience but maybe our visit in the middle of deep winter (it was the coldest week in Montreal when we had visited) limited the range of ingredients that the kitchen was able to use, hence a curious succession of quail and squab. I guess I expected a much more memorable experience."
/user_details?userid=oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,Rod U.,"Pearl City, HI",5 star rating,"A showstopper.Canada's #2 restaurant by Canada's 100 Best 2018. THE fine dining expression of Montreal's foodie scene.  Tip:  Experience this restaurant after you have tried the other food of Montreal.  You will have a better understanding and appreciation for what makes this a true representation of the food of Quebec.Classic French techniques married with global flavors.  Not molecular or modernist.  Complete dishes that highlight a protein and its natural flavor supported by veg.  Always regional and seasonal ingredients.  Nothing obscured by heavy sauces.  In the case of Toque, it's refined with beautiful, playful, colorful plantings.  Ala carte or seven course tasting menu with optional wine pairings on offer.The menu is seasonal and continuously changing.  That said, it's not possible to follow a review's ordering suggestions.  Instead, an example of the food:Razor clam - perfectly cooked in a Japanese dashi (dried bonito broth with the inclusion of dried kelp).  The broth heightens the oceanic flavor while the natural glutamates brings out the sweetness of the clam. Outstanding, you'll wish you had more than one.Venison carpaccio - gamy, lean slices of venison loin that pairs perfectly zatar spiced croutons, tangy pickled mushrooms, and finished by a slightly sweet leek aioli.  Nothing overpowers, rather harmonizes well to emphasize the natural flavor of the venison.Breast of duck magret - Outstanding.  Magret, the breast of the Moulard duck, a kind of large breasted, meaty duck, known for its dense, slightly gamy flesh is a French favorite.  The dish showcases slices of the breast wtih well rendered fat, seasoned crispy skin atop edge to edge mid rare, tender flesh.  The black garlic sauce and mushrooms work well to enhance the gamy flavors.  Roasted root veg adds sweet, bitter complexity.Service is excellent.  Practiced and polished yet approachable and friendly.For wine, this is the place to sample and pair the wines of Canada with great food.  Food friendly for sure.  The remainder of the list leans heavily to French producers.  All approachable, fun, food wines.  Large number of wines by the glass.  Average bottle price 150CAD.Well deserved accolades.  A fantastic way to conclude a foodie tour of Montreal."

The decor is not at all romantic and more suit d for a business dinner where you want to impress a client by the amount yourepaying for a meal. I found the service to be both awkward and pretentious. Our waiter was polite but not very welcoming and the expeditor mumbled lowly as he described the dish.  The food was mediocre and not worth what you pay for.  The presentation was about the only redeeming quality.   I would not recommend Toque."
/user_details?userid=-7ytA0JLbkhXcCTyf-oceA,Oliver V.,"Ann Arbor Charter Township, MI",5 star rating,"A great experience all round! The tasting menu was perfectly paced and the wine pairings were spot on. The service was well coordinated and highly professional but still passionate and personable when describing details of the dish or wine being served. The trout amuse bouche was amazingly good and set the tone for what was to come. You can opt in or out for the foie gras, but to be honest is wasn't very special compared to the rest of the meal. For example, there was shrimp dish that blew my mind. It incorporated perfectly cooked (soft) shrimp within a thick mango/melon cold soup with the tiniest slivers of hot red pepper that was a perfect balance of so many flavor profiles (salty, sweet, spicy) The colors and scents where also so complex, you simply have to experience it to understand. I also really enjoyed the interesting stories from the sommeliers. I felt like I learned something new every time they came around. There is no written menu for the tastings so you don't know what you are going to get. I do wish that they would give a copy of the menu at the end though. A lot of high restaurants do that as a keepsake and also a record of the pairings so you can seek them out if you like them. If you are picky, there is an a la carte menu with plenty of options and I assume with larger portions than the tasting menu. Another reviewer made fun of the decor but I thought it was perfectly fine. I also prefer an open feel (high ceilings) with good lighting. There is a high table option and also standard seating so it would be good to clarify what you want when you make your reservation. I really can't find a negative about this place. Flawless execution from beginning to end. It was a perfect meal for our last night in Montreal!"

I of course searched Yelp, and asked my bestie who is from Montreal and pretty much knew Toque was gonna be the place.Reservation was made way in advance, for 9pm, since the only earlier option was 6pm.  Btw, we did arrive early around 8:15pm to grab a drink and they sat us immediately.  First thing off the bat - the ambiance.  For me, it just didn't work.  I couldn't quite tell what theme they were going for, and overall it felt a bit off putting.  But no worries, the food and service more than made up for.I must say the service was great.  Very friendly, very knowledgeable, and I felt they made the experience that much better.  As we did the TASTING MENU with 7 WINE PAIRINGS it was great to see how enthusiastic everyone was about the pairings and some of the hard to find / unique wines they had chosen.  From what I understand the menu changes frequently, so it's probably not worth me going in to depth on the tasting menu, but I will highlight some of my favorites, and misses.SNOW CRAB - This was course 2 or 3 for us.  It was delightful.  So fresh, so light, perfect texture.  I could have eaten this all night. UNI - I went with the uni, and he went with the foie gras.  His was better. Mine was just strange.LAMB - I think because it was Easter weekend this dish was added in.  WAY too salty for me and I couldn't finish it.  GOAT CHEESE - One of the two desserts, and I loved it.  Again, perfect texture with all the different plated elements, as well as beautiful! I truly wish I had taken pictures of the wine bottles, we had everything from an ORANGE WINE (not flavor, this is a type and apparently it has a huge following now!) to some locally made MONTREAL WINE."

/user_details?userid=ixx2hF11KJ9FFfbxoJAZPw,David M.,"Dallas, TX",5 star rating,"It is truly rare in my experience to enjoy a 7 course tasting meal. For us, starting at the open of dinner at 5:30 pm, we did not expect to have such a long and wonderful event. It is astonishing that every course in this French cuisine is presented beautifully and prepared such that the taste, portioning and wine pairing are as good as you can imagine they could be and more. We decided to let the chef pick the dishes for each course after we described foods we would prefer to avoid. In short, each course was a surprise as delicious.  We asked for the premium wines, which alone were well selected and marvelous when paired-one 2 oz serving of wine per course. You may have preferences in wines, but Toqué indisputably used TLC in selecting and pairing these wines and they change frequently. To make this 4 hour event meal even more enjoyable, we interacted with a large wait team as they described the foods, including the organic ingredients, and each wine. They happily made us feel welcome and relaxed through our time together-no rush to start the next customer's dining. The discussion on wines delved into the history, planting and soils, and grape flavors produced while grapes were being ripened, aged and blended. This was a wine class 401 in college terms. It was a blast if you like to really get to know wines. And, make no mistake, some of the wines boasted serious labels. To be frank, this evening comes at a very high price point, but we will remember this dinner as a highlight of our trip to Montreal and, by comparison to other fine dining in our US and European dining, one of our best and memorable dinners. The regular menu looked great too, but others will have to judge it. From my point of view, try the tasting menu for a special occasion, a vacation treat or just to slow down and enjoy a thoughtfully conceived menu, beautifully presented dishes and wonderfully paired wines."

Our waiter explained it all, suggested the perfect wine for us all and the feast began; plate after plate of perfectly executed dishes, great layers of flavour and textures, and by far, the most delicious combinations. Most of us ended up also ordering the single oyster with lingonberry infusion, on top of our tuna amuse bouche, which was awesome! I went for the wine pairing with my meal, and also went for the foie gras terrine as my first course for an extra cost and was so glad I did! My main was the Icelandic bass cooked to perfection and I especially loved the celeriac purée and perfectly cooked fingerling potatoes. The show stopper was the dessert for me, a perfect sphere of dark chocolate filled with a milk chocolate mousse and raspberry gelée over caramel and chocolate granola; outstanding and beautiful presentation. The service was at a perfect pace allowing to fully enjoy out meal. Our bread basket was always full and I especially liked the attention to detail: you left your seat, and your napkin was folded on your seat when you returned. If that wasn't enough, when one of us ran out to feed the meter, they took notice and covered the food with a cloche! Classy!!I absolutely adored my experience at this reputable restaurant and I'm so looking forward to returning for the full menu and wine!"
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've heard such great things about this restaurant so I was excited when my friends took me here for my belated birthday on Tuesday. We all did the 7 course tasting menu.  FYI You don't know what you are getting ahead of time. I ordered a bloody Caesar but it was a very average Caesar. I then did the wine pairing (5 glasses). I'm really glad I did the wine pairing and made everyone try each glass. The wines were all very good!! I liked that the sommelier explained each wine in depth and gave a bit of history as to where it was from. Every time we got a different dish it was a different waiter telling us what it was... it was if they each were in charge of remembering one thing lol.  Overall the portions were small but because their were seven courses I left feeling full and satisfied. Everyone got a piece of tuna on a little stone to start off. It wasn't part of the tasting menu... it was something extra but it was nothing special and just tasted like regular canned tuna.  My favorite dishes were surprisingly the fish dishes! I'm not really a fish person and I don't like when fish tastes fishy. These were not fishy at all. I probably would eat more fish it always tasted like that! The first dish was the flounder with a  mousse on top. The second dish was the arctic char with lemon, soya, ginger juice, fried seaweed and green onion. I was worried i wouldn't like it when I saw the dish but damn it was so good!I did the tasting menu with duck foie gras. It's $136 with or without foie gras. The others chose not to have foie gras so they ended up with octopus. I did not regret my choice! I tried the octopus and it was good but I wasn't in love and I love foie gras. I prefer the grilled octopus from Milos.  The meat dishes didn't blow me away like the fish dishes did. We had lamb which was my favorite of the two meat dishes. The lamb also had lamb tongue with beets. I never had lamb tongue before but it actually tasted better than the actual piece of lamb! The venison came with carrots and potato. It was a bit gamey. For dessert we had the choice between savory and sweet or sweet and sweet. I chose the former.  So I got the cheese platter with mustard butter and egg yolk. The cheese was very good. I wish there had been a wine to go with it but I just drank it with the wine I already had. Those who chose to stick to sweet got the bay leaf and cream brulee with cocoa and it came with like ""branch"" made of white chocolate. Both were delicious. Then we all got the last dessert which was a blueberry foam with almond and olive oil cake with a fir tree meringue and parfait with lemon cream. The blueberry foam had a bit of a weird after taste.At the end of the night they came and gave me a birthday card and left something extra on the table that was not part of the tasting menu. They were little squares of fudge and pink peppered strawberry. My favorite was the fudge!I recommend this restaurant for special occasions. They really do make you feel special and it is quite fancy so it's definitely not your every day restaurant."

I won't go into detail about the food, you really must experience it yourself. But the dishes are carefully prepared and most of the ingredients you'll learn are from the area. My striped bass for example was from Long Island, my lobster of course nearby from the Atlantic (to die for btw). They train their wait staff to know the food, and you'll see that as they rotate their staff when they serve your courses. You'll see that the other patrons in the room are there for the food, some only there for the food. The guy next to me was licking the last drops of his bisque even while the fire alarm was going off. If you want a taste of Quebec at its finest, Toqué is no questions asked."
/user_details?userid=6903ibtDSpwMDvD9Yp33wg,Susan C.,"Malden, MA",5 star rating,"Went to Toque on a recent trip to Montreal.  Have to say, thumbs up all around in terms of service, food, and ambiance.  This is a large spacious restaurant with an intimate feel, maybe on account of the dim lighting.Service was excellent.  Our waiter Jonathan was friendly, informative, and just attentive enough without making me feel like he was hovering.Food was very good.  This place is a bit pricey, and I sometimes leave pricey restaurants feeling like the meal wasn't worth what I paid, but I definitely feel like this place was worthy.  What we got:  Apps - foie (which came with popcorn and some sort of puree) and scallops (with a watercress foam); Entrees - duck and suckling pig; Dessert - thyme meringue with chocolate pieces and a granita.   Of the entire meal I'd probably say I enjoyed the foie and the meringue dessert the most.  Both were a nice combination of textures and flavors.  The foie was so rich and buttery, I kind of wished it came with some toast so I could have spread it like a meat butter.  Scallops were sweet, light and refreshing, but I wasn't a huge fan of the watercress foam.  My suckling pig entree was juicy and tender, but I wish it had a harder sear on the skin side - wasn't crisp enough for me.The restaurant also gave us a little cheese filled pastry and a chocolate at the beginning and end of the dinner.  They were good, but nothing special.  The pastry just reminded me of a bite-sized cheese wonton."
/user_details?userid=cF1oFZ2cl1xpQIsq-yA4mQ,Aretha C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Crossed off my bucket list, but once again my expectations were quite too high for this restaurant.First off, I should emphasize I came here during mtl a table, where they served a prix fixe 3 course meal for $71. The atmosphere is pretty cozy, and not tense like a too high class restaurant. They had a coat check closet at the front of the restaurant. Didn't really get to explore or anything, but the decor and setting of the restaurant was very ""hotel lobby/lounge) They start you off with bread and an amuse bouche. The bread was decent, but I wished they served butter that was salted and rolls that weren't rock hard on the outside. The amuse bouche was a tuna confit served on a rock with cracker sticks (like pretz). Interesting touch but I feel like they can improve it, maybe something more exciting in terms of flavour.Anyways, for starters we had the venison carpaccio and the sea bass rillette.The carpaccio was very mild, with nutty flavours from the walnuts, and sweet and tart from the squash. I don't think the dish really came together that cohesively (I ate it by rolling up a slice of meat with the ingredients) The rillette was mashed sea bass with dill, topped with pickles and cheese crisps. I found this one really delicious and wished there was more of it.For the main, we got the Iceland cod, and the pork loin. The Iceland cod was smooth, sweet and worked perfectly with the creamy sauce. The slightly charred vegetables added an extra dimension. The pork loin was perfectly cooked, but the thick cut was lacking flavour. I think the sweet sauce and the squash really elevated with dish. There was also a tough part I couldn't chew so I had to spit out the pulp. No big deal, but not something I'd expect from a restaurant of this calibre.As for dessert, there was a chocolate mousse and apple gelée with squash ice cream.The chocolate mousse had a delicious dark chocolate flavour, with a tart sea buckthorn berry sauce that cut through. The crunchy granola was a great touch too.The Apple gelée was reminiscent of those fruit on the go bars, you could taste all the original apple flavours. The squash ice cream and the marscapone sauce was a great addition, but I felt like the sponge cake was a bit out of place.Lastly, the offered a blueberry gelee and maple fudge with the cheque.All in all, the food was delicious, service was professional and courteous. My biggest concern the fact that this meal was so expensive, even during the best deal of the year event. A wonderful experience, but price point for regular days would honestly be too high. I expected the food to be mind blowing but it was not quite there."

I got lucky and got a reservation for a 9 pm evening. It was a special menu because it was Montreal a table week.Carpaccio de cerf de Boileau: The deer meat was fresh obviously, but the combination of flavors of the nuts with the beef was not working that much for me.Rillettes de bar rayé: This one was a bit better, mustard crispy part mix with the fish, good flavorsWe decided we wanted to try all the main course, and the waited was nice enough to get me and my friend half portions of the gnocchi. I enjoyed this dish, the gnocchi were different than the typical, they mixed it with some sort of nut or something. There was a 40$ add-on for this plate though.  The Iceland cod was perfectly cooked a flaky beautiful fish and tasted pretty good with a side of squash puree and some potatoes.My friend took the porc tenderloin, I tried a bit and it was a bit dry and the sauce wasn't anything special.The desserts, once again presentation is nice but wasn't anything out of this world.Conclusion, the place is absolutlely not the best restaurant in CANADA. Service was descent, but the most important part is the food, and it did not impress me at for 150$ per person, you can find way better!"

/user_details?userid=pq8hKpl-FSbTihJJWx0UQw,Lily L.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,Def one of the more creative restaurants in the city. I loved what they did esp with the razor clam appetizer but thought they went a bit over board with the dessert. The main course was solid but I'm not 5 star about it. I think I prefer Bouillon Bilk or Tuckshop for main course. Though I have to say that the service and real estate space for sitting is exceptional. They don't cramp you up next to your neighbors.
/user_details?userid=WEAKuClK0BjhjHWGunMXQA,Ann W.,"Northville, MI",5 star rating,"I struggle with writing a review that is as flawless as the meal that I had at Toqué. I confess that I took countless pictures and texted many notes to capture the flavors tasted. Toqué offers a 7-course tasting menu as well as an à la carte menu. In the past, we've always gravitated towards the latter, attracted to various new and inventive dishes. This time around, we decided to be surprised by the kitchen and went with the tasting menu, without knowing exactly what was on it. After sharing a food allergy, we were prepared to be amazed. And we were. So, if you prefer to be surprised - spoiler alert (until the menu changes)!The meal began with a warm, airy and velvety artichoke mousse amuse. It was a delicious start to the meal.The silky sea urchin zabaglione combined many tastes, including whole oyster, finely diced daikon and soya in its prickly, spiny shell. The flavors of the various ingredients shone in this artful and imaginative dish where soft meets spiky. This is where the restaurant excels: the skilled chefs celebrate each ingredient, including them in distinctive and complementary ways.Next up was the seared scallops topped with celery root brown butter and capers, served on a scallop shell with puréed carrots. I liked that the sweetness of the scallops and carrots were balanced by the brininess of the capers. It was very well conceived.Perhaps the only course that I did not enjoy was the suckling pig loin. While the pork was perfectly prepared, pink and tender, the herbed yogurt was overly salty, taking away from the fantastic zucchini tempura and accompanying olives and mushrooms. Because of that, I ended up eating around it. The roasted red pepper coulis, as well as the rich demi-glace, were savory.The roast lamb chop was heavenly. The thick cut of hearty meat was tender and well-marbled. Served with creamy mashed potatoes and roasted cauliflower and onions, I loved every bite of this dish, including the nicely-smoked bite of tongue sausage. We had a choice of a cheese course or a second dessert course. We chose the latter, which runs counter to the palate of the majority of Toqué's more sophisticated clientele. The first dessert featured a cloud-like popcorn mousse with a poached apple slice. It also included a creamy Geneva apple sorbet (red apple with red flesh) and included caramelized popcorn and peanut crumble. There was even a dash of a rich and luscious hay caramel. It tasted like how hay smells. The other dessert included several different chocolates: chocolate mousse, chocolate brownie, and roasted white chocolate. The latter was so different and so good that later on that evening, I searched for the recipe. Other flavors of the dish included a bright raspberry sorbet, crushed meringue, and an interesting crumble of tarragon-almond flour.As we lingered, we enjoyed a few mignardises, little bites of fruit gelée and maple sugar fudge. Service throughout the meal was first-class. Even with the number of meals that I've had, I rarely encounter this level of professional and warm service. The elevated service was a tangible ingredient in our meal. Our server patiently and knowledgeably answered all our questions and provided us with detailed information about the ingredients. While the meal took 4 hours, it flew by because of the well-orchestrated and choreographed talents of the kitchen and restaurant staff. It is one of the best meals that I've ever experienced and deserves its more official ranking as the best in Canada."

We didn't mean to save Toqué! for last... it happened as a coincidence and I'm glad we got to visit the restaurant before leaving.We made a reservation through Opentable and let the restaurant know beforehand that (1) we were going to have the Tasting menu, and (2) that I was pregnant so I had dietary restrictions. Toqué! called us prior to our reservation to confirm our dinner.Because we told the restaurant we would be having the Tasting menu, our server didn't bring us the menu. He just confirmed my dietary restrictions (no raw fish, pasteurized eggs, meat well-cooked, etc.) and our night's dinner started soon after.Before we started our tasting menu, complimentary bread was brought out. Nothing too fancy here. Because the tasting menu always changes, I'm pretty sure my pictures are a little outdated given that it's Summer now; however, the quality and creativity in the dishes are always consistent, so I hope my pictures below help you get a feeling of how the tasting menu is like overall.The quality of each dish was amazing! As the first course featured a raw scallop, mine was altered by having it cooked through while my hubby's was kept raw. Oh how I wish I could have the original dish... nonetheless, cooked or not, it was still delicious and creative! The texture of the salmon in the second dish was phenomenal.I'm not sure what Course 3 was- I forget. However the fourth and fifth courses (the meats/mains) were very delicious. Course 4 was beef while Course 5 was lamb. Again, mine were all cooked at least medium well (no blood) and frankly, it was still very delicious. I tend to not eat steaks when they're cooked more than medium, but I decided to try it and I'm glad I did. If I hadn't, I would've missed out on an amazing culinary experience! Toqué! has substitutions for all dietary restrictions, be it vegetarian, pregnancy, etc., so make sure to let your server know beforehand to fully enjoy your meal.Our last desserts were different because it contained alcohol. Mine was truly interesting but very delicious. Olive cake with black sesame seeds! It was a total eye opener for me, and I think both hubby and I enjoyed my dessert a little more than his main dessert. The plating was also visually very appealing and it tasted just as good if not better than how it looked.Last but not least- petit fours with tea. Having already had two desserts each, we didn't finish our petit fours. The house made jelly and caramels were nice and refreshing while not being overly sweet.All the servers at Toque! during our dinner were very helpful and friendly. I appreciated how the restaurant took in my dietary restrictions seriously from Openable and didn't need a reminder when we visited. Each dish was brought out perfectly and they were also very quick to clean off and prepare our tables for the next dish. Our glasses were never left empty, and certainly no one poured still water in my sparkling water glass (I know, some restaurants do! to this day).Our dinner experience at Toqué! was by far one of the best encounters we've ever had not only in Montreal but all of Canada. It's not ranked #1 Restaurant in Canada for no reason! The food was immaculate, quite perfect in my opinion, and the service we received was also incomparable. All the small things were noted and taken care of, something I definitely expect at a fine dining restaurant like Toqué. If you ever get a chance to visit the restaurant, we highly recommend the tasting menu as it's simply a unique creative experience you won't regret taking!The restaurant offers Table d'hôte for lunch for a more affordable option. À la carte is also available for dinner."

Such creative high end cuisine in a modern eclectic sophisticated restaurant. First, I had green and white aspargus with pancetta and parmesan cheese as an appetizer. Aspargus were perfectly cooked. These were followed by the atlantic halibut, which was just amazing.Highlight of the night was the wine. I asked the sommelier for something unique and he brought me a white 1989 Jura. I was first totally absorbed with the nose and then the tasting notes. A wine that I'll probably always remember and that was perfectly paired with the fish. As dessert, we tried the kalingo chocolate moelleux and the honey pound cake. They were absolutely delicious!Cheers Toqué!"

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Montreal's place in the world as a culinary hotspot has everything to do with the amazing chefs and restauranteurs that our fair city is lucky to have. And I would argue that no one has done as much to build the Montreal scene as 'The Godfather of Montreal Fine Dining' as per Anthony Bourdain - Normand Laprise. Chef Laprise, previously through Citrus and now Toqué, helped push the use of Quebec produce year round in restaurants and helped developed some of the city's best chefs including Martin Picard.With all its accolades and prestige, Toqué has been top of my 'to-do' list for a while now but I hadn't found the time to finally visit.... until recently when I got a reservation for MTLàTable this year. So, my fiancé and I got dressed up and made our way down to the Old Montreal to see if my expectations could be met.Originally on St-Denis street, Toqué relocated in 2004 to The Quartier International of Montreal across the street from the Palais des Congres. The room itself is refined and much bigger than I expected. The room also feels more vacant. The tables are separated apart enough that you never really feel like there is anyone else around you and the restaurant never feels full despite there not being any tables free. The service throughout the night was impeccable - very professional and attentive. The kind of touches you hope to see in a fine dining establishment and that Toqué does very well.For MTLàTable, Toqué was proposing a 3 course meal with a couple of options at each course. First up, I tried one of the cocktails they were offering for the occasion. The Adam and Eve - Apple Brandy, cider with clove, cardamome and anise syrup - was excellent. A nice balance of apple acidity, sweetness and the spice notes of the cloves and cardamome.A little amuse-bouche was provided to start - tuna tartare with fennel seed - as well as fresh house baked bread.For appetizers, we started with the deer carpaccio topped with marinated squash, oyster mushrooms, walnuts and parmigiana reggiano cheese. Beautiful presentation as one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. The meat itself was sliced amazingly thin, very tender and flavourful on its own. The addition of the fall veggies, the fresh reggiano and some olive oil really made it pop and provided some nice contrasts of both texture and flavour. A Toqué classic for a reason.Our other appetizer was stripped bass rilettes served with a bread tuile, dill and kohlrabi. Once again, excellent technique on display. The rillettes, using potato as the binder, were very nicely done with great rich flavour and a nice texture. I really enjoyed how the bass came through so nicely in a dish that I associate more with meat versus fish.As a main, the duck breast was screaming out to me. Served with roasted squash, black garlic puree, wild rice, pleurotes and herbed jus - the duck was simply exquisite. Perfect cook on it and great flavour. The jus has great depth. I enjoyed the touch of the black garlic as well. And of course, beautiful presentation - one of the best duck dishes I have had.My fiancé went with the Icelandic Cod served with roasted potatoes, celeriac puree, rabiole, brussel sprouts, romanesco and truffle butter. The cod was beautifully tender and flaky. The lightness of the fish was nicely complimented by the rich puree and the glorious truffle butter. Truffles always make things better!Dessert kept things going strong. First, a milk chocolate mousse incased in a chocolate ball shell with cacao granola, raspberry jelly and hay caramel. Great depth of chocolate flavour and beautiful presentation again. I liked the jelly being in the center of the ball of mousse.Our other dessert was caramelized apple jelly served over praline and cinnamon sponge cake, cranberry poached apples, oatmeal and marscapone cream, speculoos crumble and oatmeal ice cream. Lots of elements demanding tons of precision and technique. It was amazing how well the caramelized apple taste came though in the jelly. The poached apples were delicious, the cream was rich and smooth and the ice cream very strong on oatmeal. Tons of fall flavours coming through. Great creative dessert. We also received some little bites at the end - sucre à la creme and some raspberry jellies. Very flavourful and a nice finishing touch to a great meal.I had very high hopes going in and Toqué successfully met them and then some. Amazing service from beginning to end, wonderful food with high technique and presentation - you understand how Chef Laprise and his crew came to be known as the high-end of Quebec cuisine and how they are able to maintain that level of excellence after all these years. Toqué is a amazing place and we are very lucky to have them here in Montreal.Cheers!"

I had very high expectations and the service and food both exceeded them! Very glad I decided to celebrate my birthday here.My boyfriend and I did the tasting menu (him with Foie Gras and me with Fish) and the five wine pairing. While everything was really good, the seared Tuna was the standout of the meal, and top 5 dishes I've ever eaten in my life. I'm so happy that we were here this specific night, the week they got this tuna in, though I'm sure whatever else they have instead when they don't have the fresh tuna is great too. My boyfriend and I both live in Manhattan, so we are rarely wow-ed by food, so when I say that we both were in disbelief when we took the first bites of the tuna I'm not saying it lightly. He's lived there forever and is a frequent traveler, and it was worth it coming here just for me to have the satisfaction of picking a restaurant that produced a meal capable of impressing him! The wine was also great, as was the service. Not a cheap meal but definitely a must if you're looking to eat some truly phenomenal food while in Montréal."

Definitely not at the levels of other fine dining experiences we had elsewhere, especially for the price they charge.

They worked as a team and we always felt attended to, without being overbearing.The food that was served was executed on well. The Squab that came as part of the tasting menu was particularly well done. The sweet desserts (tart and molasses cake) were delicious. We did notice many of the chef's attempts at 'surprises', which is a fun concept in theory...Cons: The savoury dessert option (cheese option) was, without a doubt, the most horrid dish my wife and I have had in years. She physically gagged, and I left the dish unfinished. The nearby tables seemed to be suffering a similar reaction.We were not sure if this was an attempt at a surprise, but in our view a surprise has to be a pleasant one to enhance the dining experience.The Squab followed a course of Quail, both of which were well done but with flavours that were similar enough we felt disappointed. The Squab liver/heart was a redeeming surprise and cute touch.As a result, there seemed to be a lot of similarity in the wine pairings. Lacked variety and interest compared to what we're used to.Finally, the razor clam was well cooked but the flavours were bland. For $600 for two tastings, one wine pairing and tip I know we can do better. We'll try other options when next in town."

The only pretty big issue was the bread... I cannot understand to have this kind of second class bread we could find in Montreal 10 years ago with these beautiful dishes. It's really a shame, we would have preferred a simple toast if they couldn't have regular baguette or even a good small bread.Except for that, the meal was absolutely fabulous.Obviously the price is correlated to the quality, we spent more than 750$ for two people but we are used to that in this kind of establishment.I recommend for sure."

My husband enjoyed 2 oysters with citrus granita followed by a first course of venison carpaccio and sea snails (large enough for 2-3 to share). I enjoyed the suckling porn loin main dish, hubs had the duck breast and heart, and MIL had the gazpacho (from first course section) as her main.  So much food! The desserts were lovely, though at the price, I probably should have shared or skipped. The petite fours were a blueberry pastry almost like a mini muffin and a brown suagr fudge. I liked eating them in the same bite. Will definitely reccomend and return. Reasonably priced fine dine, not too noisy but not too stuffy. Glad we skipped the 7 course and did ala carte per another reviewer's suggestion."

Expert service accompanied each plating, with clear descriptions of both the dishes and the wines, and enough skill to answer any question we could muster. This was a true gastronomic experience, a journey through flavours, textures and combinations that intrigued, challenged and tantalized the tastebuds in turn.I can honestly say that now I can check one more experience off my bucket list.Bravo!"

We left the restaurant close to 1am. I mean really? It was a 8 course chef tasting menu. The first 4 dishes were great. But I didn't like the veal, cow tongue, or the liver. So 4 dishes out 8 I couldn't eat. I found it funny that they had waiters and waitresses walking around to refill your bread rolls.. I almost felt like they were giving bread to fill us up because the dishes were SO SMALL. I guess that's what happens when you go to super high end restaurants? The cocktails were amazing tho.

Just let them be people, everyone knows that no one actually wants to be a server and they're just there making enough money to get fucked up on the weekend.  It's also painful to watch a feigned performance when it's 2016 and we've all been to the puppet show and seen the strings.Oh one more tip: if you forget to salt the water that the pasta was cooked then no amount of adding salt after the fact will bring that pasta back to life.  Also when two people both don't eat their mains then consider taking it off the bill or replacing it with something the kitchen staff actually tastes before it leaves the pass."

Luckily, Montreal is full of both low and high-end amazing food, and so we've lucked out in that department. On a special date night, we decided to finally try Toqué. We'd been hearing great reviews from friends and colleagues, and so we booked our reservation and excitedly made our way to this beautiful restaurant. We both knew that we wanted to have the tasting menu, to allow ourselves ample opportunity to sample as much of the menu as possible. When we do this, we consciously make an effort to pick different items so we can sample each other's plates. Now, I can't tell you about all the awesome food we had, because this review would be super long. But, what I can tell you, is that the venison is to.die.for. It's been a few months since our visit to this restaurant but I still dream about the venison. So flavorful...so tender...so heavenly. I want to go back, and just order 5 plates of the venison....yummm...Sorry about that.. I had a moment. Back to the review.Service was impeccable throughout the night and the food came out in a timely manner. Although we were full by the end, we were not stuffed in a sickly kind of way (like when you go to an AYCE sushi place and overdo it), and left feeling happy. Of course, the price is what you would expect - we spent around $300 for 2 tasting menus and a bottle of wine which is reasonable given the quality of the food and service you get. Overall, excellent experience. We will definitely be back (or at least I will...for that venison). If you're looking for a nice date night where you get to dress up (you NEED to dress up here) and enjoy phenomenal food, this is the place for you!"

Therefore, I monitored OpenTable for days and finally got a Friday night reservation at 5:30. Recommendation: book through OpenTable!Upon arrival, the waiter/usher did not gave us a warm welcome, they kept looking at us. Yes, we are young and dressing informal but they should still have the best attitude in the world considering their price tag. After got seated, we both got the Valentine pre-set menu with black truffle for $155 each. I got an extra glass of white wine. The meal started with two kinds of bread with butter. I prefer warm bread but their cold bread were fine. 2nd, a breadstick wrapped with prosciutto, simple but tasty. 3rd, scallop with blood orange in cucumber water. The combination of flavour was unreal, it was the most fresh any food could have!4th, lobster, my boyfriend really liked it, the texture was amazing. 5th, foie gras pate with bread cubes. It had a creamy texture and really captured the essence of goose liver. I used to think au pied de cochron has the best foie gras in town, this dish really challenged my perception. 6th, veal. OMG, my favourite dish of the night. It was so juicy and tender, so well executed with the perfect amount of seasoning. 7th, quail. My boyfriend hated it because it was served medium rare. I loved it because usually quail doesn't any specific taste, but the chef here managed to bring out the taste of quail. It was kind of like chicken but more tender. 8th, cheese and yogurt. I like that they served these for variety but I don't really eat cheese in my daily life and can't really judge it, but the sauce that came with the dish was a great compliment to the yogurt. 9th and 10th are the desserts, I like neither. The predessert tasted like toothpaste and I don't like mousse as dessert in general. Oh, they also gave us chocolate in the end, they were good. The waiter who served the dishes was very knowledgeable and patient, explained every single dish. However, sometimes the waiter forgot to fill up our water. Overall, I'm really glad I finally dined at this great restaurant after hearing so much about it. It was a great way to start our valentines weekend."

I wish the menu had been a little bit more flexible/responsive - it was a cold, wet day outside and everyone (including our server) wished there was soup on the menu! Normally I trust a menu but this one seemed surprisingly out of touch!However, the options were quite delicious and I really loved the half or full glass of wine pairing for each course. In fact, for me they transformed the food from good to great, and the pairings were really interesting. For both courses, when I tasted the wine by itself, I thought it was fine, but the combinations with food were excellent.The atmosphere was pleasantly not too formal and our servers were charming and at ease with our purely english interactions."

""Eco friendly water, local suppliers-a culinary mastery- a place for private or large group functions, date night or general fine dining experience and large terrace. We wanted to experience this and we would suggest to always call ahead and book before coming to Montreal. Ranked Number one restaurant in Canada- we were very luck to have gotten a spot. Service was on par- we had a server that could speak both French and English and was always pleasant and very knowledgeable of the menu. We had a  sommelier speak to us about wines and was actually Impressed with the wine selection we chose ourselves :). We started off we cocktails - I can't even explain the taste- impeccable- mine was with rose water - served with a rose in it! We were offered oysters at first before our appies   But did forgo. We wanted to be sure we didn't get full on anything before the main course! We got complimentary bread which was fresh- once again I didn't have much. Our appies was a cucumber spiced seafood pate with a small breadstick! Each bit was savory. Main course- i got duck - med rare with sauté farm Fresh vegetables. My friend got lobster capellini- pasta made today only! Desert - each got one to taste and even better. They topped it off with maple fudge candy that was so soft it melted in your mouth. There was an alternate ""tasting menu with dish of the evening and wine parings but we opted to choose our own. I am sure both options would never disappoint! We were able to enjoy a 2h dinner just dining and chatting . Ambiance was elegant but warm and friendly. We got sat right by the wine display which took our vision right down to the wine cellar. I have been to many fine dining restaurants and I would have to agree with Canada's choice for French Cuisine!"

Typical french restaurant with beautifully presented bite-sized food in small in a large plate. Classic martini was well mixed with a balanced taste. I really like the sea urchin, lobster and the magret de canard (duck breast). The raw foie gras did not impress me. There was a pre-dessert and a dessert, both of which were pretty delicious.

Here's why it gets 3 stars:Food: My partner and I had the 7 course tasting menu. One of the beginning courses was interesting - sea scallops served in oyster shells, cucumber juice and a dash of rhubarb. One of the 2 desserts was also interesting and scores fairly well- chamomile sorbet and foam , with a custard like roll and buckwheat crumble. Everything else was regrettably forgettable. In addition their approach to accommodating my partners pescatarianism was appalling for such a well rated restaurant - they merely substituted dishes which contained meat with a piece of fish. Having been fortunate to have had some really stellar meals in my life, I think I can safely say that a chef worth their salt wouldn't simply replace fish in a dish built around a piece of meat. Food gets a 3.Service: We waited about 5 minutes before anyone even approached us (after being seated). That aside service was good - efficient and friendly. (Some evidently still in training servers could use some more training but that was more endearing than annoying). Service gets 4 stars.Decor: To each his own but for me the decor was in poor taste and a little confused in parts - large awkward wine cellar like structure in the middle, a wooden reindeer of sorts in one corner, and mirrors above some of the seating. That said the room was large and didn't feel crowded or sound noisy which was nice. I give decor a 2.Overall (mostly weighted on the food): I wouldn't recommend the tasting menu for the price or the experience. It wasn't bad, but that's not what you look for when you shell out the $$$.I can't speak for the a la carte."

I shared two appetizers and two entree's with a friend and it was definitely enough food. We had the pork and the duck - both were excellent  the duck in particularly was some of the best I've ever had. My first time trying duck heart - and it was amazing. Surprisingly, loved it.

/user_details?userid=aIA3Xo5YH4cg7MlHMhgxAg,Adam R.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"Toque was the only place that we made a reservation well in advance. It was good, there were some enjoyable dishes, but it didn't quite reach the ""otherwordly"" place that some tasting menus can hit.I took pictures of most of the dishes in their entirety (sometimes I forgot before digging in). They have been posted. I don't exactly remember what they all were, but I'll do my best!Drinks - They have two drinks of the day, every day. Mine involved blueberry and wintergreen as major components. On one hand, this was totally innovative and interesting. On the other, the only place I really experience wintergreen is in toothpaste, so it's hard to shake that.Amuse - A very light, gelato-ey dish. Melty. Cold. Not remarkable, but it definitely got the ball rolling.Bread - The bread was not a course, but I would feel badly if I did not mention that this was the best ciabatta I've ever eaten. And the little ciabatta crackers? So amazing!Scallop - The best course of the night might have been scallop on the half shell. It was fresh, served with a little onion and oil, as well as some Asian-influenced spices. And the entire shell was sitting on a mound of salt, some of which got into your mouth when eating the scallop, which was amazing. Great presentation, great results.Tuna - One of the most interesting dishes of the night, the tuna was kind of like a gelée stuck to the bottom of a plate. But the flavor was so rich and so good, that I quickly got over it.Foie - The foie was very good, served with croutons, vegetables and sauce. I was so excited for it that I didn't take a picture. Use your imagination.Mussels - Since the foie was a supplement, in its stead is usually the mussels. They were served in a similar manner to the foie. Also good.Lamb - I think it was lamb. It basically looked and tasted like thick-cut lunch meat. Vegetables and sauce did not really help. The non-meat version of this was seared scallops, which were much better.Duck - The main course was the duck, and like the lamb (or whatever the lunch meat was) didn't do it for me. Extremely traditional presentation, and lacking in flavor. I guess the line of fat on the duck is traditional as well, but it just seemed out of place.Cheese - Really interesting presentation. Crumbled cheese on the wide rim of the bowl, soft cheese inside, quince, Asian radishes... Interesting stuff. Not the best, but pretty good.Dessert - Another one whose design was a bit strange. It was kind of like a bunch of elements thrown on a plate, in a line. Berries and gelatto, and crumbles. Pretty good, but I don't think I'd ever order it on my own.Petit Four - Or two. Macaron mini sandwiches. Light, sweet, and a good way to end the meal.Now that I look back, the meal started really well, but ended with a whimper. A local later told me that he thought the place was slipping, and I couldn't disagree. But it wouldn't take much to get it back to a top level again."

Second on the list is Hawksworth Restaurant at the Rosewood Hotel Georgia in Vancouver. Naturally we had to try this being in Montreal for the Food Bloggers of Canada Conference. Toque is located on 900 Place Jean-Paul-Riopelle; just around the corner from Le Westin Montreal. And it is easily accessible by the Metro. Get off at Station Square-Victoria. Toque's Executive Normand Laprise culinary philosophy is all about ""une cuisine de produits"". Using fresh ingredients to delivery flavorful dishes.Toque reminds us a lot of Le Crocodile in Vancouver. It blends traditional French cooking with innovative sense of fun. The restaurant itself is modern and patrons primarily are business professionals. We recommend dressing for the occasion. Gentlemen, remember that sports coat. Oh, and no sneakers!Toque Tasting MenuTWO GLASSES OF CHAMPAGNE (2 OUNCES EACH) AND ONE OYSTER 30MENU WITH OR WITHOUT FOIE GRAS (EACH PERSON) 122WINE PAIRING : FIVE GLASSES 80WINE PAIRING : SEVEN GLASSES 105The tasting menus apply to the table as a whole.Amuse Bouche: tuna apple confit with crispy bread. I love the bright apple that elevates the taste of tuna.Blue Fin Tuna Tartare: When the ingredients are fresh, it just speaks for itself.DUCK MAGRET AND HEART 50: This warm and earthy dish is filled with shiitake mushrooms, carrots, pear, Jerusalem artichoke, black garlic purée and Madeira sauce. The duck is rich and cooked perfectly.SUCKLING PIG LOIN 50: oyster mushrooms, apple, celery, squash purée and poivrade sauce. In hind sight, we realized this dish resembled a lot of the duck magret and probably would have ordered the cod or the Agnolotii with duck confit and foie gras instead. Nonetheless, the pig loin was tender and quite delicious.We didn't end up ordering desserts. We were so tired after a long flight that we didn't have much of an appetite. For desserts, I would have loved to try the blueberry mousse or the iced raspberry mousse with cocoa and almond dacquoise, Manjari chocolate ganache, and cocoa nib infusion. They all sounded fabulous.Instead, we were presented with brown sugar fudge and white chai chocolates. The brown sugar fudge was amazingly define. It was sweet but not so sweet that makes you cringe. It melted in our mouths.Toque restaurant is a great location for a special celebration and for those who want to experience traditional French fine dining. The prices are reasonably priced and the staff welcoming. Next time, I would want to try the tasting menu simply because we've done the a la carte style already.I would recommend ordering a la carte and share the a few appetizers you have your heart set on.

You might get what I mean when you see it. Complimentary (and adorable) whole sea urchins and a bisque were offered when waiting for your dishes to arrive - not something I was expecting after sitting down shortly and then a little sea urchin on a plate is in front of you; a range of bread and butter was also offered.Appetizer: their pan seared fois gras was beautiful and felt like I was eating a painting (definitely an Instagram moment). The portion might be better shared if you want to enjoy the rest of your meal. The berry vinegar reduction was a little sour for me so I tried to avoid touching that part on the canvas. Their scallops was also very fresh, definitely worth a try when it's in season.Mains: beef rib eye was extremely tender and juicy-the shade of red was perfect and had me debating whether I should've ordered more (the bok choy was a weird pairing though). The miso puree added a nice touch while the Bordelaise sauce was also really nice, which made the dish unique. The halibut was cooked perfectly; tenderness, texture, and flavor was spot on. The colourful bed of diced veggies added a nice spark to the dish instead of it being bland and boring. However, it wouldn't be 'the dish' at this place. You might want to try the suckling pig loin instead of this one if you want something more special while you're here.We purposely didn't order dessert because our next stop was Cacao 70; enough said if you've been there. Even so, 2 truffles were given as a treat at the end of the meal (they give out different things from time to time). Every dish was very detailed and felt like an art work; definitely worth the visit if you're in town."

/user_details?userid=37pSQnVnXKl4dTPd_nrTRw,Étienne B.,"San Jose, CA",5 star rating,"I spent a wonderful evening with my wife at Toqué ! We both ordered the tasting menu with the five wines pairing. The dishes were impressive, sometimes daringly simple but always packed with flavour, prepared with ingredients that were in season at the time (green beans, girolles, peas, blueberries, strawberries, etc.). We had a Scallops ceviche as a first dish, girolles with sage as a second, foie gras, blueberry and and buckweath threeways as a third, lamb with a tomato coulis as fourth, deer three ways as a fith. My wife had a first dessert of blueberries served with a pine tree granita (!) while I had a chesse dish (see below). Wo both had a second dessert dominated by strawberry and miso flavours. All of the dishI was as impressed by the wine pairing as the dishes, as well as by the work of the young sommelier. The more predictable high quality wines often had an interesting unconventional element and most of the wines were unconventional yet delicious. We drank a Sancerre made frome grapes with noble rot, a Greek white from Macedonia, a Chardonnay from the Jura, an unrecognizable 14.5 % Gamay from Serbia (exit Beaujolais !) and a Brunello di Montepulciano. When the 5 wines were gone, I was enjoying the wine so much that I decided to switch to the 7 wines pairing, which turned into an 8 wines pairing as the staff was kind enough to serve us an ounce of Vino Santo to go with my wife's first dessert and an ounce of Beaumes de Venise to pair with my cheese dish. We finished with a sweet Monastrell wine, once again unconventional yet delicious. I have very few elements of criticism. I will say that teh cheese dish was considerably challenging (a bed of olive oil, soft white cheese, a rasberry granita AND a spinach granita) but I did not dislike it. My main criticism would be that a deer dished which included a sausage was served after a lamb dish that also included a sausage. Something like game bird meat as a fourth course would have made the central part of the dinner more varied. Overall, you should believe the hype : Toqué ! does not disappoint and is still on top after more than two decades. The owner Christine Lamarche greets makes sure everything runs smoothly in the dining room. If you are lucky enough to be a young chef (like the guy sitting behind me), you may be invited to see the kitchen staff preparing dishes, an invitation I was pleased to witness and which shows that Toqué ! is part of something larger than itself. If you stay late enough, maybe Normand Laprise will appear behind the bar, wearing a bright blue t-shirt, being cool without even trying, looking relaxed and unsurprised that his customers are having the best meal of their lives."

/user_details?userid=U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,Michael U.,"Las Vegas, NV",3 star rating,"The Why:  Considered by some to be the inventor if ""new Québec gastronomy"" and bestowed with Five Diamonds, Relais et Chateaux recognition, and nearly twenty years at the top of Montreal's dining scene a meal at Toque seemed like a perfect prelude to dinner at Au Pied du Cochon.  Helmed by Normand Laprise and focused strongly on local sourcing with a daily menu meant to focus on items most fresh, unique, and dazzling from the local markets I will admit I'd heard some mixed feelings on recent visits to the restaurant, but with my mother and aunt planning to save room for what was sure to be a gluttonous evening the large formal dining room seemed like a perfect place to lunch amongst the city's well-heeled and well dressed. The Space:  Large and spacious with high ceilings, soft wall coverings, blond wood, and plush carpet Toque feels very serious and aside from the large metal flower marker out front it certainly is a serious restaurant with widely set tables, servers speaking in whispers, and a wine cellar focused on Canada but inclusive of all the best - many visible on a floating rack in the middle of the restaurant.The Service:  All female during my visit and all friendly, efficient, and professional.  Perfect posture, peerless pours, and plates delivered with ample description were the norm throughout my visit and ever-present but never looming there is no doubt the team here is well trained.  More Paris than New York I will say that I am generally more comfortable with servers who show a little more personality, but all things being equal it would be hard to find fault in the team at Toque.Bread Service:  Served in a small box with an icy puck of bland butter a trio of breads featuring a Sourdough Roll, Carraway Rye slices, and Crostini arrived first - each was fine, but the butter was largely inedible until it had rested a good twenty minutes; a pet peeve of mine.Quinoa Salad, Squab Confit, Iceberg Lettuce, Dried Fruit:  I really don't know why I was being served iceberg lettuce in a fine dining space, but I have to say I appreciated the honesty as thin strings stood alongside razor thin radishes atop a truly impressive warm salad of toothsome quinoa, crisp and fatty squab, plus dried peaches, apricots, and plums.  A deft balance of sweet, savory, and nutty this was one of those dishes that far exceeded modest expectations handily.Quail Confit, Brandy Sauce, Eggplant Caviar, Garlic Puree, Cabbage, Parsnip and Beet Chips:  More fowl, and this one more substantial in portion, it would be hard to imagine a more juicy bird than the whole quail set before me.  Reportedly baked in duck fat for nearly half a day and plated with vegetables in varying forms, flavors, and texture the quail itself was perfect and each accoutrement helped lead the plate in a new direction, yet unfortunately where this dish came up short for me was in the sauce - a potent reduction that threatened to overwhelm nearly everything it touched.  As an added note - crispy cabbage leaves only seem like a good idea; in reality they shatter with even the slightest touch of a fork and would have been better served as finger food.With coffee supplied by Illy I went with an Americano and oddly it was brought out before my cheese course - but cheers to the folks at Toque, the refills were free and thus I was able to enjoy a few cups, including one with dessert, rather than suffer cool coffee.Riopelle with Sweet Almonds, Apple Jelly, Onion Bread:  At $8 per selection the cheese board at Toque is well culled but largely international and wanting to try something local my server directed me to this - the best cheese of the trip without a doubt and seemingly uncommon in the world of Canadian cheeses in that it was quite soft, nearly liquid in the mouth.  Triple cream and intense on the first taste with a lot of fruity and earthy notes coming forth later I've since sought this out at home and also found the accoutrements to be superlative - who knew apple jam spread on onion bread could work so well?Churros, Chocolate, Coffee Sauce:  My fault.  I have no idea why I ordered this at a place like Toque other than the fact that the other dessert options did not sound very good either.  Overcooked, over-sugared, and although the coffee sauce was good the execution was not.  Again, I don't know why I ordered it or why it was on the menu.The Verdict:  All things being equal I think I may have cheated myself by visiting Toque at lunch - a quick glance at the dinner menu all but confirms that, but considering their stature in the Canadian culinary landscape I guess I expected a bit more of a ""yes"" attitude to something as simple as a cold foie gras prep at lunch - particularly as the restaurant was less than 1/8 full throughout my visit.  Great service, beautiful room, but aside from the quinoa salad and a cheese that can be bought elsewhere nothing truly 'wowed' me enough to say I'd go back or recommend it to others."

The confit was tucked under a whole lump of cheese infused mashed potato along with some mushrooms. The duck confit was salty but underneath the mashed potatoes which were also salty made it too salty, on top of that the bourguignon sauce was super salty, I mean it was way way oversalted to the point that I didn't even want to touch it. It was a combination of salty on top of super salty, it was not a good dish to eat. Is this really Toqué? I drank so much water, the waiter kept coming back to refill me, I very much appreciated that actually, it's rare to go to a place where your water is always filled no matter how much you drink, I know I don't have to hold back on drinking water here, how sad is it that this is the high point at your restaurant?The dessert was in the same vein, sour upon sour, with a spoon of ice cream on the side but that wasn't enough to balance. The clafoutis was sour, paired with plum mousse which was sour and topped with a cranberry which was sour...This was the worse meal I've had this year. I'm not fuming, just very disappointed. The staff is amazing, they are ghosts who appear when you need them, and the service is polite but warm and cozy if you instigate conversation, and they politely disappear when it's over they really don't overstay their welcome...we had a great time nonetheless no thanks to  the food.When the amuse-bouche and the mignardise are better than the regular courses it doesn't say much about the restaurant. I came here 9 years ago, and it was just ok back then so I didn't bother to write a review. but now it's just unforgivable for a place of this stature to be so lame food wise."

You tuk all my money, but that's OK.  We went in knowing we'd have to take out a loan to eat here - - and it was worth the quick jaunt to Montreal for it. We may be the poorer but our stomachs are the richer.We opted not to do the tasting but went a la carte (French for 'arm and a leg'). I had a lamb tartare appetizer and the halibut main course. My gf had the fluke appetizer and the lobster appetizer. Hands down the halibut was but a dream. The fish was a light, pillowy bite. The mushrooms were shroomy and meaty. It was a perfect combination and probably one of the best dishes out. Everything else was great as well, and my gf enjoyed the red wine selection.This place is on a lot of 'best' lists for Canada, and it is fancy. They give ladies a hook to hang your purse from the table so it DOES NOT touch the floor. Either that's super classy or they have mice. The one-star deduction is for the waiter. He was perfectly nice, but he kept forgetting what my order was and had to come back twice. Certainly not a big deal, but why can't these upscale places ever forget to charge for one of your orders?"

My friend Fiona chose this restaurant, and it did not disappoint. Our server was excellent. The bread & butter starter was wonderful. We each had the prix-fixe lunch menu - appetizer, main, dessert and coffee. My starter was the excellent confit arctic char and my main halibut was cooked perfectly. The others at my table ordered the duck magret and braised lamb shank. For dessert, we had the chocolate and miso tartlet and the pink pepper meringue and gel. I liked both desserts but one of my friends wasn't so fond of the miso tartlet. Perhaps too much miso.  Clientele were business suits, so we felt a little out of place. Merci beaucoup!"

Specific review areas below.Service: We went to the restaurant before the Symphony and had a strict timeline to stick in order to make the symphony on time. I told the restaurant this when making the reservations and they were extremely excellent at sticking to this. In addition they offered us champagne and oysters upon arrival while we are situated in our bar seats. The bartender was extremely knowledgeable, kind, attentive, and helpful.Drinks: We ordered a french bottle of wine and it was delicious. We are big wine people so this is typical for us for a night at dinner. They had a good selection of wines from a bunch of different regions. We opted for a Bordeaux and were pleased. We also had espresso martinis with dessert and they were made ""fally"" with maple bourbon and nutmeg. It was fabulous.Food: Started off with the Oysters for the night - very good and the sauce they put on them was delicious. For starters we had the squash soup and sea urchin. Both were delicious, perfect sized portions, and spiced well. For dinner I had the duck loin and heart and my spouse had the striped bass. Both were extremely delicious, well sized, and accompanied well with their sides. The duck heart was extremely tender and fantastic, For dessert we had the blueberry mouse which was exquisite. If you go - have it. Hands down.We will be back!"

We ate at this restaurant about 14 years ago when it was a much smaller place in a different location and we both remembered this as a wonderful meal . But this time we where very disappointed the food was average all the dishes we ordered where very salty and the price for 2 appetizers 2 main dishes and 3 Glases of wine was about $300 .

The service was terrific, the manager was even able to recharge my BlackBerry while I ate, and the decor is modern yet warm. I certainly can't find anything to complain about, yet at the same time I wasn't blown away such that I can give them 5 stars. I was there for lunch and I sometimes wonder if restaurants hold back a little something something from the lunch crowd where the prices are typically not as steep as dinner.

/user_details?userid=S_1y3mzRanwVA2MOw14hcw,Doug W.,"Charleston, SC",1 star rating,"We went to Toque on Sat. (Nov. 23). The food was very good. However, the service was horrendously poor for fine dining. Let's count the problems... Upon being seated, we were asked for drink orders. They do not have a cocktail menu, which is fine. But because of this, I decided I would have a good tequila. When I asked the waiter what tequilas they had, he responded 'Cuervo.' It was a big red flag that the waiter was unaware of what liquors they have at the bar. So I went to the bar and saw they also had Patron. But that's not great either, so I looked at the scotch. When I returned to my seat, I ordered a scotch, but then the wrong one was brought out. I finally received my drink. My girlfriend asked if they had a particular scotch, and was told they did not. When she requested to see the scotch list, she immediately noted they did have what she had asked for. I ordered the lamb loin. About 5 minutes later the waiter returned to inform me that they ran out, so I could have rack of lamb. My girlfriend has food allergies, and had to ask the waiter several times to check with the chef whether particular menu items would be safe for her. On one occasion, the waiter told her it would be okay. She asked him to double check, and he returned to say that she could not eat that particular item (a sauce).As I noted at the beginning, the food was good. But even with good service, it would be over-priced. In any case, it isn't worth the hassle. The service was simply terrible. Try a restaurant where they train the servers on the bar and menu. I will never return here again.Because of service and price, I give it 1 star. If the service was good, I would have given it 3."

/user_details?userid=5YzUT0w29MSTZMJGc5B08A,Jonathan P.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"My brother and I ate at Toqué! a while ago (apologies for the delay), and we both ordered the chef's tasting menu. (The quality of the food was wildly inconsistent, so I've rated each dish individually.) Bottom line: Chef Laprise and his staff may have talent, training, and high-quality ingredients, but they could care less about your experience, your good opinion, or your second visit.MEAL NOTES(#0) Amuse-bouche: sweet corn and celery-rabe mousse. {****} The amuse was served as a soup: several mouthfuls of foamy liquid that had to be spooned out of a large bowl. Topped with a daub of melted butter, the amuse was essentially several spoonfuls of liquid, salty, delicately creamy-sweet popcorn.(#1) Tuna-wrapped crostini with lime mayonnaise. {*} This dish was a big disappointment: the chili and pepper overwhelmed the tuna, and the dish was flat out under-salted. Using a prosciutto instead of tuna may have been more predictable, but it certainly would have tasted better. This dish was also a little embarrassing to eat, because it's impossible to snip tuna fat with your teeth. Each bite engendered a tug-of-war between the crositini and my mouth, with the fish strung out between. Did the chef actually try to eat this before asking us to pay for it?(#2) Scallop, cheese, and bacon tartelette. {*****} Grizzled old culinary rule: never combine seafood and cheese. M. Laprise exploded this rule with flavour and flair. In this thoughtful, playful, and scrumptious reinterpretation an an Alsatian classic, potatoes replace the crust of the tartelette, which is then filled with in a bacon, cheese, and scallops. The potatoes, astonishingly, add air and lightness. High cuisine at its very best.(#3) Mackerel and summer vegetables. {*} A slender half-fillet of mackerel on a capacious plate, dressed with an understated sweet soy sauce, and surrounded by a carnival of fruits and vegetables. We counted no fewer than 17 (!) distinct components on the plate, including 2 pinches of different chili powders and a smear of pesto. It was impossible to grasp how the chef thought the dish should be eaten. What goes with what? Serving a plate of bewildering options to your patrons is about as amateurish as it gets.(#4) Charcuterie plate with sausage, stewed rabbit, pancetta, and black trumpet mushrooms. {**} Another visual and gustatory train-wreck. Everything on this plate was forgettably adequate except the sausage--dressed with what we think was a strawberry and balsamic reduction--which was divine. Those two small bites of sausage were two of the most transcendentally perfect mouthfuls I've ever had. (This dish gets one star for each bite of that sausage.) Everything else on the plate just got in the way of that transcendent perfection. Especially the bones: I found one in my rabbit, and my brother one in his pancetta. Now, bones are not supposed to leave the kitchen, but it can happen. You let the kitchen know about it, the chef (or sous-chef) apologizes, and everyone gets on with the meal. We found two of them. Our server apologized perfunctorily, but we never heard anything from the kitchen or from management. Nothing. WTF.(#5) Seared Kobe beef with a baby leek. {*} This was the first dish ever served to me at a fine dining establishment that I sent back to the kitchen unfinished. (My brother sent his back as well.) The steak and leek were dressed with an excellent veal-stock reduction featuring (we think) blueberries and beets. The baby leek was so forgettable even my notes can't remember it. The beef was improperly cooked: excessively charred on the outside so that it tasted strongly of charcoal (not just a hint--strongly) and underdone on the inside (I like my steak bloody, but this meat was stringy). The steak was not only inexcusably over-salted, but also served without a steak knife. M. Laprise apparently thinks that ""Kobe"" is Japanese for ""contempt.""(#6) Lightly melted cheese over summer vegetables. {***} Sweet yellow tomatoes and summer squash under a blanket of slightly melted cheese, dressed with fresh herbs and blueberry vinegar. Unremarkable except for the blueberry vinegar, which was utterly extraordinary. Another instance in which the best item on the plate got lost in the effort to impress the diner with packaging.(#7) Dessert: Raspberry tart and blackberry sorbet. {**} The tart was composed as a tower raspberries, whipped cream, and pancake crisps. The accompanying blackberry sorbet was competent, but unimaginative. One welcome surprise was the presence of tiny clippings of fresh, fragrant herbs beneath and over the whipped cream, each of which provided a startling little burst of flavor in a fancy-looking presentation of raspberries, whipped cream, and pancakes. Fresh berries are wonderful, but I expect a great chef to use his skills to improve his ingredients--not simply re-label them."

(There are also options to order individual entrees and appetizers). The tasting menu is also a surprise.Here are a few points....1. The restaurant itself it elegant without appearing too stilted or stuffy. The wine cellar serves as a beautiful centerpiece.2. The tasting menu was quite good, but it is something you should approach with caution for 2 reasons: 1. If you do tasting menus, sea snails, fois gras terrine, bone marrow, duck hearts, etc., won't come as all that big of a surprise. 2. If you don't, these things may not suit your palate.3. I had a scallops dish and a sea snails dish that were the best two courses. The cheese plate was unfocused, and the squash ice cream for dessert was high on surprise, but a bit lower on delicious. The bone marrow was better than any I have had, but part of me hopes the bone marrow craze passes soon.4. The service was befitting of a fine restaurant. The only snags came later in the meal when my table was only offered coffee half way through dessert and not offered after dinner drinks.Would I go back? Yes. However, I might skip the tasting menu."

/user_details?userid=avxD6r3_MquP6xBbiaUHNw,Karin V.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"For some reason, I had pictured a formal and reserved French restaurant, but Toqué was quite the opposite. The décor was contemporary and had an open feel with high ceilings and lots of light filling the dining room. The staff was youthful and friendly. The restaurant's vibe was one of relaxed elegance. And the same can be said about the food. It was sophisticated and modern French cuisine, but with more restraint and a lighter touch.  I had the chef's ""surprise"" 7 course tasting menu...Amuse Bouche - chilled tomato soup with herb foamPrincess Scallops marinated with rhubarb water, radish, strawberries, wasabi mousse - colorful presentation. The rhubarb water enhanced the sweetness of scallops while also making it refreshing. However, if eaten with more than one piece of strawberry, the taste of the scallop was lost.  Steamed Razor Clam, coriander, escarole, ginger, spicy soy vinaigrette - the clam was steamed to perfection and had the most amazing texture - soft and chewy without being rubbery. The clam's delicate sweetness was balanced perfectly by the restrained use of spicy and savory Asian flavors. Foie Gras, green apple essence, potato confit, asparagus, peas, turnips - WOW, I never knew foie gras could taste like spring! The foie was amazingly light and elegant with just a hint of sweetness (as opposed to the usual additions of strong sweet or salty ingredients with foie gras). I was told that Chef Laprise doesn't season the foie with anything to keep it super plump and luscious. Beautiful dish! Ribeye Carpaccio, white asparagus, popcorn powder, shitake mushrooms, miso, wasabi infused oil - the BEST CARPACCIO to have ever graced my lips! I don't even know where to start - there was so much complexity and layers of flavor in this carpaccio. I especially loved the earthy richness of shitake mushrooms with the beef and that hit of flavor from the miso. I also appreciated the cleansing bites of herb provided by the chopped scallions. The portion size was perfect for this robust dish. Squab, turnips, heirloom carrot, pearl onion - it was bold move to include the squab's clawed foot in the dish and definitely made for a striking presentation. The leg was awesome with that lovely rich taste of dark meat, while the other parts of the squab were super moist and tender from being sous vide. Hercules Cheese, mushrooms, asparagus, fried shallots, wildflower honey - much more fun than your ordinary cheese plate. I was impressed by the paper thin slice of cheese given how large the cheese wedge was. Lovely combination of flavors and textures - velvety cheese, juicy mushrooms, sweet honey, salty and crunchy fried shallots. Rhubarb Sorbet, Meringue on Strawberry & Maple Foam - the meringue was light and sweet, but the rhubarb sorbet was too tart for my taste. Overall, I was impressed by my dinner at Toqué. It was evident how much care and technique went into each course, and I could taste the freshness of the seasonal ingredients. The food was relatively light yet had so complexity. Each bite brought in different elements of the dish, continually building on the sophisticated flavors...and kept my taste buds intrigued. The ~$100/person price for the meticulously prepared 7 course Chef's Tasting Menu also kept my wallet happy. I have yet to find this caliber of food for that price in the U.S.**For pics of each course, go the my blog linked under my profile. Enjoy!**"

I thought this an odd combination to begin with - but the dish worked perfectly, the fruit pairing superbly with the delicate scallops, nothing overwhelmed.Seared Foie Gras strawberry gelee and aged balsamic vinegar - the best treatment of Foie even during our Foie-heavy trip to Montreal, when we also visited that Temple of Fattened Goose Liver - Au Pied de Cochon.  The sear was perfect, the outside delicately sweetly caramelised, the interior rich and nearly molten...

The food was fantastic, both in quality and presentation. For the appetizer, we had the foie gras, the arctic char, the scallops, and the razor clams. Everything was fresh and exceeded our expectation. The arctic char especially was full of flavor and very fresh. Needless to say, the foie gras was the best I have ever tasted, it was so buttery and the melt-in-your-mouth texture was to die for. We selected the duck, striped bass, bison lion, and veal for our entree, everything was delicious, although the bison was a little bit on the dry side, it was overall a very good experience. Again, the fish wins over all the entrees, it was very fresh, moist, and flavorful, as a seafood lover, I really enjoyed the dish. We also had a chance to try their dessert. We ordered the strawberry souffle and the cocoa waffle. The cocoa waffle was good, but not too impressive. However, the strawberry souffle was really great. Granted that it was my first time eating souffle, it tasted great and I'd love to eat it again.The service was also superb, and the servers was very friendly and did a great job at making suggestions and introducing the menu.It was a memorable dining experience, and I would love to go there when I visit Montreal again!"

Asked about the pasta dish, I said it was a tad salty, went away again.Decor: 9/10 looks awesome, well doneFood: 3/10 - Nothing memorable, had to send steak back, asked if they had a better cut, perhaps we had a bad section of the loin, but was told no, it's all like that. Wow, I showed the waiter how impossible it was to separate the meat with a fork and knife. They asked if they could replace with another dish, which came out too salty.Wine & Alcohol7/10 - Great list of wines, good local roster if beers as well.Price Point1/10 - bill for party of three was 510$ which is pretty high, I never mind unless the food is sub-par which Toque! was.I will NOT be returning, fool me once shame on me, fool me twice..."

/user_details?userid=gjwYVOucVAOAvciyWwJ4Pw,SG D.,"Piscataway, NJ",5 star rating,"I had heard so much about this restaurant, I had to try it out during my trip. Opted for the seven course menu. Selected the option with the Fois Gras. For the tasting menus, they seem to prepare the menu based on your food preferences, so you have no idea what you'll end up getting. They made a vegetarian menu for my wife. Amuse Bouche: A brioche filled with Gruyere cheese. Not especially good (brioche was slightly cold, and the cheese wasn't that soft), but thankfully wasn't an indication of the food to come. Course 1: Scallops in the shell with Rhubarb water and Wasabi Foam, with cilantro oil. Phenomenal. It was very light and refreshing. The foam wasn't overbearing and went really well with the food. Course 2: Razor Clam: Sort of an Asian inspired version. They had a soy/sesame oil broth at the bottom. Course 3: Fois Gras, Apple Water, Baby Peas. Excellent. I'd never eaten Fois Gras before, so I can safely say it's the best Fois Gras I've ever eaten :) The peas were perfectly cooked and the apple water added a nice sweetness to the dish. Course 4: Rabbit and mushrooms. Delicious. The right amount of earthiness. Course 5: Squab: Don't remember too much about this, but wasn't a big fan. Too little meat and a bit too gamey for poultry. Course 6: Cheese Plate. It was melted Gruyere with mushrooms, whipped cream, radishes and a crouton. Course 7: Dessert. By this point, I had eaten so much I can't even remember what I was eating. All I remember was that there was some sort of sorbet and white chocolate with a meringue on top. Service: Excellent. Patiently explained all the dishes to us. Very knowledgeable. One of my wife's dishes had the famous popcorn powder on it. I asked them how it was made and it was surprisingly simple. I'm going to try it out at home. Hopefully I won't start another fire in my kitchen. I also had a wine pairing with the dinner. All in all, definitely worth it, and Toque is going to be a stop every time I go to Montreal. For the amount of money that you end up paying this is a very good deal."

They give you a teaser which is chicken mousse, amazing, it is wrapped in a delicate crust and has a pistachio in the center.

Second course was flounder tartar with a seaweed mousse, blood orange and caviar, Wow! It was very fresh and when you mix all of it together it tastes divine.

/user_details?userid=PwBriZjb_u69RTujuaZPPA,Julie B.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"Upon visiting Montreal I, true to form, did a lot of research on which restaurants we should eat at. Toque repeatedly came up on 'must try' lists so my boyfriend and I decided to take the first open reservation on a Saturday night (6:30). There were no other reservations until after 9pm, but when we walked in the restaurant was almost totally empty. As soon as I saw that there was a 7-course tasting menu I knew why the reservations were so spaced apart -- the whole experience takes a few hours.And of course we couldn't resist the mysterious tasting menu, which gave no hint at to what the chef would be creating except that there would be foie gras. Overall, the food was exceptional -- 5 stars from start to finish. Some highlights for me were:- The seared tuna soup -- hot tomato water was poured at the table and lightly cooked the tuna- The foie gras course, served with berries, peas, a flaky cornbread and a pink sugar-salt mixture- The main dish, which was a unique play on 'surf & turf' highlighting perfectly moist chicken, mussels and eelI was so impressed with the food, but there were some hiccups with service and the environment that brings my review down to 4 stars. People pay a lot for tasting menus, and you want the atmosphere to be on the same level as the food. For some reason that night there were kids running around the restaurant being loud and distracting. The kitchen was fairly loud, and our service seemed to either be REALLY on (our water glasses were always filled, the servers were incredibly nice and excited about the food) or really off (it took FAR too long to get the check, there was some confusion about the cocktails offered). All in all, Toque is worth a visit simply for the food. I can't speak to the regular menu but the tasting menu was truly a wonderful treat."

The light is entirely to bright, the color and the decor of the restaurant dark browns and reds mixing into one creating a draining feeling, flowers like a funeral home and the waitrons uniforms just like my grandmothers Sunday attire.  But things start to change when the food arrives. An elegant sorbet is served with wild flowers tantalizing the senses. We choose three appetizers which where all unique and superb on their own. The white asparagus is shaved and served with a lovely display. The snails where rich in texture with garnishes of cucumber and creamy sauce. The tomato and lobster reminded me of a typical lettuce wrap and where very nice rolled up into a scrumptious bite. We ended with a lemon crud and ginger ice cream that was divine. The food really does deserve top credit, but with a decor and ambiance so bad I would say its doubtful that we return just because in Montreal so many other excellent options all around."

To be honest, I didn't leave in love with the restaurant. But there was a dessert on the menu I *had* to try, so I came back a few weeks later - and that left me pretty much head over heels.I went back in June and July, and I don't remember all of the details. So of the 13 dishes I tried (between tasting menu, and the two appetizers, entrees, and desserts we got when we went back), I will just comment on what stood out.Other reviewers have mentioned the asparagus foam. It was incredible.One of the earliest dishes in the tasting menu was sea urchin with daikon radish and organic soy. I'm forgetting some ingredients. There were several flavors, they were very subtle. Eating this and noticing the flavors was an incredible experience.Another dish was sea snail with asparagus, egg, and a sauce. I don't remember what the sauce was, but both my uncle and I cleaned it off our plates with the bread. It was delicious.The dessert on the tasting menu was a rhubarb heavy creation. Strawberry and rhubarb compote, topped with strawberries, this merenge-but-drier-and-crunchier white stuff, rhubarb chips, and rhubarb sorbet. I'm not really a rhubarb kind of person, so I am extraordinarily grateful it came with the tasting meal, otherwise I never would have tried it. It was phenomenal.On my return, my dining partner and I got the sea urchin (too incredible not to eat again) as well as oysters (yum!). His entree was ribeye with black garlic and red pepper reduction and morel mushrooms - this was part of the taster menu I had tried earlier with my uncle, and neither he nor I had been impressed by it. Whatever the issue was, they got it right this time - I tasted his entree, it was phenomenal. I got halibut over a bed of asparagus and a white sauce. There were flowers in it. This entree was among the most incredible experiences I've ever had eating anything. I have dreamt about it since my return to Columbus.Our desserts this time were good but not amazing. (Unfortunately the dessert I had been so excited to try had been taken off the menu since our earlier visit!)I don't know when I'll be in Montreal next, but whenever it is, I will be going to Toque. Probably not for the taster menu ... but maybe. The dishes, after all, will have changed ... and how can I pass up the chance to try seven things instead of two or three?"

I walked out at the 4th course of the tasting menu. Molecular gastronomy seems to have become ""add foam to everything"". The flavors were disgusting. The brioche that came with the foie gras tasted like the butane torch they used to char it. There was a BLT without bread that was a very large portion of something that should've never existed. The final straw was some nasty bone marrow concoction that tasted of wasabi and failed talent. I'm a finicky eater but my wife, a much more patient and accepting diner, was as happy to leave as I was. If you want a fantastic tasting menu in Montreal, try La Chronique."

Yes, it was that bad.  I give the restaurant one star for trying to be creative with food, but at the end of the day it has to taste great.With all the other great restaurants in Montreal, you should only go here if you cannot get a table anywhere else.

I opted for the foie gras tasting menu while my hubby chose the regular tasting. Each item is a mystery where you won't know what they will bring out to you. We also did the wine paring which we liked a lot. Although my husband wasn't too impressed with the dishes, I really thought each dish was creative in presentation and was tasty. Service is mixed though. When we got there, the host did not bring us a menu until about 10 or 15 minutes after we sat down. For an upscale restaurant, we expected the staff to be dressed more classy, but the waiters wore a red checkered shirt that just seems very casual.If I were to go back to Montreal, we probably won't go back there since there are so many more great restaurants.

/user_details?userid=sfp6PhgbQnemfeZTqfuajA,Merrill H.,"McKinney, TX",5 star rating,"Toque is the best restaurant in Canada. There-- I said it, and I await the rebuttals. Bring it on! Granted, my only meal here was over 5 years ago, but I dream about the salad I had here. Yes, the salad. (And I don't normally dream about food, either.) It was simple, it was evenly dressed, and it was the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. I really wish I could talk about the other items I ate, but everything else has been overshadowed by that delicious, perfect salad. Toque emphasizes creativity. Looking at their recent a la carte menu, have you imagined serving caramelized mackerel with maple syrup? How about tuna belly with raspberry vinagrette? Sounds intriguing and guaranteed to be heavenly. I'd highly suggest getting the chef's 7 course tasting menu, as there will be even more creativity and suprises awaiting in each dish. In addition, Toque showcases their local suppliers. All of their food is locally grown/produced. You'd think Toque comes with a hefty price tag, but it doesn't. The 7 course tasting menu (without wine pairings) comes in at $92 Canadian dollars, or $87 USD. Can you believe that? Toque is definitely worth a trip to the lovely city of Montreal. If you come to Montreal without a visit to Toque, just realize you are missing out on THE best meal of your life from Canada's best restaurant."

/user_details?userid=t1vlv1Q6-Exq_TlxeLhbIA,Leo H.,"Braintree, MA",3 star rating,"My ladyfriend and I went to Montreal for a long weekend.  We agreed that I would pick two restaurants and she would pick the other two.  Toque was one of my picks.  As big fans of the tasting menu at Radius in Boston, we both decided to get the 7 course tasting menu with wine pairing and Fois Grois addition.  The courses consisted of:-Tomato soup shooter-(Don't remember)-(Don't remember)-Poached halibut with potato foam-Fois Grois-Rare duck slice with zuchini-Goat cheese with berriesOverall impressions on food and drinks: I wished the bar was stocked a bit better.  I wanted a dry Hendricks Martini with cucumber, but they didn't have any Hendricks.  Upon further inspection of their bar, they didn't carry too many spirits.  This seemed to be a theme in Montreal; understandably, I think they focus more on wine than their US neighbors.The wine choices were excellent and matched the food perfectly.The duck and fois grois were very good, though I felt the portion of duck was far too small to represent the primary meat course.  Unfortunately, the other dishes were forgettable overall (you can see I actually can't remember two of them).  The portions did not match up against the price and the selections were just a bit too boring for me.  Everything was presented very well, but I think I needed at least one more meat course.  I should mention that my girlfriend was very pleased with dinner.  She particularly liked the tomato soup shooter, which was excellent, but once again suffered from being too small a course (Radius would give something away like this as a bonus).The service was also only okay for a restaurant in this price range.  The wait staff was not very attentive, requiring you to chase them down for water refills or bill paying.  This might just be a culture issue though; other restaurants in Montreal seemed to follow suit.Overall I give Toque a 3 out of 5.  I expect better service for my money and I was not impressed with the tasting menu.  I think perhaps I would have been happier with something from their main menu.  Toque is good, but it's not great."
/user_details?userid=ppyGrwNhpq_PJASM4ar5OA,Erin A.,"Los Gatos, CA",4 star rating,"Our evening at Toque was good and memorable but not the best meal or service I've ever had by far. We both ordered the 7 course tasting menu with wine flights. There were some outstanding courses: the rabbit with pasta, the foie gras, razor scallops with mushrooms. My mouth is watering just thinking about the rabbit. But the service was off. Our main waitress was competent enough but several of the food runners did not have a good enough grasp of English to describe the dishes. This should not happen at a 5 star restaurant in a bilingual city. The staff who deals with customers should speak both of those languages fluently. There is a level of service at fine dining restaurants that I did not feel Toque met. It was no one thing but the entire evening. It was a fine evening but at $420 for two, not one that will be repeated."

Judging from the other reviews, the tasting menu seems to be the way to go. We were in a bit of a rush so opted for a la carte. We started with a few oysters, which were disappointing. Our main courses consisted of the suckling pig loin and the tagliatelle, both of which were very ordinary. I've read reviews to the contrary, but I found the decor very tacky. The purple walls didn't work, and the background music made us feel like we were in a hotel lobby. The place lacked a drop of warmth."

It was light and not too sweet. Really different and delicious.Overall, if you're looking for a great meal with excellent service. I would highly recommend Toque!! We went on a Saturday night.  The restaurant was full, but we were not rushed at all.  Again, tables were spaced out nicely, so we did not hear other people's conversations.  I would love to try their other desserts.  The selections all sounded very creative, different, and I'm sure delicious.  If they can make me crave for zucchini cake and squash ice cream , I'm sure everything else on the menu would be awesome!"

Having dined here over six times in the past two years I can truely say I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fine dining. The restaurant decor is modern and very clean lines; good size comfortable bar; nice wine cellar, open dining area. All service staff is very professional and polite.I have had the tasting menu four time and everytime it was different and delicious. The other times I ordered off the menu. Menu is varied and has a very good selection. The salads, fish, seafood and game have all been delicious. The wine selection is very good. You really can't go wrong eating here if you are entertaining. The crowd is a mix of professionals, business types, but mostly thirties to fifty year olds.

/user_details?userid=rYduaRSe23tF3_LvSYc0lA,S M.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"We first went to Toque years ago when it was still in the old location. We had the chef's menu (I had the one with Foie Gras and my husband had one without), which we did not know what to expect. Every dish was a pleasant surprise: the food was impeccable and the presentation was extremely impressive! It was by far our best dining experience ever.When we visited Montreal again, we went back to Toque in its current location. It was much centered location and the dinning room was bigger, but it also became less personal. The food was still good but too much Asian influence this time. Because of my background, it was not nearly as innovative as the first time. Our expectation was so high that we were slightly disappointed. It was still a very nice restaurant but with the exchange rate, we found it to be too expensive, especially considered the alternatives (there are tons of great restaurants in town). We will recommend it to someone who has a lot of money and wouldn't mind to spend on a meal. However, for us, it is no longer our number one choice in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=dIHn7bJ7vH-EWNrb6ZLwBA,Ross P.,"Lomita, CA",5 star rating,"Expensive and perfect.  I was at Toque a few years ago, and it blew my mind.  There are dishes that are hard to reproduce, and you are treated like royalty.  At $300-500 per couple, you expect nothing less.This is a once a year or every few year experience for us.  It is about perfection, and the waiters (who seem to outnumber the guests) make sure that you get perfection.  They clear everything between each dish (and we had 7 tastings).  They also explain the dishes in a way that is scripted.  The food is so creative, I don't know where to begin, but some of these dishes obviously require huge preparation and special equipment.  I felt like I was a visiting chef on a food show, and they were doing this just for me.I recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to experience both food and service that is over-the top.  Save up and go - but it will set you back - be prepared."

Everything, and I mean everything from the greeting to the decor and place settings, the service and of course the food is in a class by itself. Every morsel of food that I put in my mouth had very obviously been thought out, prepared with mastery and combined perfectly. Each visit also allowed me to discover new tastes. Something rather rare given my love for food and my constant quest for new and exciting culinary experiences. The decor and service are both conducive to slowly savoring every bite of your meal. There is no question in my mind that Toque is the best restaurant in Montreal. It's really in a class of it's own."

/user_details?userid=Y_CW45WfOUtqwzN6HtuXRA,Amy Z.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"Toque, work in progress. Setting - Décor was a little dated and dining room was stuffy. Food- Amuse bouclé: corn soup had a flat flavor and lack of texture. No, it does not taste like popcorn! Oysters: maybe it was our luck, the oysters were Not fresh that night and left us with a fishy taste to start our meal. Foie gras Terrine: ask the server for a plate of sea salt, otherwise, the terrine was pretty good. I especially enjoyed the warm and EXTREMELY buttery brioche bread. Scallops: cooked perfectly, but not very memorable. Entrée Gnocchi cooked with Foie Gras was the star of the night! Perfectly flavorful Ricotta Gnocchi topped with LOTS of foie gras pieces. Although oily, it was very tasty. Entrée suckling pig - bring your own knife, because Toque does not have steak knives. The waiter was really nice and offered to send back to the kitchen and have it cut up. But the pork was a little over cooked with very little flavor. I wish they could be a little more generous with the jus. Dessert chocolate cake - plain, simple, nothing special. For a restaurant like Toque, with a celebrity chef's name one the door, the price tag on the menu, and the ambiance it tries to create, we went with a lot of expectations, but it fell short in many ways. Overall, the food was good, but we found it safe and uninventive. Other than the gnocchi with foie gras, everything else, including the decor, still has a lot of room to improve."

So we were excited to secure a reservation (albeit a pretty late one) on our weekend trip here.Food was good, not phenomenal. I had the foie gras tasting dinner while he had the regular tasting. Silly me, I requested for the foie in the form of a terrine instead. The chef was able to accomodate my request and I enjoyed the terrine (thinking back now, I wonder if I made the right decision to swap...) but later on in the tasting, I somehow felt that the taste of dishes seem similar to that of the terrine (probably because he used the same ingredients e.g. strawberries etc). He said I can't really judge it since I requested  a swap... perhaps I should have stuck to the original menu. Oh well. I'm not a big fan of their squab. The meat itself it too gamey for me. However, I did enjoy dinner here. My very first tasting! We spent a bomb here that night. I offered to split but he took on the entire bill. So sweet."

I ordered the gazpacho with king crab and tabasco sorbet as a starter and the tagliatelle with foie gras and morel mushrooms as my main. Both were absolutely delicious. I'm glad I went with the gazpacho because that tagliatelle was SUPER rich. The service here was great. Our server was very nice as was the rest of the staff. The reason why I gave it four stars instead of five was because of the ridiculous water charge. Our table of four was charge four dollars per person essentially for water. $16 for water?! WHY? We didn't ask for bottled or sparkling water. It was just an unpleasant surprise at the end of a great meal.
/user_details?userid=sJ13EU6Hpg907PPc8tvpHw,Heidi M.,"Littleton, MA",5 star rating,"Consider yourself lucky if you can dine at this restaurant.  I went and had the seven course tasting menu, sans foie and sans non fish.  (I am pescatarian - vegetarian that eats fish/crustaceans).  While it IS very expensive (200 bucks or so with two glasses of wine) it was a very nice experience.  It started with an amuse bouche which was milk ice cream with this most amazing salt on it.  I tasted the salt in several courses and the chef must have a special salt he imports because it is fantastic!  These little firebombs of flavor!  Each course hit the tastebud in a special way - salt, bitter, sweet, sour.  First course sea urchin!  My first time eating it!  It was a delicate flavor with some nice accoutrements.  Next course prawns cut in half with tornberries, a non-native invasive species to Canada that were bitter but so interesting!  They added a nice punch to the sauce.  Then some very tender lobster that kept the beautiful lobster taste but complemented with a nice delicate sauce.  After that cuttlefish - ok out of all the courses this is one I WOULD not have chosen.  I am a biologist and the cuttlefish cooked had a lot of similarity to the one alive and that kind of bothered me all night.  I have an affinity for octopus (living) so that might have been it.  It had that salt on it though that made it taste fantastic!  Then halibut, cheese course with honey (AWESOME ate the whole thing even though full, and the last course dessert.  Out of all the courses perhaps this was my least favorite.  Perhaps it is because I am a chocoholic?  I don't know but it was a lime sorbet and a sugar pink ice cream with mint.  I also am not a huge mint fan.  It was very well done so I can't ding this course simply because I want chocolate no mint!  The plate was very pretty although a bit less aesthetically pleasing than the others.  There were these crunchy pink things (no idea what) that I did not like.All in all - if you are going to go, gird up your credit card and go for the seven courses.  The chef will make it to order for you!  (Allergies, etc.)  Trust him and be adventurous!  I think if you are ever going to try a tasting menu, try it here!  It is well worth it. Can I just say that it IS expensive (deserved or not you decide.)  The people eating here don't seem to care - mostly locals so use that as a barometer..  I sat at the bar (my choice, let a couple take the table I was dining alone) and all the folks at the bar did the tasting menu.  The couple next to me did foie, tasting menu, and wine pairing.  Easily a 500 dollar meal.  So let that show you how highly it is rated.What is with the napkin folding thing other reviewers mention?  Really?  I sat at the bar so didn't expect that at all but the bartender was so kind, helpful with the wine selection I made, and very interesting to talk to."
/user_details?userid=P4klt_2BqL3jlcdLvoHlvQ,Andrew W.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"My wife and I went to Toque last weekend. It was my fifth or sixth time here, and to be honest, it was a disaster when compared to my other meals here. It seems as if they're trying to get too haute for their own good.This was our meal...Amuse-bouche: Some small cantaloupe juice with oil, pepper, and some other spices. Really not of any sort of substance at all, and relatively simple flavors, but it did start to bubble in front of us and provided a neat little distraction. 6.5/10Scallop course: Very good, but this is expected. It's hard to go wrong with a princess scallop, and some interesting flavors (apple cider was used I believe).  7.5/10Tuna Sashimi: Very well presented dish, and good quality fish, but I'm not a huge tuna fan. It was interesting enough however, and I was happy to get the tuna out of the way (it seems to be an inevitability with tasting menus now a days. 6/10Halibut (for my wife), Foie gras terrine (for myself): The halibut is divine. I think Toque is the restaurant that first introduced me to well cooked halibut. The dish was maybe a touch too salty, but nonetheless, wonderful. 9/10The foie gras was also very good. The presentation could have likely been improved upon, but overall it was one of the better terrines I've had. I believe they had some mini brioches on there which were very good. 9/10At this point we're both very happy, and excited with the way the meal's been going, and are quite pleased with out choice (only 1 day in Montreal so it was Toque over Europea). Also, it's worth noting that the bread is excellent as well. This is where the wheels come off however. Cooked Tuna: What a disappointment. Tuna again. To be fair, the presentation was good, and the sauces and foams served alongside the fish were very well done, although I didn't feel they were the best suited to complement tuna. I could certainly see someone who likes tuna being a fan of this, but even if I were a fan it still could be approved upon. Factor in the banality of tuna, alongside my dislike of it I really want to give this a lower score, but to be unbiased I'll give it a 6/10Squab: Well folks...there you have it. A main course of squab...completing the meal consisting of only fish and poultry. No pork. No beef. No venison. This was particularly disappointing. Under normal conditions this dish would have been a 5/10. It wasn't too well presented, nor was it particularly tasty. To be honest, it was very gamy, and the garnishes and vegetables alongside it were all very bland. At this point, I was pretty unhappy with the meal, but was hoping things would get better with a nice dessert. 3/10Cheese Plate: I don't remember too much about this. Nothing to write home about certainly, especially regarding the cheese selection. That being said, they had some port jelly drops which were something special. They tickled my imagination for what else can be done with food, and for that alone 7.5/10Dessert: Catastrophe. This was seriously the worst dessert I've ever had in any self respecting restaurant. There were a handful of things on the plate, and not one was good. They included...Caramel Sauce (tasted like old smackers, something out of a horror movie diner)Some rectangular creation that was much to sweet and had the consistency of mushed together fruit rollups. I couldn't taste what it was supposed to be as I was too oppressed by the overwhelming sweetness. Granola. Yes ladies and gentlemen. Granola. Like out of some whole foods cereal. I can't tell if this was intentional or if the chef had his toddler in the back whom just spilled his granola snack over my dessert, but it was there. Did I yet say I hate granola? There was also a glob of buttermilk ice cream. At first, after bites of everything else, it seemed quite good...but then I realized that was just the coolness of the ice cream, and it's pallet cleansing capability. In and of itself it was bland, but when considering how quickly it purged my tongue of the other atrocities on the plate it was very welcome. Financier with merengue. I don't know if it was the fact that the waiter took two almost full dessert plates back to the kitchen or if this is part of the meal (I'm guessing it is), but we received a small financier with our coffee(which was good). It was very fresh, and the merengue was one of the best I've had. 9/10Overall I'll give this a 3/5. I want to score it lower, but outside of the horrible dessert and overuse of tuna nothing was truly awful, and compared to NYC the prices are relatively low. I'll also chalk it up to bad luck, as I've had bad experiences at most restaurants I've been to once or twice (had a terrible one at Europea a couple years back)."

I'd had it before, but never executed quite this well. I was a little skeptical of all the great reviews, but this place lived up to its acclaim. This was one of the few Montreal restaurants on Open Table, so reservations were a snap. This is also one of the more elegant restaurants I've dined at in Montreal, so I'd recommend dressing up a bit. We got the 7 course tasting menu, along with the vintage wine pairing (there were two wine pairing options, vintage and regular). Amuse: Tangerine juice, served in a shot glass, topped with fir foam. First course: Scallop served in the shell, with apple foam & cranberry water. Wine pairing: 1998 macon late harvest chardonnaySecond course: Monkfish liver with sake gelée and organic soy sauce. Wine pairing: 1993 soaveThird course: Seared foie gras with chili jelly, groundcherry, daikon, apple water, sugar/salt on flower petal. Wine pairing: 1996 sauternes.Fourth course: Chicken topped with a sheet of homemade pasta with green onion oil. Wine pairing: 1996 Morgon beaujolais.Fifth course: Venison with elderberries, red pepper chips, garlic, root vegetables, brussels sprouts, Wine pairing: 1970 Rioja Faustino (bottled in 1974).Sixth course: Cheese plate with melted local cheese, homemade potato chips, pine nuts, red bell peppers, quince. (Wine pairing: didn't come with the tasting menu but we got a N.V. aged Tokai)Seventh course: Baked cored apple with apple sherbet, coconut/sour cream powder, cranberry reduction. Needless to say, it was a pretty impressive dinner. The colors and presentation of each dish were a work of art to behold, as well as to taste. The service was impeccable throughout the evening; the kind of service where your every need is anticipated. At one point a busser poured tap water into our sparkling water glasses, and even though it wasn't that big a deal our server immediately noticed and whisked those glasses away, bringing out a new bottle of sparkling water. Of all the meals we had on our last trip, this is one of the ones that was the most haunting; days later I'd still be thinking about some aspect of this meal. Montreal has so many excellent restaurants, so this is yet another one that is worth trying at least once."
/user_details?userid=635kDyzqanODRxidHah6rw,Joan B.,"Swarthmore, PA",2 star rating,"Ordering the tasting menu here is  a big mistake. To summarize: it is a ripoff that is not well thought out and will leave you feeling like you drank a quart of cream and not much else.In the tasting menu we were served there was no real protein other than two slabs of duck breast, stretched with very gamy duck heart. We were served course after course with bits of inexpensive ingredients usually blended into foam and whipped cream (for a hundred dollars plus).When I ordered the foie gras tasting menu--at an upcharge--the waiter did not mention that the following course would be marrow; to eat foie gras followed by bone marrow borders on disgusting. One reason we chose the tasting menu was for the cheese course, but instead of bringing out the platter of Canadian cheeses (as for those who ordered a la carte) we got one slice of cheese filled with Parmesan-flaked whipped cream.  Instead of getting to taste their pastries for dessert, we got more cream--melting lavender ice cream, after the whipped-cream cheese, which had followed two other whipped-cream courses (with bits of cod, bits of corn). Despite tasting delicious, the courses seemed repetitive and it felt like they were stinting on any ingredient that cost money.The restaurant is physically lovely, and there is talent in the kitchen,  but the tasting menu--like their hefty wine markups-- is a ""gouge-the-customer"" affair that should be avoided. I suggest ordering from the short but interesting regular menu if you want to enjoy this restaurant and feel that you got good value."

We also did the wine paring which we liked a lot. I thought each dish was creative in presentation and was tasty. An upscale restaurant.

Quite a tour around the animal kingdom: sea urchin, snails, chilean sea bass, beef, pigeon. Presentation is lovely. Delicate sauces made for elegant but light dishes. Fresh, fresh, fresh. And the serious is truly joyous and intelligent without a hint of pretension. Easter eve was a good time to be in Montreal: a rare, quiet Saturday night. But we will definitely return to Toque even on a busy night!"

Did not plan to write a review because, as it was my first time trying a tasting menu, I thought it satisfied all the expectations I had: innovative & delicious dishes with top notch service. But alas, I recently had my 2nd tasting menu at another establishment and it disappointed to the point I felt compelled to join the yelp community and put in my two cents.I don't remember the dishes I had here with detail but they were incredibly delicious! I just remembered the first dish: corned mousse because I never heard or tried anything quite like it... and ditto for all subsequent dishes except for the classic staples like foie gras terrine and lamb. The dishes were also well paced, so expect a good 3 hrs here. I would definitely go back if I happen to be in Montreal again."

We had a nut/seed allergy that we made them aware of and the first course and the bread both had seeds on them, but once we alerted them to the mistake they took the food back and gave us new food and gave us a different onion bread(which was refilled as fast as we ate it) and never made another mistake. The sommelier was knowledgeable and suggested a great wine, but never came by again to check on it. The food was expertly prepared, creative, and very filling - by the 5th course neither of us could finish the entire plate. The entire experience took just over 4 hours, so don't come here on a tight schedule. A special occasion, but worth it, at $300+tip with a bottle of wine"

It was more like a mousse than a foam.  The meal only got better from there with the razor clams, duck, and apple tartlet.  The bartender, Gilbert, was so personable and hospitable.  We felt so well taken care of  even just sitting at the bar!  We would have returned there on Sunday for a parting meal, but unfortunately Toque is closed on Sunday.  Thank you Toque for a very nice evening!"

/user_details?userid=e76t1DuWMe6bNtMwgbqgBg,Ji Y.,"San Mateo, CA",5 star rating,"I have been to quite a few French restaurants in Montreal. This is definitely by far the best. Food here comes with big price tags. This is not your weekly eat-out place, where you fill your belly with gigantic portions of comfort food. This is the place where you eat food that can only be seen on Iron Chef. This is the place where you satisfy your eyes and taste buds with culinary artworks. My wife and I went there two days ago. We tried the 7-course tasting menu, which changes regularly. I chose the one without Foei Gras(I hate Foei Gras). My wife chose the one with Foei Gras. Every dish was very creative, wThe first two were cold sea food courses. The first was Sea scallop salad with Wasabi foam. The second was Sea snail with quail eggs and cabbage salad. They were both amazingly refreshing and tasty. I especially loved the sea snail. The light vinaigrette and mixture of finely minced pickled vegetables, complimented the sea snail meat extremely well. The third course was Foie Gras for her and Monk fish for me. I liked my monk fish in its wonderful sauce. The next two courses were both meat courses. The forth was Rib eye steak and the fifth was pork meat combination. Both were cooked to perfection. It was amazing how they made the fatty meat taste not fatty at all. The sixth course was a cheese dish cooked with cauliflower and hazelnuts. The seventh was dessert. Both were good, but not as impressive as the previous ones. Every dish was creative, well executed, beautifully presented and most importantly delicious. The flavors were sophisticated and delicate, not too strong or overwhelmingly rich. The service was adequate. The whole experience was absolutely worth the money."

I don't know if I'll ever be to another restaurant better than this.The decor and ambiance was modern, nothing to talk much of. Clean and simple. Service was very professional.The food was brilliant. We had the Tasting Menu and left $500 lighter for two, but it was worth it. The dinner was not just a meal, but a while experience. Very creative food with complex flavors and textures, but still very accessible for most people. Wow, I hope to go to Montreal again someday so that I can go to Toque again."

Having eaten at other comparable restaurants in the U.S. (Eleven Madison Park in NYC, Gary Danko in SF), I would say that Toque far surpasses them in terms of service and flavor. The dishes at Toque were focused on their respective star ingredients. Every course felt like something that came out of Iron Chef.  We also had the wine pairing, and each wine truly elevated the course that it was served with. The service is familiar, warm, yet polished. We had a four hour meal that was the highlight of our trip to Montreal. Not to be missed, and a steal for the money!!"

/user_details?userid=vtP1Sne6TwBhhHSLZojPcA,Jeff C.,"Laurel, MD",5 star rating,"The restaurant looks as comfortable and elegant as ever.  The new bar is pretty, but I think it's mostly good for decor.  The service this time lacks a bit of attention, perhaps because they are very busy.  I sat at the sofa against the wall, and had enjoyed my usual view of the wine cellar and most of the restaurant.  With an old familiar feeling of comfort, dinning alone here is quite pleasant.  For starters, the bread was as usual, not warm.  But it had taste...from the wheat or butter I don't know.  But it had TASTE.  The tasting menu started with tomato puree with some herbs - okay starter.  The lobster with foam of corn is absolutely stunning.  I can still taste the corn and lobster right now. The Fois Gras is thick, juicy and as usual, head and shoulders above any others I have tried.  The sea snail salad provided a sharp contrast between the snail and veggie.  Ribeye carpacio is okay as I am not into carpacio, but I give them an A for effort as there is at least 10 ingredients that went into the rest of the dish.  The meat was pigeon (squab?), which had a very tender breast.  The most memborable thing was the curled up claw on my plate.  I skipped the cheese for a salad, which was absolutely divine.  It had a citreous taste that was remarkable.  Again, there is taste is in every little dish.  The dessert is the usual pretty Toque style.  Finished with Oolong, which is very taiwanese in quality, quite rare to find such good tea in N. America.  This place has been an exceptional restaurant since they were on St. Dennis.  After 8 years, and many fine restauranI ts later, it remained the top restuarant on my list in which I judge all others against, as I collect Michellin stars.  I only wish I can one day gather my whole family to Montreal to share the spetacular food in this wonderful place together."
/user_details?userid=C5TTitmmKbwjrGB4rT5R8Q,Kim G.,"Santa Ana, CA",4 star rating,"I wish Yelp allowed for half stars because Toque! is 4.5 in my mind - not perfect, but darn close.  I did the tasting menu with foie gras the other night and I'm so glad I did.  The entire meal was awesome - I can't think of a single dish that wasn't exceptional.  One member of my party thought the amuse buche was salty, but that was the only negative the entire night!  I loved the sea urchin soup, probably the best sea urchin I've had and I thought the bone marrow dish was fun and inventive.  Overall the food was top notch.  At this point you're probably wondering why not five stars!  Well the service was somewhat sporadic, but not bad either.  At the beginning of meal it's like they forgot to put our order in because the amuse came out quickly and then nothing while we watched some tables around us power down two courses.  They apologized for the delay and then things started going.  Some servers were also friendlier than others and I thought it was strange how we seemed to have a different server for each course.  Overall the experience was great and I'd eat here again - truly great fine dining experience."
/user_details?userid=zgqi7Ryo7L5VTKonEVkRwQ,L C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",4 star rating,"Being a native, I credit Montreal (and my family of course) with instilling in me, a profound love of good food and good drink. Back in town, I wanted to try all the good food that I'd been missing like yummy Greek and Lafleur's hot dogs. Also on my list was haute cuisine and this place's name came up. I took my sister and, well, it was very very good. While we both had the tasting menu, mine was the foie gras version and my sister's was the regular version. It was a whirlwind of escalating expectations as it started off with a fantastic amuse bouche (a mousse topped with a foam...I can't remember the ingredients...I should have taken notes!). Then the courses just kept getting better until the 4th course (or was it 5th?) which was a salmon foie gras. At that point, I was wishing I had gotten the regular tasting menu because my sister had a tuna sashimi type dish which was definitely better. While it may just be that by that point, I had foie gras fatigue but the salmon dish was not pleasing...it wasn't bland but it wasn't spectacular. The next dish was a braised bone marrow...super yum! By this point though, I was stuffed! I didn't think I could go on but the deliciousness of the food (and it's price...$104 for the foie gras tasting menu, $92 for the regular tasting menu) made me go on. Unfortunately, the dessert was absolutely dreadful. It was juvenile and pedestrian, to say the least. The dessert was a thin wafer over ice cream topped with little dots of jam (mine was strawberry, my sister's was blueberry). It was kinda shocking to see and taste the dessert because it was almost like a joke...like ""you'll come here to eat anything I serve"". The dessert should have capped the night but it felt like more of an insult. One particular note of appreciation I would give is to the sommelier who developed the wine pairings with such precision that the food was absolutely enhanced by it. I know that that's the point of a wine pairing but I've never had one that was just this perfect before...it turned a solo into a symphony. The wine pairing is completely worth the price (I had the $60 ""regular"" pairing...there is a $90 ""premium"" pairing as well).Overall, there were a few bad notes which made the price seem overly high. The price should have been under $100 for the foie gras and $85 for the regular tasting menu. However, this was haute cuisine that was, for the most part, done very well. This place takes cards. There is street parking so save your money and forgo the valet. Perhaps I've been spoiled by LA but valet is crazy-expensive in Montreal. There is a complimentary coat check."

We both had the 7 course tasting menu and it was the best meal I've ever had. Period. If you go, just get the 7 course tasting menu. I guarantee every course will be delicious and an explosion of textures, flavors, and experiences for your mouth. What made the experience even better was Fabian, one of the head waiters allowed us to visit the beautiful kitchen and showcased each station - pastry, frying, vegetables, meat - and even the lockers were an entire suckling pig was hanging from the ceiling. Afterwards, he led us down to the 7,000 bottle wine cellar. The wine menu changes each week as they add / rotate wines in and out of the cellar when they are ready. Truly an amazing experience and I look forward to returning."
