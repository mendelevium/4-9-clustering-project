My brother had no favourites actually because it was his first time having Argentinian food but he would want to try more My parents they loved the empanadas & gave them flash backs from their pre covid trips to Panama and Argentina .I generally enjoyed everything but the tamales  I love tamales & I haven't had really good homemade ones in forever so it was satisfying.The Alfajores and Churros were an amazing way to finish off the amazing supper .I already recommended this place last night to my best friends who are Colombian .I am definitely returning without a doubt , but in sweatpants this time .Covid friendly , max 3 people at a time , friendly staff 110\100 would recommend Ps; watch out for my weekend food story post on IG"
/user_details?userid=sEv7OmC9rm1JLEOGciWFxQ,Carin R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Excellent meal! I went in for the churros during Yelp Elite Week. When I saw they had the Barros Lucos on the menu, I had to order it and one of their spicy beef empanadas as well. The service was attentive, the guac for my sandwich was made fresh and the churros were crispy on the outside and nice and flavored with the hanzelnut choco filling and the pastry cream filling. I shared them but I could have eaten all four and maybe some more! Definitely a great local takeout spot to enjoy!"
/user_details?userid=h0uDDltgg-nRNCj5ni_VuQ,Andrea K.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Stopped by for churros to take to friends and ended up getting empanadas for myself because I couldn't resist the smell. I love that they have tons of different empanadas, with options for all dietary needs. They have meat, veggie, vegan, and gluten free options. As someone who can't have dairy, I rarely get a chance to eat empanadas since there's dairy in the dough. So naturally, I indulged and got three of their vegan empanadas: grilled veggies, pumpkin and mushroom, and artichoke.  It's a great takeout option, in my opinion. You can ask to have them warmed up and easily eat them on the go. Mine were nice and warm and the vegan cheese was fully melted. They have lots of flavour and they come with a side of sauce for dipping too. I also got one of each filling for the churros: custard, lemon, dulce de leche, and nutella. The staff was super friendly and kindly answered all my questions about the menu as there were some ingredients I wasn't familiar with. Will definitely be going back again!"

I've had the great pleasure of trying their churros (all three of their sweet ones and their cheese filled ones), their empanadas (chicken one and spicy beef one), and one of their salads (kind of like a Greek salad). All were really DELICIOUS!!! The salad was a really generous portion (I had a small salad and it was all my partner and I could eat after splitting the churros and empanadas. Honestly, this place offers a great deal. I'm hooked! ;-)Can't wait to try their sandwiches next time. Everything looked awesome!!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious empanadas with a lot of fillings inside. My fave is the beef one and the chorizo. They come with a tangy sour sauce on the side. The dough is soft and warm. As for the churros, I tried the lemon, cream, dulce de leche and chocolate. They were all delicious and the sugar made them crunchy. You can order your items online and pay before going."
/user_details?userid=VUS9-ABMF37mbHG5aMaaZw,Gabriella F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Amazing little spot. We tried a variety of thing: churros, 4 diff types of empanadas and both tamales. Everything was really tasty. The chimichurri that came with the empanadas was amazing! I should have bought a whole jar of it. The empanadas with prunes inside were especially good."
/user_details?userid=OzyhXKFKFpLAtax2BltTUg,Sara B.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Great place for a bite. Staff is friendly and empanadas are delicious! I tried the onion and cheese and I would definitely recommend.
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Never had the Empanadas, will most likely in the future. So this basis is solely for the Churros. Frankly, they're amazing. I've had it dozens of times and I've never stepped in the doors of this business but I've indirectly purchased from them hundreds of dollars as one of our closest friends lives down the block and she always grabs 2 boxes on her way here.The standard kind is my favorite but I do enjoy their chocolate & dolce di lecce versions as well. They're all glorious and delightful. One of my favorite things in the wrong is polishing off a box next morning after they're stored in the fridge overnight. They thought they survived the carnage of the day before but they're my morning feast.I love this business."
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"After hearing great reviews from South American friends I finally made it here! Their specialties are churros and empanadas. They offer a variety of selections. I had the classic Churros sprinkled with sugar which was absolutely heavenly and worth the calories. Their beef empanadas were great and if you're really hungry, I would recommend ordering two as they are on the smaller side. The service was great, Marilou was extremely friendly and pleasant. This place is ideal for take out."
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Their dulce du leche filled Churros are probably the best I've ever had. They weren't impossible to chew through and were not a huge mess to eat. I've also never had stuffed Churro so to speak, so that was bueno.On the Empanadas side, I tried two flavors: #6 Pollo Neopolitana and #7 Carne Picante. Both were good, but the meat filled one stood out for the seasoning - which was very memorable and unique. The chicken on the other hand was on the plainish side, but they both had a better than average shell. Would like to try them again fresh, to make a better review of the whole 'Empanadas', since I was only able to eat them re-warmed. I have a feeling this will yield a result of 5 stars. We'll see."
/user_details?userid=U8tYRpskjRDPvZPMjFqOVA,Moudi M.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,The empanadas were really flavorful and the staff was very excellent with describing the items on the menu. The homemade guava juice was really refreshing
/user_details?userid=NUJsFBSaa6RfHETL-ybBCA,Camille L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Best churros I've had in Montreal (and in most places). Their sandwiches are very filling and fresh, and the service is amazing. I haven't tried their empanadas yet, but if they're half as good as their churros they must be delicious!"
/user_details?userid=ZqBFC02f34dDg8ryNL1PaA,Ariel D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"4/5 For the empanadas. They were great on average (but not amazing), particularly the chicken and chicken napolitano. I did not enjoy the meat empanada as much because I found it a bit bland, particularly compared to the ones in Pachamama which uses diced beef instead of ground beef. I also observed that the empanadas might be re-heated (but I might be wrong). They do have a very large selection here, including more vegetarian and vegan varieties, so still a lot of stuff to try, not to forget the sandwiches.5/5 for the churros!! This place is connected to the Che Churro in NDG and both make fresh, still warm, amazing filled churros! The more traditional is to take the Dulce de Leche filled one but they have other options as well."
/user_details?userid=ThWsIwd54W0VISsudOFVcw,Ashe C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Went after these promising reviews and was not disappointed! This was my first time having empanadas and the owner was so excited for my mom and I to try them! Very friendly staff, cozy spot, cheery music that makes you feel like there isn't a foot of brown snow outside right now.Their vegan empanadas are AHMAZING. One was stuffed with eggplants, peppers, broccoli and spices; the other had mushrooms and an actually good vegan cheese. Great spot for cheap, tasty options whether you're vegan, vegetarian, a meat lover or want their gluten free empanada. Will def go back to try the churros."
