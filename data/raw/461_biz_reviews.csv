Service is great and they do pay attention to us.We had 2 appetizers for three, and we thought that it was enough. The portion sizes are adequate and great for sharing. About 3 minutes later, our beer were served, then another 5 minutes later, we had our Enoki Beef and Takoyaki (Octopus fritters) on our table. Taste-wise? A solid 8.5/10. The sauces blended well together, and it was warm/hot - fresh off the kitchen.For my entree (main course), I had the house special ramen (Chashu Tonkotsu). I watch a lot of YouTubers eating their ramen, and just like them, I tasted the broth first. The broth was great, not oily, not bland, it was good - nothing more but nothing less of 'good'. I enjoyed it but will not order it again because their menu is huge! If I come back, which I will, I am ordering something else.Recommended 4.25/5 star for me.What are you waiting for? Go reserve a table and enjoy a nice cold beer, great food, and great company!"
/user_details?userid=BAF1ZKlIqXAAY_DQGMtoIA,Farrah K.,"Kingston, Canada",3 star rating,"I stopped at Ramen-Ya to try and satisfy a ramen craving. There was a nice patio set up outside, which was exactly what we were looking for due to covid-19. We showed up for dinner, and it wasn't busy - we were seated right away, which was great considering everywhere else seemed quite full.I got the seafood ramen with a miso base, as all of their ramen bases are pork-based (no pork for me!) The ramen was pretty good, but nothing super special. I think this may have been my own fault, as I'm not a huge miso fan, but there weren't too many other vegetarian options for ramen.The service was good - we were checked up on quite a few times, and overall our server was friendly.In a crunch, I would return to Ramen-Ya for ramen, but will likely opt to try other options moving forward."

Terrible is a nice word for it. It was the first time I walked out from the restaurant. We waited for someone to come to take our order and 3 girls working there were busy chatting. After a significant wait my husband went to ask them to come to take our order and again 5 or 10 minutes that felt like an eternity we're still waiting and the girls are still chatting. Another couple comes to the restaurant sits not too far from us, time goes by they are ready to order and guess what? Someone comes to take THEIR order while we are STILL waiting. We put our jackets and I go to talk to those girls and the look on their faces! I interrupted their conversation to mention the horrible service, they certainly did Not care one little bit and neither did the manager. I'm afraid no ramen is worth it and I am on a lookout to try new ramen places in the neighborhood."

And yes, they do have the classics available on the menu but, for the quality, the prices were Outrageous! One salmon sushi roll (6 small pieces) was $10 and I firmly believe you could have received the same quality for more sushi at your local Provigo (for visitors, this isn't saying much) The staff is kind but the prices just don't reflect the generic quality and presentation of the food.  Meh- I won't be back."

This place has a large varieties of Japanese food. Their ramen might not be the best in town but definitely very good. Their tempura  is top notch, better than any of those I had in sushi buffets. Although they don't have a large varieties of sushi but those they do offer is extremely good. They also have yakisoba(sauted or cold) and donburi that are some of the best I've had."

/user_details?userid=KJIS0INMJKhBmGqFkHMc-A,Mai Lynn L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I left this place unimpressed and rather disappointed. My sister and I were walking through the street of St-Laurent looking for a place to eat and we decided to give Ramen-Ya a try as I love Japanese food. We ordered a bunch of stuff. It started well with the kim chi : I don't think Kim Chi can ever taste bad anywhere. We also had the salmon sashimi salad : it was so-so. The portion is really small. It was like a basic salad with 5 pieces of really thin salmon on it covered with a bit of sauce. It wasn't amazing. Next comes the tuna tartare. The tuna tartare was entree size. There was a lot of tempura mixed with the tuna and they laid rice under the tartare. It also comes with sliced cucumbers and small pieces of seaweed. Personally, I liked it better as is : only with the tuna and not the seaweed that takes away all the flavours from the tuna. The presentation of this plate was really cute though. Then we had the "" spicy "" chicken wings. It tasted like diluted tabasco.. which is not really what I'm looking for when I order spicy chicken wings from a Japanese restaurant. Lastly, we ordered the "" Chirachi "" which is a plate of rice filled with salad and salmon sashimi. As I was taking a bite, I felt something really odd. I pulled apart my slice of salmon only to discover that there were a hair burrowed inside of it. I told the waitress and she brought it back to the kitchen. I don't think I'll ever come back again as the food wasn't really impressive and the staffs didn't leave me with a great impression, except for our waitress who was really sweet."

/user_details?userid=voFxNdzhG-cDrW_9NzFGbw,Denzil D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Ok, please disregard the over rating of 3.5 stars. The reason is people don't understand that the ramen here is the best and waist their time on other things (that are still good but it is called Ramen-Ya). It is the best ramen in the city and with the trip up Saint Laurent for it. It is always perfect and the staff and atmosphere matches it perfectly. Enjoy."

I was surprised to find this place in an izakaya, I guess it's own by the same people. They do not have a huge selection for ramen. I ordered the spicy miso broth with chashu and my partner ordered their signature classic ramen. I tried both lol. Both ramen were good but not amazing. I wouldn't go out of my way to get ramen from here. The chashu was really good though, it had enough fat and flavour. The takoyaki was ok , again nothing amazing. All in all, I thought it was pretty expensive for what you get. There was not much noodles in the ramen and I also felt like there was too much bean sprouts. Maybe if I'm around the area and there's no other places to go to..."

Unlike other Ramen places, this place is big and they can accommodate large groups. The meat in the ramen (pork) is really good. The thing that bothered me was the broth. Was not impressed. Also the Karaage was a big disappointment. It had a thick fluffy layer of batter and it wasn't crispy at all. That's not how Karaage is meant to be. So my quest to find a good Ramen place in Montreal still continues. Sorry Montreal, but Toronto still has an upper hand when it comes to Ramen joints.

/user_details?userid=bBpESkJdwW5kVEgm8DErEQ,Bruno C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"First of all, I've never been to Japan, so I know nothing... NOTHING I TELL YOU!For those who don't know about ramen, it's Japan's version of poutine except some people actually think it might be good for you (see my ""Resto La Banquise"" review for the same comment, only in reverse).I really like ramen in general. I still eat uncooked instant ramen all the time even if I've been over 12 years old for more than 20 years now.Ramen-Ya has nothing to do with that though. If you've never had real ramen and aren't planning a trip to Japan any time soon, this is probably the best ramen shop you can find in Montreal.Tasty, fat, chewy and messy, ramen are amazing food that will prevent any hangover and a really good way to make yourself look silly in front of a date, slurping and splashing away in your broth as your noodle slide off your chopsticks.Have fun!"

I don't know if I was just really hungry or if this ramen was ridiculously good. I got a custom ramen with grilled chicken, veggies, egg, and miso. It was absolutely delicious. I had it to go and the soup was still burning hot when I got home. I'm super tired so this review isn't gonna be my best one but long story short: this place has great ramen!"
/user_details?userid=JKCs6GAfQWaOh6CPqRlrjQ,Angie L.,"Fishkill, NY",2 star rating,I ordered their house ramen. Not impressed. The soup tastes like the broth of the beef noodle joint in Chinatown. The ramen texture reminds me of instant noodle . Also the portion is more like appetizer than a meal. Trying this place once is good enough.

/user_details?userid=67nGPqBSQKA_uERJCDZD1w,Antoine T.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"The concept of Ramen is very simple and quite delightful. You get ""there"", order your Ramen, and eat your Ramen. In Japan, the concept is cool because usually you order and pay through a machine (like an ATM) and everything is done rapidly and orderly. Thus, my surprise at the complete lack of service of Ramen-Ya. Ordering a Ramen soup took nearly 20 minutes. The Noodle is the key to a good Ramen soup, Broth being the second ingredient. I would've expected something quite good coming out of Ramen-Ya but unfortunately the noodles were plain and tasteless. Poor texture, no spring to them and difficult to noisily suck ""in"". The Broth was good however, a mix of miso and chicken fond. Enough taste to finish and not too salty to require additional water. The fillings (porc slabs and vegies) were poor in taste and quantity, making the overall Ramen experience a  big mEh. At least the egg wasn't overcooked. Took the better part of an hour to eat a simple Ramen. After which, being still hungry, we asked for the menu, but were unable to re-order ( we got forgotten i suppose...). So we forgot to tip in return. Sad to see this place so busy with the hispter vibe of the plateau, but fail at the simpliest of task. They seemed very busy with their takeout orders tho..."

/user_details?userid=F5P_YyFeucqKu00lmJJHIg,Steve S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Went here because I was craving some ramen after my last trip to Japan. The decor is really nice and reminiscent of a Japanese restaurant. The menus were very extensive and the service was friendly. I ordered a typical miso based ramen and my friends ordered a beef donburi plate and spicy beef ramen. All in all it was satisfactory however the noodles in the ramen were not fresh and springy as I was expecting. The donburi was really good and I actually preferred it to my ramen which is unusual considering I prefer ramen over anything...So a bit of a bummer. All in all it was okay but overpriced.
/user_details?userid=Lgy3LZ6lvlFcoXSpopGd1Q,哈哈哈,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",1 star rating,"Decor and ambiance is pretty cool , so were the beer selections and cocktail menu. However , food quality is really low for the price . I ordered a salmon tartare that was 75% rice so was not excited for the appetizer . The ramen I ordered was decent  but not the best in Montreal. Just disappointed in general because the menu has every picture of the food items and the pictures all look lovely and appetizing but when we got the actual food it looked like all you can eat tapas just assembled ."

The miso ramen with grilled chicken was very flavorful, the soft boiled eggs here are SPOT ON AND DELICIOUS, the noodles are good and as good as any other ramen spot.  The house special tonkatsu was good.  I like that the broth was not overly salty like at many ramen spots (and I like salt).  And the pork cheeks were a nice appetizer I'd recommend this place"

/user_details?userid=m422wCpaVywsPJJ-udrM2A,Eric H.,"Regina, Canada",4 star rating,"Despite living in a city that does not have a ramen restaurant, it is still my favorite food.  That makes a ramen joint a must-see in any city I travel to.I chose Ramen-Ya simply because of it's proximity to where I was staying.  Upon entering the restaurant, I was quickly greeted by a friendly hostess and seated. The spacious restaurant was dimly lit, but not in a way that detracted from the setting.Our waiter saw to us swiftly and recommended the ramen special combo, which got you a regular ramen, four gyoza, and a pint of Sapporo for $20.  I went with this option, ordering the Spicy Beef Ramen and Pork Gyoza.The gyoza arrived first and was nothing special - not great, not bad, but sufficient.  The ramen on the other hand, was tremendous.  The broth, my favorite part of any ramen, was extremely flavorful.  The meat was tender and the soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly.  The only part of the ramen that was night delicious, were the noodles themselves, which were a little too soft for my liking.  Other than that, the soup was great - and with a pint of Sapporo to wash it down with - a worthwhile meal."

Firstly, we 'll talk about the positive. Ramen-ya has a great ambiance and vibe to it.  It's quite spacious and you can see an open kitchen.  The appetizers were very delicious as well, quite a variety! My friends ordered sashimi, okonomiyaki, while I ordered the spicy salmon tartare. It was definitely appetizing and really tasty.Now the negative. The service? So slow!! Luckily my group wasn't in a rush, but  we were there for almost 1 hour 1/2 before we received our appetizers. The main came not too long after, but there was barely any ramen in it! I had the katsu (pork cutlet) ramen and it was delicious, but i felt like the portion size was a bit too small for my liking.I'd prefer Misoya, more expensive but the broth is more tasteful I find. Service is also quicker. So don't come here if you are hungry because expect a long wait. At least that's what happened to us that Friday evening."

Service is fast and efficient, and people are nice -- on cold days when I am waiting for my order, the staff bring over green tea while I wait, which is just so pleasant. I usually get the house broth, which I think is super tasty and flavorful, or the spicy beef ramen, which could be spicier in my opinion but which still hits the spot.  Thank you, Ramen-Ya for tending to my cold-weather ramen-y needs."

I'm not an expert but a friend who had lived in Japan for years pointed me here and I was not at all disappointed. Not the exceptional shiney purity of tastes and ingredients as at Kazu, but a huge cut above a lot of the grizzly bar food on the Main. I've only tried the spicy chicken and a vegetable ramen so far, both healing big bowls, deliciously flavorful, not at all greasy, super comfort food. The price is under $20, so typical for Montreal, but a meal like this would be cheaper in less expensive cities, and on less expensive streets (the rents on the Main have gone bananas.)

But lately on my walks up the street I've noticed Ramen-Ya has expanded into the space next door, transforming from cosy hole in the wall to full blown restaurant. I dropped in for a late lunch and got to check out the new space and was quite impressed. The service was very quick, but I wonder how the kitchen can handle a huge room full of people? I guess I'll have to come back to check it out. On this visit I had a spicy beef ramen and it was absolutely delicious. I feel like they've stepped up their game since my last visit some time ago.  Not sure exactly what was different, but it tasted even better than it usually does."

The difference is if you will be paying for it later, which the lady told me I wouldn't (but I did, I SOOOO DID!!!). Anyways, it was delicious, and the two spices they give you really add to the flavor of it. Their green tea was also very delicious. The place is a bit small, but cozy.

There is nothing that soothes the soul better than slurping on a hot bowl of ramen noodles. Second, the website looks terrific and finally it had good ratings on yelp.First the positive points. This place is quite nice and cozy and the menu has a good selection of inexpensive items. We had a bowl of spicy miso ramen which had a nicely cooked egg. However, as I was sitting by the bar, I knew the food was going to be subpar when I saw the cook put a frozen piece of katsu in the deep fryer. That katsu tasted like cardboard... Actually it was the same thickeness as a piece of cardboard now that I think about it! Throughout the night, I saw the cook handle various piece of frozen food like tempura. So I wouldn't be surprised if the noodles were packaged and the broth full of MSG. Only the okonomiyaki was ok although they were very cheap on the bonito flakes, mayo and teriyaki sauce. I thought the noodles and the broth were forgettable. After a long walk to get to this place, we left the restaurant still a bit hungry and sorely disappointed... Never again!"

The service is always fast and efficient and the food is always delicious. I usually have gyoza and ramen, and I've never been disappointed (the spicy beef is my favorite). Anyone I've brought with me here has been happy to learn about it's existence. I'd say it is at least on par, if not better than some of the better ramen's I've eaten."

/user_details?userid=JKQmuH6PKCDXpeZYK3BmnQ,Mister O.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Spotted this place during a rare walk along St-Laurent.  It had just gotten dark, it was already cold, I'd been walking for three hours straight getting the Christmas and spice shopping done...and I was hungry.  ""Hmm.   Ramen?""  Hit one more store I needed to do, then doubled back a few blocks.  I was thinking of the warm light I'd seen through the window, and ramen...and maybe they had gyoza?  Got to the door and read the carte in the window.  They did.Montrealers don't eat supper at five on a Saturday.  Well, since I'd had breakfast at Hurley's at 12:30, this 'd be lunch.  Lunch crowd didn't get the memo, though, because I was the only patron in the place.To my surprise, it was laid out exactly like a ramen joint on 56th Street in Manhattan that I've reviewed;  a few little tables up front in the windows, and a biggish L-shaped counter, with the cooks behind it, dominating the room.  Feeling good about familiar turf, I took a stool at the counter.  Looked around.  Drank it in.Warm halogen light, cool Miles Davis jazz, a sushi-cutter calmly trimming some blocks of fish-ish protein...and everything was very, very clean.  The counter under my elbows was *spotless*.  And then I met my waiter.""To go, or to eat here?""  In French.""Pour manger ici.""  Got handed a menu.I'd never eaten ramen in Montreal before;  only in New York City and Vancouver.  Most of the words on the menu were the same, but they featured a couple of extra adjectives.  I asked about that.""What's shoyu?"" I asked, figuring I'd be sneered at.  Instead, I got a very considerate explanation of what kind of broth it was, and how it compared to their other ones.  I started liking this guy.""Okay, then:  A plate of pork gyoza, a bowl of chasu-men in shoyu broth, and a Sapporo, please.""  Chasu-men was described as a roasted pork and vegetable ramen.  Yeah, I could eat that.  But I'm an absolute round-heeled slut for a plate of gyoza.Beer arrived immediately.  The gyoza followed soon enough.  Six bulging little half-circles on a long rectangular tray with a small vat of dipping sauce at the far end.  They smelled wonderful.  The waiter caught me smelling.""You like spicy?""""Yeah, a little.""""This, very good on gyoza. ""  And he sat a bottle of what looked like pepper oil in front of me.Now, I've only ever been offered chili paste for gyoza, but what the hell.  I picked up the bottle, stared at it, and made to drizzle a bit on the dumplings, when the waiter very gently corrected me.  ""Pour it in there,"" he murmured, pointing at the vat of dipping sauce.  So I did.  Just a blot.And I dipped.ZOMFG.  Best.  Gyoza.  EVAR.  They were hot, they were brightly-flavored, they were plump like oysters, and the pimped-out dipping sauce was bursting with soy-y, sesame richness. I devoured them quickly so I wouldn't have time to be tempted to mate with one.  Wiping away tears of joy, I anticipated my soup.And all of a sudden, there it was.  Reasonably-sized bowl, not overfull of noodles, lotsa sprouts and other green bits, and three big square slices of pork floating atop the whole.  Garnished with crunchy green scallion rings.  I put my nose in, and it smelled fragrant.  Glory.As I grabbed my chopsticks, there were two quiet thunks on the counter at my head.""Spices, and (mumble) garlic,"" offered the waiter.  I thanked him and eyed the bottles.  The spices I recognised as a Japanese red chili powder concoction I like, but I'd never seen a jar of dessicated garlic fragments like these before.  (Had he said 'roasted""?)  I tasted the soup as served and found it excellent but on the subtle side, so in went a fingernail's worth from both jars.I have to say, that waiter knows how to season what he sells.  GodDAMN.  The spices took the broth to somewhere special. And the pork slices, well, they'd obviously been marinated or something, because they had depths of flavor totally unrelated to the broth.  I methodically destroyed that bowl of soup.  I even ate the seaweed.It was, simply, an utterly delicious luncheon.  And my water glass was kept topped-off, the light and music were great, the restroom was clean and had plenty of hand towels, and my waiter was a kind, professional presence through it all.I've had less fun and been treated worse while eating 85-dollar settings in really classy, professional places that I adore.  With a beer and taxes and a good tip, I got out of this noodle house for $26.50.  And not overstuffed.  Just perfect.Places like this one make Montreal winters imaginable."

I got the spicy beef ramen (when in canada, get.the.beef.) It had a ton of meat in it. The broth was a nice flavor but it was more sweet than spicy. It kind of had a teriyaki vibe to it. In comparison to places in the states it was cheap. It was a big bowl that I barely finished. The toppings were ok, nothing stellar. The egg was great. It was the cooked white but still jelly-like yellow. I appreciate a non overcooked egg. I bet this is the place to go in the winter for a big hot bowl of ramen."

You know the deal,  large group, high spirits, cause, hey, it's a Friday.There doesn't seem to be a table large enough to accommodate the size of our group, and we're just trying to figure out how to split ourselves up, when the waiter pounces on some guy who's eating and MOVES him. Ok, that works our for us, but I've never seen a patron pushed off his table mid-meal before in my life. This should have been my first clue.So we sit, and 10 minutes or so later, the waiter takes our order. Ask him a few questions, almost all of which are answered in a mumble that sounds like ""yes, it's noodles"". Same answer to all questions. Well, we're all tech geeks, so a quick search on our phones manages to DE-mystify most of the menu. Second clue as to the service.40 minutes later, and 1 salad and 2 soups have appeared so far. There's a bit of hunger going on by now. One of my colleagues is eying the remnants of one of the salads, so we push it over to him. 50 minutes in, and HALF of the table is served. Umm, ok.  The remaining 4 of us are patient, and figure we're next.  My colleague is now fiddling with the paper wrapper from the chopsticks and I'm afraid he's going to eat it.60 minutes in, still no food for the remaining 4, and in the meantime we've watched 3 other tables get served.70 minutes in, I go remind the server that half of our table is missing food. ""Yeah? It's busy.""75 minutes in, and finally the remaining 4 dishes appear. And my salmon teriyaki is RAW.  STONE COLD RAW.'nuff said. Never again."
/user_details?userid=ARRObgCZXBYGuaSMXWjk3A,Peter T.,"Washington, DC",3 star rating,"This is a pretty good ramen-ya. I don't think that it's run by Japanese, but nevertheless they seem to produce a fairly authentic bowl of noodles. Noodles are fine, if unexceptional. The roast pork was tender but had little substance. The soup was a bit of a let down, however - lackluster and uninspired. Overall it's satisfactory, but I wouldn't be rushing back.The takoyaki, on the other hand, was very good."
/user_details?userid=kgvTkSGVXS78xypSG8o-Bw,Pascal T.,"North Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"If there's a go-to place for me and my fiancee, it's Ramen Ya. She works right next to the place and always goes to have lunch there. I think in total we've been there a good 35 or so times.. alone or with friends or family. The amazing thing about it is: Ramen Ya has never been short of very good. Not once did we walk out not feeling like we just had a very good meal. My fiancee has become a bit of an expert of the menu, and she says everything on the menu is good. As a vegetarian I have tried all of my options and I agree with her. Usually I either have a soup + spring rolls (the best in Montreal btw) or a combination of appetizers.The gyozas, spring rolls and sesame pancakes are all excellent.. The spring rolls are the best I've ever tasted anywhere - and I order them everywhere that has them. The soup is great and so is the veggie teriyaki dish.  Prices are reasonable as well... there's nothing negative to say about the place and that's why it's one of our go-to places!"
/user_details?userid=R3YIrZm8SYisgd35XSsAPQ,Saul K.,"Little Rock, AR",3 star rating,"I was visiting Montreal from Little Rock and felt like I had to take advantage of the big city to catch some japanese ramen and okonomiyaki. Sure enough, I found this place and decided to give it a try. The service wasn't great, the guy who waited my table, who appeared to be the manager if not the owner, didn't really look too enthused to have us there. Having said that, the food was good. The broth was a bit greasy yet it still did the trick. Their okonomiyaki is a bit unorthodox in that they use panko to make the texture more crispy. After eating poutine for the first 3 days in Montreal, it was a good switch."

Long L shaped sushi counter and a few tall tables for small groups.Excellent for a rainy day, a big window to watch every other poor soul charge through bad weather while you lean over a bowl of ramen.My favorite is the veggie ramen with spicy miso broth. Now, it's not spicy but it flavorful.Sashimi is presented simply and is consistently fresh with a good portion for a reasonable price. I tried their sesame pancake and it was heavy but tasty (cooked in oil). Service is really friendly but always only one server so wait times can be a little long. Deal with it, it's worth it."

Also it was never set even after 10 minutes we had been there. A server came only after we asked around the 15 minute mark.The entire staff was idling (one was in the corner staring into her phone) to add to the ghost-town-esque atmosphere caused by the obvious lack of customers in the shop.The server was rather rude, seemed to be annoyed and had no intention of serving us with the least amount of courtesy.The food was mediocre and was nothing spectacular for the money.To top it all off, they had the audacity to ask for a tip. When we refused, they refused to give us change. The tip should be earned, not mandatory, but these rude servers just could not understand!I couldn't emphasize better how horrid our experience was. Please avoid this restaurant."

/user_details?userid=L6emKzUz5SvJni6pGAoSow,Adrian W.,"Montclair, NJ",5 star rating,"Great Food, Friendly Locals, Amazing Host!Ramen-Ya has been my favorite restaurant experience in months.  I was in town for my brothers bachelor party, and after a rowdy Friday night the five of us needed to recuperate before diving again into the fray.  Being a rainy day, thoughts of warm food and soup created a longing for Ramen, that once shared with the team was exactly what we were all looking for.  A quick search of Yelp, and we were on our way to Ramen-Ya!  We arrived around 7:30 on a Saturday, and ironically the only seats available were at a table for five.  I know we were lucky as all of the other seats stayed full all night long.We ordered drinks and appetizers, and they arrived quickly.  Sitting near the bar, the regulars at the counter were fun and easy to talk to.  But everything got even better when our Host came to talk about the menu.  I love Ramen and have eaten all of it's iterations from the ""Top"" to the bottom, including specialty shops in five different Japanese prefectures.  I Like Ramen.  But I have never experienced the joy of a Ramen house that you see in the movies...ever seen ""Ramen Girl"",  or for that matter even Po's father in Kung Fu Panda?  There's supposed to be something special about making Ramen, that I've never experienced it before.  Until Ramen-Ya.  As I was saying our Hostess arrived at the table and talked to us, at length about the different broths she had been working on that day, what was in them, what she thought would be best paired with them, and about what we each liked.  Red Meat, chicken, spicy, sweet, she covered all of the bases, and helped us each make our own perfect choice.  And we all did.We shared across the bowls, and drank beer, and laughed with the other guests, and with the sushi chefs and the hostess.  We stayed for about an hour and a half, and were never rushed or pressured, and had exactly the type of experience you want to have when you have your best friends together for a good time.Montreal, you are lucky to have Ramen-Ya, long may you support her!"
/user_details?userid=Edhsd2A56QLABhmrIWEprQ,Richard K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Ramen-Ya is perhaps best described as a very friendly Ramen shop that needs a bit more work on the food-end to get the product to live up to the price tag.This isn't Vancouver, folks. Montreal Japanese cuisine is expensive, and here is no different than any other authentic place I can think of. But to their credit, the family operating the place is very fluent (en francais or English) and eager to help you figure out what any given on the menu may be. They have a fairly comprehensive assortment of dishes (yakisoba, udon, gyoza, sushi) but most will go for the named Ramen. It's not surprising; one step in and the atmosphere alone will have you convinced the place means business.The ramen is what I'd call...unusual? My pork Shoyu bowl had a noticeable taste of seafood for some reason - not a great idea - but the pork cutlet was neatly fried and sliced to the side, which really helped with the flavor. (There is a reasonably priced trio set (~$20) with gyoza and beer which I'd recommend to anyone looking for a traditional Ramen set experience.) Other dishes we experienced had similar ups and downs. The gyoza was excellent, but small for the money.It's not in-and-out neighborhood ramen, and I don't think I would choose it over Kazu anytime soon, but it's a fine choice for Japanese eating in the area. I'd definitely consider it again if I couldn't decide what to eat."

/user_details?userid=aX7RPvDVD21AQ5FjAGxTNw,Elaine L.,"North Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Honestly, I had my reservations when I saw this little Japanese restaurant on Boul St. Laurent. I thought it was going to be another one of those multi-hyphenated cookie-cutter sushi place around Montreal. But my reservations were thwarted, slightly, by the fact that it's name has the word ""ramen' on it. I HAD to give it a try especially when that picture of a bowl of ramen looked so inviting, and I was a glad I did. I love ramen and I love it even more when it is done right. My favorite ramen on Ramen-ya's menu is their chasumen shoyu ramen and all the dumpling types they have on their menu. There are four soup flavors, shoyu, miso, spicy miso and curry. While some purist might even shun at the idea of having multiple kinds of ramen instead of specializing in one, I kind of like it that there are options. Never mind that the owners are Chinese but let us not get into the history of noodles. This is as good as it gets with bowl of piping hot, soothing, tasty ramen with a nice slice of roasted pork, complementary veggies and seriously delicious looking floating globules of glistening fat that's just the right amount.Also, try their zaru soba dishes. Their tempura shrimp zaru soba is simply out of this world. It's the perfect cold noodle dish for a summer's day. I was never a fan of cold noodles until now, that is. I am really glad I found a joint I could hangout and have a delicious meal for lunch during work hours. And I have now earned a title as their frequent client by now, I suppose, I have been back more than 10 times in 3 weeks.Ramen-ya is a gem in the city of Montreal."
