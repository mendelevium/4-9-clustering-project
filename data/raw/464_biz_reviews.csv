I had the oxtail plate and my son had the jerk chicken. Both were served with rice & beans, plantain and veg. I highly recommend that you stop in to see Claudella if you're in town. She is as charming as her food is delicious!We will definitely be back again."

I had the vegetarian roti and my friend had the jerk chicken. Honestly, it was the best vegetarian roti I've had in a while. Please make sure to visit when you're in the area! I'll sure be back when I come back to Montreal."
