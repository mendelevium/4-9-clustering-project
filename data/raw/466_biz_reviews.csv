/user_details?userid=BhnZmgeKD1ipVanFe1PDcA,Rebecca P.,"Longueuil, Canada",5 star rating,"We found this small place by accident a few years back.  We were wary because it was pretty empty but it was ´bring your own wine' we figured we'd try it given that that size of our group had grown and we hadn't made reservations.  Not only were the able to accommodate our group, the food was delicious and inexpensive.  You start off with fresh pita-like bread and a choice of 4 dipping sauces; then a soup followed by a salad with delicious homemade dressing; finally the main dish.  It is a fixed-price menu and you choose the type of meat or fish from the left column and the sauce from the right column so the combination possibilities give (almost) everyone something they'll like.  I had creole beef last night and it is my new favourite so I'll be torn between having it again and trying another.  Haven't been disappointed yet! Aux Îles Bleues is classified as Cuban, but it combines flavours from the Seychelles, Madagascar and the Ile Maurice."

BYOB type of restaurant in a quiet area of the city just few block away from Saint-Catherine. Recommend it for small gatherings, a date night, even for a small family reunion."

/user_details?userid=qgVY8-S_GTC5G1OLoO5vwQ,Diliny C.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",4 star rating,"Translating from their webpage - Typical cuisine of Mauritius, Reunion , Madagascar , Seychelles and Cuba in a bistro atmosphere. Yelp doesn't let me properly categorize all of that. Maybe it will in future.The proprietor is the sweetest man who reminds me of my father.  We came with a party of about 40 people (where it was booked for 30) and they were more than accommodating.  The specials written in chalk on a board each tasted fantastic.  I had a hard time finding out what the 'best thing to order' would be.  But once I made a choice and asked Mr. Proprietor.. he kindly corrected me and had me order what HE deemed the best choice. (Keep in mind I asked what was best.. and am happy to acquiesce ).We had musical entertainment.  A gent who looked like Harry Belafonte but with a voice of Louis Armstrong sang joyfully and we were properly entertained.The food I ordered was the octopus which came as a sort of curry with rice.  My neighbor had the shrimp which was adequately spiced.  Both were well seasoned and tasted lovely.  The house also served us a soup as an appetizer and dessert post meal.All in all - a fun evening in a wonderful atmosphere."
/user_details?userid=P7FjfJY7s0-hlqb4UqTcoQ,Armando V.,"Westford, VT",5 star rating,"I found is wonderful restaurant while walking around  looking for a BYOW place. I found the food to be varied, delicious and with hearty portions. My wife is a vegetarian and had multiple choices on the menu. The diverse food options from different islands of the world was a real treat. The atmosphere was very comfortable and warm on a very cold day. The owner sat with us and chatted for a bit which was very nice and the art work in the walls by his artist wife was truly enjoyable with beautiful scenes of island life. The fact that you can bring your own wine/beer made this a truly inexpensive and tasty meal. Can't wait to return for my 3rd time!"
/user_details?userid=wXKnz_CLGDVzkA531JUmow,Maureen L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"There is NOTHING negative to say about this eatery! The decor is friendly, warm and inviting. The staff (the owners, I presume) made us feel like appreciated guests and never failed to ask if everything was ok at every course. And all said courses were excellent! The formula is brilliant; since most people are not familiar with Mauritian cuisine, you choose your meat (or not, as in my case; I'm vegetarian) and your cooking style. I had the vegetarian dish, Creole style. The meal starts with an AH-mazing vegetable soup, followed by a vegetable side salad and the main course. Price runs about $20 for everything. And Iles Bleues is bring-your-own-wine, so yog make it as fancy (or not) as you wish. I HIGHLY recommend Ile Bleu. I, for sure, will be back soon!"
/user_details?userid=FJ2yu9Pf5LIYcncoRKyzFQ,Lu G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"What a wonderful treat in the Plateau! We came here on a wet, slippery,cold,winter evening, and oh my, into an oasis of a lovely blue, colourful, calming, island, BYOB resto. The staff was immediately very welcoming  but unintrusive, waiting until everyone had arrived,got comfy,then approached our table to take our orders. There are 2 menus, one tasting at $20.00, another,slightly higher-priced, that is an inclusive:  fish, seafood, and chicken,all served with soup and salad,tea or coffee. My soup was very tasty, and my platter ( second menu) got me good and stuffed, the squid was not overcooked, the shrimp and scallops were perfect, the accompanying rice, perfectly cooked, no mush or stickiness, I was a happy eater. Throughout the meal, various diners at the table kept commenting on the lovely blue-hued walls and art naif painting on them,one woman remarked that it took her back to the time she spent on the islands. Loved the resto,food, service,and atmosphere.Will definitely go back."
