It took me a few minutes to notice that the restaurant is actually turning by itself which is why it's called 360. The food was amazing. I'll start with the bread, they serve it with a chorizo butter and it was to die for. The calamaries were so fresh and tasty.I took the creamy seafood rice topped with a lobster tail it was great I will definitely get that again.And for the desert I had a chocolate mi cuit. It was Perfection I cant wait to go again."
/user_details?userid=wW72FaqNPv6pdBC6AUqvcA,Hilary K.,"Vaudreuil-Dorion, Canada",4 star rating,"This is probably one of the only restaurants, to have a 360° view of the entire city of Montreal. It was quite an experience to come here with my husband. We love the fact that in a two hour sitting, we got to see the entire view without even noticing we were moving the whole time. This is one of the most romantic dates I've been to with the hubby. It was truly beautiful having a killer view of our city.What truly amazed me, was the fact that the staff knew where each dish was going to on every table. The kitchen is in the centre of the dining room and that is the only part of the restaurant that does not move so it was brilliant to see how organized they were to realize which food had been going on which table. The fact is we were moving but they were not and so for them it might seem a bit confusing and to realize this was truly superb.The service was excellent!The waiter always made sure to cater to our needs. He always came in to check on us and see whether our drinks were filled. He always made sure we our drinks were replenished and always served the food we ordered at the right time of our dinner.The food: Unfortunately, the food did not exceed my expectations how I expect it. I mean the food was OK it was not to die for but it was definitely on the good side. I was kind of hoping it was one of the best meals I've had in a while but judging on the quality, it didn't look like it was the best I've had. For example, The paella I had, was bland and dry. The scampis were chewy and shrimps in my paella were slightly overcooked as was the rice. My husband's dish, as well, was a bit on the over cooked side even though we asked for medium rare. The food was OK but again I was expecting a bit more as the prices were a little bit on the pricey side.Overall, this place is only awesome if you're here for the experience as the scene is quite hard to pass up on. However, if you're here solely for the food, I would suggest you try somewhere else before you come here as this is more of an experience kinda restaurant that is very rare and probably the only kind we have in Montreal. It's a perfect recommendation for a first romantic date if you're into those like me. Cheers"

/user_details?userid=TCcQd4C_nZAlKIfPJQwlIw,Omar S.,"Birmingham, AL",5 star rating,Portus 360 was very nice. The restaurant is on the top floor of the building and it is a circular rotating  restaurant. The restaurant overlooks the city of Montreal (making for good views during the day and at night for the city lights). The charcuterie board included 2-3 different sausages and the lamb was well perpared. Porrus 360 was a nice experience.
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Nice view, average food. We tried several appetizers and main dishes. They were all ok but expensive for the portion size. We shared the sardines, octopus, calamari, cod cake and shrimps as appetizers. The octopus was a bit too tough and overcooked, but the other ones were good. I had the cod duo as a main dish and although it wasn't bad, it wasn't impressive either. I also found 2 bones in my fish while chewing so I had to be extra careful when eating it. As for the ambiance and view, it was amazing as there aren't many restaurants with a rotating view. The place was clean and our waiters were nice and friendly.  Overall, it's a good place for a special event or a date. However, I wouldn't go here just for the food."
/user_details?userid=188nNkbt92KZoF4QtF7ApQ,Matt G.,"Morrisville, NC",4 star rating,"Elegant dining room with a pleasant ambiance on the 31st floor of the Evo building in a revolving restaurant. Clearly you come here for the city views, as the restaurant turns you can see large parts of downtown, old town, and the river. We did dinner here so with the night time views there is a bit of reflection on the windows and pictures don't come out great. Didn't like that the pillars in the windows are too close, so its hard to get pictures without them showing. The Portuguese music playing is quite nice.Main courses are quite expensive, they also have Portuguese tapas that can be shared. We had the cod croquettes, the shrimps in sauce and seared mushrooms dish. The cod croquettes were not very warm, served with a bright yellow mayo. This dish was just Ok. The shrimps were four huge ones served in a thin yellow broth type of sauce. This broth was very good. The mushrooms were a bit plain tasting. Wouldn't say that anything was spectacular tasting or memorable. You are also served some complimentary bread, marinated olives and beans. For dessert we had the chef's selected assortment, which was quite nice and the cheapest menu option, blueberry muffin, chocolate truffles, marengue, other type of chocolate and fruit. Initially came here thinking it would be possible to just have coffee or drinks with dessert while checking the revolving views as I had done something similar to that in another fine dining revolving restaurant nearby. But you have to order food here. There is a bar area just below, which apparently was closed. On a Friday night. Weird. Still worth coming for the experience and unique views, but would keep food orders to a minimum. The restrooms have complimentary cups of mouth wash."

He told us he delayed it on purpose so that we can have a nice view of the sunset with our dinner!We started off with the cod croquettes which were perfect!  They brought out complimentary bread, chorizo butter , and olives !  You can ask for more bread if you wantFor our main dish we got the seafood platter that feeds two.  This was so worth it.  Lots of seafood and super fresh. The sauce was delicious I wanted more bread to dip it in! Highly recommend this place"

(Keep in mind that the USA Dollar exchange is $1.28 in Canadian dollars-so it is an excellent deal!).  The staff is bilingual and if you do not understand French they will describe the options in English.Our Orders:The meal starts off with authentic French Baguette with olive oil and an olive medley.I had the Octopus appetizer which was a tender leg with radicchio on top with a accompaniment of caviar and greens.  For the main Meal=Pork Medallions with Fingerling Potatoes and a pickled beet and grilled zucchini medley.My parents had-a creamy soup (I forget the kind as I was into my Octopus!), Portuguese Seafood Stew and Monkfish.Dessert was an elegant chocolate Cheesecake with pistacchios and creme fraiche.Outstanding meal and view. Will NOT dissappoint.About Chef Helena-""Helena launched her second book, Helena's Portuguese kitchen, at Éditions de l'Homme, in the fall of 2015 (available in both French and English) and announces the relocation of its first creation: the Portus Calle will be reborn Portus360 in the spring of 2016 in the premises of the former ""Tour de Ville"", beacon of Montreal culture.""  Source: portus360.com/enFYI-My favorite part is the inception of the meal when your food is served-the wait staff always says ""Bon Appetit!""Also all food is FRESH...there was a seafood bar displaying the fish and seafood."

The beef chin steak was cooked to perfection combined with the sauce (I taste HB sauce and maple syrup) it's just a wonderful combination.My coworkers ordered salmon and octopus salad, they all have the same delicious comment.Must go back!"

Obviously, the decor is outstanding even if truly a rotating dining room+wine= me getting sort of dizzy.The food was not as portuguese as I would've tought. The appetizer, a black cod gravlax with pea puree was amazingly delicate with of course a strong portuguese origin. However, the sweet calvados and olive oil trou normand that followed was confusing. Don't get me wrong it was the best trou normand i've never had, but served just after a small appetizer, when everyone is truly starving already, it felt out of place. The main dish was a decadent wapiti, I believed cooked sous-vide to perfect condition. It was a complete treat as was the chocolate dessert too. I think the team is making the most from a unique location that could've seemed kitch but is instead elevated to a delicious and gastronomic experience."
/user_details?userid=-8nmj3B-tfY_vFiimtBOsw,Sanaz N.,"Laval, Canada",4 star rating,"I want to Portus for a special birthday occasion. I had reserved online and made a special request to have a table by the window. The day of our reservation, the hostess called to confirm, I mention to her that this was a special birthday occasion and to please make sure our table is by the window. She said she couldn't guarantee anything and their policy is first come first serve. I wasn't happy with that, what is the purpose of reserving then??Anyways we got there at 7pm on a Saturday night and thankfully we we able to get that last table available by the window. The restaurant is situated on the last level of the Evo Hotel, and what's so famous about it is that it has a 360 turning restaurant that shows you the whole city. What They did to make it even more fabulous is that almost every indicated where in montreal you can see. From the. Mounts to the bridges to rivers and  iconic buildings in Montreal. I found it stunning.Now about the meal we ordered kale salad and grilled calamari. I asked the waiter if the sixes were shareable and he said yes. That's not true, the 14$ kale salad was the size of my palm. It was.not enough for one imagine two. The 16$ calamari were a bit better in size. As for our main course, I had the fillet mignon, I really loved this dish, well seasoned, with mas potato, carrots, grilled cauliflower and a pretty amazing wine sauce. Honestly a well presented, tasty dish. As for the other meat, it was a duo cod fish, one was a white cold mashed with potatoes, cream  snd veggies and made like a patty, while the other was grilled black cod that rested on top of the other fish patty, all with sweet potato puree. As personally didn't like that dish, but then again I'm nor a seafood lover. But my friend loved it. We had also ordered a bottle of wine. All together at the end of the night came out to 200$,I wouldn't mind paying that if the portions at least the appetizer portions were  too par. But staff is amazing, attentive and very nice. Place has amazing views so you are playing for that. In my opinion skip the appetizer and just order a meal, you will get a better ration of quality price."

Although it was rainy and grey today, the view was still pretty good. Took us a bit over 1 hour to eat lunch and we turned about 180 degree (I suspect you can see the 360 degree view in about 2 hrs).We were seated quickly and the waitress took our orders in a timely fashion which is important during lunch when most people only have an hour to eat.Had the calamari and potato salad and my friend had the soup of the day. I must say that the entree came extremely quickly...I'm pretty sure it was already prepared in advance. Nonetheless, the salad was very good. I expected big chunks of potato and small bits of calamari but presentation was fantastic. Bits of calamari were incorporated into the potato and green peas salad with fried calamari tentacles on top. The fried calamari added a really nice texture to the salad.The main course was a seafood dish...I must say that the portion was pretty generous. The spicy buttery sauce went really nicely with the shrimps, octopus and calamari.Dessert was also delicious...the light mousse with raspberry jelly went well with the more chocolaty cake/brownie.Definitely recommend going there for lunch with customers, friends or date. Will absolutely come back try their dinner menu."

I literally just finished my meal, all the while in awe of the stunning 360 views of Montreal as the sun set into the night.

Located on the top floor, this place has a gorgeous 360 degree view of the city!! The platform of the restaurant actually slowly rotates, giving you the full panoramic view when dining.Our waitress was very pleasant and helped us in our choice of wine pairings and tasting, and guided us with the menu and specialties of the place. We ended up starting off with bread, olives and confit along with our cod croquettes entrée which were pretty good, being soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Next, for the main course, we ordered the seafood creamy risotto and the Portuguese beef sirloin steak. The steak was well seasoned and juicy, pairing well with its sauce and the red wine that was recommended. The risotto was deliciously creamy and cooked to perfection, and they were very generous with their seafood!! This is a must try for seafood lovers! I would definitely recommend this place, for dinner or lunch and it's perfect for dates. The view is beautiful, the staff are great, and the food is decently priced and worth it. The only small con would be the wait time for the main dish, but the food is worth the wait!"

We had gone to Portus Calle a few years ago and loved the food and ambiance. The view is very nice from above and it took a little over 2 hours to do a full turn. It is a lot bigger and less intimate than Portus Calle. The concept is a bit touristy but pleasant for a special occasion. As the evening crowd came in, it does get rather noisy....As for the food, we ordered the asparagus salad, the seafood platter for 2, razor clams and a whole fish to share. The seafood is prepared expertly, fresh and well seasoned. It was nice that the whole fish was served table side by the waiter. Our waitress was curteous and efficient though I was disappointed that she didn't have much knowledge of the daily catches. A few of these were commonly consumed Portuguese fishes (we chose something called the Goraz only because the  name sounded funny :P) and when asked what their taste or texture were, she had no clue....we took a chance and luckily it was delicious.Overall nice experience."

Guess you pay extra for the view (which is amazing). Had the tuna for main, and while the fish was amazing the ""rest"" on the half-filled plate was disappointing: 4 pieces of cauliflower and a carrot, all very al dente. There was a squash mousse somewhere but that was literally a tablespoon smeared across the plate for deco. A shame. The dessert was nice, both the Natas do céu and the pasteis de natas were lovely. Three stars for ambience, desserts and service."

The food and the service were great and the wine list is really interesting with a lot of great Portuguese wine options. The pace of the meal was nice, fairly slow but that was wonderful so you could really enjoy the meal and talk and drink wine in between courses. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it would be nice if they gave a complimentary bread basket.

The dining area rotates around so you get a 360 view of the scenery but you'd have to be eating at the restaurant for around 3 hours before it makes a full turn. You barely notice it move because it moves really slow. The place is designed very nice. They have really nice decor. The washroom is on the lower floor. So is the coat check.  They have menus in both English and French.  Staff here are very friendly. They are willing to explain the menus in great detail. However the food here is not that tasty.

I was here 2 weeks ago and there was some aged 45-60 days.  When asked about the he very rudely stated ""never"". Next thing I know, he walked away from us and started helping another table. About 15 minutes later, we had another waiter come up to our table and asked if we had questions about the menu. Again we asked about the tomahawk steaks. He went back to get their selection and we selected he one we wanted. Everything seemed to be back on track. Once we finished dinner, the dessert menu arrived. Some of the items we didn't know what they were. So we asked Yassine what they were. As we were deciding, he again just walked away from us without saying a word. Who does that?  So at that point we decided we just wanted the check so we could leave. We had to flag him down 15 minutes later. Because of this poor service and rudeness, I tipped less than I typically do. As the receipt was printing, he began to argue about the tip. Well Yassine, here's another tip for you, a tip is EARNED.  And you failed to earn it with your poor and rude service. That being said, the steak and food was delicious. We had a shrimp appetizer along with asparagus salad, both were outstanding. But I can find that quality of food at another place with service that tells me they appreciate my business. Sorry Portus360, you need to have a 180 on your service. I won't be back."

The food and the views are great.During our anniversary lunch we were waiting for almost 90 minutes for our main course to arrive (the restaurant wasn't busy) and then one of the dishes was not what we ordered.

Usually when restaurant makes a mistake you don't pay for it.We couldn't stay there any longer, so I decided to to contact the restaurant later and share my thoughts and experience. The answer from the manager was just ridiculous: we were busy and mistakes happen.I sent my comment about what I think about it and never got any response. I contacted the restaurant via Facebook page and was also ignored. Several times.This is really disappointing and actually quite shocking to me. There are so many other places where you can go for lunch or dinner. I advise you to avoid Portus 360. A restaurant is not just food, it's the whole experience.

While it's not somewhere I would go every weekend or every month for that matter (because it is on the pricey side), it's a great special occasion restaurant ! The restaurant not only overlooks the city of Montreal , it spins so you get the full360 (pun fully intended :) ). The view is great in daylight and once the sun goes down and you don't feel the spinning, you are just made aware of it by your surroundings and view changing. The decor inside is chic but not snobby with lots of space for seating (even for large groups) The service is friendly and professional, they really make sure to check in on you and make sure you are enjoying your experience and that you have everything you need. Like I mentioned this place is on the pricier side but in all fairness the food delivers on freshness,presentation and  flavour. We were a group so we opted for the tasting/sharing menu which is a great deal because you get to try a few different dishes and the portions are large enough that you will leave full. We had a variety of items from Tuna tataki, shrimp, octopus salad , tuna tartare, asparagus salad, lamb , pork and dessert -everything was so well prepared and fresh/packed with flavour. (We had family in from Vancouver with us that night and even THEY were impressed by the quality of the seafood) They have a great wine selection to pair with the food as well.

/user_details?userid=4q8LJpFL2mvONI-kSk5SVg,Cynthia M.,"Falls Church, VA",4 star rating,"Came here with my mom and did the fish tasting menu, with the short rib tapas as an extra because she wanted to try it. The view is beautiful (although the windows kind of need to be cleaned), we spent ~3 hours there and did 1.5 rotations. We loved the tapas plates at the beginning, they included octopus, shrimp, tuna, salmon, lobster, and asparagus salad. The main dish was a small piece of fish with sweet potato pureé and veggies. It was just okay, especially compared to the appetizers. The short ribs were not really what she expected, and had kind of a stewed consistency. Dessert was lovely, and our server was fantastic. I thought the tasting menu was a full representation of the kitchen's potential, but if I came again I think I would just get a bunch of tapas plates."
/user_details?userid=GlEhxPlaofxOOvcf-5guvw,Cindy D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Had an amazing time at Portus360 today. Our reservation was for 12:30 (party of 5) and we were seated very quickly. Firstly, I have to mention that the sun enters beautifully in the room and makes it very peaceful, the reason I mention it is because I have recently tried another restaurant with ""a view"" in the same area and everything seemed so dark (the dark decoration probably didn't help). We ordered from the lunch menu (25$) and weren't disappointed...Everything tasted amazingly well from my beef teriyaki to the duck and the peach dessert all the guests were unanimous they had a great time. My only negative comment would go to the time they took before taking our orders apparently because of a miscommunication between waitresses but they apologized for it and it was much appreciated. I definitely recommend this Portuguese restaurant if you're in the area, you won't regret that 360-degree rotation view of downtown Montreal."
/user_details?userid=oB8ZRBBeDFKTO9tnzjXbxQ,Robert P.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"My wife and I went out on a date, a nice way to put some extra spark in our relationship.This restaurant is quite nice looking and the revolving room lets you get a great view of the city.For starters my wife had the fried octopus which she loved. I had the salad which was ok but for the size, and quality it was way over priced at $16. But still we were impressed that we started to make plans to come back with my wife's parents and our kids.Then came the extremely long wait for our main course. I was starved. Yes we got 4 small pieces of bread in a quaint bag. But do they fisinfect it between customers? You have to put your hand inside the bag and it is the flu season. Then despite making it very evident that the bag was empty, I had to ask for more.Finally the main courses came.My wife had the seafood risotto. The seafood was ok but the rice and sauce were inedible because of the extreme saltiness.I had the steak. A very small piece of meat, which would have been ok except for all the gristle. I even had trouble cutting the meat despite using a steak knife.Why didn""t we send our food back? We were hungry and tired, and really didn't want to wait another very long time.We had a dessert that was very average, and I had an ordinary green tea for $4!!!So our second time here - first and last.So the place is nice and the revolving part is very nice. But unless you love salt or gristle, I suggest you go somewhere else."
/user_details?userid=laFwsknjneH2QoGeLbemTw,Didier H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I went to Portus twice. The first time was for a business event for which the appetizers they served were quite good and the view offered on the restaurant reception floor was quite nice. The second time was during lunch. The price for the lunch menu is quite reasonable for a three course meal.

This was my first visit to Montreal (with my mom) and I highly recommend this for scenic views of the city.The food and wine are incredible.  The décor beautiful. The service super And the staff very accommodating . Worth every penny. Will recommend!"
/user_details?userid=xz5-2fSiTyAzLybdB9tU7w,Nic Q.,"North Hatley, Canada",5 star rating,"We had no idea they had moved here from St Laurent, we found it by fluke on OpenTable last minute on Saturday night.The space is awesome and even though in the evening you don't see as much its great view of the city lights. It does take 2 hours to do the full 360, we managed to get great sights of the igloo fest on the cold snowy night. Beware that people with motion sickness might be a tad sensitive to the movement.We opted for the tasting menu which was broken down into 4 services. The scallop ceviche and asparagus salad were delicious and left us inspired to try and replicate the recipe at home. Next up were the razor clams and shrimps, both came with sauces to die for. Our main meals were red snapper and sides of vegetables, the fish was a little on the cold side as I'm guessing our waiter was busy with other tables. The dessert was an assortment of sweets such as fresh baked paste de nata, carrot cake and a Natas do ceu  We loved the fact that the first person we saw was Helen and she was working away making sure the ship was running just right."

/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"First off I have to say I've been to Helena and Portus Calle and i enjoyed them both. Helena Loureiro knows what she is doing! So my boyfriend and I attended a a birthday dinner on Saturday. The group menu consisted of four different entrees which the whole table shared, then one main for each person and three different desserts to share. First we were given bread with a chorizo spread and olives in a tiny bowl. OMG The spread was so good! I wish i didn't have to share it! The entrees were: goat cheese and cherry tomatoes in olive oil, cod croquettes, shrimp in garlic sauce, and grilled octopus. The entrees were all very good. The goat cheese and tomatoes were warm. I'm used to having bocconcini or mozzarella with cherry tomatoes but goat cheese is also a very good choice. The cod croquettes were good but it was my least favorite out of the four entrees and I've had better elsewhere. If you like cod croquettes check out Chez Doval. It was so good we ordered another round. The ones at Portus360 were more dry and grainy. I guess if you like it more healthy tasting you will like the croquettes at Portus360 better. I really liked the spicy sauce that it came with. The shrimps in garlic sauce were pretty big. The grilled octopus was cooked just the way i liked it. I was pretty full and satisfied from all the entrees and the bread. For main I had the steak. It was on a bed of matchstick potatoes and came with a side of salad. The salad was just a mix of greens and some red peppers.. it was very simple but oh so refreshing and tasty. There were pieces of chorizo on top of the steak and I don't know what the sauce was but it was thick and cheesy. MMMmm... Everything together....the cheesy sauce paired with the crunchiness of the potatoes and the extra meat on top of more meat mmm delicious! The only reason I did not give this resto five stars is because they said they would cook the steak medium rare which is how I usually like my steak but mine was more medium than medium rare. There was a birthday cake that someone brought for the birthday boy. The waiters also brought in a platter of assorted desserts but I only tried half of a tiny nata because I was so full. I definitely recommend this resto. The food is good, the view is incredible and the fact that this resto spins makes it pretty special. This resto is perfect for a date night or for a night out with friends."
/user_details?userid=37AqJydkC0EZgprx9A3qzw,Raphael S.,"Lake Hiawatha, NJ",2 star rating,"Went here for my dad's birthday and he chose the restaurant. I thought it was pretty overpriced for the amount of food we paid and the service. We ordered the seafood rice, braised short rib, seared mushrooms, calamari, soup, and the kale salad. The portion sizes were pretty small. The view was very spectacular. The restaurant revolves 360 and you're able to see various view points of Montréal. Our server though was very rude though which was disheartening, I was about to give the place three stars but on second thought of the waiter. He would smirk while we were ordering and give us faces during our order, very rude. I understand we are touristy from the beginning but it is unheard of to make faces to the customer. Shame, shame, shame. The only thing I thought was decent was the view, the bread, the olive oil and the seared mushrooms. You're overpaying for food. You can find a better meal elsewhere. Anyways, when I come back to Montréal, probably will find a different place to eat, also not that many options for vegetarians/vegans."
/user_details?userid=nxPdf1vpQ8ASdXUbOe-MLQ,Craig F.,"Sainte-Dorothée, Laval, Canada",4 star rating,"I went here with several colleagues from work. The restaurant itself was pretty cool. It sits on top of a hi rise building and rotates to give you a great view of Montreal. The grilled squid tasted great, but the portion was too small. For my main course I had the ""Arroz De Marisco"". Based on the description, i thought it was a risotto. I was pleasantly surprised with the dish. Its more like a thick soup with seafood and rice. I would go back just for that dish. The biggest disappointment was the bar. They were missing several scotches listed on their menu. Overall the food and service were great, but be prepared for the high price point."

/user_details?userid=uXvjikklZkBfXOZ5_9c3xg,John P.,"Oakville, Canada",1 star rating,"The food and view was great but I can not recommend this place. If you have a food allergy DO NOT go. We had dinner Saturday night and tried the tasting menu but explained to our waiter in both French and English that my wife has a severe allergy to shellfish (shrimp, lobster, crab) which means nothing can touch or be prepared with those items. The first sharing plate came out with a lobster salad on the same platter with the cod, ray and other fish. The server described everything to us except the lobster salad and when we asked what was in it he couldn't tell us. We got our waiter over and asked and he said it was the lobster salad and we reminded him of my wife's allergy again and that she couldn't have anything on that platter. Soon after this they brought a number of dishes including fried shrimp and the waiter carried the shrimp platter and other platters together. It seemed they didn't get or worry about the allergy so one has to wonder if the kitchen is careful in their prep and transference."

/user_details?userid=vDKJJVVwV-cuFz69jYEB1Q,Diana M.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"If you're willing to pay for under seasoned seafood, tough lamb and small overpriced portions with a beautiful view, Portus 360 is for you! I've been to these types of restaurants multiple times. I know that you're paying more for the service and the view than the actual food itself. So i came with very low standards knowing that the food wasn't going to be good. With that being said, I received the seafood rice and there was no seasoning. I had to wave down one of the waiters to get salt and pepper that they had placed on an awkward separate table decently far from us (I didnt know if it was a self serve and the waiters never came around to check up on us). You should have seen the amount of salt and pepper that i had to put to make the plate okay-ish. My sister had the lamb and it was impossible to eat. The meat was so chewy and tough that I just gave up and didnt want it anymore. Some restaurants redeem themselves with the service but it was not the case here. We were served the salted cod croquettes and the whole table thought it was overly salty. I've been to Portugal and I know salted cod, but this was veryyyyy salty, so much that our lips were so dry after eating it. We mentioned to the waitress and the first thing she said ""oh that's how it's suppose to be""... okay..... I know but that's not how you're suppose to approach the situation. I wish she was more polite about it. To top it all of, towards the end of the meal the waiters were rushing us to finish and wanted to clear our the plates before we were even done. Instead of taking into consideration the feedback and learning from their mistakes they were so quick to give us attitude and brush us off. I've never experienced such disrespectful waiters in all of the hundreds of restaurants I've been to all over the world!I understand that we were a big group of 20 people & it might have been overwhelming but that doesn't excuse the poor service and below average food. Out of 20 people, everyone had something negative to say about their food. When the WHOLE party isn't satisfied, you know it's not us being picky or trying to be an ass; it was just a horrible experience at Portus.Gave it a two star for food, then minus one for the service.TLTR: One of the worst experienced with food and service and price. I will never ever be returning and will surely never recommend it."

Let Me start by saying I have been to many Portuguese restaurants in both Portugal and in Canada... this was an exceptional experience. Helena Loureiro leads by example by keeping traditional food in mind but elevating it to another level that is so sophisticated and beautiful at the same time. Every dish was just perfect, well cooked just as ordered. The view? What an experience, it was just a perfect evening. Thank you for an incredible meal! When in Montreal we will be back!!!!"

The prices are not cheap, it's no secret that you are paying for the view first and foremost.The food was OK. I liked my dishes (despite being somewhat over seasoned) but some of my friends were not impressed.The service is what brought down my rating. It was never hostile, but increasingly unpleasant as the evening progressed. The server looked like she was tired of being there and annoyed with us. Maybe her behavior was caused by external circumstances, nonetheless it's not a nice impression to take home."
