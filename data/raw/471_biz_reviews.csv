/user_details?userid=h5eVBQ5DyrpnQOaJ9ycl3g,Shiyue X.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I came with my SO on a Saturday at 5pm for supper. It was quite empty when we got there, but it slowly filled up as the night progressed. It's currently grilled cheese month, so we each got the grilled cheese of the week, which came with a side of fries, and a drink. I got a mango monkey and it was delicious! I didn't really taste the alcohol. It just tasted like a cool, refreshing mango juice. The grilled cheese was delicious as well! It had goat cheese, arugula and sun dried tomatoes. The flavours worked very well together. The staff was helpful and attentive and they're the ones who suggested my drink when I asked for something ""fruity and doesn't taste like alcohol"". However, I felt like they were just a little pushy about selling alcohol. They asked us if we wanted another drink 3-4 times. Good service? Pushy? I'm not sure, but they were quite nice though! We will definitely be back at some point to try their regular menu items!"
/user_details?userid=MQg4uzwvNSGRXl2K7mmzow,Elvi R.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Ate here a few times during my stay in Montreal. Cute little place with good food and drinks. I love how almost everything on the menu can be substituted with vegan cheese, gravy, ""meat"". I think I have 2 favourite items on their menu, the crispy vegan chickun that you can either get as a sandwich or tacos and I also love their Tao poutine. I definitely recommend this place if you're vegan or not and are looking for a great spot to meet up friends."
/user_details?userid=DD4KCmjAdJiJfv6yJcb4Uw,Virginia L.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with my experience at this restaurant. It's also not my type of place so maybe my opinion may be a little harsh. Once I got there I asked for a glass of Chardonnay or whatever wine was on the dryer side. To get my drink, It took 2 times to ask my waiter a and once to ask the actual bartender. Mind you it was early and only a few people were in the restaurant. My friend arrived and after chatting a bit the waiter asked us to move since he had mistakenly placed us at a reserved table. We were placed at the coldest table in the resto. We had to ask for the bar (that spot too was ""drafty""). The food is okay and the price is okay. This place is better for families, I find."
/user_details?userid=CMEAQHjrRps7OMjVZQARFw,Tyler A.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"We wanted to have brunch in a part of town we don't usually go to and do some shopping afterwards. L'Gros Luxe was the perfect spot to eat before a day of clothes shopping. It wasn't pricey for the amount of food you get, but it's not the highest quality either. I wish I had eaten the potatoes first, we sat by the window and once I got to them after I ate my eggs they were already cold! Other than that it was a good experience and I wouldn't hesitate to stop by again the next time I'm in the area."
/user_details?userid=km3lnJeuDtQrtKxyU1Dwfg,Trevor T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My girlfriend and I came here after winning a Yelp contest, and we were really impressed! The Yelp contest included any grilled cheese with a side of fries or salad, and a drink each.It was grilled cheese month, and we both ordered the grilled cheese of the week, which had arugula, goat cheese, and sun dried tomatoes. The cheese and the arugula worked so well together, and the sun dried tomatoes just elevated the grilled cheese to a level that I didn't expect! I also ordered the Fougère, a delicious drink with blue sauza, lime juice, simple syrup, fresh aneth and rhubarb. It was just the perfect amount of sweetness, and the twang from the rhubarb and lime juice gave it a kick that really livened it up. I came here expecting a run-of-the-mill experience, but the food and service was really impeccable. I left with my comfort food cravings satisfied, and a huge smile of my face. 100% would recommend!!"

/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I came to L'Gros Luxe without knowing what to expect (reviews are mixed)... this is what my experience felt like:Pros :- L'Gros Club Sandwich was really good. Lots of authentic white meat chicken with fresh ingredients. Solid sandwich. This however was my 2nd choice as I first opted for the chicken bahn mi but they were out of baguettes? Anyways, I upgraded my side of fries to onion rings. They were very tasty and done right.Not-Pros :- As mentioned above, out of baguettes!- The potion size of my onion rings were pretty economical. They were under the rim of the onion ring bowl.... I did not find the price tag economical however. So please.... beef up your side portions please. This is important.- I had the ice cream with cookie dough for dessert. Sadly the cookie dough wasn't warm enough to give you that sexy hot and cold dessert excitement everyone craves each and every day of their lives. Simply put, it was ice cream with less cold cookie dough. It did take a significant amount of time for our dessert to be given to us... so maybe it was sitting on a counter for awhile? Either way, it was OK but the plate missed its mark.- We opted for the Bourbon lemonade and it was mediocre. Not terrible per say but definitely not the best I've had. Wouldn't opt for it again if I'd go back.- Service was friendly but very busy. Our dining experience dragged on as we waited and waited. They could have used an extra hand or two to get the tables going.Overall it was ok but I don't find myself coming here again any time soon."

/user_details?userid=Gvak_knnthc9b6jWGRmLFw,Alli G.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"YUM!  Great brunch restaurant in Le Plateau.I came here on a Saturday morning with my friend who lives in Montreal.  I'm an American and an Anglophone, so I was very appreciative when they offered me an English menu.I ordered a cappuccino and my friend ordered a non-alcoholic ginger beer to calm his stomach from the night before (haha).  Both were excellent.For brunch, my friend ordered the Classic with smoked salmon.  The Classic includes 2 eggs, toast, breakfast potatoes, and fruit for €7.  You may add meat to your breakfast for €2-3.  That's a great deal!   I ordered the Benedict Poutine with sausage, but I received (and was charged for) the steak.  My Francophone friend confirmed that my French was correct when I ordered sausage and not steak, but honestly this error really worked out in my favor because the steak was DELICIOUS.  It was absolutely fantastic.  I have no regrets.  I felt no need to tell my server about the mishap.My favorite part about this restaurant (other than the scrumptious steak) was the charming outdoor garden.  I loved eating outside.  The atmosphere was quiet and relaxing.  There were very few guests for a Saturday morning.  It was very peaceful.  I most definitely recommend eating here!  Yum!"
/user_details?userid=ASBO8k5IMtD6lxij0ceWhw,Jose M.,"Lachine, Lachine, Canada",4 star rating,Great service from the staff. The Mac and cheese with Alfredo sauce and Italian sausages is a killer.

We shared a plain poutine for an appetizer, and got vastly different things for dinner including a mock fried chicken sandwich, Thai salad, fish and chips, burrito, and grilled cheese club. Bilingual service was friendly and relaxed, and it was very easy (although unnecessary, at 5) to make online reservations for the same day."

Fried pickles, L'Gros Luxe Poutine, Fish Tacos = happiness.Great variety of cocktails + Draft Beers.Fauna: from students, to couples, to guys that the only thing that they picked - up the last year(s) was a cold and try to get attention by being super loud. Get a grip dudes can't attract the ladies this way.Of course we shall be back. We love it here!!"
/user_details?userid=-kkHPNvc4dxBHmYgHCNVfQ,Jax L.,"Boone, NC",4 star rating,"Ordered the porc burgers and onion rings. Both were really delicious (the pulled porc burgers were better than the pulled porc tacos, which I had the time before). Also got the mango cocktail and the st Patrick's day shot special, and both were also really nice. Service was good too."
/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great restaurant at an even greater price. I've been coming here for years and the service is always good. Fun decor and atmosphere. I'm a creature of habit so I basically get a few dishes and rotate each time I come. The grilled cheeses are good and the side salad it comes with is delicious. The chicken burger is also delicious. My absolute favourite dish is the general tao chicken wings, which are incredible.The drinks are excellent and it's a wonderful place for a date or night out with friends.The only thing that I would say the restaurant is lacking is space. The tables are really close together and there is usually a wait near dinner time (they don't take reservations)Otherwise, I love going here and I really recommend."

Came here for brunch and I have to say it's one of the cheapest brunch I had in town (finally potatoes priced right ;)). The vibe is great and the price is right. The food is ok, sans plus.

Oh, did I  mention that it's very affordable. Yes, finally a hip place that doesn't over charge for everything. I loved the grill cheese with pulled pork (special ordered) the fish tacos, and the poutine with sweet patatoes. ..mmmm delish. We've dinned here a couple of times and sampled some of the clever drinks they cook up. Ask he waiter to reccomend something and dive right in.Last visit we were 3, ordered dinner and a pitcher of burbon lemonade for under 20$ per person."
/user_details?userid=AOpLGvxlr4V4iUNCbLh-lw,Frederic N.,"Tarrytown, NY",4 star rating,"Food Is excellent. You must get a bloody  Caesar. They allow you to add on entrées on top of the drink!  Hard to describe, but very cool.A nice upbeat atmosphere and dynamic service. I had the club, which was excellent. The spinach salad and fries were also very good. The service is a little bit slow, and the staff is overwhelmed if you come on a busy night, but it is not slow enough to make it a serious issue."
/user_details?userid=XZfv70IsujPrIMGKeL9kdw,Vanessa F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Second time I've been at a Gros Luxe in a week! Prefer this location to the one on the Plateau because of the cosy interior. Super-friendly service at both locations though. So glad that they have vegan options -- so far I've had the mac + cheese and poutine and they were both great. Happy to have found this place -- great place for me and my omnivore partner to go. Hopefully they'll keep expanding the vegan menu. ;-D

/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"$25 mimosa pitchers and brunch plates under ten bucks? Um. Yes please.My partner and I both ordered the fried chicken- it was great and the perfect portion size.Pro tip: get a side of tater tots. It's not formally on the menu as a side but they do it.The staff were very jolly and relatively attentive despite being rather busy. I could however see that other folks in the resto were not getting the prompt service they wanted. The waiters joking demeanor with us could also be attributed to the fact that it was noon and we were already throwing back mimosas like we were in on some impending global bubbly and OJ shortage.I'll just say it: the hipster decor is over-done in a way that only made me laugh, but hell, I'll deal with it if the drink and food are gonna stay this delicious and this affordable."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",3 star rating,"Nice to have another option in the area, and a fun one at that with the crazy layered Ceasars and the weirdly, surprisingly delicious deep fried avocado. The room is warm and cozy and almost disturbingly trendy, and nicely laid out in two smaller rooms for additional intimacy. The bartender makes a tasty hot Jameson chocolate if you're looking for something sweet and cozy. A weird fit for the Mile End but I'll go with a-ok."
/user_details?userid=UcZt9XOzxdIquC99-9RgTg,Steph P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is my favourite restaurant in Mile End! The mac and cheese is seriously one of the best in Montreal. Lots of vegetarian/vegan options, the staff are super nice and everything is delicious!!"

Got the veggie burger which was great, but had to take out two stars because we ordered at 5:30 and got our food at 6:35. The restaurant was almost empty, so we don't understand why it took so long."
/user_details?userid=AuEHPR3Fj7qsuRWiXRy0yA,Laura L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Had to wait 40 mins after we had been told it would be about a 20 minute wait. But had the experience been worth it that would not have been a problem.The good:Look: the place looks very good and welcoming. The staff are all trendy and so is the clientele.Cocktails: ordered the Billy le Kid- amazing! Seriously worth 11$ and one of the best cocktails we've had in Montreal. But we also ordered the pickle... which was not so good, as it was lacking pickle.Now for the bad:Service: service is very ""when and if we show up you must be ready to order, and good luck getting a water refill""... Also feels rushed. We were seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant, where all the wait staff were passing, but we had to ask each and every time we wanted more water. Plus they kept hitting our jackets as they walked by. We actually ended up sliding our table out of the way.Ambiance: it is way way too loud for a dinner type place. If this place wants to be a bar it should decide to be so, but right now it feels like its not sure whether its a bistro or a bar, and the loud drunk clients kind of ruin your dinner conversation.Food: Honestly, had we not found a long blond hair in our deep fried pickles, the food would have been really good, and the place probably would have gotten 3 stars. But when you're paying 60$+ for a meal, you really expect better hygiene standards for the food.- The veggie burger was quite good, as were the onion rings- The poutine grilled cheese, was literally just poutine slabbed between two toasts.. Could have benefited from extra cheese.All and all, will not be going back... 60$+ seems like a bit of a rip off.. and it's too bad because we really really wanted to like this place. It has potential, it could be a five star bar, or a five star place for dinner, but because it's trying to be both... and is offering long blond hairs as unwanted garnish, it's a two-star disappointment...."

It was thursday around 7pm and already very loud and packed and dark in there.We managed to get two stools at the bar, less intimacy but you get the barman's barman-ing skills as a show while you wait and eat. Plus, the place is so loud and tables so close to each other, I don't think you get much intimacy anyway!Great cocktail and beer options and the menu is original while still pushing your comfort food buttons. We had the duck tacos and the naan-dog, both were tasty and filling and the price was quite good (each 9$ - served with fries)So sure, it's not the place to go when you want to be asocial and eat in a quiet and relaxed atmosphere but once in a while we all need a little bit of l'gros luxe!"

It was a bit packed and the waiters were a bit all over the place, but we managed to get a table. The food options were pretty good, especially since there was a grilled cheese poutine! (Pretty tasty, I'm telling you.) Lots of vegeterian options too, which is a big plus. It's not pricey so you can spend a bit more and get some delicious dessert (or drinks)!"

/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"I really enjoyed l'gros luxe. The prices were more than fair for the fresh&delicious food and great drinks. When I went they did not accept reservations so there was a bit of a wait but it wasn't too long. They have a great selection of Bloody Caesars and you can even order them accompanied by appetizers such as sliders, onion rings or egg rolls as their garnish! Their menu offers a variety of options from healthy to junk food so you will be able to accommodate different tastes if going there as a group. My personal favourite splurge there is the poutine grilled cheese , yes you read that correctly , POUTINE GRILLED CHEESE! And it's every bit as delicious as it sounds :) it's a must try. The service was very warm and friendly and the decor was laid back and comfortable but still with a fun energetic vibe."

The food however, felt a bit short, hence my 3 stars. It wasn't bad, but it felt a bit ordinary.I had the special grill cheese with fries, and my girlfriend took the club sandwich. I think the fries is probably one of the item that would be worth big time to be improved. They tasted like run-of-the-mill frozen fries.It is, however, a pretty good value for its price. I wouldn't mind going back if my friends asked, but it wouldn't be my first choice."

Everything tastes frozen or from a packet. It's got a fun vibe and the cocktails are good (Caesars). I'd go with a large group who wanted a snack and a bite to have with drinks rather than a gastronomic experience. Maybe like a work leaving party/ birthday thing. Very meh."

I completely understand why it maintains such good reputation. I truly do not have a single complaint. Their food is casual, yet original and loaded with flavour. My pizza with sweet cherry tomatoes, goat cheese a fried egg and arugula was outstanding!!!!Our food arrived within 10 minutes since we placed our order. It arrived hot, and perfectly presented. Our waiter was very kind and polite. Overall this is a wonderful place loaded with charm and originality. It has a old fashioned decor, done perfectly throughout the restaurant. I will no doubt be returning here again and, again. A little side note.. I did not give it 5 stars, simply and only because parking anywhere near the restaurant is difficult. So I would suggest you go by bus/metro(Subway) Try to avoid going there by car."

/user_details?userid=-KpEgEen1tj-jdjIS7uVOw,Isabelle R.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Firstly, the other L'Gros Luxe on St Andre is much better than this one but I've only been to that one once so I'm not the best judge. This one, on the other hand, is on the corner of my street, so I have attempted learning to like it about 5-6 times and each time I come out angry and disappointed. I think they started off as a schtick- trying to get people to come in with cheap beers and cheap meals and then hoping to keep them as patrons. It pops up now (assuming after a few hefty fines) that they only have a liquor license if you order a full meal, but caesar-meals (the drink not salad) are their specialty, but you now need to order another meal to be able to even have your meal-drink. They label themselves as a ""bar"". And... They open at 4pm (not even for lunch) and close whenever they want (9-10pm often). Ok- so the menu. I heard that everything is under 5$ and that's what the whole city was talking about when L'Gros Luxe first opened. But, wait. Menu was under 5$ for the first while. Now it's super expensive!!! Like 6$ for a crappy, chewy, small burger. You want cheese on it? 2$. You want a side? Fries or salad? Add 2 more bucks. So now you have a bad caliber burger for 10$. Why not add a 20$ caesar to that? ...Cause it comes with another, even smaller crappy burger. All the portions are small and nothing is cheap and the quality isn't good at all.Their fried pickles are fantastic and that's why they get 2 stars.The staff is also all very friendly and helpful."
/user_details?userid=irwCLkMtMuy3WoGaCgfzIg,C D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,One of my favourite places to eat and/or have a drink. The staff is awesome. I recommend this place to so many people and rave about eating avocado fries everywhere I go. I was sad to hear they took them off the menu though... :(
/user_details?userid=kneX5ZeKlEVJ7qvg_EXBeg,Lizzy A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This is the place that I go to in the area when my friends and I can't come to a decision on where to go.  It has something for everyone, especially in the way of drinks.  The cocktails are unique and delightful. I think the food is decently-priced for what you get and has always been tasty. For this reason, L'Gros Luxe is one of my staples. One drawback for bringing groups of people here is that it's quite noisy -- I have literally yelled at my friends over drinks here. This could be handy for dates, though, because it requires you to lean in to hear what your partner is trying to say to you, which can feel strangely intimate. I am a big fan of the tacos and the Mr. Miyagi caesar.  I get them every time."

Seems the more restos they open, the worse the quality of food, specially the burger, used to be fantastic, now dry bun, dry meat, etc. Tried again last night and again, dry everything, barely any taste, sad, smaller burger, bigger bun. Long gone is the food that the St.andre local became quickly famous for, thanks for the memories"

It can get packed in a bit deep on occasion and if you have tinnitus (as I do), it's hard to hear everyone, but everything's pretty darn yum especially if you're in the mood for a grilled cheese sandwich and some bloody marys."

BBQ mushroom tacos were just the right size for a light lunch (dont expect a generous portion, they're dainty). It was our waiters first day and we sat there very thirsty for at least 10 mins before we got water. But he was sweet and accomodating when he did get around to us. My 18 year old daughter says this place is ""so hipster it hurts"", which I think is a compliment."

/user_details?userid=nT5dDpvPTmQyAAzvbMetFg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Not expensive and quality food. However, it was really crowded (for a Sunday night) which made the service pretty slow and the waiter looked a bit exhausted. I had the pulled pork tacos... Yummy! Most dishes are in small portions so it is made for different types of appetite. I would recommend for people who are not in a rush, slightly hungry and who want to spend time in a restaurant with busy but trendy ambiance."
/user_details?userid=S_sIeCOqy7F4RFs0le1cDQ,Joel S.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,"Great selection of fun comfort food type dishes at great prices with classy pub atmosphere. 20-something crowd but friendly to all ages. Lots of tasty vegetarian options. Great cocktail menu and good micro-brewery beers. Service is pub-grade but friendly. At these prices, this place is a no brainer for fun food and bevvies."

Portions depend on what you order, but order the right combination and you can leave with a full stomach and wallet at the same time. Also the ambiance and service were pretty good too."
/user_details?userid=Jy35vq-JDtpLbvg9a9tFdg,Gavin S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Yelp's description for a 3/5 star rating is perfectly appropriate here, ""A-OK"". Service is fine, food's alright but boring, and even at 6$-7$ it's over priced for the portion size. I was in the mood for some veggies so I got the Veggie Burger (super dry) and a Beet Salad (pretty good with nice big chunks of beets). Fries were meh. 26oz house beer was solid at 6$. My friend didn't make much of his tacos or sliders, but enjoyed his cocktail. The place gets busy so we waited 30 minutes, went for a coffee nearby. It's cool that they take your phone number and call you when your table's ready, but it's not worth the wait. Maybe a good place to grab a drink and get some snacks, but not ideal if dinner is the main priority."
/user_details?userid=BcCc5krQkJpD6AxMBqvLHA,Ryan B.,"Westmount, Canada",2 star rating,"The only reason to come here is the low prices and the fact that the restaurant has a nice ambiance. It took almost an hour to receive our food (i.e.hamburgers, tacos) on a Friday at lunch time. The waitress was sweet but totally overwhelmed. Food was average, especially considering it took an hour to prepare."
