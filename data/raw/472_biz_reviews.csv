/user_details?userid=t079aTU_Ze_I2C1og_1TQw,Vince T.,"Crestline, CA",5 star rating,"Close to Courtyard by Marriott.  We got in from Saratoga and after the drive wanted something close, but not the hotel restaurant.  We saw the Yelp reviews, the menu and took the chance.  It is a small restaurant off the beaten path.  According to our server, mostly patrons from the business district for lunch and tourists in the evening, like us.  We speak a little above basic French and our server allowed us to speak when ordering, but was gracious when we got out of our league and took over in English.  Not to worry, you do not need to speak French in Montreal.  It was enjoyable for us though, to at least keep the skills fresh.We ordered the filet mignon with the mashed potatoes and asparagus and two cocktails.   The cocktails were refreshing and light.  The dinner came and the meal was cooked perfectly to order and delicious.  There are a couple of photos of the meal in the picture queue and it looked exactly the same.  The meat was so tender and of high quality.  The only problem, for my wife and I at least, is that the sauce was not necessary.  We like the taste of the meat and do not require a sauce, but in this case, it was very appropriate for the plate.  Just saying for those of you who might have the same palate.  Overall a great experience and a delicious meal.  If ever in Montreal again this will be a must stop.  The also have an ample wine selection.  You can find something affordable and appropriate for the meal."
/user_details?userid=ypkhO6BiGYpHrHsvJX0bsg,Kelly H.,"Winter Garden, FL",4 star rating,"We had reservations for 7:30 and they immediately sat us at 7:06 when we arrived.  We had great friendly service.  Our server answered all of our questions and brought us menus in English.  No far from the InterContinental Hotel and metro, it was easy to walk to.  We ordered the filet (42) and charcuterie board (32), creamy bean miso soup (8.5) and a side salad (8).  With 2 glasses of wine the bill was a bit high, but we stayed a long time and enjoyed the atmosphere and music.  The only have a few wines by the glass on the menu.  We decided to give yhis restaurant 4 stars only because almost all of their main courses contain seafood which we are not a fan of.  We were looking forward to the risotto, but were not at all interested in the octopus special."
/user_details?userid=5ca2MkCJFAMafDrRxLMlXQ,Ash L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Monsieur is a great business lunch spot with consistent service and high quality food. When i came back for dinner for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised that they can serve us really quickly to accommodate our opera at 7:30 (arrived right before 6). I enjoy all the main dishes- lamb and seafood pasta, but the ceviche was quite so so for the price  (1 scallop for $18 with an unknown mild green sauce and lots of tapiocas, interesting but less impressive than many traditional and fusion ones I've had). In general, a great choice when you are in the neighborhood and want a risk-averse, high-quality and less ""funky"" meal, especially if you are with picky or older friends/family/colleagues. (Ps: seat by the window if you could. It gets really dark as you go deeper)"

/user_details?userid=E7XP6sA25pPPMyiXWq4WUg,Nancy S.,"Port Moody, Canada",4 star rating,"This place had exceptional food.  Having a smaller appetite we chose to share a plate of oysters, a mushroom risotto with scallops and a beef barley soup.  It was absolutely delicious.  We felt the risotto was quite highly at $38. priced (we did not ask tho') and we might not have chosen it but it was to die for and the scallops were perfectly done.  Paired with a really good Sangiovese wine was a perfect balance.We ordered only 6 oysters but a mistake in the kitchen brought us 12 and no extra cost to us at $3.00 per oyster.  Thanks for the bonus.  The atmosphere was intimate.  Low light required us to use our phones to read the menu.  Service was friendly and efficient. Best meal while in Montreal but also the most expensive."
/user_details?userid=OE0cFhU_mBkCM4U4MEsp3w,Maria T.,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",5 star rating,"Went to this restaurant mainly based on proximity to hotel and good yelp reviews.  It turned out to be an excellent choice.  We had a lovely Portuguese wine, shared a couple of very good appetizers (the ravioli were memorable; the calamari were solid) and then a huge ribeye.  The ribeye was advertised  as a plate to share between two persons, but really it was more of a 3 or 4 person plate.  That said, it was incredible.  It's on the expensive side, but worthwhile.  Oh, and the service was great!"
/user_details?userid=6vgGllv3gCoz6XkudGFQjg,Phillip C.,"Poughkeepsie, NY",5 star rating,"Delicious! We came here after our reservation at Belon was cancelled due to a system blackout. So glad that happened so I could discover Monsieur. Absolutely great food, service and ambiance. Can't wait to return!"
/user_details?userid=RLalBnTD0uKkGhJhtVfL2w,E R.,"Burlington, VT",5 star rating,"This place is fantastic. We were looking for dinner and originally was headed to Belon across the street but we're met with angry employees at the door who told us they were closed (early). So we crossed the street to this little place and found a gem.While they were also closing, the host accommodated us anyways for dinner and we never felt rushed or as though we were an inconvenience. The service was excellent, professional and warm. The food was amazing - I had the carrot ravioli and my husband had the duck risotto. They made a fantastic Aperol Spritz and a cantaloupe spritz that was so refreshing. We had dessert as well (lemon ganache) that was top notch. The whole place was such a great vibe and experience, we will definitely go back."
/user_details?userid=v40m0XijE1cJvB0aYzeOug,Courtney K.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"As we were walking back from dinner, we spotted this establishment and decided to stop in for a cocktail. The ambiance is spot on and every employee seems genuinely friendly, especially the bartender that we had named Kim. Not only that, but she can make some damn good cocktails. I opted for the Strawberry Fields (LOVED it) and my boyfriend got the Black & Fashionned, which we both loved as well. All of the entrees we saw coming out of the kitchen looked scrumptious also, so I wish we would have just eaten here instead of our dinner plans beforehand!"
/user_details?userid=I1j4x5jie4VKuksHGhkfnA,Rein C.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,Can't speak for the food as I only came here for drinks - it's a spot near my hotel that's open past 9pm! The Tito's dirty martinis were made well. Service was a little slow. Place was fairly busy on a Tuesday night
/user_details?userid=l1VoG-0-bDF-us7xbWxfeg,Sammie S.,"Thornhill, Canada",4 star rating,"Solid lunch for a medium sized group today. Delicious food and great service. Bright, beautiful, clean restaurant.To start they brought us shot glasses of some yummy tomato soup. I really enjoyed my main, the vegetarian salad.The odd quirk was that several at the table had ordered the mixed grill and the cod was replaced by a different fish (a different color, so noticeable) and they didn't mention that there would be or that there was a substitution."
/user_details?userid=G6qnTlsPJJvrtC_hc33Ehw,Lyane M.,"Dorval, Canada",4 star rating,Very nice place a little chic but you dont have to be. I went on week night it was not to buzy the ambiance was perfect for date night. The service was very good and we where offered the choice of flat or sparkling water as we where seatedFood:We started by sharing the calamary apetizer. It was delicious the light breading was brilliantly seasoned and crispy on each piece. The calamary was tender and not chewy and the yogurt cucumber sauce was a perfect match. The portion was also much more reasonable than most other restaurant and was enough to share. My partner had the salmon tartare which she enjoyed very much and I had the risotto du jour : parsnip asparagus mushrooms and shrimp. All the ingredients where obviously fresh and cooked to perfection. The portion where resonable leaving us with room for desert. We chose the carrot cake and the double chocolat brownie and got our 1st disapointment of the evening. Both plate came with the same garnish of fresh berry with whipped cream and a slather of caramel. Personaly i prefer that my garnish is tailors to my dish (yes even for desert). The carrot was delicious moist and flavourful. The brownies was a different story it was more like a pound cake than a browny and I dont know why they called it double chocolat. I would definitely go again but I'd skip desert
/user_details?userid=sS_nqYLRkBVXImDhR2ijEQ,Michael K.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"The menu is authentic French cuisine that offered a diverse array of choices. The shrimp risotto was outstanding along with the filet mignon, which both were cooked to perfection. Our server Kirsten provided superb service! Ask for Kirsten and discover the different in service. If you want excellent French cuisine this is a must place to try."
/user_details?userid=e_jRFyF1nRRzP5h_5Nzziw,Ruth B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I had lunch at this placeI had a very tasty salmon entree. Nice piece of salmon sitting on veggie purée with different veggies on the side My friend had the lamb. It's a generous portion of lamb shank sitting on a sweet potato purée. I thought that lamb was ok but the salmon was exquisite. Prices are ok (around 20$ per plate) I wasn't really full at the end of my meal but I have a big appetite so don't mind me. We shared the brownie as a desert and it was everything a brownie should be: moist and rich
/user_details?userid=kVQewBV7lYsc5uUDuDEGDg,Natalie D.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I had visited this establishment last night to take part in the very popular Poutinefest. Prior to this, I had come once before about a year ago. While the food was delicious, I found the service on my first experience to be terrible (waiter forgot my order, did not bring my friend her drink despite being prompted twice, over 30 minute wait for the bill). Despite all this I decided to give this place another try.Upon arrival, my friend and i were shown our table. It was a busy night but it took over 20 minutes before anyone came to see us with a menu or water. Actually the only reason someone came was that the waitress mistakenly came to the table with someone else's food! She nicely apologized but gave the reason that her manager said everything was already taken care of (wth?). Complete lack or organization. As for the poutine itself, luckily it was the redeeming factor. Nicely seasoned and a good sized portion. It was topped with kale, mushroom gravy, parmesan shavings, fried onions and beef brisket. Licked my plate clean. At least the kitchen knows what they're doing.Despite the tasty food, i don't think i'll come back again. While the staff is friendly, their organization is shoddy and it dampens the dining experience."
/user_details?userid=lRfQpdanBnZYmReqy84L8A,Justin R.,"Raleigh, NC",5 star rating,Amazing food and wine list. The fusion of ingredients is perfectly balanced and lots of options. The organic burger is one of the best I have ever had.

Bravo to Kirsten and the entire staff."
/user_details?userid=4iHIZIzwr3mCqGfsdaALSA,Michael B.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"Wanted someplace mellow,  very close to the hotel, not touristy or a traditional heavy meat, fat and butter place, but rather more of a lighter fare, contemporary bistro with roots in local cuisine.  This place hit the spot.  Maybe 15 tables, very friendly professional staff.  Food comes out steaming hot and fresh.  Generous portions and reasonably priced for the quality. The stuffed Jalapeño with panko breadcrumb and herb crust was very tasty.  I thought the batter on the Fish and Chips was a little thick for my taste but I'm very particular and batter preferences are very personal.  The hand cut fries were excellent."

I am SO happy it was only a moment and we went in for dinner. The food and the service was amazing. We were able to be seated without a reservation- however, if possible- I would recommend since the place filled up quickly. The grilled octopus was amazing. My risotto was insane. The burger incredible. I really can't say enough good things. Cheers! Amazing food AND staff! (5/14 8pm-ish)"

/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,The girls and I went for boozy brunch on Sunday. I had the fried chicken and waffles. Honestly it was dry. :( I wish the chicken was juicier and I wish there was more sauce on the waffles. I liked the chili that was cut up because I liked the sweet salty spicy combo. I took a bite of my friend's sandwich and the taco and they were good. The best part of the experience was definitely the vibe and the bottomless mimosas! Everyone was having such a great time and Shaharah and her band were amazing!

Terrible service, pretentious food and even worse atmosphere. At 9, they starting clearing tables, and allowed crowds of people in to start dancing while our table was still waiting on our food. Nothing like a steak while three dudes shake it in your face. Brought us our bill before they even got our desserts to the table. 200 dollars and three hours later, we left without getting our last course. If it was anything like the first two courses, it probably wasn't worth sticking around for anyways...."

The butternut squash ravioli starter had us mopping up every last drop and trying not to lick the plate. The salmon tartar was also fantastic.

The interior design and food grabbed my attention and so I dragged my friend into the restaurant with me. The food was spot on!! I ordered the mushroom risotto, it was rich and creamy but not too overwhelming. At first I thought the portion was a bit small, but then it turned out to be perfect. The creme brulee was also pretty good (: Also, they had a couple of pretty cool art pieces on the walls, the one that caught my attention was this monopoly pop art painting. All I can say is it's definitely a chique little spot to visit if you ever visit Montreal. Food and atmosphere were great. Totally recommend!!"

We had the chicken soup, risotto and the linguine with mussels. The soup had a deep broth flavor with nice cubes of vegis and chicken. But the highlight was the risotto and the linguine.The risotto was really rich and tasty. It had mushrooms, asparagus and spinach. Super creamy and cheesey. The portion they served you was just right.The linguine with mussels was also a great dish. The mussels were fresh as well as the linguine. Just a touch of cream in the sauce but you could really taste the brine from the mussels.Would return again if we ever make it back to Montreal."

(I am a pretty picky eater) I was so full though if they had put another plate of them in front of me I would have eaten till I exploded.  My husband had the sea bass special and loved it. Our friend had the burger and it was gigantic and he was also pleased. We also had the marinated olives just for something small and they were superb as well.  Service was fantastic and the chef Max (came out so I could tell him how much I love the Gnocchi) Makes all the pastas by hand.  You can feel the love.  Prices are in line with what you expect for a city like Montreal.  I would return here any day I am in town.  They were also very kind to a couple that walked in after us with a few small children and the waitress went to see what they could make in smaller portions for the kids.  I thought that was very kind as many places where we live would not do that."
