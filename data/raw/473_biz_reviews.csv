/user_details?userid=CKGp1MGRjqPFheWXprJC9g,Ziv H.,"Charlottesville, VA",4 star rating,"Upper floor and Solmar and a proper Portuguese meal, at least outside of Lisbon. A good start with olive, bread and oil.A leap forward with proper grilled sardines. No small tinned guppies, but the mid sized swimmers, fresh and fleshy. A rack of lamb up-thumbed by a co-diner.At my left the pork and clams-- and odd combination, voted for a redo without the clams if faced again. No Bacalao but I probably would passed on it for the fish.   A nights entree of salmon, a white fish and shrimp troika, reccmnd'd by the waiter-- good but should've opted for the evenings whole fish dory.   Note to self, never pass on the whole fish, grilled. Evah.And, the charming 'lifer' old school waiter who complimented the women and sparred gently with the men, and then dipped into German, revealing a long-past transplant to Canada.  Recommended a white wine to us, from a Portuguese vineyard run only by women, for closer to a century than half that-- and, prodded, recounted a long story behind it,of bias, resourcefulness, sabotage, and.. a fine wine made better by his erudition. We had a second bottle."
/user_details?userid=cJCYCEfDL4n5TgU9y8RTWg,Allister D.,"Sunnyvale, CA",5 star rating,"This place was fantastic. I loved the quiet atmosphere with an intimate setting. This is a true candle-lit dinner spot with white line tables. They have a live performance from a gentleman who was singing in Portuguese and playing his acoustic guitar while people eat. It's definitely romantic.I also loved their complimentary bread assortment: garlic bread, baguette and rolls with some olive oil, olives and butter. This alone will fill you up.I really liked their scallops marinated in chorizo and olive oil. Their creamy tomato bisque was delicious as well as their duck breast with fig. The meat was cooked perfect; tender, juicy, medium rare, etc. it was like butter. I'd love to come back but this time with my gf because this place is just romantic."
/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I stopped in for some tapas and wine choosing to eat upstairs. The waiter was extremely friendly which helped calm my concern that the dining room was almost empty. I ordered the scallops and chorizo and shrimp and garlic with a Portugese white wine recommended by the waiter. The scallops had potential, but unfortunately they were small, over-cooked and cold. Too bad, the sauce was delicious. The shrimp were just OK but also cold. The wine was good. I dropped about $70 for a crappy meal and walked out hungry."

Food quality was exceptional. Allow an hour and a half to dine here. Should we return to Montréal, we will certainly return to Solmar."

/user_details?userid=eENfwrVhvOj5t7Gt1IKKAg,Kemi A.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"Had dinner here on my last night in Montreal. It was in October and most places were not crowded as it was not a high season.  Plus it was a weeknight.The place is nightly decorated, dimmed lighting. Waitstaff were friendly. Being a slow night, I think only 2 were on that night.I had the Portuguese green soup and the Green Mediterranean Porgy (which was deboned table side).  It came with a side of rice and creamed spinach. The fish was really good. My friend had the Trout/Salmon on a bed of spinach (I think it was a special) and she loved it. The spinach were very well made in addition. We did not get dessert but we had the house wine and that was good."
/user_details?userid=ZiucBP0gsJRae00QZYlOow,Anna J.,"Elmhurst, NY",1 star rating,"We didn't eat here but I would give 0 stars because this place was just rude. First they tried to get us in and then once they found out that there was 4 of us the guy in front made a noise and then told us that they didn't have any tables. There were lots of empty tables so we said how about the front and they said they don't serve food in the front just drinks. Later, we passed by some people eating in the front."
/user_details?userid=gmqXlAyZxFc2w3cndc13dw,Amrita L.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Highly recommend this place! This is a hidden gem in old Montreal! Service was extraordinary - the food tasted amaazzzzingg! We tried the mussels in tomato, wine and pepper and grilled sardines. One of the best mussels I have ever had  - the sauce was out of the world. Sardines were perfectly grilled."
/user_details?userid=fjFYpwpvlIlqoiNa3myDEA,Eugene G.,"Vaughan, Canada",5 star rating,"Magical, magnificent, monumental - these words are just the tip of the iceberg of culinary experience to be found in this place. I've enjoyed every bite, and really wished I had the room to try more. The ambience is wonderful, with live music (not sure if it's a nightly feature). Will definitely repeat, when the opportunity arises."
/user_details?userid=koG4poUzm9Sz1FvhUqS1MQ,Pamela B.,"Setauket- East Setauket, NY",5 star rating,"The servers treated our family like royalty. We had so much fun. We had the Caesar salad prepared in front of us, then smoked salmon with goat cheese and the asparagus. For mains we had filet mignon, duck with figs, scallops and linguica, and the porgie. We sampled excellent desserts flan, orange cake, crepe, and ice cream. They gave us pieces of chocolate and slices of king cake as well. The live music and the lushly decorated room made us feel we were in a different world. We recommend trying the Portuguese soft drinks, especially the passion fruit flavor. Just lovely and loving attention to every detail of the experience. They joked and told stories to the children and conversed with us in three languages. Highest of recommendations!"

From service to food to old-style atmosphere, this place is perfect.  Food is amazing and table side crepe Suzette is sublime. If you want to experience the (almost) lost art of dining this is the place for you."
/user_details?userid=xNwGEIvwZqOogZVMzmRkKg,Darryl R.,"Tokyo, Japan",5 star rating,Loved the romantic atmosphere went with my wife and baby daughter. The food  and wine were delicious. Had the tapas because I wanted to try a little of everything.
/user_details?userid=cHvFk5pBaICr9jC_noIBTQ,Izabella M.,"Boca Raton, FL",1 star rating,"This was the worst restaurant experience I had in a while. We went to this restaurant after reading the great reviews. There were only 2 tables occupied in the whole restaurant. My companion ordered shrimp that was just ok and I ordered cod (bacalao). When our entrees came, the plates were hot but my entree was cold!!!! I couldn't believe it. I called the waiter and he took it back to the kitchen, said the chef apologized. Even in a busy restaurant, cold food is never acceptable but in an empty restaurant it's completely inexcusable. Cod came back warm but so salty I could not eat it. Overpriced and subpar food. Better options for Portuguese food in Montreal than this place."
/user_details?userid=oMf8iKtTw-ZevfeoySSg1g,Jaclyn G.,"Union, NJ",4 star rating,"Walked around Old Montréal with my parents and cousin while on vacation trying to find a good restaurant for dinner. To be honest, Solmar probably would not have been my first choice and I was not really looking to eat Portuguese food while in Canada. But I was taking my parents out for their anniversary so it was their pick. The restaurant is on the 2nd floor of La Sauvigne. As we entered the dining room, my skepticism was growing since there were only two other groups dining there (especially when every other restaurant in the area had long lines waiting for tables).My dad wanted red sangria so we ordered that. We also each ordered their 3-course meal, which they offered at the time. I started off with the caldo verde - kale soup, followed with the bacalhau a ""braz""-  shredded codfish with onions & potatoes, then, the polvo à lagueiro - grilled octopus.I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. It almost felt like I was back in Lisbon eating authentic Portuguese food. The service was also very friendly despite the kitchen being a little slow at times. We were also treated to a live singing of Fado music. If you don't want to endure the long wait at the other restaurants in the area, then Solmar might be a good place for you."
/user_details?userid=ie8NTJ-ZQy4CT0V0fcFBUg,Maria O.,"Oakville, Canada",5 star rating,"Tasty and fresh seafood, excellent I should say. Friendly service. Old school ambiance. They brought olives and bread to start. We had scallops and chorizo for appetizer. For entres we had cod fish and they were also accommodating to kids taste. Fantastic."
/user_details?userid=M_UuEwc_HoqPhqgEzkjPrg,Sara M.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Amazing food, lovely atmosphere.When we walked in we were a bit nervous because there was hardly anyone there. Why wasn't there a 45 minute wait like every other place on the block? I'm not sure, but everyone waiting at The Keg (etc) is missing out.The dining room is very lovely and offers a nice view of the cobblestone Old Montreal. Not long into our Saturday evening meal, a band began to play nice music that lasted the entire time.The food was tremendous!!!!! My parents ordered the Kale Soup, grilled porgy and grilled octopus and really liked all of it. But we all agreed that my seafood rice dish was the most outstanding. It came with mussels, shrimp, scallops, lobster and clams in one of the best broths I've ever tasted. It's as much of a stew or soup as it is a rice dish. If you like seafood, order this! It also comes in a two person portion. For Montreal, prices are not bad and the wine list has some nice options. Definitely recommend."
/user_details?userid=LMwhQ3WQR_E0gKiR5qDaVg,Andres J.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"We went to eat tapas, as we were not hungry and wanted to test out small dishes because of Yelp reviews. When we only ordered tapas the waiter was not the most delighted. Ordered grilled calamari which was good, and a grilled octupus. Waiter did not bring the octupus and brought us a duck breast instead, we did not eat if because of taste.Overall I think there are better options nearby."
/user_details?userid=bFhrZ36wm6zm_dkjIpEDsg,Gustavo B.,"Fairfax, VA",2 star rating,"Service: decent. Friendly waiter. Atmosphere: mostly touristy and kind of empty. Food: we ordered some drinks, the mussels, calamari and the grilled sardines. Food was mediocre at best. Mussels were ok. Calamari was chewy. The sardines were so salty they were basically inedible. We told the waiter and he stilled charged us for it. Bottom line, wouldn't come back and do not recommend this place."
/user_details?userid=YQAUATos_4hm6l-TSDhdLA,Carlos S.,"Howard, OH",4 star rating,"Authentic Portuguese restaurant in the heart of Vieux Montreal. The prices are competitive and the selection is good. Had the pork and clams (amêijoas na cataplana) and it was outstanding. They also served peasant bread, Portuguese olives and Portuguese olive oil for dipping."
/user_details?userid=6lELxb5duHs0u9C0oNkXtw,Farah S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Excellent Portuguese food with very good seafood. Even though in the old port ,rest assured this is NOT a tourist trap .Relaxing old school surrounding and courteous wait staff. However do not come for fado , there is no fado singing here but you will still enjoy the food and the relaxed upscale but not stuffy vibe."

It made the experience a lot better because of their enthusiasm for all the food. The staff here was great. The owner came out and even said Hi at one point. If you have an appreciation for Portuguese food, this is the place for you."

/user_details?userid=KSpSxWuT2JeD1qXIL01erg,Rachel M.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"I came across this restaurant unexpectedly while trying to decide what would be best for my final evening in Montreal. I had. Even wanting some Portuguese food as it is not common in the PNW that I am aware of. I walked upstairs to the restaurant and was kindly ushered in by the kind host/server and was surprised by the live music! There was live fado music and it was lovely. I ordered wine and food and it was all delicious. I loved the kale soup, which was perfectly warm and peppery and tasty on this rainy day. I had the chefs special-an entire fish-with veggies and rice. It was all so tasty and you could tell the ingredients were quality. All went beautifully and I hope to pop back in there again!"
/user_details?userid=MbwVOuvxJrtfXUZKo2RCmg,Wilma F.,"Charleston, SC",5 star rating,"Hats off! Thanks to Yelp we found this jewel tucked away out of sight on the second floor of EAST rue Paul. There is a West & East side of the street, so don't give up. The food was the best we had in Montreal. Fresh, perfectly balanced, only the best ingredients. Props to the chef, because the passion shows. The ambiance is upscale & verged on Morrancan atmosphere. Slower paced, even though the dinning room was virtually empty on a Sunday night. You could have thought you were in Lisbon, if the gracious waiter wasnt fluent in English. Great evening!"
/user_details?userid=3FKU31oWneVqlPFamYOfHQ,R G.,"Duluth, GA",4 star rating,Came across this place while walking around in the area while visiting Montreal for Jazz Festival. Lobster bisque and Gaspacho were tasty. Entrée- Cod Fish and Mussels (from appetizer menu) were delicious.

/user_details?userid=qn1NZziyQoPXXLzgJ_iQgg,Glen S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I was in the mood for some seafood and what better place than a Portuguese restaurant. I started off with the chorizo and scallops which caught my eye as an unusual combination. It turns out that the two are made for each other - fantastic!!! Of the ample seafood selection, I chose the shrimp in Madeira sauce. It was excellent, but missed having some greens or vegetables with it.  The house red wine was excellent, but sadly forgot to ask what brand it was.  Finished the meal off with a cappuccino which was the perfect ending to a lovely meal."
/user_details?userid=74Myfl8pOGeKcmkVTimsvg,Krista M.,"Kew Gardens, NY",4 star rating,"We discovered Solmar on our last trip to Montreal 3 years ago, so wanted to find it again.  Located downtown on the second floor, the decor is old world, but warm and romantic.The waiters are friendly, but service could be a little slow.  They start you off with a bread basket and some olives.  We started with the grilled chorizo which was very good.Since I ate the pork and clams there 3 years ago, I have been touting it as the best I've had, so I had to make sure that statement was still true and am so happy that I can still say it!We ordered the pork and clams for 2 and it did not disappoint.  This really is the best I've had. The sauce is so rich and deep and flavorful, you can't help but mop it up with some bread.  The dish is loaded with tender pork and lots of small clams and potatoes.  The potatoes are so creamy and tender and not at all mushy.  It is a fabulous dish.We also decided to share the almond cake for dessert, which was delicious!  Another great experience at Solmar and hopefully this time I won't have to wait 3 years to go back."
/user_details?userid=GA07_ywp1Yr6_xVb1hlBIA,Michael S.,"Vincentown, NJ",3 star rating,"The food was delicious, and we likes no being rushed and loved the atmosphere on the street.  We had a seafood platter, mussels, and veal.  I get that prices are high in Montreal, but we felt the prices were very small for the prices charged."

/user_details?userid=-O2LGn40vXV_AvDcFPpAsA,Doris R.,"Monroe, NY",1 star rating,One star because the waiter was so nice and attentive. We were the only people in the restaurant which should have given us a clue but it was early and thought others would come in. We ordered  from the price fix menu at the suggestion of the waiter. The first course was a potato soup with no flavor. The shrimp bisque was just ok but both soups were warm not hot. The next course was grilled sqid without any seasoning and my husband had shredded cod with potato which might have been ok if it were served hot but the potato had a musty flavor. It was just not a good meal.

I never would have expected the best meal we would have in Montreal to be Portuguese, but I was pleasantly surprised! The scallops and chorizo were fantastic, the atmosphere was lovely, and the staff was pleasant and very helpful. I would return in a heartbeat."
/user_details?userid=bh6E8_BJG2Vz_tskThpX_g,Rachel C.,"Lake Pleasant, NY",2 star rating,"My husband and I were in Montreal for a weekend, and considered Solmar, b/c it was Portuguese and we figured it'd be something different. There's an outside seating area, but we found out it was for the other restaurant attached to this one.  You go up some stairs and through a door and this one's kind of hidden. It was mostly empty. My husband ordered a Portuguese beer and for appetizers, we got the Duck with Figs, both of which were pretty good. And it ended there.  We put all of our orders in together in the beginning. My husband got the Rack of Lamb, and asked for medium rare. I got the grilled Cod fish.  We waited over an hour for our food. Over an hour! When our food arrived, we were beyond starving, and the food was horrible. The Lamb was more rare. The Cod still had the horrible taste of fish and was so salty, i could barely eat it. We've had Lamb and Cod before, and this was the worst one we've ever tried. I think they might've ran out of Cod, bought some on the spot, and didn't have enough time to clean it well. The staff was friendly enough and kept apologizing. I would've preferred if they told me they didn't have what I ordered and gave me an option to order something else. I wouldn't go back here or recommend this place to anyone."

/user_details?userid=C9aQDzAh5exRJwG4PLhauQ,E O.,"Dallas, TX",5 star rating,"Solmar is only open for dinner during the summer, and although the website said it would be open at 5pm, at 515 the door was still locked. Unperturbed, we went downstairs to their sister restaurant, La Sauvigne and inquired. They said Solmar would not be open until 530, but that we were welcome to sit in La Sauvigne and eat from the Restaurant Solmar menu. We are so glad we did! It was early in the evening--we wanted to eat before hopping back over the border to Vermont--and tapas was the perfect light food. Our very helpful waiter with the charming French accent made excellent recommendations from both on and off the menu including garlic shrimp, scallops with chorizo (not too spicy, but nicely flavored), grilled calamari (very large portion for tapas), watercress and tomato salad in a lovely vinaigrette and a small platter that included duck confit, smoked salmon and prosciutto. That, along with the *outstanding* bread they serve and a split of a nice Spanish prosecco nicely filled 3 adults and 3 children (ages 7-12) with just enough room to spare for two orders of their decadent profiteroles--ice cream-filled pastries coated in delicious chocolate. Great, knowledgeable service, reasonable prices given the area and quality of food, and a lovely atmosphere. We look forward to going back!"
