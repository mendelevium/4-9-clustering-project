Fried chicken, bubble tea, desserts and munch more.The peanut butter dumplings were a little spicy but super creamy and hit the spot. I enjoyed the fired chicken bites would of been better with some sauce but it happens. Spring rolls were okay again no sauce.I enjoyed this spot thanks to Uber eats if you spend 30$ you get 30% off."

Besides, taro bubble tea and beef noodles are worthy a try as well! The ample space and relaxing vibe in the store make it great place for friends reunion. It looks all prefect except for the long waiting time for food and service when this place is packed."
/user_details?userid=1zxXP-HfI3Ycsv7xuZanaQ,Michael K.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,Came to Chicha the day after valentine to get some bubble tea.The wife and i were craving the winter melon bubble tea.They told me they were out and almost out of most of the popular ones.They convinced me to try early grey and jasmineAfter the first sip it tasted like windexI told the girl and she said nothing they can do because I took a sip.I asked here how I am suppose to know how it's taste if I don't taste it.After my wife went back and forth for about 10 minutes they decided to refund us our money.This was my go to place maybe they were just having a bad day
/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"I had dinner here with my husband and it was pretty good. I got the Popcorn Chicken Platter ($12) and my husband got the Shrimp and Mango Salad ($12). The Popcorn Chicken Platter came with obviously popcorn chicken, but also rice and a salad. The popcorn chicken was really tasty. The pieces were crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. The seasoning was slightly spicy which I liked, and it wasn't too salty at all. They did use dark meat, which I'm less of a fan of, but I do think it's more authentic that way. The salad was just mixed greens (like a spring/mesclun mix) with some carrots. I asked for the dressing on the side and it came as requested. The dressing was slightly sweet and I enjoyed it. The vegetables were fresh. The rice was slightly sticky and well cooked. My husband did not ask for his salad dressing on the side and as a result felt that there was way too much dressing on it. His salad had 4 medium-sized shrimp, mangoes, cucumbers, carrots and tomatoes. They also sprinkled sesame seeds all over the salad. He said he enjoyed his salad. I did not have any.   Service was friendly. They refilled our waters without us having to ask. The place was well lit and looked clean. They also serve bubble teas and desserts, and some people were in just for that. A cute little restaurant serving Taiwanese food and drinks. Portions weren't that large, but for the price I was satisfied. The restaurant is on Sainte Catherine, near Atwater. Street parking only."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"My friend told me about this place and she insisted we try it out once. I was really impressed. Good service, clean location, great menu, prices more than decent, and the food is good. It reminds me a lot of mon chicha bistro near Concordia but more modern. It's a more instagram type looking place. The little elephant logo is super cute and the decor is very trendy. We visited quite late, around 9:30pm on a Tuesday night and they closed at 10pm, and we ordered right on time. I ordered the popcorn chicken, the brown sugar milk tea, and the sesame cucumber rolls. The rolls were really really good. I highly recommend them as an entree. The popcorn chicken was quite ordinary. The bubble tea came with no bubbles as they were out for the day and it tasted ok. I got ordinary sugar and ice but it still felt a bit bland. I'm going to try another drink next time and get it with bubbles.Overall, a great place. I'd definitely come back."

I was satisfied after having the latte and the cream puff. The cream puff is crispy on the outside and I liked the slight bitterness of the matcha cream. The heater under my seat kept me warm on this cold weather day. It feels so warm and cozy here!"
/user_details?userid=5vXMMeonwwLUv1sPkXzYHQ,Kaman S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"One of my favorite place for cakes, snack and bubble tea in Montreal. The staffs are very friendly. Relax decor. Highly recommend if you love authentic Taiwan bubble tea."
/user_details?userid=3J8OoQEBaFQx6Ooyu3UkgA,Joyce A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My friend and I decided to visit this new asian restaurant. We took time to navigate the whole menu since everything looks good. After few minutes, I decided to take Torikatsu in peanut butter while my friend took the tofu. It came with good amount of salad - btw I love the dressing on it. The dish was delicious. For the dessert we shared a slice of mille feuille matcha cake and it tasted heaven! I would like to try their cheezo teas on my next visit. All in all. Recommended to try!"

Also, there was actually only 1 ferro Rocher cut in half... My friend and i also had hot milk tea. Both were super sweet which didn't help."
/user_details?userid=JL2uB3BoQT6gvGWiMWK_6Q,Lily L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is one of my favourite spots for sweets! Their soft serve is delicious and their drinks are amazing! Although on the pricier side for bubble tea, the quality can defs be tasted! I recommend the taro milk w/ taro balls and the fresh strawberry matcha!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,They changed their menu and added new items such as matcha drinks and matcha ice cream. The matcha doesn't really taste like matcha and the ice cream is way too sweet. When you get charged 7.50$ for a soft serve you would expect something better...
/user_details?userid=YKm-0aMn46Yi0Re2lN1XRQ,Ivy L.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"Cute Taiwanese restaurant/cafe/dessert shop in a super convenient location! Very impressed by the variety of menu options and tried many of them.- Cakes: both the fruit cake/milles crêpes and the cheesecake were very good! You can tell that there are a lot of eggs in the milles crêpes which I like. The cheesecake didn't taste much like cheese to me and was more like just a fruit cake but it was a good fruit cake.- Fried mushrooms, popcorn chicken and yam fries: good sauce! The seasoning is not bad but still not as good as in Taiwan. Perfect amount of breading though.- Cream cheese drinks: the rose and osmanthus oolong options were very tasty, by the matcha one had no taste at all. They basically mixed matcha powder with water and added the cream cheese cap. The decor is super cute and clean. Service was ok and the price is on the higher end for the portions they gave. Would still come back to taste more cakes and appetizers."
/user_details?userid=MjqfukTWimz3D0w-cp5fDg,Kathy P.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Went back there again! This time to try their dessert! Tried the honey cake castle. It was pretty amazing! Make sure you're very hungry or be at least 4 people sharing it. The bread inside was very crunchy and when you eat it with the ice cream on the side, it just makes it perfect! Also tried their ceylon milk tea, like the tie guan ying oolong milk tea, very good! This will probably be my go to dessert/tea place now! For the desserts and drinks (still haven't tried their food), this restaurant deserves a 5 stars. Major problem is their washroom... as I was walking there was this bad smell along the hallway, I though it was the trash or whatsoever, but turns out its from the washrooms. The smell is so bad that it makes it difficult to actually just stay there... This could potentially lead to sanitary problems in the restaurant. Hopefully they'll fix that...Went there for take out for 2 drinks. It tasted bad. Didn't taste like tea at all... Also, had matcha powder chunk in my drink, even though it was just a Ceylon milk tea... was totally disappointed.Went there one evening and wanted to try their toast tower...and they said they dont have it today. Disappointed again!"
/user_details?userid=LP-8DbFrARGiEavU4BcI6Q,Sha Y.,"Brossard, Canada",3 star rating,"Cute little restaurant. Kudos to their marketing team, the only reason I decided to go was the appeal of the pics on social media (customers and business page).The drinks all look so good! Looking at the menu, I am no expert and not an avid bubble tea/tea lattes drinker, but it seemed more expensive than other places I've been to before.I was passing by and only ordered a matcha strawberry drink. I opted for half sugar and half ice. It's maybe where I went wrong.. the drink was bland. However, even with less sugar, I would expect the matcha taste to still come through..it didn't. I do like my matcha to be strong and regularly drink matcha so that could be why.They seem to serve all their drinks in plastic cups even for people actually eating/drinking there.I personally think they should be more ecologically conscious and serve their drinks in reusable cups.I don't work far from there so I would go there again ..and maybe try the cheesy foam drink which seems original and is everywhere on social media!"

Both were alright but pricier than I would have liked, but I know I was also paying for the space. It's nice and clean so it's a decent place to do some work."
/user_details?userid=VseHlPAVhHbNZqyl_zRKBQ,Stephanie C.,"Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Stumbled upon this place last week and decided to try it during date night with my bf. It has a very cute, simple and clean atmosphere to it. We decided to have our supper and dessert here, and it was worth it! We ordered the regular and the curry torikatsu (fried chicken cutlet) platters to start, which we got within a decent amount of time (15mins). They were both pretty good, having a good amount of seasoning and sauce without the chicken being soggy! The salad that came with it had a light but delicious dressing as well. Next, known for their desserts, we ordered a slice of their strawberry cake and their famous honey toast in matcha! Their desserts did not disappoint, the strawberry cake was delicious, light and not overly sweet! Their honey toast in matcha was not only visually pleasing, but tasted just as good as it looks! The toast was so soft inside while having a perfectly toasted crust, topped with matcha ice cream, kitkat and pocky. It can be a little heavy, so it's perfect to share with another person. Good food, delicious desserts, decent prices and friendly staff. I will definitely be coming back to try the rest of their menu!"

/user_details?userid=bds7VxgVm0e6Pu5RuVV-wg,Thea V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I came across this place on my way home. Of course I had to check it out! As I walked in, multiple servers greeted me warmly and I came to realize that it is the same place as ChiCha Restaurant located on Sherbrooke St O in Westmount. The place itself is beautiful, it has a very minimalist yet trendy vibe to it and it is decorated nicely.One of the ladies also mentioned that they also own Chicha Donburi on Bishop St.I was quite full at the time since I just had dinner but the desserts looked so damn good I had to get the strawberry cake and a matcha cream puff.I was pretty amazed by how they packed everything carefully. I love how they put a thick clear cake collar around the cake to prevent it from getting messy/falling apart. I also like their boxes, super cute!The strawberry cake itself was AMAZING!! The sponge cake looked quite dense but it was surprisingly light and buttery. The frosting had the perfect amount of sweetness and the strawberries were perfectly riped and fresh. The matcha cream puff was pretty good as well. I have already tried this in their other location so I was not expecting to be amazed once again but it was actually even better than before! The matcha cream filling was just perfectly sweet and chilled. I can't wait to try their other desserts, food and milk tea ! I will definitely come back and will gladly invite my friends as well. Thank you ChiCha!"

The strawberry cheesecake was also light and delicious though more like a fruit cake like another reviewer said. I'd still order it again. The dinner dishes were good but I prefer the beef bowl at the other Chicha on bishop. I'll be back often for their cakes and popcorn chicken!"
/user_details?userid=theKAKaqiAGsLhpSyXBtSQ,Triston J.,"Vancouver, Canada",2 star rating,"From the outside this place looks fun and inviting. The sign outside has a happy looking elephant dancing for god's sake... The moral of the story: Don't judge insides by their outsides. Staff was friendly enough, but only friendly enough. I ordered the Japanese curry. I love Japanese curry. It's the brown gooey goodness that gets me where I most need it when I most need it. Now, even though I consider myself a Japanese curry connessuer (how do you spell conesewer? Sometimes autocorrect just doesn't cut it. Always happens when I try to spell eccersize... excersize, exercise) I don't find that I have to expect that much extra in terms of quality from Japanese curry. Japanese curry basically always tastes the same, the only thing that differs is the amount and variety of the vegetables and the presentation. But this Japanese curry was SUB-PAR! Runny, mild, and confusing!"

It looks good and i was expected but it made me completely disappointed right at first bite.I got mango passion fruit Mille crepe: there is too much whipped cream, I don't even know there's crepe cake, felt nothing in my mouth, it was like I ate a bunch of only whipped cream. I like the whipped cream not too sweet but the flavour is bland in general, poor mango passion fruit flavour, I couldn't realize If i don't see the seeds on top. The worst cake.Strawberry cream puff cake: the cake outside is hard and dry, it's like an old croissant in the fridge, the whipped cream inside is not bad but a little bit bland with 2 thin strawberry slices. The only thing i like is that all the thing is not too sweet. But it was terrible, me and my friend looked at each other after trying cause it was not good at all. Before coming , I was extremely excited cause I really needed something sweet, but it dropped my mood and I wanted vomit."
