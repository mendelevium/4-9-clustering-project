First time trying Turkish brunch and will definitely come back again. Ordered the menemen sudjuk (scrambled eggs in a tomato & pepper dish, with homemade Turkish sausage) which came with fresh fruit and handmade bread. Orange juice is freshly squeezed. 10/10Prices good. And area is super cute to walk around after."
/user_details?userid=WMjtBdZqbUIa4pnnrQJ4WA,Anzor A.,"Ottawa, Canada",1 star rating,"NO for me. I wished it would be better.Even though it is now a ""corona time"",  the place is still working and even had some customers.The French waiter was really nice and helped me with menu.I have never even been to a worthless Turkish restaurant in the world. I am from Kyrgyzstan where Turkish food is greatly appreciated, so I am a master of it.The place did not serve a lot of dishes for takeout, but they managed to f-up my order. See the pics...They firstly served me the soup with a broken lid.Secondly, their lentil soup was very bitter and immediately started to burn my throat. That happens when a ""chef"" puts black pepper too early. Thirdly, their sausage mezza plate is ridiculous, for $23, it is just insane. The sausage was very old and tasted like an old rubber.AVOID this place if you want to spend it in a decent place."
/user_details?userid=cNYGGU79oQtR_xBSz6ZbvA,Ajara B.,"Sandy Hill, Ottawa, Canada",1 star rating,"So we decided to dine out and ordered the lentil soup, soudjuk and the chickpea with lamb. We were first going to order chicken or lamb but they told us they don't have takeout on main meals so we decided to just go with mezze (I think that's appetizer in turkish). The lentil soup was way too spicy for me and I had a heartburn after eating (which is not very common for me). The soudjuk was dry and not fresh and way too expensive ($10 for 5 cuts). The chickpea with lamb was too oily and very dull. The overall food was way worse than at average middle eastern restaurants 1/5.The service was ok although I should mention that the guy at the bar is either new or doesn't really know what is he doing (we've been to many middle eastern places and asked if they have zaatar and he had no clue what were we talking about). Overall, I should give 3/5 for service because he was friendly but wasn't very knowledgeable (for the prices they charge the place should have only professionals working there). About the prices tho - keep in mind that this place is much pricier than other middle eastern restaurants and the amount of food you get is like a bad joke. Overall, my experience at this place was 1/5 and that's exactly how much I rated it. Pro-tip: unless you have nothing else to spend on, avoid this place."
/user_details?userid=jpF5VxuG9moPTZzDfAPuSA,Tram L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I have no idea why I cannot add another review instead of having to write on top of my previous one in the same review :'( Nonetheless, I am here to say that since my two times brunching here, I have been back a few more times for dinner and lemme tell you something: DO IT!As usual, the staff is always helpful and friendly. Their wine list is pretty nice and the menu is great. Between the few times being here, I have tried almost everything on the menu and I liked them all!!! Make sure to go with more people so you can sample the list :) From lamb to chicken kebabs and mezze and soups, perfect seasoning, rich ewe yogurt and nutty sprinkles are so mouth-watering. Obviously, there's always room for desserts, right? At this point, I'm assuming you are going with a few people, so take all the desserts to share because they're yummy too. It's a hefty portion so don't be greedy and keep one to yourself :P--------------------------------------We were here today for brunch, after having put this place on my list to-try since a few months now. It is next to Lawrence where the line-up was too discouraging and selfishly I was glad to see that we were the 2nd table there because we were not in the mood to wait (although by the time we left, the terrace was full and the dining room was 1/3 filled)It's a cute spot with a flat bread station at the window in the front. There's a narrow terrace in the back. The staff was polite but seemed a bit lost at first but picked up quite fast. We had the Mediterranean (poached eggs on Bisi bread with yogurt or hollandaise sauce) & the Sujuk (baked eggs with homemade spicy beef sauages) served with fruit & potatoes. Both were delicious and the potato was really yummy. The brioche-like bread was too dense for our taste.I would definitely come bk to try the other dis"
/user_details?userid=za-_E0w58gRS2_9mHicmkQ,Li S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I gave the restaurant a 4/5. The evening started a little rocky. When they took down the reservation they put the wrong time in the computer. After a few tense minutes, the owner was able to clear a table for us. That said, the rest of the evening was a success. They have a great selection of mezzes and I recommended trying a few of them, especially the muhamara  . I had the main Turkish dishes and my family had kebabs. The main dish was a great success with mince lamb and eggplant. Never had anything like it! Original, authentic and very light. I would skip on the kebabs, they're good but not worth price and the sides seem like an afterthought. The dessert are also original and very executed. Overall I would recommend this resto. Less fine dining and more family style restaurant! Ps wine list can be reconsidered...."
/user_details?userid=vj-gGhmf8zw4FJiJ4oWGjQ,Beantpreet K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,This is probably my favourite middle eastern brunch place. They do other meals too like lunch and dinner which I have yet to try. They do refills of Turkish tea - yaas! Unlike coffee refills at other brunch places. The tea is really good. I had the shakshuka and the cheese spinach bread which was made fresh! They make their bread in house. The shakshuka was amazing. It was with eggplant and not tomatoey. Just perfect blend of all flavours. I am definitely bringing my friends here. I had been in constant search for a middle eastern brunch restaurant so was really happy when I came across this. Can't wait to try their dinner menu. Oh and the service was great! They were so warm and welcoming - had a homely feeling.
/user_details?userid=wIJp8L03Zd-INlBWcPJ2ew,Maryam S.,"Riverdale, Riverdale Park, MD",5 star rating,"My husband and I stumbled upon this place by accident and boy were we surprised. We had their brunch on Saturday and it was AMAZING!! We ordered one egg dish (with the Turkish sausage), one sweet dish (the brioche walnut bread with molasses), and a starter (cream and honey) with the homemade fresh bread. The cream and honey is probably the best I have ever had (coming from a eastern background I have tried many kinds of Ishtar/qaimag). I was blown away by the brioche with walnuts. It was perfectly sweetened and the flavors were out of this world. You have to try this dish! I am definitely bringing my family and friends here."
/user_details?userid=tq4kMPmkA9ay0VNOtoxtDA,Charlene M.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"Double YES for Mirazu ! This restaurant was such a great surprise, everything was so good! When you go for lunch, there is an excellent lentils soup included in your meal, as well as coffee or cay. We had the privilege to try breakfast platter that is serve for brunch, but the chef made an exception for us (huge kuddo for that!!) : this platter includes honey (the best I had so far, you have to try it spread on the bread they give you all along your meal, with the cheese) - cheese, black olives, an egg and tomato casserole, casserole and beef slices. The other highlight of my visit was the Mirazu Pafik with feta and spinach (which is a hand-rolled dough, cooked over a griddle, served with a fresh salad of tomatoes, cucumbers and fruits). You can see the Pafik being made from the beginning until the end. Then we also tried the Hungar Begendi: Lamb leg chunks braised with pepper, onions, tomato, served in a bed of smoked eggplant puree with béchamel sauce and walnuts. Of course i can't forget the turkish tea, served to us again and again. Service was on point, the food was delicious, flavorful, tasty..I recommend this place 300%, can't wait to go back!!"
/user_details?userid=4iENzVcO6p0zc-zeFtTI7A,Andre F.,"Sainte-Foy-Sillery-Cap-Rouge, Quebec City, Canada",5 star rating,"Very good food, excellent service and a very personal atmosphere. We were really and agreeably surprised by the excellent taste versus value. The staff is friendly including the cook who peeks around every now and then to make certain that all is well. A definite place to try and if you're not an expert in Turkish cuisine, the staff will guide you through as we've seen them do to new comers."

I am generally a bit spicy food kind person but the rear of my group loved it. No complaints at all. Good atmosphere, decor and service."
/user_details?userid=GbDfPbqp7gKRwbn116KDSA,Ben K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"After reading the eater.com listing of new openings, I was definitely curious to check out this new restaurant, nestled beside a stalwart of St-Laurent, Lawrence. I came with my girlfriend, and order a combination of three mezzes, the muhamarra, eggplant salad, and hummus, as well as the Incik leg of lamb. All of the dishes really shined; the hummus was smooth and light, easy on the lemon juice and tahini. Muhamarra featured a nice amount of heat, as well as an interesting twist with a substantial portion of tomato paste, a departure from the recipe I use. The eggplant salad featured a nice amount of smokiness, topped with pomegranate. All three and very much recommended. The leg of lamb came with a side of bulgar. The meat was expertly braised, the sauce of yogurt and butter surprisingly delicate.All this being said, there are shortcomings and things that still need to be worked out. The pita was very stale, in spite of them reserving a front corner of their dining room to a ""bread station"". One would expect that in doing so, they would be boasting of its freshness: it was sadly not the case. They merely used it to warm the bread (barely), and it paled in comparison with the bread on offer at Antep Kebab. The patio was overwhelmed with the smell of charcoal coming from their own kitchen, which makes it completely unusable, as well as a not very comfortable decor. We elected to sit at a bench in an inside corner, which strangely enough was quite a bit deeper than the other benches which was not very comfortable. The menu is short of descriptions, and vegetables.All this being said, I would definitely return to try their grilled meats. I really hope they can iron out these details, because their offerings are generally very interesting and inspired, and it would be sad to see them go the way of so many defunct establishments on St-Laurent."

It was quit popular and we had to wait quit a while for the table. Both dishes me and my husband ordered were good, but what he had was more unique, the yogurt spice was very tasty"
/user_details?userid=Et6YLMrlyX2PCkqtwSVAug,Sabeena S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I went to Mirazu in February with a large group of friends to celebrate our buddy's impending travels to Italy. We made a reservation at Mirazu perhaps the day before and they were able to accommodate our large and ever-growing group. Our glasses remained filled with water, and our waiter (there were perhaps 2 taking care of everyone in the restaurant) was very sweet and attentive. He suggested many excellent dishes and we ended up getting 2-3 mixed grilled platters which were definitely the favorites of the evening. The meat (especially the lamb) is some of the best in the entire city! I highly recommend this white table cloth restaurant to anybody who wants a lovely dining experience."

Our server could not have been more accommodating and welcoming. He was so friendly and willing to assist us with anything we needed. The restaurant itself is fresh and clean. I had the humus à l'agneau. The homemade hummus was tasty, and the lamb melted in your mouth. I would go back here over and over!"

/user_details?userid=nBotK5rAhsUCkBKhzShKXA,Melis B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,I really really want to love you Mirazu! I'm Turkish and really need a solid Turkish place to eat. First: Please don't put rice on your menu if you are not going to serve it but FYI what Turkish restaurant doesn't have rice ? So I suggest you serve it. Second : Turkish brunch is a very very amazing ordeal... please keep it that way your menemen is good but make sure your pogacas are made and baked the day off! We need good Turkish food in our lives!

Gurme : Full of flavour!! Lamb with 2 x poached eggs with yogurt sauce,  aromatic potatoes and fruit. Fresh Bread roll on the side with a hot tea. What a way to start the day!!!"

The ambiance is cosy and the staff is very friendly. I will try to go back to try their evening menu as well."
/user_details?userid=uhPC8wloWti90f3yMGDwCA,W M.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Mirazu is unassuming on the outside, but take a step inside and the feeling changes. It is inviting and comfortable inside and the service is excellent - welcoming and attentive. Having visited Turkey a few times, I can say that the food at Mirazu is the real thing! I particularly enjoy the cold mezzes and the gozleme - thin, flattened bread, freshly made, filled with feta and spinach (other types available). This is a true gem. I couldn't recommend it more highly."
