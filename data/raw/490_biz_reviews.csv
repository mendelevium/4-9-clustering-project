/user_details?userid=NilrQC1Lq7t2O1u_54sINQ,Audrey L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"A thousand percent my favourite coffee shop in the area. Great, great coffee from a variety of roasters, including local, a very cool machine & a chill vibe. Nowhere to sit inside post covid, but a park across the street to enjoy your coffee if you've got the time."
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Café/ Bar in Saint Henri area and nearby some amazing restaurants. It's a small but adorable. It also has a terrace part. Service is good. We just went for a caffeinated beverage. Since it's super hot; we a cold brew and iced cappuccino. Both delicious. Slightly overpriced but the place runs quality products.
/user_details?userid=Mt-_SvJyDirR9fpZx9dbEw,Tommy S.,"Bellevue, WA",5 star rating,"We came here to have some coffee while in queue for brunch across the street at Arthurs Nosh Bar which, by the way, I do not recommend (you can read my original and updated reviews on Yelp). When we entered, it felt like we escaped the cold winter weather and took refuge here, a peaceful place safe from danger.The menu prices are inclusive of taxes which I always appreciate. We ordered a latte and an espresso, which was brought to our table by a friendly and hip looking barista. Overall, I would recommend Cordova to anyone who enjoys a good cup of java."
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",5 star rating,"I was in the area for work over the last two weeks and each morning I found myself at Cordova for their coffee because it was excellent ! My favourite is their cappuccino with almond milk , silky smooth with great coffee flavour ,AND they make their own almond milk ! Prices are fair as well. The staff is always so friendly and welcoming and make you feel at home , exceptional customer service. The location isn't huge but there is space for seating with very pretty yet cozy decor and great atmosphere (always good music in the background as well !).  I also went by with a friend and we tried their Madeline's ... beyond perfect ! (Not overly sweet perfect fluffy texture and such nice subtle flavour).  I have yet to go there for their food and cocktails but Ive heard such rave reviews that i'll make a point to give them a try ! Great little place in st -Henri I highly recommend it :)"
/user_details?userid=0sai8s_t-a_kVQwJPAInlA,Lora L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,Atmosphere:It had a cosy and calm vibe for sitting down for a coffee or small bite. Beautiful table tops covered with tiles. I was able to get some work done on my laptop. There was free wifi yet there are no plugs so to charge devices there. Staff: The girl who served me coffee was super sweet!Coffee and food:I had two cups of coffee and a sandwich to-go. The coffee was good and the sandwich was yummy.

/user_details?userid=C5XL8cRxfw-93xNDlewttw,A N.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"When this place opened, I was too excited -- it's cute and right next to my place, it seemed perfect.  Yet ... I have tried their coffee upwards of six times now, and each time I've found it to be sharp enough on the tongue to be undrinkable past the first half. Also unhelpful towards their likeability factor is the fact that this cafe seems wildly out of place for the neighborhood. Incredibly trendy with a menu that seems built more for Air BnB tourists than the average person from St. Hen.  Just get a latte at Rustique or a cocktail at Cho, honestly, and save yourself the performance. Great if you need to show your instagram friends that you like to drink coffee. Great if you need to work on some laptop business while visiting the city. Not great if you just want a nice cup of coffee and an inconspicuous morning/ whenever. Also really, really, really not great if you're hungry. Two stars for decent decor and usually-attentive baristas. Then I subtracted one star because two was too generous."
/user_details?userid=0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,Cindy Feng Xin L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It is a new cafe right across Arthur Nosh Bar, located in St-Henri and on Notre-Dame street. The interior decor of the café is really nice, with the lining of green plants next to the window and marble tables with little vases of flower, the counter is also really nice and neat. Cordova is a Spanish-style cafe and bar (when they will get their alcohol license), so they serve a variety of food that is inspired from Spanish cuisine or imported from Spain. We tried several exotic tapas style dishes, including Jamon Serrano, Chorizo Iberico Bellota, tomato bread, Hof Kelstein bread with parsley butter and soft boiled egg and anchovies. The Chorizo was the best of our choices, but the other ones are also very unique and flavourful. If you want to try some food out of the ordinary, come to Cordova and taste a few dishes of their menu, you will be happily surprised!"

Don't skip out on the Serrano and Iberico croissant - it's  delicious!"
/user_details?userid=wgmK-N5Qg5I7iDSKn1DH1g,Jonah N.,"Spring Valley, CA",5 star rating,"First day in Montreal, and the staff was super helpful. The guy with the stash is a G and gave me directions on how to get to where I needed to go. A more posh cafe, the place itself is pretty contemporary, and the drinks they serve there are good. The cold brew isn't too strong like some other places, and the food there is right on. Definitely would recommend this place if you want to study, chill, or relax with some friends."
/user_details?userid=jr7ID8syLVRaMhDJt3iwAQ,Gad E.,"Calgary, Canada",5 star rating,"Love this place. Great coffee and cocktails. Turns from coffee shop during the day to cocktail bar at night. Great staff, always welcoming and helpful. Very fun vibe. A St-Henri gem!"
/user_details?userid=L_fb4BjFwjh5Zeud4HPJyA,Catherine H.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"A hidden gem... for now...This place seems to be a cafe by day and cocktail bar by night. We went for drinks on a Saturday night and the atmosphere was great. Music was perfect and not too loud to chat. This is a true cocktail bar with a wide selection of really unique and delicious drinks, NOT the sugary watered down nonsense like many overpriced bars. The food selection was small but of great quality. We shared the 3 cheese plate and the tomato bread, very tasty and portions were perfect. The waitress was knowledgable of the menu and gave good pointers. Would definitely recommend!"

/user_details?userid=WUtqdPgbUl2mfXLYasEIyQ,Ali L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I would rate the coffee bar side as a 4. When Cordova transitions to a cocktail bar I find it disappointing. Living nearby, we've been here 3 or 4 times, and found the cocktails to be average (mocktails especially would have benefitted from being properly mixed). The wine list is minimalist, and that's fine. The tomato bread, ham and conservas are a definite standout. On most of our visits, we had indifferent service - long wait times before being asked to place an order, no acknowledgment when waiting at the bar for a long time, waiting a long time to get the bill (or never receiving it) etc. It seems dependent on who is there, because we've also had quite normal and friendly service. Recently we even witnessed a condescending and belligerent ""debate"" on cocktails between the owner (just guessing based on her comments) and one of the customers. It was awkward, and we'll just grab a drink elsewhere next time!"
