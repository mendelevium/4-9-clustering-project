The concept of the restaurant is all in 2D drawing which is pretty cool and Instagram worthy.As for the chicken, I ordered the Spicy Bao. The buns were very fluffy like a pillow soft bread. The fried chicken pieces were very big! It was tender and juicy! However the level of spice was wayyyyyy to high for my liking. I usually can take the heat but this was just a little too much. The sandwich is a great snack for 2 or good meal for 1! Overall, I really enjoyed the bao, next time I will be trying the mayo version instead!"
