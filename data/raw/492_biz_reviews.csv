I was wiser in my revision, this time we ordered Nutella and strawberries! It was divine! I did not know I've cream was included which made it even sweeter! Bill came to $16 before tip, very reasonable for old Montreal! Their patio was packed with safety measures in place because of covid! I will definitely frequent this place!"
/user_details?userid=1kNsEAhGU8d8xugMuXJGFA,Calvin S.,"Winnipeg, Canada",3 star rating,"+.5 for serviceIt was a snowy morning when my family came here for breakfast during the holidays. My parents have been here before and highly recommend the French Onion Soup. Since we came for breakfast, I also ordered a crepe and shared a fondue with my parents.I had La Spéciale Delice crepe, which consisted of scrambled eggs, bacon, ham, cheese, and mushrooms. In addition to the French Onion Soup, I shared the Swiss Fondue with my parents. The soup was excellent, definitely one of the best I had. The crepe was decent but not the best I've had. Definitely one of the sweeter ones I've had if that's what you like. The fondue, however, didn't taste right. While I was expecting swiss cheese, it tasted nothing like it and when I asked a server, he said it was gruyere cheese. Never had it before, but if that was what it usually tastes like, I'll pass for next time.Service was excellent despite how busy the place was. I'll stick with the soup and crepe, but maybe pass on the swiss fondue next time."
/user_details?userid=xZz56LNb1L1HUt2qb7rRBA,Roseanne N.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This restaurant sits right in the heart of Old Montreal. They have an expansive menu offering all sorts of crepes, from savoury to sweet, as a wide selection of sandwiches, desserts, and fondue!I came here to try out their crepes. In addition to this, we also ordered a fondue set to accompany our meal. The list of items we ordered are: - Escargots in Garlic Butter Sauce - Montrealaise Crepe- Chicken Supreme Crepe- Swiss Fondue with White Wine and KirshI loved the snails. The garlic butter sauce gives it a pleasant aroma. The texture is snappy, and not chewy. Our crepes, which were ladled with a creamy bechamel sauce finally arrived. The Montrealaise crepe is stuffed with ham and swiss cheese. This combination is simple, yet very delicious. There was a hint of sweetness from the crepe, but otherwise, it was overall a creamy and savoury crepe. The chicken supreme crepe was filled with juicy and tender chicken, mushrooms and a parmesan bechamel sauce. This combination also worked out very well. I liked the soft bites of chicken with the savoury mushrooms. I liked the common theme of simplicity in their crepes. With respect to the swiss fondue, I had very opposing views for this dish. The taste of wine was too strong for me. The bread they served it with was also stale and cold. It wasn't the best experience trying fondue for the first time. I found the fondue to be a bit too salty and almost bitter at times. The winey aftertaste is something that was hard for me to swallow. I probably will try a different flavoured fondue base next time. On the bright side, the apples they served us paired quite well with the fondue! I never knew fruits and cheese could go so well with each other."

This is a story with a happy ending of the latter situation.We were roped in with enticing pictures and promises of crepes and fondue. We fell in love with their warm (spiced and spiked) ciders and fanfkingtastic french onion soups. We stuffed ourselves with way too much cheese, and just when we thought we could not take any more... we voluntarily did further damage with fruits & marshmallows dipped in gooey chocolate. Everyone left this place many pounds heavier, but many memories fuller. Also this place is 3 stories huge (top is the best) and the staff is just so super awesome."

We were seated on the top story and had a nice view of the street.Lots of crepes to choose from. Portion sizes were large. You could easily split a crepe between two people. Tried the shrimp crepe with lobster sauce, the Neptune crepe, and la symphonie sweet crepe. The shrimp crepe was a bit plain, even with the lobster sauce, and needed more salt or lemon. La symphonie sweet crepe was simple and enjoyable with the fruit, powdered sugar, and maple syrup. However, the best crepe that I would order again would be the Neptune crepe, which had a lot of umami flavor going on with the shrimp, lobster, scallop, mushrooms, lobster sauce, and cheese. Waiter service was adequate. Could've been better with clearing plates and changing out the utensils between savory and dessert crepes, but it was nice that they were able to split the check with our large group and they did refill our waters and keep track of our orders for our group of twenty people or so. Overall, enjoyable experience. If you're looking for a creperie in Old Montreal, I recommend checking this place out."
/user_details?userid=U7RCnO4Y_SbuKLsFvwTIww,Jennifer A.,"Lincoln Park, NJ",3 star rating,"Chez Suzette is located in Old Montreal, on a super cute street. If the weather allows for it, give yourself the time to wander around. Its really in a nice location. We came here based off a recommendation for the french onion soup. My husband and I really stopped by for some light eating, so went with a french onion soup, a corn chowder (I think that's what it was, it was a special) and the escargot.  The french onion soup was good but I was not blown away by it like I thought I was going to be. Maybe I set my expectations too high but I have had just as good french onion, if not better, back home. The broth of the soup was really good but still did not find it to be anything out of this world good. My husband enjoyed the corn chowder and I tasted it too. It had a smokey flavor, which we both like and it was super creamy. Our favorite take away from our visit to Chez Suzette was the escargot. It came prepared in an garlic butter sauce and this was both of our first times trying escargot and we LOVED it. So yummy, prepared so well and truly was enjoyable. The service here was bad, slow, we felt forgotten about and really had to hunt down the waiter for anything we needed, including the check. Maybe give this spot a try, maybe don't give it a try, I can go either way honestly. But if you do come, try the escargot."

I always get a Nutella crepe with whipped cream and ice cream. The crepes here was so good and such a great portion unbelievably I couldn't even finish all 4.

It was hard to even pick one to order!We came for dessert and luckily we had no wait to sit and were escorted upstairs. We went with the bananas and nutella crepes because that is a winning combination and it also included ice cream and whipped cream. It was delicious and sweet, but also a massive portion, so sharing one of these is a must. The coffee was also strong and paired great with the crepes, and the service was great. Honestly, after coming here I wish I had gotten a savory crepe too and maybe the fondue, but alas, there is only so much one can order at one occasion. I sort of stumbled upon this place without previously looking it up, and I was definitely pleasantly surprised."

It was my one and only crepe restaurant visit in Montreal and so I went with the ultimate crepe. It was totally loaded with seafood - expensive but worth it! It had giant shrimps, scallops, and quite a bit of lobster, baked with cheese. I frickin love seafood, and the crepe did not disappoint - the portion of seafood inside the crepe was piping hot, generous, and juicy! I also ordered a fancy boozy coffee - it was ok but not as boozy or strong as I would have preferred!Service and ambiance was great. We were on the main floor, right at the window with an adorable curtain. As the snow fell in old Montreal, it felt warm and cozy inside! Awesome place to try a crepe!"

We stepped into the seemingly small restaurant and expected to wait for a table as most were already full. Little did we know, there are 2 other floors with lots of tables to choose from. The top floor was the sunniest, so we opted for a spot near the window.I ordered the ham and swiss crepe and my boyfriend had the chicken supreme. My crepe was average; there was lots of cheese but some of the ham got so hard that I couldn't eat it and there wasn't much flavour to the crepe. My boyfriend was happy with his choice, there was lots of filling and all the flavours went really well together.I'd come back to Chez Suzette - but would order something different from the menu."

We ordered the Neptune - it came with a variety of seafood topped with a lobster sauce and cheese - and escargots. Those escargots hit the spot! I loved the garlic butter it was drenched in. The crepe was good but could've been better I just added the garlic oil on it for more flavor. I would come back but maybe order different crepes next time, maybe a sweet one!"

They literally have all types you can think of - savoury or sweet, or both. This spot is very casual and great for a quick bite. We ended up visiting this place a couple of times when we visited Montreal a couple of weeks ago.Food came out pretty fast and the quality was pretty consistent. My boyfriend ended up getting the Nutella crepes both times. You get 4 crepes for $10! Super fresh, thin crepes, loaded with Nutella. For both times, I opted for a savoury crepe (forgot the name) with ham, swiss cheese and bechamel sauce. Loved the bechamel and the crepe was nice and warm. I also ordered the onion soup but was quite a letdown - super thin, flavourless, and the bread was quite burnt and gave the soup an undesirable taste.Service was pretty subpar for both visits, but the cheap, fresh and delicious crepes made up for it."

I started off with the Florentine as the main course. It was tasty but not ""amazing"" or ""wow."" However, it was satisfying as a meal. For dessert I had the Nutella with Strawberries Crepe. You can never go wrong with a dessert crepe. The crepe was airy, warm and paired perfectly with Nutella, berries, and ice cream. The staff were wonderful to speak with and our table was clean. The restaurant has two floors so it was large enough to satisfy the incoming customers. There was no wait at all. It's not the most amazing place for a crepe, however if I lived close by, it's worth stopping by."

But we did look for awhile!The location is located on a cute street that looks most like Europe compared to all the other streets of Old Montréal so be sure to check it out! There are  a lot of other shops and dining spots on this street as well. There were plenty of choices for crêpes, both of savory and sweet kind. We went for lunch so we wanted a savory crêpe. In the end, we decided to go with the Mediterranean crêpe with came with ratatouille filling (veggies with a tomatoe base sauce) and chicken. At first I was hesitant to split one because the crêpes back at home are pretty thin but once our food came to our table I felt much better! The crêpes here are very large. Plenty of food for 2 people to share unless you are starving or you want to eat a heavy meal. For us, it was the perfect amount of food for a light lunch.We will definitely be back to try their sweet crêpes!"

There are only two options to why there are good reviews on the fondue. One: the cooks are inconsistent.Two: the yelp moms are crazy. I've never had fondue before so I don't know what's it suppose to be like. All I know is that I don't like it. The wine in the cheese was so strong it made everything bitter. I've never had alcohol before but I've gotta say it doesn't taste good and probably not good for children. The cheese wasn't hot enough so it didn't really stick. The bread was cold  and didn't taste fresh.The veggie plate was all raw which just felt weird to eat with cheese. Not sure if it's suppose to be like that. It was really gross to me. Even my parents though the alcohol was way to strong. I ended up just eating the grapes and the apples which were good.But, I did like the onion soup. it was sweet but not too sweet. Also I've never had escargot, so once again don't know what it's suppose to be like, but I liked it. Very buttery :)The quiche was average but, not pretty so I didn't take a photo of it. Basically looked like scrambled eggs in a square with a pile of lettuce next to it. I make much better and I'm 16.Listen to the real expert. Someone who has never had fondue in there life.Fondue?

I have continued to go here once a year or so when I am in Montreal and Chez Suzette has slowly gone downhill, culminating in the most recent disaster. Service has gotten unacceptably slower last few visits. Perhaps this is because the last three times my party has been seated upstairs (which I never knew existed) and you might as well be in Siberia with the remoteness from attentive staff and lack of atmosphere. However this last weekend was the worst and we will not be coming back. In short, we were seated. Took ten minutes for a waiter to come by and offer coffee.  Another ten minutes to come back to take our order.  And then...we waited.  Nothing. Except all the people around us including some who came in 30 minutes after us were eating. But for us, NOTHING. After half an hour we flagged down the waiter for more coffee.  Ten minutes later (close to an hour of you do the math) still no crepe.  This is crepes folks, breakfast, should not take this long, right? After being told ""three more minutes"" and waiting five we got up and left. Offered to lay for our coffee and the waiter actually started to ring it up when my wife said  ""the coffee wasn't even. That good"" then he stopped and said we could go. Such a disappointment. There are other fine, similar, but better establishments on the same block. We will not be returning after 10 or so visits over six years. They hardly even cared. Tourist trap. Good news is we walked to the Old Port and had fabulous bacon and sausage poutine for breakfast!"

The first time I came to this restaurant, it was a quiet morning and we were seated at a corner table by a window which was very cute and had a nice view of Rue St. Paul (pictured). I ordered a cappuccino which was good, and the La Campagnarde which was filled with Brie cheese, ham, and caramelized onions with a side of maple syrup (pictured). I was in HEAVEN and didn't want it to end! The second visit was a busy Saturday afternoon and we were seated upstairs. The atmosphere was definitely different and transformed from a quiet cafe to a busy restaurant. I wish I tried one of the many other crepes on the menu, but I ordered the La Campagnarde again and didn't regret it!

I stumbled across this place on yelp, and it seemed like it had quite good reviews.We headed over to the restaurant and discovered that this place was very much a tourist hot spot and was located and decorated as such. The building of the restaurant is quite nice and historic and they have 3 floors with a nice view. We ordered the traditional Swiss cheese fondue and the montrealise crepe. The food arrived soon enough.The fondue came in a little ikea bucket and with a side of olive bread, green apples and purple grapes. The fondue was very disappointing. Way too much wine, and so it overpowered the flavor of the cheese itself. The apple and grapes in the cheese was surprisingly good with the cheese, but my friend and I found it difficult to eat the bread because of the winey cheese.The crepe was passable. Nothing special here.If you are looking for a more authentic or representative Montreal dinner experience, definitely go somewhere else."

However, I did not enjoy the coffee bowls as much as it tasted really thin and slightly burnt. Michel our server was great! Really friendly and efficient."

Thanks to Yelp, we found out we were just a half mile from Chez Suzette! The friendly staff escorted us up to the 3rd floor dining room where we had a great view of the street below. Thankfully, we walked all morning and didn't feel terribly about indulging in the lobster bisque and French onion soup. Three of us had the Swiss fondue while one in our party went with a ratatouille crepe. The food was deliciously rich and cheesy and paired well with reasonably priced wine. It was a very enjoyable leisurely lunch!"

I was a bit hesitant when I saw the reviews, but I'm so glad I went!I came here in the morning during a stroll around Old Montreal. It was still early, so no crowd yet. We were seated right away at a cute corner table in the window with a view of Rue St Paul. They have a pretty big menu, but from my friend's recommendation I went straight for the crepe section. I ordered the La Campagnarde which is a savory crepe filled with ham, brie cheese, and caramelized onions. It's served with maple syrup, which you definitely want to drizzle on top. It was one of the most amazing breakfasts I've had. I still daydream about it.. I also ordered the cappuccino which really woke me up. Just to warn you, the large is LARGE. They are not joking when they call it a bowl of coffee, because it is so much that they serve it in a bowl. It was actually fun to drink and tasted great, but I couldn't finish mine since it was too big.Very friendly staff and quick service, which is good if you have a lot to see/do during your day like we did.If I had more time in the area I would've returned for another crepe during my stay. Not sure about their other menu items, but the crepes were delicious. Highly recommend it!"

We were expecting quality service, a fun environment, and tasty food- we were not disappointed.Ambiance- Chez Suzette is located in the heart of an extremely busy area- the restaurant has multiple floors and can seat ALOT of people. It is a busy restaurant because of the busy area- a great feeling if you enjoy exciting night life. Service- very good! Quick to be seated- server came to us right away, and the food came out promptly. There was a point where our server accidentally knocked over an empty bottle in front of me, which startled me, but he felt so bad he gave me a complimentary beer! Great guy!Food- delicious! We ordered a medley of appetizers and our own entrees- we were not disappointed- food tasted fresh and made with care- my French onion soup was on the money! I ordered a chicken crepe- which was tender and juicy while the crepe was light and fluffy. My highlight of dinner was my white chocolate banana split milk shake.... it was so good I didn't even have a chance to take a picture! I just devoured it!Bathroom- yes very cleanStreet parking- don't even think about it!

It is difficult enough to navigate this area with a child in a wheelchair and this restaurant seemed like they would have preferred to tell us they couldn't accommodate us. First they offered us a table upstairs (there are no elevators in this area). Then they shoved the 5 of us at a table for 4 and brought over 4 waters. They told my 5 year old to sit at the end so he wouldn't block the area as much as the rest of us. Unfortunately we didn't get to try any of the food and most certainly won't attempt it again. Thanks for making our lives even more difficult than they already are.

The broth fondue was good too! It looked very plain when it was served -- with a plate of meats and a plate of typical vegetables (mushrooms, broccoli, etc), but the actual beef broth was mouthlickingly delicious! So unassuming, yet so yummy.They also have a few affordable wines, which go well with the delicious meal. Service is a bit sparse (well, not quite saccharin like south of the border anyway), but it's sufficient, and in line with other places around here, if only a little bit slow."

/user_details?userid=VNLosSyYqE4a4Ut_2DnMtQ,Alexandra G.,"Arlington, VA",3 star rating,"The crepes for dessert were really good. The service on a Saturday night was surprisingly efficient given that our waiter had way too many tables. The meat fondue was more than adequate. But the big disappointments - the wine list sucks (8 or 10 choices each for red and white and totally generic - think 7-11 wine choices) and most of all, don't try to pass off the fondue as gruyere! Maybe there is some in the mix... but it is mostly white cheddar or something equally mediocre. I am Swiss - I would never, ever order a cheddar fondue. If that is what you are going to serve, fine - but be honest about it so that those of us who know something about what a real gruyere fondue tastes like can chose something different rather than be disappointed. Not to mention that we had to send both (we were 4 adults so ordered 2) back at first because they were barely warm, let alone hot like fondue should be. And, the bread was weirdly cold. On the flip side, the chocolate fondue was a hit, especially with the pre-teens in our group."

I selected the Délicieuse, $14, which was loaded with bananas, topped with sliced almonds and a toffee cream sauce, with ice cream on the side. Good balance of flavours and crêpe-to-accompaniments ratio. The crêpe itself was the perfect thickness.The Café Viennois (Viennese coffee) was satisfactory while the Chocolat Chaud was rich and above average. Both were $5.The décor is outdated and I can understand the lukewarm reviews. Although I wouldn't specifically come here, this quaint little café is a nice option to pop into when walking around Old Montréal."

Yeah, this place has decent food for higher than average prices, but it makes up for it with comfortable outdoor seating, or multiple levels inside with nice cool AC for those muggy Montreal summers. Ordered a bottle of San Pellegrino with lemon for the glasses and we enjoyed a lunch of savory crepes - specifically the spinach, ham and brie filled one and a brie with caramelized onion sandwich. The sandwich came with a nice little side salad. Everything was tasty. Service was friendly, but leisurely which is fine when you are vacation. I wouldn't recommend this place as a destination, but if you are in the area looking to people watch with your meal this place fits the bill nicely directly on Rue Saint-Paul Est."

The reason is very simple: they pre-cook all their crepes in the morning and then they microwave them before serving, the result is a disaster. The crepe is not fresh of course, the texture is terrible, hot in some spots and cold in others. Becuase it is cooked hours before and microwaved the ingredients inside the crepe fight with each other.  We give them 5 stars for honesty: when asked they admitted that they pre-cook their crepes. We know crepes and this is absolutely NOT how a crepe is supposed to be enjoyed. Definitely a tourist trap because of its lovely location in the heart of Old Montreal."

Strange.Our food was decent, I had the club sandwich and upgraded to a Caesar salad for $1.50. The salad was great, the sandwich was OK, but the bacon wasn't crispy and I think the chicken was the canned type. The bread was toasted so much that it actually hurt my mouth when I bit into it.

It was 3 minute walk from Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours Chapel, the oldest Church in Old Montreal. Since I was craving for crepes, my husband and I decided to try this restaurant after we visited that church. The restaurant was not fancy and the furniture was old-fashioned. Since we were Asians, the servers did not put a lot of attentions to us (we had an impression that the servers didn't like Asians since they just spend time talking to either locals or Caucasians.) We ordered a Crepe Suzette (crepe served with a delicious orange sauce, Grand Marnier and Cognac), a French onion soup and a mocha. We were surprised the portion was very big in terms of the money we spent. That was probably the best crepe we have ever tried. I am always afraid of food with strong orange scent (since it reminds me of the smell of garbage chute for some reason), but here, the crepe was just perfect, you can taste the hint of orange flavor but it won't be too over. The crepes are very crispy, thin and chewy. The French Onion soup was full of cheese and hearty. The mocha works perfectly with the crepes. Aside from the service we had here, everything else was perfect! We will definitely come back to visit Chez Suzette! :)"

We were checking out old Montreal and we were starving. Chez Suzette looked like the best option for crepes so we stopped by for brunch. They have 3 stories of seating. The hostess was not helpful at all when I told her we would like a table with a view. She sat us in the middle and we had to ask someone else to move to the table by the window. The view from our table was pretty nice. It took forever for our waiter to show up which was too bad because I was thirsty and just wanted water. The price of a simple crepe was off-putting so we got one to share. What stood out to us was the smores crepe. We asked the waiter if we could get it with bananas rather than marshmallows as we were allergic. He said no problem. Not once did he say that there would be a charge to substitute. Our smores crepe was tasty but very small for the high price they charged. When we got our bill we were outraged to see it cost over $20. Are you kidding me?! For a stingy crepe! What made me very mad was they charged us $2 for a few slices of bananas. We asked the waiter and he said there is nothing he can do about it. The crepe was good but no way worth the price. We wanted to try the fondue but it did not look like it would be worth the cost. Next time we will save our calories and go to the much superior cacao 70.

The soup is nice and has a sweet and rich flavour (what can go wrong with a French onion soup?) Personally, I like the fondue! My friend think the wine flavour is a bit strong and bitter, so maybe a little bit less wine flavour would be nicer? The waitress even asked us if we wants more bread!

The Cesar salad, unfit for an emperor, was sadly the best course of an otherwise ghastly meal.

A perfectly sized 1/4 inch slice of sourdough baguette adorns the surface blanketed by a rich creamy Swiss cheese. My favourite note of this soup is that it is not overloaded by onions and bread.

Apart from being linguistically accommodating, he was extremely friendly and eager to please.The lobster cognac bisque was rich and heavenly (see photos). It was creamy and full of flavor. The cognac was subtle and not overpowering. I don't know if I could eat a whole bowl of it; fortunately, my friends and I shared much of our food.I split a savory crêpe and a dessert crêpe with my friend. Our savory shrimp crêpe was divine. A rich sauce countered the sweet shrimp within. The sauce was even better with bits of lobster throughout. I would definitely get this again.Our dessert crêpe (see photo) was disappointing, not because it was bad, but because everything thitherto had been so awesome, this one couldn't stack up. It was open-faced and loaded with fruits, mostly raspberries and peaches, maple syrup and an excessive amount of whipped cream. Good, but a little too much on the cream and sweet; I was hoping for a lightly sweet crêpe that would highlight the fruit rather than the sugar.I live in Maryland, but I know that when I return to Montreal I will eagerly seek out the Crêperie Chez Suzette!"

Now that's what I'm talkin' about...I was all about revisiting this place during my last visit to Old Town, Montreal. I have this on going joke going with my significant other that goes like this ""Have you been there before on a date?""* The answer is sadly often yes, because we met in our late 20s/early 30s and are both people that eat out way too often. In whatever city we're in. Anyway, when it was time to play this round I finally got to say ""only with my mom and my best friend's little sister."" This was bittersweet, as I felt like I won, but then he didn't try to outdo any other scenario. Wow. Talk about TMI. Moving on.I know this is a creperie, but I disagree. Suzette's finest is her fondue. I've had the original emmental and this time the three cheese and pepper. Delicious. I know others say the prices are jacked up because of this touristy location, but I got a bottle of French merlot (No one is drinking merlot!!! -Sad Paul Giamatti) for under $20 and shared the gooey gooey goodness with my SO. The small is definitely enough to share, and they offer to bring you free bread when you run low. They respect bread to cheese ratios, thus I respect Suzette and her three floors of casual Quebecois dining in the heart of this cobble-stoned hood. *This game might sound really passive aggressive but it's actually not. It's more like, ""But did she have the bartender send you a flaming shot**? I think not! See I'm the best!""**No flaming shots were done at Chez Suzette. She's too classy for that stuff."

Since he is Texan, I thought it would be a good occasion to have him try another sample of Québécois cuisine. Unfortunately, however, the food turned out to be quite bland; although it didn't taste bad, it lacked the je ne sais quoi which makes a meal memorable. I had the Crêpe Argenteuil and he had Quiche Provençale, both of which seriously lacked seasoning. Other than that, their coffee and drinks were fair and their staff was pleasant enough.Conclusion: Since my cooking's better and tastier, next time I'll Isave my money to buy fresh ingredients and cook those dishes at home."

The menu is extensive, with fondue, sweet and savory crepes, sandwiches and many cocktails. I ordered a crepe with ham, brie, carmelized onions and maple syrup. It was delicious. I also had bites of the chicken supreme crepe... fabulous. The waiter suggested adding melted mozzarella to the top of that one.. do it! Overall an excellent experience, wouldn't change a thing."

I ordered La Méditerranéenne Crêpe, a baked crêpe filled with chicken and ratatouille, topped with generous amounts of mozzarella cheese. I also had the Bellini Fraise drink, which tasted a little strong in my opinion (but I'm quite a lightweight). For dessert, two friends and I shared the Fondue au Chocolat pour 2, and the dark chocolate was very smooth and rich. If you tell the waiter that it's someone's birthday, they will bring the dessert out  with a candle in it while singing happy birthday.

Didn't really like the soup, thought that there was way too much cheese, about a lb of it sitting on top of the soup which was kind of gross and the base wasn't very flavourful. Crepe itself was very delicious and smelled amazing. The fillings and the sauce worked together but it wasn't my favorite combination.

We had finished earlier on our dinner in the area and wanted to extend our stay before visiting a jazz bar nearby. My friends recommended this spot as they make it a point to visit this place whenever they are in Montreal.The place in unassuming and actually spans 3 floors so there is plenty of seating even when it looks packed from outside. We just wanted to stick to desserts so after going through the extensive menu we all settled on crepes (what else) They do have a decent beer and cocktail selection so it is worth a look.The crepes are big portion as the crepe suzette I ordered was 4 pieces. The stuffed crepes were also quite big. Crepe Suzette was decent though frozen berries were used in the crepes with berry filling. Prices are almost the same as a proper mid/high end restaurant in the area. 3 Stars.

Highly recommend eating on the third floor which had a nicer atmosphere to it.

We got a table inside overlooking the procession on St. Paul St, a great view. But the cheese fondue - one of their specialties - was a huge disappointment. Instead of baguette chunks, we got cranberry bread, olive bread - soft, gummy breads. And the cheese lacked the punch you get from kirsch; our packaged fondue from Trader Joes tastes better. The Caesar salad - admittedly a side order - was devoid of Caesar flavor; just chopped lettuce and croutons. Likewise, their Suzette Sundae, a concoction of Grand Marnier,  cognac, and ice cream, was mostly melted ice cream, more to be slurped thru a straw than eaten with a spoon. Food was definitely phoned in. The resto is attractive, outside and in; service was fast and friendly and responsive. I just wish the food had been as likable. 3 stars max."

My wife had the Quiche Loraine which she said was as good as mine and the crust may be better. I tasted it and she was right.

/user_details?userid=fYB4nPD2Y0uXXpVo20ZrNg,Abigail L.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"I'm guessing Chez Suzette is pretty much just for the tourists based on the area it's in but if I lived in Montreal I think I'd brave the tourists to frequent this place.  It has a warm and cozy atmosphere, vegetarian options and reasonable prices for the portions and taste. I opted for the L'Argenteuil crepe, asparagus, bechamel sauce, and pine nuts in a crepe, then there's cheese on top and it's baked. OH MY GOOD GOD it was heaven wrapped in cream sauce and baked with cheese.  I asked to add mushrooms to the crepe and they came on the side.  At first I thought, that's weird, but it was nice to have a mushroom with every bite.   My husband opted for the Crepe aux Avocats, which boasted pesto, avocados, and tomatoes. He added swiss cheese, which was also baked on top.  It was a refreshing and yummy crepe but nothing compared to the fatty, rich, creamy crepe that I ordered.  He was jealous.  My reasoning for 4 of 5 stars instead of a full 5 is that the asparagus was just slightly tough.   A senior tour sat next to us and cracked me up with their Seinfeld's parentsesque comments.  They also seemed pretty happy with their meals.  If old people like it it must be good right?"

We stumbled into this place as we were wandering around Old Montreal, my boyfriend insisting he wanted to eat something authentic. To him that meant only french things or poutine, so here we were.I honestly have no complaints about this place. The food I ordered was very good (assorted seafood baked in a lobster bisque sauce), the view overlooking Rue St. Paul and a bit of the bay was fantastic, and the service was prompt, polite and attentive. They also offer some of the cheapest bottles of wine I've ever seen in any restaurant ever. The problem is that somehow the experience was lacking. Maybe it's because the restaurant was kind of empty. Not in a cozy romantic way, but in a way where you feel a little awkward that you're the only people in the room.  Maybe because even though the service was good, it was also a little cold. Maybe its because even though everything was good, nothing wowed me (except those wine bottle prices!).It's a perfectly good restaurant that I have no real interest in returning to.

It's the kind of place you go to where the portions are huge but you still eat the whole thing because it's so damn good.One of my friends and i got seafood crepes, which was delicious because- lets face it- everything is good when it's covered in baked cheese and is filled with rich, creamy bechamel sauce. Another friend got a bacon and avocado crepe, which he said was good, but after seeing the deliciousness of our seafood crepes he felt like he could have made a better selection. Another friend got the quiche, which looked amaziiiiing. The crust seemed really golden and flakey. My cappuccino was also delicous... And that would be because it arrived covered in whipped cream and chocolate powder. If they had asked i would have said no whipped cream to try make a tiny attempt at being healthy, but if it arrives that way i'm not gonna complain!I'll definitely be back here next time I'm in Montreal!

I also got a smoothie called the CocoLoco in addition to my sandwich, and that was probably one of the better smoothies I've had in recent memory. Would I come back? Probably not. The food wasn't bad by any means, it just didn't stand out to me as a place I must visit when touring the city. Nevertheless, it was a decent place to eat in Old Montreal without blowing the wallet."

We happened upon Chez Suzette in the old port late Sunday morning, and were seated right away (there are 3 floors!). I had the French onion soup au gratin ($8) and escargots ($7). The escargots were delicious and garlic-buttery, served with little white dinner rolls. The onion soup was also very good - lots of cheese, flavourful broth, and soft onions. The bread in the soup was quite soggy, and would have been better if toasted first. Regardless, it was a nice bowl of comfort.Our friend had the crepe with apples, brie and maple syrup ($14).  It was amazing! The crisp apples and gooey cheese were the perfect combination.My boyfriend has the special delice ($14) - a breakfast crepe with eggs, meat, cheese and mushrooms - and loved it.

When we first walked in,  we were asked whether we had a reservation and we didn't.  We left and called and told there was plenty of space and so we went back. After looking forward to eat some fondue,  it came and had such a strong white wine flavor which meant it hadn't fully evaporated.  It was super disappointing because there was no mention of white wine in the description at all. We thought our waitress had removed it from the bill so when we asked her she said she forgot to add it. We then said that it should be because it was not advertised and we barely ate it. She was clearly unhappy and we just got attitude thereafter.  Little did she know we would have left a big fat tip if she didn't give us the unnecessary attitude when we were polite the entire time and clearly did not like the fondue! It was barely touched! French onion soup was okay,  lobster bisque was okay and the crepes were good. Don't expect great service if you're asian as was confirmed by a fellow local resident.

It provided great entertainment while I waited for my order.It serves crepes in hardy sizes, sizes that I've never seen before, even in Paris. I could barely finish the first one.

So, that worked out well.  In fact, in the end, we were all too full for desserts.  We had the La Quebecoise (with Swiss cheese, ham and Quebec maple syrup) and the Chicken Supreme (chicken pieces and ala King sauce).  And boy, I would never forget my husband's and 1 yr old's first taste of escargot!  We also had a fine bottle of Brouilly, which our server suggested.Food was actually simple and really unimpressive.  But, like I said, it was perfect for us that evening!And just to add a note to parents: There was no changing table inside the toilettes but you might want to try out what one mom did: she used the top of the deep freezers laying by the coat racks as her baby station.  I think it works well!"

For drinks, we got a bloody caesar and the cocoloco smoothie. They mistakenly made a bloody mary and informed us, which I was fine with. The drink though, was virtually all tomato juice and I couldn't taste any tabasco/pepper or vodka, and there was no celery or garnish. Probably the worst bloody mary I have ever had. The cocoloco was pretty good, but very artificial tasting. I got the crepe charlevoix, which was generous portion. Even though I was hungry, it wasn't that good. I do wish they had more meat options with their crepes. The dessert crepes looked very good but I wasn't in the mood for one. I tried the quiche which was decent.

My husband had Le Jamaicaine, which was similar, but without strawberries. Both of us easily finished our crepes and one of the two scoops of ice cream, were satisfied and agreed that there was no way we could have had a savory crepe and then the sweet ones, so I think it's the type of place we'd return for a dessert or specifically for savory ones for a meal.

Not that the crêpe is even close to bad, but you know, they just make the pastry, add some pre-cut fruits and cover it in chocolate sauce. This by any means can taste bad. But when the fruit is fresh cut it tastes better, when they make the crêpe with the fruit, everything tastes different (the fruits are a bit warm), etc. So, it's just a 3-star crêpe.

Lots of sweet and savory crepes and fondue options.I LOVED my Parisienne crepe which had apples, brie and of course some maple syrup. Many of the other crepes included cheese and some more cheese on top...I felt like my dinner option was sutto healthy.  Chocolate fondue is a must and one portion was very generous. Our dessert was accompanied by loads of fresh fruit, bits of crepe and marshmallow."

We risked a trip here despite the reviews since half are rave and the others not so much. Unfortunately we too experienced the hard crêpes and have definitely had better elsewhere. They do have many filling options and while they tasted fine, the crêpes themselves were extremely chewy and not a normal consistency that you would expect which lends an odd mouth feel to the dishes. Thankfully the midday special is half off any crêpe so we didn't have to pay full price for food that was only so so. I ordered the hot cider that was mentioned in the rave reviews and was not disappointed as it was tasty. The large lemon and orange they put in made it difficult to drink so I just removed them.  The special board when you walk in advertised cidre chaud et vin chaud. I ordered the cidre and my husband ordered the vin chaud. He repeated his order multiple times in both English et français but was served a regular glass of wine with his order. I would not eat here again, there are better crêperies and better service."

The nutella crepes could've used more nutella so just ask for some on the side.Hot cider and wine looked great but we didn't get a chance to try.

The crepe menu is full of choices, both for meat lovers and vegetarians. The first time there I had crepe Romanoff (strawberries, whipped cream and ice cream) and my friend had crepes with bananas, whipped cream, ice cream, topped with chocolate sauce.

But we thoroughly enjoyed Old Montreal - we were near the water (summer weekly fireworks!), within walking distance from Jazz Fest & were able to navigate public transpo to other areas of town (Plateau/Outremont/Mile End, etc.) rather easily.  SO that being said... I guess this restaurant (suggested by our hotel) falls into the ""touristy"" category because of its locale & its ""more mid-priced than dirt-cheap"" prices.  Whatever... what mattered to us was that the food was YUMMY & had we had more time, we would've eaten here again!  The menu offers a wide selection of crepes & non-crepe offerings.  But we were cravin' crepes so we split a ""Sugar Shack"" (ham, scrambled eggs & maple syrup) & a ""Sonia"" (strawberries, bananas, ice cream & chocolate sauce).  Both were absolutely scrumptious!  Great coffee too.  Located off historic & scenic St. Paul, this place looks tiny & quaint from the outside but it has multiple comfy & charming dining levels inside.  Our server was attentive & friendly.  We would definitely like to return some day to try their other crepes!"
