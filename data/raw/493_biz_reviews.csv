The sucre à la crème with the french toast was wild. The bacon, delicious. In the pastries, the roll and crumpets were great but the scone changed my life forever. It all came super cutely packaged through skip the dishes. The order even included a playlist link, they're really looking out for you."

We didn't get the best spot, in fact we were placed in the corner, this place is best for bigger groups. I loved my pear raspberry smoothie and the Frangelico oat latte. The tofu scramble vegan brunch was honestly subpar compared with many others I've tried in Montreal, it needs more flavor love and perhaps some breakfast potatoes that aren't covered in duck fat, maybe ;)The staff was really nice but confused about what vegan means, I guess.Overall not bad, hope to see some improvements, the drinks are worth coming back for."
/user_details?userid=VUS9-ABMF37mbHG5aMaaZw,Gabriella F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Such a different type of breakfast restaurant. All the food was absolutely amazing. You can't go wrong with any of these plates. The service was perfect. We got little samples of smoothie and banana butter. The waiter was charming and knowledgeable. The place was abit loud though.
/user_details?userid=Ga1ZxDI2UxMpDyLMb1nvZQ,Jessica C.,"Milton, Canada",4 star rating,"I highly recommend coming here as early as possible if you plan on coming in the weekend. We came here on a Saturday morning at 9am and it was just the 3 of us. There was already a line to get in and the dining room was packed. By the time we left around 11:30 there was a line up out the door even around the cornerThe decor: this place is so cute so definately ask the server to take a photo of you and your table because it's Instagram worthy. All of the walls have something different to look at and gives you inspiration for your own homeThe food: the menu itself is very condensed but there is a section for lunch (served at a certain time), sides and desserts. They have sweet plates, savoury plates and even a vegan plate. There were so many things I wanted to eat and coundnt decide but I'm glad I went with the Champi since I wanted something savoury and this dish is definitely savoury and quenched my tastebuds. There were a ton of mushrooms and the toast was delicious with the gravy. The service: the service here is great. I like how the servers are attentive but they don't hover over you either. We had actually finished eating around 10:30 and ended up staying an extra hour before they finally asked us to leave since there was a huge line up. I'm actually surprised they let us stay for that much longer since there was a huge line when we had left. They asked us very nicely and were very appreciative so I do not mind being kicked out at all!"

We went there on a cold early December Sunday, hoping there would be a smaller lineup. We still waited 30mins outside in the freezing cold. Perhaps lineups are less long during weekdays. Customers are offered hot tea and blankets while they wait but it's still painful. On the bright side, it gets a lot better once you're inside! Good selection of brunch plates & different coffees. There are options without eggs for those who aren't big fans. Great atmosphere & nice service. Cool decor too. Enjoy!"

Their breakfast poutine is to die for! I am a semi picky eater and was a bit intimated reading the description but when in Canada I decided to experiment and the server highly recommended and I am so glad I tried it! This was one of my favorite poutines I had in Canada and believe me I had a lot to choose from! The croissant was good but nothing special. It's a really cute and trendy place. The service is great and don't forget the yummy mimosas!

/user_details?userid=nJVS18mJIB1hCHq1YsFbUQ,Bonnie C.,"Newton, MA",5 star rating,"Made reservations for this cafe the second I saw it being recommended on TripAdvisor. What caught my eyes were the scotch eggs which I've only had it one other time in London, which I enjoyed a lot. The day came and we decided to come two hours earlier than our reservation, which they were fine with. This was around 9AM on a Monday. There were no lines at this time and was able to get seated right away. I'm not sure if this is a common occurrence, but there was a lot of detours surrounding this establishment. We were able to find parking on the big street, but it is only 1 hour parking which was enough time for us. We ordered the Gaufre and Canard which comes with duck instead of salmon. This was an easy choice considering how much we love duck. It comes with a poached egg, but we wanted the scotch egg so we ordered that on the side. Prior to ordering our meals, our waitress offered us a shot of their juice cocktail of the day, which was a mixture of apple, raspberry, and basil. I loved it so much I had to order a glass. So refreshing and delicious! The food came out and it looked exquisite. There were many components to the dish that paired very well together. Our waitress even gave us plates to split without having us to ask her for it. The scotch eggs was AMAZING. If I thought the ones in London were amazing, then this was out of the world. This is definitely fried more. Dip it in ketchup and it tastes even better (probably a very American thing to do?) - whichever your heart desires I guess! My friend and I split everything and was enough food for us, but then again we don't have big appetites. On top of the amazing food, the service was the best of the best. I loved our waitress so much! She was friendly and came out to check up on us in a very well-paced manner. I wish I got her name because she deserves the credit. The cafe itself is well decorated and it was comfortable to sit here. I had such a great experience here that I want to come back already! Everybody was so great at the restaurant and food/drinks were memorable. I will never forget my experience here."

Parking around there is street parking that had 1 hour limits. I was a bit skeptical and worried since yelp had made getting to this place sound like a nightmare but maybe we got lucky. 5/5 service. Everyone was so nice and welcoming. They bring you these shots of this green juice which tasted amazing. 5/5 food. Coming from LA, I did NOT think that brunch here was amazing and over the top. But they are just as good as all the other food in LA. For the price, the plates were high end and looked nice. We got the scampi + scottish egg and the corn waffles with duck. The Scottish egg was the highlight and totally worth it. The mushrooms that came with the scampi were very well made. Overall I'd probably be willing to return and try something else."

It was in the middle of the week in July, however, there was still a 10-20 minute lineup at the entrance.I have to admit, I was impressed by the decor and ambiance of Regine Cafe. As soon as I entered, all my senses were delighted: the aroma of baked goods and eggs benedict filled my nostrils; my eyes were drawn to the upscale and opulent adornments that decked out the restaurant, etc.The waiter was very friendly and courteous. She provided service with tact. The menu was also very creative: they offer imaginative drinks and breakfast/brunch items. I personally ordered a latte and a ""croquette"" (which is a salmon cake, with yogurt tartar sauce, poached egg, and greens). Both items were delectable.All in all, it was a great experience. If you want to pamper yourself, or impress a date, this is a great choice! You won't be disappointed by the food, and the atmosphere is very easy on the eyes."

I've been meaning to try this place for ages but the lines on the weekend are very long (and for good reason!). Finally the opportunity came up to go to brunch on a Monday. Service was prompt and polite and the interior is so cozy. They have a great menu and it was difficult to decide which dish to pick. I went for the sandwich, which consisted of scrambled eggs, avocado, tomato and caramelized mushrooms and onions on a homemade brioche bun. It came with fruit and mashed potatoes. It was delicious! I also ordered a cappuccino, which was excellent and they bring a complimentary juice of the day. Today was a freshly squeezed basil, pineapple and passion fruit juice.I definitely want to go back to try so many other dishes, I think its worth waiting in line!"
/user_details?userid=MZBXf-QVIH6EqxPXxn_32w,Meiki W.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Food here was exceptional, but be prepared to wait. I came here with my fiancé last Friday for brunch, at 11am. There was already a line. They have drinking water available outside, and occasionally someone would come out and offer bite size of their cinnamon buns while we waited. I thought that was super sweet and thoughtful. Although I do think they can be more efficient with seating people quicker. We waited about 45 mins, but for at least 15 mins there was an empty table for 2. Guess what, we ended up sitting there. They could've seated us 15 mins earlier. Not sure what the hold up was for. Aside from the unorganized seating, service was great. The staff was super attentive. On another note, yelp currently say they don't take reservations but I saw a lot of people going in with reservations."

Yes the location is quite inconvenient and yes the line is quite hellish, but I think it's still worth making the trip notwithstanding the torture of waiting. Service: I do want to mention the service I received here. The waitress was very polite and accommodating. We had ordered the candy café which we found wayyyy to sweet. At the end of our meal, we told our waitress and she waived the café off our bill and offered us complimentary coffee to go. This is an example of great service and what all the restaurants should aspire to offer.Food: the brunch food here is quite unique. I find their food to be very light and well thought out. It's a bit different from the traditional bacon and eggs. I took the Gros Jambon and it was yummy!"

Once we were admitted we were taken straight to our table which was ready and gave an excellent view of the interior. Immediately we recieved a small shot of Basil, Raspberry, and Strawberry juice, which was very refreshing. Our server (Liliane) immediately introduced herself and asked if we preferred English (which we appreciated as we don't speak very much French), the menus are in both languages too.We ordered a Latte and an Espresso which came quickly and were excellent. We ordered the Chic Croissant and the Gaufre & Canard, along with Crumpets and Bacon Jam.The Crumpets were okay, a bit dense and thick for my tastes. Should be a bit more bread-like, less like a biscuit and thinner. Bacon jam was flavorful but simple.I had the Gaufre & Canard. The duck confit and corn waffle combination was decadent with each part executed with skill. The waffle could have been slightly more crisp, which would help it stand up a little more under the other ingredients, but as a whole the dish was excellent.My wife had the Chic Croissant which was also good and well executed."

It's a little ways out and everything you've heard about the long lines is true. We waited in line for about 20-30minutes on a rainy Sunday during peak brunch time. they brought us sample bites of their brioche while waiting in line. The decor inside is very cute and girly , great for a girls brunch. The hostess and server we had were all super friendly and helpful , didn't miss a beat , service was impeccable all around. When we were seated we were given a sample of their smoothie (orange and basil) it was so fresh tasting and delicious. My friends ordered the hot chocolate and the spicy chocolate milk they all said they enjoyed them. I had their matcha latte with almond milk and it was perfect , smooth and tasty and came with a cute little pig design on the top. The brunch was a little pricey for what it is but it was good. the champi was good but wasn't as much food as I thought and flavour wise it was okay. The salmon with poached eggs was very good lots of salmon and poached eggs cooked perfectly it was my favourite of the two dishes. if you don't mind waiting in line this place is very much worth the trip."

There's consistently a line outside but don't fret, it moves along pretty quickly. We were sat at a communal table but did not feel cramped. Before we even ordered, they started us with a juice shot. It was very refreshing. I ordered the pear and raspberry cocktail which was tart and delicious but way too thick. It felt more like a chunky smoothie than a juice. I ordered the grilled cheese with duck confit. I added a scotch egg on the side because how often can you order one? My girlfriend ordered the Champi which was basically the scotch egg, bread and mushrooms. Everything was delicious and the food was plentiful. My only two minor comments is that the potatoes was undersalted and the cocktail was too thick. Overall I'd come here again."
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I cannot get enough of this restaurant! I want to personally try everything on this menu!!! Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day so I don't fool around when it comes to breakfast. I'm at the breakfast place no later than 9:30 a.m. to guarantee me a seat. Cause when I go out for breakfast, I always got my hungry ""on"" and expecting to eat NOW--not after waiting in a line for 45 minutes. So if you're like me, please show up to Régine Cafe before 9:40 a.m. if you want to be seated right away.  First thing you notice is that the staff are fantastic and the decor is unique and inviting! The staff are warm, friendly, courteous, just really adds to the experience when you have excellent service. They're all dressed so nicely, I especially like seeing one guy wear a wooden bowtie--now if that doesn't take it up a notch, I don't know what does! Then, they always bring you fresh fruit shooters along with a bottle of water.  Then they go over the special of the day.  Now for the food, here's a detailed review of the plates I've tasted so you can decide if you want it. Just a heads up--there is no dish that I didn't love. CHAMPI--savory saucy mushrooms over hearty bread with cheese and poached eggs. It's eaten with a toothed knife. Satisfying, savory and good to the last bite.DORÉ--for the sweet tooth in you.  The plate is simple and deliciousGAUFRÉ--this is my FAVORITE dish so far!  It's a perfect blend of delicately sweet and savory.  The corn waffle brings sweetness to the dish, the gravlax with the salty, the cream cheese with the richness and the tomato salsa and pickled onions bring the punch!  CHOCOLAT--another sweet breakfast but for chocolate lovers.  The candied oranges help lighten the flavor and you can't help but wonder how this is even legal to eat for breakfast :DGRILLED CHEESE--hearty walnut and pistachio bread with melted cheese and caramelized onions served with a side of fresh salad in light vinaigrette and mango chutney.  Delicious.  I only didn't like the mashed potatoes they were too salty and peppery.Scotch Egg--this was the only thing that I wasn't a fan of because the meat was a bit spicy.Duck sausage--surprisingly not fatty! So go ahead and add it as a protein side to your dish!Vanilla white chocolate drink--perfect to complement a savory breakfast.  It's fairly light.Salty dark chocolate milk--just for those not expecting it, the flavor is predominantly salty dark chocolate.  You won't find the usual sweetness that you may expect.  Nice to complement a sweet breakfast. Overall, I'm in love with this breakfast place and will 100% go back again...and again...and again!  Cheers!"

There was a long line up on weekends so anticipate at least a 15+ minute wait if you come in the afternoon. Good: It's a cute looking spot with a vintage vibe, I can see why there are so many people. The complimentary smoothie shots was a nice touch. The service was courteous and quick, no issues there. The plating and presentation looks really appetizing, and that's about it.Bad: Okay, I was super excited that I ordered the chocolate waffle with candied oranges, pistachios and mascarpone cream. When the waitress brought my plate, my eyes just widened with excitement. What a fantastic combination of flavors...except the waffle was the driest thing I've ever ate. I thought it was in my head, so I've made my friend try it too, and even he agrees (He's worked in brunch spots before, so this is his area of expertise.) No one came to check up on us, as I would've like to send back my cardboard waffles. I don't know if they accidentally served me a gluten free batch or something, but it was so unpleasant, I just ate the toppings and washed it down with water. I didn't think it would be possible for a brunch spot to mess up a batter, but I guess it is possible. Bottom line: My friend's meal was fine, I enjoyed half of my meal. Would I come back again? Maybe if someone asks, sure, I'll probably order something else, but this brunch spot is not going to be my first choice. I don't trust their batter."

I tried the grilled cheese with duck confit as an extra. It was delicious but way overpriced. $15 for a grilled cheese and $5 extra did the duct confit. It included a light green salad and a mango chutney. It was good but didn't worth the price. My cousins had the brioche which was delicious and also café latte in a bowl. I had the special of ty day cocktail which was carrot, ginger and I forget but it was tasty and light. The restaurant setting is great, very comfy with nice stylish chairs and also great service."

I heard a lot of good things from different people and wasn't at all disappointed. We tried the Gaufré and the Oeuf et Boeuf for our main meals. The beef was super tender and delicious, the scotch egg that comes with it was so amazing that I was tempted to order a few more eggs. However, overall, I enjoyed the Gaufré more; I have a soft spot for anything gravlax and theirs was delicious in combination with the pickled onions and waffles. For dessert we got the yogurt brûlé and the dessert of the day. The yogurt was very yummy and the pistachio dessert of the day, which was only 7$, was huge and delicious. The matcha latté was very well made, frothy and the design was super cool too.My only advice for people coming is to be prepared to wait in line to get a seat, especially if you come on weekends as they don't accept reservations."

A staff member even came out during the wait and gave us cinnamon bun tasters! Once we finally got in after over an hour, we were greeted with a small welcome juice. Our order was taken, and the food arrived within 5 mins. We thought it couldn't possibly be ours because it arrived so quickly! I got the sale sucre (brioche with pulled ham, cheddar, and a sort of maple butter. I put a poached egg instead of a sunny side up egg) my friend got the champi with a side of spinach béchamel sauce. The mushrooms were cooked to perfection!!!! For dessert we ordered a croissant bread pudding cake with a pistachio layer in the middle. We were STUFFED already, but once we had a bite we knew we had made the right decision! They were nice enough to put it in a to go box. I would recommend splitting this because the slice is large and a bit pricy at $7.Overall. You've gotta go, but go with someone who doesn't mind a wait..."
/user_details?userid=ipufAX2UdjpkydKXT_lX5Q,Lillian Y.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"A very fun and delicious brunch spot! Don't come hungry though, we waited for about 45 minutes for a table of 4 (you have to stand in line, they don't take down names). Once you get in though, be prepared for some delicious fortifying food. We shared an ""un peu de tout"" (3.5/5) which was a 3-tiered assortment of breads and pastries, definitely too much for us considering we were each ordering a brunch dish. Many of the pastries were average, but I did like the baguette, the creme bruleed yogurt, and the dips ESPECIALLY the peanut crumble (we even bought 2 jars to take home). My GF sister got the grano (5/5), yogurt and granola, which sounds simple but was the best I've ever had. There were so many delicious components in that granola, plenty of mixed roasted nuts, coconut, plump dried fruit, I stole several bites.The chic croissant (4.5/5) was excellent, infinitely more exciting than a typical breakfast sandwich. The combination of housemade ham and green sauce were delicious, and the croissant and eggs were just right. The gaufre (4.5/5), corn waffle with salmon gravlax, was surprisingly fluffy and light, and the sweetness of the corn went nicely with the salty gravlax. The chocolat blanc vanille (5/5) is a treat, and totally worth it. The salty dark chocolate milk (4/5) was also quite good but not as special. Each brunch dish comes with a lil fruit and salad on the side to make for a complete meal. The staff was super friendly and enthusiastic, and we did not feel rushed even though we were one of the last tables. Loved this spot and would highly recommend."

/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"Another highly popular brunch place in the middle of nowhere that is a ""must-try""! I went today for brunch. Got there at around 11:30am and waited 40 minutes to be seated even though we were just 2 people. We got a high table, so we missed out on sitting on the plush, beautiful looking seats other groups were enjoying.Still, none of this put a damper on my spirits because I was excited to try this place and to see what all of the fuss was about. The waitress was polite and always had a smile on her face (which is refreshing after the horrible waitress I encountered at Le Cheese last week). Upon sitting down, they served us a green juice shot each, which is a great way to start our digestion before eating anything! The cafe au lait was yummy and a good size, but nothing special compared to Italian coffee served at places like Café Gentile.The menu is small and limited, with most options involving pork. I ordered the chic croissant without the pulled pork, which wasn't replaced with anything for the same price. I'll never understand why restaurants don't just create a vegetarian version of some plates, where they can add mushrooms, more cheese, etc., to replace the meat. Anyway, this is probably why I felt it was on the small side for the price ($16). It consisted of a small croissant, some scrambled eggs, a little cheese and a delicious spinach bechamel sauce on top (like a pesto). It was served with a few slices of fruit and some greens. Adding some house potatoes on the plate or mushrooms or something would have just tied the whole thing for me.I actually got a dessert after finishing my plate, which is something I've never done before at a breakfast place. The waitress suggested getting the sucre à la crème brioche which sounded amazing but let me down.  I'm not big on doughy desserts that don't pack a punch flavour-wise.L'Avenue & Fabergé are better portion and option-wise for those who enjoy savoury foods for breakfast that doesn't include meat. So overall, good service, great flavours but smaller portions and overpriced."

/user_details?userid=fbWhdgqT2FcDtkpsqRj3tg,Kim V.,"Vaughan, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my favourite breakfast/brunch places that I've ever had! Our friends had raved about this place and I can totally see why. Please open one up in Toronto! Pros:- Food: The food here is so good! Everything was made fresh and portions were huge! You will definitely not leave here hungry! I think for the price, it is well worth your money for the experience and food quality you get. - Decor: The decor of the restaurant is so cute. You can see everyone just taking pictures all the time. Very modern! - Service: Our server was great, very nice and helped us pick what we wanted to get. All of our food came out at the same time. Cons:- Line ups: If you are going for breakfast, be prepared to leave earlier to stand in line. When our group went, the line up was around the corner. Fortunately, the servers came out with small snacks and flavoured water for the people waiting in line. - Parking: Unfortunately, no parking for this restaurant. We had to park on the street and walk to the restaurant. Foods/Drinks I like:- Gros Jambon- Un Peu De Tout- Champi with Scotch Egg"

I'm not interested in waiting in lines so I figured I'd probably just never try this much hyped brunch joint, but then we were in the area on a Tuesday and the line was short and my hot date was willing so we put our names down. We only waited 10 minutes and the service was prompt, professional and kind. We were seated in a kind of shitty corner table, almost in the alley between the two dining rooms, and the decor was bumming us out - a little frilly and overdone for my taste - and the prices were high for breakfast and not a lot of vegetarian options, so we were working hard to keep our spirits up until the food came. And then everything was ok. The homemade brioche with banana butter was melt-in-my-mouth glorious. The smoked trout on corn waffles with light fresh salsa and ciboulette cream was light but filling and incredibly delicious and the coffee was great. I felt great after I ate it like you only do with exceptional food and ingredients. Even my highly dubious vegetarian date loved it all in spite of himself. By the time we left the line was around the corner so I doubt I'll be back in a hurry but the meal was a treat and I'm super glad I got to try it."

The food is great too, a little bit too salty for my taste, but very generous on portions. Yes, I'd come there again maybe in summer and bit earlier so I don't have to wait so long in line."
/user_details?userid=8HafK5cS8pWCWNQTIG8iJw,Uyen D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been hearing about Regine Cafe's infamous brunches for many years now, but have never gotten around to trying it because it always seemed out of the way. Well on a recent freezing day, I finally took the leap and made my way into Regine's cozy cafe. I'll have to admit that I was worried about the lineup that's mentioned in virtually every Yelp review. I ended up arriving around 2:30 pm and didn't have to wait at all, so that may be a good time to go if you want to skip the line. Upon seating, we were promptly greeted with 2 complimentary shots of their homemade smoothie. It tasted fresh and delicious. We ordered the duck confit grilled cheese, the Champi and a side of Scotch egg. The grilled cheese was delicious and rich, served in perfectly toasted pistachio and nut bread. The Champi consisted of two poached eggs alongside pan-fried mushrooms tossed in sage and butter. It was good, but for some reason I expected more. The Scotch egg was nice though; the egg was wrapped in a spiced sausage and its yolk had a custard-like texture. The whole thing was fried to crispy perfection. The place was very stylish; there are two rooms and both had a vintage look. Think glossy Damask wallpaper, Louis XIV style sofas and antique frames on a black wall. Just a beautiful space to linger over coffee on a Sunday afternoon.Their desserts looked delicious, but unfortunately I didn't have any space left. I loved my brunch experience here and look forward to coming back to sample more of the menu!"

I had gaufré with a gluten-free waffle, my daughter had champi and my husband and our friend both had gros jambon. Everything was delicious!

The food is incredible, the service is outstanding, definitely the BEST breakfast spot in all of Montreal. Sure the wait is long but they provide fruit infused water for the wait and someone came out and gave samples of this amazing pistachio cake while we waited and the line usually goes by very quick because all the workers are so in sync and know what they're doing. There are no empty tables filled with dirty dishes lingering unlike other restaurants. The portions are huge which is great cause you're reallygetting your moneys worth and the waitress even comes around and gives you the shooter of the day which for us was this incredible mango, mint, pineapple juice that I would drink by the gallon.

/user_details?userid=KmUy2GX3OpGkS1LXOJ8tNg,Tracy D.,"Merrick, NY",5 star rating,"Now one of my favorite brunch places in Montreal. I've been here twice for brunch on a Sunday and a Monday on two separate occasions. The restaurant has been busy both times. One thing to note is they don't do reservations on weekends, so you'll have to patiently wait on line. I've tried the coffee with condensed milk and the spiced hot chocolate which both are great in their own way. The spiced hot chocolate is separated its milk and chocolate concoction for you to combine in a cup to your liking. It is served along with a mini whisk and cinnamon stick. The coffee with condensed milk has a cloud of whipped cream and coffee bean shaped chocolates on top. The condensed milk adds a sweet silkiness to the coffee. They have many options to choose from what to eat. From savory dishes to sweet. The two items I tried were the grilled cheese and the chic croissant. The chic croissant is a stacked croissant sandwich with scrambled eggs, cheddar, pulled ham and a creamy spinach sauce. The flakiness of the croissant pairs well with the rest of the combination. I really enjoyed the grilled cheese since I'm a sucker for duck confit. The bread was very unique with walnuts and pistachios. What's really great is they serve the dishes with a side of fresh fruit to refresh your palate from all the good food you enjoyed. Service was really good as well as the wait staff is very attentive to make sure their customers are taken care of."

Régine Café has an exquisite menu filled with dishes that have carefully selected ingredients of the highest quality. Whether you're into meat and protein, a breakfasty dish, or a healthy dish that has yogurt and fruits in it, you won't be disappointed. Apart from the deliciousness, there is a lot of details in the presentation of plates that makes every plate a work of art! Drinks, juices, and coffees are all very well made as well. If you're not from Canada, like me, try their ultra thick french toasts with Quebec maple syrup as a side. The staff at Régine Café are well-trained ladies and gentlemen who go above and beyond for their costumers.

The employees were also really considerate - While we were waiting, they came out and offered both brioche bites and warm tea.

Everything on the menu looked so good, and it was so difficult choosing what to order - My friend and I ended up ordering the Champi and the Tartine, which were both extremely delicious. The Champi is basically poached eggs and sautéed mushrooms atop a layer of cheese on rustic bread, which I really enjoyed. The Tartine was tomatoes, scrambled eggs, spicy sausage and ricotta cheese on top of rustic bread, which was also super flavourful. Our dishes also came with a side of mashed potatoes and fresh fruit, leaving us full and very satisfied.

/user_details?userid=kYv7-05S0qyzkxtuCDzVzQ,Hana E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Regine café is basically the reason why I wake up every morning. Seriously though. Every time I try another brunch spot, no matter how amazing it is, I always regret not going to Regine so I've accepted the fact that I have attachment issues and nothing can come between me and this café.Usually on weekends you'll end up waiting in line for 30 minutes. But it's worth the wait. I would camp outside for days if necessary. The first thing they give you right after you're seated is a shot of their juice of the day. They're all amazing, delicious, and addicting Regardless of what you order, ALWAYS GET A SCOTCH EGG ON THE SIDE. IT IS THE DEFINITION OF HEAVEN. They are so good I literally want an entire bag to take home with me. So anytime you grab anything off of the menu, just ask for a scotch egg on the side, you definitely won't regret it. The top two meals that I always get is the Champi and the Sucré Salé.The Champi: you get a big slice of rustic bread and on top you have the melted 1608 cheese... Then you have the mushrooms. The mushrooms are so delicious. They're perfectly sauteed. And then you have two poached eggs. You have the choice to replace them with the scotch egg. I usually get the scotch egg on the side. The entire meal comes the amazing mashed potatoes that have so much flavour. It's my favourite dish. I like to also add some pulled ham on the side as well to complete it. Sucré Salé: if you're up for dessert after then get this  dish but you should probably consider splitting it with someone since it's considered a meal! It can also be paired with the scotch egg if you'd like but basically it's the perfect mix with sweet and savoury. You have the French toast that's ooooozing with syrup and on top you have the pulled ham, sunny side up egg and huge chunks of CREAM FUDGE. Honestly... Get both. Worst case you feel extremely full and maybe end up at the emergency room.. But at least you got a taste of heaven so there is nothing to regret.  - @hanaer"

This spot is officially my favourite brunch spot in all of Montréal. We went on a Sunday and if you go early to line up before it opens you are likely to get a seat.I found their dishes very creative and innovative. They were able to accomplish layers of diverse flavours and textures that just kept me wanting more.The Gaufré I ordered was absolutely delightful. The saltiness of the trout with the fresh chive cream in combination of the flavorful corn waffle and the pickled onions to add acidity was divine. Highly recommend!We got the cinnamon bun on the side and they were light and fluffy with a slight crisp on the top. I prefer the original over the caramel apple.The café has a classy Victorian look and the servers made it a great experience. Servers were also very good and attentive.I would definitely come back again next time I am in Montréal.Food - 5/5Service - 4/5Atmosphere - 4.5/5

Yes, it's THAT good! Not your typical brunch place with eggs any style. Every item on the menu is original, resulting in a complete twist on classic items. We had the grilled cheese on homemade pistachio bread, you could really taste the pistachios with every bite. As well as the sweet and salty, which consisted of homemade thick French toast topped with pulled ham and an egg served along with melted sucre a la creme. Both were delicious, plate licking good (which I did do, but with a spoon!)Will definitely be back! If you are free during a weekday, ever better! As they take reservations :)"

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"As brunch has become more and more in vogue in Montreal, it is becoming a challenge to go to the most popular locations around the city without waiting in line somewhere. As much as I love brunch, at this time of the year, standing outside doesn't really appeal to me. If only one of the best was also open on weekdays... and located about 2 minutes from where I take some of my physio courses... oh wait... Régine Café fits that description. Awesome. This Rosemont staple has been getting rave reviews for the past few years but it never really lined up for me to visit. Well, using the excuse of my course a couple of times over the past year, I have headed over on Fridays with my classmates to indulge in some decadent brunch food as a respite from all the learning.Régine Café has a definite retro chic look going on. Almost Alice in Wonderland-like in terms of colours and patterns. It is quaint, fun and definitely loud - both in terms of look and noise level. Even on a Friday, this isn't the place for a quiet conversation. Service was quick and efficient although at the rate people come in, they need to be.You get a shooter of the day to start your meal every time. The first time, it was pineapple and mint. The second time, it was beet and apple. Both creative and fun ways to start the meal. They also have a number of drink options. I went with the cider both times. Very satisfying beverage for a brunch!On my first visit, I decided to go with the Sucré Salé - homemade brioche french toast with pulled ham, aged cheddar, an egg and sucre à la crème. The title of the dish is definitely apt - a great combination of salty and sweet goodness. French toast using brioche was dense yet fluffy and had a great crust to it. The pulled ham was tender and salty. The egg and the melty cheese provided some richness and then you had the insanely sweet but oh so good sucre à la crème. I wanted a nap big time after this one so perhaps not the right choice during class but whatever, I stand by my choice.For round 2, I started with a scone with mascarpone cream. I loved the cream but the scone was a little dry and dense to my liking. Great nutty and fruity flavour profile but a little more fluffiness would have been appreciated.I decided after that to go with the Grilled Cheese - 2 year old Cheddar from Îles-aux-Grues with caramelised onions, walnut and pistachio bread, mango chutney and a little confit duck to top it all off. The only thing not appreciated of this plate was the mashed potatoes - too dry despite the nice rich flavour. The sandwich was outstanding - the duck was tender and fatty, the cheese was melted nicely and had a nice sharpness to it. The onions brought a touch of sweetness as well. Régine Café definitely lived up to the hype. Excellent food, fun decor and solid service. I might be too lazy to go wait in line on a weekend but for those of you who do, don't worry - you will come out very satisfied!Cheers!"

We waited a total of 15 minutes tops before we were seated in their cute French bistro basket atmosphere.

I rarely have proper brunch in Toronto and was very excited to try this one. It was very cold in the morning and we waited in line for 20-30 min. The cafe provides small samples and tea for customers waiting in line. This was a very nice gesture. When we finally got seated, I ordered a dark hot chocolate and the special. The dark chocolate was DIY, you pour the dark chocolate and milk together. Then, I whisked it all together. It came with a marshmallow. It was very delicious. The dark hot chocolate was 72% I believe and it was not overly bitter. The marshmallow was very good. The daily special I ordered was a piece of sourdough (I think) with scrambled eggs, avocado, chorizo, and a lot of leafy greens. I was starving and first impression was that it was beautifully set. The eggs was very fluffy and I can tell that they used milk (I think). I wish that the food was hotter. It was warm and got cold fast. I might just eat slow. It was a huge portion as well so I was stuffed by the end of it. I would come back to the place again to try the french toast and other scrumptious goods on the menu."

/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Location: On Beaubien East, not far from Papineau. I have no idea how transit would get you there, however street parking is available (it's not zoned for residents) and if you arrive before they open, you should have no problem getting a spot. I arrived around 8:40 on a Sunday and parked in front of the restaurant. The place: Love the space and the decor! It's bright and fresh. A little condensed in the main dining area, but I'm not running laps around the restaurant so you know, no big deal. The goods: We all started with a Mokacino, and we all loved it. It was the perfect blend of coffee and chocolate. So good in fact, that we all ordered a second cup.  In terms of brunch, I ordered the grilled cheese - since I basically embarked on a weekend of gluttony on Friday night, I figured I may as well end it with a bang. The grilled cheese was made up of 2-year old cheddar, caramelized onions and walnut and pistachio bread. Unbeknownst to me, it was also accompanied for a lovely green salad with mango chutney, and the best, best, best potatoes EVER. The grilled cheese was amazing and I love that bread. The cheese wasn't overly salty at all, the bread was nice and crispy, and I frequently chewed on some pistachios and walnuts. Yum! The salad was super fresh (I'm not sure what type of dressing was on it but it was very light) and the mango chutney was delicious. I was really happy with my breakfast, though I think I'll remain full for at least a week after all this food! One friend ordered the Chic croissant, while the other ordered the Mish Mash - both loved their dishes. We also shared crumpets with the homemade Nutella and it was awesome. Overall, a great brunch chez ma tante Régine. So, when can we move in?Service: Very good. Our waiter was friendly and he made sure we always had water. Service was a bit slow, but honestly, the place was packed within 10 minutes of opening so I can't really fault them for this. We weren't in a hurry anyway.Price point: For the giant grilled cheese board, two coffees and a side of bacon, it came to about $30 with tip."

We had hoped to walk from the Village, but quickly realized we needed to Uber. We were greeted by a line that wrapped around the corner where there was complimentary citrus water for customers waiting. Despite the crowd, things moved pretty quickly. Our meal definitely peaked early. We got complimentary samples of the fresh juice of the day, a nice touch. The highlight was the brioche w the banana caramel sauce - if you order this, get their homemade Nutella on the side too, you won't regret it. This brioche was the fluffiest, tastiest little treat. We also tried the cinnamon brioche, but found it a bit bland w not much glaze or sweetness. Presentation of our meals was beautiful. I ordered the chic croissant - very tasty, just heavy. My husband got a sweet brioche dish w marscapone and strawberries. He said the dish was good, but the strawberry sauce was lacking, making things a bit dry and disappointing. Service was very good, despite being busy. There was a delay w drinks at one point, but that was kindly handled by our server without us having to say anything. With all the amazing food in Montreal, we probably won't make it back here the next time we visit."

We arrive early and thankfully so: The lineup is too long to wait outside in the cold, even with the cup of coffee the restaurant staff offer them. While we wait for the ""Un Peu de Tout"" pastry plate tower, I talk to a patron from Repentigny at a lovely table with chrysanthemums to discuss his weekend away plans.We start with a fresh clementine-pineapple-mint shot and then ravish the cinnamon brioche, miniature brioche with pear butter, and crumpet with bitter orange marmalade. The cranberry, toasted almond, Earl Grey-infused scone and strawberry jam accompaniment for the baguette are equally enticing. There is a yummy Nutella side and a perfectly balanced lemon curd. I willingly dive for salted caramel at the bottom of the yogurt crème brûlée. The tower highlight is the crushed butter cookie (pailleté feuilletine) and peanut butter in the white saucer. The chef, Gregory Chandler, prepared and artfully arranged the savory Gaufré : a light and fluffy waffle with candied onion, smoked salmon, chive and cream cheese. My Mish Mash is nice, although lacking salt even with the lardon. The manager Charles explains that aside for the baguette from Arhoma, everything is made fresh here. The strawberries are from a Charlevoix producer,provenance unknown. The lovely waitress Christine is ever patient and forgiving. I'd return for more before the baby is much older."

Regine Café serves up a fantastic brunch served in a quirky environment that reminds you of your weird aunt's home but with a touch of class. I went here on a Monday after my 3 hour early morning lecture because I had a long gap until my next class, and there was still a wait time. Upon being seated at the bar, I was given a sample shot of one of their smoothies and loved how it tasted. I then ordered the blackberry grapefruit smoothie and the Champi - their version of eggs Benedict on bread with Le Soucier cheese and mushrooms and potatoes and fruit on the side. The blackberry grapefruit smoothie tasted fresh with the flavor of each ingredient coming through, and I liked how they focused on the natural sweetness of the fruits themselves rather than adding lots of sugar. The Champi was also great and I loved how the bite of the cheese contrasted with the silky smooth poached eggs; in addition, the mushrooms were so flavorful and juicy and there were lots of it, which I loved. The only part I didn't really care for much were the potatoes as I'm not quite sure what they were trying to do with them. It just seemed like an overall dryer version of mashed potatoes which was slightly underwhelming, but everything else (including the fruit) made up for it. By the time I was finished, I was positively stuffed and barely able to walk as the food coma was way too real haha.I will be back sometime because I noticed that they have a duck confit omelette, and good omelettes and duck meat are two of my favorite things. Unfortunately, my budget wasn't that accommodating that day and I had already saved up money to go there in the first place as it is on the slightly more expensive side when it comes to brunch restaurants. The pastries also look amazing, but knowing how much food they give you, I might have to make two more trips to try everything I want to try. It's never a bad thing though!"

There was line up but fortunately the wait wasn't too long. Line ups are usually a good sign for yummy things to come.The decor is wonderful, a mix of victorian chic and modern industrialism. In the background you can hear the faint sound of oldies' music. I'm in love already. The menu is only 1 page-long but quite varied and printed playfully on a paper placemat. I personally love short menus because (usually) the kitchen can focus on making things right.  I ordered a refreshing mimosa to which our friendly and knowlegeable waitress brought us complimentary samples of the ""cocktail du jour"" which was a delicious blend of orange and peach juice and a hint of basil. For the main event I chose the special of the day which was decadent plate of duck confit, scalloped potatoes with bacon, caramelized onions and cheese all accompanied by a poached egg, fresh salad of baby spinach, fennel and yellow beets with a tasty crouton and heavenly homemade orange marmelade. U-n-b-e-l-e-i-v-a-b-l-e! This is definitely not your Chez Cora brunch fare. Plus everything is beautifully presented. Somehow I even managed to fit in an order of churros with chocolate cayenne pepper sauce. Sweet, delectable, non greasy, cinnamon-sugared plate of happiness :)I will definitely come back here again. Even if I have to brave a blizzard, it's that good!"

They have lemon and orange water for people who are waiting outside. Their decor is very classic. We ordered scotch egg and chef choice.

I will try other dishes next time."

Nicely decorated atmosphere with mismatched damask-y chairs and curly swirls. The walls are painted a sombre black, but it just makes the atmosphere more plush. Get here early and get in line. You want to be in the first wave of brunch seating. Make sure your whole party is present or you may not be seated... I'm on a diet so did not go all out with food but if you want to go all out, there are certainly delicious options. Add some beer + orange juice mix as well as a Bailey's Coffee and you're all set. Bread was a bit tough, but maybe it had been toasted. I just had 1 bite though since I'm on the low-carb diet phase. Service was excellent and food came out very quickly. I never felt rushed during the meal - which is a good thing. I was a bit concerned with the growing line outside that we would be herded in and out like sheep to increase the turnover. No, that did not happen. We still had time to chat and do the brunch-time-linger.Oh - the meal started with this pleasant carrot juice shot. Very nice touch. I love it when there are little details like that during meals."

So of course we didn't dine there).  I can understand in a way why they would because of the small space and possibility of blocking the walkways, but just be aware if you're planning on visiting montreal with a baby.The food was great!  The price was decent for the big serving.  Presentation was really cute as well.  Our server, Veronique, was friendly and attentive.  She asked right away whether we spoke french or english, and that was really appreciated, and she did a great job explaining the menu to us.  There was a complimentary shot-size of beet/apple juice, which was refrehing.  I ordered the homemade iced tea and asked it to be sweetened.  It had pom arils and was also refreshing.  I also ordered the mish mash bc the omelet of the day had salmon.  I wished there was more salmon, but it was filling.  It was served with 2 crostinis, fruit bowl, and one of the best mashed potatoes ever (chunky and perfectly cooked and seasoned to my taste).  I tried a friend's duck confit grilled cheese, which I highly recommend.  My other friend had the champi with the scotch egg.  the scotch egg was perfect!  If you don't like mushrooms though, you might be overwhelmed by the hefty amount.  I like them personally.  The french toast was on point.  I might be wrong, but the bread they used looked like brioche.  It was thick and dense and perfect with the thick sugary sauce served with it.  I also tried a friend's creme brûlée yogurt.  It's a good idea, but it's basically yogurt with sugar that was brûléed on top.  Overall, I recommend this place.  For a monday brunch, it was a busy place and from the time we got thre to the time we left, there was a line.  safer to have a reservation."

We ordered the 3 tiered $20 assortment of pastries to share and it was just ok, probably wouldn't order it again (2/3 of the tier was basically bread in different forms). The Sucre Sale (pulled pork on french toast) was ok. If you do come, I highly recommend you come before 10am. We arrived at 1pm and had to wait an hour in line to get a spot."

This seemed like a popular local place for brunch so it was packed and my boyfriend and I waited around 40 minutes to be seated. I really liked the decor and the pastries looked really good. Service was spotty; had to get a different waiter to see what was going on with our order because we could never flag down our original waiter.I ordered the grilled cheese with duck confit (extra) and a fruit smoothie while my boyfriend ordered a moccachino and a croissant sandwich with eggs, ham, aged cheddar and spinach sauce.I enjoyed my sandwich but not my fruit smoothie (sour as if unripe fruits were used) and my boyfriend enjoyed his mocca but not so much his sandwich. He wasn't full after his meal so if you tend to have a bigger appetite I'd say go somewhere else.Good brunch but not worth going out of the way and waiting in line for. Not ideal for big groups if you wanted to get seated quickly so I would say to be seated comfortably and quickly you shouldn't be a group bigger than 4."

The menu is pretty diversified with a lot of different options going from American breakfast to french staples, all with a twist from Montréal. We had the Doré (sweet french toasts) which were pretty well executed and the Gruau (porridge/oatmeal) that was served with a super nice little peanut crunch . The portions are huge for what you pay and the food is pretty good. I wish it wasn't as sweet as it is.... this stuff is very high in sugar. Overall really nice experience with caring staff.

I'm a great lover of brunch restaurants and this one totally is worth it. Loved: The shooter-type homemade juice given to us as soon as seated, the original choices on the menu, the cute presentation of the dishes, the rather fast service (note: the restaurant was half full upon arrival).However, it felt like the place is probably very crowded on weekends as there was already a line up at 9:30. Also, as soon as we were done eating, we felt rushed by the waitress, bringing the bill immediately and suggesting we pay by card. Once paid we felt it was time for us to leave. Probably a downside of crowded places."

The corn flour waffles with gravlax (or is it smoked trout?) is to die for. I had it at least 5 times and it was always super good. Consistency is the key. Two things I didn't like: I once tried their grilled cheese and I was horribly disappointed. Hard and dry. The orange or grapefruit juice is coming from those 1$ Oasis box. And they make you pay 3.5$ if I remember well... But overall it's a great brunch place and I will continue to go there during my visits in Montreal."

We got there & waited in line for about half an hour.  It started to rain & the staff came out with umbrellas while we were waiting. When our table was ready,  we got in the restaurant & to my surprise  it felt like I was in Paris at a cafe bistro with vintage decor.  The staff had a parisian accent. We chose different dishes  (refer to the pics) everything was delicious & colorful.  I tasted each dish & was satisfied with the marriage of flavors of the various dishes. The one I  wasn't to impressed with was my dish. I was expecting to live an experience like the other dishes I tasted but was disappointed.  I found the Cheddar lacked flavors with the mango chutney & did not have enough caramelized onions. The rest were all great dishes with exciting flavors. I definitely invite you to come & taste the food at Regine, you will love the place & the staff. The food is just different & overall EXCELLENT!

We had to wait about 15 minutes outside for a table , pretty quick and we had heaters to warm us up. Very nice staff, amazing service. I took the Champi breakfast . It was tasty not your regular boring breakfast . Original and refreshing. Great latte but too small. Not enough fruits in the breakfast plate. Beside that all was perfect! I would definitely go back again."

The dishes are original and gorgeous, the staff is very kind, extremely helpful and accommodating (food allergies here) and never snob.  After eating at that kind of breakfast place, I really dont see why I would eat breakfast in a chain of restaurants. We had the scone with marmelade and lemon cream, the corn waffles with gravlax and finally the mish mash (scrambled eggs of the day). The espresso and the spicy hot chocolate were really good. And also the little sample of their daily juice was a nice touch. Definitely a must when in Montreal!"

Et prix élevé pour mon budget moyen."
/user_details?userid=sOL82Hbfza89tKL6m_wBJA,Marie H V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Love the place! When we got there around 11am on a Sunday, the line up was going all the way to the corner of the street. We had to wait about 20-25 minutes to get a table for two people (which is a shorter wait than I expected--the place actually has a good number of tables). Well worth the wait: the food was delicious. I had the croissant with egg and cheese in it, and topped with spinach sauce. Also tried the sides of crumpet and home-made chocolate spread (so good!), and the scones with mascarpone and marmelade. Delicious! The decor is pretty and clean. We had a table right by the window; great spot. Good service; they made us feel that it was OK to hang around to chat even when we were done eating. Can't wait to go back!"

We had a hard time on deciding what to order, and finally landed on the Pain Perdu (French toast with almonds and prunes compote) and Mish Mash (omelette of the day, in a pan), both were very good, fresh ingredients cooked just right. Though the coffee and grapefruit juice could be skipped, they were just so-so. Another must-try specialty is the Yogourt brule, it has the texture of a Creme brulee, but without the sweetness and calories, very creative dish."

There is a wait time about 20-30 minutes usually. Cute decor feels retro. They offer free ""hot chocolate"" type shots to start which is nice. I ordered their yogurt and my husband has the grilled cheese with duck. I love my plate as well as their coffee. The grilled cheese lacked some cheese and only had duck in the middle and a small portion. Id go back to try different things. The staff is friendly. Still a decent breakfast place compared to a lot"

/user_details?userid=EWGfT663blb2CoML9KdEfw,Julie G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My favourite brunch place in the city, and I've been to many! It always exceeds my expectations. It's a little pricey for brunch, but it's definitely worth it. Last time I went, I had the granola, and couldn't believe how delicious and beautifully presented it was. The grilled cheese is also fantastic."

Food (pork) not overly salt-saturated, and very fresh and fabulous plating. So worth the hour wait outside in -7 degree cold. Really!"

I went here for brunch with my boyfriend while visiting Montreal because we were recommended to go here by a chef in Montreal who knows the owner. This place has such a cool and hip environment and so many delicious and unique options on their menu. I had the hardest time deciding what to get because I waned it all! They really did an amazing job making our food and such a great presentation they way the food is delivered. It is a fun and fancy experience, but also a relaxed and chill place at the same time. I highly recommend eating here, so delicious!!!!!!"
