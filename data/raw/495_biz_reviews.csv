Service is very friendly and fast and with covid the inside has plexiglass between the tables and the patio is more spaced out. I opted to sit outside since it wasn't raining and it looked a bit safer since I knew I wouldn't be going inside. If you do have to go inside for the bathroom, masks are mandatory. Ordered the butter chicken and the saag paneer with rice and naan bread as sides and everything was so gooooood. Big quantities too, couldn't finish everything. The food is rich and warm and comforting."

This Indian fusion place offers an Indian inspired brunch menu and everything on the menu was tasty, albeit a bit heavy, but delicious and flavourful nevertheless.A must try is the fried chicken waffle. Might I say that it is the best one I've tried in my life! The butter chicken was delicious as well. We also tried their iced chai latte and the mango lassi. I highly recommend this place, one of my favourite brunch places in Mtl by far."
/user_details?userid=LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I was brought here by word of mouth from coworkers. We were 3 and split 2 mains, 2 rice, 3 naan, 1 veg side and 1 app. While the price borders being ""pricier"", the food itself was both incredibly well balanced and filling. Surprisingly we left with a lunch portion for 1 left over. Mushroom Tandoori: 2-4 people can split it, do it, was a great texture and the flavor was the most talked about part of the meal. We are excited to return for what looks to be an even better brunch menu.Malai Kofta: Very nice texture but my layman's palate didn't find the flavor in this oneButter Chicken: the good thick kind of sauceVeal Vindaloo: very tasty, but not in any way spicy - definitely ask if you want it spicy, was still flavorful but we had chosen it to bring the heat."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here for the brunch. The food was delicious, especially the chicken and waffle. It was juicy and crispy. The butter chicken bene was also good, but 24$ is a bit pricey for the amount of chicken you get. The indian brunch was very flavorful. The restaurant is a few blocks from metro mont-royal. It's clean and cozy and the staff are nice. Would definitely come back."
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"We finally decided to try India Rosa, after passing by it everyday during our daily walks!! The interior is absolutely beautiful! Every time I would pass by, I would excitedly mention to my husband how nice it is to finally have fine dining restaurants for South Asian food in Montreal. I decided to order a Mango Lassi and Indian Brunch. The Indian Brunch includes a Paratha, Zeera Potatoes, Egg, Sautéed Kebeb and Raita. I received the food and mentioned the kebab to the server who said it was mixed with the Eggs, which it wasn't. The paratha was hard and didn't taste fresh, obvious in the photos attached. The Potatoes & lassi were good but overall the food quality and taste is average. For the experience we had, it is an over priced establishment."

We reserved for our three year anniversary and my husband made a reservation online and specifically told them that we decided to celebrate our anniversary there. The evening started off with some of the best drinks I've ever had and the bartender mike was just amazing and made a great impression. We were having fun! The food was excellent and we wanted more. Before we made it to dessert, we were politely to leave due to another reservation and were told ""all good things must come to an end"". Really?!? Well if they didn't want our money, so we left. Honestly, this was a big mistake on management. Thanks for the memory ..."

Verdict: Exceeded my expectations! I was pleasantly surprised by the good food and the amazing customer service. I tried their chicken biryani, amritsari fish and malai kofta! Actually enjoyed all of these flavourful dishes. Definitely recommend all of these. Will go back to try more items on their menu."

/user_details?userid=XtCh-nm_nFSOQ_YwLgm4Rg,Corinne B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The aesthetic and the fooooood will win your foodie's heart :). I really enjoyed the atmosphere it was not too loud, the waitress was very polite and gave us time to look through the menu and has attentive to our requests !!! I was debating between the chicken waffle and the butter chicken egg benedict syle. I ended up getting the chicken waffle and I did not regret AT ALL! The chicken was soft and crispy... it added that extra flavour of sweet and salty that I enjoy in most of my plate. I would suggest going to India Rosa in a small group or with your significant other the space is not big but it could get a decent group of people. My favourite part about the restaurant would be the rocking chairs if you are just two people it is PERFECT! * Very good mix of Indian food and north American cuisine* Cheers, Hope this helps,P.S. the bathroom is also clean!"
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"When India Rosa was opened newly, I had a major issue with the service as per my previous review. All the social media have been advertising India Rosa's brunch menu on the weekends, especially designed by the chef of Le Passé Composé (one of my favorite spot), I couldn't resist to come back to India Rosa.Impressively, the service had gotten better superbly. :AWe started with our brunch cocktails and drink. Mango Lassi was sweet and smooth : APaloma cocktail (tequila, grapefruit syrup, lime juice, soda and water) was heavenly. Right amount sourness and bittersweetness: A+Then our dishes arrivedChana Masala with egg poached, with side puri was very delicious. Perfect blend of spices with great aroma with this plate. The only issue were the carrots they were too long to cut: B+Eggs Benedict malai kofta, was good. The sauce was fanatic with pistachios. The smell was meditating. The crispy kales around it made this dish more extravagant. The brioche was a bit too big to finish though (carbs fill you too fast): B+The presentation of the food and drinks (especially drinks) were majestic: A+The restaurant is one most beautiful Indian restaurant in Montreal with the cage seats brings the decor into high level. : A+Because of the amazing brunch, my impression of India Rosa changed from 2 stars to 4 stars. I hope they continue with their service like this."

/user_details?userid=r0GLQAawvHXUd-xZow-fWQ,Christine M.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"We lucked out on a holiday Monday to find an available brunch table for 4 here (and a window table at that). It's not an inexpensive brunch menu - plates between $15 and $24, so we took our time deciding. It helped that the place was hopping and other plates were coming by, so we could get a sense of what to expect. We each settled on a different plate. Everyone liked what they had, flavours were great, textures varied and interesting. I got the chana masala dish, which came with fried naan. Only one little hitch for me - I was surprised when there was only one egg on top. I thought it was a mistake and asked the waiter. Nope, that's how it comes. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  It's ""oeuf chana masala"" not ""oeufs"". Seems a little skimpy to have a single egg on a $17 brunch plate. I'd come back for the originality, the flavours, and to try something else, but probably only on a special occasion."
/user_details?userid=mrru6hbeQLvagU4vkfuqmw,Jenny T.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Great music, and really cool vibe that makes it feel fancy, but it's totally cool to roll in there in totally casual gear.  Not a huge beer selection, but their Indian food is good.  I really like the regular naan that has a nice soft and fluffy texture.It's vegetarian and vegan friendly.  I really like their vegetarian samosas that come with a really nice what I think is a tamarind sauce underneath.  I could eat the entire appetizer dish myself.  My vegetarian friend really likes the saag paneer which is an Indian cheese in spinach.  I thought their butter chicken was delicious also.  Excellent service, very tentative.  And also very cool about us being anglophones."
/user_details?userid=sVV3wstSWCBdqVwK5AzqHw,Nisreen K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My husband took me here for my bday last week. To begin with the ambiance is very chic and modern. Love the decor. One could easily come here only for the drinks as the drink menu is bigger than the food menu. We made reservations for 730 and were promptly seated. My husband ordered the Halloween special drink- the pumpkin flambé. Once the waitress brought it over she made a comment saying ""I hope you like strong flavours"" I think my husband would have liked her to share this before he ordered the drink as she was right. There was way too much cinnamon in that drink. My husband returned the drink and they actually replaced it without any qualms. We ordered the amritsari fish and paneer tikka for starters. I loved the fish and the sauce had a nice creamy texture which I loved. My husband did make note that since it is a tapas restaurant it would be nice to get 4 pieces rather than the measly 3. The ingredients were definitely fresh and items not overcooked. The paneer was OK, but my husband enjoyed it.We took the chicken tikka masala and lamb korma for mains. It comes with basmati rice but we prefer having naan with our chicken tikka. The mains did not disappoint. Delicious and creamy! We were so stuffed. Overall I give it 4 stars because the waitress was just oh okay! We had to track her down for water refills and she wasn't aware of what certain items on the menu had for ingredients nor did she bother checking. For the price premium and the ambiance of this place I expect a better service. That being said, it didn't ruin our experience. I'd definitely go back."
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This location has been on my bucket list to check out- originally I thought it was a sister site to Lola Rosa because of its name, but I was wrong. The decor of this restaurant is lovely-a classic look to it. Although-an observation, I didn't find anything remotely ""Indian"" about in decor other than the cool elephant photo I was seated in front of. Mind you - authentic Indian restaurants are tacky and have dining tables for seating. The strong points of this place is the cocktail menu - the drinks are gorgeous and start at 12$ + , I tried the chai masala - that was a pretty cool cocktail but way too heavy on the cinnamon and nutmeg that flooded my drink. As for food- the dishes are not cheap and are good to share for 2 people. You will also have leftovers to take home- we ordered the shrimp masala 4/5 - this was a great dish, the shrimp like prawns were huge - we had at least 6 pieces and the seasoning was perfect. The second dish lost me -malai kofta 2/5 - maybe this was a twist on this dish but it looked like a large bowl of tapioca with potato patties swimming inside. The dish on its own was not to my liking but in combination with the shrimp masala -delightful. We had both dishes with naan 3$+ and rice.My bill was 37$ including tax (split between 2 people)- an affordable price range for the the amount of food we ordered. I loved the service, our waiter was very attentive and kept on checking up on us to see if everything was to our liking. However, more than an Indian restaurant I give 5 stars for an Indian cocktail bar and 3 as a restaurant."
/user_details?userid=vbSWvu2nzGoNl7ITTq3cMQ,Melissa Y.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"I was craving Indian and a good friend recommended this restaurant. It did not disappoint! Great vibe, awesome cocktails, and a nice patio area if you want to sit outside. Whenever I try an Indian restaurant for the first time, I like to order my staples- Samosas, Chana Masala, and naan bread. I like that the food was not salty and the flavors of the spices and ginger really came through. The tandoori salmon is always tricky for me- I rarely order salmon at restaurants because I like my salmon almost raw. This salmon was a little more on the dry side for me. Flavors were there though. The coriander sauce it comes with was amazing! Service was good. If I want to pick at something, I would say the tables are a little too close together for my liking."
/user_details?userid=X-_KbWOstBeSLw6rm9S56Q,Narendgie M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The reason why I'm giving 3 stars it's because I felt that the staff was putting pressure on us because they needed the table at 9 for another group. The place is small but very cozy. Nice atmosphere and decoration. Now let's talk about the food. With Montreal à Table 7th edition we had great services. Food is very tasty, I never had Indian food before and I didn't regret the choice. The spices are a lot different than what I'm used to. I'd give 5 stars for the dishes. However I wasn't amazed by the desert. I love sweets and according to my taste their deserts are very, like very sweet."
/user_details?userid=aDQggFDt8M6mF2Ysn1_JGA,Sharon S.,"Pickering, Canada",5 star rating,"This is my favourite restaurant in Montreal. I have never seen a more beautiful, modern and charming space for an indian restaurant. I was blown away by the food, interior and cocktails. The service we has was outstanding! I enjoyed a shared dinner with my family and friends. We stayed for some cocktails at the bar after and enjoyed the service the bartenders provided.Everyone here is extremely friendly, helpful and professional. I will definitely be returning and can't wait for my next experience there."

This was our first and last time."
/user_details?userid=YKm-0aMn46Yi0Re2lN1XRQ,Ivy L.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"Definitely the fanciest Indian restaurant I've ever been to! The seating is sooo comfy with all the cushions and the decor is so cute. Everything is clean as it can be. There's also outdoor seating available but without much sun protection. Each table is equipped with a real flower. Certainly a great setting for a date. The food was not bad. I took the lamb vindaloo on the dinner menu. It's supposed to be spicy but it wasn't at all for me. It didn't have as strong flavours considering it's Indian food too. The meat texture though was sooooo tender! Same goes for the chicken that my friend took. That was my favourite part of the dish. The lassi though was AMAZING. Great presentation and taste, super rich and great ratio of yogurt and mango.The service was great and the price was appropriate too. This restaurant would definitely deserve a 5++ star if the flavours were only a little stronger."
/user_details?userid=Ws-0XIZTKVfCcFPzUOcnpg,David O.,"Houston, TX",5 star rating,"OH MY GOD!!! I would give this place six stars if I could!!! Showed up without reservations but managed to get seated at the chef bar where we were able to watch all of the action. The chef was cooking all of the proteins on skewers in a tandoori oven which was very interesting to watch. And he was also baking the naan (fresh dough balls) in the oven. Staff was very courteous, knowledgeable, and on point. The food - the first night was chicken tandoori served with a coriander chutney that was to die for. I had shrimp masala and we ordered sides of naan, and basmati rice. A great, great meal!! The second night I had shrimp malai, and girlfriend had a different flavored chicken tandoori. Both accompanied again with basmati rice, and a cheese naan this time. Another great, great meal!!  Also has a great wine and cocktail list. Enjoy!!!"

The decor is fancy and the music is great. My only cons would be the place not being big enough and some of the menu items are way overpriced like 5$ for 3 mini samosas HELL NO.I feel like this is not the type of restaurant that indians would actually go to."
/user_details?userid=BfE7kke4fCfln0y97GIbAQ,Carolyn T.,"New Castle, DE",3 star rating,"The overall experience was good and the food was delicious. Though my discovery of Indian food is very recent, as an ethnic person, I also know enough to know that the chef held back on the flavour profiles to attract a more western clientele. I'm not quite sure why, as I believe Montrealers are very open to various types of cuisines and can appreciate ""real"" Indian food.Take for example the butter chicken. The sauce was very tomato-ey... Not what one would typically say about Butter chicken. Also the samosas were tiny, the ratio of dough to filling was off. The filling also lacked the typical spices you would find in a Samosa.Dont get me wrong, none of the food tasted bad, it just didn't taste authentic. It's a good place to take the uninitiated, but if you've had authentic Indian cuisine, this place may disappoint. And for the reviewers out there who say it's the best Indian food in town... They obviously haven't had ""real"" Indian food..."
/user_details?userid=EJ5ybtY1FqieuS22LHbT1w,Claire L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I REALLY enjoyed the food here!! Mains are $19 and lots of fun naan to choose from ($4-6). I got butter chicken (I know it's very typical...) but let me tell you they know what's up!!! It was delicious!!! My friend got a salad and was super happy with it as well. There is something for everyone! Ambiance was super cozy and well done...music was a bit odd (reggaeton) it definitely was distracting at times and didn't fit the vibe.I really enjoy that you can easily reserve online here! Note that they have 3 services...5pm, 7pm, 9pm... i would suggest that they offer more services, as most people desire to dine 7-8:30 on the weekends.Main negatives are that the wine is a bit overpriced (an 8oz glass was 18$...) Service was slow, but I didn't mind particularly because you can have a nice long dinner with friends without being rushed out :)"
/user_details?userid=YiCuQ2EpEy-uW-pkXb6cDA,Annshu S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Soooo good! And you should take my word for it since I'm an Indian & really picky about Indian food. According to my husband & me, this is hands down the best Indian restaurant in Montreal. The food is really authentic, just the kind you get in Indian restaurants in India. We ordered zaffrani chicken tandoori, chicken biryani & chicken tikka masala. The chicken tandoori and biryani were very flavorful, just the way they should be. Chicken tikka masala was really nice too, but maybe a little spicy for Canadian palate.Overall, I loved this restaurant. Finally we have a decent Indian restaurant in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=6r-D64gdm5xSm8V5V3iIcQ,D F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I recently dined here on a Sunday evening with a friend; it was her first time eating at this restaurant, and I had already been here several times, and was impressed with the food, ambiance, and service. This time, the food and ambiance were stellar as usual. I have attached photos of the food and the cocktail I had, the mademoiselle Rosa, which was expertly prepared and presented as all their cocktails are. The chicken tandoori was tender, full of flavour, and presented with a delicious cilantro chutney. The black lentils were creamy and beautifully spiced. Vegetable samosas were perfectly spiced and surrounded with a beautifully flaky, buttery crust. We shared a cheese naan and a Paratha, a buttery layered naan, both of which were perfect for mopping up the delicious lentils and bits of chicken. We also shared onion bhajis, which were crisp and bursting with onions and spices. The music is somewhat loud and club-like, but not so much that you have to shout.The only thing that brought the experience from a 5 down to a three star rating was that as soon as we finished our food, the hostess informed us that our table was needed to add to a group of other tables to accommodate a party of 8. She said service is limited to two hours, however we arrived at 7PM, and this was at around 835PM, plus it was just a bit abrupt. She was somewhat apologetic and told us we could sit at the bar or move to a different table, but there were no other tables for two inside and we did not feel like sitting outside, did not feel like having more drinks, and were frankly so discomforted that we just decided to leave. It really felt like a slap in the face, considering it was barely an hour and a half into the supposed ""two-hour service,"" and we ordered and tipped generously. The bottom line is, if you are looking for a place with great cocktails, a beautifully decorated environment, and amazing Indian food, to come and either sit at the bar or share a few drinks and small plates with friends on a quick stopover before heading someplace else, then India Rosa is perfect. However, it is definitely NOT a place for a leisurely, relaxed meal and lingering conversation."

Of course you can get some excellente indian food for cheaper than that but you go to India Rosa for the whole experience.I only have 2 littles cons:- The service was long. I received my cocktail after 20 mins and the restaurant was almost empty. And I had to wait another 25 mins to get my 2 little appetizer- Staff was polite but not enthousiast

No big deal right? Really normal request-- wrong. I get completely harnessed about it and told they would not refund my order even though I offers to return the wrong order on my own time. The take out person was originally,I'm so sorry that was my fault- the she tells me her manger won't allow a refund if you bring the wrong order back. So I get the manager on the phone- then it's all yes I'll refund you and give you free right order! Well thanks but no thanks after this incompetence by the staff.

It may not give you what you craved for as an authentic Indian food expérience, but it is definitely delicious and the impressive cocktail menu and nice seating have outshined its popular neighbour next door (Rouge Gorge).

The breads were probably slightly steeply priced but for the ambiance and the quality we got, we were abunch of happy campers! The ambiance is amazing, just how we have in New Delhi, India !!Happening and subtle at the same time.Now the only con was, the curries were served a bit cold and that for me was a bit put off!

There seemed to be a number of free tables that stayed that way all evening, rarely being occupied by some guests who made reservations but the place was very full and didn't have room for many people. We ordered the onion bahji to start, which came with 4 pieces and a tamarind chutney. Totally normal, nothing fancy or innovative here, could have actually used a little more salt. Next, I ordered a mango lassi which had some ice at the bottom of the glass, leaving me feeling a bit ripped off for the $6 price tag (non-alcoholic). After, our food arrived,  lamb vindaloo, hariyali chicken, chicken korma, and malai kofta, along with 2 regular naan and 1 garlic naan. Our meals also came with rice, but we all prefer to eat with bread. Overall, the food was pretty disappointing, the korma and kofta tasted oddly similar, everything had some sweet notes to it, and the vindaloo was not very spicy- also stained my fingers bright red from one bite! The hariyali chicken was tender yet pretty flavorless. The price tag at this place is steep, each naan was small and around $3.50-$4.50! Unheard of for a true Desi, but then again this restaurant was absolutely filled with white people, we were the only non-white table in the entire place. The bill came out to about $30 a person before tip and for the quality and quantity of the food, I wouldn't recommend it. I think they are catering to a hipster Quebecois audience and really dropping the ball on their cuisine. In my opinion, if you want a fine dining experience for Indian, make the trek to St Henri and eat at Rasoi instead."
/user_details?userid=l1YNu_7kZbXGbvoAfVxBqQ,Stephen C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"2018/08/28 Dinner After being contacted by the management team and asked to give them a second chance, we did as I believe everyone should be given a second chance, especially with conditions in the original review.  India Rosa gains one star, now bringing the review to four. The main points are as follow: -Food and cocktails were just as excellent as the first time we went. The cocktails add a nice touch that differentiates this Indian restaurant and any other that I have been to.-We were served by a manager who knew about our discontentment. -The air ducts were still dripping due to condensation. -The restaurant was busy and the experience still enjoyable.  Overall, we appreciated the feedback from the management team and we will be back again to India Rosa. 2018/08/14 Dinner 19:00  Positive points:  -The cocktails were really good. When I saw who was behind the menu, I knew it was going to be great.  -Food wise, it tasted really good.  -The restaurant itself looks great.  -The location is great.  Negative points:  -The service was horrendous! Not because of the waitress who had to do the whole restaurant, which was filled, by herself, but due to the fact that the management team understaffed the whole place. The cocktails took long to get to our table even though I could see that they were already made and sitting on the counter. The waitress took a while before bringing our cocktails, taking our food orders, bringing the food and taking a second drinks order. Everything took way too long than it should. One of our party members went to management to complain. The waitress and busgirl came to us quickly, gave us water and such. She asked one of our party members if there was a problem after hearing a comment about herself. That said party member replied, in my opinion considering I have worked in the business, in an improper way to address the issue at hand that was mostly out of the waitress control. Of course the waitress could of said sorry and explained the situation. Those words never came out clearly as they should of had. Most would of been at ease with that. We could see what was going wrong from the get-go.  -No staff member had a smile beside the bartender and one member of the management team who greeted us out at the end of our meal.  -The waitress told us she quit the job.  -The air conducts were dripping water on our party members sitting against the wall due to the condensation.  -Prices are high for the portions served. I can get a better quality/price option in an older Indian staple institution in Montreal.  -The restaurant which is rather new (about 2 months old), already have their menus damaged and stained. They already require a replacement. For the money they will spend if they decide to do so, they could of laminated every single one of them, clean them up at the end of every shift and voilà! Clean menus for the next day. Conclusion:  -There is much room for improvement. The location is great and the cocktails gets you going on a great foundation. If I ever come back, I am sitting at the bar where I believe we would of got a better service."
/user_details?userid=lLFfZ0SevK5W1ci4BSYpHg,Aliea J.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is legit! I've found it hard since living in Montreal to find very good Indian food, I can be pretty picky, but this place has won me over. This is the second time I've been back in a week and I leave satisfied and happy. The ambiance is cool, relaxed and funky, and service is warm and inviting. But more importantly, the food: the smell, the taste...everything we ordered was so flavourful! We started off with a couple of delicious cocktails and dal soup. For our main we enjoyed the lamb vindaloo, and I haven't had good vindaloo in ages, so I was impressed. Plus we had the chicken biriyani...oh my goodness yum! Portions are well sized too, so you will get full before you're done, which is why I stopped halfway and took it to go. When I saw they had ras malai I couldn't resist, it's one of my all time fav desserts. So yeah, I def recommend this place. Lucky that it's not far from me too."
/user_details?userid=Zq8vdMhqkdMvS7cWpj-K5Q,Abigail C.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,Food and location was great! I loved the interior design of the place... very rustic but contemporary. Ordered the samosas and malai kofta which were both delicious. Service was fast and the waitress was kind to help with translations to English. Overall a wonderful experience.. I definitely would go back!

The place is elegant yet not overly formal. It had a nice ambiance - good for groups looking for a place to get together or for couples looking for a nice night out. Cocktails looked amazing!"

/user_details?userid=WTNu4VYn-EBhuvLPaU0gIg,Susie S.,"Clearwater, FL",5 star rating,I went for the first time this evening. Got there around 8:30 and it was very busy. Didn't have to wait but it was full. The server was prompt and attentive but the food did come out slowly and I was getting hangry.... first bite and everything melted away to absolute bliss! Did I make all the right choices... probably not! I think everything on the menu is beautifully prepared and served and their signature creamy mint/cilantro/yogurt sauce could be eaten straight! Loved every moment and will be back soon and frequently!!!!!
/user_details?userid=Vg0LCgKlYOgnFet_6C3U3w,Kirstin T.,"Fenton Township, MI",5 star rating,The Food here was excellent.   Started with the maharaja cocktail that was wonderful and some dishes to share - vegetarian samosas and onion Bahji.   Both were very good and served with a wonderful sauce.   We also had garlic naan which was fresh and hot with fresh roasted garlic.   The dal tarka (green lentil soup) was also delicious.   The service was also good.  We would definitely eat here again.
/user_details?userid=8KdoTFdUYBi_RfpXu_zAaA,Collin S.,"12ème arr., Paris, France",4 star rating,"A authentic high quality Indian Restaurant with such drop-dead gorgeous intérieur is a great addition to Mont Royal Avenue. We had a really nice evening with great service, even though it was on the slower side, which is understandable on a Friday night.Cocktails I found extremely expensive for the fact that they are made up of pretty standard liquors, also they are quite on sweet side. I'd rather recommend the Mango Lassi, which was amazing.The Onion Bajji were good but nothing spectacular and the Samosa were plain boring.The Naans were great but they either mixed up our order or the cheese was non existent. The Biryani was one of the better ones I had so far, just be aware that it is pretty spicy. The Lamp Curry was great and the Butter Chicken was just the rich and creamy goodness one expects, however it was unreasonably stingy with the quantity of chicken pieces for a dish that's supposed to be shared.Overall we had a nice evening, however we can't say that we walked home blown away by our experience but maybe that's due to our high expectations after reading all the exclusively positive reviews."
