We ordered on their app and the order was just being packed when I walked in . Less then 20 minute . The Ramen chicken soup was very tasty and even came with an egg .the dumplings were very tasty but the sauce was absorbed in the paper box . We order 2 different karate chicken . The hot spicy was amazing and the original was good.  This was a great meal and we will sure be back"
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Excellent and safe service by the staff. I really liked that they take our names and phone numbers at the entrance in case of a positive case breaks in. The staff is friendly and helpful. During our food orders, our waitress recommended us their Japanese soft drink, which was delicious and bit sweet. It's called ramune. Also, when you buy the soft drink, 50 cents are deposited in Montreal Children's Hospital foundation (my pride, since I work there). We enjoyed thoroughly our dishes. We started with vegetarian gyozas, then followed with vegetarian ramen for me, and my sister had spicy pork ramen. Each bowl was humongous, and it fills you easily. Therefore, we decided to share our desert, and we had a very very succulent matcha cheesecake. The service, and the food were excellent, and the price was very reasonable. All this, cost us about 50$. Recommended."

/user_details?userid=Jh8dqs5Rt345_CCZme749Q,Christina J.,"Hamden, CT",2 star rating,"What bland and disappointing ramen for all the hype. I got the original chicken ramen with veggies and my boyfriend got pork original with chiki chiki don. The chiki chiki don was cold and the pork broth tasted like instant ramen mix. The chashu was rubbery and chewy. It was painful seeing my boyfriend try to eat the pork. In terms of the chicken ramen, the chicken was just plain boiled chicken without any seasoning. The broth was so yellow like the maruchan instant chicken ramen mix and was so bland I left a lot of my food. The only decent thing was the egg, which wasn't even cut in half like traditional ramen. Would never return. I normally eat pretty bland food and this was on a whole new level of bland I didn't think was possible.The only redeeming quality was how friendly the staff was and the ambience of the restaurant. The location is a bit away from central Montreal."

Staff is very friendly and inviting and the food is good. The tables are quite small though and the chairs have no backs, though there is a coat rack for putting your stuff. I've been to this location before, about a year ago, and I loved their ramen. It was amazing - the thick broth, the perfectly cooked egg with the golden semi liquid yolk, and the thick charred slab of pork belly. Unfortunately the ramen did not live up to my expectations this time. The broth is still very good, being thick and creamy, with fat and gelatin sticking to your lips with every sip. The thick noodles are plesantly bouncy and not overcooked. The pork was different this time - it was 2 thin paltry slices of pork shoulder instead, without the beautiful maillard reaction of charring. The egg was slightly overcooked and did not seem to be marinated and tasted quite plain, which was disappointing. My friend got the chicken kaarage ramen with thin noodles. I tried the broth and it was definitely strong in chicken flavour and very good. We shared gyoza and takoyaki, which were predictably good. I appreciate how they used real bonito flakes foe the takoyaki. The ramen was pretty filling and prices are affordable. My friend didn't finish hers, and got the rest packed - they have plastic tubs that seal well and can be reheated, so free tupperware, haha.I really appreciated their washrooms! They were clean and really nice (actual bathrooms, not just stalls) with even mouthwash dispensers and toothpicks to help you get rid of your porky breath. Service was pretty quick and pleasant, with our food coming fairly fast, though we did have to wait a while for the bill."

I understand maybe some people are picky about saltiness so with that being said, it would've been nice if they have condiments at each table so customers can add to their own liking.I must say their original chicken karaage was surprisingly HUGE but still tasty. They have a good array of garnishes to add on to your ramen and you have your choice of thick or thin noodles. Good enthusiastic service!"

/user_details?userid=d2zFGElcpGTFmnrbimBG9g,J A.,"Oviedo, FL",5 star rating,"Wow!  Delicious traditional thin ramen with the original chicken. Amazing. Hot and delicious. Well cooked and really hit the spot. Very good flavor. Chicken cuts were very juicy. Came with a boiled egg which I usually am not a fan of. Wife insisted I try it and I was pleasantly surprised. Slightly soft boiled. Added flavor and a textural contrast. My favorite was the nori which added a savory element. Just perfect. My wife had the original pork which came with a cut of pork belly. This broth was slightly creamy. Again well done and delicious. Between the two, I prefer the chicken. You absolutely cannot miss the crispy fried chicken! The crispy skin just melts in your mouth. Have with either the  mayo or the spicy version. Both sauces hit the spot."
/user_details?userid=M7vDDzoPNQDN2FdTcwCq4A,Eric W.,"Hartford, CT",5 star rating,"In Montreal for quite a few weeks on business and this will be the first dinner we have here! This place is nearby to our hotel and with an excellent rating so why not stop here? Here's how it went...Atmosphere/Appearance: With the weather as good as it's been we HAD to sit outside right on the big concrete patio. There were quite a few people who had the same idea, but luckily we didn't have to share our big picnic table with anyone else (which would've been the case if necessary). It was quite peaceful actually.Service: Brian was freaking awesome. He spoke great English (Canadian French is the primary language spoken here), was very sweet, knowledgeable, took great care of us and made excellent recommendations. Even when his shift ended and had to leave us his replacement was just as awesome.Food: My coworkers and I split a few appetizers so I had the chance to try a few things. The edamame are always excellent. Warm, healthy and salty. The Takoyaki is an order of deep fried octopus balls served with tonkatsu sauce, mayo, bonito flakes (which makes the food look alive because they're so thin that almost any air movement makes them wave) and aonori. These were not my favorite because the octopus had a fishy taste, but I have to live on the edge, right?! The Age Gyoza are deep fried pork dumplings served with a sweet chili sauce. They were pretty good, but nothing too-too crazy. Next up was the ""Original Karaage"" which was basically fried chicken served with a garlic mayonnaise. I was not a fan. Now for my entree! They're featuring a Roast Beef Ramen for the summer and I was ALL FOR IT! The thing is... it wasn't actually a ramen soup. Lol. More like ramen without the broth and with cold beef on top. Why they wanted to serve the beef cold, I don't know, but it was still very good. It was a good portion and along with everything else, I was certainly satisfied.Value: All prices are in $CAD. They offered a 5 ounce cold sake for only $3.90 on Mondays! I mean, something like that. Lol. I was only allowed to get 1 at that price, but my next one was still only $6.00. The Age Gyoza was $4.50. Edamame was $4.50. Original Karaage was $7.00. The Takoyaki was $5.50. My ramen entree was $15.99. The prices here are really good. You can get a lot of really GOOD food for not so much money. That's all we really want out of life, right?! Lol.I'd absolutely come back here if there weren't 3,920 other awesome restaurants to try while I'm in town. Lol. Come check this place out, the reviews are pretty accurate."
/user_details?userid=pLloOwQ2MNgjF9VwkUxLoQ,Kathryn B.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,Kinton Ramen is very cute and nicely decorated. It was filled with hipsters and Millennials and definitely gave us good vibes and made us excited to try their Ramen. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Original Pork Ramen. It was okay. The broth and meat were lacking flavor which is what makes really good ramen so that was quite disappointing. I wouldn't order this ramen again but there were some other items on the menu that look good so I'd come back to try those!
/user_details?userid=lGBvmBDeIooqcrMwp1a1yg,Eugene W.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Delicious ramen and tsukumen. I got the pork original, which comes with a whole egg, two slices of pork, nori, and scallions. The pork was delicious and fatty. I appreciated the whole egg, which was nicely cooked. The broth was fantastic, and I finished the whole thing. I got the thick noodles, which had a great chew to them.The tsukumen was really good as well (though I think the ramen has the edge). The sauce/broth was tasty and light. The noodles were seasoned deliciously. The pork was just okay (although I guess there is a limit to how good you can make cold meat). The tsukumen is a great, light meal for a hot summer day."

/user_details?userid=kX-Kf6fnqg-lRT_a1zhMLA,Nikita K.,"Anjou, Canada",5 star rating,"Hands down the pork miso ramen is the best Ramen that we've got here in Montreal. I've tried ALL the other ramens in this restaurant (including the one's offered during specific seasons and weeks), but nothing beats the pork miso one (Not to bash on the other one's, they're also good, but cmon, what's a ramen without pork broth???) I've gone to many other places in Montreal which specialize in making ramens (I don't want to prevent people from going to these other places, since they're also good, so I'll leave out their names), but I really can't emphasize enough how much this place is a must go. Putting aside how chill the atmosphere is, I'm literally in love with the food, and it's what pushes me to continuously return to this restaurant over and over again. If you're in for a treat, leave aside the appetizers, I find them to be over expensive for the actual size that's offered.Sincerely,An amateur ramen-ista"

I took the shibire mazemen (monthly special), the homemade lemonade and my boyfriend took the fried pork ramen with a miso base. It didn't take long to come and the staff were super friendly! The monthly special was AMAZING! My favorite ramen from there! (So sad it's their monthly special ) My boyfriend's ramen was also delicious and so was the lemonade. The bathrooms were clean and had mouthwash. Still thinking about that ramen  ----------------Je suis allée à Kinton Ramen à 2pm un samedi avec mon copain.

Le shibire mazemen était DÉLICIEUX! Mon préféré jusqu'à date! (Tellement triste qu'il est juste disponible ce mois-ci ) Le ramen de mon copain et la limonade était aussi bonne.

We walked in last night at 830 or so and were greeted by a full staff saying something in japanese which made it feel very authentic! we were seated and took a look at the menu and decided to get an order of the takoyaki and two orders of the original pork ramen with thin noodles for both. the place has a very hip and modern feel to it and is very well lit. they also have a small outdoor seating area in the front. i loved that the kitchen was open so you could see the cooks preparing your ramen. the takoyaki was just okay in my opinion. nothing to write home about. i wish it had a little more pieces of octopus inside as i ate one that had only consisted of one small piece of octopus. the ramen was very good! the soup was super flavorful and the pork was unbelievably tender and tasted amazing! the egg wasn't that special, we've had better but it didn't really affect how much we enjoyed the dish as a whole. definitely would go back again! i wanna try their karrage ramen!"

Pork Spicy Garlic Ramen has a whole scoop of raw minced garlic on top. I thought it would be too strong, but the hot broth cooks it just enough when you mix it in. I should have added a soy egg.

We had an order of kaarage chicken to share and it came out piping hot and crispy. Wish Kinton Ramen did more with the dipping mayo though. It was just plain mayo. I ordered their original salt based ramen w/ thin noodles and it's one of the better bowls of ramen I've had - Rich creamy broth, but didn't feel or taste heavy at all. That's hard to find. Perfectly cooked chashu, and a seasoned egg beyond perfection. My fiance ordered the spicy ramen and the spiciness and sourness was a bit overpowering but still a good bowl of ramen nonetheless."
/user_details?userid=JmEji3_Tfo2__69aLLcLPA,Jing S.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,"Situated on bishop street, this little ramen shop is one of the best in town in my opinion. The decor is similar to lot of modern Japanese restaurants; it has the old wood style feel to it. The restaurant is actually fairly new. The menu is a semi build your own ramen style. You choose your broth, then your noodle, and finally you add whatever you want as extras. It sounds complicated but it's pretty simple.I got some takoyaki as an entree; they are little octopus flour balls. It's kinda my go to for any Japanese restaurants. It tells me that if their takoyaki is good; the food might be pretty authentic.I got the spicy garlic pork ramen. You have to like garlic because it is very garlicky. I loved it. The broth was savoury, the noodles had a good chew on them and the pork was tender.I was disappointed that the egg and the seaweed were extras that you had to add yourself. Usually it's basic ingredients for ramen but whatever.They had vegetarian option with vegetable broth (I'm pretty sure it's even vegan but I'm not 100% sure). Overall great experience, great food; nothing like a good ramen soup on those winter days."

We ordered some edamame and the fried tofu nuggets to start. Hard to mess up edamame so of course that was good, but the fried tofu nuggets were delish! They come with a really good sweet chili sauce that was to die for. They really taste more like chicken than anything and definitely tasted homemade. For ramen I got the pork miso. It had thick noodles, bean sprouts scallions, sweet corn, garlic oil, and I ordered a seasoned egg as an extra. Really a delicious bowl of ramen. I was sad that I was too full to finish the whole thing because it was delicious. My friends all loved their ramen as well. The only reason this is 4 instead of 5 stars is because I felt it was a bit expensive, but well worth the price. Highly recommend this place to any and all ramen lovers!"

It's the sister of Kinka Izakaya on St Catherine's and Guy cause it's the same owner. The vibe and decor show that they're definitely related! The staff all greet you when you come in with words of welcome. The only other place where I'd ever been greeted by all the staff in a resto was at Bonaparte. The waiters are very polite and attentive. We ordered a bunch of tapas for a light and quick dinner starting with the Tako Wasabi.  It's a cute plate where you spoon a small amount of marinated octopus with wasabi stems into tiny sheets of nori, fold them over to form a little roll and eat it. It has a soft wasabi kick to it. It was a bit too salty though.Then we had the Goma Salad Ramen. The ramen was al dente with crispy lettuce, corn nibblets, etc. and a light sesame dressing. Topped with very finely shredded dried red bell peppers. Karaage Original was done just right. Light crispy seasoned exterior and tender interior. Tastes like Asian KFC :) Drizzled with lemon and served with garlic mayo on the side. Tofu Furai you must try. (Cause it rhymes)These 4 tofu nuggets tasted like juicy chicken nuggets!!  The sweet and sour spicy sauce and scallions all pair well with the tofu. Matcha cheese cake was light and smooth. Perfect to finish the meal.Tapas were whipped out in no time at all. We were able to eat and leave in less than an hour. Overall a nice place. I didn't try the traditional ramen so I'll have to go back!  Price wise, I find it a little expensive for the tapas, hence the four stars."

It's pretty much always busy, but the queue moves quickly. He likes the karaage ramen, which is only available on Mondays, so we end up just buying regular tonkotsu ramen and the karaage app to make our own! Broth is flavorful and noodles are appropriately chewy. Service is fast. Prices are not bad. We'll be back, I'm sure many times, in the future."

So of course on my vacation I had too look up a great spot to grab some noodles. I came across Kinton and loved the menu so I stopped in. I got the Age Gyoza, they're pan fried dumplings of goodness with what looked like a spicy mayo over the top. Delish. The I got the hot karaage, spicy and lovely. I'm not a huge fan of dark meat, but my travel companion loved them. I opted for the spicy tonkotsu ramen and added corn and nori to it. It came with thicc slices of chashu and a healthy portion of grated garlic. If you don't like too much garlic I recommend taking a little bit off. You get a choice of thick or thin noodles, I did thin. They were al dente and lovely. The broth was rich, creamy and had a slight spice. The decor is minimal and modern. Loved this place so much I had to go back a second time :^)"

Centrally located, it was within walking distance so we decided to give it a try - particularly because they are open late.  We were immediately greeted and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable. Being busy, it was difficult to hear above the commotion of other dinners. The seating was tight and a bit uncomfortable - requiring you to be cozy neighbors. We ordered the classic ramen - chicken for my spouse and pork for me. The broth is AMAZING. Seasoned egg was delicious and the udon noodles were tender. My pork belly could have been a bit crisper - to render down the fat, but it was still tasty. The beverage selection was great - I chose a pint of beer and some cold sake - a perfect accompaniment to the ramen. After we were finished, it took a bit of time for the staff to recognize us - as we wanted dessert and to pay. The matcha cheesecake was something to write home about - Creamy with delicate flavors.This is definitely worth a visit."

I came here with a group of friends, and despite it being busy on a Sunday night, we were seated pretty quick. They have monthly specials, which I decided to try the Nokou Tonkotsu Miso ramen (spicy pork miso broth, with pork flank, eggs, corn, scallions and spinach) along with their homemade lemonade. The food came out quickly and it did not disappoint. The ramen came in a generous portion, had a very rich and flavourful broth being not too spicy, the pork being very juicy and the egg cooked perfectly. I also loved their lemonade, which was very refreshing, pairing perfectly with such a rich ramen! Overall, the ramen is pretty good and their employees are very pleasant! Another great thing is that you have the choice to customize your ramen, from broth, toppings and noodles. However, it can get pretty pricey compared to other places, as some of the basic toppings must be added $. I would suggest going for their specials to get the best value, as well as their lemonade to refresh yourself!"

The ramen gods have listened and their answer is Kinton's Goma salad ramen. This is not your typical ramen and is more of a cold noodle dish. It's both refreshing and flavourful. I adore this ramen and it's such a unconvential take on a staple dish. The ramen comes with vegetables and corn and I've come back many times and have never changed my order. Also, the Tofu-furai is one of the best apps you can order. I would compare them to veganized (tofu/soy) based chicken nuggets. It's such a delightful treat and I order them any time I feel like indulging. The decor is very Japanese modern and the staff is super friendly. I've come back time and time again because I absolutely adore this one dish. The only reason it doesn't get a full five stars is because the vegetarian options are very limited.

For the empty bowls we earned a picture with the staff on their webpage and a stamp for the bonus program. Came back a month later and tried the original one. That one was a bit too blnt for me.

It came with 1.5x the normal amount of noodles and the dipping broth is made with anchovies and super savory and rich. Tons of flavor. I also tried the regular pork ramen which wasn't anything special, but solid. I'm not sure if it was a lunch-specific thing but they had a special where you could get a 32oz sapporo + an appetizer (we got two pieces of chicken karaage, but you could also get edamame or dumplings) for $10 which is a pretty sweet deal.

The spicy ramen is significantly spicier than the special but it was manageable.The two pieces of chashu were decent size. Most of my bowl consisted of large sized noodles.

I felt more in control of what was in my bowl. I ordered the thin noodle, extra seaweed and sweet corn, chicken broth original and it was delicious! (There isn't much difference between thick and thin noodle)The sizes are ginormous so I think it's unnecessary to order an appetizer/dessert.The broth was really excellent, tasted really comforting and filling. The extra seaweed and sweet didn't do much to heighten my enjoyment of the meal so I probably wouldn't get them again. The Egg that they put inside was ok but the taste was overshadowed by everything else going on so I can't really say if I enjoyed it.The only thing that bothered me was the seating. They have these tiny wooden stools that are very uncomfortable and all the tables are close so there's nowhere to put your bag without it getting in the way of someone.The restaurant has a real 'busy' feel. The employees are running around and they chant some directions to make sure everyone is aware of what they were doing. It wasn't that distracting but it might not be the best place for a nice quiet meal. Overall, I would go back but maybe just to take out."

The crispy outter layer of the chicken kaarage enticed my husband to take a big chewy bite, only to drop that chunk back into the basket when he saw the gray meat, outlined in red juices inside. BUT they still get 4 stars because they took it back and refried it to a safe-to-eat texture and color. And when done right, and dipped in that mayo that comes with it, it was delectable! Plus, the burnt miso and my spicy chicken ramen were deceptively delicious! While the latter was a creamy white broth that appeared wholesome and harmless, it packed the punch of the sliced jalepenos and the former, a seemingly seething orange, ended up being mild enough for our 4yo to enjoy (while waiting for the kaarage). This was our first taste of Montreal and it's setting our expectations (cautiously) high for the food scene here!"

I did enjoy the pork in toronto more, as it had a more caramelized roasted surface.Got the miso pork ramen, the thick noodles had the exact texture you want from ramen. Not soggy, just the right bounce. However, I wished they made a tonkotsu broth. It's more time consuming and harder to perfect but any good ramen place should have it. Also, the amount of toppings/noodle ratio was pretty good imo. Takoyaki was not piping hot when you bite into it (big no-no) , but flavour was great.Service was fast and friendly, atmosphere was comfortable enough despite being crowded on a Friday night.Prices could be a bit lower (we did get two appetizers and dessert...) but reasonable for the food you're getting I guess.

I've been 3 times mostly because my friends felt like it and because it is in a convenient location. This restaurant is pretty much similar to any other average ramen place in Montreal. The only cool things are their terrasse and their spicy choices, although I tried it once and don't feel like trying it again. They just don't bring out as good as a spicy feeling that I have with all other spicy food, because it's not spicy enough and have a thick feeling to the broth. I've had the spicy pork ramen and the original pork ramen. The pork pieces are pretty big, and the eggs are cooked just right, but that's about all that's somewhat special. I have tried my friend's cold ramen, and the broth tasted so awful that I would not want to have a more. It was kind of sour but not in a good way. I'm giving it a 4 but it's more of a 3.5. I'll round it up for the cute IG pictures that are always fun to take."

You can choose between thick or thin noodles which is a great option. My one negative would have to be they put a huge sheet of seaweed in it, far too much for my liking.

It's always easy to eat and satisfying.My lunch partner and I decided on Kinton because it is part of the Kinka family. I had the original with thin noodles and no other extras, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to eat a Kaarage (fried chicken) because it is my favourite dish at Kinka.Much like Kinka, the ambiance and the decor are really nice. It's an enjoyable place for a bite.The original ramen was OK - good, even, but not super exciting either. I thought it was a bit boring. For me, a good ramen needs to have a little ""kick"" of something. The original had none.The kaarage however is always delicious :-)I'd go back, but I'll try something else next time. Either the spicy, the shoyu or the miso, but my companion who had been before said that the shoyu was heavy on the salt. I'll have to find out for myself.To conclude: I've had better basic ramen in Montreal, but this one is all right. With a side of Kaarage, its a neat little lunch.Oh one thing I did want to mention: the menu makes it seem like the side dish (ton ton don or chiki chiki don) is included, but it's not. It's extra.

The food came quick, it looked exactly as I expected it to, and it was just as delicious as it is back home.Thinking further, one of my favourite things about Kinton is their consistency.

They have chicken, pork, or vegetarian broths, different styles of noodles, and different spice combinations. There are also additional toppings you can choose from for a cost of $1-$4/each. I had the 'original' chicken ramen - the toppings were just onions, scallions, a boiled egg, chicken breast for $13. It was very good, esp given it was a cold & windy day. Next time I think I would add on vegetables bc the bowl was pretty plain (though the broth was very good and had a lot of flavor). I ran out of toppings too quickly but it would get pretty expensive to add on several.I think that they should offer a small size in addition to the regular. I took home about 1/3 of my ramen and was very full at the end of the meal. I could've been content with half the regular portion. What I ended up taking home was just broth and noodles. The broth was very flavourful & filling, but I would've liked more toppings.

(I believe it may be owned/run by the same people).  The location inside is very pretty and comfortable and you can watch the chefs in action which is always fun :)  My only complaint is that it does get quite loud which can make conversation tough at some points.  The ramen was very good though and it really hit the spot ! We both had the pork Miso. I dont claim to be a ramen expert so I am not sure if this would be considered authentic or not BUT what I can say is that the broth was rich and full of flavour , the noodles had a great texture to them and the veggies inside tasted fresh but still had some crunch which was nice. The pork was just okay though it was lacking a little flavour- it may just be a matter of opinion but it didnt take away from how much I enjoyed my Ramen and it was better than most that I have tried at other restaurants. They offer the option to build your own Ramen bowl which is nice but you can also choose from a variety of pre-set options.  I liked this place a alot and i look forward to coming back again !"

It's thanks to this medley of choices that I was able to discover that I don't recommend butter in ramen (and really, what does dairy think it's doing in Japanese cuisine anyway?). Though if you really need to turn the richness of your ramen up to 11, by all means, be my guest and add that butter. We got the vegetarian ramen here, which includes vegetables (bean sprouts, corn, green onion, seaweed) and tofu furai, or tofu fried nuggets (protip: eat these first before the broth makes them too soggy). Both the omnivore and vegetarian options come with plenty of veg and the price is definitely right, with the vege option being cheaper. I also got grated garlic (unfortunately extra [?!]), which really put some oomph in the flavour. My only regret was filling up on the appetizers and sake so much that I couldn't finish the broth, which was pretty rich!Appetizer-wise, the tofu furai (which also comes as an appi with dipping sauce) was a real treat, and I say this as someone who is hard to please when it comes to tofu. The texture is really on point and the dipping sauce is tasty. Hot edamame to start really hit the spot for the hangry feelings when we first arrived! We also finished with the matcha cheesecake and that was divine despite my stomach already being waddling-level full.Decor-wise, I was a fan of the cool ambiance and hall-style seating at long tables.

The service is really friendly. Last visit I enjoyed their summer menu. I ordered the chilled ramen, which was dry noodles, pork and nori with a side of quail egg, Wasabi, ginger, and sauce similar to soba dipping sauce. After you mix everything in, the noodles taste very strongly of garlic and sesame, which I really liked. All the other flavors are mild, with some saltiness from the sauce. The quail egg doesn't add much to the dish. My friend ordered the roast beef ramen with yuzu sauce, salad, mayo, and half seasoned egg which I think is the best dish in Kinton by far. Soooooo good. I'm considering coming back to try that soon. I've ordered the Don dishes in the past and they're not worth the money, unless you're getting them as a combo for $2 extra. Even with that it's only worth trying them once. It's just rice, shredded chicken/pork, and mayo/sauce and nothing more. It's their ramen dishes that really make them special!

Second, the big wooden spoon you have to use looked very used, they need to get rid of those things. Finally, way too much garlic is added on top of the noodles over powering the soup.

The place wasn't very full when we came in and it took forever to get service, but once we did, things were quick. I do not think that any human could finish the vegetarian ramen bowl given the massive amount of noodles in the bowl, but I sure gave it a try. It wasn't too salty and I was definitely full for a long time after, but really, it was nothing special and certainly not the best ramen in the city or anything. The reason why I knocked an additional star off is for the fact that they refuse to punch your loyalty card if you don't eat every single bite of your lunch/dinner; the server admitted that it's nearly impossible to finish the vegetarian option given the amount of noodles, I personally think that it is ludicrous to charge 2 people the same exact price yet only reward the one people who ate the most...think I'll ever be back?

/user_details?userid=bj2_KPCKpQdNlN8hlHSxdg,Cat D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My new fave for ramen! Went on a whim when errands had me out later than usual for an evening mid-week. First, I was super happy to see that this resto actually sticks to its opening hours. Why, you ask? Because I've had the unfortunate experience way too many times here in Montreal where a restaurant just closes its doors earlier (especially mid-week) due to slow business OR (and this is the more frequent faux pas) it won't serve you because it's 1 or 1.5 hours before closing! I can't tell you how many times I've been left astounded that so many Montreal restaurants are fine with turning away customers so far away from closing time. It's definitely not something I experience back in NY or CT when I go home to visit. Anyway, I digress! So got there 9:45pm, closing is at 10:30pm. Greeted and seated in seconds. Menu is a bit overwhelming at first, since they have a main menu, then a second one with an item of the month and I think even a third one with other specials. I believe most of the ramen bowls were 12.99 with the nice option of upgrading to $14.99 which includes an appetizer. This works well because the appetizers, should you order them separately, are $4-$5 each. I had the original ramen, and I also liked that this resto includes the ""basics"" in their bowl with no need for add-ons. The original gets you an egg, a flavorful (with just enough fat) piece of pork belly, two pieces seaweed, green onions,etc. Too often I've been to ramen places where they give you only half an egg and charge for the other half/and nori is an add-on. The ramen menu is 99% pork broth based but they do offer one vegetarian broth option. The original ramen bowl is sea salt seasoned but you can also choose shoyu (soy sauce) or miso (soybean paste) based and they have a spicy garlic one too.You have a choice of thick or thin noodles as well. I had the gyoza appetizer, which was super crispy and the pork filling was very tasty. $1 extra gets you a soft drink or tea.The broth is not as heavy and oily as others and sits better on the stomach for that reason IMO. As well, I found the salt content to be just right/no need for three different levels of salt options like some other places I've seen, where the salt still doesn't seem on point even when you ask for extra salty! For reference, in Montreal, I've had ramen at Imadake, Ichigo Ichie/Yokato Yokatobai, Schlouppe, Misoya, and Kumamoto. As said at the start, Kinton is now my preferred but all of those listed (save for Kumamoto, which was the saddest, most flavorless ramen I've had in Montreal!) have their pros and cons and are worth a shot if Kinton is closed!"

The seats are a little bit small in my opinion and the place can get crowded (especially with winter wear). They should prepare more space for coats.FOOD: Personally, I'm not the biggest fan of Kinton. Something about the taste is unfortunately not exactly to my liking. Sometimes it's too salty or the flavor just isn't my cup of tea. It's not bad, I think it's just not for me.PRICE: I find the ramen to be a bit overpriced. You can find much better for lower costs at other places in Montreal.SERVICE: I will say that the service is always great. They greet you warmly as soon as you walk in and will be of assistance to you until the end of your meal. Very friendly."

Although, that being said, tables are quickly cleaned as people left the premise after completing their meals in a timeframe of 20 minutes or so. Menu wise, it is quite short and simple as it should be. You have a build your meal 4 step menu type where you have, in the first step, a choice between pork ok chicken and then breaks down to multiple choices of broth in the second step. The third choice consists of noodle type, thick or thin, I took thin. The last choice is extras which I invite you to look at the menu online. At the end, I ordered -pork-miso-thin noodles and skipped the 4th choice. Note that the 4th choice is priced as extra.I loved it, my spouse took the same but added the extra vegetables as her first choice. Both concluded that the taste was rich and not as salty as we would expected to be. We were impressed. The service was quick and straight to the point. We want to go back and try other options. I was full after my meal and it ended up costing around about 20$ each tx included. Left a good tip."

The negatives:  the broth is the key with great ramen and it was very cloudy (meh ok I can get past that) but something just seemed off.  My hubbies spicy option was quite hot indeed (good) but jalapeños really?  He tasted mine - the Classic, and thought it better, the huge chunks of pork belly on mine was good but again something seemed not quite right. So the end result is I just made it back to the hotel and my hubbie was not doing that great either. Can I say it was the food?  Not definitely but putting 2+2 together this time does make 4.

/user_details?userid=ZGiwU16rhGvWAYUzkWL0xw,Boz X.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Meh. Been here twice and had time to think about this. I had the spicy pork ramen and the miso pork ramen. What I like about this place is the terrasse, the firm and chewy noodles (which are very thin), the nicely marinated egg, and the fact that you get featured on IG if you finish the bowl....and that's all I can come up with.At best, it's a 3.5/5 and this is my reasoning:First, both broths (spicy and miso) lack a depth of flavor. It seems like they have been watered down as, for some reason, my tastebuds simply aren't excited.Then, the spicy soup didn't deliver the heat I was expecting. It was barely spicy and tasted almost unsalted. Finally, the pricing is comparable to Yokato Yokabai, which is about 20$ after taxes and tips. But the ramen at Yokato Yokabai is significantly tastier. Probably will not come back considering the many options around this part of town."

/user_details?userid=WmIqb6uCqJbxWp9k7ZU-hw,Jennifer T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been following their Instagram for a little while and I was so excited when I heard Kinton is opening a restaurant in Montreal! I've always wanted to try their ramen but I've always missed my chances when they were offering it for a limited time at Kinka Izakaya.We went there a week after they were opened but we didn't have to wait at all as we went there fairly late (~8:30 pm). The restaurant is quite spacious but it was really hot inside (it felt like you suddenly enter into a heated room/sauna...) Kinton Ramen offers two broths: tonkotsu (pork-based) and chicken-based brothes. Their regular sized ramens are all the same price ($12.99, except for their vegetarian ramens, which are $11.99). They have 4 different flavors: original, shoyu, miso and spicy.Since it was my first time there, I asked our waitress which one is the most popular and which one is the less salty ramen. She told me the original flavor (sea salt) is the most popular one but the miso (soybean paste) and spicy (chilly pepper) ramens are also quite popular. She added if I'm scared that the ramen would be too salty, they can always dilute the broth for me.After debating between their original and miso ramen, I decided to order their original tonkotsu ramen with thin noodles (I didn't ask to dilute my broth as I wanted to try the original one first). My boyfriend ordered their spicy tonkotsu ramen with thick noodles (whenever there is a spicy option, he would  always get that)!We wanted to order their karaage but we ate lunch too late and weren't that hungry, so we passed their karaage (but the next time I go, I will try that!). We wanted to order their ""panache"" (sapporo + homemade lemonade) but they only had the ""Shandy Gaff"" (sapporo+ginger ale) left, so we ordered that.My original ramen came with bean sprouts, nori (seaweed), scallions, seasoned soft-boiled egg and 2 pieces of char-siu (one is leaner and the other one has more fat -pork belly). My boyfriend's ramen came with bean sprouts, scallions, grated garlic and 2 pieces of char-siu. The seasoned egg inside his ramen was an extra topping.I wished all of their ramens could come with their seasoned egg (only the original has it) as it is the best ramen-egg I've had in Montreal! The soft boiled egg was made to perfection; well marinated and the yolk was not over cooked! I also wished the ramen would come with menma (bamboo shoots) and fungus, which would add more texture to the ramen and make it tastier!The original ramen broth was not as salty as I thought and I was really glad I didn't dilute it. The broth was actually quite thick but in a good sense; it was ""creamy"". My noodles were chewy and not too soft/over-cooked (just like the way I like). I find there weren't a big difference between the thick and the thin noodles. I stole half of my boyfriend's grated garlic and put it into my ramen. It made my broth even more yummy! I highly recommend adding the grated garlic as an additional topping or just go with someone who would order their spicy ramen (and steal some grated garlic!) I tried the spicy ramen and it was a little bit spicier than what I have expected. Overall, the ramens were delicious and we found they went really well with the sapporo beer (drinking it alone was ""meeh"" but together with the ramen, it was ""wow"")I think they now rank as my #1 favourite ramen place in Montreal (but no ramen places in Montreal can beat Ippudo or Ichiran ramen in my opinion)"

The restaurant wasn't extremely busy at that time on a Sunday night. She asked us if it is our first time here and explained the entire menu to us. Second thing, the menu was simple. One long sheet, one side was the ramen choice and the second one has other ramen, appetisers and drinks. We had the original pork and the spicy pork. The meat was so tender! I liked it. Oh, you could also choose from thick noodles or thin noodles. The spicy one was not extremely spicy but it is still very good! The original was really good though! I would take it again but next time, I'm going to try the miso one. On the spicy pork one, there was also a garlic ball on the middle. The original pork has nori. Basically, depending on the meat and the soup type, you have different toppings. So a spicy chicken would be totally different from the spicy pork. Highly recommend it!"

The seaweed and scallions were incredibly fresh and gave another dimension of taste as opposed to blending in with the broth. I mixed the whole scoop of grated garlic into the broth which proved to be overpowering so I would reserve some on the side. The thick noodles had perfect firmness. The melt-in-your-mouth pork and seasoned egg were the best I have ever tasted in a ramen. The only thing that didn't stand out for me was the broth but there are many more highlights.Excellent space in a new building with a spacious tarrasse.

I had the spicy pork ramen for my main dish, and the noodles were excellent; perfectly cooked, and thick just as I love them. The pork was so tender, it melted in your mouth, and the soup - rich, and spicy, but not too much, just the right amount of a kick. My sister had the Shoyu pork ramen and it was way too salty. It seems they poured too much soy sauce in it. I will not take that one in the future, for sure. The place is new so it's clean and the service was friendly."

I was not a fan of the rice bowl at all, the pork that came with it had a flaky almost like canned tuna kind of texture, heavily lacking moisture. The flavour wasn't bad tasting like a mixture of soy sauce, sugar and mirin but it was just too dry and the flaky texture of the pork was really odd.The ramen on the other side was very delicious, a very generous portion with a large slice of charsiu and a thick slab of pork belly. The egg was perfectly seasoned with a rich soy sauce flavour coming through despite the strong flavour of the broth. The noodles were nice and chewy. I found that addition of the beansprouts rather odd, I supposed it was for a couch texture but I would have much preferred the typically seen bamboo shoots.

We gave our orders within 10 minutes, and received our food soon after. We got the original chicken and the original pork ramen, the Chiki Chiki Don, and homemade ice tea. They had quite a selection of toppings, so we decided to try cheese (lol). The Don came first, and was surprisingly good! The mayo really complemented the seaweed topping, and the sweetened soy sauce at the bottom was perfect for the rice. The ramen came pipping hot. The broths were quite good, but a bit more oily than that of other places, and - q u i t e - salty. I usually drink some of the broth after finishing the noodles, but couldn't do it this time. The pork and chicken slices were tender and delicious, and the noodles were nice and chewy. Surprisingly, melting the cheese in ramen was quite good... The portion wasn't very large, but not smaller than that of Yokato Yokabai or Schlouppe Bistrot Nakamichi. Unfortunately, we received our ice tea last, when we had already finished eating.I would recommend for them to get more coat racks, especially since winter is upon us. Not everyone will appreciate having to hold their big coats on their lap, sitting on those tiny stools. It was overall a very entertaining experience.

No fuss, no frills, two pieces of pork ""char siu"" and a soft boiled soy egg, a slight 'drizzle' of green onions. I personally like my ramen with all the fixins' so this was a bit bare bones. The real winner here is the broth: milky creamy smooth, and most importantly *not a horse's salt lick*. Holy shitake mushrooms, why do so many ramen places insist on giving their clientele a salt hangover?I'm sure there's a proper name for it, but the service staff shout greetings as you enter and leave, but they're not annoying about it like at Imadake; service was super friendly and attentive."

Going back to the saltiness issue... this may not be the case with all their soup base options...

I had to share it because I wouldn't be able to eat it all on my own. The fried chicken was juicy and flavorful. Even though it stayed in my broth for a really long time, the crispy crust was soggy. However the found the broth to be a little bit ""powdery""... Not sure how to describe it... The noodles were perfectly chewy, just the way I like it. The seasoned boiled egg was amazing, really worth the extra money in my opinion. I didn't expect it to be that good.- pork broth thin noodles ramen: the broth is ""creamier"" than the karaange ramen one. It is not too thick, just on point. The pork meat was tender and had a good proportion of fat and lean meat, and it was seasoned. - sesame pudding: they didn't have the matcha cheesecake so I ordered the pudding instead. The pudding tasted nice, you can taste the black sesame, but I feel like the consistency is a bit too runny to be considered a pudding though...Probably the ramen that I enjoyed the most so far compared to the ones I got at Imadake and Kinka, but still haven't tried the ramen at Misoya yet.

The broth was full bodied with lots of flavourful, the fatty pork belly cooked to perfection, adding even more flavour to the bowl. Karaage was crunchy, tender and bathed in a spicy and sour sauce. If only the sauce was lighter on the salt, it would've been perfect for my taste. Overall, a good experience."

The broth is lacking depth of flavour and somehow is both not salty enough and too salty at the same time, it's disconcerting. The noodles are therefore also kind of bland.  My first time at kinton I ordered the original while my dining partner had the chicken ramen. This time I ordered the spicy. I would have to say the spicy is the   better of the two. The topping portions sizes are light. Also the combination of toppings each option comes with isn't my favorite (but that's honestly just personal preference).  Staff is great and quick, really nice people. The price itself ok, $12.99+tax without extra toppings. I keep tasting the noodles and the broth as I write this and it continues to taste sort of bland.

For a ramen to be prefect, it require 3 elements : noodles, soups and meats. + Their Noodles are AMAZING, chewy and bouncy. You have 2 choice THICK or THIN noodles. I usually go with thin noodle because like my noodle chewy. You get a lot of noodle for the size. Although my friend always other extra noodle, but I personally think the proportion is good. And special secret noodle, is the KALE  noodle. They only serve it with Salad noodle (I think). I never tried it, but my friend love it. (It is a veggie option)+Their soup are perfectly seasoned, not too salty. You also have 2 choice Chicken/ Pork soup. Chicken soup have less favour than Pork. I believe it much be healthier. But the Pork soup is strong and flavourful.I usually go for Pork soup with Spicy. Because the spicy chicken soup can't keep up with the pork. +The meat is also perfectly cooked. It is soft and full of flavour. The meat will just melt in your mouth. Plus, the cut is less fatty than other places. It balance well with the soup and noodles. SPECIAL, love their special menu. It changes according to season. I tried their cold noodle during summer and still craving for it now ( after 5months). They don't have much too choose from, but their special menu is a plus.  Like most other asian restaurant, they don't have much desserts. But their black sesame putting is DELICIOUS. Love it. A small cons, is that their entrees are small and too pricy (-1*) but their bathrooms are cray cute, clean and creative (+1*). So it make up for it."

It may not look like much, but it has an irresistible taste to it. The presentation of its dishes are set up like how you would expect a bowl of ramen should look; the difference is, these noodles aren't just for show, it proves its worth. I recommend going with the original with thin noodles like others have been saying. I prefer the chicken broth, but beef is also a fine choice. It comes with a delectable egg; one that is unmatched. I'm not even a big fan off eggs, but this takes the cake. The appetizers are ok, though you probably don't even need them. The servings are fairly large and each bowl can fill you to the brink.

The first time I went with a friend, spurned by good reviews, I was absolutely enchanted with the ramen. Like blown away; best I'd had in my life. So much so that I raved about for days to friends, and on facebook (because yes: FOOD.). I'd ordered the regular pork ramen with thick noodles and the spicy broth, and the melt-in-your-mouth pork. What I loved was that it was made with jalapeno, which I found very original and flavourful, not to mention that it wasn't over spiced. I'd also ordered the regular (non spicy) kara-age as a side, which was the best I've had, hands down.Eager to return and show my boyfriend how great it was, I returned a few weeks later... only to find that though I had ordered the same thing, the experience was completely different. The pork was tough and fatty at once (which well, how does that even happen?), the broth was just burn-your-face-off spicy without any of the flavourful subtlety I'd experienced before (and I LOVE spicy food) and between you and me, internet, I paid for it dearly the next day. Multiple times. I'd also ordered the kara-age as well, but in its spicy version, which basically consisted of drowning the delicately fried batter in an overwhelmingly rich spicy bbcue slop. It was so rich (fried batter, plus really heavy and spicy sauce) that I couldn't even eat it. Most disappointing 50$ I ever spent on a meal. Like, it actually hurt me to pay it, even though the service was good. I have no complaints about the staff at all, in fact. They were courteous both times I went. On another note, at the risk of sounding like a fuddy duddy, it's not really a place to go to if you like conversation, since the preferred ambiance there is an eardrum-splitting""untz-untz-untz"" beat sort of deal. I get that ""hey we're hip"" but that doesn't mean your diners want to be deaf. So yeah, I dunno.

You'll probably need to be at least a ""medium"" spice level person to want to drink the broth after.-If you're doing the combo, get the ton ton bowl -- the sauce on it is sweet and is delicious over rice. -The normal bowl has 2 slices of meat."

Love the vibe, nice for group of friend who just want to enjoy a hot and flavorful bowl of ramen in the warm (not so say freezing) weather :)"
/user_details?userid=UlzxyLrUc37nYAPmsqc2Ng,Jeni K.,"Alhambra, CA",3 star rating,"The interior of the restaurant had nice decor but they kept it very warm inside. I proceeded to order the thick noodle miso pork ramen and gyoza for dinner while visiting from out of town. 5 stars for the gyoza. 2 stars for the ramen. The broth was rather light for a miso, bordering on bland. The pork was just okay, not very fatty but somewhat tender. Maybe it was because I had higher hopes for a 4 star ramen place but I was pretty disappointed. Almost gave it 2 stars but the gyoza was done pretty well so bumped the rating up. I won't be back though. Too bad. I love ramen..."
/user_details?userid=bCC9m7vuNKISQ-ckJ98fJQ,She H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The original ramen was tasty, not too salty. I'm not sure I will always be willing to wait 30 minutes for a seat, but I have to say the bowl of ramen was satisfying. If you are extra hungry, a side of corn and bean sprouts will definitely fill you up. Just make sure your entire group has arrived as they don't seat you until everyone is present."

Ichifuku ramen and Imadake are just down the street from here and it's cheaper and better. I had the original pork ramen, all the ingredients were fresh and good, flavors complimented eachother and the portion sizes were good."

Prices are a tad bit more than other places, but still Kinton offers its own distinct taste compared to other ramen restaurants. It's worth a try!"

Original, Shoyu,Miso, and Spicy 3) Noodle thick o thin . 4) various options.I got Pork+Original+Thick+no extra.  This did come with egg, pork and nori.  It was delicious to the last drop.  We also got Gyoza(with some nice sauce on top)  and Spicy fried chicken(this had Korean pepper sauce a plus in my view).  Sapporo draft beer.Fantastic upbeat atmosphere; great food and the whole team, the waitress, head waiter and the cook were all working in one unison.  I think they all said thank you and bye in Japanese as we were leaving.  Wow.We did come back two days later, it was little more busy.  We tried the spicy.   Spicy didn't include the egg like the original but when I asked for it. They brought it over right away.  Great food and great service."

It didnt really went beyond my expectations with the food taste. However, it was not so bad either also the place is very simplistic and I really loved it. Staff are super kind as well :)"
/user_details?userid=Qz1vpQYhRKicbD0xfUtm4g,Brenda O.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I tried the vegetable ramen. The stock was OK but love the chewy noodle. My friend had the spicy soup base with pork ramen and she love it.
/user_details?userid=nwuIoaQ5T9mEV8OzAMuzgA,Jeff M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Went there during the opening week. Staff was pretty friendly and  service was pretty fast. Started off with the takoyaki (fried octopus balls) and it was really good, worth trying. I Had the spicy pork ramen with thick noodles, and I added sweet corn and an seasoned egg to it. It was okay, it wasn't the best ramen I've had and it wasn't too memorable. I've been to one of their locations in Toronto and it was definitely better, but considering it was their first week here, I'd prolly have to give them another chance and try it another time."
/user_details?userid=k6ecgDTV9pCyiLzP8tHybg,Tom K.,"Dorval, Canada",2 star rating,"Cool, clean place with nice decor and authentic Japanese feel, but there's a lot better ramen in Montreal. Pork was pre-cooked and re-heated when served. And hot sauce costs $1, but has ketchup in it. A bit too loud, too. Seems everything about this place is designed to get you in and out within 20 minutes."
/user_details?userid=44s0nfgA-MADJpYC6mDCUQ,Matthew N.,"Charlottetown, Canada",5 star rating,Perfect Ramen! I ordered the burnt miso and my wife got the original both were exceptional. For two people it came to $34 with the tip.
/user_details?userid=ujAKxLa5GrX-U8_GXM6OUg,Ex P.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,The wait staff could definitely use some training. They were somewhat rude during our dinner interjecting midway to get us to pay while we had food in our mouth. Also the air conditioning is broken or not being used correctly. We asked to be seated outdoors but they insisted indoors even though it was so stuffy inside. The chain in general is good but this location is a disappointment.

The place itself is super cute. Not too crowed, very nice decor and sweet staff. My husband and i tried the gyoza and fried chicken as our appetizer. The fried chicken was delicious with a nice dipping sauce. The gyoza were good, but a bit too much sauce for my taste (i like the sauce served on the side!). We got some ramen (of course) and they were amazingggg. Definitely the star of the show!"
/user_details?userid=e4kx1bnznjjcjchFNEFb1A,Jordan D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,This is my favourite place for traditional ramen in Montreal so far.  Good choice of noodles and broth and you can choose between pork and chicken bases.The noodles have a really good flavour and stiffness. I'll be back soon.
/user_details?userid=_b6u_JPQU3TwG4vQdCO23A,Roland F.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,Pretty delicious Ramen! Tried out the miso pork Ramen with extra noodle and found it to be the right portion of filling. Staff were friendly and the ambience is nice. One thing to note would be the price - it was a bit more than I was used to in Toronto.
/user_details?userid=g_8Vy5tcRX1rX4xVitmEPw,Catherine T.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I love the egg in the ramen. I like the pork broth. The original broth is salty. I like how the fat belly pork is grilled and put in your ramen.
/user_details?userid=KdZlltBnpXERUb6vxEdYKg,Frederick R.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"It took them an hour to prepare our ramen from the time we ordered. What gives? Let's be honest here, it's glorified soup, how long does it really take to make? We were positioned in a corner and they forgot about our table completely, our drinks didn't come until we asked, at the same time the food arrived. Seriously, $15 for absolutely zero service, and a bowl of soup with scraps of meat. Ripoff. If you enjoy ramen, search Yelp for somewhere else."
/user_details?userid=DKNjLUflZn0ufT_lrIEiZg,Michio H.,"Blainville, Canada",5 star rating,Noodles were nicely firm and surprisingly the broth was not too salty (which I find is usually a problem with other ramens restaurants) Service was quick and neat.

/user_details?userid=60v7H_m0Atd_98oCwqclew,C C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I've eaten at this place a couple of times now. One of the better ramen places that I've been to. Very good flavour and I recommend getting the extra pork. I will definitely come back. The only compliant I have is that after the meal I can't stop drinking water for at least 4 hours. I'm sure there is a lot of salt in the soup although the flavour is very good and it doesn't taste too salty. The service was very friendly as well.
/user_details?userid=MNx6SgG8JnfsWRQKSpyBZw,Christian M.,"South Windsor, CT",5 star rating,"This is the best ramen place I've ever been to. The employees were very kind and provided amazing service. It was very trendy and modern which is something you don't find in many ramen places. It has a very lively atmosphere, all of the workers say goodbye and thank you to you when you leave the restaurant. It is also in a great location, right in downtown Montreal, leaving lots to do after you finish eating. The ramen was amazing I got the spicy chicken ramen and my fiancé got the original. They both tasted great and we will definitely be going back."
/user_details?userid=SUd0Gwv8dg6x2oUSy4lgVQ,Will R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,This is perfectly fine ramen. I still prefer Miso-Ya one block away for its greater flavor depth. The atmosphere and service are both much nicer at Kinton.

I have been a loyal customer ever since it opened and working on my way as a kinton bowler. I've tried the miso which was good but absolutely in love with the porc classic.. first of all, they cook the egg just right, after all the times I've been there I have never been disappointed on the egg. The broth is to die for and the noodles are just so good!! The gyoza and tofu furai(tofu nuggets) is out of this world and I always order these appetizers when I go.  I love the staff, I always have such quick and welcoming service here. I would recommend this place for anyone crazy for ramen. My onto wish is for tonkotsu soup to be added to the menu."
/user_details?userid=Jr8yyljsEEQio_3TUR7D_w,Bing R.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Not as good as Yokato Yokabai, but better than Misoya and Ichifuku, much better than Nakamichi which is terrible.Overall it's OK. The seasoned eggs are excellent, but the pork was hard and too old, the broth was not flavorful. Nice decor.If ANYONE thinks this is great ramen, they need to take the Greyhound bus to New York City."

My colleague and I went for lunch last week. I had the spicy pork garlic ramen and he had the shoyu chicken ramen. Delicious, just like how it is in Toronto! I got my 9th Kinton Bowler stamp too. It's great how they have a patio here in Montreal, I wish their Toronto locations have patios too."
/user_details?userid=NNZBEollNh7bHTBHDKjGtw,D C.,"Orléans, Canada",2 star rating,"A bit of a disappointment to be honest when compared to Kinton Ramen in Toronto. All the food we ordered was off. The tamago, while had good flavour, was overcooked. The thin ramen was overlooked by a little it seems. The soup base for the original flavour did not taste like the one in Toronto. It seemed ""water-downed"", very little flavour in the soup. The rice used for the Ton Ton Don and the Chiki Chiki Don did not have the consistency that one would associate with Japanese rice. It's missing the gelatin-ness/ stickiness that one would found in Japanese rice. I wonder if the rice served was old. It had similar consistency of fried rice. Overall, disappointed with my visit. Guess I will stick with the one in Toronto."
