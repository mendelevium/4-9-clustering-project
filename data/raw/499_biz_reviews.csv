The decor is chic and somewhat resembles that of Marcus. I don't know if it's the hotel restaurant concept? But le boulevardier has definitely a more clean, intimate, and inviting atmosphere for its guests. Our waitress did a pretty good job of summarizing the main menu. Consequently, we ordered a green pea crème brûlée with black pudding-This dish was a perfect combination of sweet & savoury with a touch of salty, it is a nice twist on a traditional dessert. We also ordered a side of six oysters that included the Tresor oysters, my favorite. There were a lot of vinegars and sauces that came with the oysters as well. The presentation of this dish was exceptional. For the main course,  we shared the Mediterranean sea bass served with potatoes and Brussel sprouts, this was my favourite dish. The second item was the lamb tagliatelle, which was nice with simple flavours. The wine list was definitely on the pricey side, so I settled for the Le Boulevardier cocktail as one of the cheaper alternatives. The price range for appetizers starts at around $16, whereas the main courses range between $20-$40 per plate. The final bill came out to around $150 for two people which was very reasonable and appropriate given the excellent service and great atmosphere."

The restaurant is located on the second floor of Le Germain Hotel. I ordered items from the table-d'hôte menu ($28), as a starter I had the Green peas crème brûlée (+$5). The green peas mousse was light, the crust of the crème brûlée was crisp, I really liked the mix of salty and sweet, it was my favourite dish by far. As a main dish, I ordered the beef tartare with fries, the tartare was good but somehow I expected something better and the fries were not to my taste either. For dessert, I had the clafouti (+$8) which was good and reminded me of the ones my mother used to bake when I was little. The total amount of the bill was a bit steep, which would have been ok if they had presented me with dishes out of the ordinary... but apart from the starter, I'm not sure it was really worth that price.However, the interior is gorgeous and the service was A+ and courteous all along."

I'm always a bit reticent to go to restaurants that look like they might be a bit pretentious. I love good food, and I don't mind paying for it, but I do mind places that take themselves too seriously. In this case, I'm glad I followed their lead. FIRST IMPRESSIONS The maître d'hôtel was lovely. Although I was definitely in my ""Friday attire"" (think extreme business casual), they were warm and welcoming. I knew that I was under dressed, but they did not make me feel unwelcome at all. Points for that! I arrived a bit before my friends, but I was seated immediately at a nice table (I wasn't hidden in a dark corner despite my less than glamorous appearance. Lovely view on our winter wonderland. I was offered a choice of still or sparkling water while I waited, and did not feel even a little out of place with my big backpack (I was heading to a cross-town meeting after lunch, so I was carrying my office on my back!). THE WAIT STAFFWe were served by a number of different people. I appreciated that the emphasis appeared to be on quality and efficiency. I am sure people are assigned tables or sections, but they are clearly focused on ensuring that people are served promptly more than anything else. Everyone was friendly and polite. I also value when wait staff do lot attempt to force additional food on me. I order what I can eat, and nothing more. I did not feel pressured to order more than my meal and my coffee. Yay!THE MENUAs this was my first visit, I don't know if the menu changes seasonally or if the lunch and dinner menus differ. However, I can say that the lunch menu offered just the right amount of variety and everything looked good. They offer a Table d'hôte option for a few dollars more that includes appetizer and dessert. For lunch, that would be too much for me, but the offerings looked delicious. THE FOODI was there with 2 friends and we each ordered a different meal. I had the salmon tartare, one friend had the sea bass and the other had the gnocchi. We were all very happy with our choices. The gnocchi was gorgeous and the mushrooms looked cooked to perfection. My friend was very satisfied. My other friend had the sea bass. I would note that if you don't like roe, you may be put off, but it was delicious. I had a fairly standard salmon tartare. It wasn't exciting, but it was good, as were the fries it was served with. Again, if you aren't a fan of roe, there is a little as garnish, but that can be easily set aside (I'm sure you can order it without). THE BILLI did not experience any ""sticker shock"". The meal was worth what I paid for it. We sat around talking at our table for a good hour after we finished eating. The staff continued to refresh our beverages and check in periodically. We felt no pressure to leave. We left a good tip. CONCLUSIONI recommend."
