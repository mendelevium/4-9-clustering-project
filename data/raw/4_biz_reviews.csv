/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",5 star rating,Still my fave chicken- fries- salad cheap eats of MTL. The vibe is different. Covid has made it a much more sterile experience as it is takeout only. It is hard to hear the guys working behind the counter plexiglass. You have to yell pretty loud. Also they can't hear you well so speak up when ordering.*****Only one person allowed in the restaurant per party. So do not come as a two people or more as they will deny you and you will get mad. I saw them enforce the rules and the guy in front of me looked pretty upset. The chicken is still the same flavour as I remember. Light charcoal taste. Amazing sauce and fall off the bone tender. STILL THE BEST!
/user_details?userid=3qMeM2IZP1L_E-aI08-0xw,Vi L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is AMAZING. The moment you walk by the outside of the restaurant you can already smell how delicious the food is going to be.We shared a 'small' poutine because we were so full from eating all weekend and we could not finish it--- in our defense, the portion sizes are GIGANTIC. We were watching the guy chop up the chicken for our order and stuff it into the takeout container: it was so packed full of food that the chicken just BARELY fit. The poutine: the chicken was deliciously juicy and tender, the fries were soaking in the delicious gravy and cheese (I'm salivating just thinking about it and this was 5 months ago!).  AMAZING. This is the best poutine I've had in Montreal so far.People around us all got the chicken meals and they looked so delicious. That's definitely something to try for our next visit--- in addition to a poutine of course. Next time we will be sure to save extra room in our bellies!"
/user_details?userid=hF3zr8snmxb5pwa2_9bnlQ,Gabriella F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"So this is going to be hella controversial but this place has the BEST POUTINE IN MONTREAL aka the world.It's all I've ever gotten here so that's all I can testify for. Yall. Don't even bother with la Banquise before midnight.Poule mouillée poutine with chicken and chorizo is your best bet in this town, and you can eat it there (pre-Covid) or in the Parc Lafontaine with super tasty Portuguese egg tarts A definite favourite."

/user_details?userid=KcFMI-hsr2Em7whfI4OM5g,Katya P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here just for the chicken, like many others we saw the restaurant featured on a Netflix show. We arrived right around opening time on a Saturday and there was no line up. We got a whole chicken, with mild sauce ($16). The flavors were good, chicken tender and well seasoned but the sauce is just an oily mess. This is very difficult to eat as every piece is just dripping in oil and can be challenging to take it home.For the price and potential line ups, I don't think it's worth it. Now I did not get to sample any other menu items but if you came just for chicken, there are many other portuguese style rotisserie or grilled chicken joints that offer similar options."
/user_details?userid=ZXyGw3Z1DyhK1sfNtpcyYA,Linda P.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Whoever associated Canadians and maple syrup was wack because Canadians don't really eat that ever. Poutine? Definitely.La Banquise is just across the street and we can have a war about which is better but you can't go wrong with either :)Torn because I love them both --- Ma Poule Mouillée is definitely known for their chicken. Combine that on the poutine with chorizo, gravy and cheese curds, and you've got a hella good combo here! I liked La Banquise cheese curds and gravy a lot better though. Like I said, can't go wrong :)Portuguese egg tarts were amazing though, couldn't stop myself for getting just one!"
/user_details?userid=a-cPRrpuWSmYIYJQO9560Q,Paul H.,"North York, Canada",3 star rating,"So, I had to try after all the hype and positive reviews.  There is no dine in so everything is take out and I ate in my car.  I was super hungry. I ordered a half chicken that was served with salad and fries and hot sauce. The chicken was really well done. To the point where even the dark meat was flaky. Maybe I was unlucky, but this bird was cooked way too long. The fries were really good and the hot sauce was great. I needed more sauce to make the chicken go down. I also ordered the poutine with sausage and chicken. As far as poutines go it was good, but not spectacular. I base my poutines on the gravy and this one was lacking depth. The meat helped inside, but I really like a richer gravy that should have been hotter to melt the cheese. All in all it was good, but I would not rush back. Still worth a try because you may have better luck."
/user_details?userid=-P0tSMT2EkEjPEjkZ5ZhGA,Marcela D.,"Albany, NY",5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I went to Montreal over New Years, and this was one of the only places on his ""must try"" list that was open and ohhh GOODNESS am I glad it was. In fact, we opted to go to Ma Poule Mouillée in lieu of a more *traditional* poutine. We got the ""small poutine"" (which was anything but small) and Le Louis Cyr (which is a half chicken with French fries and a fresh green salad). Both dishes were out of this world. The signature spicy sauce was featured in both-- it's tangy, spicy, warm, and, in the poutine, the cheese curds perfectly complimented it. The place is small, but we got there at just the right time-- the line wasn't especially long, but the inside was PACKED. However, because of the nature of the place, diner turnover is pretty quick-- we were able to snag a window seat and watch a quieter part of this beautiful city."
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I imagine those who are lining-up will not agree with this, but I'm really not sure why there is such a line?To summarize briefly, with respect to their mainstays; the grilled chicken is alright but not that great, the salad is not much more than fair and the fries are even so-so or dare I say subpar (to the point where I would probably not order them again as a side dish).On other occasions a few redeeming items would be their Bifana sandwich (which they make to order, but did have a bit of dangly fat hanging off one side) and excellent baked goods; like their egg tarts and Portuguese buns which are stand-outs on their own. In retrospect, if people are lining-up for their baked goods then I may understand it a little more. Sometimes a word-of-mouth reputation can get ahead of itself, like it did for another 'take your guess' poutine place across the street (too easy of a hint) -- but in their case has to do with a change in portion and quality -- and with so many other choices for Portuguese take-out and also for poutine -- I still don't get why people are in such a hurry to wait in-line. Sorry, that was a bit of a run on thought and that this review had more focus on lines than much else. I do think it might make some question how to spend their time. Not saying not to support local restaurants, but perhaps think about sharing the wealth as the expression goes. The three stars is an average of meh, I've had better and some darn good baked items."

I seriously don't know how I lived my life before I ate here. I'm the first to admit that I get a little picky with my chicken but my fiancée is Portuguese and this means I've been introduced to a lot of great chicken places recently and I happily go along. While driving down Rachel we decided to stop in and I couldn't even look at the menu because my girl had already order half the menu. We had the poutine, the chorizo sandwich and the spicy chicken sandwich the sandwich came with a salad as well. From the second I took a bite of the poutine and got to taste the chicken the chorizo the cheese the gravy all in a perfect bite I was in love. The poutine is piled high and generously and the chicken and chorizo are so flavourful it still blows my mind. Moving on to the sandwich the bread is stuffed with either protein and taste really can't compare to anything you get the piripiri spice and the taste from the charcoal grill and it's this perfect little dance that happens in your mouth. You won't have room for dessert I promise but if your like me and wanna make sure you have a little something sweet for when you digest a little later on grab an almond tart and thank me later ;) This is Montreal and the Portuguese community is one of the best they are friendly and happy to feed anyone your doing yourself a disservice if you don't eat here at least once ( a week )."

Having been my first trip here, I would constantly hear how I haddd to try poutine. Searching on yelp for the areas near me, this was a clear winner. Even as we were parking in the area, we could smell how amazing the food was. We got there around their opening time but even then there was a fairly large line. Once we got to the ordering area, the menu options all looked so good. The cashier recommended one of their larger group poutines since we had 3 guys in our group and we were lucky enough to snag a quick seat inside. The food looked amazing when it came out. It was like the epitome of comfort food all piled into one plate. The chicken, fries and gravy were delicious. The chicken was soft and tender, fries were crispy and gravy was very flavorful. Strongly recommend anyone visiting this area to try this spot out!"
/user_details?userid=xh84BlvTytrjuyOkSyevHg,Jennifer D.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"If there's a chicken dinner worth waiting 30 min outside in snowy Montreal for... It's this chicken. The lines are long, ordering is a stressful, frantic process, and hunting for a seat can become hunger games-like. But... Man this chicken is damn good. I've never had Portuguese chicken before and it reminded me of latin-style rotisserie chicken - juicy, tender, flavorful - but with a unique spicy red sauce! We ordered a half chicken plate with fries and salad as well as a poutine with chicken and chorizo. We'd been advised by a local to get poutine here and it was a great way to try poutine! The chorizo was also tender and tasty.But to be honest, the chicken and the chicken alone is really the star here. On future visits I'll definitely be ordering chicken and only chicken. But with extra sauce of course!"

If you know the area real well.. you know there's a police station right across and to be quite frank the police officers have it GOOD!!!!!! They're really fortunate to have Ma poule Moillée from walking distance ahahaAtmosphere:Welll before I even Entered the resto I could smell the delicious chicken from my car it was so intense! I swear I feel like they made the entire street smell with awesomeness so people get lured in on purpose ahaha .. this place was packed and it was my first time trying out .. I wonder how busy they are at lunch time  on a regular weekday Food: 5+++++++++ Portuguese chicken Was very tender and as per my expectations they were completely met .. it was insanely flavourful cooked on a charcoal grill ! I love Portuguese chicken and they just nailed it and hit the spot!My poutine 5+++++ waaaw it was amazing and so filling.. I didn't know the portions were so large I was amazed. The chorizo sausage could be a bit better It was a tad overcooked and chewy but thats ok... the flavours were so amazing definitely worth getting it for the price. I love how the cheese curds are hidden inside the poutine so they have a chance to melt and get gooey mmmmmThe Chicken Sandwich:My oh my 5++++Starssssss Chicken was so moist but most of all the actualbun was coated with Flavour .. Correct me if I'm wrong but I totally hinted the bread being french Toasted prior and I taste the egg and softnessOf the sandwich woow it was Perfect !Chicken was the actual highlight and I strongly recommend you trying it outService: A1 very fast and super perfect... it was a full house but the staff were well organized and managed to keep the orders rolling definitely experienced. Friendly staff and superb service  Cost: Cheappppp and Insanely large portions don't ever change please :D12$ for a huge poutine Half Chicken for 14$ came with fries and saladChicken sandwich with rice 12$ Parking: super challenging as it's hit and miss downtown lol parking meters are all full and hard to get a hold of one but it didn't stop me from getting hereOverall I definitely recommend this place for Portuguese chicken it's insanely delicious and flavourful and you won't be disappointed .. ohh and Wayyyyy wayyy wayyyy wayyyy better then Romados ;)
/user_details?userid=TJAZ4h-YNSk9vqdEmuwaIg,Roxane V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,The chorizo!!!! Omg!!! I visited this place for the first time and bought the half chicken which came with salad and fries and the full chorizo with two spicy sauces. Everything came for $25. The chicken was juicy but not great. It didn't have any sauce over it like the pictures on Yelp showed but whatever. The chorizo is the bomb and u should totally buy just that or buy the chicken but u definitely need the spicy sauce with it. The girls taking the orders are pretty quick and don't spend time explaining anything but the girl (Latino looking with the winged) was so sweet and explained to me what I wanted to know (the difference between the whole chicken and half). I'm definitely coming back but just for the full chorizo cuz I grill better chicken in my patio for sure!

Brilliant choice because it started my trip off VERY right.La Banquise is across the street from this establishment and many will say that's the best poutine in Montreal but they would be wrong. VERY wrong. The best poutine is at Ma Poule Mouillee and for $12, you get a whole lot of it so bring your friends and your appetites! Chicken, sausage, curds, fries, gravy, sauces, delicious!Everything else is great. Their chicken is delicious and for me, superior to one of their main competitors, Romados. It's just so flavourful and juicy and everything you'd want from Portuguese chicken.The salad and potatoes are also solid. I really don't think you could go wrong with anything here, especially when you consider that they are quite inexpensive. They have a knack for flavours and they deliver excellence every time."

I went inside and wife stayed in car. We decided to do take out instead of dine in.When I went inside it was jammed packed.However the line was moving quick and food was coming out fast. Was worried about speed to quality but the food was bang on.I told the man it was my first time and wanted to try all the favorites. I got the followingChicken whole cut up into picies with medium spice.Chicken was tender to touch even the breast was juicy and moist. You can taste the charcoal but not overpowering the spice but enough to know it was there. I enjoyed the flavoursFries were cooked well and I asked them for a bit more well done because I like them burnt. Fries are cut from fresh potatoes and they tasted fresh and not oily and you could tell the oil was not old by taste and colour.Salad came with the meal. Simple salad with tomatoes and onion and mixed greens. Dressing was like a honey mustard base. Decent salad Rice was ok nothing to say about that except it was a bit dry . Not to worry and some of there sauce and bang. Brand new again.Chicken sandwich was on a white type of bun that you can tell was super fresh  and made that day. Fill it with there sauce an Chicken you have a winnerSausage. Was bang on the mark with flavours and juicy. Not overcooked and the flavours worked well.Most places you go the sausage is over cooked and hard like a rock. But not here super tender and moistPoutine is huge and well worth the money.How can you go wrong with poutine.Add there great tasting fries along with the sausage and chicken, cheese and there gravy( nice flavours for gravy alone) you have a winnerIf you are in the area give it a try and you will thank me"
/user_details?userid=jTunzdJcFdPtnk6S8A5oyQ,Corinne K.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Omg y'all the hype is REAL. Ma Poule Mouillée legit has some of the best dang Portuguese chicken I have ever eaten and I am so glad that I dragged my boyfriend here for a second lunch our last day in Montreal. It was 100% worth the line and 10/10 would do it again in a heartbeat.We both ordered the P'tit Talbot, which is their signature chicken sandwich in the most delish sauce. Thankfully we only waited about 10 minutes to place our order at the counter (don't be discouraged if you see a line--we almost were because it looked endless, but it truly moved really, really quickly) and another 5 minutes to get our order, so within 15 minutes, we were able to get our hands on these orgasmic sandwiches. Honestly I can say that the P'tit Talbot is one of the best sandwiches I've had the pleasure of devouring. The chicken was so flavorful and juicy and plentiful and the bread perfectly soaked up the sauce, so each bite was chock full of deliciousness. The sauce was so good, in fact, that I actually did end up leaving with a bottle of it to take back home to the states. Merry Christmas to me! The only negative about this place is how dang far it is from me. Any chance you guys could open up a store in NYC, Ma Poule Mouillée?! Thxxxxx."

The reviews and videos did not disappoint!This restaurant is a must to go to in Montreal.This restaurant has portugese chicken that they grill in a spicy pepper sauce.Let me tell you, the chicken is ADDICTIVE. I was in Montreal for 5 days and ate here 3 times of the 5 days. It was so good that I purchased a jar of their sauce.Portions are HUGE too!The restaurant is small and seating is limited, so I would recommend taking out when its busy or going during a time where not a lot of people are eating (2-4pm).Everything is good. Anything you order will not disappoint!When ordering you order from the cook when you walk in. Once you get your food, you move down the line where you can purchase drinks or portugese pastries, and once you get to the cash reegister, you pay.The staff speaks some english, but not in depth, so if you have questions, ask in french.Great great place.

The people who stand in a much  longer line across the street at La Banquise are suckers, Ma Poule Mouillée's Poutine is 10x better.The chicken here is cooked perfectly and consistently. Combined with the chorizo , cheese , piri piri, gravy and fries it is the perfect dish and an insanely good deal at $9 for a small (the large is gigantic and $14.) Service is quick since they're constantly roasting chickens. It's a small restaurant but you can also grab a bottle of wine and take it to Parc La Fontaine to have a picnic if it's nice outside. The pastel de natas are tasty as well. Even though this place isn't especially near my apartment or a metro I will go out of my way to eat here every chance I get."

/user_details?userid=DgLYl_RrquiEQBe3maBNvA,Angela W.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This is probably one of my favourite restaurants during my recent visit to Montreal! The food here is very flavourful and I'm craving for it as I'm writing this review. Starting off with the interior of this restaurant... it's more of a takeout place than a full service restaurant. There are some chairs and tables but for the most part, it's a bit cramped when there are people lining up for food. How it works is that you order at the counter and then proceed to pay. Then you will take your food to a table if you can find an empty spot or take it to go. The food comes fast because I think everything has been pre-prepared. The whole menu is mostly consisting of different combos of chicken meat, chorizo, fries, etc. So I'm guessing they all can be prepared ahead and ready to go in a short amount of time.For the food, we got the much raved Portuguese chicken poutine. It was so amazing and definitely worth the hype! The chicken was very flavourful and everything came together perfectly. Personally I thought this was the best poutine I've had in Montreal. The other food we had was just a plate of chicken and chorizo with salad and fries. Again, everything here tasted amazing. One thing about the place here is that the food portion sizes are pretty big. My boyfriend usually can eat a lot but he was very stuffed by the end. We got the regular sized poutine but I think a small size would have been better. I would definitely come here again when I'm in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=vCUeFAY774VtmpszX9hyGA,Nataly N.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"I think I made a mistake trying to be healthy(ish) here by ordering the grilled chicken and chorizo salad (Salade Mathilde). It was HUGE! And I think there was way too much meat for it to truly qualify as a ""salad."" It's probably meant to be shared between 2 people or one very hungry athlete!There was a good amount of lettuce and freshly-cut onions, carrots, and peppers, as well as a generous amount of sliced chorizo and grilled chicken (looked like both light and dark meat). It was definitely good value for less than $15 with tax. There were a few things that didn't make this the ideal dish to get here, however... While the chicken was nicely marinated, I felt there was a bit of a flavor clash between the chicken, chorizo, and salad dressing. Potatoes would probably have paired better with these meats. Also, the chicken tasted a bit cold and dry. I saw them cut it fresh, but I think they had grabbed it from a pile of ready-made chicken that was already off the grill. Overall, great value, quick service, and friendly staff, but I'd maybe recommend prioritizing the warm dishes rather than the entrée salad."

If you're going at lunch time, be prepared for a crowded, hot restaurant and a long line with little room to sit. Still, totally worth it!If you don't eat meat, you'll want to skip this one. If you do, come hungry! Our first meal in Montreal and I'll warn you that any normal sized plate (and even the small poutine fries) can be shared by 2 people. My husband and I shared #13 which included chicken, chorizo, beef, fries, and salad and we couldn't even come close to finishing it. Our friends got a poutine plate and a salad and neither of them finished either. Even If you're used to large American portions, you're going to feel like you've been getting cheated your whole life when you see how much food you get and for what price!Every bite was simply delicious and we could soon see why the entire neighborhood seemed to be packed into this narrow restaurant.

Did my head explode from sampling the greatest food ever assembled on God's green earth? No. A victim of its own success, you have to line up to be served, converse with staff who are rushed and stressed, and finally be lucky enough to find a seat if you don't feel like taking the food to go. Like Schwartz's, and Banquise (across the street), this is not a user friendly experience. I had the poutine (what else?). The chicken is extremely tender, the fries are quite tasty, the chorizo is authentic, the cheese is plentiful, and the gravy is comforting. The shortcoming of this dish is that the chicken is chopped up into small strands which don't seem to have any crispy skin. The chicken is then submerged in the sauce and fries thereby losing some of it's distinct charcoal taste and texture. I'd like to try this dish with a chicken breast and thigh chopped up with the skin and placed ON TOP of the otherwise completed dish of poutine. That way, you can mix and match between bites of chicken as a distinct experience while mixing the protein up into the poutine at your own pace.It's still a really satisfying dish. I just think it can be improved with a few small tweaks. I look forward to trying their standard chicken dishes next time."

If you have kids, ditch the stroller at home and pack light. There are two steps to enter the restaurant and doors before each step to contend with.

It sucked struggling to enter the restaurant then struggling to move out of everyone's way. I'm used to NYC restaurants with a Lilliputian footprint but I still wasn't prepared for how small Ma Poule Mouillée was.My French is horrible but the woman taking my order was kind and switched to English quickly. My kids have food allergies and she knew the menu well. My daughter is anaphylactic to wheat and allergic to all nuts and dairy. She was able to enjoy the French fries without any issues.

Poutine is the food symbol of Montreal and so, my mother and I must of course sample it, and this place was very promising. I expected a long line and there was. We were thankfully not forced to stand outside, but the line was to the door, though that may be because of the set up of the restaurant that had people standing in line with the door. The line moves fairly quickly though as the people working here have a great assembly process that you get to watch live. There is inside seating, though with the busyness of the place, I wouldn't rule out ordering to go.I opted to order the ""Bon, les Portugais Font de la Poutine,"" which I called the ""Number 8"" because I was afraid of butchering my French pronunciation in my first day back in a Francophone area. I ordered the large which was a large plate that was plenty to fill the stomachs of both me and my mother. The cheese bits were tasty; the gravy was rich and soaked the fries well so that I didn't have any plain fries (plain fries are a a bit of a nightmare for me by the way); the chicken and sausage offered a meaty dimension to the poutine. It was a decent poutine! The last bite was amazing because I amassed enough cheese with the meat and potato  that created an excellent flavor and texture combination. You can opt for a pitcher of water for the table if you don't buy the water bottles (which you shouldn't because water should always be free).The menu looks fabulous and if I had more time up here, I would come back to try the other options."

We were contemplating if we should get the chicken and chorizo in Salad or poutine version. We ended up getting the large  poutine and the size is as big as my head! Most of the dish is made up of the fries though. I like the dish overall but I wished they give more chicken. Get the spicy sauce to help balance the poutine sauce. Else, it may tastes monotonous after a while. Two of us were not able finish one large poutine. If you want to avoid too much carb and want more chicken, get the non poutine version!"
/user_details?userid=wABHp4fGUC-0acRKhmQO2A,Diana X.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"I got the poutine with chicken and chorizo. The chicken was pretty standard. Although it was impressive to see the rotating skewers of meat behind the counter, I didn't get much of a flavor from the meat that ended up on my plate. The chorizo also had a funky taste that didn't mesh well with the whole dish, and I found myself picking them out to set aside. Combined with the gravy, the dish was also a little over-salted.  I ordered the petite, which was still a huge portion and an excellent value if you're looking to split with someone. The cheese curds in the poutine were tasty, the fries pretty average - maybe I'm not a poutine person because nothing really blew me away.I visited after the lunch rush, sometime in the afternoon. Fortunately I didn't encounter a line."

Though I must say it's also a part of the ""experience"" :)The worst thing here is the attitude from the cashier. She got wrong items for me twice, and she still gave me that attitude without any apologies or awareness of her own mistakes.Looking back, I found this experience a bit ironic since the people who work at the grills are quite nice and polite, but somehow the cashier who doesn't have to be in the grill heat can't seem to do her job properly."

Also, all the baked goods are sold at the second counter if you wanted to grab a couple of Portuguese egg tarts to go.I ordered half a chicken with a side of fries and salad - ALL for just $12! The amount of food we got for the price paid was amazing. i also wanted to try some Pastel de Natas (egg tarts) and ordered a couple as well. The rotisserie style chicken was slightly crispy on the outside and very moist on the inside. I loved their fries and salad as well. It takes a lot of guts (pun intended) to finish this plate of food. It was so good that I finished it all. The egg tarts were very flaky and sweet. It was such a filling meal!The only problem here is the limited amount of seating. We had to wait a couple of minutes for people to leave in order to grab a seat.

Walk in to a small restaurant filled with a delicious aroma to find a counter with several men turning chickens and taking orders. The menu is simple (French only) and on the wall, but easy to figure out. You order from the guy who nods you over first, and he assembles your meal in front of you. You tell him if you want spicy sauce or not, grab a tray, he plops the food down, and you continue down the counter to pay the cute Portuguese ladies. We got the chicken sandwich with fries ($8) and the salad ($11). I saw many couples splitting the half chicken with salad and fries for $12 which is a GIANT portion and definitely doable with two. As you can see, the salad was everything I ever want in a salad- an absolutely giant mound of lettuce, onion, tomato, covered in totally fall off the bone chicken in spicy sauce. The sandwich was pretty good although I prefer my chicken alone. The fries were perfect- crisp, salty, seasoned to perfection. We sat and watched people fly by the counter, listening to the chefs whistle and enjoying each bite. Visit the park next door!! So beautiful as well."

First off for the sausage, unless you are planning to share, starving, or just feeling extra gluttonous lol, order the half portion. The whole sausage can feed atleast 4 to 5 hungry people. Flavor is exceptional, sooo tasty but not heavy at all. Same goes with the chicken, you taste the spices, that smoky charcoal flavor, soo juicy. The fries are extra crispy and soak up all those juicy chicken flavors. Ask for their specialty hot sauce, add the right amount of kick to the dishes! I would def recommend this place and will come back for more! (FYI, how Montrealers say it the ""Maudites"" taxes are already included in prices)"
/user_details?userid=r9Wii37p0kEDIUt2e2_LqQ,Randy F.,"Palo Alto, CA",4 star rating,"Portuguese Chicken Rotisseries are a popular bargain eatery in Montreal.  Romados and Ma Poule Mouillée are two of the most popular with crowds throughput the day.  We stopped by Ma Poule Mouillée at 4:45 pm and sure enough there still was a crowd and line, although not as long as nearby Poutine spot L'Banquise. Many people order by telephone to skip the lines and many also opt for take-out as the seating is fairly limited for how popular the spot is.  Menus are all in French, but it's pretty easy to figure out what to order as the most popular items are the 1/2 or 1/4 chicken with fries and salad or the Poutine.  Staff are friendly and able to handle orders in English as there are plentiful tourists here too. Upon entering, you have a nice view of the kitchen and see racks of chicken rotating in the rotisserie and loads of potatoes being deep fried into fries. Our order:Whole Chicken - $15. I opted for the whole chicken as I didn't feel like a house salad or more fries given I was also ordering the Poutine.  I asked if I could have all dark meat but I'm not sure they understood, but I did get a lot of thigh meat.  The chicken is moist and flavorful with a great skin and a nice sauce (spicy or normal) that they add on afterwards.  In some ways, this is like a Costco Chicken and I mean that in a good way. Poutine - $12. While the chicken is good, the Poutine is what puts this place over the top and past any Costco.  It's a huge portion (also available in small) of freshly fried fries, covered with delicious fresh cheese curds, topped with rotisserie chicken, Portuguese chouriço and a special house sauce(if you want everything) and then smothered in hot brown gravy.   It's a caloric and salt bomb but I loved it.  I was worried the fries would get soggy but they expertly put the cheese curd to absorb most of the heat and melt as well as the meats.  I didn't care as much for the sausage but this is one of the best poutines I've had even with that. Portuguese egg tarts - they have a whole dessert and baked goods section that you order at the cashier after you bring your chicken items to the front.  We opted for the Portuguese egg tarts and they were beautiful.  I've had these many times with the Macau influence on Hong Kong bakeries but this more traditional Portuguese version is sweeter with a super flakey and crispy crust.  Worth ordering. Soup - $3. This is a new item and i was secretly hoping for a clear broth like at Portland's Nong's Khao Man Gai.  Instead it's a creamy soup broth with bits of chicken, carrot and more. I'd say this is skippable. Overall, this is a bargain spot in Montreal.  The portions are huge, the food (especially the Poutine) tasty and delicious, and the variety enough to make this a good stop if you have a few days in Montreal.  Just prepare to wait and go off hours as they have continuous hours.  Ma Poule Mouillée accepts credit cards including Amex."

I went to La Banquise the day before and thought that this poutine was better.I had the Portuguese poutine as recommended by a local that was standing next to me. They saw me drowning in the vast menu and decided to give me a life raft. I like this poutine for the following reasons: the sauce was seasoned with spices (not spicy), the little bits of chorizo added a layer of flavor, and they had tender pieces of chicken mixed in. I can't emphasize how every part of this poutine was seasoned whereas the poutine at La Banquise is like the equivalent of nachos.

There was a long line for Ma Poule Mouillee. It probably took us around 30 minutes to get in. Food is cheap here and portions are big. It was approximately 70 CAD to feed the 8 people.I definitely recommend you stop by here if you are craving for some poutine. We ordered the following:- Portuguese Chicken - Chicken was delicious and the meat was tender.- Salad Matilde (Chicken Salad) Great to share between 2 people. - Combo Veronique (fries, salad, grilled chicken combo) Huge portion. Note that the fries that come in this combo is not the poutine ones. It's just plain fries. - Poutine with cheese, chicken, and chorizo - This is the highlight of Ma Poule Mouillee. The poutine is slightly spicy but nothing you shouldn't be able to handle. It has a nice kick in the mouth. It's a bit on the salty side so remember to have a beverage on hand.- Portuguese Tarts - Decided to try some Portuguese tarts per Yelp's recommendation and they were just OK. I was a little let down by this because I had such high hopes for this. This was too sweet for me. I mean like half a tart was more than enough for me. The center of the tart is very eggy and pudding like. The crust was layered but it was slightly chewy. I am not sure if the chewiness is attributed to the fact that the tart has been baked earlier in the day and sitting on the counter for a while. I actually like the Chinese Portuguese Tart from Taipan in NYC more. The Chinese version is more layered and flakier. It's has a nice crunch and it's also less sweet."

It's a great spot to grab food and head over to Parc Lafontaine.We dropped in on a Sunday afternoon (around 2:00pm) and it was busy. We lucked out and snagged two tables at their patio outside.The menu is up on the walls; the menu du jour is a nice change up. They had three options (calamari, mixed combo, beef brochette and salmon).Trip #1- Combo mixte ($14.00) - such a good deal. You get a salad, fries and meat; chicken (two thighs and a drumstick), pork chops and sausage. I have no idea how you can finish this alone but it's perfect for sharing. Pork chops were incredibly tender, sausage had a nice bit of heat and the chicken was moist. Get it piquant (spicy!). - 4x Natas ($1.50) - still as good and creamy as last time. Totally hit the spot. Trip #2- Tony alves (#1) ($15.00) - whole chicken. We got it spicy. A little greasy but overall, pretty good.- Grilled calamari ($15.00) - this took forever to come out and it was a really small portion. Quite oily but not bad. Probably not worth the price point. Stick with the chicken. - A salada matilde (#10) ($9.00 large) - we got a large salad without the chicken. The best part was the homemade honey Dijon salad.- Bon, les Portugais font de la poutine ($14.00 large) - poutine with São Jorge cheese, chicken and grilled sausage. This was the best out of three poutines we ate (the other two were from La Banquise). Good fries, good cheese and tender meats. A small ($9.00) is more than enough.- 2x Le p'tit talbot (#5) ($6.00) - chicken sandwich for my cousin's road trip home. - J'adore mon choriço (#7) ($12.00) - an entire grilled sausage. They put spicy sauce on this as well. Good flavour and well spiced. - Pain grand-mère ($4.00 for 12) - my aunt bought a dozen Portuguese buns for home.- Natas ($1.50), coconut tart ($1.50), peach tart ($2.30) and almond tart ($2.30) - had to get my nata fix in! Still so good and creamy. Other tarts hit the spot. Always come back to MPM to satisfy my Portuguese cravings."

It's a lot of food for under $12 US. I, of course, opted for spicy with extra hot sauce on the side. That stuff isn't very spicy but so very delicious.

The chickens are butterflied whole and grilled on a rotisserie. When you order at the counter your order is made right in front you. The spicy option is not really spicy at all, although the color of the sauce may appears so. The sides whether fries or rice, go well with the chicken. I requested for dark only but either the person did not understand my English or completely ignored my request, as we ended getting half of the chicken which included both dark and white. Not a huge issue as both cuts were moist and tender. Seating inside is a bit cramped and can get hot if you're close to the barbecue pit. A lot of customers took their orders to go to a nearby park which was right across the street. There is also a window display of Portuguese deserts. I tried the Portuguese egg tart. It was sweet and eggy but would have tasted better if served warm, instead of from their refrigerated display. If you take the metro it's located about 1/2 mile. Overall, good chicken and cheap prices."

As for the poutine, I know poutine is generally salty, but I found this too salty for me.

/user_details?userid=IKSmm5MzHF8cMhMolKaIOw,Lorenzo L.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,"During my first visit to Montreal in late December, a Social Media friend told me that I needed to visit this restaurant for their Portuguese chicken. Unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be since they were closed for Christmas holidays. On this particular visit, things worked out much better. This restaurant is located on Rue Rachel, right in front of La Banquise. Since I knew that we will be visiting La Banquise, a stop to Ma Poule Mouillée was a given. Thankfully this restaurant is open earlier than the ones here in Ontario (9am). Also by coming in early, we avoided the lineup situation. However, there are still people coming in during the morning and that should be a good indicator about the quality of their food. Street parking is available but is limited to time and day. This eatery is a cafeteria type of style as you place your order, get your food and pay. There's small communal/hall style tables along with counter seating. As soon as you pay, you will be provided with cutlery and after you are done, you need to clean up after yourself. The prices for their dishes are crazy. You cannot find a whole chicken for $15 here in the GTA. I told the person at the counter that I came from Toronto to try out their chicken as I was here in late December but unfortunately they were closed for the holidays. I was going to try Le Tremblay (1/4 Chicken Breast with salad and rice/fries) but I wanted to try their chorizo too so he recommended me the Combo Veronique and he'll substitute the leg for the breast at no extra charge which I didn't even ask since I was willing to pay extra for it. The chicken and the chorizo were excellent. Best Portuguese chicken that I ever had. Chicken was soft and moist and the grilled chorizo was flavourful with a little kick. The only blemish will be the side dishes as the rice was bland and the salad was nothing special. The sauce helps give flavour to the rice. Also, as I was leaving, the man at the counter gifted me a pastel de nata, free of charge. This was very much appreciated and unexpected. I like Portuguese chicken as I work in a city with a large Portuguese population and visited a few restaurants in Brampton and Mississauga serving this dish. However, I didn't find any of them to be excellent as the chicken is usually a bit dry or a bit tough. So why is it that I have to come to Montreal for a place that does the chicken right? I know that places in the GTA, have rotisserie ovens but this place grill their chicken inside on charcoal. You will be leaving the restaurant smelling like the chicken so be warned. Besides their chicken and chorizo, they also do sandwiches, poutine and pastries. That pastel de nata was legit! They have earned a customer for life as I will be visiting this place every time I'm in Montreal. Highly recommended! #67 of 2018"
/user_details?userid=CQ67NJigSe5-uBDX3b_CUw,Michael L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Came to this place on a recommendation that it's cheap, tasty, and huge portions. It was raining outside, but there was still a small line leading out the door. The other option was a fondue place across this street and this poutine place with 100 people in line, so we decided to stick with this option. And it was an excellent choice.This restaurant is pretty much self service. Enter, place an order, proceed down the counter to pickup your order. One section for walk-in, another section for phone orders. Just look at the signs hanging from the ceilings for instructions. Don't forget to grab a jug of water and some cups. You should also clean up when you're done.Getting a table might be a bit tricky. We were fortunate that a family was finishing up. You might consider just getting it to go if you know a place to sit down.Their specialty is Portuguese roasted chicken. You can see their kitchen with 50 chickens on the grill at the same time. You can get chicken on its own, or with fries and salad. They also offer chorizo as well as poutine that comes with their chicken.The chicken is really cheap. You can get half a chicken on its own for $11, or a whole chicken on its own for $14. Talk about upsizing, why would you not get the whole chicken? We had three legs, wings, thighs, and a back. Or something like that. Meat was very tender and juicy, and the marinating was amazing. They have a basic poutine for $8, or you can get their deluxe poutine for $13 for this massive plate of poutine filled with potatoes, chicken, cheese curds, chorizo, and their special gravy. Do not underestimate the size of the poutine, you can probably split it between 3 or 4 people easily. Comes with a lot of chunks of chicken as well. Definitely worth trying.I later found out that the poutine place across the street had over 1000 yelp reviews, but whatever, you will not be disappointed coming here. Well, maybe if you were looking for somewhere romantic."

The gravy was delicious and the chicken was perfectly cooked (extra points for the crispy bites every once in a while). The fries were perfectly seasoned and cooked right in front of us. It wasn't too spicy, which I appreciated. We definitely didn't need the large order; I'd say it's a good size for 3-4 hungry people.

Arguably one of the best poutine I've had in MTL. Move over La Baquise (it's across the street) Both restaurants had seemingly daunting line-ups on a Saturday peek dinner hour. Banquise had a slightly larger tourist crowd. So ya.. Banquise crowd, come over to ma poule if you're getting impatient. They same poutine will probably run you double the price.

There was no way around it - the whites were devoid of any moisture, and the dark meat was even beginning to dry out. The spicy sauce was good, but not memorable, and it came with way too little of it. The salad and rice were an afterthought (which is understandable for a chicken place).

Finally you place an order with one of the cooks and then marvel at the speed with which they put together your dinner. I opted for the spicy (it really wasn't spicy at all) 1/4 chicken breast and my partner had the thigh but they handed the orders to us without saying which was which and the generous portion of fried hides the chicken from view so we were a few bites in before we noticed. I'd order extra sauce next time. The poutine also looks delicious and for $8 it's a great big portion. We rounded off the meal with a Portuguese tart.

This place, hands down, deserves a standing ovation for their poutine. Phenomenal food. Fast, friendly, and hella tasty eats!!Before this, I'd only had one single encounter with poutine, and that was a bite of the dish at The Rossi. The gravy was tan and opaque (I don't like traditional gravy, the Thanksgiving mainstay), and the curds were small, minimal and way overly salty. Not a good first impression. I was wary to try Montreal's staple dish, but I can forever rest my nerves! Canadian poutine's gravy is beef based. Smooth and thin/runny. And bursting with flavor! I got #9 - Traditional poutine, but with the addition of chicken and chorizo.Visualize: A heaping pile of fresh hot seasoned French fries smack out of the basket. A giant scoop of fresh cheese curds spread atop. One-fourth pulled Portuguese-sauced/seasoned chicken straight from the spits. Tons of chorizo. And, a big ol ladle of beef gravy. Fresh cilantro, and the exceptional meal is ready for consumption. I will absolutely, no questions asked make this a must-stop restaurant from now on, when I'm in Montreal.

I like the Chorizo very much.I will try number 7 next time.I really like the touch of spicy you can choose to add, adding an extra layer of flavor for my buds. One thing to be improved is the sausage should be warmed up a little since the gravy can't fully heat up the sausage and the cheese. We had some cold bite on the sausage which sabotage the hearty taste.

This place takes the cake and was worth the time it took to line up for the restaurant. I went around 7pm on a Sunday and at that time there was already line out the door and down the street. Right across the street was La Banquise which is also known for their poutine. The line for this restaurant was a lot longer. We mainly came to the area on the recommendation of someone so we decided to stick with it. We waited for an hour to get in which is the longest I have ever had to wait for food. At that point, it could have all gone downhill from there, had the food been not up to par but all was well! Someone in line had mentioned that the portions were big and thankfully we decided to trust them. We opted for a petite poutine and the 1/2 chicken with salad. Boy, were we glad we decided to trust them.  I would suggest to get it in a take out container as I am sure there will be leftovers. The gravy of the sauce paired well with the chorizo and rotisserie chicken. The fresh cheese curds were so delicious. The fries were crispy but soft in the middle. Honestly, the BEST poutine I have ever had and my mouth waters at the thought of having it.

It was the spicy sauce. Not too spicy at all though. Just perfect. Please put it in a pint and give me a straw ok. I don't care who's watching honestly. I found myself dipping burnt crispy chicken skin in this sauce and smiling like a kid on Christmas morning. Pro Tip btw, get the sauce on the side because that's the best way to not have your chicken skin sog out and still dip your chicken in and control your sauce to chicken ratio. Wow I can't believe I just typed out that sentence.Anyways, I'm not one for dessert but I am one for trying indigenous foods done right when I have the chance. So save room for the Nata sweet egg custard pastry. What a way to top off the meal."
/user_details?userid=XnWTpZeb0atyolIc5-XRUw,Mike P.,"Spokane, WA",5 star rating,"This is the spot, amazing food at a great price. I split a full order of poutine fries with chorizo and 1/2 chicken between my friend and I. We left full and content.The flavor on the chicken is great with a good blend between spices and a bit of tang from the sauce they use. The chicken can be a little dry in some of the leaner areas but when they're running a busy operation like this, I can't expect it to be perfect. The poutine fries with chorizo is a must order. You know cause everyone else ordered it, even that small 5 feet girl sitting in the corner has a plate to herself. We had the opportunity to try both this spot and Romados. I have to give it to Ma Poule due to the better flavor on the chicken in my opinion. In addition, maybe it's unfair to Romados since I came when they weren't busy but my food was a little cold. Even my cheese curds on the poutine didn't melt. Whereas at Ma Poule where there was a bit of a wait and they were churning out the food with speed, steam was coming off of the food the whole meal since it came right off the grill.In the end, for roughly 24 CAD, you'll be thinking of Ma Poule in your sleep and walking home with a smile on your face. ALSO, get the egg tarts. It was so good and only 1.50 each! It was more custard like but I enjoyed this variation more than the Chinese style. Tl;dr: Eat here. Poutine fries. Egg tarts. Ma Poule is your go to for Portuguese chicken."

Their food comes out fast, and - most importantly - the chicken is moist, fresh and very very flavorful. There are many Portuguese chicken places in Montreal that get the spice right, but the chicken dry, or vise versa. But Ma Poule Mouillee is rightly named. For a cheap price, you can have an entire days meal, grilled right, with great smoky and spicy flavors."

Portuguese establishments on Rachel street seriously get their chicken right!!I opted for their chicken sandwich it was fantastic. Big portion, succulent moist chicken... can't ask for more for the very reasonable price they asked of me. I also picked up some pastel de natas tarts (Portuguese sweet tarts) and they really made my day.  The sandwich and dessert were 5 stars and I'll be back for these over and over again when I find myself in this area.The reason I'm giving 4 stars is that I found their service lacking. It looked like everyone was having a bad day and couldn't be bothered. Sure, I got my food in about 10 minutes but the effort to interact with their clients was virtually non-existent.  My order was placed not with a Hello or Welcome, he just looked at me and raised his eyebrows... so I placed my orde. When I got to the cash, the cash guy billed me before I asked if I wanted anything else with my sandwich such as a drink or dessert. I had to insist to get this and he seemed slightly bothered he had to edit the price in the cash register and grab the extra items.I understand there's sometimes a line-up that goes all the way to the door but that shouldn't be an excuse to have the common decency to acknowledge your patron's needs. During my visit, only 2 patrons were in front of me and when I paid, 2 of them were behind me. You should be happy to have such business.Beyond that, this place is the real deal when it comes to Portuguese food, very very good stuff beyond the silly establishment's name."
/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Dilemmas, dilemmas... Romados or Pouille Mouillée? Both serving similar foods, both having lines at peak hours, both having limited seating, both offering kinda affordable prices... The choice can be tough at times... Let's try to review this resto to see if it comes out as a winner in this duel.To get started, the lines to be expected are sometimes very long, but at most times, you will be waiting around 15 minutes until you get to order, which is not as bad. However, since the restaurant is fairly small, the line tends to extend outside, which might not be very pleasant during winter when it is like -35 degrees outside. Once inside, you get a choice of different meals, which also includes poutines. Personally, I go for either the thigh or half-chicken meal, which comes with sides of salad and fries. The prices displayed on the wall also includes the taxes already.Now the food. The chicken itself is well seasoned with tender meat. Portions are also generous, especially the fries. Honestly, the fries are a little lackluster as its seasoning is very hit or miss and unevenly distributed. Bottomline, the fight is still on between the both of them. But one thing that I can agree on, this is better than that notorious poutine place across the street..."

Ma Poule Mouillée was apparently the place to get it. After navigating some treacherous and impossibly confusing roadwork in the area, my girlfriend ran in to get our on-the-road takeout that we were to enjoy on our Trans-Canadian Highway road trip to Toronto.We each went with 1/2 chicken, French fries, and salad. The chicken was absolutely amazing, seasoned to perfection and bursting with flavor. The sauce makes it even better - I went with the spicy sauce. The fries were nothing to write home about in my opinion but did have a unique chicken taste to them that made them enjoyable. Overall - very, very good."
/user_details?userid=LbdanfyiHBjcyopP6gz5xQ,J T.,"Pittsburgh, PA",4 star rating,"Absolutely worth the near hour walk from my hotel in downtown Montreal to Ma Poule Mouillee to try their poutine. The petite poutine was definitely filing for one person.  Fries were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  They held up well to the melted cheese curds and gravy to maintain crispness.  The addition of the chicken and chorizo though adds so much depth and flavor.  Adding the picante sauce is a must for that little bit of heat.  I'm a huge Portuguese food fan and this definitely gave me a unique taste. Also had a natas, which I must say was probably the best one I had the entire time in Montreal (and I tried them three different places). While they were cold (unlike ones you get in Lisbon where they are warm with added powdered sugar and cinnamon on top), they were absolutely spot on for consistency and taste.The only draw back is the line.  No matter when you go, there is a line out the door.  Took about 20-30 mins to get through from entering the line to receiving food, but certainly worth it.  Just not something you could stop and get if you were pressed for time.I shall be back!"

Lining up across at La Banquise for over an hour in the cold didn't sound too pleasing. So once we found out it was mostly bbq Portuguese chicken, we hoped over and waited about 25 minutes before we could order. The style is line up, including out the door, order from a selected menu and then pay. The best part: taxes are included!! Happy:  I had the chicken salad and it was bigger than I imagined. It came with lots of juicy chicken pieces. Not dry at all. As the resto name suggested, ""my wet chicken"". Also, tomatoes, shredded carrots and red onions added a real nice touch. It was a large portion! My partner had the chicken sausage poutine and it didn't disappoint at all. Too much fries for one person. I picked some out. Not happy:  Of course, the wait time to order your food. The sitting environment was limited and crowded. Basically, eat and go.   Verdict:  a must try and I loved my meal for just $10.

The fries were also quite soft which didn't help the case at all.

He must have thought I was a weirdo because I kept looking at him. The staff were nice, very friendly people. If you're just buying a whole chicken, you can ask one of the guys and bypass the line.

I got the Portuguese chicken, with the sausage and piri-piri sauce on my poutine. Oh. My. God. I was in heaven. I loved it! It was so full of flavour and they're very generous with their toppings. Normally, I run out of toppings for my fries but with them, I ran out of fries with my toppings. It was simply delicious! Towards the end, it was getting too salty. I mean, cheese, gravy, piri-piri, sausage and what not. I got the spicy piri-piri and it wasn't that spicy. It was more like a kick to it, but nothing too strong. I'm not a spicy eater, so if it really was spicy, I wouldn't be able to eat it. Overall, highly recommended place. If you like Portuguese chicken and the works, have it on your poutine and life will be good! At least for that moment."

The poutine here is my new high bar for what a poutine should be.For ten bucks you get a massive poutine, good for two people.On this poutine you get the usual curds but also a heaping mountain of freshly diced charcoal roasted chicken and portugese chorizo. The sauce piquante is the crowning jewel. A little bit spicy and full of flavour.Line moves fast, eat here."

As a chicken lover, I was craving for spicy Portuguese chicken and this is my first time and it was one of a hell amazing choice that I made. Getting there, I noticed how huge the portions were while they were serving the people in line. I waited in line around 5 minutes and i was served. I asked for the petit talbot with fries. Omg, the portions are huge and everything is made by them which was great, the marination of the spices, the breads as they bake it fresh at the restaurant as well as their huge selection of Pastries! I was surprised to see so much of their love and efforts  put into their foods. I paid and got a Portuguese egg tarts too and it was delicious. Love the egg tarts, it's probably one of the best I've ever had in Montreal so far! It's $1.50 for 1 but if you get 6, it costs $7. They also have other pastries like mille Feuille, croissants, crème filled cakes which looks so good! At my first bite of my chicken sandwich in that spicy sauce, I was already satisfied and fell in love with it! I definitely wish that they put more of spicy sauce on their sandwiches and chicken as I wanted mine spicy when I told the man who served me as I love when my foods are spicy. They have such cute way of presentation too with their layouts as well as the chalk board menu. Overall, I was happy for my first visit and I'd recommend it all if you all wanted Portuguese chicken as it's moist and consistent with the spicy Sauce which they sell as well! That sauce is a family recipe which to me means a lot as it's passed down.  They are all so nice. :)I'd return to check out their huge plate of Poutine next time but my tummy was happy after crushing my fun-filled plate with chicken sandwich and chips and dessert as well. :)"

Portuguese chicken is just phenomenal when you're craving something quick and hearty. When I heard I could get it after 8pm (Ma Poule Mouillée closes at 10pm week nights) I couldn't wait to try it.I've now been twice to Ma Poule Mouillée and it lives to its hype. The portions are enormous it has to be one of the best bank for your buck meals! You order at the counter from one of the chalkboard menu items. Everything I've tried and seen there is delicious! The spicy sauce for the chicken is delicious and packed with flavour. Tip: they take phone orders so you can cut the line if you plan ahead.

They put chicken and cherizo in it, I also think the cheese includes some mozarella in addition to cheese curds which makes it more gooey. The portions are enormous so be weary of ordering a large, unless you're going to share, or if you want to bring it home ;) The prices are great, you get a lot of bang for your buck.A typical order would be chicken with salad and fries, fills your plate (and belly) right up, for only 11$ (tax included).There's usually a line, but sometimes you get lucky."
/user_details?userid=t-0_us3OTzs_ZhKy6fcamg,Dawn M.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Came here on the enthusiastic recommendation of colleagues. But I should have just realized that roast chicken is not my cup of tea. I've never had a roast chicken that wasn't dry before, and this was no exception. However, it was GREAT value for the money and I really enjoyed being in a local hotspot.The chicken is roasted over charcoal, which is wonderful and very enticing to watch - but I noticed with some dismay that the chicken they serve to you is pulled from a drawer beneath the grill - they collect all their cooked chicken in those bins for serving. I think they could have been roasted a shade less time, and if they plucked them straight from the grill onto your plate it would have been a lot more delicious - and hotter!I ordered the Combo Véronique, which came with a chicken leg and a segment of chouriço, as well as fries and salad. The chouriço was tasty but cold and very, very salty. I think the best part was the fries. They were delicious - and seasoned! My colleagues told me to make sure I got the hot sauce and I'm so glad I did, because it was heavenly over the awesome fries. The hot sauce was not very hot at all, but tasted like a garlicky butter with a very subtle kick. That was the best part of the meal by far.I also got a passionfruit soda, and a nata tart per my colleague's recommendation. I really enjoyed the soda because we don't have anything like it in Toronto, and it is not too sweet. The nata...also another one of those things that should have realized and accepted is just not my thing. But it was well made and would make any nata fan happy.Overall I'm glad I came and braved the long line, but not my cup of tea. Had I not been alone, I would have been interested to try their poutine! I heard good things about it and it's MASSIVE and it looked good!"

I have no idea how everyone else is ordering the regular and finishing it)The issue is that after it's prepared, you continue to wait in line to pay (another 5 min or so).  By the time I sat down to eat, my poutine was much colder...fries no longer crispy, cheese curds barely softened.The chicken itself was delicious, but I didn't eat most of the fries or curds.So...basically, poutine was cold by the time I got to eat."

I read the comments before and read lots of them saying how big the portions are over there. Man, they were all right about that! We ordered a quarter chicken plate and a small poutine for 2 people and it was more than enough! We step in the restaurant and the line up kept going for the whole time we were there. The place is small with not many seats but we managed to get a table. The menu is written on the wall. The prices are really reasonable for the size portion they give. The portugese chicken was slightly dry inside but it was well marinated on the outside. As long as they keep the same quality and prices, I will definitely come back again!"

They obviously specialize in chicken but the portion sizes are big and the prices are good. For $11, you can get a half chicken, fries and salad (Louis Cyr dish) or for $9 you can get a quarter chicken with fries and a salad! The Natas (Portuguese egg tarts) are also a must try ($1.50 each). What's great about the chicken joint is that all the prices include tax already so whatever price you see, is what you're paying for. They do tend to have quite the line up but trust me, it's well worth the wait since the food is not only flavorful but plentiful. They have seats inside as well as a small patio outside -- first come first serve after you order and wait for your food. I would say they are quite efficient given the line up and also very friendly! I would definitely return to try the chicken sandwich!"

Speaking of which, the poutine is the best we had all trip (didn't even bother going across the street). Mounds of chicken and chorizo on top of their awesome fries with curds, gravy, and house sauce. First time my fiancée wasn't let down by poutine the whole trip. The chuleta sandwich was pretty delicious. Their natas are on point. We came back 3 times during our week stay in Montreal.Portions are huge (even the ""small"" poutine strained the 2 of us). And prices are so reasonable (cheap even) for how much great quality food you get, I was starting get suspicious that they obtain free potatoes and huge discounts on chicken.

It's probably equal parts roasted Portuguese chicken, chorizo and fries. Then there's the spicy sauce. And the San Jorge cheese. Heaven for poutine-a-holics. I shared the Louis Cyr (half chicken +fries and salad) and small Poutine with my bf and we were so full afterwards. Long lineups, but you can skip the line if you plan a bit ahead and order by phone.

That was a very poor mistake on our behalf. 1 large poutine is more than enough to feed 3 people. We were all struggling to finish our portions and admitted defeat.The chicken is juicy, well-seasoned, and aromatic. The gravy was also very flavourful, which complimented the cheese curds nicely. My favourite part was the sausage though. Those little nuggets were full of flavour and I kind of wanted a whole sausage afterwards.Be warned, it is a little bit on the salty side due to all the well-seasoned components.All in all, my family and I would come back in a heartbeat!TL;DR Portions are huge for the price!

There was a line up, but it was only maybe 1/4 of what Banquise had. So it was my boyfriends idea to try this place instead. Best. Idea. Ever. We were a group of 6 people and we were probably lined up for 30 minutes. The process was quick, cafeteria style. Having been back three times now our usual order stays as the Poutine (without the chorizo). I don't think we've ever eaten such delicious poutine in our lives. We live in Toronto and with so many food spots it's unbelievable that the best poutine (in our opinion) is all the way in MTL. We've now made it a thing to drive out at least once a year to stay in Montreal and have our favorite poutine ever. Plus, for the price you pay, ($14?) the sizes are sooo worth it.

A must go.I literally adjusted my eating schedule to avoid Ma Poule Mouillée's long lines; when I came at around 4 during two workdays, there was no line at all. The half-chicken meal is wonderful on all fronts. We went for half fries and half potato balls. The potato balls have a really unique texture and taste. I believe it had a hint of saffron, but the ladies working at the front didn't tell me the seasonings so it's all speculation. The fries were also great; crispy and thick in all the right places. The chicken is also amazing! The spicy sauce is a must-get; it's not just one-dimensional heat that I believe Romados has. Instead, it's a pretty light sauce with a deep flavor accompanied with heat. The salad was also outstanding; fresh vegetables and a yummy honey-mustard-esque dressing. Every aspect of our meal was perfect, and we were astounded by the value and taste.

Even if you haven't eaten all day, it's nearly impossible to finish everything in one sitting. Maybe it's because they give an enormous amount of fries (aka carbs overload), but I was able to wipe the plate clean with the exception of one piece of chicken. The chicken is oh-so-juicy with the spicy sauce actually being somewhat spicy and melding perfectly with the crispness of the skin, the salad is fresh and has an amazing dressing to go along with it, and the French fries aren't overcooked for once.

We did not pay heed to the previous reviews here and ordered half plate poutine (be careful to request no meat as every poutine option here has some or the other form of red meat) and a half chicken thighs. Now every order comes with a mountain of fries!! So we dig in and every bite is soo delish!! Crispness at its perfection! But we did end up eating only half of what we ordered!Now, we also got a couple of pastel de nata which are portuguese custard tarts. We ate those later with coffee and were bite sized delights!"

The food is delicious,  it is so affordable and there's also a seating area outside. It is worth waiting in line for! Don't worry... the lineup goes by pretty fast.The portions are huge!! I had the small poutine which comes with chicken and chorizo. Trust me when I say that if you are eating the poutine by yourself you need to get the small.  The small is so big that I only ate half and took the other half home. My bf ordered the half chicken platter which comes with salad and fries. He also couldn't finish his plate. I tried the chicken and it was so juicy. You also have the option of adding a spicy sauce. It wasn't very spicy but it makes everything taste better. I wish I could buy a bottle n bring it home. I liked it so much I asked for more sauce to take home with me. My bf said the salad was good too. I will definitely be back!"

The place is clean,you smell the BBQ from far away and I decided to pass by hoping the place won't be as busy.I picked the ""Veronique plate"" which you'll find in your order: chicken, chorizo sausage, fries and salad. I do admit on the fact that I love eating a lot and there portions are done to perfection. The skin on chicken is crispy and perfectly seasoned and interior is juicy and so rich.They also do their own bakery which is done by also by other similar restaurants and I loved the idea that they do sell their spicy sauce..

Get large if you have 3 people or your alone and want a heart attack. My second visit was at 9pm on a weekday night, thy close at 10. Food and service was still good. $10 for a 1/4 chicken dinner with fries and salad. Delicious, crispy chicken. Hot sauce is on the tangy side which I prefer over oily side.

Their chicken chorizo poutine is to die: crispy fries topped off with their homemade spicy sauce, chopped chorizo and grilled chicken, cheese curds and gravy. It is definitely one of my favourite guilty pleasures. The only thing that bothers me is the size of the poutine (the small feeds me for two meals and I am not one of those dainty eaters) and its salt content - it can get quite salty!Definitely grab one of those Portuguese sou drinks as well!

My impression of the restaurant itself, however, is better than Romados - the atmosphere was nicer, the place cleaner, and the food not practically thrown in your face, as done at Romados. It's also nicer to eat of a plate instead of a Styrofoam box.  Portions are as big, if not more - and I've seen people empty trays with lots of food on them - evidence to the fact that portions are even too big!Next time - I'll try their poutine - it looked very enticing."

Excellent, affordable prices on everything - like, a whole chicken and all the goodies for $14. Really nice desserts, too. This place is so popular that there's always a line-up out the door. Last time I was here, standing on the street, waiting in line (and waiting in line is actually worth it), the Romados truck circled the block multiple times, trying to lure some of Ma Poule Mouillée's customers up the road to its legendary chicken. You know something good is happening here if Romados is hauling out those tactics! They also do poutine, so if you don't feel like waiting in line at La Banquise, get your poutine here - it's got that amazing chicken sauce, and it comes packed with chorizo. Wowz.

A bit overrated.  I think the Chicken itself is better at Romados.  More flavor and crispier. I do like the ambiance better here and parking seems to be easier.  I asked for rice instead of fries the second time as I did the first. This time he said no rice without explanation. English is their third language after all so I didnt inquire why. My big problem with both of these Portugesse chicken restaurants is that they lack sanitary practices.  I would never order a sandwich because they use their dirty hands w/o gloves.  Not one employee wears glove at either place.  I even saw the cashier touch somebodys fries with bare hands. That is unacceptable to me. No body will touch my food while in front of me.  The Fucking Quebec government likes to control everything. Maybe they should implement better food handling regulations.

Generous portions rotisserie chicken and chorizo sitting on top of a huge platter of fries, and a sort of tasty gravy covering that pile of heart-attack-inducing food. Note: still better than poutine at La Banquise in every aspect.As for chicken, it's less dry than the chicken at Romados, but certainly not very tender/juicy. As for sauce, Romados has a much more flavourful hot sauce than Ma Poule Mouillée.I'd go back for their daily seafood."

As for the food, my group ordered the poutine with chicken and a half chicken with fries and salad. For the four of us we still had a ton of food and had to take it home.

I know, sounds so simple, but it was the quality of everything they served me. Everything they put on my plate was so fresh and full of unique flavor...even the salad dressing. My boyfriend ordered the whole chicken and ate every. last. piece. and then licked the plate (I'm kidding). First off, I'm not sure what they are feeding these chickens, but the were huge, juicy and moist. I've never had a chicken like this in the States. I'm quite sure we had way more chicken than we ordered. Our plates were overflowing with chicken. There chickens were rotisserie cooked and the skin was just so perfect! We each chose the red ""sauce"" they use to make these chickens special. I chose spicy and my boyfriend chose mild. The flavor was so interesting...as the sauce had a ""spice"" or ""heat"" I've not encountered before; it left me wanting more! Almost like a vinegar, butter, salty flavor. Sounds odd, but it works!We ended up visiting this place twice on our four day visit to Montreal. We went once for dinner and a second time for lunch. On our second visit, I ordered the poutine.

After a long day of sightseeing, we wanted dinner within a short walking distance of our hotel. Ma Poule Mouillee fit the bill. Despite the astute Yelp reviews which recommended ordering take out to avoid the long lines, I decided that because it was a rainy Friday night that the line would be short. Sadly, I was dead wrong. We waited well over an hour for our petite poutine, and by then they were out of their famous pastel de nata. Because the restaurant was crowded, we took our food back to the hotel and gobbled it down. The chicken was exceptionally  tender, and the mix of chorizo, cheese curds, gravy, and fries was divine. Be sure to tip the hardworking staff well, as they move at superhuman speed in ridiculously high heat. NOTE: Heed reviewers who advise you to order take out to avoid lines!!!"

The chicken + chorizo + bit of piri-piri sauce makes it indescribable amazing! The fries are very crispy outside and tender inside; even after 20 minutes on the gravy they were still crispy!! (I did take out, and I am a slow eater). Plus, the ""small"" one is big enough (the ""regular"" is huge!) and for just $8 is a bargain.I will definitely keep on coming here!

I ordered the big Portuguese style poutine with chicken, chorizo and piri piri sauce all for $12. The poutine is huge, all the stuff are on top a mountain of fries. On top of the portion being big (which is always good for me) it tastes amazing. The chicken, chorizo and the sauce all had great flavour to add to the good fries, cheese curds & gravy.

Night 1 of my visit I made the 35 min metro trip, followed by a 10 min walk, followed by a 20 min wait... it was worth every second, every penny. Now I had never heard of Poutine before, much less tasted it, but the moment that I opened my box of warm spicy Portuguese styled Poutine I was in love. The fries were fresh, the sauce was somehow sweet and spicy at the same time, the meat was roasted to perfection. Phenomenal. One of the best and most noteworthy meals I have ever had.  Ask for the house special, half portion is pretty large and make sure to get something to drink, the food is hearty.

We got charged for the extra plate of chorizo, that we didn't want. It was way too much food, and between a hungry family of four we couldn't finish all of it. Way too many French fries.

/user_details?userid=oSkz7bxTAoFJxgDGP5wJHg,John H.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Very good, new-ish Portuguese chicken place across from poutine stalwart La Banquise on Rachel. Bright and attractive metal, wood and slate interior; a reassuring hum from the hulking ventilation ducts with the Herculean task of keeping this place from smelling like a fire pit. A mesmerizing whirl of chicken and smoke, slowly rotating over the heat. I watched a more senior staff member point out a small dab of salad dressing that had leaked onto a squeeze bottle, and it was quickly dabbed away with a towel. This level of care befits a serious chicken operation, although I agree with previous reviewers that nothing happens especially fast here. I prefer their chicken to Romados (controversial I know) and to Piri Piri, but not by much. The fries are excellent, tossed with a cracked spice blend that includes fragrant coriander seed. You may wait a while after getting your food before settling at the cash, but no one looks askance if you start eating your fries in the checkout line. I would have liked a self-serve water fountain and condiment dispensers; I did a sad job of tearing open little packets of Heinz ketchup with my greasy, greasy chicken fingers.

Well-seasoned, moist, and roasted on a charcoal rotisserie, which made the skin crispy but not burned. It's deliciousness itself. We ordered the whole chicken and a large plate of potato balls for our family of 2 adults and 4 kids. The chicken was gone in less than 10 minutes. That tells you how good it is. My kids didn't need any prodding to finish their food this time. My husband can't say enough of the sauce they poured on top of the chicken. It's not spicy but very flavorful and complimentary to the chicken. The potato balls were fun to look at, but a bit bland on their own. I also got their Portuguese tarts. They are different from the Chinese egg tarts. The ""cup"" that holds the custard has the texture of a croissant/puff pastry. I wish I knew more French because there was a bit of language barrier with the staff initially.

It was only 2-3 minutes from me giving my order to me paying and walking out the door. I took 2 pcs. of the strudel & a passionfruit Sumol. I much prefer the way they pack the take out orders over Romados, they box the salad separately so it doesn't end up wilted by the time I get home. Every bit as tasty the same price, better service and way, way quicker. Not nearly as much choice of sweets but when I go for chicken I'm after chicken."
/user_details?userid=JstDKWmAZsL026ADFxf7fw,Tony Kangrui L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Legend has it that the the owner of the place used to work for Romados before the fire two years ago. Actually it's barely a secret. And so to answer the burning question of who's best, I personally think Ma Poule Mouillée comes out winner with the same huge plates of fries, salad, and piri-piri chicken. The difference is one of consistency: I've always had tender juicy seasoned-just-right chicken over here while Romados can be a game of dry & over-salted roulette. Although my sample is a bit skewed with only a couple portuguese chicken meals at Ma Poule Mouillée compared to twice-a-week visits to Romados in my last life. I mean at $10 a plate who isn't tempted to go back again and again? Then there comes a point where you'll have had way too many portuguese chicken meals to want to eat that again. That's why I think grilled seafood at Ma Poule Mouillée is genius. The chicken-chouriço poutine has great flavour combinations and the large ($12) can legitimately feed two hungry wolves. If only the people who line up at La Banquise across the street knew...Small details like serving food on a real plate also add to the value (not that pilling a Styrofoam takeout box can't be an experience on its own - it just gets old and impractical fast). Not to mention Ma Poule Mouillée is trendier, cheaper than the average portuguese chicken restaurant and has outdoor seating during the summer. Tony Alves improved what is already great.Update 1 (2015-11-26):I had the steak plate today - not sure if it's a daily special or something on the regular menu. It was a modest piece (probably 6-8oz), cooked to a very nice medium-well over charcoal. However I wasn't a fan of the gravy which looked a lot of poutine sauce. Neither of the egg. Overall just salty and lacked spices. I would stick with the grilled calamari plate if your'e looking for a break from chicken."

So we rushed back to the restaurant for forks, knives, and napkins, got alllll the way back to our spot.... 15 minutes have elapsed since we've picked up our food... And we realize we have no ketchup or mayo for our fries. Never mind though, because the fries they gave us were old. I know from fries, alright? And these guys were made, never picked up, and thrown back in the dryer to heat up, making them both greasy and dry, and hard in spots. The chicken sandwich was similarly dry and very plain. The only redeeming item was the pork sandwich, succulent and oozing flavour. The salad was simple but good, but then dessert was a total flop. I ordered a regular natas and got a coconut one... My husband ordered a custard filled lobster tail and complained about dry pastry and a tail that was not fully filled. Super lame experience overall. I'm not saying I wouldn't go back, but I think they need to get it together. If you're going to offer take out, that ought to be as complete an experience as eating in the restaurant, and the onus can't be on the client to make sure you do your job right."

The strong impatience on her face and the embarrassment totally spoiled my appetite. I'm 100% sure I said ""please"" when asking. Didn't see that coming at all because it was not my first time here and all the other employees are friendly. Maybe I wasn't loud enough when asking, but I certainly do not deserve that especially after 1hr of lineup. The food is just great, but if you ever want to ask for some ketchup, be cautious of the cashier girl with facial hair."

Full respect to a certain other Portuguese rotisserie, down on the west end of Rachel-- but Ma Poule has their game on tight. Smoky charred chicken, glorious potatoes, tasty fries, sweet-sweet nata... By no means have the (super friendly) team here re-invented the wheel, they've just fine-tuned it, pumped it full of air and put some nice new rims on it.

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I never really understood how good rotisserie chicken was until I tried Romados. I grew up on St-Hubert chicken and the occasional Scores - Suburban life for the win - and there is a reason I stuck mostly to the chicken fingers through my teenage years. The classic chicken was generally too dry and not as flavourful as I wanted. Finally I moved downtown and then I discovered the beauty of Portuguese rotisserie. Moist and packed full of spicy flavour - finally proper chicken! Living close to Romados over the years gave me great opportunities to indulge when the craving hit. However, over the past couple of years, I've been hearing that another place in the plateau was given them a run for their money. That sounded impossible to me but given the co-owner of this new place worked at Romados for 20 years, it definitively peaked my interest. Last week, after a long Friday class nearby, I stopped over at Ma Poule Mouillee to give them shot.If you've been to Romados, you will recognize the set-up. Take-out counter - you wait in line, watch the chicken cook on the massive grill behind the counter and you pay at another counter where a bunch of Portuguese pastries are on display as well. It's simple but as a take-out/quick service option, it's works well. Decor-wise, that have certainly put more effort into creating a nicer sit-down space compared to Romados but frankly it's doesn't really matter in this context. The food is the key.For my first visit, I went with their ""Louis Cyr"" - 1/2 chicken with salad and fries. The classic combo. First off, huge portion for the price. I was surprised at just how much food I got for 11$ - a mountain of fries and a very sizeable half-chicken. The salad was classic side dish for Portuguese chicken and the fries were great as well - dense, tender and crispy - but let's be honest.... it's all about the chicken. I never thought I'd say this.... but I think they have Romados beat. The chicken was juicy and tender, super moist and so enjoyable. Add to that their spicy sauce slathered over the chicken and you have a heck of a chicken to enjoy.They do have a few other option including a ridiculous poutine that I couldn't justify ordering on top of the chicken. However, I did take the opportunity to order one of their chorizo sandwich to eat the next day. Beautifully smoky and spicy chorizo sliced in between a soft roll and covered with the same spicy sauce as the chicken, the sandwich was a great lunch the next day.And because they had some pastries, of course I needed a natas. Pretty good version to enjoy - the crust was thin and crackly with a nice torched top, the custard had that crème brûlée texture with a strong vanilla note. Always a good way to finish a meal.Ma Poule Mouillée has got this chicken thing down. If anyone you know says they don't like roasted chicken, simply bring them here and watch them realized the error of their ways. Portuguese chicken is a staple of the Plateau and is once again a reminder of the greatness of the diversity of Montreal. Now to find more reasons to visit the Plateau for lunch time....Cheers!"

We were 4 adults and 2 3-year-olds, had just spent the morning skating and sledding and working up an appetite, and were not going to wait for the kids to start crying in the cold. But, we'd already (foolishly) promised them poutine, so when we saw it on the menu of Ma Poule Mouillée, we knew we had a winner. We were afraid the place was a bit more upscale than we'd bargained for, because it looks somewhat swanky from the outside (and advertised being a ""rotisserie portugaise urbaine"") but in fact it was very comfortable and cozy inside.We settled into a table, and ordered a whole chicken, a Portuguese poutine, and a salad. In about 30 seconds, we had food in front of us. Piles and piles of amazing, delicious, steamy hot food. That alone is worth a lot.Like others have mentioned, the food didn't have as much kick or smoky rotisserie flavor as we'd expected, but for our purposes, with the kids in tow, it was perfect. My son devoured every piece of chorizo he could find in the poutine. A surprising, but delicious combination of chicken, chorizo, and the standard poutine fare of cheese curds, fries, and gravy. Our bill was $30. All the menu prices, which were reasonable to begin with, had the taxes included! We fed 6 people (ok, 2 were kids, but still!) for $30, and were all very, very satisfied. Thanks, La Banquise, for being over-hyped and over crowded. Glad we didn't end up there, and found Ma Poule Mouillée instead!"

So, my companion and I split the (#9?) the chicken breast plate. For $9 or $10CAD, we got a healthy portion of delicious chicken, a mound of rice, and a lunch-sized salad with some tasty dressing. We also got an order of the potato balls on top (they were my least favorite part of this meal, but I - in general - don't really care for potatoes, so you should try them). When plating our food, we were asked if we wanted ""spice"" and we agreed; this was a spicy sauce they dabbed on the chicken. I was expecting it to have a hot sauce sort of effect and I was nervous because there was so much of it, but it really isn't spicy. I think it enhanced the flavor for sure.We also got two natas and yummmmmmm they were good! The custard was super smooth and thick and the pastry cup was perfect (not dry at all).FYI - Everything is in French and I am not sure if they have an English menu. it's cafeteria style, so you order at the beginning of the counter and work your way down to the cashier."

The orange oil/spicy sauce soaked like one cm into the bread which was soft and flour dusted and just crisp enough on the crust to have good texture but not smoosh the chicken out. The chicken was chopped into manageable pieces and was simply good, probably not the best chicken ever but as a component in the sandwich was perfect. It's perfect to save for later, and the spice level is perfect, enough to feel spicy but it doesn't linger and burn and necessitate a drink."

The staff is great- both front and back of house.  The guys cooking the chicken were very friendly and patient with me.  My French is abysmal, and the cook communicated with me in fluent English.  The ladies in the back who handled the pastries and cashier area, however, did not.  It was all lost in translation, but it wasn't a problem since I guessed what was what.  I usually don't like ordering chicken in restaurants unless it's fried.  Most places tend to produce dry meat.  The Portuguese chicken here was anything but.  However, it was topped with a large heap of fries which were over-browned and soggy from the sauce.  Eating it all together took away from the moistness of the chicken.  If I had 4 friends to eat this with, it would probably receive higher marks.  I rate food based on whether I can AND want to finish the entire dish.  I simply couldn't."

I was at the dessert section just before the cash counter, thinking that my meal would arrive at the cash register. But no, I had to skip past two customers on my way back to the order counter to receive my meal, and then head on over to the cash register. They did have some desserts that looked appetizing. One of which we tried was what the counter woman jokingly said was a ""salami"". It tasted like cookie dough.

It's the charred, crispy chicken skin that always makes me smile from cheek to cheek.  For me, the first bite is always, undeniably, a religious renewal of my love for chicken- an often forgotten protein in the long line of other game meat served rare to medium rare. However, when chicken is done right, it's a real experience which I don't allow to slip my fat bellied memory, ever.As if waiting in a line to get in to the place wasn't enough proof for how amazingly delicious their food was going to be, I was welcomed by racks of chicken rotating over hot coals. Believe you me, I was beyond delighted at the spectacle of juicy chicken getting a hit of fire, smoke, and char.The menus at Ma Poule Mouillee were in French so luckily with my grade 5 French, I was able to not only read but also understand 85% of it. What I ordered was a no brainer- the chicken and chorizo combo (combo Veronique).Apart from the rotisserie chicken, Ma Poule Mouille also served homemade Portuguese backed desserts, like the infamous Portuguese tart. Several items to choose from, along with pickled and frozen items to complete your meal. Everything was presented nicely, conveniently and efficiently along an assembly line of ordering and paying. A definite smart setup for such a popular restaurant.Seating wasn't ample by any stretch, but both indoor and outdoor options are available. A combination of tall wooden tables, metal stools with shorter seating created more room overall. The light wooden floors, dark wood-paneled walls, open ducts and brick counters gave Ma Poule Mouillee a homestyle vibe.After pulling the chicken off the rack, a brush lathered the chicken in this amazingly tangy and spicy sauce before being chopped and plated. The chorizo was pulled out of the coals from below, hacked as well, followed by the most generous helping of fries placed on top. In total, the meal was $10 bucks, taxes in.The chicken was flavorful, spicy, with hints of natural bbq char. The skin was of course the best part, but the chorizo was equally tasty, lending its spices and bold flavoring to the bed of fries underneath. It was the perfect combination, really. I didn't miss the poutine so much after my first bite, but then again, I tried that too, grabbing a forkful off my buddies gigantic poutine tin ($12 and it was up there with anyother poutine you can get in MTL).Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better meal to send me off back home to Toronto. Montreal left a mark in my heart and belly from its intensely elaborate yet comforting food scene. I miss Montreal, leftovers made me cry."

We were torn between this place and the location across the street which is known for its poutine. When we arrived we saw the huge line across the street so we decided to instead check out ma poule mouillee. We literally made the best decision ever !!! The poutine was beyond killer delicious (get the small it's huge and plenty for two people). We also got a half chicken plate with rice and a salad and their hot sauce which again was delicious. The line moved quick and we got a seat and could not believe how delicious all the food was.  Juicy roasted chicken and fresh salad on one side and crispy french fries topped with pulled chicken and spiced chorizo with fresh cheese smothered in gravy and hot sauce. We literally could not have been happier. Btw the line across the street hadn't moved at all since we sat down to eat. #winning . Go here, end of story :)"

My friend had been raving about Ma Poule Mouillée for weeks and in particular he had lauded the restaurant's poutine suggesting that it is much better than that of La Banquise; naturally I needed to try it! Since we came for the poutine, I thought that a meal made entirely of poutine might seem a little less decadent with a side salad. The combination of a poutine and a salad was very nice. Indeed, the poutine is a must! DELICIOUS! NOTHING is small here! The side salad was huge ($3), the ''petite'' poutine was huge ($8)! Prices include tax and so for only $11 exactly I ate like a queen. The next time that my family is in town, I will definitely bring them here for the poutine and the chicken."

I had the pork shoulder sandwich with fries and loved every bite! The spicy sauce was so good that I bought some to bring home."

I'm a fan of spicy foods and was a bit disappointed to find that their hot sauce had no kick at all. The chicken was lacking the smoky flavour of some of the better rotisserie portugaise places in Montreal. But it was pretty good, a solid three stars. To give you an idea of serving size, we went skating after lunch and even then, six hours later, we aren't all that interested in having supper.They've obviously put some thought itno the ambiance with a brick wall counter, wood trim, and bright red, black and white colours. Menu items have playful names. The staff was friendly. The bathroom was clean."

Even though we were vacationing in Montreal, I was going to pass on the whole poutine scene as it sounds pretty heavy and gross if I am being honest. As we were enjoying the park and worked up a good appetite, we found this place on Yelp and man am I glad. Great service and fantastic food. As you walk in you see the chicken roasting over coals and the people preparing the food busily chopping and serving the meals. My wife had a half chicken and salad while I had the all out poutine with chicken and some smoked meat added. We took the food to go, planning to eat in the park nearby. With cold sodas in hand, we found a bench and just dug into one of the best meals I had in Montreal if not THE best. I was very wrong about poutine. The cheese curds and gravy made a great base for the chicken which was perfectly juicy and smokey in flavor. Everything was baller here. If I went back I would ask for the spicy option. I get a bit worried ordering spicy at a place I don't know as too much spice can overpower a meal and ruin the experience, but here I think spicy is referring to the Portuguese flavoring they add which is delicious. If you are in the area, don't you dare overlook it! We ran into other people during our visit, and some locals were like, ""Oh yeah, they are the best poutine in the city."""

Two sandwiches, pork and chicken, with side salads and repas, and two drinks came to just over $20, a terrific value anywhere, but unbelievable given the quality and flavor here. The chicken sandwich is the winner, although the pork was delicious, too. The chicken is perfectly seasoned and chopped. It goes down almost too easily. The repas were new to us and a nice change from fries. The side portions were so generous that we could not finish them. I would've sprinkled a but more salt on before we left the shop for the park, but they were otherwise delicious."

/user_details?userid=bj2_KPCKpQdNlN8hlHSxdg,Cat D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Solid place for Portuguese chicken. I much prefer it to Romados for a variety of reasons: the interior is cuter and has more seating, the prices include tax and last time I compared it with Romados, I think Ma Poule came out slightly cheaper (not sure if it's still the case, since I noticed a few weeks ago that some items at Ma Poule increased in price by a dollar or so), and most importantly, Ma Poule has juicier chicken which does better the next day. I always found Romados to be very dry and not enjoyable the following day. I also like how Poule packs the side salad in its own box to save you from having drenched and soggy fries if you do take out. I used to hate taking Romados home, because the fries would be covered in dressing, and the chicken was usually packed rather carelessly. I also think Poule has slightly better fries, although they're still not what I call great (but you come here for spicy chicken!). I also want to note that I generally do not like poutine and avoid it everywhere else, but once I tried it here, I was hooked. It's definitely a great combo of spicy chicken, salty chorizo and salty sauce with decently fresh cheese curd. I would definitely pick this poutine over any other at La Banquise which is across the street. The small poutine can feed two easily and I don't suggest the large unless you have a massively massive appetite. Overall, a great place for a cheap, filling and happy meal!"

The poutine was top notch, covered with chicken and chorizo in addition to the classic cheese curds and gravy.  Petit poutine was already enormous so portion sizes here are really generous.

That was way too much for su to finish even though we were so hungry! So  in terms of the portion i have nothing to say. Grilled chickens were good and had a flavor, but were little dry, I think maybe because they were on oven, it rolling on the stove for long time after they're finished. Poutine, everyone seems to love it including my friends going there but I didn't really get why people were raving so much about it... well this is not bad whatsoever, but the gravy sauce, I really didn't love it, was little too salty and a luck of aroma (?) I guess, and I honestly don't have much experience of tasting Poutine in my life ( this was my 2nd time) but I just thought that the chicken on it was really dry and the cheese should have been more melted to feel that's tasty..?, because cheese on it was really raw and cold. I Don't know, maybe that's normal and that's the cheese on Poutine should be but still, I think it'd be lot tastier if the cheese is melted on it. Salad was good, I liked the dressing on it. Overall, well as a not-crazy-Poutine-lover, I really don't think i'm coming back."

/user_details?userid=7hElQBiE_x2HZk6yJMVgNg,Lu Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"great atmophere, easy to read menu, the crispinest of the chicken is perfectly balanced with the creamy and perfectly spiced sauce. I ordered the half chicken with salad and patatoes, the portion is huge really should specify to reduce the amount of fries next time it is such food waste, just watching people eat i don't anyone who finished the fries. The salad dressing was way too oily( common to all portoguese chicken spot). We also had the poutine with choriso and chicken, the chorizo is nothing special too salty i had one bite of a mix of chicken, gravy, chorizo and fries and it was enough. I am gluten intolerant and the cashier said there's absolutely no gluten anywhere when obviously there was in the gravy and the spicy sauce so i was sick for the night. The last but not the least: Mille feuille was a party in my mouth, not too sweet, a generous double layer of custard, not too much dough and the chocolate glazing adds the perfect amount of creaminest to it. Comparable to the Mille feuille from Moishes, which is the best one i had so far. Will be back for the chicken and mille feuille. Cheers."

First time in Montreal and had lots of recommendations for this place, did not disappoint at all! I ordered both the 1/2 chicken (#2 on the menu) and the large poutine (#8). While the chicken was as good as everyone here said, the poutine takes the cake. For one the serving portion is absolutely huge so it's easily splittable between 2-3 people; and two, it's toppled with chicken and chorizo which makes it super tasty. Well-priced too at around $12 for the large poutine. Only caution is this is a well-known gem and so seems pretty packed regularly."

The flavours are fantastic (their spicy sauce on the chicken is to die for), the portions are massive, but I have one (big) gripe that leads to my lower-star rating. On two occasions now, I've managed to get splinters of chicken bone lodged into the back of my throat. I'm not talking big bones from lazy chewing, I mean tiny little splinters. Those tiny little shards that you can't even feel when you are chewing. This makes it hurt to swallow for two days after. I know I know - you are probably thinking: slow down, don't inhale your food dude. Trust me, I tried this. It was clearly ineffective. Their brutalist chicken smashing knife skills can result in tiny bone shards peppered throughout the chicken. Unless they change their practices, my advice is: enjoy the heck out of that delicious chicken... but proceed with caution."

When I first moved to Montreal, and ate at Romado's, I was blown away at how tasty their chicken and fries were. But I hate to say that they have dropped to second place in my heart. Romado's is still good, don't get me wrong, but Ma Poule Mouillée just takes every thing to a whole new level. It's overall such a satisfying, tasty, happy experience. My go-to dishes is the Poutine which comes with their chicken and chopped chorizo sausages, ask for the ""hot sauce"" on top but don't worry, it's not spicey, it just adds another layer of flavour. My second go-to dish is the half-chicken with fries and salad which is equally, if not more tasty and satisfying. What's a shame about my visits here is that the portions are so big, I usually see a couple of people throw away a half eaten plate - please, take it to go for home or give it to a homeless person on the street. The food is too tasty, it hurts my heart every time I see that happen. If you tend to have a small appetite, share an entree. Every time I have friends come into town, this is the first place i take them and not one of them have been disappointed. The folks that work here have always had a neutral vibe. They aren't greeting you with a massive smile, but they aren't impolite either, it's very straight forward."
