/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My girlfriend and I came here for dinner. They open at 5 pm. We reserved online. We each had three courses. I had sashimi combo, Kushi combo and Zuke don with marinated sashimi, My friend had seared buri, seared scallops and shrimp udon. We shared our food. I like the udon, Kushi combo and buri carpaccio the best. Other dishes were good but I think the don was lack of sauce. The deco was pretty nice. The series was wonderful. They have daily specials. Thanks to MTL à table. We enjoyed a discounted set. I would say even regular price was reasonable and with big portion.  I would be full if I eat only a fried udon."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"3 stars for the food, 5 stars for the service. To be honest, for a place that is supposingly specialized in kushi katsu, they were pretty disappointing. Half of the kushi katsu weren't available yet, so we decided to try all the ones that they had today (shrimp, scallop, chicken, squid, asparagus, avocado, eggplant, mushroom and fish cake with cheese). The batter on the outside was thin and not too oily, but was pretty bland and not as crispy as I thought, unlike the ones in japan. It came with a side of cabbage slices and a sauce that was sweet and sour. It complimented the skewers well, but the sauce is pretty much the only flavor you can taste. The skewers were 1 to 4.50$ each. The yellow tail carpaccio and the salmon tartare were fresh, delicious and flavorful. The tartare came with 5 extremely thin slices of chips that couldn't hold more than 4-5 little chunks of salmon without breaking. Would have been better if there were more chips or if the slices were thicker. We ended the meal with a bowl of sashimi and rice. The sashimi were pretty good and soft, like the appetizers. However, they didn't seem to use sushi rice. The rice was a bit hard and not sticky, just like regular jasmine rice so the combination with the sashimi was a bit odd. As for the service, it was great. We got recommandations from the staff and they gave us bowls to share our rice. They were friendly and nice. The food came pretty quickly. For their soft opening, they offered us a discount of 15% as well as free sake bomb or beer. Since I didn't want to drink alcohol today, they offered me a yuzu soda instead which tasted great. The place is very special on the inside. It has a good atmosphere and cute decorations on the wall, such as totoro or no face. My only issue is that they have no AC, which can be a problem on a hot summer day. The restaurant isn't very big, but it has a second floor with more tables. Overall, it was a good experience. However, the food wasn't impressive enough to make us come back."

After getting inside, I was non stop admiring the place. It's so funky and cool looking restaurant. The service is top notch. Our host/ waitress was very efficient and amiable and also helpful. As for the menu, we went with MTL à la Table menu. There are three services. First service was cold dishes . I had Buri (Japanese tuna) carpaccio (delicious), and my sister had gyu (beef) tataki which she said it was okay. For second service, we had warm dishes, I had kushi kotsu; bunch of skewers of fried asparagus, shrimp, avocado, zucchini, eggplant, calamari, and cheese (personally, my least favorite because it was to oily for me). My sister had kara age chicken, which she enjoyed very much. For the third service, we had the main dish. My sister really loved her ebi gaki (shrimp) udon and my unagi (BBQ eel) don was ok; it was slightly bitter and flavorless, so I had to ask for hot sauce. Overall it was a fun experience."
/user_details?userid=JXfUPmN87P2TEpM3utgdqg,Andrew K.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"Not the best izakaya I've had in Montreal but a decent place with pretty reasonable portions/prices. The hot sake was fairly decent, a moderately built sake menu. Was annoyed that the place has no diet sodas but it's a first world problem. We ordered a large amount of everything with tartare, tataki combo, buri carpaccio, edamame, Kara-age, yakitori negima, gyu kushiyaki, kushiyaki combo. Definitely of these the Kara-age and the yakitori negima were the more stand out dishes. I would skip the buri carpaccio and the tataki combo."
/user_details?userid=g1MPo8zaOKLo9QazpThPJQ,Wei T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I like this Japanese style bar.  Came here on a Friday night with colleagues without reservation. Luckily we got a table. We ordered 5 bottles of large sake.  We like the sashimi combo. And we ordered about 6 times. The deep fried food are less favorable. In sum it's a nice place to go after work.
/user_details?userid=GnJ2w63izmrICmt1wNCGOA,Laurence V.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"What a young, fun and energetic restaurant! There's the vibe of a typical Japanese pub with the wooden walls, tables and chairs, and the small tight space, but the yellow grids and the colourful paintings on the walls makes this place so unique! I wanted to come here because I had recently gone to Osaka and had kushikatsu there, so I was really excited that I could have it here in Montreal. We got takowasa (octopus wasabi salad, average but I love it in general), syake-wasa (salmon tartare, tasteful but nothing out of the ordinary) and the kushikatsu combo which came with 10 skewers. My favourite skewers were the chikuwa chiizu (fish cake with cheese) and the chiizu (cheese) and the others were good too, so I suggest getting a combo so you can try all of them. However, I must be honest and say that it's not the same as in Japan. The sauce wasn't as good, the concept wasn't the same (there was no communal sauce to share and scoop with lettuce, although I understand it's probably for health reasons) and the frying was different too. Overall, I'm giving a solid 4 stars. I know I need to try other dishes (there's a lot I didn't try). We were also 2 people, so a larger group would be more fitting for the vibe and also allow you to try more food. They also have daily promotions during the week so definitely look out for those!"

We decided to order as many things as possible to try as much as we could.The concept is great, and the decor really added to the ambience. However, there were some faults that we encountered during our visit which made me believe that they need more time to work out all the kinks.The service was kind, but somewhat spotty. A dish was forgotten that should have come out first, before the skewers....in fact we had to ask for it so it came out and the end of the items we ordered. While not down to the server, they should be checking the tickets. Second, we were brought the wrong dish at one point, and getting the right one took an additional 15 minutes. Third, they have one bathroom. And this is a pet peeve of mine, if you have a single bathroom it should be spotless and in perfect working order. It wasn't. So now that you've read all that, let's get down to the food. We started with the sashimi combination which was about 12 pieces and tasted very fresh. We also had the tartare of the day (which was the dish that came last). It was good, basic, but refreshing after the cooked food. My favorite appetizer was, to my astonishment, the cold soft tofu with a wonton chip you crack into it. The balance of flavors was perfect for me. Then we also got the fried chicken, which was very good, especially with the seasoned mayo dip. Of the many dishes we ordered, surprisingly the fried kushikatsu skewers were the least favorite. We got the combination plate so we could try all of them and none of them wowed. The best were the fried cheese and the shrimp. They weren't bad, just underwhelming. I preferred the kushiyaki, which were the grilled skewers. Again we got the combination, and I enjoyed the seasoning/smokiness of them. My boyfriend loved the asparagus wrapped in pork belly so much that I will have to try this at home one day. We also got the Mini Abokado which was a tempura avocado with rice, soft-boiled egg, and lip-smackingly good sauce. Another great dish, we all gobbled it up using little spoons.I'm giving this restaurant a 3.5/5 because of the issues we experienced. Will I be back? Not in the immediate future but yes, this is still a relatively new place and I'm sure that given a few more months to settle in they will find their stride."

We ordered a table d'hote type of menu that allowed us to sample a large portion of the menu but none of the items were particularly delicious unfortunately. Nothing was necessarily bad but nothing great either. The decor was really fun/funky, the service was spotty on a Tuesday evening, and the prices were ok. Wouldn't really come back as much as I wanted to want to...."

Here are some menu photos. Matcha cheesecake for dessert was so good.Nothing special about the drafts. I'm from Vermont and the beer is better haha. But I'm sure the mixed drinks and cocktails here are great!"

Also the staff are so friendly and always smiling. If you ever take the tofu, you will have to break the bread on top of the plate, the waiter will ask you to repeat after her.... ""yaku.... bomb"" (i think it was the right words lol :p) and then u break it with your mini spoon. I will come back for sure! By the way the drinks are so good!"
/user_details?userid=8p4JGNgZl705fByqyF6BrQ,Monyka T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The strongest thing this joint has going for itself is the decorations. It's a fun vibrant atmosphere maintained by a young crew in its colourful scheme. The quality of the food is standard but the recipes/dishes tasty. I would be willing to pay more for these dishes if the quality increased but, I think their target clientele is young folks so that's unlikely to happen. I'm glad I tired this place because it made for a fun evening but unsure I would return."
