/user_details?userid=3SfiqyTQO8gP8z6XA1ekpQ,Garseng W.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"A casual arepa place on St. Laurent. The restaurant itself was pretty basic, perhaps a little dimly lit. There was a patio in the back where we enjoyed our meal. The service was friendly enough, but not note-worthy; you order at the counter and they bring the food to you, but otherwise don't really attend to you which is fine. They have a wide variety of different ""sandwichs"" that appeared to be larger portions on a maize bun, and arepas that are a little smaller than the sandwiches, among other food items. We tried:1. Pabellón - beef, beans, and white Venezuelan cheese. A nice balance of sweet, savory, creamy, and meaty; our favorite part of the meal!2. Rumbera - pork and cheddar cheese. The pork was good, but they really loaded the cheddar cheese in this arepa; I think the ratio was a little bit off. 3. Tequeño - a little finger-long fried stick with filling. We got the white Venezuelan cheese. A little crispy, not very large; it was okay. We got this because they didn't have empanadas.Some downsides were that you have to buy bottled water, and that the food took a little longer than expected to come out considering the simplicity of the food. Also, they didn't have any empanadas when we came. Overall, 5 stars for the food; we would come back to try different sandwiches!--Rating Rubric--5* - As good as it gets; some or all of the experience went above and beyond. I would come here again and again!4* - Worth checking out; a good value. No major complaints or only minor flaws that set this place back. I'm glad I tried it, but I might not come back here in lieu of trying somewhere new.3* - A few setbacks that soured the experience. Not the worst, but I wouldn't recommend it to friends.2* - Multiple setbacks that made me dislike the place.1* - I was personally offended by the people or services. Steer clear!"

There's lots of seating inside and a great little terrace outside, where my friend and I sat. We shared three appetizers: arepitas, empanaditas, and patacones. For the arepitas we chose beef and pork. As for the empanaditas we got two chicken and two fish. All were really delicious and it was enough for the both of us. Service was also great! I just thought it was a little pricey compared to other Venezuelan places."

Yaaaaaassss, w that extra queso por favor   I asked for a side of plantain, and just how I like it- sweet and tangy! Portions are good, hard to take a full bite without everything slopping over. Delicious, can't wait to try their multiple flavour combos"
/user_details?userid=J8Plwv1tfrTRasXfzm4Pcw,Zach P.,"New Britain, CT",4 star rating,"Authentic Venezuelan style Arepas. I thought the food was great, exactly as expected. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. You order at the entrance, and then the staff brings the food out to you when ready. My friend and I loved the arepas. I ordered a side of plantains, and they weren't bad. The meat was perfectly seasoned, and the avocado was nice and fresh. Note, if you don't like greasy food, this probably isn't the place for you. But if you want authentic Venezuelan food this is as close as you'll get in Montreal. I would have given them a 5-star rating but I thought the restaurant could have been a little bit more clean. A lot of the tables were messy and it took the server a while to pick up plates. There were 4 employees working so I'm sure someone had time to do so."
/user_details?userid=j0tcQwuG9byNUAmPS2bqNQ,Nicole D.,"Oceanside, CA",5 star rating,***EAT HERE***We had the beef empanada which was so tasty!  We also had the Reina Pepiada -chicken arepa and the Pabellon - beef arepa. The beef had friend plantains and succulent beef with black beans and white cheese. The beef was obviously marinated and super flavorful. The chicken one was good but a bit average in comparison. Both came topped with avocado. The arepa dough was so good and the perfect mix between moist and a crunchy texture. One  arepa is big enough to fill you up! Their salsa is so good and has a great vinegar taste. Perfect for topping the arepas. We also had fresh made passion fruit drinks that were so fresh and tangy! The online menu states that have alcoholic beverages but when we were there they said they don't have their license to sell wine or beer. This place is a must visit if you are in the area and even if you are not!
/user_details?userid=o_IEnOVNuir0QNVkANzyXQ,Esteban Y.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a good restaurant to try several Venezuelan Dishes (but I must confess they don't have the best arepas and cachapas in town), but it is still very good and their menu is extent, so it is good to try a little bit of everything. I had the patacones, which were good, but were presented in a different way as it is usually done in Venezuela (It's like they give the ingredients and you build it yourself, but normally it should be served already built). I also had a cachapa, it was quite good. That night they had live latin music and that was awesome. On the negative side, the service was very bad, it was clear that they did not have experience serving, they took too much time to take the orders, kept forgetting things (we were a table of 12), but they always had a big warmth smile and tried to correct themselves as they could. I hope the service can improve."
/user_details?userid=JMP9JY5JV2HfWn8ClTBb6A,Matthew T.,"Bradenton, FL",3 star rating,"Seems so promising, but when you get another table's order and then when yours finally arrives it is a bit odd ends up being 3 stars.  Cool patio in the back.  I did like the empanada that I finally got.  FYI, it isn't the peruvian pastry style empanada but the dough is corn based.  Very yummy.  I'm not 100% yelp has this place in the right location, but the place we went had this name on the front!  Need to give it another try, but since I was in town just for vacation that will have to wait until the next visit."
/user_details?userid=2UkZKQBZVuroUBKYs9WzeQ,Linda V.,"Jacksonville, FL",5 star rating,Quaint area of Montreal with lots of famous eateries like Bocadillo! We read we had to try an arepas during our eating tour of the city! So glad we did! We ordered a cheese arepas with avocado and it was huge! We were going to split it anyway (since we had more places to eat from..lol) and it was plenty! We had a 10 minute wait because they make it fresh and it was worth the wait. Lots of cheese and avocado with a little cup of some type of sauce (which it did not need) but was so tasty! Not sure the type of cheese either but it reminded me of cheese curds (from our poultine experience)...
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The Bocadillo restaurant is shaped like a typical Montreal apartment: narrow and elongated, stretching from the street to a funky backyard. Don't get fooled by their rather small and unassuming shop front; they have excellent Venezuelan comfort food!We had dinner in their backyard this summer and loved it. We ordered arepas (pork & passion fruit and Reina Pepiada). The food took some time to arrive, even though we were the only clients in the restaurant. The waiter did apologize and explained that the arepas are fresh made with every order. We didn't mind too much - the backyard was nice and private, and the weather balmy.When it came, the food looked fantastic. The mix of chicken, avocadoes, green peas, mayo and coriander in the Reina Pepiada was particularly delicious. The arepas were filled to the maximum and although we didn't order sides, we were full and satisfied!"
/user_details?userid=05AH2UJKDAxTcJVOy3XPIg,Mohamed A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Two locations,  this is their  ""take away""/""fast food"" style branch compared to the ""bistro"" in little Italy.  Solid arepas, all the classics options available(pabellon, pernil, cheese and guacamole, extra). Service is a bit too functional , the dinging hall is small and stencil  is not shining..... But still, this is the ""fast food"" branch. So i won't complain as long as the food is good."
/user_details?userid=8BsPrR_Dkgy1pGZeRwzrqw,Myrtille J.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"I have to say this was one of the best restaurants I've been to in Montréal. Definitely not what I expected when I went there. I was drooling when I left the place just by the thought of what I'd experienced taste-wise. The mashed steak, arepitas, and black beans had left me almost numb, it was my first time trying portuguese food, and they did their cuisine absolute justice. It tasted like African food, but with a small touch of some exotic flavours I couldn't tell, it was well cooked, and served neatly. The tiramisu was not bad, but not as breathtaking as the main dish. The place is located in Little Italy, and is easily accessible by bus. Or you can ride there."
/user_details?userid=5MUxvf75UwcBm3opJnljHQ,Karim H.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"Bocadillo is a Venezualan establishment that is unassuming from the outside, but serves some of the best arepas I've ever had - if not THE best. Their menu is extensive, with everything customaizable. The staff are phenomenal at explaining everything. Not much in the way of seating space or atmosphere, but certainly still comfortable sitting down to eat. I ordered the beef arepas with cotija and avocado - came out to $12. The sandwich was fresh, beef was delicious and juicy, a great combination of spices balanced by the cotija and avocado - it was perfect. My only quip was that it was 12 dollars. To be fair, it was stuffed with beef, but it still seemed a little hefty for a sandwich and no side. I thoroughly enjoyed it, regardless, and will definitely be back!"
/user_details?userid=eOFsQTbuaNjRHNzCJrXWgA,Nilma M.,"New Haven, CT",2 star rating,"Visiting from out of country. Had read amazing reviews so decided to come here on a rainy Sunday for lunch. Everything was going wrong the min we walked in. 1) No English menus available so we were using google translate on our phones to translate our menu. Finally, the nice server came up to us and helped us with the menu.2) Lunch menu not available as it was 12:26pm (apparently they open lunch menu around 12:30 or 1). But she was accommodating & said we can pick from there. 3) Husband wanted chicken empanada or arepa. Chicken arepa had mayonnaise mixed in it (he's allergic to mayo)...so the arepa was a no for him. He ended up ordering the chicken empanada appetizer.4) Came back & told us no chicken empanadas was available. He ended up having to get cheese empanada (we don't eat pork or beef). Apparently they had a party last night so most things were out...hmm. That shows that they are not prepared!! 5) Cheese empanadas were salty as hell. He has high blood pressure so that was great (not). 6) My order was good. I ordered a veggie/bean/avocado empanada with plantain and I was happy with it. 7) We were asked to move tables half way through as apparently our table/area was reserved for another party. Wish we had a better experience here :("

The meat tasted very good,but the cheese that they put inside could be better in terms of taste and quality!But overall I suggest here to anyone who wants to taste the Venezuelan arepas in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=xgj_0ik_timOqpkwtBsANQ,Derek L.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,So good after eating subpar food for the last two days here in Montreal. What an unexpected surprise
/user_details?userid=JE75cXSQ7iWcMZzedRnmaQ,Sabrina F.,"Spring Valley, NY",5 star rating,Had the best arepa of my life! So worth coming here. The menu has so many options so you are bound to find something you like. The cheese empanadas were also crazy good & perfect with some coffee. The outdoor seating has a vibe like you are sitting in your back yard. Super lit.

The counter-server guy was really nice and made helpful suggestions.The arepa sandwich I got was out-of-this-world delicious.My only regret was not going sooner. I hope these guys don't change, they seem to have a really good thing going on."
/user_details?userid=2Y9ShlnQkXC9fv_ZuasM2Q,Cris C.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Nice Venezuelan food not sure if they allowed my little dog ? Montreal need to start changing for better and allowed our best friends ! What do you think ?
/user_details?userid=FNSUuB0wcQXfnO3ioGWPsQ,Julia C.,"Dollard-Des Ormeaux, Canada",5 star rating,Amazing food! Ordered the pabellón arepa and couldn't get enough of how delicious it was. The fried yuca was perfectly crisp and the dipping sauce was perfectly seasoned. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to eat delicious food with amazing flavours. Can't wait to go back!
/user_details?userid=BmJr0mesbhtG5E2nIwvecQ,Lara S.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Found this place accidentally. Not looking for arepas, but boy did we luck out! I had plantain, cheese and avocado with a side of yucca chips. The buns were made out of corn flour and super fresh. The guys were friendly and the music was good too. Highly recommend it!"
/user_details?userid=nuRWMnTID899p1Vh4WIKig,Joanna F.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5 star rating,"This little Venezuelan beauty in the heart of little Italy is a must! People stop and stare because it is out of the ordinary. The arepas are perfect. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, and that's short of the blend of flavors. Don't leave without trying their cachapas. Their service is impeccable."

/user_details?userid=YxEsJxOVruu1ECeNwFSJeA,Chrisstina S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Love, love , love! Nothing bad to say about Bocadillos. It's open late, it's consistent, it's flavourful, it's not too expensive, and the staff is so friendly. I'm so happy I'm moving near this restaurant, I'm gunna be there all summer long! It always tastes fresh. And the cachapas are to die for (and that avocado sauce)."
/user_details?userid=KNRwbAKYzHXjaWGQJc_pTg,Jimmy L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"One of the best places to eat late at night on St-Laurent. This place beats any other fast food joints. Doesn't look that appealing, but this place is like a white dude with dance moves - full of surprises."
/user_details?userid=mrlKJNsy8CkPYAfHW3m5Cw,Lisa C.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"This place was really cute. My friends and I wanted to try it out, first time we stopped by it was closed...we didn't give up and came back hoping a second time and it was open!We got the Mechada and Pabellon Arepas...they were delicious! Really hot, we almost burnt our mouths from the juiciness that came with each bite:-D The service and atmosphere was nice too, really causal and chill. Highly recommend!"
/user_details?userid=F9ivL7-mzKbfnLO1rKUFFQ,Vanessa Z.,"Chambly, Canada",5 star rating,"I truly can't believe how this place doesn't have more hype on Yelp. It's packed and everyone seems to love it! I've been 2 times and both times it was out of this world. Highlights include the cheese and chorizo tequenos, the cheese and black bean empanadas and the pulled beef arepera. If you're ever on St-Laurent street and feeling some good Latino food or vegetarian/vegan friendly food, this is the place to go."
/user_details?userid=xva4w2TD1YjAzjxw4qjdRQ,Amelia S.,"Calgary, Canada",4 star rating,"So far, this is my favorite Venezuelan restaurant in Montreal. I ordered and arepa and my companion ordered the mechada; both were delightful. I had the house spicy sauce along with plantains and avocado on my sandwich, which made it oh so very good. I need to go back soon, or else I might go crazy. Also the guy working Ramon was really hospitable. His coworker and him we're both trying to help us figure out the best part of town to move, since we were newcomers. It's joints like this that make me love this city."
/user_details?userid=AdLsFr2cRCm3Dp2Z6FAqaQ,Audrey B.,"Levis, Canada",4 star rating,"Venezuelan gem. I usually order for take out since I live closeby. Arepas are always fresh made, with good meat and fillers. Arepa pabellón with avocado is my personal favorite. The only downside is the unpredictable closing hours: they will close whenever the place empties up, so better call before heading there."
/user_details?userid=AQCSP9f-54SsRUc4P9InzA,Kayla L.,"Central Falls, RI",5 star rating,First time here as a Latina I can accurately say that this place is amazing. I had one arepa and it was more than enough! Completely delicious! The staff is super sweet and wonderful! Will be back soon!

Everyone there is very nice, but not attentive. When ordering take out there are often many mistakes made.The portions are off as well, the yucca is expensive and you get maybe 6-8 pieces.If you really want to experience great Venezuelan food, go to their original location, that's where the heart and soul is."

/user_details?userid=rWt9DnbMr3rAOUmtRwLtbA,Mary G.,"Salisbury, MD",5 star rating,"Best place in Canada for Venezuelan food, everything is very well prepared so you may think that you are eating at any arepera in Venezuela."
/user_details?userid=MqMbtvAn5SflxrcJnEoj0w,Leonardo L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great place to try Venezuelan food but they also have other dishes as well, I highly recommend their pizzas and their sangria, I would say the best in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=6FVyEXZlkJcuheqPYod-hg,S I.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,This is probably my favorite restaurant in Montreal. True Venezuelan cuisine and great customer service. I'm celiac and they have plenty of gluten-free options and this is one of the few places that I've never had a problem with. I recommend the arepas and the corn tequeños.
