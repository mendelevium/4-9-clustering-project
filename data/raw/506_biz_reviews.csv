/user_details?userid=Iu5mS8o02-RGpjJdxI0v7w,Harry K.,"Laval, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been here twice before but only for pupusas and tamales. But since today was one of them nasty, sad winter days, their famous beef soup or as they call it, sopa de mondongo was a no brainer choice. I've heard some of the Salvadorians at work rave about it several times, so It stayed on my to-do list for some time until today. My usual pork cheese, chicken cheese pupusas were just right. You'll notice that they are little drier here compared to La Carreta's a few blocks away. That's only because they use less oil which is a nice thing to do for a gordito like myself having a hard time keeping a leash on his belly size. Although less oily, taste was still decent. Pour that tomato sauce, the green hot sauce then top them off with curtido and bon appétit. As for the soup, boy.... for $10 plus tax, you get your money's worth. Portion was big, full of veggies, tripe, cartilage attached to bones for you to clean them off like dogs do and which I did. Woof! Yes yes, most likely would stop reading up to here but for anyone into this kind of soup, it's a very good, hearty, filling soup. I didn't think it would be that satisfying and plenty so ordered two pupusas to chow down just in case tomorrow is apocalypse. You never know right? I might as well go happy :) In general, a really good authentic mom and pop Salvadorian clean restaurant. Pleasant Latino vibe and nice music playing in the background while you're enjoying your food thinking or wishing rather you're somewhere warmer than here. Why 4 stars? Well, the tripe wasn't edible, too chewy and rubbery but apparently as per the waitress, that's the way it is. Some apparently are able to eat it. Hmmm. To me it was a total waste sadly. Had they been cooked for longer, they would've been edible. I weeped a little inside when put them aside for trash. Another factor is that they take cash only or you can withdraw cash from an ATM in the resto. I'd definitely go back when the urge for Salvadorian food arises again. I didn't take pictures of their entire menu but can tell you it's extensive and full of interesting choices which I surely will try. You should too."

Their dishes are generous in terms of portions.The menu is extensive and very interesting.  I'm coming here soon again to try more stuff. Cash only! Though they have an ATM machine.

/user_details?userid=mY3NA8f6H0-i38SOjxyhFg,Dan P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Nice Latin restaurant in this area I've been told it's been open for over 20 years . I stopped in for lunch takeout and quite surprised to see the place a little busy. After havering there meal I understand why. The quality was good and the portions were fare. At fist I thought the entrance was on the side because of the Terrasses but it's actually on Belanger. The service was warm and welcoming, she even gave me a drink (not water) which I found very welcoming. Didn't even ask for it while waiting. It was quite sweet. The decor is defiantly not why u come in for.. but don't be fooled the food is quite good.I had the beaf soup. The meat was a little tough but packed with vegetables.. I can easily say if tastes home made. It's defiantly filling and packed with simple flavours. The beaf tacos were also very good and generous portion. Watch out for the home made Green hot Sauce ... it I mention it was a HOT sauce !! The beaf was also a little tough but it was a mouth full.. not even 10 of those mini tacos u get 4for 5.00 can compare to the quantity or quality of these.  I'm very excited to go back when the Terrasses opens up (2 weeks!) they do sell Alcohol ! But one last point ... bring cash.. although there is an ATM machine inside, there is a 2.25 service charge. So it can hurt if ur ordering a 15.00 meal plus and and tip .."
