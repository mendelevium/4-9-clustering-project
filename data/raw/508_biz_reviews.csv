/user_details?userid=U7RCnO4Y_SbuKLsFvwTIww,Jennifer A.,"Lincoln Park, NJ",3 star rating,"Our experience here was just ok, mediocre, middle of the road, you get the point. The vibe is a little weird, its definitely more of a casual spot, which we did not know. We did not prefer the atmosphere, it wasn't the best for a date night but oh well. As far as food is concerned, I feel very 50/50 about it. For an appetizer we had the mussels in white wine sauce....the mussels themselves were cooked nicely and were not tough. However, the broth was tasteless and unfortunately left us feeling disappointed. There was no flavor of wine, lemon or any seasoning, it just tasted like plain broth. Too bad, because the mussels were good stand alone and it would've been nice to dunk our bread. Bummer.For entrees, we both went with pasta dishes. My dish was linguine, shrimp in a white wine sauce with seasonings and capers. This dish had great flavor and the pasta was cooked well. The shrimp were also cooked nicely but sadly they were just pieces of shrimp, not whole shrimps. For the price tag of this pasta dish, you would expect to receive actual shrimp, not cut up pieces. My husband enjoyed his seafood pasta dish, which came with plentiful amounts of seafood and a vast assortment as well, which made us feel better about the price.Besides the wishy-washy food, the service was also pretty bad and terribly slow. If I come back to Montreal, I would not be coming back here. There are SO many restaurants to check out, I don't think this one is worth it, especially if you're not in town for long."
/user_details?userid=MnYfi2DODiZkLIwJFuwB2g,Bill Z.,"Hyde Park, NY",4 star rating,"This is a delightful restaurant to visit for well prepared and reasonably priced food and drink. Your seafood options are extensive both in terms of variety of seafood and styles of preparation. Drinks include a full wine list and a variety of cocktails, of which our party had both types. Service was great, and the atmosphere was kicked up a notch by upbeat smooth jazz music.While white wine was plentiful at our table, I went with one of their specialty cocktails, an El Camino D'Ici, featuring Canadian Club, Mezcal, maple syrup, and smoked ice cream (how do you smoke ice cream???). It's a very smoky cocktail, but it was tempered by maple syrup. For dinner, I went with the Arctic Char, which came with fingerling potatoes, sauteed green vegetables, and garnished with greens - again, well prepared. My dining experience was very laid back and relaxing, and I'd definitely return here on future visits to Montreal."

/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I attended the UYE Ae shucks event that was hosted at SVP Maestro. It is primarily located in the clubbing district of St. Laurent st but do not let that discourage you from checking thus place out! The cute little shop that is worth the commute after work especially since it's been around over 17 years in Montreal. Decor was simple and dimly lit. Great bar setup. We had a table in the back for our party of 5. I ordered a bloody Caesar 12$, and the happy hour special of a dozen Beau soleil oysters for 20$. Get two more free oysters when you check in with your yelp app ;) that's a steal when these oysters go for 3$ a piece! I loved the toppings- with two types of hot sauce ( including a red and a green tomatoe based sauce) and a red wine and pepper corn slush. The Beau soleil oysters we had were tremendous! Great flavours. Bill adds up pretty quickly but if you want quality for price - you won't be disappointed!"
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We came here for some oysters during happy hour. $20 for a dozen. They respect their Yelp check-in offer of 2 free oysters as well.The oysters are delicious and fresh! Beautifully presented. In fact all the plates I saw leaving the kitchen were beautifully presented! I highly recommend their oysters. Really enjoyed the mignonette sauce. 5 solid stars!We opted for some sides and I went with the calamari and the sangria cocktail. Unfortunately both of these fell well short of my expectations. The calamari plate was small and the calamari cut very small, into popcorn chicken style. Too much breading. I wasn't a fan of the dip with the calamari as well. The sangria wasn't the best mix I had and there was too much ice in a relatively small class. Not much value for the price asked. 2 stars.Our host was great! She was attentive, funny and we were taken care of. 5 stars.Price tag is a little high but you're paying for value here and I strongly recommend this place. Will be back for the oysters and maybe a main meal."
/user_details?userid=B7f5iHcyszjiHthLr5_6zA,TC N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"What a discovery! I don't know many places that have snow crab, Royal crab (King crab) and lobster on the menu, in addition to oysters and mussels, prawns, fresh fish, and other wonders of the oceans. There's even an oyster item for dessert. Very pleasant decor in a lovely neighborhood.I should say something about the service, since it has been commented on by some. I think they can be under-staffed - as was the case when I was there (twice, both on weekday nights). Expect some waiting if you ask for stuff. There is a waitress here who seems to be the lead staff, who probably has been around and clearly knows her stuff, and who will tell you like it is. It is what it is; I would still recommend this restaurant for the great food."
/user_details?userid=K3WD9VD0ko92aaQDIGflZQ,Lixmarie W.,"East Hartford, CT",1 star rating,"We decided to try this place because it was a very hot day and wanted a light, late lunch and early dinner. I don't even want to give place a star. When greeted it felt like we weren't welcomed, at first I thought it's because they just opened. Our waitress (who I think is the manager) was abrupt, rude, didn't even check on us. She didn't bring my husband the sauce he requested for his oysters. He ordered a Manhattan up but was on the rocks and it wasn't a Manhattan not even sure what the drink was. She checked on the other 2 tables so often and was beyond polite to them. I felt discriminated against first because we are young adults and second because we were Americans. If this is how she runs her establishment she will not succeed. The food was decent but since the service was so awful it ruined it for us. Will NEVER EVER GO back here again. We actually planned on ordering dinner but the service was so terrible that we asked for our bill and left. So sad."
/user_details?userid=LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A few of us got together for an oyster happy hour to catch up and swung by Maestro in part due to reputation, and in part due to their $20/dz special. We were fortunate enough to also benefit from their check-in offer of 2 free oysters. Of the 14 I had, only 1 had any shell. They were well shucked and mignonettes as well as hot sauces were available upon request. I enjoyed their house Caesar which came with it's own little shrimp, a nice touch particularly for the reasonable price of their cocktail. Their wine menu was reasonably priced and matched the quality of the food they prepare. Although the restaurant has a higher price tag than some other options nearby, the quality of food they use to prepare their dishes is apparent. They also have a number of particularly affordable options ranging from all you can eat mussels, oyster specials, and tapas specials dependent on the day and time of your visit (some on slow nights, some during happy hour, etc).Our table split a few dishes, including calamari and crab cakes. The crab cakes were absolutely delicious however I could not bring myself to understand their calamari. Although I took no issue with the volume of calamari, the preparation struck me as not matching the rest of the menu. The calamari were cut very small and tossed in an oddly flavored orange-ish breading (and too thick). For the rest of the menu to be so fresh and well presented this stuck out to me as though I had ordered them from an entirely different restaurant.We were fortunate to be served by Ilene herself (the owner) who was attentive, engaging, and even made a point of showing us the gorgeous plated dishes as they left the kitchen as we were seated right beside her path and she was aware of our curiosity."
/user_details?userid=7ULL-5M6z9YOkiutYxSGIQ,Paul L.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Normally I restrain myself from critical comment, but this one is outrageous. The food was okay, but the service was horrible. There is an old waitress who was very rude. She took the menu from my hand in such a hurry and I didn't finish order, which spilled my wine onto my friends' jeans. Yet no apology. We had a big group of around 12 people, and 4 of us ordered a starter plate while the rest of them did not. The main course of everyone was delayed until the four of us finished our starter, which we did not know. After we question the lady, she replied ""it's your friends' fault"". This is her original words and I didn't know how to comment on this. When you see a table of 12 people waiting for their food for more than an hour while 4 of them are dining, should you at least have the courtesy to check whether the rest of them want their main course to be served first? Instead, the waitress just blindly blaming the consumers ""it's your friends' fault"" to order a separate starter plate. Lately another young lady came to serve us for the bill, and we have to repeat again what we ordered. Clearly the first waitress did nothing correct and professional. Just when I thought things should be okay and ready to pay, I realized that the second waitress who operated the card machine already chose the 15% tips for me, which made me kinda uncomfortable and I told her what happened before. She clearly did not know about this and responded that she's just following the instruction and she apologized sincerely. Back then me and my friends just wanted to get out so we just paid the 15% tip and go. To conclude: if the second waitress who is quite nice is the norm of this place, the only reason that the first old lady does not get fired is that she might be the owner. Well, leave the work to the professional, even when you do want to serve yourself, try acting like one."
/user_details?userid=V_yDb-sO60p2w7hPxV5P5A,Alexander S.,"Birmingham, AL",5 star rating,"This is one of the best seafood restaurants I've ever visited. I was so obsessed with the food that I can't remember their interior or how the waitress looked like. I only remember that they have mezuzah on the front door.The worst thing I've ordered there was a seafood pasta. Pasta itself was ok, and seafood was good, but it wasn't a dish - it was just pasta and seafood put one on top of the other. There are much better ways to prepare all the ingredients togetherWe shared a dozen of oysters. That was an experience full of pleasant surprises. I never thought that there is such a variety of different tastes.And then there was a masterpiece - steamed mussels in blue cheese. That was something unbelievable. Beefy, dense mussels bathing in a tender sauce. I wish I've ordered a second portion instead of that pasta.We had a good wine pairing, but I've forgotten to write down what wine we had.Daughter had a kids version of pasta with tomato sauce, which I wouldn't order for myself, but she totally enjoyed it.Overall experience was more than pleasant. A nice alternative to the posh restaurants in downtown."
/user_details?userid=l1WJccBiZxxgjSgTN02RQg,Iris Y.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"This place is 100% a tourist trap with its oyster shells signed by celebrities in the front entrance. Here are a few of the critiques I have about this place:1. The food, not only way over price ($6 an oyster?!?!) it also severely lacked flavour and the presentation was subpar. I got the seafood linguine (the sauce was almost flavorless and needed salt). I was super underwhelmed.2. OUR FOOD TOOK ALMOST 2 HOURS TO COME OUT. When we asked where our food was the server proceeded to say since our patio is open we have to serve a lot more customers for the food takes longer. This is beyond unacceptable. First off the restaurant indoors wasn't full. Secondly, if you are going to open a patio with I would guess 50 or more seats to serve and a festival going on in the streets you need to either ensure you have enough kitchen staff to be able to accomodate for the increase in customers OR stop seating customers!3. The server got my order wrong which is fine because mistakes happen. HOWEVER the server was extremely rude and proceeded to go over to the computer check what she had punched in, come back over to me and tell me no you ordered this and this. I know what I ordered and I can tell you what you were trying to give me was not it! Also she never apologized which at this point I was already so hangry I didn't care anymore.I will say though that the drinks came out promptly but because our food took so long all the ice melted so they were watered down by the time our food got there. I recommend never coming into this place unless you want to pay for overpriced tasteless food and a long wait."
/user_details?userid=wW72FaqNPv6pdBC6AUqvcA,Hilary K.,"Vaudreuil-Dorion, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is a 5star seafood resto in my honest opinion! It's an oyster bar located on st laurent right next to big in japan and diablos. Street parking is hard since it's a very highly trafficked area.As soon as we walked in, the service: is absolutely phenomenal. The waiter was there to greet us and dressed in a fancy ensemble. Tables are very clean, cosy and superb. White tables with nice cutlery. The tables have The ""M"" engraved for ""Maestro"" it made me think of the emblem ""masterchef"" ahahaha so pretty. I wish they had more cocktail selections.. They only had like 5 different cocktail options on the rocks :( So if i had to complain i would only say to add more selection of cocktails on the menu. Tropical cocktails for the summer would be Amazing. The food: what can I say ? Ummm DEEEELICIOUS. I was so happy about the check in offer. They gave us 2 free beausoleil oysters on the house. That made me get an idea of the freshness. Omg i also recommend you trying the baked Rockefeller oysters gratin with Suisse cheese. It was melting in my mouth. We decided to go for the cooked seafood platter for 2. Let me tell you it was HUGE!! We got almost all the different types of fish in one huge plate. It was So filling and i kind of regret ordering an extra grilled lobster platter. We had in total a 1lb lobster on the table. It was so easy to break it and descale it. Thats when you know the food is fresh and cooked to the ultimate perfection. My cocktail was a watermelon and strawberry daiquiri.. It was not as sweet as I would have liked it but it was pleasantly delicious and you could taste the use of fresh fruits not frozen !Overall, the service and food were spectacular and I was so happy to come here! I will definitely be back when Im craving more seafood!!"

Not enough people to serve all the customers. We went as a group and ordered about $1000 food and wine. The waitress refused to split the bill for us. Agreed to do so after we insisted, but very unwillingly. Rude when taking away the plate. The tip is mandatory even with that quality of service. Like the other 1 star review said, just save the money and go elsewhere."

We both love crab and seafood and were in Montreal and thanks for the tip Yelp! This place is great.  We had an early dinner because we needed to drive almost 2 hours to get home.  And this place had a super oyster happy hour deal.  And it had a bonus deal for a yelp check in.  The oysters were absolutely delicious. Then we shared the cooked seafood dinner for 2.  It had crab, lobster, clams, calamari, shrimp..and more.  It was more than enough for us.  The service was great.  We had 3 different people helping us.  The bus person, waiter, and the chef.  By the time we were about to leave at 7pm..there was a line.  What a find.  I can't wait to go again and try some other menu items."

/user_details?userid=g5iI1I2m1xq5yx0450hQkg,Clarence F.,"Quebec City, Canada",3 star rating,"AYCE Mussels (not bad - some problems)Went for the all you can eat Mussels. Not bad. I suspect some of them were close to or past their best before date. There were quite a few fishy and off tasting mussels. The broths, which you could pick from 4, weren't bad. Good contrast in flavour - everything seasoned well. The mussel deal doesn't come with anything so we ordered 2 sides of frites. Both portions together was hardly an acceptable portion for 1 person let alone 3 of us sharing 2 orders. To make it worse each order of frites was 6(!!!) dollars. I have had better and a more acceptable serving of frites for less than half of the price of one order from here. They shouldn't be so arrogant with pricing - their quality isn't so good that they can charge $6 for a portion almost big enough for a baby. I should add the fries weren't crispy, but quite soggy and very bland. I will say that the service was very attentive and quite good. The best service coming from the busser who always kept our water glasses full, cutlery new and shell bowls emptied on the regular replaced with new fresh bowls. I personally wouldn't run back to this place, but if I find myself craving mussels again I wouldn't be opposed to giving them another shot."

We ordered the dozen oysters for 22$ we trusted the waiter to pic them for us, in the end we had du pay for every oyster individually. A real bummer. We also had the small seafood platter with an additional lobster, in the end it was only a half lobster for extra 35$ also a bummer, didn't expected it would be so expensive. We asked the Barkeeper in advance how much it would be and he meant it would be 15$, so we thought a hole lobster for 15$ that's fair we're into it. Well in the end it was not what we expected, because the place made a really good impression at first place."

This restaurant is a tourist trap with poor quality food, poor ambience, and a rip-off.  The highly rated reviews can not be legitimate nor trusted. We had dinner at Maestro last night. The mussels were undercooked, slimy and one of the three orders arrived cold - Yuck.  The appetizer of oysters arrived after the main course. I regularly order Moules avec Frites in restaurants and know how the dish should be served. Almost all restaurants serve mussels with French fries, so we ordered with French fries.  The fries, albeit tasty, were in a tiny plates, 1/4 of quantity what other restaurants serve. When the bill came they charged an extra $6 per person for French fries; a rip off. The interior of the restaurant temperature was cold and canned thumping music was so bothersome we asked the waiter to switch the music; a 1st for us.  This restaurant should be avoided."
/user_details?userid=HMIHCfW-2E4av8vmqM_UUg,Juliet S.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"Thank you to Maestro SVP for making a romantic weekend in Montreal a success!I heard from a friend that if you want to eat out in Montreal, you have to make a reservation. However, with limited wifi and no cell phone service, that can definitely be a struggle. After checking on OpenTable and seeing no availability, we decided to give it a shot and hope for the best.Though there were two tables with 'reserved' signs, Maestro gave one of them to us! I was so excited. The decor is intimate - dim lighting, oysters hung up on their Wall of Fame, simple white tablecloths. The servers were all very charming and friendly, and kept us served with fresh tap water and warm bread.We got the two promotional oysters by checking in on Yelp and ordered two more (YUM. YUM YUM YUM.) and ordered the Maestro Platter (Hot Platter) for two.Holy shit. This platter was HUGE. It was so much food and it was beautifully arranged! Even now, days after, I can still remember which sauce goes with what.The marmalade = coconut shrimpGin and Cheyenne (white sauce) = calamariPeanut sauce (sweet and brown) = shrimp satayGarlic butter = shellfishLemon butter(?) = shellfishThe platter includes half a lobster, crab legs, TONS OF MUSSELS, clams, coconut shrimp, and calamari. I literally inhaled the mussels, they tasted so good with the two butters. I wasn't a big fan of the calamari - too salty for me - but my boyfriend loved it. Guess it all worked out! We both thought the coconut shrimp was just okay. Too much breading and dried coconut flavor, not enough shrimp. The crab and lobster were delicious and the meat came out super easily. Hats off to Maestro, we'll definitely be back next time we're in town!"

Shared a cold platter for two as well as the 20 oysterswith a glass of white wine from France. The selections on the menu show by the bottle but you can always ask the selections by the glass. They had excellent ones so you can't go wrong with their recommendations. The cold platter was perfect portion, taste and freshness and the oysters were divine. Outdoor seating is great for a early evening dinner sincethe weather is perfect in June and they have lots of street events going on in Saint-Laurent Street. I have to say location, service, food was all perfect. Thanks to Maestro SVP for making this visit wonderful."

In this case, my friend who has an obsession with oysters celebrated his birthday at Maestro SVP. We were quite late for our reservation but they were very understanding and welcoming. Our party of 6 was the biggest in the resto that evening yet, it was very homey and welcoming. Behind us, a chalk board with the varieties of oysters provided demanded attention - and deciphering for oyster noobs like myself. Luckily, our waiter whom was very knowledgeable patiently explained the main differences and directed us towards a certain kind. He constructed a platter , which was delicious and varied. We decided to share a large platter along with entrees and main courses, so we might have ordered a tad much but it's was all so delicious!!! I must say the tuna Tartar stole the show for me! As well, they are known for their oyster shots-yes a shot with an oyster plopped at the bottom! Those were fun an enjoyable! There are even desert oysters with Grand Marnier for you true oyster lovers. We overstayed past closing (I AM SO SORRY FOR THIS) but we're treated so cordially and felt no pressure at all. This restaurant is a little pricier but if you have a passion or want to deepen your knowledge on oysters and similar seafood, Maestro SVP is the place to go!"

/user_details?userid=mYNZLYcnZol-oSfU-WP4CQ,Laney B.,"Las Vegas, NV",2 star rating,"It was my turn on the Montreal trip to choose the restaurant and boy have I been striking out in Montreal! I booked us a reservation at Maestros on opentable hoping it would be comparable to Mastros in LA... no such luck.The Tuna Tartare, just O.K.... a large hunk of cut up tuna with a pinch of seasoned salt on the plate and a couple very small nuggets of wasabi, served with wonton chips. Meh. Just OK.The Crab Cakes, just meh. The cakes themselves were a little mushy -- not thoroughly cooked. They're also served with a ""citrus"" sauce... if you can call it that. It's more of an orange sauce that tastes infused with a curry flavor -- which sounds good enough, and it was-- just not with the crab cakes-- at all. It completely overpowered the delicate flavor of the undercooked cake and just made everything taste worse.The 1/2lb of Mussels, again, meh. The mussels were thoroughly cooked and served in their white wine sauce. The sauce was very light and almost non existent. I found myself constantly adding salt and pepper for some flavor to this otherwise bland serving of mussels. (Other people mention aromatic with shallots and garlic-- where? How come mine weren't aromatic-- i had no shallots or garlic, just a plain, bland white wine sauce)The snow crab... meh. A set of snow crab legs served with a thimble of the worlds saltiest garlic butter known to man. The butter was gross, no joke -- and I loooovee butter. The crab legs weren't scored and were very messy. The crab soup was just for lack of better term; stupid. 100% uninspired. It was basically a bouillon cube beef broth with a couple shreds of crab (very sparse), a few shreds of cilantro and carrot. A complete waste of $12.Worth mentioning; I went to the bathroom and there was no toilet paper. Which was awful, but i had tissues in my purse. I told both the server and her bus boy that there was no toilet paper. They apologized and said they would take care of it.  30 minutes later I had to go to the bathroom again (Don't judge, I was having alcohol-- I'm small-- this happens-- lol). I walk into the bathroom, shut the door... still no toilet paper. i tell the server again and wait while she gets the toilet paper and puts it in.Also worth mentioning, there were 2 prostitutes or strippers that looked very unsavory dining at a large round table meant for 4 people, right in the front window of the restaurant. No problem, I just would rather not look at giant breasts and butt-cracks on parade while I'm supposed to be eating at a fine-dining establishment.On the bright side: The scallops were actually petty good, just not very large specimens. All things considered, if this were a ""Joe's Crab Shack"" and the dinner was $65 I'd have been O.K. with the meal. I feel like the price of a meal should reflect or temper the experience you're going to have as a patron of that establishment; but when you're paying $200 for a meal for 2, one expects a certain level of service and ambiance -- I really feel we didn't get what we paid for."

I ordered a dozen Beausoleil oysters for only 18$ (happy hour special) and it was yummy! I asked the same waiter what he suggested for wine--Prosecco, sparkling wine that cost $13 a glass! It was expensive, but very delicious and went well with the oysters.I also ordered the $16 1.5 lbs of mussels. I think that's really good price as it filled me up. The waiter recommended a flavor (it had tomatoes, celery and carrots) and he has good taste! I gobbled them up and had a great time. Mmm, seafood.They had awesome service, and I felt like the food was delicious. It's a bit pricey, but they were friendly.Definitely recommend the mussels - I feel like that was a great deal and I was super stuffed.

Aromatic in shallots and garlic, the brother complimented the mussels which were substantial and fresh. I finished one order and decided to hit another one to try the other sauce. After my second round of the basil and honey sauce, started to slow down. My valiant effort was halted before I could challenge the third sauce - the marinara."
/user_details?userid=qt1b6zXExL-uoJGRRouQYw,Tanya N.,"Mountain View, CA",3 star rating,"I decided to go to Maestro SVP since my fiance loves oysters.  From all the reviews I had some high expectations.  The place was classy with white linens, had a number of blackboards with a list of their oysters, their ""hall of fame for most oysters eaten"" etc and exposed brick walls.  Service was sufficient so no complaints there. We came during a week night so their happy hour special of a dozen Beausoleil oysters for $13 was available.  We ordered that, their hot seafood platter ($75) and their carmalized salmon in a miso marinade ($9) off their tapas menu. The oysters were fresh and tasty - we both enjoyed them. The salmon was also very good with a light crispiness on the outside and flakey.  We didn't enjoy the platter that much, which was unfortunate because there was just so much in it.  It included: bruschetta, snow crab, clams, steamed mussels, coconut shrimp, fried calamari, 1/2 lobster,  chicken and shrimp satays.  5 sauces were available for dipping: garlic butter, lime butter , cayenne/gin, Thai peanut, and orange horseradish.  We didn't have the peanut sauce due to allergies. The bruschetta was delicious. It had a layer of cheese and the tomatoes were fresh. The drawback on the platter was the coconut shrimp, chicken & shrimp satays and mussels. There was way too much coconut batter for the shrimp. In the beginning I removed half the batter but then by the 2nd one, I just removed all of it.  Coconut overload - you couldn't really taste the shrimp.  The satays' meat was dry and the mussels weren't very flavourful. Just mushy and the sauces couldn't save them. I'd stick to oysters if I go back."

The Cold Seafood Platter was incredibly fresh and delicious. My favourite items were the crab legs and the tuna tartare, although there wasn't a weak item on the platter.For dessert, we ordered oysters with Grand Marnier granite. The order was  forgotten, but we were still enjoying our wine, so it wasn't a big deal. I will however, dock a single star for it. Eventually they arrived, our server apologized and told us they would be free of charge. For that I will award them a bonus star!Overall, service was excellent.

We had the scallop appetizer and it was also super tasty and flavourful, albeit there was only 3 on the plate, the flavour more than made up for it. We then had a couple dozen oysters. They have a happy hour where NB oysters are only $16 for a dozen and then we ordered another dozen of other types of oysters. All were delicious and fresh. Finally we initially were going to order some fish but realized that we went on their all you can eat mussel night. Amazing! I think it was around $20 for the all you can eat! Can't beat the price plus they had 3 different sauces that you could order. A different sauce with each round if you wanted. My fav was the white wine sauce. It was lovely.

We ordered an assortment of raw oysters, all of which were delicious, and shared the Madagascar mussels (cream, brandy and poivre vert - so good) and a shrimp/onion appetizer that I can't remember the English name of (sorry Yelpers :( ). Did seem a bit pricy so we knocked off a star, but overall the restaurant was lovely and we would recommend it to anyone else looking to have a nice seafood dinner in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=KjJU-AOtov1B1Sa8gFeXpA,Annie Z.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",5 star rating,This restaurant was very nice. My husband and I order 2 dozens of their oyster special. It was not as fat as I had hoped but this is probably due to the time of season that I went. The seared scallops are probably one of the best I've had. The crabcakes were ok. I didn't order alot because we weren't really hungry and wanted to save room for dessert at Julliette et Chocolat. I gave it 5 stars not only because of the food but the service. The owener was very attentive. Our bill wasn't significantly large but she was very nice and came by our table at least 5-6 times to see if everything was ok. On top of that the waitress came by to serve us at least 5-6 times during the meal. Very cozy place. Will definately come back when I go to Montreal.
/user_details?userid=2LptcvhkcFyNXT_NZDPpaQ,Luca M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Maestro SVP is worth every penny and the proprietor, Ilene, runs the place like clockwork.Come here for the oyster happy hour (12 beausoleil for $13) for sure, it is really a great deal. The happy hour is (according to the website)   every day from 11am to 7pm and all night on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.I've never eaten their a-la-carte menu, but from what I hear the Maestro platters are to die for, particularly the cold one.I reserved a New Year's Eve dinner at Maestro back in 2007. $80 a person back then got us a small but tasty appetizer and soup and three Malpeque oysters. The next creation to land on our table blew my mind.It consisted (for each person) of a platter no shorter than two feet where, on a bed of ice, were resting a bowl of mussels, two enormous tiger shrimps, half a lobster, half a snow crab and a few side garnishes.I am a good eater, as many of my friends will attest. I struggled to finish the plate despite it being heavenly. The cracking sounds from those crab legs shattering and the surgical removal of that tender flesh were satisfying beyond belief.Even on a busy night Ilene will keep guests entertained and will strike up some conversation. As for wine, trust your instinct and tastes. I dig the Orvieto Classico Melini. It used to be the cheapest wine on their list, now they've added some more. It's definitely good. My preference for it stems from my inherent Italian bias. But that is OK, since Italy is to good food what America is to capitalism.Maestro is one of those restaurants that make Montreal so awesome."
/user_details?userid=8fgUrSp4ubs7uPqz1zwnUw,Jessica S.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"This past weekend, a New Yorker and her Torontonian friend went to Montreal to ring in 2012. We played the whole weekend by ear, wandering around town on New Years Eve day and spending the evening drinking wine on a mostly deserted and fully freezing St. Helen's Island. After returning to our lodgings at Hotel Zero 1 to warm up and relax, the Torontonian got a hankering for oysters. She'd read about Maestro SVP during previous oyster restaurant researchings, so we decided to give them a call to see if we could make a last-minute New Years Eve reservation. The New Years gods must have been looking down on us, cause Maestro SVP had plenty of room for us and an awesome special menu. The New Years menu had 4 courses, with a few items to choose from for each course (except the dessert). The menu was totally in French, which presented a tiny challenge considering that my efficiency in French is limited to guessing what things mean based on context clues; however, our waitress was very cool about translating things for me when I got stuck. My friend and I took full advantage of our options and shared our orders. For the first course, we got the salmon and tuna tartare (which came with wonton chips) and the salmon ceviche (which had guacamole on top). Totally hit the spot! We followed that up with baked oysters and cold shredded duck over a bed of shredded carrots, which had a yummy cole slaw kind of taste to it. Then came the main event. We rang in 2012 with a big plate of tasty cold seafood on ice (shrimp, oysters, mussels, tuna tartare, and a lobster) and a complimentary glass of champagne. Then, to top the night off, dessert was a chocolate lava cake with raspberry sauce and fresh whipped cream.Couple all that with a bottle of Pinot Blanc and some New Years noisemakers and hats, and we ended up having ourselves the exact New Years celebration that we were hoping for (and another customer got herself an engagement ring as well!)."
/user_details?userid=9bZnTLM9G1XW4BubaxESsQ,Kay C.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"This place was great. They let our dog lay under our table on the patio, it was late Friday night and we were the only ones sitting there. It was nice and convenient, considering we intended to get takeout. Service was quick and efficient, and the wine list was one of the most reasonable I've ever seen. We had a tasty Muscadet for under $60! We had the Seafood Platter for 2, while it was tasty and a good value for the price, I've had better elsewhere. The oysters specifically were way too small, I understand they're basic Beausoliels, but most were the size of nickels. If I were to find myself in Montreal again, I'd fill up on their much bigger selection of oysters, rather than get the platter. Overall it's a nice spot, and the tiny patio facing St. Laurent certainly made for an interesting evening!"

The only thing we new of Montreal was to check out Old Montreal and St.-Laurents. My friend and I ended up strolling into Maestro and like the rest of the entire street it wasn't very busy.We were very pleased with the oysters and amazed by the selection.What separated Maestro from almost every other restaurant I've ever eaten at, is that the owner actually sat down and talked to us after shucking some oysters for us. She wasn't trying to sell anything, but was simply amazingly friendly and gave us so much information about her place and all of Montreal.In an age of corporate restaurants and distant owners, it was a pleasant change to sit down at Maestro SVP."
/user_details?userid=GFAIqNa5ESMej7ZbMKdkYA,Debbie P.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"We were visiting Montreal for the first time and were very unfamiliar with what to do and where to eat. So when it came to a place to dine, we relied on Yelp as it has helped us out before while in a new place. We really wanted seafood, and oysters in particular. One restaurant jumped out at us and had received high ratings...Maestro S.V.P. We called to see if reservations were needed for just two people...we were pleased that none were needed...perhaps because it was late evening on a Tuesday. When we arrived, the restaurant had many guests, but we were pleased to be seated immediately. The first course of action was to order the happy hour oysters...a dozen for just $13! Then we perused the extensive wine list and ordered a lovely bottle of French Pinot Blanc...to go with the seafood. Perfect. We then had to decide on dinner. The menu had a lot to offer, but were particularly pleased with the tapas menu, which we understand to also be offered Tues-Thurs all night long. Again, perfect, as we love to try different items rather than to be limited to just two entrees. There was so much food from which to select that we became a little confused...""What to order?"", ""What is best?"", ""How much is too much?"". It was those questions that we presented to our server, who was ever so pleasant and knowledgeable. She helped us to select the perfect arrangement of tapas to meet the discretion of our palate. Being friendly, we asked her name...to which she responded ""Ilene"". I had remembered her name as being the owner, from the Yelp reviews. She confirmed that she was. This made us even more impressed...Ilene, a working owner, who is genuinely helpful and friendly with her guests...big points!! All of the tapas we ordered were delectable!! Of special note; however, was the calamari (Ilene said it was a must order and I'm glad we followed her advice), the port & blue cheese baked oyster (words can't describe!), the Cajun seafood (unbelievable! We even had to wind up ordering bread because we simply could not pass on every bit of the broth!), and the Thai curry vegetables. Everything was D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!! We highly recommend this restaurant! The food and service were without flaw. The ambiance was perfect as well...it had the perfect balance of casual and sophistication that would make any guest feel at ease. Next time we are in Montreal, this restaurant will be on our ""must do"" list!!!"

We spent our birthday dinner there while on getaway weekend watching the Rogers Cup final. Took a chance on this place. We live in Boston and know oysters. This place was better than we had at home. Ilene chose a great selection for us. We had some prosecco and house mignonet to go with. Perfect evening."
/user_details?userid=myBJTL7NmFDKLWA3QDsVUA,Marissa G.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"I went for the happy hour oysters which were delicious but I don't think I had one oyster without shell in it. I also enjoyed the calamari which was nice and crispy but very bland. I've had much better for much less and the service was very agressive for an empty restaurant. Also, the waitress gave me an incorrect price for the wine she suggested and no information about which oysters I was recieving."
/user_details?userid=dC6F5f6Aatm8C8nRrs6otQ,G C.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"We're budget travelers but stumbled on this place and couldn't resist the $15 all you can eat mussels. Yum! They have three different sauces but I liked the Cajun the best. The mussels special is only on Sundays and Mondays, but if you happen to be in Montreal on those days, it's a superb value."
