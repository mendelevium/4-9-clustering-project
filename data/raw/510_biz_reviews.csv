/user_details?userid=-EFC5OY77pnhKwlZoqOpJA,Bruce T.,"Riley Park, Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,Moved in to the neighbourhood recently and wandered in for some takeout for dinner.  The food was amazing!  The tartelette de tomates is jewelled with sweet tiny tomatoes.  The Corsican flatbread is warm and delicious.  Pissaladiera is a little bit of anchovy heaven. Mains are consistently tasty.  Nicely presented.  Travelled well on the way home.  Delicious.  Desserts are small but just the right size to finish the meal without putting it over the top.  Nice wine selection. Well priced.   Will definitely return!

Will definitely go again!"

I was able to order the few vegetarian things on their menu but they were all superb. My husband, whose gluten free, had much more to choose from. The atmosphere with open windows in early July was lovely and the waiter was very nice and accommodating."
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This restaurant is so cute! It was a bit empty tonight when I went with my friend but it is a Tuesday night. The food was so good and so affordable!! My steak with fries and salad was only $12!! And it was good! Definitely not the best steak I've ever had but for the price it was a good size and I liked the gravy they put on top. It was just as good as the $25 steak I had on Saturday night at another restaurant. Also the fries were so good- crunchy  and salty just how I like 'em. The mayo it came with tasted homemade too. My friend had the arancini balls, the gnocchi, the socca and a side of fries.The arancini balls are huge! I had a bite and it was crunchy on the outside with a bit of tomato sauce on top. I enjoyed it! The pesto gnocchi was one of the best gnocchi I ever had! It was so soft and mushy but in a good way and the pesto made it so tasty! So I've never had socca before today. It's a crêpe made with chickpea flour and is popular in the south of France. It was cut up into triangles. I had high hopes for it but it tasted burnt to me. I'm glad I didn't order it. My friend wasn't a big fan either. She found it too salty. Overall I liked the food except for the socca. I want to come back and try more stuff on the menu. Also they have $20 wine bottles on Mondays so I will definitively be back!"
/user_details?userid=ZKr4YuXdzq41sVk-_29k-w,Franki H.,"New Haven, CT",5 star rating,"Oh my gosh. Okay, this place wasn't on my initial list of places to eat in Montreal. I hadn't really picked dinner places so I saw good reviews and the menu intrigued us, so we went on a whim for dinner. Thank gosh we did because this was such a good meal. First off, the space is rather small, but really cute and open. It felt inviting and quiet, a nice place to eat if you're looking to talk and not have music or noise competing for air space. The service was very kind and helpful. We were served in English and helped with an English menu, so no worries there if you don't handle French well! The food though. We had a cheese plate, the gnocchi tapas (not the entree sized), the socca, and the arancini. Wow. The gnocchi was SO soft. It just melted in the mouth. The flavor was so well-balanced and delicious. It was just perfect. I love good gnocchi and this was exactly what I look for. The socca is a dish from the South of France. It's a crepe-like thing but made of a chickpea based dough that's then cut into finger-food sized bites and seasoned with salt and pepper. It's really yummy. My boyfriend was smitten with these. Plus, it was a fun thing to try that I'd never seen before! The arancini, which is a fried ball of risotto, was really good as well. Unlike many places, it was rather soft and the crust of the fry was rather tender and crumbly. It didn't stand up to the gnocchi for me, but was great. Then, the cheese plate was wonderfully made with ample bread and accompaniments, but the cheeses themselves just didn't wow me.Price-wise, everything was very affordable. The most expensive thing was the $18 cheese plate, but the tapas were each around $11 and the socca was less, like $5-$7. The portions fit the prices well, but we didn't leave hungry. The quality with those prices was amazing. Overall, I'd push anyone to go try this place. It was so quiet when we were there and just seems unknown (I didn't read about it before being in Montreal!), but go, go, go. It's so worth it."
/user_details?userid=wJF-NdtxYCk_SrwG4UUL9Q,Stephanie L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here on a cold Tuesday night with a friend. The place was almost empty, only 3 tables were taken. It's in a great location, near Metro Mont Royal. Very cute inside, has à French bistro feel. We ordered beef carpaccio, terrine du jour, pesto gnocchi and the magret. The first two came very fast, the carpaccio came with French fries, which were so hot and crunch. Truly delicious fries. Thé terrine was fine, nothing to write home about, it would have been nice if they accompanied it with hot bread. After these two, we waited an incredibly long time for the gnocchi and duck. This was a little surprising given that there were only 2 other tables. We received the gnocchi first, it was very good, little pillows of potato melted in my mouth. Maybe one of the best gnocchi's I've had! The duck came a while after that and it was warmish, not hot. For the price of this dish - $42 - I would've thought it would at least come hot. Sent it back and I am pretty sure they used a microwave to heat it up, as the meat was curled and dry. So that was pretty disappointing. It came with two types of duck one with grapes and one with a red wine sauce. The red wine duck was far superior, the grape duck was okay."
/user_details?userid=TYyjzs83gnu9a-neVVSODA,Alejandro D.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"Really great food, in a classy but low-key casual environment. Not too hipster, or too old school.The service was also spectacular. I did my best to order in French, and the waiters very graciously humored me and spoke back s-l-o-w-l-y. Merci.Perfect for a date night, or nice dinner with friends."
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This restaurant is just minutes away from where I live so I was pretty excited to try it. Their food is great, it's definitely their main sale point and the atmosphere is pretty relaxing as well. The service could have been a little bit better, the person in charge of taking our order made a mistake, which she did correct later. Then, another misplaced order but in the end the meal topped all of our expectations, so I'm definitely keeping this place on my 'must visit again' list."
/user_details?userid=3kfLeWDlZF1Pv2sqLXJxtA,Kevin F.,"Fair Lawn, NJ",4 star rating,"You'll feel like you're in a quaint French town as soon as you walk in.You'll be greeted by incredibly nice staff as soon as you enter. Service is quick, the food is tasty and the atmosphere is very cozy and romantic with the background music. I'm not the biggest lamb fan in the world, but the lamb shank here was as good as I've ever had. The meat melted right off and was tender and tasty.One minor criticism was that the parfait dessert I had was quite hard. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like that, I was expecting something a bit softer. It was difficult to eat with a spoon but it still tasted quite nice."
/user_details?userid=x6XrlIPC4FYRgAM3JHj_JQ,Whistler L.,"Bellevue, WA",2 star rating,"This restaurant is the fast food grade, in terms of food, service and etc.  It's seen everywhere in the internet,  so their business solely relies on the internet strategy and one time tourists. Most customers there are tourists and speaking English.Food is way overpriced. Chez Lévêque has way  better service and food quality, but it costs less than Plein Sud."
/user_details?userid=UFlWa8XfqcCQF-QvKIFz2A,Ronna L.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"Cozy setting with a solid menu of crowd-pleasing French dishes. I had the lamb (a specialty of the house), and it was perfect, juicy, falling off the bone, accompanied by a sweet potato purée, lentils and haricots verts. My husband had steak and frites. When we visited, the proprietor was also the only bartender and server, and he managed to do it very well, with friendliness and efficiency. Would highly recommend for those looking for a delicious, if not necessarily innovative, meal and good service."

/user_details?userid=pqlLJVba9KAtahkjvNINYg,Caitlin C.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"First time visiting Montréal, and staying in the neighborhood - I am so glad to have found Plein Sud nearby on Yelp. After a long travel day, our group loved the laid back vibes of this small, chic wine bar. With wines and foods inspired by the south (""sud"") of France, we were excited to try a variety of tapas plates. Nothing disappointed. Armed with a full bottle of Syrah to share, we dove into the stuffed calamari, pesto gnocchi, meat and cheese plate, and speciality toast. Unflinchingly, my friend declared that calamari to be the best squid she has every had. I could say the same about the gnocchi... I ate them so slowly because I never wanted them to end! The variety of meats and cheeses were, of course, also delicious. And the seasonal special was a nut/raisin bread with prosciutto, cheese, and strawberries. The quality of food and wine for what was only $35 (CAD) each is absurd. Needless to say, we are so thankful to have stayed close by so that we were able to find Plein Sud!"
/user_details?userid=vS_6QTugCkLV1BVMYeA3hA,Paul L.,"Wilton, CT",5 star rating,"There are so many placed in Montreal it is hard to pick. This is out of the main tourist area, and worth the trip.  As others have said, the Lamb Shank (one of the two specialties of the house) is fantastic. Not a ton to eat, so don't be scared to order it. Beautifully flavored and prepared. Served with some nice vegetables.My wife had the veal stew with gnocchi. I am not sure which dish was better! Great flavor and perfectly cooked gnocchi.When we walked in, we were the only ones there, so were a bit nervous. But not to worry, it was great. Just one waiter and a sort of waitress/bar maid. Maybe even the owners? The man made great suggestions on what to order. The Corsican beer was also good."
/user_details?userid=cpChkPvGOhp8lcyiLwj3eA,Hibeh D.,"Berlin, CT",4 star rating,"We came in on the early side on a Friday evening. The main bar area was full so we were seated in the adjacent room. I was disappointed as we were the only ones there  for the duration of our visit-I'm a people-watcher and while I like to hear myself speak, I don't enjoy being the only party in the room ;). The small plates and wine we sampled, however, more than made up for it. The charcuterie platter was a work of art. The homemade chips were delicious-we ordered a second round. As Americans, we wondered if they had a dip for the chips-at a loss, our wonderful server brought us some homemade mayonnaise to use as dip. She certainly aimed to please! The vegetable soup we started with was also very good. Although they did serve entree sized meals, our group opted for the small plates. Portions were reasonable and prices were fair. As we were leaving, a larger party was being seated next to us. I think as the evening progresses, the place may get livelier."
/user_details?userid=xwsizhe6SSbUiCRm3rn6mw,Conor O.,"New York, NY",1 star rating,Awful experience. Do not order the steak. It was the worst- chewy and inedible. They charged for it anyway. Stay away.
/user_details?userid=aNfG4yqETNKXNQgc2qTToA,Doris Z.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",3 star rating,"Came here for a lunch because of the great Yelp reviews. The service was exceptionally well. We ordered both the salad and the soup. The soup was too salty and the owner gladly exchanged it to a salad. I got the medium rare beef and my bf got the veal pasta. My beef wasn't very flavourful and the fries was ok. I personally prefer crispy ones. My bf's veal was a little tough to chew, but the sauce was a great company to the pasta. The dessert was a small piece of pear cake, dense, moist and tasty. Overall, this ain't a restaurant that I would visit again, but the lunch was only $20/person. It was a good deal."
/user_details?userid=dBOD0jCnRXWGzxRAAle99Q,Amy G.,"Cleveland, OH",5 star rating,"SO GOOD! And not only was it good, it was very reasonably priced. Our waiter was kind, attentive, and funny. He was also taking care of a large group (I assume a birthday celebration, but my French is too rusty to know for sure!) and he seemed very personable with them, too.My companion and I did not have drinks, but we each had an entree (the Duck and the Lamb Shank) and a dessert (Creme brulee). The dishes were beautifully plated and focused heavily on the meat; it was in the center of the dish and the ""side dishes"" were very small and surrounded the meat. They served their purpose of enhancing my lamb, and I wouldn't have really wanted more to eat. Both meats were tender and flavorful - the duck came with mushrooms and a brown sauce that worked really well together. I was so excited when my dinner came that I forgot to take a picture!The desserts were modest, but tasty. I was less impressed with them (compared to our dinner, but that's going to be difficult to counter!). All in, we spent less than $100CAD and it was worth every penny."
/user_details?userid=dnDpYU7JH3Gun_fwun_zeA,Loren F.,"Casas de Millán, Spain",5 star rating,"We really enjoyed this restaurant.  It has a small but complete menu of French dishes.  The waiter was excellent.  We dined here twice, and he remembered us from our first visit.  We were able to eat outdoors on the first visit due to unusually warm weather, and it was delightful.  The French food was nicely prepared and attractively served.  My partner liked the beet and chevre appetizer so much he ordered it both times we visited.  He had the liver (!) one time, and the steak the other.  Both were delicious.   I had the fish and it was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The atmosphere is charming and the food is competitively priced.  This is definitely one of the best restaurants in the Plateau neighborhood."

/user_details?userid=nFEGwWy6ltXt4M-CsQXk-A,Yue Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Generally speaking it's worth a second time visit. The owner was so nice, explaining the menu to us in English when he noticed that we don't speak French. I ordered a veal pasta and it was good. The salad was plain though. The after-meal dessert was a bit too moisture that made the texture went loose."

The staff was super friendly, and the food was great and reasonably priced!I had the veal with gnocchi - and it was so nice I almost cried. The perfect comfort food on a rainy night in Montreal. The menu did not have any vegetarian options, but the kitchen made a delicious meat-free pasta dish for my friend. Although we were quite full, we decided to try their profiteroles for dessert. Yummy! We will be back!"

Both were over cooked. And the duck plain. We loved the Colomba beer and the basil creme brûlée. The waiter was also very nice! It was a bit overpriced for what we received though. Overall we were a little disappointed.

/user_details?userid=7kGxOoefe5H-HMxKIS9QrQ,Ahmad H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I went to Plein Sud twice during the last month which might give you an idea about how much I liked it the first time I went there. It's situated in the Plateau-Mont Royal neighborhood, at a walking distance from the Mont Royal metro station. Their Table d'hote for lunch comprises of a soup/salad, a main dish and a dessert. I opted for the cold soup which was excellent. It was more like a vegetable smoothie (albeit less viscous) than a soup but excellent nonetheless. The Onglet de Boeuf that I ordered was done to perfection and the petit choux dessert was very good as well.We liked their cooking so much that we decided to go there once more to check out their famous Magret de Canard. They had cooked it in a Fig sauce with a gratin and a salad on the side. It was exceptionally good. The dinner Table d'hote doesn't have a dessert included, so you'll have to pay extra for if you need any. We opted for the crème brulée and found to our liking.The dinner can hit your pocket hard if you add wine and dessert to your meal and you might end up paying approximately $50/person. But this isn't meant to be a criticism, it's only a heads-up to fellow Yelpers. All in all a very good experience. I'd recommend this restaurant to my friends/family.Table d'hote lunch: $15-18Table d'hote dinner: $25-30"
/user_details?userid=dfB-XW_RwAcIKmFrZK7U1A,Amanda C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Update time! I recently returned for a loved one's birthday and we will definitely be returning!I was very much impressed with the service. The hosts were friendly and casual yet professional. The menu was explained to us, the wine was brought, and we were given lots of time to discuss. The food! Fancy yet homey. I had the hanger steak with blue cheese sauce and it was fantastic! Small pieces of steak bathed in a mild blue cheese sauce with a bowl of fries. The other stand out meal was the fish of the day, on that day cod in a mild curry sauce with a mix of veggies. The duck breast was nothing out of the ordinary, but deliciously tender nonetheless. Pleun Sud has a nice selection of private import wine, at reasonable prices. We ordered both a white and a red, and were very satisfied with both. Eating at Pkein Sud is a great experience. If you want to go out for a fun special occasion dinner, with delicious French food without the formalness and pretentiousness occasionally found in French restaurants, this is the place."

What a delightful waiter with a charming smile and dancing eyes!  We all cleaned our plates. My lamb shank was one of the best I have eaten with the meat falling off the bone.   My family also ate the duck breast, the fettuccini w coppa and pork. And don't forget the dessert profiteroles: 2 small ones that were just the right size. Yum!"

/user_details?userid=_gCV6FZfDeN2VqbDOcfMhQ,Zack F.,"Vancouver, Canada",2 star rating,"We had the leg of lamb and the pork with rosemary. Both were mediocre - not particularly moist. We enjoyed the sides more than the mains - both came with sweet potato puree, some vegetables, and lentils. The pork came w/ some limp sweet potato fries. Service was poor. Our waiter disappeared after taking our order to handle another section. We had to request that they bring the complimentary bread, and flag down some other waiter to request the bill. No water refill until we paid the check. We had some leftovers and requested that it be boxed up, but only the main dish was boxed; a nice piece of pork was discarded."
