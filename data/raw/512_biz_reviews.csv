/user_details?userid=vsKRK50xBL8hy3Kb_dqGlg,Wendy H.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,I like cook to order food as opposed to scooping it from a chafing dish!  I've tried their rice and yakisoba bento meals and both are excellent. They give you equal amounts veggies and meat. I usually order my bento with the gyoza and California roll. Both are very good. A great economical option for meals!

/user_details?userid=RO55qRu4TvHogzSOGERxKA,Anahita M.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,I stopped by here while I was shopping at Centre Eaton and ordered a Chicken Yakisoba plate. The food is meh but I guess it's just average mall food. The chicken was fine but the noodles were way too greasy. They do give you a free drink with your meal if you show them your student ID so that's good.

I got the chicken teriyaki plate which came with rice, chicken and some vegetables. The woman at the cash was really nice and helpful and she even told me McGill and Concordia students get a free drink with their meal if they show their school ID which was a great surprise. The food is made to order, the chefs are quick and efficient and you can really tell the difference because it tastes fresh. Overall good service and good food in this food court spot."
/user_details?userid=cK-tsr9qzvDzq0UjmvDsuA,Amy Y.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Love the #6 chicken yakisoba noodles.  It still taste fresh, good, and healthy for fast food.  I love cabbage in my stir fry.  They also have chicken curry.  I like the fact that they have a rice, noodle, and soup option. We love to come to the food court and mainly eat here.  There is free wifi here as well.  Cafeteria style too, if you love to people watch.  This is also underground/below the mall. Corners at St Catherine/McGill. Good food here overall."

/user_details?userid=17iYh7v5zhZXINObBfZLoA,JamJumpin M.,"Pickering, Canada",2 star rating,"I normally love Edo, but this one just wasn't as good. The vegetables didn't look fresh and the meat was left bubbling in a metal container on the hot plate. The sauce was also sweeter than I am used to. Disappointing."
