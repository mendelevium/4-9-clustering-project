/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"What a positive experience I had at Pinoy! The staff are so nice and helpful. There's so many yummies I had to try. This isn't a full sized resto so don't come here in groups of 10+. At best they can accommodate maybe 1 group. If you do come here in a groups of 4 to 8, you'll be perfectly fine.I tasted my first sisig and it was glorious. It was sizzling upon presentation taunting me to be eaten but to be careful.... or I'd get burned. Time are hard. I devoured this culinary delight before it fully cooled down. I've been craving to have another plate since my visit!We tried other plates as well, they were all tasty but failed to compare to the sisig! Lovely traditional plates.I also went with their mango bubble tea and quite frankly it was the best bubble tea I've ever had! I could have an amazing plate of sisig and a large bubble tea for under $15. This is insanely good. What a deal. What a great dining experience. I'm totally going to be back. Sisig, I'll be back. My love. My precious. My Sisig."
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",5 star rating,"Pinoy Pansitan is an exceptional restaurant. This place is a serious surprise in how good, fresh, delicious and downright awesome the experience is. If you haven't tried Filipino food realize it's unlike most anything Asian you will find. Lots of dishes revolve around pork and they also love their seafood and fish! Another difference is Filipinos love the condiment mixture of soya sauce and vinegar. For selection of menu offerings it was upon the recommendation of a good Yelper Charles that we try out the noodle dishes. I coerced the fellas I was with to give the sizzling sssig a go and it was the highlight of the night. Ssssig is a mixture or pork jowl and liver with other not as eaten pork bits chopped up into smaller bits and seasoned with lemon and spices. It's a delectable delight. The other dishes we sampled were the regular pancit bihon which had a mixture of fish cake vegetables and some tender lechon (grilled pig). The pancit was very solid also. The last dish we had was the palabok pancit. This is a seafood pancit (noodle)which is done differently depending on the chef. I've had it before very strong seafood gravy before (made by Filipino friends relatives) and this version was milder served here. It was good but not as amazing for me.The inside setting is very casual. Lots of Filipino families and others watching TV in Tagalog at the picnic type tables. Chowing down and enjoying a meal or snack. The inside decor is lots of wood. The restaurant is simple unpretentious. Don't come expecting much. The food is out of this world."
/user_details?userid=puMWOwZTa1A2B9oMRFl7KQ,Jason H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Small and tucked away in Cote Des Neiges this place has been recommended by many sites as the best and most authentic Filipino Reston in Montreal.  Now I'm no expert on Filipino food but it was absolutely delicious, didn't know what most of it was I just pointed to a chicken and pork dish and it came with a huge portion of rice for 10 bucks.  I left happy and full, very nice staff and atmosphere I would recommend if your in the area and want a quick bite.  I will for sure be going back."

/user_details?userid=BjeyTXxk61rAdWyHiLHg9w,Sehrish N.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"A small Filipino restaurant. It has wooden tables, benches and stools. I went with a fairly large group of friends for the buffet but because it's a small restaurant, we couldn't eat all together. They put banana leaves on a table and spread the food all over, which you then eat with your hands. There was rice, fish, shrimps, oysters, chicken, pork, sausage, mangoes and some veggies. Unfortunately I couldn't eat most of the food because I only eat halal. However the fish was very well seasoned and tasted great! The whole concept was such a wonderful experience. Being with friends made it better. The buffet was $25 per person (cash/debit only). The staff was very nice and made sure there was enough food. Would I go back? No, because I can't eat most of the food. Also I found the benches uncomfortable to sit and eat on."

/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I am invited to friend's birthday to Pinoy Pansitan.I have tons of Filipino friends; and I ate at their places countless times. So I know what is Filipino food is.So when I received the invite; I was told the place takes only cash or debit. Plus, the type of food that I would eat, will be my hand. I am intrigued; plus I have experience to eat by hands since we are Indians and Bengali.When I arrived, a long table was set up for 30 people. It is called a boodle fight, or in Filipino called Kamayan. The table was filled with banana leaves, and food on top of them. There were rice, chicken thighs, oysters, sausages, grilled fish (with bones), Chinese broccoli, eggplants, eggs, pork chops, shrimps, mango, cucumbers, tomatoes and strawberry... So 30 people sat around the table, were eating with their hands in one big plate... ( banana leaf).What an experience! The food tasted so good, that there no words to describe.The service was amazing. People were friendly. Guess what, it cost only 25$ per person. I highly ask everyone to experience this boodle fight... but go with a big gang... it's more fun."
/user_details?userid=Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Oh wow. There is something that hits my heart and reminds me of being taken care of as a kid, and that's chicken and rice soup. Often this flavor is also in Chinese congee, and it happened to be in the most delicious rice porridge I've ever had. The first spoonful transported me somewhere else....called Lugaw with Tokwa't and Baboy the rice porridge is accompanied by pork and tofu in a vinegary marinade. Familiar and fresh at the same time, I am hooked on it. We also had the sizzling Pork Sisig which was a first for me, but also had some flavors that I recognized. Just in case we didn't have enough we also got the Pancit Palabok, which my guy said was totally traditional and how he remembered it. To round out the meal we got Halo Halo, and I spent quite a while digging around enjoying all the ingredients. This is a wonderful little spot, and I hope more people find it."
/user_details?userid=EVvgZ2YBoxX7iHv5A4Hohw,Annilyn T.,"Revere, MA",4 star rating,"We drove all the way from Boston and was starving after. I was searching for some Filipino food in the area and this one was the closest that was still open around that time. It's my first time having Filipino food in Montreal. Since the last time I went there were not able to go to one since we only have a little time spent there this time my friend so I had a chance to go to this place. The place wasn't really that big it was just enough for like a few people to sit down and eat. Why can't the combo with the rice and two sides of meat to come with the food. Which wasn't a bad deal, they don't serve you as much it was just enough for one person to eat. It was a tiny little space but it was cozy. The workers are friendly too! Which was nice and accommodating for me since I'm from the same country. Only stayed for a little bit after we ate since were running out of time and it was kind of late already. I would come back if given the chance. Maybe for my next trip to Canada I'll stop by again for some lunch/dinner there"
/user_details?userid=Iu5mS8o02-RGpjJdxI0v7w,Harry K.,"Laval, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here on an UYE organized by Christina T. What made me want to come to this event were the pretty darn good looking pictures of boodle fights shown by a Yelp friend and also more on the Internet. The second would be some good memories from the past where I had the opportunity to taste a few home made Filipino food. The place is clean, staff is very nice and accommodating. Nothing fancy inside but food is good on average at least. The boodle table ingredients were ok, they didn't wow me but at least everything was nicely prepared, tasty and well presented in such an original way. My only gripe was using hands for eating and also lack of space on the table to comfortably put your plate if you decide to have one. But again, this is the traditional way of eating at this kind of table. No biggie but some might not be totally ok with the idea. Overall, to me, it was worth the experience, specially the amazing scene of that all dressed table. One should try it at least once. Also, I'd go back to try their other dishes a la carte style but as per the nice waitress, it's advisable to call ahead to find out the menu du jour, as they change it daily."
/user_details?userid=ao7Jt5QoBWO15lGdZH16Kw,Christina T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My next visit was a boodle fight between friends and... What an adventure! I was a bit uncomfortable eating from leaves and my friends dug in without question asked. We have everything from rice, sausages, tilapia fishes, chicken thigh, Chinese broccoli, veggies, mangoes, strawberries and so much more than I lost count of what we had. It was a feast to behold! We were 7 at that night, it cost 30$ included taxes each for at least 6. When you get to 11, the cost is 25$ included taxes each. We finished the night where everyone was best friends with each other. Something about sharing a table full of food builds a connection.The place is well maintained and clean. The staffs were extremely friendly and accomodating."
/user_details?userid=JKAKAyrsTLGVUag43Hh0yQ,Todd R.,"Raleigh, NC",2 star rating,"I'm new to Montreal and, being Filipino, I'm touring the town for good Filipino restaurants. I had a kare-kare and ginisang mongo combo. The kare was rather 'off'. It's almost like they cut corners to save on cost and maximize profit. The mongo was ok but nothing to write home about.This place is just like most Filipino restaurants: they serve tiny portions measured in cups or bowls. No Filipino consumes that tiny amount. So you finish your meal and you're left wanting. I think the combo is worth closer to $8, not the $10 they charge.I haven't been to the boodle fight so I can't comment on it. Meanwhile my search continues."
/user_details?userid=wAapkfuOdtIMajbFotOY5Q,Marie-Ange A.,"Paris, France",4 star rating,"I am not a Filipina but do business with a large Pinoy community, and I visited many Pinoy restaurants and markets in the Cote ste Catherine area out of curiosity. This place is my favorite.The food is really good, and what I really appreciate is the service. The cashier is such a sweetheart and has great customer service skills, which I found lacking at other establishments...I wish I there were more food options sometimes, just because I want to discover more Pinoy cuisine, but what is there is already super! Also the location is a bit small/narrow and not much in the way of a stylish dining experience... so i order to go"
/user_details?userid=HpzMECWPO4H1fJihiMG1Pg,Lanyi L.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,Came here with my uni's Filipino association so we got the boodle for only $20! The interior: really cozy. The staff: really friendly. The food: a lot. There was a lot of food. I packed a great portion home too. The best part is the red sausage. I also really liked the seasoning of the meats. Mussels and fish were pretty good too! And watch out for the egg--they're the really salty kind. So eat it in small pieces only!! The crunchy mango is also extremely refreshing because the acidity/sourness really cuts through the heaviness of everything else. I think the original price is $35 which is a bit steep but I did enjoy my time here so I may return!

Went here for the boodle fight, first time ever. Highly recommend any Filipino and non Filipino try it out. Fun and unique experience that you can't get anywhere else. The waitress was super nice, the owners had a quick conversation with us, the place was well decorated and very clean. Desserts were also amazing. Will define come back!"
/user_details?userid=50jNz_WHWc9gTgn1DJOsPQ,Kimberly D.,"Joplin, MO",5 star rating,"This shop is very comfortable with excellent food and inexpensive prices. The oxtail sinigang was the best I have ever tasted and the fried red snapper was delicious. I requested toyomansi on the side and was given fresh lemons to squeeze into my soy sauce. The warm atmosphere and great homestyle Filipino cooking impressed me so much that I came back the next day for dinner. Half of the menu had changed, so I got to enjoy different dishes that were equally delicious. I feel so comfortable here that the next time I might eat with my hands."

/user_details?userid=qnZkCGvLz6AB5cQN_J_pUA,Jack D.,"East Oakland, Oakland, CA",4 star rating,"Been meaning to try this place FOREVER, and figured since I was doing my laundry at the Buanderie next door, why not. I'm not much of a pancit guy (I know, BAD Filipino), I always just felt the dish was a little overrated compared to other noodle options out there in the world. But I digress, because here is a decent-looking Filipino joint near my crib and I would like to be taken back home for a little bit. Because I had clothes to tend to, I didn't want to get anything that would take too long, but I did want to try one of their freshly cooked items on the menu du jour (they also have a hot tray section with some ready-to-eat items). Everything looked good (gotta try the bulalo next time), but I went for the sizzling pork sisig. Ten minutes later, a kind gentleman came out with a hot plate and poured the sizzling fatty concoction onto it. Oh man. Pork parts I didn't even care to inquire about, emanating succulent steam into my innocent face. It was good, though I had to pick out the liver parts. Yeah, I suck, but this wasn't the foie gras kinda liver, if you catch my drift. But otherwise, I dug it. Probably would've great with a beer. Do they even serve beer here? Anyways, thumbs up so far and I look forward to my return."
