/user_details?userid=eQ-ukSPHXYvUhYR_wysd8A,Lily F.,"Brookline, MA",5 star rating,"Really gorgeous interior with exposed brick walls, hanging basket chairs, and beautiful plants. It was fancier than I expected though, and also super busy during lunch on a weekday. I ended up ordering something to go - the truffles and caviar dish, which is zucchini spaghetti, oyster mushrooms, parsley, tapioca caviar, and a creamy white sauce. It was really yummy, but I wish it'd had a source of protein, like veggie chicken. Staff was super friendly and my wait time wasn't long for takeout. Apparently they're going to open a location in NYC shortly, which is exciting!"
/user_details?userid=97YdD8tkMkUSvGUw6_u4GQ,Rebecca C.,"Oakland, CA",3 star rating,"3.5 stars. Some solid dishes at this vegetarian restaurant with nice ambience but it wasn't one of our best meals in Montreal. The service was so so, it took almost 20 minutes between the soup and our second courses. And they totally didn't follow our request on bringing things our 1-2 dishes at a time. The pairing of the dishes was a bit bizarre, with poutine and onion rings at the end.MUST HAVE'S:Pea quinoa cake - light and airy full of spring flavors from little peas. Well-executed and delightful.SOLID:gazpacho - typical standard fareCari cacao - rice with curry carrot, squash, kale, and cashew. Comfort food. Good to share. SKIP:Fried onion rings - the onion rings are too thick and big and the the fried dough around the onion rings was not crispy.Vegan poutine - this one was sweet potato fries with soy sauce-based gravy and tofu like imitation cheese on top.  The alteration from the real poutine was disappointing. We wished that we just order sweet potato fries on its own instead.Gnocchi - pesto gnocchi on a bed of arugula. The combination of the ingredients didn't quite make sense. Texture of the gnocchi was quite good but i didn't love the pesto sauce."
/user_details?userid=gEtdFQBqJXj0MgPtANGisw,Mitch J.,"Rockford, IL",5 star rating,"I LOVed this place (sorry, how can you not). I'm normally  not a vegan fan, but you could never tell this place is vegan. All the food is super healthy while still managing to be super tasty. I ordered the gnocchi and it might've been the best gnocchi I've ever had, even compared to others that have had actual cheese. It was incredible. The smoothies were decent, and the coffee offerings were great. The service staff were awesome--super friendly and ready to assist however they could. We never felt rushed, but only felt welcomed. Also, I could go on and on about the atmosphere here. Check out the pictures of the interior and you'll see what I'm talking about. Literally the only downside is the higher prices, but I suppose you get what you pay for. A great spot that we'd come to an embarrassing amount of times if we lived closer."
/user_details?userid=oR5az_eNCnfN7e49H3ONhg,Rebecca H.,"Worcester, MA",5 star rating,"This place was absolutely exceptional. I've heard from Olivia Wilde forever ago how amazing Montréal is for vegan food. I knew that was a priority when we decided to come to MTL for a quick weekend getaway. LOV is a formidable contender on both yelp and Google searches. We made a reservation at the most convenient time available at late notice: 9pm. After a few pregame drinks, we arrived to find a mostly full restaurant, even at that hour on a Saturday night. The menu is outrageous. After some deliberation, we arrived at our selections. I guess it was busy enough that our server kept us waiting to order for a hot minute. Another server either by pure observational skills or bc they overheard me express my impatience, came over to take our orders. For drinks I ordered the lilikoi with tequila, passion fruit, mango, lime, and pistachio. Tina ordered a Moscow mule. Hers was standard, nothing special, but mine was AMAZING. I would've ordered another one if I had the opportunity. For our actual meal, I absolutely had to try vegan poutine. It's listed a side, so don't experience the wave of terror that I went through after I couldn't find it in the appetizers. This frankly was one of the best things I have ever had the pleasure of placing on the tiny tongue protrusions that make up my taste buds. The ""gravy"" is incredibly flavorful, so much so that I scooped up the remnants with my fork afterwards. The cheese curds were not as satisfying as real cheese obviously but did the trick. The fries were crisp. I would eat this way too often if I lived in MTL. We ordered the banh mi burger and the gnocchi di casa for our mains. The burger was INCREDIBLE. The tofu was thick, breaded and flanked with slaw. An explosion of flavors. The gnocchi was tasty as well. I detected a slightly nutty tone. They were engulfed in a delicious pesto sauce and dusted with parm. This place has amazing food. The service leaves something to be desired but the food is so fantastic it makes up for the service issues."
/user_details?userid=EO49noCE6deJZXcf1Zrd0A,Chanhong L.,"Alexandria, VA",5 star rating,"Of course we chose to eat at LOV during the one meal they don't serve poutine-weekend brunch! I didn't find this out until later. This was very unfortunate because I was very much looking forward to trying vegan poutine and because our back up plans failed until the end of our trip. Nevertheless, my boyfriend and I ended up sharing a very delicious apple french toast at LOV to jumpstart our Montreal vacation. Unfortunately because we were new to Canada, we hadn't fully grasped the USD to CAD rate. As a result, we thought our tiny french toast was a little pricey, but it only ended up being 12 USD with tip and tax, so we totally could've tried another delicious entree! With this knowledge in hand, I will most definitely be returning to LOV the next chance I have. With so many locations, including this one conveniently located in Downtown Montreal, it'll be hard not to!P.S. The menus are now bilingual with French on one side and English on the other."

/user_details?userid=thdKkC601infVVh7XM0qDg,Neda I.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Loved the food and the service. The staff was very attentive to my needs and the food was delicious. I got the caesar salad and the zoodles. The atmosphere was very pleasant (not ideal if you're looking for a silent setting).For anyone from Toronto, the vibe is similar to Fresh restaurants (more specifically the location on Front street).Would definitely go again and recommend to any friend visiting Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=zYPvMZS4XwEL0AH-MuSfow,Blake A.,"Honolulu, HI",5 star rating,"Walked in on a Friday night with no reservation with a party of 3. Only later did I realize it was one of top restaurants in Montreal...boy did I get LUCKY! Also, I was terribly underdressed and I apologize for that. Outside of the restaurant - gorgeous. Inside of the restaurant - gorgeous; looks like the set of a romantic Shakespeare novel. Food - fantastic. If vegetarian food was this good everywhere, all the time, I would be a devout vegetarian. I would convert and never look back. Everything tastes fresh, good good flavoring, the wait staff was amazingly helpful and friendly. Not to mention they spared me any embarrassing remarks for wearing  junky clothes to their posh restaurant. This is definitely one of the best places I've eaten. 1000% recommend."
/user_details?userid=oCKtbgKBtYb44q1zqqefNA,Rosalie C.,"Milwaukee, WI",4 star rating,"#veganWe booked here in advance for dinner and it was a good thing. Friday evening and the place was packed with a line at the door! I LOVE the decor. It is all white with old wood, old windows, baskets, yellow lights... I mean it was just stunning inside. Felt so fancy even though I was just in sweatpants. The staff is amazing. So kind and so attentive. They seat you, they clear your plates, they even unnecessarily cleared and replaced our cutlery once. It was quite an experience. A++I got an alcoholic chai/chocolatey tea. It was okay. We split poutine and kimichi (?). The rice ball and grilled cauliflower was decent, sauce could have used a touch more flavor. The poutine was ok. I had had some better poutine earlier in the day but overall I would get it again. I got the cheeseburger. This was also good. I think it may have been a bean burger, very dense... but a lovely fluffy bun and melted cheese and sauce. Montreal seems to know how to do burger sauce well. The cesar salad was awesome, finally some vegan croutons. For dessert I tried the chocolate icecream, which is mostly a coconut base and yet doesnt taste like coconuts so yay! I tried the creme brule, I honestly do not think Ive ever had it before, even nonvegan- YUM. Way yum. I took a bite of brownie, didnt love it. I took a bite of cheesecake and didnt like that. Overall I would say the food is in general OKAY. The decor and staff were great!! The price is.... very very expensive. Appetizers, meals, desserts, and a drink each for 3 people was $200. Perhaps the most expensive bill Ive paid. I will not do that again anytime soon but I am very happy with the experience and would encourage you to go!!"

I was so surprised that there are so many vegan restaurants in Montreal, AND they are good! It's hard to get in this restaurant without reservation. I'd definitely suggest anyone who wants to try it out to spend a few minutes to make a reservation online. The staff is very friendly attentive and sweet. We had risottos, lasagna, truffles caviar mushroom, and poutine. Every single dish was delicious and surprising, especially the seasoning on the crispy oyster mushroom was a must try! Highly highly recommend this place to everyone who is in town. Give it a try, even if you're not vegan, you'll love it!"
/user_details?userid=ys3IJ6orjC5_gaScXlBKxA,Amanda A.,"Oakville, Canada",5 star rating,"Had to try this place out because I saw it on Buzzfeed's Worth It. Hence, why we ordered the kimchi fries to start, which were excellent. Perfectly balanced: not too spicy and not soggy from too much sauce. For our main course, we ordered the vegan lasagna which was amazing and paired with a surprisingly delicious Cesar salad. The whole atmosphere was also beautiful, great for taking Instagram pictures!"
/user_details?userid=RwQUv7Cn61gTkPXcytSrSQ,Amy Yu T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been here twice and my experience was quite consistent. Ambiance: this is why I'm giving the restaurant a 4 star. The decorations were quite charming and the way everything is placed was lovely. There were a row of swings, a fresh flower on each table and the general atmosphere was pleasant. I would come here from celebratory occasions to a casual meet up with a friend. The service was polite and attentive. Food: this aspect of the restaurant irks me a little. I ordered sweet potato friends and they came out covered in salt, which overpowered the sweetness of the sweet potato. My risotto came out a bit cold and it was good, but isn't on par with other risottos that I've had. It lacked flavour and creaminess. Overall, good experience, especially for vegetarians/vegans."
/user_details?userid=x9f5mbYpgdssyHaDI6jnvQ,Eman S.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,LOVed LOV;) I mean if you're in the area of Old Montreal definitely stop in here for some salads and drinks or vegetarian /vegan options and cocktails after a day of walking around....you will LOV LOV it;) Great yummy fresh food & Bali vibes inside......
/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Nothing special. I got the veggie LOV burger. It was around $14, pretty reasonable until I found out that it did not come with some sort of side dish such as french fries. Although the LOV special sauce was tasty, the burger lacked flavour.If you do plan on going to this restaurant for its unique meal preference (vegan), I would recommend getting a side dish to accompany any main meal as they are not filling enough (the waitress had to even suggest to almost everyone that the meal they respectively chose would most likely not be enough food). The atmosphere is quite nice, beautiful area in old Montreal. The restaurant has a ""Cali beach side"" feel to it which is nice."
/user_details?userid=VClRFo4FaJKhGIyTQcoHVg,Urvi T.,"Jersey City, NJ",5 star rating,"Walking into LOV there was only one thing going through my mind: Hunger. My companions and I were extremely famished and were looking for a place that can satisfy our vegan needs. We were immediately greeted by a light feel in the air, one that reminds you of grandma's cooking, and following that sensory revelation was a kind waiter who gave us options as to our seating preferences, contrary to the behavior of many in the industry. At the table we were greeted by a simplistic and homey ambiance, one with a hint of elegance to exemplify that you've arrived at a place of class. And the classy qualities did not end with just appearances, the food followed up and satisfied. With a variety of options and each dish vying for the best on a list of many, my group and I were surprised and delighted by each subsequent plate, and constantly asking for seconds. The taste was amazing, although that does not truly do it justice. If I had to describe it properly, all I can say is this: you must try it yourself. Our favorite dish by far was the Poke bowl, which blended flavors of seaweed, wood mushrooms, and mango to entice my taste buds for another bite. All in all, the ambiance at LOV was great, the service at LOV was great, and the food at LOV was great."
/user_details?userid=2mCtmrp5MFgMoZNDp2XTnw,Cat Y.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"This was my first time in Montreal and every one was telling me to try the city's poutine. However, I'm allergic to dairy so I was so excited when my cousin showed me this vegan restaurant. When we stepped in, the decor immediately attracted me. It has cute swing seats in the back and hanging plants at the front windows. I ordered the almond milk cappuccino, cream cheese bagel, gnocchi, big lov burger, curry, and of course the poutine. The cappuccino was pretty good. There was nothing special to the curry. My favorite was the big lov burger and the poutine. The big lov burger is probably the best vegan burger I've ever tasted. Usually the patty gets pretty dry but this burger was very juicy. My cousin said the poutine does not taste the same as real poutine but it still tasted good! Just different. For dessert, I ordered the blueberry cheesecake and that was amazing! Like the poutine, it doesn't taste exactly like real cheesecake but it is very good. The consistency is the same! I really enjoyed it. I would definitely come back again if I visit Montreal! I think this restaurant is a must if you eat vegan food or want to try vegan food!"
/user_details?userid=F3QKNUhTgNh6m0J9thujtg,Natalie W.,"East Side, Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"This restaurant is so beautiful on the inside. The decor is bright and lovely. They have wicker baskets as the light fixtures, a few hanging seats, and plant wallpaper. The tables looked like marble on the tops, and overall had a really nice aesthetic. All the food we tried was tasty and plated nicely. The mac and cheese was creamy, even thought there wasn't any dairy. The dumplings were crisp on the outside and had a nice kick from the almond butter kimchi sauce. The hero 2.0 bowl was flavourful and a little bit spicy. I liked how each ingredient was cooked and not soaked in all the sauce. The bok choy was a bit crispy for the leaf part, and the broccoli still had some crunch. When we walked by another table, the onion rings looked good so we had one order. It was massive. It came with 5 huge onion rings. They were super crispy, but my mom found it to not be that flavourful on its own. Overall, this was a great place to get some vegan food.  The atmosphere was lovely and service was great. I'd definitely come back and would love for them to open up in Vancouver!"
/user_details?userid=HUkLmF3TUDZQRw7kfw0Pxw,Kartik G.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,My go to vegan restaurant in Montreal. Heard them from one of the YouTube channels that I follow and wanted to give a try. Service was excellent and the food was good as well.
/user_details?userid=_MeA1exOjobDz9J6cGaglA,Nick G.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I visited this restaurant as an inspiration from the show Worth It and I have to say it was worth it. Their fries were so light and different from traditional fries I've eaten, which mixed in very well with the sesame sauce and kimchi. I can see why this restaurant was a Worth It winner and I would recommend this place to anyone for vegan food. I also tried their house burger on the side and it is a really close competitor to the Beyond Meat burger (which they also serve here). I'd say this burger is easily second place to the Beyond Meat one I've had at A&W.In the back, they have some hammock seats you can sit in to relax, although I saw no one sitting on them at the time. The balance of greenery with the white space was very well done."
/user_details?userid=wmXYo8UbPon5woxlOvVptA,Vanessa H.,"West Windsor Township, NJ",4 star rating,"Beautiful beautiful restaurant. It is so aesthetically pleasing as soon as you step in. The service is incredible too. Our waiter was all smiles and extremely friendly. I ordered a Lov mimosa and my SO ordered a beer. For appetizers, we ordered the dumplings. They were completely fried and stuffed with mushrooms and veggies. They were crisp and soft on the inside. The wrapper wasn't the same traditional dumpling wrapper. It fried differently. For mains, We ordered their version of Pho and the truffle and caviar. The pho was so different and surprising. I really enjoyed it. It packed a ton of flavor and didn't need the additional topping a normal pho needs. I was so surprised. The truffle and caviar was just as interesting. They used zucchini noodles and tapioca for the caviar. The truffle flavor was definitely there.Overall, I really appreciate how creative their menu is. Everything is pretty delicious, just a tad pricey. If you're vegan/veg check it out."
/user_details?userid=5QrlMMzUq_RoUlEyH2zcig,Judy K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Haven't tried a lot on the menu; however the avocado toast with poached egg was really good; easy to cut, nice taste, could of used a little more avocado spread. Beautiful presentation. Add the organic hot sauce they have to it. The sauce isn't hot by any means but has wonderful flavour.The beet salad is really good, could do with a bit more beets. However very tasty none the less and a good sharing size. The lack of beets was probably due to the time we ordered the salad at. *see service comment as to why.The service was ok. It took a bit to get our waitress to stop rushing away from us so we could order. We placed our drink orders and before I could order our enters she ran off, essentially while I was mid sentence. we ordered our entrees  and when we went to order our main courses she told us the kitchen was closed and we could order form the snack menu. She never told us the kitchen was closing and when we asked what time the kitchen closed at she said 3:00... when we asked it was 3:02!!!!!! It was a bit of an issue to have her at least ask the kitchen if they'd make our salad we wanted. She reluctantly asked and they graciously said yes. (YAAAY for awesome kitchen staff!) she gave my friend a lot of attitude about us missing the last call for the kitchen... all this could of been avoided had she just mentioned the last call for the kitchen was at 3:00.Beside that little incident, she was pleasant but not really attentive and the restaurant wasn't overly busy so I don't see a reason for the lack of attention.The decor of the restaurant is absolutely lovely. It's all white brick with pretty plants and it's very bright.Would defiantly visit again; I can't wait to try more of the yummy looking food from the menu and I'm hoping the service is a bit better next time.  Would definitely recommend!"
/user_details?userid=wWHeaOS28fnCnFN1Pmo3xg,Shaan A.,"Thornhill, Vaughan, Canada",4 star rating,"LOV is a really great spot for dinner. I made reservations but needed to push back the time slightly, and they happily accommodated my request. I arrived to the bustling, fragrant atmosphere and was greeted immediately by the friendly staff. I saw LOV on an episode of Buzzfeed's 'Worth It', and I was so excited to try. I highly recommend getting reservations as it does get quite busy. The menu is not too large, but every dish is thoughtful and seems super tasty. Every dish here is vegetarian and some are vegan too - honestly the perfect type of restaurant for me. The decor is very nice - complete with aesthetic marble tables - though the indoor lighting is not the most ideal for food photography. They do have a patio which I would be open to trying in the future -  but it was a cooler night when I went. It was really hard to make choices, but I finally decided on kimchi fries as an appetizer and gnocchi as my main. The wait time for food preparation is a bit longer, but the restaurant was quite busy. The kimchi fries came out piping hot and crispy - but really what made the fries amazing was the aioli - it was made with a soy emulsion and tasted amazing. The gnocchi is also one of their most popular dishes and I have no regrets - it was satisfying as the filling wa sweet potato, yet light as it was made with a pesto sauce. The price point was also quite reasonable! I paid $30 after tax for 2 items. The atmosphere was a bit loud as the restaurant was narrow, but honestly LOV was great. Definitely a place to try in Montreal."

But as someone who just likes food full-stop, I appreciate deliciousness in all forms and Restaurant LOV delivers in spades, all dairy and meat free!First off--holy moly is the space beautiful. It's truly stunning in there. It's bright and calming, with lovely foliage set against off-white walls. Lovely as can be!Second--the food is quite tasty. The kombucha onion rings might have been some of the best onion rings I've ever had. They weren't heavy or overly greasy in the slightest and had a delicious crunch and flavor. The dipping sauce was a little bland but the rings were flavorful enough on their own that I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. But something extra to give it some oomph (siracha? garlic? herbs?) might really take it to the next level. I also had the LOV burger, which was also tasty. The patty was not dry in the slightest (which can happen with veggie burgers) and had great flavors/spices mixed in. It came with a vegan cheese, onion, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles and a special sauce. Simple but quite good.Service was a little on the slower side but my colleague and I were busy chatting and catching up so it was nice to not feel rushed. Although if you're in a hurry you might want to tell them up front."

We came here for dinner on a weeknight and I was pretty floored at the gorgeousness of the decor here - it's so beautifully decorated/furnished that it makes you want to instantly eat here (read: IG-worthy place!) We ordered the soup, jack fruit fritters, and LOV poutine to start (the fritters were delicious!). We then had the risotto, pesto gnocchi, and coconut curry as our mains. Every dish was artfully presented and delicious. The gnocchi and curry surpassed the risotto but all the dishes were yummy. The prices are a touch high but worth it given the ambiance, service and food. Keep in mind that the portions are very generous so if you want dessert, skip the appetizer! Would definitely recommend LOV, and am looking forward to my next visit! definitely best vegan place in town!"

Each item was absolutely delicious! We are not vegan but we do enjoy having meatless meals. Each dish was packed with flavour and did not disappoint. We also got the spritz les iles and the mojito kombucha. Drinks were amazing as well. Service was also excellent. We would come back 100%!"
/user_details?userid=RmnLFQF7c-kbp4qQ8mIUgg,Gloria V.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,Came here for brunch. You should definitely have a reservation already. I came in with no reservation and had to wait around 30 minutes. I was a little excited to try this place since I've seen it before on a Buzzfeed video.But the brunch menu was not very awe inspiring. It was pretty much limited and on the pricier end. I've seen their dinner menu and I feel like if I went during then I would've enjoyed my meal more.I just don't think spending $15 on 3 eggs and a bit of salad was worth it. The meal was good but I'm not really one who enjoys brunch the most. I do think the inside was beautiful and the little accessories on the tables is worth going if you're into chatting and a nice decor. But I'm just a simple student who likes some cheap and fast grub haha so this probably isn't the place for me The service was kinda of weird. It took awhile to take our order but it was busy during then so understandable but when were finished our meals it took a very long time to get our bills when the place was basically empty. I probably won't come here again just because it's not my style
/user_details?userid=pbkOdzQoenwr9ByvE4kPqQ,Nora S.,"Fort Lee, NJ",3 star rating,Very cute decor and atmosphere. Food was average though. Ordered kale Mac and cheese which had nice cheese flavor but wish there was more kale in it. Vegan poutine was not that great...the gravy was okay but the 'cheese' tasted very strange. Asian salad was refreshing and the best part of my meal. My husband had the curry which I tried but wasn't impressed. Definitely needed more spices and flavor.

The decor and the staff are all beautiful, as is the food. It's your standard ""fancy vegan restaurant"" story. Inventive takes on dishes, tasty food, but nothing mind blowing. It was also pretty pricey. The experience is great, but if you're all about taste and texture, it's a bit lacking."
/user_details?userid=1hWFjAmoW3FZ0lmROH5mIA,Vivian W.,"Sydney, Australia",4 star rating,"Look, this place has it's highs and lows so it honestly depends on what you're looking for. The whole EXPERIENCE is lovely, the design of the place is lovely- high ceilings, twinkling lights, white marbling, decorated with pot plants. The service is lovely and we were treated very well! The food on the other hand, lacks in comparison to everything else. Gnocchi was a bit dry but the pesto sauce was lovely. Poutine a little salty but the rest tasted nice. Mac and cheese was the same where it was a bit overly salted, the taste of it was average. I enjoyed the carrot and sweet potato soup of the day though! The dish presentations are very up to standard, and served very professionally which I really like. Creme brulee on the other hand was delicious!! Super creamy, for a veganised dessert it did very well. If you're looking for an overall experience, I enjoy Lov as a nice place for the space, vibe and food as a whole. So essentially my 4 star is due to this whole experience, and for their decor and ambiance. Food isn't outstanding but I appreciate how many vegan options there are! Its a good place to try."

Even the bill presentation is cute. I loved the food and would definitely go back. The poutine I found on the saltier side. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the mac and cheese, avocado toast and gnocchi. I haven't been to the downtown location but do plan to go to compare the two places."

Right... on with the review!This place is trendy. I've seen countless Instagram pictures of their beautiful restaurant so I knew I was bound to visit at some point. First tip: Reserve a table!The place is packed ! I went on a rainy Friday night but it was still full. We initially got seated at the bar while we waited for a table and it's so cramped there. We got changed to the high tables near the door which was better but not the best seats in the house. We ordered the kale mac and cheese, Buddha burger, Poutine, and the onion rings.  The food is AMAZING. The mac and cheese was especially remarquable. I'm a tough judge when it comes to mac and cheese but this one is one of my favourites. I can't even describe how good it was. The onion rings were really crispy which is my favourite kind. The Poutine was perfectly seasoned and warm. Super delectable. I can't comment on the burger because I only got a small bite but Adam said he got ""food sweats and that only happens when I eat good food"". If adam gets food sweats over vegan food, you know it's worth it. It makes him temporarily forget he's eating something meat free. The service is good. Given the demand it's ok if they forget certain things (water,napkins). I think they are very friendly though. They welcome you with a smile and serve you he best they can and don't seem overworked or unhappy. They also make recommendations and give you some tidbits of information about the restaurant and the kitchen which is fun!"

Ambiance and service are excellent, and the menu has a lot of creative options beyond normal vegan fair. We got the vegan poutine, and my non-vegan boyfriend said it was better than any poutine he had ever had. I also got the French onion soup, but it didn't live up to my expectations and was on the bland side. The tempeh chili he ordered was tasty and the perfect amount of food, but it was also under seasoned and could have used a little more spice. We were still a little hungry at the end of the meal, so we ordered vegan creme brûlée, which was delicious. Good wine list as well!"

I finally decided on sharing Kale mac n cheese, stuffed mushrooms and gnocchi. It was all delicious however i would not take the mac n cheese again it was good but not spectacular. The service and atmosphere was great and i cannot wait to go back!!!The first time a month ago was so good i decided to bring a friend to try it out again. I was tempted to have the stuffed mushroom again but resisted and tried the Quinoa Fritter which were amazing, followed by the Squash feta bowl another amazing selection and i finished it off with a divine coconut crème brûlée!!!! Amazing supper in great company, wonderful service, cannot wait to return to try something new"
/user_details?userid=GnJ2w63izmrICmt1wNCGOA,Laurence V.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"I had been to LOV several times, and it was always the McGill location. I randomly went there because many restaurants in the neighbourhood were closed during the holidays. I went during lunch time, so it got crowded pretty quickly but I was seated right away without any reservations. I was catching up with an old friend so we were talking a lot, but our waiter was very patient with us and gave us time to check the menu. We decided to share the buffalo Brussels sprouts which was awesome and so tasteful! I had a dish called truffle and caviar, which were good but not my favourite. It got cold really easily (and I wasn't eating slowly) so it became unpleasant to eat at the end. Because we knew someone that worked in the kitchen, we were offered an assortment of desserts which was an amazing surprise. The cakes themselves were not the best, but the homemade ice creams (matcha and apple I believe) were delicious. I am not vegan but I do enjoy vegan food, and I think LOV is a great establishment for those with a vegan diet and those who just like to eat! There are many options on the menu and most of the time, you can't even tell there's no meat or dairy. The decor of the restaurant is breathtaking and very Instagram vibe. I had to remove a star however because the price is a bit hefty and the portions are not that big, but taking in consideration that it is located in the old port, it's not that bad. Overall, I would definitely come back and perhaps try their other locations (which is very convenient considering I'm not always in the old port) and I would hope to find more items on the menu that I fall in love with, as it hadn't happened yet."

I wanted to try out this place but definitely wouldn't go again. The burger was 'bbq' flavoured but it tasted like tomatoes and sugar. The ketchup was watered down.The aioli was just mayo. The fries were decent and added flavour to the burger. I've had jack fruit growing up and this was just not good. Little bit of an insult to good food. Why it is so popular, I'll never know. If you want a good salad, walk down to Bistro Les Soeurs Grises about 7min away and that yourself."

The place was packed as was the terrace so you definitely need reservations! The venue itself, white wash stone walls, hanging light fixtures and tropical touches is pretty and charming. We sat at the bar which was comfortable but tight if you intend to eat many small plates at once.Having been vegan for many years, my expectations were high! I can say that the food overall was good. The dishes are creative and refined compared to other vegan venues in Montreal. We ordered the kimchi fries, kale mac n' cheese, eggplants, and the Big LOV burger; the mac n cheese was a little dry but the rest was tasty and filling! The wine list is mostly composed of natural wines and they offer a good selection; it took us three tries before finding a good white wine and even at that, we were not convinced. Stick to the cocktails which are light and refreshing. The service was a little slow at first as it took a while to take our drink order but flowed better after our food order probably cause it had quieted down; the food literally came out in less than 10 minutes!!Overall, it was a good experience but would mostly go back for a cocktail and burger if I were in this touristy area."
/user_details?userid=0G-QF457q_0Z_jKqh6xWiA,Joi B.,"Hudson Valley, NY",4 star rating,"Oh lovely lovely lov! How much do I lov thee? Counting the ways here first:-utterly decadent avocado/mushroom carpaccio with savory crisps. There's a hint of truffle in there as well that is not overbearing. Although we were sharing this (my friend had the mac and cheese which I tasted but didn't lov, so I pretty much kept this plate in front of me the entire time), I might have, no I definitely did, eat the entire thing! Divine! -Smoked. Beet. Sandwich. With. Pickles. WHAT? I thought I had given up beets forever after ODing on them on a juice fast but this sandwich is utterly incredible. I took a bite, intending only to taste it, but I ended up smashing in an entire half despite myself. Glad my friend could convince me to take a bite. What I loved was the smoky flavor mixed with the tang of pickles. The beets are thinly sliced and piled on and it was a pure lov affair for me.-crispy giant juicy onion rings. Need I say more? OK, one thing: the creamy dipping sauce could use a kick... I'm a hot sauce fanatic and don't expect others to be, but say a smoky chipotle pepper might be added to spice things up?! Fireworks might ensue?!As I mention above, not as much lov for the mac and cheese, but I'm a weirdo who doesn't lov mac and cheese at all. Lov's is good, don't get me wrong! The crispy kale makes it interesting & at an edible level so that it's not pure starch and creaminess (not the fault of any restaurant, this is purely a texture thing that doesn't appeal to yours, truly). So while I wouldn't order it again, I absolutely recommend it for mac and cheese lovahs! No lov for the risotto. Sadly a bit bland and without much bite to the arborio. The salt I added still didn't help, but I'm not gonna dwell on the negative and leave it at that. I so cannot wait to return to Montréal and get back to the Lov affair. It makes my little vegan heart so happy."

To add to the problem, there was one of those ""please get in touch with us to discuss your recent experience"" replies, which I responded to, but did not get a reply.  Note to management: if you reach out to a customer, you should reply to them if they take the time to get back to you.  All that to say I wanted to give this place another chance, but figured we'd try their other location in hopes of better service.  Alas no.  It took 30 minutes for someone to take our order.  The food did arrive in a reasonable amount of time but some of it (the soup, the onion rings and the quinoa fritters) were lukewarm.  We had to chase someone down for the cheque and our original server seemed surprised that we had paid and were leaving. The decor, as others have mentioned, is lovely, and the food is quite good.  We tried the soup of the day, the quinoa fritters, beet salad, big hero and the lov burger.  Everyone liked their food except my daughter who had the big hero and said it was ""weird"".  No other details were forthcoming.I'd probably only come back here if I was eating with a vegan or vegetarian guest, because their menu is definitely a step up of those options from most other restaurants.  The slow and indifferent service would keep me away otherwise."

There were four of us, and we got appetizers, entries, and two deserts, so we got to sample probably half of the menu. What sets this place apart are strong flavors - they are not afraid of seasonings and a little spice, which makes food taste delicious. We tried two different veggie burgers and both were great - not just patties, but also sauces, bread, and condiments were just right. Tacos were very tasty, and the cold watermelon-based soup of the day was amazing. The service was very good as well - friendly, extremely attentive, but not overbearing. Our waitress knew a lot about their dishes and recommended a couple of things that we really liked after taking her time to ask what we like. I think this is also a great place to bring non-vegetarian friends, if you're a strict vegetarian. Even though there is no meat or animal products, they more than make up for that in flavor and creativity!"

The decor is very beautiful. its light, airy and elegant , they even have some tables at the back that have fancy wicker swings as seats. Really cute place for a casual date or to catchup with a friend in a nice atmosphere. Either way, definitely make reservations , since this place is pretty popular. We ordered some drinks and light nibbles. The Prosecco was nice and refreshing and a good sized portion , the drinks are reasonably priced , in the sense that they are no more expensive than alot of other places in the area. The Poutine was good , I was impressed with how flavourful the gravy was - however it said it was sweet potato poutine which it was not, the fries were decent. We also had the tempeh tacos , they were okay , nice texture and fresh ingredients but nothing out of the ordinary. The pricing for what you get is a little steep (not the biggest portions and the food wasn't overly impressive or standout to merit it). The staff was friendly and efficient so no complaints there. This was not a bad experience but not sure it would be my first choice. I would suggest to try this place more for a drink and some snacks as well as for some nice Instagram photos as opposed to a full meal."

As it's been said before, the space is stunning (I'd argue the cutest restaurant I've been to in a while.) The food, by Montreal standards, was some of the best vegan fare I've had in a long time. We enjoyed the kale mac n' cheese, the nougatella tartine, and the poutine. I really hate daiya cheese so I really appreciate that these guys make all of their own plant-based cheeses. Needless to say, there wasn't a lousy plate in the lot. We also walked away only paying $14 each!As other folks have noticed, the service is pretty slow. I'd argue though that if you're not in a rush it's worth the wait. Honestly, it's the only thing distinguishing this as a four star as opposed to a five star.Their brunch menu starts at the end of the month and I can't wait!"

It's a zucchini spaghetti with a type of fungus called pleurote and tapioca caviar (ha) in a truffle sauce. It had a unique taste; I didn't really like it, I didn't like the after taste. My girlfriend loved it.She ordered the pok'ai: a type of salad with watermelon, cucumber, avocados, and edamame in a type of ginger sauce. I loved her dish.

/user_details?userid=-MERKiI7sX6s9_ovlUxIXg,Matt R.,"Irvine, CA",3 star rating,I was in town the other week and decided to come by twice. The first time I came by the burgers were good. I liked the tofu ban mi burger more than the veggie patty taste wise. My wife also wanted the onion rings and fries so we got them. The onion rings had little to no taste and were not salted much. For a fried food...I think they need to be salted. The sauce that came with the onion rings also had little to no taste.We came back again a few days later as we are vegetarian. This time we got the lasagna and the pot pie and decided to give the onion rings another chance.The lasagna had no noodles or at least felt like there were none. It seemed more like a tomato casserole than lasagna...we opted for the ricotta cheese on top for extra...I could only really taste tomato and the dish was under salted.The pot pie came out and looked great. Then we tried it and the taste was just flat. No taste really at all. The jack fruit inside tasted like it was just dropped in the dish without any flavor added. We cook jack fruit at home from time to time and it's a great option to substitute for meat if flavored correctly. Unfortunately this felt like the jack fruit went straight from the can or jar and into the pot pie...no bueno.The onion rings again were not salted and neither was the sauce that came with them. For the prices of the food here and the reviews Lov gets we expected a bit more. Especially since we know there's good vegan food to be had if done correctly. The staff was very nice and accommodating and even removed the dishes off our bill once we let them know. I'm writing this review in hopes they can improve as I think they can.
/user_details?userid=U28XN1IGtjsQL2DUxr7FKg,Be F.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"We tried the bahn mi burger, which both servers recommended, and found it only OK. The large block of tofu makes it just so bland despite the crispy coating. We also had the vegetable soup, which was thin and boring, and another dish I can't even remember. The standout flavour was the aioli they served with the fries, it was spectacular. Overall things tasted fine and it's food you feel great after eating, but clearly this wasn't a stunning meal. Oh right - it was the chili. And we ended with the creme brûlée, which was a decent replica with only a hint of a soy-type taste, but not nearly the right ratio of creme to crust - I make one that's much better at home. Portions are very small and service was only passable. It was the only time on our trip so far that we experienced a server who seemed irritated that we aren't fluent in French."

/user_details?userid=ofta5HrHCmHSN0WvC4zR0w,Claire L.,"New Haven, CT",5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I came here last night, after I found this place on Yelp. We were intrigued by the ""Local, Organic, Vegan"" concept, and thought this would be an excellent place to detox after a few greasy and carb-y meals in Montreal! As soon as we stepped foot in the interior of the restaurant, the atmosphere and decor nearly took my breath away - I thought I was transported to a rustic, but chic gourmet boutique cafe in Los Angeles or Paris! LOV during dinnertime is dimly lit, perfect for an intimate date night or a low-key birthday celebration at night. Although we didn't have reservations, we were lucky enough to score a two-person table in a relatively quiet nook of the restaurant. Service was so kind and attentive. One waiter seated us, and another introduced the menu to us. For a starter, we ordered a Pho to share. The Pho soup consists of lemongrass broth, bok choy, konjac noodle, fried tofu, bean sprouts, Thai basil, enoki mushrooms, and lime. It was so, so tasty and innovative - unlike any pho dish I have ever tried. As opposed to a massive, hulking bowl of pho, their pho is served in a dainty bowl with the ingredients arranged artfully on top. The konjac noodles were an interesting consistency, kind of bouncy but with good texture. The fried tofu was also well seasoned, and an excellent complement to the fresh veggies, like the crispy bok choy. The highlight of the pho soup was obviously the broth. The lemongrass flavor absolutely shines through, and was the perfect antidote to a freezing and snowy winter night! For entrees, I ordered the Power Bowl, which consists of mesclun / arugula, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, pickled radish, corn, carrot, quinoa, lentil, sprouted mung beans, a specialty LOV crunch mix and avocado / basil green goddess dressing. Simply put, this was probably one of the best, most colorful salads I've had in my life. So filling and delicious. All the different ingredients added a variety of textures in the salad, so it didn't feel like I was just eating a plate of greens. The pickled radish in particular added a wonderful tangy crunch to the mix. The LOV crunch mix consisted of sunflower seeds, raisins, and corn nuts - an unusual combo but very tasty when mixed in with the salad. My boyfriend ordered the Banh Mi burger, which he greatly enjoyed as well. He wished the sriracha aioli were a little spicier, but the concept of the restaurant is showcasing the flavor of the veggies and ingredients, as opposed to overpowering them with seasoning! My main takeaway is that I would absolutely come here again and would recommend LOV to anyone, vegan or otherwise. LOV knows just how to bring the freshness and essence of the vegetables to center stage. The ingredients are not hiding behind a veil of heavy seasoning or fried oil, but rather are enhanced by its other companions on the dish. Everything we tried was fresh, clean, delicious, and reasonably priced. Coupled with great service, LOV is a 5-star experience!"

Upon entering, the hostess told us that the many empty tables were all reserved. She sat us at a high shared bar table, which was fine. We ordered our drinks, a lemonade and a matcha latte with oat milk. My companion's lemonade was good, but a little hard to sip with all the stray pieces of rosemary. The latte was bitter, even with two packs of cane sugar, and full of matcha sludge at the bottom.As an appetizer, we ordered jackfruit croquettes and were not provided sharing plates, forcing us to eat out of the same cumbersome bowl. The croquettes were fine, but the topping (""a corn salsa"" w/ random baby spinach) was difficult to consume.My friend ordered the mushroom risotto; I had the chili. The risotto ""tasted like mushroom soup from a can, the peas were undercooked, the only visible ""mushroom"" tasted stale. It was awful."" I had the chili which was cold and utterly flavorless, without even a dash of salt, nor was any salt or pepper available on the table. The beans in the chili were undercooked. It was served with corn chips, which was kind of them, as they didn't give me a spoon.Some of the other food looked and smelled really good, and perhaps we picked the wrong dishes or got unlucky, but overall this was a bad experience. Ambiance-wise, the decor was a bit hackneyed - Edison bulbs & weird hanging chairs. The music would have been appropriate for watching my father wash his Camaro in the summer of 1988 - e.g. ""Don't Fear The Reaper"".The food was insanely overpriced. Two entrees of tasteless vegetarian slop, a passable appetizer, and two non-alcoholic drinks were $70!"

One star off for that.We took the ""classic LOV burger"" and it was okay. Tasted fine, but the black bean patty was not the best I have ever had (Copper Branch burgers are better)...  The sauce, the bread, it was all fine because it tasted like a burger with the sauce, but the patty was not very meat-y in flavour (I am not a vegan or vegetarian by the way).The Thai curry was good, but needed far more rice and sauce, and it lacked a home-yness to it that I associate with curries and rice. It felt a little flat.Portions were okay. With the appetizer and meal, it was okay, but I wasn't thinking: Wow I am full! .. which is fine, because it is never good to eat too much.Still, my favourite place to eat vegan / vegetarian is Copper Branch"
/user_details?userid=aPTxdV3iOlOPs9usJ1yE_w,Kait M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Let's preface this review by saying that I've been to the de la Montagne LOV a handful of times since it opened earlier this summer and I absolutely adore it. I was in the Old Port with relatives yesterday and figured it was about time I try the original location.I have to admit, after having consecutive excellent experiences on de la Montagne, I had high hopes for the McGill location and, I have to say, I was slightly let down. The service was only OK and the presentation seemed to be off.My ""Big LOV"" burger was brought out much later than the rest of my party's food. The bun was soggy and the contents were lopsided and falling out. The flavour was there, I will give them that, but the presentation and soggy bun were a big disappointment. Maybe they were having an off night? Either way, a $13 burger (with no sides) should not be soggy and falling apart!Now that the negative is out of the way, here's why you still absolutely have to try LOV (maybe just skip the ""Big LOV"" burger). I've brought a handful of omnivore friends here and they've all been amazed by how delicious their plates are. Not to mention the cheesecake! Seriously. It doesn't matter how full we are from dinner, I always order a cheesecake for the table to share just to show them how delicious cashews can be! If I didn't tell them upfront that it's vegan, they would have no idea. It's really that good.I really love LOV -- you'll find me there often. As a strict vegetarian with a handful of food intolerances, it's rare to find a place that is accommodating *and* truly delicious. Plant-based restaurants are far too often dismissed as flavourless hippie joints and LOV is proof that vegan doesn't have to be bland or cookie cutter. Thank you, Stéphanie Audet!"

I had the hero 2.0 with egg noodles, eggplant, broccoli, tempeh, bok choy and kimchi. The dish was sweet, tangy and spicy but I couldn't eat the kimchi (I don't think they've gotten their kimchi quite right).

The food overall was cosy and tasty, really successfully doing filling, yummy, vegan comfort food.  We tried the kale mac n' cheese, the mushroom carpaccio with truffles, the onion rings, the smoked beet sandwich, and the risotto. The risotto was the only miss, bland with a gluey texture. Skip it. But everything else was amazing. It's so fun to eat indulgent food like mac n' cheese or a twist on a smoked meat sandwich and not feel sad about animals, and also not feel hungry after. I just finished the takeout container of the onion rings and the panko kept them crispy and not too crazy greasy. There are lots of cocktails, good local beers and interesting wines on the list, we loved the one orange wine they were serving by the glass. And the service last night was charming, friendly, warm, quick, and thoughtful. Really look forward to coming back."

I had the Tofu Benedict and ate every bit of it, it was that good! I also really love their sweet potato fries.

I like the hanging chairs even though they pretty much serve no purpose. The service was very slow and the place was not packed. I waited maybe 15 minutes for my friends to arrive and the waiter did not offer me any water and did not ask if I wanted a drink in the meantime. It took awhile to get our food and the waiter brought one cocktail at a time. Also when the waiter saw that the water jug was empty he wasn't going to fill it up! I had to ask him to do so. I started with the Egyptian Karkade cocktail, which consisted of dark rum, saffron, hibiscus lemon and angostura bitters. It was not good. :( My friends tried my drink too and they all didn't like it either. I then had the Pina Koala mocktail and asked the waiter to put white rum in it. It resembled a pina colada and that drink was actually good. It was made up of coconut milk, pineapple, eucalyptus, kombucha and mint/chlorophyll. I then decided to stick to Beau's beer and play it safe.We all had the poutine. The sauce is miso based. The poutine was good but I would have liked there to be more sauce. It was all at the bottom so the poutine was a dry on top and you couldn't mix it.  This place wasn't all that bad but I wouldn't go again."

They certainly created a beautiful space that is very Instagram worthy.In the late afternoon they only offer smaller plates so I've only tried the Hummus Toast. The nut cheese and olive crumbs on the pink beet hummus made a really tasty and also eye-catching combination. It's nothing you couldn't easily reproduce at home though, so I wouldn't go back just to have it again. The bread didn't seem too fresh, it was a little tough, and the slice also could have been a little thicker.To treat myself, I also ordered their mocktail Pina Koala.

I also took the green smoothie, but seriously it's not flattering.However, I think many people are attracted by the look of the restaurant, including myself.

The bartender Jessica was super friendly and helped me with the menu (I only know a bit of French) She recommended the burger and I said yes. They also had healthy options like a carrot and ginger soup and a LOVely sounding beet salad but I had come from walking 10 miles around the city in the snow & cold and I knew only a burger would hit the spot.The patty had a nice crispy texture on the outside with a soft interior. It held together between bites underneath the buttery bun. The bib lettuce thinly sliced onions pickles tomatoes & cheese made the burger taste fresh and somewhat healthy. I mean it could be super healthy but it was so delicious my tastebuds were not sure. The sweet and salty LOV sauce rounded out the flavors of the burger. I ate the entire thing by myself very happily and very quickly. My next favorite part of the night was the amazing PINK drink. Also know as the Castilian Paloma. Tantalizingly tart and slightly sweet. And so cool to look at. And so easy to drink.This restaurant has great reviews on all the other review platforms. I was surprised to see such low reviews here. I personally recommend giving it a try. It's beautiful and fun and tasty.

Definitely top-notch service that's passionate about the food and genuinely friendly.As indicated by one of the reviews in French, the vibe is very trendy and LA-style and is a nice addition to the restaurant scene in Montreal. We ordered a class of Quebec sparkling bubbly and the portion of booze was VERY generous. The glass was filled up to the top which was much appreciated!My only small critique was that the dessert potion was too small. We related this feedback to the server. It was more like ""cheesecake shavings"" as opposed to an actual piece of cheesecake.

My date called a day or two in advanced to make a reservation for 7:45pm.The goods: We ordered a few dishes to share because we wanted to taste a variety of things. My date ordered the soup - it was a velouté containing eggplant and carrot (I think). The flavor was nice, but there was something missing. My date thought it was salt and I thought it should be a little spicier. The quinoa fritters and curry dish were both big hits - absolutely delicious! The avocado toast was nice, but it fell short on seasoning (as in, there was none). I'm still not sure how I feel about the brussel sprouts - from a flavor perspective, they were OK, but the leaves were so very crispy that they fell apart pretty quickly and it was like eating air. The gnocchi that everyone raves about were a complete miss for us. We both found the dish to be very, very dry and lacking in flavor. Between us, I think that we ate half - maybe. We ordered a bottle of Riesling and really enjoyed that. Skipped dessert.Service: Good. Our waitress was really nice and friendly.Price point: Everything including the wine came out to $124 tax in."

A couple seated at the table next to us had ordered the same appetizer as we had. We ordered ours well before they did, and they received their appetizer and meal before we had even received our appetizer. After 45 minutes of waiting, we requested our waiter to check on our order, and he ignored this request. The waiter only took action once he saw how unhappy we were becoming.The food, when it finally arrived, was disappointing: lukewarm temperature, the gnocchi was hard and chewy (unlike on our 1st visit), and generally not up to the level expected for this price point.

We were warmly welcomed by the host and shown to a table right away. Our waiter, Marius was delightful, funny and super attentive. We started with kombucha mojitos and they were definitely the perfect choice. I only want kombucha based cocktails from now on. Next we shared the vegan poutine which was absolutely delicious. The vegan cheese cubes are almond based and the mushroom gravy was thick and creamy. I couldn't wait to try the french onion soup. It did not disappoint. I have been craving french onion soup since I went vegan over a year ago. It was warm and comforting, perfect for warming up on such a chilly night. My husband enjoyed his tofu banh mi burger. In fact he enjoyed it so much I didn't even get to try it. I'll take his word for it.

The place definitely gets 5/5 for decor and ambience - tall ceilings, beautiful white washed brick walls and lush potted plants tastefully placed gives the space an airy bohemian vibe. Service was good, prices were acceptable...oh, and the waiters are all tall attractive men. In terms of the food, we shared the kimchi fries, which were fantastic, with complex flavours and a great fermented cabbage kick. However, the Chili de lupeh off the seasonal menu was quite average, and somewhat small in size. The flavour of the chili itself was fine, but so is the chili from Tim Hortons. After a surprising and innovative appetizer, this was a sad $14 disappointment. I would certainly try this place again because I suspect there are stronger menu items. However, I will be judicious in what I order."

The food is fine, certainly good if you have a need for vegetarian... but...The service is atrocious. Hands down the most appalling experience I have had in 15 years. Though the reservation was made a month in advance, we were bumped by 45m upon arrival. No apology. When seated, it took 20m to order even a drink. My main course arrived 15 minutes after the first, after I asked the waitress to check on it. When it arrived, it was clearly rushed and undercooked. One party at our table had two long black hairs in her risotto. In order to pay, two of us had to get up to ask the waitress for the check, and it took over 30m from when we finished. We missed our show in the old port. She brought the bills, and I had to get up after we had them for ten minutes to allow us to actually pay.In summary, the experience was atrocious. An embarrassment for Ave McGill, and they dont deserve the location. There was no apology, care, or kindness shown at all."

Maybe it's because of their excellent social media presence, or just because they hit all the right points, it's as simple as that. They nail it.- The decor is what strikes you first of course. It's light, playful, refreshing; elaborate and curated but not taking itself seriously, like the food.- The food is on point. It's not a vegan restaurant that hides its preference, or a baba cool hippie from the 60's with only grain dishes. Each dish has it's own flavor and texture; inventive, satisfying, good proportions and careful presentation. May be the dessert was the disappointment (hence the lost star) as it was not up to par with the rest of the meal. Don't tell your carnivore friends it's vegan, and they will still be satisfied.- The service was nice and easy. They may be trendy and full, but they still have a smile each time they interact, and they take their time with you. You don't feel rushed and the service is friendly without being unprofessional.A very rounded experience - the price is right, for a well delivered and executed experience. It's an experience that makes you smile and be happy, like the decor."

The restaurant itself is beautiful and has an amazing ambiance, but unfortunately, the food is horrible! I opted for the eggplant appetizer - there were nice flavors, but I couldn't get over the fact that it was just large, soggy, cold pieces of eggplant in a soup. My friend got the kale mac & cheese, which our waitress told us was mindblowing but really had no flavor and just tasted like plain pasta in mashed squash - definitely ""not worth the calories"", as she said. Next, for the entree, I got the summer garden salad and my friend ordered the Caesar salad. Both were absolute letdowns! They were both just huge portions of greens with a very acidic yet flavorless dressing - the only difference between them was the small sprinkling of toppings on each. Mine had some fruit and hers had tomatoes, dry & plain croutons, grated almonds instead of parmesan, and capers which have no place in a Caesar salad! Maybe we ordered the wrong food, but we left the restaurant with disappointment and stomach aches (from the huge acidic salads). Our meal cost us $70 - I wouldn't pay more than $20 for this."

/user_details?userid=A7YlcidsiAZzU-tCSsrTSg,Anny T.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"When I was in LA, I've tried a creative gourmet vegan restaurant named Erven that blew my mind, so I was pretty bummed about coming back to Montreal. When I discovered an upscale vegetarian spot is opening in Montreal, I was beyond excited. We have a lot of decent vegetarian spots, but LOV is dubbed as the one with a creative twist. Good: Conveniently located in the Old Port right by Square Victoria, this seems like the perfect spot for locals and tourists. The interior decor is beautiful, trendy, and totally Instagram worthy. I was excited just entering the restaurant. Lots of greenery, exposed white brick walls, and just simply gorgeous decor. As for the food, the best thing I've had here was the kale Mac & cheese. Even my boyfriend was surprise that 'it's not real cheese?'. Service was very good, the waiters were attentive and courteous. Bad: they don't have an English menu, which was a bit surprising considering it's in such a touristy area. I understand some French, but still had to ask the waiter to explain some of the dishes. I really wanted to love this place, but I honest felt the food was mediocre and menu description sounds better than the actual meal (except that Kale Mac and cheese was 10/10). I've ordered the 'Hero', (note: the staff was accommodating when it came to my sesame allergies, big ups!) The dish came in a beautiful bowl, nice presentation, but tasted horribly bland. Few pieces of unseasoned steamed eggplants were buried in the middle. The napa cabbage was minimally flavoured and kind of soggy. The tempeh was okay. Very small portion, but that was fine because the Mac and cheese was very filling anyways. Basically, the Hero was more of a Zero.My boyfriend ordered the Rave, which was celery root. Beautiful looking dish, however the only part that was good was the guacamole and pickled onions (I think). The grains were pretty flavourless so I didn't really enjoy it either. I think I did more of a Rant than a Rave.We also had a brownie for dessert at the end, which was okay. The almonds were a bit over roasted and the brownie was really hard. *sigh*The food taste like something from a culinary school, beautiful presentations, but the flavours and skills are not all there yet (except that kale Mac and Cheese).Bottom line: I probably wouldn't go back by choice. If my girlfriends want to try it, I might give it a shot again just to order the kale Mac and cheese."

It is extremely tasty and I can't believe there is no seafood to make it that tasty! Also the cheezecake which made out of cashew cream is the finest dessert.

Not only did we have the most delicious poutine that incorporated kale chips along with a gourmet version of a Big Mac (The LOV burger) but we also had a meal so delicious and healthy it left us fulfilled of our taste and health cravings. It doesn't stop there though the ambience is like no other and the cocktails are to die for. We didn't have desert because our bliss factor was already through the roof.

I could have mixed my own tequila w abit of pamplemouse juice at home. So many more better cocktail bars in Montréal so they certainly need to buckle up if one is charging $11 for such quality. Too much hype about this place. It was probably one of those ""to-be-seen"" spots in Montréal.

Honestly if no one told me all the dishes were made vegan I would have never guessed.

I am sure it was much healthier than what I had though. Overall I think it's a great place for vegetarians and vegans, but with so many choices in town, I will be trying out other brunch spots before returning to LOV."

/user_details?userid=pvEsmd6KG_bKhbaO3a9hiQ,Andrew M.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"If you are looking for a creative and really tasty food and drink menu centrally located in downtown Montreal, this is the place! My girlfriend is vegetarian and I am not. So, we often go to vegetarian friendly places and for us non-vegan or vegetarian people you will still LOVE this place. The drinks and food are amazing, the atmosphere is cozy and relaxing. I can not say the service in Montreal as a whole is great, but the service here is top notch from the start to finish and the whole staff was friendly even after they heard my Boston accent."

/user_details?userid=YDywsxKO8TNNM8E5FF2tgg,C P.,"Byfield, MA",3 star rating,"Let's get down to it. Two long time vegan travellers visited for the first time yesterday for Saturday brunch. The decor while nice, can best be described as ""pintresty"". High ceilings and hallway-like space makes it a bit loud. I had the vegan Big LOV burger, she had the vegan Haskap Berry Grilled Cheese, and we shared a side of potatoes. The first bite of the burger gave an immediately reaction that I had that taste before. Then I realized the name and recognized the taste as a Big Mac, pretty spot on! I cannot say that I missed that taste, but I can't say that it was bad - just wasn't ""wowed"". The taste was more from the sauce and mix of pickle/toppings than the burger. In fact, having a bite of the burger alone without the bread or anything else on it was surprisingly bland. It tasted like what it was - black beans.The Grilled Cheese was pretty darn good though, for a grilled cheese! If you are looking for something different I would recommend that over the burger.The potatoes were perhaps the best! It was a take on poutine with a vegan cheese sauce and a maple/sriracha syrup. There was enough syrup to dip the burger in and give it a bit more of a zip!Service was OK/neutral. The food came out fairly quickly even though the restaurant was nearly full, but we waited a bit after we finished and ended up having to ask for our check.I think LOV benefits most from its location near McGill. I would consider the menu to be very well done veganized college fare. Indeed most of the crowd seemed college folks either in groups or seemingly with their parents."

/user_details?userid=LHlKkrkppF-HIV3MOqAKcQ,Margaret M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Went here for the first time a few nights ago. I had to book online almost two weeks in advance to get a reservation for a weekend evening, so I had pretty high hopes. The restaurant's decor is nice, but it's a bit over crowded. Many of the tables are almost squashed together, so you could end up eating elbow to elbow with strangers. In terms of the food, it was.. ok. I tried the Lov burger which was tasty but not exceptional. The patty was soft and fell apart easily, but the flavour was good. I also tried the fries, which were pretty generic. The house ketchup was more like salsa - thick and chunky - and was not what I would choose to eat fries with. My friend had the buckwheat sweet potato gnocchi with pesto which was also pretty good, but not great. The gnocchi was extremely dense and heavy and the pesto was a bit overpowering, although the use of arugula added a nice bitterness to the dish. I think what irked me the most was that the portion sizes were quite small for the price. The burger, for instance, didn't come with anything, not even a side salad. All to say, if I had known, I would have ordered more appetizers. All in all, I think Lov is fine, but nothing to write home about. For the amount I ended up spending after dinner and drinks, I didn't leave feeling very satisfied. Unless someone gives me a recommendation for a particular dish that is above average, I probably won't be back."

The food is quite good, but the rest of the experience is just off. First of all, the don't answer their phone. Ever. They also don't respond to phone messages. Why bother even having voicemail? The first time I went, having made a reservation online, we still had to wait 30 minutes for a table. We felt rushed because the kitchen was closing and ended up cutting our evening short. I decided to give it a second chance. I went today for lunch and lo and behold, their computer system went down just after we were seated. I should also mention that the seating process was disorganized and people who walked in after us were seated before us. We had to remind the manager we were waiting. Anyway, because the system was down, were told by our server that we could not order and would just have to wait for an undetermined amount of time. I totally understand that these things can happen but maybe have a contingency plan in place? We waited for 15 minutes and then ended up leaving.The space is beautiful, the food is good, but the service just feels like amateur hour. Tourists beware, there are no English menus."

Throughout the night multiple staff apologized for where we were sitting but it was sweet and farther away from the noise. The service was amazing, and we were shocked to learn they had just opened 5 weeks ago as the place was absolutely packed. The waiters and also who I assume was the manager were very busy running around and kept checking to make sure everything was ok. The staff were sweet and helpful. I'm sure as it is a new place they are eager to work out any kinks. The place is beautifully decorated, and the ambiance is that of a lively restaurant. A bit loud, but then again it was packed. The food was delicious, the gnocci was fresh tasting and warm, the entrees were rather large and interesting. The two other dishes were the roast beets and something I've forgotten the name of, but was tempeh and eggplant of some sort. Both received thumbs ups. Affordable, delicious and a lovely atmosphere!"

They called to confirm everything an hour before our arrival, asking if we'd be willing to push our reservation to 8pm instead due to too many guests (strike 1). We were already on our way so we couldn't allow it. Upon entering the restaurant, you're greeted with a slim, vertical high table enough for 10 people just inches away from the entrance. The hostess only spoke to us in french despite speaking to her in english, and she immediately directed us to the seats right by the entrance. My friends and I didn't like this so we asked for one of the open tables further down near the kitchen. She, on the other hand, argued that since it's busy, we would have to stick with the seats we were given since we made no table specifications on our reservation online (strike 2). We didn't know this seeing as it was a new restaurant and there was no indication of different seat types online. Despite this, we persisted and were eventually redirected to a new table. The hostess treated us coldly and remained tense toward us for the entirety of our night.Since we got there at a busy hour, the drinks took 20 mins to arrive alongside our appetizers, and our food took another 40mins. We were getting anxious to try out our food only for our meals to fall short of our expectations. Even when we sat right in front of the kitchen, our food was hard and cold, and just as bland (strike 3). Only good thing out of it was the kale mac n cheese. The decor was gorgeous but as we started to pay attention to our surroundings, we thought it was a little too try-hard on the hipster side. From the bearded and tattooed servers, to the bicycle-mounted sinks, the white open-brick walls, and organic lavender-scented soaps, the aura of pretentiousness started to get to us. That being said, you pay for the experience and the atmosphere, so I'll give them that. All in all, our experience was a solid 3/10. We tried to like it, but the cold/overpriced meals, the rude hostess, the fussy reservation, and the general vibe of this place left us not wanting to come back. Sorry, Lov."

I mean, this poor sandwich looked like it had spent a week at the bottom of some kids backpack getting smashed down by textbooks before being served to me. The flavor was good however but so tiny and thin!! And they only had gluten free bread left today so I had to pay $3 extra just to be presented with this paper-thin sandwich. I also ordered the Indian Casserole and the chickpea cakes were just not good. I overlooked that because they are just the vessel to carry the casserole, but the casserole was also not the best...not bad by any means but not enough to counteract the chickpea cakes.

/user_details?userid=0ltgWEg8_n8BMmul-ETa4Q,Lindsay W.,"Boston, MA",2 star rating,"I was visiting Montreal over the weekend and dined at Lov with a group of 6 - 2 of which are vegetarians and one of which heard great things about Lov, so my sister made a reservation I believe 1-2 months in advance for when our family was in town. I was looking forward to it because we were in great spirits and excited to enjoy a nice rare dinner together. Unfortunately, our reservation was pushed unbeknownst to us -- they called 45 minutes before the 6 pm reservation and with no answer, still decided to push it. Beyond that this is just an odd thing to do, there was no offer to get us drinks in the meantime or even an apology or visit from the manager when we came back to sit down. Our server was friendly, but it was clear she was way too busy and had tables across the entire restaurant so she was running around. I blame this on management because a server should never be overloaded where service is delayed to this extent. As people who do or have worked in the service industry, it was just overall a disappointing experience, extra disappointing when you're on vacation and taking guests from out of town. A glass was broken and never fully cleaned up. We waited a very long time for our check, even after requesting it. That was the only time we really spoke up to the staff (after 15-20 minutes of dirty plates in front of us), other than communicating our frustration when first arriving for our reservation, so I guess it's on us for not speaking up more, but it's just unfortunate we weren't followed up with by a manager after the delayed reservation. And the food was good, but definitely nothing to write home about. I think the onion rings and the grilled cheese were some of the stand out dishes within the group. I will say that the space is beautiful as others mentioned, the ambience and decor is appealing (which is why I'll do 2 stars and not 1 for the degree it ruined the group's mood), but I'd only recommend it to a group of 2-4, not 6, like in our case. We were seated in the front of the restaurant, which doesn't have the same atmosphere as the rest of the restaurant, and perhaps why we were generally ignored."

Food selection on the menu was very diverse. Very good mix between imitation of non vegan meals and truly unique creations so your non vegan friends still feel comfortable and you can have have something new and exciting. I naturally got one of each, the kale mac and cheese and what was called rebel. The mac and cheese was delightful. The kale added some freshness to a very light cashew cheese sauce, very good balance. Rebel is what blew me away. It was a perfect symphony of flavors. Beans and squash added some heartiness to it, while the artichoke and tomatoes balanced it out. It was topped with some sort of crunchy substance, overall delicious.

The cheesy flavour?  Then came the Quinoa Fritters.  7/10.  My 3 year old had the Mac nCheese which is her go to at most restaurants...she had 3 bites and after I tried it for myself I understood why.  NO FLAVOR!! Nothing cheesy or creamy about it.  It could have even used salt!  My husband ordered the Hero bowl and described it as 5 separate dishes put into one bowl with no thought to flavour combinations or textures.  Vegan food is sooooo much tastier than this. There are so many opportunities here to make this menu great and we really hope the kitchen figures it out.  Good luck!
