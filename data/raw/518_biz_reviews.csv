Im so happy that there's one near me now.It was a wednesday evening. I was expecting the place to be empty, but surprisingly it was pretty crowded. The staffs are friendly and made sure everything was to our likings.Friendly reminder: do not order one piece for yourself, you should share with 2-3 people."
/user_details?userid=vj-gGhmf8zw4FJiJ4oWGjQ,Beantpreet K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Omg Luuhhhvvvv their mochamisu and strawberry shortcake!!! The mochamisu is basically tiramisu but with a cheesecake twist. It's very close to where I live, so it is my go-to cake/dessert place. Not sure if the proximity is actually a good thing. Highly recommend this place to every person with a sweet tooth! 4 star because I am not a fan of their service. If I could I would give it 4.5 star."
/user_details?userid=xxB5F6TJ4J1MlNufCdqz2Q,Monica G.,"Alhambra, CA",4 star rating,Their apple crumble is simply amazing.  I am craving it as I write this review.  The service was weird.  I stood in front on the guy at the cash register for a good minute without him looking up from the machine.  I get it that you're busy or what not but its always nice to be acknowledged when you are about to spend $17 on two slices of pie.

Lots of seating spaces. Good service. Look of the restaurant wonderful with a vintage feeling. If lucky, you can have burgers there (which I never saw at other Rockaberrys I went to). A few tvs mounted on walls. Not too loud. Serms to be popular for take-outs.The bad: Bathroom ceiling, and the path to get there, very low. Bathroom smells. There are four to six spray cans everywhere in there, which gives the bathroom a bad feeling. They ran out of Caramel Cheesecake (which was truly sad). Coffee moka too sweet. Prices, like most Rockaberrys, too high. Waitress gave our drinks to the wrong persons at our table. No idea if there is free wifi (if so, did not see any signs anywhere). Parking on street can be difficult.This restaurant is truly stunning inside (and out), but the rest is pretty ordinary."

Try their very berry crumble with icecream , the BEST. If you are a chocolate lover, their cake (they call it pie) with chocolate and hazelnut is yummy .Their sandwiches are good but I don't find it great for the price they charge"
/user_details?userid=v4e_WTXmxQto9_0o5Jk3KA,Fanny C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My advice: skip the meal and eat an entire slice of pie by yourself instead. Overall the dessert menu can seem a bit expensive but that's before you see the huge portions. It'll blow your mind and you'll absolutely get your sugar fix! My personal favorite is the Toblerone-flavoured cheesecake. I had it a few times at the St-Leonard, Monkland village and recently the Griffintown locations and it was as good as ever, which is pretty goddamn fabulously good. They nail the texture and taste  everytime. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to be seated on that last visit to Griffintown to be able to enjoy the people-watching on Notre-Dame or the old brick walls. Nevertheless, I was pleased with the welcoming waitress who acknowledged us immediately and took our order/payment. We were out the door with the prize in less than 5 minutes. This place would've been the end of me if I had been a student at the nearby ÉTS!If you plan on visiting Rockaberry and happen to be a glasses-wearer, I would strongly advise you to take a look at Voskins optometrist down the street as they sell gorgeous frames 8-)"

/user_details?userid=5D5z-TQ7LHj8RApCbe1gww,L M.,"Sycamore, IL",5 star rating,"Carry out for four slices of pie, chocolate truffle, toblerone, apple creme cheese and apple crumb. The gentleman who helped us made sure we knew the details of the fillings of each pie before we made our choices and was helpful with feedback. The pies were delicious!"
/user_details?userid=j0tcQwuG9byNUAmPS2bqNQ,Nicole D.,"Oceanside, CA",5 star rating,"***EAT DESSERT HERE*** We were in the mood for some good pie and the reviews at Rockaberry were on point. We passed on an expensive dessert at our dinner restaurant and came here. We were very impressed! The restaurant is cutely decorated and has a very large menu of desserts! I wanted pie but our incredibly adorable waiter suggested the Blueberry cheesecake. I am not a cheesecake person but WOW it was amazing!!!!! It was a cross between blueberry pie and cheesecake. My husband had the Boston Cream pie and that was also super good! I don't prefer custardy things but it was so rich and creamy and the cake was moist and delicate. They have wine, beer and a full bar. The restaurant also has a large food menu. The people who ordered food around us looked happy. The french fires are thick wedge cut fries and if I hadn't just eaten dinner and stuffed myself with cheesecake, I would have ordered some. We watched the girl make their milkshakes and she put like a half of a pint of ice cream in each one! They have a coffee bar and plenty of seating. Rockaberry has everything you need to make you oh so happy!!!!"
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The blueberry crumble cheesecake from Rockaberry is officially my favourite dessert in Montreal. Need I say more?? Ok, fine, you convinced me. I've tried Rockaberry years ago and don't remember ever being impressed. But that all changed on a cold January day when we were trying to find shelter from the ice cold winds hitting our faces around 4pm on a Saturday. Rockaberry was the only thing open for blocks and man, was I glad it was. There were two of us initially so we decided to go for the cheesecake and the truffle cake clearly not remembering the monstrous portions here. As soon as our plates hit the table, we knew we made a mistake. The slices were MASSIVE - easily enough for 4 people. I tried the chocolate cake first and remember thinking that it was good but way too chocolatey. My first taste of the cheesecake however sent me straight into the most blissful alternate universe (yes, yes, my eyes rolled back and I wasn't shy to spit out some profanities followed by 'this is the best cheesecake I've ever had!') Really, the BEST. I could eat that thing day and night without a problem (and I don't have a sweet tooth so... that's how good it was) but sadly had to share the slice with my friend. After finishing this slice of heaven, the chocolate cake just didn't compare so we randomly picked at it for the rest of the time we were there. Without making this too long, our SOs joined us about an hour later and ordered dinner - with dinner comes dessert and I have I say that hubby's Nutella slice was quite delicious (and I'd totally order it again but only if they were sold out of the cheesecake). All in all, a great experience. If any of you ever want to gift me something sweet, you now know where to go!"
/user_details?userid=irPNC99C0kebXqWlFZidtA,Christopher K.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"We went to Rockaberry's for dessert after shopping at a close by store on the same street. I was visiting Montreal from Vancouver and hadn't been to a Rockaberry since I was a kid 20 years ago (at the Queen Mary location).  It brought back good memories...We ordered a Rockabrownie and a Key Lime pie slice with coffee. Both pies were very good - the Rockabrownie is a chocoholic's dream and the Key Lime pie reminds is absolutely delicious. The service was great, but to be fair, we were there during off-hours so we were the one ones in the restaurant. The server was pleasant and friendly (although after her clearly recent smoke break she should have walked around for 10 minutes to lose the smell). Will be back!"
/user_details?userid=vUUsRtZo5okqZmyJolmt_g,Anto K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I'm giving this dessert place 5/5 because: 1) decor is great 2) owner Dominique reached out to us personally to offer coffee and ask if all is good and if were enjoying. Big plus. 3) owner is hands on and helping employees on a Sat. Night 4) cakes are always good here. Try the cheesecake apple pie. Definitely recommending if you're close.
/user_details?userid=qWFhKtzcHfbj6nCJwfTBiA,Donny N.,"New Rochelle, NY",5 star rating,"We took two slices of pie to go from the restaurant when walking by.  Was very fresh and flavorful.  My wife had the Apple Crumb and I had the strawberry peach crumb.  Both were delicious, just wish we had a way to heat them up at our hotel.  Definitely recommend."
/user_details?userid=a9asIKrQXjd_zCcuomAUTw,Mathieu B.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"We went to this Rockaberry for my birthday brunch at today's lunch hour! We were looking for the Griffintown Café but it sadly close recently and which was in my top-3 best brunch in Montréal and it was at that particular location but we were starving so went at that Rockaberry anyways. My girlfriend and I we are French-Canadians, even if we both speak fluently in English we were acknowledged in the Shakespeare's tongue. It's usually no big deal but the guy asked us if we were going great and than ran away from the table immediately while we were answering back (which shows that he couldn't care less). We were answering back in French to show him that was the language we want to be serve with (there is no French/English war here, just a polite way to serve your costumers in a city where most than half of the population speaks, even if we know that Griffintown it's mostly an Anglo speaking neighbourhood). So he came to our table a second time and seems to show that he doesn't understand French by asking us questions in English a second time. We were obviously ready to order 'cause both our menus were closed on the edge of the table but he was busy serving the only other couple in the restaurant so we wait there for awhile with annoying top-40 hits blasting out the speakers. He decided to serve us in French for the third time at our table and we notice that he speaks better in French than both of us in English. He ask finally for our orders and in the middle of my girlfriend ordering process he ran away from the table a second time to grab a pen and a note pad at the cash register than we both looked at each others with the ""what the fuck?"" face. He came back and my girlfriend had to repeat her order for a second time because he couldn't hear the rest of it while running away. We used to go at the Rockaberry on Saint-Denis quite often and we know their products. We both ordered a Vienna coffee which we are used to have with a swirl of melted dark chocolate on the top of the whipped cream which wasn't there but we had instead cinnamon seasoning on top which my girlfriend is not a fan of. The name Rockaberry is obviously from the musical genre: rockabilly because the logo used to be the logo from the rockabilly revival band Stray Cats. The music there being crappy top-40 hits in a hipster neighbourhood as Griffintown doesn't make sense at all. I've gave 2 stars for bagels and pies being awesome as usual but it lost 3 stars for the awful service we had on a very quiet lunch hour!"
