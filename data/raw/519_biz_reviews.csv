/user_details?userid=VKKJcojnbeWneqBjlHojwA,Rakhi U.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Visited this amazing place with some ex-colleagues last year before the pandemic hit us hard. We chose this cute place as it was near to our work place and it turned out to be a hidden gem! For the starters I got their Mouhamara dip. It came along with some complementary cute little pita breads. Those pita breads were so light and fresh, I could easily eat 10 of those in one go! It was a great accompaniment for the dips. The dip was absolutely brilliant! Such amazing flavours were packed in that small bowl. It was topped with some pieces of walnuts, pine nuts and olives along with some olive oil. There were nuts blended in the dip as well. I could taste little grains that pop in the mouth and create a delightful explosion of sweet, tangy and spicy flavours. Overall the dip had a very unique flavour with a nutty texture.Next, I had their Grilled Pita falafel with tahini and herbs with a side of green salad. I must admit it was the thinnest layer of pita I have ever seen on any falafel sandwich, it was crisp on the outside and super soft on the inside. Tahini and herbs were blended pretty nicely with the falafal spread. There's some cucumbers, tomatoes and greens added along with the spread. I could easily taste the finely chopped herbs, spices and nuts. It had such a smooth texture and the pita just melts in your mouth. The flavours were so unique that my taste buds were absolutely delighted! The pita was pre cut into 4 parts which made it super easy to eat for a messy eater like me. It came with a side of green salad with lettuce, arugula and rocket leaves in a refreshing lemony flavour dressing. The dressing was not too tangy, just the right amount. Again, a very unique flavour.Honestly, The pita plate was quite filling for one person. I could only finish half of it and had to take the rest half to go so I could savour it later. We went during the lunch hour. So, the Service was okay, not as good as the food.Our Bills were messed up, but I guess it would have been too good to be true to have all the boxes checked! Overall a nice experience. Would love to visit this place again once the pandemic takes a leave!"
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,My parents in law told have told me several times how they love Petit Alep and since I was in the Jean-Talon area I decided to finally give it a try! We ordered the Sabanegh mezze and the fattouche to start and the chiche kabab and the baked lamb as mains. Everything was delicious but the baked lamb dish was my favourite. The spices and the chopped almonds really made the dish. Prices were very reasonable and service was quick and attentive. Special mention about the service:My mom is celiac and the waiter and kitchen were so attentive. The waiter was new and he triple checked with the kitchen that she could eat certain dishes. We wanted to order the eggplant mezze but finally the kitchen mentioned that their may be cross-contamination so he suggested the spinach dip (sagheia). They made sure to put all the pita breads and on the side and made us a special rice without vermicelli. Exceptional service!

/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"La Petit Alep is another restaurant that I've known about for ages but for some reason, I've never been. They're sister restaurant to next door neighbour Restaurant Alep but at a much more reachable price point. After trying to eat first at Trilogie but failing (they were randomly closed for a three day family vacation), we were trying to think of somewhere nearby to salvage our Tuesday lunch plans. LPA to the rescue.Hours are great. Closed Sunday and Monday but every other day is 11:00am-11:00pm. A perfect spot to drop by before or after some JTM shopping. The inside is very eclectic. Love the use of bright colours and dark wood here. The place was packed for a Tuesday afternoon. Everyone was outside sitting on the terrace and basking in the sun. We got the next best thing - a table within reach of the terrace so we could at least feel the breeze. If you've never been to La Petit Alep, it's a mixture of Syrian and Armenian cuisine.The menu has a huge selection: sandwich and plates options, soups, mezza, cheese plates, salads, grilled pitas and extras. On the back, desserts and your choice of juices, coffes and teas. I had to leave early but the fam jam got to try dessert! - Metabal ($3.50 mini) - grilled eggplant purée, tahini and garlic. Comes with a bag of mini pitas. So incredibly fresh and vibrant flavour. - Mouhamara ($3.75 mini)  - bread crumbs, pomegranate molasse and walnuts. Never had mouhamara before but it reminded me of a blend between roasted red pepper hummus and tomato paste. - Sabanegh ($4.25 mini)  - spinach, coriander, onion and spices. I'd eat spinach like this everyday if someone was making it this good! Love how they have the mini option available for all their mezzas. Perfect way to sample and share. - Fattouche ($12.00 large) - romaine, tomatoes, cucumbers, grilled pita and garlic. This was light, refreshing and citrusy. Honestly, I feel like I'm eating so healthy every time we order fattouche. Great crunch from the grilled pita. - Falafel grilled pita ($8.50) - tahini and herbs. I wasn't expecting the falafel pita to be flat and stuffed inside like a pita sandwich. A nice change of pace from your usual falafelness. - Aleppo sausages platter ($12.75) - beef sausages with pine nuts. The sausage was a bit on the chewier side but grab two pieces of the pita and make it into a make do sandwich. The accompanying side salad is pretty plain. We added the leftovers to the fattouche. - Baked lamb platter ($16.25) - marinated baked lamb, rice and nuts. Lamb was moist, tender and flavourful. Love the use of nuts to give a bit of crunch to the dish. Happy I finally was able to try La Petit Alep. If you're looking for somewhere light and healthy to eat, this is it."
/user_details?userid=_PvyIrD0Mp-NswjUKv1URA,Deborah K.,"Mississauga, Canada",3 star rating,"We visited Le Petit Alep last night for the first time. We had checked it out the day before and noticed there were lots of people waiting at 8pm, so we thought we'd beat the crowds and get there by 6:15. Luckily we did, as we noticed people were already starting to wait for tables at the bar by 6:45. We were seated right away and brought menus and a bottle of cold water. After about 5 minutes or so, a waitress came by to ask if we'd like drinks. We mentioned we would like a bottle of wine, so she said she'd have the sommelier come over. That seemed a little strange to us for such a casual restaurant. The sommelier arrived about 5 minutes later and suggested a few wines to us. We ordered and he brought our wine within a few minutes. He poured it for us and returned to top up our glasses a couple of times during our meal.We waited for about 10 more minutes before our waitress reappeared to take our orders. We ordered the Aleppo cheese plate to start and 3 main dishes. We noticed that all tables were given a small basket with a bag or two of mini pitas. It seemed strange that the pitas were served in plastic bags, but I guess that's so that they won't dry out.Our cheese plate arrived garnished with some fresh arugula. There were 8 slices of Aleppo cheese, drizzle with a little olive oil and what looked and tasted like a sprinkling of za'atar. It was quite tasty, but I felt it could have used a little something else (maybe olives?).Our main dishes arrived a few minutes after we finished the cheese plate. We had one Chiche Kebab plate which had filet mignon with onions, topped with grilled pieces of pita bread, green salad and a rice/vermicelli combo. It was very tasty and the steak pieces were rare as requested.We also ordered the Baked Lamb plate which had baked lamb in a sauce with pine nuts, rice and green salad. The lamb was quite tasty and moist. The final dish was Poutine D'Alep. This tasted exactly the same as the baked lamb dish, but it was served atop french fries which had the same sauce as the baked lamb and was also topped with aleppo cheese. It tasted just as good as the other lamb dish, but it really could have used a fresh element such as a salad as it was very heavy.The waitress came by a few times during our meal and was very friendly, as were the other wait staff we encountered.The prices were fairly good. Our bill was around $85 before tax and tip.All in all it was quite a nice meal. If we were in the area for more than a week, we may return to try other dishes."

It was tight and noisy, but some friends from Montreal recommended it, so we thought we'd try it out.The Zatar mixed appetizer was a delicious start to our meal. I was grateful that we purchased the Petit hummus, which was the right size for two people to share. My roast lamb dish was fine, but not super spectacular and my wife really enjoyed her beef skewers. Service was a tad slow due to the high volume of customers, but they got to us enough (I just might have ordered another drink if they had come by some more). The cocktails are quite nice - we enjoyed our Manhattan and Old Fashioned.All in all, I'm glad I tried it; not sure I'll be back (at least not during the dinner rush!). It's definitely a place where the locals go, so maybe I'll have to try something different next time."

Arrived at 11h30, the place was relatively calm, but noted the place filled up quickly as lunch time is approaching. We were seated at their terrace. We were able to find free parking. The server was on top of his menu. We ordered the Poutine with braised lamb and asked his recommandation on few entrées to share. He brought the hoummous, mouhamara, 2 shrimps and sausages.My favorite was the mouhamara!!! Made with bread crumbs, pomegranate molasse, and walnuts.The taste was absolutely delicious. It was a nice finding. Portions were just perfect for 2 and we were quite full by the end of the meal."

I have no idea what they did to the lamb to bring it to this level of otherworldliness, but it just knocked me out. I will agree with the others who say it is a little pricey, but at least it is good quality. After my meal, I ordered some mezzes to go and pointed to the small, but got the large by mistake. They were over $8 each and not too big. But again, very tasty. I wish they had better quality pita though."
/user_details?userid=4C2LycW0izAjm4UEtvIgcA,Rich H.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Alep was a revelation of great Syrian cuisine, tasty wine and superb service.  All for inexpensive prices.  Soupe Harira was a masterpiece of deeplyx flavored, creamy broth with floating chickpeas.  I will dream of this soup.  Braised lamb was richly flavored and tender, with it's au jus deliciously coating the rice bed below.  Sabanegh (spiced spinach salad) was both light and intensely flavored with fresh coriander and other spices.  Moussaka was equally light but with a bright tomato tang.  Red and white wines by the glass, recommended by the sommelier, were delicious.  I was sad to be completely filled by these dishes because there were so many more enticing dishes to try.  Next time!  Le Petit Alep is not only the best restaurant we visited in Montreal, but it would stand out in any great world-class food city.  Don't miss this gem, just across the street from the wonderful food market in Quartier Latin."

Hummus, labneh, and moussaka were all fine but nothing special or anything to seek out.  The spicy beef pita we had was pretty good - similar to Armenian lamajun. Spicy lamb sausages with pine nuts were good.  Bear in mind that the ""salad"" served with the entrees is simply plain escarole in vinaigrette. Overall we expected more -- fresher, better-executed, tastier.I feel like this place is busier than it really deserves to be.  Server was distracted, brought the wrong check, and one of our mezze (pickled veg) was never delivered.  Overall service could have been better. Pretty middling experience, honestly.  The bread in baggies concept is a strange pretense given it's not very tasty pita."

/user_details?userid=7zlvQTXCmNxR6P-uLbj3TA,G A.,"Lachine, Canada",2 star rating,The wait time is unpredictable. My last experience included a one hour wait for a table of four. They have a waiting area where they offer drinks. During the hour wait we had a chance to order wine with no follow up for additional drinks or appetizers. They explained the wait is normal. They apologized for the lack of initial service but did not offer anything to compensate for the poor experience. Food is very good but arm yourself with patience.

Options were very limited but we came across a packed La Petit Alep. It seems like this place takes typical Middle Eastern food and puts an interesting twist on them. One of the dishes we ordered wasn't available, so here's what we had: 1 small hummus: the ""complimentary bread"" here instead was a few packaged mini pitas, so we made use of those with this tasty hummus1 falafel pita with green salad - looks like a quesadilla (in terms of 2 flat pitas being used, with stuffing inside), and instead of the traditional falafel that are spherical and crunchy on the outside, there was a falafel spread/stuffing inside. This was good but I missed the crispy falafel crunch. Salad was okay, there was a lot of it. 1 side of fried pita with zaatar and cheese - this was like a Middle Eastern spin on nachos, we enjoyed it."

Amongst the classics, if its your first time, I'd say you've got to try the metabal, the mouhamarra, the labneh with garlic, the shinklish salad made with tomatoes and cheese, fattoush salad and one of rolled pitas.They have an excellent wine list, probably in part because of its bigger brother, the more refined Alep next door, along with a knowledgeable sommelier. If you're more into cocktails, theirs are excellent as well.The only fault, in my opinion, is that they do not take reservations. Unless you arrive early or late, expect to wait 30 minutes up to an hour to get a table. Fear not, however, they will serve you drinks so that you can chat with your party until a table is available. I would prefer, however, to be able to reserve a table. In the end, though, the food is well worth the wait!"

/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Location: Jean-Talon East, near the market. If you don't live in the area and need to use transit to get there, it's a bit of a trek. The place: The restaurant is of decent size, with inadequate lighting. I found it a little too dim, even though we went there in the middle of  sunny afternoon. Despite the funky art on the walls, I felt that the place lacked flavor - there was no real vibe happening. The art, however, was totally eclectic. The service: Good.  Our waitress was friendly and happily answered questions. The food: The menu offers a good variety of dishes that are a little more meat-centric than I like, but they also offer vegetarian options. I wasn't that hungry so went for the Falafel + tahini/herb sandwich. I thought this would be small, but the thing was huge and I definitely could have split this with someone. The Falafel was really good and the tahini/herbs added a lovely distinct flavor. The pita was soft, warm and fresh. My friend ordered a dish containing Armenian sausage, rice and salad and she loved it. We split an order of spicy fries as well but we were disappointed, as they weren't spicy at all. That said, they were pretty decent for a Lebanese place. Not greasy, with a nice crispiness to them. We both ordered the house lemonade which was actually a slush (would have been nice to know when ordering), but we weren't crazy about it. It was pretty darn tart and every time I took a sip, I couldn't prevent my face from contorting into what my friend described as photo-worthy expressions. Price: Fair. The sandwich was $5.25 and for the size of it, I thought I got my money's worth."
/user_details?userid=GkbaBeSGvt-UmIcefpEARA,Andrea L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Friday night, 6:15 p.m., we arrive at Le Petit Alep. Take note of the address because I didn't find a sign, just the street number (191) above the door. We have about a 10-minute wait for a table, during which time we are offered drinks while standing at a little counter (the bar is set with place settings for dinner).I am ravenously hungry (no lunch that day), but my husband has gone out for lunch plus we're eating earlier than usual, so we bypass the yummy-sounding tasting menu ($20 p.p. for two courses or $25 for three courses) and go straight to a main course. At our waitress' recommendation, we order the Chiche Kebab plate (spicy for me... Terbialy) plus a side of marinated vegetables.A little basket of fresh mini-pita bread arrives, along with our vegetables: big chunks of carrot and white turnip, crisp and vinegary. They must do these in-house. Probably would have tasted better with our meal but I am too hungry to wait.Our food arrives promptly, and resembles the pictures you can see here on Yelp -- a skewer of meat between halves of saucy pita bread, a portion of rice mixed with noodles and a lemony side salad. By eating at Le Petit instead of Alep we have 1 skewer of meat instead of 2, but at half the price, we're not complaining. The portion is a normal amount of food -- what I might eat at home rather than a ginormous restaurant portion. It is DELICIOUS.For dessert we both try the Atayef, mine stuffed with walnuts and my husband's stuffed with ricotta cheese. His was better -- the creamy cheese cuts the sugary sweetness of the rosewater syrup. By the end of our meal, there is quite a crowd standing at the drinks counter...not sure whether folks are waiting for a table or just having an after-work drink. It is getting quite noisy, but in a ""this joint is hopping"" way.In my opinion, the food prices were more than reasonable but drinks (especially the wine list) were more than I wanted to pay.We're definitely going to be back, and next time I want to try the appetizers."

They also have a similarly grilled sandwich filled with spinach called sabaneg or something like that. It's pretty good as well if you're a vegetarian.The grilled falafel sandwich itself is unusual in that the falafel balls are flat and wet - but it rocks so hard that it's my fave in the city. (And I'm a self-confessed falafel freak).It's a pretty popular place for both meat eaters and vegetarians like me so expect to wait in line if you go on the weekend. It's also fairly noisy. Ambience is casual and the place has a warmish feel with interesting art on the walls. I've been going there for about 12 years.

/user_details?userid=Zv_rMzv_8-c2-g0WtEXlTg,Bruno P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"First time I ever tasted Syrian food! Amazing!! Tasty. Delicious. Fair prices! Wine a bit over my budget, though. But that's MY budget for wines. Maybe you can find it not that expensive. Wine prices starts at $35 a bottle. But it's $50 in average. Don't be shy and ask for instructions to the waiters. They are super kind and very helpful! If you need a wine help, there is a sommelier as well! I strongly recommend this spot!"
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"One of very few chill patios on this section of Jean Talon (ok, pretty much the only one) and they win extra gold stars and bonus points for pouring very nice wines, strong cocktails, and serving up exceptionally tasty and affordable Syrian food. Petit Alep is a little more young and rock and roll than fine dining (go in the other door to grownup Alep for that). It's special and served with pride (and no reservations. Deal with it.) The sound inside is a little clattery and jumping', and personally I wouldn't show up here after 7 on a nice weather day because I don't love a line, but there is certainly lots to love about Petit Alep."
/user_details?userid=XURy8XtzzUj_7AfRRdsbZw,Jessica S.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,"Two of us arrived around 7pm on a Tuesday night. We had to wait around 30 minutes to be seated, but we got a nice spot at the bar and ordered a pitcher of sangria. The price was extremely reasonable for the pitcher. The sangria was fairly good and not too strong. We got seated in the bar area along the window...it was nice and the waitstaff was very friendly. We ordered the mini falafel and hummus. They were the perfect size for trying a couple of dishes. However, the falafel seemed overdone and the mini pitas were served out of little plastic bags versus fresh, homemade pitas. We also ordered the lamb poutine, but we didn't love the flavor of the sauce."

/user_details?userid=eNzai9sZPYC812Gmd81_QA,Lalaine V.,"Honolulu, HI",5 star rating,"After walking around  Marche Jean Talon we asked a woman in a cookbook store located in the market a good place to have lunch and she recommended this place.  Another woman nearby overheard and agreed so off we went.  When we got to what we thought was the restaurant it was closed being it was a Sunday.  Confused we kept walking to find a new place and came across Le Petit Alep a few feet away which was open.  We hurriedly went in to escape the cold.The menu is in French and we had a difficult time trying to decipher things so the host brought us Restaurant Alep's fancy menu book since it has English translations.  I got the chiche kabab plate which comes with salad, pita but not your regular pita drizzled with an orange oil.  The meat was perfectly seasoned and tender.  It was so good.  I want to go back but in a warmer month."

Nothing wittly to say here. This place was absolutely great. I did the right thing and filled the table with Mezes, leaving the ""entree"" sized dishes alone. A big dose of Arak to wash it down..Nothing but great."

A gentleman personally visited to discuss the wine list and the server explained everything on the menu in detail (all in French FYI). Our glasses were never empty and multiple quality checks were done.Spicy ground beef plate was delicious and the salad du chèvre was a perfect taste combination. As a Torontonian foodie, I give this place two thumbs up."

My husband and I shared a platter of assorted mezzes. Everything was very tasty. The rosé wine we drank with it was very good.  Definitely a nice prelude to a visit to Marché Jean Talon. Ah, Montréal, I miss you!  We will have to try Alep next time we are in town."
/user_details?userid=s_ushMFjAYjIvszJW2gOhQ,Jessica E.,"Wilmington, DE",4 star rating,"If you are a tourist in Montreal and looking to go to a non-touristy area, this place is for you.  Le Petit Alep serves Syrian and Armenian food and has an extensive selection of wine.  The servers were quite knowledgeable and attentive (this is some of the best service I have experienced in Montreal) and sitting on the patio was delightful on a breezy summer evening.  The flavors and spices in the food were somewhat foreign to me, but quite enjoyable.  I would definitely be inclined to make a trip back to this restaurant and explore more selections of food and wine."

/user_details?userid=Yy5X1ddwuJJ_aEVDxSjbww,Ronnie Z.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"The Petit Alep is perhaps my favorite affordable tapas restaurant/cafe/wine bar in Montreal. Located a stones throw away from the famous Jean Talon fruit and vegetable market, this casual and hip yet inviting little Syrian restaurant offers a wide array of tastey snacks and delicious meals served in both small and medium sized portions, including amazing Hummus, roasted red pepper puree, Baba Ganoush, mouth watering Kebabs, lentil soup, falafels and many other Middle Eastern influenced specialties. if you ask nicely they can also bring you the menu from the more pricely adjacent sister restaurant Alep which shares the same kitchen, from which you can also order additional higher priced seletions such as amazing grilled shrimp and roasted lamb dishes.  The small outdoor terrace gets packed on most sunny days, and the inside is typically full on weekend evenings, so stop by at 3pm or 4pm during the week to get in with no wait at all. Excellent wines servred by the glass and bottle.  Nice service and a trendy hip clientelle of locals that know the food here is actually underpriced for the quality and size of the plates. Also very good for vegetarians."
