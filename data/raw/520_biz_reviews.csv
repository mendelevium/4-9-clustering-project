/user_details?userid=QUmUy-HH3jHXTSVF6Np3RA,Zoe E.,"Les Coteaux, Canada",5 star rating,"Went for my 20th birthday with my partner and had an amazing night. Got there around 10:30, there was 0 line up outside. We walk in and 2 women asked us our names (we were on the free guest list.) had the bouncer check us be briefly, and we were on our way in! Once inside, we went to coat check. Price for coat check was ""Tip Only,"" we gave 5$ each. There is no door fee anyways. The decor was lovely, very chic, yet the club had a sultry feel with the lights and dancers. Around 11:30 more people started showing up and the dance floor started filling up. The music was great all night long! This was on a Friday night, the songs were mostly remixes of 2000s to now top hits. The only ""Downside"" I have to list here, just for the sake of letting people know, is please keep in mind the drinks are more expensive than the average place. We payed 30$ for two ""sex on the beaches."" HOWEVER, I feel that with the quality of the venue, how clean it was, how lovely the staff was we were alright with this.2 last things that are worth mentioning, is the lovely bathroom staff there to help with providing paper towels and extra toiletries / mints  / hairspray, and SEATING! Being able to sit without the bouncers shooing you away (we did not buy a bottle.) this was lively considering I was wearing Louboutins that night."
/user_details?userid=I7Fmd8WQA0FozWOEZQNdkw,Lana S.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,Pretty cool club! I love how it use to be an actual vault at a bank. We got there pretty early on a Friday night (around 1030) there was no line or cover charge. We walk into a empty club with maybe two other girls there. All the bartenders are nice and some local (seems like he knows all the bartenders) bought us a shot which was very nice of him!Around 1130 people started arriving for their tables and we noticed how everyone is mostly dressed up (guys and girls) and we feel slightly underdressed. The music is a mix of top 40s club music. A lot of house music for awhile which is fine but not for a club I think. Around midnight the place was packed at that point people started dancing more! Suddenly at one point they pushed us away from our dancing area and a bed rolled in! Then two very sexy dancers did a dance on this bed which we all loved. After the show the music pumped up and we all had a great time drinking and dancing the night away. Overall very cool club! Would def. Come here again (maybe alittle later) :)
/user_details?userid=GlEhxPlaofxOOvcf-5guvw,Cindy D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"La Voute is a nightclub located in the former building of Bank of Montreal (the same building as Collective Crew & Café), so of course the place is gorgeous with its high ceilings and details of the safes.We were greeted by their team dressed as aircrew. In the lobby they had installed aircraft seats. We went to the women's restroom and there were several choices of sweets (I was not very comfortable with the idea of ​​having food in restrooms for obvious reasons).In the club, everybody seemed to be enjoying themselves ... The club dancers were able to bring a festive atmosphere, the music was a mix of everything with a predominance for house music.As for the drinks, they are a bit expensive ... I usually have no problem with that, except that I usually try to find an added value justifying the price ... I have to admit that I haven't found any, except for the idyllic location."
/user_details?userid=RilqlPavauS3sbs3Ct5Bpg,Anthony Victor V.,"Cape Coral, FL",2 star rating,"Club is new and looks very nice inside. Tables were a little far from the DJ and dance floor. Went here for a bachelor party and was treated well by the bottle girl and security guys. One annoying thing is going to the bathroom the attendant tried to shake me and all my friends down for $20 tips, basically every single time. I've never encountered such aggressive tip begging and when I talked to my friends later about it we all had the same feeling. It's okay to ask got and get a few dollars but $20-$10 is ridiculous. We come and buy 6 bottles but in the bathroom we get asked for outrageous tips really kills the vibe of the club."
/user_details?userid=fExL6u06xTSg13k945IPAQ,Nicholas G.,"Hoboken, NJ",5 star rating,Beautiful place... this is one of the more unique clubs I have been to. Located in an old bank vault this place has a modern feel mixed in with some pretty cool decor. You walk downstairs into the bank vault through a cool hallway to a pretty spacious club. The djs were awesome. The music was definitely a highlight of the place.The drinks were a little weak but that is sometimes normal for clubs like this. I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting montreal.

Specifically, you enter via vault doors of of the former bank.  The service was pretty good, my buddy had a table and staff was awesome. Loved the dancers, they were amazing."
/user_details?userid=bH--sW5TemoGHFDS5mkUbQ,Jazzy13023 J.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Real place . This place was once the vault of the Rbc bank and now it's a club . Once you get there . Take a picture with the vault doors . They do a job of entertainment .  Don't try and get in after 1 am . Girls are hot and men got that bag right ! Don't stress to much . This one night here will be right .
/user_details?userid=9JpJKc7IpFd94IRp45bR6g,Igmel S.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY",5 star rating,Very cool vibe and place! Went to the Door spoke with Shawn told him because we were not from Montreal we would like to check the place out and he let one of the group check the place and it's popping. Very attentive and good service! Definitely a must!
/user_details?userid=d1ATZPcuxcwHu35_9yKohg,Jason L.,"Providence, RI",1 star rating,Place is trash and only lets locals in. All the clubs in old port are like this! Favor locals
/user_details?userid=MROYusPMa4WAjCnoYQRScA,Viren G.,"JACKSON HTS, NY",5 star rating,One of the coolest clubs I have ever been to - it is located in a vault of an RBC bank. Where else in the world can you find a party in a damn bank vault?? - Drinks were a little more expensive than other spots in MTL (expected for the venue)- music is mostly top 40s and they do house music mixes with top 40 songs - clean bathrooms- big club- young crowd 20-30s
/user_details?userid=yt4n8ZHncVSVOuPRDBCEpw,Asvine R.,"Markham, Canada",1 star rating,"Might be a cool concept, it being in a bank vault and all. Went with friends on a girls trip. Ordered drinks and shots and after we paid, the waitress/bartender looked at the bill and stated aloud that we did not tip her 'enough.' Ive been patron to many bars and clubs, never have I been begged for money in such a standoff-ish manner. Tips are earned not demanded. Should have refunded the whole thing and left the place. Music is eh, nothing special. Wouldn't visit again."
/user_details?userid=Gz786XMe_7pSuDAEW8Wr9w,Reubin D.,"Alexandria, VA",4 star rating,"It's an upscale vibe. You walk into a bank and follow the red roles to the basement (vault) which is the actual club area. Once there the aesthetic is beautiful as are the clientele. Women wear your best and fellas leave sneakers and t-shirts at home. Drinks are what you expect to pay and if you really want to ball out, bottle service is encouraged. The played club dance music exclusively (no hiphop or reggae). Get there by midnight or you will be standing outside forever."
/user_details?userid=93pDxIwLIQG6W8MZ17sPcg,R J.,"Mount Arlington, NJ",5 star rating,"One of the best clubs I went to in Montreal. It's super upscale, so make sure to dress up when you go. Friday night I got in with one other friend with no problem. We went before midnight though, so it was a lot easier to get in. The line gets way too long anytime after. Music was too good though, played a mix of hip-hop and top 40 and it was amazing."
/user_details?userid=mAH2LAyd3e6PvTYHsg4mog,Elissa C.,"East Hartford, CT",4 star rating,"This place was V cool!! The whole set up was amazing, as it was in an old vault. All of the people working there, from the bouncers to the coat check staff, to the bartenders and the random mime were incredibly nice and helpful. They even recommended other places to go when we weren't feeling the music. The vibe was great but we wanted more variety in music. Tonight seemed to be a House/techno kind of night. Nothing wrong with that, we just wanted to dance to something a little bit different. P.S. to all the ladies, the bathroom is a prime time photo op spot!! Coat check was free and there was no cover (we got there before 11)"
/user_details?userid=h1UcaSPIPpQqMiWf12Csqw,Jill M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Really cool club. Hadn't been out clubbing in a long time. The employees are very friendly and polite. Everything is super fancy inside. My birthday is coming up soon and i am planning on coming back here again.
/user_details?userid=QIKxVlrHiSHTmIhjjHwAZQ,Jeff E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Amazing club with great and different service Always surprise us Different theme every week Best place best staff
/user_details?userid=OtMW3wzS-akygZm7erZ3qA,Kevin N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Honestly la Voute is my favorite club in Montreal. The crowd is beautiful, the staff is so nice, washrooms are always clean. Everything is on point. They have a different theme every week, and it is always an exciting one. Some may say that la Voute is more expensive than other clubs, but it is worth it."
/user_details?userid=s8u_sq3dUBIgAapO_sFUww,July K.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"It located in old montreal! Beautiful place, beautiful crowd. Had a blast at La Voûte while my Montreal trip. Will come back when I'm around  :) thanks for great memories!"
/user_details?userid=3T9tf4ywpdL8PBsG6cF3GA,Alexa P.,"North York, Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,I wish I could give this pathetic club negative stars. You guys literally suck. They let us all wait outside in the snow in -35. When you ask them how long the wait is they ignore you. They were also forcing people to buy bottles or they wouldn't get in. You're literally forcing people to buy bottles or they're gonna freeze to death. Hope you go out of business.
/user_details?userid=eTqkngyxFIIoLKm1hq50bg,Jonathan J.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Unique club (in terms of aesthetics). The place is a renovated bank vault. There are lots of hot chicks and good crowd. The music was awesome (Deep House, some progressive and some Tech House). Fun times! I Will definitely go back the next time I go to Montreal.Solid 4.5*"
/user_details?userid=vLc6KQo84J-ySu92-DR_Tg,Jose R.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Awesome club.. I'd say one of the top 3 clubs in my list! Doesn't get super hot which is amazing considering the fact its underground in a bank vault, drinks are fair average price i'd say, bouncers aren't douchebags, amazing music and great energy. Overall a fun place to spent your whole night."
/user_details?userid=PWREzCcBO2ojqPYR--tIew,Ravi N.,"Moses Lake, WA",5 star rating,"From the days of 737, Diaz family has been bringing great Clubbing scenery to Montreal. From the highest rooftops of Montreal to Luxury underground Vaults, the promoters will make sure you have the night of your life!"
/user_details?userid=wbIGbKUQwtUV8j71bu1jow,Kelly M.,"Norwood, MA",5 star rating,"Absolutely loved this place! I came with a group of 15 girls for my sisters bachelorette weekend and we had the best time here. We ended up reserving a booth which was well worth it! When we arrived the entrance was stunning and we we're greeted by some friendly people that worked there. We got escorted to our table and were amazed by how cool the place was! I was handling the bottle service purchase and work with two bottle service girls who were so sweet! They took such good care of us and were so nice and accommodating, I wish I remembered their names because they definitely deserve some recognition from their managers for being amazing. The decor was awesome, the service was great and the music great too! It was sort of House music but with mixes of classic songs that everyone knows. We had so much fun and I would highly recommend this club for anyone or if you are visiting Montreal for a special occasion like we were!"
/user_details?userid=g-IepUZghitdXV05zghIkQ,Maksim K.,"Auburndale, MA",1 star rating,"I have organized a bachelor party for a friend of mine. Made the reservation for the $750 bottle service for 12 people and was told to be there before 12:15AM. We left another fun place, where we could have had a great time, and came to La Voute before midnight. Contacted the hostess who made my reservation. She said that everyone has to do lineup and she cannot do anything. My group stayed and waited in line for about 45 minutes in freezing weather and line didn't move. We then gave up and left the place to the nearby bar. I felt embarrassed in front of my group. In my world, ""reservation"" means you can come in without any wait unless you are late."
