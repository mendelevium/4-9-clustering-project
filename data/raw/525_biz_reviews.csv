/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"You might be thinking --- oh really, another pizza shop? And, while sure they are a pizza shop, they are not just your average or by-the-slice quick-serve spot. They hand press the dough and only sell by the whole pie. I'd call them artisanal and certainly local, plus creative and friendly.You'll probably be greeted by Mike who helps guide people through menu of over a dozen pies on the large printed menu in the front window. They have a nice variety of plain to well-topped.They even have a Calzone and dessert pizza, with gluten free and vegan options coming soon.I give them the high rating for their enthusiasm, energy and desire as much as some darn tasty pizza, which have a variety of sauces to go with a focus on flavorful and quality ingredients for their toppings. Long story short, they are aiming high and appear to be on their way. Since they just opened recently they don't have all the decor set-up, but there is a gorgeous solid wood table in the front corner, by the window and a very cool swirled white, black and gray floor (not that you'll be focused on looking down, compared to at their delish pizza offerings).For good measure --- and hockey playoffs --- they've posted a 50% off special for a second pizza; Wednesday and Thursday (pick up only) and possibly running as a limited time offer. Â So, in the midst of this new situation; these guys bravely opened and are giving it a solid go!Good on them..."

I've been vegan for 20 years and there are zero options in this city that I would recommend for folks like me. I've tried all three vegan options, and they all absolutely meet the criteria for best vegan pizza in the city. The Thai vegan is my fave, and it's highly addictive. They'll also ""veganize"" any pizza they have, and even have GF options. A seriously solid joint to grab dinner at in the plateau."
/user_details?userid=2-wB5LTDNvA6Uheu6vGK5g,Rudolf V.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"I have been sampling Montreal pizza places given my high metabolism and need for calorie dense foods. I ordered from Chez Zac Pizzeria using UberEats and will be reviewing the food I ordered (Diablo pizza large).Taste: taste was acceptable. I would not say that the taste was so good to provide an out of body experience, but it was good enough. So nothing too special. The Diablo pizza was not very spicy. 3/5 with dings for being almost generic taste with a spicy pizza not coming out very spicy.Price: I got a large pizza for around 20 CAD, which is pretty good considering the pricing of non-fast food pizza places. However, as another reviewer pointed out, there is not as much body to the pizza. On comparing my fullness from this pizza vs other large pizza, it was around half as good as I could finish the whole pizza when pretty hungry when it would take around half a pizza from other restaurants to do the same. Regardless, the price is still reasonable for the area so I will not be dinging it because of this. 5/5Verdict: 8/10. Good value for a wide variety of pies. While my experience was a bit generic, perhaps it is different for other pies. I would recommend this restaurant."

I got a 10"" small pizza for roughly $15. The crust was really thin which I liked but it almost too thin, resembling a tortilla. There were barely any toppings. To sum it all up it was way too expensive for what it was. Good flavour tho, maybe get a large."
