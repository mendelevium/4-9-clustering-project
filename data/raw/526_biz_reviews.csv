I figure this place would fill up more once school is underway too! You place your order at the counter and take a seat for your food is served! I opted for takeout: Pad Thai (or Pad Homa in honour of the neighbourhood) with chicken 11$ and a Vietnamese coffee at 3$. The portion was huge and the food was awesome! Service was super friendly and quick too! I especially liked the Vietnamese cold coffee which although I've had before elsewhere, I never enjoyed it as much as the one from this little hole in the wall! Literally, a hole in the wall; this venue looks sketch, located in a rundown strip mall across the metro, but the space is bright, clean, cute decor and offers some seating with a very casual setting."

First off, the DECOR is amazing!  Really cool and minimalist, extremely unexpected for this area.  You can see every design detail was thoughtfully considered.  Secondly, and very importantly, the MUSIC was great (minimal and non-vocal), best I've heard in a resto in ages! If I was rating the ambiance, Maneki would rate 5-stars for sure. But now the food: I ordered chicken fried rice, a basic dish but unusual for me to order (wasn't in the mood for something oily and saucy, and couldn't have anything breaded as I can't eat wheat), it was overly salty and the overly flavours (or lack thereof) were bland.  The rice itself was a bit undercooked, but no big deal.  What is a big deal was there was hardly any chicken in it, which made for a pretty unbalanced meal (all carbs, barely any protein or veg).  Big disappointment.  Also maybe a l'utile bit off-putting that you have to tip before receiving your food, and even that you have to tip at all for self-service (order and cash, get your own water and napkins, and clean up your own table). All in all however, I have to say I would return with friends to enjoy the superbe ambiance."

I ordered their salt and pepper chicken popcorn which came with white rice and iceberg salad and unfortunately, I wasn't impressed...at all. My dish was bland and tasteless,  I could have ordered the exact same thing at a random food court's Tiki Ming.I took nice pictures and the service was very courteous but I won't be going back anytime soon."
/user_details?userid=ZGiwU16rhGvWAYUzkWL0xw,Boz X.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A couple weeks ago, my friend Hoang-Khai T. recommended Tao chicken at this location. Being used to eating more or less authentic asian food, I was skeptic about this whole 'general tao' thing, but I trusted him, and went for the MAYO CHICKEN (sorry Khai :') )The cashier warned me about its heaviness, but I was starving, so I ordered it anyway. The mayo chicken came battered and fried like general tao chicken, but with a mayonnaise sauce. The batter was rather thin and there was a good amount of chicken in every piece. But the sauce was SUPER SWEET - so sweet a little more sugar would convince me I was eating timbits with a little rice and a little salad. Speaking of salad, I like how they use sesame oil as dressing. Not to mention that the cashier was totally right, the meal was very heavy on the mayonnaise, and it wasn't even as good as the mayo chicken at Keung Kee. Another friend tagged along, and ordered the Soo Guy chicken. It wasn't as greasy, but it was sweet. The sauce for this kind of fried chicken was a mix of ketchup and cherry sauce, or at least that's what it tasted. We also ordered peanut butter wontons... Wontons were good... the peanut butter sauce was very average. While dining, all the other customers were non asian, and they all ordered a hot tom yum soup, which makes me believe that maybe I deserved a slap in the face for ordering food that I knew I probably wouldn't like (American chinese food is far too sweet for my liking), and I should have went for a soup that ACTUALLY exists in some parts of Asia (Thailand)."

/user_details?userid=-a0XgJCXoJln2Ue_JMnfIQ,Jules D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This place seems very random in front of Métro Préfontaine, tucked away in a storefront next to a dépanneur. But the inside is very well tended to--decorated conceptually and in good taste. Like the other reviews stated, it's very ""insta-worthy"". However, this is Yelp! So in terms of food, it wasn't great. I had the general tao and my friend had the sesame ginger beef. Both of our dishes tasted the same. Why? Because the meat was coated with so much sweet & sour sauce, it was indistinguishable. The rice didn't taste great either and the salad was just a very random iceberg lettuce side. The price point is passable: 12$ for a take out counter type joint. I had half of my meal to-go because the portions are pretty big. But I didn't even end up eating all of it cause it was just too sweet.In summary, let's just say if the cashier wasn't nice and the restaurant wasn't so awesomely decorated, this experience would have been similar to a mall food court."

/user_details?userid=OtMW3wzS-akygZm7erZ3qA,Kevin N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Had the pad sew and the mayo chicken. Both were really good. Maneki is a really good option for a quick lunch or for take out food.
