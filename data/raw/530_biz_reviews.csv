I'd definitely rate it 5 stars. Everything was so artfully presented (even from a takeout box lol) and luscious. Prices are reasonable. If you get a combo (appetizers + sushi + dessert), it comes to 25-30$ per person. Brownie points because all their containers are recyclable and compostable - woohoo! Here's a detailed description of everything I enjoyed for dinner.APPETIZERSEdamame (with fleur de sel and Japanese spices)Fried gyozas (veggie and tofu filling, with a sake and ginger sauce)Soba ramen salad with green papaya (matcha soba noodles, peanuts, green papaya, sesame, kale, fried onions, red bell peppers, mango, daikon, peanut & tamarind dressing)SUSHINopalito (roll of the month)Cancun Geisha (another monthly special)3 champignons (enokis, oyster and portobello mushrooms, avocado, shiba zuka, bubu arare, truffle emulsion)Mumbai (tempura mock shrimp, scallions, avocado, sweet potato, Japanese curry sauce)Popeye (oyster mushrooms, spinach, garlic, kampyo, oshinko, cucumber, avocado, chili ito togarashi, yuzu-truffle sauce)"

I ordered online at Shushi Momo and shortly after was directed to pick up my order here.I love sushi but I'd have to say nothing compares to real sushi, however this did satisfy my craving for sushi despite it not being the real deal. Most of the rolls have tempura inside. So expect some crunch to your sushi. This adds some nice texture but isn't the gooey/slimy fish I'm used to. It was still decent. My favorite roll was the Momo roll, my husband's as well, as the rice was on the outside. The edamame had an oily spicy sauce on it, I didn't really need that.The dumplings (gyoza) were super deep fried but my husband loved them.The kaizo salad was decent, and the sauce came separate so it wasn't too spicy. They also have Â gluten sensitive and soy sensitive menu options."

And I was not disappointed at all. This is a great spot for some vegan sushi. Was a little pricey compared to what I'm used to paying in the states, but was worth it."
