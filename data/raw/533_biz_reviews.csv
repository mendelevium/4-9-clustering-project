And the smell just makes you immediately want to devour the entire thing on the spot! Right now, they are having a student special, which comprises of a sandwich and a soda for only $5.00! It REALLY doesn't get better than that!Also very conveniently located near UQAM metro.Keep it up guys!"

They're bread is unbeatable - so fresh , fluffy and crispy and not too chewy like some other places I've been to. Service was excellent and each dish was delicious ! I highly recommend if you're in the plateau area but it's also worth the detour if you're not!! Can't wait to come back for more. Not expensive at all paid about 40$ for two and was more than stuffed."

I tried the Nem spring rolls with fried egg inside (MY FAV' it's so crunchy and the flavour is ) and the fried ice cream (For those who loves sweets stuff like me, this dessert was really good )"

We had the pork buns and were impressed by the quality. All ingredients were super fresh and the sandwiches were bursting with flavour. Delicious!
