/user_details?userid=wJF-NdtxYCk_SrwG4UUL9Q,Stephanie L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This was an amazing Italian restaurant in Petite Italie just off St Laurent on Dante. Very bright and charming interior, felt like a modern Italian restaurant in Italy. We came here to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and he was very pleased with his meal! The service was excellent, the waiter was very attentive and gave us some recommendations. We started off sharing the focaccia with olive oil. This was very good, the olive oil was some of the best I've had, wonderful deep flavour. Then we had the mozzarella di Buffalo which was served with some marinated leek, radicchio, beets and orange. This was a lovely twist on the typical mozzarella and tomato salad. Next my boyfriend had the linguine di sepia and I had the ricotta gnocchi. Both were excellent. The linguine was served with plentiful seafood and an olive oil sauce. The gnocchi were little tender pockets of ricotta in one of the best tomato sauces I've ever had. I could literally eat spoonfuls of that sauce. The only complaint we had was we wish there was more of it! To finish off, we shared two of the waiters recommendations for dessert: the semifreddo which is basically ice cream and the ricotta doughnuts. Both were delicious and were a good pair to eat together. The doughnuts came in a milk chocolate sauce. Thé cocktails were also quite unique and good albeit it a little strong! It is a little pricey, but well worth it. Thus, I strongly recommend it for a special occasion or if you're just really craving some good Italian food."

Overall, the food was good but the service was a bit questionable and there was a huge miscommunication issue where they sat my mom and I first, sat my boyfriend on the other side of the restaurant when he arrived shortly after us & we were both waiting for each other for 20 minutes! (my phone was dead so I couldn't tell him). Both of us came in and mentioned the same name the reservation was  under, too. The only redeeming factor was the food itself, my mom and boyfriend had the duck papperdelle and I had the grilled mackerel. It was good! We shared the cannoli for dessert (comes in two small bites). We thought they would at least comp part of the dinner or offer something for the mishap that started our evening but they didn't. Alas, we probably will not be returning despite the food being good. There are other good Italian restos in mtl!"
/user_details?userid=p2EafOXowPuCykUXHQcJtw,Stephane D.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Took the starter (Crostone) which is homemade bread and mozzarella: very tasty. Then the signature dish (Porchetta) and explosion of savoury in the mouth (with the filling very flavoured) and perfect cooking.Then finished with Canoli made with mascarpone filling a bit like a tiramisu. One of the best Italian in my experience in Montreal, short menu carte but the talent of the chief is here. Definitely a try."
/user_details?userid=sZSTmJZDWTDUnI_v4v2QMQ,Danielle D.,"Watertown, MA",5 star rating,"I'm not sure I have enough space here to explain how good this meal was!! My fiancé and I stumbled on this restaurant tonight, as we wandered around Montréal for the last night of our trip and since it was 5pm we were able to be seated even though we didn't have a reservation. They let us know they had full reservation at around 8:30 so we'd need to be done and both of us assumed, 3 1/2 hours, we will be done and gone in an hour! If we could have fit any more food we would still be there!!!! This was by far not only one of the best meals of our trip but one of the best meals of our lives!! First, the waitstaff were phenomenal. They know the menu and are able to guide you to the most amazing selections that matched our taste while helping us be a little adventurous too! We started with the octopus and short rib appetizer and were absolutely blown away!! We also had two pasta dishes and both were amazing! The gnocchis melted in your mouth while the other pasta (I can't remember the name) had such wonderful flavor combinations that we licked both plates clean!! At this point we had not order a main dish but decided that we couldn't leave without trying the chef's main entrees as well. We shared the cod dish and it did not disappoint!! The fish was cooked perfectly and the flavors were simple but matched beautifully to the fish! We also got the dessert which was a spice cake with dulce de leche and hazelnuts that worked amazingly (I'm running out of synonyms for phenomenal!!)  the only downside of this restaurant is that it is in Montreal and we live in Massachusetts!! But we have already decided that weekend trips to come back will definitely need to happen!!! Please treat yourself and come here and be sure to listen to the staff! Their recommendations will not steer you wrong!!!"

/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Impasto is the place to go if you want to experience authentic Italian fine dining in a classy modern setting. This is a perfect location for those ""special"" moments in your life such like an anniversary, a promotion at work, an engagement or making up to your significant other after screwing up big time.This place is the real deal when it comes to those special intimate moments, so make it count.So, let's talk about the food, eh? Impasto runs a very select, limited menu that they excel on. They do sometimes make changes to their menu but they go with their tried and true and deliver fantastic expectations to your taste palette.I went with their ""Chef's selection of artisanal charcuterie"" board as an appetizer, their Porchetta plate (Roasted piglet shoulder, rapinis and poached pear) as a main and the chocolate flan for dessert.The charcuterie board was beautifully presented with about 4 slices of a variety of homemade cold cuts, there was also champagne pate and olives. It was all in all totally delicious! I particularly enjoyed their mortadella and champagne pate. While I did really enjoy the board, sharing it with another person basically limited my portion to about 2 slices of each meat. The price-tag is set at $32....and that pricing is painful for the amount provided.The Porchetta plate was simply PERFECT!!! This is what gastronomy is allllllll about. The porchetta was crispy on the inside and moist and flavorful on the inside. OH MY GOD. The rapinis were spicy and tasty and the cold poached pears were just the right amount of sweet. I did taste circles around this fantastic dish. I went from the porchetta, to the rapinis to the pear and went back. Salty to spicy to sweet.MARVELOUS 6 STARS and worth every penny of the $36 price-tag!!!!! Good portion size.For dessert I had their chocolate flan and it was just OK. It was an ambitious spin to one of my favorite dishes but I tried to be too many things at once and my taste-buds were confused. I also tried their cannoli as well and I'll freely admit it was nowhere to close to the best I've had elsewhere.The service was on-point all night long, very attentive, very efficient. Not necessarily friendly but all in all very good service.As for the price-tag... heh.... let's just say that some of these items are quiiiiiite pricey. Some menu items are priced in a way it actually hurts looking at it... for example the cold cuts plate priced at $32. While I certainly appreciate some of these are signature dishes there's a little exaggeration going on here! While I'd love to come back for seconds one day, the price-tag makes it more of rare special thing and maybe that's exactly what ownership wants to accomplish.Either way, I recommend to try Impasto out. Do it if you want to impress your significant other but be ready to pay the price for your evening."

Our  second course was the cacio peppe pasta and the braised rabbit pasta. For our main, we shared the porchetta. Every dish had a unique taste and was a hit. Really liked that the staff acknowledged our requests and made us feel comfortable. They had some really interesting wine by glasses which paired well with our different courses."

If you wanna try some decent Italian food, you really should go here.We had the seared octopus and beef tartar for appetizers, the seared octopus was extremely delicious, there is no word in my mind to describe it. Also, the tartar is the best I've had.For the main course, we had a roasted piglet shoulder served with poached pear and some veggie. The juicy pork meat and crispy pork skin was a great combination of flavor and texture. We also tried the squid ink linguine. It was very tasty.The dessert was so sweet that cloyed.The waitress explained the menu specifically and served warmly. Anyway, it was really pleasant experience."
/user_details?userid=mlbSHnOC6Vsk1U1aVfj_Xg,J P.,"Oakville, Canada",4 star rating,Great little Italian restaurant. More of a 4.5/5. Had the bufala mozzarella and amatriciana and they were both really good. The actual restaurant design is average. Kind of looks like a diner... wine list has some lesser known Italian wines. Very interesting place.
/user_details?userid=-8nmj3B-tfY_vFiimtBOsw,Sanaz N.,"Laval, Canada",3 star rating,"I have  tried many times to come to this restaurant but its always full. Finally one night around 9:30 we were passing by and decided to take a chance and see if they had a table available lucky us they did. Waiter sat us down, and gave us the menu. The restaurant itself is very nice, great ambiance, nice decor, dim lights, I truly enjoyed the atmosphere and was excited to order. The drinks were truly spectacular, I had the lemonade mojito and it was out of this world.We ordered grilled calamari for appetizer and i order the half portion of tomato basil gnocchi. To be honest the portions were too small for the price you are paying and it was oh so salty. I mean veryyyyy salty, at first I thought maybe it was just the calamari, but both our main dishes were too salty. I swear I thought I was go blind. So be fair I can't really judge the taste of the food because the salt overwhelmed my taste buds. I am giving it 3 stars for ambiance, drinks and good service."
/user_details?userid=i6ZDJFeypkj6kCvSFjMbyg,Annie K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I finally got to try this place. It's been on my list for quite some time. If your budget is tight, go for lunch: they offer 2 courses for 21, or 3 courses for 27. Note: they make their own fresh pasta and they change the menu every week. You can find it on their website. The bread they serve at the table is to die for, the entree was on point, the pasta was perfectly al dente and the coffee+desert were the perfect ending. I will def go back again."
/user_details?userid=1V7883W5i_F3mptabTXFIw,Sarah S.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"The appetizers were the best part of the evening. We had the Quebec Mozarella and the Octopus. So goooood. Since it's kinda fine dining, the portions were really small but I feel that was important in enhancing thw taste of each dish. You could feel each element of the mozzarella and the sweet potato burst into joy in your tastebuds. The octopus was pan fried with lentils and had a sweet and sour kinda taste. Such a graceful dish.For maincourse, I had the lamb shanks which was so perfect at first but slowly lost its charm by the end of the meal. The meat was tender,almost falling off its bone and was paired with a side of spinach( i think), chickpeas and cream cheese. I loved that pairing and the gravy also had a bit of tomato. It was great! But i don't know why it didn't feel the best at the end, could be because the dish wasn't as hot and I don't like eating cold-ish lamb.My sister took gnocchi and it tasted amazing. However, we also tried the cod pasta which wasn't all that great.I feel part of why my experience wasn't as fantastic was because the waiter was not too welcoming. He was friendly, yeah, but he seemed reluctant to explain things on the menu. The entire menu was in italian and we were barely understanding what to order. But he gave me an impression that I 'should' be able to understand it. But he had great wine recommendation!"
/user_details?userid=2vKPIXEFrtqZc8zIWvA4tw,MaryJane R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of the best restaurants in Montreal. Every dish was better than the last. We started off with a mozzarella and pesto app and dumplings, then had a calamari pasta and ended with their signature dish, the piglet shoulder. The shoulder was served with a pear and cherry sauce that wasn't too sweet but made the fat on the shoulder one of the best things I've ever tasted. Amazing. Can't wait to bring other people here to try the piglet. The ambiance was very nice. We sat at the bar and had a great view of the restaurant and the other customers."

/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Location: Little Italy - on Dante, right off of St. Laurent. Street parking only - look out for the resident-only parking zones!The place: Loved the simple but modern decor, with its large windows that offer up perfect lighting. What can I say, you notice light when you're into photography! The restaurant isn't huge by any means, but they do make good use of the floor space. That said, you'll need reservations if you want a table, and you'll want to book well in advance. I was unsuccessful in getting reservations when I tried to book 1-2 weeks ahead of time (twice) so.... you've been warned. The food: OK - I think my expectations were set excessively high due to the reviews, and as such, I felt a little disappointed. Don't panic - this isn't a crappy review. My date and I started with the buratta and tomato, which was both fresh and delicious. It's not very heavy either, so is the perfect starter because it won't fill you up before you receive your main. We decided to share the appetizer and from my perspective, it was perfect for two people. Now, if you're a 200-pound male, you might want to get your own appetizer. My main was pasta with lobster. Do I remember the name of the pasta? Nope, but it's very similar to Strozzapreti, which is a short, thick noodle that has a bit of a twist. The pasta was al dente and perfectly cooked. Personally, I felt that there was enough lobster in my plate, BUT others may not feel the same for the price point. The lobster was fresh but I found it to be somewhat chewy. In terms of overall flavor, it pains me to say that the dish was underwhelming. I was expecting the dish to burst with flavor but sadly, it did not. Flavor was almost non-existent. My date on the other hand, really enjoyed the Casarecce so maybe I just ordered the wrong dish or the chef was having an off-night. I ended with the Tiramisu, which was delicious. Perfect balance of coffee and cream - I would have bought several jars of these to bring home, had they been for sale =-DService: Great. Our waiter was friendly, took the time to explain the menu, made suggestions on what to eat and drink, and patiently waited while we decided on what to order. Price point: A little painful. Considering the size of the portions (small), and also taking into consideration the quality of the food (great), I feel that the menu is a little overpriced. For a glass of wine, appetizer, main and dessert, it cost me $73 (excluding tip). At this price point, I would perhaps expect complimentary Prosecco or something.Verdict: I enjoyed my overall experience so I'll give these guys a redo."

/user_details?userid=Hib9c10vUQWvNpmysW_c0A,Victoria X.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",5 star rating,"Situated in little Italy, this place serves market oriented authentic Italian cuisine. From roasting their own porchetta, to hand made pasta and privately imported Italian wine, this place brought me back to Tuscany without the airfare.The decor is casual trendy; think rustic wood with modern lines. The ambiance is jovial as it hosts quite a diverse and entertaining crowd. From families to couples and some (I'm pretty sure) Italian mafia... it's your typical little Italy spot! ;)The food is however what really makes this place shine. We started with the venison carpaccio served with arugula, roasted peppers and shavings of provolone. The venison was insanely tender and paired perfectly with the salty provolone cheese. Cleanse the palate in between bites with a sip of Nebbiolo wine and it was heavenly bliss!We continued the tasting with an entree sized portion of their home made gnocchis, which were served with a stracchino cheese sauce and braised cabbage. This dish is definitely on the heavier side but worth all the calories. The gnocchis were perfectly cooked as they were fluffy in texture and just melted in your mouth.For mains we ordered the Nonno's porchetta as well as the lamb shank.The porchetta is not the usually thin slice meat you'd get in a sandwich, but a thick piece of juicy pork roast prepared with tender, love and care. The meat inside was moist and bursting with herb flavour while the skin outside was crispy with a hint of sweet on savoury. Definitely the best I've ever had! The lamb, although very decent, fell short compared to the pork roast. It was well prepared as the meat was fall off the bone, but didn't standout in taste.As for price, it's in the mid to higher bracket. However, servings are generous and the food is so good that you'll feel like it's money well spent.In summary, this place is 'ça coche'! Just go! But make sure to reserve in advance as the word is getting out and this place is becoming increasingly popular."

The service was impeccable, I got s table right away without much waiting and the waiter came by table after each dish to make sure everything was all right.I got the warm smoked salmon as a starter. It was slightly grilled, which elevated the taste of the salmon with a little bit of melted fat. The whipped cream cheese and the salad with refreshing vinegar and oil made this starter very impressive. The waiter recommended a glass of white wine from Sicily, it was a good compliment to seafood, it really brought out the freshness of the fish and the upcoming shrimp main dish. The main dish is a sort of pasta(I forgot the name), it got the right amount of chewiness, along with the shrimps, pine nuts and the wine, it was superb!The only regret I had was I didn't have their dessert, I bet it must be good as well."

The service was good, the interior of the restaurant is comfortable. The food is an elevated, modernized take on classic Italian food.

I would definitely go again for a special occassion."

Despite the nice service and atmosphere, the food was quite bland for the price you pay.I am especially referring to a chicken dish we had (doesn't seem to be on the current menu anymore). Literally a huge piece of dry, unseasoned fried chicken for 25$+. The seafood pasta was alright though."

/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",5 star rating,"Our Impasto experience was like a good expensive wine, end to end joy and complex flavours. The restaurant has an opened kitchen and we were offered seats at the counter in front of it. I think this kind of made the dinner complete, it is so much fun to eat well and watch how the same food is mastered in front of you. Impasto had a brand new menu when we came for dinner and our careful reading of reviews all over the social media, as to pick dishes in advance, was in vain. The menu definitely has seasonal orientation and I love surprises. My appetizer was an amazing beet salad, so carefully presented that I felt bad eating it, the scallops of my partner in crime were pretty good too. If I could I would have tried all the four pasta dishes, it was difficult to choose between the ink linguini, squash and quince options. My friend ordered the cavatelli with spicy sausage, heavenly! I went with the quince, partridge and mushroom dish as recommended by our host. I love quince and the flavour in the pasta was pretty amazing, but the entire dish somehow didn't come fully together. The pasta was cooked really al dente. If a manage to come back, my next choice would be definitely the ink linguini with clams, they looked so attractive when delivered over the counter for other customers. We also like to share our adoration for the pasta chef, he was a madman when it got crazy busy in the kitchen.The main corse was amazing, the porchetta is a must try dish. We did wise to share, it is heavy, but don't you even think of not eating the fat. My first bite is the reason I will come back to Impasto, so full of flavours and spices. Dessert comes in little jars, the tiramisu is five stras, the white chocolate panna cotta was ok. Wine list is long. We were in for a treat and my date ordered an expensive bottle of red, which was just perfect with the food. We also finished with dessert wine, private import from Italy with peach flavor, so good and again recommended by the wonderful hosts that took care of us. Yes, service is actually six stars. Back to our counter top seats with special view of the kitchen. This is a brave decision of the owners, the kitchen should be impeccably clean, the cooks have enough pressure to deliver, when curious eyes are staring at them. I would always pick the same spot when coming back to Impasto, as I loved to watch how the rhythm picks up and how it slows down as the first round of servings is done. Was it an expensive dinner, yes it was, because we chose so, we took the full package of this restaurant and without regret. Yum!"

/user_details?userid=7UT7F_62QmiYLzc1nhxDKw,Daniel M.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"Great service, great menu.  It was a bit loud, but that happens sometimes.I had the cod antipasti, the linguini vongole as a primi, and the caciucco with squid ink frascatelli in an herb broth as a secundi.The cod was delicious - very light and bright and flavorful, but underseasoned to my taste.  Not only is this easily rectified, but as an American, my taste seems to run to a heavier hand with the salt than most Montrealers.The linguini was excellent.  I'd come back here for this dish alone.  It was beautifully cooked and bursting with flavor.The last dish was problematic for me.  The broth was amazing.  I would have liked more frascatelli than there was.  The fennel bulb was cooked beautifully, as were the clams and the shrimp.  However, the grilled octopus, which was the central protein didn't do it for me.  I thought it was overcooked and overcharred, making it kindof useless on the plate.  But because the rest of the dish was so wonderful, this ended up being a serious ding rather than a complete derailment."

I went with my entire family (Step mom, dad, sister, brother, brother in law), and they are incredibly critical restaurant eaters, but luckily for me generous and polite to wait staff so regardless of how they felt, I was quite pleased with the meal.I wanted a variety of things, so I shared a lobster pasta with my brother that was definitely one of the better lobster pastas I've had. That whet my appetite for the next course which was a cold octopus salad...DELICIOUS. I've only had octopus salad a few times but this was definitely the tastiest and most generous portion I've had.At this point I was getting full but I still ate my carpaccio which was very good. I tasted my brother's sous-vide crispy pork shoulder...if you like your pork and are hungry this is the dish for you. My sister had Swordfish that was cooked so it was raw in the middle so it almost was like eating seared tuna. I had a double espresso as well and my brother liked it so much he drank 2. The waitress was friendly and patient and let us try different wines before ordering. It was a little loud but had a friendly atmosphere."

The olive oil, parmesano and greens made it complete umami.The Canoli was out of this world. Two was too many. But this lovely harmony of flavours complimented  a glass of chilled grappa and I woke up out of food heaven with a double espresso.

/user_details?userid=OK7rU2FjdZ2QTQ4z1wA-8A,Vien B.,"Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Canada",5 star rating,"Best authentic Italian cuisine place in Montréal. It feels like the kind of food you would eat in an Italian family but with an extra care to the details. The chef will experiment months to get the perfect result. The food is really well done and the attention that goes into the ingredients can be tasted.The service is extremely professional without being impersonal. The private imported wine selection is exceptionally well chosen and the recommendations are always spot on. If you have the chance to go to their special evenings with wine producers, you won't regret it. That place became my favorite spot in Montreal."

Crazy busy so make sure you reserve in advance.  We sat at the bar and had great seats of the chefs working their magic. Our server was fantastic - explained the menu thoroughly and made a few suggestions on what to order. We decided to share a couple of dishes between the two of us:- Homemade Apuglia style sausage ($13) - came with rapini in an apple vinegar. Sausage was tender and full of flavour. Rapini gave a nice contrast to the sausage.- Mafalde pasta ($20 for full size) with rabbit ragu, chicory and olives. Pasta was cooked perfectly al dante.  This is deliciousness on a plate.- Nonno's porchetta roast ($26) - a massive portion of perfectly cooked porchetta. Just the right amount of fattiness to it. Nice crispiness on the outside and super tender on the inside (you could break it with your fork!). Came with rapini and poached pears.- Tiramisu ($7) - small portion but you can taste the cream/liquor in the tiramisu. Perfect way to end our meal.- Glass of pinot grigio ($10)Everything was amazing - full of flavour and cooked perfectly. Wish we had ordered more so I could have tasted more of the menu. If I lived in Montreal still, I would be back! Especially for their lunch menu which I believe is very reasonable (2 for $19, 3 for $25).Great spot in Little Italy. Go go go."

/user_details?userid=1Nkuhh-HOUB7XUfgImWxmw,Valentina D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I was really expecting to love this place, having heard and read great things...maybe it was the ""hype"", but I was disappointed. It was good but nothing spectacular or better than average. We were able to get last minute reservations at the bar for 2...and I have to say that we were seated right away and that the bar seating is well made so it didn't feel awkward or like you were in the way.  BUT no one offered to take our coats --  they offered for some patrons but not others -- and they silently dumped menus in front of us and left us to our own devices for a few good long minutes until we awkwardly caught someone's eye. The wine menu was good with a lot of good, reasonably priced options. We ordered the charcuterie plate as an entree - it was small for 30$/2 and nothing spectacular. The mortadella was delicious but the other cold cuts and terrines were just ok and the olives were scalding hot for some reason.We followed up with bucatini cascio e pepe and the porchetta plate. The pasta was al Dente and good, but again, nothing great. The porchetta plate was a big, generous portion served with a side of rapini. The porchetta was tasty and good, with a good mix of fat and crust...but dry. The rapini were very good. We had the little ricotta donuts with grapefruit for dessert - delicious but small portion. Throughout, the service was minimal. No friendly smiles or chit chat ..."

Food was absolutely delicious. We got the mozzarella buffalo di Montreal to start, which was a ball of mozzarella with grapes, fig, sunflower seeds, and olive oil. All the flavors together complemented each other so well. Then, I got the small plate of Spaghetti carbonara. Amazing. My boyfriend got the gnocchi, which is very well known there. We know why. The lightest, fluffiest gnocchi we ever had. Amazing. The sauce was just a tomato basil sauce, but it was one unlike any others. Simply the best. For dessert, two cannolis. Again, amazing. They took something simple and made it unique. Pistachio and then candied orange peels on either side, and a candied black cherry on top. The cream inside was amazing on its own. Overall, I recommend this place. Would go again! Thank you!"
/user_details?userid=ol6v1oKA62i-eBrO2UbVZg,Maria V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Perfecly al dente!With Impasto being owned by two of Montreal's many best known chefs(Stefano Faita and Michele Forgione) It explains why my lunch was done to perfection. These two guys along with their wonderful staff, they certainly know what they are doing and it shows. Stepping into the restaurant, do look around. It's a beautiful, lovely, and modern ambiance. Especially during night time. With great little touches throughout the restaurant. Comfortable chairs, and spacious simple marble tables. Just beautiful!When going for dinner and sitting at the bar, there is these lovely touches such as your own little copper light and with a wide open view of their open kitchen. Great concept! Very kind chefs who take their time to speak with you from time to time. When sitting down, this is where my eyes and mouth begins to work!Right away we were greeted by a lovely, kind and well spoken waitress. Our menus were presented to us as she explains a bit as to how it works. Due to the fact it was my first visit there.  Certainly not my last!After a few minutes, a lovely dish of their homemade bread sticks and focaccia  was served to our table. Followed by our drinks. For those that enjoy butter and bread. There is no need for the butter, the bread speaks for it's self. Believe me! When looking at their menu which changes from time to time, I was very pleased that for once a restaurant that does not have a strong focus on slathering large amounts of tomato bathed dishes or typical American dishes. Their menus has nothing but a strong authentic Italian emphasis on it. Thank you for that!However... This is where I will be upfront about my one and only negative criticism. For the entrees there is only two choices. Both equally very delicious. Yet only two choices!As for their main course.. again only three choices. Followed by dessert, only two choices. I do not need an encyclopedia size menu of choices, yet I did find that it lacked variety. Mainly because I know these guys and their staff can do magic in the kitchen and I would have liked to see more choices of their wonderful meals. Their menu has a bit of a concept. An entree + main course(Two services) $21 per person.  Or a main course with the addition of appetizer followed by the dessert(Three services) $27 per person. As always, drinks are not included!So we begin with the appetizer. A warm octopus salad served with tender, fresh leaves of radicchio and a delicious vinaigrette. Absolute perfection in every bite. The octopus which is quite easy to overcook and change it's texture from tender to rubbery, our was perfectly tender, only very few delicate movements of the knife was necessary.  Followed by two dishes of Fusili cacio e pepe(Fusili in a very light cream sauce, that stuck perfectly to the pasta without having a puddle of sauce at the bottom of our dish. With freshly grated and very tasty aged Parmesan cheese, finished by a potent taste of freshly grated black pepper! As for the pasta it's self. Simply and perfectly al dente. How it should be! Our meal was finished by a delicate and delicious Panna Cotta. Which is none other than heavy cream infused with vanilla bean, sugar, gelatin. It has the texture of a firm, but silky smooth, delicate custard. With a fresh, and tangy compote of strawberries. Fantastic! More often than not, I look for restaurants that has a strong focus on quality over quantity. As their portions may not be big much less massive(Which I love that in a restaurant!) Impasto hit the spot beautifully. You can truly taste the hard work, passion, and love they have for food. Especially since everything is freshly made by them. From their bread, to the bread sticks and pasta. True hard talented work pays off. My taste buds and I appreciate it very much so. I look forward in returning!"

I'm shocked it has so many great reviews. We ordered a variety of plates based on the Chesterman review and on the waiter's recommendation but nothing really blew me away.

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"After a few months of waiting, I finally had the chance to check out the Italian restaurant everyone is talking about right now - Impasto. This small space, located in the heart of Little Italy and only a short walk from the Jean Talon Market, was born of the collaboration between Michele Forgione (formerly of Osteria Venti) and Stefano Faita, host of CBC's In the Kitchen. Impasto aims to provide great Italian food with no shortcuts - almost everything is made in house. Walking into the space, that level of craft permeates even the decor. Beautiful open kitchen with wood panel walls, leather banquettes, terrazzo floors, Pelligrino bottles lining the ceiling and just enough lighting to really brighten up the room. I sat down with a Negrini in hand, ready to enjoy a wonderful meal with a group of friends.First up, we have the Insalada di Moscardini - baby octopus, fennel, potato and red onion salad. A beautifully balanced salad. The freshness of the fennel combined nicely with the bite of the red onion, the starch of the potatoes and the fatty octopus. Add a little olive oil and some herbs and you had a great starter to the meal.The other starter I got to try was the housemade Apulia style sausage with pan seared rapini and apple vinegar. Great texture to the sausage as well as great flavour. The combination of the rapini and the apple vinegar adds some nice acidity to the fatty sausage. I know rapini isn't everyone's thing but I personally love it so that worked for me.The next course was the pasta course. I went for the ricotta gnocchi with basil infused tomato sauce. This dish is probably Chef Forgione's speciality and I had heard so much about it that I wasn't sure it could meet my expectations. Well..... it blew them out of the water. The slow pillowy texture of each morsel. The rich ricotta flavour. I have never had gnocchi that literally melt in your mouth like these ones did. Lightly tossed with a simple but very flavourful tomato sauce, this was pretty much the best pasta dish I have had all year almost without saying. Bravo Chef! I also got to try another pasta dish - the mafalde with rabbit ragu, chicory and olives. The mafalde pasta itself was wonderful - great texture, indicative of people who know how to make great in-house pasta. The combination of the rabbit ragu with the chicory made for very earthy notes - a nice contrast to the richness of the ricotta gnocchi I had previously.For the next course, I went with Nonno's porchetta roast served with a vanilla pear, pan seared rapini and some candied fruits. This was an amazing roast - deliciously rich and fatty pork meat with crispy skin. The skin wasn't the crispest I've ever had but still wonderful. The inclusion of the vanilla pear and the candied fruits provided some sweetness to balance with the inherent saltiness and fattiness of the roast itself. I love porchetta and Impasto's take just reinforced my love.For dessert, we went with the Tiramisu and the chocolate tort cake. I'm not a big fan of Tiramisu due to my hatred of coffee but this one was milder in terms of the coffee taste and had a wonderfully smooth texture. The chocolate cake had more of a brownie texture - very dense but still moist. Very well executed.This was a great meal all around. Impasto aims for great Italian food and they hit on all the notes. As a party, we did find the service to be slightly slow in terms of bringing water and taking wine orders but it is a minor quibble. Now, the menu changes seasonly and ironically enough, they just changed the menu for the fall so you won't be able to try the dishes I described above. However, that should not stop you from going menu unseen. I have no doubts you will be as satisfied as I was. Now, I just want to go back to see what Chef Forgione and company have in mind for the current season.Cheers!"

Our server was awesome ; kind, profesionnal, knew his wines. Very very good service which is already enough to have me say we'll be back. The appetizers were very good. There was a special dish inspired by the market, therefore we enjoyed a great veal carpaccio (YUM!) and a classic yet flawless burrata mozzarella appetizer (double YUM!)I was expecting to be really impressed by the pasta. Homemade, and all of them were shapes that we don't eat too often, so that was fun ! Surprisingly though, it was good yet not as much as I had hoped so. My boyfriend had the full plate of the pasta of the day and felt like it was a small portion. I had tons of seafood in mine which made up for the sauce which I felt was a little underwhelming. However, don't get me wrong, it was still really tasty. You can tell how fresh their food is. Really.The cheese plate was a bit of a bummer. We didn't get how and why a cheese platter could include a huge portion of parmesan. BUT the caciocavallo and the gorgonzala themselves were more than enough. The servings were huge and the price really reasonable !Desert was PER-FECT. And so was the wine !!It's a place to try. Nice ambiance, awesome service and very cute decor. Around 50$ per person, before wine + tips. You should go !"

The only pasta that I knew was pappardelle...the server had to kindly inform me the others were pasta too - oh! What a relief:) We started w/the mozzarella appetizer - lovely! There were shavings of artichoke, fennel? I'm not sure but a great combination of flavors. (One tiny complaint - they ration out the bread like I've never seen at an Italian restaurant! - we just kept asking for more haha.) We then ordered two half size pastas to share (gnocchi and lobster one) and the quail (it does resemble chicken!).

I'm not exaggerating (I was tasting the hot water from where the pasta has been cooked in) I couldn't believe it especially for a pasta plate close to the 30$.I asked the waiter if it was possible to have a bit more sauce. After 4-5 min he came back telling me the ""Chef"" insisted in serving the plate like I received it, they would be pleased to make something else... Basically he refused to give me more sauce... Anyways... I had the beef tartare as an antipasto and it was pretty decent. Don't take the salad it was very small amount of it with a bit of dressing for 18$. However it looks like everybody agreed on the porcetta dish to say it was good and tasty.Service was great and the waiter was very nice and diplomat considering the ""chef"" exigences...Wines menu is impressive with good bottles.Nice Environnement, bar, tables, open kitchen concept.I went, I saw, I won't come back ;("

The food was good though and that bein said I would have rated this restaurant much higher if it hadn't been for the service. We were not taken care of and they seemed to have forgotten about us a few times. I never got water or any refills. The waiter didn't explain the menu much, or very well for that matter. We weren't brought any bread and when I had asked for it I had to ask for the olive oil because she didn't bring it with the bread.

Each course seemed better than the previous one- all were delicious.  The salad is lovely- fresh vegetables served with fresh mozzarella and bread. We followed it with house made duck prosciutto served with melon- simply divine!  Next came a pasta in lemon creme fraiche with arugula that may be the most delicious thing I've eaten in months.  We finished with pasta and seafood in a red sauce- simple, fresh, and delicious.  Can't recommend this place enough."

/user_details?userid=e9m-rEBMioO3SXG1N11qGA,Erica T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Took my family to Impasto for a special occasion and I had high expectations but was still very impressed by almost everything.First things first: The staff is incredible. As soon as I approached the front door, one of the waiters rushed to open the door for me and welcome me in. Most of my family was already seated, so I joined them, and our waiter immediately came to see me to fill my water glass and take my drink order. My mother is the kind of person who'll ask random, unnecessary questions about any restaurant she's in, and our waiter was totally patient with her when he really didn't need to be. My father, being as clumsy as he is, spilled his glass of wine on the table and a staff member cleaned up the mess right away; he couldn't have been kinder or more polite, even as the rest of us felt kind of embarrassed.Next: The food. Fantastic. I found most of the portions a little small for the price, but just can't deny the quality of the ingredients used. The waiter recommended a half-portion of pasta for everyone ordering a secondo (meat dish) afterward, even if we had ordered three secondi for four people. A half-portion of the longer pastas, like pappardelle, looked especially small, but the lobster pappardelle in particular were so rich and buttery that maybe a larger portion would've been too heavy. The margherite (stuffed with a mascarpone and pea filling) were perfect. A half-portion of those wasn't ridiculously small but I loved them so much I could easily have eaten more. Hard recommend. Impasto's famous ricotta gnocchi are amazing but I think I liked the margherite even more.The secondi were just as delicious and beautifully plated as the primi - the veal cheek was tender, the quail was flavourful and moist, and the porchetta was delicious (I say this as someone who doesn't usually love porchetta.)I had the ricotta cake for dessert and it was perfect: cake-y, with a really nice ricotta flavour, not too heavy, not too sweet. I don't think anyone could resist it, no matter how they feel about dessert.Overall, the delicious food, friendly, professional service, and laid-back vibe of Impasto make it just about perfect."
