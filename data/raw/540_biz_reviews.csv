/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This new restaurant in the Cours Montreal food court specializes in delicious soft shell tacos, which come in about 8 or 9 varieties ranging from combinations of pork, chicken, beef, and vegetables.While these might not win a competition for the greatest tacos in the world, they are beyond solid and most importantly authentic. The staff are all speaking Spanish behind the counter. The soft shell tacos are filled with tasty meat, onions, cilantro and other delicious toppings. Served with unlimited optional green crema and a fiery red sauce, these little pockets of joy hit all the right notes. The meat is tender and the flavors are rich.Most importantly, it is important to note that Montreal has precious few Mexican food court establishments. Those that do exist tend to be vile derivative franchises serving lowest common denominator food. Fortunately, these guys are putting out genuine homemade food in the midst of a downtown Montreal food Court. 8 delicious tacos and a large bottle drink came to less than 16$ including tax. (Memo to Time Out Market: Stick that in your pipe and smoke it!)Places like this should be cherished and celebrated. Â I am however worried for them as they have chosen to lease space from a landlord that has buried dozens of businesses over the last 20 years. The turnover rate in this food court is shameful and unacceptable. I cannot even begin to count the number of hard working restaurant owners who have had their dreams destroyed by this business model in this location. I suspect that onerous clauses in their leases requiring they pay a percentage of their sales on top of a base monthly rent is to blame. I wish these guys well and hope they can turn a profit here. So far, so good. This whole past week, lineups here have rivaled those at Thai Express which is a good thing. We should welcome more diversity in the downtown core, and these entrepreneurs seem to be well tuned into the public's appetite for inexpensive and high quality Mexican food."
