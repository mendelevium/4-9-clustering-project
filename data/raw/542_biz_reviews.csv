/user_details?userid=RwQUv7Cn61gTkPXcytSrSQ,Amy Yu T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We only tried the pandemic version if Jun-I but it did not disappoint. I can easily say that Jun-I is the best traditional sushi joint in the city.We had a budget and told the restaurant to go wild with their recommendations, including a few of our favourite pieces. We had the uni, scallops, snow crab, toro, salmon, ebi shrimp, ikura, hamachi, unagi, and a variety of other delicious creations, including the one with the quail egg.The fish was fresh, the rice was perfectly seasoned and we have no complaints. One advice I would give is to eat the sushi with the seaweed first, or it loses its crunchiness. Overall, the attention to detail the chef had for these sushis can be tasted."
/user_details?userid=qtgr1_fvKoMJd4t-naoGqg,Meg A.,"Moretown, VT",5 star rating,"Everything about our evening was made special by the exquisite care Juni and his staff put into our experience and meal.One of the best pieces of advice I had read prior to booking my reservation was to sit at the bar. As a couple, I can't even imagine sitting anywhere else, whether you're on a first date or are an established couple. For me, it's the best seat in the house. At Juni, you can watch the master himself at work, skillfully slicing sashimi and artfully arranging it on wooden slabs and slates. His two sous chefs work alongside him, and each greeted us with friendly smiles.The bar is also the home of the best service, and our waiter was the best of the best. Patient, kind, informative, and exceedingly welcoming. It helped make our evening extra delightful.We ordered so much food, sampling sushis, sashimis, rolls, miso soup, salad, and more. Next time, I wouldn't hesitate to order the Omakase experience.  Oh, and the Juni Gin was outstanding.  Favorite cocktail of my whole weekend.Can't wait to return next time I'm in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=cntYY9TAsK8gLccAVmLK9Q,Joanie M.,"Granby, Canada",4 star rating,"I love sushis! Good sushi! Quality of fish, quality of rice, simple presentation but lovely taste. I went for lunch and it was quite affordable too. You should try their dessert as well as it was quite intricate and fresh at the same time. Delicious. You know, sushi is the kind of thing you crave and it needs to be satisfactory to the fullest. It totally was. For 30 bucks to have this quality is outstanding. But there was just one comment for the sommelier, it's extremely hard to find a bad Austrian wine and he succeeded. I don't know how he does it. In fact, I don't even think it could qualify as a wine since it was a 6% alcohol fragrant and dull beverage. Not so bad with the food but still not exciting. That would be the only downer. Next time, i'll probably try the cocktails or their nice selection of Sake."

I asked my foodie friend and he recommended Jun I - and then a bunch of dishes, mostly sushi, that he thought we should try. And so we did. And we spent a fair bit, getting hot sake, starters, sushi and desserts. First, we had a mixed seaweed starter that was beautifully delicate - each one perfumed in different ways, some tangy, some salty, all tasting of the sea but not offensively so. Then, the star of the meal (which we ate too quickly to photograph): the mixed sashimi plate. GOOD LORD I had no idea fish + sauce could taste so good - each fish paired with a different sauce, from yuzu to miso to japanese plum. The miso paste was so mind blowingly umami and rich that I actually licked the spoon (sorry).Then, a genmaicha-smoked salmon that is the most intensely smoky flavour I've ever experienced - so fresh and deep that it tasted like a campfire. It came with a bunch of little garnishes that were all incredible: marinated grapes, rice crackers and dill. Mmm that was so good yessssThe sushi - we had mixed nigiri and a couple of the sushi rolls - was all excellent, fresh, and well curated, but it didn't stand out flavour-wise as much as the preceding dishes. Not to say it's bad! I just think I prefer flavour over texture, and the sushi is all definitely about clean, fresh flavours and the soft texture of good fish. The dessert was two things: a crème brûlée and a pannacotta (I think?) with a basil sorbet that was amazingly leafy-tasting. You know what I mean. I wasn't expecting a sushi restaurant to excel at dessert as well, but it totally did!Oh my god this meal was so good. I can die happy."
/user_details?userid=JMP9JY5JV2HfWn8ClTBb6A,Matthew T.,"Bradenton, FL",4 star rating,"Found this place on one of those ""best of Montreal"" lists.  Great Sake selection, so that is a good place to start.  As some of the other people have said ""solid sushi here"" and I would agree with that.  some of the starters are very creative and tasty.  Those were where the exploration is.  What else we had was good representation of the craft."

/user_details?userid=_Biu9UkF2PRH6LOYZUVD3g,Natalie M.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Whenever my boyfriend and I visit Montreal, we always find ourselves back at Jun I. We went for the first time 3 years ago and have made a visit every single time we've been in Montreal. If you want a sushi experience that's a little bit out of the ordinary but with good quality sashimi, then this is the place. The decor is very nice and cozy especially at night.Passion fruit CocktailI can't remember the exact name of this cocktail but it is phenomenal and a must try if you like passion fruit. It's refreshing and not overly sweet and I believe it was made with gin.Their sashimi is always fresh. I always order the scallop sashimi when I visit and it never disappoints. In the pictures below, we had an oyster shooter platter and  a sashimi platter with different powders/sauces. Although not all the flavours worked, the restaurant always changes up their menu and tries innovative flavour pairings.We also tried the grilled octopus. There was some small tofu pieces, nori and a very unique sauce.Bitter Caramel Mille CrepeI don't enjoy bitter flavours but this dessert was so unique. When I had this, mille crepe cakes weren't very popular yet so this is the first time I had tried anything like it. Between the layers of crepe, there was a Madagascar vanilla infused whipped cream which perfectly balanced the bitter caramel."
/user_details?userid=CtBx4yk_QM8ClITgw94TPQ,Simon P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Without a doubt some of the best sushi I had in my life. Wow! We trusted the chef with the tasting menu and he did not disappoint. I couldn't even tell you what I ate, but everything was just perfect.I remember salmon and tuna as appetizers - outstanding. Another level. Not your usual sushi joint around the block.I discovered a non-pasteurized sake: incredible. Fruity, tasty, amazing. Best I've ever had.In fact, eating at Jun I rendered a lot of other sushi joints in Montreal obsolete. I have two small complaints: the high price makes dining here an occasional affair at best, and the washrooms are surprisingly filthy and outdated for such a high-class restaurant.But otherwise, perfect!"
/user_details?userid=kEVMEd0_xTrvwUg-IHG_cA,Stefano S.,"San Jose, CA",5 star rating,"Had an absolutely fantastic experience here with a great friend of mine. Small, intimate and well-designed interior with open sushi bar. The fish quality was obscene, the service impeccable (they even made me feel un-awkward when I was waiting for my friend to show up) - we did a double Omakase order and let the chefs do their thing. This was some of the best sushi I've had anywhere on earth. Certainly comparable to what I can get in San Francisco, if not better. Plus, the staff did a shot with us, so that was fantastic."
/user_details?userid=DByGAySqphwydrKuk-lXFg,Romy C.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"Awesome waiters at this place. They were very attentive and very courteous. The fish was all very fresh. The scallop was definitely worth the price. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the salad or the soup I had. However I didn't go there for the leafy greens. The other item which is unrelated to the fish was the soda. It was a tad flat. Other than that I enjoyed my night, food was fresh, the dessert was divine!"

They had the worst fixed menu I've ever eaten in my whole life. The soup had a weird consistent and it was so disgusting, the worst was the foie gras sushi, I don't know if the chef before giving it to customers tried the menu. Honestly very disappointed with the restaurant, and extremely pricy. Not worth it at all"

I ordered the panna cotta and it was so good that for the first time ever, I had to order a second dessert just to see what more their pastry chef is capable if, even though I was already food. This restaurant is a pretty damn good spot but sushi but it is a true hidden gem when it comes to desserts!"
/user_details?userid=cF1oFZ2cl1xpQIsq-yA4mQ,Aretha C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This meal was a real treat. The atmosphere was trendy and open, for some reason I expected a small traditional-looking Japanese restaurant. Service was knowledgeable and relaxed, which is good for a fancy resto. We went for the omakase dinner (so we didn't know the price until the end). First off, a venison tataki accompanied by a plethora of fresh ingredients like pickled onions, nori chips, and sprouts made a great appetizer. Second, grilled cod in dashi broth. Listen up, this was THE BEST cooked fish I've even had in my life. Smooth, mellow flavour, lightly crisp skin with a slight sweetness. I can't stress enough how mind blowing this cod was! AMAZING. Next, we had a few specialty maki rolls. They were very innovative and delicious, but I found the rolls a bit overkill with all the flavours and ingredients. Then we got a sushi and sashimi board. The sushi and sashimi selection was very unique: flying fish, char, Japanese mackerel, red snapper, chicken grunt fish, and toro. Super fresh! To end everything off, we got the passion coco dessert. Tart yogurt panna cotta, toasted coconut ice cream, passionfruit jelly...it was pure heaven. My boyfriend couldn't take the sourness but I loved it. Anyways, the food itself deserves a solid 5, but the price just really hits hard. For a student like me, the revisit value is very low, as we shelled out about $120 per person. Really not sure if the ingredients and labour was worth that money. Came out thinking: ""Did we really just spend $16 on two small pieces of toro?"" Yes. Yes we did."
/user_details?userid=5lT1GxGTIArrYbZGazAm-A,Ida K.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"We went there for lunch yesterday and sat at the bar (please make sure that u don't sneeze if you sit at the bar b/c you will sneeze directly on the fish). We got hamachi yaki roll, dancing unagi roll and the sashimi set (organic salmon, tuna, seabass, Arctic char and scallop). Dancing unagi was ok but the pieces were large and i couldnt find anything elegant about the presentation. But hamachi yaki was outright odd. There was (cooked) flaked tuna on the roll and the chef had torched the already-fully-cooked tuna!!?! The sashimi set was fine. It came with individual sauces for each fish type. The tuna was my fav of the five: the sauce was tasty and complemented the sashimi nicely. The rest were sadly not interesting at all.Overall nothing worked for me at Jun I :( the north american decoration and music gave the restaurant a distasteful vibe; they were opening pre-cooked and -marinated unagi packages at the bar when we got there and  i still can't understand why anyone would torch cooked flaked tuna..."

/user_details?userid=fiz9Y2dagXIEq0w8FGOGnQ,Andrei A.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I went to this place, solely based on the number of reviews on Yelp. Should you check it out?YESThis place is well worth the money. It's not cheap, but the ambiance, the chef, who prepares your sushi in front of you and the friendly staff are all worth it. My favourite was the Gun Kan spicy scallop sushi for $7.25. It comes in 2 pieces or 4 pieces if you order the same thing as maki. My second favourite was Funny Maki (4 pieces, $13). I loved all the food they served to be honest. It was that good, despite smaller than usual portions.Service was superb. The staff were very friendly and attentive.Presentation was just like at a high-end restaurant, with impeccable attention to detail. Well done!Now, here's why I gave this place 4 stars. My wife asked for extra ginger and they charged us $4 for it. Really? I get extra ginger for free at cheap sushi places in Toronto. C'mon, guys, not cool. I also asked for tea, which is usually complementary at most Toronto sushi places, but here they served a pot of tea and charged $4 for it. Again, not cool. Tea should be on the house and I just wanted a cup of green tea, not a pot of green tea.Other than these 2 minor irritations, this restaurant is absolutely worth checking out, because the quality of your experience will be elevated right away in comparison to ordinary sushi places you might be used to. I would like to come back to Juni next time I'm in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=ZxPp3Zq3UILBmWhvawOeGw,Jessica L.,"Flushing, NY",4 star rating,"wow, this place blew my mind. didnt know what to expect. my fiance read about this place before we went to montreal and suggested that we give this place a try. we booked in advance of course. the place was packed, we were seated right away since we had reservations. we saw two open chairs by the bar and asked if we can be switched. they gave us the menu, we skimmed through it. we asked if they had omakase (chefs special) and they said yes. it was about $75 CD$. DONE DEAL!OMG! what an assortment of fish and rolls. It was a really great bargain for that price. I wouldnt never thought about having Japanese in Montreal, not that i heard any bad stories, but they're know for french and not japanese. Anyways, everything was super fresh. I would def go back the next time i visit montreal and have time to explore places that ive been to before."

Loved every minute of this experience! Best sushi in Montreal hands down."

I love sushi but am one of those who never really got used to sashimi. I don't know why but I've tried! The only time that I was able to eat sashimi was when I was in Japan. There is something, some way that that Juni prepares or select his tuna that makes me crave it! Everything here is made and created with care, attention and respect. I love sitting at the bar watching the Chef himself prepare the sushis to order. Even watching the other sushi chefs is mesmerizing! Sure it's a bit pricey, but doesn't everything has its right value? So it is all worth it. The service is very professional and the decor is simple, purified! I would come here every week if I could! This is the perfect place to take your date out and indulge! It is so good it's sinful"

I told him that someone I know recommended this place to me and he was able to tell me what that person normally orders so that we could order the same thing if we wanted to. His memory is very good... especially to remember names of customers and hat what they usually order. He was also very nice and polite. I didn't like the first cocktail I ordered because it had too much wasabi in it so he let me order another cocktail.  I got the bloody Caesar instead it was very good! My friend and I shared everything. We got the salmon sashimi and the spicy scallop hand roll. The sashimi was fresh. I don't usually eat hand rolls. I usually just order makis but the spicy scallop was good. We had the kana age epicee (Cajun spiced soft-shell crab with avocado and cucumber), B-52 (red tuna, rice crispies, avocado and spicy mayo) , the Funny maki (fried red tuna, hamachi, avocado tooled with spicy salmon tartare) , TMT (fried red tuna, Shiso, tentsuyu sauce) . My favorite maki was the B-52 because I love the crunchiness of the rice crispies and the flavour of the spicy mayo. My least favorite was the TMT. It was very simple. The sushi was good and fresh but I've had better sushi in Montreal. Also I found that most of the makis consisted of red tuna and it would have been nice to see more variety on the menu. The best thing we ate that night was the magaru taru-taru ( red tuna tartare with black truffle oil and honey mushrooms served with taro chips). It's a must for anyone who eats here!!!!"

/user_details?userid=KYV3TpJiJB2LGN9umfmsHg,Shirley D.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Um...WOW. My friend recommended this place because she said it was probably one of the best Japanese restaurants in town. I'd say, she's right. The sushi was absolutely perfect because the fish was extremely fresh and the amount of rice used was just right. I think a lot of Japanese sushi places tend to make terrible rice, but Juni makes it well. Usually, rice is just as important as the fish. Anyways, it was not too soggy or dry, but it was also the right temperature. I was pretty darn impressed. You can definitely taste the quality. My bf and I ordered a bunch of different sushi and what I remembered the most was the bio salmon, the suzuki, and the scallop. The scallop was silky and tasted amazing! I've never tasted such texture before! I think my only complaint was the slow service in the beginning, but boy was it worth it when we got our food. I forgot about all the slowness and the hangryness once I ate a couple of sushi and makis. I also tasted one of the best desserts in my life. It was a mille crepe....I totally forgot what was in it but holy, holy it was just plain good. It was one of those desserts that aren't overly sweet, but not too bitter either. I still think about this particular dessert today and I still can somewhat remember the taste.  I really recommend any of the sushi (nigiri) and the rainbow maki. I have not tried their a la carte meals, but I will definitely come back to try those. Definitely reserve in advance because walk-ins are rarely doable at this place."

The menu options for sushi are a bit more limited than other spots, but what they offer is excellent. Only negatives were: entree/appetizers are much too small for the price (typically $20-$22/plate). Barely a morsel for each of the 3 of us. Maki were 4-5 pieces vs. the customary 6. Server didn't know that the Ippon beer he served was made in Quebec (he said it was brewed in Japan). Prices overall were somewhat higher than most- $240 for 3 people with 2 beers.

I can't manage to eat it all in one bite so I take several bites and obviously it crumbles and makes a mess. I know this is no way to eat sushi but it works for me. I had heard great reviews from this place and was dying to try it so I made a phone call to know if I could place an order and pick it up. They said yes and my mother and I were able to spend wonderful evening eating the best sushis we had in our lives in the comfort of our home and getting as messy as we wanted!The fish was tender and melted in our mouth, the ratio of rice was perfect and that rice itself was perfect, the texture, the seasoning, just amazing. We particularly enjoyed the ama ebi shrimp and the salmon (we only ordered nigiris) but they all were out of this world. I just wished it could come with only one piece so I could go more often to enjoy them on my own. Although the price is totally worth it I have to admit it was not cheap."

After all, not that many Japanese folks live here compared to say, Vancouver. So, while JunI hardly faces fierce competition in this town, this place is wonderful on an absolute scale. Not cheap, granted. But when is good sushi ever cheap? Ask the chef for omakase and you won't regret it. Expect to pay on $30 - $40 per person.   Why not five stars? The uniforms are ridiculous. Urchins are not meant to be served by waitstaff in gingham plaid shirts and bow ties.Rating Scale:1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."

I really enjoyed everything I tried (mostly maki and nigiri). They are not heavy on mayonnaise and sauces like some other places. It's on my short list of some of the best sushi in Montreal. Decor is very nice and cozy. Service is friendly and effective. The only thing I don't like is that sometimes they bring out one roll at the time. But it's not a deal breaker at all and you can always mention it to your waiter/waitress when you order. Enjoy! (Careful... Might be addictive)"

The one with the beef tartare is amazing as well! Really unique rolls served in a modern and cozy atmosphere... can't ask for more."
/user_details?userid=BcC8WQcoZqFRmpw4bSkovA,J C.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,Everything we had was delicious and fresh! Some wonderful flavor combinations I have not experienced before. A memorable meal which is rare for us. Worth the money and experience!
/user_details?userid=leZp75aVY7Ka5GOlxyKV3g,Rore T.,"Los Feliz, Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Dinner conversation with my friends over sushi at JUNI: ...um......oh God!...wow. ...holy......yes.After each mouthful, one of us would mutter single-syllable sounds; mini announcements that the food was beyond awesome. Normally, Montréal is not the place to go for sushi: we're not near any fresh water, and the city is hardly a destination for top sushi chefs. But, miraculously, the sushi at JUNI is fresh, delicious, innovative, and beautifully presented. Say things like 'uh huh' to the ""Hotate Flan"", and 'yes please' to the Rice Crispies-topped ""B-52"" and ""Dancing unagi"" futomaki-temaki. I said, 'I can die now' to the ""Umino Pannaché"", a pan-seared scallop dish served on saffron. Wine list is fine but try the unfiltered sake. It's as good as it gets.When you're done crying tears of joy, tip the staff well; they tend to earn it here."

/user_details?userid=qj8x2P16RHrgW_A5uwN0Cg,Rj P.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Found Juni on Yelp when I was looking for a sushi restaurant in Montreal.  Montreal isn't known for it's sushi establishments so I was pleased when Juni had so many favourable reviews.Since I was dining solo I decided to sit at the bar and chat with the chef while enjoying his personal selection of fresh fish (omakase).  I had a delightful assortment of sushi and sashimi - the fish was fresh, flavorful and remarkably presented - and the variety was impressive given Montreal's small sushi scene.Juni is not an inexpensive sushi joint so do not expect cheap boxes or pre-made rolls.  Juni is easily one of Montreal's Japanese gems and deserves repeated visits."

/user_details?userid=BGsgs7CIvDk7FSolKuy5GA,Heidi H.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"I recently ate here for our anniversary and for a night with friends. I have to say, the quality and attention to sushi was top notch! I tried the uni sushi, Salmon sashimi, the sea bass tartar, happy maki and spicy scallop hand roll. Btw the uni was amazing! It was amazing, hats off to the chef. Although the service was ok, and the food good, be aware they don't seem to be organised so you may need to wait to eat. I'm not sure if this is on purpose, but it gets awkward if everyone has a dish and one person has been waiting for over an hour for ebi sushi and salmon sushi.Also note, get reservations! Or for the best spot, eat at the bar and ask the chef to make you anything he feels like for the best experience!"

/user_details?userid=G422ejyfziG2xOtqgyKDWg,Didier N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I won't say that this is the best sushi I've ever been to. This title would go to Sushi Ran in Sausalito, CA. I'm also planning on going to Japan soon. I can however honestly say that this is the best sushi restaurant in Montreal by far.... until I find a better one :P. A definite 5 star!The menu is very interesting and the specialty rolls are quite inventive. Most importantly, the fish is very very fresh and tasty. Everything that we ordered was perfect. My favorite was the Salmon Gravlax, the Funny Maki and the Bio Bio salmon sashimi."

/user_details?userid=I6pNspGhpeA8W9R2bucaYA,richard s.,"Northville, MI",5 star rating,"Look if this isn't the best sushi you've ever had I will refund your money. The carefulness of the menu, the astonishing freshness of the food, the execution are all perfect. We ordered two appetizers (order the sashimi: amazing presentation) and then just had them being us what they wanted ""omekase style"". (Hint: this is nearly always a good idea if you want to end up with the freshest ""best"" fish). We ended up with mostly nigiri and sashimi (I suppose you could tell them to give lots of rolls) and it was transcendent. I worry when I go home that I just won't be happy with the sushi I've been eating. I'm ruined"
/user_details?userid=RO_dQ1ZXaElSxmM9V92kbw,Samer H.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,Another fantastic sushi place in Montreal.  Chef Jun is a master and an innovator with sushi. The funny maki is one the tastiest makis I've ever had.

/user_details?userid=1n5MMf-bXLOY6r15-bA0HQ,sheena S.,"Rochester, NY",1 star rating,"The place is highly overrated. The portions are very small, prices very high and not the best place for Sushi in Montreal too. I have had much better sushi and definitely much fresher fish in the city. And, definitely not the place if you have any allergies...My husband developed an allergic reaction in spite of us telling the waiter who took the order that he was allergic to shrimp. The waiter who served and took order are just not coordinated and when I ran to the waiter to say my husband was having an allergic reaction, the waiter told me that he was not told but the waiter taking the order was informed... It was ridiculous! When I later called the owner he shouted at me in turn saying that I didn't know what my husband was allergic to and he didnt care for any review online.The waiters and the Owners definitely dint know their fish.I would say Avoid the place!"

I've been twice before with much better experiences, but tonight received a persistent and very rude response to a reasonable and respectfully stated request. I will not be returning to this restaurant and am surprised they are able to retain customers."
/user_details?userid=U3ORHloeNfOD3XnGYc0gXA,Neal G.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"This is a real sushi place, but to get the authentic experience sit at the sushi bar.  The details are attended to very well at this resto.  For example, the soy sauce is blended with katsuobushi and kombu which softens it nicely.  The wasabi is real wasabi that has been previously frozen, which is much better than the fake neon green wasabi everyone eats in Montreal that is comprised of a little wasabi and a lot of horseradish and comes often in a powder that needs water to reconstitute.  The miso soup was delicious and made with a real fresh dashi-not a chemicalized instant that you sometimes get. Most of the fish was excellent and a lot of it was flown in from Japan.  Especially nice the day we were there was fresh uni from Gaspe.  That was amazing.  The chef is from Kyoto, and has good moves and shapes his sushi quite decently in the edo style.  There are an array of fusion items as well and the restaurant serves Thai food.  The Thai part of the restaurant is run by a Chinese/Thai family member.  It appears to be  ""Canadianized"" Thai and I have yet to try that component of their food. I am not interested too much in fusion as often the flavoris overwhelm the incredients and the subtleties of those flavors.  So I would not try Indian inspired sushi rolls myself.  Tea was so-so;  not a great quality green tea-but I have not had great tea in any Japanese restaurant aside from one great one in New york that served a very good hojicha and an actual tea ceremony style usucha made with a chasen."

/user_details?userid=PAgr1kI1tDd1kl4Yuv7LfQ,Pete F.,"South Burlington, VT",5 star rating,Soto on St.Paul (I think) was our favorite place for sushi when visiting Montreal and were very sad to see it go. Luckily we found out the chef had opened his own place called Juni on Laurier. The menu is missing a few of our past favorite dishes but it still outstanding and is a must if you enjoy sushi. Make a reservation because it is always packed and try the B52 roll that has rice crispies in it. For a drink try the Baldwin Barmacie across the street.

/user_details?userid=_WI33dzqywtDV1gxc-TgZA,I l.,"Austin, TX",4 star rating,"PROS:  Really enjoyed the sushi here. Sat at the bar and tried the carpaccio, kaiso, sake, iwana, hamachi, ikura, unagi, spicy hotate and spicy cary maki.  All amazing. The seaweed salad was memorable and fresh.  Wish Texas offered a sushi restaurant with this kind of seaweed.   Also amazing was their 1000 crepe stacked dessert.  Wow.  I make crepes at home so this was a labor of love and so good. :) Thank you!"
