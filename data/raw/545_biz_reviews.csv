As I waited for the last items to be packed into the bag, not only did the guy I was dealing with chat with me but people in the open kitchen and other servers also made me feel very welcome. I ordered a bunch of items to really get a sense of what they offer and everything was a 10/10.Well done BocaBoa, I'll be back!"

Everything was delicious (especially the piri piri chicken and cod cakes ), would totally recommend!"
/user_details?userid=jc79jshkT4J0-hlucSvBjw,Camille L.,"Houston, TX",5 star rating,"We ate here on our first night in Montreal since it's very close to where we're staying. The waitress was excellent, she took the time to tell us about the menu. I'm vegetarian and my mom is gluten free, and it was fairly easy for both of us to find things on the menu, especially gluten free. The piri piri sauce is SO good, and my mom raved about her chicken. The piri piri was a nice addition to the poutine I ordered. It's also super cute inside.Highly recommend!"

It has great reviews, is around the corner and lord knows I love frango no churrasco after living in Portugal for a couple years. While the piri-piri sauce was OK, the chicken itself was tasteless and brutally dry.  The cucumber in my salad was literally decomposing. I know these are challenging times, but when you pay $75 (including tax and tip) for a chicken, poutine, fries, a beer and a salad, it ought to be at least good if not mind-blowing. No second chances on this one unfortunately."

It was one of the few places that was still open next to our AirB&B and we were so hungry! We were worried about language barrier given we did not speak/understand French, but the waitress who had helped us was so nice and able to serve us in English (we were so relieved at this point). It's been a month since we were there now, but I believe we all got the combination chicken platter with French fries and salad. Oh boy, I never visited a Cuban restaurant before, but the grilled chicken was so good! It was well-seasoned, moist, and meaty. The complementary piri-piri sauce gave it an extra kick and heat that we wanted. The fries and salad were good as anywhere else. At the end, we asked for help on basic tourist things and the gentleman there was willing to help us! All in all, it was a good first impression on the dining culture in Montreal for us!"

I was just walking in the neighborhood and one of the locals pointed it out as the best chicken in the area. When I local goes once a week it's defiantly a place to check out. Boca Boa is a Portuguese restaurant with a Brazilian touch.  It's family owned business. The mother and son both seem to have this place well under control. There Brazilian background didn't stop them from perfecting this menu. We ordered the 1/2 Chicken and a side salad, but first we tried this must have Brazilian drink called ""Guarana"" its sweet but better tasting then  most other soft drinks (I'm usually a just water kind of guy, unless they have scotch ;) speaking of liqueur there licence is on the way just waiting for the approval! I will update my review when it happens. I do plan on being back there very soon.  Back to the chicken, you can choose between 3 types of sauce: Mild, Spicy and Very Spicy (not so very, but spicy enough to no over power the awesome flavors). If you are two and have different likes no worries you can mix two or three of the sauce, just ask for them on the side. The chicken is well grilled, not fatty at all, more on the tender & meaty side. 1/2 was more then enough for two.. I had some left to take home. The salad was large and dressing was not over kill at all. If you want it on the side as well I'm sure you can ask. Portion was very generous for the price.. Almost forgot we were in Montreal .. were I would look at a dish and think ""that's it"".. I would find one tomato and two cucumbers in all my salad. This place really puts what they describe on the menu..Carrots, peppers and tomatoes for everyone..I also could not leave without trying the Chicken Poutine with Piri Piri Sauce.  The cheese was the right on and the fries were not soggy. The the balance just right. If you happen to have place for desert lol I did force myself since the chef offered a must try and he was right on! The cream with a dash of passion fruit on top was not too sweet and fluffy. I didn't want to share it.. The service was 10/10 Malcom was welcoming, friendly and has many years in the business so he knows what he's doing. Best of all he listens to the costumers. Not on person walked in where he didn't greet them and I couldn't tell if they are all friends of his or first timers. This place is packed at lunch time since it's in a hot zone with yellow pages and a few other large companies. I really like the full garage door in the front that opens up in the summer time (yes Montreal does have summer day!)  The restaurant is clean and the art does make it cozy.  The menu is not all they have.. Seems like they have a few extra mains that change and closer to home (Brazilian dish) just ask.. They offer take out and delivery ... But I would recommend first time to go part of the experience is the service."
/user_details?userid=i-rfAdH3NLw9fzLlkc1P8w,Jay K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Ive been twice now and enjoyed it both times. First time I tried the chicken thigh plate and found it pretty delicious. The piri piri sauce was flavorful with just enough heat (3 choices of spice level) Fries are just the way I like them. Salad was good too. Second time I tried the pork sandwich. The pork was nice and juicy and basted with that tasty piri piri sauce. They have a few other choices I'll need to come back to try. All in all its a welcome addition to the neighborhood and should eliminate my need to travel to the plateau to get my Portugese chicken fix.
