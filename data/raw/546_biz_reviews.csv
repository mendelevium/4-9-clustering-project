/user_details?userid=ILe3tzgnbGSaZfpArtJdjA,Mike S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Not all Amir are the same. This one is especially good. Every time I've eaten there I've been very satisfied.Avoid the one on St-Denis... it's gross.
/user_details?userid=RpG_9KuJKrvwymua9L8VuQ,Francois M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"It used to be really good to go there now they increase the price and they reduce the size of the plates to go. 16,10 for shush taouk plate. and I don't know what happen with the potatoes but they are soggy instead of being crunchy like he used to be. And over the top the ball hair guy doesn't give you a smile and doesn't say bye have a nice day. If I ever go there again because I've been going there for the eight years if I receive the same services I will not go back."

I am obsessed with the Shish Taouk, Shawarma and the Meat Platter here!! Do get a side of the pickled vegetable salad to go with your meal for a more legitimate experience!! It is good food at a great price!!"
/user_details?userid=lmReMz3qQD-LZ30yXHeIqw,Ramiz I.,"Whittier, CA",5 star rating,"Visiting the city, went in.Nice restaurant... Tried the pita shawarma. Was really satisfying.A fast-food like setting. Your orders is finished promptly. When I was there, there was no lines. It was in the afternoon. I don't know, if it's the same at night.I'd say try it."
/user_details?userid=C0m3ky_s6V7uWfzz3514WA,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Good typical Lebanese food. Good as comfort food! Prices are fair.As mentioned, different Amirs have different quality of foods. This one is better than others!"
/user_details?userid=5wVMvCjRp2lVHvAsi15hAQ,Christy V.,"Boulder, CO",4 star rating,"This Amir location has some of the best shish taouk in the city! So fresh, flavourful, tender and delicious. I agree with other reviewers who say that not all Amir's are the same - this one is so much better than the one on St. Denis. The Shish Taouk poutine is absolutely fantastic - you get a great sodium high and it's totally worth it! I love that they have a great free water station - cold and refreshing on these hot summer days."
/user_details?userid=Bveyuu-GqeQMf8ereY2I2g,Sabrina N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Love this Amir!! They aren't all the same for some reason. I guess they are individually owned. But I will go out of my way to get Amir from here as opposed to another Amir. The quality is best, the food is fresh, the quantities are HUGE... Love this place!"
/user_details?userid=fQk6bb7F08NMb6drUxn71Q,Jay M.,"Berkeley, CA",5 star rating,"Huge quantity, pretty good quality, and overall a pleasant experience."
/user_details?userid=jv71Iloh-cvbLQkFfBKOYA,James F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I eat here once a week. Amir is a chain, but they aren't all the same. This one is good. For me it's about the potatoes, which are fresh and tasty with that garlic mayo sauce. In some places the potatoes are soggy and tasteless."
