As I really enjoy chef Chanthy's creations, it was a given that we were probably going to come here quite a bit.It is a pub & parlour style but definitely with few notches up. I have never been a fan of pub food but I was confident that this one would be different. The space is quite nice, definitely pub vibe. The staff is super attentive, helpful and courteous.The first time we came here was for brunch and we just asked that they feed us, so a lot of things came out for us to feast on: scotch egg, avo toast, french toast, eggs & sausages & dessert. The very cool thing about the fried foods here is that everything going in and out of the fryer is gluten-free friendly :) so I was happy! It was a nice surprise! I mean, I have never seen a GF friendly scotch egg anywhere before!!! Everything was delicious! The second time we came here was for dinner and wow!!!! We took bubble and squeak, beef tartar, halibut crudo, whelks on toast, butler's steak, ploughman's plate and for dessert: Eton mess and (gluten free) donut holes! Wowza! I highly recommend this place. Go give classy pub food a try ;)"

This place is great: tasteful yet unpretentious interior, extensive and classic English pub menu and a simple and well-balanced cocktail menu.The bartender we sat with was a delight: he chatted with us about the concept and explained all the creative labour that went in to the menu. As it turns out, they've made a very conscious effort to have gluten-free and vegan options which is great. We ordered the earl grey gravlax and fish and chips which were both perfect. I'm very very eager to test out the night menu. Otherwise, unsurprisingly, our bourbon cocktails were delicious.Let it be known that this is not your everyday lunch and dinner affair- the price tag was a bit more than I generally care for at lunch but I definitely wouldn't be turned away."

What a great little spot!Drink menu was tailored to the location with themed names. We got 3 different ones between us, all fantastic. Loved the bourbon one with the giant square ice cube. Service was excellent. The guys' outfits grabbed our attention. Looked sharp with the ambience.Found this place as we were strolling the area. Apparently it had only been open a few days. Highly recommend!"

It is a modern take on the British Pub like you would see in London today as opposed to the typical, dated and lousy British Pubs you typically find in North America."

/user_details?userid=MDXqulpNz_WcAJd-mclwoA,Jackie S.,"Mont-Royal, Canada",3 star rating,"My experience at Parliament was just ok. The venue is great and really easy on the eyes and the service was very good as well. Waiters were attentive and well informed. The food and drinks though were just average. Nothing on the menu stood out and my beef tartar was just ok, not really memorable. The cocktails were also pretty basic especially given that the owners are known for their cocktails at the other bar they own (Coldroom). For the price, I was a bit disappointed. I'll probably go back though if I see a new menu."

/user_details?userid=tnkBQzsRTt3gXvXqG2eURg,John R K.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Like most ""pubs"" in Old Montreal, this one isn't really a pub. There's a burger on the menu but little else that you'd expect to see (in lieu of fish & chips they had something called ""cod & quinoa). Food seemed overpriced but there were decent drink deals during happy hour. Server was friendly."
