/user_details?userid=qPGCe98rhNpG6JjZ3MO3ZQ,Viona C.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Great new noodle joint that just opened up in Chinatown and I really wish they would expand to New York eventually. It was snowing the day I went and it really hit the spot on that cold day.Menu and the ordering process is very straightforward. They provide you with a menu check sheet and you select what you want before giving back the sheet to a server. You have a bunch of drink options as well in their menu book. Order comes out pretty quickly; although the boned in meat dishes take a little longer to come out. The crossing the bridge noodles come with a line up of ingredients that you put into your broth yourself. Meanwhile, the boned in pork noodle soup has all the ingredients added into your broth before they bring it out to you. Before the broth is brought out, a bowl of thick rice vermicelli is placed before you. Best to pour in the noodles as soon as the broth comes out. The broth bowl is super hot, so be careful! There's a warning sign on the corner of the table to inform customers of the hot temperature of the dish. I really enjoyed my boned in pork noodles and was surprised that I had TWO thick chunks of pork bone in my broth. I also ordered lamb meat slices on the side! They're a little skimpy on the meat slices, but the pork bone was definitely filling enough. The rice vermicelli were cooked perfectly and had a good amount of chew to it. Broth was delicious and I really didn't want to stop drinking it. I was very content at the end of the meal; it was filling, but also super clean so I did not feel lethargic at the end. Restaurant can get really busy. I have seen lines out the door in the summer and there appeared to have a bit of a wait as I was finishing my meal."

However, this is an authentic chain from China and offered quite authentic rice noodles.Very flavorful broth, chewy noodles and yummy fatty beef, this was just what we needed on a chilly autumn day!"
/user_details?userid=RdL2kccJyn36AszC4_UU_g,Ron F.,"Brookhaven, GA",5 star rating,"I was out looking for a late night snack and stumbled on this place, since not much else was open.  I ordered a meat broth (not sure the name) and was quickly served.  The soup broth was amazing!   The piece of meat (on a bone) was very flavorful too.  My only complaint would be it was hard to eat the meat with the utensils provided (chop sticks and a spoon).  The experience was great and the food was great!!"
/user_details?userid=cF1oFZ2cl1xpQIsq-yA4mQ,Aretha C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Solid noodle joint for comfort food! The branch in Toronto always had an insane lineup so i've always wanted to try it. There was a lineup when I went, so we were seated at the same table with another party. If you don't want to be seated like that, you can say no too.I got the mushroom broth crossing bridge noodles, which is basically the classic one but elevated with lots of mixed mushrooms. They give you a huge bowl of boiling soup (which I foolishly touched, giving me a second degree burn blister for a week). DONT TOUCH IT! and then they give you a variety of raw ingredients that you toss into the soup yourself. Also it comes with noodles that you can get unlimited refills of. The soup was flavourful but easy to drink, and the noodle texture was chewy and not too soft. Delicious and affordable, but nothing mind blowing. Would definitely go again!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Definitely one of my new fave places. We tried the spicy fish soup, the beef and the pork. All of them are msg free bone based broth and they're very rich and creamy. They come with thick rice noodles which are cooked perfectly and are very chewy. The best part is that they also have a drink menu. I tried the fruits tea and it was delicious. Althought there was a lineup, we got our table after 15 minutes. The sevice is fast and the food came quickly. The staff were all nice and friendly. Would definitely come back."

It's veryyyy hot, I can tell you that."
/user_details?userid=LqywrHdM-H8gSdKtGrhBuw,Andre J.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,This new rice noodle joint is one of the best in Montreal. Went there twice already and ordered the pork bone the first time and the beef tomato the second time. I would say the pork bone was average and less of a fun experience as all the ingredients come already inside the broth. The beef tomato was pretty amazing and had me ordering a second set of noodles.
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"They are soft opening in August. We went there before dinner time, and it was not busy. The rice noodle was thick and chewy, same as it in China. The soup was white and creamy. I always like the clearer soup.The bone-in pork one has a big piece of meat. The bridge-crossing one has less meat. The base soup is all the same but by adding different flavours,  you will get the pickle cabbage, kimichi, spicy tastes etc, and different toppings also. I like to add vinegar to the soup. The soup would be more tasty and refreshing. Always have to ask for it since it not on the table. When I was first there, the restaurant was not very tidy because they opened in a rush. After the soft opening, I am sure the settings will be neat."

/user_details?userid=oqCtfkf3IcwLF7A5iLlxlQ,Andrea W.,"St. George, UT",3 star rating,"Pretty solid rice noodle shop. My friend and I came here for dinner on a weekday night, and I was thankful for the air conditioning inside as it was really hot outside. I ordered the spicy rice noodle soup, and it was quite tasty! It wasn't super spicy, but it was flavorful. The noodles were cooked alright although I would've preferred them to be a bit chewier. I like the little dishes of ingredients to put into the soup, as is usual with these sorts of noodles. All in all a pleasant experience, and the ambiance is crisp and clean, quite new. The only downside is they're cash or debit card only, and I had to go outside to grab cash. The meal came out to be almost 13 CAD, which is alright for the quality and quantity of food."
/user_details?userid=-YSbbY0cB0QIUZSBMCku0Q,Raymond D.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Came back another two times! Still loved the noodles/soup just as much as I did the first time here. I tried both the Salty Crispy Chicken (aka Taiwanese popcorn chicken) and Crispy Pork Fillet with Sichuan Peppercorn I would definitely order them again. I grew up eating the salty crispy chicken with stronger seasoning so I would prefer to have it seasoned more, but nonetheless it tasted great!I tried the Tomato Flavoured Crossing the Bridge Soup. MUST TRY IF YOU LOVE TOMATOES! Beef slices were fresh and soup ingredients were served separately which made for a fun hands on experience to add them in yourself. My only complaint was that the soup didn't come as hot as it should've to cook the beef slices but it seemed like that on the occasion. As for drinks, I ordered the Cheese Strawberry - not a huge fan but my friend who had the Fruit Tea seemed to really enjoy hers!"
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It was definitely exciting to see a new dedicated noodle place in Chinatown. Especially one that seemed to serve dishes much more similar to what you would find in China. DaGu Rice Noodles has been consistently packed on weekends, so we seized our chance this week during lunchtime. We sat down right away and peeked at the menu. They have two menus. One is a richly illustrated, nicely explained menu that would probably give a better introduction to first-timers. The other one is a one-page sheet where menu items are listed without much descriptions, with a small tick-box next to each. Since we did not get the illustrated menu, we relied on our food knowledge to navigate the rather tradditional flavors offered. We settled on pickled vegetable fish and pork bone broths for our rice noodles. We also got a Yakult strawberry shake (since the mango one wasn't available), which was surprisingly good! We received the rice noodles first, in separate bowls (probably so that they don't get soggy in the broth). The broths came soon after, and were very, very hot! A warning printed on each table is very clear: the broth is boiling hot - be careful! Although the taste was very good, the appearance of the broths were rather disappointing, as they were drastically different from the beautifully arranged photos on the illustrated menu. I'm not the biggest fan of rice noodles, but I must say that the food was quite authentic and yummy. However, we were bothered by a disagreable smell in the air, a smoky, heavy smell that reminded me of burnt metal. That strong, persistent smell didn't leave until we washed our clothes and showered later that day."

/user_details?userid=UJjTxusMKuioqBkJ71DUSA,Chelsea L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I was pretty bummed that my fav bakery was replaced by this place however, I was pleasantly surprised by their food. We got the pork soup and the bone in beef soup and it was pretty delicious. The soup was so good and it was the first time having this kind of broth. It's a little more expensive than average but you get a good piece of meat. I'd defs come again"
/user_details?userid=6zcsvCkZAlW8xJQ9vCWqYQ,Laurie D.,"Quincy, MA",5 star rating,"I wish this place was in Boston!! I ate here 2.5 hours before my flight and was anxious that I wouldn't make it to the airport on time. However, I really wanted some good noodle soup before leaving so I took the chance anyway. The waitress promised that the food would come out quickly, but I wasn't very quick to believe her. Boy was I proved wrong..the food actually came out within 10 minutes! We got the tomato soup with beef and lamb and the kimchi soup with beef. I liked most of the sides that came with it, such as the corn, fish tofu (in a cute shape of a star), bamboo shoots, the quail egg, and black fungus. The soup itself was very flavorful and I actually wasn't dying of thirst during my flight (like I usually am after eating at some hotpot and ramen places). The kimchi soup had the perfect kick of spice and I suggest anyone who likes kimchi and mild spicy soups to get this! Seriously craving it right now as I write this review. Thus, I highly recommend this place!"
/user_details?userid=Cs6ixppH0XLyslrQJGKCVA,Jean-François A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,First time trying these hot rice noodles soup. Loved it! I had the crossing the bridge noodle soup. It was delicious. Definitely coming back.
/user_details?userid=qqAFlTnr45HI3Vnf63q1RA,Carolyn H.,"Hamilton, NY",5 star rating,"The crossing the bridge noodles were delicious. I had the spicy beef, and my dining companions had the tomato and mushroom. We all enjoyed the fact that our food was not only very tasty but a lot of fun to put together. I've had crossing-the-bridge noodles in Kunming, Yunnan, and these were not exactly the same but equally delicious. I would recommend this place."
/user_details?userid=65OXLckRzDtRzdpx7G2biA,Kathy M.,"Summit, NJ",4 star rating,The noodle soup was taste and very hot hot. We came here around 6pm on a Saturday night. Had to wait about 30 minutes. Very popular place.
/user_details?userid=NkMOVXd9lb9V57tLaQ4vNQ,An T.,"Rawdon, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been to this restaurant 3x since they opened and so far I have tried 3 broths (mala spicy, pickled cabbage & fish slices, sour&spicy beef). They're all super flavourful but my favorite is definitely the pickled cabbage fish slices. It is moderately spicy but not overwhelming. The fish slices are so soft that you don't even need to chew. I love the concept of adding on your own the rice noodles & the different ingredients they give you (meat, veggies, mushroom, etc)  into a bowl of boiling soup. Theres also free unlimited refill of rice noodles! A must-try restaurant if you come to Chinatown."

/user_details?userid=vu_rXuZvIHHdrbl5zhSfdA,Jessica L.,"Fairfax, VA",5 star rating,"This place is like hot pot for your noodles. Ordered the pork bone broth with rice noodles and thought it was super delicious. It comes in a boiling bowl, so make sure to wait a couple minutes after you put all your stuff in. Overall, the place is really clean and spacious. The food came in seconds after we all ordered."
/user_details?userid=wV5vToPGUjZWAwqh3pkVVA,Carolina A.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Big portions for the price. Lots of ingredients to choose from lamb, beef, to name a few and you choose the type of broth you want from tomato to beef bone broth and you get unlimited rice noodles at no extra charge. Fast service but can get very busy after 5:45 pm might have to wait in line to get seated. I loved it n will def come back again"
