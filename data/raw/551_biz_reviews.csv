I've only had a couple of their meals but I really like them. Even their little pork pastry thing is delicious. Prices are good, service is friendly and quick, menu has lots of choices."
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This place always make me crave soup because of the delicious smell of broth that emanates from it (I can smell it from the entrance of DeSerres upstairs!).It is a nice place for a quick lunch, but I wouldn't say it's the best place for Vietnamese food in town - or the mall for that matter, now that TimeOut is here. Something in the flavors is off, especially for the pho broth (despite its nice smell). The grilled chicken with vermicelli was decent."
/user_details?userid=9KXbaM3erG-gVaQEga3xHA,Florian F.,"WHITE RIV JCT, VT",5 star rating,Went here for a quick lunch and was very pleasantly surprised. Had a tofu dish (red curry) which was extremely favour full and complex with tons of fresh veggies and spices. Would expect this from a higher end sit down restaurant but getting this quality of food and complexity of flavors was a nice surprise.
