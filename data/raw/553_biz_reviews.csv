/user_details?userid=XILA-PtHX99FNHuMIT6C2g,Sam H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We had delivery from Chez Chili and it was phenomenal. The mapo tofu is probably the best in the city, the perfect amount of Chili oil so as to not feel greasy at all. We also had the szechuan fish filets in spicy sauce and similarly excellent, the flavours we wonderful. The pan fried pork buns are through the roof good. Can't recommend it enough, will definitely be ordering again soon and trying out some of the more traditional Chinese dishes on the menu. Great ordering experience, best Chinese food delivery I've had in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=1kWaBWF8PXTwDyvNtCd9lw,Chloe L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This is the first Chinese restaurant I went to in Montréal, and it remains my favourite. They are open for takeout during the pandemic, which is a godsend in these times! Everything I've tried here is delicious and one serving is enough for two people/at least two meals, so don't be fooled by the price -- it is worth every cent! Service is pleasant and the wait staff speak both English and French and are really helpful with recommending dishes. They also have a vegetarian menu which is great! The food is mouthwatering, even my very French-Canadian partner's tastebuds can appreciate it. Our favourites are the General Tao tofu and the fillet of fish. There is also a mushroom sauté that I don't recognize all the varieties of, but is so good I crave it all the time!"
/user_details?userid=RX6BD-bKsiK3zq0dSj53Xw,Barry R.,"Revere, MA",5 star rating,"I read reviews on this and other sites going back and forth over who has Montreal's best mapo tofu. The decision was made between the two top contenders by pouring rain, that made the closer one attractive. In the heart of Chinatown, down a few stairs, I was greeted and seated immediately. The crowd was mostly Chinese. Chinese was spoken, some English was heard. No French that day.The dishes were named in both French and English. Ordering was prompt, as was delivery. As a huge mapo tofu fan, I had described the spice level I was looking for as ""hot for Canada, not for Beijing"", and found the  spice level perfect. I did not find it overly greasy, as another reviewer took exception to that. Given that the dish is wok fried tofu with minced meat, where the oil is meant to take on heat from the chilis, I thought they got it just right. Waitstaff patiently explained items to the next table, and was happy to accommodate their desire to swap out which veggies they did and didn't care for. Altogether, I was completely pleased, and appropriately tongue-numb."

Even though we arrived late in the evening the staff welcomed us warmly.On reviewing the menu I realized that we were in a really authentic Szechuan restaurant.We ordered my favorite dish the Ma Pao tofu and along with that we had the Cumin Chicken and the Spicy Chili Shrimp along with a large bowl of steamed rice.I must admit that I seem to have enjoyed the meal the most because I love spicy food but the rest of the family ate lightly...... we did order everything to be moderately spicy and I wouldn't recommend anything above that for the average Joe.I will definitely be back when in Montreal again, for those of us fellow YELPERS looking for an authentic Szechuan place I would highly recommend you try this joint out."
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Recently we went here for dinner, we had two dishes and two bowls of rice. One dish was disanxian(地三鲜) and the other was guo baorou（锅包肉）. Both of them were Northeast specialties. They were okay. Disanxian was not flavorful enough, and the guo baorou was large and thick.I paid cash and didn't ask for receipt but the price was calculated including the tips. I end up paying double tips. After I got home, I was sure the price was not right. The cashier was so sneaky and I wasn't happy about that."

We had the sweet and sour fish as well as the spicy hot pot. They were both delicious. The fish was crunchy enough without being too oily. The spicy pot had a variety of different ingredients inside. The service is quick and the waitresses are very kind and helpful. My only issue is the price. For 2 dish and a bowl of rice, it was almost 60$ after tax and tips. However, it's definitely one of my fave places in chinatown."

/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I wanted to try this place for a while as I hear of their grand variety of spicy dishes. I'm a big queen of spices, that's just runs in my blood. I've tried their mapo tofu and couple of other dishes. Their mapo tofu is okay, it's good for ""spicy foods beginners"", we've been told to request real spicy version next time. The other dishes were good too, not too spicy though, their shrimp was good and their tofu strips stir fry was amazingly delicious. Great service and the dishes were served pretty fast too, but we definitely weren't there during rush hour, it was the quiet hour. Yes, I'll come back to this place, there are definitely few more dishes I need to try."

In our quest for the best Ma Po Tofu, Chez Chili was a clear winner. But besides that, the food is delicious, reasonably priced, and comes out quickly. What more can you ask for?"
/user_details?userid=BwixB72BkKMU-b-5Gv0Shw,Tim M.,"Glenview, IL",1 star rating,"Really really not good. The soup of the day was like drinking a thick sauce.  The general Tao chicken was 80% batter with hardly any actual chicken and the sauce was bland, not authentic. The veggies were ok but the spring roll was mostly just oil and crispy roll. The tea was good but that's about it. The price was only $7.99 so that's what earns the one star but you get what you pay for and there is better to be had."
/user_details?userid=ecTZnCrYbmFEV1SRbkkseg,Joe S.,"Burlington, VT",5 star rating,"Honestly, the best chinese food I've had in montreal so far. Everything was great.

Every dish that we ordered (especially the garlic veggie noodles) was amazing. An added bonus is that they bring you a pot of tea while you wait for your food Also, the timing of the food and servers were on top of their game. Recommend this place 10/10 for great food."
/user_details?userid=Br9bkJqjKms9BjvKWZsgwA,Ali K.,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",4 star rating,The place was crowded on a Saturday noon which was a positive sign. Staff were friendly and helpful. The negative thing was the fact that they they might make a mistake when it is busy there and for me my vegetarian dish was topped with a sauce and pieces of pork meat! They changed my plate and apologied for the mistake. The food was tasty but for my my dish  oil was overused.
/user_details?userid=6sWUcQFtr8j4yuItfhabDA,Frosty W.,"San Francisco, CA",1 star rating,"We had high hopes here. We often eat Szechuan and thought we'd try this place out. We ordered the following dishes in Mandarin. The waitress spoke mostly Mandarin. Spicy fish in Szechuan sauce: This is usually one of my favorite dishes when I go to Szechuan restaurants so I am quite familiar with this dish. The dish came out suspiciously quickly. It was served in a Pyrex-like Tupperware container often seen and used in baking. The flavor was bland. Not enough chili. Barely any flavor. The quantity was decent for the price. I would not recommend this dish.Spicy chicken: This is usually my second favorite Szechuan dish. This chicken must have been lost in meat tenderizer for the past week. I literally double checked at least 5 times to see that this was chicken. It had no texture at all. Almost like eating firm tofu. It had very little flavor. They didn't use dried chilis like the dish typically calls for. They added carrots, which is not traditionally added to this dish. It was so bad, we couldn't eat more then 15% of it. My daughter who's 8 months old could eat the chicken. To me this means the chicken had the texture of baby food and was about as spicy.Tea tree mushrooms in casserole: This was decent. Pretty unique and if I'm ever feeling self-harmish and want to go back to this restaurant, this is likely what I'd order. The service: The restaurant was full. There was only a single waitress to seat people, serve people, take orders, and clean tables. We waited forever. It's not her fault. It's the restaurants fault. The tea: The tea was laughable. I included a photo of our tea. It had like 4 tea leaves in the entire teapot. Even after I let it soak for 30 minutes it tasted too dilute. It tasted like warm tap water with a hint of tea. The photo will explain. The rice: Good rice. Not over cooked. They charged over $4 for a bowl. Overall a terrible experience. Skip this restaurant at all costs."

Would come back in heartbeat."
/user_details?userid=xsvmvNG98EL3XmpCABtSGA,Connie L.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"The signature of this place is their spicy boiled fish which was actually really good and comes with generous portion. We also tried their dry pot mushroom dish, surprised by how good it tasted. I'd definitely recommend these two for now. Will go back to try other dishes soon.Location wise it is located in a basement. Generally quiet in the restaurant. If you are looking for somewhere romantic or scenic, this won't be the place for you.Food: 4.5/5, service:4/5, ambient:2/5"

/user_details?userid=00njy47jpw8fW40DOcrEew,Paul S.,"Rockville, MD",4 star rating,"Pretty authentic Szechuan/Hunan menu. Ordered the braised pork belly, Szechuan string beans, and spicy chicken and it was a very good meal. The spicy chicken was tasty, but tough to eat b/c they cut the chicken into really small pieces. I'm very use to eating chicken off the bone, but a small drummette shouldn't cut into 5 pieces, so I was spending too much time picking with bones. First time I've ever had to 'order' rice, so be prepared for that. Service was slow (food came out fast, but took too long to get water/tea refreshed), but would definitely come back."
/user_details?userid=WFP-b1Aep71xjS3TiGEC2Q,Sophia H.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"Great Chinese food. Plus, they have Dongbei food, which is not common to find (in USA, at least). My sister and I got Szechuan string beans (always an excellent dish, and this restaurant is no exception), Szechuan salt and pepper chicken (first time trying this dish and it was good. Chicken was crispy and chewy), and Dongbei eggplant with pepper and pork (first Dongbei dish for me, and it was pretty good. Light and mildly-tasting. Apparently, Dongbei foods are lighter and sweeter than other types of Chinese food). We got a medium bowl of rice, which was huge, big enough to feed a family of 4. Probably should have ordered a small bowl, which would be sufficient for 2 people, but we were starving, so no complaining there :) Cons: - You have to pay separately for rice (really?)- Pretty pricey - our bill totaled $42 (in US dollars. It was over $50 in Canadian dollars) for 3 dishes. You can find cheaper and equally tasty dinner elsewhere. I come from D.C. in USA, and it's an expensive city, but Rockville (close to DC) has great and cheaper foods than this place."
/user_details?userid=vH8UjE__eQzUUdDRu0fUMw,Lan N.,"Wichita, KS",1 star rating,"I was torn between a two star or one star.  After receiving the bill, it's decidedly one star. Of the three dishes we ordered, one was good: the tea tree mushrooms. I've never seen this on a menu before, and the dish was deliciously flavored.  It did contain thinly sliced fatty pork, which was also good. The  fish in chili broth was passable, though for the price, I'm used to getting more (in the states).  The spicy szechuan chicken dish was nothing that I recognize. Normally, the chicken  is coated, deep fried and cooked with dried chili's. The dish served looked like some  americanized  (canadianized) stir fried Chinese dish in brown sauce. Chicken was mush. Don't know how that was managed. The restaurant needs to hire at least one more person. There was one poor girl responsible for the waiting and bussing of all 6 tables.  My baby started crying as we were finishing up so I told my husband I'd wait outside. It ended up being a cold 15min before he came out. The final straw was paying $4 for rice. You're a Chinese restaurant. Rice is cheap and should never be charged.  I would not recommend wasting a meal at this overpriced inauthentic restaurant."

/user_details?userid=ITSnuLOu81doC5GGT5NMSQ,Randy T.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"[Montreal Food Tour Stop #5] Delightful place for Sichuan and Hunan Chinese food in the basement of a building in Montreal Chinatown.  The menu is large and features spicy, delicious food.  It took me a while to figure out what to order and in the end, I decided to order two dinner entrees for myself.  The restaurant accepts credit card.  Dining area is medium sized.Highlights: I ended up ordering dish D9, which is a platter of Asian eggplant, and S26, which is a platter of stir fried chicken with cumin.  I will emphasize that two dishes is way too much for one person - you will be full with a single entree.  By my foodie nature, I couldn't resist trying both even though I knew that I couldn't finish both.  The stir fried chicken was cooked well.  You could definitely taste the cumin, but it wasn't overwhelming.  Also, there was a decent amount of peppers, onions, and aromatic vegetables to provide flavor to the dish.   Certainly not a dish that's mostly onions.  I was very impressed with the Asian eggplant.  Excellent sauce, great amount of spice, and delicious ground pork with sauce.  One of the best dishes I've eaten that includes Asian eggplant.  As a note, rice needed to be purchased separately for both of these dishes.  The servers were polite and food was cooked in the promised time (around 10 minutes).  Wait times might be longer at peak hours - I went when the restaurant was empty.Critiques: The food might be better in either Hunan or Sichuan province in China.  I haven't been there, so I can't say.  I was very happy with my food though.  No complaints. Overall: I definitely recommend the eggplant dish here.  It was the server's recommendation and I agree that it's a dish that you should try."
/user_details?userid=YKm-0aMn46Yi0Re2lN1XRQ,Ivy L.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"My favourite restaurant in Chinatown by far. Been at least 10 times, tried many many dishes and I don't remember one that I did not like. All the food was very authentic, although they offer a great variety from Hunan, Sichuan, and all the way to Dongbei. The spicy dishes are definitely spicy, as they should be. My favorites are the Mapo tofu and the cumin lamb. The price is very reasonable, the service has never deceived me, and I never ever had to wait in line. Very hard to resist going there and to instead try other places every time I go to Chinatown. Highly recommended."
/user_details?userid=laaC_7aQ5mWm6BNSfHJ8fA,Nachiket P.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Situated at the corner of Rue Clark & De la Gauchetière, Chez Chilli is almost tucked into a basement. They specialize in Hunan-Sichaun Cusine. The place seems to be clean, which is a plus for any Chinatown restaurant. Service is quick and friendly. Food is delicious & portions are huge. We ordered the spicy fish filet, Spicy chicken & spicy eggplant with pork. They use a lot of dried red chillies in most of their dishes. So when they say spicy, they MEAN spicy. The fish was really good. Tender & spicy. The spicy chicken was great too. Crispy fried with bone in. The eggplant with pork was good. Look out for the 2 hot green peppers in the eggplant dish. They are very spicy. So If you are feelin brave (or stupid) enough to try some super spicy but tasty food, Chez Chilli is for you.P.S. - They do take Credit / DebitFood -  GoodService - Friendly & QuickAmbiance - Clean (It matters in Chinatown)Worth the money - Yes"

China Cafe, a Michelin starred is one of our favorites in NYC and this place is probably on par minus the presentation/decor/price tag. Service was a bit slow, but sufficient. I give the servers props for having such good attitudes when there was only 2 of them for the whole packed restaurant. Per other Yelpers' recommendations, we ordered the following dishes:Sauerkraut fish- Milky spicy fish with Chinese pickled vegetables (fish fillets served in a casserole dish with milky soup)Mapo Tofu- no explanation neededDongbei three treasures?-Essentially eggplant and peppers with minced meatEverything was super delicious. We ordered it less spicy and it was still too much, but that's hard to gauge. Just know the spicy level is not for the light-hearted. Rice costs money, but tea is free.Side note, the street is also kind of fun to walk through with tons of options for snacks!"

We were looking for a decent inexpensive Chinese restaurant and this was our 2nd attempt to find one.  It was MUCH better than our first. The twice cooked pork was excellent, but portion was on the smaller side.  The salt and pepper chicken was excellent as well and the mixed vegs with glass noodles was a nice foil for the other two spicy dishes.  Rice costs extra ($1.25?) but unlimited tea and fortune cookies are included.  The service was excellent and very attentive. The dishes were described in detail when we asked, and were able to substitute regular noodles for the glass by just asking. We liked it so much we went back a second time.  A true gem in a sea of mediocrity."

We ordered hot and sour soup, which was neither hot/spicy, or too sour, but was loaded with tofu, mushrooms & egg. The Mao's pork with bok choy was savory.

I wouldn't say it's the best Chinese food I've had but then again it's hard to find something decent in Montreal.The Ma Po Tofu was very spicy, though lacks ""Ma"" (the numbing effect). The Hunan lamb was well executed: tender thin slides of lamb, heavy on cumin as someone here mentioned (+1), and an appropriate amount of vegetables that enhanced the dish. I would return for the Sichuan lamb.Order dishes to share as a group and you'll get an abundance of real food. Cards accepted, even AMEX."

One dish that stood out, the sizzling lamb, blew away all of our expectations and guarantees that we will make a return trip. My only reason for giving four stars instead of five is due to the corn soup being very mediocre. Other then that I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes spicy Chinese food."

/user_details?userid=nLvssaSephFYKHVjMd0XFg,Benjamin C.,"Brooklyn, NY",3 star rating,"Looking for some warm Chinese on a chilly day! We walked around China Town looking at menus and came upon this place....mostly because the General Tso's was on special for $7.99. (Comes with rice and soup.) You go down stairs to enter the restaurant. Nice little set up...fairly typical décor. After asking about the lunch special (s), we went with the General Tso's (GT) and Pork with Spicy Garlic. I requested the General spicy, as it's strangely not regularly and the Pork was already noted as such. The Pork was decent and the GT was ok. Neither was particularly spicy and 0 spice was detected in the GT. It did taste fresh/healthy, though, which to be honest, is not what I look for when ordering General Tso's. Interesting side note: Pizza was delivered while we were eating, at which point the entire staff gathered around a table in the dining room to eat. It seemed as though service was on hold during that time. In conclusion, the experience was kind of pricey for a bland meal. We also received no soup, but did not request it since we weren't impressed with the entrées. Probably better options within the block, but maybe our experience was unique."

/user_details?userid=jvcRCpJBgvvFPylOiiRdzA,Alvin B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"They have a great menu which focuses mainly on spicy Sichuan or Northern Chinese cuisine. I come to this place quite often for the eggplant with pork and black beans. Yes it's in a basement, but don't let that turn you off. It's fairly clean with a chill and relaxing atmosphere. The prices are reasonable. The staff are friendly, helpful and bilingual."
/user_details?userid=qZn4-4_ApTfiJHRTSwJAlQ,Sylvain P.,"Victoria, Canada",4 star rating,"If you're looking for something much better than a big chinese-american buffet this is the place to go. This place is clean (it's not always the case in chinatown!) and the food are well offered. The way it works is everyone order a plate and everybody on the table take a piece of it. The crusty chicken was delicious and the fish and shrimpt were very good. So if you're looking to real chinese food this is the place, i'll come back !Si vous chercher quelque chose de différent que les buffets americano-chinois, c'est le resto ou il vous faut aller.Le restaurant est propre (ce n'est pas toujours le cas au quartier chinois!) et les plats biens présentés.Chaque personne commande un plat et toute la table en prend une portion. Le poulet croustillant était excellent, et le poisson et les crevettes très bon.  Donc si vous désirer de la vrai nourriture chinoise c'est l'endroit ou aller !Je vais  revenir !"

/user_details?userid=ZGiwU16rhGvWAYUzkWL0xw,Boz X.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Probably one of the best chinese places in Quebec, especially if you like spicy food. I can't say the flavours are 100% authentic, but the food sure taste brilliantly good. Downside is, there seems to be two chefs in the kitchen: a head chef and a cook. The cook is probably an apprentice who cooks only certain dishes. Either that, or his taste and mine don't align."

We asked for cumin on the chicken and they did as we asked. Order the spicy green beans, they definitely live up to the name and they're delicious! They're coated in some sort of addictive spicy meat sauce. The food is super filling and cheap and although it was still nicely busy in the establishment on a Friday night it wasn't nearly as annoyingly overcrowded as some other restaurants in Chinatown. It was hard to stop eating even though we were so full. I recommend going if you're in the area."

Although the restaurant is downstairs - the lighting was bright and clear and CLEAN. The prices were a little bit higher than we expected but it was worth it!We ordered the corn soup to start - the waiter (who was alone!) poured each of us our bowls! The corn soup was like any corn soup you get from a Chinese restaurant. We then ordered the Spicy Fish Fillet, Sweet & Sour Pork (Which was the bomb.com) and Seafood Fried Rice. Everything that we ordered were so good! The Spicy Fish Fillet was cooked to perfection that it wasn't rubbery but soft and can taste the spiciness of the chili. The sweet and sour pork was also very delicious! It is very different from the other version I have tasted(Toronto). This version was just so distinct that the sweet and sour pork from TO cannot compare! Lastly, the seafood fried rice was soooo good we ordered it twice! I would recommend coming here for Chinese Food if you ever visit Montreal."
/user_details?userid=FuW1EwnbQoHyDMeOGrljsg,Khanh L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I decided to try something different...And while I generally want to try lots of new restaurants, it seems of late, it's more miss than hit.It's a new place at the corner of la gauchetiere and clark, in chinatown, it's a basement place so you have to walk down. The decor is very modern chinese zen, with chinese cities written on the wall in caligraphy, a nice touch.We ordered hot and sour soup, tofu family style and some stewed pork belly. I've been dying to order pork belly for a long while, and you don't often see it on the menu. The taste overall is bland to too salty. The soup was a bit liquidy, so there was a problem with every dish, don't know if it's an off day with the chef but it was not spectacular.The pork belly was a bit lukewarm, I would have preferred it more hot, and the taste was somewhat bland, I think it could have use more caramelization and more salt.The sauce for the tofu was a bit too salty, even with rice it was hard to take. The soup had good taste and flavour, but needed to be thickened a bit...however the bowl was huge and cost only 8$, and it could easily feed 6-8 ppl.Like the soup, bring the soup. :)"

I tried a sweet and sour soup and spicy beef ragout. The soup was above average even though it could have been a bit warmer. Unfortunately the beef was very chewy (taste of the sauce was good). I asked the waiter if this is supposed to be like that and he was very nice, explained to me that Chinese like it like that and asked me if I wanted to try another dish. Tried the Sichuan prawns with different kinds of meat. This dish was very good. Portion was quite large."

/user_details?userid=5Ymfsf9fAYz-Ds_p0xawVQ,Anthony K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"First off:  Chez Chili does not (I repeat: does not) have skillet queso or chicken club tacos on offer.  If you're looking for Chili's, you'll have to look elsewhere.Secondly:  Chez Chili is not easy to find.  If you're looking for the entrance on Clark, you'll be out of luck--you're going to have to swing around to de la Gauchetière to find a way in.  And it's tucked away in a basement, so the address is actually ""1050-B.""Thirdly:  Chez Chili's decor ranges from the Sinological to the surreal.  The walls are adorned with boldly graphic cultural lessons.  Off in one corner, however, stood a lonely half-size traffic sign (""SLOW"") that appeared to have been transformed into a clock.  A broken clock.  Eat your heart out, Salvador Dali.Now that we've dealt with those pressing issues...  Chez Chili features a menu that represents three distinct regions of China with three distinct cuisines:  Hunan, Sichuan, and Dongbei (a.k.a., Manchuria).  Montreal's Chinese New Wave has been spearheaded by Sichuan cuisine and, to some extent, Hunan cuisine.  If you're looking for a Manchurian candidate, Chez Chili just might do the trick.In typical Chinese fashion, the menu at Chez Chili is fairly extensive, and I've yet to figure out what all the hits and misses are, but a fairly random survey turned up a couple of exceptional dishes, and a number that were less so.The great:  the Sichuan lamb with onions and cumin was a stone-cold winner--the kind of dish that has you thinking about ""the next time"" even as you're eating it for the first time; there was also a mushroom casserole (Hunan, I believe) that was really squeaky (you'll see what I mean when you start chewing), but also really appetizing, and a welcome vegetable dish.The good:  spicy chicken knuckles could have been more generous on the meat-side, but was near-hallucinatory on the spice side; twice-cooked pork was just good, as were the dry-fried green beans.The forgettable:  Dongbei-style cabbage with glass noodles looked interesting, but was strangely bland; fried chicken strips was like a Chinese chicken schnitzel covered with chilis, which sounds pretty great, but, unfortunately, was characterless.I could see my rating for Chez Chili going up once I've had the chance to explore the menu a little further (I'm sure there are more gems in there somewhere), but for now...Worth checking out?  Absolutely."

We ordered a plate of lo Mien noodles (I mean how can you go wrong with pasta right??) it was horrible! The noodles were basically ramen noodles not  thick pasta like it should be. It was also cold and not very tasteful . We also ordered some sweet and sour fried pork and it was basically breaded pork grease. There was almost no meat in the pork strips just total disappointment .. I'm from Florida and Chinese fast food places over there would put this place to shame. On top of that it was very pricey.

/user_details?userid=NtCaWVg6MU1jikn6FKHp4w,Harley C.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"A cute little spot with very eclectic dishware. Our food was served in 2 Pyrex dishes, on a square plate, and on a round flowery grandma-esque plate. Nothing wrong with that, but just worth noting.As for the food:-Hot and sour soup: nice and spicy, strong sour notes, and big enough for four or more.-Fish in chili oil: good ma-la character, lots of chili oil, and some surprise glass noodles in the bottom of the dish. Worth ordering for sure.-Family style tofu: a nice dish of tofu and wood ear fungus in a mildly spicy sauce. Tasty and abundant.-Spicy green beans: definitely some spicy kick, they were cooked just the way I like them. Very enjoyable.The menu has some translation issues - I did see some white folks order ""beef stripes"" assuming they meant beef strips, when it was actually beef tripe.

/user_details?userid=re2yiwnX2S9xTcgxFYrofg,Scott D.,"Providence, RI",4 star rating,"If the ambiance was better we may have gone for 5 stars but the place is a bit plain and over-lit for a date.  More suited to family or friends who will accept the austerity in favor of good, freshly prepared food.We ordered a hot and sour soup to share.  Fortunately it never came because we would never have had room for it but we were a bit surprised when the entrees started coming out just the same.  It's also a bit odd that there are no appetizers on the menu other than soup.  We would have liked to start with some.On the positive side, the Ma Po Tofu was the best we ever had, the fried rice was light, fluffy and flavorful while not greasy or loaded with soy sauce, and the green beans with minced pork were cooked to perfection.  We also tried the lamb with onions and cumin that other Yelpers raved about.  It was good and loaded with meat but for us a bit tough and heavy handed on the cumin.  Still we ate and enjoyed it... just not a top pick in our estimation.The menu is full of unusual sounding things but it doesn't do much to describe them in much detail - especially if you don't speak French, but chances are that you'll find plenty of reason to return as long as you're willing to take some chances.It's important to note that even though we arrived late the food was served fast and super-fresh... clearly nothing was reheated.BTW... we were the only Caucasians in the place... a very good sign of authenticity."

First things first, we came here because a few days ago we had went to china town and went to some restaurant that was just delicious. A total gem. We figured we'd go walk around China town again to see if we can find another amazing restaurant. We ended up stopping here because it looked pretty good from outside, and it had a poster on the window that said ""Yelp users LOVE us!"" We said hey, why not, let's give this place a try. We got there and ordered our food (General tao chicken, sweet and sour fried pork, chow mein, and fried chicken rice.) When the food arrived we noticed that not only the noodles were super cold, but that it was super generic. I sincerely thought it was ramen noodles. The rice was okay, but I've had way better at fast food Chinese restaurants. The general Tao and fried pork were super greasy and had excessive fat that we didn't even finish it. Not to mention we were super hungry and could've easily finished it it was decent enough. We then finished and paid, and it was outrageously expensive! 60 something dollars for gross food that we couldn't even finish and that's we could've got elsewhere with better food and for half the price. The best part about this place was my drink solely for the fact that I was dehydrated and you can't mess up water. Don't go unless you really want to see the disappointment for your self. Thanks"
