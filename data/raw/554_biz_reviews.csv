/user_details?userid=BMUHVq9VRvBNHGw48ZH-fQ,Emma N.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"I moved to the neighborhood in August and have ordered take-out from La Caract√®re Chinois many times and have not been disappointed once. I love their shrimp pad Thai, it has the perfect amount of spicy. I've also dined-in and it has a beautiful little cozy atmosphere and a nice outdoor area to eat in the summer."

/user_details?userid=dW_TrJGAkyTCvI2FQiH4PA,Anh-Tuan T.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"After going to the little corner store just opposite, we swung by just to see the menu and wound up deciding to scrap our pasta plans for the evening. At the urging of the very kind waiter, I tried the duck roll. Oh. My. God. Tender, delicious duck is a force on its own, but what happens when you wrap it in a Vietnamese-style fried spring roll? PLEASE go and find out. To boot, I had the Thai rotisserie chicken. Oh. My. God. Chicken and pork make up the majority of my diet and I think this was the best chicken I've ever had. Unfortunately, the chicken was served with old, dry rice and a weird medley of candied carrots and daikon (this is what lost them a star). I just moved all that junk to the side and relished in my chicken. If the meat wasn't as good as it was they would probably only check in at two stars.BYOB! Really nice ambiance, too."
