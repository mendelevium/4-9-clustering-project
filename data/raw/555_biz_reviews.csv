I loved everything from the colours to the choices of furniture. Service was joyful, which is always a plus especially nowadays. I wanted to add a pastry but didn't know what to choose and they suggested the perfect combination ( I can't recall the name of this Italian specialty unfortunately).They also have a terrasse that I can't wait to try next summer... I will be back!"
