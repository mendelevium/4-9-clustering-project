/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Back home in Pakistan we have a tradition of eating Samosas with our evening tea. So naturally at a completely inconvenient hour (4 am in Montreal) I was suddenly craving them. Uber Eats was delivering late so decided to order Vegetarian Samosas from Mumbai Masala! The Samosas had an authentic and delicious flavour. Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! It came with two types of Chutneys/Sauces. Both were spicy and tangy! Loved my midnight snack! Will definitely be trying other items soon!

Otherwise this place gets 5 stars! The green chutney though was so good but he gave us just 1 small container so ask for more if u are ordering tandoori chicken. And oh! We ordered 3 legs and it came with 3 drumsticks and thigh portions and maybe one small wing too! We also ordered two chicken curries, one was butter chicken and the other chicken Rogan josh. The dark red color we think was good and spicy which was amazing! And the rogan josh (more saffron coloured gravy) was more flavourful so both the curries were bomb! Also for the price this is such a good deal in Montreal for Indian spicy food!"

But you can also get it not spicy or less spicy. The sauce was mmmmm, naan was hot, rice was sufficient, chicken was adequate.P.S. I'm also a bit biased since curry is my fav food"
/user_details?userid=Dfu-NuG1YWB96jjBLIlsrA,Krysten I.,"Honolulu, HI",5 star rating,"It gets frigid in Montreal. Who wants to leave the warm house to go get food at 2am when you're hungry but have nothing in the fridge?? No one. To fill that emptiness in your possibly hungover stomach? Ubereats, of course!! It only costs $5 to deliver piping hot food to your door! None of this getting dressed for the sub zero temperatures or freezing your toes off shuffling through the snow or cracking your head open when you fall on ice. Food to your door for $5! So worth it! I downloaded the app and had a hard time verifying all my credit card info and this and that, that when I ordered from Mumbai Masala, I forgot one dish. Oh well, maybe there will be a next time. :) I ordered a whole bunch of things for my friends and I to share..... butter chicken special, dahl, cauliflower, etc. They even have lassi on the menu! The food arrived hot and packaged so neatly. As we unwrapped our food like the hunger ridden lazy bones we are, I realized that we didn't get the rice that was supposed to be included with the special combination sets. So I call the restaurant and ask about my rice. The workers (owners, I think) who answered the phone were apologetic and wanted to make things right. I felt bad, but at the same time, I'm from Hawaii. I eat rice with every meal, every day! I needed my rice!!The guy on the phone takes down my address and delivers it to me. This is all at 4am, mind you. I didn't have to step outside once. Thank you, kind sir, for delivering rice to me. Insignificant as it may seem, I greatly appreciate your effort and dedication to running such an ethical business. Honestly, thank you. I know how cold it is out there. Dine here! Or at least get Ubereats when you're too cold to walk outside and get food!"

His attitude alone is what makes me want to be a repeat customer.I have never had an issue with their food, and everyone I take to eat there has also very much enjoyed it.The only issue I have with them is that their hours tend to be a little weird and kind of in consistent.I absolutely love this place."
/user_details?userid=RZUrmsaUiFKmZQvxuuk4UQ,Madhu K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This is relatively a new Indian place on St. Laurent. They have special lunch meals or special for the day which are resonalbly priced. However, if you end up ordering separately from the menu, it becomes an expensive place. In addition, the service needs a lot of improvement. One of their servers did not even know how to pronounce the names on the menu, and had no clue what was in the dish!! And they take forever to serve the food after the orders, even when there are not many people in the restaurant. On enquiring about the delay, the server said that there are lot of foodora orders!!!"

Both can made on a ""spicy scale"" and the medium spicy was perfect. Very friendly service and worth a short wait as the food was prepared to order."
