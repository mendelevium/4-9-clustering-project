/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Location: In the Quartier Latin. Street parking is metered but good luck finding a spot because that area is a disaster. Your best bet is to use transit - Berri is the closest subway stop and then it's a short walk after that.The place: It's kind of dated in terms of decor and reminds me of a restaurant one might've frequented in the 70s or something. Not to say it's not cozy - it's just dated. Wood everywhere. Kind of lacks a vibe. The goods: I don't know much about beer so I won't go into technical details - I'll leave that to the connoisseurs. I ordered a beer with citrus undertones (I forget the name but it was literally the first one on the menu) - for someone who doesn't particularly care for beer, I thought this was quite nice! They have a good selection that should cater to everyone's tastes.Service: Good - our waitress was quick and friendly!Price point: My date paid so I'm not sure what the average cost of a beer here, is. They did have two sizes though. This is a good spot to take it easy in on a cold winter day."

/user_details?userid=qZn4-4_ApTfiJHRTSwJAlQ,Sylvain P.,"Victoria, Canada",4 star rating,"After 2 years i came back to this little micro brewery. Theres enough  space unlike little pub on St-Denis street, so that you can find a space almost anytime.Even if they didn't offer lots of beers, they are very tasty and good and they never rush you to order.I taste a VOLLBIER ( wich mean real beer in german as in a WW2 they couldnt use lots of hop so they usually did 4% beer and when they could do 5%or more beers they yelled vollbier!!) a lager german type. And Even though i didn't have a sweet tooth i like it much even if it has a caramel aroma and barley sugar taste. I taste their Czech-style beers before and it's very good too. A nice spot if you want a good beer on St-Denis street !Je suis revenu dans cette petite micro brasserie que je n'avais pas visité depuis 2 ans. Il y a assez de place avec l'étage pour que vous puissiez y aller sans que ce soit plein presque tout le temps. Bien qu'ils n'offre pas beaucoup de bières, les bières sont vraiment bonnes, et vous ne vous sentez jamais bousculé de commander  rapidement.j'ai dégusté la VOLLBIER (ce qui veux dire vrai bière en allemand lors de la 2ème guerre les brasseurs ne pouvaient utiliser beaucoup de houblons et ne sortaient que de la bière 4% et lorsqu'ils pouvaient ils sortaient une vrais bière à 5% et ils criaient Vollbier !!) une lager d'inspiration allemande, et bien que je n'ai pas une dent sucré, bien qu'elle ait un parfum de caramel et un goût suave de sucre d'orge j'ai bien aimé !J'ai déjà goûté leur bière d'inspiration tchèque et elle est très réussi ! Un bon petit spot si vous voulez boire une bonne bière sur la rue St-Denis !"

They have some pretty unique beers, not easily found in any other places. Their menu is different from your typical pub/brewery, worth trying especially if you're hungry. It's super chill place to meet up with friends or colleagues, and their service is always friendly. Definitely check it out if you're in the area."
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"If you're in Montreal you HAVE to come here. As one of the leading microbreweries in the 514-this venue will not disappoint! with a rotating  seasonal menu of beers including local and worldwide blondes, lagers, IPAs and stouts. Feeling beer curious? - try a beer flight for 11.50$ including tax for 4 different beers (3.5 ounces each) or from the pre-selected menu. The terasse had a smaller menu for drinks compared to what I have tried previously. For the tantalizing meat lovers menu - there are great burgers including the rare deer, bison and rabbit burgers (so good with their home fries!) the kitchen closes at 22h00- noooooo! after all you get is olives to eat as bar food lol, however you can bring your own take away to their site without problems. Service was kind of slow but picked up once we got the drinks. Our waitress, Marie- Lynn, was friendly to inform us about what bars are popular around the block! Crowd was kind of annoying as you'll see a lot of loud drunk college students typical of the st- Denis scene on a summer Friday night!This visit I discovered the terasse in the back which was a secret garden! Loved it! Small but seats around 15-20 people easily - fun for birthday events!"
/user_details?userid=-ZqPTpx9TyyvdAWbajdilA,Jessica S.,"San Diego, CA",4 star rating,"This was our second stop on the craft beer tour. We didn't spend as much time at this location as we did at the first stop, but we saw and tasted enough for me to know that I was a fan.Our group had the second floor (near the restrooms) all to ourselves (if you don't count the patrons coming up to relieve themselves, that is...) We gathered around the small tables that were set and ready for us: glasses for our beer samples and napkins for our food samples.The first beer we tried that night was the Czech lager, the Černá Hora. Having just visited Prague in April - complete with a beer tour there, of course - this one made us both smile. It was what our Prague tour guide would have referred to as a ""bright"" beer, meaning it was light in color, but bold in flavor. It had a complex flavor that changed once the food sample - an unpasteurized cheese square - was introduced. We dutifully sipped the beer, tasted the cheese, then sipped the beer again to experience how the flavors changed once the cheese had coated our palates. It was good. It was smooth. And thankfully, there was lots of it.The second beer at this stop (fourth on the tour) was a hefeweizen, which was paired with a razor-thin slice of spiced meat. The whit beer didn't really stand out for me - it was just like any other wheat I've had in the states - but I do remember liking it. The meat was different; it was spicy without being greasy, and neither of us could really place the spice itself. I'm pretty sure our guide told us what was different about the meat (which he had termed as ""funky""), but I honestly don't remember.The restaurant itself is pretty wide open and bright, with at least three levels. The bathrooms are clean, and the employees are friendly. We didn't get a chance to come back here, despite the fact that it was three blocks from our hotel, but we did want to. We just ran out of time..."

The bar has plenty of seating options but all the outdoor ones were taken, good thing the beer was superb. We basically tried everything they had (well 2-3 pints each, more then 7 people). I loved their black lager, it was my personal favorite. We didnt try the food, only fries which were great. Defiantly a pub to re-visit"

/user_details?userid=9bvlW5Gos1kxzvcM3c-12w,Don P.,"Hampden County, MA",4 star rating,"This is one of my favorite micro-brewery stops when I am in Montreal. The reason is it is one of a handful of MB""s that has a ample selection of Pilsners, Lagers and Helles unlike most MB that are predominately Ale driven. My favorite is the Cerna Hora, a Czech style pilsner which is wonderfully done and I'm told that it is supplied to the local Czech Consulate, I'd say that is a ringing endorsement. This little brewery packs a big punch and should be on your beer tour list when visiting the city."
/user_details?userid=t903_es-gp3abvdrIQutQA,Jeremy K.,"Stoughton, MA",4 star rating,"Conveniently located on Rue Saint-Denis, in a high traffic area of downtown Montreal, this microbrewery in another gem which serves as a testament to Montreal's blossoming beer scene. Although not as good as Dieu du Ciel, this place is still well worth checking out, and I've had one of the greatest beers that I've ever had the chance to consume there... ever. Like seriously, they must have brewed it with some crack or something, it was incredible and the depth of flavor was mind-blowing. The beer in question, called Célébratus, which is a weinzeboch, German-style ale with hints of candied fruits, spices and even cloves is a must-have for anyone and everyone. That beer aside, there's plenty more that they have to offer, but none of them that came as close to that one - They have Imperial ales, Porters, Czech-inspired brews and even a wide-range of hefe weizens. Their Vollbier, a münchen-type of lager was pretty good with strong hints of caramel and almond. Tasty stuff let me tell you.The place just managed to impress and the decor and setting is rather unique, with some light wood tones everywhere and a dim lighting. It's actually pretty nice, quiet and comfortable there. The modern furniture blends in and they have two floors. The bathrooms are clean and there's even a chalkboard over the urinals in the men's bathrooms in case you get bored or inspired as you break the seal. In case you get hungry, this place has you covered as well. They have tapas, which range in price from $2.25 for a small plate of olives to $12 for nachos. In the midst of these are plates of welsh rarebits, empanadas and even some gravlax. Oh and don't let me forget their onion soup. Heartier and more expensive entrées available are osso bucco ($14), fish and chips $13 and a bunch of other dishes. They even have crème brûlée for desert. But who are we kidding, you're here to drink, aren't you?"

They don't have as many beers on offer as say, Le Saint Bock, but what they do have is pretty decent- I particularly love their flights, which focus around regions (Czech-style, for example), and they have a great casual atmosphere with plenty of seating for singles, large groups, and everyone in between."

Bottom line is that this place has been making their own beers for years and it has not changed.  Why? Because it works! Very simple place for people that enjoy a good brew, conversation, and a feel for Montreal. Come one come all! I'll meet you there! I had the Fin de Siècle IPA that was really good and the sausages with home made mustard were on point. Okay, I need to get back to this plate of food... :)"

/user_details?userid=c2BbxDdn6QTy33682gQDvQ,Ju L.,"Osaka, Japan",4 star rating,"This is a fun, relaxing pub to get an interesting dinner and try some local Quebec beers. The crowd is overwhelmingly locals in their early-20's. Menu is small plates plus burgers.L'amere a Boire has more of a pub feel (dark, loud) than a restaurant feel. No one greets you upon entering - confusing since they have 3 levels of seating. Just wander in and find a table. If you go to the top level, order food and drink at the bar upstairs. Elsewhere, a waitress will (hopefully) discover you and come over.The first time we came (11pm, a Thursday), we were informed that the kitchen was no longer open. ""No food at all?"" ""No, sorry."" Frowny face. We decided to stay for beer. Later, the waitress came to our table and said they had ""chips and dip"" (nachos et trempette, $8). Maybe it was because of how ravenous we were, but the dip was brilliant - light as sour cream, indulgent with cream cheese, herbed and with a robust flavor that tasted much like hummus - but cooler and sweeter. Loved it.The next night, we came back at 7pm to actually try the food. It was PACKED! Eventually we found a table and ordered the rabbit burger (burger de lapin, $11), lamb spring rolls (rouleaux ""brick"" de gigot d'agneau, $10), and a bowl of frites ($4.50). The frites are just brilliant. I guess this is the norm for Montreal??!  The rabbit burger came with grilled zucchini and sprouts. I wasn't a big fan, but perhaps I just don't appreciate rabbit being ground into burger. The lamb spring rolls were fresh, thoroughly lamby, and crunchy with minty yogurt dip. Do the right thing and wrap your roll in the lettuce before dipping and consuming. Delicious.  The beers we had were also fabulous. L'amere a Boire's own ""Montreal Hell"" is bitter but citrusy and clean-tasting. Recommended if you like German beers! Their ""Celebratus"" was also great - dark and cinnamonny, but not very heavy at all. I also tried an amber ale whose name I've forgotten, that tasted very similar to the Celebratus.The beers have different prices according to type, size (12oz, 20oz, or pitcher) and time - check my photo (yelp.com/biz_photos/l-am…). All food and drink prices on the menu already include tax. Only one thing about L'amere bothered me. Our waitress kindly asked us to settle the bill after finishing our food (but not our beer), because her shift was ending. We gladly did, but 30 minutes later when we were about to leave, her shift apparently still had not ended. ???"

After ordering the same beers as my last visit (Weizen, Cerna, and Drak), I told myself I HAD to try something new next time. I was chit chatting with the bartender about a few of their other beers and I was curious about ""Montreal Hell,"" the bartender was nice enough to fill me up a little taster glass on the house to quench my curiosity. I wish I caught his name... but it's always great service like that, as well as constantly pushing great product, that makes loyal customers. I truly love this gem of a pub!"

All really different, complex, yet totally drinkable beers. The food was good too. I had a salad and my friend had duck and both were delicious. The restaurant itself is small and got really packed and quite loud but the ambiance was not negatively affected by how loud it was. All in all it was a great place!"

This was easily the best service received among my beer stops this weekend. The server explained all the beers, was quick to offer re-fills and checked in on us regularly. Unlike the other beer pubs visited, you can run a tab. Tourist alert - servers speak English. I love the look of this pub, exposed brick and lot's of woods. They have three floors so the place doesn't have the same crowding feel as others. Tall ceilings provide a loft feel. The layout also ensures you can have conversations with your friends without screaming. Now for the beer. They had about 10 - 12 house beers on tap if I remember correctly. Beers are slanted towards lagers. Had a chance to taste most with the following standouts: HEFE WEIZEN, Montreal Hell and one or two others that I cant remember the names of. No one in my group enjoyed the cask selection though. You can order sample size, pints or pitchers of your fav. beer.They are also building an english version of their website so fellow tourists can do their research before arriving.I will definitely return on my next visit to Montreal.  Some Montreal brew pubs may offer increased selection or even better beer in some cases - but none offer the great overall experience of L'amere A Boire.

It has a relatively small beer selection, but what they have competes well with local brewpubs, especially the Cerna Hora and L'amere A Boire beers. It's tough to get a table at peak, hours though. Also a note for tourists: this place (and to a lesser extent the surrounding area) is more French then you'd encounter in the rest of downtown."

I personally liked Drak a lot! I found the Rousse too florally, where as the Drak had more of a cut to the chase personality of a beer, meaning, no floral, no fruit, it doesn't try to get complicated.I like that this bar had two floors, it gave it a nice airy openess instead of feeling crowded.  They also serve food there. the server was very nice and attentive to my friends watering needs."

I ended up sampling some of the Drak and a Rousse, both of which were enjoyable.The menu is kind of strange, but has a variety of options and they're affordable too. If you're vegan, I don't think you'll have much luck here, as most of the menu consists of some sort of animal product. There is a veggie burger, but when it was asked if the burger was put on the same grill as the meat, apparently it was. If you wanted to have it on a separate grill, you had to request to do so- that shouldn't be the case. That's my one complaint about this place, being a vegetarian and all.My group ended up ordering the nachos, and the portion was large enough to be shared amongst ourselves. It was piled high with cheese, olives, hot peppers, and came served with salsa and sour cream.The atmosphere of this place is great, even if it gets really noisy sometimes. The ceilings are high, and there are three levels with tables to sit at.

For a menu reference (which is completely in French), it is on an orange page with a peculiar picture featuring a collage of what could be considered ""revolutionary"" images.4.75$ for a glass, which is pretty reasonable.I asked which beer the bartender would recommend for me between two I was looking at.

He's obviously not the only one who thinks so though, since it's pretty much always busy.While the sidewalk patio smack dab in the heart of the Latin Quarter is definitely the place to see and be seen as well as people watch on a busy night, the atmospherically high-ceilinged dining room and lesser known quiet back terrasse are excellent as well.Out of the very descriptive beer menu booklet, we went with the zippy Drak and smooth, rich Muesli to go with our double order of hush puppy-like dill-infused fish and fresh and crispy chips. Beers are available in glasses, pints, and pitchers for your sampling and sharing pleasure."

/user_details?userid=xQC-G-9bxyXEsy-GQ-UTEw,Stephen R.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"I tried coming here once after it was recommended. I found a place to sit on the third floor, though the place was obviously so packed that I knew it would take forever to get service. I returned another evening that was less crowded and was pretty pleased with their house brewed ales. I also ordered a bison burger that was pretty good, too. Like many places in the city, it is a bit cramped. But, the design of the interior, especially on the lower level by the bar, is pretty uncomfortable and impractical, particularly during winter months when people wear enough clothing to double their bulk and take up more space."
/user_details?userid=5Vq8IKr0glGCRGjNPeoc6A,Kevin M.,"Oakland, CA",4 star rating,"A favourite of mine in Montreal. I was first exposed to  L'amère À Boire during a UNICEF Quebec volunteer recognition event. Great drinks and finger food. One of my colleagues apparently always went here for said brews and tapas after class at the nearby Cegep. In similar fashion I dropped by for several pints on and off after this first event, enjoying the full gambit of their microbrews on tap. And of course they held the next years volunteer recognition event a year later and we enjoyed more food, drink with great company.It's on St. Denis so expect more French than English - not a big deal as you can still get by with English. In actual fact, it may be a selling point for you if you're visiting the city and want more culture.Will drop by again on my next trip back to my hometown from San Francisco."
/user_details?userid=lzQLHoJdaMNwiNt76wrc4g,Joe J.,"Gilbert, AZ",3 star rating,"Near UQAM, this brewpub seems to cater to the local students. It is a pleasant multi-level place that offers 6 to 8 of their beers on tap. They are well crafted, if not particularly unique. We tried several, but noted that the students focus mainly on pitchers.The pub food offerings are narrow, but diverse. They include quesadillas and empanadas, as well as fish and chips, sausages, salads, and fries. We tried a few of the dishes and found that the quesadilla and empanadas were not very authentic and actually weird. Sticking with more traditional offerings is the best idea here."
/user_details?userid=GpV7fg9-iadPX5HI5Qh89Q,George G.,"Carteret, NJ",4 star rating,"Visited 4 different brewpubs while in Montreal on vacation and this was the best in our book, especially since we came to this location twice.The food is very good. I had the rabbit burger and it must have been the tastiest I have ever had - very juicy and flavorful. The burger came with a good sauce and some garnish. My GF had the vegetarian burger and was quite impressed that it appeared to have been homemade and very good. The other item we have tried was the fries (which come in two sizes) and appear to be homemade cut potatoes and salted to perfection.Finally, the food isnt what we came here for, it was the beer! Very good selection of different beer styles and we did not find any fault with any of them. Overall, you could pick any one of them and not be disappointed if you are an avid beer geek like ourselves. However, we settled on the porter (buccaneer) as our favorite.Regarding cost, the prices listed already include all taxes and are quite fair. Good value in my opinion.In summary, dont miss out on this place if you are in Montreal. Especially since the location is quite good with many of other stores and brewpubs on the same street."
/user_details?userid=sl4uNiyk4N02coYl5E8FDg,Richard S.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"On the east side of Montreal you sure feel a long way from England but here is a brew pub serving great cask conditioned ales in the English style.  It was a pale ale with English hops and malts and very much the real thing, nicely cool and with a very lively natural carbonation and delicious in the expected restrained English manner.  I am not sure if they rotate their cask beers but, regardless, I'll be sure to check this place out when visiting Montreal."
/user_details?userid=CdUZIzSe0GJ7qxq4BU8pQw,Jonas K.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"On a few visits here I liked the area, the bar itself has a cold vibe. The beers were just alright and seemed a bit unrefined as if rushed to the taps. A burger I ordered was like charcoal on the outside, I requested a less scorched burger and they brought me another crunchy charcoal burger so no points for food."

/user_details?userid=s_ushMFjAYjIvszJW2gOhQ,Jessica E.,"Wilmington, DE",4 star rating,"This is a nice, casual place to dine or enjoy a nice brew (or two).  We stopped in here on our first night in Montreal and the bartender was incredibly friendly and welcoming.  He was quite helpful in assisting me with the menu when I told him that I had a dairy allergy.  I ordered the fish and chips and the fish was incredibly flavorful!  The meal came with a delicious salad, which balanced it out nicely.  My boyfriend ordered the bison burger, which did come out very well done.  That seems to be more the norm in Montreal, but you could probably request it to be done differently.  Of the beers we had, nothing stood out as being incredibly unique, but they were all of good quality.  All in all, dining at L'amere A Boire was a positive experience."
/user_details?userid=YKubepkxyPpL6pkz5FO8Fw,Tim P.,"Philadelphia, PA",3 star rating,"This was the first brew pub I stopped into while visiting Montreal and while I enjoyed it at the time I have since visited other brewpubs that were far better than this one.  They have a decent beer selection, though it is much heavier on the lagers and pilsners (lots of time refered to just as brune, rousse and blonde I think) than most brew pubs here or anywhere I have visited for that matter.  I am more of an ale drinker and what I had was decent though nothing to write home about. Just yelp about apparently.  My meal was another story.  I ordered a burger with frites, what eventually came out after a bit of a wait was a seriously overly charred burger on a very grilled bun.  The burger was also topped with some sort of corn and salsa combination that initially did a good job of distracting me from the quality of the meat and bun but eventually got overwhelming and had to be scrapped off.  My companion's fish and chips was very good though, were I to return and eat here I would get that.  I'd recommend just stopping in here for a beer on your way to Le Saint-Bock however."
