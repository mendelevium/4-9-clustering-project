We had a reservation, but didn't need one because the restaurant was only a quarter of the way full. Lee-Anne was our waitress and she was great. She knew the menu perfectly and was really encouraging with the food and what we selected. Everything was absolutely delicious! We tried the pork and cucumber salad, creole cigars, and octopus. It was all divine."
/user_details?userid=lLF9x4I41LFFKa_FX-lkbQ,Jedsada Y.,"Astoria, Queens, NY",4 star rating,"I was flabbergasted by the concept and ingredients Palme put together. Green Papaya Salad topped with Tuna Tataki, for example. Who would've thought they'd complement each other very well? Well, this dish can be improved with a squeeze of lime or lemon. It needs to be a little more acidic. Same goes for Grilled Red Snapper. It lacks citrus flavor which would have complemented the fresh fish. On the other hand, Conch Ceviche was spot on! Make sure you have it with fried plantain and a tiny bite of green chili. Grapefruit Cocktail was amazing. It was crafted with a lot of ingredients, and it came out very good!We were in a rush, so we didn't get to try their desserts, but we'll definitely come back again."
/user_details?userid=ssFC3zocwonySWs6ZuROpA,John K.,"RI, RI",5 star rating,"We were on vacation in Montreal and we just chose this place at random.The physical layout is nothing special, but it is pleasent, tidy and very clean. Like spotless.The service was efficient, friendly and informal.They have a full bar and a selection of creative coctails. They have a large selection of rums, but otherwise the liquor shelf is pretty much standard fare.The prices were reasonable. We ended uo spending about $100 for two, including cocktails, tax and tip.The food is what really makes this place stand out. This is the best meal I have had (at any price) in a long time. It was a fusion of various Caribbean styles. The combination of spices and textures was truely artful. I can't do it justice. If you are in Montreal, and you have a slightly adventurous pallet, put this place on your list!"
/user_details?userid=M1De2lTi1x9uzW1ah7FLEQ,Saida S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Went to palme with 2 friends, we had a reservation. Our waiter was more than nice. They have a wide selection of cocktails, i tried the ti punch WHEWW the alcohol really kicks in this one. The menu was well elaborated and from what our waiter told us its a mix of bahamas & haiti because thats where the owners are from. I had the grilled octopus and i asked to have different sides with what it's usually served with and the waiter delivered. My friends both had the red snapper, i dont personally like fish but it tasted so good. They also had a dj who was spinning hard thumbs up. I will definitely go back and i recommend it to everyone."
/user_details?userid=apg4zq2NocVW49x6YQA3iA,Neel L.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow this place is awesome! As soon as you walk in, you can tell how nice the place is going to be. The chefs definitely know what they're doing. We had the fried jerk chicken and the kalalu of lamb. Both were super flavorful and the meat was tender and cooked to perfection. We also had some of the best fried mac and cheese balls ever. Everything was nicely plated and the flavors complimented each other well. I definitely recommend this restaurant if you want to try something new with a date or friend. It's the perfect combo of Caribbean and fancy dining."
/user_details?userid=lOav1LDCS76RUYJr7pFH-Q,Nicolas R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Walking by on Ste Catherine, it was difficult for this restaurant to remain unnoticed. We were hungry and Palme did not disappoint.Its terrace and beautiful interior made us feel comfortable and relax right away. A very positive vibe that was confirmed with lovely staff's greetings.Our group had some restricted diets. They explained all possible options and came up with solutions that suited everybody's tastes.We knew the food was about to be served because we could smell delicious spices coming out of the kitchen.I had the ""lamb shank"" with spices on top (they can make it non-spicy) served with an eggplant caviar and a Caribbean salad to eat with soft tacos. It was perfectly cooked and harmonized. Very satisfying for a lamb lover...My friends had the ""Mac n Cheese"" that they found excellent and spicy, and the ""risotto croquette with black beans and goat cheese with a market salad and spicy tomato velouté"" that they made vegetarian for us (picture). This latter was exceptional, flavours were perfectly combined... an awesome tropical storm wandered into our mouths!I strongly recommend you to try Palme if you feel like discovering new flavours. Enjoy!"
/user_details?userid=JrTsaMac8BnAkLuJ3MfGzA,Aileen L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant is simple yet elegant. Super aesthetically pleasing and gives off a classy Caribbean vibe. Love it.FOOD: Amazing. I had the lamb and jerk chicken. The meats were all fall-off-the-bone tender, juicy and packed full of flavor. The spices blended amazingly with their respective sides. The chicken came with fried mac and cheese! And the lamb came with a homemade eggplant mash which was incredible as well. The plates should be shared for maximal taste bud explosion. PRICE: A tad bit on the expensive side but it's not as bad a steakhouse! For the quality that you're getting, the prices are very reasonable. I'd say it ranges from 16-24$.SERVICE: Amazing. The waiter was super attentive, took the time to explain the menu and was super friendly in general. Even the chef took the time out to come see and thank us."
/user_details?userid=aoGGk2BOLu4KF8fRTaXGyQ,Roman I.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Palme promises to deliver a carribean fusion experience, and the ambience certainly does. The food however does not live up to the $20-$27 per main dish it charges. We ordered a variety of dishes to share and not one of them could justify the price tag. Don't get me wrong, the food was perfectly acceptable and for the less budget oriented, worth it. But in all honesty my first time at Palme will likely be my last."
/user_details?userid=LPOUJ-4EYvlJ-Qe8l-xAGw,G R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Being a huge fan of cajun/creole food I was very excited to try out Palme.  The aesthetic of the place is very clean with minimal visual clutter.  It was not busy during my visit so the ambience and noise level were very low - being a bit sensitive to ambient noises, this was perfect for me.  The hostess and wait staff were amazing and attentive.I started with one of the very pricey cocktails ($12),  Nicely presented and tasty, but very expensive for what it was.  Still enjoyable. As an appetizer, I chose the homemade jamaican patties ($10)- very delicious with an amazing scotch bonnet(?) hot sauce.  Filling of beef and spinach was well seasoned and tasty, the pastry, which the menu said was a puff pastry, was a bit on the thick and seemed more like a regular pie dough than puff, but again, great flavours.  My entree of grilled octopus was a $27.  Being a huge fan of octopus and having had it at several great restaurants (Damas, KazaMaza) I was extremely disappointed with the portion size.  Although flavourful, tender and well seasoned, it was by far the tiniest tentacle I've been served.  The bed of rice, peas, watercress, tomatillo and crispy corn (I personally find crispy corn a big gimmicky at restos) was again, very flavourful.One of the best offerings in the Village right now and looking forward to trying their brunch menu (which unfortunately lacks vegetarian options)."
