Today I discovered a gem of a restaurant near Square Victoria. Kupfert & Kim offers a variety of nourish bowls and sweet treats. Everything is plant-based and gluten-free, but nonetheless very delicious. I got the Rainbow bowl which was bursting with colors, and so filling and satisfying. The chocolate zucchini muffin I got for dessert was possibly the best muffin I've ever had in my life (never thought I'd say this about a gluten-free muffin lol) - it was so moist, rich, and flavorful. I want to try so many more menu items; I guess I'll have to come back!The service was very quick and efficient. The price was reasonable (17.25$ including tax for Rainbow bowl and muffin). The decor inside is bright and cheerful, with nice wooden accents.Rainbow bowl details: organic quinoa, organic tempeh, organic kale, roasted yam, shredded beet, pomegranate, shredded carrot, rainbow radish, purple and white cabbage, organic sprouts, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, and maple chia sauce"

This quaint and bright resto has you placing your order at the counter and they then bring your meal to the table. They offer smoothies, smoothie bowls but lunch options as well. The resto was quiet in the morning but the lunch crowd started packing in, and early too. I ordered the açai bowl with an almond milk latte and was over the moon! The portion was more than filling, the smoothie was fresh, cool and flavourful, and they topped it up with apples, granola, hemp seeds and fresh blueberries giving it great crunch and texture. The latte was so good; seeing it was made with Pigeon coffee beans, the brew was great! Will definitely be back!"

They offer a variety of smoothies, smoothie bowls, coffee, tea breakfast and lunch. For all those who love pigeon cafe (located downtown), there's a new spot!!I am not a big fan of vegan lattes but the barista did a wonderful job on my almond milk latte. The froth was perfectly silky and the coffee tasted great. Pass by for a wonderful vegan coffee or grab a bite. This lovely new spot won't disappoint!"

The latte's, with a splash of maple syrup, are also great and have a unique taste."

They are very well balanced, full of flavour and freshness and with a wide range of options nobody is left out!I always go with any dish that has tofu because I love me some protein!Also, did I mention their baked goods are out of this world delicious? Just try the warm waffles, you won't regret it!"

It so happened I was wanting a salad when I passed by Kupfert & Kim. A pretty looking resto with a neat street-side terrace, serving vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free friendly food at reasonable prices.I ordered a Mediterranean styled salad; my girlfriend, the pesto dressed salad. Both are served on a bed of warm starch (mine on quinoa, her's on brown rice). They were delicious enough. Definately filling (great portions). The service is friendly and fast. The atmosphere, cozy. I can't say I would go out of my way to come back. A great lunch spot if you want to eat something light and refreshing without emptying your wallet, and if Mandy's is not around"

I had the burger of the day, which was black bean based, and my wife had the Oaxaca bowl. Both were delicious, fresh and beautifully presented. Great casual place to grab a quick and healthy meal."
/user_details?userid=Gw0xAwi-x1jyamxnW-A5OQ,Tammy L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"We only had a latte each but they were delightful! The matcha was very strong and earthy, while the goji berry was sweet with a bitter undertone that was addicting. The cafe's decor was fun and modern, and the music was energetic. It'd be a perfect place to chill and relax after a meal or just to get something warm."
