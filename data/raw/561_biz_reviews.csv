This restaurant was recommended by my friend and since then, it has been our go-to spot! The noodles are handmade so you can definitely count on them for the freshness! The cooking process is interesting to watch. This place is located in a big basement so it is like a hidden cocoon. You get peace of mind while enjoying a nice bowl of noodles!"
/user_details?userid=ncAOj5Xz-XS6bpSnTWp3tQ,Austin G.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"Nudo is a basement Chinese restaurant in the heart of Chinatown that hand-makes their noodles. From the outside to the inside, it's nothing special. It's a little worn down, outdated, and stuffy (there wasn't any AC when we went). However, this is how you know it's authentic and good.When you walk down the stairs, you'll notice the elderly man and woman rolling noodles and cooking them in a pot of hot water. It's mesmerizing to watch! There's one large dining room with plenty of tables for everyone. After you wait 10-15 minutes, someone will come over with water and the menu.The menu is large and anything you order should be good. We recommend these things:1) Cucumber salad- it's the best I've had outside of China and is really cheap. Order two servings!2) Peanut sesame noodles- it comes with BBQ pork, carrots, etc. and is well balanced.If you love Chinese food, go here!"
/user_details?userid=0Zswwlz4NzUJoG-skyWzIw,Tania L.,"Mississauga, Canada",3 star rating,"We originally intended to go to Lanzou Handpulled Noodles, but due to the huge crowds that came out for the food festival, we opted for Nudo instead with its shorter lines. However, we were very much fooled by the optically ""shorter"" lines - the wait probably took equally as long, if not longer! Nudo seems to be a family run business; they were severely understaffed that day, and seemingly unprepared for the crowd.It took us approximately half an hour to get seated, and almost as long for us to receive our food. The way the restaurant processed the orders was also confusing; despite placing our order way before the table next to us and those that came after us, it took us much longer to receive our food. We were so hangry and upset by the end of it!We ordered three noodles to share, along with two appetizers. We got the smashed cucumbers (quite yummy and refreshing, albeit a little oily and spicy), along with the pork ears (we wanted the beef tendon initially, but they had sold out). The noodles we ordered were the beef noodle soup, the chicken sesame dry noodles, and the Taiwanese braised pork dry noodles. The beef noodle soup was by far the best one, hands down. The broth was nice and flavourful, and the braised beef truly hit the spot. In second place was the Taiwanese braised pork; the pork was well marinated and seasoned, offering a nice complexity to the dish. It wasn't overly salty/sweet, though the well-boiled tea egg was just okay. The chicken sesame noodles, however, were terrible. At first, they mistakenly gave us the char siu sesame noodles, but soon corrected that order. The noodles were drenched in this sickeningly sweet sauce - too sweet, almost as if they added a ton of sugar and just let it sit in the sauce. No one in my family was able to stomach nor enjoy this dish.I'm sure Nudo would be better on days with a smaller crowd; they were simply overworked and at capacity that day. The food was mediocre, but I know exactly what to order next time!"
/user_details?userid=zZYpI2V_6C36JPa9Ul_bFQ,Alec Y.,"Richmond, Canada",4 star rating,"Good noodles at a good price. I visited during Chinese New Year and there plenty of seating available at 5PM. You can get a solid bowl of beef flank noodle soup here - super tasty and beefy broth! The only problem? I wish there were more noodles. Also would recommend the cucumber salad too. Flavourful with a good spicy kick to warm you up for the Hand Pulled Noodles. In total, bill came to $17. This is the Chinatown joint to go for a solid beef noodle soup (and if the lineup for Lan Zhou is too long). 4.5/5!"

Pasta was top notch, not an ounce of unwanted oil from the minced pork. Hard to do. Chicken was good but not as good as the pork.Pork dumplings were super fresh and tasty. Could have eaten a dozen. Love Montreal's foodie scene."
/user_details?userid=ARECcpgeKa27f4Zjjp9rpA,Caesy C.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Decided to come here on Christmas Day. There was a line, but that was expected. We waited around 15 mins before we got seated. While waiting you can see the chef hand-pulling noodles which was very cool. The restaurant itself looked kind of shabby. We ordered the scallion pancake for an appetizer and noodles for the main course. The appetizer was good but a little salty. It got to the table pretty fast as well. Our noodles took a while to get to the table but they were so worth the wait. Best noodles I've ever had! The portions were pretty big too. I'd definitely recommend this place if you want really good noodles."
/user_details?userid=VhbAKBGltxbdKOS6ZraZFg,Amanda C.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"After days of eating lots of French food, I was craving some comfort Chinese food. What better than beef noodle soup? It was the perfect bowl, perfectly chewy noodles and flavorful soup, and totally hit the spot. Super casual and quick service, you'll be in and out in 30 minutes."
/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Everyone lines up in the cold for Nouilles Lan Zhou, but the hand pulled noodles here are just as good, you can still watch them being made and it's a much larger space. I normally get the braised beef noodle soup and add a little extra chili oil to it. The noodles are a perfect texture and the beef is fall apart tender. The broth is also very tasty and they give you boc choy as well. I most frequently get takeout and the food always comes out very quickly. The only non-noodle things I've tried on their menu are the kimchi and cucumber salad (standard, but good) and the dumplings. The dumplings are not as good as Mai Xiang Yuan or Qing Hua but they're pretty solid and I love most dumplings."
/user_details?userid=VNpOHRthYzChtV6Le1bhlA,Yongky C.,"Coquitlam, Canada",3 star rating,"Late night dumpling and noodle place. Compared to Lan Zhao this place is two notches below.Nonetheless, rather run down place, big but empty.Server was playing on Iphone even as we were one of three customers in the restaurant.Ordered chicken dumpling, beef noodle, and seasoned brisket on the slide. Food was overall good (4/5) but service sub par, hence the rating."
/user_details?userid=ZighfCv43MPj6MgyidpwQg,Xuenie Z.,"Flushing, NY",3 star rating,"I could question whether this place is authentic or not. Starting with appetizer, the shredded potato with spicy sauce is not the same dish you would find in an authentic place where they mix green chili peppers and vinegar with the shredded potato. We had to douse chili sauce in the tripe appetizer because it was not spicy enough. Perhaps this place caters to a non-Chinese palate. If you must come here for a bowl of hot noodles, go for the braised beef noodles. The noodles were pulled nicely and cooked perfectly. Do not get the cold peanut noodles. It was not a cold noodle dish and the peanut sauce was not strong enough. It was more of a sweet and warm noodle bowl."

/user_details?userid=dD5vTDPzv_79m8_zZhc9hA,Steven B.,"Beachwood, OH",5 star rating,"Easily the highlight of my short time in Montreal.  Located in Chinatown, Nudo is on the lower level off the street.  Once you get in you enter a big dining room you will see a small kitchen area behind glass where you will see a chef making the fresh noodles.  Well worth your time to go up front and watch for awhile, since the process of rolling and working the dough followed by the stretching, folding process is amazing.  The result are some of the most amazing noodles you will have. The menu is a small concise list, with mostly noodle soup dishes.  I ordered the seafood noodle soup with extra noodles.  The result was a large bowl of the noodles in a great broth a couple of pieces of baby bok choi, shrimps, clams, squid and some crab sticks.  The noodles and broth are both excellent, which makes a great meal; the rest are nice bonuses.   Nudo is great, the food is excellent and prices are reasonable; if they were anywhere close I would be there quite often.  If you are in Montreal and want some great Chinese food you won't go wrong here."

Only noodle, bbq pork，chop suey， carrot， cucmber... mix with oishin sauce and oil. you can also see from the picture the chef can't cut the cucumber properly. It costs me 8.95+taxPlus we tried to order some appetizers, 4 out of 5 dishes on the menu were sold out!"
/user_details?userid=q8V8MDINpPmPg_0STAsDSw,Daira R.,"Somerville, MA",3 star rating,"Recommend. Came in here on Christmas because the promise of hand pulled noodles was more than we could resist. We were seated fairly promptly but then we had a bit of a wait. Nudo was really busy and didn't have enough menus. So we had to wait for menus. Once we got our menus we had to wait to order. It seemed that everyone was in the same boat as us, so it wasn't too frustrating. One person at a different table did leave, get a boba tea and bun, and then return and eat it while waiting. We found that once we ordered though, the food came out quick. I got the sesame chicken noodle, my husband a beef noodle soup, and then chicken dumplings to share. The dumplings were no good. Don't order them. Some tasted like nothing, others had all the flavor. Clearly the chicken mince hadn't been properly mixed. Either way, even the dumplings that had flavor, weren't very good. My husband and I both loved what I ordered. The sesame chicken had a peanut butter sauce flavor and I loved it. The beef soup was okay. I'm sure it's good enough, but in comparison to the sesame chicken - it didn't stand a chance. Overall, a 3.5 experience rounded down to 3 because of the dumplings."
/user_details?userid=h5eVBQ5DyrpnQOaJ9ycl3g,Shiyue X.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I went there on a Saturday evening with a friend. We walked there, since we were nearby, but there is usually a limited amount of parking near Chinatown. When we got there, the place was fairly busy, but we were greeted and shown our table almost immediately. The menu was in Mandarin and in English and there were a few pictures. The food came quickly and it was fun to be able to see the chef work on the dough. The amount was very generous and I was more than full! It tasted great and I was extremely happy with the quality. The ambiance is nice and relaxed. It's not the fanciest restaurant, but it's definitely homey and I felt very comfortable. I would definitely recommend if you like hand made noodles!"

TINY...By Asian standard. I was quite disappointed that I could not choose the size of my soup.I felt it was expensive for what it was it was. Taking in consideration that we are in Chinatown.But, good is good. I felt I could not go below 3 stars... The washrooms are cleans."

I will definitely be heading back!"

I was staying in the area and wandered around and picked it at random.I found a gem in the rough. It was cold and I was tired but the large portions filled and warmed me up. it is a very barebones place, the service is very quick and minimal. But the food makes up for it. It's fun the watch them make the noodles, the food comes quick.It's a good place to get ramen and take a break you can stay as long as you want I have never been rushed out( I once had my suitcase with me before i could check into my air bnb)"

Menu selections weren't great. No meatless dumpling options. I did confirm that their vegetable noodle soup can be served with a vegetarian broth. Our orders were the pulled chicken noodle soup as well as the vegetable one. The noodles, the chicken as well as the vegetables were good. The broth, however, in both soups was somewhat bland. Sriracha and soy sauce came in handy. Service was ok and prices very reasonable."

I ordered Beef Noodle with best hope. The noodle was fine, but the soup was way of standard authentic Lan Zhou beef noodle, how do I know it? I lived at Lan Zhou for long time. The beef was also not good. I regret I missed the noodle place just one block away."

The beef with dry noodles and the soup were great but the seafood noodle soup was not good. Tripe side dish tasted like they could still be frozen. Weird. We did enjoy watching the noodle maker at work. That was nice.

/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I have been to this place for several time, mostly for their beef noodle with a dark colour broth, different from Lan which uses a clear broth. This time I was there to try their new dish bridge crossing rice noodle. The dish is originally from Yunnan province China. This restaurant probably is the first to introduce it to Montreal. Wherever I go to Toronto I would have this dish in Chinatown. There is a beautiful story behind this dish. A wife always prepares lunch and deliver it to the husband who studies for the selection exam very hard. The lunch includes a pot of hot chicken broth, some veggi and a bowl of drained noodle. On day when the wife crossed a bridge and dropped the lunch, leaving everything mixed in the soup. After the husband tasted it, he found it was delicious. After some improvements this dish was spread all over and to nowadays people all over China know about this dish and love it very much. In the restaurant, this dish is served with a hot pot of broth and several sides such as raw meat, veggies etc. Drop the meat first and then other sides, rice noodle is the last. Add some vinegar to the taste. This place only started to offer this dish days ago and the flavour is not as good as the one in Toronto.    I think it worth a try."

The chive pancakes were delicious and quite thin and crispy (they seemed almost deep-fried), but the cucumber salad was just okay because several pieces were a bit mushy.Restaurant is located downstairs from the street; decor is pretty basic. Definitely come for the noodle soup - the noodles alone are worth it!"

We had soup dumplings, stir fry noodles, duck, mayonnaise shrimp, and some other stuff (did I mention we were tipsy?)The prices were reasonable and the service was pretty good, except they tried to trick us when it came to paying.

My mouth is watering just thinking back about this place.Arrived in Montreal very late and this was one of the few places open. So glad we came! Noooooodlllesssss!!! They make their own noodles! When you first enter the place, the first thing you will see on the right is a window to their kitchen. There you can watch them massage and string noodles upon noodles! It was really neat to watch. Now let's get to the food...Please get their BRAISED PORK NOODLE SOUP! The meat was so tender and the broth was so mouthwatering. My husband got BBQ pork and rice which was delicious too! We also got spring rolls and scallion pancake. I finished it all. I wish this place was in my hometown. I'd frequent it every single week!"
/user_details?userid=dEVuA08mPugqbiNa971pww,Dylan Wait For It N.,"Saint-Léonard, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,The braised beef noodle soup was amazing. The meat was really easy to pull apart and it had a lot of fat on it. The noodles were really good. They were really chewy and had a good texture. The soup had a lot of flavour in it but it wasn't spicy and the chilli sauce was lacking in the spice factor. The pancake was really good and it had a lot of flavour so you didn't need any sauce.10/10 would recommend this to my friends

It almost feels like you're eating in a cafeteria set up with tables and chairs. Nonetheless, the food is delicious. For starters, the wood ear mushroom is great as well as the scallion pancakes. The pot stickers could have been seared a bit longer to get a crispier outside. The hand-pulled noodles are a must. The soy pork noodles with an egg were delicious. The broth was flavourful and savoury. The pork was a bit too salty for me, but it was expected as it is flavoured with soy sauce.The one downside to Nudo is that the service is kind of slow. We had to hail our server often to take orders, ask for things, etc. They were just a bit understaffed. Still, I definitely recommend Nudo for some authentic Chinese noodles/food."

Also tried the green onion pancake. Its tasty, but they sprinkle soy sauce over it makin it extra salty (at least for me).

The chicken was a bit dry, with not enough sesame sauce to cover for that.But the worst is the noodles. They were overcooked (!!!) and not as fresh as usual. Even after adding the broth and stirring a lot they were one mass. Much like noodles become at home after they've been put in the fridge for a while...So basically skip this place and go to Eaton Center counter."

In a attempt to Convince her to let me go to cafe cleopatra after,  I without hesitation went into Nudo. I ordered the sesame pulled chicken noodle bowl and WOW. I was shocked. I seriously have been missing out on amazing food this whole time.  They make the noodles in the front with a visible kitchen so you get the full experience. The chicken was fresh PULLED chicken with an amazing glaze sauce.  I added spicy sauce for flavor.  For 8 dollars you grt a fresh and authentic feast. Highly recommend"

She kept saying she wanted noodle soup so we stumbled upon here in Chinatown. We went into a few places but they were either too dingy, smelly or dark. Nudo seemed closed (the forgot to put the sign on lol) but inside was open, spacious and clean (didn't smell like a toilet or trying to mask any foul smells with bleach). We ordered the dry noodles with chicken, chicken noodle soup and pork pot stickers. The noodles were soooooooooo good! You can taste that it was freshly made - you taste the flour and the consistency is different. The veggie pairings were also delicious down to the complimentary soup offered with the dry noodle items. My mom really enjoyed her noodle soup. The pot stickers were okay though, we've had better. Staff were pleasant. I liked seeing the noodle kitchen window where you see the cooks making the noodles. 3 people costed $40 including tip. Not too bad. Will definitely come back.

We had garlic cucumbers, spicy potatoes, ""vegetable"" (bok choy w/oyster sauce), dumplings in peanut sauce, and pork-chive dumplings.  The peanut dumplings were really good - juicy and thin-skinned in a sweet-savory peanut sauce.  The chive dumplings were a bit of a let-down with their harsh garlic flavor.  Server forgot the sliced braised beef we ordered and had to be pushed to bring small plates and hot tea. Shrug.But the dry noodles, oh, the dry noodles! We ordered 'em with minced pork and -- holy umami -- these were chewy, addictive, and delicious!

He had the pulled chicken dry noodle dish. We also had the chicken dumplings to share. The noodles were made in the open kitchen and you can see and hear the chefs preparing your meal. The noodles were so delicious and my boyfriend loved it too! So glad this place was a positive first experience for my boyfriend to try hand pulled noodles.

Finally authentic hand pulled noodles that makes your mouth water.Today I had a craving for noodles and then decided to go have lunch at Nudo. Right at the entrance you are instantly faced with an open kitchen and can see behind the glass panels, a couple of master noodle makers busy at their task, preparing one bowl of goodness at the time - fascinating. The setting of this restaurant is extremely simple but the output is a bowl which perfectly balances noodles, vegetables and BBQ Pork. I ordered mine ""dry"", meaning the broth is served on the side. If you are a fan of spices... do add some of the red pepper flakes infused oil - this truly adds to the flavor of the noodles.Must come back and try the braised beef noodle and some of the sides. I've been told that the pork ear in spicy sauce, shredded potatoes, and scallion pancakes are a must try. Maybe I'll be able to meet the owner, Mr. Ye who opened this location barely 9 months ago - what a hit!"

The famous noodles? A little mushy, not chewy. It was definitely the cheapest meal I had in all of Montreal but not the most memorable either."

/user_details?userid=Eta0tfNygqtTomlAG-I3yA,Tarek J.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"I was in a ramen mood and originally wanted to go to Sumo Ramen since I've heard good things. But after the driving and the cold weather I kinda just parked on St. Laurent and, no joke, walked into the restaurant directly in front of my car. Nudo had a foldable display outside their restaurant that advertised Yuki Ramen, and my date and I immediately thought ""good enough"" since we were too lazy to walk the 800 meters to Sumo. Glad we did because those noodles, though not ramen, are FINE. Immediately after being seated I checked the Yelp reviews and praised the heavens that this place had favourable reviews. We ordered the garlic and chive pork ravioli dumplings to start. This is where they lost the star because it was plain awful. The smell was off-putting, the sauce accompanying it tasted like tangy soya (teriyaki sauce??) and the dumpling itself was a weird mix of flavours (read: mostly cabbage). Not for me. Not a great start for Nudo. The mains were the stars. I ordered the braised beef shank noodle soup and it was just plain great. The noodles were very distinct and I already crave their dense chewiness after only an hour of having them. The broth was very flavourful and not salty. The beef was tender and the bok choy was a great filler. While the portion size is gigantic, I do wish there was more bok choy or beef since most of the bowl is very much broth and noodle. That isn't even really a complaint though, since the broth and noodles are great in their own rite.All in all, you have to eat here because NOODLES. They do it good."

It's a problem.I got the braised beef shank noodle soup with a little bit of spice and b. got the chashu pork noodle soup. Both of our soups were packed with flavor - mine tasted a little heavier (slightly greasy) while b.'s looked and tasted lighter. While I wasn't a fan of the pickled vegetables in mine, the tender beef and toothsome noodles took the spotlight. The chashu pork slices in b.'s weren't quite what we expected but decent. Overall, they don't skimp on the ingredients and the portions were plenty filling. We left satisfied and completely stuffed to the gills. Service was prompt and friendly. A little bit of an odd space - open and sparse looking with a couple of flat screen TVs. But obviously you go for the noodles, not the décor.CASH ONLY!* In hindsight, after trying the noodles at Nouilles de Lan Zhou the next day (I told you, hand-pulled noodle problem), I preferred their braised beef shank noodle soup for the overall composition. On the other hand, I really liked the lighter broth of the chashu pork noodle soup at Nudo. In the end, I salivate when I think about the noodles at either place. So you decide."

The one I've had previously was thicker and lacked that crispiness. The soups and noodles. I think it would convince Lo Pan to give up his quest for the green eyed women.

The decor is nothing great, its banquet chairs and cheap tables, however you don't come here for the decor you come here for the noodles!  Oh the noodles!

Yet at the same time there was Chinese karaoke on the plasma screens on both sides of the dining hall...   Our servers were kind and polite. The food arrived quickly, though not in the order we expected it to... the seaweed salad was the only appetizer that came before the noodle soups, and the spring rolls made it to our table last (even though some of us planned to have them as a starter). We originally came here because they feature both hand pulled noodles and dumplings. However, some of the vegetarians in the group were disappointed to learn that non of the dumplings was vegetarian. The vegetable dry noodles were also a disappointment, since they were served with sweet sauce. All the other dishes on the other hand were very good and truly authentic, proper Chinese dishes.

A dream to hv to noodles and the soup together in the bowl.

The spicy soups are not at all spicy, but there is ample hot sauce at the tables. Really, all the components of noodle soup were done well. It's just that everything else paled in comparison to the noodles.If you are ever in Montreal, don't eat just anywhere. You save yo dola until you have eight dola. Then you take yo eight dola and get yo nudo at Nudo. Do the right thing.Oh a final note: they were showing anime with full frontal nudity on all their TVs.

The interior of the restaurant has definitely seen better days, there were several flat screen tvs showing anime. The menu consisted mostly of, surprise, noodles. Noodles with soup, noodles without soup. There were also appetizers of wontons, egg rolls, pickled vegetables (including kim chi), etc. I ordered wonton soup (5 wontons for $2.50), pickled cucumbers ($1.75), and zha jiang mien ($7.50 I think). The wontons were excellent: thin skins, finely minced pork and shrimp, not too large or small. The price was definitely unbeatable for a bowl of wontons. The pickled cucumbers were above average. They were ice cold (+), still very crisp (+), and lots of garlic (+). They were however a little on the salty side (-).The zha jiang mien was also above average. The noodles were chewy, firm, and absorbed the sauce nicely. Everything I expected from hand-pulled noodles. The fermented black bean sauce had lots of ground pork and black bean flavorService was neither terrific nor terrible, it was efficient. The only downside of the meal was paying the bill. You are forced to go to the counter to pay, so before going to pay I calculated my subtotal and left approximately 20%: $2. After paying for my meal at the counter I collected my change and proceeded to leave. The host/waitress stopped me and asked how I enjoyed my meal. I told her it was fine, to which she responded, ""oh then you should leave a 15%-20% tip."" Really?! First, I did leave a tip, but your system of paying for the bill doesn't allow you at the register to see it at the table. Second, even living in the US, I thought tips were voluntary? Is it really a tip if it is not voluntary? Anyway, it was a bit of a downer to an otherwise enjoyable meal. This is a good place to come for hand-pulled noodles...if you are prepared to leave a tip, if not don't bother, I guess."

You won't be disappointed with the noodles, which is good since they don't cook anything else. They deliver a nice size portion of noodles with a reasonable amount of meat to top them off. In a surprising treat, you get a small appetizer before your meal arrives, and it's actually really good.The interior is just awkward. I've never seen more than a half dozen patrons at any one time, yet the place is huge. It doesn't look or feel like a small noodle shop, it feels much more like a hotel banquet room.

The noodles are hand pulled and they taste like it. The braised beef shank is tender and falls apart in your mouth. The soup broth tastes like the meat so it goes together great.I also got scallion pancakes, which had too few scallions in it. It was mostly dough and it suffered for it. They also topped it with what tasted like balsamic vinegar, which was an interesting combination that worked well to offset the fried oily feel."

Of course it's a typical Chinatown restaurant and you can't expect fancy decor or presentation. But the food is well worth the money!They specializes in pulled noodle made by pulling the dough many times into thin noodles.I love their noodle because the soup is so flavourful, and the noodles are just the right amount of chewy. The marinated vegetable on top of the noodles also adds to the overall deliciousness.My typical order is a small dish of edamame to start. Then the usual braised beef noodle soup. Yum!"

We all enjoyed hot bowls of wonton soup or seaweed soup and then split an order of chicken pot stickers, braised beef with noodles and an amazing pork and rice dish. The cool part about this place is the fact there is a window that allows patrons to watch the process of the noodles being made."

I don't know if it's just because I went in on a good day (lunch hour, weekday), or what, but the food was superb.I took the Jarret de boeuf (braised beef shank) noodle soup, and the beef was tender, a bit tendon-y and totally soft and delicious, the noodles were made right in front of my eyes and cooked to perfection, and I absolutely loved the sour addition of the pickled cabbage thrown on top. The soup is not at all bland, but then again if you are someone to loves to eat salty things, particularly processed food, I can see how you might miss the subtle flavour of the broth.I don't eat packaged stuff, and I don't add a lot of salt to my food, so the broth was perfectly seasoned and delicious. TOP MARKS. I am coming back here at least once a week. Maybe twice. At around $10 for the bowl of soup, it was totally worth every penny.  I could have eaten two.My only gripe is that it has stairs going down. How am I supposed to get down there with a stroller?The service was also great.

/user_details?userid=FuW1EwnbQoHyDMeOGrljsg,Khanh L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Finally, our own little pulled noddled shop.Funky decor, simple menu, cheap, what more do you want? and good too!!!As you enter you see the noddle chef pulling noodles on your right behind a glass window, it's cool to watch.The noodle texture is good, it's not tough but it's not soggy, and while it soaks for ten or so minutes in the broth during the time you eat it, the texture remains constant until the last bite. The reason for this is because they coat the noodles with oil when they begin pulling, and finish it off with flour once it's down to size. The oil content in the noddles make it absorb less broth hence it doesn't get so soggy at the end. The trade off is as you're eating that oil taste really builds up and you feel like you've had enough even without really being full. it's something to consider if you want to order a dry bowl with broth on the side.The dumplings here a top notch too, again the oily excess can be felt at the end, but the taste and texture was very good. I would recommend coming here with a friend, that way you can order an appetizer and share the fat. Good chinese food is always a bit fatty what can you do, but don't overdo it cuz a full belly on fatty chinese food is not a good feeling :)The one thing they should offer is for us to choose the size of the noodles, that would be nice, thick , medium or thin. I'll ask them next time see if they would do it..."

Initially I was in a great mood for rice but the waiter suggested noodle rather rice because ""NUDO"" is famous for noodles and thus I opt for noodle instead.Although the noodles were hand made, they were worse than mediocre and not at all chewy. I feel like that the noodle tasted like instant noodle. And the texture of pulled chicken was just like rubber and the broth was tasteless. Of course $7.75 for such mediocre noodle was unacceptable. This is the restaurant that I would never ever come again."

/user_details?userid=oOfu-75wAzAoAPKzmloHeA,Noah S.,"Great Neck, NY",5 star rating,"A wonderful find in Montreal Chinatown. I have passed by this place before when in the area but I never stopped for a meal here. I was craving a yummy, warm soup in the midst of freezing weather. The restaurant is down quite a few steps, so it isn't extremely accessible. Decor is basic, yet modern. This place gets very crowded during lunchtime, so come early. The menu is great, featuring a large selection of noodle soups and bowls, as well as a few entrees and appetizers. All of their noodles are handpulled which you could watch through their clear window to the kitchen. Prices are extremely reasonable, so I would recommend trying appetizers along with the soup. We started with their dumplings, which came with 12 to a serving. While they weren't as amazing as competitors who specialize in dumplings, these were yummy. There was nothing wrong with them; they were juicy, thin, and filled with tender filling. We also got the dumplings in peanut sauce, which were fantastic. The skin was so thin and the dumpling absorbed the peanut flavor well. I got the (not spicy) beef noodle soup. The noodles were incredible, not too thick, perfectly cooked, and incredibly juicy. The beef was flavorful and tender, and the broth was spectacular, although it tasted more like a chicken broth than a beef broth. Their chicken noodle soup is yummy and has a slight Asian twist to a classic. Their rice and noodle bowls are also worth it, but the soups provide the full experience."

Their fresh handmade noodles are chewy in the right degree and goes wonderfully well with the said delicious creamy sesame sauce, bok choy and chicken. It is simply a bowl of down-to-earth goodness and without a doubt the best food court fare ever. I'm also tempted to say that these are the best Chinese noodles in town. Service is friendly and as quick as it gets remembering that they shape their noodles upon your placing an order.

The broth was very flavorful and the noodles were filling and had a nice texture. The service was super fast and smiley. The only cons were that some of the beef pieces were on the tough side and I was expecting a little more spice to the soup, but I wouldn't hesitate to eat there again."

/user_details?userid=JKQmuH6PKCDXpeZYK3BmnQ,Mister O.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I know sod-all about Lanzhou-style noodles, but when I stumbled across Christina X.'s review of this place earlier this week, I immediately made up my mind to try it for lunch this weekend.  The verdict?  I want to put Christina X.'s face on a stamp.This is an unpretentious eating-house on a block of Saint-Laurent known for its unpretentious eating-houses.  The decor is institutional, and the menu is one of the simplest I've ever seen- one sheet of paper naming a half-dozen noodle soups, and another half-dozen choices of noodles sans soup.  A separate page has bubble teas and fruit drinks.  That's it.I went with the BBQ pork noodle soup ($7.50), based on Chris B's photo of same, and a glass of water.  The soup took quite a while to arrive, but it gave me time to fully appreciate the appetizer.  I generally loathe the seaweed at Japanese restaurants, but the seaweed salad appetizer I got served here was a total knockout.  Tasted more like garlic and ginger-marinated green beans, sliced lengthwise and served at caviar temperature.  Not a hint of fishiness.  That silly little free appetizer was one of the tastiest, best-made things I've ever eaten.Normally, in Montreal's bargain-priced subterranean lunch dives, I'd expect an appetizer of that quality to be followed up by a supremely sub-par main course.  Not in this place.  This was one of the best bowls of soup I can remember eating.  Rich, broad-shouldered broth, a surprisingly generous amount of sliced BBQ-ed pork, roughly half a head of bright green bok choi, and a good helping of chewy, nicely-elastic noodles.  The whole thing together equated to a noodle soup with the inscrutable perfume and particular mouth-feel of a topnotch bowl of pho, crossed with the deep, intense flavors of a good Clark Street Cantonese chow mein.  Just fabulous.Service was uniformly courteous, professional, and quick.  Everybody on the floor was hustling, even though the place was only a third full.  Water glass got refilled before it emptied.  Tables were bussed to a Swiss standard of cleanliness.Restroom:  Much nicer that than average for Chinatown.  Broken faucet, some inexplicable clutter, but clean and usable .Cash only.  No cards or Interac.Lunch, tax in, was eight bucks and change, and was ridiculously tasty for the money. Colder weather will see me darkening their doorstep again.  In fact, cold weather will see me making excuses to do so."

We were definitely drawn in by the ""hand-pulled noodles,"" but alas the service was terrible. The food was okay, as the noodles seemed a bit hard. I ordered the BBQ Pork noodles and somehow ended up getting some chicken in there. The portion size was fairly okay, but I would have liked a bigger portion. Back to the service, the waiter who served us started off friendly, but when it came time to pay for the meal, he became demanding. He served us water and our noodles, but never checked up on us once, never asked if we needed anything else. My meal came out to be about $9, and I was more than happy to pay that except the waiter told me that tip was mandatory. Now, I wouldn't have had a problem with giving him a tip if he hadn't said that it was necessary for me to pay an extra 10%. The man literally wouldn't let me leave if I didn't pay him an extra tip. Honestly, if restaurants required a mandatory tip, they should have included it in the bill rather than asking it upfront. I'm never eating at this place ever again, as you could probably get better noodles elsewhere, probably just down the street without rude waiters asking for a tip as if he deserved one in the first place."

/user_details?userid=gpqg-IPWh3eHklHITc05lA,Bob H.,"Wayland, MA",4 star rating,Five stars for the food and five stars for the value.The restaurant however was very uncomfortable since the AC was not working. I had the soup with homemade noodles with chicken. The cucumber salad and pot stickers were also excellent.
