/user_details?userid=RmnLFQF7c-kbp4qQ8mIUgg,Gloria V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Okay what! I read a review and they were not lying. I ordered, finished paying and right as I was putting my money away the food was already ready to go. I got a tuna sandwich and it was $3.50. If I'm ever craving something quick and easy this is where I would go ! I was in the store for less than a minute so I don't remember all the other options they have !"
/user_details?userid=efIUqTt53jnyx6QlR9ehsg,Liz P.,"Charlotte, NC",2 star rating,This is definitely a college place. If I was a lot younger with less money I would have added another star but since I am not u would not recommend. The bread was good but the meat was very sub par. The roast beef was almost unrecognizable.
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Probably one of the best deals in town for a large sandwich! For $3.75 (incl tax), you can get a beef salami sandwich on a ~10 inch roll. (Remark: They have many options beyond this but the beef salami option is my personal favourite.) Nothing fancy, but it tastes good and - after a week or two - you'll have saved enough to treat yourself somewhere high end if you want ;-)You can also add a drink and bag of chips at a good price too and there are other convenience store items at the store too. A bit bare bones, but that's perfectly fine!The people running the shop are super nice too."
/user_details?userid=LPDOx50zUR-rEovzOhADbA,Rachel C.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"I wish I would've found out about this place earlier in my college career! Located less than a 2 minute walk from campus, Super Sandwich is the perfect cheap meal for any student with sandwiches ranging from around $3-$4.75. They have turkey (my usual), Black Forest ham, crab salad (that one isn't too great imo), chicken salad (was delicious when I used to eat chicken), salami, pastrami, egg salad, pickled vegetables, smoked chicken, smoked ham, and a few more types of sandwiches. Each sandwich comes with mustard, mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese depending on the sandwich. What makes this place so great is that the sandwiches are made in less than 30 seconds, and you're literally in and out in the blink of an eye. Delicious!"

/user_details?userid=IG-F1uZ8ZJ-fq4Y98j7d6Q,Mal I.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"i only discovered this place during my third year of college when my friend took me there and i WISH i had found it earlier. i just started my 4th year and i know this is the only place i'll be buying lunch from if i don't eat at home. it's super close to mcgill's campus and multiple libraries so you can grab a super tasty sandwich for super cheap and super fast. my favourite is the chicken salad sandwich and i guess that's the same way for others too because it sells out relatively quickly, maybe around 2 pm, but that gives me a chance to try other fillings because if there's chicken salad then i GET chicken salad. the egg salad, cheese, and tuna are also really good. currently trying to recreate the chicken salad recipe so i can still get a sandwich this tasty when i leave montreal haha. also the owners are super nice!"
/user_details?userid=sLUems6LCJsPjWpmufQY2A,Steve D.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Best budget sandwich shop in town. Fresh, quality ingredients, super fast friendly service. Excellent value. Ate here at least twice a week for years!"
/user_details?userid=gTYrFdJ9gcMUMP11LrOKLQ,Sean B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Super Sandwich may or may not be an ongoing hostage situation.... either that or a sandwich based cult? Normal employees are not this fast and consistent.Super Sandwich is fast, consistent, and consistently #$%@ing fast. 18 seconds passed between when I exchanged payment for my sandwich, and when I received it. With a line stretching to the back of the store you can expect to be out of there in 5 minutes. A roast beef sandwich and a soda will run you $5.25, fill your stomach, and be easy on your wallet."
/user_details?userid=ZGiwU16rhGvWAYUzkWL0xw,Boz X.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Even at ~3.50$, I'm hesitating on revisiting. I got one smoked chicken and one pastrami sub.In the subs, they add lettuce, 1.5 slices of tomato, couple slices of processed meat, and mustard or mayonnaise. The smoked chicken was literally slices of processed chicken like the ones you order at the supermarket for cheap sandwiches and nothing like the gud ole smoked chicken I'm used to get at a BBQ. The pastrami must have been some of the worst corned beef I've had in my life. Can't describe what went wrong, but it lacked a lot in flavour.Thank Lord for the mustard, for I got to enjoy mustard on white bread.Giving it 3/5 based on convenience (close to a school library, quick service, and cheap subs)."
/user_details?userid=8slwItRgaTxifLXZBkNpPA,Martin A.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Keys to success for any Mcgill student/alum.Great prices, value and fast service. The salami is a classic of mine -- top notch."
/user_details?userid=TAlMzsAqLu0ckreakoV-dg,Juan R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I used to go here on a semi daily basis my second year at McGill and loved their sandwiches. Going there so often made me want to try other things and I sorta forgot about its existence...until halfway through every fall term when the new grad students would tell me about this ""new place"" they'd discovered called super sandwich. On Monday I went there again as I didn't bring enough food to school and many memories came to mind...Super sandwich, despite its cryptic location, seems to find its way. Their subs are fantastic and really cheap, which makes them ideal for student budgets. If you're in a rush, the longest part of getting lunch will be the ""trek,"" as the sandwich will be ready within 30 seconds of placing your order."
/user_details?userid=iFSMIqF-T2Dmij96kJ07Wg,Vivian H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Yea this place is pretty much Mcgill sandwich haven. So cheap and so fast. Decent sandwich. During finals I'll buy multiple sandwiches and just eat these all day. This is kinda sad.
/user_details?userid=FDrIPHJ76YCmuqOJjCqdOQ,Fernando P.,"Sydney, Australia",5 star rating,This place is a little hidden inside Le Cartier building but worth visiting for any one wanting a quick feed for cheap.It's a convenience store so you have all the basic convenience store goods as well but everyone lines up for the sandwiches. The egg salad as the previous reviewer said is great and the chicken salad is awesome and a whole lot better than most of the crap Subway sell. The bread is fresh and tasty and you'll get it slightly warm when ready.Ever since finding out about this place I've gone every few days and my taste buds and wallet thank me for it.
/user_details?userid=tVl9JkeuEHGFH_ArkDKLCg,Emily H.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,Solid food for a great prices!! I sometimes stock up on their sandwiches and go home to hole up and study!
/user_details?userid=BGsgs7CIvDk7FSolKuy5GA,Heidi H.,"Verdun, Canada",5 star rating,"This is my favorite lunch spot go-to when I forget to pack my lunch (which is admittedly quite often!). Who can ask for more? A huge variety of sandwich fillings and all for under $5 (with taxes, chips and soda) plus or minus a dollar.It sounds silly, but it's cheaper to buy your lunch here than to bring something from home! The French bread is warm and tasty, the fillings freshly cut or made. I love their egg salad sandwich and with a chips and a pop, it comes to $4.75! You will always see a line-up, especially when the students come back for school. I hope they stay in business forever!"
/user_details?userid=zMulYCUXDTXL5ZnQvtZ40Q,Justin C.,"Englewood Cliffs, NJ",5 star rating,"This rating is based on convenience, price, and quality.  A McGill management student might say an awesome cost-benefit given a university student's low budget.  It's also just an awesome sandwich; very big, toasted French bun, and just delicious.  NO McGill, Concordia, or nearby professional should go without having tried a super sandwich.  Prices range from $2.25 to at most $5.000.  The clear favorite is the egg sandwich($2.75).  Can add a soda and bag of chips for $1.75 extra."
