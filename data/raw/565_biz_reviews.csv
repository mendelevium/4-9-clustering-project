/user_details?userid=k4xzJyW2FPMvy4TMUs4D0Q,Jeff T.,"Dollard-Des Ormeaux, Canada",3 star rating,Moa Moa new Korean resturant  located on Wellington street in Verdun . Very small seating around 15 tables We stared off with an order of tempura shrimp which were larger and order tempura vegetables which were very lite batter. We order the original fried chicken half original half soy and honey.  All the dishes were good . The only item we ordered that was not good was the Korean ribs which the server played STUPID !  Overall it was a great meal but never ignore or argue when 6 people all agree that a dish is not right . We hope they understand when a customer spends $200 on a family outing  and they complains about one dish . This could mean the difference of a 5 star vs a 3 star review This was the last dining out experience before the pandemic closed everything for 3 months . We will be back when they reopen for another try .

For both dishes, the flavours were perfect and left us both feeling nourished.  The owner makes her own kimchi, which might be the best I've ever had. I will be back and I certainly recommend it to others."

All were extremely delish and reminded me of my Oma's cooking. The homemade kimchi was perfect! So happy to have this lovely restaurant in our neighborhood. I know we will be back."

It's so hard to get good fried chicken in this city but this place has it beat. A true gem. A blessing from the gods. The staff is super sweet too. Will be my go to spot for as long as I live here.
