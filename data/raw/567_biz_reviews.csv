The building is actually a small grocery store with a kitchen in the back with a small seating area. It's a cafeteria style place. The food is absolutely amazing, I love their spicy onions (pikliz) and the gruot. The portions are pretty big, but it's a lot of rice! That being said, the rice is also really good and the meat just melts in your mouth. I'm eager to try their other dishes and can't wait to go back."
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",5 star rating,MMM is a special place that I recommend you come  to check out. It reminds me of the delicatessens of New York City. Because it's a grocery store with a massive a kitchen in the back. You decide on what you want and pay at the front cash and take your receipt to wait in line and show one of the ladies in the restaurant. On my two recent visits there has been a minimum of two ladies cooking and my last visit there were five ladies preparing the food in the restaurant part of the business. The food here is awesome to say the least. Creole food has been my recent newer addiction as it blends rich flavour spice and texture that I've come to love. On my multiple visits to MMM I've gone with the pork griot plate. It's served piping hot and the pork is tender fresh. Usually I only eat half of it and save the second half for my next days lunch. I need to return back for the conch and lamb plates. If it is as good as the griot I will be returning back as one happy salivating customer again and again. Thank you hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

The most important the give you BIG plate. They have a delivery service. I had the fritay plate, plantain, accra, griot and white fry sweet potatoes. They have a area to sit down. This place is also a food market if you want some Haitian product to shop go at meli melo."
/user_details?userid=LPDOx50zUR-rEovzOhADbA,Rachel C.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"Listen I LOVE Marché Méli-Mélo. I've been here so many times since a friend of mine introduced me to authentic Haitian food, and as long as I'm living in Montreal I will continue to frequently visit! The establishment is a food market with a kitchen in the back that serves hot food. When you walk in head straight to the cash register place your order, and take your ticket to the back to pick up your food. My favorite dish at Méli-Mélo is the lambi, which is conch. Lambi is so yummy!!!! It's cooked in the form of a stew and it's delicious when you pour it over the rice and peas. That brings me to what's served in the dinner; each meal is served with rice and peas, pikelez (sorry if I misspelled that), cold macaroni (not the greatest tbh), and plantains. The serving size is soooo huge I have actually never finished my food at the restaurant. My only complaint is that they used to give out 3 plantains with their dinner but now it's only 2? On a positive note, their drinks are so delicious and I would definitely recommend grabbing one to pair with your food. I love this restaurant and it honestly hits the spot when you're looking for comfort food that tastes like a nice home cooked meal."
/user_details?userid=eG1Tur78lGPRLPysNSzadQ,Donald S.,"Boca Raton, FL",4 star rating,"I see you Méli Mélo! Always good to see my people making moves. A combined neighborhood market and restaurant? This is a concept that has been perfected and I often see from my other people, the Italians (just go with it!).Melo Melo sits on the corner of Jarry and Foucher. This place is non stop, patrons coming in and out throughout the day for various needs. From groceries, to fresh bread, fresh patties(both Haitian and Jamaican), and of course the food, they have it all. There's even a selection of beauty supplies. I'm not sure how but they have managed to fit at least an 8-10 patron seating area in the small pickup corner. That my friend is what I consider maximum space utilization! Food is ordered and paid for at the market counter, and the ticket then brought to the back of the store where it is handed to one of the many working chefs/preparers. What do you get in return for said ticket? How about a massive plate of Haitian classics like griot, fritay, taso, diri kolè, and legume to name a few. How's the food? I'm biased so it's all freaking delusion. If I can put my bias aside for one second I will admit the patè(Haitian patty) is insanely dry, but we won't focus on that....Easily the best Haitian food in Montreal and among the best I've had anywhere to be honest. Even my mom gave the stamp of approval; that's a good place to drop the mic....."

/user_details?userid=uocyYZQypNuRfa6W32Kuvg,Sara F.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,Marché Méli-Mélo was beyond delicious! A friend and I went there during a trip to Montreal this June on the recommendation of so many positive reviews. I'm happy to say that this restaurant definitely lives up to its reputation! The service was quick and cheap and there was more than enough food! The next time I'm in Montreal I'll definitely be stopping by Marché Méli-Mélo again.
/user_details?userid=-d2274Q6FcljUcshAqcWtg,Nhi N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Love this place! I'll definitively come back for their chicken! However, I wasn't a big fan of the griot nor the plantain. It was REALLY dry. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be like this, but in overall, whatever I ordered was really good.As for the service; it's not a restaurant so don't have high expectation on the service. They probably will help you out if it's your first time eating haitian food, but that's pretty much it. You actually need to go to the cashier to order. After paying, you just go give your order to the counter/kitchen people. Simple!"

The rest of the grocery/dep is still open and functioning normally.Not wanting to leave empty-handed, I grabbed a refrigerated container of ""assaisonnement creole.""  I asked how to use it and the woman explained (in french) a couple of easy preparations. Made some fish with it the next day and YUM.  will definitely return once they get back up & running."

They were so patient with our beginners french, and we ordered as best we could. We loved everything! This is a hidden gem! I did so much research before coming to Montreal and I'm so surprised this place never came up. Such rich and flavorful food! I wish I could eat here every week!"
/user_details?userid=lNDdOlmN8lu-YJdB-cwfZQ,Cat R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This place used to be really good but the last 2 times I went I was disappointed,not sure if they changed the kitcheb staff but the rice was burnt, griot and bananes were reallllly dry and the sauce had a weird taste. Im hoping this was just bad luck and that the quality will return. PS try the ginger juice its really yummy and refreshing"
/user_details?userid=Ym-KYBbY8Sf5n7b2-UVnqg,carolyn p.,"CA, CA",4 star rating,"no frills, delicious haitian food that is best for take out. it's in the back of a market. you pay the market's cashier and then wait in a cafeteria-style line. i had the conch stew which was richly flavored. it was salty but went well with the rice & peas and fried plaintains (savory kind like tostones). there are only about 8 seats here and you face white walls lit with fluorescent lighting. it was raining when i went, but next time i'll take it to go and sit at a park or something. i hope that they switch out the styrofoam containers for paper.the food is the real deal here."

/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One if not the best spot for creole/Haitian food in Montreal! My best friend whom i used to date, an Haitian man, made me discover this place some 20 years ago. There was a line-up then. There is still a line-up now for the food!!! EVERYTHING is delicious! The portions are huge. The prices are more then reasonable. I've had it all. My favourite would be the griot or the lambi (conch). I would always order extra bananes pesées and sauce because just in case i get hungry during the night! :) Once, i even drove during a major winter storm just to get my fix. I was probably the only crazy asian lady driving around lol! I've tried other similar places for this cuisine, but nothing comes close to how good this place is!"
/user_details?userid=GkbaBeSGvt-UmIcefpEARA,Andrea L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Méli-Mélo has a little bit of everything for those who are interested in Haitian and Carribean food and culture. There is a grocery store, with giant sacks of beans and rice, cans of interesting fruits and spices, and fresh fruits and vegetables including sugarcane and whatever kind of mangoes are currently in season in Haiti. There is a hot food counter, with wonderful Haitian meals to go, and pâtés Haïtiens at the cash register. There is a case full of Creole-language books and some Creole magazines and newspapers. There is even a service for sending food or flowers to your friends in Haiti.A typical Haitian meal consists of meat with rice (usually riz collé - rice with beans, or riz djon djon - flavoured with black mushrooms), plantain (fried), and maybe some salad or pickleez (spicy pickled cabbage). Griot is cubes of fried pork. Cabri is stewed goat meat. Lambi is conch meat (seafood) and is a special-occasion dish. Chicken (either grilled or in stew) is also typical but I don't know if it has a special name ... c'est juste du poulet.To vary your starch (or add to it), try maïs moulu (similar to polenta) with bean sauce (sos), or véritable (breadfruit).Acra is a kind of cod fritter (savoury) served as an appetizer. Pâtés Haïtiens are different from the more-familiar Jamaican patties (though Méli-Mélo also sells those). You have a choice of beef (rectangular), morue/codfish (triangular) and sometimes chicken (semicircular) filling surrounded by flaky puff pastry. Eat over a plate so that you don't miss the crumbs that are sure to fall off. You can take your pâtés home and reheat them, or take them along to a soccer (football) game if you want to be a real Haitian.Bon appetit !"

/user_details?userid=96qaVyPeoeHBWO-t6GjcOw,Nicolas D.,"Laval, Canada",4 star rating,"Summary: incredible food and the slow service could be improved. I have been to Marché Meli-Melo on a regular basis for the past few years. I always get griot, acras and cola champagne. The pork is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The sauce is savoury and complements the rest of the plate perfectly. Good job! As for the service, a smile would be a minimum."
/user_details?userid=P8hKMc73rWhEnXNV-qA7DA,Liam B.,"Dundalk, MD",5 star rating,"Woohoo! As good as it gets!I knew I was in for a treat when there was a Romados-esque lineup to order. Got myself the griot to go, and ate it on a bench outside. This was somewhere in my top 5 meals ever in this city, and dear God was there a lot of it. You get a very generous helping of pork--I think marinated in that bitter orange stuff--and fried plantains and rice and beans. There's a bigger cup of some sort of vinegary sauce, pea sauce I think, not very hot, and a little cup of pikliz, which is sort of like coleslaw at 100,000 Scoville units. I ate the pikliz in a bite or two and then drizzled the juice over the whole thing--delicious!Unfortunately the zip ties on my bike basket disintegrated a few days ago, or I would have come home with like 69 jars of that pikliz in tow. It's that good."

/user_details?userid=vGohRKrqPgCJak3Jp6nGMA,Thalya L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Short and Sweet!I don't really buy anything else there than a few spices , and plates of food.This place always lives up to my Haitian food cravings. Being Haitian, the food at Méli-Mélo is always good, and always leaves my  tummy full :)The plates of rice and beans and choice of meats are about 10$ bucks. I always have some left over. Its a lot of food.I recommend this spot. Order your food at the counter, take it home, and enjoy your Caribbean goodness!"
/user_details?userid=icho881NakuYDGXcPi4lxg,Katie X.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is, hands down, my favorite place in the city. The griot is transcendent - it is so good that I literally dream about it for weeks in advance. It's tender, moist, crackling, and basically melts in the mouth. The rice and beans are also fantastic - delicately spiced. Plantains are awesome - the cabri is also good, but the griot is what you need to try. Very few other places have griot like this. And the hot sauce and pikliz! Seriously, do not miss if you're in Montreal for a little while."
/user_details?userid=eQUTWWyxist-qjwxmf1cmA,Phineas G.,"Wayne, PA",5 star rating,"This was our first Haitian food experience, and it was excellent!  We found our way to the back of the store where they prepare your orders, but the guy working the register was helpful enough to notice us and let us know that we need to order back at the register. He even let us know about their generous portions, and recommended that we order just one meal for the 2 of us.  This was great advice - it was a ton of food!  We ordered the griot (pork), which came with a couple plantains and an absurd amount of rice and beans.  The rice was perfectly seasoned, and the meat was very tender.  Based on other reviews here, we were hoping for some good food, but the friendly and helpful service really put it over the top!"
/user_details?userid=xguQklz4nRihjIz2L8wY1g,Peter L.,"Chapel Hill, NC",5 star rating,"Awesome Haitian food. Super authentic, the smell will drive you wild. I have no idea how they get such a great flavor so far from Haiti. The boulet, grio, and kabrit are all well worth the wait - 30 min for a Thursday night. They serve it with excellent pikliz, if you need more you can buy a jar or two there. This was definitely the high point of our trip to Montreal. Its one block walk from the nearest Metro station so you have no excuse for not going there."
