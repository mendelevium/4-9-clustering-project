/user_details?userid=JstDKWmAZsL026ADFxf7fw,Tony Kangrui L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow, so this is a hidden gem that I rediscovered after about 10 years. In fact, I've had so many disappointments with tourist trappy restaurants on this block (not to mention many beggars) that I completely ignored the area. Like any time I go to an authentic Italian pizzeria, I ordered a simple margherita pizza.What I liked:- A delicious crust that's thin on the inside and chewy with just the right amount of crunch on the edge. Truly good.- The garlicy tomato sauce- The thick chewy layer of mozzarella that gave body and substance to the pizza- Despite the restaurant being super busy when I arrived (waited nearly 30 minutes to get my pizza), the quality and craftsmanship of the pizza was tops. - It's enough food for 2 people. I eat a lot and I was hungry and my favorite song is 21 Savage ""a lot"" and I thought it was a lot.- Quality/price. I was surprised when I got the bill, menu prices were tax included, which means this heck of a good pizza was $13 tax-in. One of the last few affordable luxuries if you ask me.What could have been improved:- more basilThis place is so legit. This city is so legit."
/user_details?userid=JoVrzT6QTcTeRmXQdQg02w,Yvette G.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I keep coming back. Every single item on the menu is delicious! This time, we got the arancini, pasta carbonara, Dei Compari pizza and the lava cake. All AMAZING. They also have a terrace. Our waiter, Ciro, was fantastic. It was a very busy night and he managed to be composed, attentive, smiling, and friendly. You know where to find me this summer - either here, or at the gym."
/user_details?userid=UgAl1BXZjJWUAdvVixwhew,Eden L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I passed by the pizzeria several times and always there is a line. This time it was rainy so the terrace was closed. We waited about 15 mins on a weekday evening. The restaurant was packed the whole evening. We had two pizzas. They were both tasty but mine had anchovies which was too salty and unbearable for me. We will definitely come back for other options on the menu. The prices on the menu were tax included.
/user_details?userid=vj-gGhmf8zw4FJiJ4oWGjQ,Beantpreet K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I think I have finally found my favourite Italian restaurant in Montreal. Yay! I ordered veggie tomato sauce pasta, gratin style, which was the best decision. Cannot begin to describe how flavourful and delicious it was. Their staff is super friendly and very helpful with the food and wine suggestions. We went on a busy night so the food took longer to come. Their tiramisu was the bomb! Flavourful, right temperature and great texture - just perfect! Highly recommend this place for some authentic Italian food. I honestly felt like I was in Italy because of the way it's set-up, the entire vibe and their staff. I will be going back to try more dishes and pizza as well."
/user_details?userid=SGr-sicgWm3mIImhxEIjiQ,DoYeon K.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is amazing! Great service, amazingly cozy atmosphere, it feels like someone's home here. The pizza oven is out for you to see the chefs prepare and cook it.Very reasonable prices too, especially for takeout there's a discount. We ordered for takeout delicious pizza and pasta for $24 only.Would come back again for sure!"
/user_details?userid=aaO1q0UjU2628uIAOrMoSA,Roberto R.,"Los Angeles, CA",3 star rating,"Pizza was tasty and fresh, nice amount of toppings where it was hearty and filling! Poutine and wings were also a good selection to try. Wings were the best of the buy!"
/user_details?userid=YF3v4Kpyg_YZkb_RTqAKwg,Sarah T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Came here during the later part of the lunch hour and this place was packed. There was a line of hungry people wanting pizza. I went here based on some recommendations.  Since it was really busy and it seemed like there was only three servers for the restaurant, the service was a bit slow. I got the broccoli pizza, which was huge and full of toppings (olives,mushrooms) plus they were generous with the cheese. The only thing was that a lot of the broccoli pieces included were the stalks which is not as nice as the florets. Other then that, the price versus quality was really good especially for a place on St-Denis."
/user_details?userid=nEe8YTQ_EwlnMvNzElN_9A,Brance S.,"Patuxent River, MD",5 star rating,I lived in Napoli Italy for a few years and this pizza is the closest to true Italian pizza.  Best pizza in North America.
/user_details?userid=7b_KYbyhEa40hNz1qdIa6Q,Fred K.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I always like restaurants where you can see inside the kitchen, and while that's not exactly the case here, they have a giant oven in the middle of the restaurant where you can see the pizzas going in, and it has this giant wheel that turns as they cook. It's a place where you still have to pay at the cash (the only reason I don't give it 5 stars) so I tend to forget it's there until I'm walking out. I usually end up sitting by the window looking out at Rue Saint Denis which is a little further away from it. I've always loved their pizzas, but I ordered their gnocchi one night when my stomach felt off and I wanted to avoid dairy and I must say I find myself craving that as often as I crave their pizza. For the location and the quality the price is reasonable. Tonight I had gnocchi w/ bolognese sauce (I added green peppers which I wouldn't do again there), my wife had 4 cheese pizza, she had a glass of wine, I stuck to water, our bill was under under $40 before tip. For that area, that is GREAT. The service is always good, it's walking distance from the Saint Denis exit of the Berri-UQAM metro station, street parking is a hassle anywhere in Montreal during peak hours, it's slightly harder than average, but not to the point that it should deter you (I worked nearby for awhile and I periodically get short term contracts from another business nearby), I'm usually fine when I'm in that area so long as I'm patient.It's really one of my favourite spots. Part of me kicks myself for potentially drawing in more people, but I'm also watching a lot of my favourite spots close, so I'm taking the stance that it shouldn't hurt to help! Happy eating!!!"
/user_details?userid=Oc5rYRLu0Bu_Zj18V0h2xw,Bill L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,I use a very small mobility scooter. I wanted to support the restaurant because it's one of few places in the area with an accessible entrance . However after I entered they refused to serve me because of the scooter even though they were not busy at all . Only three tables were in use. They made no attempt to accommodate me and no apology .
/user_details?userid=KRc6f0VF2BAF_6QYcp2GIQ,Victor M.,"Warsaw, Poland",5 star rating,"This is probably one of the best pizza places in Montreal,I have been ordering takeout (much cheaper than dine in) here for years and we even have a pizza thursday at work dedicated to this place!I would recommend the montrealaise pizza but you can't go wrong with a classic cheese! I will keep coming back here, their crust is amazing and thin, their cheese is scrumptious and they offer spicy oil that completes the meal!"
/user_details?userid=xjZOqBiFoIk4YLNv7QTgVA,Bader H.,"Pierrefonds, Canada",5 star rating,"My favourite pizza and pasta place in Montreal! Their pizza beats some of the more popular places around the city that are more known. Try the Gambiri pizza, you won't regret it!"
/user_details?userid=xyvmFSEsLOYVxsAnhn5Aug,Mackenzie S.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,I'm visiting from Texas and this was the first restaurant we picked. Everything here was so so good!! Probably the best pizza I've ever had. And there are so many options. Honestly I might go back again before we leave in a week. Definitely try it out!
/user_details?userid=Cnb-zc14XLXV0A3rri_q8w,Shazia K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my favorite pizza places! I always go for the shrimp pizza but there are so many different pizzas to try out. The portions are big  and the desserts are to die for. I strongly recommend the chocolate tartuffo, which was the highlight of my night. Service has always been great and fast despite the large crowds."
/user_details?userid=QGgeQ3dAzK4cFzDDCwLxsQ,Micho B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"There is a great ambiance , the service is good and the selection of Pizza and wine is great.  However mention to them that you don't want too much cheese because mine had so much that it felt chewy, also the center of the crust was still undercooked. That doesn't make the pizza bad, it's just not exactly excellente per say. Oh and the cheese is shredded mozzarella,  delicious, but not traditional"
/user_details?userid=OHTXFa3YQY0cB0nzHgjhRw,Yi T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Alright, so I had ordered pizzas for delivery from this place back in January, and it was amazing. Thin crust, lots of toppings, very reasonable price (I think it was around 12$ for the 4 cheese pizza?). Clearly the best pizza I've had in Montreal. And the order arrived quite fast too. Fast forward to today: we were in the area and decided to try the sit-in experience. I had a good memory of the 4 cheese, so I took it again, noticing a slight price increase to 16$. No big deal, it was well worth it. Sadly, they were not as generous with the toppings this time. The description on the menu says ""gorgonzola, goat cheese, emmental and mozzarella"", yet my pizza barely had 2 pieces of gorgonzola, and there was overall less mozzarella than in my memory. Oh well. Still a great pizza, with a thin, perfectly cooked crust, and quick service. I'd probably actually give this place 3.5 stars, but I was surprised and delighted that all prices on the menu actually included taxes. This would still be one of my go-to pizza places."
/user_details?userid=9KpMzih4E_gEioFtNeuIIw,Jade M.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"Visited this place on sat evening and had a line queuing outside. Waited for about 30 min before we were seated. Really wanted to try their pasta but ended up having their Marine pizza - the one with clams, shrimps, and onions.The pizza overall is OK, but I really like their cola drink they got which is made with maple syrup - u can really taste the syrup in the cola. Maybe too sweet for some, but I think it's brill!!!! WE NEED MORE MAPLE SYRUP IN THIS WORLD!!!!"
/user_details?userid=jvDAsNqwPIQapRiEQdoTGg,Ashley G.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"This is my go to pizza place in the city. It's a convenient location, well priced and great portions. They use wood ovens here so the pizza is that much better! 10/10 would recommend this delicious pizza :)"
/user_details?userid=Dn6zGa9HXNLr3a71PhMySg,Jenny J.,"Louisville, KY",4 star rating,Very good and reasonably priced pizza! Came here based on a recommendation from the front desk at our nearby hotel and did not leave disappointed. Service is good as well. The Caesar salad is fine. The large is more than enough for two if you're also sharing a pizza. Do the demi. English and French speaking. Lots of locals.
/user_details?userid=G4Iu-61mvLA55GyBmAhrXg,Rebecca M.,"Middletown, NY",4 star rating,"Saw a line outside and decided to go with the flow and wait in line. Luckily my friend and I were seated within ten minutes. It was a beautiful night to sit outside. My friend had the Margherita pizza, and I had the Saint Denis pizza. The dough was so soft with prefect amount of sauce. My friend said it was probably one of the best thin crust pizza he's ever had, or maybe he was just extremely hungry. Definitely a nice spot to visit when you're in the area."
/user_details?userid=Z374Ok46YdkmWqa__9nAjA,Allie S.,"Cambridge, MA",4 star rating,"Great sit down pizza place on the Latin Quarter. Plenty of seating inside as well as in the outdoor patio. We ordered a Margherita pizza and a calzone. Both were very good and the servings were large. Staff was attentive but the place was packed so it took some time to get our order. Definitely a good pace to visit if looking for a nicer place for pizza rather than one of the many cheap, quick serve pizza locations near the campus."
/user_details?userid=F6MPrQ5oxQL2Wq1v5ENDzA,Robert S.,"Providence, RI",4 star rating,"Very good Italian food on St Denis.     This area tends to be very touristy, but Dei Compari delivers good food at good prices.We saw everyone eating pizza so we ordered a chicken pizza and a penne arrabbiata.    Both were good.The grilled pizza was thin and crisp with a good fresh set of toppings.  The pasta dish was nice and spicy.    Delicious.One odd thing....as we were waiting for our food, we asked for a basket of bread...the waitress, took a basket that was on a table next to us (it looked that I had not been touched by guests that had just gotten up and left) and placed the ""used basket"" on our table...we were starving, so we ate the bread....  LOL..."
/user_details?userid=Dz0orjf7qlKzRmv6iAP25g,Aria P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,They have great Italian pizzas. The pricing is also fair.The lady assuming manager or owner was responding in French when we were asking stuff in English which was a bit strange for my friends. Maybe we took it in a wrong way :)
/user_details?userid=_BKBoVSr4VoVNXsCYXpm7g,Lindsay M.,"Fort Thomas, KY",4 star rating,"The shrimp pizza here is amazing!!! I highly recommend.  I haven't dined in, typically getting to go, but consistently good food."
/user_details?userid=UC-hIxfID337BK6KV65XBg,Natalie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Amazing pizza!! Maybe the best in the city. It is thin crust, made in a wood oven, with plenty of toppings. We had the Marguerita pizza and 4 cheese pizza. The Marguerita was so good. The pizza maker (who was very impressive by the way) put the basil underneath the cheese so that it wouldn't burn. The basil tasted so so good like that!! The four cheese pizza was essentially 1 piece with mozzarella, 1 piece with gorgonzola, 1 with emmenthal and one with goat cheese. It was delicious! The gorgonzola was a little too liquidy. It kind of just spilled, but I'm sure if we would have waited for it to cool, it would have been fine. It was all so delicious! We will definitely be back!Also, the menu prices include tax. The Marguerita pizza was $11 with tax and the 4 cheese was $15 I think."
/user_details?userid=qcxknfhTk_MptuNXk4o9Zg,Nair F.,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",4 star rating,Nice and inexpensive pizza. We ordered the goat cheese one and was gone in no time! Yum!
/user_details?userid=ZGiwU16rhGvWAYUzkWL0xw,Boz X.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Heard the pizzas are baked in a stone oven, just like how it's supposed to be done, so we decided to give it a try.We were seated at the terasse, on a warm summer night. Very busy street and good atmosphere.  We had the 'Dei Compari' and the 'Marinara' pizzas. The 'Dei Compari' was a bit burnt on the edge, but it was still delicious. The tomato sauce was very good, the amount of cheese was just right. The combination of flavors was excellent. The only thing that was somewhat of a let down was the italian sausage. It wasn't very tasty, it might as well have been mushrooms. Maybe spicy sausages would be better.The 'Marinara' (with shrimps and clam) was better than I had anticipated. I love seafood, but I don't get too excited when it comes to Montreal seafood. To my surprise, the shrimps didn't taste like seaweed (as they do in some restaurants). The pizza had a perfect hint of seafood taste, totally not overwhelming. Good flavors in general, coming from good combinations of ingredients. It comes down to about 18$ per pizza with everything included. The portion was relatively huge, so I hope you're hungry when you show up."
/user_details?userid=BV4JgU-lDQbhbdE7cR2JWQ,Cheyanne M.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"I was craving pizza and decided to walk 25 mins from my hotel to this place because of the good reviews even though there were a lot of closer options. I'm SO HAPPY I did! I ordered a margarita pizza to-go and the entire experience was wonderful. The staff was so kind and you can tell they genuinely care about you having a good experience. While I was waiting for my pizza (which only took 10 mins) they brought me a glass of water without me having to ask. That gesture really stuck out to me because most of the other places I've been in Montreal you have to hound the wait staff for water and for refills when you're eating out and they don't seem to be very attentive. When I got back to my hotel and took the first bite I literally said ""mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"" out loud. This is hands down the best pizza I've had since I went to Italy about a year ago!! The tomato sauce, the cheese, the crust, the basil.... Everything was perfect.My only regret is not finding this place sooner on my trip!"
/user_details?userid=S6mueskv7VrcoF5K8-vUXg,Pat C.,"Laval-des-rapides, Laval, Canada",1 star rating,I've had some really good pizza in Montreal and this is definitely not one of them. We were a group of 4. We each took a pizza. The pizza crust and dough were really undercooked and tasted like flour. It was very soggy and just a mess. Really disappointing. Avoid at all costs.
/user_details?userid=6LWMo1yVMPa3APHCGOggGQ,Nicole Z.,"East Haven, CT",5 star rating,"In a recent trip to Montreal, my boyfriend and I were walking up the street one night and saw that this place was the most crowded outside. We came here the next night for dinner and did not leave disappointed. We waited to be seated for about 15 minutes but it wasn't too bad for a Saturday night. There's a ton of different pizzas on the menu, and you can create your own. They come in one size and definitely need to be eaten with a fork and knife. Very tasty!"

I figured if theres a line it must be good. Im glad we waited. Their pizza was amazing. The cheese was just right, the sauce was well balanced. I ordered the hawaiian pizza and im sorry I have to say this being a new Yorker but it was pretty up there in great pizza. The crust was tasty as well. I would go back to Montreal just to have their pizza again"

/user_details?userid=HrGD05BcN4nqyccdmf3sbw,Matt M.,"Hamilton, Canada",1 star rating,Saggy pizza. Not tasty at all. Felt horrible all day. Not recommended. I might as well have eaten bagel and cream cheese.
/user_details?userid=M2fjARghKjaHWh7psiDXPg,Luis M.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Walked into this pizzeria while looking for a place to have a quick bite to eat shortly after arriving in Montreal. This place did the trick!We got seated and our order taken right away.We ordered the garlic bread and then a Pizza to share. Our order came right away and they were both very good. They have a wood burning oven and the pizza is prepared from scratch right before your eyes.Affordable and good, what else can you ask for?!I'll definitely come back next time I'm in the mood for pizza.3 stars only since this is a casual place where you go for a quick bite. Nothing memorable."
/user_details?userid=Drr9IQ_VnB-8yiUyt-jBPw,Cently R.,"Paris, France",2 star rating,"Ate here 1 and 1/2 times. The first time I really enjoyed the pizza but the service was slow. Being a pizza lover and living so close by I returned. The 2nd time was awful, we were rudely seated, then left to wait for literally 10 minutes. When we made eye contact with the waitress to place our order, she ignored us. We tried a second time, but the waitress said it was another waitress's table. After close to 15 minutes of waiting, we got up and left!"

They serve thin crust pizzas. My husband also tried their pastas with rosse sauce and it turned out to be delish. We came back for more the day after :)."
/user_details?userid=nwn-39vTU5OP1H6iiqMPyQ,Chris B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,excellent price to quality ratio. pizza is handmade and coal/wood oven fired. one size = medium/large. they load on the fresh/quality toppings. fast service from no nonsense middle aged quebecoise ladies. pies average 10$ and prices include tax. pizza places like this are few and far between in montreal - it is not overly fancy/expensive and not pizzahut-like. just a good place to get a decent pie on the way home after a busy day with the change left in my car's ashtray. i call in my order before pickup - they're terse: name and number are unnecessary.
