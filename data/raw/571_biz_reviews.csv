/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Ordered Chicken Cheese Katsu & Beef Bibimbap through Uber Eats! Everything was excellent, and the food is definitely at par with Ganadara! We are so ecstatic to have found this place!! Especially loved the Chicken Katsu. The Bibimbap was delicious but didn't have enough beef. However that's probably a one time issue. The portions were big, ingredients fresh & the sauces included on the side went perfectly with the food! Will definitely be ordering again very very soon!"

/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Hands down one of the best Korean restaurants in Montreal. Located right across of the Cote-Vertu metro station, it is rather accessible. I went there for dinner during a weekday at dinner time and we were seated quickly. Their menu includes all the dishes offered in Korean restaurants, such as chicken katsu meals, kimbap, sudunbu, etc. As we were hungry we ordered all of the above plates mentioned and a pajeon (seafood pancake) as well. The service was prompt and very good. The wait for the food was reasonable as well. Once the food came, I was greatly surprised by the quality of the food served. I had the chicken katsu plate: the chicken breading was very crisp. The kimbap and pajeon was shared and both was very good and tasty. This place is definitively worth the detour and I will come back for sure whenever I have a craving for Korean food."

/user_details?userid=FC4pv39ySRWMAAWyYdGwIQ,Viviane M.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,This place encompasses traditional and savoury Korean food all while remaining affordable ! Definitely recommend this place to those who want to enjoy authentic Korean food.
/user_details?userid=VseHlPAVhHbNZqyl_zRKBQ,Stephanie C.,"Pierrefonds-Roxboro, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Located next to Cote-Vertu metro and close to Vanier College, this cute family-run resto is a go-to for cozy Korean food! This small place tends to get packed, but I've always managed to be seated fairly quickly. I've tried a couple dishes from their fried chicken, their bulgogi and their chicken katsu cheese dishes, which were all simply tasty. Their fried chicken and katsu are fried perfectly without being greasy, and are always well seasoned. As for their bulgogi, although I've had better, it was still pretty good and generous in portions.Overall, the food is good, served in a decent portion and is quite reasonable, and the staff is always pleasant. The only downside is this place tends not to take last minute orders close to their closing time, so make sure to come early enough or get ready to take take-out."

/user_details?userid=QYKYfSNHAkaE4Vf0lNqBFQ,Amanda U.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"There are a few korean restaurants on boulevard decarie, and I havent been to this one. So why not try it out! So far, we ve come twice for lunch, and both time we left satisfied. There are lots of paid parking, but if you are patient enough, you can find free residential parking.We were seated at the back of the restaurant with our children, and you could see the restaurant was quite busy at lunch time. Either college students or people working nearby would come to grab a quick bite, some seems to be regulars. We tried the soft pork tofu stew, sweet and sour fried chicken, LA galbi and the meat japchae. Spicy Kimchi was also served.Service was straightforward as it was busy."
/user_details?userid=5XNwv2vKuAKFyj1nBUaPOg,Jason A.,"Nepean, Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"Great option for lunch! We ordered the bento box, bibimbap, and soft tofu stew (soondubu) and each was good. I would say the taste is more home-style and not super heavy on flavour which is not always a bad thing. That said, the breaded chicken was very memorable as it was juicy and breaded just right. Will definitely come back to get the breaded chicken and try some of their other dishes!Note that the entrance is up a couple of stairs. We had to carry our stroller up but luckily there was some space to park it inside."
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I had an enjoyable Dolsot Bibimbap Bulgogi served in a hot sandstone bowl. The dish was well presented and everything was very tasty. I was however a little disappointed by the rarity of bulgogi in the bowl.Service was friendly, small family owned resto that normally would have been easy to miss on a busy Decarie street. Worth the visit would come again!Price-tag was decent."
/user_details?userid=xDg4gp_oBUudXbZz31yf-A,Helena U.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I'm so glad they've opened in Ville St-Laurent! It is situated 1 minute from metro Cote vertu which is a plus! The place is small and has few tables but enough to welcome around 30 people. I've been there many times and I've never been disappointed by the food. The portion is pretty big and the prices are really reasonnable compared to other Korean places. For reference,  a plate of rice cakes is 8$+tax. The staff are so nice and courteous. It is definitely a hidden gem and I encourage people to try it if they feel the crave!"

/user_details?userid=Xgnkm6ryeHNtdIlpPJ5YqQ,Huyn N.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Warm and cozy like your home! This is the 4th time I return to this place. Theirs food are authentic and flavorful. I always order boneless chicken with sweet sauce ( I dont really remember name of the sauce) it's tender inside and crispy outside. If you're a fan of fried food, it worth a try. The soup is a little bit too spicy but if you have it with rice, it's gonna reduce a little bit. He rice with galbi LA is great! Tender and flavorful. Add to that, this restaurant is a family business so the decoration is really simple. The price is not that expensive ( 37$ for 2 persons for this meals in the photo down below). Really recommended!"
/user_details?userid=9Q_qS7lSFB1wLvMkFNDvMA,Zania N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Nice atmosphere and awesome food. I go there once in a while when I want filling food for a decent price. I generally get the tonkatsus with cheese those are to DIE for :)

Bibimbap chicken is good and epine pork soup is worth to order. My sis said the pancake, fried chicken and tteokbokki are not special so better to order somewhere else."

/user_details?userid=0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,Cindy Feng Xin L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I heard from friends that this restaurant is like Ganadara in Côte-Vertu, I would say... not even close. I have tried quite a lot of Korean restaurants in Montreal and I am not expecting much from Bol Orange, and I was quite right. The food is fine in general and the restaurant is quite cosy, it's just that nothing was outstanding. We ordered pork bone soup, tuna kimbap, seafood pancake and steamed chicken dumplings. The price is fair and the service was quick. Credit and debit cards are accepted."

The food tastes authentic and is very reasonably priced and the portion are generous. I recommend: - the bibimbap in the stone bowl - the seafood spicy soup - and of course, the fried chicken. They have a good varied menu, everything looks delicious honestly. The place is very casual, its really a place you go to just eat, not necessarily spend an evening. The only minus to this place is that the service is pretty slow.. expect to wait 30 minute before getting your order, but overall, its a good place to get your korean fix :)"
/user_details?userid=TRHyQ2-3b92RyIKoozsotw,Andre N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great Korean place to eat at, place is cozy mom and pap shop. Food is great and taste authentic. Friendly and good service. Would recommend the Katsu pork/chicken cutlet or dolsot bibimbap bowls"
/user_details?userid=V6ZGCQKKF7elDVuT1j8iEA,Haben J. L.,"Mont-Royal, Canada",4 star rating,Great experience I tried the Dolsot Bibimbap for the very first time and it was so good (the bowl was hot as hell and I tried not to touch it so I wouldn't burn myself)My brother had a chicken ramen and he liked it My dad had something ( I don't remember the name of the dish ) and he like itDownsides: my dad's plate was a bit broken so he didn't really like that part. When you arrive the tables don't have the ustensils ready for the table.Go to Bol Orange !Btw before going to Bol Orange I was starting to starve and after eating there I didn't feel full at all just great !
/user_details?userid=fBWT9xj7NV-v54DpwIqplA,Lucy L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Bol Orange is an adorable family-run Korean restaurant beside Côte-Vertu metro station. The food is delicious and very reasonably priced (about 10$/dish).We ordered a bowl of regular rice cakes which had just the right balance of spicy and sweet. The sauce was super flavourful and we even mixed some into the hot plate bulgogi bibimbap. We also had some seafood pancake which was chewy but missing a bit of taste (the sauce was a bit too salty).We cooled down our tastebuds with some red bean shaved ice containing a decent amount of soft mochis Overall a lovely meal and very friendly service. Will definitely be back to try some more.

/user_details?userid=McPdGlOf-Mv58CLMofj7HA,Craighton Y.,"Cleveland, OH",4 star rating,"On business travel perhaps my favorite thing to do is check out the local food scene. I decided to drive around the area and stumbled upon this place and gave it a try. This looks like your typical ""hole in the wall"" family owned and run restaurant and I must say it was very good! Service was ok but the food was worth the visit. Everything on the menu is say was reasonably priced. I ordered the bibimbap and I side of veggie dumplings. They were out of the veggie so I ended up getting chicken instead. The main course was very good along with the spicy sauce served on the side. Next time I'm in town , I'd give this place another try. Seemed like a good neighborhood area and the food was worth the visit."
/user_details?userid=sV3awT0mQ5CU_VdpVAwpTA,Sandy S.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,"This is an awsome korean restaurant. Very simple. Small menu. Food tastes delicious. The owner is very mild, doesn't talk much but is very attentive to the customers and is kind. It seems his wife is the cook (not sure though) But she's a great chef and give us a nice come back again goodbye. We ordered the bulgogi hot stone bibimbap. It came as the usual sizzling hot with a side of their spicy red sauce. It was delicious. Only negative would be we could barely tastes the meat since their was so little of it in the bowl. But for $10 we were still satisfied. Overall will definitely go back since we live in the area and dont always want to drive far for korean."

/user_details?userid=iJ_sn6RfwO5unR9YgFTd4Q,Camille R.,"Côte-des-Neiges, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,I was really excited to see an authentic Korean place open in my neighbourhood. But sadly the food was ok. Portions were small for the price. I would not go back. And the service was slow and rude.
/user_details?userid=uL-wG1rTsdekOYxHW-PoBg,Yau-Kwan Y.,"New Milford, NJ",1 star rating,Do not come here if you are hungry and it's late. The restaurant closes at 10. However you may not eat in after 9:00pm. You are only allowed to take out which makes no sense. They said it would take too long to serve and for us to eat so we were not allowed to sit or order. If you post on the door that you are open till 10:00 and I get there before 10 I should be allowed to order and eat. Even if I go over 10 minutes after you are done with service you still have to clean the kitchen. I don't know how this place got 4.5 stars. Will not be coming back and will warn others to stay away as well.
/user_details?userid=lTMcCiqtPrjpUFW0LboFCQ,Sandra V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,So happy we gave this place a try because it doesn't look like much from the outside but it's pretty awesome . The beef bim bim bap was delicious and fresh. The fried dumplings didn't taste frozen for once and they came with this herby dipping sauce that was amazing. Their sweet and sour fried chicken was so good I almost ate the whole container. Really addictive food. Staff was nice and attentive and the prices are reasonable. Bim bim baps are 12$ dumplings were 7$ and a portion of fried chicken was 9$. The clientele is mostly students from what I saw but I was only there long enough to pick-up food on a Friday. It's definitely busy though with a lineup starting to form around 7pm. It's worth whatever wait is necessary and we'll be back with friends.

/user_details?userid=KjYelRAd3lVB0heHBUqoCg,Eva C.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a cozy family-run restaurant that serves some common Korean comfort foods. The few times I've been there so far, I've had the bimbimbap in the dolsot a couple time. Authentic and tasty! I've also tried their friend chicken (both pieces and the boneless types they make and sell). It's unfortunate the borough had converted the small nearby parking lot into what seems to be an under-utilized public space, otherwise, I'd swing by this place more often. I'll find a way though!"

/user_details?userid=aKS86u1m42O8Oa2tWCfSSA,Stacy R.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I just recently started my quest of korean restaurant outside of dtown  so I decided to give Bol Orange a try. We tried the cheese ramen, the spicy fried chicken and brochette of rice cake. Everything was good with the right amount of spicy and very very tasty. I wish the chicken served didn't look like this frozen chicken wing we buy in bags in supermarkets. The restaurant seems like it's family run and they were very friendly despite a bit a of language barrier.If you are looking for a fancy restaurant , this is jot the place for you. However, it's good enough for a feel good lunch or supper with friends."

I first hesitated because it looks like a small random place but thank God I went with my gut feeling. They're bim bap plates are delicious. The chicken is what I took and it was flavorful, tender and healthy came with veggies and hot rice in a hot bol! I would surely recommend it to everyone & the people are so sweet and it feels like a family based restaurant."

My kids love it and so does my wife and I. The menu selection is not extensive but enough selections and what is listed is very good and tasty. It is a sure bet for us when we are looking for a bite to eat. Rice cakes, dolsat bibimbap, soft tofu, spicy chicken are all winners. Most of the dishes are too spicy for my kids but they love the dolsat bibimpap which is not spicy and a favourite for my kids. After dinner, you can save some room to head over for a mini ice cream at La Diperie :)"

Everything was amazing and so far the best i've had in the montreal area! Around 12pm there started being more people and at 12h10 it was full, so if you arrive a bit before 12 you should be fine for getting good seats and quick service."
