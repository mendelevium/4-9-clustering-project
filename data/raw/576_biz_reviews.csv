Every tartare on the menu is 15$ except the weekly special. Tried 3 different kinds: mexican shrimp, mexican salmon and maple bacon shrimp. Overall, they were flavorful and good, but the flavor kind of overpowered the natural salmon or shrimp taste. It also comes with salad, soup or chips. The salad has a nice vinaigrette and was fresh. The chips were very crispy. The soup however was extremely bland. It seemed like they forgot to put salt or seasonning inside. The service is great. We got our food quickly and the servers were very friendly. The place is small but very modern and clean. They also have a terrasse outside."

They slapped some roasted wasabi flavoured peas and some pomegranates and called it an asian style tartare. It's a no for me. thank you, next. My friend had the Mexican style salmon tartare and while it did had a bit of a spicy kick to it, it still wasn't much flavourful. Aesthetically speaking though, this place is as cute as it can be and very "" instagrammy "". But unfortunately, this doesn't make up for the lack of flavours, and so didn't live up to my expectations so I'll be less likely to come back."

The concept of the place is unique and the whole menu is just tartares and poke bowls  (how amazing is that?) As a huge fan of tartares, me and my bf absolutely loved the variety of dishes offered. We tried Mexican (salmon), Caribbean (tuna) and pub (beef) tartares and they were all super delicious! Tartares come with a salad, chips or a soup, so you can choose what you like. Amazing place, cozy atmosphere, perfect for a date night. We will definitely come back!"
