/user_details?userid=MWCPUFk-fnNXehPosCtwHA,Geneviève F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"From my experience so far, best Indian food for delivery. It's a tad more expensive, but you can also taste the higher quality ingredients. So far, I've enjoyed Butter Chicken, Saag Paneer & Vegetable Korma. All three were great with noticeably different flavour profiles. The Naan bread was big enough for 2 people. What I particularly appreciate is the Veggie Korma as in some other places I've felt the vegetables were boring/frozen and at Atma it was good! Looking forward to trying other dishes too. May revisit review later :) Cheers!"

We asked about vegan dishes and lucky for us most of the ones on the vegetarian menu were easy to make vegan. We tried the tardka dal, chana masala, dal makhni and the eggplant dish too and they were packed with flavour even dough they were missing all the dairy that typically is added to the vegetarian dishes. The roti was vegan too, so we got them. My only complaint would be that the prices are a bit high but the portions were moderate so we were happy!"
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Found this place on Yelp and recommended to my friend that we come here for dinner. We had made reservations earlier during the day so we were seated immediately after we arrived. We were pleasantly surprised by the ambiance. The restaurant has dim lighting and tasteful interior. Seemed like a hotspot for couples on dates! Our servers were friendly and efficient. We decided to order several things for the table to share between us. The food was brought to the table almost immediately. We had ordered Paneer Saag, Lamb Curry, Tarka Daal, Garlic Nan's & Rice. The quality of the ingredients was great, however the food majorly lacked flavour. It was bland and unexciting. We barely ate 1/4 of the meal. Our bill was around a $80. I'm of South Asian origin and was disappointed by the lack of ommph in the meal."
/user_details?userid=O3jHYGe0JBtbcENWJIxvHA,Nicolle G.,"Woodbridge, Vaughan, Canada",1 star rating,":(Not sure why this place has good reviews... the food doesn't taste very good.The paratha was dry, bland, tough, and cardboard like. The korma was weirdly super sugary, almost like a dessert.The pakora was bland and soft.On top of being bad it was also expensive, I paid $65 for two main dishes, rice, paratha and pakora. I'd be totally fine with the price if it tasted good but it didn't.  I only ate this food because I feel bad about wasting :("
/user_details?userid=E3OyZh9aLWhKX2ctlMT_4Q,Jessica C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Don't get me started on how rich and creamy the butter chicken is - SOOO good!The restaurant has really nice decor and has a romantic ambience - dim-lighting, cozy seating, and candle-light on the tables. Most tables are for 2-4 people, but they have really cute booths for larger groups. We ordered garlic naan bread,  butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, pillau rice, cucumber raita, and mango chutney. They served us papadum to start, which was yummy and helped open our appetite.I HIGHLY recommend the garlic naan, butter chicken, pillau rice, and cucumber raita. This combination was SOOOO delicious! My boyfriend and I still crave this creamy and flavourful butter chicken till this day (and it's been a few months). The chicken tikka masala was a little on the drier side and was not as flavourful. Also, the mango chutney was a little too sweet for our liking.Service was really good, super friendly but a little on the slower side. As for pricing, it was reasonable (~$25-$35 per person).Tips: Make a reservation beforehand because they do get busy for dinner. Also, ask the server if the food you ordered is enough - he recommended that 1 pillau rice was enough for the both of us and was right!"

Having read amazing reviews, I decided to give this restaurant a chance. The food was a - ok and b - very spicy. And this place is a bit on the pricey side. 3/4 of us got sick after eating here. Never going back and won't recommend this place."
/user_details?userid=akCG-uYnMqaRR0fr1zpyig,David G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I've dined in the resteraunt once and ordered deliver/takeout a couple times. It's a little pricier than most Indian places but I think that the quality is noticably better. I usually get the chicken Tikka masala and garlic naan which I highly reccomend. They put a generous amount of meat in the chicken Tikka masala unlike most places. The resteraunt has a nice classy atmosphere as well. You can also order it to be delivered on foodora.
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Indian with a twist! One of the coolest spots on st Laurent. As soon as you walk in there's a gorgeous long bar where you can wait for a drink before you're seated or actually just grab a seat there to eat if it's packed. They have a little relaxation seat in the window filled with rocks gives a zen feel to the place on busy nights.Service was great and food was excellent. The samosa was our favourite part it wasn't your average fried 2 piece samosa with a sweet sauce instead it was open faced and was all mixed up with a great sauce. The tandoori shrimp were packed with flavour and spice, if you don't like spicy then I suggest you let them know or pick something else. Butter chicken was great not to sweet and not to tomatoey just right. The lamb korma was perfect they nailed it And of course you have to do the tandori platter it's to good!Great owner and great servers. If you're looking for a large group area they have a cool seating beside the stairs a big table or at the top of the restaurant they have a spot with large booths where you take your shoes off and walk on to fluffy carpet."

Atma is especially good for vegetarians, feels like there is a bigger range of veggie dishes here than the usual, and plenty of protein options. I forgot to take pictures before ravaging all the containers but we tried samosa chaat (so good), malai kofta (tasty! Like chickpea dumplings), matter paneer (soooo good), rice, and cheesey stuffed naan. Even outside of the romantic decor in their restaurant this food is really, really good. It does a number on my stomach but I feel like it's burning the cold out of me and it tastes so dang good it's totally worth it."
/user_details?userid=-Rx_HJIBFbtJDcNtYmxtsw,Mani S.,"Yonkers, NY",5 star rating,Excellent food and ambience. My friends and I came here for dinner and where seated on the top floor. We had to take our shoes off and sit in a small sofas. It was very comfortable and gave you the experience of being in India. The service was fast and the food was delicious. I would recommend the butter chicken and lamb curry.
/user_details?userid=5HiO4RFBVtAc7EY6w2mmRg,Vanessa V.,"Côte Saint-Luc, Canada",5 star rating,"I tried indian food a couple of years ago, a restaurant on jena talon road and was very disappointed, from the service to the food, and left saying never again.. but being so in love with indian culture, i went to Atma for my 1year anniversary with my bf. The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere, the decor is beautiful and classy, candlelit tables and romantic vibe and you feel welcome from the beginning. We ordered two cocktails that were deliciousssss! And the food didnt disappoint. We had the dal and veggie soup, the butter chicken and the chicken curry with the simple rice and naan bread. Very kind service and informative. LOVED IT"
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Ordered in through UberEats a two combo dinner for four people a few weeks ago and it was a very pleasant experience! Delicious food, massive portions, and well priced, this meal was one for the books. Amazing paneer, yummy butter chicken, spicy lamb, and a variety of side dishes that we wished we could eat all day. The only negatives I have are that the raita has the consistency of soup which was annoying and that two of the containers were broken upon arrival which led to a huge mess when we were trying to unpack the bags of food. I can't speak to the restaurant itself or the service since this was a delivery but the food is phenomenal so check them out!"
/user_details?userid=1TpPrIGwpUVzjaGjCX4sXw,Mimi K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It's a lovely restaurant to bring a date or some friends! I love the décor and ambiance at Atma! The food is delicious, just a bit pricey, however. It's not really the place to bring a group of loud people since the atmosphere is usually quiet or low sound. Overall, I would recommend!"
/user_details?userid=hYW1WJGWeIpAngHug6eLfQ,A M.,"Halifax, Canada",2 star rating,"Not a good place to order for delivery from.The samosa chatt was soggy.  The daal soup was hardly an actual cupful of liquid, for $6, and bland and watery.  The chana masala and pulau rice were good, but not enough to make me consider them again."
/user_details?userid=nbNSiS7O_6zoO92rZOhKmA,Josie T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been to a few Indian restaurants and this one by far is my favorite one.  We were a group of 7 friends so we decided to take the ""all you can eat tasting menu"" for 35$ and it was delicious. Every dish they brought was better than the previous one. Restaurant itself is nice and the service is great. The waiters are very nice and friendly."
/user_details?userid=h1UcaSPIPpQqMiWf12Csqw,Jill M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,This was my first time here. I have to say the service and the decor were very exceptional.  We sat upstairs on the couches and ordered a bunch of food.  My favorite dish was the shrimp pakora and the lamb Korma. I definitely will be coming back here!
/user_details?userid=ItG02kSPsyJal7ZMaB8pHw,Nicolas A.,"Central, Vancouver, Canada",2 star rating,"I've been ordering from Atma, since I arrived in Montreal and overall the food is pretty good. That said, on the last few times I ordered, the seek kebab were disgusting! Usually they were tasty and tender, but on the last few time they are dry, tasteless and have hard bits in it. Either the chef is on holiday or they are cheapening on the quality."
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Location: On the main, corner Rachel. Street parking is available (metered) but check to see what the restrictions are. I think Mon-Wed the meters stop at 6pm but I'm not sure. If you're using transit, you can take the subway and either get off at St. Laurent (green) or Mont-Royal (orange) and walk over. You can also take the #55 bus up St. Laurent. In my experience, parking during the week is OK if you get there around 5-7pm but of course, no garanties.The place: I got take-out, but the space looked quite nice. Very simple decor, and looked spacious (as in your neighbors aren't sitting in your lap).The goods: I only got the Butter Chicken, which was, in a word, awesome. The chicken was all breast and so tender that I didn't need a knife to cut through it. It literally cut itself. The butter sauce was incredibly flavorful but not too creamy like some other places, where it's super thick. Not too sweet and not too spicy (pretty sure you can modify the heat factor but I forgot to ask). The rice was perfectly cooked - not starchy at all. Service: N/A - I got my order and paid. No issues. Price point: If I recall, the dish was $16. I think it's a little steep for the portion, however personally, I was full by the time I finished. Not to mention that this was the sh*t!I'll definitely return to dine in-house"
/user_details?userid=WuyU014TP6JMn8q55FV4Cg,Hetal G.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Just to let you know I am a vegetarian.Our experience was really bad that's when I decided to give them 1 star. Let's start with the good points (as the list is quite small) 1) The inside ambience was good. That's ALL! Which anyway wasn't even available for us. Now bad points-1) We were unaware that this restaurant requires reservations. So went there walk-in. There were many other groups without reservation too. The owner was adamant that without the reservation, he can only accommodate trespassers side. (Patio) It was chilly and windy, we still said fine as we were hungry.2) The complimentary papadum took a while to arrive.3)  After confirming with the server, we ordered chilli paneer thinking it to be curry as it was a part of Main course. But to my surprise it was made indo-chinese and an appetizer size which doesn't go with Naan bread.4) So with bread we asked if he can get us some spicy curry in Paneer. They had none. So we ended up getting Tarka Dal.5) We requested everything spicy. But it was tasteless and non-spicy. 6) The owner by default charged us 18% TIP with the bill. I would be happy to give that if I was happy with them. He is either the rudest person and doesn't care about feedbacks or extremely racist man. He wasn't even curious to know further when he asked how our experience was and I said it was not so good and just Okay! I guess, no room for improvement. 7) The vegetarian curry portions are too less compared to the price. We were 3 of us and paid 80$ 8) The worst part is when you request for a curry vegetable and you get to know that none of the vegetables has sufficient amount of curry. It's basically just less or no curry. I obviously would not go there back nor recommend my friends."

/user_details?userid=pe0vmr1GOMiVKiBySowX7w,Wai W.,"Waldwick, NJ",5 star rating,"We came here with 11 and we were easily accomodated.  The service was fantastic from when we called to make a reservation and they created a pre-fixed menu for us since we are a larger group.  Looking from the street it looks a like a very small eatery but once you walk through the ""shower curtains"", it is pretty spacious for diners.  It also has a full bar so you can enjoy most drinks to meet your drinking pleasure.The food was very nice, we all enjoyed the pre-fixed set menu.  We had some vegeterians in our large group so they were very accomodating with our pre-fixed menu.  Everyone enjoyed the food, the service and each other's company.  It has a nice booth table set in a corner for a little privacy and think when I return I will see if we can fix maybe 6 of us.  One of the dishes that I remember very well was the samosas which was the bedding for whole garbanzo beans.  The butter chicken was another good dish to try.  We were not too crazy about the ""donuts"" as they were a little too sweet.  This is a place to visit if you enjoy Indian food, you can't go wrong."
/user_details?userid=wQLqTg9_f9KxV4yr_I0JYA,Brian C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Shout it out I must: this is without question the best Indian restaurant in all of Montreal.I have been here many times over the years and always enjoyed this gem of a place. I have been reluctant to write about it because it is a very intimate and sensual place and I mistakenly thought it should always remain a well kept secret; a place that one would only recommend to their close friends.  Especially those who live to dine out.I reached this conclusion having eaten in many Indian restaurants, running the gamut from the curry joints in Parc Ex, and the slew of hole in the wall places that have sprung up on Blvd St Laurent, and some of the more upscale places downtown. Having tried some of best of Indian restaurants in New York, London and Delhi, Atma is surely competive with these. It is world class.Attention to every detail makes Atma superb. The atmosphere is classy as you can be seated in the dining room where the decor is south beach meets south asia; comfortable and sleek. You may also be seated in the upstairs dining room where you will dine on the floor, on comfy pillows and join the very cool crowd in what could be a dinner party a Raja's crib, perhaps.You will be served your dinner on authentic metal Indian tableware and white table cloths. The food is presented in beautiful vessels and pans that really increase the eye appeal of your meal.The menu is extensive with options from most every aspect of the Indian pallete.The curry dishes can be custom spiced so if you wish to take a capsaicin ride go right ahead, but, you can always put on the brakes and have your food spiced timidly.The kitchens of Atma are very authentic and the tandoori ovens turn out exceptional naan of many varieties and wonderfully tender tandoori chicken, kabobs and shrimp. The Korma of lamb, chicken or shrimp is creamy delicious and brings good Karma. The vegetable dishes are formidable we had the light and cheesy saag paneer and an exceptionally complex eggplant curry.  Atma's chefs use the ingredients that are always fresh,not frozen, which is a practice that needs to be adopted by of a lot of the local Indian places, where the offerings are often highly seasoned splat over rice.There is a remarkable variety on the menu so you are not stuck in one region's cuisine and at Atma you can take an extensive tour of Indian cuisine.  It is one of the best dining values around considering all the attention to detail provided by owner, Ravi Anand. He runs a very tight ship and you won't be disappointed.  If you want to make the leap to fine dining, India style, Atma is the place."
/user_details?userid=8DpfYHnRnN2OCE6ZUR_ZkQ,Alyssa P.,"Buffalo, NY",5 star rating,"This was the BEST Indian of my life. Don't walk by this unassuming door without popping in. The first thing we noticed was how beautiful and heavy the plates/cups were, which we interpreted as these owners care about their business, especially the little things - and we were right. To start, we had some lovely complimentary papadum. The Daal soup was perfectly seasoned, along with every other dish. The Butter Chicken had this light, sweet flavor that kept me coming back for more. The lamb in the Saag was unbelievably tender and not a bit gamy. This place is owner-operated and it shows, food and service are on point. I will dream about this food until we make it back to Montreal."

/user_details?userid=76rke7JbAWMDzmbmzzuUpA,Nathan P.,"Orlando, FL",5 star rating,"I knew I was going to love this place when I saw the dome -shaped doorway. This restaurant is sexy, and my wife was there which makes it extra sexy (Give me my brownie points). My wife and I went here for our 5th year anniversary and we absolutely loved this place. I say it's sexy, because thats the best way I can describe the ambiance. The lighting was nicely dim, the background music was smooth indian music, the beautiful ceiling drapings in the bar area and the covered candle made this place very romantic. It was the perfect place for our anniversary.The service was great. The waiter was very attentive. He answered all our questions and even gave us suggestions on what to order. He was very friendly, and he made sure that we were taken care of. Now lets talk about the most important part of going to any restaurant, the food.  When I first got there, I remember seeing someone else order something that was sizzling that got me super excited, so we decided to order the same. So for our appetizer we had the ""Lamb Sheek Kebab ($10)"" and Naan Bread ($4). The Sheek kebab was DIVINE. The spices were perfect. It also came with sizzling veggies with FRESH  coriander.  The Naan bread was really good too.  For the entree, My wife ordered the ""Bhoona"" ($14), which is Curry lamb with fresh onions, tomatoes, garlic, and ginger simmered thick sauce. I ordered the ""Lamb Korma"" ($16) which is boneless leg of lamb marinated and cooked in a cream sauce with nuts, exotice spices and garlic. Both entrees were amazing. The Lamb Korma was my favorite. It was just bursting with flavor. The lamb was perfect and the portion sizes were generous.I can go on and on about how good this place is. I'm very happy we decided to go here for our 5 year anniversary.  The food is great and the prices are reasonable.  Please keep this place open and check this place out. Your tummy will thank me later!"

/user_details?userid=3kou-W33ZEbf__cL_4jGBg,Lisa T.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"I've been here twice now and let me just say, the food is amazing. The 3 stars is based on service only. The first time we were there, there was a younger guy who appeared to be in charge. He was very friendly and while sometimes seemed negligent, we figured he was just trying to do too many things at once. The second time we went, there was an older man in charge and service was terrible. We had to wait 15 minutes just for someone to come to our table. Being a birthday dinner that we wanted to enjoy, we started by ordering an appetizer and drinks. The server (same older man), told us that they were super busy so if we don't order our food now, not to complain about having to wait a long time. I thought that was a rude way to put it, but we took his advice and ordered. Overall it was a good evening and the food was great, but unfortunately the pompous and unpleasant attitude of the man in charge made it impossible to enjoy 100%. We would have loved to have any of the other staff attend us, as they all seemed incredibly friendly and far more competent than the guy in charge."
/user_details?userid=C_kYbN-QYppD1NeL-6T-Pw,Lily F.,"Outremont, Canada",2 star rating,"Considering the Indian options in Parc-Ex, Atma is not my first choice for Indian in Montreal. I came here with two friends last week for a casual dinner. First of all, the ambiance may work for some people but for me it was very off putting- the lighting was so dim I wondered what they were trying to hide. Also, the pillows on the banquette were disgusting. The zebra- printed plush cases don't seem to have been washed in decades. Onto the food- the chana samosa is good and as expected. The Chicken Madras was fine but not the best I've had- could have greatly benefited from a squeeze of lime and some coriander. The palak paneer was decent. However, we requested the food be prepared 'properly spicy' and it really wasn't- it also didn't help that the waiter asked maybe five times if the food was spicy enough. Skip the naan- way overpriced and not great.  While Atma is passable, I would not recommend it given the other dining options in the area. And please, turn up the lights!!!!!!"

/user_details?userid=Z97fPi2LivXGGAvUrMrEoA,P K.,"Brampton, Canada",1 star rating,"Summary:Service - extremely poorFood - goodAmbiance - goodI brought my family to Montreal for the first time and we decided to go to Atma for dinner. We made online reservations for 8 pm for a party of 6 people.  We arrived at the restaurant promptly at 7:55 pm and were told by the owner that it was a busy night and we would have to wait 20 minutes to be seated.  25 minutes passed and I asked the owner/attendant for an update.  He said it would be another 10 minutes.  I advised him that our reservation was for 8 pm and he just told me its a busy night and he can't 'ask people to leave'. We contemplated on going to a different restaurant, but thought 'let's just wait another 10 minutes or so'. By the time we were seated, it was 8:50 pm, and it was 9:05 by the time someone took our order. We ordered appetizers and mains. We noticed that two other tables which were seated after us had already started receiving their food.  At 9:45 I asked the owner why our food is taking long, and just said it's a busy night.  Only when he went to the kitchen area and asked about our appetizers, is when they brought out all the food at once.  So by now it's almost 2 hours since our reservation was made and we are just starting to eat now.  Not only did they bring the food all at once, they also forgot a side which we had ordered.This was by far one of the most unpleasant experiences at a restaurant that I have had.  The owner not once took ownership of the fact that he had taken on more reservations than he could handle.  He also was to occupied socializing with regulars and paying very little attention to other customers.As for feedback for the owner:-Please try to be as honest as possible when advising customers on how long a table will take.-be cognisant of how many reservations you can handle-show compassion and sincerity when an error has been made on your partThough the food was good, the service left a bad taste in my mouth.  At the end of the night, they offered us complimentary dessert, however at that point it was too little too late. My family and I were pretty upset with this being our first dining experience in Montreal.  I would not recommend this place to my friends or family."

/user_details?userid=hq3Q-e-J-80OwL62uDtfDg,Amrendra Y.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Samosa chaat in appetizer is a must try if you love spicy food. Its a combination of chick peas and Samosa. Out of the world taste and really loved it. Highly recommended. Butter chicken in main course was good but i was expecting it to be little more spicy and strong i.e. Authentic punjabi style.  Place lives up to its name. The way seating has been planned is also interesting.

The waiter was very helpful. It's a super chill place, décor is cool... I love it. Minus the dirty martinis. Those were NOT good at all. But hey, you win some, you lose some. The butter chicken was great. I would go back!"

The food was so delicious and our waiter was so hilarious and attentive.It's got an amazing design to it, and manages to feel traditional, indian, but sexy and sophisticated all at the same time.It's got a nice bar at the entrance, and more intimate seating in the back.Our meals were both super delicious and I can't wait to go back. Already recommended it to a friend and she fell in love with it too!"

/user_details?userid=-w7ww3yW5BHE3TFyj3IHuQ,Carolina M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Who knew Indian dining can be sexy?!  One of my favorite Indian restaurants ever. Truly authentic (I've been to India twice). Food is bomb, decor is rad and super trendy. Indian acid jazz beats set the mood. It's a great place for a date as the music is low and lighting is dimmed accented by candles. Also a nice place for groups as they have a nice little private room at the back that sits about 6 people.  Bathrooms are tiny but cool Indian grafitti on the walls make up for it. Id go here every night of the week. Word!"

/user_details?userid=ethqqJiFzvAzG2-pWQ8Pmw,Ben S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,I wanted to really like this place.  The food was good and I would go back for it.  The atmosphere was dark.  A little too dark; we couldnt read the menus.  We were brough minature flashlights to help us out.  Appart from that the decor was quite nice compared to other indian restaurants I have been to.   I would recommend the naan bread; some of the best I have ever had.
/user_details?userid=Vp_C7oIxeztbd2PchNBOHw,D A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Atma is what happens when Indian cuisine and SoBe decor collide - very trendy but not over-the-top. Whoever put this place together deserves a pat on the back. It's cozy but has an exotic flair to it. Shaped like a shotgun, there's a mezzanine at the end. Candles dot the tables and the India-specific decorations are kept to a minimum in an effort to keep the place as relaxed as possible.  An excellent date place, by the way. The service is typically good, and the food is more or less all done right. All the usual staples are there, and there are no weak spots on the menu. The cooks are very competent. Prices are average - whatever a typical Indian restaurant is plus a 30% premium for the decor and ambience, which is probably worth it. A solid 4-stars."
/user_details?userid=ILe3tzgnbGSaZfpArtJdjA,Mike S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is not your typical Indian restaurant. Gone are the red velvet chairs, the bright lights, and the tacky decorations all over the walls that so many of us have come to expect. Atma is the trendiest Indian restaurant I have ever been to. I love the decor. The service is proper. And the food has always been divine.They have a fantastic upper section that can easily accommodate large groups.Atma is an experience. Go!"
/user_details?userid=-9cnvXL_8dmt7XkdSVGayw,Ashley D.,"Vancouver, Canada",2 star rating,"Our food was decent but the service was horrible. Our server was rude, hurried our meal, and gave us a dish we had canceled (and subsequently also charged us for his mistake). We enjoyed our food and had a mediocre bottle of wine, but did not like eating in the pitch black; we probably wouldn't go back based on the poor lighting and poor service."

/user_details?userid=vUetIHOBUrjIrbQgQyFDgg,Jason T.,"Sugar Hill, NH",3 star rating,"The food was very good, the service was quick. I could barely read the menu the lighting was so low or see the food I was eating. The decor was very impressive. We almost walked out upon arrival because the host was giving us a hard time about not making a reservation for 3 on a Sunday night, the place was empty. Also we ordered a salad that never came, I meant to check the bill but forgot. All in all, great food but not so friendly."

/user_details?userid=2LptcvhkcFyNXT_NZDPpaQ,Luca M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been to Atma quite a few times and can definitely say the restaurant is a jewel.First off, it's vertically spacious which reduces the heat and noise levels. Its decor is simple and very discreet, so you can actually focus on your party and your food.The menu caters to all tastes, though I believe the vegetarian part relies too much on dishes with a mushed consistence. I have always had excellent experiences with Atma and will be returning as often as I can.Why not 5 stars?1)  When they are busy, the service and food can be pretty slow. It's obvious, but when the delay becomes noticeable to a reasonable guy it's a bit too long. 2) Our party of 4 once ordered several Madras dishes and they were nowhere close to the spiciness of a Madras. The same dish on other occasions was, instead, enough to make a pepperhead like me sweat. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. For the time being the 5th star is in the works."

/user_details?userid=r7GHYNcXMwCxd5SIHNBsAQ,Valerie G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This restaurant is family owned and the cooking is definitely home cooking.  Beautifully decorated (which is quite unique in Indian restaurants), with rounded white walls, archways and great lighting.  The bar is quite cozy and spacious, but you can also reserve these great separate rooms with cushions and sheers, the second floor is where you will find a great big area which can accommodate up to 10 people at a time, others are for 2-6, you must remove your shoes to access the second floor seating.  The food is really tasty and can accommodate newbies as well as experienced Indian foodies, the mulligatawny is the best we ever had"
