/user_details?userid=cMVRfHHv9A_CMVI5JPWxrA,Liam B.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Actually worth five stars. Cest increible. Was hunting from Peel st a decent spot for a brat and a beer (le sausige) and finally stumbled to a burly, gritty bartender who put on fkn dope music and served me le pies de resistance - a fuckng hotdog with pulled pork. The ambiance is honest to god a real bar. I swear, its an actual bar. Really fun. Cute chicks."
/user_details?userid=o_IEnOVNuir0QNVkANzyXQ,Esteban Y.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The chicken wings were delicious and very meaty. Nachos were crispy with good toppings. The grilled cheese was awesome, it had sausages and braised beef as well. We also ordered a huge Sangria in Aquarium size, it was literally like a fish bowl, so cool, everybody excited took pictures holding the bowl. Good music, great food, cool bar, the server/bartender (it was a monday night) was very cool. We had a great time there having a farewell party for a friend."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",2 star rating,"I saw that they made these cool drinks in giant fish bowls and so my cousins and I wanted to try it. It was honestly the most disappointing trend item I've ever tried. We ordered the vodka and red bull one because the waitress said it's blue and looks really cool, plus we didn't feel like sangria.I'm not a fan of alcohol but even I could tell that what we got was watered down and basically just redbull and ice. Our waitress was also either really drunk or high. She kept bumping into things and each time we talked to her she took a beat before answering. I did order the mac and cheese as well and it was good but they serve it to you with the salad on top and so the dressing runs down and completely ruins the taste of the cheese. Just no."

I really must say though, the drinks and food are absolutely exceptional here.I would honestly pop in, if the crowd is decent, 100% swing in there for the sake of experiencing the vast menu!"
/user_details?userid=4AMVQznMX1Ht8-8mjX5wLA,Marie N.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My favourite bar in mtl!! Discovered this gem at the beginning of the summer through the Quench app and it quickly became my go-to neighbourhood bar. Would definitely recommend their Moscow mules, as well as their nachos. Never seen nachos that are layered so well with tons of cheese and toppings. I even came here one time around 2am because I was starving & the kitchen was closed, but the cook was kind enough to still make the nachos for me! The staff is always super friendly and the music is on point. Whether you go at 7pm or 2am, this bar always has the best vibe!"
/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",4 star rating,"Les torchés is a small cosy bar we ended up visiting because it was confirmed they will show the Habs game. Indeed the game was on on multiple screens and we got a complimentary bottle of beer as token for good luck. I wish that nice touch from the owners worked in Habs favor, but hélas! Back to our time in the pub, it was fun. People kept coming and our table for eight accommodated 13 somehow. So if you want to come with big crowd for drinks the size of Les torchés is not an issue. The noise level will allow for limited communication, but this is to be expected, The list of drinks is not an issue either, lots to choose from. The Bloody Caesar was uneventful. That was well compensated by my bacon bamboo sticks: candied bacon in spicy sauce, so hot that it will help you consume a pint of beer, bot soooo good. The small plates menu is really nice, my friends were happy with the tacos and chicken wings. Considering the amount of bars in the area I'm not sure when I will go back to this bar, but it is on my list for places to have a drink when I'm thirsty...!"
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is couple of minutes of walk from where I live so I've been there few times. The ambiance is welcoming and relaxing, their service is great even during their busy times and the cocktails are delicious. In summer they have a terrace which gets quite popular with locals and tourists especially on warm sunny days. It's definitely a great place to meet up with colleagues or friends for after work drinks. Definitely would recommend it."
/user_details?userid=gPutIn3JgUQyVBLOeilXEA,Louisa K.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",3 star rating,"We were attracted to this place because the music sounded cool, the atmosphere seemed relaxed, and the menu listed unhealty barfood. We ordered beer (pint $7, small glass $4.75) and a platter of nachos ($16) to share. Those nachos, although topped with cheese, coriander, olives, and guac, were a little on the dry side. Even the sour cream and salsa couldn't save it. Longing for something more juicy, we followed it up with mac&cheese ($15). They were topped with a honey dressed salad that went nicely with the truffled cheesy macaroni.Our waiter wasn't the friendliest and could have spared a smile or two.The atmosphere was also not as fun as we had hoped it would be so I probably won't become a regular here."
/user_details?userid=kZkkm0SgOqDed-hN5awN8w,Marie B.,"Gatineau, Canada",5 star rating,"great vibe on Mont-Royal, eclectic clients and plenty of windows to watch the world go by. Did not eat, only drinks - service was very quick and attentive, I will go back."
/user_details?userid=ypedXzY8custxcIwKlnFtA,Laren C.,"Columbus, OH",5 star rating,"We stopped in on a lark, and we were so glad we did!! The bartender was so fun to talk to, and we got cheese and charcuterie boards that were delicious. The chef was happy to come out and explain what was on them, and she went the extra mile in trying to translate some of the items into English (if they could be). Service was prompt, music wasn't too loud for conversation, and the atmosphere felt cozy on a chilly night!"
/user_details?userid=vpldxbdbHIWdtm3CU49bsA,Joe A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,They have a good variety of beers and interesting take on pub grub. The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is very friendly and casual. The staff is great and can make you feel like a regular your first time there!
/user_details?userid=y0MwqMMYGt9lvQQsFVB-ug,Kristin N.,"Plymouth Meeting, PA",4 star rating,"Popped in here on a whim because it looked inviting. I was pleasantly surprised by the menu offerings and everyone was happy with their food. Wings and cheese board were especially good. Beers were tasty and I enjoyed a Sommersby's Cider. Music was great, too."
/user_details?userid=0KZNZKVCTpURutG_qbMKzg,Alejandro A.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,Awesome place for cocktails. Food is great and staff is friendly. Prices are decent. I have become what you would call a regular here for my after work drinks. People here are always fun and friendly and this includes the customers who seem to always be open to meet people and have some shots with you.
/user_details?userid=_OkEXLN_5T9cMc3UFrLT9A,Lily A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,We came here after the party was already going and we now keep this spot in mind if we're looking for an unpretentious night out. We wandered in during a stop between bars and ended up staying longer than expected. Music was great on this Thursday night. Nostalgic pop with some hip-hop and reggae thrown in and your usual top 40 dance hits. Security was actually friendly and the only person not having a good time was the poor drunk birthday girl who lost all her friends (happy 18th!).Can't say much for the food and daytime vibe and we only stuck to reasonably priced beer all night by we had a solid time.
/user_details?userid=1DhKvepHRNKs3aUw6NSOKg,Alice A.,"Fargo, ND",4 star rating,"Tavern looking bar, with a super fun atmosphere. The music is awesome, with tons of hits from the 90's. Mix of all types of music. Laid back place where you can really go hangout with friends without having to dress up, and have a great time. The staff is Ok, definitely not friendly."
/user_details?userid=XILA-PtHX99FNHuMIT6C2g,Sam H.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"This was a really bad experience. At least the food was inexpensive. I had the ""the tailgater"" hotdog, which turned out to be a shrivelled grocery store hotdog slathered in overly sweet pulled pork on an open faced, burnt grocery store hot dog bun (described as ""homemade""). My partner got the tacos, and they were damp, soggy hard shell grocery store taco shells stuffed with weirdly overly sweet ground meat that was cloyingly overseasoned with thyme. It was bad food, and the service didn't help. A table of very sweet elderly ladies sitting near us received almost no attention from the server despite multiple attempts at contact and the staff repeatedly tried to upsell our order. Poor across the board."
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"If you're in the Plateau and looking for somewhere to grab a drink come to Les Torches.  It has a casual, laid back atmosphere and they have great happy hour specials.  Usually happy hour here runs from 4 to 8 and they have a handful of cocktails that are $5.  There is also wine and a special beer for $5 and $6.  If you're not enticed by those there are a variety of beers and other drinks to choose from.  There is a small food menu.  I didn't try it but it is something I'll want to try on future visits.  I would also imagine that this would be a good bar to watch Habs games.  They had several giant TVs in the bar that would be ideal for watching hockey."

The bartenders always make sure you are good and everyone is having a great time! The wings are super hot, but very good!!!!! If you are ever in Montreal stop at this bar!!!"
/user_details?userid=8gEC7Fa3Qwt23cETCmSpEw,Joe A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Very cool bar with a fun, laid back vibe.  I had a group here for my birthday. They reserved a large area for us on a Saturday night, without demanding any sort of group minimum spend (which a number of other bars in the area were asking for). Our server was super attentive and really friendly."
/user_details?userid=eBVFtdxqTGdogezZ98HUsQ,Hamish S.,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",4 star rating,"Very mellow bar, laid back attitude, great tunes, good beer selection, and a very interesting menu. If you're in the area check it out :)"

/user_details?userid=jXeCoHQGW8Z13my-Ky61sw,Jordyn B.,"Las Vegas, NV",5 star rating,Omg the pulled pork grilled cheese is everything!!!! So good!! And the girl bartender was awesome. We came back the next day and she remembered what beers we were drinking from the night before.. best bar food I've ever had.
/user_details?userid=yfAOQVaMB4MvuOc-4UkOqw,Brian H.,"Silver Spring, MD",5 star rating,"Really cool bar that we stumbled upon during our trip to Montreal. It's not in the tourist handbook but should be (then again that might ruin it!). Wooden beam walls feel very Canadian in a good way. Just stylish enough to be cool without being stuffy. Hockey games? Perfect spot. Good looked good but we didn't try it. Oh and $5 Moscow mules, Bloody Caesars and Laurentine Ale from 4-8 on weekdays... Need I say more?"
/user_details?userid=1UwJVPsIiQ1VpzRZhLftSw,Beth K.,"Phoenix, AZ",5 star rating,Favorite bar in Montreal by far. Awesome drinks for great prices and super friendly bartenders. Cute and comfortable.
/user_details?userid=HXVx8dG5KxQZog6kdDraWg,Nicole S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"As the name implies, this is a bar people come to to get drunk. On the Saturday we went, the patrons and the staff were energetic, loud and dancing everywhere-which can either be a fun time or an annoying time depending on what kind of night you want. I got a suburban USA college bar bro vibe. The tavern decor is friendly and warm, prices aren't bad and there's an energetic dj on weekends. I came here with a large party (with a reservation). Our service was all over the place-the kitchen staff were super nice and allowed us to serve a cake. However the server for our section was clearly tanked by 11pm and couldn't keep orders straight, tried to double charge many in our party and left for a smoke break without having someone cover us. As a group of 20 we easily spent 500$+ and would have spent and tipped more if we had better table service. That being said, the rest of the staff were nice and I'd consider returning on a less busy night."
