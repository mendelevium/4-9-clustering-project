/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This little place has quickly become our favourite for good quality halal meat. Inside it is extremely clean with lovely middle-eastern style d√©cor. We have purchased various items from their selection but our favourites have got to be the ground meat (super-duper lean & clean) and the marinated steaks (amazing spicy seasoning). Big chunky pieces of the most juiciest & delicious T-bone cuts at a very reasonable price. If you want a sample, I recommend trying their filet-mignon sandwiches which are extremely tasty and tender. Highly recommend!"

Unfortunately the management of this branch changed a few weeks back and since then, the quality has gone down so terribly! The bread is diffilerent, not enough meat in the filling and becoming less value compared to price. I hope the old management come back!"
/user_details?userid=iqQBsjqOF9xgIAbsZ2sAZA,David M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Brand new and impeccable building as well as an immaculate storefront.They're still a few things to iron out since they just opened (no prices anywhere).It's not the standard shish taouk spot here, they grill to order and while it might take a while it's worth the wait.A confusing aspect is the plate I took did not come with potatoes, rice or salad. Just enough bread and garnishes to make 2 sandwiches. Its still worth it since the meat was truly succulent and unlike anything downtown.My dream is for this place is to become a mini Abu Elias with a delish Kilo Mix.With a nice terrace outside, it has all the ingredients to win"
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Lamb kebab pita - you don't find that option at every Halal grill, but you do here. A little pricey though at 7.99 (rolled up long and thin, with hummus and turnip), especially because a few bites were quite fatty. I'll give them the 4, because it's freshly cooked in front of you, they gave me a nice welcome, they have a good selection of Middle Eastern products, and the highlight of my meal was the excellent tasting date juice. The bottle was somewhat small, but worth the price. I'd give another try, but they should watch the pricing to what you get ratio - especially in an area with budget conscious students, and a fair bit of competition in a similar genre."

/user_details?userid=CFB9glegliFCT7dJxdLNsA,Jawad K.,"Saint-Hubert, Canada",5 star rating,"I had the honor to visit the place on their opening, the place is lovely, very clean and nicely designed (colors, lights fixture etc) For their opening they offered all the food on the menu at a 50% discount rate, they also have a nice outdoore seating area that is very buzzingWe ordered filet mignon, shish taouk sandwiches and all were cooked to the point and soft! Very lean and properly marinated, actually went for seconds :$They had great variety of fresh meat and we purchased minced meat (we havent cooked it yet but it looks very lean and nice textureThe meat and food price is highly competitive, i recommend and will return on a regular business where there will be less traffic in the shop"
/user_details?userid=c7C5QziJbx6JOnQFiOxUXQ,Youri H.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"A shish taouk sandwich here is $6.49. The sandwich platter is $12.99 and comes with a small side salad. Did I seriously just pay $6.50 extra for a side salad?!!The sandwich was good, but the pricing doesn't make sense to me."
/user_details?userid=FTsYsxk0-vsSk4uil1VD5g,Feifei L.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,Had a lovely lunch outside their shop. Chicken skewers grilled on the spot where tender and tasty. I'll be coming back to try the lamb and beef.
/user_details?userid=haeiD9LsM3LHa_8-MjTDsA,Tareq S.,"Denton, TX",5 star rating,"Excellent Syrian barbecue and the taste reminds me of the food overseas. I tried their mixed grill which had a variety of meats in it and different aromatic flavors. They also had hummus, metabal and garlic sauce which tasted amazing with the barbecue."
/user_details?userid=WWek-rqLScuOfPZPxgdfow,Katherine C.,"Edmonton, Canada",4 star rating,I ordered the Shish Taok Sandwich and fries for lunch and it was so delicious and fresh. The ketchup was even given to me fresh. I recommend you try their meats. Everything is prepared fresh! I thought the fries costed ($4.99) too much for the small portion I received? At least they were really good.
