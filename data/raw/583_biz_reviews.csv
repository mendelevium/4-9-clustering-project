/user_details?userid=rkPrz6uwJIefZdH2Oqv4Tg,Christian C.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Scrumptious all day brunch that's also vegan? Yes please! Tried the Benedictine and the omlette so far and I felt satisfied! Much like Kupfert and Kim, the food at Hello 123 takes a healthier approach without missing on flavor one bit. The best part? You don't feel so heavy after a big brunch. Did I mention it's all day?"
/user_details?userid=l9fGOqjEQDEN10Pog3cMng,Xena W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The food here was excellent. I had the Hello Burger (replace onion with mushrooms) which came with potato wedges and a green salad. I'm not sure what their house patty is made of, nor what kind of burger bun they use, but it was so good! The patty was thick and hearty, and the bun was probably buttered and toasted and tasted like brioche.I also had their mocha cheesecake for dessert which was delectable as well. Not too heavy like some vegan nut-based cheesecakes can be. The cake wasn't overly sweet and the coconut flakes sprinkled on top added a nice touch.The portion sizes at this restaurant are quite big, and the prices are reasonable (desserts are a bit pricey though, at 9$ for a slice of cheesecake). I would definitely recommend this restaurant for great vegan food."
/user_details?userid=vTsbejwscDEdA3Ao_aIQMg,Lawrie S.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,One of monkland's newest brunch spots and sister restaurant to Kupfert and Kim in old Montreal although this one is much better. There are a lot of options for brunch depending on what you like ranging from sweet to salty to savoury. They also have smaller portions available and gluten free meals with everything highlighted on the menu to make it a lot easier if you have dietary restrictions. I would recommend the Benny Benny which is their take on eggs Benedict and is very filling. The terrasse is beautiful and you may even get some sun if you go passed noon. Other than that the service is great and friendly but a little slow although I'm sure they will improve with time! Overall get addition to ndg.

/user_details?userid=eg0cwrodeKGLeLIDTSCXoA,Pam S.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"So good! The brunch is so delicious, and the atmosphere is bright and welcoming. The lamps have plant-looking things on them! The whole menu is vegan/plant-based, and very delicious. I had the eggs benedict-like plate, and my companions got the ""massive"" brunch, which was massive but not impossible -- so I recommend going for it if you like the look of everything involved."

/user_details?userid=R1AM8gR-6cFaEaXmehufAA,Trish M.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Seriously the best brunch I've EVER had, plant based or not.  Found this place on our way by and can't believe our luck.  Had the omelette etc that came with ""Irene's Massive Breakfast"".  The best tempeh I've ever had and a brilliantly prepared omelette.  Even the toast had a unique deliciousness.  Insanely good.  Go there now.  If I lived in Montreal I'd definitely be a regular"
/user_details?userid=Q6f-wmLKk6kPIq648ybmbw,Shiran B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Where do I begin? First of all , I am definitely not a vegan lol or even close to it. However my friend suggested that we go there and nonetheless I like trying new places! This place ended up being so not what I expected when you think ""vegan"" ,the vibe & decor is upscale and chill ,the staff? Every restaurant should have staff who are as great as these employees! Very clean place. We ordered two items from their apps and had drinks! We had the messy fries & cauliflower fever or forever ( dont remember) the messy fries were really yummy & the cauliflower was good too I just wish the dressing they put on top wasn't so thick and textured..and make it more smooth? I feel like that would amplify the dish even better.  The drinks were Ahhhh-mazing. They had a really nice choices for wine and a full cocktail bar! It was delicious. I heard they also do brunch! So I'll definitely be going back to try it out! However if you're a vegan THIS place will probably your favorite place to eat at!"
/user_details?userid=m7KVoapY3OwP626uhVXmdA,Amishi W.,"Irvine, CA",5 star rating,Delicious! So many flavors done well together! Highly recommend this spot. Added bonus: one of the only places around with WiFi
/user_details?userid=8p4JGNgZl705fByqyF6BrQ,Monyka T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Alright. So the dinner deserves between 4-5 stars because of the abundance of fresh vegetables and delicious sauces. There isn't a heavy reliance on tofu and just the right amount of grains (compared to other vegan spots) for a delicious and healthy dinner. But, oh man. The breakfast needs a lot of work. It's mostly grains and tofu with very very very little fruits or vegetables. Making Chez Cora look like a healthy alternative (and it really shouldn't be). So the brunch deserves a 2-3 stars only; and it hurts to say so. If they up the fruit and veggies content of their brunch this Monkland Village joint will easily become my #1 vegan spot! Aux Vivre, watch out. The new kids in town are serious"
/user_details?userid=BShhhGOsxY0hQW6jKCs7Uw,Regine D.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"Came across this place while looking for a place to eat lunch. We sat on their terrace. The inside was nice and bright. The wait staff was very attentive and ready to help us choose. The recommendations were excellent. I had the Green Bowl which was full of yummy vegetables on a bed of quinoa and a generous portion of smashed avocado. It's nice that they serve the dressing on the side (I used all of it). My friend had the spicy bowl and also enjoyed it. We started with their messy fries and these are not fries as you might expect, they are potato wedges topped with a mess of ingredients. I would go back just to eat these. For those who like beer with their lunch they have options that I think they brew themselves. I plan to return."
/user_details?userid=Q3McVe0ELWQ5PycOcDcvPA,Stephany L.,"Saint-Lambert, Canada",5 star rating,Beautiful place. Food was absolutely delicious. Took the green bowl with tempeh. The vegan cheesecake was Devine. The texture was not grainy but creamy.
/user_details?userid=LHlKkrkppF-HIV3MOqAKcQ,Margaret M.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Came here for brunch and found it mediocre. I had the ""benny benny"" - two vegan ""eggs benedict"" with a small side salad and a few potato wedges. My friend had the breakfast bowl - tofu scramble, chili, and veggies on brown rice.The pros: The eggs benedict were flavourful and unique. I haven't had anything else similar before. They also have a pretty extensive menu with lots of gluten-free options (including things like waffles and pancakes that are normally hard to find gf). The restaurant is big and has a nice outdoor seating area. The staff were friendly and the food was quick.The cons: While the ""eggs"" were tasty, they're really just a ton of tofu covered in sauce on a bun. I could only eat one, even though I wasn't full, because I felt like I was consuming a whole block of blended tofu. More variety would have been nice, like a larger side salad or some fruit. My friend's breakfast bowl was not good. About half the bowl was (dry) rice and the tofu scramble was tasteless. What really ruined the meal though was that the coffee (which is not included in the brunch) was absolutely awful. It was just filter coffee, sure, but if you're a restaurant that serves breakfast, the coffee should at least be drinkable and not watery. I was on the fence about this place until then, but that kind of sealed the deal. I can't feel good about paying $25 for brunch and then having to go get coffee from a cafe afterward. Finally, the inside of the restaurant is super loud. I would suggest eating outside if at all possible. Tl;dr: Food tastes good but they tend to fill up plates with cheap ingredients like tofu, bread, and rice, while still charging a lot. The coffee is notably horrible. Staff are friendly."
