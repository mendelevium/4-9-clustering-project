The staff are friendly and good workers. During this pandemic, they take proper precautions with their protective personal equipments. They clean your tables between your plate services. Beside their service, their food are delicious. I shared half dozen oysters, roasted eggplants (drizzled with yogurt and sliced almonds) and Mediterranean salad with a gin and tonic cocktail. Each item were beautifully presented and they tasted very good except our Mediterranean salad was super soaked in the oregano salad dressing. It was highly oily and super acidic. Therefore, the restaurant looses a star because of the salad. Overall, it was a fantastic experience to eat there, but the prices were super steep."
/user_details?userid=xwAXryLZ_F0s7LvSBWWp-g,Lance F.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"If this place has 3.5 stars then Le Bernardin in NYC deserves 2.0. And that's 100% five star restaurant. Let me start this by saying I've run steakhouses in NYC for 10 years. Tonight was the best experience I've had in a restaurant in as long as I can remember. From the moment I walked in the door, till we walked out almost 2 hours after closing Steve, the manager absolutely defined hospitality. Our table wasn't ready when we walked in and he apologized. It was 10 minutes before our reservation. In NYC, if you get sat less then 30 minutes after your rez time, consider yourself lucky. To make up for the wait, Steve bought us a round of drinks. It was totally unnecessary, but greatfully appreciated. The entire crew was amazing but hats off to Enrique for taking the best care of us. The food was on par with the top steakhouses in NYC.  For dinner, we did the 40 oz Entrecote that was so tender and juicy with the mushrooms and mashed potatoes. Kicker was a monstrous birthday platter with sparklers. Thank you Grinder for an amazing birthday... Lance F."

The meat is quite something, you've gotta try their Tomahawk steak, or really any of their beefs. Mouth watering and perfectly grilled. Go there with a group of friends, share a table and order some food to share all together. The ambiance is great on summer nights after work and the weekends. Perfect spot for a date night, business meal or friends night out. Strongly recommend this place! You won't regret!"

Point deductions for food and service... dundundunI can't see myself coming back to a place that has more meh dishes than good dishes. On top of that service is inattentive. Maybe this 1 server was really miserable this day because her face looked like she's one of those people who attempt a smile but it didn't come out as a smile and rolled her eyes as she walked away. (I'm sorry you have to take an order?) She also had on these running shoes and very dry frizzled hair. Either way your problems shouldn't be my problem I got enough problems you know what I mean... Took forever to get someone's attention, my friend gave up and went inside to find someone anyone to pay the bill. Even if the food was 3.5/5 the service brought it down and everything wasn't as enjoyable as it could be. My pictures will look better than it tasted enjoy~"

We had a group of 8 out for dinner on a Thursday night and it was hopping! While the scene in Montreal usually is during the evening, it was more than I had expected for a Thursday night! Parking on your own that night was barely possible so all of us ended up valet-ing our car. We got a set of oysters for the table which were great (along with a few other appetizers). I got the beef tartare for my main meal and found it to be too much! We also got two desserts on the house! How fun! I wanted to finish it so badly but I couldn't. Service was fine. Decor and ambiance very fun and chic. Price reasonable for here as this is more of an upscale restaurant. Would recommend and would return."

Not only that, the food is amazing. We had the tartare to share to start (definitely recommend), drinks and the plate below that included meat + 2 sides. The staff is also extremely kind, patient and very welcoming. It's one of my favourite places in Montreal for sure!"
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"we made reservations for saturday night dinner at Grinder and were seated immediately. The staff was friendly and welcoming , the overall customer service experience we had here was great! The restaurant itself is very beautiful , great place for a romantic dimly lit dinner in a lovely atmosphere. It is lively but not too loud which is nice, you can still easily hold a conversation. There is a ton of seating room yet you are not stuck to other tables so there is still some privacy.  Their prices are a touch n the pricey side (although not outrageous), but definitely not a place to go weekly for dinner if you dont want to break the bank. We had oysters to start (they were nice and big & extremely fresh, I was very happy with them , my only regret is that I didnt order more them ! they also were reasonable on price). Then we shared the Tomawk Rib steak for 2 (it comes with 2 sides, we chose Rapini and french fries) , The steak was great , perfectly cooked and spiced and very filling ! The french fries were perfect :) The rapini however, wasnt so great , not much flavor.  I also had a cocktail ( I cant remember the name but it definitely had Tequila in it ! I wish I could remember what it was called because it was great - generous on the tequila and also really well balanced flavors- not too sweet). I would recommend this place for a nice dinner when you want to spend a little and spoil yourself , really nice vibe , good food and friendly professional staff !"

My side was fried Brussels sprouts also with chipotle Caesar sauce. delicious"

/user_details?userid=yI2FRwN5XC_ywo2MOVDpnA,Molly C.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"We stopped by Grinder for dinner on a Saturday night. Luckily, we were looking for an early meal around 5:30 pm; any later and I don't think they would have been able to accommodate us without a reservation (so definitely make a reservation!). We loved our experience from start to finish. The food was delicious and the ambiance was unique. Our waiter was clearly busy serving several parties / tables, but we liked that we didn't feel rushed or pushed out. We are out-of-towners who were just visiting Montreal and we are so lucky to have stumbled upon this gem. I've already recommended it to several people, and we will be back."
/user_details?userid=qG4nHoPuh9VGi30vODpkiw,Shirley J.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"They are recklessly disregarding their community, their city, and their patrons. I went here last week, and should never have sat down, but unfortunately, I had to. Tables were not 6ft apart, no one was 6ft apart. It looked like it did on a regular Saturday night pre-pandemic. 85% of the employees in that restaurant had their face shields on in a way that did not cover their mouths, or their noses for that matter. Our waiter took his face shield off as we were paying. I am really sorry that I supported this business and used to speak highly of this establishment, but they have lost my respect."
/user_details?userid=5xxI2JMKSyPNCLpXOgPaig,Chad V.,"Saratoga Springs, NY",5 star rating,"The scene here is phenomenal even on a Monday. A hot crowd sipping cocktails and wine while eating finely crafted cuts of ages beef and tartars. All while backed by energetic beats and an eclectic vibe. The food and cocktails were of outstanding quality and the menu was condensed and red meat focused, but had something for fish and veggie lovers alike. It's a must return to restaurant next time I'm in Montreal."

There is a table d'hôte menu that has as appetizer salad, soup. The main course is either burgers, ribs or salmon. The decor is really rustic and chic. Awesome and massive wine selection for anyone willing to try something different. I'd definitely recommend anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner to come here."

/user_details?userid=65yB0ydGXOZ_-T6J_GbKfw,Lambert P.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"One of my best friends had organized her own birthday to be held in Grinder in a special private room on the second floor near the back of the facility.  It's a completely separate room which used to be an apartment that the restaurant just bought out and added it to their own.  It had about 6 large tables and could seat upwards of 40+ people if necessary but this party was going to be smaller than that. The party was going to be on the Saturday but we were able to come in on Friday evening and set up the place with all the decorations and set up the tables the way we wanted.  I have to say the staff here was very accommodating and helpful which included the valet at the front to the individuals who allowed us access to the room and showed us the set up etc.We had a menu to choose from for this special event being held in the back and considering this place has their own boucherie (butcher shop) right across the street it's safe to say the quality of meats as well as other dishes served here would be as fresh as could be.  In addition to the variety of starters which were being served the choices for the menu consisted of a variety of meats  with fish choices as well.  For starters we had had the beef tataki which was served with cashews and bacon while my wife had the candied salmon which were perfect as tasters.  For our mains we had the skirt steak and tuna steak.  While this was a still a private function the chef which was looking after the party had a very good variety of choices and the quality of the dishes were great.  I enjoyed both desserts as well, one which was sort of a chocolate lava and the other was sort of a caramel crumble."

/user_details?userid=_muhtS8ZFnV61s7Q4JXDwQ,Kevin M.,"Princeton, NJ",4 star rating,"The name of this place definitely through me off when I was told about it. I definitely though it was some kind of male strip club, but it definitely wasn't. lol.Grinder is a trendy and upbeat restaurant in Montreal. It has more of a loungey vibe and the crowd seems like that is more so what they are there for. A few birthday groups and overall larger groups were seated throughout. There is a huge bar in addition to the tables throughout the restaurant, so I grabbed a seat at the bar. I had an order of their salad that came with pecans, apples, goat cheese and maple dressing and it was delicious. Surprisingly one of the more delicious salads I've ever had. I also had an order of their short ribs and sweet potato fries, which were very good.The bartenders were friendly and they have a very good spirit selection. Between the overall trendy vibe here, good food and good drinks, Grinder is definitely an awesome spot to check out if you're looking to have an overall good time in the city."
/user_details?userid=raqTx1Tj-wTMs25mcDPMxQ,Monica M.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",5 star rating,Loved this place! Ambiance is fun & young. Very big restaurant with cool decor. Dining at the bar was a great experience. You see the bartender and oyster guy work their magic. Food was good as well with nice portions. Both the beef tartare and tuna tatakiWere delish. I took the 1/2 lobster as the main meal. Well seasoned and served with a nice butter dip. Hubby took lamb shank which he loved as well. Will go there for lunch too! Enjoy!
/user_details?userid=X2Q_m5MWCgta24oj_z1b7Q,Thomas M.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"The meat was delicious, but the waitress ruined the whole experience.We were a group of 14 celebrating a birthday. Our reservation was at 6:30pm and we ordered relatively quickly, but the food was only served to us at 8:25pm, almost 2 hours after we sat down. The waitress then asked us to ""eat efficiently"" because another group was coming in at 9pm.""Yeah, that's not gonna happen.""We objected, clearly it was the restaurant's fault to have taken so much time to serve our food. The waitress insisted but after a while she said they would try to find a solution. In the end they let us finish our meal, diving on the table to remove dish after dish as soon as the last bite had been taken, but the spell was broken and neither of us 14 ever want to come back here. There are a lot of quality steak houses in Montreal, why go to the one where you are yourself treated like meat?"

The little details in the experience were awesome like: the staff taking our coats, floor manager coming around to top off our wine, and of course, THE FOOD. Great portions, high quality and awesome taste.Very impressed. Will definitely be back!Recommendation: if you get a chance, check out Grinders butchery just a few stores down that supplies all the meat. It'll help you appreciate the food you're eating just a bit more :)We got the 40oz Porterhouse steak for 2 and my friends got the 40oz Rib Steak for 2. They came with 2 sides each as a combo."
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I went to grinder at 9pm on a Friday night with my girlfriends. We had to wait a bit even though we made reservations. We ordered wine at the bar. I like that it's open and that fresh air comes in. We shared two bottles of white wine. I ordered the duck tartare. It was really good and it came with fries which were also really good. I tried my colleagues salmon tartare but honestly I preferred the duck. We ordered a side of mashed potatoes and we dipped our fries in it. Omg You gotta try it! The mashed potatoes were so creamy and cheesy. It was fingerlicking good! We did a couple of shots with the waiter and got a free dessert. The shots had coffee in it. It went down smooth. The dessert was pudding chomeur. It was delicious! I left there feeling satisfied and not overly full so it was perfect.The food was good. The ambiance was good. What's not to like?!  I would definitely come back!
/user_details?userid=yRB4UrgnLs3BxbVM1QQ0Gw,Sababa S.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,10/10 for ambiance and music. I had their beef short ribs which was great. Pickled onions makes this dish  interesting. I also chose a side of mushrooms which was also good but i would recommend the mashed potatoes. Dont miss out on their mashed potatoes!
/user_details?userid=t1HdYXIzIuooNDXC09iiBA,June Bug ..,"Gilbert, AZ",4 star rating,"Such a great place to enjoy some good food with great friends! This new restaurant serves modern cuisine as well as classic French dishes with a nice twist! Such a nice environment when you walk in, it has a nice rustic yet home-y touch to it. We got a couple of orders from the appetizers to share amongst each other, as well as two entrees. For our shareable foods we chose the calamari, the French onion soup, and the garganelli penne pasta. The calamari tasted normal, nothing that fancy about it but it was still good! The penne pasta serving was quite small, it was still delicious but I feel like it could have been more saucier. The French onion soup was amazing! With the toasted bread in there as well, it gives it a perfect texture with the tasty broth-like soup and the melted cheese!!!For our entrees, I chose the fried Cornish hen and my wife got the beef short ribs. To be honest, the Cornish hen was alright, and it was more like a rotisserie chicken and ""fried"". I wasn't expecting that. Still juicy and flavorful but nothing spectacular. The beef short ribs were pretty good, very tender, maybe a little bit salty. All in all, I'll have to come back here to try some more dishes but I still loved the atmosphere of this place. I also really enjoyed the service here!"

They have a nice setting, a cozy inner terrasse for the summer. We shared the famous Tomahawk rib steak, it's good, however the Burger 1855 is delicious!!!On the other side, service was really slow; food took some time, bills took an eternity, we had to order it several times!!! In addition we asked for bread and butter, they brought us 2 small buns for a big table of 12.Finally the waiter was a bit pushy, he wanted us to order the soonest!!"

Before I walked in the very nice 2019 ice sculpture already there. Then I walked in and the atmosphere was so nice. The waitress was very professional. We order steak and chicken. It was amazing good. So if the place is nice and the service is good and the food is amazing then yes I can give it a 5 stars!!!

The food was pretty good, we ordered the surf n' turf (lobster, shrimp, scallop and 40oz tomahawk steak to share) which was alright, but the meat was bland. The burger was pretty decent though, and the cocktails were amazing. Hip crowd, perfect for dinner before a night out. Definitely a place to try if you haven't yet."

The place is vibrant and trendy. The staff is cool. For appetizers we ordered : Calamari with a marinara sauce, kind of bleh, I wouldn't recommend it. The salmon tartare was descent but nothing out of ordinary. We also had sweet potato fries with a good mayo sauce. For the main dishes, I got the halibout, it was blend nothing exciting. My friends got beef short ribs with espresso sauce, and lamb shack, again it wasn't the best meat you could have. There was a lot of it. Make sure you are hungry.We had pudding chômeur with ice cream and a Sunday, they were both pretty good but that just sent us into a food coma and a sugar high. Not the best feeling when you try to get your dancing on"

We got it, eat now get out. I understand that they wanted to clear the table for the next crowd but a bit more tact would be helpful . Like - would you like to finish up your evening with a drink at our bar.  Wow! Rude after a crowd spends over 1000.00 I would expect a bit more.  They are the latest and greatest but suggest they need to decide whether they want to be the fine dining experience they put forward or a fast food joint.  Classy restaurants work around their customers not the other way around or at least communicate.  That was my second round there and will never go back again."

Completely disappointed. I was offered a replacement but everyone was done so we declined the replacement. No apologies and no sincere regret. Wow Grinder 0 on 10 on customer care. I don't are the bill was waived I didn't come for a free meal. Epic fail on the tomahawk. The dessert was excellent and busboys were top notch.
/user_details?userid=e30nkqMd2leReeIllmQdfw,Ella C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Wine list: very extensive. Set up: well done. Food quality: 3.5/5 service rating:3/5 (our waitress came two time.take order and ask if we need anything. Rest of the time I had to grab her and it was even crowded that night)I ordered tomahawk, fried calamari and few drinks. Fried calamari was okay. The down side is that it's too dry on some squid. Few cocktails, I couldn't even taste the alcohol. For tomahawk for two, my partner and I left very full and couldn't finish. We had a lot of fat to remove so it was disappointing. Size wise I think about average two scoops of ice cream of fat I had to remove. I tried tomahawk other places and never removed that much of fat before. That's why food rating is 3.5. I really enjoyed the set up and ppl there are very hip. One thing I didn't like about the staff is... they push you to order drinks. I witnessed few times the waiters and waitresses tell the customers this alcohol pairs great with your appetizer and continue to push even after the customer said no alcohol tonight. (I personally hate those waiters and waitresses. But can't blame, I'm sure the restaurant are pushing them) overall, I like this place but won't be going as my go-to place as it's too loud and many other great places to go in mtl. For tourists, I don't recommend bc it's far from the main tour sites and the food choices aren't unique. It's typical food you can find any steak house. And def no kids should come."

Oysters were fresh and delicious, tuna tartare was also fresh -- a good classic. We split the 4 person surf and turf, when delivered to the table my jaw dropped. The steak was cooked to perfection - medium - and melted in your mouth. The lobster, shrimp and scallops were also delicious.

The French onion soup is delicious and not heavy at all. The filet does require any sauce as the filet seasoning and juices are more than enough. The sides that come with the meal are enough for two.

Sexy crowd if you're into that scene and the layout is well setup for the all important sight lines.The gal at the bar was friendly, laid back and really professional (plus the patience of a saint when it came to helping out the solo guy next to me who wanted her thoughts on every wine on the list.)

Popped in here after perusing their butcher shop that's located just a block away and decided we needed to try something. Had the burger and couple glasses of wine...it was one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life: Canada AA rated American beef, cooked to perfection with amazing texture and construction. Staff very friendly and hospitable (minus the host, he was actually quite rude when we walked in at 5:30...the place was empty but he considered not seating us due to the incoming evening reservations - eventually he let us sit at the bar but said, ""you need to be gone by 7:30""). Very cool space as well.Highly recommend this place for locals and anyone passing through."

A/C is blasted to its maximum, you feel like you are in Alaska. Music is so loud you cant even hear your friends next to you. Food is over priced for its quality, 3 times so far i felt sick after their filet mignon. Cocktails are 70% ice. I guess all you are paying for is their rent, the ""ambience"" (grinder is a place for a hook up, you have bunch of guys in suits and girls almost naked looking for fun) . Honestly, a place to avoid if you want quality experience"
/user_details?userid=OSPuQh94fH2jT1S6bZ6Q8A,Emily B.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Grinder is really the type of restaurant that can divide a room--as illustrated by previous reviews, people seem to love it or hate it. I personally love the hustle and bustle of Grinder; this place is ALWAYS happening and the crowd is always beautiful. The interior is beautiful--especially the living wall on the open air side of the restaurant. Poor service is a common complaint about Grinder but after two visits I don't have anything particularly bad to say about the service--it was not exceptional but definitely satisfactory. It is definitely possible to eat at Grinder and keep the bill fairly reasonable, but it is also very easy to let it get out of hand. On my first visit I had the appetizer duck tartar (quite big) with a side of mashed potatoes and a side of mushrooms; this was more than enough portion-wise and I thoroughly enjoyed each dish. On my second visit I shared with a friend; we split the beef short rib and raw scallops. The scallop plate was so small I found it to be bad value for money, but the beef short rib was amazing--I would order it again in a heartbeat. We finished off the meal with the soft-serve ice cream sundae--very good and very big (split if you can)."

It was more on the rare side but I couldn't care less because I love it rare. Just make sure to order it medium if you want it medium rare because it was very VERY pink Inside ordering it medium rare. The mashed potatoes were good and served very hot. Mushrooms were nothing special. Portions are very small and I found it overall pricey. I guess you can say your paying for the location and environment. The food overall...

So they did. I was first to arrive and said I was there for a reservation under the two names that could have made the reservation. The fact that I mentioned 2 names got me an eye roll from the bearded guy at the door (who at a minimum I would guess is a Manager / GM). I attempted to clarify by stating the time....blank look....until I was asked ""for how many?""  I said ""4 or 5"" as I was not sure what the final numbers were because I was not with my team when they made the reservation. The response back was....""Well how am I supposed to know which reservation is yours?Anyways - I got seated. From then on the rest of the evening was great. Our waiter was very pleasant and helpful, the cocktails were reasonable (I am a bit of a snob on that area), the wine list was very good and the steaks, tartares, and carpaccios were excellent. As the evening went on, the music started to get a little louder and more people were around the bar, so it had a great fun atmosphere, very lively.  Next time I will come a bit later and grab a spot with friends at the bar and I'm sure the rating will improve."

/user_details?userid=-OwkM7YDnPbwGxiKd7rptw,Jeff G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I'm quite surprised Grinder only has 3 stars. Sure, the restaurant is a mix of hipster and business-casual, it's located in the hottest new area of Montreal, and the prices are a little higher than they should be. That's been the gossip about this restaurant for as long as it's been around, which is why I had never actively chosen to go there. Well, last week, a buddy of mine was in town and wanted to go to Grinder with a bunch of friends to catch up. It wouldn't have been my first choice, but figured I'd take the opportunity to see what all the fuss was about. At the table, people ordered burgers, lamb chops, salads, and a bunch of stuff from the raw bar. There were no negative comments from anyone. The burgers were thick and juicy, the fries were crispy and salted just right, the lamb chops were cooked to a perfect medium rare, the salads were fresh, and the drinks paired nicely.The kicker... the raw bar! My fiancée and I decided to go for an all raw dinner. We started with the beef tartare and shared the salmon and tuna tartares as the mains. Aside from being platted beautifully and being absolutely delicious, the three tartares had completely different flavors. It was really nice to see that some great creativity had gone into the prep. The portions were nice, making the entire meal a worthwhile expense. Our buddy broke some news that he received a promotion, so we arranged for the waiter to bring him a dessert. Not only did he bring a delicious pouding chomeur, but he also brought a round of hot shots for the 12 of us at the table... all on the house. To top it off, although I was full, the brownie on the dessert menu was calling my name. Unfortunately, it was bone dry and terribly disappointing. The waiter noticed we hadn't eaten it and, without hesitation, offered another dessert saying we wouldn't be charged for either. The service had been great all night, but these were small gestures that went a long way. (The brownie was replaced with a carrot cake that was delectable... definitely go for that one!)All in all, I'm really happy my buddy suggested we go there. I'll be back and I recommend you go too!"
/user_details?userid=69AqMB6P3sI5v2IK_I376A,Mark S.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I went here with a friend a couple of weeks back and overall nothing spectacular. Good: the atmosphere was pleasant, being that the place was filled with young professionals that were well dressed, the place was properly designed, the staff had great energy, etc. The drinks were well mixed but a little expensive. Due to the upbeat energy, I would pay a premium on the drinks. Great place for a 5 à 7. However: Bad. The overpriced food was far from the greatest. I had calamari and the sauce was, without  exaggerating, ketchup. The well portion tartar was flavourful however the side I salad was very basic and boring. The salad was prepared as if the cook was in a rush and was late for work. Conclusion: The place would be better if it was just a bar that served food but their liquor permit would restrict them to do so. I would only go back if I was dragged there for a birthday/office/other party. Would not go back on my own free will. If this was a purely a bar, I would absolutely go back to enjoy its great energy."

I ordered the Duck Tartare, followed by the Beef Short Ribs all while washing them down with my go to drink - Old Fashions.

Nice balance between the fresh salmon, coriander , citrus and green onion it was fantastic!I had the Burger and potatoes aligot, and my gf had the New York strip and the potatoes aligot. Let me just say the potatoes were incredible... The right balance of cream, cheddar, chive... Amazing. My hamburger was also very good. The meat was cooked nicely and the condiments on the burger were slightly elevated... Honestly for a burger it was great! My gf raved about her steak. She said it was better then a Moishes steak. It was tender and well seasoned accompanied by a ratatouille, pepper sauce au jus and bone marrow.All in all it was a pleasant experience. Would definitely come back!"

I came here as part of a large group for a friends birthday, and a few members of the party were vegetarians, so they ordered salads and side salads. Due to alcohol permits (or lack thereof) the restaurant complained to our party that we did not order enough food. Furthermore, those who did order the salads received romaine lettuce that was browning and not fresh at all. The management was accommodating and replaced the brown salads with sautéed seasonal vegetables but frankly, this dish too was not very appetizing. Lastly, and this is real the ""nail"" quite literally in the coffin, my friend who ordered a tartar as a main bit into a small little screw which she was then told was from the pepper mill.

Advice was volunteered by the waiting staff and very rich. The person who took care of us did his best to make everyone feel comfortable and succeeded. He certainly gave this restaurant a better image. The food was rich. Perhaps a little uneven however. The tartare was delicious and the squid was a little salty. I didn't have a main course but the wine selection was good and there are reasonably priced choices. The ambiance is loud and happy, especially on weekends. Perhaps not the best place for a quiet date (maybe visit on a Monday or Tuesday for that).

My sister and wife invited me out to dinner to lift my spirits and told me Grinder was supposed to be very tasty.It's in Griffintown on Notre Dame, beautiful place with a decor that stimulates an aesthetic eye. It was very busy, pretty people, attentive, smiling staff. We were seated outside and our waitress quickly came over to say hello.The table next to us was being served and everything looked delicious, always a good sign.The menu had all sorts of tasty, appealing choices, now I'm always an indecisive type and was trying to narrow it down between the tandoori halibut served with a tabouli couscous with cherry tomatoes and the lamb with eggplant and salsa verde.All dishes come with your choice of sides, fries and mayo, heavenly mashed potatoes with cream and sharp cheddar and some green veggies.I decided on the lamb rump with salsa verde and the mashed potatoes, my sister had the tandoori halibut and her other half had the steak with chimchuri.We decided to get some sangria to start and to toast the passing if my little furry beauty...There were 2 different kinds of sangria, we chose the one with rose wine, spiced rum, cassis, mint and mixed berries.Our sangria quickly arrived, it was more of a cocktail then a sangria, first taste, bitter and very alcoholic taste. I like my sangria light and fruity tasting. This one was all cassis flavor.  Our waitress brought us some 7up to tone it down but we didn't end up drinking it.Our meals soon arrived, my lamb was tender and good but the highlights were definitely the halibut tandoori and chimchuri beef.Both were flavorful and perfectly cooked. My mashed potatoes were creamy, cheesy and decadent. The fries crispy and delicious so was the homemade mayo.Our waitress was sweet and took our drinks off the bill without us asking.All in all, I would come back.

I have to say the inside was amazing; trendy, clean, really cool light fixtures, interesting decor and open kitchen. We sat at the bar and our bartender was less than enthusiastic. Granted, we had a slight language barrier as our French is not perfect, but still, the bartenders could have at least smiled--after all, a smile is universal! It's like the staff thought they were the cool kids from high school and we should be appreciative they even let us come into their restaurant! Very weird...We tried the calamari and a side of mashed potatoes. The food was okay. The calamari had a really nice flavor, but the potatoes were below average. We had two beers, one glass of wine, calamari, and potatoes and the bill was over 50 dollars! Though the location is great and the ambiance is appealing; we will not be returning.

/user_details?userid=1Bljt-GngRP4XxkQFLnHHQ,Rod M.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Wow, that was disappointing! The owners of this new resto made a major investment in the decor and they did a great job as the restaurant has a wonderful and unique decor. Exposed beams, shinny stainless vents, beautiful wood floors and highlights of glass and copper. Unfortunately the service is not on par with the care and precision that went into the design and construction. The Maitre d' and our waiter's demeanour can best be described as surely and I immediately felt unwelcome. We were seated toward the rear of the restaurant near the  kitchen and seemed to be directly in line with some sort of cooling fan that cast a chill on our entire evening. We were a group of 3 and ordered the Salmon Tartare, Beef Short Ribs & the Bavette. The Bavette was the clear winner. The food was good, but not mind blowing in any way. Throughout the entire evening we felt as if were causing some sort of inconvenience to our waiter who was extremely unattentive. In addition to being generally unfriendly the service we received was not on par with this level of restaurant. The bread was very slow to arrive at our table, 2 people at our table were served their plates and then we waited about 5 minutes for the 3rd dish to arrive. For my friend who ordered the Bavette the waiter did not think to bring her a steak knife so she was stuck trying to cut through it with a butter knife. When we completed our dinner we sat around for an extended period of time and no one asked us if we would like the check. After I flagged someone down the bill arrived quickly and then we were left sitting with my credit card on the table for another 15 minutes without anyone coming by to process our payment. Again I had to flag down one of the staff. Not once did someone say 'sorry for the delay' or apologize in any manner. The restaurant was reasonably busy, but well staffed so I can't blame any of the above on a shortage of staff or excessive stress on the staff. Our overall experience at Grinder was poor. Never did we feel that our presence in the restaurant was appreciated in any manner. There are a large number of terrific restaurants in Montreal where you can spend your money and thoroughly enjoy yourself so I would recommend spending your evening somewhere else."

We had come for my mom's birthday; she wanted to take the whole family here because she usually comes for lunch and said it was one of her favourite restaurants in the city. I could already tell when they were seating us that we were pegged as people who don't matter since a family of four didn't match their ""scene."" The food took nearly an hour and a half to get to our table and when we asked why, the waiter fed us some excuse that the kitchen didn't have enough room on the grills for our food. I would assume that a restaurant of that size would have enough room on a grill for more than one meal at a time. Most likely, if they had to choose which table got their food first between us and a ""hipper"" table, they would go with the latter. Already frustrated, we ate quickly, skipped dessert and asked for the bill. It took us another twenty minutes to pay. You would think after the experience, they would take our credit card as soon as possible. The waiter's answer for that one was that it wasn't his job...Finally, on a side note, valet parking involves getting us our car: not greedily taking our money and pointing us in the direction of the car parked down the road.It's too bad that my mom's favourite restaurant is one she will not be returning to anymore."

The waiter blatantly ignored me the entire meal, only asking my friend how she thought the food was and intentionally ignoring me. This restaurant embodies pretentiousness, and since I didn't order alcohol or meat, I was made to feel like I wasn't meant to be there. The server even thought I wasn't going to pay, which was beyond insulting. I own a condo a block away and was so offended I felt the need to write this point. The food is alright but the service was pathetic. Will bring this up to a manager should I ever be forced to eat there again."

Starting cocktails were delicious and the wine list is great, reasonably priced. We had delicious oysters to start! I had the beef tartare - awesome. My friend had the burger which he said was one of the best he's had... and the cheesy mashed potatoes are to die for!! Highlight though was the dessert.. their homemade soft serve ice cream with caramel and chocolate drizzle - wow! I love soft serve and this was incredible! Will definitely go back, super atmosphere!"

The mashed potatoes are also insane! Yes it's pricey, yes it's loud but the food is so good. My husband and I sat alone and enjoyed every minute!"
/user_details?userid=CFQ4o5PfKp_gFMQ4HDkb0Q,Alex C.,"Chicago, IL",1 star rating,What an arrogant place! Ew! They are empty and yet would give you the shi...iest table! They tell you to leave if you passed 2 hr limit regardless you're still waiting for deserts. They would literally take your plates with food and rush you to finish the dinner. Btw you can't have drinks if you don't eat. Montreal is full of much better options than this crap!

Food came out so wrong and the girls bathroom was flooding and the staff did nothing about it. Also, we made a reso and the table wasn't ready til an hour after. Not impressed at all! I love Montreal, but his was a disappointment."
/user_details?userid=JqGyAK1ZcEtcNV1dOPK4Ow,Amara G.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"Hi everyone, Grinder is a fairly new restaurant and usually is quite busy and delivers on a good time however it is APALLING to me that a restaurant in Montreal in this day and age, regardless if they are a steak house or not, has 1 measly green salad as a vegetarian option!! By not offering any decent vegetarian options, you are limiting your market significantly..if only 1 person in a party is vegetarian, Grinder automatically is not an option. Don't let how busy you are now go to your head, in Montreal you are cool one day and completely irrelvant the next. Food for thought."

As a recommendation from our hotel, we choose here to dine on our last evening; on the whole Montreal has been beyond amazing - this restaurant minus our server was fantastic. Time to change staff."
/user_details?userid=gQ8mvIM4PCFepn1wn5YC1A,L M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Ambience and the food are great. The concept of valet parking in Montreal seemed a bit odd, given the location and often ease of finding parking nearby BUT still appreciated. Our waiter was very cordial and pleasant. The food was top notch. The place was a bit loud, and slightly over priced. However, I wouldn't rule it out for celebrations."
/user_details?userid=_91FxFZYTaUGVIEnQhB5cw,Alex C.,"Las Vegas, NV",2 star rating,"Service was adequate. Shrimp appetizer was amazing. Bread was awful, just like something they pulled from the bag. Halibut was soggy, avoid. Atmosphere was amazing. I may give it another try for the burgers but overall a mediocre experience."
/user_details?userid=3CoKirgKy131Efos7iAVjw,Lana J.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Trendy, charming & delicious... Grinder is the new hot spot in Montreal. We sat on the garden terrace on a warm summer night, and I was transported... With its European feel, I was surrounded by gorgeously lit trees and beautiful people. My hanger steak was perfectly cooked and topped with a Chimichurri sauce...unique! My fries were thin and perfectly crispy. This place is perfect for groups, or a hot date, or just for a drink and people watching. The music was perfect. After a couple of chilled white wines, you're not sure you want to leave..."
/user_details?userid=jrV3hEXXYstsjyrYDB2eWg,Ptra S.,"Mono, Canada",1 star rating,"After arriving at the nicely decorated and boisterous room I was asked what I wanted to drink. I picked regular water and received a small glass of lukewarm water no ice though I noticed bottled water was nicely chilled. Hmm not a good sign but I persevered. Had a rather dreary and greasy burger which I could not finish, then paid the $25 tab vowing never to return. A very discouraging experience."
/user_details?userid=a3gKHarQcY61pZ9B6Ob5fg,Tanya G.,"Nashville, TN",2 star rating,Meh. It's meh. This place is next to my house and is very hit and miss. The highlight of the evening was the oysters (thanks to Dan Notkin!) and the great reasonable wine selection. The disappointment was my main. The halibut was watery and tasteless despite being 'tandoori' and my scallop dish was bathed in what tasted like Italian dressing. BLECH! Stick to the oysters and wine and you won't go wrong.
/user_details?userid=p5jKmkAERGrlteVbxuICxA,Laura L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Will not be going back..The decor of this restaurant is quite trendy. I love the heavy wood furnishings and the 3 tier awning type windows but despise those gargantuan operation room lights above every table (with a moniker like Grinder it feels like I'm in for a Sweeney Todd episode). The center looks nice and overall the restaurant gives me a feel like it might be a hot spot for drinks. Upon entering we were greeted by 3 different people which was a red flag from the start. The menus the were given to us are covered with thick plastic on both sides and is pretty heavy (hate it).  We did not receive our bread and butter like most other tables while waiting on our service.First appetizer we ordered was the tuna tataki which was quite disappointing. The slices of tuna were very thin compared to what I've had at Ferreira's or Mikasa for example. The garnish did not  bring out the flavor of the tuna at all and bizarrely tasted of tomato salsa. It was just not what I expected or up to par with what I've had before.Second appetizer we ordered was the beer flavored French onion soup. The flavor was okay and lacked some nice chunks of bread but it was not as comforting as a traditional French onion soup. For a kickass French onion soup made with love I'd say try Bistro Duo D down the street. Finally, my 'main' was the large portion of salmon tartare that lacked the lime, cilantro, and avocado that was noted on the menu. The salmon was grinded (for shame!) and it appeared as if it was the fattiest slab of salmon that they used. It was awful and definitely no culinary adoration was put into this dish. I was hoping with meticulously diced chunks of salmon with the freshness of avocado and cilantro but alas it was forgotten amongst other things. My husband ordered the short ribs but was given the skirt steak. Surprisingly, it turned out pretty good and so were the fries that came with it, however it wasn't the order that was placed.This restaurant has so much potential given the location and trendy decor. I see it being very busy during the summertime given that the windows open up and the have a good sound system going on. They might have something promising if they improve their dishes, service, and possibly change up the menu a bit but until then I believe it will struggle once the honeymoon phase is over with the hipster crowd."

Nice wine list with a good selection of roses.  We had a burger, fries, salad and tuna which was very good, but the couple next to us shared the bone in ribeye........looks like that's the meal to get!"

/user_details?userid=fHJZqB2zFk0E-1LKLo26vg,Sara D.,"Phoenix, AZ",2 star rating,"I recently came to this restaurant after hearing so much about how great it was from many friends. We came on a Sunday evening for an early dinner. The drinks were great and the food was phenomenal. My only complaint is there were no highchairs and we were with our 1 year old daughter. Now, I get that this is a ""hip"" restaurant but having 1-2 simple highchairs is pretty basic for any restaurant. When I asked for a highchair the Manager told me they didn't have any because ""they aren't a family restaurant & don't caterer to that clientele""...honestly, I just think that is lame because just because my husband & I have a child, we still go to all the same restaurants with our baby and this is the 1st place we have ever run into this issue. On top of that, after I sat down I glanced around the restaurant and noticed 2 other tables of couples with kids. So they might not ""caterer"" to families, but their customers consist of families and the least they could do is have a few high chairs. In the same vein, they should add a baby changing table in the bathrooms. These are really easy fixes and I hope the management makes these improvements!"
/user_details?userid=U01NvkeKgPNH8TlmQRY9-Q,Doug F.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Ok, so this is the third time I have been here and each time I wonder what all the fuss is about. Obviously a very trendy place but the food does not rise to the level of the atmosphere. We were three for dinner on a Friday night, valet parking is much needed and appreciated. Started with drinks, wine served right away but my beer took well into the appetizers before arriving, changing tanks they said. We all had salads which were good, not great. I had the short ribs and my wife and daughter both had the salmon. The short ribs had zero taste. Salmon was reported to be good. The vegetable side was mostly mushrooms, again little or no taste, other sides were ok, sweet potato fries were the best of the sides. Didn't have desert. And oh by the way, toilet in men's room is broken, such a turn off when restrooms are dirty. The service is kinda weird, they have a different person for everything, water, bread, order, food delivery, table cleanup...all different people. Other than the waitress who took our order, everyone else seemed ticked off having to be at work on a nice Friday evening. Too much money for a mediocre dinner out. Won't be back."
/user_details?userid=HKFf8BBItspemjNBU1Kurw,Elana P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I have been to Grinder before just for drinks but last night was the first time I ate there. Nice cocktail menu. The Pimm's Royale was really nice. My friends ordered the oysters to start with and they said they were fresh and delicious. The staff was reasonably knowledgable and helpful with any questions we had regarding the wine, cocktails and the food. I ordered the burger not expecting it to be anything wonderful but to my surprise it really was delicious! You get a nice number of options for the side dish. I had the seasonal vegetables. It was a nice mix of kale, cauliflower, cheese, pecans and almonds. Really nice dish to accompany my very nice burger topped with cheese and bacon. For dessert I ordered the cheescake with a mango topping in a raspberry coolis. It wasn't exactly a NY style dense cheescake. Was more like a mousse but still really good and after a burger, probably a lot better than a heavy cheesecake. All in all I thought the food was better and more satisfying than most of these ""cool"" Montreal hotspots and I'm looking forward to returning."
/user_details?userid=9-TV_gHUZheMNKkMR4hQyA,Sam O.,"Oakville, Canada",5 star rating,"That is probably the only steak house in Montreal that combines top quality with a vibrant ambiance. although it's not aged neither it's Wagu , but the ribeye was fantastic, it came exactly medium rare as ordered crispy from the surface and jussy from inside, it melts under the tong without compromising on the wonderful honest flavor of the meat , i don't think they marinade their steaks and they shouldn't, it's a culinary crime to mask such a great quality meat with other flavored no matter what they are, you can order whatever you fact with your meat on the side and they aren't short of options ,after the dinner we went to the bar for some digestive shuts , coming from someone who travels the world for dining and wining , these bar tenders are something else ,kindness is easy to learn but these guys are so genuine and true gentlemen , I can right a whole page about how happy they made us feelbut this types of reviews meant to be brief , well done , all stars"
