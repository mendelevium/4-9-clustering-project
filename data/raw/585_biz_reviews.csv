I watched how packed the place was all summer long, from the bike lane that passes beside their front door. I finally had the chance to try it out in October, because there was actually a place for me to sit down!First of all: POPCORN SHRIMP. I ate a small basket, and then I ate the big basket. I was full but I couldn't stop. This place gets a huge thumbs up for having a kitchen open till 2am, because there's nothing worse than hanging out and having a good time somewhere and BAM, you get hungry but the kitchen's already closed. No worries here, in that regard, so we can all relax.The bar staff are really FAB. They take time to stop, look you in the eye, make thoughtful recommendations for wine choices, and let you sip a little o' this and a little o' that, if you're trying to make up your mind. Supah classy.What I really enjoy about this place, though, is the mixed crowd. All kinds of age groups, singles and couples, groups of ladies, groups of office mates, young lovahs, old flames, and every other type. I feel like I can be myself. Nobody's pretending. A genuine good time."

I asked for a wine recommendation and the waiter was useful. I tried the octopus, but it was unfortunately overcooked."

Enjoyed the slower vibe and older crowd compared to the other more lively bars on the plateau. Drinks were beautiful and well made. They have a club downstairs which was fun and played Miami style/Latin dance music, which was a nice surprise."

We decided to sit on the pateo since it was such a beautiful day too bad the tables are made out of metal and it was just too hot for our liking. We decided to bring our drinks and our beautiful selves inside lolol. The bartender was so sweet and genuine. It was his first day and was super nervous to get the drinks perfectly right to our likings. The drinks were great and They are very well reputable for the fine selection of wines and other alcoholic beverages. We ordered a crême brûlée as well and devoured the delicious bowl full of temptation.We definitely recommend this place to have a drink and enjoy a wonderful time with friends or co-workers. Service was amazing super quick and attentive both the bartender and waitress were super friendly and happy to serve us. The food was 5stars!! Top notch! Super happy with our experience and will definitely be back on another occasion.Thank you for this afternoon a big thumbs up!!!!
/user_details?userid=7hElQBiE_x2HZk6yJMVgNg,Lu Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Nice place to gather around for a drink the atmosphere is quiet people from the neighbourhood is here on the week like many weekday pubs on the plateau. Not the noisy type of place. The crowd is a bit older for some reason lots of baby boomers, don't except young people like at Buvette Chez Simone. It is lacking something maybe better music and people watching. I can't say for the beer because I don't drink any but it looks like they have a wide selection of local beers. As for the food because I'm here to rate the food: nothing special, not much people ordered any food, they have a pear salad not bad with a nice balsamic dressing, I also had their potato wedges, grilled octopus and the charcuteries platter. If your looking for a quiet night and talk with some friends during the weeknight this is the place.Have dinner somewhere else after 1-2 beer max here."
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I really enjoyed the charcuterie board. It came with different types of meats such as duck and salami it was a regal tasting party. The creme brulee was really good as well. Place is very nice and the service was on-point. I'd go back.Price-tag is a bit high but that's what you get when you go to wine bar.

L'endroit était relativement vide ce qui est relativement normal. Malgré tout il y avait pas mal de monde pour s'occuper de nous. Le service était vraiment rapide de ce fait.J'ai trouvé le lieu sympa et assez grand pour de grosse soirées donc à refaire.

I was walking in the area on Sat. night with 2 friends looking for a pub, since all the ones were crowded we went inside this place. It was full but still not packed and had a cool atmosphere. The music in the back was super fun (I felt like they downloaded my playlist), the wine selection is superb and I just dont have anything bad to write about this place...I MUST revisit it :)"

If you are looking for a place late at night for a drink with a friend or on a date .  I would recommend this place. The ambiance is very comfy and nice. The music is not that loud so we could actually talk. They also have a huge selection of wines. They have some original cocktails as well.

I make it a point to try calamari from different restaurants, and this place is hands up top tier. Ambience, food, drinks, prices, and best of all the customer service is beyond great. I love this place."

/user_details?userid=ZISNvek0336SEF3C-QeA8g,Joey M.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,This is a nice spot with both indoor and outdoor seating (in the summer obviously). The wine was good but what surprised me was the tasty food. Delicate tasty finger food.
