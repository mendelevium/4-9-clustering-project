/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"Les Anges Gourmet is a Portuguese bakery with some excellent baked goods. My mom and I wandered into this bakery and picked up a few pastries to snack on. Initially I just bought us a Tigelada to share ($3.75 taxes in), but then my mom also got a mini pastel de nata, another mini tart, and a canele ($5.65 total taxes in, she's not sure of the individual prices). Everything was delicious.So I had never had a Tigelada before, and I would describe it as a baked egg custard-cake hybrid. It was fluffy, creamy, and springy. The texture was very cool, like a sweet frittata almost. I really enjoyed it. It was a little bit bigger than the palm of my hand. The mini pastel de nata was tiny, literally one bite, and since I shared it with my mom, it was like half a bite, lol. The egg custard was sweet and creamy and the pastry was nice and flaky. We probably should have gotten a regular sized one, haha. The canele was delicious too. The inside was super moist and the outside had a nice caramel flavour. It was bigger than some canele that I've seen, but still pretty small. I still don't know what the mystery mini tart was. It was sweet and a bit nutty. Maybe an almond tart? Again, I just had half a bite, so it was kind of hard to tell, lol.  Staff were very pleasant. The bakery has some seats and it also serves breakfast and sandwiches.I would drop in again if I was in The Plateau."
/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Stopped by this hidden gem located on boul. St-laurent to try out their Portuguese pastel de natas and absolutely loved them! This Portuguese bakery definately lived up to its expectations of having the best pastel de natas in the city. The bakery itself is small but they do have a few tables which could definitely sit 12 to 14 people for anyone wanting to stop in and eat there. The bakery has regular sized natas as well mini ones. They also have plenty of other desserts and sandwiches available. The natas were absolutely delicious....crispy outside tart and yummy custard filling!  Their crispy tart is what makes these tarts stand out as well as their flavorful custard filling!  Definately worth the trip and would recommend to try out!

/user_details?userid=bj2_KPCKpQdNlN8hlHSxdg,Cat D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This bakery is a haven in an area of overpriced goods. Very reasonable and tasty breads, pastries, etc. Their assortment of mini natas, white bean, and walnut bites are really lovely; flaky dough and just the right amount of filling. They also have super cheap $5.50 sandwiches, and a whole counter of extra fillings to add at no additional cost (olives, veggies, sauces etc). Sandwiches range from grilled chicken to tuna, deli meats etc. You can add side salads too at an extra cost. Day old goods can be bought by the bag near the cash at discounted rates and they always seem to have daily $1 baguette. The baguette is firmer and less dense than my absolute favorite, but it's definitely a good buy nonetheless! You can also stop by for a cappucino or other beverage and enjoy the lovely service from the ladies who work there. If you want traditional and tasty goods, I recommend bypassing all the hipster bakeries selling $7 loaves and hightail it to les Anges!"
/user_details?userid=fjaXGzSLOPitIMyCBmnjFg,Bailey W.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,We are from New York and we went hunting for the best Portuguese egg tarts in Montreal and we found them here at Les Agnes Gourmets. The crust was flaky and crunchy and the custard was not overly sweet. Definitely recommend.
/user_details?userid=ljG1d-PF5xtKYvrMGd8Iaw,Amal M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Montreal has a lot of Portuguese bakeries, but unfortunately too many of them tend to be mediocre. Les Anges Gourmets is a local, if understated treasure and although the interior is not dazzling (looks unchanged since the 80's), get ready for a surprise, because the food, breads and pastries are nothing short of outstanding. STELLAR country bread, broas (Portuguese corn bread) and natas, in addition of Portuguese delicacies, fresh paninis- they also make, on request, that celebrated Portuguese dessert called the Molotoff. I find they really know how to make perfect bread and they also have very good biscoitos (Portuguese tea cookies). Another great thing about this place is the very friendly service and chef-food critic Phillipe Mollé (from le Devoir) himself praised the nata tarts of chef-owner José Luis. All in all, a sweet place for fresh, excellent food and coffee, especially in a neighborhood packed with too many trendy places. Highly recommended!"
