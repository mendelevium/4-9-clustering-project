Last time we had a fun board game meet up. I ordered a chai latte probably with the lowest price I've ever seen. I liked it. The decor is very average but it is spacious. If you want to play their games, it's 3$ per person. Good for students."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"I think this place is great! It's half internet cafe half board game cafe! I do wonder why as it is so close to Randolph's but it doesn't have an entry fee and it isn't nearly as busy, at least on the Sunday evening I went. They do close at 8pm on Sundays which is much earlier than Randolph's (1am). They also don't have game masters to explain the rules but maybe you will prefer that!I went in hoping to write some reviews before I met up with my friend, it was 6:30pm. Got the cold hot chocolate drink with oat milk and it was nice and was only $3.15. I would definitely go back with some friends to play some games! Perfect if you're a smaller group, want to choose your own game, a big group that wants to reserve/prefer a smaller venue."
/user_details?userid=olLL4rSOwJcYn--fGisiFA,Johnny Y.,"Fresh Meadows, NY",4 star rating,Came here with some friends to grab a quick coffee only to find out that there's a small community of board game players! That was a first for me! Which was pretty cool. I'm sure we have something of similarity in NYC but never really look into it. The environment definitely gave a cozy feel and will definitely come back with friends to get some board games in!

They have a good selection of games, last time we played Coup and Codenames but they have so much more to offer that we haven't went through yet. They divided the board games by difficulty level, which is nice for a noob like me. Service is very friendly too. The food is super reasonably priced. With cappuccino, a cookie and a brownie, it all came out to be ~$6 with tax. You can't get that deal elsewhere! Compared to other brand name and hipster cafes, this place feels like home. Will come back! I'll actually be going back tonight :)"

/user_details?userid=69O4xGwGDfipWVD_1bgvBg,K + V S.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"We were visiting the area and wanted something to do besides just sitting in a bar. With limited theatre shows, we were lucky to find recreation. We went on Friday night, when the game master is staffed. The game master provided game recommendations, and taught us the rules. There is a $7 fee/person to play games on Friday nights (when the game master is staffed). This fee includes a drink, so we enjoyed a latte and a tea. We played for hours and had a lot of fun."
