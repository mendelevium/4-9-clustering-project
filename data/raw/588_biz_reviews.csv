I took my mom here for a brunch date and she loved everything. Also, it goes without saying but I'll do it anyway, this is a very instagramable place."
/user_details?userid=g1MPo8zaOKLo9QazpThPJQ,Wei T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Very cute , pinky little cafe, located at almost the end of st-Laurent street. Easily miss it Went there last week. During the afternoon, it's quiet crowed. They also have brunch menu during weekend, which I haven't tasted it.  It's a very photogenic place. However the coffee, the cakes tasted average, not outstanding."
/user_details?userid=eQ-ukSPHXYvUhYR_wysd8A,Lily F.,"Brookline, MA",5 star rating,"Probably the definition of an ""instagram café."" The interior is so colorful and just darn cute. Got a chai latte with alternative milk, which was good and fairly priced. You can also get some lunch items that include vegan options."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,"What an amazing cafe! Not only is it super cute but their avocado toast is by far the best I've ever eaten. It's a perfect spot to relax, maybe get some work done (if you manage to get a table, it's a small space), or have a nice chat with friends. It was the perfect setting for the mini photoshoot I had with my friend for her book instagram! New favourite spot!"
/user_details?userid=Nq6e5N8bjgD9B46O4va_zA,Sarah S.,"Vaughan, Canada",5 star rating,"You can see why everyone comes here to take photos. Everyone digs the '80s meets millennial pink aesthetic. I haven't had any food from here but I can say that the drinks are good. The beet latte was pretty good surprisingly! They even sell assorted merch here, like oat milk, mugs, various artisanal coffees and even bags and wallets!"
/user_details?userid=qHhIOpSB9q2E6JmWbzV0BA,Christa Lei S.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"They were very kind to us during their temporary power outage. I was surprised that they were even still open due to the neighbourhood's power being out! While they were unable to make some drinks due to the lack of electricity, they were able to pour an iced chai latte for me, and they were also able to give us some pastries. The decor is very millennial pink and instagrammable. I would like to come here again to try their other drinks and food (menu is in French only, i believe.) The staff was extremely sweet, worth the visit. The boutiqhe has a very limited selection though-- mostly offered as ""decor."""

Affogato, espresso, coffee cocktails, name it! Simply in love with Pastel Rita!"
/user_details?userid=s1sh0bYgI2fxVzsTOJ2qmw,Bex X.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Incredible location - so glad I got to visit this on my trip. The interior is absolutely gorgeous, and I love that they also function as a concept shop (they have accessories and bags from local designers available for sale as well). The coffee is superb, the food is even better. They have a small menu, but everything was great. The service was fantastic and on warmer days the windows open completely so you can look out onto the street and enjoy your time people watching. Would definitely come back again and recommend this to all my friends."
/user_details?userid=wWHeaOS28fnCnFN1Pmo3xg,Shaan A.,"Thornhill, Vaughan, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a cute little cafe in Mile End. I've never ventured this far out of downtown before, but I literally went all this way just for the cafe. Located on St. Laurent is the cafe and boutique Pastel Rita. It has a really nice aesthetic to it - millennial pink with accents of forest green - literally any instagrammers dream. The cafe is quite small though, so when I came on a weekday evening I wasn't able to get a banquet seating. Nonetheless, plenty of instagrammable spots all over the cafe. I ordered an iced matcha latte and a lemon square (which apparently is the best-selling baked good there). The matcha tasted pretty good I have to say - smooth and refreshing. And the lemon square was very delicious. This place is quite pricey though - 2 items for $10...food quality, service and ambience were really nice though. In all, I'd definitely come back if I was in the area."
/user_details?userid=DD4KCmjAdJiJfv6yJcb4Uw,Virginia L.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Definitely one of my favorite spots in the mile-end. The soft pink walls and forest green paint detailing gives the cafe a girly yet odd Miami Vice feel. This cafe is study friendly. However, some might be distracted by their AMAZING choice of music for their playlist. The last time I was there , people, including me, couldn't help signing along with Etta James (i.e. sharing an ""at last"" moment). Coffee is on point, food is vegetarian and vegan friendly and this place swaps coffee for wine later in the day."
/user_details?userid=GlEhxPlaofxOOvcf-5guvw,Cindy D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I love cafes and I love creativity even more so when I heard about this amazing concept I had to take the time to visit. Located in the heart of the Mile-End, Pastel Rita is not only a Third Wave bright little café, it is also a creative space for local designers (hi Bouquet!). I arrived around 9, and it already had a group of people brainstorming and enjoying coffees. I ordered a Moka and a croissant, both were very well done... I stayed a while and looked at the trendy work around (I will definitely go back to get a few items). In short, I enjoyed everything about my experience, from the welcoming Dalmatians (yep, you'll see) to the decor (the fixtures are on point), I'll go back for sure!"
/user_details?userid=voFxNdzhG-cDrW_9NzFGbw,Denzil D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great coffee shop and more. It serves cocktails in the evening and brunch on the weekends. The place has amazing style and the staff is friendly and welcoming. It is so mile-end, but without the attitude of mile-end. I strongly suggest you try it. So far, the brunch and coffee are regulars for us. Enjoy!"
/user_details?userid=7jdjcNBbcpNKFlHRduZIxA,Sophia L.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Overall: definitely worth visiting, especially during warmer months. SERVICE: We went ridiculously early in the morning like 10am and were the only ones there. The lady was nice to us and tried to explain their menu to us. Explain because there was NO ENGLISH ANYWHERE. I know MTL is a french-dominate city, but I really expected some sort of a translation...Still, she tried to help us, but I could tell her English vocab was limited so my bf and I just chose what we thought would be good... and ordered 2 drinks. ***NOTE*** Their drink menu is NOT with their food menu. You can find their full drink menu on their tables. I wish she had pointed that out because I would've loved to have tried their Matcha Latte that others recommend so highly...When we went, the bar where we ordered at was also the only place for the lady to make the food. We could see our food being prepared freshly, which made the experience great, despite the lack of English. The food would also come out one by one, so our food was never cold. FOOD: Even though we could not read an ounce of the menu, the avocado toast I had was AMAZING. One of the best one's I've had, and they really did not skimp on the avocado at all. It was 1 giant slide of bread cut into halves, which sounds like it might not be enough but it totally was. We also ordered a croissant which we also recommend, that definitely helped us be more full after our meal. My bf ordered the Egg Mess. It is an odd dish that she never explained to us in her limited English so I thought it was going to be some sort of egg omelet but I was so wrong. It was a poached egg on some sort of a creamy pudding with bread sticks. To me it tasted like celery and I wasn't a big fan, but my bf actually enjoyed it more than he thought he would. So if you are adventurous in your food, give it a go. If not, do what I did and stick with the avocado toast ;) You can't go wrong with it! DECOR/SEATING: Let's be real, one of the bigger appeals of this space is the decor and all the color. It does not disappoint. It added some nice vibes to an otherwise dreary day when we went. I will say though, that the nice vibes only extends to 3 4-seater tables which is head to toe in pink. The bar is a nice forest green. And then the rest of the ""seats"" uses a knife display as a table. So if you want a good seat, definitely go early!!OVERALL: Recommend! Food was good, latte delicious, vibes were positive, and in a good area. Worth visiting at least once :) (Use UBER to get there.. it's kinda far from DT MTL.)"
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"I love this new café in the neighbourhood, filling in a spot that helps unite Mile End and Mile Ex and gives a big bright, friendly, inspiring option for delicious hangs. Named after the owner's Grandma it was always already going to speak to my heart, and then the warmth of the welcome and the delicious homemade snacks made with ingredients from local producers pushed me to full swoon. I loved my little local honey bar and tasty coffee, and watching the artisans who share the space shaping hats and cutting leather made me feel inspired. Can't wait to come back and spend some time and soak in the maker vibes."
/user_details?userid=4LUG6dffnqgGxE6HxJ0wOw,Tammy M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Made Here.New to the hood cafe with consciously sourced, mostly locally, product. Fresh muffins and croissants. Soup. Barista coffee, tea, hot coco. Beautiful bright space., (was La Castiglione's space) shared with a sister biz; ""bouquet"", three artisans; a milliner, a leather purse maker and a jeweller. Great ambient music. Great vibes. Check it."
/user_details?userid=Bhe156ZrEhZrr6KL1d_IdA,Nathalie L.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Very cute cafe in the Mile end! Very original and comfy place. Went in the afternoon and we got the last table available. Definitely would recommend to try out and to go in the morning!
/user_details?userid=q8ttnTVqWgU2jpW-1kb8cw,Sari W.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"This place is awesome and quaint. It's a small coffee bar inside an artist collective. There is art, jewelry and a hat maker along with an exceptional espresso menu and local pastries from the bakery down the street. The best part is they also have a parking lot, so you don't have to look for street parking.Sebastian is awesome! Great barista and conversationalist."
/user_details?userid=J0ZEA-chzgEnedIXBpbNZQ,Diane D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Such a sunny, beautiful café with good vibes all around. Lots to see, with three artisans' workshops making great use of the natural light. Comfy window seats for working on your own projects. Oh, and the coffee is top-notch, third-wave goodness."
