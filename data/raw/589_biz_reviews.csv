McArthur sandwich was delicious schnitzel sandwich on challah with spicy tangy sauce.  Wow! It was a symphony of flavours in my mouth! Amazing!Also shared some potato latkas and a matza ball soup.  Comfort food but updated to the 2020's with fresh ingredients and a nice presentation.The place was slam packed when we went but we got a table in 5 minutes. I don't suggest going as a group.  The place is small with small tables.  Perfect if you are 2 ppl. Maybe 4.  When it's warm out, they have a small terrasse with umbrellas which looks lovely, but again SMALL.Can't wait to go back! Damn you Covid!!"

Top picks: the Moroccan toast, grand slam, and shakshoka (always a no brainer). The pancakes are really interesting since made with cottage cheese - delicious but could not eat an entire plate alone!"
/user_details?userid=KFsbACIHXQxyff_W6CN1LA,Karen H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Nothing better than comfort food on a windy stormy day. A friend asked me If I wanted to go for brunch and I said why not. She wanted their pancakes and I was hungry after a cardio workout. Lol. It's a small cozy quick kinda eatery. Always aline-up because it's small. They told us 30 min but next door is a great coffee and pastry shop which they recommend you to go and wait. They notify you on your phone when your seats are ready. Genius! We split on the cottage cheese pancakes with syrup oozing all over. The best! I ordered the Scramble which was so creamy, with kale, avocado , salsa and cheese served with Russian black bread. It is definitely worth the wait no matter what you choose to eat. Service is great, food is fantastic and tummy is happy. Will be back..."
/user_details?userid=1J8LYd5Cs4UFRMwgdx2HVg,Alexandra S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A M B I A N C EWe've been here 3 times in the past month! So this place is pretty small, making the line outside HUGE at times. We came here once before and were unable to eat because we hate lines! The first time we arrived the hostess was vaping her JUUL and our waitress admitted she was a bit tipsy at Sunday morning brunch. But I guess that is the vibe on Sunday morning! We stopped by on a Friday and a Thursday during the work week and the crowd was definitely different. Service definitely isn't their strong suit, but oh man the food is AMAZING. C L E A N L I N E S SThe place is small but clean. Tables are close together but it's not uncomfortable. O V E R A L L   Q U A L I T YThe food is AMAZING! The eggs and salami are my favorite! The Morrocan Toast is apparently good (pine nuts in the description so I didn't want to take a chance #nutallergy). The Avo Toast is also super yummy, but it's a small portion. I suggest you try the pancakes called Syrniki on the menu, you can get a half portion to complement your meal and share with the table. They are so yummy. The first time I tasted the mimosa it was delicious, just a hint of orange juice (for color, as I like to say ) the second time I tried it they put more OJ . The coffee is okay, it's not great but it does alright!C O S TCost can do go up pretty quickly as coffee is not included and you should try a mimosa!W A I T   T I M E SDepending on when you arrive, expect to wait at least a half hour! The order to food time is long as well. But they're pretty quick at coming to see you to get your order! Once they serve you the food, they pretty much forget about you!P A R K I N GThere is street parking, but it's better to walk or bike. There are Bixi stations in the park, but it's a little walk away! We actually had to look for them!L O C A T I O NPerfect location in Saint Henri!S T A R SI would give them a 5 star for the food! But because of the long lines and wait times and not great service they lost one star. Still a great spot for Instagramable food pictures!"
/user_details?userid=Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Yes. Yes. Yes. Loved it and am so happy that we tried it! Be prepared to wait in line a little bit but we found the quality of the food and service to be worth it. I loved their pancakes and my companion really enjoyed his first exposure to Jewish-style food. The pancakes were made with cottage cheese which added moisture and flavor. Amazing!!! The Latke Smorgasbord opened my bf's eyes to a new experience (and he keeps telling people how good it was)! I would be there all the time if I lived closer...but I will be back soon and I look forward to trying all the dishes over time.
/user_details?userid=xldzk9U-sILprbCsB8w9HA,Jess M.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Came here around 11am on a Saturday and it was packed! I was told a table for 3 would be a 45 minute wait which ended up being over an hour wait. From when we got there to when we left, the place never got any less busy. Not sure why the wait was so long because from when we sat down and left, it was less than 1 hour. Their brunch menu goes from 9:00am to 4:00pm and since it's not always offered, I ordered the Shah Special ($14.00) which is a side of mixed salad and a latke, topped with avo, smoked salmon, poached egg , sour cream, and caviar. Tbh, I thought it was pretty small. Really it was just a latke with toppings and a side salad. Didn't think anything tasted amazing either but it wasn't bad. Actually, the latke was pretty good, hot, crispy, delicious, but small. The bartender highly recommended the Latke Smorgasbord ($15.50) and the Summer Chopped Salad ($16.00) with a scoop of Chicken Salad ($4.50) and so we ordered both. The Latke Smorgasbord comes with soft scrambled eggs, salmon gravlax, salad, challah bread and of course, latke (still good). Eggs were a bit salty but if you make a sandwich with everything, it's good. Challah bread was warm, soft and drool worthy (I love bread). Definitely made me regret not getting the Challah French Toast as well. The salad, while decent and filling, wasn't anything special. It was highly recommended that we add the chicken salad if we choose that salad which is chicken mixed with hummus. I thought it was okay. Didn't understand why it was a must get.I didn't think the dishes as a whole were amazing and the Shah Special was definitely underwhelming, but there are certain things in the dishes that were really good like the latke and challah bread. I wouldn't mind coming again to try their pancakes since I'm noticing a lot of people in the reviews are recommending it. Also appreciate how their offerings are different from the typical brunch places. While skimming the reviews, I noticed quite a few of them had problems with the service but I didn't. When I arrived, I let one of the waitresses behind the counter that I was looking to put my name on the waitlist and she told me the hostess will help with that. She wasn't being super nice and friendly but she wasn't rude either. No issues with the hostess either. We were seated at the bar so the bartender served us and he was really pleasant. Gave us recommendations when we asked and when he found out we weren't huge fans of the chicken salad, gave us each a small shot of some juice mixed with bourbon (I forgot what it was), which was nice. Food came really quickly."
/user_details?userid=8qu5Zyurap002eIj1kLdOg,Joana Z.,"Saint-Lambert, Canada",5 star rating,"After seeing a lot of hype for Arthur's on Instagram and especially for their brunch menu, I decided to give it a try on a hot summer day in July. My friend and I sat on the outside little terrasse. Despite it being very crowded, the whole vibe and décor of it were just incredible. The plants on the side, the plates, the tables and the chairs give it a very unique look.We arrived there around 10:30 AM on a Thursday and the place was already packed, but we didn't wait too long, maybe 10 minutes. They don't take reservations so make sure you arrive before.We started with iced coffee which was absolutely delicious, they add almond milk and sugar to it and it tasted heavenly. Then, we split the cottage cheese pancakes, and believe me, they were probably the best pancakes I've ever had in my life. Very spongy, with maple syrup all over, but so creamy especially with the cottage cheese, they were perfect.On the side, I had the scramble plate and it was also absolutely delicious. Never thought scrambled eggs could be reinvented like that. My friend had the cream cheese bagel and she really enjoyed it as well.I would definitely recommend Arthur's for a brunch with friends."
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I am not a big brunch person, but this place is definitely one of my favourite brunch spots! Very cool vibe, great service and most importantly delicious food. In the past, I have had their avocado toast and Moroccan toast which were both delicious but there's a something quite unique about the Moroccan toast. I would strongly suggest it as it is a definite 5* in terms of the ingredients, presentation and taste. Do expect to wait in line on weekends, it's a popular spot."
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",2 star rating,"In a nutshell, I experienced bewilderingly shitty service and after an unnaturally long wait, yummy food. Doesn't make up for the service so I won't be back.It was a Wednesday afternoon at 1pm. She told us the wait would be less than 30 mins and took my phone number so that it would text me when they were ready for us. We went across the street to Campanelli's and ordered lattes to kill time.30 mins later, I still hadn't gotten a text so we went back to the restaurant to see if somehow there was a glitch and they had forgotten us. The worst part is we saw them getting ready to seat a couple who had arrived after us. I tried to get the hostess' attention but she kept ignoring us. I told a waitress who said she'd let the hostess know, who continued to ignore us.FINALLY she comes to see us and in a snooty, guilty way said ""you've only waited 26mins which is ok coz it's under 30 mins""... by now it was 40mins. I showed her the time stamp of when they had texted me and then went on to say ""ok well sometimes the system glitches"" in a rude tone... just none of it made sense.I practically had to force them to seat us... after which it took forever to order and get our food. It seemed like the couple they seated ahead of us were known to them and I won't allow that kind of favouritism, sorry.The food was legit when it arrived. We tried the cottage cheese pancakes, the shnitzel sandwich and the eggs salami breakfast sandwich on challah bread. Everything was yummy but like I said, not worth the experience. I'll go someplace else where they appreciate my business."
/user_details?userid=pMpy37E7u8BYuyfnqkuGLw,Stefania M.,"Woodbridge, Vaughan, Canada",5 star rating,Delicious. Simple. Fresh. A cute restaurant in Mile End that serve Jewish classOverall enjoyed our experience here. The only downside is that it is a very small space and so you are sitting rather close to other diners. The inside is rustic and comfortable. We were seated very quickly considering we arrived around 11:30 for brunch. Love it!!
/user_details?userid=iFbgPR9AMci9Sg2dDsNPGw,Stanley D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Montreal truly is filled with great brunch places, this spot being no exception to it! Both food and atmosphere was great. As I usually do, I went there on a Sunday at peak brunch time so waiting was unavoidable. The wait was well worth it though.As a big fan of fried chicken, I obviously had to choose their chicken waffle plate. Needless to say, it was made close to perfection, with the chicken well crispy and the waffle well complimenting it to have a great mix of sweet and salty. Although slightly expensive, the first few bites will convince you of the quality of the food. The service was also great!Definitively a place I would recommend for great brunch, either if you are visiting or just want a good brunch spot for your craving."

/user_details?userid=3Ob5GsgWl1hUlkMezfZw4A,Sabrina L.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",3 star rating,Food is delicious and posh. Atmosphere is very clean with a retro feel. I wish the portion sizes were bigger for the price but I guess it's cool if you want to be all fancy. Nothing outstandingly hospitable or memorable about the staff interactions
/user_details?userid=Mt-_SvJyDirR9fpZx9dbEw,Tommy S.,"Bellevue, WA",2 star rating,"Against my better judgment, I've decided to give Arthur's a chance to redeem itself after it had left a bad taste in my mouth in 2016 (you can read my previous review below). Sadly, my experience today was more of the same old, if not worse. In summary, the protracted wait time and discourteous service more than negated the quality of the food.When we arrived today, we were informed of a 45-minute line-up. We decided to join the queue and gave our phone number to the staff member who told us we would be texted 5 minutes before our table is ready. Thus, we did not have to wait by the entrance like last time in 2016. I do commend Arthur's for implementing this technology.After being seated, nobody came to take our order. We decided to take matters into our own hands: I very politely caught the attention of a tall waitress with a tiny hair bun and courteously informed her that we were ready to order. Little did I know, that was apparently a major faux pas. With a forced and insincere smile, that waitress retorted ""I will be with you *WHEN I AM READY*!"" in an extremely passive-aggressive tone. We were both taken aback at her terse response and disingenuous ""courtesy"". That was very mean-spirited in my opinion. Keep in mind that we patiently waited 45 minutes to be seated, and waited another short while after being seated, and out of all the things she could have said, she decided to say those exact words! She came back around 10 minutes later to take our order, after finishing up other tasks that were subjectively more pressing to her. When she snapped ""I will be with you *WHEN I AM READY*"" passive-aggressively, it rubbed both of us the wrong way. Her tone implied that we should not have bothered her because she was busy, and that we should have bitten our tongue until spoken to. To me, this is evidence that the clients at this establishment are being taken for granted by at least some of the waitstaff. It almost seems as she's doing us a favor by even acknowledging us. She might as well have frowned and said something along the lines of ""Can't you see that I'm busy? Just wait until I come to you, jeez..."" The message would have been the same, but at least less disingenuous.Despite the terrible service, our food was good. The waitress never came back afterwards to check on us to make sure that everything was satisfactory. By the way, if you value privacy, this place is not for you because the restaurant is cramped with tables placed very closely together, with little elbow room.My experience today convinced me not to return a third time. One of the reasons why I go out of my way to spend my hard-earned money at a restaurant is not solely for the food, but for the convenience, the service, and the ambiance. Although the food was good, it was not worth the cost, especially if you have to wait 45 minutes to be seated, just to be treated like a burden in a passive-aggressive tone. I was really hoping to update my review with a better rating, what a shame!"

We were lucky we didn't have to wait in line for a table. However, the restaurant does get packed quickly and the space is tight. We orders latkes, scrambled eggs and pancakes.

We wanted to sit outside but given how busy the place was, even for a Friday morning, we ended up inside. The atmosphere is charming, it definitely feels like something from another era. I wish there was more room between tables as we literally had people's behinds dragging on our table as they moved around.We ordered the omelet, the pancakes and the latkes with coffee and mimosas. The coffee was very good and strong- a rare find in Montreal. The mimosas, were quite small and expensive with nothing special about them.The food was delicious! The pancakes were warm, fluffy and gooey with the cheese. The eggs tasted to perfection, with a generous portion of guacamole and sour cream on top. The latkes, however, were bland. We will be returning to try more things on the menu, and we are happy to see many vegetarian options!"
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Arthurs Nosh Bar has been on my hit list since day one. I know weekends are insane lineups so I decided it would be smartest to go on a weekday. Yes, you can only get the brunch items on the weekends but c'est la vie. I'll take no line every time. We came around 1:30pm on a Tuesday and were shocked to see how busy it was. The tables are squished together so prepare to get cozy with your neighbours. The inside is very chic and we were big fans of the decor/layout. The outside terrasse is also nice but they weren't making use of the umbrellas so we opted to sit in. The menus double as placemats (that's a first for me). Everything on the menu sounded delicious. Service was decent but we kept on having to ask for water. Their jugs are small; literally, pour two cups and it's gone. - All dressed matzah soup ($8.00) - couldn't resist trying their matzah soup. This is quintessential Jewish fare. Chicken, noodles, carrots and dill. Deliciously homey. A bit pricey but I don't have anyone to make this for me so...- Mc Arthur ($15.00) - portion size is huge. Chicken schnitzel served on challah bread was super satisfying. Schnitzel was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. - Latke smorgasbord ($15.00) - they weren't kidding when they named it. Scrambled eggs (perfectly cooked), latke, salmon gravlax (caviar and smoked salmon), mini cucumber and tomato salad (fresh) and pressed challah roll. Everything was impressively delicious.The hype is real and it's totally worth the price tag. Good luck if you're brunching!"
/user_details?userid=jKn_HycMvKa3yPHAUoCQAQ,Angela C.,"San Mateo, CA",4 star rating,"Middle East (Israeli-twist) cuisine! This was a refreshing option for brunch. We dropped by an unusually quiet weekend as the heat wave deterred people from going out. We didn't wait too long to be seated. They also handed out popsicles for the customers to cool down, what a considerate gesture. We ordered the Benedict option and the fried chicken with potato pancakes. The Benedict was fresh and delicious. The fried chicken was crispy and juicy; the potato pancakes stood out to me. They were fluffy and pillowy, highly recommend if you enjoy pancakes. Service was a bit slow due to the volume and the heatwave. Nonetheless, we had a good time and I would definitely come back for the potato pancakes."

It was sweet. The bagels weren't great either. Also the waiter was sort of annoying. We got there and we were literally 2 out of 5 ppl in the whole place. But she separated our table of four into two. When I told her we'd be out of her hair before anyone else arrived, she passive aggressively responded that it's a store policy and advised me to hang up my coat. Not the best service. Overall I wouldn't return/ recommend given the huge selection of brunch places in mtl."

Really, even if we had to wait 45mins (no reservations) to get a seat, it was all worth it! I liked that they text you when the table is ready (so you don't have to wait at the entrance..). Let's just say that if you are looking for a quiet moment to go grab some yummy food, no matter what time you go, it's always busy.None the less, my friends and I really enjoyed this place. I ordered the scrambled eggs. And asked for some bacon on the side. It was really tasty! So much flavor! I definitely want to go back and try something else. I really recommand this place to anyone who wants to for a brunch with family and friends."
/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Unpopular opinion but I found Arthurs to be overrated.I've been here twice and though the interior is chic and hip, I was unimpressed by the portion size and especially with the service. Originally, I was planning to give it a 3 stars. However, after having eaten here again, I don't even think they deserve 2. This is mainly due to the service. The first time I was here, we sat on the terrasse which was enjoyable on a summer day. Our food took a long time to come and the ""pitcher"" of sangria  only came once we were almost done our meals so that was annoying. The food ended up being ok though. The service was unfriendly and very slow. This time, I came with 3 of my friends to celebrate a birthday. We arrived at 1:30 and waited 25 minutes to be seated. I had the Eggs and Salami plate with added cheese. When the food came out, I was surprised to see half the plate empty. It was such a small portion that definitely didn't fill me up. It was also luke warm. Everyone agreed that there was nothing special about their meals and that they could make the same thing at home. The food was very meh in general. The service, however, was awful. Our waitress had such an attitude problem. She was just so unfriendly and made no effort to be accommodating. My friend, who is vegetarian, asked if she could replace the salmon gravlax with something else. The waitress just flatly said no. She could have added more cucumber salad, or a bit more egg or something but nope. We quickly finished the water she gave us at the beginning of the meal and she never brought us more.When we were trying to pay, the waitress gave us our bills and just stood there impatiently with the machine. Can you give us a minute please?? Three of us were paying for the 4th person's meal because it was her birthday. My friend only had pretty small change and was putting her quarters and dimes on the table to trade with me because I had bigger change. We were just doing this to be polite but in theory, if she had wanted to pay in change, she has every right to! The waitress then says, ""Actually, if you're paying in dimes, you can just keep them...we don't accept those here"". First of all, I was taking the dimes to give her the bigger change and second of all, as I said, it is not illegal to pay for a bill in change. She was just so rude. This experience has solidified my opinion of this place. I will not be returning in the near future. There are far too many great brunch places in Montreal.Thank u, next!"

The food is amazing, ambience is great and customer service is very homely. I have not seen this kind of customer service anywhere. Last time I went here was in October with my friends from Toronto. It was cold and it started to rain while we were waiting in the line. And there were some people sitting in the patio area. So the owner brought the patio umbrellas to every table outside. Also, served hot tea and coffee to people standing in the line. The owner of the restaurant made sure that everyone standing in the line was ok. Such compassion!! Must try: Moroccan toast, French fries (the best - trust me), grand slam, shakshouka and the cabbage soup. Another place that has my heart!"

Both of us were thinking that for such a wait, this place must be truly amazing or they need a more efficient reservation system. When we sat down, we saw there were way too many people cramped in this small restaurant. Luckily, we got placed in a corner by the window where we could at least here each other and no one was bumping into us. We both got mimosas, I ordered the Moroccan toast and she ordered the croissant sandwich. Both of them were amazing and a huge portion. The mimosa was really small and overpriced - I wouldn't recommend. Overall, the food was an A, but the atmosphere was a C. It was fun to see what all the hype was about, but I can't wait an hour and a half every time I want a regular brunch. It's probably a better idea to go in the summer when there is an outdoor terrace."

The food taste amazing. This time I had their new item on the menu, which was egg on top of a mashed potatoes galette topped with beef. It was amazing! Slightly too salty for me (the beef).I also had their smoked salmon on the brunch menu and it was nicely paired with salad, and some caviar on top.One down side is that they only offer filter coffees.

Food here was absolutely sublime and effortlessly met my extremely high expectation for brunch. I genuinely believe brunch spots in Montreal beats any other city I have been to and Arthur's has made it to the list of top 5. We had to wait for an hour, and we were cold but I completely forgot about it as soon as I saw the waitress get my food. As perfect as a romantic ballad, the presentation was over exceeded by the taste. I got the Moroccan toast, blackmailed my husband to get the shakshuka and of course stole a bit of my friend's Grand slam. The Moroccan toast had tahini and eggplant cooked to perfection topped with fried chickpeas and pomegranate- all those combined was like a party in my mouth. I have already decided for myself and others what we are getting next time- now it's just an agonizing wait. Highly recommend this spot, it's a bit small and crowded but the dishes make up for it. Also wasn't happy with the service or the shortbread I impulse purchased on the way out."

You can usually find parking on the streets that surround the park across the street. Right now there's construction in the area, so expect detours! The place: Small and bright with communal tables and bar seating. If you sit at the back, then you see into the kitchen. If you want a table on a weekend then I'd suggest you get there when they open. We arrived around 10ish, and were able to get seated right away, at the communal table by the kitchen. We lucked out and no one joined us.The goods: I ordered the pancakes with bacon, sausage and eggs (Grand Slam).  I rarely order pancakes but I know my friend and I would be out walking all day, so I wanted to fuel up. These pancakes were fantastic and doughy and delicious! I mean really, I could have eaten another batch but you have to draw a line somewhere. The beef bacon was good, though there was some fat - I'd never had beef bacon before but I quite liked it. I just didn't eat the fatty  bits. The sausage was OK - more like a giant hot dog, which I'm generally not a fan of. They will cook the way you ask them to, so don't be shy about letting them know what you like (but don't ask them to scramble - I don't think they'll do that!). My friend ordered the Moroccan something.... salad? I don't remember, but she loved it. We were both super happy with out meals, and while we were 100% satisfied, we didn't feel stuffed. Service: Good.Price point: I think it might be a little expensive, but I do think the quality of the ingredients + portions warrant the prices. I'd include coffee to balance things out."

Found the price reasonable - albeit it slightly more pricey than a typical option. I'll probably order from them again and will try their less ""run-of-the-mill"" noshes (e.g., perogies, latkes, and even the challah grilled cheese).Update: Tried ordering delivery from them (through Foodora) again. About 30 minutes after I ordered, they canceled the order. Not a convenient outcome (especially when you need to feed a young kid with a ""low blood sugar level"". Neither the resto, nor the intermediary (Foodora) were helpful post-cancelation. Foodora even claims that a refund for my order may take 10 days to happen!"

/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I came to Arthurs around noon on a weekday to meet a friend for lunch, and was very excited because of the great reviews. Having arrived a little bit early, I scored a table on the patio, and quickly scoured the menu.I had mentally settled on the mango salad with grilled chicken despite the cottage cheese pancakes practically begging me to order them from the table next to mine (pancakes = my weakness). My lunch date ordered the same salad sans chicken. As we waited for our food to come out, I realized that Arthurs is REALLY slow. They don't cater to quick in and out lunches that many people would likely need during the week over their lunch hour. Instead, it took well over an hour and a half before we were able to pay for our meals.Anyways, I digress. To make a long story short, the salads were just ok. The portion is not great considering the hefty $20 price tag (Mandy's salads give you way more bang for your buck and tons more flavor) and the flavor is just meh. Not bad but not great and with only 4-5 tiny mango cubes, the emphasis here shouldn't be on the mango. I found myself wishing I had ordered something else (enter: pancakes). That being said, at the end of the meal, my friend and I split the chocolate babka due to the rave reviews, and that's where we heard angels singing from the sky. That thing is DELICIOUS. As much as I would never come back for a salad here, I would practically move in just to eat those delicious babkas all day. Overall, $45 for two salads and a babka - kinda steep for what you get but maybe we made a mistake by ordering salads! I'll be back for the babka (and maybe the big fluffy pancakes)!"

The food was as near perfect as it could get. Scrambled eggs came already seasoned with black pepper on top and was perfectly fluffy. Smoked salmon came with a garnish of caviar on top, which complimented the salmon and the rest of the meal nicely. The latke was garnished with applesauce, sour cream, and chives and had a nice and crunchy exterior. The Challah was buttered then pressed and was delicious. Finally, the slightly tart and spicy cucumber salad complimented the rest of the meal nicely. Completely cleaned the plate.Phenomenal food at a more than fair price.

Surprisingly, there was no line on a Friday around lunch time. The Caesar i had was one of the best i've had. The tomato juice they use was very fresh and well seasoned. It is on the spicier side, so I would not suggest it to ones sensitive to heat. Their signature drink, slushie Rosé with peach purée is also a definite must try.I ordered the Latke Smorgasbord. The potatoes in the latke were finely grated and it was crisp on the outside. It was topped with a dollop of sour cream and homemade apple sauce. The scrambled where cooked right: runny and creamy. The bread was well toasted on all sides, slightly dense from being pressed and with just a touch of sweetness. Every component of that plate was well executed. The Avo Toast which was topped with a sunny side up egg was simple, but good as well. Our server suggested my friend to add a serving of the Malt Vinegar Fries since the toast was small for a meal. The fries were very crispy, definitely double fried, and coated with the vinegar.Overall, i was very much pleased with all the dishes and drinks. I will definitely come back to try the huge Schnitzel and brunch on the weekends. The only downsides are that we were a little thrown off at first by having to find our own seats since we were sent to 2 tables that were taken and also, for espresso lovers, they only serve regular coffee."

I was amazed by how tasty and balanced the food was. It featured a refreshingly spin on jewish breakfast staples. I used to love going to Arthurs.Fast forward to summer 2018.Where they now fall short is service and attention to details. the new staff doesn't give a damn about ensuring a good experience. You're left with the unpleasant feeling that you're annoying them or that they're doing you a favour by letting you in.For instance, I ordered a BLT sandwich at 10:30am. The waitress: ""no, the lunch items are only available after 11- me: no problem, what's the next best thing in the brunch section?- her: nothing. but we have these two sandwiches""Such a blunt and condescending response is pretty rare, even more so in a city like Montreal.To add insults to injuries, after 11:05am I was still waiting for my brunch. That's right, I was asked to change my order and wait over a half hour, all of that for no particular reason other than a complete lack of empathy or professionalism.I paid for my coffee and probably won't ever come back"

I came here on a Sunday morning at 9:30 (half an hour after they opened) and there's already a line. I took a walk in the park nearby since the waiters told me they'll scream out my name once a table is ready. I suggest sitting on the patio if there's space. The inner decor is minimalistic. My only complaint is that for $14, I expected a bit more than 2 pancakes. Maybe a side of fruit would be nice. I mean the pancakes are good, but maybe not $7 per pancake good."

They offered us chocolate babka as we waited in line and it was so soft, fresh, and delectable!Just looking around the tables, pretty much EVERYTHING looked good so we were torn trying to decide what to order. Ultimately went with the Grand Slam (syrniki, fried eggs, Nashville hot fried chicken, beef bacon, maple syrip) and the Shah Special (poached egg, latke, salmon, avocado, caviar, and side salad) from the brunch menu. Portion size is respectable - not small by any means, not huge enough that you can't finish it. PRO TIP: We also ordered the Challah and Butter from the regular breakfast menu, and to be honest, that was the wild card. I'd go here again JUST to eat the challah and butter - the bread soaked in butter and honey was absolutely delicious. Servers were quick and friendly."

I like businesses that give a little away free to keep their customers happy .. it's the thought that really counts.  Next time in nice weather I would order take out before arriving ... pick it up and take it across to the beautiful park across the street and have a romantic picnic.  Mush faster and away from the chaos.

I had their Caesar and it was very good topped with olives and a pickle and just a hint of spicy , I really enjoyed it ! I also had the matza ball soup which was basically delicious homey comfort In a bowl , the fresh dill really added something to it. My colleagues had the cabbage soup which they also raved about. They also enjoyed the latkes. Then we had the perogies which were only just okay. BUT then I had the thanksgiving dinner sandwich which was SO SO delicious , it's basically  what it sounds like , which is thanksgiving dinner between challah bread -including roasted turkey (not cold cut turkey) , cranberry sauce , challah bread stuffing and it was to die for, salty sweet tangy and awesome  ! The others at the table were raving about the mcarthur sandwich they said they loved every bite and that it had such great flavours and the Chicken portion inside was very generous and juicy. Another person at our table had the salami sandwich and also really enjoyed it , however the only sandwich one person said was just okay was the roast beef sandwich they said it just lacked a little flavour.

I indulged last week in the fried salami, latkes and eggs plate for breakfast which was a consistent delight. The bottomless coffee served with breakfast is also top-notch and the service accompanying it was wonderful.The space itself is beautiful- it's like crystal palace meets your favourite café.I was a little disappointed with the baked goods they had out on the weekday I came to visit- I tried the two sprinkle cookies they had out (the only options other than the cinnamon bun) and while they were fun, my coworker and I found them basic and indistinguishable from one another. I'm seriously looking forward to seeing these guys up their pastry game."

/user_details?userid=fHrCK0tAEzUPXBVGObGzAQ,Emily L.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Bright, bustling brunch-lunch spot that's amazing for groups. Tip: For a larger group of 5+ in the summer, ask to sit in the back terrace. You have to go through the kitchen and get to soak in the sun on a picnic table! To drink: Red and white wines. Relatively small wine selection - Only 2-3 reds and whites and one rose. Iced coffee was OK. To eat: Chicken salad and egg salad scoops served with toasts, house-pickled and fresh veggies. The pickled veggies are unreal! Perogies. Pan fried crispy on the outside. Ultimate comfort food. Latkes with house made apple sauce and sour cream. Ultimate comfort food x 2. Chicken schnitzel with chimichurri - Soooo crispy! Chimichurri adds a welcome freshness to the plate... Typically unexpected with schnitzel. Salmon gravlax plate with cream cheese and toasts. Easily our favourite dish of the day. Jam packed with flavour and a sure win for any salmon lover. Service: Excellent service during a super busy weekday lunch rush. Was attentive for our group of six and made sure we were all good even though we were the only table out on the back terrace. Our server made very good menu recommendations. To try: Would love to return for brunch"

Yes, Beauty's is a Plateau institution, but it isn't the food that attracts people there. All the dishes on the menu are quality Jew-centric food, but you pay the premium. The pancakes are worth going back for. Only did brunch. The service is very friendly and on point! Hats off to the staff. They are lacking proper coffee, only drip. The only thing that would keep people away is the price.

Had to check in inside 5 times because staff doesn't come out to get you. An additional 35 minute wait for one avocado toast and a salad...It's 2017, your food is good but this city is filled with great food and even better service. Your friends won't keep you in business.

/user_details?userid=PPgEaJQc3W35CGJUyy2R1A,Const P.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"For a restaurant that claims to not take reservations, they sure do let a lot of their friends skip the line and preferentially seat them for breakfast. Meanwhile, everyone that has hungrily and patiently waited to give this restaurant business gets punished with a longer wait time as a result. This is not a very good look for a restaurant. This has happened both times I have gone to Arthurs, and this time will be my last visit. I will dissuade any friends, family, and colleagues from dining there.If you don't have the integrity to abide by your own reservation rules, don't have them at all. Respect your customers, or lose them for good."

It can be a bit discouraging when you show up and see a big line, but the food and service makes the line worth it. I have tried a lot off their menu and my absolute favorite thing to order is the avocado toast. It's a simple yet delicious dish and very filling. The scramble is also very good. Their potato latkes are so yummy that you are left with wanting more. Service is pretty fast and the staff are very attentive towards you. I highly recommend Arthurs."
/user_details?userid=1Icmz3CDIwKE1Jfn4itL9g,Mandy P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This restaurant is exactly what Montreal needs more of. I'm a huge fan! Everything is delicious, homey and satisfying. My particular favourites are the perogies, pancakes, Cobb salad, and McArthur's sandwich. Great coffee. Only drawback is this place is small, meaning it is usually packed on the weekends and guests are practically sitting on top of one another - so definitely expect a wait, and be in the mood to speak loudly & get cozy. However, if you live in the area, Foodora delivers from Arthur's, which is a great alternative in a pinch. Tip: never, ever leave without ordering a babka. I'm not sure it's even on the menu - but you need it. Get both chocolate and cinnamon. You won't regret it."

/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My friend and I came here on a Sunday at noon. It's a great addition to the area. We had to wait almost an hour for our table because it was really happening. The time went by fast though because it gave my friend time to talk and catch up. There's a counter for people to order food and we were all standing in front of it all squished together. There were a lot of things on the menu. I was not expecting that. I'm not too familiar with Jewish breakfast food so I wasn't sure what to order and decided based on the waitress' recommendation. The food was good. I ordered the Arthurs Caesar and had the Latke Smorgasbord which consisted of  gravlax, scrambled eggs, sour cream, caviar, English cucumber salad and black Russian bread. the gravlax was good but I found the portion was smaller than I expected so I was a bit disappointed. The eggs were light and fluffy. The Latke had a sweet sauce on top. I think it was apple and I would have preferred it without it. I tried to removed as much of it off and kept the sour cream on top. My friend had the tuna melt. She was expecting a sandwich but she pretty much had to eat it with a fork and knife. She wasn't complaining about it though. I would want to go back and try their other stuff especially the shakshouka because a few people were eating it around me and it looked so good! Next time Arthurs, next time!!"
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Fall is always a crazy time schedule-wise for myself especially on weekends so when a rare free morning appeared, the only logical thing to do in my mind was to go brunch. A lot of good new brunch options have continued to pop up in and around Montreal but the one that has really grabbed my attention recently was the new one closest to me - Arthurs Nosh Bar. Situated on my favourite strip of Notre Dame Ouest in St-Henri, Arthurs is the brainchild of the owners of Back of House Catering, Raegan Steinberg and Alex Cohen. The couple's Jewish restaurant is open for breakfast, brunch and lunch and has a great look and feel.Walking in, the space feels a touch traditional Jewish deli but with some more modern sleekness. I love the combination of the penny-tiled floor, the huge green back bar lined with jars and bottles as well as the letter board menus. There is even the candy jar on the counter! But then you add the marble countertops, the bistro chairs, the leather banquets and the black-and-white pictures on the walls... the experience feels more refined than a Jewish Deli. The awesome musical mix creates a more relaxed fun atmosphere as well - anytime you have my sister and I both smiling at the choices, you are doing it right.The menu for Brunch is a mix of Jewish dishes - more Eastern European traditions from what I understand - with some modern touches. We ended up sticking to the more traditional stuff. My sister went for the Latke Smorgasbord - Latke served with gravlax, scrambled eggs, sour cream, tomato, cucumber and caviar. A solid portion with every element working well. The latke was excellent with a nice crunch to it. The texture on the gravlax was beautiful and the eggs were nice and fluffy.I went for something I had never heard of before - Syrniki or cottage cheese pancakes. I normally don't like cottage cheese on its own but its inclusion in the pancakes created a wonderfully fluffy and rich texture. Add a generous pour of maple syrup overtop and I was in pancake heaven. The pancakes were huge which made for a very filling plate. I still added a side of grilled salami to get a little kick with the sweetness overload. Grilling the salami gave it a little crunch which was a nice texture contrast to the pancakes.To finish the brunch, we decided to split a piece of Cinnamon Babka - essentially a Jewish play on a Cinnamon Roll. Nice cinnamon flavour, fluffy texture and a little sweet glaze over the top - nothing to complain about here.Arthur Nosh Bar certainly held up to my expectations... and given how the restaurant filled up within 20 minutes of it opening on the Sunday we visited, I guess plenty of others are satisfied as well. Outside of a Deli, we don't get much exposure to Jewish cuisine so it is great to see something so different in the Montreal landscape. I would definitely be interested in a dinner menu if ever they decide to go that route. In the meantime, I will simply come back to enjoy more great Brunch and Lunch fare!Cheers!"

The smorgasbord comes with latke, eggs, smoked salmon and bread, basically a bit of everything. The eggs were creamy and delicious. The latke was crispy on the outside and warm on the inside. The bread was freshly baked in house and you could taste the egg it was cooked with. The pancakes tasted like a dream. They're two pancakes, fluffy and served warm with a generous amount of maple syrup. They're cooked with cottage cheese and you can see the cottage cheese curds when breaking the pancake apart. It was very tasty, highly recommend trying the pancakes."

Upon walking into the restaurant, you see and smell comfort and flavorful. Which is what most Jewish meals are all about. It reminds you of the homemade dishes that either your Mom still cooks for you from time to time, or your grandparents used to cook as well. Their menu is filled with many German/Jewish traditional dishes, while they are beautifully presented. No doubt that their kitchen staff is loaded with talent. Bravo to them!Their entire staff, is very friendly, kind and efficient. Both owners are always on the lookout to greet their regulars and see what is happening. Along with a very well trained manager, who is always on point, along with a great friendly sense of humor. When the time arrives to decide what to order.. That's a challenge all on it's own! My suggestion would be stick to what is traditional!Their meals hold up to the value of what they are worth, along with quality and freshness. I have been there many times. Some of the dishes I've tried were the following. Cottage cheese pancakes(Fluffy, tender and moist) with a warm drizzle of Canadian maple syrup! Amazing!Their challah(A thick cut egg bread) french toast served with a sweet crumble and season fresh fruits is out of this world. Perfectly dipped in a delicious sweet vanilla mixture without making the French toast at all soggy. Browned in butter on both sides till a lovely golden brown crust is on both sides of the bread. Now, let's talk about their Schnitzel sandwich. I feel this needs the absolute focus. How can you go wrong with a thick cut of veal made into a schnitzel, served in between two very thick cut pieces of challah. Along with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and lots of pickles.  Amazing! This meal deserved an absolute standing ovation. You might be wondering, why is she in love with this place but only four stars? There is only one reason. To which I had to think twice whether it was worth only four stars. This is why. The restaurant is small, not compact. Just small. With their well deserved success mainly due to social media and their incredibly delicious meal. The restaurant is always solid packed! Weekend brunches will require alot of your pacience in terms of the waiting time for a table. You may way anywhere between 20-45mins. Perhaps more. Depending how many of you are. Now listen to me. You may not be a patient person, as many of us are often in a rush. The waiting time will be well worth the wait. I promise you! A promise is a promise after all.  However if you absolute hate waiting, on the weekends by at their door by 9am or anytime after 2pm.  Which by 2pm you might be crazy hungry, so just wait in line! :) Sit back and enjoy one of the most comforting meals St. Henri has to offer you."

After finally getting our drink order in, I notice another couple sitting down next to us and their service was much faster (they had a different server).However, once we got our drinks and was able to put in our food order, everything was forgotten since the food was really good. Especially the Moroccan Toast (highly recommended!), which is only available on the weekends. The couple that sat down next to use 10 minutes after we were seated still got their food order before us, and I had to ask for napkins, but other than that, the food is worth it, even if the service can be a bit slow on a Saturday late morning.

What I love about this place is how it introduces you to Jewish food with a modern twist! It's a lot more fun than your typical brunch food. I had the shakshuka which I thought was great, especially with the additional of pomegranate seeds. I got to try their fluffy pancakes which are amazing. It's a bit pricey but still worth it!

To compensate for the wait, the staff distributed delicious chocolate bakba to the people in line, which was very appreciated.

The lox and bagel were great, and the latkes made me miss the holidays. 100% recommend for anybody visiting Montreal looking for a great spot for breakfast, brunch, or lunch."

The food is fresh/healthy, so a good lunch option but not life changingly great. I had a kale salad and my friend had the latke smorgasbord, which had a small amount of delicious caviar, a good latke, some nice gravlax, very soft scrambled eggs, and this strange dark apple sauce, among other things. The bathroom is tiny and narrow and pretty cool. The decor and atmosphere is also fresh and nice."

I rated it 4 stars because of the service that was kinda long and because it seams like even if everyone is waiting super long in line, if some friends of employees pass by they get seated almost instantly.. i have to say that usually I'm not a fan of place that requires connection to go eat but other then service that was lacking, the food was simply out of this world"
/user_details?userid=BOBjUB1yZQhuimR2S2N0TA,Kevin C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Love the salads and the MacArthur sandwich. Definitely overpriced but the food is solid.

I love in the area so next time I'll just get everything to go or delivery. Don't know about friends getting seats first, hope it's not true, I just think they need help on seat organization."
/user_details?userid=lrPJdqIBvwT97HmNt-SAxA,Lauren R.,"Miami, FL",2 star rating,"Being from NYC, I know good Jewish food, so this was not my first experience. First suggestion, you should nosh on your hands while you wait. The manager is the worst! He never came out to get names, making people stand on line forever before realizing they had to go inside to find out the wait was ""30 minutes,"" but actually 2 hours! The owner was good - offering coffee and samples of babka. She also offered us a free mini fruit plate for the wait. Definitely tasty food, but sad to see the place is being managed by someone who if you're friends with, you will get seated first, but if you're from out of town, you'll have to wait hours."
/user_details?userid=pVNGGWaroaQ0MDHtBnmaHQ,Abir F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Went for a late Sunday brunch. Shakshouka was full of flavor and the perfect portion. The pancakes were good but next time I would opt for the french toast. Lovely staff, ambience and terrace! I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu."
/user_details?userid=hiEj-3X8gV4-kBNkySOSJw,Diana L.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"Out initial intention when we went there is to try their poutine during the poutine week festival. While waiting for our table, I saw a customer who ordered the pancake which looked delicious, and ordered this instead. Having already eaten a poutine at another restaurant beforehand, I still finished more than half my dish. The pancakes were fluffy and buttery. Still fascinated now that I'm writing about it. Will definitely go back."
/user_details?userid=EqMsXeSeIJ3bY9Rw81BAPA,Kevin G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Best brunch spot in the neighborhood and possibly the city. They hit the spot on every dish! The pickles are amazing and highly recommend the pancakes! This Jewish style food is on point!

/user_details?userid=4OfAkMFZI7L-UsQYH0hetg,Malachy P.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Arthur's makes very tasty food, very expensively and offers portions so small you would need to order three meals to feel satisfied. I had the latke smorgasbord and it occupied one third of the plate. They're latkes, they're made out of potatoes, the cheapest foodstuff known to man, so why stinge? Everything I saw go out should have been twice the size or half the price. I left feeling like a rube. Everybody was super nice, though, and I will say that the food itself was very enjoyable. If I was an independently wealthy man of leisure, I would probably eat here often. There are a lot of four- and five-star reviews here saying the food is amazing. They're not wrong, per se, but unless Arthur's offers more to their customers, I would say it's not worth it."
/user_details?userid=VXDg_octz_Wbm207FbGM7g,Katherine G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,My favourite Brunch and Lunch spot in Montreal! Amazing food and amazing quality of food too! Great staff love this place!!
/user_details?userid=JgeoVFTqogho9VGJ1v4hpQ,Whitney G.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Fantastic breakfast spot! The menu is so perfect it was difficult to choose what to get. We were eyeing the cottage cheese pancakes someone at the table next to us had (they looked amazing), but settled on the breakfast sandwich and scramble, both with challah toast. Breakfast sandwich was a bit spicy but still amazing. Scramble was perfect, as was the challah. Interior of the restaurant is cozy and exactly what you want in a breakfast spot. Can't wait to go back!"

/user_details?userid=k6jfmpAiU0RJNcHN6TdPAA,Nancy F.,"Boca Raton, FL",5 star rating,"Before heading back to the States we had to make sure we stopped into Arthur's for breakfast. So glad we did. Ordered The Scrambled with egg whites. Combination of delicious scrambled egg whites, kale, Monterey cheese, topped with mashed avocado with a side of thin crunchy grained toast. Got to try the homemade unbelievable chunky peach jam too. Coffee was delicious too. Bright,open eating area with open immaculate kitchen in the back. Friendly wait staff, great vibe. Beautiful large photos on wall of owners dad for which the place was named. Great overall experience. Would definitely go back again!"
/user_details?userid=hQ_xPEuW6BCbiIf4qq6N0Q,Char F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"As soon as I heard that Arthurs was opening in my neighbourhood, I was overjoyed. They cite one of my favourite NYC restos as inspiration, Russ and Daughters, so I knew it was gonna be good. I went this morning for my first, of what I anticipate to be many, visits. I missed breakfast by 10 mins, which I was a bit disappointed by, but The Classic (bagel, lox, cream cheese, pickled onions, tomato sandwich) was also on the lunch menu. While I waited for my food, I watched the servers bring out food to other customers and everything looked amazing. The salads were big and fresh, the scoops (egg salad, tune, etc.) looked enticing, and the gravlax had me drooling just by looking at it. The Classic I ate brought bagels and lox to a new level. I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu. I also thought the prices were really reasonable."

I like the way the space is designed but it felt a little over crowded. The food was good but nothing special. I had the Latke smorgasbord and a tea and it came to almost $20 with tax, which felt a little overprice for the amount of food."
/user_details?userid=h9rHKEgetOKqefvOCXGoYw,Barbara P.,"Exeter, NH",5 star rating,"Ate here after running a marathon- we were so hungry and they were closing in 4 minutes but happily welcomed 7 of us in! The food was Jewish inspired, very fresh and incredibly satisfying. We found the unique brunch menu to be full of comfort food."
/user_details?userid=94QoUiuwl4dtBsBG5E6pUA,danielle c.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"My parents and family are from Poland, so I know my Eastern European food. I also lived in NYC for several years and was spoiled with access to delicious babka, pierorgies etc., so I was excited to try this place. It was a real disappointment. It's essentially decent-- but def not great-- overpriced EE food in a hip area. The coffee was good, but it's $3 and the server never refilled my cup, despite the place not being busy. The server also never checked to see if I needed anything after serving the food.The scrambled eggs were undercooked; the latkes were not very tasty and overcooked. This place basically made me really miss Veselka in NYC-- lots of character and serves up delicious E. European staples for a reasonable price. Arthur's is like those hip places that open up in Brooklyn that just makes you want to go to a Polish deli and get the real deal for less money.I would probably still come here and overpay if the food and service were on point, but they weren't.  When I'm in the neighborhood, I'll be going to La Luncheonette for brunch--friendly, reasonably priced, delicious food."
/user_details?userid=hqK_6IackTJOzfs8LhP8Dw,Mitchell S.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,I tried 5 things on the menu and all were outstanding. In fact everyone I sat with felt the same. The service was quick even though the restaurant was at capacity. It's got small seating capacity but it's beautifully designed and very comfortable. Will go back anytime.

/user_details?userid=47CcVDDMylfZcuFmZQEEtg,Christine S.,"Princeton, NJ",5 star rating,GET ANYTHING WITH THEIR SALMON. Keep in mind they do not serve just fish during earlier hours (before 11). I got the latke smorgasbord ( which included salmon gravlax)  and my friend got the bagel with smoked salmon. Both were amazing and reasonably priced. Would definitely go back.
/user_details?userid=4AsPn-WBaC1ilRG0yzqtUA,J C.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,Really good food here.  A bit hard to get into but worth it.  I try to go at non-peak hours.  Nice service.  I love the avoToast and Salami sandwich.

/user_details?userid=jmW7b-eT7EYRNfFuLPLdlg,Helena D.,"Kirkland, Canada",3 star rating,"My mother, aunt and I came in to Arthur's at 1:30 on a Saturday, we left our name and phone number then went next door to grab a coffee. The hostess told us it would be about a 30-45 minute wait. When we didn't receive a phone call 45 minutes later, we decided to go in and see what was going on. As we entered, a group of three that had given their name after us were being seated. The hostess then told us we would be the next to be seated. 30 minutes of standing later, about 5 groups of two had been seated. Instead of waiting for two groups of two to leave in order to give us a seat, the hostess continued to seat couples instead of us. We ended up being seated after over an hour and a half. At the end of the day, the hostess was a really sweet girl, she felt really bad about the whole situation. Unfortunately, she had not been properly taught on how to prioritize her reservation list. Thankful the food was great we had a wonderful waitress."
/user_details?userid=sQXIy6FUN5MZkPEaGD5xnw,AJ C.,"New Orleans, LA",3 star rating,"The food we received (eventually) was excellent.  The ""service"" is downright awful and the manager or owner? (tall skinny guy) got defensive when questioned about the poor service. Maybe he will figure out how to correct the issues instead of creating excuses.  If you are prepared to tolerate horrible service and attitude then this is the place for you as you won't be disappointed with the food."
/user_details?userid=tI_tT6_hYO9hpxhWWBOXWw,Monica E.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The restaurant is cute but a bit small. As a result the waiting time is ridiculous. We waited 40 min. on a  Sunday for lunch. The staff is very welcoming and hard working.The food tries to be traditional Jewish with a modern twist. It misses the mark on a number of their dishes. But the part that upset us the most were the prices, outrageous. $3 for a Moishe's pickle. It is a ""hipster"" place, for people who miss Grandma's food, and want to be seen by others. Did not feel it was worth the wait."
