Came here last weekend after lunch, so we didn't order brunch menu. We only ordered two cups of latte and cookies.  The cookies are delicious  They also have a lot of choices of crepe."
/user_details?userid=NHak4_gzkWVIYNzDJ-wCWA,Steven P.,"Paducah, KY",5 star rating,"This goes down on my list of best breakfasts.  Top 5?  Yeah, I think so.  We went on a Friday morning in May and it was my most memorable meal of the dozen or so that I had in Montreal!My wife had the creme brulee crepe, I had a savory crepe.  The coffee was great and the matcha latte (as you can see from the picture) had the most amazing artwork.  The location was near the heart of the Old Port district, but it was a couple of blocks away from the center of everything.  Actually, I think that helps keep the vibe.  If it was right on the main square or near the basilica, you might have tourists wander in.  As it is, though, people have to seek this place out and that's what we did. I can't imagine there are more creative crepes in town and there certainly isn't better latte art!  The atmosphere was good: it's small, calm, and clean.  The service was fine and I thought the prices were a bit on the high side.  If we are ever back in Montreal, I will try this spot at lunch."

We looked for  a café in the area and decided to go to Muru Café. This wonderful family owned restaurant is very clean, cozy and cute. The owner was very friendly and nice. My cousins ordered the D'accord and Creme Brûlée. I ordered something a Smoked Salmon Sandwich.D'accord 4/5 - My cousin said that the mustard was in one area of the Crêpe and it over powered it.Creme Brûlée 5/5 - we all loved it!! When I come back I will definitely come backSmoked Salmon Sandwich 5/5 - My cousin and I liked it a lot. She hates smoked meat, onions and tomatoes. But when she tried the sandwich she liked it.Staff 5/5"
/user_details?userid=ncAOj5Xz-XS6bpSnTWp3tQ,Austin G.,"Washington, DC",3 star rating,"While wandering through the edge of Old Montreal, I stumbled upon this cafe. From the outside, it looks like a cute French style corner cafe. I was craving coffee so I went in.It's mainly a sit-down restaurant with a place to order coffee and pastries on the go. The decor inside isn't as nice looking as the outside and some of it is borderline cheesy.I ordered a latte to go. Compared to all the other coffee shops I visited while in Montreal this one wasn't anything special. Save the $4-$5."

/user_details?userid=Dfu-NuG1YWB96jjBLIlsrA,Krysten I.,"Honolulu, HI",5 star rating,"We were walking through old town and I decided I needed a crepe. Checked on yelp and Muru had really great reviews, so I called to make sure they were open (I've been surprised at how many places in Montreal were closed when they were supposedly open, according to yelp... not yelp's fault, I think it's just too cold outside). Luckily I did call because I found out that the kitchen closes an hour earlier than what is listed on yelp. The restaurant is really cute. It was cozy and cafe-y and we were the only once's inside. I ordered my crepe for $14 and my friends ordered other items including a matcha latte. When the matcha latte came out, it was maybe the best part of our night lol. It has the cutest little Totoro drawn ontop. Of course, we later find out that one of the waiters was a latte art champion! Whaaat!!? Yeah, super cool. My crepe was good, too. It's very conveniently located next to the water, and we walked/slid down to the Ferris wheel when we were finished. They also offer more substantial food and drinks, like alcoholic drinks. I'd definitely go back here if I find myself in Montreal again!"

Little drizzling rain and feeling like udon but opted for the D'Accord crepe.  Really good.  Came with a side garden salad which was amazingly lush and green. The dressing was simple, light and refreshing. Nice bright space. Lots of natural light and high ceilings. It's nice here after the lunch rush because its nice and mellow, good music, a perfect place to do a little work.  Took the time to write out some plans for an upcoming project when the young ladies at a couple tables down started talking about Kate Spade. I was like WTF???  So I joined their conversation. Ugh...so heartbreaking.  Remember to love your loved ones people.  And to be gentle with strangers. You never know what they are going through."

/user_details?userid=TbpsLQpZsEy_x-uLfRVMfg,Nick B.,"Lincoln, NE",4 star rating,This is a cute crepe place we saw on yelp. Decided to give it a try for lunch.  The chicken pesto sandwich was delicious. 5 of 5. The crepe I ordered didn't turn out so well. First it was brought out with the salmon still in it despite ordering with no meat.  Next one out I discovered that the eggs were raw not scrambled. Made the best of it but wasn't my favorite. The flavor was dominated by a mushroom sauce.  Needed a spoon instead of a fork. The desert crepe was delicious. Service was friendly and attentive despite the mistake on the order.
/user_details?userid=bqHqs6JaWmZ2LpMbizMfaQ,Cyn B.,"New Orleans, LA",4 star rating,Another fantastic place I found on Google maps!  While in Montreal I had to get a crepe!  Started my first full day off here to get a savory crepe.  The surprise was the deeeelish honey cinnamon latte (see pic).  The D'Accord crepe was a generous size giving me plenty of fuel to start my adventure in Old Town.   The menu has something for everyone and the prices are great for the portion sizes.  Hopefully I'll be back for breakfast again!
/user_details?userid=fKq-iO8-bhK61_M--JebsQ,Larry D.,"Auburn, MA",1 star rating,"We came here because of the creme brulee crepe. Never seen anything like it so we just had to try it. When we arrived we sat down and found out that the creme brulee had bananas. Waitress then proceed to tell us that they could not substitute the banana for something else. I wouldn't even mind paying extra but just got a straight up no. We still ordered the creme brulee crepe and it was amazing to look at but the there was barely any creme brulee. It was just a soggy crepe with bananas, whip cream and a creme brulee burnt sugar on top. The worst part was definitely the waitress, only 2 tables in the restaurant and she was on her phone the whole entire time. Management needs to step up."
/user_details?userid=oGPlVjPLj89SjJZ_lW4mfA,Sharon G.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"This is a charming creperie at the edge of the old city, quiet and surrounded by elegant restaurants and a mix of modern and older apartments. The crepe filled with chicken, spinach, and a well-seasoned mushroom sauce was excellent. This was accompanied by perfect battered fries and a salad with fresh greens, tomatoes, and a dressing made from a very flavorful olive oil. It was an excellent light meal all together. My husband got a crepe filled with mozzarella cheese, beef, eggplant, and some additional Italian vegetables. It was a little too cheesy for our tastes, so be prepared. Their espresso drinks are definitely worth a stop on their own. We enjoyed a cappuccino and a caramel macchiato while sitting by the window and watching a sudden lightning storm roll by. They let you relax and enjoy the space as long as you'd like."
/user_details?userid=FsGjL_GNpzhvSCQ3DJiHpA,Ibrahim M.,"Scottsdale, AZ",3 star rating,Found this place on yelp.  Kids liked the crepe but was overpriced - spent $14 for a crepe with Nutella and fruit.  I would rate this place 4 stars however there is no central ac.  Was a hot day in Montreal so we color not enjoy ourselves and kept asking for ice to put in our water.  I would probably pop in for coffee but not the crepe if I were in the area again.
/user_details?userid=ANRMJGXR-lq5mV_41S4y4g,Eric W.,"Cranford, NJ",4 star rating,Was visiting from US this weekend and needed a place for crepes near Old Montreal.  Went with my g/f and two teenagers.  I had the house salad which had a delicious dressing; the kids had banana crepes and they were practically licking the plates.  Lots of people ordering Crême Brûlée's and lattes - saw a lot of smiling faces.  Definitely worth a visit.

/user_details?userid=MpE_DpS8vKZpLqaMzOJGvg,Pam L.,"Gouldsboro, PA",5 star rating,"Wow! Simply wow! The food was delicious. Out of all of our meals, my son's breakfast was the best. He got the banana creme brûlée and the whole table was picking off his plate. The presentation alone was magnificent. I got the crepes with the fruit and my daughters got the crepes with the Nutella. All were amazing. My husband got a latte and the egg breakfast. Not a single piece of crumb was left on the plates. My children kept begging for us to bring them back each morning. Highly recommend this place!!"
/user_details?userid=37AqJydkC0EZgprx9A3qzw,Raphael S.,"Lake Hiawatha, NJ",4 star rating,"Clean, modern, tasty food for a light coffee and some snacks. My family and I were visiting from outside the country and needed a place to eat before we left. This was for breakfast, there's some vegan options here which is great. Waiter was very succinct and had provided some recommendations. The menu was clear. I ended up ordering the croissant and some jam, their selection of two cookies and trying their ginger kombucha. The kombucha kind of tasted like ACV lightly with a kick of ginger seltzer, in a good way. It was pretty tasty. The cookies were filled with flavour and the croissant was nice and smooth and full of lovely layers. Looking forward to coming here again to try some of their more options if I come back to Montréal."

/user_details?userid=y9wNnI9xczOT2xKOrimvGQ,Sébastien H.,"Aloha, OR",3 star rating,"The avocado toast and the mango lassi we had were good. Those were probably 4 stars. But if you know your crêpes, you will be disappointed by their savory crêpes. They make the savory crêpes with a flour batter (and maybe milk) instead of just water and buckwheat. So those were 1 star."
/user_details?userid=QNYiW1S7pxEQDxbb044oJA,Melissa B.,"Melville, NY",5 star rating,"Crepes, fries and hot chocolate were all amazing! We shared the three cheese and merci beaucoup crepes for a mix of savers and sweet. Great choices!"
/user_details?userid=y_Rm-eVwgzPidDp07q7oyg,Bhavita M.,"Edison, NJ",5 star rating,I am not a big coffee person but we just happened to walk around this place finding parking and I am so glad we went it. Small quaint little cafe with interested coffee options with home made cookies and shoe bread . Try the earl grey and lemon biscuits and the sea salt chocolate crumble cookie. It was to die for! The icing on the cake was the rose latte... hint of rose syrup with espresso and sprinkled with rose petals. One of a kind must try!
/user_details?userid=IXuIZ3NM9D9yvDkIPNbS1g,Lauren B.,"Parrish, FL",5 star rating,Fabulous place that we only discovered from yelp. The crepes were amazing. We did have to wait for a table during lunch time. Overall a must eat.

Excellent crepes (both sweet and savory), great cappuccino, good hot chocolate. (If you're a fan of latte art, this is the place for you!) Very nice staff. Wish we could've gone there more in order to try even more things."
/user_details?userid=G_ewrDXcU0hXovihr2G5og,Andrew M.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"Muru Crêpe was really good! During our stay in Old Montreal in February, we were on the hunt for a creperie within walking distance. Their hours online said that they'd open at 9:30am, however, when we arrived around 10am they were just then opening their doors. Thankfully we got there just in time because after we sat the place filled up immediately. The service was so-so, however, when 15 tables are seated at once, it's not going to be easy to take care of everyone in a timely manner. Still, maybe adding an additional server during this busy rush could be helpful.I had the crepes with banana, strawberry, and nutella and my fiancée had the banana, nutella, and vanilla ice cream. I don't eat crepes very often, but they were really thin, beautifully plated, and served with very fresh fruit.Overall, I'm a fan!"

Very glad I did because the chips were delicious.The crepe was amazing. The mushroom sauce and the goats cheese had melted together and become a fusion of yum inside the crepe parcel. The crepe itself was so good.Just go here. It's good. I promise :)

I had a sweet crepe with bananas and strawberries, covered in chocolate syrup. Mmmmm it was absolutely delicious and worth every dollar. If you're craving a sweet or savoury crepe, I don't think you can go wrong with this place.The service was ok. I came in with my own coffee and the guy gave me a bit of an attitude when I asked him to warm it up, referring to the policy of ""don't bring outside food here"". In the end, he agreed to warm up my coffee and even gave me extra cream on the side. I left a good tip :)"

/user_details?userid=t6EA5Nan-GsiattaFnnv9w,Sindy H.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Took my best friend here when she came to visit me from Toronto. The service was incredibly slow. It took a good 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledge us and another solid 40 minutes before our food arrived. Nobody even bothered to refill our water.  As for the food, I ordered a savory crepe with chicken, spinach and pesto  (~$12) while my best friend opted for a sweet crepe with banana, strawberry and nutella ($15). The sweet crepe was way too sweet and not at all comparable to juliette au chocolat or cacao 70. My savory crepe was mediore at best, but again nothing to rave home about. Don't really get the hype and probably will not be returning."

We got the pesto chicken croque and the creme brûlée crepe and my god was that a good decision! The only bad decision was we should have ordered tons more because it was insanely good. The crepe was light and had just the right amount of sweetness and what do I say about creme brûlée, easily among one of the best desserts. Also they serve it in a fun cone form so very pleasing to the eye too. Kids if you're in Montréal, you need to visit Muru!!"

/user_details?userid=Am_G2m0pwVrEg9AoUp5tow,Gia M.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"Muru Crepe was just the light lunch I needed to keep me going during a busy day of sightseeing in Montreal.Upon arrival, we were shown to our small table and left to peruse the menus. I initially thought about ordering a sweet crepe, but instead went for the chili crepe (it came with fries). I was blown away by the french fries, which had that thick flour batter that makes you want to gobble up every one in sight. The thin crepe was delicious, while a little heavy on the jalapenos for me (and I like spicy food), but after picking out a few of the peppers, I devoured the whole thing. If I came back, I would probably go for a more traditional crepe, as I stared in envy at Jared's plate for most of the meal (he went with a sweet banana crepe).Once you are done eating, you can pay at the front counter before continuing on your way. This spot is super cute and perfect for breakfast or lunch before seeing the rest of the Old Port."

/user_details?userid=dIRTUvNn9HSG7SlCB1CdKw,Har D.,"Philadelphia, PA",2 star rating,No substitute allowed in your crepe. It's as if it's pre made and they kind of microwave your food. The scones was good however the cream is pumped into a container from a can. Coffee is excellent
/user_details?userid=6zktXAC4Hx9pw389dyO3MA,Andrew U.,"Providence, RI",5 star rating,I don't give out too many 5 star reviews but this place is definitely worth the trip. The food was amazing and so was the staff. I had the egg crepe and my fiance had the nutella strawberry and banana crepe.   Both were amazing. I can only say that the home fries needed some seasoning. The ice coffee I had was delicious and I wish there was more. Her chai was amazing and they stenciled in a snail with the cream.   It's a small place and the staff bust their ads.  Great place to start off your day in old port.

/user_details?userid=7kfJk_NtOslC9jPk2Koz3g,Yvonne C.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"The crepes here are so springy! I love me some bounce to my chew.HAM AND CHEESE is nice and simple, felt like a grilled cheese.I don't recall which was which, but between the FANTASTIQUE and the INCROYABLE, one had roast beef and also loaded with cheese; the white wine dijon sauce gave a little tang but def not a saucy dish. The roast beef sounds really enticing but it's one measly deli meat-thickness slice of roast beef. Rather negligible. The other had veggies (potato and peppers if i recall) and a mushroom sauce. We were expecting the mushroom sauce to be loaded on top but it, like everything else, was wrapped inside. Not far from cream of mushroom soup tasting (not bad but predictable, I suppose).Nothing spectacular here but definitely could be satisfying if you find the right fillings."
/user_details?userid=lPnqgRjBytJljpZMCip5gg,Dawid Z.,"Newark, NJ",4 star rating,Came here for a late breakfast and ordered a Nutella Crepe and a coffee. I have to say the presentation of the food is very impressive and made the experience that much better. The coffee and crepe tasted very good l so I must compliment them on that. The reason I took a star away was because I felt like the portion was a bit small and not very filling when ordering the sweet crepes. The service was very pleasant and we were attended to very well. Overall I was impressed with this Cafe.

My friend took a caramel macchiato and a D'accord Goat cheese mushroom crêpe with fries and salad, it was weird at first but not bad at the second bite. A nice brunch place that's quite popular even on weekdays, price is fairy enough, I would recommend this café to my friends :)"

They were not served rolled but flat and came with half salad/half fries...so I didn't feel too guilty.  But it was really tasty.  Their ice tea is also out of this world good.Decor - Cozy and very french cafe like. Service - This lost them a star.  Their service was really slow and we let them know we had a plane to catch.  Now I know its not their job to care and to just go at the pace they go, but if we tell you...you say no problem..and then it takes you 10 minute to bring us even water or take our order while we see you chit chatting behind the counter about nails...eh...I'm taking away the star.Price: Overall, OK for what we ordered.Noteable Extras: Nothing to note, except I'll mention that delicious ice tea again."

We made it to the restaurant about forty minutes before they closed, and were finishing up with only minutes to spare, but the staff remained extremely pleasant and welcoming.Husband and I decided to share a crepe which had chicken, ham, swiss cheese and a white wine dijon sauce. It came with a side salad and a side of fries. We each were very satisfied with our half-crepe as it was late in the afternoon and we didn't want to fill up too much before our 6pm dinner reservation across town. While this did not remind me of the savory crepe I'd had in Paris, it was still incredibly delicious. Served piping hot and bursting with flavor! The side salad and fries were equally wonderful. We would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a yummy lunch crepe! We did not try the desert crepes so I cannot speak to that, but next time I'm in Montreal, I'll be sure to stop by to try!"

My daughter had the Nutella and fruit crepe (how can you go wrong with Nutella). I had the three cheese crepe with bacon. The crepes themselves were cooked to perfection. The presentation was a great touch and the service was fast and attentive but we went around 10am so it wasn't as busy.

First, the cafe is super cute. Definitely a French vibe and it's location not right on the main drag in the Old Port area makes this a neighborhood gem and looking at others devour their crepes definitely a solid spot. The omelette was good. Nothing crazy, or anything you'd see on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives but just a small omelette with some fresh ingredients. As someone on a diet, I was stoked to have some roasted potatoes to accompany the omelette as advertised on the menu, but instead they were deep fried (womp womp). I sampled a few for the sake of this review (the things I do for Yelp) and they were of course awesome but again, these home fries were deep fried. I didn't eat the bread but it was thick cuts of fresh bread. Carbs, hmmmmmmmm.Overall a definite solid spot for a moderate priced lunch. I'd come again when I can eat some crepes and those fried potatoes!"

Anyhow, they took our name & number and told us to return in 20. As we left, we spotted some beautiful fauna and proceeded to snap some photos when the waitress came out and called us back! Apparently the ""reserved"" party couldn't make it - so we got their spot! Wahooooo.The waitstaff are all super polite and sweet; the restaurant is family owned. My boify even sweet-talked himself to a 25% discount on his $3 OJ haha...good job boify. We placed our orders for 3 savory crepes and 1 sweet crepe and waited patiently.Almost 30 mins later, our food arrived. The crepes looked amazing and the portions were big - but the winner here are their FRIES! They're amazingly crispy, the perfect shade of golden brown, and a little seasoned. We ordered an extra side of this! The crepes themselves were pretty good, and the dessert crepe, well, you can't go wrong with Nutella ;) The bill was decent for 4 people; I believe each crepe dish was about $11-13.

Yelp, once again, came to my rescue and I found Crepe Cafe to go to after checking out the Notre Dame cathedral.

The savory crepes are served with fries or salad. Here's a note: your crepe will already come with a small salad so you might as well just order fries, unless you want a bigger portion of salad.Service was noticeably slow with diners looking around for their food or for the employees to bring them the menu. The owner (?) did come around to each table to make sure everything was okay though. When you're done, go up to the cash register and pay.If you're not feeling like eating a crepe, they also serves sandwiches and egg dishes, which looked equally tasty as well.

/user_details?userid=K3xmIvNRXaFgeTpRc25GrA,Rodger L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Muru Crêpe Cafe is a cozy Crêperie in the Old Port of Montreal, and they mean business when it comes to making crêpes.  Their menu is simple and unassuming; it offers over 30 tantalizing varieties of crêpe as well as sandwiches, soups, and salads, meaning there's something for everyone.  In a nutshell, I'm faced with an impossible decision.After asking the patient waitress for her recommendation, I like to pretend that ordering the sweet crêpe, 'Cri D'Amour' was my idea. My hungry friend offered 2 savory crêpes and the waitress promptly sent in our order. I had but one sip of coffee when my friend's savory crêpe called the 'Tout A Fait' arrived. Unlike some open crêpe, this one was neatly tucked in a square: a parcel of chicken, ham, Swiss, and white wine Dijon sauce. As he cut into the crêpe, hot steam rolled forth, with Swiss cheese parting into fine threads. I jumped on his offer to try my first-ever bite of crêpe. Immediately, I noticed how the piquant Dijon sauce perfectly complemented the richness of the cheese, and the earthy flavors of the meat. The thin and fluffy layers of crêpe added a pleasant texture as well.When my 'Cri D'Amour' arrived, a giddy smile washed over my face. The presentation was just amazing, and every second spent taking this picture intervened too long with my first bite. The chef piled generous layers of fresh strawberry and banana, with just the perfect amount of nutella chocolate spread over the fluffy crêpe. The strawberry glaze and fresh hand-whipped crème were the perfect additions to an already impressive confection. What I love most about the 'Cri D'Amour' is that it was not overwhelmingly sweet, granting each ingredient the room to work its way around my palate.   The final crêpe to arrive was my friend's savory 'Monsieur Muru' consisting of smoked salmon, capers, tomatoes, cream cheese, and chives. I found the presentation to be very similar to the first crêpe, but liked that the chef had chosen to fold back like a blanket the top to reveal the bright reds and oranges of the tomato and salmon within. The plate was delicately garnished with finely chopped herb, and I looked on enviously as my fatty friend enjoyed his second crêpe from first bite to last.  After a VERY enjoyable meal, we went up to pay at the cash register wondering what damage we had done to our wallets. I was thrilled to see our HKSN membership card proudly displayed on the cash register. With our full bellies, we were extremely pleased with the price, and this was prior to the 10% discount received by all HKSN members. Also, I want to draw attention to the happy fact that both of the savory crêpes were identical in price at less than 12$ each -- I often find a price premium charged on special ingredients like smoked salmon, meaning that Muru lets ingredient combinations dictate your crêpe decision, not the price.  Ultimately, Muru Crêpes Café knows the business and creates a great atmosphere to please their customers. The service is warm, fast, and efficient. From what I have sampled, the food is very good, with enough variety on the menu to warrant multiple visits. Finally, the price is reasonable, and with a HKSN membership, this restaurant is a ton of value for the buck. The next time you're looking for an excellent lunch or have the need to satiate a crêpe craving, just remember: Muru Crêpes Café."

The USA is known for sh!t coffee, and my travelling partner hasn't had a good coffee in quite a while so was hesitant. However, we thought surely our best bet at decent coffee was French Canada. Turns out... yep! This coffee was pretty good!Crepes: oh man. We split a Nutella + Bailey's Irish Creme + chocolate crepe (topped with so many mini marshmallows). I was pretty stuffed after my croque and chocolat chaud but simply could not stop eating this deeeelicious crepe.Waitstaff: The staff were all really friendly, happy to speak in French or English. We went there twice and weirdly enough it seemed like we got slightly larger servings when we ordered in French, haha. Price: Two croques + two hot drinks + one crepe + tip = around $40.

Upon arriving we chose this spot for breakfast and then the day we left we came back for a repeat. First visit not bad, I got the croque-madam and it was ok, although not what I was expecting. The accompanying salad on the plate was substantial enough that I walked out full. My girl ordered the the savoyarde the first time - potatoes, bacon, creme fraiche inside a crepe. It was fantastic she also ordered frites with the salad and said they were sweet, crisp, thinly cut, and perfect.The second time I did the man dish ""bonne journee"" sausage, bacon, ham, egg in a crepe, and she the bon matin saumon fume...er smoked salmon with creme fraiche or something like that. They lost points this visit because they reversed the order and put my crepe on her plate and then decided to tell us we were wrong when we pointed it out. I'm sorry, but I'm pretty sure I know the difference between salmon and sausage. I mean I know they both start with the letter S, but that's as far as it goes. We would have both liked to try their dessert crepes however didn't bring along our larger stomachs, this will have to be a spot we visit on the next trip. Aside from the stumble on the second day, the only other con I can mention is that we wouldn't recommend their tea though, not a lot of choice, just the Earl Grey green tea."

/user_details?userid=2T7IWnZjZcifxS305CprUQ,Sophie G.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Absolutely over-hyped.Known as the ""best crepes in town"", I was expecting a lot of this place. The food was disappointing to say the least, consisting of very standard crepes (reheated?) that made me feel like I could do better at home.Muru Crêpe feels like it's run by a group of students, both service-wise and in the kitchen. Their menu is pages and pages long, with cryptic-crêpe names that are meant to entice you to order (""Wake me up"", ""Sunny morning"", ""Again"", ""Quite exactly so"", ""I agree"", ...). Generally a menu focused on one food item, in this case the flatter cousin of the pancake, shouldn't come with a thousand variations - either let the customer completely personalize their dish with a selection of items of their choice (such as making a fruit list and asking customers to pick 3) or focus on a handful of interesting or classic combinations. Otherwise, it becomes unnecessarily confusing, considering the end result is essentially just different toppings inside the crêpe regardless of the 'fanciness' of the name.Crêpe combos come with a choice of garden salad, fries or both. The fries were the ones from Costco, the Kirkland variety (excellent, do not get me wrong, but I hope for a little bit more frozen products when I dine out). Salad is utterly lackluster.I ordered some sort of mushroom crêpe, that came folded with all the toppings inside. There was an extra fee (4$!) if I wanted some cheese on top of it, grand theft in my opinion. The mushrooms and peppers seemed to have been sitting in some odd mixture, definitely not fresh. They were also very scarce with the filling. When the crêpe came, it was lukewarm. The other crêpes elicited similar uninspired reactions from the other guests I was dining with. Only exception, one guest particularly enjoyed their omelette. At a crêpe place, you wonder if there is a problem that the omelette was the most enjoyed dish...Their sweet crêpes are similar uninspired, varying on a theme of nutella/strawberry/sugar. We dined there for brunch on the week-end, place was relatively empty. I will not come back."

It's nice and quiet (at least when we went in the morning, it was), and there are plenty of choices. I opted for the Fabuleux crepe and do not regret at all. The chicken found its place in the perfectly melted cheese inside a delicate, square-shaped crepe. The meat was juicy and it was just so tasty. I can imagine .. some baby spinach and oven-cooked chicken instead would've taken it to the next level. Mmmm.....I would definitely go back for a second run. The drinks look fancy and the prices on the menu are quite reasonable. If I were to nitpick this place, it would the speed of service. While I understand that there's only one person cooking so the dishes come out one by one.. it would be nice if our food was served quick enough so our group of 7 could eat all together."

The ambiance is warm and romantic. We had a breakfast/brunch crepe called the M11 and it was delicious. The ratio of meat, cheese, and crepe were perfect! We had a side of home fries but I would have liked to try the potato hash, looking back. The sweet crepe we got was the Cri D'Amour, really decadent and again, perfectly balanced. They also do their drinks well--we got a cappuccino and mokaccino. I read that service was unsatisfactory in someone else's post... for me, it was more than good. Our waitress was extremely helpful and attentive. The wait wasn't long and overall the experience was great.

I ordered their smoked salmon crepe which I couldn't finish given that it was so big.So I waited.  And waited.  And waited.  No one came around again to ask if I wanted more water or coffee or to clear my table and offer me my bill despite it being very obvious that I was finished and wanted more beverages.  Patrons entered the restaurant asking for tables and the staff turned MANY people away or asked them to come back and told them they were currently full.  Had they just offered a bit more efficient service they wouldn't have lost so much business and annoyed me.I'd go back for the food and just hope that the slow service and one cup of water/coffee for an hour long breakfast was just a one time mistake.

My friend had a breakfast savory crepe with smoked salmon, egg, cheese, and mushroom, and it was really tasty and creamy.

Walking in, we saw a bright sunny cozy dining area with huge windows that look out onto an intersection for lots of people-watching.  The service was outstanding.Funny thing was, by the time we got there, I wasn't in the mood for a crepe anymore.  My companion had one, though, and the taste I had was delicious (of course).  I had a salade nicoise, and it was fresh and huge and scrumptious.

No trouble finishing that one.For my part, I had the Dejeuner Muru Au Saumon. This is my go-to archetype crepe with which to judge any creperie by and they passed muster with room to spare.

Wonderful!Had an early dinner so also enjoyed a glass of wine. Old Montreal cobblestone streets are moments away. Excellent service.

We went for lunch one day & got  Crepes Salees w/ salads & fries (fries were REALLY crispy & good) and we went back mid-week for the sweet stuff: I got the blueberry, BF got the Cri D'Amour (bananas, nutella, strawberries) -- his was better, but both were yummy. super casual, but really yummy & reasonably priced."

/user_details?userid=nO4UJKsTFTyST_7X9REp0Q,Leah M.,"Kihei, HI",4 star rating,"Stopped by here when we first landed in Montreal. It is located at the very tail end of Old Montreal tucked away from the most touristy area. The service was great - the ladies that worked there were very attentive and nice. I liked that the crepes were served with a choice of salad, fries or both. Great fries! The butter, sugar, and maple syrup sweet crepe is amazing! They have changed their name since (Muru Crepe), but the shots of the exterior and interior are exactly the same."

/user_details?userid=8-U6FgqWxNmXz80JhJQXZg,Emily U.,"Indianapolis, IN",4 star rating,"This cute café on the outskirts of the main tourist area of old town actually seems like it's patronized by locals and regulars. This was a lovely place for lunch if you're in the mood for crepes. The ambiance was a little fancier than I expected, but it wasn't pretentious at all. My ""Delicieux"" crepe was excellent, with eggplant, cheese, tomato sauce and veggies. The other crepe we had was a bit over-the-top, with some kind of creamy cheese and veggies. I can't recall the name of it. You can choose salad or frites to accompany your crepe. Tip: If you order the frites, you'll still get a little salad as well. I was only disappointed in the fact that we didn't have room for the dessert crepe with Nutella, strawberries and bananas."

/user_details?userid=R91JLSvG4SpJi5fvGbwzlg,Chris S.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,Adorable and delicious cafe worth the walk out of the way before or after a tour of Notre Dame. We had soups and crepes. The cream of vegetable was excellent. I had the Voila crepe with turkey    Swiss and bechemel sauce. The side salad was delicious and the service perfectly tempered.
/user_details?userid=0RHocxp-_bPJu8sSfB_A1w,pete m.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"We went here because of the positive reviews on yelp and unfortunately we were disappointed. We would recommend looking elsewhere if you are in Montreal and looking for a good crepe. Read on if you would like to see our justification. We ordered two breakfast crepes, two coffees and 2 glasses of orange juice. All in bill was $32 before tip. Positives:- good location just on the edge of old Montreal and out of the way from the typical tourist restaurants- servers were nice enough and showed us a table right awayNegatives:- crepes were very greasy, overwhelming amount of cheese, lacking in other contents mentioned on the menu- the sides were weak - the hash brown was overly crispy from being deep fried (also their version of a hash brown was a pre-bought frozen variety - similar to what is found at McDonalds)- the fruit that came with the sides should have had the rind cut off before going on the plate - this just seemed lazy on their part. - crepe shells appear to be pre made and then reheated when an order is taken (I can't verify this as I didn't see the crepes being made) Normal crepes have a consistent pancake brown colour, these ones were yellow with brown spots created from heating after the contents of the crepes were put in. (see the pictures that other reviewers have submitted) - coffee not included in the price of the breakfast crepes despite being included with other breakfast menu items (seemed a little sneaky when the bill arrived) also refills were never offered.- orange juice appeared to be from concentrate... Any restaurant should be able to have not from concentrate OJ- the server could not tell which crepe was which after our order arrived - not a big deal, but thought it was funny since another reviewer mentioned this happened to them."
/user_details?userid=_Vd-dedw_r0TsxluUh5ogw,katie j.,"Irvine, CA",3 star rating,"Lovely lunch spot in the outskirts of Old Montreal.  Calm, quaint atmosphere, cozy yet classy decor.  Loved our window seat.  My expectations of the crepes were a bit too high due to the high yelp ratings... I did enjoy them, but they were not the best crepes I've ever had.  Foodnalysis:- Classique (ham, cheese, egg) breakfast crepe - generous size, almost a large as the non-breakfast crepes. I wasn't extremely hungry, so the breakfast portion was perfect for me.  Came with...- Side salad with mushrooms and tomato - excellent dressing.  - Coffee - great accompaniment.  A trip to a cafe like this in a place like Old Montreal is never complete without coffee!The Bottom Line:Cute spot for crepes in a quieter part of Old Montreal."
/user_details?userid=BYpeTH-AMyLWx1615HmC_g,Lauren W.,"Torrance, CA",5 star rating,"I was told by my cousin that one thing I had to eat in Montreal was a crepe, so I looked up Muru Crepe on yelp. I'm so glad I did! My husband and I walked up here when we were exploring Old Montreal. I ordered the Savoyarde crepe and my husband ordered the Attention crepe. He loved the spicy flavors and the chili in his crepe. I thought mine was better, personally. It was savory, creamy, and perfect. Both crepes were stuffed to the brim, which I loved. They didn't skimp on the filings! We both got a green salad and fries. The salad was very good, but the fries were absolutely amazing! I don't know exactly what spices they used on them, but the fries were perfectly salted and had just the right amount of other seasonings. I had to have the waitress take my plate away because I couldn't stop eating them! Love this place and can't wait to go back!"

My croque-madame (a ham and cheese sandwich with a fried egg on top, but it's really just so much more) was delicious, and the salad on the side was much heftier than what you'd expect to get in a similar US establishment. And the staff is mostly bilingual, which was very helpful. I'm thinking I might go back for a breakfast crepe tomorrow."

/user_details?userid=gSLQ-2A7b_d1JmXzN5jFzw,Jason K.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"- this place is rated really really high and am semi-surprised....- i love crepes, and it's typically tough to find a good place when you can't get yourself to france. the food was pretty good and well-priced, but the service was terrible. it wasn't really busy but it just seemed as if our server and the food runner/bus boy were on their first day on the job. (no water or menu until we asked for it, they messed up our order, etc)- food ordered** pourquoi pas (chicken, ham, swiss, mushroom sauce) - pretty darn tasty. i would totally recommend this one.** formidable (grilled beef, mushrooms, onions, swiss, red wine sauce) - this one came with the wrong sauce, and the server didnt notice. and neither did we. because of this, the crepe tasted very similar to the pourquoi pas.- don't think i'll be back.... sorry cafe."

/user_details?userid=jyQ7Wtx936CaklmHNo9dfg,Rahul S.,"Cupertino, CA",5 star rating,I had breakfast here on my recent visit to Montreal. My wife and I had breakfast and sweet Crepes they were all really delicious. The place doesn't stand out on the outside but the decor is very very nice inside. Service was very friendly and prices were reasonable ( $ 30 or so for 3 crepes and coffee). I would definitely come here on my next visit to Montreal.
