Their seafood chowder soup (I don't remember the real name) was simply perfect! It was a perfect combination of clams and spices. Just magnificent. Even though our group has arrived almost before the kitchen closed, the service we have received was top notch. Yes, definitely a perfect place for a date or dinner with friends. I put it on the list of restaurants that impressed me, so I would be back soon for sure."

My experience was an overwhelmingly positive one with a few minor hiccups and I'd gladly go back and try other items on the menu.I went with their Triple Motherfucker Burger because. .. why live to 40. It was huuûuuge stacked 3 patties so high my mouth simply couldn't put all in. It was good but lacked salt. I noticed there was no salt around which was a shame. I was so famished I couldn't be bothered to wait.It came with some side fries and spicy mayo and those were alright.For dessert we shared the Paris Brest and it was just ok.Their drinking menu is somewhat limited if you want a cocktail of sorts or hard liquor and their dessert menu was a little bland for me.Wait time was about average and the price tag higher than average setting me back about $30 for the burger, half a dessert and a soda drink.Despite those minor hiccups this place is full value and I had a great time. I recommend."
/user_details?userid=MDXqulpNz_WcAJd-mclwoA,Jackie S.,"Mont-Royal, Canada",4 star rating,"Love this small ""hole in the wall"" restaurant. Though it has a bit of a grungy feel the food and wine is absolutely fantastic. I have had a few things on their menu (including their amazing burger and calamari merguez sandwich) and I have yet to have a bad dish. Warning: it is fairly small so it may not be the best choice large groups. Also, I don't think they have AC which means on really hot summer days, it can be a little uncomfortable."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"I was playing my favourite ""Yelp App-venturing"" game last night, checking out a bunch of places that appear on Yelp but have no reviews, and hit gold at Mile-Ex. Tucked down near where Alexandraplatz is in the summer ie; in that industrial/residential zone between Jean Talon and Van Horne, Parc and St Laurent, where all those odd architectural condos have sprouted, on an otherwise entirely quiet residential block we found this tiny resto and two seats just waiting for us at the 4 person bar. There are only two other tables in the room, both communual, one seats about 16, the other about 10? At the bar you look over a tiny kitchen where tasty things happen spun by friendly Frenchmen. The menu is written down the chalkboard walls and the wine takes up more space than the food, which I respect. Everything on the menu foodwise is affordable - $10 - $15 generally, and playful. Squid roll? Motherf*ing Burger? I'll be back for that, meanwhile I wanted to bathe in my hot plate of clams calabrese, and my date enjoyed her unconventional Ceasar with it's tiny bites of cucumber. The wine we were offered was lovely, and the overall spirit was joyful. Also, the platter of mini chocolate mouse cups on a powdered sugar spelling of ""Mile-Ex"" as-birthday cake: pretty adorable."

/user_details?userid=dRXcvwCpgOz8MC1zlMxpcQ,Will H.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Delicious and adventuresome, with terrific service.  The squid roll with merguez sausage was unusual and delightful, with beautiful seasonings.  The nouveau calamari was also exceptional, perfectly charred yet tender with olive tapenade and a unique chili sauce.  Service from Charles was charming and informative."
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I came here with a friend yesterday. The menu is written on a chalkboard. We started with the ""accras crab"". I've only ever had accras de morue (cod) before and this tasted similar. It was tasty and it came spicy mayo. Then we were asked to move from our table to leave room for others and sit at the bar. We didn't mind. The owner/chef Paul Greg was really nice and was talking to us about the food he was preparing etc. We then had the ""ceci n'est pas une poutine""... very true.... it was nothing like poutine! It was basically pieces of cauliflower in a thick cheesy white sauce and a doughy ball in the middle. To me it was like tasting cheese fondue. Lastly, we tried the grilled calamari with hummus and squid ink. Having sat at the bar and watching the chefs make the burgers and the steak I wish we had ordered those instead. It looked so good but after those three dishes were so full!  I wouldn't mind going back and trying those. They don't have a cocktail menu but they do have a win list. My friend ordered wine all night and I had three bloody Caesars. If you like salty and very flavorful Caesars you will enjoy this one."

/user_details?userid=ikHTdbcQrKNVvnyetPvTIg,Monica N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"First off, the space is really cute and cozy. Their menu was written on one of their walls - a sort of, fresh from the market sort of menu. The waitress was kind enough to read us the entire menu in explicit detail as if we couldn't read ourselves. (I like to take it upon myself to pretend I am illiterate from time to time in the midst of my laziness so I did not mind this.) My boyfriend ordered l'onglet and I got the steak tartare. What bothered me about the service was that when my boyfriend ordered his steak, and he asked for his meat ""medium saignant"" (aka medium rare), the server did not seem to understand that was possible. She said his only options were either his steak cooked ""medium"" or ""saignant"" -- not ""medium saignant"". These two words stringed together in a sentence  apparently did not exist in this girl's restaurant vocabulary, just like unicorns and leprechauns do not exist in real life. Luckily, my boyfriend is understanding when he crosses the path of incompetence and just asked for whatever that wasn't going to be a blood fest on his plate. Otherwise, the food ruled, so did the wine (I forgot what we drank, ain't that how it should be?!) and we really felt at home at Mile Ex. Can't wait to go back. And hopefully that server will have learned a thing or two about steak preparations between now and next time."
/user_details?userid=HZoX29Baj4mCcCoqY7FZUg,Etienne L.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"This was probably my 10th visit at the Mile-Ex, so I think it was about time I give it a review. Overall, the place is small (in a good way), and the vibe is perfect for a dinner with friends or a date, with the 90s hip hop playing in the background of the conversations.This time around, I was there with a group of friends, to celebrate a birthday. It was a good thing we went on a Thursday, because since they don't take reservation, a larger group if often hard to sit at night.We asked the waiter to make us a menu for the table, and he happily obliged. We had a couple of classics I had in the past (accras de crabe, salade nuage au bleu, and the calamari) followed by the marrow bones, and the very huge tomahawk steak cooked to perfection. As usual the food was great. The 4 bottles of wine we had to go along with the meal were also all perfectly associated with all the food we were served.We finished the meal with a shot of bourbon offered to us by the chef/owner who stopped by our table and talked to us for a while about the early time of the restaurant, how he came up with the name, etc.Overall, as it was in the past, the Mile-Ex will always be my go to in Montreal when I want to have great food in a great vibe, without pretention. I highly recommend you try it if you haven't."
/user_details?userid=ucssLdHJmpo3lEyUtLi1Vg,Heather P.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Totally meh experience. Chefs are clearly well trained, dishes were well thought out and presented, but forgettable. We had the calamari with hummus and the pine smoked salmon. I can't believe others gave 4 or 5 stars... perhaps my expectations were too high because of that. Service was great."

/user_details?userid=1hT5oewKWdp-RsZL4J0UfQ,Sarah D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Young, feisty chefs are doing their thing cooking up experiments with unlikely combinations found no where else in Montreal. The spot is small and perfect. Found in a non descript part of town you have the feeling you're in on the best secret. The Motherfucking Burger is the most glorious motherfucker you want in your life, and your mouth. They also make spoum - a cousin of ice cream except better and lighter, made wth egg whites and not cream. Ask for the cannabis version because, why not... This one of the most surprising and atypical dining experiences I've had, period. If you like to play it safe, stay boring. This place is for the wild."
/user_details?userid=wLj1I8yQVEJUHMlEaPVZGA,Philip W.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"The juiciest burger I have ever had the pleasure of eating. My girlfriend had the single burger but I dared to eat the triple patty burger. The cheese, house made mayo, crispy bacon and super fresh vegetables made for an unbelievably delicious burger. The fries I did not even need as I couldn't have been happier with the lasting taste of the angus beef in my mouth!!"

/user_details?userid=zrxI4UP5BhuzX_5SsmzQEw,Beatrice L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Spontaneously decided to stop by for a drink, bite to eat, what have you on a gorgeous Saturday evening and had to wait for about 10 minutes but BOY was it worth it! The place was tiny, but buzzing with happy faces and excitement. The waiter (yes, a hipster with tattooes) was extremely friendly throughout, making our experience that much more enjoyable. We ordered a couple of beers (Baltika, a Russian brew, and what I was told is all they offer--their wine list is a lot more extensive, I noticed) which set the mood nicely for what was to come: the octopus with aubergines dish and then the calamari and pulled pork roll with a side of THE most delicious fries I have had in the city to date. And that is a bold statement considering how poutine-crazy Montreal is! ANYWAY, I left feeling delightfully tipsy, with a happy tummy to boot. Thank you, Mile-Ex, and to my friend for bringing me here! I'll be back soon."
/user_details?userid=iYcakOjAB3w-UOHrhwV2cw,Trace G.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This is as hipster as it gets! SERVICEI was on vacation and decided to come here after an exhausting afternoon hike at Mont-Royal. With the hike, we were exhausted and didn't realize that it was only 5pm when we arrived. Without realizing we had crashed on their staff dinner and set-up time, but despite this, the waitress and one of the chefs went out of their way to serve us right away. We felt so guilty, but not once did they make us feel uncomfortable and the waitress was so patient in explaining every dish to us in English.FOODYou MUST ORDER the calamari - it is their signature dish. I've never been a huge fan of calamari, but I loved every bite of the calamari we had here. The humus and squid ink perfectly complements the squid. Had this smoked salmon dish that came with mini pancakes (very cute) and a scoop of ice cream. I didn't think these three things came together, but they do. There's some sort of sauce that they make that goes with the salmon and all three together. It was quite fun eating this dish, trying to assemble the salmon and ice cream on each of my mini pancakes! I felt like a kid again and secretly eating something I shouldn't :)We had the special of the day appetizer - a honey dew + prosciutto mix, they complemented each other very well. It came with some sort of granola (?) crumbs that added a bit of saltiness that really brought out the flavour in the dish. For dessert, I had the chocolate lava cake. It was generous portion and was baked just right, but I didn't find it to be anything very special after all the amazing dishes that came before it. Don't get me wrong, it was very good and did come with a scoop of vanilla ice cream (made with real vanilla beans), but it's just a regular chocolate lava cake. Lastly, their food presentation was amazing throughout (food porn worthy) and I have the pictures to prove it. ATMOSPHEREThe decor is definitely hipster, but despite that there seems to have been a range of groups that came in for dinner. Old, young, couples, ladies catching up, group of boys at the start of a night out. It's a nice mix and never too loud in the restaurant as it is quite small and I think can probably seat no more than 20."
/user_details?userid=3gGo8mT2yozLprrIv9stEg,Talia F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I have eaten here four times and I've never had a bad bite. In fact every mouthful has been amazing. My favourite burger in town. A great place to go with a group of friends so you can get a few apps to share for the table - don't miss the grilled squid with hazelnut humous, the crab cakes, the deconstructed poutine. Huge portions so going with 4-5 people and sharing plates you still get a good size portion. The ingredients are always fresh, the menu changes for the apps but there are some staples. Great wine. The service is excellent: friendly, informed staff who know and love the food they serve. Very fairly priced for quality, quantity. Has been my favourite spot in town for a while now.  I tell everyone about this restaurant and have brought friends here a lot. I never hesitate to recommend this place. Mile Ex - don't go changing!"

Go with friends and share a lot of appetizers. We had Beet ravioli, grilled calamari with chestnut humus and squid ink crumble with lemon dressing, amazing crab cakes with spicy mayo and the this-is-not-a-poutine, poutine. So delicious. Also had a regular sized burger with fries and great wine."

When I arrived, surprise! they was nothing vegetarian on the menu. They insist to offer me seafood. Very disappointing.The place is cute, the food is ok - too greasy and salty for my taste - & reasonably priced, but I wouldn't return because I just felt like it was an hyped place."
