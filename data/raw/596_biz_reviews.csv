/user_details?userid=X_y7ie2wPylfH9McMcJULg,Joel J.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,Came here a year ago for my trip to Montreal and finally getting around to writing my review. So this was the first breakfast place we tried on our trip. Definitely a delight checking this place out. They had a good selection of delicious breakfast foods. I chose the salmon crepe with fruits and was happy with my decision. My friends got their omelettes which they seemed to enjoy as well. It was certainly a great way to start our trip and I would strongly recommend trying them out. The staff were wonderful. I had a lot of questions on places to visit and they were very helpful about giving us advice on places to visit which helped make our trip more fun and memorable.

I feel as tho it is their signature dIsh. I am not sure if they are South Koreans who run it or not but, I know from experience that they have mastered the perfect waffle since they have been a huge hit in SK for over 10 years now. You can see the young guys making everything at the bar. We noticed a bunch of locals enjoying their waffles and sharing them. It is a cute place and loved being able to people watch from their windows. It is clean and the staff friendly."
/user_details?userid=uy1KwAUiTN0LBmMtHt40sw,Gina D.,"Somerset, NJ",4 star rating,"Conveniently located, well decorated and clean. Server was very friendly and attentive. There really were only 2 people working, server and a cook, so I could see how things could get slow as some of the other reviews said. We went about 10:40 on a Tuesday so it was pretty quick. For only 2 people they turn out a pretty good breakfast.The food was great, waffles were some of the tastiest we have ever had. The fruit was very fresh and OMG, the chocolate sauce and hot chocolate shot with the Sugar rush hit the spot. The savory waffles were delicious. Portions were great for the price. Only downside was that the lattes and hot chocolate, though delicious were not hot."
/user_details?userid=pVNGGWaroaQ0MDHtBnmaHQ,Abir F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Really delicious and affordable breakfast spot. I ordered the veg omelette, my friend ordered the open bacon sandwich and we share a blueberry waffles.Everything was well cooked and the waffles were scrumptious.I was not a fan of the synthetic cheddar cheese they used in the omelette so next time, I would just go for the same order without the cheese.Good waffles though and very conveniently located"

/user_details?userid=vlQOx3rpDqr07l3Nzz5T0A,Eui-Hyun K.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"They were seriously understaffed the day I went. We stood there by the cash register for about 6-7 minutes before I could even order. Then a swarm of people lined up behind us because everyone realized that no waiter was available to come a wait on them. I'm still unsure if there normally a waitstaff to serve you. If there normally is, they were seriously lacking in staff. If there are no waiters normally, then maybe there should a sign that says ""order here"" above the register so people are not just waiting at their tables.Tables went unbussed and the food was slow to arrive. My waffle was cold and soggy and you could tell it had been sitting a while because the whipped cream lost its shape and was just a lump of half melted cream. Even if it came out warm, the quality of the waffles is just average...like a waffle at IHOP or Denny's.Maybe it was just a bad day, but this place definitely doesn't deserve 4 stars. It looks like it would be clean, charming, conveniently located (staff was friendly too)...but my dining experience was not so good."

Does that seem right?The menu is not very diverse and confusing.It's suppose to be a brunch place yet they don't carry just a simple bacon and egg combo.Everything is complicated and confusing!Was not flavourful or filling.Small portions.I bet if there was more staff they would be doing much better.Apparently on trip advisor it's rated a top restaurant to eat at..Don't trust it.Wouldn't ever come back here.Slow service!!!"

I like mine. It came with banana and strawberry. the marshmallow is just perfect. I had a bite of my husband's waffle. I think it was not crispy enough on the outside. Overall his waffle was only average. I like my s'more.Coffee was just OK, below average.The ambiance is great. I like the decoration."
/user_details?userid=p4t2dk7XQXVkm7f6RlBskg,Brandy B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We venured out for waffles one evening and ended up at Gauffre Mignonne. It is right off of the Saint-Laurent metro which was perfect for us using public transit. We were pleasantly pleased when we walked in. The young woman behind the counter was so very nice. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves as well. The waffles were huge, delicious, and filling. My latte was well made with a charming heart made in the foam. It was definately an experience and one that we will bring friends and family to enjoy. Loved it!"
/user_details?userid=wkXm63MheXiLAD-W3bSRdg,Bibi G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"One of my favorite breakfast/brunch place so far! I discovered this at first on Foodora, on a day I was very sick and wasn't expecting a food delivery to be good but I fell in love! Decided to go back with my boyfriend and we both agreed on coming back! First time we came in restaurant tho, I think morning shift's people were about to leave because we weren't really greeted... Then we waited a good 10-15 min before someone came to see us! Afterward the food came fast and the guy who replaced our server was reaaaally sweet! Anyway, the breakfast potatoes are to die for, the sausages are juicy and there is a good fruit portion. Fruits juice are really good and their coffee too!!!Must try!"
/user_details?userid=37AqJydkC0EZgprx9A3qzw,Raphael S.,"Lake Hiawatha, NJ",4 star rating,"Cute little cafe we found whilst walking to Chinatown. Family was really hungry. We ended up ordering pretty big things. Waiters were very welcoming and comforting. The waiter noticed that we were all filipino and he honed in too, I had my filipino radar as well, and he gave us good recommendations and advice on where to go next. I ended up getting the belgian waffles with maple syrup, bananas and blueberries. Very crunchy on the edges and smooth on the inside belgian waffles and the added sweetness and textures from the fruits and the maple syrup made every bite delightful. Had a great meal in Montréal. Looking forward to trying more things off their menu if I come back to Canada"

Very much enjoy the Apple cinnamon caramel crate Caramell latte was a little bit better but edit four packs of sugar in it it was OK! Also had a chance to try the small waffle it was amazing! What definitely come back here on a return visit
/user_details?userid=U2w9R3Esa_ylJjBHfHIFkA,Tess O.,"Pinecrest, FL",5 star rating,"Oh, my goodness. This could easily be the best breakfast I've ever had in my life. I ordered the Sugar Rush waffle which comes with caramelized bananas, chocolate swirl syrup, whipped cream, and a mini hot chocolate. I also had a side of eggs sunny side up, breakfast potatos, and bacon. My husband was horrified at the ferocity and speed at which I finished my meal. I thought I was going to eat him too if he tried to touch my food. It was just SO good. And the price was quite reasonable as well.Just go. I don't know what else to say. I want to eat here forever."

They are seriously understaffed - it took 15 minutes for them to get around to taking our order.  The omelette was the worst I've ever had, dry and smashed flat like a pancake. I have no idea why this place has so many good reviews."
/user_details?userid=Li_1wWizzfFEshtSlIKWrg,Anna B.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",2 star rating,Food was decent but my biggest complaint is that there are flys EVERYWHERE. I couldn't take a bite of my food without the fear of a fly flying into my mouth. Eventually i started to lose my appetite and felt nauseous the entire day. I complained to the staff and they said it's because theres a garbage can outside... also no air conditioning

/user_details?userid=ZuLsue5LTJv_8OD3xNIOPw,Kaitlin M.,"Seattle, WA",2 star rating,"Average food with disappointing service. There were no other people in the store, yet our food took ages - the staff clearly just didn't care. First of all, our drinks didn't arrive until after our food. We had to remind him to bring them. It was just iced coffee and tea (literally just hot water, come on). Instead of making drinks, the two workers were watching videos on their phones. The food came out very staggered, and I literally had to watch my food sit on the counter for ages and get cold before coming out. They were literally just being super lazy - there was no reason. Half the food came out 10 minutes before the rest.The food itself was fine, but nothing to write home about. My order came out incorrectly, but I wasn't going to ask them to fix it knowing how long it took them to make a simple waffle to begin with. I do not have the patience for that. My bacon was a bit burnt, but fine. It wasn't a satisfying meal by any means. Everyone I was with seemed ok with their food, but it definitely wasn't great. The only genuinely good thing was the potatoes. I was honestly so surprised - the reviews on here are so good, but our experience was so completely disappointing."
/user_details?userid=tQHDU3pFXBXmZARtoSvPoQ,Mel N.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Just stopped into Montreal for the day (business) and had big plans to go to Schwartz for dinner. But for lunch, I just wandered around looking for a cafe so I could have something light.This place has a lot of choices, but I settled on the Mango Pineapple Smoothie (which was DA bomb!) and the Vegetarian grilled sandwich (that bombed ).Look, I sort of blame myself because the menu said this Vegetarian had feta, lettuce and tomato, so I should have know better. Feta is NOT a sandwich-cheese, folks. It doesn't properly melt, it's tart, yadda yadda yadda. But I also blame the restaurant because it just tasted like ""a bunch of ingredients"" as my friend would so eloquently put it. Didn't taste any kind of sauce or spread on the bread... like, no butter, no mayo, no homemade sandwich sauce with a cool name like 'aioli'. It was bread, feta, lettuce and tomato.The blandness wasn't even the worst of it... they sent it to the table at some nuclear temperature, for some God-forsaken reason. I opened the sandwich and I could've had a facial with the amount of steam coming off the soggy bread and wilted vegetables.Ack. Come here for their delicious fruit smoothies. Or anything but the Nuclear-Bland-Soggy-Veggie-Sandwich.-"

We were expecting the food to be a little bit cold but it wasn't at all !!! The presentation was okay but I guess that's just because of transportation and doesn't really affect the taste of my food doesn't it!I recommend, next time I'll go in restaurant for sure!"
/user_details?userid=8Cy9FxJ_Hm8ddbAi6ck_3Q,Breck W.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,Perfect family brunch. Savoury and sweet waffles...AND S'MORES ARE ON THE MENU!! I resisted though. They also have yummy looking crepes and some classic sandwiches. Just all around a solid breakfast brunch with a little bit of a twist. Not very busy around 12-1 on a Sunday and good service.

The staff is so sweet, friendly, warm, and go above and beyond to make customers have a good experience. Even though we only ordered coffees, they treated us so well. Our coffees were good, strong, and beautifully presented. My friend ordered a crepe with butter and sugar, and loved it. I will definitely  come back here next time I'm in Montreal. Merci!"
/user_details?userid=ffavvc7caFrZLac0U69_-Q,Richard W.,"Vancouver, Canada",1 star rating,"Would not go back again. Ordered the crepe with turkey, cheese, and tomato and everything looked and tasted cheap. The turkey was clearly slices of turkey breast and the crepe was soggy and rubbery. Worst of all the staff forgot the tomato and still charged me for it. The only redeeming quality on the plate was the salad of fresh fruit. There's amazing things to eat in Montreal and lots in the area so I would certainly choose something better."

Usually you would expect good service from this, but we were sadly disappointed. Service was poor from start to finish, food was served up to 5 minutes apart, our drinks weren't served until we reminded the server that we ordered them (this was when our food arrived), and the two staff spent the majority of the time watching videos on their phone. Sadly, the food also didn't redeem this experience, my savoury waffle was nothing to write home about and one of my friends orders was delivered wrong. So this was a rather disappointing experience."

I can, tho, say about the service and lack of attention to up to date info + service.I walked my mother-in-law, who has a lot of trouble walking, and arrived before 5pm. As we walked in, someone came to us saying it was closed, and when prompted about the opening hours I had seen, I was answered simply with ""Supposedly"".Nice."

The place is a bit small and was pretty busy when we stopped by, but the turn around time is pretty quick and we didn't wait very long to be seated. Besides the food, the staff were amazing. They made our visit so enjoyable and were all just genuinely nice people. Would totally go back and would definitely recommend."

/user_details?userid=MFI1QiUcPy8iHro1n3erjQ,Bill T.,"Chicago, IL",2 star rating,"Went this morning with my wife. They were quite busy and it looked as if they were short staffed. The restaurant does not seem to have an exhaust system. So when you walk in, it is hazy and has a heavy smell from the cooking. I like to smell the food, I don't want to smell like the food. The staff that were working were really working hard, but they couldn't keep up. The place is popular with locals. Had a hash skillet. It was ok, but nothing special. Also ordered a regular coffee. It was one of the worst cups of coffee I think I've ever had. Had two sips of it and left the rest. Maybe I just got very unlucky with going on a day when they were short staffed, but I'd recommend skipping this place just because of the coffee and situation with their exhaust system. Neither of those things are influenced by being short staffed, but if you are making breakfast you have to have those things right."

It back to correct the order but did at the end ... very little English  I mean I understand that it's a French speaking City but if you have a restaurant in the heart of tourist area your servers hostess should have good English also very small  a big crowd of people came in after we were seated and we were basically felt like we were in a sardine can. :)"

We were lucky to see this place and eat here!Great food, and a great price. I paid around $8 for a crepe with nutella and fruit (strawberries+blueberries) and my sister paid close to the same for a very tasty waffle with fruit and real maple syrup. I found the crepe to be a little soft, but my sister loved it - I think the waffle was awesome :)The inside is very cute, and the selection on the menu is fantastic. I ordered a iced cappuccino as well but was disappointed - I was expecting a slushie like texture but it was basically iced coffee with whipped cream. Still very good, I just made an unfortunate assumption. They could also use a bathroom update - the tap sprays a bit, and the soap+paper towels were empty.The only real issue I had with this place is that the service was slow - we waited about 15 minutes to order after we had stopped looking at the menu, and there are only about 6 tables in the place (and only when I went up to the counter to ask about ordering).Additionally, I had almost finished my crepe when I finally got my cappuccino. The waters even took a long time to come. However, the food itself only took about 15-20 mins once ordered and it was delicious so we ate quickly! All in all, a great place, absolutely worth the price, and in a great location. The staff are friendly, although a little disorganized. I will definitely be back and will modify my review if the service is better."
