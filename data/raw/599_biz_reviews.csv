My girlfriend is unhealthily obsessed with Indian food so we ran through a good 20 spots over a two year period & this the one we keep coming back for. Added bonus their take out portions are huge. Ignore the fact they got the random Italian menu"
/user_details?userid=yiqgImyEVB4FaKVP2Z4Z0g,Eric B.,"Apopka, FL",5 star rating,"What a delicious meal we got. First time here. We ordered and picked up some awesome Indian food.Ordered some combos for a family meal. Samosas, butter chicken, fresh naan bread etc...We were so hungry I even forgot to take pictures. You'll have to trust me when I say, this was oh so delicious!!We ordered for take out, and it was ready lickety split. Rushed home and the family devoured the entire dishes in a lickety split record time. Btw the kids love it too! I think my favorite was by far that butter chicken. Oh, and that freshly tandoori oven made naan bread was to die for!Yes and yes, we'll be back!"
/user_details?userid=7PTwhPEM7VWclYIS_1dSiw,Jéssica C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Ok so this restaurant is a bit bipolar, and I can't say anything on the italian side but let me tell you about the best indian dish you'll ever have. If you come here, do yourself a favor and get the ultimate indian comfort food- butter chicken! The sauce is so creamy and flavourful it's insane, and the naan bread is so fresh, you will NOT regret it! Seriously one of my top things to eat in general.If you're feeling lazy, they also deliver and they're in most delivery apps. The dish costs 18$ and it comes with rice and naan bread. I normally ask them to change the rice for more naan bread but thats just me.My boyfriend was feeling more adventurous and got the taste platter with a few different things. That one was 23$."
/user_details?userid=xZCVxM7KS49Jj2F_CiiRmA,A. R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Went here for a family birthday dinner since this place is a longtime favorite of my relatives. Loved not being limited to a single cuisine - tried the Indian tasting plate from the table d'hôte and was really impressed. The quality was a notch above your usual Indian resto - the carrot ginger soup was creamy but not heavy, with tons of flavor. The naan bread was the best I've had in years - fresh, crispy and perfectly charred. The lamb vindaloo was not so spicy (slight disappointment, I love having my tastebuds knocked outta my mouth) but surprisingly the chef's choice veggie (zucchini) had the perfect amount of zing to it. The channa masala contained the creamiest garbanzo beans ever, I could live on this stuff. My family was raving about the veal parmigiana and the pasta looked and smelled pretty delish. The service was great on the night I went, waitress was really friendly and attentive. I'd go back here for sure, especially for a group dinner - the extra variety of choices makes it a great option and they're set up to accommodate big tables. Confession: enjoying Sandhu leftovers as I write this, wishing I hadn't been such a pig the night of ;)"
/user_details?userid=PPb3gYwKXB03AiRSm1HLkw,Adam W.,"Mesa, AZ",4 star rating,"This review is for the Indian food. I ordered take-away so I can't comment on the service, but I will say that the person that took my order was friendly and the food was ready extremely quickly. The butter chicken and chicken tikka masala were both delicious and had large chucks of tasty and tender chicken. The butter chicken wasn't spicy at all and the chicken tikka I'd say was mild in terms of spice. I also like the fact that each main order comes with both naan and rice included, so factor that in when looking at the prices.The samosa's were a little too spicy for both me and my wife so I'd avoid them if you don't like spicy food. Overall I really liked the food and would definitely order from here again. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the samosa's were a bit spicy, and this restaurant seems to have a bit of an identity crisis since it also serves Italian food."

/user_details?userid=QYC3HlU2lVeocJSU_UP73A,Alex Catherine L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I only tried indian food here and usually get it as take out. I never had anything bad to say about the food nor the service. They forgot an order of samosa one time and rushed back with extra ones as compensation. It's not the best indian food in town but I really enjoy it everytime and would come back again and again.
/user_details?userid=BWDiUGrvwC41pbkkduDQDQ,Amanda S.,"Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Food is good and service friendly but the setup of the restaurant can make it very cramped to get in and out of. We arrived when it wasn't so busy, but when we went to leave it was crowded and hard to squeeze by the chairs. I am visually impaired so this was very difficult. Just be aware of that if you have mobility problems not to get seated down by the window. Also every time I have been there it has been very loud so not a good place if you want a quiet romantic dinner."
/user_details?userid=syinOAXKYb-CWepWWS13gA,George K.,"Middletown, CT",4 star rating,Family of 6 adults with different likes but we all found something good.  5 out 6 meals were wonderful. The pizza meal was ok.  The India curry dish was great.  Steaks very good. Fair price. We only speak English and they only speak French but all worked out well. Nice staff.
/user_details?userid=wNgCoH8qlfTxAV_z11wGYQ,Adam V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I ate the filet mignon Poutine and the chicken curry pizza. The Poutine was the best Poutine I have ever eaten... It was absolutely delicious. Definitely pricey but worth it. The chicken curry pizza was very good as well. It had fresh tomatoes and cilantro on it. It was really a nice cross off Italian and Indian food. I believe the crust was probably homemade as well. This resto is slightly over priced but worth a treat once in awhile.
/user_details?userid=xn56PSAS3IgtjHPYAUxNIA,M B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Good food. We (used to) order for delivery weekly. The first time we ordered the $15 Butter Chicken dish we received a large bowl of sauce with 6 or 7 small cubes of chicken. Disappointing! We gave Sandhu the benefit of the doubt and a few months later, with guests for dinner, ordered the Butter Chicken again and got the same bowl of sauce with hardly any chicken. Hey Sandhu, I can buy an entire BBQ chicken for less than $10. Before turning to Yelp to whine about my first world problems, I wrote a polite email to Sandhu about this issue but have received no reply. Recap: Really good food, very stingy quantities of Butter Chicken. I'm tempted to give only 2 stars for their lack of response to my email but I'm correcting for my overall grumpiness this morning."
/user_details?userid=90fyHymYCrcnfsAn7CDGXw,Stefanie R.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Great food and selection. Yes, it's odd to have an Italian and Indian in one place. However, neither disappointed. Only three stars as service could be better."

/user_details?userid=eBFIGJ0-OImK8Govr8B5nA,Hani N.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I placed an order online, paid in full including 15% tips only to be completely disappointed.  The order was never delivered. I waited more than an hour and 16 mins at which time I gave up and called to cancel. It was my first time but now after this bad  experience,  I have decided to take my business elsewhere."
/user_details?userid=7kGxOoefe5H-HMxKIS9QrQ,Ahmad H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Sandhu is situated on Papineau and Mont-Royal just to the right of La Tulipe. This neighborhood has a very busy nightlife with restaurants, bars, cabarets and nightclubs scattered all around the place. Sandhu is not expensive at all (surely if you compare it to other Italian restaurants in general and other restaurants in Plateau-Mont Royal area in particular). It is the BEST value for money restaurant in the whole Plateau-Mont Royal neighborhood. It isn't a BYOB restaurant but we didn't order wine and ended up paying around $50 for two persons (entree, main dish and dessert for one with two spoons :-) tips and taxes included)The front facade of this restaurant is all glass so I'd recommend getting a table near it. It's basically if you were eating on a side-walk but were isolated from all the noise, dust and exhaust emissions. Their dining-hall is pretty big and you don't get the crampy feeling that you get in most of these Plateau restaurants (real-estate is at a premium in this area).Our waitress was very nice and cheerful and the service in general was very efficient. I chose a soup as entree while my friend went for their hot garlic bread with cheese. For the main course I went for stuffed veal escalope with sauteed vegetables while my friend ordered a 4-fromaggi pizza. Both of these items were very delicious. The pizza was of a very good size and my veal portion was huge. With all our soup and garlic bread entree already inside us, we weren't able to finish the main course.For dessert, there was Tiramisu which was excellent and then espresso to finish the dinner.I was pleasantly surprised to see the bill which was below my expectations for what we had ordered (this resulted in a hefty tip for the waitress hehe). A very good experience. If you're in the neighborhood give this restaurant a try, you won't be disappointed (don't forget to make a reservation though)."
/user_details?userid=jjJYTGWJ71ljU3FW8dm5QA,A W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"To be honest we were looking for a specific type of pizza and this restaurant had it! We ordered the Mélanzane Pizza  (Sauce​ tomate, fromage, aubergines grillées, ail, ricotta et piments rouges piquants) and requested only ricotta cheese to keep it light.  Sandhu kindly accommodated the modification and the delivery was fast. The banana peppers gave the flavors a nice heat. The dough is very good and probably to most people's taste though we'd prefer thinner crust if we had that option. Oh, and fantastic tiramisu !"
/user_details?userid=-badcmkbnMck7doUdGAZ0g,Andrew M.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I just had the misfortune of ingesting what this place considers Indian food. Ugh.Judging from other reviews, it seems we caught them on an off night, or maybe ordering for delivery is just not their forte. On top of having to wait for over an hour to get our food, what I received was an oily, wet mess. The madras was more like boiled chicken in a coconutty soup, the vindaloo was bland and mostly sauce and the veggies mushy and unappetizing.The worst, by far, was the naan, which was wet and clearly undercooked.After the first taste of the food, I ended up eating only the pakoras, the only halfway decent food of the bunch.All to say, a waste of just over $50 (not the kind of price one wants to pay for this mess).I'd say skip this one if you're ordering in. Maybe they're only good to dine-in."
