I absolutely recommend this for your chilly evenings coming our way"
/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here twice in 2 weeks and although I preferred it the first time, It's an excellent upscale restaurant that is very unique when compared to other places in Montreal. The first time I came here was with a bunch of girlfriends for a birthday. The staff are super nice and helpful, taking the time to explain the menu options and answer questions. I ordered the Sukisa (Braised goat over a purée of manioc and plantains) the first time and liked it so much that I ordered it again the next time. Both times tasted delicious but the cut of meat the second time wasn't as good as the first. The portion size was reduced and the bulk of the plate was bone unfortunately. Other than that, the flavours were delicious. All of their dishes are well seasoned and mild in spice level to please the majority. I love spicy food so they happily offered some homemade hot pepper sauce which was greatly appreciated. The second time, I also tried the Le Virunga salad which was presented beautifully. It was so yummy. I also shared another main but I honestly don't remember what it was. It tasted good though! Again, beautiful presentation.The restaurant itself is small, cozy and very tastefully decorated. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and it was perfect for an occasion with friends or a date night. Prices are relatively high (around 27-28$ for the mains for portions on the smaller side depending on the dish) but worth it for the incredible flavour combinations. Looking forward to coming back!"

The lady there took time to explain the food to us and made us feel so cozy and welcomed.Highly recommended, and had been raving about it to my family and friends."
/user_details?userid=4CA-qAu_Pbyn84JcNZnN-g,Samantha G.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"For my most recent trip to Montreal, I desired to branch out and try different cuisines instead of just Quebecois cuisine. As a surprise, my SO made reservations at Le Virunga to celebrate the eve of my birthday.Le Virunga features flavors typical to Sub-Saharan Africa such as nutmeg, saffron, potatoes, and plantains to name a few.We started off with La Virunga's version of poutine: A duo of plantain & manioc fries topped with smoked cheese, goat cheese, shredded chicken, bacon and stir-fried vegetables smothered in chicken gravy. The size of this appetizer is perfect for sharing. I enjoyed the slight sweetness you get from the plantain fries while the gravy and cheeses added savory and rich flavors. The gravy was delicious where you want to sop up every bit with the fries.Once we finished the poutine, our entrees were presented. I picked the pan fried Australian lamb with curry & Grand Marnier with ablo (rice bread) and Tanzanian peas. The lamb was prepared nicely and I love the curry sauce it came with.The other entree my SO picked out was the New Zealand goat leg roasted with African nutmeg and green anise from Cameroon, roasted market vegetables and Jerusalem artichoke lituma (plantain balls). This dish had so many interesting flavors and the meat just fell apart. If I had to choose which entree was better, which was hard as both were tasty, I would say the goat leg was since I found the flavors to pop more than the lamb.Before our night ended, our server surprised me with a candle-lit plate with plantain donuts topped with ice cream. Of course, one cannot go wrong with anything fried and topped with ice cream. ;)The ambiance of La Virunga was perfect: Intimate and cozy, yet hip. I enjoyed the staff and they were very helpful in helping us go through the menu.Would I return to La Virunga? Without hesitation, I would love to visit & enjoy another meal here."

/user_details?userid=yRB4UrgnLs3BxbVM1QQ0Gw,Sababa S.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This was my first time trying African food, the flavours were amazing. The service was great. I had the chicken dish, the sauce was delicious. The chicken was tender and juicy. I tasted a bit of the lamb dish from my friend, it also tasted great. The rice cakes were great. They also serve a hot sauce which enriches the flavours even more.For appetizers, I had the fish with eggplant sauce. It was delicious. I also had the shrimp with coconut sauce, it was also delicious. I liked it better than the fish with eggplant sauce."

/user_details?userid=WtmmtVkui7AjVIZvnqQHwg,Rosie B.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"TLDR: Lip-smacking food and fabulous honest service.We went to Le Virunga in the beginning of May looking to try a new and exciting cuisine, and that it exactly what was delivered. Le Virunga is a fusion of different African flavours that work well and deliver mouthwatering dishes. There is a reason why they made it on Eater's 38  Essential Montreal Restaurants for Spring 2017.Despite Zoya training a new waitress, we received premium service and attention. Zoya was extremely knowledgeable and helped us better understand the dishes so we could select the ones we would most enjoy. Moreover, she easily directed us to the best wine pairing for our meal.While we waited for the food, we were brought some spiced nuts and paper thin plantain chips to munch on. They were so tasty that we asked for more and they sweetly obliged us.For the appetisers, my mother and I shared the poutine and it was more than enough for the two of us just as Zoya informed us. The poutine was tasty with the different cuts of starches such as potato and cassava. It was topped with yummy chunks of goat and succulent au jus gravy. The mushrooms dispersed throughout the bowl was extremely enjoyable. The poutine was topped with white cheese that provided great brightness to the overall dish. In my opinion, the bacon was unnecessary, but I know most would disagree with me. My father enjoyed a soup that brought a smile to his face. I wish I recalled what he ate, but it involved seafood and I didn't try it as I do not enjoy anything that comes from a body of water.For the mains, my father ordered the Congolese fish stew that I was told was yummy. My mother got the lamb which arrived with steamed sweet rice flour bread, and I the goat which was paired with steamed cassava bread. Whenever given the option, I will always go with goat dishes as it's not an easy meat to cook or find in restaurants. The lamb melted in your mouth and was soul-satisfying. The goat fell off the bone and was sublime. The juicy well-balanced flavours danced in our mouths. I enjoyed both buns thoroughly as my mother and I traded one of each. They soaked up the juices of the dish wonderfully and left us all quite satisfied.The desserts were out of this world. Fluffy Plantain doughnuts and a chocolate mousse sitting in a coconut tuile bowl. The doughnuts were exquisite and light, not heavy at all. I still crave those doughnuts at least once a week. The mousse was velvety and indulgent, and the tuile had the perfect snap to it. They brought us the desserts together with a candle as it was my birthday.The decor is fun and vibrant, and the atmosphere of le Virunga is addictive. I'm excited to check out their summer menu, which I am certain will be just as sensational as their spring menu."

This place made me.Virunga is why we get off our arses, dress up, open our wallets and eat out. Exquisite tastes, exquisite textures. Oxtail so tender I dispensed with all propriety and took it in hand...no way I was not gonna suck the best bone out there! Little details: real cloth hand towels in bathroom. Polite table service.  African music playing at a volume permitting conversation. South African wines. Hosts take your coat and hang it up (it's winter). If the food were bad, none of this would matter. But since the food is so good, I appreciate the extras."
/user_details?userid=_AKf0jab-DI0xGQDiWjf-g,Myriam A.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",5 star rating,"We had a beautiful experience at Le Virunga. I've been dying to try that place for quite some time and God... I wasn't disappointed. The atmosphere is very cosy with a nice selection of African music. The service was EXCELLENT.  And as for the food.... as an African girl this is not the place where you will find traditional African dishes... but!!! the flavors were as authentic as traditional dishes you can come across in Congo, Ivory Coast or Togo... The mix of flavors and ingredients was made in heaven. So for me le Virunga's African fusion concept  is a complete win. (I will not mention their hot sauce, it was authentic, flavoured and hot as it should.)Highly recommend and will definitely return."

But I gradually stopped listening when the food was in front of my face lol it looked to good!  They put so much thought into every single detail and the chef (Maria) gives her take on the tradition dishes she grew up on and presents everything in such a sophisticated way! Honestly, Great service ! Awesome people! Amazing food!"
/user_details?userid=xyGhfpca_EHeHPac-pP7UA,Theresa D.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"This was a wonderful find! Unique food -- different from other African restaurants I've tried (Moroccan, Ethiopian, South African, etc.) I had the duck with ginger, eggplants, and red peppers in a creamy sauce that wasn't spicy, but spiced and super delicious. The wine selection was fantastic. The customer service was also great -- our flight to Montreal was delayed and it was hard finding a place open at 9:30pm on a Tuesday and we were turned away from two other restaurants on the same block that looked to be open. Le Virunga sat us right away and never rushed us. We weren't even the last people seated. Loved the vibrant but quiet ambiance. Would definitely return next time I'm in town."
/user_details?userid=Mp_5yg9GNbBT1zRf3_HYLQ,Justene A.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Sooooo delicious! Like many people I wanted to venture out and try a new cuisine. We went on Valentine's Day. The restaurant offered a special menu with a wine pairing ($80pp with the wine $49 without). The meal did not disappoint. Listen, everything was delicious and well prepared. The spices permeated throughout the restaurant. The servers were attentive. Be prepared to wait a bit for your meal (perhaps because it was a special menu) because there are only two servers for the entire restaurant. I wish I took more pictures of the food, but i was too busy devouring. Also, an artist came and sang some love songs. The space is quite intimate and it worked well. Most definitely will return."
/user_details?userid=XK5NeMRDrwqSa9XQIWyskA,Yacine M. D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Cozy yet high end feel in the midst of African decor and sounds. Perfect place to have an intimate convo while enjoying some unique flavours. Plantain Poutine, mango avocado papaya shrimp salad, beans and red pepper in peanut sauce ( with some okra incorporates here and there ) and other interesting menu items will surely make you want to try everything they offer. Lets not forget about their drinks - traditional African drinks like Bissap ( Hubiscus juice ) and ginger beer ( alcoholic and non alcoholic) as well as other refreshing combinations!As a vegan, I didn't even mind that they only had technically one vegan item and I look forward to going back to challenge them to veganize other dishes.A place to try if you want to escape and discover."

The ambiance, service, and mostly the flavorful dishes made for an unforgettable experience! We travel quite often and this is by far one of the restaurants we would go back to if we are back in Montreal! My husband and I ordered 2 appetizers and 2 main dishes and ate everything!! The beef skewers, plantain pouting, the goat, and the fish of the day were amazing! Not many restaurants serve goat and it was definitely perfected. We were celebrating my husband's birthday and they unexpectedly brought out a candle and a dessert for us to celebrate!"
/user_details?userid=liWSFmLu5Y-tf5yUy9x0lQ,Hooman G.,"Cornwall, Canada",3 star rating,"Small restaurant with a nice atmosphere. We enjoyed the goat main dish and Serengeti appetizer (spiced vegetables with cassava couscous). We found the bean soup a little weak in flavor and content. The lentil stew main dish was too small of a portion for a $23 dish and flavor was just OK. Service was attentive and friendly. Overall, we enjoyed the experience, but leaving only 3 stars because of the high price tag. The above with one drink each and nothing else cost $120 including tax and tip. Neither the food nor the dining room justifies such a price tag. I would say that meal was worth $80 max."
/user_details?userid=oYdKZzgj1z3NHnJo1Y0jdw,Kat P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The food was seriously good! I organized a group dinner so we had to take the table d'hôte. There wasn't a lot of choice but everyone found something they liked. Out of the 14 people from the group, no one was disappointed. A plus: the cocktails are great! It was pretty quiet that night so the waitress was always available which was nice. However, she was sometimes overwhelmed. Nevertheless, it's a really nice place to bring a date or a group!"

The music and decor were fun and exciting. The service was incredible. It's a female owned restaurant and you can tell the owners are passionate about African food. I highly recommend the lamb and plantain donuts for dessert. All the flavors and textures worked perfectly together. The sauces are so flavorful and take each dish to the next level. By far the best meal I had in Montreal!"

Had no expectations and this place blew us away.  Food was delicious, cozy atmosphere, the hot sauce was to die for and the host/owner was exceptional. We had the lamb and goat stews which were flavorful and fell off the bone. They even took special notice and care with my peanut allergy. Highly recommend it!"
/user_details?userid=nQpvbghkVpvDBLXR83YiCA,S O.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"Our group spent seven days in Quebec City and Montreal, and this was by far our favorite meal. We started with an African take on poutine, which was savory and rich in flavor. For the entrees, we especially enjoyed the goat and lamb curry dishes, which were so tender and flavorful. We were stuffed after dinner but the menu was so compelling that we still ordered two desserts. The plantain donuts did not disappoint. On top of the great cuisine, the music, decor and service all add up to a great experience. Highly, highly recommend!"

The meat was tender and the sauces delicious. The menu seems to be dishes inspired by various African traditional meals with authentic ingredients with some that are given a creative fusion twist. Service and ambience were both top notch. Great wine list as well of South African wines. It was a memorable meal."

The presentation of the dishes, the flavors and combinations of authentic herbs and ingredients makes this restaurant and authentic jewel of Montreal. The meat was perfection.

/user_details?userid=AWTH1RYrtGbXxhJc6CeO2w,Maryna L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Finally tried this place after biking past numerous times. Worth a visit! African fusion: interesting flavors and very accommodating service. Menu has few choices listed, but everything we tried was delicious. I had the goat stew - spicy and rich. Also tasted a bite of the nut-crusted fish which was really nice. No vegetarian option is listed on the menu, but the kitchen made up a special plate, that got rave reviews from vegetarian diner. They will also prepare takeout, but the interior has a relaxed atmosphere and great music."
