/user_details?userid=c4lTZbA8NeZBgB1YYB6Izg,Julie C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Can't believe I haven't written a review for Kazu already!I love this little spot and I'm so glad they finally moved to a (slightly) larger space. The decor in the new spot is chic but it still has the cozy/authentic Japanese vibe as they did at their old location. My favourite item on the menu personally is the salmon and tuna bowl (and you can request for them to come without rice and more veggies, which is what I often do). I've also purchased the two sauces for their salmon and tuna bowl and tried making it at home (didn't taste as good but it was still really great) and I love using the dressing for other salads as well. I don't often come here for lunch but when I do, I also love their ramen and the 24hour pork bowl with the curry sauce. Overall very satisfying for the $ you're paying. Great value, great portions, great service but it's always crowded and you most likely have to wait in line. I try to avoid this place in the winter as I don't think any food is worth waiting in line in a Montréal winter..haha! (And you will 9/10 times have to wait for an average of 10-20 minutes outside during peak hours)."

Enter Kazu, what an amazing dinner even delivered. Everything was so excellent, especially for delivery. We ate to much because it was too good to stop. Lol. Enjoy!"
/user_details?userid=LlMfTEapbG0ikzdoqA8oGQ,Alexia B.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"The closest I've ever been to Japan in Montréal.The restaurant just moved down the street from its original location, which means more seating and you can wait for a table inside during the cold Montréal winters. I had a yuzu beer and really enjoyed it. If you're not a fan of sour lemonade I wouldn't recommend the yuzu beer but there are other interesting beer options. The portion of a lunch ramen is HUGE! It was so layered with flavor and extremely filling. If you're in the area around lunchtime you've got to try it. The seating is tight so prepare to be a little squished and ready to do some apologizing as you make your way bumping others to and from your table. But hey, from what I hear it's pretty crowded in Tokyo so try to enjoy the squished experience. I hope to return to this restaurant to try all of the other interesting items they have on the menu!"
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",3 star rating,"I've heard nothing but rave reviews for this place. The ligns to get in are always insanely long. So why the 3 star review? I think it's because I ordered wrong. I got the tuna and salmon tartare bowl and it was delicious, I really enjoyed it, but it didn't taste out of this world amazing. It wasn't ''I would wait 2 hours in line to eat this'' delicious. My friend and I were lucky, we went for dinner on a sunday night and didn't wait long to be seated.I also got the tofu entree to share with my friend and it was waaaaaay too salty. We couldn't even finish it. For dessert, I loved seeing all of  their ice cream varieties (Ginger, Wasabi! Matcha) But the base is vanilla and they just add toppings to it. Tasted quite ordinary. But that's because I got the chocolate and not one of their crazier ice cream flavours. I will give this place another try because I really do want to like it. If you have any recommendations of what to get here, feel free to send some my way!"
/user_details?userid=qfCHqKbLR48haYCM3As_AQ,Alex F.,"Ahuntsic-Cartierville, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Coming to Kazu does not mean a long, quiet supper. There is almost always a lineup in front of the restaurant. We sometimes wait 30 minutes to eat in 20, but it's always worth it. The food is delicious and the kitchen/staff is efficient. They recently moved into their new location on Ste-Catherine and it has the same vibe and feel of the old place. I highly recommend that you eat at the bar so you can watch the magic happen behind the counters with the owner and the sous-chefs. It is always a pleasure for me to visit this place."
/user_details?userid=0ZQMbnBUpuMpf1_DiT3HyQ,Phil S.,"Saint-Hubert, Canada",5 star rating,Lovely staff - plates are simple but well prepared and always on point. Great energy. Worth the wait every time. Small and intimate great if you're alone or a couple. Best Japanese table in mtl for that price.
/user_details?userid=7FoE5PH5CV6I6ZEfxVG5rg,Kobsupang R.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"When I knew I was going to Montreal, I did a full research on where to eat and thanks to Instagram because I'd seen SO MANY great photos of the food here and people were raving about it. After being so jet legged, all I wanted was just some good food. After a much needed nap, we took an Uber from our hotel straight to Kazu. By the way, how to find this restaurant is easy, you see a long line outside of a restaurant and that's when you know you have come to the right place. People were literally waiting in the cold. Well, that didn't scare me away. I joined those guys proudly. Maybe 25 or 30 mins or so, we finally made it in (after creepily watching people enjoying their meals through the windows, haha). My husband ordered ""48 hours pork bowl"". A bowl of rice topped with sliced pork simmered in soy sauce in a mildly sweet sauce which OMG, it was SO good even though I only tried a little, but I could already tell that it was really really tasty! I ordered Shrimp burger (made from fresh black tigers from the Atlantic Ocean) for myself and it was so good I almost cried. Seriously though, my pictures didn't even do the food's justice. Huge shout-out to their staff for being super friendly and helpful. I told them it was our first time eating at Kazu and everyone was more than happy to recommend some food for us. I honestly wished I had been able to eat more because I kept seeing nice looking food being served left and right. Last but not least, I ordered ""Home made soft ice cream (No egg, no cream used)with brioche chocolate"" and I was so glad I took our waitress' advice! (I wish I could remember her name since she was so awesome!) P.S. Kazu is closed Tuesday and Wednesday, guys. Don't be like me just showing up and having to read about their business hours through the windows. :-/"
/user_details?userid=WXOPvu53iSgej-w_0tnbSg,Grace Y.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I came for lunch and really enjoyed it here! It's a hole in the wall, super cramped, and there's usually a wait, but it's not too bad of a wait and the staff are nice. I got the veggie bowl after the waitress told me that just about every other food item had garlic or onion and I am intolerant, but I was delightfully surprised at how good it was! My boyfriend got the short ribs and it was large and the meat was super soft and flavorful. The prices are also super reasonable. We spent $30-40 for two people."
/user_details?userid=RX9MH2jHaK90KF-2rU9Mvg,Selena C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Okay, so this was highly recommended to visit by a friend and it did not disappoint. This is definitely a local gem and not a super hyped up place. We came here for lunch during the summer and it was pretty packed. We ordered the shrimp burger, the salmon and tuna bowl, and the eel dish (i forgot the name?). Everything was delicious. Even though they were quite busy, they still took the time to explain the dishes we had questions about since it was our first time there. It seems to be mostly populated by students (i guess they were taking summer courses at the university near by)? It can be easy to miss if you're walking down the street since there are so many other restaurants within close proximity but this is definitely a place you should give a try! It has great vibes and great food!"
/user_details?userid=wDamAp66aGhJoQ-wFmWZ6Q,Calvin Z.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"I love this place. I'll admit, I wasn't too convinced at first when I walked in. Tiny restaurant, simple decor, hole-in-the-wall vibe, but it had a line. That had to mean good things. We were sat at a table by the wall, which was in the way of the servers walking between the kitchen and dining area. Again, small restaurant.I ordered the ramen for lunch, because I just wanted noodles. I wasn't really expecting any amazing ramen from a non-ramen restaurant. I just wanted something warm and soupy. When I took my first sip of the broth, all my initial impressions melted away. They didn't matter. It was really good. It was rich, flavourful, and warmed my soul, and the noodles had plenty of bite to them. The chefs in the kitchen knew what they were doing. My girlfriend ordered the short rib, which came in a massive plate and looked intimidating, but was actually a reasonably sized portion. Also chock full of flavour, and was incredibly tender.I guess at the end of the day, the food is what's important. If I lived in Montreal full time, I'd probably come here weekly."
/user_details?userid=xZz56LNb1L1HUt2qb7rRBA,Roseanne N.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"It was a really busy restaurant. The restaurant was quite small, so it was difficult to get a seat.  While waiting in line, they gave us a menu to prime ourselves for what was to come. Eventually they welcomed us in and showed us to our table. I already knew what I was going to order. Yes, it was the tuna and salmon bowl. I heard so much about the dish that I had to try it. We also got the okonomiyaki, shrimp burger, and yakitori. Everything was presented so beautifully. I was so amazed by the portion sizes of the dishes as well. First off, the yakitori had a nice char and this enhanced its flavour profile. I was at first, confused of how to eat this salmon bowl as it was layered with some sort of crunchy rice cracker strands. I treated it as a regular poke bowl and mixed everything up. I have to say, the dressing was really savoury and nice. It made the bowl really refreshing. The okonomiyaki was also flavourful. It was topped with bonito flakes and sauce. I found the pancake really tender as well. The shrimp burger was just loaded with sauce. The burger was crunchy, while the meat was fresh and bouncy. I really loved the food here and would definitely recommend trying this place out!"
/user_details?userid=ElFJieKozbuAeElS8ZJLNA,Kristina D.,"San Jose, CA",4 star rating,"I found this place on yelp and it's true about the line up. My fiancé and I got lucky and we only waited 5-10 mins. We ordered #25 & #28.I personally loved the sauce and sashimi more on #25. The bowl one (#28) was pretty good, typically everyone else's favourite.I have yet to try their meat dishes. Looking forward to next time."
/user_details?userid=si99SgWBLfk0WX3dZJhWlA,Jamie F.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"Kazu is a destination restaurant in Montreal. You know it's beyond popular when we arrived 30 minutes prior to opening on a Sunday, and one party still beat us to first in line!Service and food were quick as expected, in order to turn over tables quickly. Because the restaurant was tiny and space was tight, recommend going in pairs. We were a party of 3 and barely had enough table space for all of our orders.We really wanted to order the pork neck, but it was sold out already! We did enjoy the chicken skewers, shrimp burger, fall-off-the-bone beef short rib over mashed potatoes, 48-hour pork with side of curry, and bibimbap (just wish it was served in a hot stone pot though). Every dish hit all the marks: flavorful, good texture, fragrant, and fresh. PS. Don't miss some of the specials listed on the wall, i.e. tuna belly, oysters, octopus, etc.Even though we were so full (to the point of unbuttoning my pants), I'm glad that we tried the desserts, which were small anyway. The green tea panna cotta and the black tea ice cream were the perfect ending to our meal."
/user_details?userid=4ayVX0YKY3GSP2IICpLJXQ,Priscilla Y.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"Teeny place that is really popular and extremely crowded with over priced and only okay food... I liked how many of their dishes were a ""modern"" style but the uncomfortable eating arrangements and over use of sauce did not suit my dining preferences. We tried the popular dishes being the teriyaki burger, shrimp pancake salad, chirashi sushi, salmon tartar and a few other appies (i dont remember...). Most of the dishes were underwhelming and quite small for a very high price. The chirashi sushi was stunning to look at but at the end of the day, you couldn't taste the fresh fish as the sauces overpowered it all. The teriyaki burger was nothing special and the shrimp pancake was okay. Overall, for the wait, price and uncomfortable seating, I would not return to Kazu for a good japanese meal."
/user_details?userid=A8U7ETNgSWYOyBqIA4Wj0w,Jovie J.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,I've never been to Japan but I assume this place is a thin slice of it in downtown Montreal. I've been coming here for years ordering the same dishes over and over again. The tuna and salmon bowl and the 48 hours pork bowl. The meals come with choice of soup or salad and both are really good too. The soup is a nice broth with egg whites and the salad has a potato salad like dressing on it as well. I know salad on salad? It works though! Any bite off of any of these dishes remind you of how you can never be vegan trust me.
/user_details?userid=wJF-NdtxYCk_SrwG4UUL9Q,Stephanie L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Seriously one of my favourite restaurants in the city. I've been many times so my review is based on all of those experiences. There's pretty much guaranteed to be a line unless you show up early to wait, or 2 Pm on a weekday afternoon. Located in the Guy Concordia area, Kazu is a small hole in the wall, that offered authentic and unique Japanese dishes, such as pork ramen, oysters, dips, beef kalbi. If you go on Sunday, you'll get to try their homemade tofu which is only available then. You get a big bowl of it with soy sauce, very good. I always get the tuna and salmon bowl, it's a bowl of rice topped with salad, salmon and tuna, crispy noodles, and sauce. It's so good, writing this review is making me so hungry. The shrimp burger is also amazing. So tender and juicy, you can see the chunks of shrimp. The salmon calcium dip is also very good and it has a great presentation. Pretty much you can't go wrong with what you order. Save room for ice cream! There are many flavours such as sake, wasabi, green and black tea!"
/user_details?userid=LmRxSjvSPR36u5t4QnGwaw,Nessa B.,"Winter Haven, FL",5 star rating,Must try when visiting Montréal!!! I ordered the Beef Short Ribs. They came with rice and salad. The portion size was huge but I sure ate it all! Kazu is quite small and will get busy. Get there early to beat the rush. It is an open kitchen so if you sit at the counter you can experience the action. I would definitely go again!

A little bit disappointed, the tastes and service are just so so. Compared with other restaurants, the hygiene and Covid-19 protection measure for customers are so bad. They let other customers seat beside our table without asking our approved. Definitely not able to keep 2-meter distance. The little piece of shield between our tables is too small to protect both sides. they attach menu on that shield. the customers besides us have to face our table to discuss about their order when we were eating. During this crisis I feel UNSAFE and not valuable to waste your money and time to have meal in this restaurant...."

/user_details?userid=kbyxFChwMzukTasy9lRHTA,Kevin B.,"Philadelphia, PA",2 star rating,"Despite my friend's warnings that ""the Asian food in Toronto is a million times better than in Montréal,"" I still decided to come here due to the high praise on Yelp. Unfortunately, it turns out I should've listened to my friend.The shop is very small, but they're pros at getting people in and out. The staff gives you about a minute to look over the menu, and then once you finish the food they're by instantly with the bill. I didn't mind too much, since I had places to be anyways, but this is not somewhere you can come to savor the experience.That's not a big problem, though, since the experience isn't worth savoring anyways. I got the tuna and salmon bowl (basically a poke bowl), and it was thoroughly disappointing. The fish wasn't very fresh, and the other items (lettuce, crispy noodles, vegetables) were all very bland. Even the soup served as an appetizer tasted just like sour water.To some extent, I can see why this place is popular, since it has a trendy vibe and a faux ""hole-in-the-wall"" ambiance that perhaps some people mistake for the real thing. But if this is anyone's idea of good Asian food, then they're seriously missing out on how good the real deal can be."
/user_details?userid=jKn_HycMvKa3yPHAUoCQAQ,Angela C.,"San Mateo, CA",4 star rating,"Authentic hole in the wall Japanese food! There is always a line up here and there is no gurantee the turn over rate is high since most people enjoy their meal while chatting. We waited and were seated the last table way past their closing time - very kind of them to accommodate us!We ordered heaps! Yuzu beer - the foam was fantastic (subtle sweetness to it) except drink fast because it evaporates. We had marinated beef, rice, skewers.... food was very flavorful!!! I loved it and would definitely come back for more."
/user_details?userid=QhpMnqFm9bmaFKDQ5FNiwQ,Sara W.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"This place is hyped up, as there was a line already at 6:30pm and we had to wait half an hour. Once seated though, the food comes out SUPER quick, so that's good.However, this place is small, and 3 of us were seated at where we saw only 2 people were sitting before. It was the table right by the bar, and people/waiters walk back and forth there. I was squeezed right next to someone sitting at another table, and the waiter had barely just fit a stool there. By the time we were leaving, we saw a table that sat two before squeezed with five people! They're doing their best, but it just brings the experience down to squeeze people into tables that have you elbow to elbow with someone sitting at another table...As for the food, it was okay. I wasn't all that impressed. For appetizers, we saw Japanese Raviolis. Sounded pretty interesting, was kinda expecting to be something like Italian raviolis, and they were dumplings... I don't know why they didn't label it as dumplings/gyozas? Also for the okonomiyaki, we were asked if we wanted vegetable or shrimp one. We chose the shrimp one, but they just top the okonomiyaki with shrimp as a topping. It was also cold. I've had okonomiyaki in a few other places before and the shrimp has always been inside the okonomiyaki not as a topping. We also got the 48 hour pork bowl, that was pretty good. The beef kalbi plate was also delicious. Portions smaller than expected. Kazu was definitely an interesting experience in that the environment was different, but I didn't feel the food was that great to come back for in addition to the wait and tight seating."
/user_details?userid=HpzMECWPO4H1fJihiMG1Pg,Lanyi L.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"This place was super busy when we arrived on a weekday evening and I understand why now... the food is absolutely delicious. We all ordered the tuna and salmon tartar bowl. Service was very fast and friendly. My one complaint is that the space is very small and due to the high traffic, we felt very rushed and they wanted us to leave quickly, which is understandable because there were so many people lined up! I hope they can expand to a larger space!"
/user_details?userid=3iUS5J0rc2lP2R5JZMfV5Q,Louise E.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"If you can have just one meal in Montreal... where should you go? To a Japanese izakaya joint - Kazu! It will never disappoint and it will leave you happier and fuller. I LOVE this place!It's a small joint and the line ups start before the restaurant opens. We showed up around 4:40 to beat the lines and we were first. However, within minutes the line-up started behind us. If you can, definitely sit by the bar. It's lively, you get the watch the chefs in action, and if you're lucky, they'll even share some great food gems with you. Lots of food choices in their regular menu, but don't forget to look at their specials, posted on yellow paper on their specials board. It's a great way to try what's in season and other specialty items.Great price for literally everything and you can't go wrong with any of the choices. When we went my boyfriend and I balled out and got the following:1. Oysters - vinaigrette was very light and complimented the fresh oysters2. Pork Cheek - interesting texture and great sauces served with tortilla3. Chicken tortilla - the chicken was perfect and the salad served in the middle was amazing4. O-toro - thinly sliced and super fresh, can't go wrong with o-toro, ever5. Chicken, chicken skin, and pork yakitori - ALL AMAZING! MUST GET!6. Tuna belly - WOW! My boyfriend who doesn't eat much tuna couldn't get enough of this. Takes 30 minutes to make - definitely worth the wait and enough time to get a little shwasty on the sake7. Dessert - YOU MUST GET THE ICE CREAM WITH THE POP ROCKS!!! It's awesome and make sure you get your own cause trust me, you won't want to share this with anyone, even a loved one...For Montreal locals, I envy you because I can't go to Kazu every week since I live in Toronto, and for tourists - GO TO KAZU!"
/user_details?userid=JmEji3_Tfo2__69aLLcLPA,Jing S.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,"Does this place even need more reviews? Probably one of the favourite yelper places in Montreal.I've been there a couple of times myself in the past. Situated on Saint-Catherine street in downtown Montreal, this little ""hole in the wall"" restaurant is a not-so-hidden treasure.I had their Buta-Don and grilled calamari this time. The Buta-Don is a 48 hours marinated pork cooked with onions and red gingers laying over a bed of white rice. It is a very simple and well rounded dish. It also came with a little soup or salad. Which was cute little add on.The grilled calamari is a beautiful dish; the presentation is splendid. You taste the burned charcoal flagrance on the calamari.But my favourite dish from kazu is still their ramen; I'm a ramen kind of guy and their ramen is godly. The broth is addictive, the pork meat is tender and juicy, and the noodles have the right balance of chewiness. It's only available on their lunch menu though.The waiters are super friendly and polite.The complaints of kazu has always being how small this place is and that they should expand to a bigger place. However, in my opinion, this is its charm. Nothing fancy, it's a casual friendly place; where everyone is part of this dining experience. It's exactly like those small restaurant that you would see in anime. If it was bigger it wouldn't be Kazu.PS: expect line up."

/user_details?userid=2g5qp1_2_iGDJI7hPcC8TQ,Andrew M.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"Ok, updating my review here after returning several months later.  The lamb chops are awesome, amazing, and delicious (perfectly cooked and well flavored).  Get them!Several reasons why I revised my rating down from a 5 to a 4.  First of all, with regards to the food, I think it is a little bit hit-or-miss in terms of flavor.  While everything is well presented, some of the dishes just don't have the same 'zing' as others.  For example, I thought the pork bibimbap was ok---but could use more spice.  Also, there is nearly always a line to get in here (be prepared to wait at least 30 min); the space inside is very small and you may well be crammed around a table.  If you have a choice, sit at the bar; I liked it there better.  The service is good, in general, though they did forget to bring one item we ordered (though it found its way onto the bill)."

It is a place to go and have your food , eat fast and leave !  But keep in mind the food is super good. Specially their shrimp sandwiches ! Oh and do not think it is big enough for two!

I came based on a friend's recommendation completely unaware of its amazing Yelp reviews. I was told that the shrimp burger is a must, and I definitely saw why. It's unlike any burger that I've ever had. Not only because of the burger ""meat"", which was super tender with nice big chunks of shrimp, but also because of the bun which was light and flaky. When paired with lettuce, crispy rice bits, and their dark and light sauce, it was just perfection in a bite. I also had the pan-fried gyoza. The filling is good, but the crispy layer that forms on the bottom was my favorite part! Will definitely hit up this spot again the next time I'm in the city!"

/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A Kazu experience is unlike any other restaurant experience anywhere. It's extremely small, lineups outside are almost unavoidable, and the meal is rushed by the waitstaff while the kitchen retains a highly elevated food aesthetic. I going to admit that I am not a massive fan of Japanese food to begin with. I enjoy it, but I almost never crave it when hungry. In terms of flavour, certain dishes are spectacular, while others are overrated and badly executed. In all, Kazu is a unique experience that deserves our respect.My wife and I wanted to squeeze in Kazu before making a 7:10pm movie at the Forum 3 blocks away. Having eaten here a couple of times over the last 5 years, I remembered how unpleasant it is to have to stand outside in a line for 45 minutes while watching people eat through the window. Some people don't seem to mind the wait. It's almost as if they are imbued with a sense of identity and pride that they can be spotted waiting at the hippest place. Not wanting to miss the movie, I insisted that we line up 15-20 minutes before it opened at 5:30. If you don't deal well with frustration while hungry, this is the play at Kazu. If you've already had a bunch of drinks and snacks beforehand and you're feeling good, by all means, saunter over to the lineup whenever you like and enjoy how nauseatingly hip you look standing around on the street. At 40, this is one status symbol I can live without. I'm old, grumpy AF, and not above scarfing down dinner at 5:30 sharp.They let us in the restaurant at about 5:20pm and we had our pick of tables. The service was lighting fast. Our waiter Noah was exceptionally friendly and moved with military efficiency. He should be nominated for the best waiter in Montreal award, if that exists.We ordered a variety of dishes which arrived in a synchronized order. The very second you finish one dish, it is cleared and the next dish is placed down before you. Beer is served in a chilled glass. The bill is produced while you are taking your last bite. Big Brother is watching every morsel of food you consume, all in an effort to get you out of there ASAP and get the next group in. Nevertheless, what is clearly a highly stressful job is handled with grace and a smile by the waitstaff. THE FOOD:Crispy BBQ chicken tortilla salad: This was my favourite dish of the night. This appetizer is essentially four tortilla triangles with lettuce, tomato, and chicken. Like most Kazu dishes, this dish is drowning in multiple sauces. The result is really quite tasty. I wouldn't say that the chicken was crispy, but it did have a delicious grilled flavour. The best description I would have for this dish would be a japanese club sandwich. I could have made a meal out of 2 orders of this.Chicken Wings: They are grilled and coated in sauce. The seasonings in this dish seemed confused and incongruous. It was sour, spicy, and sweet. The chicken itself was juicy and flavourful, but the coating didn't work for me. It is served on a bed of a what tasted like mashed potatoes, but I could be wrong. Maybe it was cauliflower or rice-based?Chicken Yakitori skewers: At 4$ for 2 skewers, you can't go wrong here. We only ordered one, but next time I would skip the wings and get 3 or 4 orders of this. The sauce is sweet and delicious while the chicken itself has that deep charred grill taste. Shrimp burger: I've never understood the hype over this dish. It is easily the most overrated menu item at Kazu. The patty should taste like shrimp but it tastes mild and neutral. You could tell me that it's processed chicken or tofu and I'd believe you. The only thing you can taste is the gallon of Wafu-Like sauce smothered on this thing. Sure, it's pretty with the bright green shredded lettuce and the rice crisps sprinkled all over the place. I would prefer to taste shrimp and have a small amount of subtle sauce on the bun. The bun itself tastes like a Villagio hamburger bun you buy at IGA.Grilled lamb: Similar to the chicken wings, the meat itself was tender and delicious, but the sauce was overpowering and unbalanced. The chef seems to be using the everything but the ""kitchen sink"" technique. A little less would be welcomed. For 3 lamb lollipops, god only knows how many sauces and oils are swimming on this plate. The side of purple cabbage was tasty.Salmon and tuna bowl: What you see is what you get. I can see the appeal since it is very simple and tastes fresh. This is the only dish with restrained saucing. In fact, it could use a touch more rice vinegar or soy sauce on the side.Salmon belly: This was extremely fatty and delicious. The long strip of salmon is crispy and sweet on the outside while tender inside. Of course it is drowned in enough sauce for 3 dishes, but the protein itself was stellar. Served with a delicious salad, this dish is a winner.Kazu can be fun from time to time if you order well and time your arrival properly."

I find myself always craving food from here because that's just how delicious it is. Anyone I bring here also falls in love with this place. Don't be afraid of the lineups; it is well worth the wait!What makes Kazu unique is that it's reminiscent to typical Japanese restaurants you find all over Japan. It's a really tiny and cramped place, the service is rapid, it's loud inside, some menu items are written on the wall, and everything is wooden in there. Every time I go here, it reminds me of my trips to Japan. I honestly don't think I ate one bad thing here, although I didn't try the whole menu. My favourite dishes are the pork cheeks (it's rich but so tasty with the sauces they add) and the tuna salmon salad rice bowl (the dressing is what makes this bowl so damn delicious). I've had also beef carpaccio, grilled calamari, shrimp burger, 48 hour pork bowl, the ramen (only available for lunch), salmon head and eel rice bowl with seaweed, and all the dishes were also awesome. A must try as well is the matcha panna cotta topped with white chocolate crumbs! Limited but good drinks menu as well. The pricing is average, but for the quality of the food, it is so worthwhile. I love how authentic Kazu is and you get the real experience of Japanese culture. An easy 5 stars!"

Very simple small Japanese restaurant but the food is exceptional and honestly compares to Japan quality. The salmon tuna bowl and kalbi lamb are a must try. Definitely try to come in early before the open because there is usually a long line outside
/user_details?userid=o_IEnOVNuir0QNVkANzyXQ,Esteban Y.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Every time I walked by this place, a huge line up is there. Had to try it out. I ordered a shrimp burger. It was very good, not great. And prices are ok. I actually was expecting more of this place due to all the people waiting. I like that the menu is not endless. I did like it and probably would come back, but that long waiting line makes me think twice. If by any chance you see there is not a huge line up, try the place, it's good (but not amazing). Service is awesome and very quick. Enjoyed a lady throwing some Japanese words while talking to us."

There was a constant flow of dishes coming out of the kitchen right in front of us, each with many diffetent sauces drizzled at different layers as the dishes were assembled. Mesmerizing. Every dish was excellent, but the seabass took top honors. Even the dregs on the plate after all the fish was gone were delectable. The service was friendly, with lots of little touches, like an ice bath for the sake bottle. I would come back anytime I'm in town."

Insanely efficient service, though we never feel rushed. Food is delicious and made right in front of you by Chez Kazu! Hot tip: there's going to be a line, so try to arrive right when the restaurant opens (around 5pm). There's only one table for groups (seats 4) so come solo or with a friend/date.Food recommendations: everything on the menu is impressive and made with care - you can't go wrong. Highly recommend the salmon belly, eggplant tortillas (app), kalbi ribs, yakitori (app), and salmon burger. Their ice cream is amazing (wasabi and black tea are my favourites)."

You come here not for any sushi but rather sautee and bowl dishes. This joint is very popular! So popular that the line began to form out the door about 20 minutes after opening. Luckily I got there right when it opened. Good news is the service was fast and efficient - got my order of beef and rice within 5 minutes after ordering. I spent that 5 minutes watching my beef get grilled and garnished. The beer was juicy​, tender, and full of flavor. I would also recommend the yakitori and sake ice cream. The staff was very friendly and helpful. If you are looking for a great hole in the wall Japanese restaurant that doesn't​ focus on sushi - Kazu is your place!"

When we finally found parking, our other 2 friends were already in front of the line. This restaurant is REALLY small and packed. I didn't like how everyone was in close proximity from one another but the food made up for it. We were seated at the bar and our waitress was awesome! I got the Chirashi-zushi. It was plated beautifully and the raw tuna and salmon sashimi tasted fresh! I normally don't like wasabi on anything but the dish as a whole complimented each other well."

However, the service is pretty quick and you dont usually stay too long inside the restaurant. Although there's always a line up outside, the wait is definitely worth it!"
/user_details?userid=Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,Jennifer M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow, I was really blown away by my experience at Kazu. We were able to sit at the bar over-looking the kitchen, which is my favorite spot at most restaurants. I like being able to watch the process of creating dishes which happens at high speed in the tiny kitchen.We ordered a number of dishes off the menu and off the wall signs. We started with the tender beef carpaccio that melted in our mouths. Then we dug into the bowl of fresh, soft tofu - which is only made on Sunday so make sure to keep that in mind. I found it deeply satisfying and comforting. Next came the shrimp burger which was subtle in its ""shrimp-ness"" but is something I'd love to eat while watching a football game even though it felt somewhat healthy. This was followed by the grilled lamb chops which made me really love lamb for the first time. We then had the grilled calamari and salad, which was the perfect consistency and evoked the feeling of freshness. The final touch was the sakura (cherry blossom) ice cream which was a sweet ending to a wonderful dinner. It's worth the wait in line, the service is great and although you need to eat and go to make space for others, it feels like you're all part of special club. I can't wait to return!"

We arrived at the restaurant a few minutes past opening and there was already a huge line. Instead of waiting, we just grabbed to go orders. We didn't get to eat it until over a half hour later and it still tasted BOMB as ever. We ordered:Beef capaccio Tuna salmon saladShrimp pancakeKalbiChicken bibimbap Everything.. EVERYTHING tasted amazing! Each order came with salad and even the salads tasted amazing! I loved how the shrimp pancake had more content than the actual batter used to make the shape - definitely a great starter for appetizer. The beef capaccio is a must try as well. Perfectly seasoned and chewy *drool* (don't get it if you don't like raw). Tuna salmon salad... I didn't even know raw salmon could taste so good with lettuce but somehow they did it. The kalbi was the best I ever had hands down - A MUST TRY. My least favorite was the chicken bibimbap but it was still good. Share the appetizers, but definitely get your own order for the kalbi. This is one of the few places I will go WAYYYYY out of my way just to get another order. If you're visiting Montreal, make this place a necessary destination!! If you want to dine in, I would suggest waiting outside the place at least 20-30 minutes before opening."
/user_details?userid=VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw,WhiteFeather H.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"OK, this place, THIS PLACE! You will wait in line to get into this cramped little hole-in-the-wall, so be prepared. That being said, it's worth waiting in line, even if you're waiting in line with an umbrella under a torrential downpour. And, if you, like me, go early to get in line and get to the door and your date still isn't there yet to meet you, they will seat the people behind you unless you're willing to immediately put in an order for said yet-to-arrive date. So, go with the person you plan to eat with, and get cozy. Holding down a table in this action-packed city hotspot is an impossibility. The flow here is rapid and pressing. Your server will stand looking over your shoulder to encourage you to order as soon as humanly possible because they want their turn-over to be efficient. There aren't an over-abundance of menu items, so the choice should be somewhat easy to make. The rice bowls are a good bet! The eggplant dip is delicious for an appetizer, but the rice bowl will more than fill you up! Also, collagen cocktail. Go for it - you aren't getting any younger and time is moving fast in Kazu!Now, allllllll that being said, your order will be utter perfection and you will not in any way be pressured to eat and dash. It is all DELICIOUS, and beautifully, beautifully presented. You feel more chic just eating such a snazzy food choice. The vibes are really good in Kazu, too - even for the hectic nature of it all! The cooks are blissed out, the wait staff is happy and joking with each other, and everyone in the place is full of happy-belly goodness. It's soooooooo worth the wait, even if you just go once for the fantastic experience."

Still busy with people queuing up in line, no matter what time of day. Still consistent and delicious. We came for lunch and were running a bit behind schedule (meaning we didn't arrive till a few minutes past noon). Already knew we would have to wait but it wasn't too bad! Around 20 to 25 minutes.Hours. Note that they're closed Tuesday. I've never seen this place not busy.Cash or debit only. Don't forget. I wouldn't want to be sitting at the table by the window. People constantly peering at you and giving you ""hurry up"" stares.Lunch menu. Even though there's only 8 main options, it's still so difficult to decide. Couple appetizers and homemade soft serve ice cream. I won't spoil it but GET THE ICE CREAM. Oops.I didn't realize but the hand written, yellow sticky notes are for dinner only. That grilled lamb sounds bomb along with the fresh oysters, grilled octopus leg and scallop sashimi. Is there anything Kazu doesn't do? *Drool*We got extremely lucky and even though we were a party of five, they squeezed us into the bar. Love watching the chefs work their magic. Insane how fast and efficient they are in such a cramped space.If you've never been inside, it is tighttttttt. There's only four pint sized tables and the bar.- Mashed potato - you get a small side dish of either soup or mashed potato. Nicely flavoured and light for being mainly all potato.- Calcium salmon ($7.00)- salmon paste with tortilla. Yes, those are rice krispies and yes, it most certainly works. Bold, fresh flavours.- Tuna and salmon bowl ($12.00) - freshly chopped tuna and salmon mixed with salad on top of steamed Japanese rice. Light, healthy, refreshing. Always a favourite.- 48 hour pork bowl ($12.00) - rice topped with sliced pork simmered in a soy sauce based sweet sauce. That pink stuff is pickled ginger on top. Pork is sliced thinly, well marinated and tasty. Over a bed of rice is perfect.- Ramen ($12.00) - homemade noodle soup topped with vegetables, BBQ pork and a soft-boiled egg. For Montreal, the broth is good and the noodles have a nice spring to them.- Galbi ($18.00) - the galbi was well seasoned, tender and had a great sweet sticky sauce. Interesting that they have this Korean inspired dish on their menu. I've seen that they even do a bibimbaap dish.- Shrimp burger ($12.00) - made from fresh black tiger shrimps. The sandwich literally just melts in your mouth. The flavours blend perfectly together in perfect harmony.- Wasabi homemade soft serve ice cream ($5.00) - this was one of the BEST soft serve ice cream's I think I've tasted in my life. The wasabi powder/flavour wasn't very prominent but the texture of their soft serve was perfect. Seriously, this was memorable. If you like home churned soft serve, it's a must order. Perfect amount to share although I ended up getting to eat most of it!"

On one of the days, my poor, cold, boyfriend had a craving for ramen. Thanks to his craving and Yelp, we were able to find Kazu! When we got there, there was a line to get inside. It was so cold but we stuck it out and made it in! This place is small. There's maybe 6 counter seats and 5 tables inside that can seat 2-4 people each.We had the ramen (which btw is the absolute BEST ramen I've ever had) and the beef rib bowl the first day we went and the second day we had the ramen and tuna/salmon salad. The second day we went we were driving five hours back home. We lamented not having any accessibility to Kazu anymore so we ordered a beef rib bowl to go. They gave us two huge ribs! It was awesome! I don't know how to describe the amazing flavor in all their dishes. Their food puts me at a loss for words. At best, all I can say is it is amazing and savory and delicious. Their food tastes like edible love. My boyfriend and I still talk about how amazing Kazu is and if it's feasible to drive five hours and cross the US/Canada border just to eat there. Seriously, it's that good.If you are blessed enough to live in Montreal and haven't tried Kazu yet, go! You are SO lucky! I envy you!

They gave two of us tiny stools that even a child could not sit on without balance and then they squeezed the same kind of seating to the small table next to us. My son could not move his legs or get out of the seat until he was done with his food. He is 6'1"". The food was good, but we've had better in NY and in our area.

As I waited to use the restroom (after our meal), I saw a tiny area where someone was washing the dishes and believe me, I don't think they were washing them well. We went based on Yelp reviews since we weren't familiar with the area and the photos looked amazing, but I guess there aren't that many great (decently clean) Japanese restaurants near that area. My review is for those who are not familiar with the area and expect to go to a decent Japanese restaurant."

Waited in queue for at least 45-50 minutes for a table as we were quite a huge group, however they all said it would be worth the efforts and wait.Finally got in the restaurant and I was surprised to how tiny it was and still accommodated many people. There were seats at the bar as well. You can see them making the food if you're seated at the bar side. Our turn came in to place the order and I went with the shrimp burger and omg at first bite, I was delighted and my mouth felt in love with this place! The portions are quite big enough and will fill you up. Even the salad was delicious. The service is amazing as well. The girls are so nice and treat you so well. I'd definitely recommend this place despite the wait as it's worth it and you won't regret standing in line for quite long for this great amazing meals that are provided here!

THATS how good this place is. We were the 5th party in line at 5:33pm (they open at 5:30) and because the place was so small and it was raining, we decided to order to go and go back to our hotel to eat. Even though the food was sitting for about 30-45min in the car, it was still mind blowing good! The kalbi is out of this world!!! It's soft, tender, juicy and so flavorful; the sauce they pour over the kalbi and rice is so good too! you will not want to share this with anyone else so get your own. The beef carpaccio was one of the best I've had and could easily challenge those of high end restaurants. Shrimp pancake used real shrimp and wasn't oily so it was a real treat! Chicken bibambap was amazing as well and the chicken was so juicy!! Lastly, the tuna salmon salad rice bowl was a very simple yet delicious creation that used fresh fresh!

What bothers me about this place is it's cleanliness. We were sitting at the counter, so had a direct view of the kitchen. Upon preparing a salad, the chef reached into the sink to pull the wash rag out. Then with the same hand he touched a dirty wash rag, mixed the salad in the bowl before putting it on a clients plate. I almost threw up on the spot.  I kept telling myself to chill, and that this stuff happens in restaurant kitchens all the time.  (Not in mine, but I digress).  The kitchen is so small the glasses are stored over the sink (hanging upside down on a bar rack). Kitchen staff regularly pours hot liquid into the sink and the steam goes up and into the glasses. You are then served water in these ""clean"" glasses (with steam rising up from a presumably dirty sink).   If you're not sensitive to dirty cutlery, floors, or  kitchens in general then I recommend trying it.   If you are sensitive then sit at one of the small tables."

I finally had the chance to go last night. My hubby and I followed recommendations and ordered the shrimp burger, salmon tuna bowl and the bbq chicken tortilla. TBH, we weren't that impressed. Sure, everything tasted good, but so does anything once you drown it in mayonnaise or other sauces. We left feeling a bit gross (since the food we ate was not healthy). The salmon tuna bowl barely had any salmon or tuna - just mostly rice. The shrimp burger was good, yes, but had way too much mayonnaise. There was definitely nothing subtle about our meal.However, I think I need to go back. I think if I were to do it again I would get the salmon belly or pork neck. Also, I want to add that the service was amazing. Our waitresses were so patient and kind! We got in line at 5 pm and were the first to be seated. When we left at 6 pm, there was a line out the door on a Thursday night. Just FYI."

It was good, but I wouldn't say it's amazing. There is a substantial about of shrimp, the sauce is flavourful and peppery but not too heavy, and the size of the burger is decent. I thought there was a bit too much lettuce though and maybe after all the rave reviews, I expected to be wowed but wasn't. It's still a solid dish, but I wouldn't wait an hour in line for it.Pro tip - skip the line and order takeout. My order was ready for pickup within 10 minutes.

/user_details?userid=hOYNnE3qzb8TDKd3jqvq7Q,Tyler O.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"Best restaurant experience ever. My girlfriend and I decided to give this place a shot after hearing all the great reviews and we waited in the hour long line on a Sunday night. The place is very small with maybe five tables and few seats at the bar, right in front of the open kitchen. We quickly took our seats at the bar and immediately asked the staff for the suggestions. We ordered the house sake which was incredible and so smooth. For appetizers, we ordered the eggplant dip and the chicken gyoza. The eggplant dip was like nothing you could have ever imagined; it didn't taste overly like eggplant, it tasted more like all the sauces and seasonings mixed in. Sweet, salty, a little spicy and so freaking good. The chicken gyoza were also amazing. Little fried Japanese raviolis of perfection served with a soy dipping sauce. For our meals, my girlfriend ordered the lamb special and I ordered the beef galbi. The beef was so tender with the right amount of char and served with this amazing barbecue-type sauce, rice, and an arugula salad. My only complaint was that I wish there was more beef. I ended up sneaking a bite of my girlfriend's lamb and it was quite possibly the best bite of food I have ever had. It was served with a wasabi sauce and some purple cabbage. I ended up ordering another dish for myself because I needed to try more of their amazing food. I ordered the 48 hour pork with rice and onions. It was rich and moist and so flavorful. I can't say enough about this place and the staff running it. It's a husband and wife team, the husband is the main chef in the kitchen and the wife is like Wonder Woman, taking orders on the phone, closing out tabs, and doing everything else all at once. We loved it so much that we bought two shirts for ourselves. Go here. Wait in line. Go home full and happy."
/user_details?userid=C7lXOTSLUAHG3gkG_Q_39w,Barbara D.,"Mississauga, Canada",4 star rating,"There's a reason for the lineups, and an even greater reason for the hype - it really and truly is very real! We were visiting Montreal for a night on a weekday evening and thought we'd try our luck at Kazu. Everything was fantastic, from the atmosphere, food, service, and, to top it off, reasonable pricing. If it wasn't so difficult to get in, this would certainly be a solid 5 stars to me. First, seating and lineups. On a Thursday night at 8:45 PM, there was quite a lineup, but thankfully, because we just needed a table for 2, we were able to secure two seats at the bar within 30 minutes (we bypassed a lot of people who needed a table for 4). So note: if you're a bigger group, it's trickier to get a table here. It's not a very large space, with just a handful of seats, so you're better off coming as a pair or small group.Second, the food. We ordered the Korean Galbi with Rice ($18.00) and the Japanese Bibimbap with Beef ($18.00) and homemade green tea ice cream for dessert ($5.00). Portions are more than generous, they don't skimp on the meat, and everything tasted so incredibly delicious. Tons of flavour, the meat is so tender, and the flavours melded together perfectly. So tasty, you can't go wrong with these dishes!Third, the vibe. Casual, lively, boisterous, Japanese diner meets Montreal nightlife. It's not a place for quiet conversation. It's intimate since space is limited, but the energy is dynamic, and you feel like you're part of a community when you dine here. A homey environment that pairs well with the delicious, comfort food level dishes they serve here. If you're in Montreal, check this place out. Definitely worth the wait. For two people, with tax and tip, we paid $55.00."

Everything was excellent including service.  Note that the tiny space fits like tight pants and you'll be bumped and touched by you neighbor and the staff through the course of the meal.  But watching the kitchen move is like watching cirque du soleil close up so you get dinner and a show too.We are tourist/foodies visiting from Philadelphia but I would recommend this to anyone I knew was visiting the area.

It's not too heavy or salty (which is rare in japanese cuisine). And the portion sizes were amazing. The overall salty and hearty ingredients just complemented each other so well. No wonder they sell Kazu-branded sweaters because HONESTLY, the food was THAT good.My friends ordered steak, sashimi, and ramen. Out of all the dishes they ordered, the curry ramen has to be my favourite. It's seasoned so well that it really pushes you to just continue indulging in the noodly goodness.One thing I didn't like about the place was how compact it was.

This no-sushi Japanese restaurant is AMAZING. I lived near Kazu for 3 years and I've visited this place more times than I could count. It is a tiny, hole-in-the-wall restaurant that seats roughly 20 customers. There are 4 tables and a bar area that surrounds an open kitchen. The place is bustling with movement. It's quite a squeeze at full capacity but it's worth it. Service is incredibly fast, never more than 5-10min wait for any dish. The food is to die for. My favourite is the tuna salmon bowl, which is tossed with leafy greens, rice, and crispy noodles with a zesty dressing (that you can buy!). But you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Seasonal items are posted on papers on the walls, for example lobster. I've tried just about everything here and I love it all, but if you're visiting for the first time try these if you're not sure what to get: eggplant dip, kalbi beef, shrimp burger, 48hr marinated pork bowl, beef bone, tuna belly, and sashimi plate. Most meals come with a small dish of salad or soup (I recommend the soup-it's very savoury). You must try their ice cream, which is home-churned. They have many flavours including black tea , green tea, khalua, maple, wasabi, etc. It's SO tiny and tasty!!They have a limited lunch menu but everything on there is excellent, just a small selection of the dinner menu. One of my favourite inexpensive meals to get for a quick lunch or dinner is the veggie bowl ($12ish). You can order food for pick up but they don't deliver. Tip: they don't take reservations so make sure you line up for dinner around 5:15pm to get a seat when they open at 5:30pm. Second tip: if you want fresh, home-made tofu, visit on a Sunday. Overall, I think this is THE best restaurant in Montreal. No pretentious atmosphere or over-priced menu, just delicious food for a fair price!"

The kitchen is entirely open concept and for this reason, I always opt to sit at the bar, so that I can watch the chefs in action. Out their whole menu, I have yet to have something that disappointed me. However, my favourites are the salmon bowl (super fresh, crispy puffed rice noodles, amazing sauces), the grilled pork neck (expect it to get very messy eating it since you need to use hands but its so smokey and flavourful) and the tataki (I've had tuna and beef and both were amazing, slightly tangy and very fresh).

The portions are bigger than we expected and we were very full after sharing the salmon/tuna sashimi salad, the chicken bibimbap, and the shrimp burger. While everything was very good, the salmon/tuna sashmini salad was probably our favorite as the fish was fresh and the flavors melded together very well from the dressing, fish, rice, and salad. I was a little worried that my ""ADD"" self would be distracted by the fast pace and quick service, but I was prepared going into the meal and enjoyed the experience.

There are about 3 sauces drizzled over the fish as well, all good, especially the wasabi sauce. It brought the flavor of fish to life. The 48 hour pork was the other main dish. The pork was very tender and flavorful, but definitely get it with the curry. The potatoes and curry in it were tender as well which allowed the curry flavor to soak in. The Chirashi was by far our favorite."

Personally, I really don't mind the queue (although I've never lined up during the winter time) and the cramped space. It gives the restaurant an unique feel.We always get seated at the bar since we're always a party of two and it's amazing to see the staff cooking so efficiently. There is practically no waiting once you're seated. The chef/boss is also very friendly.The food at Kazu is out of this world, definitely worth the queue in my opinion. I've tried a lot of their dishes and have never been disappointed: everything is so flavourful. The portions are huge so you are getting the bang for your buck (most dishes are pretty inexpensive as well)."

Notes to Americans:: they only accept Canadian Debt or Cash. If you use US dollar its 1 to 1 so bad deal.  I even got my change in Canadian dollar so lost out little more.  However food is all good and very reasonably priced. Expect long line.

They open for lunch at noon and were warned about crowds so we got there at 12:10 and sure enough...we had to wait outside to be seated. Worth it though, ordered the ramen and the beef #1?

/user_details?userid=WmIqb6uCqJbxWp9k7ZU-hw,Jennifer T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I highly recommend you to get there before they open or else the lineup might be long... We got there right when they opened but there was already a lineup! Fortunately, we didn't wait for a long time (we waited around 20-30 min since we got there relatively ""early"")! Since it was my first time at Kazu and I didn't know what to order, my boyfriend was the one who ordered everything. We got their Beef Carpaccio, their 48 hours pork bowl and their grilled chicken (I can't find the exact name of their online menu).I was impress at how fast our food was served. Everything came so fast that within not even 15 minutes, our table was filled with food. They also use pretty big plate so it takes up quite a lot of space on the table.. But the dishes are beautifully plated with an artistic touch.Our waitress gave us a potato salad to start with and soon after our Beef Carpaccio arrived. At first, I was reluctant to try this dish because I don't normally eat rare beef (I can't stand raw meat... Especially those bloody ones) But my boyfriend convinced me to try it and thank goodness I did! Their Beef Carpaccio was sooo good. I've had rare beef before (but only 3 times in my life) and I think Kazu makes the best Beef Carpaccio! The sauce that came with it just makes everything taste better! Although it was raw beef, it was sliced very thinly, so you couldn't really taste the ""meat"", and eating it with the sauce and the salad was just perfect! The crisped rice (Puffed rice) also added some crunchiness and texture to the overall dish.Their 48 hours pork bowl is a bowl of rice that is topped with sliced pork, onion and ginger. Apparently the pork was simmered in soy sauce for 48 hours, which is why the name of this dish is ""48 hours pork bowl"". The whole dish had a sweeter touch (but don't worry, it wasn't sweet as macaron or dessert) since it came with a mildly sweet sauce This dish was overall good but I've had better ones in Taiwan at a chain restaurant called Yoshinoya. Their pork bowl is similar to the gyudon, which is ""a bowl of rice topped with beef and onion simmered in a mildly sweet sauce flavored"". The grilled chicken plate (I made up this name) consists of grilled chicken topped with salad and rice. The chicken was grilled to perfection; really tender! The sauce that Kazu used in their dishes is amazingly good! I'm not sure if they use the same sauce in all of their dishes but I really liked it!I highly recommend Kazu but beware of lineups. Service is fast and efficient. Food is amazingly fresh and yummy."

As I was having a snack and being alone, I ordered the Shrimp Burger that everyone raved about and a Yuzu Soju Cocktail to wash it down.Shrimp Burger was A-OK. Love the Spicy Mayo that gave a little kick to the burger and the rice cracker added texture. The shrimp patty though was really messy. I was happy sipping my drink and absorbing the busy vibe. The service was a little rush but of course the staff wanted to turnover the tables as fast as possible.I don't mind coming back next time when I am in town visiting. The rice bowl does look good..

The food was divine, well thought-out with intricate flavours and textures. However sauces do repeat themselves and you fell pressured to order fast and to eat fast; all to ensure their tremendous turnover. Food is a 8.5/10 but the experience as a whole would be more a 7/10 (i.e.: good place for a quick bite on a day you don't want to cook, bad choice for a 'wine and dine' kinda night)."
/user_details?userid=Et6YLMrlyX2PCkqtwSVAug,Sabeena S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I have been to Kazu twice; the first time left me so enchanted while the second time left a bitter taste in my mouth. Before you read on for the entire experience, I will say that I recommend you visit this place. If you're in the Guy-Concordia area around lunch or dinner and you have to pick one place to eat, seriously, go here. Okay, back to the review. So the first time I came, I was on a date with my fiance. I lived one block away from this restaurant for two years and patiently watched the long queue day after day, week after week, before finally deciding to eat there myself. In fact, the day we went, miraculously, there was no queue! We were strolling the streets on a chilly April evening and stumbled into this restaurant for a Saturday night meal. One thing you should know, Kazu is TINY. I mean elbow rubbing, table sharing, tiny. We were seated at the bar, right in front of the maestro himself. We were offered a drink and I sprang for the Calpico. Boy was I glad I did, this drink is between a Horchata and a sparkling water- absolutely refreshing and delicious. You must order it if you go. After that we ordered some spring rolls, some oysters or other seafood, and the mains- the Shrimp burger and the Salmon Salad rice bowl. Nothing disappointed us here that night. Everything was simple, no frills, but beautifully executed and delicious. We left feeling satisfied, despite feeling a little broke (it's a bit pricey). The second time I visited, I had a totally different experience. My fiance and I decided to eat here with two friends, quite near closing time. From the moment we sat down, I felt rushed. Rushed to place my order, rushed to eat, rushed to even enjoy. The food lost its flavor, the excitement and intrigue of the tiny restaurant lost all its color. I was frustrated and disappointed at my disenchantment. Perhaps I'll go back again some day, probably not very soon."
/user_details?userid=cU0_WkFdQxonHpxrBG2iog,Nicholas J.,"Hampstead, Canada",5 star rating,So I came to this restaurant expecting some incredible Japanese cuisine due to the hype.I've been to Japan in the past. In fact I lived Osaka for several years to learn as much as I can about the culture. Obviously I know what authentic Japanese food tastes like and I didn't expect to find good Nippon inspired food in Montreal.There were way to many people in the restaurant and it was way too hot. Also I expected a little extra curtousy because I told them I'm a yelp reviewer but they treated me the same as everyone else (wow im not a gaijin like the rest of these people I even spoke to them with my osaka dialect).The food was okay I guess. I tried slurping my ramen like they do in my favorite anime's but I spilled most of it on my limited edition Himouto! Umaru-chan shirt which almost made me have a panic attack. At that point my day was ruined so I said arigato gozaimas to the staff and threw my money at them.Needless to say if you want real Japanese food you can only get it in Japan but if you're in Montreal I guess this will pass.

We waited in line for a half hour at roughly 5:30 on a Weds. We were given the menu right before entering. Sadly we were seated at the front window so everyone in line could see us eating and we felt like we were on display. We sat down and were asked right away what we wanted to drink if we knew what we wanted to order. I had literally just put my pocketbook down on the chair. I told the waitress we needed a few mins. She came back quickly with our water and asked if we knew what we wanted to order. Feeling rushed we ordered the chicken yakitori, pork cheeks, shrimp burger and Okonomiyaki. The food was good but not great.Part of the experience of a good restaurant is enjoying what your eating and feeling like people care about that. I felt like we were strictly a number, get them in and out as quickly as possible."
/user_details?userid=uHCyl1v-RkYegE_AsH2rog,Liliane V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I wanted to try every single item on the menu before confidently writing my review here, proud that the time has finally come. Hole in the wall, small and authentic Japanese homey feel resto, the servers and Kazu are always smiling and so happy it's contagious.Best dishes: tuna/salmon bowl (mix everything together and let all the delicious flavours synchronize - it literally gives me anxiety watching people eat layer by layer) Beef carpaccio (order 2, yeah because it's that good) Lamb chops & yogurt sauce (so perfectly tender and juicy without that overwhelming lamb smell) Homemade Ice cream (my favourite is the earl grey as it's not overly sweet, perfect palate cleanser) Lobster plate (seasonal dish so if you see it order it right away without blinking, unless you have allergies to shellfish of course)Those are just the few things I get religiously. You can order whatever you want or in the mood for at that time and you won't go wrong so don't worry about second guessing - trust me I've tried it all. But if you're not much of an adventurous foodie try the skewers, char grilled meat on a stick. Most of the dishes are fairly simple but so tastefully prepared. It's the sauces that take every dish from yummy to WOW; sauces and secrets that are inimitable.Tips: (1) Order for pickup to avoid waiting outside in line. (2) Arrive around 5:15-5:30pm to guarantee you'll be the first 25 in as soon as they open. (3) Be timely considerate, as it's a small restaurant meant for eating then leaving not hanging out for hours after your meal to finish your sake - let others get in to relish in this food gem too :)"

I read the reviews, I waited the hour in line, I anticipated coming here for about a year... I was expecting, like, the holy grail of Japanese food. Beyond that, even. I was expecting to taste flavours that don't even exist yet. And I was a little disappointed, but only because I had built Kazu up to an unattainable standard. I tried the shrimp burger and the 48 hour beef bowl; both were really, really good. I liked the shrimp burger a little more (believe the hype on this one, guys), but the 48 hour beef was really delicious. Super flavourful and fresh. And service was great, too. Quick and efficient, despite the small space. Overall I'd say this place is worth the wait - although the food didn't blow me away, it's still among the best Japanese I've had in the city so far. Plus I found their options to be super unique. I'm definitely going to brave the lineup again; there are so many other things I'm dying to try!"

Unfortunately, it was closed for spring break until Saturday. I came back here today around 5:20pm and despite the sub-zero temperature, around 15 people were already waiting in line! This hole-in-the-wall restaurant offers modern interpretations of classic Japanese dishes. From the classic ramen to the Korean-inspired Kalbi plate, there's something to satisfy everyone at Kazu. All of the food is super fresh, flavorful, and well-presented. Sea bass sashimi: This appetizer wasn't on the main menu but was written on one of the yellow handwritten pieces of paper on the wall. There are around 5 thinly sliced pieces of sashimi topped with salad and (yuzu?) viniagrette. Super refreshing dish! ($10)Yakitori & Tukune: These grilled skewers are dipped in the same teriyaki-like sauce. The meat isn't too dry and has a nice smoky flavor. ($4 & $5)Shrimp burger: I ordered this item on a whim cuz I wasn't sure what to get for my main course. I was thoroughly surprised by how well the flavors went together. The shrimp patty is super tender and flavorful. It is nicely paired with the crunchy lettuce, creamy sauce, and soft kaiser roll. ($12)Chirashi-zushi: Reinterpretation of the classic chirashi. The plating of this dish was absolutely beautiful. The salmon and tuna slices were topped with the same (yuzu?) viniagrette and served alongside salad greens and vinegared rice. ($15)Sakura ice cream: Super smooth and creamy. The vanilla soft-serve ice cream is topped with a pink syrup that tastes like a fruitier version of sake. My only complaint is that the serving size is so small that it leaves you wanting more. ($5)Pros: Friendly staff, fast service, lively environment, amazing food.Cons: Long lines, cramped restaurant."

Check, check, check. It should have been amazing- perhaps we just chose poorly from the menu? We got the ramen and the chirashi. The ramen was fine, but not particularly flavorful. The chirashi was not what I was expecting. The salmon was arranged carpaccio-style around a ball of rice with salad. It was dressed in a sauce that overwhelmed the taste of the fish. For me, chirashi is about the fish, and although the sauce was good, it didn't allow the fish to shine. I would probably come back and explore the menu, but it wasn't worth the hype."

A restaurant specializing in Japanese cuisine (with just a touch of fusion), Kazu is certainly one of the best dining experiences I've had in Montréal.I ordered the pork cheeks and the chirashi-zushi, and since I had a seat at the bar, it was so fun to see the chefs preparing the various dishes behind the counter! Although the pictures here make it seem like they don't give you much, by the end of the night I was stuffed to the core with deliciousness. The pork cheek to tortilla ratio was perfect and had just the right combination of pork flavor with creamy and smooth texture. I barely had to chew on anything! Then, the chirashi came, and I was blown away - again, like my other favorite spots in Montréal, they managed to serve a really good salad on top of the sushi rice, with just the right amount of dressing mixed into the leafy greens. I expected the rice to be just plain white rice but was pleasantly surprised when I tasted vinegar; it was also a great palate cleanser in between slices of sashimi. The tuna and salmon slices were of extremely high quality for what you would normally get in Montréal, and both varieties didn't taste too fishy (which is what normally throws me off with tuna). The slices were absolutely melt-in-your-mouth and divine, and I was really sad to finish the meal.Unfortunately, I was so full that I couldn't try their specialty house-made ice cream, but I'll be sure to make that a priority when I come here next time! :)"

We were seated at the bar - the heat on our face was overwhelming. The moment we sat down we were given menus. The menus were so sticky and covered in a layer of grease. It felt very unhygienic. We ordered the 48hr pork, shrimp burger and gyoza and two tall boys to deal with the radiating heat.5 mins after we ordered, the 48 hour pork thrown together landed on our table. This was probably the only dish that was satisfactory. The pork was tender and shredded very thin. However the bowl was completely over-seasoned and drenched with a soysauce based sweet sauce. We couldn't taste anything but sauce.Soonafter our food was further thrown together and the rest of our order arrived. The gyoza was mediocre and covered in grease. It was undercooked and had areas of raw flour.The shrimp burger was probably the worst. The patty was tiny and 1/3 of the bun it came with. It was smothered in sauce and more random sauce that I couldn't taste anything but sauce. My hands were covered in a layer of oil. We left it after a few bites.As I watched the chefs cook I noticed that every dish was just being drenched with layers of sauce over sauce. They were grilling really fatty pieces of pork belly and drenching it in oil (why? Its all pork fat already). Then they would douse it in more sauce.To be honest, this was a far cry from any proper Japanese food. We were very disappointed."

If Kazu was in a large space with fancy plush chairs, and waiters in suits instead of T-shirts the price point would be more than double and it would still be a good value.  Kazu is fine dining food, in a casual pub or restaur-bar setting. We started with the Eggplant appetizer which was perhaps my favorite item we ordered.  Our next three dishes were Japanese Curry (chicken),  beef short rib, and Salmon Tuna bowl were all hits.  The staff is upbeat and fun a feat given that this place is perpetually slammed with patrons.  The vibe is upbeat, we chatted with first-timers and past diners while we approached the front of the line about the stars of the menu.  Desert was vanilla maple ice cream with maple pop-rocks.  I have no idea how they can make pop-rocks out of maple syrup.  We washed things down with warm Sake.  The value is solid, the food superb.  Every dish was a hit.  I suggest go with a party of 3 or 4 order a ton of dishes and share everything.  With a 4.5 star rating more than half of this places reviews are 5 stars.  When you go you will see why.  I was wowed.  Kazu you rock.  Please expand, to a bigger space and open a few locations in Florida."

They both loved it. I tried a bite of the bowl with lettuce and it was super flavorable. The rice was warm and yummy. I had the shrimp burger and was surprised at how scrumptious it was. My only complaint is that you can't get the Ramen with vegetable stock. I would have loved to try it."

A line formed soon after we ordered. Our group had the ramen, curry ramen, 48 hour pork bowl, and the tuna/salmon bowl.

/user_details?userid=9eehtcnYhZAHug1uMI6iRQ,Kojo A.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"On extremely enthusiastic suggestion of a friend who used to live in Montreal, we went to Kazu. Like most good things in life, you must wait for the good stuff, which in this case meant an approximately 10 minute wait line. As we waited, we got a feel for the establishment. Personal space in Kazu is hard to come by, especially since the restaurant is already tiny. If you're thinking about bringing a group, I'd suggest keeping it limited to four, and even then, expect to wait longer for sufficient seating. They keep the decor super classy, with their menu hand written on sheets of paper attached all over the walls. All in all, you'll get a no frills, Japanese style feel, with waiters constantly bustling around.My meal started off with a small serving of some sort of meso esque soup. This was nice and dandy, but nothing compared to the main. After briefly watching the constant dance of the chefs from my bar seat, I was finally served the shrimp burger. The presentation of the dish is impressive, especially for a burger. It's served on a very large plate, as they dress the empty space with three different sauces: a cream sauce reminiscent to Thousand Island dressing, a dark viscous one with some tang, and an orange coloured sauce. When it comes to the burger itself you're served a sandwich with a plain bun, a black tiger atlantic shrimp patty, green leaf lettuce, and Rice Krispies. This burger takes ""melt in your mouth"" to the next level! It all starts with the impossibly soft shrimp patty. Honestly, it's unfair to compare the consistency of this patty to your standard beef patty. It's simply delightful. Second to the stellar patty is the three sauce combo, that adds to its comforting flavour. And ya, there are Rice Krispies scattered about, whose crunch you'll eventually notice after your initial bout of pleasure. Lastly, there's the plain bun, which probably comes straight from a grocery store. Am I complaining? If it allows them to keep those prices low and still provide a show stopper of a burger, hell no.I ended it all with some plum soft serve ice cream. I wanted their famous wasabi flavour, but they were sold out. It was delicious.Go to Kazu! If you have to wait, wait. If you have to sit in a lane and get bumped by passers by, sit there. If you have to sit by the window and have passers by watch you, enjoy your food as they jealously watch on, because they're right to be jealous."
/user_details?userid=5B5VU6-wA0ooGYJp1nNNEA,Richard B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I was actually excited to try this place out as I've seen the kind of monstrous lineup this place can have. Kazu is really small and the tables are tight. The staff were really friendly and you can occasionally hear them yell ""thank you"" to customers in Japanese, which is quite amusing. Because there was so much hype I was expecting amazing mouth watering food. Unfortunately for me, most dishes were just about mediocre. My appetizer consisted of pork cheek paste served with tortillas. It was okay but I think it would make a better snack than an appetizer and the presentation was a bit messy. I had beef galbi as my main which is korean BBQ short ribs which was served with plain white rice and salad on top. The beef itself was good and well marinated but the salad was really subpar. The salad was cut into strips and appeared boring to me. Also, the dressing was minimal and nothing special. My friend had the ramen and he told me that it wasn't mind-blowing neither. My favorite dish throughout the course was probably the homemade ice cream with wasabi sauce. The waitress told me that they make their own wasabi and it shows. This green Japanese mustard was smooth and it goes surprisingly well with their homemade vanilla ice cream. I didn't get too much of that kick in the nose that you get from commercial wasabi and the flavors were fresh and fragrant. But overall, Kazu to me was just an ordinary visit. I don't know why there's so much hype about this place. Maybe I have to give Kazu another try during diner to change my mind. I will update this review upon my next visit."

Forget about going to a fancy place for a nice long dinner. This place is... Come, eat and go (because there is a line of people outside waiting). But let me tell you... IT IS WORTH IT. This was my third time and everytime I get surprised with the freshness ans quality of their plates. Luckily me and my girlfriend got there early before they even open and got in line for about 10 minutes. So... The thing is that if it is your first time you might think that they are pushing you to order and get the hell out. In some sort of way they are... But is because they want everyone to get a chance to try them. Ok ok... Enough chit chat! Getting into the food. As appetizers we ordered the beef carpaccion with a fresh salad and the egg plant dip (wich is my favorite). The texture and combination of flavors in this dip is to die for. For the main meal I ordered the beef kalbi plate which are barbequed beef short ribs with their special sauce served with rice and salad. (Dont imagine a thick rib... This is a thin rib with lots of flavor). My girlfriend ordered the lobster wich is not on the menu but you will find that there are some items that you can order from the wall. This dish we were licking the plate as it was amazing. It came with a smashed potatoes that had a bit of their kazu sauce that gave it a completly different taste as from what we usually get when ordering some smashed potatoes. If ever in downtown montreal and you see people lining up to a small place in St. Catherine... That is KAZU!"
/user_details?userid=USG1wkzku03asNV8TQZetw,Kat V.,"Scottsdale, AZ",5 star rating,Every dishes were so good and memorable. The 48hr pork bowl reminded me of my childhood comfort food. Raw scallops were so fresh and beef tongues lightly cooked with the kitchen torch were so soft and unique. The black cod with rice was delicious with tangy sauce and earthy fish bone purée. The chef was funny and ensure that we knew what we ate. The desserts were to die for. We had black tea ice cream and green tea panna cotta. We were glad that we got there 15mins minutes before open because we could get the seat right away and no need to wait further.

The inside is so crowded and there's barely any room, which is mostly why I subtracted a star. That took away much of the joy for me, but I did enjoy the food. Another reason why I was disappointed is that they only serve ramen, what I mainly went there for, for lunch and they accept Canadian cash only.Galbi - get it! It's packed with flavor, beautiful looking, and more importantly absolutely delicious. Okanomyaki - ok. Very flour-y.Hazelnut ice cream - squeal! I cannot believe this is lactose free. It was so flavorful and delicious. Overall, I would definitely go back next time I'm in Montreal. Definitely have to try the ramen and get dessert again!Happy eating!"

Everything about it from the dishes to the price make you one satisfied person. Best dish is the shrimp burger in my opinion. Amazing surprise is the soft serve with different flavors we had the rum raisin SO GOOD! Only problem is finding a spot in this hole in the wall...its a hard one. You sort of have to luck out. I have also recommend the ribs which are great and the tuna crispy noodle salad which is really good!

Not being able to eat pork, I was immediately very limited in what I could order. I got the mixed green salad and the shrimp burger. That was the best salad! Delicious, everyone enjoyed the huge serving and interesting mix of veggies and rice crispies with the yummy Japanese dressing. The shrimp burger was... weird. While the concept was great, I just did not enjoy that patty. It was too thick and pink! A little on the pricey side, our bill came up to $109 for not much. I also tried the rice balls -- NOT GOOD. Flavorless and weird. Would try it again though to see whether it was a fluke."

They seem to work fast but not everything seems clean. My friend and I ordered a tuna and salmon bowl (which is Kazu's most popular dish) we also had a crispy BBQ chicken tortilla salad to share. It was not as crispy as we thought, but it was still very yummy! We ordered the yuzu soda drink (non alcoholic). It was way too sweet and we ended up not finishing it."

I read it is the spot to go and we did see the lineups earlier on or stay so we decided to try it.  Friday night. We were there for 5:30 open and were not lucky enough to get in on the first seating. We waited a 1/2 hr and finally got in.  We were seated at the bar and it was very efficient that's for sure. What I do not like is that I feel that we were rushed.My husband had the Goyza.  Not the best he has had.  I had the pork cheeks (was like tuna blobs on the plate; not bad just not great or different). Main meal:  I've heard a lot about the shrimp burger so that was my choice and it was great!  Husband had sashimi salad which was good but the down side was it was presented with a sort of French dressing. Wth?  I like the place   I like the food.I do not like the wait and then the feeling of the rush to get outThe food is mostly great but hit and miss in some areas.

The first time when I tried going, there was a HUGEEE line up, and there I thought in my head, ""Dang this place must be amazing!"" But regardless, I left because the wait was way too long and a girl's gotta eat. I finally tried coming here again during lunch hours with a friend. There was barely a line so that earned them a star. The people there spoke fluent Japanese (according to my Japanese speaking friend) and she said everything the atmosphere at least, was an authentic Japanese setting. I ordered their ramen and was excited to try it, but boy was I disappointed. The soup was borderline cold. Not the mention there was way too much oil for my liking. I really wanted to like this place, but this ramen just doesn't work for my palette. Perhaps dinner is better? Or I just came on a bad day? I don't know.

/user_details?userid=RU1sn0X5YE6ir04Bp-hWPA,Ron F.,"Brampton, Canada",2 star rating,"There is a disturbing trend spreading in the restaurant industry. What I'm talking about is restaurants that do not take reservations and force their patrons to wait for hours on the street in lines for a chance to try their fare.What these restaurants are in fact saying through these actions is that they think their patrons' time is worthless. They would rather waste their patrons time and not accept reservations in order to build a line outside their restaurant thus building hype than respect their patrons' time and take a reservation.I encourage everyone who takes the time and waits in these lines to recoup some of the cost of their wasted time by leaving a tip of exactly 0. If they ask why simply tell them that it is a slap in the face, an absolute insult, to be made to stand in line while they refuse to accept a simple reservation. After all, a tip is a reflection of restaurant quality, service AND experience! This response will not take long to get noticed and elicit change once the staff notices their tips decline and put pressure on management to fix the problem.As for a review of this place food is 4 stars, actual wait staff service is 4 stars, customer service is 1 star, experience, comfort and decor is 1 star.

Nothing special to look at but these guys are here to make food so really, who cares? My only negative is that the space is really tight so if you're the anti-social type who doesn't like their space invaded then this might be the place for you. If you plan to come by for dinner then you better get there at least 20 minutes before they open because you'll definitely be waiting for a table. The goods: I had the Japanese ravioli and the shrimp burger. Both were super amazing. I'd ordered both again in a heartbeat. Maybe make the shrimp patty a little bigger. Service: Good, considering these guys are literally running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Price point: The ravioli were $5 and I think the burger was $12."

Then I had the Sea Bass salad - bass was perfect and the portion could feed 2 but I still managed to chow down the whole thing. Great presentation with the grilled flour paste and sesame seeds - makes a brittle that is folded onto the fish. Then there's the eggplant puree along with aforementioned sauces with dried seaweed and dried parsley sprinkled all over. It's a salad but it comes with rice. Theres also a tomator salsa with torn pieces of fresh mint.They also have homemade ice cream. It was good but I was a little disappointed when it was Vanilla ice cream sprinkled with powdered green tea flavouring. I think with all the dedication to presentation, I found that to be quite anticlimatic.. That and their yakitori presentation.. Two tiny skewers dipped in sauce on a white plate. meh.Tips:1) tea costs you money2) open concept kitchen, love it. Especially watching the chef and sous-chef create a bevy of colours and sauces right in front of you.

The service is great. They churn out dishes really fast. We ordered the 48 hour pork (Buta-Don), Beef bibimbap, shrimp burger & the tuna belly.  The Buta-Don is stewed tender pork sliced with onions on rice. The Bibimbap was awesome. Perfectly cooked tasty beef with homemade pickles & eggs sunny side up. The shrimp burgers were good. The spicy mayo adds the zing. The Tuna belly is ginormous. Enough for two people.  The fish here is really fresh and yummy too. All the dishes are  full of flavor. The only thing that bothered me is that they don't serve Ramen for dinner.

Kazu is a relatively small and narrow so seating is a bit limited, however, I think it's what makes it unique. With the restaurant being so compact it's hard not too feel the energy all around you. My friend and I were lucky to get a seat without having to wait, but just seconds after we arrived there was a line forming for a table. Given it's limited seating, it's definitely not a good place for large groups. I assume the wait time can be hit or miss.The menu is not extensive but there is a good variety. From their rice dishes to ramen, you should be able to find something that will satisfy your pallet. What is also unique is the menu items posted on the walls with what appears to be sticky notes.The ramen I ordered was really good, close to being perfect with the exception of the noodles. The broth alone was bliss. It had a depth of flavor and was not too salty. The chasu or otherwise known as pork was absolutely tender and fatty. The chasu came in a pair and just melted in my mouth. They were so good I had had to strategically portion each bite so I could savior it. If I ever return to Montreal, I would definitely come back to Kazu."

Almost unheard of it Montreal! Husband and I shared the eggplant dip, vegetable bowl and japanese vegetable pancake.. Absolutely amazing flavours and textures! A delight for any foodie!! I just wish they had a few more veg options, but still, a solid restaurant to try out! We ended with the green tea ice cream- so good! All this plus 2 beers for 50$ - cant complain!! Highly recommend!!"

It isn't fancy and probably the only place I'll stand inline at but once you're seated you remember why. Tuna tartare bowl is a must have as is the lamb. Only thing is they only come in 3's so it doesn't make for a good sharing plate, which this restaurant definitely is. Have the same ice cream with a side of matcha for dessert, you can't go wrong."
/user_details?userid=OtMW3wzS-akygZm7erZ3qA,Kevin N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I recommend that you order take out for Kazu, unless you like not having much space when you eat and having to eat quickly and then leave. The food is good, especially the ramen, which is only offered during lunch. I think that the ramen and the 48 hour pork are the dishes you must order when going to Kazu.Service is efficient, waiters are really nice and polite, and even though the wait can be long at times, I think it is still worth it to go and eat inside at least once."

This place is small and busy. We lined up for about 10mins to be seated. We ordered a eggplant dip, a red snapper bowl, and a teriyaki chicken burger. The eggplant dip tastes so good when you roll it up with crunchy fried rice by the pita bread. The red snapper is well cooked. The fish skin is crispy while the meat is tender but not in a raw way. Teriyaki chicken is my favorite, however, what I had today was not the way I like it. First of all, the chicken was ground instead of a whole piece of chicken breast or leg. Plus, it's way too salty. I would probably not order it again, but I'll definitely try the supper menu someday."

I've not tried anything I didn't live. The only downside is that there is always a line and it's a tiny place. The staff is super friendly and prompt. Since there's always a line, don't expect to hang around after your meal. That would be plain ol rude. And the people waiting in line will probably stare at you through the window."

However my friend was visiting last weekend and I thought this place is worth going. I was not surprised to see a line at as early as 5:10pm. We were let in around 5:25. Everyone that was let in at the same time was super experienced. They didn't even looked at the menu and ordered right away and what they ordered seemed super delicious and they finished way sooner than my friend and I. We ordered a salmon appetizer, yakitori, chicken bimbimbap and ice cream. All of them were delicious. Besides the regular items on the menu, they had more written on the wall. I would definitely try those next time. I would suggest sitting at the bar if you are only one person or with one friend since you could see how the chefs work in the kitchen - they cooperated with each other very well!"

Usually I'm a little skeptical about really popular places, but I just managed to squeeze it in before leaving and I'm really glad I did!  The food was amazing. I had the pork cheek as an appetizer and the tuna and salmon bowl as the main meal and the flavors and textures on everything were great. The service was super speedy, all the staff was extremely pleasant, and while you definitely feel the sense of urgency that comes with being in a small and very busy restaurant it weirdly adds to the experience rather than takes away from it. I got in literally 1 minute after they were opened for lunch and the place was already packed. Luckily since it was just me, I was able to be seated at the bar immediately, but you should probably anticipate a wait. Everything moves so fast though that I can't imagine the wait would be too ridiculous if you're not going during peak hours. The wait is definitely worth it."

If your legs are prone to going to sleep in small chairs, beware. Despite that, this place gets five stars due to the following-- Wonderful, wonderful food. Seriously. No, better than that. The crab burger was good enough that I'd consider committing a minor felony for one. Yakitori was easily misdemeanor-worthy, possibly beyond that. - Super attentive and friendly waitstaff. - The food, as mentioned above, is awesome.

I was really happy because it was way shorter than my expectation. The restaurant is really small. When customers full the restaurant, it's really crowdy. We sat near to the window, which is good because it's away from the bar and there were a lot of cooking smoke over there. The service is really good! The food was brought to us in a short time.

Tuna & Salmon TarTar plus the Gyoza.I was walking by & saw a line outside this Tiny restaurant that was made up of 10-15 people waiting to be seated for dinner in a cold 35 degrees. I immediately Yelped and sure enough the reviews justified this wait.While the Gyoza was phenomenal with a great sauce and the perfect mix spiciness & sweet, the Tuna & Salmon Tartar on Rice wasn't flavorful enough to justify 4 stars.This place was packed with people looking very satisfied with a wife variety of food being ordered so I couldn't get myself to downgrade them to a 3 & again the Gyoza was special.They don't take American Credit or Debit, so you'll need to go next door and use the ATM."

(Visit my page to read my other top 5 reviews!)Kazu has it all - Creativity, taste and atmosphere. I love coming here since they have daily specials that are always surprisingly good. I usually get the Tuna Salmon Bowl, which is absolutely delicious. The texture of the salad mixed with the soft sushi rice and fresh tuna is just perfection at its finest. The portions are quite generous, so be careful of how much you order! Their earl grey ice cream is just a taste of heaven. This is one of the places I miss the most!Trust me when I say this is the place to go for all you 'food instagrammers'. The presentation is out of this world and some of the finest I have seen. What is amazing is that the taste is just as good! Very highly recommended and must go place if you are ever in Montreal.Warning there may be a long lineup, but definitely worth it!"

By no means am I hating on this place, the food was good and the waitstaff was sweet but why are we all waiting in line for 40 minutes? Do they serve the Montreal equivalent to Japanese cronuts here? Seriously. In brief, this is how I feel: Our dishes arrived fast and beautiful like Adriana Lima in a Ferrari.Our waitress was stressed the f'out and running around like a mad woman.Our libations were forgotten about.Our table was sandwiched between to others and I could not move.Our bill was non-offensive but the whole experience felt exhausting. Let's take a moment for an exasperated sigh.*phew*Anyway, if you happen find your self here go for the shrimp burger, it's helluva good. The salad and bowls with the straw-crunchy goodness were also visually appeasing and top notch with the exception of the sashimi bowl. We ate, we laughed but once we were close to being done we were getting ornery stares from those waiting to be seated. Fine, let me push 4 people out of the way so I can get out of here."

Many other reviews said that it was worth the wait, but let me tell you it was not. I typically have low expectations for the vegetarian/vegan options at meat-heavy restaurants, but this was a new level. I ordered the vegetable bowl which said it came with rice, veggies, tofu, and chili sauce. When it arrived at our table, it was essentially a few scoops of rice with COLD tofu and glorified salad on top. I would definitely not recommend going to this restaurant with your vegetarian or vegan friends."

We sat on the bar and we're immediately greeted by the chefs. The portions were reasonable (I wasn't stuffed but full), and for sharing an appetizer and two meals we ended up paying about 25$ per person. Order: Calamari salad/Highly recommend, Shrimp burger/Delicious and Rice & Pork bowl/Flavourful. The ingredients were fresh but the real magic was the presentation and the flavours of the meals. Arigato indeed!My first review here, thought I'd share since I'm usually out and about.

Even when I made a fool of myself today shouting at an adorable young couple leaving the door open a little too long for my liking (it was -30 today, guys c'mon!) and then low and behold appeared their new born baby (I cracked a joke and referred myself to being an A-hole and all was well in the world again as we all chuckled over my selfishness.) So right off the bat, we know Kazu is a great place to bring the entire family and or juvenile delinquents such as myself. No stranger to this place, we got the 48 hour pork split three ways (OMG) and pork ramen (tofu ramen for me) topped with an Ichiban beer to cleanse the palette. I would of eaten more but these days, I eat like a bird. This place rules so hard and I recommend it to anyone if you are down for the culinary voyage to Japan where you will be hosted by the most wonderfully cool and composed staff. Enjoy!"

The small little restaurant has a fun atmosphere and it was overall a lovely dining experience (once I was warmed up again that is!). I would definitely start off with a green tea it's perfection. As a vegetarian diner the waitress was quick to offer recommendations which was great! The service was quick and everyone really enjoyed their food. I got the Nabemono vegetarian hot pot which was fun to try; the ingredients were fresh and the tofu was silky and just a treat. Overall the dish wasn't too flavourful but was subtle and unique. Not sure if I would return soon but it is definitely a place to check out if you're looking for something fresh.

We ordered the aubergine starter, chicken gyozas, pork kebabs and tofu kimchi salad, which were all delicious. When we finished these, we were promptly served our main courses - a Korean pork bulgogi-like dish called Buta-Don, a bibimbap with the massive beef rib and a Vegetable Bowl.

I was in Montreal with some friends and we were looking for a place to eat. We came across Kazu while looking for places to try. The 4.5 stars with over 400 reviews really caught our eye. Unfortunately, Kazu didn't open until 5:30 pm that day. We decided that we would try Kazu the following day for dinner as we already had dinner plans that night. The next day we thought we were being diligent by arriving right at 5:30 pm when Kazu opens; surely we would get a table right away. Boy were we wrong! We arrived at 5:30 pm and there was already a line up outside of the door!  We decided to stay and wait - the food has to be great if there is already a line up. I am glad we stayed! The food was fantastic! Everything we ordered was delicious! We ordered the house made tofu (available only on Sundays), beef kalbi, salmon and tuna salad rice bowl, pork cheek pate with tortilla, and the Australian sea bass. The house made tofu is served in a soy based sauce. It is smooth and reminds me of dessert tofu except savoury. It was very good but not the best house made tofu I have had. The beef kalbi was very flavourful and was served with some rice and a side of salad. The salmon and tuna salad rice bowl was served in a large bowl of lettuce with salmon and tuna sashimi served over a rice bowl-sized amount of sushi rice. The dressing for the salad was delicious and complemented everything in the dish. The pork cheek pate with tortilla was a very unique dish. The pork cheek pate had the consistency of fine tuna salad. The pate was placed in 3 sections on the plate with the tortilla in the middle.  Finally, we had the Australian sea bass. It was cooked perfectly served over river with lettuce over top of the fish along with some homemade sesame ""cookies"". The entire dish was cooked in a red sauce. I'm not 100% sure what type of sauce it was but there were some roasted red peppers in the dish so it may have been a red pepper sauce. Whatever it was the dish was fantastic! I have not eaten sea bass that was cooked so perfectly and had such a great flavour in a long time. This dish has renewed my love for sea bass!The place itself is quite small. It is reminiscent of food establishments in Japan and Asia where it is a ""hole-in-the-wall"" with fantastic food.  The size of the restaurant is probably why there is a line up as soon as the restaurant opens. Given my experience, I will definitely be eating there again the next time I am in Montreal."

The restaurant has an open concept kitchen that allows you to see how they prep and cook all the food, which adds to Kazu's charm!We tried the shrimp burger as well as the ramen (made with hand pulled noodles) and BOOM! Flavor explosion, my mouth was crying tears of joy. Super friendly and quick service. The prices are  very reasonable for the high quality of food!Go check it out, you won't regret it."

We had one beef galubi, one veggie bowl, pickled veggies, and a tuna and salmon bowl. It was a lot of food but at the end of the dinner, none of us felt bloated at all. The meats was juicy and flavorful, the salad bowls were complex and crisp. The one and only problem is how popular this place is compared to how much space they have! There was a huge line out the door. Once we finally got in, it felt cramped and crowded. We felt a bit rushed to finish our delicious food."

There usually is a line-up, depending on what time you go it can be from 15-45mins. The place is really small and can get hot but the food is totally worth it. All the workers are Japanese and super friendly. Three dish suggestions:Tuna Salmon Bowl: I love it. It's a bit like a salad with some crunchy stuff on it and raw tuna and salmon sliced pieces mixed with a vinegar rice. Beef Carpaccio: wow...I don't know what marinade they use but it's absolutely delicious! The beef is sliced really thin and put in a marinade with salad. Ramen: It's only available at lunchtime. The noodles are handmade...though I didn't understand from the chef whether they hand make it or order it from someone who does. Regardless, it's has the perfect chewiness and the pork they give with it is super tender. I'd suggest going and sharing the dishes with friends so you can have a variety of everything. It's not cheap but I think the prices are fairly reasonable for what you get. Kazu is a must!"

While the food and ambiance is good, the wait time and pricing for the food...not so great! Waiting could take up to at least 45 minutes if you are planning to dine in the afternoon. The food here is pretty overpriced considering that each meal is at least $10-17. I would only go here on a special occasion and indulge in lovely Japanese food."

I arrived at 5:40 and the waiting line was already about 10+ people. Waited exactly 1 hour to get in. But the food was great! I had Tuna and Salmon Bowl. It's really really good! I wanted the homemade tofu but it's already sold out! Staff were so nice and smile all the time. Definitely worth the looooong wait! Hope I can get the tofu next time!

After all the hype around the restaurant I was ready to be blown away by tasty and authentic foods. Many people had said the tuna salmon bowl was the best option so I opted for that as my lunch. The bowl took the guy about 3 seconds to make which makes you feel as though the 15$ price tag isn't a great deal. The taste, meh. Nothing special. Probably won't go again.Though the staff is friendly and greets you immediately as well as says bye. But throughout our meal we felt constant pressure. The second your fork hit the table they removed your plate without you barely having time to breathe. For a lunch that came close to 20$ after tax and tip I was expecting much more especially due to all the hype around this place."

/user_details?userid=viKDBldtPQMQXPf5NYFBew,Lucy H.,"Santa Barbara, CA",5 star rating,"This review is long overdue. And it's a shame too since Kazu is - still, in my my mind - one of the best dining experiences I've had. The dishes offered here were all so colorful, so flavorful, and so thoughtful. We ate not a single bad dish. I'd describe this restaurant as serving Modern Japanese cuisine since there weren't really elements of fusion from other cuisine. Their food is complex visually and in taste. It's a tiny restaurant with a tight dining area. Three of us squeezed into a little space right up the front window where people gazed at us and our table. There was a line outside the restaurant, about 20-30mins long. This was remarkable since it was raining. But the locals said for their food, it was worth the wait. And it was! Everything is served as sort-of a small plate (tapas style). You could eat many dishes as an entree but I think they're meant for sharing. We sampled all of the the top dishes as shown in Yelp photos. Also Kazu has a board with Specials from which we picked some items. Again, each dish that arrived to our table was so delicious and was devoured immediately. Even the tiny ice creams for dessert were unforgettable!"

I visited this restaurant recently and was appalled by how disrespectfully the owner treated his staff.

Prime location if you're a foodie and you enjoy seeing meals prepped. The chefs are artists! Not only is every single meal we ordered absolutely divine, but the plating of each dish is a work of art worthy of chefs table! Our only regret is not getting there earlier since several of the dishes we wanted to sample were sold out. We ordered the eggplant dip, pork cheek dip, chicken gyozas for appys and for mains, #29 (beef ribs with rice and salad), the bibimbap and the infamous 48 hour pork. I don't think we left a morsel!! The place is tiny and very casual, so expect to wait in line. They are lightning fast with the meals yet you don't feel they're rushing you. They're all so friendly.

The wait times range from 20min - 1hr depending on what time you hit it up, which may be long for some. On the other hand, service is friendly and food comes out quicker than you can say Itadakimasu ! For some the fast eating environment is off-putting so be warned if you're planning to dilly dally and take your time.  The price ranges from 7-25$ a dish. -Food-Tuna Salmon Bowl: I've been here two times and have ordered this and it never fails to satisfy me. The components are simple but together they are delicious. It consist of (from the bottom) vinegary rice, salmon and tuna tartare mixed in sauce,  mushrooms, carrots, lettuce, sesame seeds, and fried noodles? on topped off with sauce. I think for some it would be a bit salty and too saucy, but I like it and its a fun way to enjoy fresh fish. Shrimp Burger: Ordered it because I am a shameless hype follower. It tastes like a Big Mac but fancier, so that means good. I swear the sauce is Mac sauce but have yet to confirm.  The shrimp is fried and gives a fun taste to your usual burger. Pork Neck: I ordered this and remember that it was an intimidating dish and was difficult to eat  without being messy (THEREFORE do not order it on a date).  It was good in a sense were the meat is tender and well seasoned but not absolutely to die for. Sake: They have a decent selection and not bankruptcy inducing prices to get you feeling all warm &fuzzy."

It's quite small and inconspicuous, but the interior is cozy and charming. I had ramen for lunch, and it was fantastic. The noodles were perfect, and the broth was tasty without being overly salted. I can definitely understand why people queue for a table. What made my lunch experience truly special was sitting at the bar. Although a table might have been more comfortable, it was so cool to watch the chefs prepare my ramen as well as other dishes. A definite must if you're visiting Montreal. If you don't mind waiting in line, dinner has more options, but even the lunch menu offers lots of choices and although it's full the wait is likely to be shorter."

What I was met with was a very welcoming and efficient restaurant that was hard to find fault with.It's always packed with a lineup out the door and a stream of takeouts coming and going yet despite that, we were seated and ordered quickly. the food came out super fast (in fact, as soon as I ordered beef carpaccio the waitress immediately leaned behind me to their fridge and took out a serving to be prepared by the chefs. That's hella efficient.)For $52 plus tax we had two mains and three appetizers, some ordered off their specials on the wall. (I'm always told by Japanese friends to order wall menu items and it hasn't failed me yet!)the only reason I can't give five stars is because the tuna/salmon bowl, while good and filling and massive, was missing a little something something.

We had the gyoza, which was grilled, and the yummy crunchy parts left on, and a couple of chu-hi cocktails to start with. It's still hard (although getting easier!) to find a bar that serves shochu, so this was really exciting. We also had the tuna and salmon bowl, and although you might first wonder where your fish is, it's hiding under all the leafy greens. I enjoyed both the salmon and the tuna, but tuna will always be my one true fishy love, and I kinda wished they had a tuna-only option. We also had the okonomiyaki and a couple of yakitori skewers. One of the best parts of the meal was watching, and smelling, all the different foods being cooked behind the bar. If you're a small party, and you have the chance, sit at the bar!One last bit of advice - although they do take debit cards and cash, they do not take credit cards in any way shape or form. Don't screw up like I did and have to run and get some cash halfway through the meal. We came back the next day for lunch, because I really wanted to try their ramen. We lined up a few minutes before they opened, and we still ended up waiting a good 30 minutes for seats at the bar. Even though I try to order different things than my partner, we both got the ramen because it looked so good! The broth was fantastic, and the pork was so soft and juicy. My only issue was that the noodles were a little thicker than I usually see in ramen, and I thought they were a little undercooked. Other than that, two perfect meals in Montreal."

It was actually made up of mostly shrimp. I wasn't as big of a fan of the sauce, which was a bit vinegary. Both dishes came with some lettuce, so not a lot of vegetables to pair with the meat.

Granted, I did not have high expectations coming in. I came in hungry, tired, & wanting some food. Also came in with the understanding that it wont be nyc level or la or even chicago.  got to experience kazu from the bar.The good: -Food comes out fast. Less than five minute wait from ordering. -Nice enough workers. The bad: -Long lines in cold, rainy weather.-Sat at the bar and found that NO food was really grilled or made on the spot. In fact, all of the food was premade and essentially assembled (hence fast turnaround time from your order). The shrimp burger was a premade patty heated on the grill but it didn't sizzle sizzle like all burgers should!! And the pork for their ramen was precooked and heated under the stove.... Pretty disappointing that they don't even sear it at any point. -The 48 hour pork was essentially pork over rice. It was much like the food at Yoshinoya (Japanese fast food) but definitely underwhelming and not that warm. -Salmon and Tuna bowl was more rice than anything with small bite-size pieces of salmon and tuna. It was not bad but it fell short of anything standout.All in all, having any sort of Asian cuisine is a break from the heavy (albeit delicious) food of Montreal. Would I come back? And have to wait?? Not really. This place is packed and does well on its own so people must not be too demanding. However, I will just bring a nice shin ramen cup and be sated the next time I am i. the city hankering for something Asian."

Best to try and get there early and get seated first, or come at some really weird time. Don't forget that they are closed on Tuesdays (?). Pretty much everything on the menu is great, and it's totally worth the money. It is SO delicious hereThe owner and chef of this restaurant is from Japan used to work at Toque. If you don't know what Toque is, it's a pretty fancy restaurant in Montreal. Needless to say, this restaurant is great because of his magic touch!"

We went with friends, and I would suggest that, as a group of 4, you get there as early as possible. We went on a Sunday and got there just before 7. Unfortunately, all there was not a big line-up, there were two groups of 4 before us, so we ended up waiting over an hour. People in couples got in before us.Once we got inside the door (it was starting to get chilly early April), we ordered a pitcher of beer. The waitress was happy to bring us this and didn't complain that we were blocking the door (we did try our best to not be too much in people's way). We were finally seated right near the door, on a tiny table, but it was well worth it.Pork cheeks - OMG! This is a little piece of culinary heaven. It actually reminded me quite a bit of rillettes de porc in flavour, though the texture is more like cretons (smoother even). I should order this takeout in large quantities and keep it in my fridge. Not that it would last long.Homemade tofu - since it was Sunday, we opted for it and it was amazingly silky and smooth.Gyoza - good dumplings, but not better than I've had elsewhere.Tuna and Salmon rice bowl - refreshing, delicate, lovely mix of flavours.Beef galbi - a bit different from what I expected as it didn't look like the Korean versions I've had before, but it was very tasty, with a more subtle sauce.Tuna belly - yum, yum, yum, yum, yum! If you don't do fat or bones, you probably won't enjoy this. If you're Asian, you'll love it.We shared these, and finished with the ice-cream (it's just soft-serve, with a topping - I had sake, which I enjoyed). With two pitchers of beer, it was more expensive than other Asian places, especially since we only had three appetizers and three main courses, coming to $200. But, honestly, I'd do it all again."

The place is pretty small, so the line was out the door at 8pm on a Saturday night. We ordered the shrimp burger to share; I ordered the tuna and salmon bowl as my entree. I can definitely see why the shrimp burger is such a popular item -- the shrimp patty was seasoned perfectly and the accompanying mayo was delicious! My half of the burger had a little too much bun, but overall it was flavorful enough that I didn't mind. The tuna and salmon bowl was a hefty portion: tuna and salmon tartare on a bed of rice with crispy rice noodles, lettuce and some pickled veggies. Loved it! Definitely a welcome change to all the French cuisine.Note: cash only.-L."
/user_details?userid=BnywXOmsaeNYIKJQWaQIlQ,Sharon Z.,"Foster City, CA",5 star rating,"In my entire life of food-journeying, Kazu is the only place I willingly and knowingly stood outside for 30+ minutes shivering in sub -15C temperature at night waiting for a seat. Totally worth it. This is our fourth time here since we discovered this completely unique place with masterful culinary experience. The joint is small but all their dishes are tremendous (in term of quality and taste). The menu is rotating all year round aside from a few signature dishes that have established their fame (e.g. shrimp burger, 48 hour pork, ramen) and typically they are hanging on the wall handwritten (and/or handdrawn), a homey and cozy touch to a small place of wonders. After raiding through the entire menu the last time. We decided to try several new things this time around. We've been eyeing the beef kalbi while we waited outside, the thin slice of beef ribs shining with its marinate is an ever enticing sight. And having been deprived of raw sashimi for the past few months, chirashi-zushi sounded like ambrosia. Our foods came pretty quickly within a few minutes. Thinly sliced salmon and tuna lines bottom of my plate, four pieces each, the gorgeous shine indicates top notch quality and freshness. One savory bite of ultra thinly sliced tuna created an exploding sensation for my taste buds, the raw flavor with the smooth texture of the tuna accompanied by sesame seeds and a light citrusy sauce. The fish is extremely fresh with no 'fishy' taste at all. The beef kalbi is of the same caliber. With the scent of a smoked BBQ rib, one usually expects a the meat to be overcooked just a tab. But not this, the residual tantalizing smell of the BBQ is present for a mouth watering lure and the thinly sliced, marinated and glazed short ribs still attached to the bones are evenly cooked to perfection. From the first bite of the beef kalbi, boyfriend went 'WHOAAA, SO GOOD' (a day later, is still recounting the taste of beef kalbi the same way). Both dishes comes with a side of salad with a delicious light salad dressing and rice. Like hungry bears, we devoured our dishes, not wanting our tongue to separate from the heavenly tastes and textures for even a second.Needless to say, another beyond excellent meal in our tummy courtesy of Kazu."

About a 45 minute wait to get a table.Disappointed that the ramen was not available (only available for lunch).Gyoza (that they call ravioli on the menu) - delicious!Chicken karaage tortillas - delicious!Short beef ribs - delicious!But the Japanese style bibimbap and the 48 hour pork was nothing special.Just didn't seem very authentic but what was I expecting from Japanese tortillas and bibimbap ;p

It was enough to make a grown man weep it was so beautiful.  So yeah, there's something I'll be trying on my next visit."
/user_details?userid=4sCNqow8kIIblhzZN1CqYQ,Mahziba M.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,The only reason I haven't given Kazu 5 stars is because of it's size and the long wait. We got there a little after 5:30pm (they open at 5:30pm) and there was already a line up of 15ppl ahead of us. The dining area is very small so if you are a bigger group then you will have to be spilt up like we did. That being said it was some of the freshest food I've had and also the most tasty Japanese I've ever had. Definitely worth the visit. I do hope that they expand into a bigger location. They definitely have the following to make it a big success.

The servers are VERY fast and efficient, especially for working in such a small space. Get there early because once we were served our food, the line outside almost doubled in size. With a party of four, half of us ordered the 40-hour pork bowl, while the other half got the salmon/tuna bowl. I thoroughly enjoyed the prok bowl; the flavour s were spot on and so satisfying, but I found the salmon/tuna salad was a tad greasy for my taste. Either way, it was still an enjoyable meal for a reasonable price. Savour it while you're there, no matter how busy it is!"
/user_details?userid=3x-kbXQUhrsWOcp8mUimbw,Jenn C.,"Whitchurch-Stouffville, Canada",5 star rating,"This place rocks. Yes there is always a line (about 50 minutes for 4 people), yes it is the tiniest space (say hello to your neighbouring tables.. or sit at the bar - definitely more space there!), and yes it is quite loud, but the food is so delicious! It is a Japanese pub-style after all so it's good idea to order a bunch of stuff and share (you may not have space on your table for it though..). My favourite was the grilled pork neck (with what I think must be tare sauce) - be forewarned, it's messy, and it will be because you will be gnawing at it to get to ever last yummy bite! They also serve chicken skin and chicken cartilage yakitori which is awesome!! The lunch menu is a little different - a smaller menu that you can peruse as you're waiting in line (can't get those awesome skewers, and yes there will still be a line) but equally as good. The ramen is delicious (the super happy guy behind the bar - who my brother thinks must be the owner - says that they make the noodles themselves - kudos to them; they truly are delicious!) and so is the 48-hour pork rice dish (melt-in-your-mouth onions...). They are also very efficient with getting the order to you quickly.I did find it a little bit pricey, but the quality is good and the food is well-prepared and innovative, so I think that is worth the price.Go, definitely go - the wait in line is totally worth it! I wish I could be back there right now :)"

The trick to getting a seat is to come just before they open so you can get in for the first round. No waiting! If you miss this you essentially have to wait until everyone finishes that first meal.

Whether that's true or not, it was definitely tasty and we ended up here two days in a row. It's a tiny space well known for its lines constantly out the door. Best to show up right before opening time or do takeout. Will say that they are highly efficient in moving the line along and will take your order in line and have your food served promptly after being seated. Reasonably priced food with great presentation and attentive service. Recommend the tuna salmon salad rice bowl and the chirashi-zushi (similar dishes but the rice bowl is more filling). Also had the 48 hrs pork and the ramen, but nothing to write home about. Matcha green tea ice cream was a nice way to end the meal. For an ""authentic"" Japanese restaurant, interesting to see some Korean inspired dishes such as Galbi and Bibimbap dishes. Definitely worth a visit.

My friend and I waited for about 20ish minutes in the cold outside the restaurant before being seated. We were rushed into the cramped restaurant and seated at the bar.I do think Kazu is slightly overhyped, but is probably very good in the context of Japanese food in Montreal. I ordered the dumplings as well as the teriyaki burger. Both were very well presented, especially considering how fast the kitchen churns everything out. The food was tasty, but I wouldn't say it was out-of-the-world; I think I've had better Japanese food in other parts of the world. Overall, I think Kazu is a good bet, and maybe I should have tried something else on the menu. Their specials look like they would be really good. Don't go here if you're looking for a sit-down, laid back experience - they will rush you in and out to get that line moving."

I didn't expect to eat at a Japanese restaurant while in Montreal but all the locals rave about it. I came in Kazu for lunch expecting ramen and sushi on the menu. Yeah, they have that but I wanted to try izakaya dishes for the first time. Yes this place comes with a line like all other popular Montrealian restaurants. I have to admit, the space is tiny, tight and overcrowded. The staff is super friendly and unusually cheerful. The menu is one big mess -handwritten with Post-Its add-ons. The food presentation may look disgusting but the taste was out of this world. I had carpaccio de boeuf which was raw filet in a vinegar base sauce over spring mix salad. It's very tasty and a good starter. I also had the eggplant dip. Yes, the presentation is messy looking but it works for this place. As I look around the restaurant, the sheets of paper covering the entire wall described a more adventurous menu that was not reflected on the so-so lunch menu. If you want a daring and adventurous experience, try coming here for dinner. Order from the wall."
/user_details?userid=VP9V1XJXHyQTLY_IzyU2YQ,Rakesh R.,"Charlotte, NC",2 star rating,Being vegetarian there were only 2 options on the menu and after eating I felt it was overhyped. The presentation was great but the dishes were more on the bland side and I had to ask for salt pepper and hot sauce. Be prepared to wait (it was winter and had to wait outside). After finishing the food then came the biggest surprise that they only take CASH or Canadian debit card(apparently there was a board outside but was blocked with all the people waiting). Being from the USA I requested if they can charge a little extra and take my cc which they refused and rudely pointed to the board outside.  I had to leave my wife to go out in search of an atm and they asked her to vacate the table and wait near the cashiers desk. After managing to get the cash from somewhere I finally pay the amount and she now says on top of the bill I had to pay mandatory 20% tip(for this pathetic service).  I suspect that they do all the CASH  transaction to avoid paying TAX...vegetarians and tourists I would advise to avoid this place...

It is a pain to get seated and eat at the restaurant though. The seating is extremely limited and often you eat along the bar type table. It is a nice experience to watch the chefs at their craft. It somehow feels more authentic that way haha.

/user_details?userid=p63T73TnkrXcdFqliWmUJQ,Ken S.,"Mississauga, Canada",4 star rating,"Kazu, in the downtown core of Montreal is a Japanese treat.  If you like or love Japanese food you must go.  Yes, even you fast food sushi eaters will enjoy this place.  It is an Izakaya or Japanese style bar where many little plates are offered like Japanese tapas.   The restaurant is very small and there are always line-ups.  Though you could not tell from the generic 80's Japanese interior, this place is a gem.  What makes Kazu so special?  Well lets just say that we dropped by when they were closed and saw bushels of beautiful Heirloom tomatoes ripening in the window and a heirloom tomato salad special ad on the wall.  To me that is a very good sign I should come back the next day and investigate.  Of course we did and Kazu did not disappoint.There cannot be more then 15 tables in the joint and there is a strong fried ""bouquet"" in the air.  Servers are locals and equally passionate about food.  The menu is small yet packed however, I immediately gravitated to the specials on the wall including the much self-hyped Heirloom Tomato salad.  Many of the dishes lack that clean, detailed presentation demanded by Japanese chefs but some were definitely well thought out.       Heirloom tomato salad at a Japanese spot?  Toronto might win a Stanley cup!  Anyway, the tomatoes were fresh, firm and sweet, drizzled with a simple olive oil and citrus zest dressing.  Tomatoes can be awful when over or under ripe but these were simply perfect.House made Japanese pickled items including sprouts, mushrooms, cucumber, carrot and zucchini.  You have to try real Japanese pickled items as they are packed with flavor and texture.  These were top notch but Ame in Toronto has the best.48 hour pork - Not pretty by any means but this is comfort food at its best.  I asked if they had a bigger plateand a shovel but no luck.  The dish is packed with fat and skin to add even more richness to an already tasty dish.  I have asked repeatedly if they deliver to Toronto and the answer is always the same.  I will keep trying.I would call this as Nobu coined ""New Style Sashimi,"" or fresh raw fish drizzled with hot oil to subtly cook it.A beef tongue spread that was rich and had a pulled pork texture to it.  So tasty.Natto Maguro or Fermented soya bean (Natto) and tuna cut from the back of the fish.  The condiments on the side are meant to mixed together in the bowl at your discretion.  At other Japanese restaurants the server will actually mix it for you.  If you haven't tried Natto it is best described like a soft coffee bean.  Strong flavor, sticky and a nice earthy taste.  In Toronto, you can try Natto at Guu Izakaya, Zen Sushi, Kumai amongst others with salmon, tuna or squid sashimi.    This was their fried Gyoza.  It was not the greatest dish but I was never a Gyoza fan to start.  The process to cook was unique with the 3 huge gyoza being fried together.  Typical but flavorful sauce of soya, ginger and dashi.Tuna Tartare was just as it should be.Leave a comment if you have been to Kazu or have a story about Natto."

This is a place you go to for the experience. Speaking of which, the owner, Kazuo, likes to observe the patrons in the restaurant to make sure they're having a pleasant one.

Thankfully they're back in business and it was definitely worth the second trip out.Upon entering the restaurant my friend and I were greeted with a friendly round of ""irasshaimase"", which means welcome in Japanese (and is something you will hear every time you enter a restaurant or store in Japan). Off to a good start!I already knew I wanted to try the salmon and tuna bowl based on reviews I'd read and my friend settled on a bowl of ramen (I believe this is only on the lunch menu). The salmon and tuna bowl was delicious and I'm pretty sure this will be my standby meal at Kazu, because yes, I will be returning. It was composed of rice, a good sized serving of tuna and salmon sashimi, and salad all topped with a sesame dressing and some crunchy noodles. My friend enjoyed her ramen and we both agreed that the broth wasn't too salty at all. All in all, with the traditional decor, friendly staff and tasty food I'm sure this is a restaurant I'll return to again and again, which is encouraged by the owner who will shout out ""see you tomorrow!"" as you leave.NB: They only accept cash.Update: I've been here twice now and there was a lineup the last time I went, around dinner time. It's a pretty tiny restaurant so it fills up quick, and you may end up seated at the bar. But despite the extra heat from the open kitchen, I like being able to see all the food prep. Just be prepared to wait a bit to get in, looks like word's gotten out!"

The doors opened promptly at 5:30pm, but unfortunately we did not make into the restaurant in that first round of entry. The restaurant is pretty small and probably fits around 15 people at a time. After another 40ish minutes of waiting we finally got in and sat at the bar.The service was prompt but friendly. We ordered the shrimp burger, gyoza ravoli, beef carpaccio, buta don, chirashi, and traditional sashimi. Overall, all the dishes were tasty. The buta don was surprising, visually it looks very simple, stewed pork on rice, but it was very tasty in a home made sense, I couldn't stop eating it. The chirashi and sashimi came with a nice helping of mixed green salad and had a nice sesame soy dressing with a nice citrus hint. The fish served was fresh. The beef carpaccio came dressed in a thicker oil citrus like emulsion.The shrimp burger was fresh and had a nice crunch from the shrimp, ours came out a bit lukewarm though.The gyoza ravoli was really 3 gyozas ""fused"" together by a starch base that became nice a crispy thin base once cooked, you would love this if you love the crispy crunchy bits at the bottom of gyozas.They have an open kitchen and since we sat at the ""bar"" area we got to see the chefs cook which was pretty cool. I was in awe at the rate of them pumping out the food in such a small kitchen. Overall, I liked the food here but felt rushed eating, I understand since there was a tonne of people outside and they are a small place. I would definitely return if only I do not have to wait 1 hour in line, maybe next time I am in Montreal we will go at 5pm and get into the restaurant in that first wave of patrons."

The wait was worth it!We ordered Kazu's choice, leaving meal choice in the hands of the chef. We weren't disappointed. Kazu gave us a taste of everything, pork neck, tuna tartar, tomato salad and shrimp pancakes. What an incredible meal.The ambiance is also irresistible, we sat at the bar and could talk to the chefs not to mention other patrons who were all to happy to compare notes on the taste and smells of the dishes they had ordered.  There was a problem with the fan over the grill on the night we went so the place was a little smoky but oddly enough it seemed to add to the experience. Kazu told us that the fan was due to be fixed the next day. This place is a great find in what is becoming a great part of downtown Montreal, I would almost call it the new China town. A couple of things to keep in mind about Kazu, first of all it's closed on Tuesday's, second expect to stand in line and wait for a table, the restaurant is small and has few tables, this is part of what makes this place so much fun. I would suggest this place to anyone looking for great Japanese cuisine, I know I'll be back often. I did want to mention the they accept interact payments now, I paid via interact when I was there."

However, when we asked a waitress they said American credit would be fine. The restaurant itself is very cramped, understandable considering how busy it is. The service was prompt. The food was AMAZING. We ordered the Beef Carpaccio which was extremely flavorful, same with Tukune. I would also recommend the Beef Kalbi plate and the Buta-Don. I would give this place 5 stars, however at the end they informed us only cash was accepted. Luckily, we had enough to cover the bill, but it would've been nice to know ahead of time.

Needless to say, I had to get in on the action as well. This, was more difficult than I had anticipated, and I strongly recommend my readers to get there either 10-15 min ahead of the opening hours, or get there a little later (maybe after the 3rd or 4th dinner rush).After waiting outside for more than an hour, peering through the windows and waiting for people to leave, we were finally seated. And unfortunately, the long anticipation had raised the expectation and hunger levels exceedingly high. My girlfriend and I shared a 48-hr pork bowl, with the famous shrimp burger and okonomiyaki. Despite the publicity, I found the pork bowl to be just a little bit too cool and the rice a bit dry for my taste. The pork was certainly tasty...but if you didn't tell me of the hype, I wouldn't have guessed its significance. The shrimp burgers were definitely unique with the shrimp patty almost melting in my mouth, but the portion sizes were too small. As for the okonomiyaki, I've waited nearly 5 years since NYC when I lasted tasted its deliciousness, and unfortunately, when the dish was delivered, I devoured it post-haste, not actually noticing the fact it was kinda cold and the fish flakes had stopped moving and dried up.Overall, too much hype for decent and authentic Japanese food. I will not argue its taste, but the wait was just unreasonable for the level of food.

As others have mentioned, they do bring out menus so you can order when you sit right away. we ended up waiting around 30 minutes (tip: if you come with more people, the longer the wait will be..there are probably only two or so tables that can seat more than two). inside, it's very small and cramped. of course, you don't come here to lounge. we were in and out in about 20-30 minutes. as for the food, I got the tuna and salmon tartare rice bowl. it was really good, as was the shrimp burger which I tried as well. I got the onigri to go, but it ended up looking better than it tasted. Everything that the tables around us ordered seemed to get rave reviews and the open kitchen was a nice touch. Service was fast and efficient, and the price was not too bad at all (around $10-20 per entree)"

First, be prepared to wait a bit outside in the line. It is a small place so they can only accommodate about 30 ppl at a time. Also, it is a great form of advertisement. It is absolutely worth the wait!! Do not leave!! Second, they either take cash or debit cards. No credit cards. So be prepared in advance. Other then that, if you are going and need company, hit me up! I am always ready for Kazu!"

I ordered the ice cream based on some other reviews, it was good but $5 but I was SHOCKED that it was so tiny - You just get an espresso cup of ice cream.  If you want two spoonfuls of ice cream for $5 feel free and order, otherwise use that money towards another shirmp burger :)"

Last time I was here there was only green tea and coffee, now there's a whole bunch of ice cream flavors... The rhum and raisin was amazing, but then again it's Kazu, and mostly the food never disappointed me here.It has been a year since I've been here. They were closing from lunch service and prepping for dinner service. Kazu happened to be there, and naturally he came by and chatted with me a bit lol, I remember back in the day when they just opened and I came pretty much every week, everyday other day, sometimes twice a day. Anyhow long time no see!! he would say ironically, these days, it actually is long time no see, as the lineups have become so ridiculous...Anyhow, I'm happy to report, it's still the best ramen in town !!!The ramen is scorching hot!!! it remains hot until the end, about 25 mins so don't worry about it cooling off before you finish. There are 3 slices of grilled pork belly, half a 3min egg, pickled radish, bean sprout, kelp and one piece of roasted nori. And the broth from out of this world, it is perfectly balanced, just right, and fragrant garnished with sesame seeds and scallions. The ramen texture is also spot on, not too tough and they give when you byte but it doesn't get soggy at the end!!! bliss :)"

All my coworkers, friends, everyone rave so highly of it, I figured I was about three steps from walking into a 2012 the movie-esque let down.I have never been so happy to be so wrong. Lining up 20 minutes before opening, we barely made it in in the first wave. We selected a pork cheek pate and tuna tartar.  Both of these quite nice, tasty, and fast, this of course made me crave more.  For entrees, a fall off the bone rib in an amazing sauce, a pork neck that had me gnawing at the bone to get what tiny morsels of remaining meat away from its confinement, and a distinct craving to figure out how I could fit another dish into my belly.Make sure you arrive early, as the line that formed while we dined was a sight to behold. It is worthy of the line, and for the price for what you get, it is a great destination. This is a must visit in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=M4CTQYlQOWEFLNx690iHYw,Michelle T.,"San Francisco, CA",3 star rating,"On a random stroll down St. Catherine our first night visiting montreal, the bf and I witnessed a colossal line outside of the restaurant we later discovered to be Kazu. After viewing the pictures, and reviews and the menu, we decided it would be worth the wait to experience what others have claimed to be ""the most authentic Japanese food in Montreal.""After a 40 minute wait in line on a Tuesday evening around 6, the bf and I were seated. While waiting in line, we had already picked out what we wanted and ordered as soon as we sat down. Our meals came out in lightning speed, it was pretty much a fast food restaurant. The 40-hour pork was the first to arrive. A good portion of food atop of a bed of rice, which was unfortunately lukewarm. One of the best things about these rice bowls, is the piping hot steam the rises out of the bowl, catching the juices of the meat atop and dispersing it to the diners nostrils. Too bad the pork was cool and the rice was nowhere close to hot. Flavor-wise though, it was good! The pork was tender, juicy and flavorful though I probably wouldn't order it again. The shrimp burger arrived next. This was actually my favorite. I loved the fusion style and flavors. The bun was toasty and slightly charred so the outside had a crunch while the inside was pillowy soft. The shrimp patty was delicious and shrimpy, slightly sweet and very fresh. It went perfect with the zesty homemade sauce! Finally, our okonomiyaki. Something the bf had been vying for for the past few months and the main reason we came to Kazu. Apart from the fact that it was missing dried bonito flakes, the dish was great. The pancake itself had plenty of seafood ingredients inside. The batter was thick and flavorful. The edges were crunchy (just the way I like it), and there was a perfect amount of sauce. We finished our meal probably in 20 minutes and we were satisfied. I liked Kazu and would definitely recommend it, but not sure that 40-hour pork would be something I'd go for again."

The place is way too crowded for my taste.  I sat at the bar since the tables were ridiculously packed together.  Even at the bar, the chef had to use part of the bar counter for the ordered food of other customers.  It was placed very close to where I'm eating my own plate.  I couldn't help wondering what if someone(not me) sitting at the bar accidently coughs and spits (while talking) in those plates of food before the waiter gets to take them to the table customers.  Ewww...  Anyway, back to the food, I ordered the salmon and tuna salad for $15.  I guess maybe I'm picky, but I would prefer to have my sashimi in slices rather than little bit sizes.  The texture and flavor of this salad do give a well-balanced taste to this dish.  I also ordered the homemade tofu as appetizer.  It was slightly salty but still good.  However, for two pieces of tofu, it seems overly priced: $12.  This place is definitely not a ""cheap-eats"" place."

I've actually never had ramen broth like it before. The noodles are also the right texture.

I liked Kazu when I went, but I would have to be in the mood for it to go again. Reason being the line-up and the general lack of space on the inside. There is NO ROOM to set up for a nice meal, you'll need to pack light (drop off whatever bag you might have somewhere before coming) and be comfortable hitting elbows with strangers.Other than that I enjoyed the food and the many unique dishes the restaurant has to offer."

/user_details?userid=oGC9GgY9YIld7T-So6JtWg,John C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I'm not going to comment on the food since there is already a consensus of 'yumminess'. Rather I'll write a bit about the mechanics of eating here efficiently since it's such a small place. Wife and I usually go prior to open for lunch or dinner - that way, the waiting time is 10 minutes which is acceptable to us. If you arrive after everyone is initially seated, you lose and will have to stand outside. We like to sit at the kitchen bar because the tables are super cramped and I'm no skinny mini. Kazu usually acknowledges us with a shy smile.  You should order really fast because they don't dilly-dally. In fact, if you are patient enough to wait outside for a table, they often bring out a menu so you can order immediately upon getting a seat. Consistent with this, hardly anyone eats slowly and most people eat and are out in 10-20 minutes. It's fast service, good eats, and get the hell out (they don't tell you to, but unless you are evil, you'll feel bad looking at the people giving you an evil eye if you ain't eating anymore).  I've tried almost every dish in this place. I've got my favourites but overall, everything is pretty damn good. It can get expensive if you're a pig like me and order multiple dishes. But for the average Joe, it's pretty reasonable.  It's definitely lacks in decor and space, but you got to love a place where the owner is front and center almost all the time and the food is probably better than most ""dress-up"" places."

Grab maybe 1 friend, because the smaller your party, the greater the likelihood of getting seated, even if it is the bar. I went twice last week,  the food was that amazing. Super fresh, super tasty and an incredibly friendly and eccentric staff. We were seated at the bar and had a perfect view of the chef preparing all the plates, it was like being at a cooking show from the Food Channel, only it's in real life.They take all the ""weird"" bits of the animal, stuff that other people don't want like tuna belly and pork neck and transform them in the most lip-smacking tastiest creations imaginable, which only goes to prove that just about anything can be delicious and tasty if it is prepared properly and in the right hands.Salmon salads with crunchy noodles, pork cheek pates with pita bread, Kahlua ice cream and wasabi ice cream, there was not a single disappointing note anywhere. If you are on a budget, there are options here which you can have without breaking the wallet, but just be warned that if you add things like plum wine and dessert, the bill can easily shoot up.Waitress and the chef were extremely friendly, service is brisk, and many menu items are scrawled on yellowed pieces of paper stuck up on the wall, reminiscent of  kids crayon drawings in elementary school classrooms. The restaurant is a tight, cozy space but somehow you don't feel crowded or claustrophobic.Try it at least once, guaranteed, you'll go back."

This is a very small and crowded wood-paneled restaurant.  Quite dumpy, to be honest, but the cheerful and upbeat staff make the place warm and extremely charming.  Even the worn pieces of paper with handwritten menu items are funny and add to the charm of the place.  An added bonus is that we can see Kazu, the owner and head chef of the restaurant, cook meals up right in front of our eyes (that is, if you're sitting at the bar).What's unfortunate about this place is that it takes no reservations and that the ramen, undeniably the best item on the menu, is only served at lunch time.  I get cravings for the ramen at all hours of the day, and I would certainly visit this place even MORE often if the ramen were served for dinner (heck, I'd even eat it for breakfast).Finally, this is a wonderful place to go if you want an absolutely stellar soup or a solid meal.  The presentation of the food is wonderful, and the staff are delightful.  You'll never leave without a smile because the whole staff will yell ""ARIGATO GOZAIMASU"" and you'll certainly want to yell it back, as the food is really THAT good."

This place was fine. It just wasn't as crazy good as the hype made it out to be.Maybe I just ordered the wrong things?To start with, the menu seems quite big. But there are so many duplicates. Like the sashimi and tartar are the same essentially in taste, but different in presentation. There is also another dish that has double the amount of sashimi, and also the same flavourings (i.e. sauce). I got the onigiri - a big step for me since I am always watching my carb intake. I thought I would splurge on some rice balls that were supposed to be a-mazing. They were okay... Like, I would never order them again. Maybe the flavour du jour on them wasn't my thing. The ice cream was fine. Thankfully it was a microscopic serving in an espresso cup. Maybe they had a sense that I was on a diet and gave me 1/2 the amount I saw other people getting... Basically it is vanilla ice cream with whatever flavouring the flavour says, added to it. It is not coffee-ice-cream, it is ice cream and coffee... if you get my point.Yes, the presentation is lovely. There are heaps of that crunchy straw-like decoration on a shelf above the kitchen, and they toss it on the plate making it look very sexy. There are drips of sauce artfully smeared on the edge of the dish that you can roll your food morsel in. It's beautiful.It is a tiny place, no joke. Keep your elbows close at your sides and keep your belongings between your legs. It's like flying economy class on a plane, seriously, with a busy busy aisle seat. It really was 'A-OK' as the 3 star yelp rating designates. I would go back again and try more things on the menu. I didn't try the shrimp burger, and do regret that.

There will be plenty of time to read this review there.OK - Standing in line? Good. Relax. Be patient. You'll have some time to read this and probably every other review on Yelp.I wound there with a couple of friends on a random Thursday night. The friend that took us there said it was about a ""20 minute walk"". 40 minutes later we were there. And hungry. And more than a bit cranky.After standing around for a while, we finally got a menu and I discovered at that point this was not a sushi joint as promised. More crankiness ensued.We were finally getting wedged into a table next to the door with the perfect amount of cross breeze to keep me nice and cold. Crankiness level 10.At this point I was basically over the whole experience.And then we got food.The skies opened and sun shone down. Wars ceased to be fought. Diseases were cured. And the world became a better place for every boy and for every girl.We went through about 5 rounds of food. Their pancakes. Their rice bowls. Their sashimi dishes. All amazing.And then the shrimp burger. To say this thing is orgasmic is to do this shrimp burger an injustice.Plan to stand in line for a long time. Plan to be crammed into a tiny divey restaurant.Plan for a very friendly waitstaff and amazing food.Are you standing in line yet? If not - Go already!"

The food was freshly prepared behind the bar and the stuff are very friendly, the waitress serving the tea almost thought I was someone she knew from before... The owner was observant and advised me to mix the crispy rice noodle with the salad/sauce/sashimi/rice but hey there goes the crispiness! As some fellow yelper already stated earlier the vinegar-flavored sauce is the essence of this dish as it compose the other ingredients into one perfect taste sensation.Last but not least for all foreign visitors in town please prepare cash as they only accept LOCAL DEBIT cards."

Terrible food, bad service. bring the check when the food is not even finished, try to rush us out of the restaurant. ordered the prok ramen, only came with two tiny piece of pork, and half of the pork is all Fat, charged $12 for it, absolutely absurd. ordered a salmon and tuna bowl for $18, most of it was rice, tiny bits of salmon and tuna, definitely not worth it. also the shrimp burger is totally junk, shrimp marinated in 90% of the flour. the sashima plate is a total joke, suppose come with 4 pcs of sashima, I couldn't even see the size of them, so thin and small, need a magnifying glass. And so called green tea ice cream is ridiculous, put some green powder on top of the melted white ice cream, come in a teeny tiny cup and dare to charge $5. This place is a total loser, wouldn't recommend to fellow yelper!!!!"

/user_details?userid=fiz9Y2dagXIEq0w8FGOGnQ,Andrei A.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"I went to Kazu, because it was the highest rated Japanese restaurant in Montreal in terms of number of Yelp votes and the overall rating. I had to stand in line for 10-15 min before I got in. In all fairness, the food was good. Not great, but good. I was hoping to try rolls, but that place does not carry rolls. The meat options I went with were ok. I really liked the ribs, but was not impressed with pork neck. I ended up spending about $60 for two people. Maybe I don't get something, but I probably won't be coming back here again. The service was great and fast, don't get me wrong, but the overall ratio of type of food to price wasn't there for me. Next time, I'd much rather go to a Japanese, where I will have a selection of rolls, sushi, sashimi and hot meals. A good example I like to quote here in Toronto that's my personal favourite is Japango. I hope Montreal has an equivalent of Japango."

We waited outside for about 15 minutes then moved in between the doors. The place is super tiny which is why I am only giving 4 stars. My boyfriend and I came with two other friends but we split up so we can get our seats quicker. We ended up at the bar and fortunately, next to each other anyway. No space to move around so I felt very rushed because we can't just sit and talk over our meals. But it was a delicious meal though.Food: Awesome Salmon & Tuna Bowl. It's very flavorful but not too overpowering. It is also a very healthy dish. My boyfriend got the 48 hour pork with rice. I am not a fan of ginger but the pork was very tasty and he loved it. We also tried the Japanese Pancake with Shrimp. I find that it was very heavy and more flour than shrimp. I like sauce and toppings on top of the pancake though.Service: The ladies were very attentive and nice and our food arrived super fast (esp in this space and with the line out, they had to be fast!) If I was to go back, then I would definitely stick to the Salmon/Tuna bowl! Give this place a try, and I recommend going on a not so cold day/night so you won't freeze your butt off even if you have to wait!"

/user_details?userid=S9ERL8VSyLB9SIIsVDcfhw,Tian X.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Horrible experience in Kazu today. When we entered the restaurant, we were happy that there was no line in front. However that was just a beginning.To be honest, there are 2 girls(waitresses) who talked with us. Let's make the thing easier,the first girl who greeted us, here I take ""A"" to identify her. After no more than 1 min, another girl came to greet us, let's call her ""B"".""A"" firstly asked if we need some drink to start, we said just water. As long as ""A"" turned her back, ""B"" came to ask the same question. It was fine, people may make mistakes when lacking of communication. Then I realized my thought was too naive.In the next 5-8 mins, ""A"" and """"B came in turn to push us to order foods. We sit down at around 18:25. Before 18:35, these two girls asked us more than 5 times. My friend mentioned we were not familiar with the food, just leave us 2 mins to think.""A"" just explained yellow paper on the wall is special offer. Others are regular. Then she tried to make us order a grilled fish. We need time, we repeated that. Then ""B"" came, same words, same action, same mood. That made us anxious.After such scenes happening 5 times, my friend said this small restaurant wants us order and eat quickly so as to receive more customers. But these kind of attitudes sucked. I checked outside, yeah, I saw the line has been built. No wonder why ""A"" and ""B"" were in a hurry!Alright I made place for you, Kazu. But you were totally removed from my list.We left at around 18:35, I didn't even have the chance to touch the glass of water.Who spoils Kazu? Reviewers or media? What supports Kazu indeed? Profits or customers' experiences? I think Kazu took his choice, and the customers should take theirs, too."

My favourite dish is the chiraishi..didn't enjoy anything else. The cost of the food is quite high, but for authenticity I guess it's okay. The place reminds me of Izakaya/Guu (in Toronto), which I would prefer more than Kazu. However, in the city of Montreal, japanese cuisine is not as abundant - so I would highly recommend if you want to try authentic jap food. One other thing that deters me is the wait. I waited 1 hr + to get in..never again. I recommend take out."

Unfortunately the place is pretty small (fits maybe 20-25 max?) But the food is worth standing in line for. I highly suggest you get there half an hour before it opens to be one of the first ones in. The service is awesome and the place makes you feel as if you're in one of those typical little Japanese restaurant back in japan.  It is by far one of my favorite restaurants (minus one star for the size of the place). Totally recommend (unless you're one of those who hate being in very thight and crowded places).

We waited in line for 1/2 hr - 45 minutes before being seated. Please don't come here in a large group because you will most likely have to split up into groups of 2 or 3. Also, it is very crowded inside. People will be rubbing behind your back to get through.We shared the 48 Hours Pork Rice Bowl, Tuna and Salmon Rice Bowl and the Shrimp Burger. The 48 hour pork rice bowl is not special. It tastes like any other marinated pork. While it is tender, it's not worth the price.My favorite was the tuna and salmon rice bowl. Mix in the crispy ingredients on the top, and you have an extremely fresh bowl of seafood and rice. Very refreshing but not filling.The shrimp burger was tasted heavier than the other dishes and was delicious. I wish the shrimp wasn't mashed up, and actual pieces of shrimp were used.All in all, I wouldn't pay this price or wait this long for Japanese food of this quality. Next!"

Our orders were taken within a minute, although we didn't get a chance to really peruse the menu. The next table had the Tuna/Salmon bowl and it looked good so we ordered that when we heard I was a favorite. Food came out so fast that we were surprised. Everything was great, even the Green tea. We are from San Francisco, have been to Japan, and eat Japanese food several times a month and our first visit to Kazu did not disappoint. We rate our food at Kazu tops.

Really light and fresh, this bowl is a party pack of gestures and flavours; the delicateness of the raw fish crunching in your mouth due to the tempura flakes and fried noodles and the sweet and spiciness of the two different sauces, my pallet was awake taking notes and trying to keep track of what exactly was going on all at once.We also ordered the grilled pork necks. Marinated and grilled in a sweet soy and miso sauce, the pork necks were sticky, fatty and smokey. There was not THAT much meat on the bones, but it was enough to warrant me holding it up against my face to slather the sauce against my ear, wiggling my tongue against the nooks and crannies making me perform some sort of sick porky cunilingus on the butchered vertebras."

The restaurant is really small, which is why the line is always so long. Once in the restaurant, the whole experience was super impressive! My boyfriend and I were seated at the counter, where we saw the chefs prepare the dishes and boy oh boy were we blown away! Within two minutes of ordering, our food was ready! The chef made it right in front of us so quickly that we didn't even notice. And the plates were presented so beautifully! The waitress was also really really nice! The service was SO freaking fast, which is probably why the line moves so quickly. I wish I could bring all my friends here, but this place is really not ideal if you're more than a group of 4."

Kazu offers typical japanese pub food. your typical middle class restaurant. So there's nolhing pretentious about this restaurant. It's a really small restaurant so it's isn't advised for large group. Not only that but it's so popular that there's some decent lineup that may take over 1-2 hours of wait outside. Today was pretty cold, so you get that this is a good place when you're willing to wait 1-2h outside.What to try? Everything! I'm not kidding. In my humble opinion the most complex and well search meal is the Japanese pancake with shrimp. Amazing! Try the octopus and Takiyaki. The Onigiri (seasoned rice balls) is really good with the little marinated veggie that comes with it. Ramen I was told is pretty darn good. I tried the Don Budo or basically the 48 hours pork-onion stew with rice; amazin flavours. I like to go there with 2 persons. Those are meal that a fun to split in two and share. It's the same staff as last year so it is a experienced staff and to keep it together with that much people waiting, kodoos!Vous n'avez jamais essayé de nourriture japonaise? Vous aimeriez essayez quelque chose de nouveau mais vous avez un peu peur ? C'est un peu le cas de mon ami avec qui j'étais. Kazu c'est le repas du japonais de classe moyenne. Ce n'est pas cher, des recettes sans prétention et à mon avis, des plats qui se prêtent très bien au palet d'un habitué de nourriture occidentale.  Enfin c'est un restaurant qui est FORTEMENT RECOMMANDÉ d'arrivé 30 minutes avant l'ouverture. Qu'essayez? TOUT! Je ne blague pas. À mon humble opinion le plat le plus complexe et plus sublime de la soirée c'était la crêpe japonaise aux crevettes. Ça venait avec une salades de cressons et de mescluns avec une vinaigrette sublime. Sinon le Takiyaki le Onigiri, la pieuvre grillée. Tous des mets génial. C'est définitivement un endroit ou y aller en petit groupe de 2-4 max c'Est recommandé. C'est juste que c'est un resto de 40 places gros comme la moitié d'un wagon de train de banlieue! ;) .Top Niveau!"

The tuna/salmon bowl was amazing as was the shrimp burger. Not fancy by any means, and the prices are reasonable. If you are looking for quality food over all else, this is your place."

/user_details?userid=yHykh6VFpsH_V62bRaq3FQ,Sara C.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"I love Montreal, but when it comes to Japanese food, it leaves one wanting.  So in a city where these restaurants fall short, one that doesn't is really something to cheer about. On my previous visits I've avoided Kazu because there's always a line, and I'm always too hungry to wait.  But this weekend I had a game plan.  My sister and I hit the St. Laurent street sale and snacked all the way up and all the way down so that by the time we hit the line at Kazu we were ready.  I love it when a plan comes together.The wait was 24 minutes.  Perfect seeing as it takes 20 minutes for my stomach to digest empanadas.  Kazu is small and for lack of a better word chaotic. Even the walls are chaotic.  I know, it's a mess, and you want to eat it all.  But my sister and I know our eyes are bigger than out stomachs so we exerted self-control and ordered, starting with cocktails.  Izakayas are known for having great ones, and Kazu was no different.  I had a couple Calpico ones and my sister the fresh fruit and soju.  We could have stayed all night drinking but for the glaring eyes of people waiting in the doorway.Kazu is by no means a traditional izakaya in that the portions are compartively huge.Since my sister and I sat at the bar we got to see the chefs work.  I took a couple things away from that.  The first is that the guy is sorta cute (there's also a girl, but we're not talking about her).  The second is that the prep for this place must be insane.  They have so many different sauces which start in these plastic containers and then get poured into squeeze bottles.  Cute chef plus multiple squeeze bottles equates to messy magic. Few restaurants are really worth waiting in line.  I usually just do it because it makes me feel like I'm part of something, and don't we all want to belong?!?  The true measure of a great meal is food memory.  I still think about the salmon tuna bowl at Kazu.  It was really good.  Nothing extraordinary about it, just fresh pieces of seasoned fish, rice, lettuce and other vegetables, those sorta tasteless but superfun fried noodle things, and sauce.  So simple.  So many flavours.  So fun.  So dramatic.  So delicious.I will go back and eat it again.  But this time, I refuse to share with my sister.  I don't think she wants to share with me anyway. Kazu is like an emerald in a gold mine.  If an emerald were Japanese food and the gold were poutine.  Both precious, just different.Eat something different.P.S. Dear Salmon Tuna Bowl, I miss you."

So pricey, but the food is absolutely delish because it's freshly cooked, seasoned and made right in front of you.Come early (opens at 5:30) for dinner to avoid long lines. If you miss the first round of people getting in, I promise you it will be at least an hour wait. It's not your expected traditional Japanese food - it's cooked Japanese food like gyozas, okonomiyaki, nabeyaki soup - seriously, the good salty stuff. Order anything off the menu, people all around me ordered a variety from Tuna/Salmon Bowl to the Shrimp burger. I shared a nabeyaki, tuna/salmon bowl and an okonomiyaki with a friend. My okonomiyaki was really big, but undercooked :( Nevertheless, it was good - but undercooked (docked a star for that) so the middle was kind of pasty and sicky - however, the nabeyaki and tuna/salmon bowl was divine. Nabeyaki was tasty, the meats were good and the tofu was love - soft and silky. The bowl: Perfect amount of fish and crunchiness in the bowl, it had great texture - and was HUGE - so filling. Really, you are paying for your worth. Last of all - GET THE ICECREAM. I don't know what you're thinking if you leave without dessert because this ice cream reminds me of the ice-cream I ate in Japan on top of a freaking mountain. The soft ice cream is very milky and creamy. It makes you believe that they use the best of the best ice cream. And they have a variety of flavors, but my friend and I tried Earl Grey and Green tea. It's a really crunchy, tastey powder that flavors the ice cream, almost like cookies.  yum, definitely the place to try while you're in Montreal!"

I much prefer placing a phone order, which take about 10-15 minutes to be ready for pick-up.

I gave my husband a few choices in the area from my guidebook/Yelp searches, and he settled on Kazu. We quickly made our way over there, but clearly the lunch crowd had just been let in because every seat was filled and we were the third party now waiting in line. Ugh.We waited close to 30 minutes, I think, before the two of us finally got a pair of seats at the bar. By then we were starving and immediately ordered - easy since the menu items are listed all over the walls! I got the tuna salmon salad bowl, which was delicious. The tuna and salmon sashimi lay on a bed of vinegar rice with some pickles, and was topped with a mixed greens salad and crunchy rice noodles with a delicious, light sesame dressing. It came with my choice of soup or salad, and I chose the egg soup for a little warmth in my belly. My husband had their ramen, which had a delicious broth he may or may not have ended up drinking straight from the bowl. He had the potato salad on the side, and quite enjoyed it (I don't like potato salad myself). I had to get dessert, and although they were promoting their new maple flavor, I went with the matcha and a small little cup of homemade vanilla ice cream with a generous heaping of matcha powder on top came out. It was delicious, although not quite what I expected and a bit on the small side considering it was $5!Prices in general are...fine, I guess. It depends really on what you order, but it seems as if quality of the ingredients drives the prices (obviously you have to pay more for sushi grade fish, for example). The staff is nice if massively harried, but given the crowds/lines of people trying to dine there they handle it pretty well. I'd probably do take out if I came here again because the thought of waiting for a cramped seat and rushed service is a bit of a turn off, even for yummy food."

This place is a very nice Asian and American fusion restaurant, with Asian restaurant atmosphere, where everyone's bustling and and the service is fast and curt, not intentionally but because the servers are quite busy. I really enjoyed my experience here. :-D The place is tight, with traditional decor, reminiscent of many Asian restaurants in Korea, China, and Japan. The wait time can be up to 30-45 minutes though. But I thought it was worth the wait time (though I doubt I'd say the same during winter, where it feel likes time has stopped because it's so cold).I had the bibimbap with chicken, and one of the soups. The soup was nice, but the bibimbap was a bit overpriced, but maybe properly priced in the Montreal marketplace, as I have not seen bibimbap charged less than 10 bucks in restaurants there (you can find something similar for may 6-8 bucks in Toronto and New York).The Yuzu carbonated juice was very refreshing. It reminded me of my childhood when I was visiting one of the buddhist temples in Korea. The monks and my family, while talking, were sipping on tea with the yuzu fruit slices, used for sweetening. That was a very nice trip back to memory lane. :-)I highly recommend this place!"

It had such intricate flavors that I never tasted in a potato salad. It was SOOO good I had to order it as a side!!! It was pretty expensive as a side for the amount you get! But who cares!!! I'm not talking about the mayo creamy kind, this was like some simple spice, maybe tomato paste, kind of flavor to it!!For someone to make something so simple & bland into something so tasty and good, he's got some skills!!!also, he had some cool things like BBQ Pork Neck shoulder which smelled so great on the grill but so hard to eat. it's pretty original...as well as the alot of the other items...like a fish paste ""hummus"" (not my cup of tea so wouldnt order again but interesting to try)also had the salad mix, which went well after eating the pork neck.it relieved the smokiness of the bbq.  Genius combo!!went back for lunch the next day cuz they only serve ramen during lunch but i wished i hadn't!!!the noodles weren't good at all and the soup is average so I would skip the ramen!! seriously, skip it!!I didn't even finish my bowl, which to a chinese boy is a big NO-NO!!sorry mom!!overall, this place rocks & KAZU rocks.

/user_details?userid=82Nredvik6cag2-Y2kpxPw,The Roasted Acorn A.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"As Japanese food addicts, we simply could not resist the temptation of trying one of the best japanese restaurants in Montreal - Kazu. After reading numerous reviews online, JW and I were very excited about going to Kazu!Arriving the restaurant at 8:15pm, we were lucky enough to skip the usual one-hour line up and got seated at the bar after 10 mins. The lively atmosphere highly resembled Guu from Toronto and the severs were very friendly and happy. Please be noted that the Kazu is pretty small and is best for a group of 2-5/6 at most.We first started off with yakitori - grilled chicken leg brochette. The meat was extremely juicy and tendered. It tasted like those those grilled skewers with soya sauce (they normally offer it with salt and soya sauce) from most Izakaya restaurants but only richer in flavour.Then, we had Kazu's famous Salmon & Tuna Bowl. Not very surprising, this quickly became our favourite dish that we had to come back to Kazu once again before heading back to Toronto mainly because of this. The Salmon & Tuna Bowl came with green, salmon, tuna, rice and crispy noodles sitting on top. However, what made this dish so special was Kazu's secret sauce. While JW and I were sitting at the bar, we secretly observed how this dish was prepared and we saw that at least 4-5 different sauce was added to the bowl. When mixed together, the sauce tasted like a salad dressing that was sweet and sour at the same time with a hint of sesame oil. The sauce highly complemented with the green, rice and sashimi. It did an amazing job of bringing all of them together and made a wonderful dish. The crispy noodle added an interesting texture to the salmon & tuna bowl, harmonizing with the crispiness of the greens.. Although this dish can be shared among a group of people and treated as an appetizer,  I personally think that I can finish one bowl all by myself as an entree because it was just too good.Next, we had the grilled shrimp. It was nothing like I expected when I ordered this. It looked like something I would find in an Italian or french restaurant, especially when it came with mashed potato at the bottom. Nevertheless, it was the sauce that made very impressive.While lining up, we asked one of the customer (who was a Japanese!) behind us his opinion about Kazu and what he would recommend. One of the dishes he recommended was the okonomiyaki with shrimp. He said that Kazu's okonomiyaki is very traditional which is very rare in Toronto. I would say that this dish was not as impressive as the other ones. It tasted just like normal takoyaki (japanese octopus ball), only that it took the form of a crepe and not a ball. Given that the portion was huge, we found the okonomiyaki to be a little overwhelming. It was the only dish we did not reorder on our second visit. But if you love takoyaki and are companied by a group of friends, you should definitely go for this!When we placed our first order, we were debating between the salmon & tuna bowl and the chirashi sushi. The server said the salmon & tuna bowl is a more popular dish at Kazu and that was what we went after. For our second order, we decided to order the chirashi sushi while still in shock of how amazing the salmon & tuna bowl was. While the ingredients were the same as the salmon & tuna bowl which consisted of green, tuna, salmon and rice, it was a totally different story. The sauce for the chirashi sushi was less freshening as the salmon & tuna bowl. It was more heavy and salty and with strong taste of sesame as you can see the large amount of sesame presented on the plate. The sashimi was slightly marinated as well and therefore not as fresh as the salmon & tuna bowl but went really well with the sauce. I recommend one to order both the salmon & tuna bowl and the chirashi sushi because they were just so different yet equally yummy.conclusion:roasted.We are in LOVE with the restaurant. We will definitely visit it again when we go to Montreal. It is just truly amazing as an Izakaya which I believe is the type of restaurant that are in high demand in North America.visit theroastedacorn.com/2012… for awesome pictures about the food i mentioned :)"

It is there that I ""discovered"" isakayas to the point where I prefer them over sushi restaurants. So needless to say that I have somewhat of high standards for those types of establishments. The hype and the long queue at this restaurant also only increased my expectations for kazu.I must say that I was pretty disappointed. Yes some of the items I tried were good and I will probably be back again but the only reason this place is popular is a lack of competition... there are not many isakayas in da 514.I don't understand why they have to put salad on absolutely all the dishes. Even, the shrimp burger and okomiyaki that everyone is raving about is covered with salad. I think the time I was the most disappointed was the chicken skin skewer. Those pieces are usually bits of heaven on a stick: Crispy, salty and slightly fatty to be eaten with some salt only. Kazu's version, was soft, chewy, fatty and drenched in some sort of teriyaki sauce. My girlfriend saw my sad face as I bit into it :(The lifesavers were the tuna rice bowl and the homemade ice cream. Both delicious although on the pricey side. In conclusion: the sucker that I am for isakayas... I'll be back and wait til my trip south...sigh"

My boyfriend and I were really looking forward to try this place but we were both starving and it was freezing cold outside. If you've read the other reviews below - they aren't kidding about the freaking line. The place itself is much smaller than I expected, reminding me of some of the noodle soups I saw while I was in LA (small, crowded- wooden tables, wooden stools). We were there before 7, on a Sunday night, and the line was already massive. Based on other reviews, I think we'll try to get there earlier next time...Maybe one day, I will get a taste of what is Kazu."
/user_details?userid=kgvTkSGVXS78xypSG8o-Bw,Pascal T.,"North Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"One of the legit ""great food"" spots in Montreal. Yes you'll likely wait in line and yes it's well worth it. Service is very good and friendly, prices are reasonable and the food tastes great. The atmosphere is also really nice - I believe the small size of the place adds to it and makes it more special. It's also great to see a Japanese restaurant without the standard sushi fare we see at 99% of the other places! This is real Japanese food, and it's really well done. For the vegetarians out there: try the Okonomiyaki pancake (ask them to remove the fish flakes that goes on top) and also the veggie hot pot... both are excellent."

/user_details?userid=ddUsCHQmQr-N4cHMl3S3fg,Jodie C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Tuna and Salmon Bowl. Oh my god. The handful of fried radish on top of the dish is killer. The longer the flavours sat in the bowl the better it tasted. I was so sad when it got to the last bite I didn't want it to ever end. Everything looked so delicious if I had the stomach capacity to eat everything on the menu I'd never leave. If you won't be able to go back I'd suggest sharing multiple dishes so you can experience everything there. Don't be intimidated by the line. It's nothing compared to the food you will taste inside. Sitting at the bar, I was tempted to reach other and eat the dishes prepared by the chefs. Don't fall into temptation, but I assure you it will be hard."
/user_details?userid=4FuQIzsR86C9yAB_O1hpuA,Aixa S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"So i cannot count how many times i have been to this place! pretty much once a month. The Real deal is to sit at the bar, so you can fully experience what is Kazu! or let's say Who is Kazu! So last time i was there, i invited one of my friend who never been there before, one of the cook from Satay Brothers (if you like Kazu you will love them aswell). it was his bday. We ordered probably 10 different things, A lot of food we had!! And so we could eat More, we decide to take option of eating nothing with rice. We started with the octopus and the Eggplant. Octopus was grilled and not overcooked, with perfect spices and a pretty big piece.Eggplant was something amazing and reminded me of what my dad do. Spanish tapenade. We took the Homemade Tofu, it is nothing special to it, you really got like Tofu and Texture, it was plain Soft Tofu with Soya Sauce. Its was more a Texture experience than anything else. Taki Gyoza is one of my favorite appetizer, and Edamane is a Must!Beef Kalbi was perfect cooked, not too much, and was Tender serve with well balance salad. (actually pretty much everything we had, was serve with a Salad)We order the grilled Mushrooms, I loved them and again its a texture experience. they had this mix of flavour, i guess because its cooked same grilled as all the meat and fish. I like it, maybe some people wouldnt appreciate it.  We order also the Fish Head, it took more time than the other meal, but was one of my fav dishes, we almost order another plate of Octopus but we decided to take the chicken skin and the beef carpaccio. I dont regret it :)and we finish with Sake ice cream. I didnt drink, my frient had a glass of beer and i took Green Tea, that i really love there. Good Quality of Green Tea. And something you have to know! Share with everyone the food you order, it is the good way of eating there, and order 1 or 2 plates at a time. Because they are really fast in preparing the meals, and the plates are big, and the tables are small. Finally the staff is great, i remember the waitress didnt know a word of french, and now they almost fully speak french. Kazu as the most seductive smile. and if you tell him your going come back tomorrow, he will have the cutest laugh ever!I would go back only for his charming smile. :)oh i have mention, the price, for me its cheap, some consider expensive, but for everything we ate, we paid 140$ all, that includes a  30$ of tip"

Instead of talking about the food, I'll share the dining experience.   We got there at 520 pm and there was a line.  While you're waiting they come out, ask how many are in your party and give you a menu.  When the door opens, the place fills up immediately, and you might get seated at the counter even if that's not your preference.  That's ok, because you'll get to watch your food, and everyone else's, being prepared.  One gentleman seemed to know where every dish goes, even though it seems as though he's focused only on cooking.  We enjoyed our food, and the experience.  I wouldn't miss it if you're in Montreal."

We arrived at 12:45pm on a Wed for lunch and had to wait about 20mins to be seated. The restaurant is very small - it is meant for a quick bite and definitely not suitable for groups more than 3 or 4! Despite the wait, the food was worth it! I would recommend getting the Ramen (only avail at lunch!), which was a large portion for $12 and includes sliced pork, half an egg and lots of bean sprouts. The broth was chicken broth on the day that we went and it was very tasty and not too oily. My boyfriend ordered the Tuna Salad Bowl for $15, which he really enjoyed and said would order again. We also ordered a Shrimp burger to share after reading so many positive reviews about it - it was a little disappointing because the patty was too salty and heavily sauced. The sake ice cream was unique and tasty, but very tiny portion for $5 (it is about the size of a shot glass)."

We ordered a daily special tuna capriccio for appetizer - it was the best dish but very pricey. The service was not so great either. We were rushed throughout. Since the minute we sat down we were asked to order drinks. I understand there were people waiting for tables but the servers didn't need to come to our table every 5 minutes making sure we had moved to the next dining stage. I felt I was being pushed to finish the food instead of enjoying it.

It is probably the most authentic Japanese place that I have ever been to. If you can stand the wait to get in, you will be greeted by some very enthusiastic hostesses who whirl around the dining area servicing the tables, yelping back customer orders with this crazy Japanese inflection that makes it sound like you are on a game show. Most items are served cold, or cooked very quickly, and it is assembled by a very content head chef who pretty much just stands there behind the main bar, squeezing this arsenal of 15 or so sauces all over colorful plates with fish and greens. Not to be missed. Everything is very carefully prepared.*Advice for the dumb American tourists out there* - This place is so Japanese that it is even considered impolite to leave a tip.

Now, regardless of what this restaurant may look like (small, plain, cramped, etc...) do not, under any circumstances let this deter you from eating here. You would be missing out on some of the most amazing Asian food Montreal has to offer. Onto the food itself- let me just start out by saying that during my visit, I ate here three times, I just had to keep coming back for more! Everything I tasted, from the octopus tentacle, to the gyoza, to the salmon sushi rice bowl to the shrimp burger was incredible. Kazu takes traditional Japanese dishes, and serves them up in new, inventive ways filled with mouth-watering flavours. My only regret about this place is that I couldn't come eat here more often...

Maybe that's why. First things first. Service was bad. We were just starting with our appetizers and they had already brought our mains. We felt as if we were being kicked out, even though there wasn't even a line at the door. The beef carpaccio was very good and tasty, the ingredients in everything were all fresh, but the Shrimp burger was basically a shrimp patty with A LOT of mayo. Nothing spectacular really. And the salmon tuna sashimi bowl was such a waste of great fish. Such tasty pices of heaven mixed with lettuce and other crudities. Hardly any dressing. Needless to say, it wasn't spectacular either. Add to that a crowded tiny hole, a not so welcoming atmosphere, and a relatively high bill. All in all, has INCREDIBLE unexplored potential --  Don't go there expecting a feast - the place is definitely OVERRATED."

When we got there, there was a line waiting to get in for lunch. After 25 minutes of waiting, we finally got in. The restaurant is very small and cramped, but the service was very fast and friendly. We ordered the ramen, the pork bowl, and the shrimp burger. Everything is as good as previous reviews mentioned: fresh, delicious flavours, and portion sizes that will fill you up. The prices for lunch were also reasonable. I am very glad I tried it, and I will be back to taste more of their menu."

It was our favorite place in the city! Sometimes it is crowded and you need to wait a while to get a table, but it is well worth it. The staff are always super-friendly and welcoming, and the food is simply incredible.My favorite dishes were the 48-hour pork and the tuna-salmon bowl. My wife's favorites were the vege hot pot and the green tea ice cream. In any case, all the dishes we tried were excellent. It is also worth trying one of the dishes featuring their home-made tofu (like the kimchi salad or vege hot pot)."

You wont regret it.After reading all the reviews here I was expecting a line outside on the frosty Monday evening I went to Kazu.  I must have just timed my arrival at 5:30 perfectly though. The hostess at the front door and some of the other team greeted me with a warm ""Irashaimase!"" and I got the last seat at the bar. It's a very tight space with very few seats (12?) which really adds to the intimacy of the place.  I loved sitting at the bar as you can get so caught up in watching the chefs prepare all the dishes.Based on the advice that some of the other reviewers gave I ordered the pork cheeks, the salmon tuna bowl, and one of the daily specials; grilled octopus skewers.The grilled octopus skewers were deliciously charred and sticky with the sauce they put on it.The pork cheeks are presented as a kind of spread around the outside of a plate with some grilled tortilla slices.  For an idea of the taste, think Japanese rillete. I LOVE RILLETTE so this dish was a hit with me.The salmon tuna bowl was a surprise for me. A tasty tasty surprise.  This came out in a large udon style bowl with rice as the base. On top of that were the little chunks of tuna and salmon with some shredded lettuce dressed in in a sweetish sauce.  And on top of all that were the crispy noodles. I got instructed by one of servers to mic the whole lot up with the spoon that was provided.  The end result was each mouthful had a nice blend of sticky rice and meat and crispy crunchy noodles and lettuce.  My description doesn't do it justice, but trust me, it was delicious.I saw a couple of people eating the sake ice cream.  It looked awesome, but after soloing three dishes I was stuffed to the gills.  Not even ice cream room. The fact that I had a pint of Sapporo, which they have on tap, probably did me in.At the end of the day I would thoroughly recommend visiting Kazu."

Catherine in Montreal, but nearby the problematic Odaki? Well it's truly the case. Kazu is here, and it is good! Their menu is varied - so varied they blanket the walls in options - and we end up drooling at many of the shared dishes. The staff are helpful and bubbly about the food they serve, and it shows as we picked apart every seasoned dish down to the rice grains.There are a few catches though: 1) It's very likely you'll be waiting in line, and 2) the Lunch menu is very limited. Dishes like Ramen won't even last through lunch. If you want the real experience, you need to come at night, when you can pick from the specials on the walls.It goes without saying that Kazu is not cheap, per se - it's a trendy shared eating experience, not a lunch bar - but it's definitely an experience worth having."

I really wanted to love Kazu and even forced myself to start over in my opinion once seated, but again....REALLY? Perhaps I lack patience and need more than a few inches of personal space, but I just don't understand why anyone would stand in a line to eat here...the food is good, but is it really that much better than anywhere else? Hell, I'd much rather throw back a bowl of pho a couple doors down at Vip Pho Saigon.  Yes, I realize it's Vietnamese not Japanese...blah blah blah....after not being able to feel my fingers and toes I would have eaten warm ANYTHING.The green tea is made from matcha powder....no biggie, but still to be noted.Service is fast and extremely friendly...food presentation outstanding....atmosphere is infectious. But the lines and the space just dampen the whole experience.We ate: gyozas...very good. Chicken wings: delicious flavor, but wet...do not order them if you like a crispy wing. Okonomiyaki: the shrimp pancake...I found the pancake to be slightly gummy...all the flavours together were great, would I go back to order this ever again? No. Bibimbap was typical...nothing spectacular. I just don't see the monumental difference between Kazu and any other izakaya resto. Maybe it's a montreal thing. There was a lot of fat on the pork too. ..and I don't mind fat, so I guess  there was TOO much fat on the pork. 48 hour pork: I have read other reviews instructing us to order the 48 hour pork  ""a must have"".....it was tasty, tender, but again...nothing we couldn't find anywhere else any time of day??!! I mean I could slow cook this with my eyes closed??!!! (I am expecting a major backlash for this statement-ha)The shrimp burger was delicious...out of this world delicious crispy and cream saucy, but the furthest thing from a healthy dish...I may have clogged an artery.  All in all, I just kept thinking ....what am I missing? Everything we ate was good and had tried not to be affected with high expectations. Would I jump through hoops to eat there again? No.  Stand in the freezing cold for an entire hour and then knock elbows with my neighbor?  Hell, no. Here's one less person that'll be waiting in that line..."

I took their advice and rocked up there at 5:10 in anticipation of the doors opening at 5:30. There were already four people in line. So, I in turn got my booty in line with them and by 5:30 this line up had already extended town the street. Who waits in line for dinner before 5:30pm? Uhhh, people who are die-hard Japanese food fans that's who! Seriously, I could fit this place in my pocket. It's not only teeny tiny, but a tight squeeze once you're in there. It's a lil loud and a lil hectic, but the food is totally delish! We had the Japanese pancake and grilled mushrooms for our apps. Amazing! Then on to our main dishes - salmon and tuna sashimi and the pork and rice bowl. The food would sound a whole lot cooler if I used the Japanese names, but does it really matter? No, just go there and eat!! But be prepared to feel slightly rushed...or you could always simply avert your eyes from the window...as the line grows longer outside, the hungry customers eyeball your table planning their next dining move. Thankfully, I know how to karate chop so no one was pushing me out of my 8x12 table.

The pork neck is messy and outstanding (you may not want to eat it on a first date, but if you do and all goes well, you've found a keeper), and the tuna-salmon bowl always hits the spot. I'd also recommend the very tender octopus tentacle and the chicken yakitori (charred, caramelized perfection). No meal here is ever complete without some of their delectable soft-serve ice cream, which you can get dusted with Earl Grey tea (among other flavours), or doused with sake. So good.

/user_details?userid=6RVbmq6q5TbhCvr9-4onHQ,Randy H.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",3 star rating,"Ok, so this place has been getting a lot of rave reviews for its food. I went a few times for lunch and supper and every time I went the line-up was about 45 mins. The trick for supper is to go when it opens, at 5:30pm or a bit earlier so you are part of the first wave in.The place only seats about 25 people so its really tiny. I've tried the Teriyaki Chicken Burger ($10) & Ramen noddles ($12) for lunch and the Galubi (beef short ribs, $15) for supper. I had a taste of the Onigiri rice balls and the Salmon head as well. The food tasted good, but I must say that the portions are really small (the photos make the plate look decent but it's extremely light).I understand that this isn't McDonald's of a buffet but if you come out hungry after eating two main courses, the plates might be insufficient. Their ""chicken tails"" brochettes had about 3cm (just over an inch) of meat on it!That being said, I suggest that you drop in Kazu for some great tasting food if you aren't hungry. I don't know if pure foodies would be totally against this review because it's supposed to be about quality and not quantity but it's a bit of a downer to be starving after a meal.After Kazu we went out for dessert at Cacao 70 and returned home right away and one of my buddies, Satya, started to cook something to eat (and he is not a huge eater!).

The food was not as precise and pristine and clean as I expect from Japanese cuisine.  There is a nice variety, but the quality was not impressive.  I had heard so much good about this, but I think the high ratings were not justified unfortunately.  The place needs more precision and fresher incredients.  Perhaps they are trying to do too much.  I might go back and try the ramen.  I have heard good things from a Japanese expat-but she is quite young, and sometimes younger eaters have a different sensibility than old fogies like me.  My wife-Asian-was even less impressed."

We had the fresh raw tuna and salmon bowl (not the tartar) and the vegetable bowl. The tuna and salmon were cut super thin and they only gave you 6 pieces total (total rip off!!). You can't really tell if the fish is fresh or not because they put so much sauce on them. We were originally going to get the vegetable soup but were told that they used chicken broth (hmmm who used chicken broth to do a vegetarian dish??). Anyway, we decided to do the vegetable bowl without the tofu. We thought we would get more than just salad leaves as part of the bowl but how wrong were we!!

Not only do they offer great lunch specials (including their salmon rice bowl, their 48-hour pork, and the city's freshest, most generous, and best ramen), but they have an extensive dinner menu that has included such knockouts as bbq pork neck, grilled tuna belly, chicken & pork bbq brochettes, and their special homemade tofu (Sundays only) over the last year.  The atmosphere is lively, entertaining, and gracious.  The bar seating can be a tad bit warm on hot & humid days, but it's generally my preferred place to sit for the banter and the floor show (as long as you're a party of one or two).  In short, this joint is brimming with a certain something that Blonde Redhead once referred to as ""kazuality.""  Be careful--it's habit-forming (which is one of the reasons the lines can be so long).  Definitely my 2010 Montreal restaurant of the year.  No other restaurant was so consistently good, no other restaurant was so desperately needed."

It felt back in Japan again, the deco, the staff, especially the narrow space. It was so crowed, so packed, I couldn't take off my coat, because there was no place to hang it anyway. My wife had to hold her bag on her laps, there was no extra chair (stood) for bags. The food was okay. We didn't enjoy it. I was in a rush to finish my ramen in order to give my seat to people waiting inline on the sidewalk. I felt hot wearing a coat while eating hot ramen. I couldn't turn my body without touching people around me. All in all, it was not a pleasent experience. I have never gone back since. That was the once and only suffering for a bowl of ramen. Not worth the waiting. Instead, I found this Big in Japan recommended by Anthony Bourdain in his TV show (no reservations, lay over). It is on the corner of Pine street and boulvard St-Laurent. It has a red sign in katakana says Big in Japan. Below it is boisserie japonaise. The food, wow, I like everything on and off the menu. The ramen is signature. The braised pork, yammy. If you are lucky, you may have their Black cod as dinner special for $35 something. Worth every penny. Miso steak for $70, enough for three to four middium rare steak lovers. And all prices are taxes in. Service is very friendly. Environment is so casual. My first choice for comfort food. Sadly it doesn't open for lunch on Saturdays and Sundays."
