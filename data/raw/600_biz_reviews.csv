The butter chicken poutine is huge and well balanced, feels more like a full meal than a normal poutine. I've only ordered from this place never got the chance to go in person but the food always comes hot anyway."
/user_details?userid=oLU779Uzm1zvPsvr2yKuRA,Yasmin B.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5 star rating,wow. The only thing wrong with this meal was that it came without napkins.I ordered on a WHIM. I had the butter chicken with coriander and the chicken tandoori with the mayo. I honestly had no idea how either would turn out and we were very pleasantly surprised!! The chicken tasted great and the sauce combination was delicious. Highly recommend this place - the samosa's were great and the garlic naan was also pretty good. I should've ordered dessert.

I was disappointed, yet again. I ordered the cauliflower bowl and samosa. The bowl was below average. Samosa: worst samosa ever. It tasted oily and gross."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Got the butter chicken bowl with spicy potatoes and grilled veggies with a side of garlic naan. The naan was good and chewy. The potatoes were very flavorful. The bowl quite a lot of stuff for the price. The only thing I didn't like was the chicken (too dry) and the grilled veggies (slices too big).
/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"After a terrible previous experience, we were in the area and craving some indian fast-food. After speaking to the manager about our previous experience,  they were very apologetic and assured us that as they had just opened, they were still training the staff who made mistakes with the order so it would not happen again. We decided to give Spicebros another go and ordered a Butter Chicken bro bowl, bhel puri and samosa chaat to go. I have to admit, it was a huge step-up from the last time, everything was made very well and extremely delicious, comparable to its West Island location. I loved their take-out packaging - the food stayed super warm and looked great.  I am happy to see a big improvement and hope that they are able to keep this up  - it's within walking distance from work and has quickly become my go-to for that cheeky samosa! :P"

Price and speed of a fast food, with a fancy restaurant curry quality. Such a nice concept. Their home made paneer is amazing. The stuffs and owner are very nice."
/user_details?userid=QBe3oadPKot2mtuh8jB1UQ,Gurvinder K.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"The logo and music drew us in while walking past this place in downtown. It happened to be their launch day. They were serving tastings of mango lassi and garlic naan, which set an expectation for the food, especially given it's an Indian take on boudha bowls and wraps. I opted for the bowl, where you chose your veggie and protein (paneer, chicken) with sauce (butter gravy). Then you top it with subway style veggies (lettuce, cucumbers, pepper...) and can add spicy sauces as well. The concept is great, but as an Indian I must say the flavour was a complete failure. I have never seen butter paneer being served where pieces of paneer are taken out of warm water and the sauce is simply poured on. That is not butter paneer/shahi paneer! I was willing to look past the slow and chaotic service given it was their launch day, but they had been open for a month at this point! If the food was good I would have looked past the rest of the experience. On top of that my diced bell pepper had a slimmy consistency as if it had gone bad, which it probably did because an hr later I felt horrible.  Not going back and wouldn't recommend it, especially if you know Indian food."
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I guess I would call this place is the Indian version of Subway, Dagwoods and Quiznos. Instead of your bread you choose the regular naan bread or garlic bread, then choose your protein, which are all Indian dishes such as butter chicken, or chana masala or other choices. Then like the other sandwiches places, you dressed them with your choices of garnishes and any special sauce. You can also make a bowl with same dishes without the naan. They also offer some Indian side dishes like samosas or pakoras. The service is excellent. Since SpiceBros is new in downtown, the owner who served us, is giving samosas in the house. The restaurant itself looks like a typical sandwich counter restaurant with few tables and chairs. The area is downtown on Sainte Catherine east street, and the view outside has nothing to rave about. So I took the Frankie roll made with naan bread, paneer butter and scorpion sauce. Each paneer was humongous size. The butter sauce tasted like the store brought jar though. Scorpion sauce was really kicking. Overall, it's an impressive fast food style forIndian dishes."
/user_details?userid=ElFJieKozbuAeElS8ZJLNA,Kristina D.,"San Jose, CA",4 star rating,"My fiancé and I ordered the butter chicken poutine and it was bommbbb! They were diced potatoes, cheese curds, and the butter chicken + sauce. I definitely would get it again. It was quite large, so it was good enough for two people to share. Spice bro's itself was a great atmosphere and the guy who helped us was very accommodating and gave us sample soup while we waited."
/user_details?userid=Z7aP_YOYaCOa38oBfryYoQ,Kun M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It's a nice fast food counter with an interesting idea of bringing indian food into sandwhiches and pokebowl style. I got a chicken curry with all-dressed veggies in a naan bread. You can add a mint-coriander sauce and/or spicy sauce. Delicious! My friend got a chicken tandoori in a quinoa ""poke-bowl"" style. A more healthy option with good flavours.They gave us sauce samples to help decide what we want to order."
/user_details?userid=JwWYSaemJJR1-Sba-a8_7A,Miles C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Inventive, fresh Indian food, with interesting twists and choices. I haven't actually been inside this place, just ordering out, so this review only reflects quality of the food as it has come. And it's always been stellar, fresh, and totally delicious. The rolls and bowls both are great  -the rolls are like the ultimate shwarmas - and the bowls are full of fresh spices, and can be made very healthy and without BS. Somebody could eat either clean or decadent or both here, and I like that about this place."
/user_details?userid=pwIZ8XOrHgBNZaqLsfke3g,Kathy D.,"Fort Pierce, FL",5 star rating,So fresh! So delicious!The tumeric cookies are the bomb! I could eat this food everyday! Everyone is so nice there tooYou can smell the tandoori chicken down the street. The garlic naan...mmm
/user_details?userid=aH-e0gtf7cLjqPpfC0C7Gg,Remi R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Nice for what it is. It is a new concept. Fast food Indian food. Really nice and easy. The idea is amazing. Their mango juice is out of this word. I took the bowl with butter chicken and a choice of two sides. All was amazing. Really nice. I hope they always keep their good quality and speed.
/user_details?userid=d7FI9OlrQKJUjzOnqZh0Nw,Ayesha R.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"From India to Montreal, the love for butter chicken is forever a craving. When I hear the word frankie it excites me, makes me feel home. And here in Montreal I found it in SpiceBros. The butter chicken my personal favourite is super yummie it's worth every penny and it's quite large, we can also customise it. It's a must try for every Indian residing in Montreal. :)"
/user_details?userid=QnvI1-V9pqEzGfMcIILh4A,John Paul F.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Despite the kind of unpleasant ""bro"" name, this place has really good food and helpful service. I got a bowl with tandoori chicken and veggies and beans. The flavor combination wasn't exactly Indian, but it doesn't matter because it was very tasty. Don't be afraid of the spiciest ""XXX"" sauce; it's really just normal Canadian-level hot sauce - spicier than Taco Bell, for sure, but not even close to deserving its extreme labeling. I got really good service, which I appreciate. The only negative I have to say is that the dish assembly process isn't laid out correctly. You go from one side of the prep table to the other and back and you have to dance past other customers backtracking the same way. It's understandable for a new concept, but it should be addressed.The fast casual formula is everywhere these days but I really think this idea will succeed because the service is good, the food is good, reasonably priced, and fast, and you can healthily if you pick the right ""mix-ins""."
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"We came here on Sunday evening for dinner (on the inauguration of the place) with super high expectations. After hearing the funky music, seeing the cool logo and being impressed by the concept, we decided to try the food out at this new Indian Chipotle-like restaurant. We both opted for the paneer bowl. The concept was to add two base ingredients (ex. Rice and potatoes) topped with your main dish (ex. Paneer) which was then doused in your flavour of choice (ex. Butter) and then sprinkled with a bunch of different salad ingredients (Subway-style) and drizzled with a sauce of your choice. I assembled my butter paneer bowl and was shocked at the chaos behind the counter - 4 employees were working who were all scrambling over one another with zero organization or leadership involved. It was a total mess! After finally getting my food I was excited to try it - I figured that the chaos was just due to the fact that they were new and hadn't sorted out their system yet but after my first bite of paneer I was sorely disappointed. The food was so underwhelming (for someone who knows good Indian food). My food buddy that night was a close Indian friend who felt the same way. On top of this, shortly after we left, we both developed a weird nausea/heart racing episode (about 1hr after). All this to say that the experience was pretty bad overall. 1 star docked for the chaos, another two for the unfortunate meal, and one more for the malaise following the meal. Really wanted to love this place but can't recommend it - sorry!!"

/user_details?userid=gfKOT3OYU-Ogyz_5-5jBvA,Minjee H.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,One of my favorite places in Montreal to get a quick bite to eat. Super clean and everyone was super nice
/user_details?userid=VI06Hgl9Khp2No6PxxnWTw,Aisha F.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,Delicious food and very friendly staff! I ordered a wrap with the spinach paneer and it was very good. My friend also liked the bowl they ordered. As we were eating the owner came out to ask how everything was and we could tell he really cared about the restaurant. I'm very picky about food and this definitely hit the spot.
/user_details?userid=xYoWDlgO2ftkpgc-fw56ng,Laura M.,"Medford, MA",5 star rating,"SpiceBros treated me and my friends like family. They had something for every palate taste. The food was amazing, lots of flavor! I can't wait to go back."
/user_details?userid=JCuBTCCa-o5B0wwvs4dwkw,Brooke B.,"Greendale, Worcester, MA",5 star rating,SpiceBros was nothing short of amazing! By far one of the tastiest foods I've ever had. They have a delightful assortment of different sauces to add the perfect amount of flavor. We were visiting from Massachusetts and I'm sad that I couldn't not take this restaurant home with me. They make their delicious naan bread right in front of you and it did not disappoint. Not to mention their customer service was great as well. YOU WILL NOT REGRET STOPPING HERE!
/user_details?userid=99PrzMl_bMnhXPjQ2qPrTQ,Lauren H.,"Silver Spring, MD",4 star rating,"Everything here is nicely spiced and better than it needs to be. The saag paneer is delicious and the naan is outstanding. There is a good variety of fresh and cooked veggies. The only thing I'd recommend is to add more actual vegetarian proteins. Cauliflower and other veggies aren't proteins, but some tofu would be good, with cauliflower and the other veggies recategorized as sides. That said, I'd go again if I lived in Montreal. Good for a tasty spicy bite."
