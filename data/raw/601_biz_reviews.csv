I know some reviews complain about the portions and prices, but this is a real fine dining experience(and filing)!Before getting into the food, i should point out to the high ceiling, stained glass, old school bar and the decor that reminded me of my Mediterranean native city old bars! Speaking about food, this place is the crowned king in upscale Greek food category, and Marven is the king of the mid range ones. Just for the record, Marven also wins when it comes to fried Calamari.Back to Philinos, , i  tried around 10 items(ordered family style)  and  both execution and presentation were sophisticated and satisfying. Hands down the best Greek sausages , Pork Souvlaki and Mousaka in town(Kudos to the smokiness of the sausage and the tenderness of the medium raw souvlakis). However, what really shows the quality compared to regular Greek restaurants are the spreads , Tzitzaki and fried cheese(Saghanaki). Those items can easily get too oily in most restaurants. But here, it was the perfect balance between garlic, oil and eggplants/cheese/potato."

If you are looking to avoid getting dinged in the wallet at Milos, this restaurant is one of the better alternatives. While they don't pretend to have 20 varieties of fresh fish and produce flown in from Greece daily (like that even matters...), they consistently put out a delicious and hearty feast.On a recent delivery order, I couldn't resist their homemade Moussaka which I had ordered before. The Moussaka tasted fresh and was overflowing with large slices of eggplant and potato with the requisite creamy bechamel sauce which had been broiled onto the top. The dish was overflowing was a thick bolognese-like portion of well seasoned beef. This is the dish to get on a cold January night in Montreal. As good as the Moussaka was, I also really wanted to try some of their famous grilled chicken. Here's the pro tip: While I wasn't going to order a whole chicken platter which would have been too expensive, I noticed that the delivery menu has souvlaki pitas on it selling for about 8 bucks. I ordered the chicken pita. What a score. They must have packed that poor pita with 7 or 8 ounces of freshly grilled chicken breast. You can tell immediately that you are biting into something special as opposed to the charred little brochettes of chicken one usually finds in a Greek pita. The meat was extremely juicy and thick. The Greek salad was ok, but could have used a touch more feta. In the age of Covid, once a salad is dressed and sealed in a container, the vegetables begin a slow descent into sogginess that cannot be helped or blamed on the restaurant. The meal was served with 4 slices of that ubiquitous crusty whole wheat bread that is a standard at Montreal Greek restaurants; nice touch! I'm wishing this restaurant  good luck in surviving this pandemic!"

It's a family-owned restaurant and I feel that their food don't do Greek food justice.We started with the saganaki, that was good. Then ordered the fried zucchini and eggplants; they were so battered you couldn't taste the vegetable. Then came the calamari, which were too rubbery followed by the tiganopsomo and kopanisti which was actually good.We ordered the octopus which was meh.Their mussels were decent and the grilled shrimp was amazing.The grilled meat was good, nothing special and so was the Greek salad.For dessert we had the loukoumades which I do NOT recommend.It was overall ok, but probably won't be returning."

Want them to think you are cultured and have a refined taste in wining and dining? Well, Philinos is a great place to entertain these relatives for the evening. This place has a classy, yet still homey atmosphere (much like the restaurant in the Pixar classic Ratatouille, except without rats). The menu boasts an array of Greek delicacies. The meat dishes are high priced, but if you go for a vegetarian platter to share amongst friends it will satisfy you for a decent price. I hope you enjoy, and I hope the boujee relatives get the bill!"
/user_details?userid=3QJ_QDl_hCxfERkuFqrinA,Lisa M.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,Great restaurant. Food is perfect. Staff is personable and knew how to take care of guest. I told him it was my bosses birthday. He surprised him with a dessert with a candle on it. We were very pleased. Best dinner ever one this week during our stay in Montreal.
/user_details?userid=nptaypYVM2RVTgm0uuCzeA,Henry L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"As a student on a budget this place would not be for me unless I won the lottery or my friend's dad was in town and offered to pay (such was the case). Philinos is fantastic and has a terrific interior. I arrived expecting a more budget place and felt slightly out of place considering how well dressed the clients were. Don't get me wrong -- this isn't incredibly fancy, but more classy. The Greek salad is amazing (stay tuned for picture), and the Vegetarian platter served our group of three perfectly. Service is prompt, professional, and above all considerate. This is not Olive Garden, so come with a full wallet (meal for three cost $100+) and an empty stomach. Bread with olive oil and vinegar is also a must have (and free!)."
/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Recently went to this great Greek resto nestled in the heart of the Mile End and really enjoyed their food.  The resto ambiance itself is classy with it's eye catching bar stretching from end to end. Service was super-friendly and they have a DJ spinning great tunes on Friday nights! The food was really great starting from their entree of fried zucchini and eggplant with a side of their home made tzatziki to their souvlaki dishes..all were super tasty! I recommend leaving room for their awesome cheesecake baklava dessert!  Yummy!  Would definately recommend for family events or birthday parties or night out with friends!

You can find them in any average Greek restaurant. What my disappointment was the services. First, I know there was not a lot of choices on the menu but please do not rush us to make our choice. Then I find the waiter keep on making decision for us, in a negative way. After the main course, we expect to see the dessert menu but they just briefly said  what they have. It wasn't clear at all. We ended up ordering something. Once the desserts were served, they put our bill immediately on our table without asking. That is so impolite for a restaurant. In conclusion, service is not up to scale."
/user_details?userid=9bvlW5Gos1kxzvcM3c-12w,Don P.,"Hampden County, MA",5 star rating,"A wonderful 5 Star Montreal Greek restaurant dining experience! From soup, salad, main course, wine, dessert and after dinner drink Philinos was an absolute dining delight with hospitality and service to match. My son and I started with two Pils Hellas Greek beers which were excellent followed by grilled octopus, lentil soup and a village Greek salad, both soup and salad where very good. The grilled octopus was beyond belief in both flavor and tenderness this is one item you do not, under any circumstance, want to miss! We both ordered lamb chops medium rare with Greek potatoes and fresh vegetable medley. The lamb was cooked perfectly, so juicy, tender with a perfect char coating from the broiler. Even the fresh vegetable where cook to perfection slightly al dente just the way I prefer. This sumptuous meal was accompanied by a bottle of Greek red wine Feast Semeli, it too was excellent as it was on the lighter side and didn't masked the delicate flavor of the lamb. Our dessert was Karidopita, a walnut cake with simple syrup which was not to sweet and delicious, a real stand out. The meal was finished with two glasses of Mastiha, an after dinner liqueur made from the resin of the Mastic trees of Greece this is another don't miss as well. Philinos is not inexpensive but that won't matter after you have begun and ultimately finished your Greek culinary dining adventure there."
/user_details?userid=AiOqFKs9kkIFfmJOJwchwg,George B.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"We've been going to Philinos since it opened many years ago. With the kids, with family and friends, for occasions, with the gang from work, or just 2 of us for a nice dinner and wine. The food has been delicious since day 1. The staff is always friendly and there when needed. Most recently we went for lunch, 4 of us. We ordered a lunch mixed grill plate, some octopus, grilled vegetables and a salad. Oh, forgot about the tZatziki..mmmm. Everything was delicious, the octopus tender tasty and plenty on the plate. The veggies nicely grilled, and not a bad piece of meat in the mixed grill. The tzatziki was prepared old school, like my grandma use to make, thick with the right amount of garlic and herbs.Bravo to this outstanding restaurant for maintaining such a high quality throughout all theses years."

Main dishes could use some extra choice, but being a classical place, acceptable. Great service, very accommodating for groups."
/user_details?userid=-y8mv6-8C-IJWsy00EWAfA,Jehanne A.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I thought I couldn't go wrong with this 4 1/2 stars rated greek restaurant but for once I was disappointed to follow the reviews.We arrived in an empty restaurant with all the staff chatting at tables and wondering why in the world anyone would walk in... After all, it's only a restaurant right?!We ordered the vegeterian mezzes, despite the fact that we thought it was quite expensive (52$) hoping it would at least be good. Oh woe is me...We received badly re-heated mussaka, two spanakopitakia and two tyropitakia that had invisible flakes of feta in them, four dolmadakia that were simply wondering were they were and some grilled vegetables that had been taken too quickly from the freezer to the grill and to the plate... All that for 52$... I think next time I will cook my own greek food, it will be less expensive and I'm sure it won't be worst.PS: Two stars just because despite all that, our waiter was great!"

The waiter was very helpful. We have been to Greece many times and can testify to the authenticity of the Greek dishes, e.g. Moussaka, Souvlaki, Roasted Potatoes (yum...), Village Salad. A great place for lunch....or dinner.A very friendly atmosphere with beautifully crafted, real wood paneling.Two Tourists from Massachusetts"
/user_details?userid=_4BSAIgqbsHq_m3mwaEEBQ,Tanya V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I come here, or try too, every time I am in Montreal. Amazing Greek food and I like the ambiance. If you're a couple, it's nice to sit up at the bar! I like to start with tzaziki & saganaki as an appetizer. For the main course I like to get the meat platter which is a mix of different Greek meats so that you have a little bit of everything. The honey balls for dessert is a must as well!"
/user_details?userid=-jUHM8H7NJPvhe2xFG7SbA,Sandy S.,"Riverside, CT",4 star rating,"Had a late lunch at Philinos - off peak hours made for a relaxing and enjoyable meal, with assorted cold Greek apps, Greek salad, and chicken kebabs with tzazkiki sauce. Great fries and steamed vegetables.  Delicious baklava for dessert.   Friendly helpful service. Family friendly. Would recommend and return."
/user_details?userid=Cry-QskOaOoppxogkZ9rNw,Mary B.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I used to be a big fan of Philinos but this place has gone downhill and prices have skyrocketed. Calamari is frozen and ok but not for 19$; the biggest ripoff is the octopus at 35$ for barely one tentacle. It had about 6 pieces of very moist octopus but the price is ludicrous compared to other Greek restaurants of similar caliber. The meat platter was decent but all the meats were under seasoned. Overall, decent food but not worthy of the high mark-up on most of the menu. You will eat very well with much less at other comparable Greek restaurants in Montreal. Don't waste your time here."
/user_details?userid=1Bljt-GngRP4XxkQFLnHHQ,Rod M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,One of my favorite Greek restaurants in Montreal. I enjoy it both for its good food and lively evening atmosphere. This is a great place to go out with a group of friends for a fun night. The menu lends itself to ordering many items for the table and sharing them amoung everyone. Some of my fav's are:- fried octopus (the house specialty)- calamari- Saganaki (served flaming at your table)- fleshly made Spanakopitakia- Kolokithia Tiganita - lightly fried zucchini & eggplant- Greek salad of course- Jumbo Shrimp- grilled rack of lamb- and for dessert Loukoumades -  deep fried dough balls served warm and drizzled with honey

/user_details?userid=2bfpsTEAuAsY93ELDBVr_A,Orly R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I haven't been to an authentic greek restaurant like this in a long time. I really enjoyed my meal from beginning to end! I started off with the fried zucchini/eggplant and had the lamb chops as the main course. Cooked and seasoned to perfection! I would definitely recommend this cute trendy place! :)
/user_details?userid=eJvWbwv5AcNd-x-N_OjqNA,Chris H.,"Communauté-Urbaine-de-Montréal, Canada",4 star rating,"VERY GOOD! Recommended to me by several people when discussing where to eat good Greek in Montreal. Philinos is a smallish restaurant, not cramped, but not grand either. There's some typical decor paying homage to Greece but overall the place is pretty charming and comfortable. The atmosphere lends itself more to casual than anything formal. There's a small patio that is covered by vines and leaves that, when makes for a great place to plant yourself and hang out with food and wine. It's the kind of setting that you could easily picture loud conversations and a lot of laughing.The staff was friendly and attentive, two things I really appreciate. Delivery of the food was well timed, we never sat long without another plate showing up, we were given ample time to get into to it before another plate arrived but we never felt rushed in anyway. Recommended (and mentioned in reviews often) was the grilled octopus ... quite possibly the best I've ever had. Excellent consistency and flavor and cooked perfectly.  The rest of the food was good to very good and all pretty standard Greek plates but above standard in quality. They also have a nice selection of Greek wine, which should be added to the recommendations. I found it reasonably priced, it didn't break the bank  and I had a really nice experience."

/user_details?userid=-Aw9kRoXmFptUMN2XkJY9w,eric g.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I am a regular visitor to Montreal, and over the years I've been to Philinos at least a dozen times, on visits ranging from dates with my Greek Montrealer better half, to an after-work dinner with ten hungry colleagues on a business trip, to a special-occasion family lunch for  30. And I've never had anything less than an excellent meal. The best way to eat at Philinos is to order a bunch of hot and cold pikilia (appetizers) for the table, and one main course to share. My favourite dishes (confirmed on a visit with friends earlier this week): grilled octopus (tender, not at all tough or greasy, lightly charred), fried zucchini and eggplant, and the most amazing lamb chops (served by the pound). And of course the loukoumades - best described as Greek timbits, balls of dough lightly fried and dipped in honey. They are light, fluffy, sweet but not overly so, and always made to order.I can't say whether Philinos is the best Greek restaurant in Montreal, because I never get around to trying the rest. But it's certainly the best Greek restaurant I've been to in North America. Toronto's famed Greektown, where I have been pretty much everywhere, doesn't have anything that even comes close."

I ate here recently with my good friend and was extremely surprised with what I experienced.I had a lychee martini (it was SOOOO strong - but this is obviously just me - I never drink!) but the waiter was so kind and offered to cut it down with more juice and split it into two drinks for us. The service was amazing and the food was really delectable! As well, you will never be disappointed with the size of the platters. Next time I am definitely trying out the Saganaki (as it was pretty entertaining to watch the waiters try to not set the restaurant and patrons on fire! - J/K!)"
