/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been coming here from time to time since at least 2004. Over the years have brought out-of-town friends here for dinner many times and always love it. Sitting on a prime location next to the historic Lachine Fur Trade and the Parc Rene Levesque and the Lachine waterfront, in Lachine's old village, you can't ask for a better outdoor location especially during the summer and during sunset.They also have a big terrasse out back.I should stress this is NOT Mexican fast food. This is real Mexican home-grown food with probably the best Chicken Mole in Montreal, chicken in that amazing chocolate spicy sauce served with cactus, rice and refried beans. Their sangria and their tres leches cake (3 milks cake) is also amazing. It is a family run operation with traditional Mexican decoration everywhere.  When I came on Saturday night with a buddy,  all the surrounding tables were full and there was a happy hum to the place.This isn't high-end dining but they must be doing something right for staying in business all these years."
/user_details?userid=BRjLfb-VxfcX23t2Vtz2dw,Katie W.,"Baldwinsville, NY",5 star rating,Very underrated place for great Spanish/ Mexican. Came here to get away from the hectic Montreal scene and it did not disappoint! We ordered the red snapper and mixed seafood dish and both were fresh and delicious. It is a beautiful atmosphere where you can sit on the porch and watch the nearby water. 10/10 would recommend this place and would love to come back!
/user_details?userid=sEv7OmC9rm1JLEOGciWFxQ,Carin R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place gets a high rating because the service is awesome and the setting is super cute overlooking the canal. I tried the mole chicken plate and the chinichurri steak, as well as the guac for an entree. Nothing about the food was standout but I could tell that a lot of regulars go there so the ambiance made up for it I guess. Prices were fair, for the two mains, guac and pitcher of sangria, it was just under a 100$ with tax."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Cute little mexican place with a tiny terrasse right next to canal Lachine. They have very decent mexican food such as the fajitas. The portions are pretty good and you don't leave hungry at all. Make sure you reserve before going if it's during a nice warm summer day because you won't get any places.
/user_details?userid=vj-gGhmf8zw4FJiJ4oWGjQ,Beantpreet K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Om nom nom - literally! Our friends brought us here for dinner just recently. Best Mexican food I have had in Montreal so far, the best! We ordered the chicken enchiladas and chicken tacos AND guacamole with chips obviously. The service was quite decent. The enchiladas and tacos looked mouthwatering and tasted Dee-licious!! The portions are quite generous. I couldn't finish my food so hubby overate. Highly recommend this place for some authentic Mexican food. Can't wait to go back with my father in-law! He loves Mexican food."
/user_details?userid=ZATj1X2wDTUraDTLucZC_w,Rahil S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,By the river. Quality food. Small but authentic Mexican look. Make reservations ahead in time to guarantee a table.Polite and kind staff makes the place even better. Would definitely come back again.
/user_details?userid=zzKsgIF472IyDpJxmHDIpw,Rana E.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"YUM! Happy with their salsa, but couldn't go back to it after they offerred me to try their even spicier green salsa  !Their apetizer of some sort of cheeze ""fundo"" with shrooms and cactus on tortilla bread was really nice, I could have eaten that all day. The cactus reminded me of long green beans and I'm sure I would have enjoyed a whole bowl of it.Beer's good. Draft comes in nice large glasses that aren't too big or small. Their water wasn't plain. It may come in a small glass, but at least they added a nice touch with different citruses ^_^.All 3 entrees and a soup we ordered were more on the bland side, though they were all properly cooked. Their 2 different versions of salsas saved the meals. I'm starting to be really worried about Montreal in general though, it seems that bland is a popular trend everywhere I go here. I'm going to have to figure out how to order in a way where they can understand they don't have to be afraid to flavour up my dishes.One of us ordered a steak well done and I was impressed that it was still tender. Their ""tacos"" are not what I thought a taco was, more like grilled burritos covered in sauce.My mom preffered and really liked the chocolate cake, though my bro and I found it had no kick and was just fair. I think it's a great cake for people who don't have a sweet tooth but want to endulge. I liked how they used pure chocolate on top, that's a very classy touch. We really liked the white cake a lot actually... ""leche"" something, basically made with milk/sweetened condensed milk? I don't remember but it was great ^_^ Neither of their cakes tasted like cheap grocery store types. They tasted and looked more like they were homemade but with special ingredients instead of just plain white sugar.The restaurant itself was very small and cute, overlooking the river with a terass in the front and the back. About 13 tables inside with a lot of traditional decorations! A bit cluttered, but not tacky and very homy, I liked it a lot. The service was very friendly and actually attentive. Our waiter was great ^_^ I'd love to come back in the summer!"
/user_details?userid=1YGElIut40U_DaiPRIYQ-w,Will M.,"Niagara Falls, NY",5 star rating,"The El Meson is a delightful Mexican restaurant situated on the shore of the St. Lawrence river. The flavors are authentic and the service is very attentive. An intimate outdoor patio welcomes you where you can enjoy sangria and gentle breezes off the river.  We enjoyed the guacamole as an appetizer to compliment a half pitcher of sangria. One difference we noticed was the absence of fruit pieces floating in the pitcher. This difference didn't take away from the refreshing flavors. For the main course we enjoyed the carne asada and chicken fajitas. Both entrees were cooked to perfection and were rich in flavor. My only criticism is with the reservation system.  Guests next to us were asked to move after being seated due to a reservation conflict. Overall, I would still highly recommend El Meson for a quiet evening overlooking the St Lawrence."

/user_details?userid=IzQrw0407HFdwFrlohu50g,Wendy S.,"Duluth, MN",5 star rating,My sister-in-law and I happened upon this little Mexican restaurant this afternoon while wandering the walking paths of Lachine. We sat outside and ordered Chile Rellenos and also vegetarian Enchiladas with tomato sauce. Both were delicious...so much so that we brought our husbands back for dinner!  They had the same dishes  (except the tomato sauce was swapped out for a spicier mole sauce on the enchiladas) and were equally pleased. We also had the signature margaritas and they were very good. The staff was friendly and provided great service. The place is decorated in bright colors that make you feel  as if you could be in Mexico and everything is immaculate. Will come back next time we are in the area.
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,The resto is a great spot: a stone's throw away from Rene Levesque parc in Lachine. So it's a nice spot for a break from biking if you're riding from downtown - especially w the family. The food is essentially Tex-mex and it's solid. Nice virgin pina coladas too (no alcohol for me when riding w my 10 year old! - but adult versions and beers are available too).
/user_details?userid=LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A smaller place that sits on the water in Lachine. Colors pop off the wall and the small staff is very welcoming. The place oozes charm which really helps pack a punch in the ambiance. The food itself was flavorful and authentic. Although the prices are ever-little so higher than similar restaurants, there is always an uptick in prices in this area of town so it's actually a competitive price. Had a great time, with great company, will certainly have this place bookmarked."
/user_details?userid=fgBoMSpFDY_TUPIjjK7B3g,Karen R.,"Ithaca, NY",4 star rating,"Very cute and friendly Mexican restaurant on the canal. Large, tasty portions. At our table if 9, my favorite was the cactus salad. We also ordered fajitas, fish, enchiladas and tortilla soup - - all very good and well spiced. Not an extensive beer and wine menu, but a nice selection to choose from. Very friendly staff."
/user_details?userid=djbvvc-_iVdSnOispgb16g,Nisha P.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Came about an hour before closing time, which I know is awful but I had just gotten off work and was  planning on leaving asap (well before the 9pm mark). First, parking took a bit to figure out. Then, from the moment I walked in, I felt very unwelcome. Soon after I was seated, the waiter came to get my order and I asked for a few extra minutes to which he told me that the kitchen closed in 5 minutes...even though the place closed at 9? So I hastily ordered. The entire time I was there, I was never asked about or offered any beverages - not even water. I could just feel that they didn't want me there. There was still an entire hour left before they closed! Nevertheless, as soon as I got my food, I asked for a box and the bill so I could deck out. I'll acknowledge and own up to the fact that it was my mistake for going an hour before they closed but nevertheless, I would not go there again or recommend them, esp after the way I was treated."
/user_details?userid=uKJwRZUyOIViWCbhA5WU_A,Jaya R.,"Queens, Queens, NY",4 star rating,Cutest little place located right across from the water. This restaurant has a very nice ambience to it. Nothing fancy just super authentic and colorful.  Customer service is the key to running a great business and this place sure has got it ! The food is okay a bit salty but I gave them 4 stars because they have amazing customer service. You'll truly feel welcomed.
/user_details?userid=3AxAep0OMmy_LgidsYMdog,Rosemary Silu Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great service, every staff comes with big smiles. Decor in warm colors  that gives you a home-y feel. Pretty popular spot in an otherwise tranquil area. 4 star because both food and drinks we had that day were slightly too salty/sweet."

Very good food and authentic atmosphere.We were strolling around the area and decided to go in to try, was not disappointed! The sangria was great, the food too! Will come back more times!"

/user_details?userid=J42B9QPYjT2aWFtcbLCd2w,Leyli S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,We were there for celebrating an occasion. The food was delicious and more than enough for each person. I mean u can't eat all of it coz it was a lot. But it was salty! Anyway... In Lachine area right by the water it's a perfect place to enjoy the Mexican restaurant. The ambiance was good and Mexican music it makes you more happy. The service was OK!! It seems that they were hire new waitress that they have to learn more and more!  In conclusion it's fine to go over there for once or twice a year. We will be back next year too ;)

/user_details?userid=tDJaEwuWZhbikgORsJyn4A,Krista K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,This very quaint and ideally located in Lachine away from all the  foodie hipsters was just good. I ordered the Gazpatcho to start which was probably the best thing i had. My main dish was the grilled chicken breast in a green Mole sauce with fried black beans and nicely seasoned rice. The service was very good!While Carlos and Pepes it is NOT...it failed to blow me away. I am pretty sure there are better mexican restos to explore in the city but that being said there was nothing bad that stood out....well maybe the $7 lattes!

It seems amazing that you can get such good value again with Quebec high standards of cuisine with such a great view I would highly recommend this place
/user_details?userid=tXOiwYWuGwdI7r73Og4Rxw,Natacha S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"No this is not a fancy place, no they don't have top notch wine and no they can't accommodate huge groups in winter (in summer they do have a terrace in back). HOWEVER, this is one of the MOST AUTHENTIC Mexican restaurants. You can actually taste the ""home made"" flavours. Typical meals that you would find in Mexico. Decor: crooked floors, colourful Mexican things hanging on the walls...PERFECT. It is so appropriate.great cocktails and very nice staff. A+!"

/user_details?userid=0rEGb1hmK_Br4UGOfOBHpg,Allie M.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",2 star rating,"Well things didn't start off that well when we arrived with a reservation for 2, saw an empty table that stayed empty for 10 minutes while we stood waiting.So I'm well aware the Montreal is far from the best place to get Mexican, and as such am rating this place in that context. I did like the decor and beer selection, but the food was not great. I ordered the fajitas and my friend ordered the chicken tacos. The chicken was quite tender, but it just lacked taste. My friend did like his tacos.I doubt I'll be back here. There are several other Mexican joints I would prefer to try."

/user_details?userid=CLb3tAp-5Fz7CbGuLhaffA,Ray G.,"Victoria, Canada",5 star rating,"I live nearby this gem of a restaurant. I fell in love with it on my first visit. They serve the typical Mexican fare. The servers are always smiling and pleasant. I usually order the vegetarian burrito, which is not even on the menu.  I'm making myself hungry just writing this review. Try this restaurant and you will see for yourself.  ;)"
/user_details?userid=S1o7nZH_JHlsAHTrmXqAJw,Marc N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wonderful authentic cuisine and ambiance to suit. We ate here on a Wednesday evening, service was a bit slow but the food was well worth it. Prices are a little steep, but given the difficulty in finding authentic Mexican virtually anywhere in Montreal, this was a definite compromise. Would recommend!"
/user_details?userid=fllQymLLlR5y0Os1slvvNQ,Daniel F.,"Lachine, Canada",5 star rating,Wao! Best mole in town!!!! Amazing service. Little pricy but worth it. Had Enchiladas and nolapito con lomito. Top rated!!!
/user_details?userid=ml9LAhHAWs_XxEiBS434Gg,Jamie L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Solid food. Really authentic and cool atmosphere. This place really is a hidden gem right by the lakeshore!
/user_details?userid=MUu0RpTpQ4UKDIe9jqN11A,jamie s.,"Pooler, GA",2 star rating,"Apparently the other reviewers have never had ""mexican"" food outside of quebec. Otherwise they would know that nothing they serve at this place is even close to being considered mexican food. Service was good, so that's what got them a full two stars instead of one. If you just want some random concoctions of food with sweet sauces, then this is your place."
/user_details?userid=54U70pW3jmrAV9xDbhPTUg,Scott H.,"Topsfield, MA",5 star rating,"Fantastic little find! Attentive, friendly, tri-lingual staff. Great views of the river and park if you can sit on the terrace. Great portion sizes, priced well. Don't forget the Sangria!"
/user_details?userid=REXsFXjXfh8MlwwtJxnFEQ,Chris D.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"Two pitchers of sangria later, I approve.Seriously though, this is clearly a family run joint where the father is in the kitchen and the children are working the front of house. That, plus food which was far more authentic than I expected (umm, cactus garnish?) makes for a small business that really deserves to be rated favorably. Was everything a home run? No, not really... but it was still better than every other Americanized Mexican joint I've been to in the States. Whatever you are doing Restaurant El Meson, please don't stop. Merci."
/user_details?userid=YvQEbFJx93Bt-Pai7SRn9A,J B.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This was once a must for us when in Lachine, and it's still adequate in most respects, but too many things have slipped in quality. At the same time prices have climbed above what we're used to from other similar restaurants. I don't think we'll be back. Examples: on a visit today, my enchiladas tasted of chicken that had been stored in the fridge for too long after being cooked, while the green mole sauce had little flavour;; my partner asked for beans instead of rice, and received literally a tablespoon of beans. On a previous visit, we ordered guacamole for the table, and it was presented attractively like a flower, with nacho chips as petals. But when we finished the chips, much of the guacamole remained, so we asked for more. The waitress told us no! She explained that the chips served on the plate were all we could have with that dish. We were astonished.On the positive side, although service is stretched and painfully slow, it can be very pleasant if you get the right server. Ours was embarrassed by the stingy bean serving, so he sneaked us an extra order of beans gratis. The other server where we're seated was also charming, checking on us a few times to see if we needed anything.Sadly, nice servers can't really make up for poor management."
