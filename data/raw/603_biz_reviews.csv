/user_details?userid=gRA-plF0LiZAE31BNQap_g,Tom P.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,Handmade and homemade fresh dumplings!Recommend: pork & cabbage dumplings (boiled) and beef curry dumplings (pan fried)Getting both of these is a good idea that way you don't get tired of one style or flavor. Decent portion sizes too (12 medium sized dumplings per dish).
/user_details?userid=RJvv0ZZWilGLTkrSJxoOBQ,Foodie A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I excited when we found this place. The dumplings are very fresh and you can watch them being made.On the table there was a single condiment bottle that looked just like soy sauce. We all dipped our dumplings into it liberally and wondered why they had a strong, strange sour taste. Upon scrutiny of the label I found in very small letters the word ""vinegar."" Unfortunately we were finished with our meal at that point and I was feeling disappointed in the experience of having eaten vinegar-soaked dumplings.I looked around and saw that every single one of the other tables had a bottle of vinegar AND a bottle of clearly recognizable soy sauce.I am giving this resto only 3 stars because they neglected to make sure that we had a bottle of soy sauce on our table, which resulted in a poor taste experience."
/user_details?userid=9nj5lry5KkSal22Oo9VGvQ,Cayla L.,"Brossard, Canada",5 star rating,"After trying HarBin, I could agree that this restaurant has the best steamed dumplings. I highly recommend the chicken curry and the shrimp, chicken and coriander. I can't quite remember if it was chives or coriander. The chicken was extremely tender and juicy. As for the environment, it was very clean and the ambient of the restaurant wasn't too loud. I recommend every dumpling lover to try out this place because it is worth every bite of it!"
/user_details?userid=ZFxfMReOr2SFvSSRmGZ7Gw,Vikrant T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,This place is oddly located for a dumpling place so far from everything in the Chinatown. But that's a good thing. The service is good and they have a good collection of dumplings. Many options for vegetarians as well. Gets crowded fast.
/user_details?userid=xSb2qnoa2BxPZZFS9XR3qg,Valérie P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My friend insisted to have me try this place and I should thank her. While I must say that the decor and ambiance are not the greatest, the place is clean and service is good. All of this being better than any Chinese village restaurant I visited. I would suggest this place for a quick lunch but maybe not for a date. We were seated at the bar immediately when we walked in. We order pan fried lamb and chives dumplings and steamed beef and curry ones. Both were excellent. The dumplings are very juicy and you should be careful as they arrive hot as hell. They have different types of Sake served hot or cold. 2 dumplings orders, sake and beer cost a total of $44 plus tip. I will definitely go again and try different dumpling flavours."

/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"For some reason I don't get the opportunity to eat Chinese food as much as I used to so I welcomed an opportunity to meet some friends for lunch here the other day.  HarBin Dumplings is a small, casual eatery and the decor and ambiance is rather bare and simple.  It's fine though when all you want is a relaxed meal in a casual setting.We started off with some miso soup and it was okay.  It was a bit watered down and could have done with a little more seasoning.  I followed that up with spring rolls which I thoroughly enjoyed.  They were very crispy and well-seasoned.  Sadly though, things went downhill again with the dumplings.  My order of steamed dumplings weren't terrible but they didn't really blow me away.  I ordered the pork and cabbage and beef and coriander ones.  Both were kind of lacking in flavour.  Like the miso soup they were okay but nothing spectacular.Service was quick and at $20 (tip included) the price was right.  HarBin is one of those places you come to if you are in the area but it really isn't worth a detour.  The experience here is enjoyable but there is room for improvement."

One of them pipes up that there a place not too far that serves dumplings. We decide to head on out and try it out.  I order a variety of dumplings, fired , steamed and in soup. You can tell that each dumpling was made with care.  The taste was exquisite. I also had some kimchi with it. There were different appetizers on there and each was small but just enough to not overwhelm the dumplings. PS. Going there now again"
/user_details?userid=EJ5ybtY1FqieuS22LHbT1w,Claire L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Love this dumpling spot! Disclaimer: I am no expert in Asian food...What I can tell you is that this place is super reasonably priced for the area (9-12$ for 12 hand made dumplings). They also offer stir fry, edamame, soup.I love the lamb and coriander as well as the chicken curry dumplings. Generally I get them steamed...but they have a great fried dumpling as well! All dumplings are made live on spot, you can even see the cooks through the kitchen window. New, you can also buy frozen dumplings (they don't taste nearly as good at home though...)"
/user_details?userid=i7dva-DqwjyAtLVc2idhNA,Pradeep K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Finally a dumpling place in Mile end, no need to truck all the way to Chinatown or Concordia hood. Standard operating concern, your protein +herb/veg bundled in a dumpling of your choice (steamed, boiled, fried or soup!)They have the fat soaked chilli oil which is key when mixing with soya sauce and Chinese black vinegar. Prices are decent and competitive to the alternatives!"
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"I wouldn't go out of my way for these dumplings, like if you are a dumpling nerd on a dumpling crawl and you're down to your last hour, or last plate of dumplings ever, maybe this wouldn't be my choice for you... but there exists a time and a place where I am in fact a fan. Like for example Tuesday when I was enjoying the weather and walking up to Little Italy from McGill, and needed to sit and refuel somewhere. On that day the yellow mellow friendly vibe of this place, hopping with clients but in like a chill way, and the plate of fried dumplings laid out before me in all their glory were heroic and exactly what was called for. The skins are a little thick, and the filling in my beef and curry was juicy but not quite as tender as at my favourite spots in the world, but the flavour was great and in general tasted fresh. The service was perfect, friendly and welcoming, and left me with good vibes that pushed my stars from 3 to 4 when I remembered all their smiles."
/user_details?userid=6ElgGKOAby0TfzVd4BUXYQ,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,Brutal service. Waitress didn't put in our order and didn't bother telling us so an hour and a half after we ordered we didn't have any food while tables that showed up after us had left. Then our waitress went home. Then someone came to apologize and tell us our food would be out in 10 minutes. 20 minutes later they gave us our food with one of the dishes wrong. Then they started turning off the lights while we were finishing up because they were closing even though the only reason we were still there was because the food took so long to get to us. That said...delicious dumplings.
/user_details?userid=23wjj6EJFD-jlKPW5931Lg,Simon P.,"Albion, CA",2 star rating,"Dumplings have a white and thick doughy skin, not only this isn't particularly pleasant, but also means they can't pack as much filling inside. Ordered porc and coriander in a soup and the broth had virtually no taste, merely flavored water. Their sides of kimchi and cucumbers are $4 each, while these should really be offered with the meal. There is a large video screens plays chefs preparing these amazing filings and tofu soups. What you get on the table is altogether different. Only reminded me of one experience of eating on a plane when I was watching some Anthony Bourdain's cooking show while eating the plane plain food. Just go when you run out of quick options in the neighborhood. Try Sammi and soup dumplings instead near DT. Best in MTL"
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is not the best dumplings in Montreal, there are definitely better places out there. Yet, I find this cute little resto quite charming. Their squid dumplings are not as great, but the lamb dumplings are quite good. The service is quick and friendly, and you get to see how the food is prepared, which is always a plus. The prices are pretty good too, so you won't break your budget. When I'm too lazy to go to Chinatown, I'd definitely consider going back to this place."

Also the chair aren't really confortable (more like stool). But the dumpling are really good ! We tried fry and steam with different combinations of chicken, pork and veggies. The person who serve us was really nice and is was fast. I would recommand to go to this place at noon for a quick break from walking St-Laurent."
/user_details?userid=BytRWk8X1OelSgwwfXd8Aw,Arun D.,"London, United Kingdom",4 star rating,"The standard for decor and atmosphere for Montreal dumpling places is unfortunately low. HarBin shines out as a beacon within a land of despair with its stylish and cool interior. The service was quick and the waitress gave us great recommendations. The dumpling skins were soft, flavourful and the perfect thickness. My advice to vegetarians is go for the tofu&veggie dumplings! They were much better than the egg&chive. The pork & coriander dumplings were also a hit. The only bummer was that the filling in all the dumplings we got were slightly soggy so water started sogging out by the last few dumplings. Polish off the whole experience with a pot of jasmine tea. It's the best remedy for a cold winter ; dumplings and freshly brewed tea."

Plus the place is bright, comfortable and clean.Try the beef curry dumplings, you wont be disappointed. We also grabbed some pork/bok choi dumplings as well and some spring rolls. Everything was delicious, fresh and expertly prepared. Even the spring rolls were impressive, not greasy, fried crispy and delicious!"

Once you go inside, you'll notice that the place isn't huge. In fact, I felt quite cozy in there. The menu shows us that the dumplings can be cooked in 4 different ways: steamed, grilled or boiled (forgot the fourth option) and the choices are quite simple. I took pork and coriander steamed dumplings. Although the service was longer than expected, the overall experience was very good. Would go back"
/user_details?userid=lyY3aOmISGFcfXQhPusyGA,Maude C.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I wish I could take away this last star. Called ahead so we could get a table for four. Once we showed up, we were told to wait 10 minutes. After that, we were told we couldn't have a table. Mind you, other groups of two got a seat right away, and that free table for four was kept empty the whole time. This is the second time I try to eat here and get treated terribly. Good luck keeping your customers. The food is good, but the service remains trash."
/user_details?userid=voFxNdzhG-cDrW_9NzFGbw,Denzil D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The dumplings were amazing especially outside of Chinatown and new Chinatown. Four types, steamed, boiled, fried and in soup. Really tasty. But the service is not very good. They seem to still be working out that part. If you are prepared for service arguably worst than Chinatown then go for it."
/user_details?userid=QeHZjU8MrX6p0vYCqyXiJA,Christina L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Nothing that really blows my mind.First off, it's pretty clean compared to a lot of the dumpling places in Chinatown, but that's probably because it opened not too long ago. I quite like the TV on the wall behind the bar that's playing what seems like ""The Taste of China,"" which I find complimentary to the food. In terms of dumplings, I can't really tell whether the dumpling skins are handmade based on the texture. Nonetheless, I found the dumplings to be quite average. They're served in four different ways: boiled, steamed, soup, and fried (extra $$ for the fried ones from what I remember). The soup dumplings are served in chicken broth, which I find light and warming on a cold day. Paired with a pot of jasmine tea, it's not so bad for a quick hearty dinner.Overall not a bad choice if you want dumplings in the plateau."

Yes, expect to wait a bit if you go at a popular time but it's well worth it. Dumplings are made by hand when you order them, good variety and nice owner and staff. My favorite are the steamed dumplings with pork, shrimp and green onion, there's a whole shrimp in it!"

I saw the award for best Asian food 2017. I figure this is going to be fabulous. Me and my family of 4 found the dumpling soup to be a good size (9 dumplings) for a fair price again a little more expensive than Vancouver. We also ordered the fried noodle which we found to be bland. All in all service was great the place clean but I prefer longs noodle house in Vancouver hands down to any other dumplings I have tried in my life time

It is a pleasant stop between two other favs -- casa del popolo and aux vivres -- now you can watch a show, eat dumplings and then hit aux vivres for some vegan goodness on your way back to the plateau. How perfect is that?We had the pork + chive dumplings and the tofu + veg (steamed). Both were on point!

At this little cosy and well-decorated restaurant, they do hand-made dumplings with high-quality lamb and seafood that you can really feel in each bite at $9-12 per plate. After spending $15/person sharing 4 plates with 3 friends, I have sufficient amount of lamb, shrimp, pork, shitake mushroom, green veggie in my happy belly. Meanwhile, the server continuously comes to refill my tea with a big smile ... Meanwhile, you probably can't even get a ""avocado toast/quinoa salad"" at a hipster brunch place at the same price nearby.
