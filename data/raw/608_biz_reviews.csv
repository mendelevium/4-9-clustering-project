/user_details?userid=DHRupjFv4GyD0tEdj-QNjQ,Mike B.,"FOREST HILLS, NY",3 star rating,"this is a decent Asian fusion place. overall, it's pretty good for the price. they work very fast - it's in a mostly business/office area, so I saw plenty of office workers come in, wolf down meals, and roll out. the chicken ramen was alright. not bad, not outstanding, but good enough. I liked that they don't nickel and dime you with a zillion ramen add-on options; sometimes it's almost too overwhelming. the dumplings were good. yes, I'll eat hot ramen on hot days, you got a problem with that?"

The restaurant is cute and quaint, and the Â staff were kind and welcoming. They made excellent recommendations and the food was prepared quickly. A half size ramen, one bao and a drink came to about $15. I would definitely recommend this place"

Really tasty Ramen, the broth was very good. You can get a large bowl but also just a half portion, which I had because I also had some dumplings. A small menu, but good choices of dumplings or soup and a few other items. Not fancy but seems really authentic."
