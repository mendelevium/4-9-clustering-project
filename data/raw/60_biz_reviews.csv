If you walked by, you wouldn't really think there's a restaurant within your presence. And when you step inside, it looks like your damn HOUSE. That's part of its charm!So you come here for dumplings. The restaurant has a menu of 15 dumpling options (if I remember correctly), and you get 16 per order. I got the pork and chives, and they were DELICIOUS. Juicy, tender, and there's enough vinegar and spice available to make it taste how you want it. The experience is like you're paying to eat dumplings as if you're at home... but you enjoy paying for it? I could be a little crazy, but at least the food isn't. It's gooooood."

My favorite is number 6: Pork, zucchini and shrimps. Ask for the fried ones ;-) You can also buy them frozen to take home and order for pick ups. Will be back again, again and again."

/user_details?userid=YRy4qvvfEqv8bp9672-yCw,Angus Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"What I like about this place is the vibe. It is a nice and warm place located in a quiet street, never too noisy or crowded. This is my favourite dumpling place in Montreal.As an Asian, I have my own standard for good dumplings. This place makes everything from scratch (the shell, filling and even the chilli sauce), you can even hear them chopping the the meat in the kitchen (trust me, hand-chopping makes a huge difference in the filling). The taste is really simple and balance. The dumplings are only filled with basic ingredients such as pork with cabbage or beef with coriander (my favourite), but in every bite, you can taste each ingredient distinctively. With the vinegar and chilli sauce, oh man, that's so tasty and fulfilling. Btw, the dumplings are really juicy and hot inside, so slow down and try not to burn your month."
/user_details?userid=MMOnaaDX0KxM7NHMZ267tw,Gavie V.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"An unexpected treat steps from our Airbnb! I love dumplings and am always looking for a spot that will fulfill my biggest cravings. The place is on the first level of a house, super modest and small. However, you do not feel like you're in a carry-out chinese spot. We took our orders to go since it was so close and very warm inside. Coming from NYC where dumpling portions to price ration can vary heavily depending on your neighborhood, I was happy to see the bountiful amount they provided. We opted for the chicken and mushroom and pork and cabbage and surprisingly were left underwhelmed with the pork. It lacked in flavor which is shocking because usually pork dumplings surpass in flavor to chicken. We did however love the chicken and mushroom!"
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"The dumpling game in Montreal is cray. Every time I visit, another half dozen new ones seem to pop up. The Dumpling Hut seemed right up my alley but even I didn't expect it to be in an apartment. The inside is cozy with only four tables. Cute little post it note compliments adorn the walls when you walk in. Someone needs to explain why there's a traffic light as part of their decor though.Seems to be family run. Daughter runs the front and is the only waitress. Mother is the dumpling maestro. There's eight types of dumplings and three sides to choose from. Can't get anymore concise then that. - Pork and dill ($8.99) - 15 dumplings per order and they're boiled. Took it to go. Comes with a tasty chili soya sauce. Dumplings were fresh and you could really taste the dill. There was the slightest bit of soup inside them. Pretty good overall. Wish I could have tried a few more things but c'est la vie. Bonus they take credit!"

/user_details?userid=XSKwtZUl6wdZqhgF15bqBg,Florence L.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"(4 1/2)  (Français en bas)Went there on a Thursday night with my boyfriend. We didn't have a hard time finding the place because we had read reviews on Yelp beforehand so we were keeping an eye out for it. It's a house remodeled into a restaurant and I think it's family run. They were two cooking in the kitchen and one serving customers. Since the restaurant is small, it felt really cozy and a nice change of pace from a hectic workday. The seats were large which, as a tall person, is always appreciated. It is small so I wouldn't recommend going with more than 3-4 people (You can take them to go though). There was lukewarm lemon infused water and we ordered the chicken mushroom dumplings and the pork cabbage dumplings. We were not expecting the size of the dumplings to be so big but we enjoyed every bite! Service was faster than expected too and the green tea ice cream was very good! At first we wanted black sesame but they didn't have any left :,( The waitress was nice, overall very good and would come back!----------------------------J'y suis allée un jeudi soir avec mon copain. Nous n'avons pas eu de problème à trouver le restaurant puisque nous avions lu des commentaires Yelp avant. C'est une maison-devenue-restaurant et je crois que c'est un restaurant familial. Deux travaillaient dans la cuisine et une servait les clients. Puisque le restaurant est petit, il était très chaleureux, un bon changement d'une longue journée au travail. Les chaises étaient larges, ce qui est toujours apprécié puisque je suis grande. Vu que l'endroit est petit par contre je ne recommanderais pas d'y aller à plus de 3-4 personnes (vous pouvez les commander pour emporter par contre). Il y avait de l'eau tiède infusé de citron et nous avons commandé les dumplings poulet-champignon et porc-choux et nous avons savouré chaque boucher! Le service étai plus rapide de ce à quoi nous nous attendions considérant le nombre d'employés et la crème glacée au thé vert était aussi très bonne! Nous voulions sésame noire, mais il n'y en avait plus :( La serveuse était gentille, gobalement très bon et je reviendrais sûrement si jamais je suis dans le coin!"

I ordered a half serving of the chicken mushroom and the chicken coriander (16 pieces total) and my daughter had the seaweed salad and the pork cabbage dumplings. Very small place so be sure you get there early to get a table.
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Best dumings I've had in Montreal! We ordered the pork chive, lamb coriander, chicken coriander and egg shrimp chive. The wrapper was delicious, there was alot of filling and not too much doughy wrapper and you really tasted the filling of each dumpling. Although the waitress described each dumpling dish, I was able to taste in the flavors and knew which was which without her explanation. I find I can never truly taste the flavors at other dumpling restaurants. The restaurant itself doesn't have many seats so I suggest doing takeout or placing an order and eating in the park. Excellent dumplings!!"
/user_details?userid=NkMOVXd9lb9V57tLaQ4vNQ,An T.,"Rawdon, Canada",3 star rating,"Came to this dumpling place for lunch. The restaurant is located a few steps from Bristol Chai - took us a bit of time to find it as it is a bit hidden. The interior made us feel like we were stepping into someone's house. They offer a decent selection of dumplings and it is possible to mix them. We ordered pork+shrimp+zucchini, chicken+coriander and had them steamed. We also tried beef+onion and pork+cabbage and we had them fried. I personally preferred the latter. Prices were quite reasonable for the # of dumplings we had (10-12$ for 16). Few things I didn't like were the lack of saltiness in the pork meat and there wasn't much soup inside each dumpling.  Overall,  it was decent but I'm not sure if I would come back to try the rest of their menu."

/user_details?userid=2I8gFHc3HoHxbvsvJ09U0A,Young Y.,"Tinton Falls, NJ",4 star rating,"Excellent homemade dumplings made right in front of you. My wife and I were starving after we got off the Amtrak train from upstate Ny. We were greeted with plump handmade dumplings after a 7 hour train ride. We had the pork, chicken, and lamb with cilantro ( called coriander) and one with egg, scallion, and shrimp. Each plate contains 16 dumplings. All 64'of our dumplings were as tasty as the last. We had ours steamed, but looks like you can request them to be fried. So why the 4 stars and not 5? It's a little expensive. Although handmade, dumplings are normally somewhere around $.35 to $.45 per. Seafood should add an additional $.15 per. But this averaged about $.86 per. Something that would probably add more value would be to give some sort of clear broth soup and/or some small side dishes as part of the meal. We got miso soup as well, but $3.99 was kind of a lot of miso soup. Normally that's served for half that. But, eating the dumplings.... you forget all that. They just taste so clean and pure that I would continue eating if I didn't run out of room.In the area and want a quick bite, this is the spot. Incredibly fast considering they are hand made. 64 dumplings came out within 15 mins."
/user_details?userid=DD4KCmjAdJiJfv6yJcb4Uw,Virginia L.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I found or rather I was introduced to an amazing spot for steamed dumplings. I walked into the inconspicuous Dumpling Hut and felt right at home because it is legit in an apartment. I mean the bathroom has a bathtub. Once you go further in you can meet the women who are making your dumplings. They are rolling and forming the dough outside of the kitchen. I love seeing experts cook. The waitress was so sweet and we really enjoyed our meal. The price is also fantastic for all the dumpling you get. I think that this place is a perfect lunchtime meet up with friends. Go forth and amaze your friends with this choice of a hit!
/user_details?userid=GbDfPbqp7gKRwbn116KDSA,Ben K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"There's a dearth of dumpling places in this town. It's all too easy to just go to your old dependable Qin Hua or Mai Xiang Yuan, and roll your eyes as ""yet another"" restaurant opens in your neighbourhood. Biking down Clark towards Sherbrooke, just past Prince-Arthur, I don't even recall if there was anything in this space before Dumpling Hut. What the hell?My biggest criticism of dumpling restaurants in the city comes down to the filling. It all tastes the same to me (with the exception of vegetarian fillings which are consistently disappointing. Steamed, watery egg? No thanks.) When you pack enough sodium and MSG into a pork or beef base, you're going to get the same hit of delicious grease and sodium, but as my lunch companion on this day remarked, you won't be able to make rhyme from reason, resulting in the vague taste of ""beast"".I'm happy to report that the dumplings here at Dumpling Hut are *almost* underseasoned. Almost. Meaning, they're of a perfect saltiness. Combined with soy sauce, vinegar, and/or chili oil, it's just right. And between the dill/pork and beef/coriander, you could actually taste individual ingredients. *Imagine that*. Only downside is that there's no option to have your dumplings fried, but personally I don't mind so much.The cucumber salad also provided a nice, flavorful starter.Once you overcome the feeling that you're eating inside a stranger's apartment with a totally random dormant traffic light as a prop, you're all set.4.5/5"

Pricing is pretty good, too - I got 15 dumplings for about $10. I didn't really like the seaweed salad, it was by the kind of kaiso-type salad I was expecting and the dressing wasn't all that good. Also I kinda wish they had the option for fried dumplings!"

/user_details?userid=hBADi4exXG7eTd90WKwQjw,Eric L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Handmade dumplings is always a treat, but this location kinda fails to deliver anything special. The flavour was lacking, and the price for a dish is more expensive than the other well known dumpling places (in China Town and near Guy Concordia). The dumplings also didn't have much soup inside, which was a bit of a let down compared to the rivaling dumpling places. Their cheapest option is $9 before tax+tip for 15 dumplings, which is more than the other places, for less flavoursome dumplings.The service wasn't great, our water wasn't refilled a single time despite being the only customers in the restaurant at the time (it was early). If you're looking for dumplings and this is the only place close to you, you'll probably enjoy it! However, if you have the option to choose between multiple places and distance isn't a big deal, I'd recommend the dumpling place in China Town over this one."

We had the chicken and mushroom; pork and cabbage; lamb and coriander; miso soup; seaweed salad.  All dumplings were good.  I especially liked the chicken dumplings.  My wife favored the lamb.The time of night that we got there, the chef makes all the dumplings by hand per order.  You can actually watch him put the dumplings together.  The waitress felt our order took to long and she brought a seaweed salad to the table on the house.  I told her if the food is good, I have no problem waiting for it.I really enjoyed the seaweed salad ! Dumplings are very labor intensive.  From the hand rolled fresh dough, the ingredients mixture, putting them together and finally cooking them.  With all that said dumplings range in price from $ 9.99 - $11.99 per order.  There are 16 dumplings per order.I felt this was a very fair price and we have good leftovers for tomorrow.Try this place.  Your tastebuds will thank you."

I'm a vegetarian and they had a few veggie options which was great.Can't think of another place I've eaten at in North America like this, still can't get over the bare bones family vibe this place had it was magic.

The Hut lacks any special decor but it is unique in that you  are practically eating In your Chinese auntie's kitchen.Oh yes about the dumplings, they were very good but they didn't knock my socks off. We had the lamb and coriander and the egg shrimp and chive dumplings.A plate runs between $10 and $13 and the selection includes pork shrimp chicken egg and veggie but there was no combination plates so you had order a big plate of 15.

The more often you visit, the better and more special these outtings become. The Dumpling Hut is an exemplary place for its simple cuisine, its humble setting, and its strive for authenticity. Most of all, it is run by one of the most discrete yet endearing women I have personally met.The restaurant is only 4 months young and I wish I could bring her all the business she deserves. Yet, I selfishly hope it remains this small, manageable neighborhood restaurant so we can forever be graced by the owner's presence because everyone deserves to get to know her, her story and her food.It was a shame I came here alone as I would've preferred to share this experience with others (though I'm sure it won't take long before I dine at one of her tables again).To a long and prosperous business."

/user_details?userid=w-gL6px0iCRb8lJcEFXzlA,Tamim S.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,Gem of a place in the corner of Clark & Prince Arthur. The owner is a very friendly & welcoming lady. Great dumplings and salad at an affordable price.
/user_details?userid=jdCggVgksnavPKuuKbjp9Q,Jakob M.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"Was looking for a quick delicious bite nearby my hotel, and found this gem. You can easily miss the entrance if you don't see the small clapboard sign out front. The inside is like the living room to a home made up as a dining hall, and creates an intimate vibe. The menu is small, so if you're expecting much more than dumplings, you should go elsewhere, but the dumplings are made quick to order and the price is very reasonable. Completely hit the spot of what I was looking for."
/user_details?userid=Z-zO9tLAav1Jh0Plfp6MmA,Wendy Erica L.,"North York, Canada",5 star rating,"Incredible tasty, handmade, authentic dumplings. The ingredients are fresh. Small family team. Portions are fairly large and fairly priced.  I get take out all the time from here. Their menu has expanded to feature over 6 different types of dumplings."
/user_details?userid=vQqTmZkTRmDzq_GxGqyl6g,Joshua A.,"Fort Drum, NY",4 star rating,"Cute, home-style restaurant with a variety of dumplings to choose from. My wife and I ordered a cucumber salad, lamb and coriander dumplings, and pork and chive dumplings. It was all super tasty but the lamb and coriander dumplings took home the gold. The staff was friendly and we will visit next time we're in Montréal. I left as a little dumpling myself."
/user_details?userid=fC7IqOc6iO97WToFtQC8KA,A B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,So yummy. Small husband wife team. In what looks like someone's living room. Small menu. Amazing dumplings.
/user_details?userid=7Cj3RJblijlbbLdmlak3pQ,Eric M.,"Burlington, VT",5 star rating,"Place is great!   Small and in an unassuming location, but dumplings are perfect and owner is very sweet and personable.   They do Togo frozen or fresh dumplings and have more flavor varieties than most other dumpling spots.   So good!"

Dumplings were delicious and incredibly filling. Large portions, but cheap considering. Try the pork and dill and chicken coriander."
/user_details?userid=1Sc_PH_3iH5TvskXzTen1A,Simon K.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",5 star rating,This is a great place with a great vibe. Fast service with delicious food in a calming environment. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for something low key but cozy.
/user_details?userid=i7N7jmQWHFRo0ZKzHWn2Pg,Alex S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Delicious and flavourful dumplings. Portion was smaller than I would have liked, but it was still filling. The woman serving us seemed to be new, and despite some learning she had to do, was still courteous and prompt. I had a quick discussion with the owner who seemed very down to earth and happy to be serving food to new people! Would definitely go back!"
/user_details?userid=uSCXd6bvswjoeBoluXEHEw,Eli N.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Incredible dumplings in a cozy and inviting setting. We had the pork dill, pork chive, and chicken coriander dumplings--all were excellent and the herbs were very fresh and very flavorful. The owner stressed that these were her home recipes and clearly took pride in her menu. We are only in Montreal for a week but will likely be back here before we leave."
/user_details?userid=ZiQnNl4MAZJm6PSvc3NwvA,Jennifer M.,"Keller, TX",5 star rating,These are some of the best dumplings I've ever had!  And there were 12 - 15 dumplings per order and at 10 per order the price can't be beat.  The location was super cool also!
/user_details?userid=LyWJPnEwZi334-MMUKXbCg,Philippe J.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"WOW, good dumpling in a quiet small place! I will definitely go back there! Good services also! The only issue we occur, it's to found parking spot, but the place it's a 5 stars !!!"

/user_details?userid=XfFowd4YzyWuRfrbtFCTkg,Ming P.,"Markham, Canada",3 star rating,"Came here on a weekend with my wife based on all the great reviews. I must say we were a bit disappointed. We ordered the pork and chives dumplings and the chicken and coriander dumplings. Unfortunately, we could only taste soya sauce in both dumplings. The soya sauce was just too overwhelming and it totally masked the natural meat and good chives favours. The chicken and coriander ones were slightly better. In the pics shown in other reviews here, there was a lot more chives than meat in the dumplings. However, the ones we had had far more meat than chives. We went to another older Montreal favourite dumplings place the next day further down on St Laurent near the China town gate. Far much better and cheaper too! Won't be back for sure."
/user_details?userid=95h8tdQOG_bAET7FiHfEWQ,Rey C.,"Jersey City, NJ",3 star rating,"I'm on the fence about this place.  Full disclosures - Only tried once and only had a vegetarian option and a shrimp option.  Taste were fair (a little bland) to good (not the traditional and fast food store-bought thick dumplings). Their ingredients were not scarce - they pack em nicely, just like the pics.  I would try one more time but my concern was the level of blandness."
/user_details?userid=Fo7QxWwvWD609BSyFBUNng,Jill B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is the cutest little mom n' pop operation just off rowdy St. Laurent. Sitting down in the restaurant feels like being invited to someone's house for dinner and you're just sitting in the living room waiting for dinner to be served. I've tried nearly all their dumplings and there isn't a dud in the bunch - my personal favourite is the pork and dill. It's worth noting that they only serve dumplings and nothing else, so don't go in expecting a laundry list of other Chinese delicacies. If you're into spice, make sure to put their homemade chili oil on everything! While I find the price perhaps a bit steep, it's totally worth it for these authentic, unpretentious, and delicious dumplings. A secret neighbourhood gem!"
/user_details?userid=Ro00qQOG5fIrFCXMStjzrQ,Nicolas C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The dumplings are excellent and a very good price. The service is great and the decor is very welcoming, though it's a bit weird how much it feels like you're just sitting in a stranger's kitchen. If you're into that sort of thing, then you'll be very comfortable, but if not, well... I saw one person walk in and then walk right back out again while I was there, and I suspect that's why. Still, the food was very, VERY good. I just wish they'd had steamed buns while I was there; I only got to try out the dumplings. Maybe next time, and there will definitely be a next time."
/user_details?userid=XILA-PtHX99FNHuMIT6C2g,Sam H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I live close to this restaurant and go there as much as possible. A hidden gem. Their hot pepper paste is spectacular, put it on everything you eat."
/user_details?userid=MPihOGQek3itSD9c9oGX5A,Katarina A.,"Saint Paul, MN",4 star rating,"Tasty dumplings on the edge of the Plateau.I must confess, I come here every few weeks just because it's *really* close to my apartment, and I'm never disappointed. The dumplings are delicious and the little family which runs it is very sweet. The only (slight) downside is the price, which is notably higher than would be charged for similar portions elsewhere in the city. Nevertheless, that's a small thing. If you're anywhere near, give it a go."
/user_details?userid=-ifu8dZoEPsnzgPuhMNWMQ,Alexander G.,"Raleigh, NC",5 star rating,"Heavenly. If you like stumbling upon restaurants that are seemingly holes in the wall with the most memorable food, this is it. The restaurant may be small but it is filled with great people and amazing food. The dumplings are authentic and full of flavor, my favorite since being in China. There are many great options, start with seaweed salad then pick your fancy. Highly recommend for not only the food, which is the staple, but the friendly people and charm of the place. Enjoy."

Came here a couple months ago with my man, he flew from the states, I from across Canada for a trip to Montreal. we ended up stumbling across this place and were both immediately obsessed. We just booked a weekend trip to come back purely for these dumplings. i'm not kidding! See you guys soon!!!!!"
/user_details?userid=NxcAZKuSKHNCRs18VuhTxA,J G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Dumplings were generously packed and oozed a fresh flavour.  Ordered takeout and watched one of the women prepare it before my eyes. Atmosphere was pleasant and staff were very hospitable.
