Everything in the menu is good (at least everything I have tried). Gyozas, rolls, Vietnamese grill, poke bowls, noodles, you name it, everything is good. And they're experts at takeout so you cannot go wrong!"

/user_details?userid=KFsbACIHXQxyff_W6CN1LA,Karen H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Being on vacation is so wonderful because I get toplay the tourist in my own city of Montreal. What a fabulous city it is. Asian cuisine was the delight. We were greeted with a smile and brought to our seats  with the menu's. I was quite famished after a day of biking. I decided to order different appetizers, fried imperial rolls, chicken Gyazo with peanut sauce,  fried breaded chicken wings with spicy mayo. Everything was good. I was told that they were open for 4 months but I have to say the service was a delight as well as the food. I'm sure as time goes on the food will improve a step up. After filling our tummies we decided to go to Richmond Marché for coffee and dessert which was a walk around the corner. Check that review also...."

Left warm and full after a hot soup followed by a big helping of noodles, beef salad. The Jasmine tea was also a nice addition on such a cold day. Simple deco. Will be back!"

This restaurant is not only absolutely delicious, but very well priced, very well ran, extremely clean, and overall a wonderful dining experience. I am thankful to my boyfriend for bringing me there twice a week for the last 2 months or so lolThe imperial rolls are probably the best in Canada. The chicken curry is mind blowing. The ice tea is out of this world. Freaking ice tea I'm telling you. Please do yourselves a favour and try this place out. Come back and agree with me."
