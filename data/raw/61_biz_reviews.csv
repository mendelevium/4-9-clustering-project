/user_details?userid=Rvn-Ymc8_9z4vbcm2ZwenQ,Ryna D.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"I absolutely adore this all day eatery in Montreal! Earlier this year, my husband was on a business trip in Montreal and I came along. While he was working I leisurely explored the city. On one of the days I came here for a late lunch and it was delightful! Fantastic food, amazing wine selection, homey vibes and friendly staff. Looking at this picture makes me crave some steak tartare!"
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been wanting to try Larry's for a long time because of its rave reviews. I went with a friend on a holiday Monday around 11 am and only waited 20 min to be seated. The staff will even serve you a coffee outside while you wait, which is nice! The resto is small and cozy and the staff were really friendly and efficient. I ordered a cappuccino and it was one of the best I've had a in a while at a restaurant. Originally I thought that the brunch menu included only the options under ""breakfast"" but it actually includes the entire menu. I ordered an egg, toast and the eggplant with pine nuts. The eggplant was delicious and the bread they used for the toast was fantastic! I was skeptical about the small plate format for breakfast but in the end I loved it, I got to select all the specific items I wanted instead of a predetermined plate. I really loved my brunch experience at Larry's and will certainly be back. They are open 7 days a week and on holidays."

I ordered two scrambled eggs, toast, and a mixed green salad. My husband ordered the breakfast sandwich and yogurt parfait. My eggs were really flavorful. Oddly, they reminded me a bit of steamed mussel broth, if that makes any sense. I loved the taste with the sourdough. I didn't try my husband's sandwich, but he said the sausage was great. My flat white was "" on point. "" I definitely recommend."

The location is perfect for me as I live in the neighbourhood, it is right around the corner from it's sister restaurant, Lawrence, and the butcher shop. I came with a friend and the server recommended we share 4 plates. Everyday they have different ceviche le tartare, both fish and meat! We had the white tuna ceviche, nduja (spelling?) sausage with mackerel, watermelon and feta salad, and beef with green sauce (not pictured). The sausage and mackerel was very interesting, a unique dish, which I haven't experienced similar anywhere else. So many textures and complementary tastes. The ceviche was very fresh and perfect for a hot day. The beef with the green sauce (can't remember name) was very good. The waiter sold it to us by saying it tasted like pho, he was right on the money! Who doesn't love pho? Overall a really wonderful experience made ever better by the extremely personal service. I definitely want to go back and try some of the other dishes, such as the sourdough pancakes with peach sauce or the mozzarella salad!"

It couldn't be more trendier, but I liked it a lot. Sometimes, I want pretty food served by cool kids in a very hip setting. All we ordered were two drip coffees, bubbles and squeak (potato mash with cabbage) with a sausage. We like to stop at new locations when we visit a city and taste a little of this and that instead of full meals.For sure it's on trend, but popular cool aside, it was nice. I liked drinking my coffee not rushed, as we enjoyed people watching and nibbling on the bubbles that ended up tasting better with some hot sauce. But that's us. You make like bland.No reservations, opens till 1am, so I expect those dinner crowds to be slammed. If you're visiting, go before the rush."

The place is small but it was not too crowded, I guess during weekends its hard to find a room here and it might be too load. For us, today, it was perfect.Not a big selection (see my photo), but they do make their own english muffins and the scrabeled eggs (with chives) were delicious."

Their fried potatoes make all other friend potatoes seem lackluster. Larry's wine list make other restaurant wine lists seem boring. Basically, Larry's is the best restaurant I've eaten at. Delicious, unique dishes at a reasonable price & lovely wines to boot. If you're in Montreal, go to the Mile End neighborhood & grab a meal (or two) at Larry's."
/user_details?userid=ReEiyAj27cVMZvQhTWHHQw,Ben S.,"Cambridge, MA",5 star rating,"Larry's was HANDS DOWN the best meal I had in Montreal and can not recommend the service and staff here highly. We got there pretty late around 10:30 PM and had the pleasure of being seated at the counter facing the open kitchen and had nothing short of an amazing experience talking to the chef and other staff as they picked up orders. We asked for recommendations and were suggested the exact opposite of what we had planned to order and boy was I glad for it.We ended up getting the flammkuchen, squash gratin, and chicken and cabbage. All three dishes were phenomenal and are a must order. I had no idea what flammkuchen was beforehand but it turned out to be a rich sweet and savory mini pizza with apples and meat and a spread I couldn't even explain. The squash gratin blew my mind and was surprisingly sweet but also creamy and hearty, with just the right amount of crisp and crumble on top. And the chicken and cabbage hit the right notes of acidity and citrus zest that I would've never expected in a dish that sounded like 3 basic ingredients. The chef let us sample a few things he was preparing along the way (don't skip the sourdough!) and made great conversation, we didn't ever want to leave. Despite seeming like undesirable arrangements, they were the best seats in the house at the counter. I'd love to come back and try their breakfast or brunch and am so glad I stumbled into this tiny hidden gem, a must-do for any Montreal visitor."

I'm giving it 4 stars for two reasons: 1) The service was super friendly and lovely, but slow. 2) Although I realize that the prices are on par with other quality restaurants, it really is a bit expensive for what you get. (So for my budget this is a ""once in a while"" place, not somewhere I'd frequent.) All in all, though, it was an excellent experience, and the food is top-notch!"
/user_details?userid=0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,Cindy Feng Xin L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I liked my light lunch at Larry's, but I find it a bit pricey for the quality and quantity of the food. I have had better dishes in the past for a lesser price, but it's just that Larry's is very hyped by Instagrammers (a bit like Fabergé which is located on the same street) that they price their dishes quite expensively. Of course, their food is an eye-candy and a lot of people would simply pay a visit to Larry's because the dishes look good.  I think that this place is a bit over-hyped, despite the fact that I like their lamb balls, but the ceviche is average. I paid around 35$ tips included, which I find too expensive for a lunch, but okay for the overall experience. Would somewhat recommend this place!"
/user_details?userid=dppuOvhpsBrWF1JVUs9E8g,Robert J.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I had a friend visiting from the states, we wanted to take her to some of our favorite wine bars. My partner had been to Larrys and said the food was fantastic, but warned us the service was bad. We decided to try it. All I can say is that it was the best food I've have had in Montreal! (love the liver toast and beef tartare) Between cocktails, wine, and food we spent neary $500 for the three of us, I do not regret it.  The service, well lets say I have a low tolerance for cocky service. The Som seemed to think he was too cool for school, he was doing us a favor in doing his job, cold,  and pretentious. The server had a similar attitude, snippy, she did not seem to like it when I asked her to take away an empty glass. Will I come back? Yes!Will it be soon? No."

We arrived to a pretty pack restaurant and had to wait about 30 minutes but it was well worth it. We actually sat at a bar looking right into the kitchen. It was quite the experience. Was very cool to watch these chefs prepare incredible food right in front of our eyes. Ordered the beef tartar, a beet and mozzarella plate, fried cauliflower, bread and butter, and a fabulous chocolate and blueberry tart- WOW! Everything was incredible! Very fresh and plated nicely. Recommend at least two plates per person as they're rather small. This is a definite must if you're in Montréal."

Service was prompt and friendly.We ordered the hash browns, kedgeree, and the sausage+egg bun.The hash brown was a little over done. The other two dishes were divine tho.We also ordered a ceaser and a mimosa. Mimosa was very tasty, the ceaser however was not; great presentation, but overall a very bland ceaser.I would still definitely go back here next time I'm in Montreal, the prices aren't outrageous like similar places in Toronto, and the menu often changes.Definitely a good place to go for brunch."

/user_details?userid=DD4KCmjAdJiJfv6yJcb4Uw,Virginia L.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Oh Larry! I've spent multiple evenings chatting away in good company while sipping wine here. This place is an anglo-montrealer run business and you can tell by your waiters English accent when they speak French. The space is small and dimly lit in the evening. It provides a comfy hide away ambiance. Their menu is a little pricey, but the tapas size meals are delicious. Plus, you can watch the cook prepare your meal (open kitchen). I also love their wine list. Last time I went I had a Grand Cru Riesling, which was dry enough for my palate.  Date night approved. This whole in the wall restaurant is perfect for deep conversations on cool autumn nights."
/user_details?userid=r_XO_oUvgrBzZdZGB_R23g,Jacob W.,"Queens, NY",5 star rating,"Larry's is a flawless all-day cafe, really shining at breakfast and brunch in particular. The menu is tight and confident, and all dishes feel well considered.The toasts are excellent, my favorite being the liver toast (which I would gladly eat for breakfast every day but I guess you have to be an organ meats person). My dining companion had the 'nduja and anchovies, which I also enjoyed quite a bit. The lentil salad was one of my favorite lentil preparations I've ever had-- it had a perfect acidity and the lentils kept a nice chew without being too hard. Under the breakfast menu you will find a small side dish of mushrooms-- these are basically what they sound like, very small button mushrooms swimming in butter. You should order them no matter what meal it is. They are perfect little umami bombs. They will go with everything.The coffee game is very strong, and while they have the usual complement of espresso based beverages, don't ignore the regular drip coffee, which is well above average.The cocktails are creative and interesting, with a number of spritz and aperitif oriented mixtures to suit the brunch menu. I tend to focus on the wine program when I go, as it usually has a number of interesting natural wines and the waitstaff have proven knowledgeable and well suited to making recommendations.Go at least once during your trip to Montreal, or stay nearby and see them for breakfast every day!"

/user_details?userid=bUPeHBFEINhqiKj9-k4-zA,Charles N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Cozy, comfy, and remarkably consistent! Larry's is open all day, every day, and whether you're stopping for a coffee, a quick bite, or to dine and drink, you're surely guaranteed to enjoy a wonderful experience! Dishes are on point, staff is friendly, and the ambiance is absolutely charming.Here's a tip: early Saturday and Sunday mornings are a good time to lounge, enjoy a perfectly executed breakfast, sip from a warm cup of coffee and and take the time to breathe right. A secret retreat for some ""me time"" or perfect spot to meet up with friends! Note to young parents, bring your babies & kids - they'll enjoy the company.Depending on when you come, you'll meet Kim at the barista station, efficient Camille or kind and attentionate Lisa to help you order.Here you'll be served coffee made from the Heart Roasters based out of Portland OR. Even though the CAD-USD currency exchange rate is currently pretty horrible, the owners nonetheless make the effort to bring us the good quality beans while maintaining at very reasonably priced cup of coffee.Tucked in the back are 'Fearless & Feminine' chef Mary and 'Born to Cook' chef Korlin who deliver an unstoppable amount of appealing and amazing tasty dishes from the tiniest and most optimized kitchen ever - pay attention to details such as the small racks of eggs and spice containers magnetically attached to the vent.If you get there early enough you can witness the transformation of little white pale balls of dough into golden and delicious English muffins that make the base of the succulent breakfast sandwiches. Bubbles are mashed potatoes combined with grilled leaks. Mushrooms are sautéed with chives and butter. Eggs are prepared your way, with thick bacon or crispy sausage and toasted buttered square bread. Scrambled eggs are simply divine - creamy, buttery, rich and slightly runny! For lunch or later, try the spaghetti, cucumber salad, tomato salad, pork chop, or creamed cabbage all sure hits but I must confess and have yet to try the rest of the menu and indulge in some wine and cocktails. Who knows, you might catch me there one of these evenings!"
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"We decided to check out Larry's for a quick drink before our dinner at Hôtel-Herman. I've never been to Lawrence or Sparrow (their sister restaurants) but Larry's had a very cool, chic look to it.The plan was to grab a drink but we were told by the staff that they don't have a full bar license here. Meaning if you want to drink, you have to order two dishes each or if you're a couple, three. Never heard of that requirement before - I can understand having to order one dish but having to order more than that? No thanks. We skipped on both those options and ended up sharing a beef tartare.A peek into their open kitchen. Two chefs were hard at work when we arrived.We sat at the bar. I've never been to a place in Montreal where it was so Anglophone. Interesting/different vibe here...They had a tray of pickled goods. Those pickles look scrumptious.Menu is a simple one pager with no descriptions. Very hipster. They do have some interesting things on the menu.  Would have loved to try the escabeche, brook trout and ox tongue.- Pink limoncello - can't remember exactly what this was but pretty sure it was non-alcoholic. Light, refreshing summery drink.- Beef tartare ($14.00 large) - the tartare was really nice with a raw egg yolk on top. Wish they weren't so stingy with the bread portions. Why do all restaurants seem to do that???  Besides that, the beef was nicely seasoned and fresh. A bit overpriced for the portion size but that seems to be the trend here.I wasn't thrilled with their drinking policy. Maybe put up a sign to inform customers about that? Can't be that difficult right?"
/user_details?userid=MoNnSNAZEAPQ1cuReIFXrA,Ane K.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I always come to this place, I think the food is fantastic and and I have never had a problem. However, today I went there and as usual I ordered the ceviche and a few other things. When I tried the first spoon of ceviche I noticed it wasn't the way it used to be, it seemed the fish had been marinated on the sauce for to long, or that there was too much sauce, the only thing I know is that I could taste only vinegar, no fish.The server came up to me and asked if everything was okay. I said yes, but the fish didn't have the same taste as usual. I asked if I could send it back (I hate to do that), she said no problem (with a smile).When the bill came she not only took out the Ceviche, but also the coffee I have ordered as a way of apologizing.The Ceviche I kind of expected, but taking out the coffee was a total surprise. Even though I love this place I always postponed to make a review. Today I could not let it pass because the customer service really brought this place to a whole new level to me.  Great customer service means to go beyond customer expectations creating an memorable experience. The server at Larry's saw in a bad experience, an opportunity to put in practice her great skills and she excelled at that. It's such a small thing that makes a world of difference."

Whatever they dressed it with or the spread they put it on killed all the other flavors. The liver pate was fine but nothing special. Same thing went for the meatballs and tomato soup.  The tiny slivers of their cured salami for 9 euros was a joke. I've had much better and more exciting salami (and I've had a lot of salami and cured meats--I'm Russian) and for a better price. They're basically saying their salami is $50 a pound. Overall, pricey for mediocre tiny plates of food. Meh."

In a quiet corner off Saint-Laurent, Larrys is a cozy cafe great for a date or dinner with friends. I went with my boyfriend and another couple and we shared the bread which was fresh and soft, carrots with muhammara, heirloom tomatoes, corn bread with succotash, cauliflower, beef tartare, tuna ceviche, eggplant with zaatar, chicken liver toast, tangerine creme and peanut butter chocolate tart. All items were tasty and different. We loved the variety in cuisines, textures, and spices. My favorites were the carrots and eggplant, but would definitely order all again. We also tried an orange wine which we learned about in Montreal. It's similar to a rose in that the wine rests for a short time on the skins of the grape, but it has a deeper taste that has a red wine mouth feel. Would recommend trying one if you haven't. Enjoy larrys for us!!"

/user_details?userid=XHn6kkOpuZxD-ExifZio0Q,Izzie J.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"As soon as my sister and I walked in the bartender gave us an unwelcoming look. We sat at the bar and got a very strange vibe from behind the counter as the waiter put down menus and glasses, when we ordered our cocktails he said ""ladies this is a restaurant not a bar"", assuming that we were bar hopping when we were actually there with the intention of ordering drinks AND food. So with that annoying remark we politely decided to leave and eat somewhere else, causing the bartender to role his eyes and shake his head.Im sure the food is good, but its the type of place where they take one look at you through the door and decide whether or not they want you sitting in their perfectly curated hipster orgy."

/user_details?userid=B9W6b8ahcVxZFOwpf7oq7Q,Sam H.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"So I burned about a year's worth of restaurant karma when I swanned into Larry's on a Friday night and miraculously scored the 1 free seat in this tiny tapas resto-bar while several couples huddled in the vestibule waiting. Oops! If you're the couple who was watching me eat and is reading this, I'm truly sorry. I had the beef tartare, the lamb meatballs, and the eggplant dip with za'atar yogurt sauce, oil, and pine nuts. Also got a side of bread in case items 1 or 3 needed sopping. The beef tartare comes in two sizes and I got the large, which certainly satisfied my deep craving for raw meat that emerges whenever I enter Francophone territories, but was nearly too much for one person when paired with 2 other sides. It could also have had a wee bit more onion/caper flavor and crunch. However, the quality of the meat was clearly fresh and excellent-I believe part of the restaurant family's operation is a as a meat distributor/provider or butcher.The lamb meatballs I ordered because someone next to me had them and they seemed pretty and nicely gamy and fragrant, but I didn't find them outstanding. A little more of the yogurt sauce, some heat, and maybe even some sweetness for contrast would have helped. The eggplant dip thing, however, blew my g-d mind. The waitress advised I use extra bread for it (and the bread and butter were themselves top-quality), but I was happy shoveling it into my mouth with a fork. Yum. It was tangy and fatty.The best thing, though, was the vermouth spritzer I had two of, garnished with olive and orange. Perfectly balanced and surprisingly nice with the wintry fare. The staff were warm and friendly (as in, actually smiling) and the clientele seemed like lots of really good friends and couples in deep, unrushed conversation. Not too drippingly hipster. I'd definitely head out for Larry's again."

/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I came here with my boyfriend on a Tuesday night and I was surprised how packed it was.  This place was happening! It's a cute restaurant! Luckily we managed to get a table despite the fact that we did not make any reservations.The waitress recommended three-four plates each to share. It was too much! Three to four plates for the both of us would have been perfect. I started with an orange wine and then tried a red. The wines were good. The wine by the glass menu was on a chalkboard and it was hard to read from where we were sitting.   We started with the new garlic and ricotta plate. Its basically a garlic bulb baked in the oven and you remove the cloves and spread it on sliced bread with ricotta. It was ok. I've never had this before and it was not really my thing. It is definitely not as good as garlic bread.  We also shared the lonzo which was my favorite dish. Its sliced bread with a thick layer of prosciutto on top. We had the tuna ceviche and the fish tartare (salmon and bass). The ceviche plate was bigger than I expected. There was a few peices on top of each other and the pieces were pretty thick. I preferred the fish tartare but that being said I've had better salmon tartare elsewhere. The pork chop came next at the same time as the fried potatoes. We were pretty full at this point. The chop was big, fatty and juicy. The potatoes were disappointing. Some of them were a bit burnt. :(This wine bar was good but it did not live up to my expectations. I will probably not come back. If you want to check this place out I recommend to come with not more than a handful of friends or just bring a date, have a glass of wine or two and share a couple of plates."

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"What is the ideal neighbourhood restaurant? Well... one imagines a small cozy place where you feel equally as comfortable just grabbing a drink and a snack or a full meal. A place that caters to all hours... not just a breakfast place or a dinner place. You want it to be accessible to everyone - somewhere you could see parents bring their kids on the weekend just as much as the young profession couple. And the food needs to great of course. Do such places exist? Well.... Mile End might have a good one based on my visits to Larrys.Located in the old Cafe Sardine space on Fairmount, just east of the Main, Larrys is the little brother of the wonderful Lawrence restaurant just next door. I suppose you could call it a coffee shop by day and a wine bar by night but that strikes me somewhat as reductive and not truly indicative of what Larry's offers. Larrys offers food options for breakfast, lunch and dinner from 8am to 1pm every day as well as a great selection of beer, cocktails and wine. The space is small but very warm and welcoming. I love the use of the accent wall in the back and the huge shelving unit behind the bar. Definitely has the feel of place you could stay in all day. On our first visit, we went early so we went for the breakfast options. My girlfriend went with a combination of the breakfast muffin with a plate of smoked salmon. The breakfast muffin was a combination of apple, nuts, cinnamon, oatmeal and flour. A very hardy and satisfying muffin. The smoked salmon was equally enjoyable. Much thicker than your typical smoked salmon but still with that lovely texture and taste.I myself went with the breakfast sandwich and a side-order of bubble and squeak. I have loved it when I ate at Lawrence for brunch and it continues to be excellent. A pork sausage patty with melted cheese, a over-easy egg, lettuce and dijon mustard on a english muffin. The bite of the dijon is a nice touch to the classic egg sausage sandwich. The bubble and squeak - a mixture of mashed potatoes and cabbage that has quickly become a personal favorite of mine - was nicely cooked and provided some hearty accompaniment to the sandwich.The second time around, we were there for more of a brunch/lunch situation so ordered outside of the breakfast options. Hence, I ordered a corpse reviver - gin, lillet, amara, lemon and absinthe. It may have been 11 am at the time of order but no judging okay? Great balance and flavour - nice way to start the meal.We still ordered the breakfast sandwich of course.... and it was still delicious. We also went with a plate of rillettes. Their butcher shop down the street has had great rillettes for years now so this was going to be a hit for sure. Great flavour and texture. Some people may find them too fatty but not me. Always excellent.We then shared a trio of ""lunch"" dishes. First, roasted carrots with honey and muhamarah. The carrots were roasted perfectly and I loved the combination of the honey with the spicy but slightly sweet muhamarah. The fried potatoes were nicely golden and crispy. A touch of garlic and parsley came through and then you add a creamy mayo for dipping. An excellent side dish. The final dish was bulgur and pickled eggplant - a solid dish but probably the one that we enjoyed the least. Came across a little too vinegary from the pickled eggplant.I love everything about Larrys. It helps that I love everything else that the group behind Lawrence does but still... there is something so wonderful about a place that can cater at all hours with a cuisine that is high quality and yet feels very homey and comfortable. If I lived in Mile End, I would definitely see Larrys as my neighbourhood hangout - the place to go for a drink, or a quick bit, or simply to get some work or enjoy a conversation with friends. Larrys nails the neighbourhood restaurant template perfectly.Cheers!"

They are all smaller dishes and it's a great place to order a whole bunch of items on the menu and share them. It does add up (price) but it's worth it. Their scrambled eggs are amazing; they are super runny and way different what you would expect. Their king oyster mushrooms are soooo good. I don't know what they serve underneath the mushrooms but its heavenly. Their toast is also really good, but they do put a lot of butter on it. The place is super small, so it's not ideal for groups. The wait wasn't too bad but it's best if you go early."
/user_details?userid=P5uRLwVRpv8OGv1eEvpvhQ,Natalie H.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,On a try as much as possible food adventure in Montreal this made the grade 3 times in 4 days. It's that good. From the cognac that shares my mother's maiden name (which had the server greet me as Madame Pinard from then on) to the great coffee everything is well done. Had breakfast to lunch here and the scrambled eggs are amazing traditional rillettes to an outstanding tuna ceviche and whelks.  There's something for anyone here (not a lot that's vegan tho) but it's encouraged to share and always seemed busy.I'm already sad to have left.

The scrambled eggs are unlike any I've ever had...so deliciously smooth and creamy. I paired that with a perfect breakfast sausage and addictive grilled mushrooms. Magnifique!I also shared pikelets with my dining companion to start the meal...they're kinda like biscuit/crumpet/pancakey type things, served with maple syrup. Needless to say, all of the above was too much food for one breakfast and by the end I was busting at the seams. But in the best possible way. And the service was exceptionally friendly. Well done Larry!"

But sadly, Larry's did not give me that tingly feeling. The good:The space is very nice. It's small, but optimally designed to feel cozy. It also attracts a fun and trendy crowd, so the vibe is nice. The drink menu is pretty good, I enjoyed a delicious cocktail and the others seemed to like the beer choices. The bad:The food I tried was nothing worth mentioning. In fact, the chocolate cake even seemed like it might be a Costco cake, for which they charged $8 a piece. Not impressed with this. The ugly:We showed up for drinks at 10pm. They sat us down and only brought the drink menu. So we ordered and that was that. Then, 20 minutes later they showed up with the food menu. And just left it on the table. When we said we weren't planning on eating, they suddenly told us we'd all need to order at least one plate each as they do not have a bar license. Without any previous warning, and now with drinks in hand, we really did not have any choice. It would definitely have been nice for them to mention this from the outset - this would have been the right thing for the staff to do. So without any real choice in the matter, we ordered and my husband asked for the cheese (which on the menu says $5 per piece). No one asked him how many pieces or what kind of cheese. They just showed up with 3 kinds and charged him $15. Again, it would have been appreciated for the staff to ask how many pieces and what kinds, no? We left feeling like we had a great night with friends, despite the deceiving restaurant and service."

/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"As a fan of Lawrence I'll be honest and say I wasn't smitten.The space, despite previously boasting massive renovations from the now defunct Sardine, kinda just looks the same to me despite some small fix-ups.We visited Larry's later in evening, planning to capitalize on the much-needed ""snack bar"" newly off the main; we ordered the lentils, the anchois and roots, the terrine and the pastrami. As other reviewers have commented it's rather pricey; this can be attributed to that you need to order a minimum of two plates to be drinking. This, however, didn't bother me too much- I think I was more fiercely at odds with the selection of ""snack bar"" food. After a couple of drinks I don't particularly fancy the carefully constructed Larry fare- I'd be much more inclined to head to a deli or a dive for a sandwich and fries. But that's just me.Honestly, I'd suggest just visiting Lawrence during the day. The food is comparable if not sometimes almost identical but larger portions."

Anyway, just like its sister (or I should say brother) restaurant, the food here--and I mean each and every individual dish from start to finish--was GOOD. Plates were perfect sizes for sharing and we were happy with our meal. It wasn't cheap (over $100 for two people for a few plates and a couple of beers) but you should know that coming into your meal.

For a tapas place in Montreal, Larry's has my heart as my favourite one. Whenever I go, I make sure to order the fllamkuken & beed tartare.

Music - a delightful fiddle.Staff - Sweet as pie.Food - Tasty, humble and fresh (Its part of the Lawrence family so that's a given). Also tapas style.Price - Unjustified, bougey prices for very humble and VERY small dishes. It makes you wonder if they think the customer will pay anything. It is almost offensive.A tiny bowl of pasta should NEVER be $10. My nonna is doing back-flips in her grave. I don't care if the water usedto boil it was blessed by the Pope himself. Take the 55 down to Little Italy and get a real bowl worth your hard earned $$. 2 cabbage rolls the size of a thumb are $9. Major thumbs down to that.Being tapas style, if the expectation is for people to order a bunch of small things to share, the menu pricing is treating the customer like fools. It hurts to experience this and say this because I am a BIG fan of all the places within the Lawrence ""family"".But that said, the prices are unjustified. We're not stupid. We are hungry.

/user_details?userid=3gGo8mT2yozLprrIv9stEg,Talia F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Have been here three times. Twice for date nights. Love the cosy intimate vibe. Once on a Saturday night (busy, lively) and once on a Monday night (super chill). The other time for just a glass of wine and dessert on a Thursday night (busy but seated right away). Love the casual but sophisticated atmosphere. Love the concept of small sharing plates as you get to work your way through the menu. The portions are good for 2-3 people max so not great for big groups if everyone wants to try. I'd say it's on the pricier side for the size of portion you get although ingredients are always fresh and each dish is carefully thought out and delicious. For one of the meals between two hungry people: seabass ceviche, tuna tartare, crab toast (this one is piled high), the aubergine cassoulet, potatoes, lamb cabbage rolls. Everything was delicious, really enjoyed. Would be interested in returning more frequently if their menu changed more often so could try more things. Staff was informative about the food and able to describe the items on the menu in detail and clearly know about the food. This always helps. It shows they care about the food they're serving and this goes a long way!*UPDATE* had a couple more meals i couldn't fault! Bingo! All the above still applies yet an added star as I think they have become more generous with their portions. 3 people: 3 glasses of wine, 2 cocktails, maybe 5-6 sharing dishes - we were full and happy! Around $50 per person. I'd say for a quality meal with exceptional service it's an easy 5star! It's local, independent - i struggle to fault it."

With smiles we entered only to find out they close at 5:00 on Sundays. No big deal we could come back another time, but apparently it was a big deal for the staff. We walked in because the door was open, no sign was showing closed and there was at least three tables still eating. We wait at the door with smiles, excited and the staff (3 behind the bar, 2 in the open kitchen) don't look at us. Finally the 3 behind the bar look at us and talk to each other and one walks over, no smile. We are told they are closed. Ok, no big deal. But they were so unpleasant, especially compared to the old business that was in the same location before them. Like we did something so wrong to walk in, then to cap off the experience when we asked what are the daily hours, since we thought it was open later he said, ""We close early on Sunday because we deserve time off too"" Wow! Don't like your hours don't take it out on us. This is the same arrogant attitude from their other property Lawrence. No need to go back. (The team at Lawrence Boucherie are very nice)"

The flavors were amazing. Then I tried their mashed potatoes mixed with cabbage and fried in lard... simply tasty but not greasy. The fact that they serve small plates - tapas style - you get a treat without over indulging, unless you order another plate! For a place that was so crowded, the service was great. I eat out a lot because I travel. This place should definitely be listed as a go to spot on TripAdvisor because it's a gem that everyone should get a chance to enjoy."

She said you have to order at least 3 things. What? I'm not ordering three things when I literally just ate. We then said should we just leave then? She went and talked to the manager and said we could stay. Yeah after that felt real welcome. She said they aren't a wine bar well guess what on yelp you are and in the US that means you can simply enjoy a glass of wine. Very rude and unwelcoming.

The wife went for scrambled eggs and lox while I opted for buttered toast, eggs and mushrooms. My eggs were served sunny side up, cooked the way I like um (runny yoke with a set white) and perfectly seasoned. The mushrooms were cooked whole with herbs and butter--- super savory! The toast was equally tasty. The lox were tender and well balanced with a herby gently scrambled egg... I had a very nice cup of perfectly roasted black drip coffee to wrap the meal. The place is intimate and the staff was kind. There were a couple of families with well mannered small kids enjoying delicious  looking pastry and sipping hot chocolate.

The smoked sturgeon drizzled with olive oil was supremely rich in flavor and texture without the dryness due to oversmoking/cooking.  The scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked and seasoned being slightly wet and luscious. The sausage was so succulent and soft I almost thought it was undercooked but it wasnt. I've never encountered bubble and squeak before but it turned out to be a skillet crisped mixture of potatoes and cabbage that was the embodiment of heaven.  With the day being so cold the soup gave my body the rejuvenating warmth it desperately needed and made my knees quiver with the sublime richness on the palate most vegetable soups are loathe to fulfill. Needless to say o will be going back there tomorrow and vainly wish this restaurant was in my hometown of new York city. So far this is the only restaurant in montreal that I wish this of.

Larrys is smaller, with smaller plates, all-day breakfast and great coffee. I ate here with a few friends one early afternoon and was very pleased I could order off the night menu AND the breakfast menu. We got a bunch of things to share, which was ideal as breakfast is served family-style. Our server(who I recognized from Lawrence brunch) knew the menu pretty well but failed to mention this point, so some of my friends were put off by the fact that they didn't get their individual breakfasts all together on their own plate. Aside from this minor point everything was great. We shared the cabbage rolls, mussels with spicy tomato sauce, salami, fried eggs, toast and a vinegary cucumber salad. It came out to about 100$ for 3 of us including coffees and tip. They charged us for bread but it was really good so I didn't mind so much. I can see why some people think it's expensive but I can't really think of anything else like it in Montreal. Can't wait to try it for dinner!"
