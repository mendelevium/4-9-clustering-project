It's a mom and pop place and those places are known to be THE BEST. Secondly, the portion is beyond generous - I personally took the Griot plate and I took the large one cause - you know... I was hungry. Sufficed to say - my meal was so flavourful and the meat was tender !! Highly recommend this place if you love Haitian food or you're new to it. It is DELICIOUS."

Hands down.This place has a homey atmosphere, where you can eat in or take out. Me and a friend came here for lunch, where we ordered the griot (fried pork) plate, which comes with rice and beans, salad, macaroni, plantain and spicy sauce! It's a great plate to try for first timers for Haitian food. The pork was very flavourful and juicy paired very well with the spicy vinegar sauce and the bean rice. The macaroni and cheese was simple and balanced well with the rest of the dish. Overall, the cozy atmosphere, the friendly workers, the flavourful food and fair prices makes this place worth a try."

The griot and the cabri is what I recommend! Super tender and flavourful. Chicken is good too. I use to go to meli melo but they lost the touch with their riz collé. I mean I'm not Haitian but the rice needs to be on point. This place knows what they're doing! It's a family business, so you know that the elderly family is cooking in the back. On weekends you can get the delicious Djon djon rice. Worth it. And of course portions are more than generous. This place is a gem!"

Found this restaurant on Yelp and the good reviews were all right! Got the tassot (goat) with rice and comes with several other sides including acra which was amazing. Kid you not the food was not only well presented but sooo delicious. My husband is Haitian and it got his 100% seal of approval as well. The hostess was super pleasant and we appreciated her attentiveness and courteousness. If you're thinking of going to a Haitian restaurant and wondering which to go to, definitely go here! You will not be disappointed!"

/user_details?userid=M1De2lTi1x9uzW1ah7FLEQ,Saida S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Best haitian food i've had in my life. Since its far from my house i called forst to know the schedule & the lady on the phone was more than nice. I had the small griot (which wasnt small at all). The griot was so tender & the onions that came with it were so spicy yummm.
/user_details?userid=fExj_WQCSQnqtJJitlp1ag,Lauren S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This was the first time I tried Haitian food, and it won't be the last ! I had the griot, which came with salad, rice, pasta salad and fried plantains. The portion was MASSIVE despite it being the small version, I was way full by the end. The griot and fried plantains were absolutely perfect. The reason for the 4 stars is cause the rice and pasta were pretty bland. But will return for the griot and plantaines no hesitation!"
/user_details?userid=--8NUFYnpU_Zu09TgcLevw,Sachielle S.,"Uptown, Albuquerque, NM",5 star rating,Best Haitian in Montreal bar none. If you visiting family that's the place to get a home cooked meal without the trouble of cooking it.
/user_details?userid=uN-R8j0JexLz2AEBYOByIA,Nico L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,A hidden gem! Generous portions for the price! Food was tasty and spiced to perfection. We both had griot (for the first time might I add) and loved it. The riz djon djon was to die for. The service was warm and friendly. There is no menu per se. The waiting recited the items that were available for the day. I'm already looking forward to coming back.
/user_details?userid=OC7pX0AVsJY2heO454Drjg,Jonathan P.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,"Delicious to say the least. The food is very affordable, in fact, the prices are definitely lower than any other Haitian restaurant in Montreal, but the quality is still top notch. The portions are very generous, you will most likely have enough for two meals rather than one. It's also easily accessible, being right next to the Iberville metro station on the blue line. All in all, one could not ask for more out of Haitian food."
