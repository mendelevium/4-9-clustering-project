And on the rare occasion I can find a spot that serves both of those together? Shooooooot I'm there homie! Thaison advertises as one of those Vietnamese/Chinese restaurants, which typically makes me skeptical, but since y'all Yelpers seem to love this place so much (and cause we were in the neighborhood), we decided to give it a try. And we are glad we did! The roasted duck noodle soup was Excellent. Tasty broth (very important), juicy pieces of roast duck, and noodles of your choice (we got the egg noodles). We also got the roasted pork and lemongrass sausage over steamed rice, which was solid. The lemongrass sausage on its own was a winner (I might just get that by itself next time). We got the ""regular"" size of each dish, which was a little under $10 each, so to walk out of there with our bellies full for roughly $20 between us was pretty good!"

We had the nem nuong with banh hoi-that was good enough- and a bowl of roast pork in hu tieu noodle soup. That was GREAT! My wife said it tasted just like in Vietnam, and she's never felt that way about anything here in Toronto. The pork had the nice crispy glassy type skin favoured in Vietnam over the puffy Chinese kind, it was really delicious, and the broth was very authentic. Definitely check this place out if you're visiting Jean Talon market."
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been eating their bbq meats since i was a little child in the 80's when they had a shop in Côte-des-Neiges. Since then, i've tried other Chinese bbq places like this but nothing ever compared to it. Maybe the vietnamese side of it made a difference... Like i have mentioned in other of my reviews around the area, I don't come around often due to traffic and parking issues. But when i do come to Thaison, i always enjoy and love their food. This time i ordered to go a whole roasted  duck, vietnamese sausage with lemongrass, mi vit tiem soup (spiced braised duck with egg noodle soup) and a won ton with roasted duck with egg noodle soup. At under 10$ a soup, 20$ for a whole duck and 4,50$ worth of sausage, my husband and i had enough food for 3-4 meals! All i needed to do is cook some fragrant jasmine rice and pop open a good bottle of beer (or a few) and we're set! Bon appétit!!! Btw, service is ok. I guess it all depends on how the day is unfolding to them ;)I love it more when it is or was the older gentleman at the butcher table and not the younger version. Still ok though ^_^"

The quality and price is tough to beat anywhere in the city. On our last visit we showed up 15 minutes before closing - (you know the clients everyone who works there hates) and they were so nice. They told us to take our time and that only the kitchen closed at that time. So we ordered and the food came our right away - and we got worried! But the food was perfect, fresh and tasty with huge.....I mean huge portions. What a great deal and option to eat. We never felt rushed or under served."
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",5 star rating,"Asian BBQ meat is beyond what I can describe as amazingly delicious. Many places tend to claim to serve it up. Thaison I would declare the best I've had in Montreal for Char Siu (Chinese BBQ pork). It's such a delicate mix of well cooked pork almost candied on the outside, yet not too dry and tender on the inside. They offer to cut it up for you or have it uncut. I asked for uncut as I thought it would be fresher bringing back home. I ended up cutting some for my daughter and right after she put it in her mouth she said ""daddy more please"". It's really hard for me to use descriptive terms to explain. A tad firm on the outside (as in well done) yet tender would be the best I can describe it. It's freaking amazing. I also purchased which was mentioned to me (by Yelper Khai) as Thai lemongrass sausage. It was a bit fatty but very good mix of pork and full lemongrass flavour. Another nice compliment. If BBQ Chinese/Asian meats are on your list you need to come here. The shop is very unassuming and service is direct and no nonsense but it's the real deal folks."

I lived around the corner from here for years and it took reviews from trusted Yelpers to help me finally discover this deliciousness! For when pho is not enough and you really want to get into some seriously good Vietnamese meats, get yourself to Thaison. The homemade lemongrass pork sausage was super tasty and the roast duck soup with egg noodles was crazy rich and filling with lovely savoury broth. I want to go back with a crew of people to order the hot pot and a bunch of other stuff on the menu that I need more professional eaters to introduce me to, but yah, what a happy discovery! I loved the sweet woman working and her sideways smile, loved the families giggling at the round tables in the back, loved the small cozy family vibe."
/user_details?userid=w5qUkMf4dneQ90HUe162Dw,David S.,"Rego Park, NY",3 star rating,"We have made this a regular stop when we visit the Jean Talon area.  This visit, it became  apparent that this is a restaurant that has forgotten why it exists.The food is inexpensive and filling, but lacking in culinary quality.This may have been sufficient in 1997, but today there are many asian restaurants in Montreal serving more relevant, delicious, inspired food.As I noted in another review, there are no vegetables to be found in this restaurant, so if you want to vary your meal beyond roast meats, stir fries and noodle soups, you will be out of luck.  The fried tofu with mushrooms is serviceable, but I don't consider this a vegetable dish.On top of that, they were out of roast pork.  It is one of the highlights of this restaurant and many people order it to go.The service is as uninspired as the food.  The careless waitstaff clearly do not want to be there- they are only there because they were there yesterday and don't know what else to do.This is a restaurant that has fallen into a death spiral and cannot find its way out.  Such a shame, because it could be much better"

/user_details?userid=dWoPSIIj55M6cq8YIcPiAA,Jen T.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Great little place to eat! Been there multiple times over the years. Their pho is amazing and so is their steamed rice with shrimp sauté. Vegetables are always crisp and fresh. Price is very decent for the large portions. The service is also nice, though there is a language barrier at times."
