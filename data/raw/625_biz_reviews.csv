/user_details?userid=iRQ_YKpCBdaCwvc2X8_3NQ,David N.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"It's pretty crazy, ultimately, that one of the best meals I had in Montreal was from a food stand in an outdoor market.We actually wound up coming to the Atwater Market twice, but the first time I was full from a previous meal. So when I noticed that Satay Brothers was open when we returned, I jumped at the chance to try some of their wares.I wound up trying three items: Satay Sandwich (""Satays, Slaw, Satay Sauce""), Papaya Salad (""Green papaya, peanuts and chilis""), and the sandwich of the day (which was a braised beef concoction).Everything was amazing. The Satay Sandwich was absolutely bursting with insane flavors, and the meat itself was super tender and super delicious. The Papaya Salad, which also boasted an impressive presentation, was equally tasty, while the sandwich of the day was, you guessed it, completely and utterly amazing.I wish I'd had a chance to go to Satay Brothers' actual restaurant, because if what we ate here was any indication, they're easily one of Montreal's very best eateries."

While walking in between in the stunning plants and flowers, the hunger strikes! Decided to visit Satay Brothers kiosk. The service was amiable. I ordered two tofu steamed buns and pork papaya salad for my sister and a coke can. Unfortunately, the taste was the food wasn't up to mark. Tofu steamed buns were missing the kick flavor, and the sauce was way too salty. The papaya salad was super watery, and you can imagine it was not easy to eat with chopsticks. But the both dishes' presentations were beautiful and colorful. At least, the food helped with my hunger."

/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is certainly a popular spot at the Atwater market. The food is good. My favourite? The ""Bao Buns"". So tasty! I also think they serve cocktails, but I'm not certain.Minor knockdown for: (1) slightly pricey for what it is (but still on the cheap side) and (2) long lines mean long waits (which is both good and bad news from the customer experience perspective).I definitely prefer some of the other food court options at Atwater though."
/user_details?userid=RXIeMdM988krQQDj6cXwJQ,Linda T.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,"Satay Brothers is one of the eateries that you can try while visiting Atwater Market. I only ordered the ""laksa"" and it's chili coconut soup with bean sprouts, tofu, shrimp, sliced fish cakes, and noodles. There's also an option to add chicken for a few dollars more. I wished there more noodles in the dish. I can't tell if the favors are authentic since this was my first time having laksa, but I did enjoy my meal tho.Overall, the food prices here seemed reasonable. Please note that it's a CASH ONLY place."
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"A few months ago we were at the Atwater Market. We found this place on Yelp and decided to come here based on the reviews. The first time we came here we had a great experience. The food was delicious and service was extremely friendly!! We loved the spot but were in a hurry so couldn't really relax and enjoy our meal. But we decided we would come again soon! A few weeks ago I was flying out for a vacation. My husband and I decided to visit this spot again since we had been meaning to come here since our last visit. We went here all the way from Mont Royal right before my flight. This was our first meal of the day, we were both hungry so we ordered a few things for the table. We sat here for an hour, finished our meal and left and within five minutes of leaving the place I compulsively started vomiting. Vomited for thirty minutes and then couldn't even stand without support. I immediately got a fever and started to sweat, so we took an Uber to the hospital only to find out I had gotten severe food poisoning. Since my husband had eaten the same food and was unaffected, the only explanation we could come up with was that either it was their house hot sauce. I love hot sauces and spicy food so had asked them for their hot sauce. Or their chicken satay skewer with peanut sauce since he had skipped that as well. Regardless of a good past experience here, I would not recommend a place to anyone that made me this sick because of their food."
/user_details?userid=5CbfKqyOSe63xH6CJL9sSA,Maxine R.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",4 star rating,"Pretty good singaporean restaurant considering how small the kitchen was and how fast the food came out.  i ordered the laksa lemak and chicken skewers. I was pretty disappointed with the laksa. the noodles were clearly far from fresh- as they were short and quite chewy, contrary to traditional soft and long laksa noodles, and also mostly consisted of bean sprouts. It lacked the undertones of spice and flavor laksa has and was quite plain. The chicken skewers were pretty good. They had flavor, but were far from extraordinary. Although the sauce that came with it really made the dish much better. it was also served with cucumbers which i though were a good touch. The service was quite good and we got our food quickly. The tables were clean and the staff looked put together. i probably wouldn't come here again but it is worth a try."
/user_details?userid=bQCHF5rn5lMI9c5kEwCaNA,Vincent L.,"Oakland, CA",4 star rating,"The fact that the workers here are almost all gringos might give you pause when it comes to authenticity, but the long lines at this Atwater Market stall are no lie. Whether skewers, sandwiches, buns, or even traditional dishes like laksa bowls, everything here is quite legit and quite authentically flavorful, but not excessively so. Despite the lines, service is reasonably fast, and they also have a few good beers to choose from. One of many good options here at Atwater."
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Gotta give it to them their food is crazy flavourful. I first tried satay brothers at the other location and wasn't a fan.I decided once in for all that the steam buns needed to be purchased so I got in a little roped line where there was 5 ppl ahead of me. I got 2 buns 2 sandwich and a papaya green salad. Sandwich of the day was a meat sandwich tasted almost like hamburger and a well seasoned kefta. The other sandwich was okay but lacking meat. I 100 percent will be back
/user_details?userid=3QnoTcrxuafMCoTzW_AH7A,Sari Marissa G.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"Absolutely delicious Malaysian food! That Laska was one of the best bowls of soup we have ever had! Not to be missed. It was PACKED full of flavor with just the right amount of kick. They can and will eliminate items for dietary reasons. That and a local IPA on tap was a perfect treat for hubs and I to share on a rainy, romantic autumn day. They also offer buns and satay (obviously) of all kinds, even tempeh for a veg friendly option and of course papaya salads. It all looked delicious. The guys were so friendly and we joked around with them. Cool dudes. We enjoyed sitting casually on the picnic tables right there after shopping the market.  I think we lucked out as we came just before closing on a Saturday. There was no line at all!Cash only."
/user_details?userid=cShZ8u9FmXJAp3qyHSgKPg,Widjaja P.,"North Brunswick Township, NJ",2 star rating,"So excited when I saw this place at Atwater Montreal Canada. My excitement evaporated once i taste the satay This place is definitely not an authentic satay place, the taste has been modified to fit the local people.Ordered the laksa, it has the same taste, bland and not rich as normal laksa should has.Also ordered the pork bun, came with two portion, the pork is too sweet, not my favorite.They open until 5pm, and offer tap local beer.If you just want to try or to fill in your stomach, maybe this is a place for you.If you are looking for good satay, this is not recommended."
/user_details?userid=OShhYu3wMdQ-miUdEK41Zw,Faisal R.,"Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"My second time here in two years. Marché atwater can be pretty jam packed. Ordered the Laksa again, this time chicken. It's delicious! My only issue is the lack of noodles! I mean for a noodle dish, its really disappointing! I think my bowl had more bean sprouts than noodles! Specially for 16$. I mean I understand the pricing due to Covid/inflation etc but common...it's just noodles! The rest was great. Keep in mind that if you go there for a noodle craving, you won't be satisfied."

It had a very natural passion fruit flavour and the tea itself is extremely smoothy.The chicken satay is really soft and tender. The satay sauce is not very flavorful, but have a very strong taste of peanuts.The only place that I didnt like is their tables. It is very dirty and sticky."
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"Can you believe I've never stepped foot into Atwater Market? Well, nestled away in one of the stalls is a super popular Indonesian/Malaysian/Singaporean spot, Satay Brothers. They've become so popular that they have an actual restaurant in St. Henri (about a 5 minute walk away) that's open for dinner when the market shuts down.Hours coincide with the market although they're closed Monday and Tuesday. First time I came, they were closed but that just meant I could take pictures in peace. Drink menu - interesting that you can order pitchers. Perfect for summer drinking. Even though they have a paper menu, the board menu reflects actual prices.The stall is very laid back and the guys working there are very cool. We sat at the two counter seats on the side and got to chat with some of the workers, which was pretty entertaining. Even when they were shutting things down to move to the restaurant, they didn't rush us. Heck, they gave us some chicken satay skewers on the house.- Calamansi lemonade ($3.50)- Green papaya salad ($8.00)- Laksa lemak ($11.50)- Chicken satay skewersI can't really think of any other places in town that specialize in south-east Asian cuisine so you'll have to make due with Satay Brothers to get your fix. Not a bad way to end my trip!"

We went to the market to get some fruits & vegetables and we decided to stop by satay brothers in the booths there and get some lunch.. it was a really hot summer day and we had out baby with us! We stood in line like everyone else and I was so excited to just place my order! (My favorite is their pork buns) anyways we waited for about 2 minutes until one of the staff member came over with  menu and let us order with him!! He was so nice! I was so impressed, he took our order and it was ready so quickly! I felt bad for the rest of line but I'm sure everyone can understand once baby is on board. I really wasn't expecting this kind of service but this will just keep me coming back even more than the usual! So if you're reading this , dear owners.. I cant thank you enough!!!"
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",3 star rating,"Was really looking forward to coming here after reading numerous reviews. Singaporean/Indonesian/Malay is a great meal when I can find a restaurant that serves it in it's fragrant, flavourful and spicy manner. Here at Satay Brothers the vibe is low key. It's basically a summer food court whereby you eat at communal picnic tables. I'm cool with that as it's summer and your eating under a tent and there's are scents of food in the air. Very laid back. For lunch I had ordered the laksa, 3 satay sticks and a papaya salad. I was really looking forward to a great meal but was seriously underwhelmed. The laksa although looked great was lacking in some flavour. The chicken satay although you could taste was marinated in coconut milk the peanut sauce was bland. The papaya salad was probably the best out of everything but again Paris Pho does a better version. As others have mentioned portions here are a tad on the smaller size. The 3 satay sticks are seriously a joke as they are some of the smallest satay skewers I've ever seen. For me overall the food was a 2.75 stars. They could use a bit of galangal, ginger, lemongrass and Thai birdseye chilies to give it more flavour. I respect however that this is their gameplan and I'm a mere observer. If you have the opportunity and want to check out what I consider top notch Malaysian/Indonesian food to check out is Restoran Malaysia in Richmond Hill. Or one of the many Banana Leaf restaurants in Vancouver. In Montreal however there is not a huge amount of Indo/Malay restaurants so they can get away with smaller portions and charging a bit more. My next place I need to check out is Gado Gado. Overall it's okay I was just expecting so so much more!"

/user_details?userid=93vyTaJgzQRQO4Zs9Cg_pw,Josy A.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Satay brothers, please move to London! I could do with eating this more often!!We arrived at Atwater market in the late afternoon, so it should have been long after the main lunch rush...but there was still a long queue of people waiting for their satay goodness! I'm glad we joined the line as this was a truly delicious snack!I thought I wasn't very hungry so I tried a chicken satay stick and a pork bun. They were both really good, although maybe a little small...once I tried them I felt like I could have eaten double that amount. Oops. My husband went for the satay sandwich, which was better value and turned out to be huge and gorgeous. My advice for future satay-munchers: Order slightly more than you think you can eat as the line is so long you won't want to go back and order all over again. Even if you're not hungry, their food is so good it will make you want to eat a little more."

The people behind the counter are always fun to talk to and service is always with a smile. There is usually a line up but worth the wait. Had the tofu buns with niki papaya salad witch was incredible. The chilies pack punch so if u can't take the heat move them aside.
/user_details?userid=DlNz5SxdBYRaZ_pnyIxn6g,Rhonda B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My visits to Satay Brothers, either in Atwater Market or on rue Notre Dame, are never disappointing. The food is consistently excellent across their always changing menu and the brothers go out of their way to make their customers feel special. My faves are the soft silky buns (melt in your mouth slow braised pork belly lightly dressed with hoisin and some sliced cucumbers), the papaya salad with or without tender pork; spicy beef salad (cabbage, heirloom tomatoes, fried garlic, mint, carrots). They will adjust the heat to your liking, 3x was quite the kick!"

All of this makes for a romantic/posh atmosphere or a cool place to hang out with your friends ; could be a perfect place for 5 a 7. They have fingers foods and appetizers for those days when you're only in for a drink with friends. We had vegetarian noodles, they were fine - but not wow. The steam bum with tofu was on the drier size, if you like saucy stuff maybe pass up on this one. I'll have to come back to try their other vegetarian options. Atmosphere was killing it and gave a charm to this place - this will bring me back!"

From their very popular stand during the Summer, at the Atwater Market. To their recently renovated location on St.Henri. Their food is packed with flavor, as well as simple yet beautifully presented.  With their kind and wonderful sense of humor and kindness, never a dull moment seeing the very hard working guys behind Satay Brothers. Their steamed buns, with tender flavorful pork belly, is outstanding. You like some kick? Definitely order their Laksa soup, it packs a great deal of heat, with loads of flavor. A must try!Their prices are very reasonable, it will make you want to order numerous things from their menu. A great spot, a must try!"

They seem to have a nice array of cocktails though!"

(Note: this was probably the most popular stall in the entire place!) The gado gado salad was very, VERY fresh and delicious. Meat satay stick (pork) was tough and chewy.

/user_details?userid=oGzoCwxBRB7OjuX5UeOnQQ,Magdalena O.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Satay Brothers is the best food I have had in Montreal. Full Stop. Run by two Asian-Polish brothers Matt and Alex who grew up in the hood and know what food needs to be and what is missing from Montreal eats.They source their meat from the local butcher and use the freshest ingredients. They operate a tight ship of flavor that will have you addicted upon first taste. I remember coming in for the first day this 2012 season and bought the chicken satay (which comes with marinated cucumbers and a to-die-for nut sauce), and Alex gave me a sampling of their Laksa soup. I sat down and was in no way prepared for the intsta-foodboner (WHICH HAS YET TO SUBSIDE ON MULTIPLE VISITS). Since I live in the hood I come fairly often, and not just because Alex has a charm no one can escape. Their satays change depending on the day (chicken, pork, shrimp). If you're really hungry go for the papaya salad that is a perfect addition of crunch and acid for the satay. I've never had the steamed pork bun but my friend did and he loved it. If only I wasn't gluten free I would eat their whole menu... in one go. Plus, they have a staff of some of the cutest guys in the hood. I don't mind. The thought of them opening a resto makes my whole body full of mini explosions in anticipation. Go here! Wait in the crazy line! Just do it. Honestly, it's worth it. So worth it. Plus, what else are you gonna eat? Carbs and carbs?"

Satay Brothers pricing their salads and soups with/without meat - meatless versions are already being quite pricey (considering it's a market with no proper tables/no washrooms/people walking).

Pork belly bun and tofu buns are average, but meeting the expectations. Satay chicken brochettes i'd recommend, their peanut sauce is very good . The staff is also super friendly and cool! The only inconvenience is cash only, but there are atm machines all around. Definitely one of the best places around the market! If you haven't tried it yet you're missing out!"
/user_details?userid=ad4By5tyPDOo6DNIm1YQUA,Brendan H.,"Summerside, Canada",5 star rating,"Unreal laksa. I grew up in Australia, and have had my share of awesome Malaysian cuisine. This was completely on par with what I love, and the customer service was brilliant. Quick, friendly, and very very impressive. It's such a simple thing, but asking your customer's name in a familiarizing way and then repeating it back to them is a huge deal and makes you want to come back as soon as possible."
/user_details?userid=wxRVZowoEoy7kscvU-FX-w,Elle O.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I had very high expectations for this place based on the rave reviews. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with my experience here. As others have said, portions are small and thus overpriced. Three little chicken skewers (essentially 1-2 bites per skewer) for $8?? One mini-bun (about 3/4 the size of my palm) for $5.75?? Food was decent, but is essentially just grilled food we can make at home. Didn't try the salad or soup, which are undoubtedly more difficult to make and I will update this review if we ever go back and try them. Service was also a disappointment; we were smiley and polite, but the cashier was very standoffish and dismissive -- like he was one of the cool kids in high school. Although to be fair, the cashier (one of the brothers) was a lot nicer to regulars/friends, as well as an elderly tourist after us -- I guess we have to be regulars or about 30 years older in order to be treated with a little more kindness. I'm not complicated -- I need either awesome service, or good deals to like a place. This place unfortunately did not have either. I don't get the hype. At all."

Atwater market provides an absolutely great atmosphere,the brothers Matt and Alex are super nice..and the food is amazing. I try to have something different each time..they have a set menu and a weekly menu (everything is good!)Cash only and be ready to wait a few minutes because there is almost always a line up (but worth the wait ;) )"

The food is always super fresh and extremely tasty. I've south Asian cuisine, and this is probably my favorite place to get it. The soup is very good, the sandwiches are great and they satays are great. The service is one thing that I would call almost restaurant like, you order find a table, and before you know it your food it right there in front of you to dig it to."

By that I mean, it is uncomplicated, inexpensive, delicious and delightful and owners and servers are always cheerful, helpful and just downright awesome.I confess...I am not a Montrealais, which does not mean that by nature I do not enjoy food. In fact of the matter is I like to graze...kind like a vache Quebecoise! Satay Brothers is another little place, dear in my heart now that I've discovered it ...and shamefully so because I do not live the cosmopolitan and incroyable city of Montreal year around...but just visit and return year after year as it is becoming my favourite destination in North America.Let me cut to the chase...stand in line...just be patient and you will be rewarded with some of the finest southeast asian specialties like satay skewers...there is also a satay of the day...like Pork or chicken, whichever..there is also a fabulous entree soup called Laksa Lemak, spiced to your liking...my friend Michelle got ten spoons of sambal in hers but she is crazily adventurous and likes her mouth to be set on fire.There are also delightful little steamed buns, with various fillings...the day I visited was pork. In addition there are a handful of deserts but just as a heads up, they sell out quickly...and last but not least there is the popular fresh papaya salad.So when in the Atwater market area, try something new and support local merchants and these delightful people (owners are brothers Alex and Mat).The line is less long in early afternoon like 2 pm however, they are more likely to have run out of some of their dishes by then. They are very swift with some dishes while others take a little longer and patience it shall be rewarded :) FYI, they are closed on Tuesday and Wednesday for well deserved days off. A bientot chers Amis, your friend, Antoine."

Perfect spot for a quick and light lunch after biking on the Canal or before running some errands at the market. The steamed pork buns are amazing. We also tried the satay sandwich which was sweet and savory and a fresh salad. The servings are small so perfect for snacking, or take a few if you're super hungry!"
/user_details?userid=MrxB6Yxm-l8_E9r4gpMRzA,Chloe L.,"Tampa, FL",3 star rating,"I visited Montreal for the first time. I got craving for THAI papaya salad for some reasons, and went to Satay Brothers to try out based on reviews from Yelp! Honestly, it was not that good. The papaya salad was too sour and the kebab was burnt. I also got laksa, which tasted just fine and the green pandan/sticky rice was not as expected, quite chalky (if it even makes sense^_^). It was nice experience though because the store is located in the Marche Atwater. It was quite pricey and the line was quite long. Worth trying for the experience though"

/user_details?userid=8apKnC2iVfWnfB4cIgUBMw,Jason L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The Satay brothers are bringing to Montreal the tastes and flavours of what they were brought up on - their south-east Asian background. Major points for having their mom in the kitchen for the summer making sure that what they're putting out has the official mom ""stamp of approval"". Sharing with the Atwater Market and at the same time, transporting me back to a place where if I closed my eyes, I could swear I was 15,000kms away is an accomplishment in itself... up until my bubble was popped by hearing some guy yell out ""AWAYE ostie"", because I was standing there like an idiot, eyes closed in front of his car as he was trying to park."

/user_details?userid=cghH4crNFzYXz5uRenODQQ,Dong L.,"Lachine, Canada",5 star rating,The menu is short. But all seven orders we had were delicious. The line is long. But really worth the wait. The boys are all tattooed. But they are really nice and cool and real and cook good food. Going back again is a sure thing.
/user_details?userid=QnmgtQ0ZQZZdRx18khQg2g,Jo W.,"Houston, TX",5 star rating,Awesome find.  This was definitely the busiest prepared food stand at Atwater Market.  Every item on the menu sounded so good that we had a hard time choosing.  We ordered the laksa (spicy noodle soup) and papaya salad.  Both were awesome.
