I got the chicken empanadas which came with a salsa on the side that compliments it well. I also got the beef patty sandwhich trio which came with coleslaw, a drink and some corn chips. The sandwhich was delicious, soft and had a lot of fillings in between. The chips came with an avocado dip and it was creamy and flavorful. The coleslaw was good but had an interesting aftertaste. Since I ordered with uber eats, it came with an alfajores. It was not too sweet and light. The order came super quickly. Would definitely order again."

Clearly not trying to serve authentic meals, but more of a north american version of chilean classics. Wrong type of olive in the empanadas, which are way too small by the way. Their empanadas are more similar to the Argentinian style that are this small. The Completi hotdog was also a disapointment, from the wrong choice of bread ( completely split and open under the sausage) to a very disapointing sausage. What a disapointment this place is!"
