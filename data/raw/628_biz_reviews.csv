/user_details?userid=iVmBpLCIuUA0Hsu1eNKQ4g,Nav D.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"So I can talk about the Lucky Charm Latte but you've already read about it.  So I'll just quickly say that the chai latte is legit.  These guys have figured out how to make a chai latte that carries the complexity of Indian spices well and yet isn't overly sweet.  Side note:  sorry Oprah.  You might make a good president one day but your chai needs work.Coffee is essential but so is food and they have many options.  First off, on my Tuesday morning visit, it seemed like it was a one man show from order taking, to food prep, to table service.  Hats off to the man who made it happen.  I ordered the avocado toast, which I know might sound sort of basic, but wow was it advanced.  So the avocado toast here is a combination of smashed haas avocados, Bulgarian feta and middle eastern za'atar on sourdough.  Its like the United Nations of avocado toast.I would certainly come back here next time I'm in Montreal!"

It was first owned by an Australian and now a lovely local couple took over.  They have beautiful colourful art on the walls and also sell some Australian goodies. I came here for brunch with a friend. I got the Smashed Avocado sandwich, which was very flavourful! Although it was pricey, I still recommend!"
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"We wanted to grab a coffee after walking around the Mural Festival. I suggested we check out Cafe Melbourne as I've never been before. It's close to Hef Kostein. We dropped in on a Thursday afternoon (around 1:00pm). The inside is chic but with a very laid back vibe to it. If you walk into the back, they have a cool terrasse set up. The menu is small (brunch options) along with coffee. - Flat white ($4.00) - C thought there wasn't enough caffeine in it but she prefers regular coffee. I had a sip and thought it was decent.Would come back to try their brunch."
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My boyfriend came here on Sunday and sat outside in front of the restaurant. It was perfect because it was a nice warm day. I started with the matcha latte and then ordered the avocado toast that is part of the all day brunch. The dish consisted of toasted sourdough, smashed avocado, soft boiled egg, halloumi (cheese), roasted tomatoes, macadamia Dukkah and fresh sprout. To be honest I prefer my homemade avocado toast. I'm not a fan of sprout and also there was something sweet like jam on top. The nuts were a nice touch though. It gave it a nice crunch.My boyfriend ordered the Americana coffee and the Toastie from the all day brunch menu! I had some of his toastie and I much preferred the toastie to the avocado toast. It wasn't what I pictured though. The Toastie is a grilled cheese sandwich with mozzarella, kefta, grilled eggplant and zucchini, roasted red pepper, and ricotta tahini with a fried egg on top. When I think of a grilled cheese I picture a thin pressed sandwich but this grilled cheese was thick and the slices of bread were not pressed tightly together like I would have imagined it I would come back and try other things on the menu. It was a cute brunch place and I really enjoyed the toastie. My boyfriend on the other hand was not very impressed with what he ordered. For him it tasted alright but was nothing special."

It is a small cafe but has an inviting ambiance. The brunch menu is practically the same as  their lunch (kinda confusing), but considering the size of the cafe they definitely have a great menu with delicious options. If you like cheese try their halloumni you won't regret it! One of the better lattes I've had in a while! We ordered the toasti, avocado toast, lucky charm latte and several other small items. All the food was tasty and flavorful. There is a Large picnic table for outdoor seating ..... if you're lucky. I'll be sure to visit again next time I'm in Montreal"

However, the latte itself was subpar. Once you finish the Lucky charms, the latte is pretty bitter. I don't know that I would recommend this because you pay an extra $1.75 just to have the Lucky charms on top!This is a cute little cafe, and the breakfast/brunch menu seems delicious. But, don't fall for the hype of this latte. For $6, it's not worth it.It would be cheaper to buy a latte from McDonald's and a box of Lucky charms from the grocery store!! Haha"

/user_details?userid=jpF5VxuG9moPTZzDfAPuSA,Tram L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I have absolute love for this place. I went the 1st time in the winter out of random pick and we had to wait a bit in line. It was small and cozy. By the time we sat down, it was around 1pm I think... the chef came over to our table to tell us that they only had 2 plates left. I explained I eat gluten free and he was more than happy to alter it a little to make it fit my diet. He's awesome, so smiley and friendly. Oh. My. God. It was so good I licked my plate  I came back 3 weekends in a row.You have to as well. Really. Go, now!!!!"
/user_details?userid=EJ5ybtY1FqieuS22LHbT1w,Claire L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I've been going to Café Melbourne regularly for awhile now. A lot has changed in the past few months and I hope they can keep their grungy Australian vibe despite their new direction towards food service.As a coffee shop, they always have had one of the most affordable lattes in town ($4). Recently they started serving a bit more elaborate items (eg. lucky charms latte, turmeric latte hovering around $6), but it definitely caters to your instagram! With that, the prices have gone up a bit. I believe that brunch is a regular thing now, and they have a few permanent menu items! I love the smashed avocado toast with halloumi cheese. I am always impressed with what they can pull off without a full on service kitchen. With their popularity, they have raised prices a bit, most brunch items are between $17-22. You will definitely leave well fed though! They have hammered out most of the service kinks since their very buzzy start. Would recommend showing up for around 10-10:15 to have a guaranteed seat. Place tends to fill up pretty quickly."

No line up (because it's a little farther than the busy streets of mtl), great customer service, and delicious food. Oh so delicious."
/user_details?userid=GiF2Kj4rsUIo3WCZGCqvCg,Isaiah F.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"We got a late start and Joseph needed coffee. We had our sights set on a cafe further down the road but eventually our patience ran thin and Cafe Melbourne caught our eye. It was the bright and colorful art pulled us in; the delicious meal made us stay. And the cool hats of the staff. The first big decision facing us was whether to order the lucky charms latte. We sent it, ofc--honestly, not all that tasty, but fun idea nonetheless. Golden latte hit the spot, flavorful, soothing, no sugar OD. No refills on the drip coffee, which I get, but also no cream, which felt somewhat unnecessary. Love being hip, but can still give people the option of cream in their coffee, no? Two of us got the chicken toastie and it was a hit. ""Decadent"" -Becca. Avo toast was also electric. ""5/5"" -Becca. Feelings were more mixed re: the waffle--Amita felt that the plate was a little all over the place, with no particular rhyme or reason. The popcorn in particular felt like a gimmick, although Joseph thought it added a nice buttery sheen to a bite of waffle. Overall, if there was one downside, it was a minor disconnect between concept and execution with respect to elements of certain dishes (the popcorn on the waffle, the salad/fruit combo on the side of the toastie), but food was scrumptious, coffee got the job done, staff was great, def come here to start your day off right!"
/user_details?userid=LtEC2hPVbF5sKmZwHLTPFw,Scott B.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"You will love the shit out of everything about this place, it's got everything - an old school tape deck, local photography, hot grungy waiters, kitschy caffeinated takes on vintage cereal and a style all it's own. While the menu is a short read, everything is amazing. There was a veritable Civil War at our table over what was the best on the menu - my vote was the Toastie, but there was fierce competition from the Smashed Avocado. If you're wanting the full experience you'll probably go with the Lucky Charm Latte, but the Tumeric Latte was a delight. Skip the line at Beauty's and treat yourself to brunch done down under."

/user_details?userid=_k5Fkhardd0CyeuCpYV_EQ,Kyle J.,"Pittsburgh, PA",3 star rating,"I tried the lucky charm latte. You pay $6 for it and I have to say that for that price it is not worth it. The latte itself isn't anything special and he lucky charms cereal on top is more of a decoration. I did not happen to try the food, but it looks pretty good. But I would recommend staying away from this place if you are looking for a good quality coffee or latte."
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Location: On the main, in what I guess is considered the Mile End. Again, being a walk-everywhere kinda gal, I'm going to say that Laurier or Mont-Royal are the closest subways (5-10 minute walk from there). Street parking is available [metered].The place: I wasn't excited or blown away by the space. First, there's one communal table that looks like it's made with plywood but in all honestly, I didn't go inspect the thing so I might be mistaken about the thickness of the tabletop. The bulk of the seating is bar-type, which makes it somewhat difficult to go there with more than one friend unless you don't mind talking loudly and shifting seats around so you can actually see your people, without pissing off your neighbours for taking up too much space. The decor was average, the place a bit dim, and they've got some Australian stuff for sale, mainly the dreadful Vegemite (though if you're Australian, you automatically love this).The goods: I didn't like the coffee. Way too bitter and I'm pretty sure my Macchiato didn't have that drop of milk that is necessary to smooth out the espresso. It was more bitter than anything else and my teeny, tiny cup was half -full (at Olimpico, it's full - just saying'). That being said, I had one of their veggie muffins (savoury) and not only was it super freshly baked, it was outstanding. I mean, seriously f-ing amazing. I'd buy that sh*t in bulk. Service: Leaves to be desired. I personally found the staff to be unfriendly and indifferent - I mean, what does it take to crack a smile? A can-opener? I didn't really feel comfortable when placing my order, but more like I was bothering them. Pas cool.Price point: I don't remember how much I paid but if I recall, it was on par with other places."
/user_details?userid=5ca2MkCJFAMafDrRxLMlXQ,Ash L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"First discovered Melbourne cafe when i just moved to Montreal, the sign of ""our French is not good but our coffee is"" definitely caught my eyes and made me feel home sick. I really value their courage of starting this little business in a new city/country. I ordered a latte and it was pretty good. I never came back for 2 years until they started doing pop-up brunches and my Toronto friend insisted coming here today- the Instagram photos of their brunch items look like real pieces of arts! At 10 when the store opened, it was already 95% full and their servers speak perfect French. The menu is insanely creative and the items are of extremely high quality. I'm so happy for their success in Montreal! I think we should all keep an open mind to try something new and give people a chance in a new city: I tried something new today- turmeric latte, and my friend- lucky charm latte."

Everything on their menu sounded like a wonderful treat for the tummy. I decided to go for the avocado toast with cheese and a soft boiled egg and boy was I happy with that decision. It was very filling and enjoyable. I also had a lucky charms latte and it was magically delicious...no really, it was a treat for my inner child and for my instagram page. Definitely returning to this cafe!"
/user_details?userid=F8vvROPYyQS_KJ4beM5xHw,Shawna B.,"Leduc, Canada",3 star rating,Excellent quality coffee. They clearly know what they are doing in that regard. Shabby interior though. Looks like a tiny high school cafeteria complete with the wood chairs that give your butt slivers.

Bar seating, communal table, and patio seating are available. They also have great wi-fi (thank god).Their lattes are generous in size, creamy, and quite smooth. Kitsuné is probably the closest reference point for the taste. They also have great savoury muffins and grilled sandwiches (jaffles).Highly recommended for this neighbourhood."

Montreal definitely maintains the French attitude toward food - cozy cafes and fantastic fare.I'll be coming back here again.
/user_details?userid=mxigEq_RsnrOSGUEW096qA,Jimmy M.,"Adelaide, Australia",3 star rating,"After searching online for great coffee places in Montreal, Cafe Melbourne was one of the first places on the list. Being an Australian and having spent the best part of the previous four weeks in America, I was excited to have the opportunity to have a great coffee. The barister didn't seem too interested in having our business when we arrived. It really felt like he was more interested in talking to others that were sitting in a bar area in the cafe. We ordered coffee and some jaffles from the food menu, which seemed reasonably priced. When the coffees were ready we had to bring them to where we were sitting ourselves. Surely if you're being tipped then this service would at the very least be included?! The coffee turned out to be okay but nothing too special. The atmosphere was a little awkward. There was no music or anything and a lot of swearing from the guys who run the place. The food was good though, did enjoy the mac n cheese jaffle. Probably the saving grace for this review. Maybe we caught these guys on a bad day but wouldn't go out your way to come here."
/user_details?userid=0gZ8E5tBWTEtGEZDuTzhzw,Cindy Feng Xin L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I used to be fascinated by the pics of Melbourne Café because the presentation of their brunch is really unique and the flavours very diverse. I tried once their brunch (on the coldest day of the year) and I found it a bit disappointing. 20$ for a red velvet hotcake with Lucky Charm adorned bacon and a handful of Tostitos, sounds original but the taste was not exquisite. Melbourne doesn't offer brunch every weekend and the lunch options during the week are limited, mostly grilled cheese with chips, which was not very savoury according to me. The coffee is quite good and the price is okay. The decor of the café is average, nothing extraordinary, nice and quiet during the week but quite crazy over the weekend."

Well, having had many excellent coffees in the real Melbourne (one of the great coffee cities of the world) I just had to compare. My 4 oz 'latte' pushed all the right buttons. A solid effort, and definitely worth the 40 minute walk to get here. The cheese toasty (with marmite, sorry, vegemite) was nicely presented with mini dill pickles and a few crisps. Nicely, done. What I missed was a slab of fruit toast. I think the Australians have taken fruit toast to a culinary peak, and when I set out to come here, that was what I was looking for. Nevertheless, if you're in Montreal you have to try this place."

She's the coffee connoisseur & and I'm the tea addict. Good : I had tea. Surely you can't screw up hot water and a tea bag. My tea was fine. Bad : The decor. I thought I walked into someone's basement. The guys behind the counter weren't very inviting either, and my sister said her coffee wasn't that great. Bottom Line : I've always visited new coffee shops with excitement, but this one doesn't stand out to me."

/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",3 star rating,"I guess I like this place ok but it doesn't blow me away. I find the espresso sour without the richness of Le Couteau or Odessa or Arts Cafe. The space feels a little dark, and to be honest the sign outside about not speaking French particularly well rubs me the wrong way somehow. I wish them all the best and I'm glad to see they have a following but I have to be honest, Melbourne doesn't jump to the top of my special beloved coffee lists."
/user_details?userid=VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw,WhiteFeather H.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"Having just returned to Montreal from being in Australia for four months, part of my culture shock returning to North America was the dearth of decent coffee. Australians take their coffee very seriously. This café was like an oasis in a desert. EXCELLENT coffee. They could have been a bit friendlier and a tad less cool, but certainly weren't rude or anything. I got my coffee to go and hit the antique store a few doors down, to peruse cool old stuff and enjoy my long mac, topped up. I'd go back, for sure."
/user_details?userid=oSkz7bxTAoFJxgDGP5wJHg,John H.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"A couple recent lattes at Melbourne were better than the first (still good) ones I tried when they opened in 2014, enough to give them five stars from me and a place among my Montreal coffee favourites: Pikolo at the top, accompanied by Myriade I (Mackay), Myriade II (Saint-Viateur), Tunnel, Couteau, Flocon, and Pourquoi Pas. RIP Café Sardine, while we wait for its coffee to rematerialize at the promised new Maison Sociale. Their food is satisfying and well priced. The menu leans heavily on jaffles, the sealed Australian sandwiches. They have a Breville press that's up to the very special task of sealing liquidy fillings like mac & cheese inside two fused slices of bread where it won't leak out until you bite down. I spent a lovely afternoon here reminiscing with a friend about her time away in real life Melbourne and chatting with the friendly co-proprietor. I like the coffee a little better than Hof Kelsten's across the street and competing Australian-themed Code Black's down the street."

Living organisms can do a lot worse than a good flat white.The gentlemen at the bar were friendly and helpful enough.

If you are a fan of the new wave of coffee- this is where you want to go.  Ambiance is good- relaxed.- Feels like hanging out in a kitchen during a long party.

However I was very disappointed. The two Australia guys behind the counter were unbelievably rude. They made the whole experience extremely uncomfortable and spoke loudly making racist comments. Sadly this has already been stated in a previous review I discovered. I am embarrassed to even be associated with people like that and they do not accurately portray Australians at all.
