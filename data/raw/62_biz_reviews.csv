It had incredible reviews so how could I skip past this place? Here's how it went.Atmosphere/Appearance: So right downtown is this gem. It has such a presence about it, it's incredible. So once inside you're enveloped with such modern, yet retro diner feel. It's truly unique. Bright neon/LED lights, diner stools, stainless steel everywhere, it was just so cool. It was lunch time so it wasn't too busy, but I can totally see this place being packed on a good weekend night!Service: Luduina took care of me and she was excellent. She was clearly experienced, charismatic, sweet and took care of everything that I needed.Food: For my lunch I went with their Cambalache Salad. This salad consists of grilled flat iron steak with red chimichurri sauce atop mixed greens, black beans, corn kernels, hearts of palm, red peppers, yellow peppers, red onions, avocado and mangos all tossed in a light mango dressing. It was fantastic. The salty and savory worked so well with the sweetness. It felt healthy, wasn't heavy and just was straight delicious.Value: (All prices in $CAD.) My salad was $27.00 and I think that was a bit much for a freaking salad, but it had steak on it so that's likely where the cost came from. No worries, it was worth it.In conclusion, I really enjoyed this place and wish I had known about it much earlier in my Montréal visits. Their food AND drink menu is extensive and intriguing! Check this place out if you're around!"

As tourists, my husband and I obviously ordered the poutine and let me just say, BOMB.COM!!!!! I haven't experienced poutine much but this place makes it soo good I really don't care to try other places! My husband and I quickly devoured that. For our entrees I got the Kentucky country fried steak  dish & he got a pasta dish! Again they were both so yummy. The drinks were flavorful too and had cool names. I do recommend sharing dishes because they do give large portions but overall the food is veryyy tasty here. Parking was a little difficult, we did have to pay for parking in a lot  but there is parking on the streets if you're lucky to get a spot. Service was great tooo! Our waiter gave us great drink recommendations & also food recommendations which I thought was very nice especially since we are not from there! 10/10 food 10/10 drinks 10/10 ambience"

The wall decor inside gives off an old school vibe which I loved.My friends loved it. I on the other hand deduct one star - 1. Because it was a struggle to eat such a large sandwich. It was super messy and I was getting a little frustrated being that I was hungry 2. It was kinda dry. Wish it had more sauce. Fries were amazing. Staff was very polite as well Overall the meal was well prepared and the wait time was very brief.

It was extremely busy and I like the 50s Diner vibe through-out the place. The menus and booths are cute and the servers were extremely friendly and nice for most of it.I ordered the Mac N Cheese Wontons as they seemed to be a hit within my fellow yelpers reviews. However, I found it to be very bland and barely finished one due to the lack of flavor. Maybe it was an off night for the kitchen? The server even mentioned it was odd as it's their best seller. Just wasn't for me and I didn't see anything else on the menu that really tickled my fancy. I mean, there are good things on the menu but then some random ingredient would be added that would throw off the dish in my opinion (See the fried . My husband however, enjoyed his mussels and it was a heaping portion! He said they were delicious and would order them again!"

I definitely recommend if you can't find a place to eat before the game, cause all the restaurants close to the Bell Center are really packed before the games, so you really need to reserve...your best bet would be Deville Dinerbar!Good, filling and fast service.I think I've been ordering the Ahi tuna tacos since they opened..and of course that's what I ordered! This is consistently good, every single time.The tacos are fried and crispy, and the filling is fresh. The sauce is on the side, so depending how good you are at eating this and keeping the tacos whole..you will either spread, dip or ..end up eating this with a fork and knife. This might not be the best choice for a first date or business meal..but it's definitely in my opinion, a must try!They also have specials on specific drinks, depending on the night."
/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"My husband and I had lunch at Deville Dinebar and overall the food was good, but I found it a bit pricey for what it was. I had the Deville Macho Salad ($23) and my husband had the Korean Fried Chicken Sandwich with fries ($20). I asked for no corn kernels in my salad and for the salad dressing to be on the side. My salad came as requested. However, for some reason my salad was missing the sliced almonds that was listed on the menu. Anyway, so my salad had mixed greens (iceberg, romaine, radicchio, and spinach), rotisserie chicken, grape tomatoes, goat cheese, avocado, dates and cornbread croutons. The dressing was a champagne vinaigrette. I liked that the chicken was lean breast meat. It still had the skin on, but no big deal, I just peeled it off and didn't eat it. The croutons were really unique. The cornbread was really sweet and had almost a caramelized flavour to it. The crunchy texture and the sweetness actually went well with the rest of the salad. They were generous with the goat cheese. I was a bit disappointed to see iceberg in a $23 salad. I was expecting tastier greens, like kale or arugula, but at least it had spinach and radicchio.My husband enjoyed his Korean Fried Chicken Sandwich. He said the meat was a combination of dark and white meat. He said the Kimchi was really mild, so don't shy away from it if you don't like pungent Kimchi. The fries were shoestring fries which are my absolute favourite. I was lucky enough to be able to snag a few and they were fantastic. Service was friendly and efficient. Our server, Cameron, refilled our waters when he noticed they were low and he checked up on us appropriately. They also give you lots of ice with your water, which I love. Our food came out relatively quick.Decor I would describe as diner-like with a lounge-like feel, if that makes sense, lol. The place is fairly large. Unless you are just having an appetizer, you cannot get a meal for less than $20. Sandwiches and salads are the least expensive items and they start at $20. Mains are in the $30-50 range. The food was good, but like I said, I personally found it pricey for what it was."
/user_details?userid=e0AUdCu-jeOkLImiEzlTDg,Jonathan W.,"Brampton, Canada",4 star rating,"As many have probably said in other reviews, the prices are a bit higher than expected, but once the food arrives it seems like a fair deal.Deville is quite a large space and the design is if you mixed upscale and kitschy diner. I ended up ordering the Korean fried chicken burger. One reason I did is I believe the price was closest to what I thought a comparable restaurant would charge (somewhere around $20), but also because it looked good. Once it arrived, the presentation looked great and it appeared very appetizing. The sandwich is huge too. Once I bit in, it was clear the chicken was fresh and made in house. I was also surprised that they seemed to go quite legit with the kimchi. It had all the pungency and heat you'd expect from real kimchi rather than a watered-down version at a hipster restaurant. The side salad was needed on my behalf as I had eaten virtually nothing but carbs the 48 hours leading up to it. The salad was made with very deep greens and was extremely fresh. Aside from the latent health benefits of it (and it wasn't over-dressed), it seemed to give me a placebo affect of some type of cleanse by body needed. Yes, I'm aware of how inconsistent that is with my choice of burger.My friend ordered the wonton ahi tuna tacos. I can review since I had an entire one (the order comes with three). As with the theme, the price seemed a little steep, but once you see the three large tacos - and more importantly: taste the quality of the tuna, it turns out to be fair enough. I honestly loved them, and the taste and freshness of them was superb. The only problem with them was they can get a bit messy since they're stuffed and also since the wonton taco starts to break apart easily. On the flip side, I still don't think they have to change as the wonton taste and texture is so perfectly matched to the dish. That initial bite of the crisp wonton, the soft, warm tuna and the freshness of crisp veggies still sticks out in my mind.I'd heartily recommend this place. If 'dinebar' elicits 'diner' or specifically diner prices, you need to do away with that notion. Virtually everything on the menu - appies included - starts near $20 and then goes north from there. But once you see the portions and taste the quality, it's par for the course and worth trying for sure."
/user_details?userid=DsRVytxsQl0bj1il7WsgAg,Michelle C.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"We were a large group of 12 and it was very nice of the restaurant to be able to accommodate with us in a short notice. The decor was stunning and had amazing lighting. I personally ordered a bbq chicken tacos and it surprised me that it ended up being a lettuce wrap. I think the flavouring of the food was good but nothing too special. The chicken was kinda spicy as well which was unexpecting. Another friend also ordered the Mac and cheese lasagna and according to him, he said it was very good and filling. Overall though, the food was a little bit pricey but the portions were big at least. I've been told that the desserts are a go to so next time I'm in Montreal, I will definitely go back to try that."
/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here with a few friends on a Sunday night.The decor is very fun and original. The vibe is really fun, almost making us forget that the weekend was almost over.We were seated in a comfy booth and looked over the menu. They have so many options, all which looked delish. All the comfort food you could ever want.We shared an order of the mac and cheese wontons which were served in a cute take-out box with their logo on it. They were good, though possibly a bit underwhelming.Then I shared the Ahi Tuna salad with my friend. It was a huge portion and was very good. All fresh ingredients and nice presentation.For dessert, we all shared the Pain perdu (basically french toast and ice cream). It was super sweet so I wouldn't order it if that's not your thing. Thankfully for me, I love sweet desserts!The prices are a bit expensive but it makes sense for the location (right downtown). They do have a lunch menu which could be good for a work lunch. The service was pretty good when I was there but the restaurant also wasn't so busy."
/user_details?userid=c4lTZbA8NeZBgB1YYB6Izg,Julie C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a classic and fun American style upscale dining without the posh pretentious vibe. The decor is fun and they make fun drinks and have drinks specials for each night of the week (though I find them a bit sweet). Would recommend this place for a fun ""college girl's night"". Food and service are both good. It's not somewhere I'd return in a heart beat but I've been a few times and they were all favourable experiences. A little pricy for the value  in my personal opinion. Would give it a 3.5 stars if I could do half stars!"
/user_details?userid=8qu5Zyurap002eIj1kLdOg,Joana Z.,"Saint-Lambert, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been to Deville twice and I've always felt like I was welcomed there. The décor is absolutely stunning, reminds you of a real diner, like the ones you see in movies and TV shows with an extraordinary pink theme. Their seating area isn't huge so make sure you call to reserve before showing up announced. The clientèle is mostly high-class people, but I've shown up once after school wearing a hoodie and leggings and they'll still welcome you. The only thing that's a bit disappointing is how loud it gets especially during the evening because the tables are very close to each other. Their drinking menu is also very versatile, they have a lot of cool options and diverse ones, also mixes that you've never tried before! The drink is very rich in alcohol and the taste is just phenomenal.I've had the chance to try their Philly Cheesesteak Rolls as an appetizer and let me tell you, they are DELICIOUS, definitely worth it. Very cheesy and rich in meat.Their salads aren't like any salad; they're huge! My friend and I split a General Tao salad and the Cambalache salad. They are both very filling, huge portions and delicious, very generous in meat.The staff is friendly, very knowledgeable and also very patient. The food is prepared pretty quickly.I would recommend this place if you're celebrating your birthday, if you're going out on a date or even with a friend!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great food, great service and nice ambience. Their meatloaf is amazing. It's wrapped in bacon and comes with a delicious sauce and some mashed potato and veggies. All the appetizers I've tried such as the ahi tuna tacos or the calamari are delicious. The food is slightly towards the expensive side, but it comes in a great portion. The service is always great here. Our waitress tonight was so friendly and made us great suggestions for drinks. The place has a terrace towards the inside and it's great to eat there since you're not next to the road and cars."

/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I've always enjoyed the food and the experience at Deville, but I cannot say that there is any one dish that really sets them apart from other restaurants. Sure, their burgers are tasty enough, but for the most part fall into the category of ""messy kitchen sink"" burgers in which there are mountains of overly complex toppings like root beer or bone marrow mayo, pork belly, and short rib. Ultimately, the burger is overwhelmed by the toppings and add ons, to the point where the beef takes a back seat.  I'm not saying the burgers aren't tasty, because they absolutely are. I just prefer a burger where I can choose my own cook on the beef and really taste it. What more, the burgers are moderately overpriced, even taking into account the rent in the downtown core. The other night, we started with the lobster roll appetizer. You are essentially getting 3 mini lobster rolls with the equivalent amount of meat found in 1 normally sized roll. They were quite tasty, but I cannot say the lobster salad mixture was bursting with fresh ocean flavour (not that I really expect as much on a frigid Saturday sitting in a restaurant on the dreary and lifeless Stanley street). I will say that it is clear that they shelled the lobster themselves because I almost ripped a filling out biting on a shell (see picture below). SO......Good for you for actually cooking and shelling a lobster in your kitchen. Shame on you for leaving pieces of the shell in it. Finally, at $23.50, they are charging about 5 dollars too much for this dish. At that price, there should be 4 mini rolls so that the dish can be shared equally.My wife had the ahi tuna salad which I tasted. The fish was fresh, and the portion of greens is very large. The dressing is unremarkable and could use a little acidity to brighten things up. For dessert, we tried the Oreo cookie ice cream sandwich. I forget the price, but I can say that it tastes identical to the type of Oreo ice cream sandwich you find in a depanneur freezer. Nothing wrong with that if you are not opposed to mind numbing boredom and mediocrity. Next time, I'll get the apple pie or banana cream pie dessert provided that my dining companion heeds my advice.Deville is always enjoyable, but seldom memorable. They actually have quite a large menu full of pasta dishes, steaks, and sandwiches. Their prices are too high in my humble opinion, and I feel that if I'm going to spend between 50-80$ on dinner before alcohol, I will want to go to a fancier place that specializes in something. The vibe here is just a little too casual for me to want to drop 200$ plus on dinner. I can go to Liverpool house, I can book Gibbys or Lucilles, and with a little effort, I can snag a reservation at Tuck shop or Pied de Cochon. More power to them if their status quo business model is working for them."
/user_details?userid=l133MthZ-NDhxNM-09QMMA,Justin C.,"West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,"This is a 50s inspired diner that is kid-friendly. Just let them know if you are bringing kids and they seat you upstairs and out of the bar area. Our hotel recommended this spot for dinner and called ahead for us. David (possibly a manager) was great. He got us seated right away, even though they were busy. We were hungry so I got some fries as a starter to share with the table. The fries were a hit, but then again, I told you we were hungry. I had the maple rotisserie chicken, which was pretty good. The rice on the side, was very not good. I didn't even mess with it. Two in our party ordered the salmon. One salmon was sent back to cook longer and the  other had an undercooked part but he ate around it. Both said the flavor of the salmon was on point. Final Word: A cool and casual dinner place to check out."
/user_details?userid=GQGvCTi2SvL9U_d3fsm9Tw,Stan C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"With so many mouth-watering options to choose from it was funny that my lunch-mate and I both chose the Bacon-wrapped meatloaf. Funny, yes. Surprising, no; they had us at ""bacon"".Let me tell you, it was delicious! The belly-filling portion of meatloaf was accompanied by a mushroom and truffle sauce that was  absolutely wonderful - deep, embracing and rich! Veggies on the plate included - of course - mashed potatoes, as well as broccoli florets and (regrettably) a beautiful yet completely inedible carrot - a carrot so underdone that my knife could barely mar the surface. Both my companion and I left the gorgeous root uneaten on our plate.Service was excellent and friendly - from the hostess at the door to our delicately perfumed server. I can't wait to rediscover this ""Diner"" with other friends."
/user_details?userid=y158lUTlxiUiqlkUIPgtng,Lindsay H.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"Cool diner with a hip club vibe that I would probably hate if I was back in LA, but here I kinda liked it.I was craving a burger, and turns out they have an entire page of burgers. In fact, their burger patty is a special three-meat blend. (I don't remember the three meats.)I was torn between a burger with bacon and loads of cheese, which is pretty much my go-to, or a unique one with a poached pear, brie cheese and red onion marmalade. I ended up going with the latter and was so happy I did. It was delicious!! As a side, I subbed in a house salad for the matchstick fries, which sounded great but I had fries with lunch already.Let me just say, the house salad is not your standard house salad. It had arugula - my fave! - candied pecans, shredded golden beets, grape tomatoes, parmesan and balsamic reduction. I absolutely loved it and could have eaten an entree-sized version. Again, the burger was delicious but I do have to say, the patty was a bit odd. I dont know if they cook it didn't than I'm used to or if it's a frozen patty vs fresh ground beef. All the things were great and I'm glad I tried something different than my usual."

I had The Drive in burger- which was a double patty, cheddar cheese, red onions, mayo, and the bun.... omG... the bun was sooo tasty and freshThe Deville Macho Salad that one of my colleague had was really good... the salad is composed of: rôtisserie free range chicken, avocado, crumbled goat cheese, corn bread crouton (she did not fancy it too much) and a champagne vinaigrette along with the other ingredients featured in the picture.I rate Deville 5 stars, for consistently delivering tasty dishes and always top quality.. Service: 2 stars, we made reservations for 5 people and asked for a booth and when we got there, we were told that booths can accomodate 4 people.. I was clear when I said we would like a booth as we are celebrating 2 birthday girls! The waiter who was not assigned to our table was sarcastic and fresh! Lacked people's skills and I wish I had taken note of his name because he definitely warrants some coaching. He was bothered that I had taken an extra napkin from the table next to ours. So if it was up to service only, I would not return... the chefs is the reason my colleagues and myself would return!"

He was making a couple of some sort of multilayered drink with I think Kahlua. He was trying to get the quantity even and poured more into his jigger to pour into the one shot. When he finished, he poured the remainder back into the bottle. Ew. He looked up and saw that I saw him. I didn't order a drink."

Full disclosure, as we were on a food crawl day and going somewhere else that day, I didn't get a meal here bc we were going to one of my fave eating spots in they city after, so my friends ordered the ahi tuna tacos.  The portion is pretty big, but so are the prices lol.  My friend said it was delicious and would have ordered more, but $$$I think this would be a great spot to grab drinks at the bar after work, get your IG photos in and grab a nibble or two."

The food is really well prepared and the menu is always interesting. They rotate some meals in and out throughout the year. I just had a Shephards Pie with braised beef that was really amazing. Their puff pastry was spot on, the potatoes were silky, and the beef was tender. My partner had a bourbon glazed steak that was also prepared nicely with a heaping pile of fried onions.The drinks here are also top notch, I've reviewed it before some years ago but they're still really good. And such a colorful drink menu as well.The only downside I would have to say is the price.

Twice was Birthday occasion and once girls' day occasion. The decor of the resto is pretty funky. The service is very amiable. Their cocktail menu and dish menu is very extensive. Every item in the menu is good; I know no one, my surroundings, ever been disappointed. My all time favorite dish is always and will Ahi Tuna taco...the taste and the mix crispy and soft and leafy texture is an absolute delight. Sadly it's a small portion as an appetizer, and expensive. Second favorite dish, that I always have fun with is Mac n Cheese wonton with marinara sauce. I discovered this creation of two items at this restaurant. Such delicious appetizer, yet expensive.Despite the high price, I always enjoyed this place. I think Ahi Tuna taco should be a main dish with extra few tacos...;)So I do recommend this place for the extensive succulent fusion food!"

The seafood tasted fresh, that included 3 large shrimp, mussels and scallop.Half rack of ribs - 4 stars - the ribs were very soft, melt in your mouth, and the bbq sauce was strong and sweet.Deville burger - 4 stars - the burger itself was huge and juicy with lettuce and tomato. Way better than the burger we ate at another restaurant previously. Came with a lot of string fries.

Truthfully, the entire dining experience here is rather underwhelming. Since Deville is about a 5-minute walk from where I work, it's always seems like a convenient lunch, dinner or happy hour option. However, I've been terribly disappointed on my last few visits. The waiters that've served me have seemed uninterested and have had poor attitudes. It always feel like I'm inconveniencing them. The food is bland. On my most recent visit, I ordered the Tuna poke. While it was pretty to look at it, it didn't taste like much. On a positive note, they do have some of the best match stick fries I've ever eaten! If you visit, only order the fries and I guarantee you'd be the happiest person on this planet.It's also important to note, if you have dietary restrictions/concerns, this is not the place for you. There are no dairy-free, vegan or gluten-free options, and no accommodations/substitutes are available."

/user_details?userid=-8nmj3B-tfY_vFiimtBOsw,Sanaz N.,"Laval, Canada",4 star rating,"Went here for my friends birthday on a Saturday night. We were all seated on the second floor. Let's start with the negative so we can get it out of the way. The tables are bit small and we all felt very crammed into each other. Menu's are bulky and difficult to manage when you are so close to the person next to you. It is also more difficult when in winter and everybody has coats. I would recommend give more space to customers.Now let's get to the better part of the review, we were in total 11 people, we were quickly greeting by our waiter that gave some recommendations. He came by at least twice to see if we had any questions about the menu.  What I was most impressed about was the timing, they brought our drinks and about 10 minutes brought our appetizers once all appetizers were done they waited 15 minutes and brought all plates and the same time, so we could all eat at the same time, which I really appreciated.Az an appetizer I shared the calmari which was very good and specially liked the spicy sauce it had a good kick. I ordered the deville burger, which I really enjoyed, juice, nicely seasoned with wonderful condiments. The bun was so good and the fries were to die for. Everybody loved their food, from the salads to the meatloaf.At the end we ordered their fabulous beignets which came with two sides, chocolate and caramel sauce. Fluffy inside and a nice crust on the outside.Also the drinks were really yummy, I had the fish bowl sangria which was so huge, but also one of the best sangria's I ever had.Deville Dinerbar is a great place for a group event, or a girls/boys night out. Very noisy and busy place, so if you are planning for a quiet romantic evening, this place is not for you.A huge thanks to our waiter, who was well informed, patient, and funny."

Their menu is intense... innovative apps like bacon wrapped hot dog sliders and mini lobster rolls. Decadent entrees - lots of different steak and seafood options. Burgers, gourmet salads and pastas, boozy shakes. The list goes on and on. The restaurant is set up to look like a flashy old school diner and they pull it off well. The menu was a overwhelming! My fiance knew he wanted a classic burger and fries, but I took a bit longer to settle on my order. I went with the macho salad - rotisserie chicken, avocado, goat cheese, corn, dates, tomatoes and thick and crunchy cornbread croutons tossed in a tangy vinaigrette. The salad came served in a massive bowl and was filling and delicious. The rotisserie chicken was moist and well seasoned and was definitely the highlight of the salad bowl. My guy's burger was juicy and dripping with cheese. I really liked the side of thin and crunchy shoestring fries. The only downside is price - expect to pay over 20 dollars for a burger or salad. Luckily the hearty portions made up for that.I'd suggest making a reservation. We didn't, and were only able to sit at one of the high tops and not in the main dining room. Completely fine, but I also didn't expect this at 9 PM on a weekday. So call ahead for sure. Denville Dinerbar is a great spot for quality food in a trendy environment. I have a feeling that it's impossible to go wrong with anything on this menu."

Our server was very nice. Drinks were smooth. I ordered the black label burger as i was told its the most popular. Honestly wayyy too greasy for my liking. And dry. It was basically a whole lotta meat + cheese and nothing else. Sounded good but was missing something and my fingers were drenched by the end. Taking a bite of the burger was like eating a sponge soaked in oil. Maybe a bad choice for me personally. I stole a bite from my husbands ""screaming Korean chicken"" and that was good but also not for me. I will def come again to try something different."

It's an old school diner, yet it's modern; Deville resembles a future-fied diner. It's basically like something out of the jetsons(so sad I'm old enough to know what the jetsons are). The menu reads more like a short novel, of course not to the level of a Cheesecake Factory(that's more like the food encyclopedia), but lengthy nonetheless and full of fun and creative options. Ahi tuna tacos: is anything not good in taco form? The tuna is fresh and perfectly rare. The sauce served on the side is phenomenal. With three to an order, these can probably serve as a main dish rather than an appetizer. These tacos are loaded and pack a ton of flavor. I do mean literally loaded, so much so that it's bound to explode in your hand after one bite. You've been warned....an inevitable delicious mess. Mac and cheese wontons: yes, you read that correctly. Another entree sized meal disguised as an appetizer with five to an order! This concept doesn't even really make sense and honestly shouldn't work, but oh does it work. Creamy Mac and cheese somehow neatly nestled in a fried dough pocket, not at all greasy and pretty satisfying on its own. The kicker? The marinara dipping sauce, perfect pairing. Again, this shouldn't work! This isn't a mozzarella stick, why marinara?! This is clearly the work of an evil genius.....It is fair to note that Deville may be a little pricey for a quick bite(closer to $$$ than $$), but they do have a verity of lunch special options for the budget minded."

It's also a great place to bring a group of girlfriends to enjoy giant fishbowl cocktails in a retro, '50s-style, chic American diner.I've always had a good time at Deville and almost always love what I'm eating. It is a little pricey but that can be explained by the yummy food, the cool vibes and the attentive service in a great location. My favourite go-to appetizers are the mac n cheese wontons and the deep fried pickles. Trust me, if you order these 2 appetizers, you're already off to a really good start. I love their salads as a main course because they're huge and filling (I usually take 1/2 to go) but more importantly, they make you feel better about your decision to indulge in those two deep fried appetizers.My favourite meal is the Neptune Ahi Tuna salad. At $26.50, it better be damn good -- and it is. If you're carnivorous and chuckle at the thought of ordering a salad on a night out, their burgers are delicious and ridiculously huge too so I guess you get more bang for your buck. Their drinks are fun, and their desserts and shakes are ridiculously decadent.I love this place but I only like to go for special occasions -- for the sake of my wallet and my waistline  I'm due for another visit!!"

Unfortunately it wasn't like I remembered it. The mac & cheese wontons came cold which was really deceiving. My burger was good but also not so warm. The food took long to come so I would assume it would at least come warm. I was a little disappointed with my second visit, not to mention Deville is also a little on the pricey side for what you get. Don't know if I'll go back."

The aesthetic of the place is very unique - a sort of early 2000s look that I'm surprised to see as a deliberate choice, given that it looks a bit like a seedy nightclub from 15 years ago. The inside was dark, purple, and incredibly loud, so we chose to sit outside. The weather was nice, and it was a much better dining/talking experience. The menu was impressive, large, and full of creative dishes, but it was also surprisingly expensive - even the most standard burger cost $17, which I don't really feel was warranted by either the decor or the quality.Don't get me wrong, the food was excellent - I had the Korean fried chicken sandwich, for $20 - but it really gouged out a hole in my pocket that I wasn't expecting from a place that has ""diner"" in its name. I'm giving this place 4 stars because the food really is very good, but I just don't think it merits being as expensive as fancy dining."

My friends and I had a few appetizers as we were headed for the movies. I had the fried calamari with sauce which I really liked. I also liked the mac & cheese samosas which came with a sauce as well and was quite filling. I had a hard time finishing it.

We were shopping in downtown Montreal then the skies decided to open up and rain down upon us so we were like oh quick.. a diner.. that will do for lunch! But it turned out be a bit more ""elevated"" than the diners we are used to back in the States. I came in feeling under dressed seeing other business types around, but still was comfortable - it wasn't an issue.We started off with some delicious and beautiful looking trio of mini-lobster rolls. They were really tasty and generously filled with hunks of lobster meat. For our mains we went with Deville Nacho salad which was really fresh and the rotisserie chicken was some of the most juicy & tender I ever tried. We also did the Blue cheese Iceberg that was also very good.Our first visit was a 5 star surprise - excellent food and service across the board. So much so that we decided to go back a second time later that week when we found ourselves in the area and hungry. That visit was not too memorable. The burger I ordered was way overcooked - ""well done"" and a bit on the dry side. I don't remember what else we ordered - perhaps I blocked out this experience preferring to remember Deville in the best possible light of our first meeting!UPDATE 1/5/17: As you can see from Annie N, Business Manager's comment to my review they take much care and attention to detail with their restaurant! I am sure they would have corrected the issue I had on my second visit, but I am not one to send food back and waste it (unless its a serious issue such as being raw or spoiled). Deville is great spot that I recommend when in Downtown Montreal."

/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I have been to Deville Dinebar one other time and remembered they had a fun menu for drinks which inspired my second visit on a cold winter evening. I had made reservations using open table for 4 people at 5 pm. Making my way up to the second floor was a nuisance, as there is one long alley/walkway for clients and the staff to use. No coat hooks nearby with little space for storing personal items. The layout on the second floor is very crammed compared to the spacious first floor. Funny story: the hostess placed me and my friends at two separate tables when we had one reservation under my name. How does that happen??? When I asked our waiter in regards to the mix up, he termed it ""a glitch in the system"". Glitch or confusion? Menu: the menus are bulky and rather large to use in a tiny space you're stuck in. Yet these menus are fun! Drink specials are offered daily -and I was surprised to even see a fish bowl menu, haven't seen fish bowls around in Mtl. I ended up ordering gummies on the beach with their 2$ off the candy bar menu on Thursdays. This drink was a twist on a sex on the beach with gummy bears that tasted oddly gelatinous because they were served chilled-(for 11$ it was an ok drink). The food menu was on the pricey side. Starting at 20$ on average going up to 40$ per main course. They specialize in American cuisine. I tried the ahi tuna tacos (4/5) for 22$ that came in 3 servings-i really enjoyed the flakey taco shell with the slaw and a genius slice of tuna-lightly grilled on the outside. For my main course: I had the short back beef ribs with Mac n cheese (3/5) the portion was very generous and presentation was beautiful. The meat was cooked super well, very tender, but the seasoning was a tad on the salty side. Whereas, the mac n cheese was a bit on the underseasoned side. The two served together didn't really jive well for me. I was glad to have tried it.Service: I wasn't too happy with the service we received, frankly because I felt rushed into ordering right away. I really appreciated the fact the servers knew the menu inside out, they were good with making recommendations -but a lot of the items from the drink menu were also missing. This was an eventful dining experience but for the 100$ I dropped I would've rather gone with a more upscale restaurant in old Montreal.  Overpriced meals for the quality of the food you get!"

Like any good diner, Deville's menu is huge (français à l'avant, English in the back), offering a variety of burgers, sandwiches, salads, pasta dishes, and a variety of desserts and shakes (yes, boozy ones, too).My go-to burger here is the Deville: two beef patties with cheddar, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, pickle chips, and their signature sauce, all stacked onto a very fresh, lightly grilled brioche bun that holds up to all that wonderfulness to the very last bite. The burgers are a blend of aged beef brisket, chuck, and short rib, a great combination that's absolutely delicious! The blend is what makes this burger special, a much better 'steak burger' than the ones served up by places like The Palm. The burger is accompanied by matchstick fries, and I appreciate that they're served in a small metal bowl - matchstick fries tend to lose their heat quickly, but the metal bowl help keeps them hot longer.Deville is right down the block from the Peel Metro station and a short walk from the Musée des beaux-arts on Sherbrooke. It's a perfect place for a low-key lunch when you're out and about exploring Centre-Ville, with something for everyone!"

I was watching all the waiters laughing at them calling them transgender and mocking one of the girls voices I was disgusted by this behaviour I called the guy over just to get him to stop talking and laughing about this girl. He came over I had a very angry looked on my face I figured he would pick up on it but no he didn't and went right back to the bar to laugh some more about the woman who left.Half the staff is standing around doing nothing 3 people at the door just playing on their phones 2 standing in the stair case 4 laughing at the bar. I don't know how that's acceptable.I would return but Probably not for a while.-UPDATE- spoke with social media manager and all was handled and taken care of in a professional manner very happy to hear.Update Decided to finaly come for lunch and try it out again. The waiter explained how only certain promotions u can get at the bar so we had to move our seat even tho nobody was in the place. The salad with the blue cheese is usually my thing decided why not try it again and I was extremely sick from it which I find weird because there's nothing much to it besides the blue cheese.

Service was fast and friendly, and was helpful for recommendations because they have a pretty expansive menu.They had a $40 a la carte deal going on, which gets you a starter, main, and dessert. Seriously worth it, considering the prices of the components.For starters, we got the fried mac and cheese wontons. You only get 3 things of it, which is not a lot at all, judging the price they sell it at. Also it was more like fried perogies, those were defo not wonton wrappers you guys. Delicious nonetheless.I got the ribs for the main, which came with coleslaw and a cornbread muffin. I was super satisfied with this dish, the slaw was delish, the ribs fell off the bone, and I couldn't even finish my fries. (Interesting fries btw, super thin, like chips)And for dessert we got the apple pie. Apples wrapped in pastry with ice cream on top ughhhh you honestly can't go wrong with that. All in all, the food was delicious and it was a great dining experience, but the prices were too high.

They went through renovations in the winter to make the place bigger and easier to move around. It looks beyond belief amazing! I really think they do what is best for their customers. The atmosphere is very friendly and pleasant!The service: one word: Spectacular. They always try their hardest to get you the best table possible even when its very crowded and they are amazing over the phone to reserve a table for me when I come down to the resto. I seriously think they're one of the best restos in terms of service.The food: Not the best but definitely beats many other mediocre places. Why I say not the best .. Their menu is great and creative it's just the execution is very poor. I sometimes get very dry overcooked meals. I don't think it's their fault. They can get super busy and not always have the food on point. Their trout, salmon, lamb which I've all ordered in the past came out a little too dry but the flavours are all their! Their coconut onion rings are delicious! Their chilli cheese steak spring-rolls are to die for.Their cocktails are so pretty and exotic! I always go for the Hawaii 5-0 cocktail. I tried their martini once. It was very strong so we know they are not cheap on the alcohol content! Hahaha. The best desert is their Beignet/ donuts! A little advice: Order them during your meal because it takes around 30minutes to have them freshly prepared. So when it comes out they are so warm and succulent. Overall, I love love love Deville and it's one of the most prettiest places I have been to and their service is TOP notch ! They always have the food on time with a smile! I totally recommend this dinner bar"
/user_details?userid=kubJ9q0g1L4IqjVCqyTtFw,Alex J.,"Washington, DC",3 star rating,"Fancified bar food in a Johnny Rockets meets Vegas with a dose of pink lighting setting.  Food is okay but some combinations didn't make much sense.  Prices are on the high side for the food served and I enjoyed the food I did get although I didn't find them better than what I got for lower prices in Bier Market near by.Lamb lollipops were good overall although they were a little burned and I could taste some charred bits that weren't pleasant. The giant steamed broccolis were well buttered and tasted fine, once you remember why we serve broccoli with the stem removed. Ribeye on Mac and Cheese gave me mixed feelings.  The ribeye was very tender but was on the bland side itself. The sauce only made it worse, completely overpowering the meat.  I still finished it but i won't order it again.TLDR: a decent fancified interpretation of American bar and diner foods but a little overpriced for what you actually get."

The meat was a bit dry but besides the burger was tasty and great. The grilled oignon was perfectly caramelized and had the right amount of spicy sauce to enjoy this burger.The pink light gives this restaurant a cozy aspect with its own signature.The place is clean and the lets not forget the good service we had. I would like to point out that the waitress was very respectful.

Yes they added more choices which is fantastic but they also added $$$$. (Maybe we are paying for their reno) This restaurant unfortunately can no longer be our regular place. Its quite ridiculous the prices. Not to mention charging for fountain drinks $3.50 no refills. And if you order appetizers...your bill will come out to minimun $50 for one person and thats not including dessert. Add another $15-18. I ordered one if the cheapest item which is the fish and chip sandwich. It was ok but not great. My husband orderd the koren fried chicken sandwich,  that was delicious. All in all if you have the bucks go for it. But quite disappointing when we saw the same food items we ordered two years ago go up by easily $10. I understand a few dollars but $10. That's crazy!"

My bf is somewhat of a picky eater so we have to manage both our styles. The menu here seemed to meet both our likings so we gave it a shot. The drinks to start were delicious. So many different funky options! Then we ordered the Salt & Pepper Calamari which was very tasty. This dish was a bit on the salty side, but when dipped in the sauce it really delicious. From here I was really having a hard time deciding on what to get for dinner. There were so many options I wanted to try. I decided to go another appetizer and a salad. My boyfriend got the Drive In burger and commented that it was juicy & the well put together. I went with The Blue Cheese Iceberg salad and the Southern Fried Buttermilk Chicken Crispers. Both were really good but I ended up loving the salad a little bit more. The chicken dish was the perfect balance of sweet & salty. The salad was huge for one, but soooo good. Just the right amount of everything on it. I would definitely not skip over this place if you're visiting Montreal. We will be back for sure!"

/user_details?userid=CgXv7VMU_rbobJaNi4wilA,James D.,"L'Île-Bizard, Canada",4 star rating,"An aesthetically pleasing restaurant, playing off the 50s diner theme. The tables are well spaced so there was no akward bumping into other guests, and seating was comfy. It took us a couple minutes to order because the menu is pretty big. We were brought the main menu, a specials menu, and a drink menu. The main menu consists of salads, burgers, pasta, and steaks. We started with the mac and cheese wontons. Five mac and cheese deep fried wontons served with marinara sauce on the side. I was afraid they would be too crispy to enjoy, but they were lightly fried. Nothing too exciting about the taste but I would not change anything.I was told Deville does burgers right so I asked our waiter for some options. He recommended the Circus burger (~$19): two beef patties, bourbon soaked pears, a dolop of caramelized onion marmalade, and brie cheese on brioche buns. The first bite introduced me to the juicy patties. Well seasoned. Every bite after brought me the sweet taste of pear, smoky marmalade, or both! I equally enjoyed the side of matchstick fries.My girlfriend ordered the Drive-in burger (~$16): two patties in a brioche bun, dressed with classic toppings. A very good burger but I think if you are going to Deville for a burger you should order something special. (there is a burger with cheese stuffed patties and more cheese on top!!).We did not order dessert because we had stuffed ourselves. The dessert options sounded great so we will be back for them!"

I had the mushroom burger (their vegetarian patty) and my boyfriend had the Fat Cat. Both were A+. The fries are the small shoelace fries and perfectly crispy/salty/soft.

However, when our burgers + fries came, I was not disappointed at all. The burger was juicy and the fries were definitely the star of the dish.

Well Deville Dinerbar definitely does.  It is reminiscent of an old 50's style diner but with a modern twist to include neon lights and all.  When we were seating at our table my wife and I were instantly talking about how the feel of the restaurant made us think of Elvis.  The look reminded us of a rock-a-billy style that was prominent back then.  The service was great, our server was quick with drinks and ensure they were never empty.  The food came out quick and was cooked the way we wanted.As for the food, I ordered a burger.  The Deville Burger to be exact.  It was a double patty burger with the Deville sauce. I figured if its named after the restaurant I couldn't go wrong.  Oh boy was I right, the burger came to the table and it lived up to the hype.  A tall oversized double patty burger that was sure to crush any hunger pains I may have.  Not only was it large, but it was delicious.  The meat was cooked very well and was just as juicy as you could ask for.  The Deville sauce was a delectable and welcome addition to the meal. The fires were fries.  Simple yes, but cooked very well and seasoned perfectly. Overall the Deville is a great spunky place for one to go if they are looking for an old school style restaurant with that modern fill.  The food is sure to please, both large in size and big in flavor."

The pasta was tossed in a lobster bisque sauce that just the right amount of sweetness and creaminess. The seafood on top was very fresh. It is 100% the best seared scallops I've ever had, and I am a huge seafoodie. All the seafood were perfectly cooked and was well seasoned. Also ordered the Seafood & Chorizo Paella. I've had many paellas in my life, this is by far my favorite. Again, it was topped with sizable tiger shrimps and the plump scallops. The rice wasn't too mushy and was full of flavor.

The sauce was delicious and the General Tao wasn't your typical General Tao chicken.  It was huge chunks of chicken and well seasoned.  Do you know those huge meatballs you get at Italian places?  It was like those, but I think there were somewhere around 7-10 pieces.  Each one was divine.  In addition to having all this chicken, the salad ingredients were fresh and I think it had some sprouts, those corn thingies, and other greens.  The portion size was equivalent to any entree you get at Cheescake Factory except this was so much tastier.  Verdict: If you like to drink, have quality food and large portions in a hip setting, this is a great place to go in Montreal."

The portions are generous and the food itself is always fresh and very tasty. One of my favourite items is the lobster BLT- loads of fresh lobster on a fresh bun with some crispy delicious bacon , you can't go wrong ! But their burgers are great too ! Their dessert selection is also very good , I had the pain perdu and it was perfection - my only word of caution, DO NOT attempt to eat the entire dessert yourself as the dessert portions are just as hearty as the meals !"

/user_details?userid=IT8xqEJGv62Uz2V87zTwLQ,Preeya M.,"Los Angeles, CA",1 star rating,"Where do I start.  First off, the food is good, but very overpriced. The service we received was TERRIBLE. If I could give a negative rating, I would. We showed up with a party of five people around 4:30pm, and were sat in the back corner around the wall. We did not see our waitress to put our drink order in for 20 minutes.  After we finally got our drinks, it took another 20 minutes for us to even lay eyes on our server who was actually taking the order of a couple who had arrived long AFTER we did. After she took the order and walked away without even looking at our table, a member of our table went to go ask the bartender if we could place an order. The waitress then showed up (this is now 45 minutes after taking our seats in an almost empty restaurant) and we explained the situation and how unhappy we were.  She basically said it wasn't her fault and it was shift change.  Fast forward 30 mins after getting our food. Waitress comes back and says she's spoken to her manger and he's offered us free dessert for our hardship. This didn't at all rectify the problem nor did the manager at any time come out on his own to speak with us, but free dessert is free dessert.  We begin placing dessert orders only to have the waitress come back a few minutes later to inform us that if it wasn't clear, she meant that the manger was offering the five of us ONE dessert. Sooooo - scratched all the dessert orders except one $8 milkshake.  Anyways, things don't ever bother me enough to write reviews, but this service was so incredibly horrible, I had to for-warn the next innocent victim.  GOOD LUCK."
/user_details?userid=8zXgNCkusOHMwh5Tj_8yCQ,Wing C.,"Pasadena, CA",5 star rating,"Wow. My fiance, soon to be brother-in-law, and I did not expect this place to blow us away or even leave a single lasting impression like it did last night! We came for a late dinner (we really overate our share of poutine in the afternoon) planning to only get 1 appetizer, 1 salad, and 1 dessert to share. We arrived around 9:30PM and this place was still jammed packed. We didn't have to wait long however (only about 5 mins) and they had a table on the second floor ready for us. As we were situated into our seats, I noticed this place had a nice mix of patrons  (couples on dates, group of girls getting ready for a night out, family with kids, bros just bro-ing it up). We were soon greeted by our amazing server (Sam). He was spot on from start to finish. He was quick to answer any questions we have with the menu and great in explaining all the specials + signature dishes. My soon brother in law has literally zero spice tolerance and Sam ensured his lasagna Diablo would not be a problem. In addition to the lasagna, we also went with their ahi tuna tacos (their most popular appetizer), Neptune tuna salad (I thought my body needed some green), and Big Easy beignets. On the menu, the beignets was listed as requiring about 30 mins to make. Sam personally went to the kitchen to check how busy it was, spoke to the chef, and let us know that they would only take about 20 mins at that time. When he served our tacos, salad, and lasagna, Sam remembered our beignets and asked if we would like them to be made now or wait until we were well into our entrees first. I thought it was so nice of him to checked on us and asked for our personal preferences. Our glasses were never empty (I think he personally came by to fill our water at least 6 times) and he asked and talked a little bit more about each of the dishes we ordered. The lasagna was unique with its crunchy fried battered exterior on top of a bed of fresh tomato marinara sauce. It was literally the size of my fiance's forearm! The taco had a nice sweetness in the center and a generous serving of ahi tuna in each. The Neptune tuna salad was the size of my head. Perfect texture with the edamame, hard boiled egg, cherry tomato, and crunchy green/cabbage. Initially we thought we didn't order enough food for the three of us - but thank goodness I stopped my fiance from ordering another entree. We were beyond stuffed before our beignets. But we thought - a few petite sized French donuts - totally manageable - until we saw the Chinese take out box they came in. 8 fist sized beignet  - perfectly coated with a light dust of powder sugar, crunchy on the outside with steam flowing out with every bite, and angel soft slightly gooey/melt in my mouth taste of heaven on the inside. They were served with house made caramel sauce and chocolate mousse. The mousse was nothing I've ever tasted before. This itself can be a signature dessert on its own. After I polished my beignets, I ate spoonful of the leftover mousse.  So light, so airy, can I just have a tub of this to go? The service was equivalent to a fine dining restaurant with at least 2 busboys + 1 main server. We must have left about 30% tip and it was worth every cent. The food yes is a bit expensive but the quality and quantity made it well worth it! The three of us couldn't help but leave this place with the biggest smile. Even though we way overate, there was not a single regret. Forget duck in a can or all the foie gras madness, Deville is a must eat for all the locals and visitors!"

He gave it a great review and after some serious contemplation I ordered it myself. Definitely have had better risotto. The scallops and shrimp were cooked perfectly. The staff was delightful. They provided a great white wine suggestion. Toward the end of the meal on the outdoor enclosed & heated deck, one of the staff was cleaning and discussing with our waiter that the broom wasn't working well.

/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Before I give extra details of my experience, let me start out by saying that I definitely have a love-hate relationship with this place. On one hand, I've had positive experiences food-wise all three times I've been here; however, it takes me quite a while to recover from the sticker shock that usually gives a bad blow to my wallet (I usually spend about ~$45 CAD in one sitting), leaving me to carry the weight of guilt on my shoulders caused by poor college student-isis. But, that doesn't mean I don't have anything good to say about it.There's not really much to be said about the decor that hasn't already been said - it's very swanky, in your face, and makes you feel a little more high-class than your average American diner. Offering some gourmet and ""dressed-up"" versions of American classics as well as international dishes with a twist, Deville at least lives up to their prices to some extent with their large portion sizes that are guaranteed to leave you in a food coma.For starters, this time I went with the strawberry milkshake and the cornbread cheddar jalapeño muffins.  (Normally I get one of the boozy milkshakes but since it wasn't a Sunday I stayed clear of it in order to not make my pockets go even more RIP). Upon sipping my milkshake, I was pretty sure I was directly transported to Cloud Nine because they really have this lightness about them that I love, and you can actually taste strawberry flavoring and it's not sickeningly sweet. I found the muffins to be extremely filling, and while they tasted good (the butter complimented them nicely), I didn't find them to be anything particularly special, and I was full after eating two despite not having eaten anything else that day. (Side note: the first time I came I split a Philly Cheesesteak Spring Rolls order with a friend and they were AMAZING, but at $16 I didn't want to risk it this time).I then went with the Porchetta Carbonara, and it came with a poached egg and sheets of Parmesan cheese on top. When I broke the egg, water started oozing out of the egg instead of the yolk and first, and I was slightly weirded out, but it didn't impact the pasta flavor negatively so I just went with it. The pasta's texture went really well with the cream sauce; however, the porchetta seemed slightly out of place in the dish. If it hadn't included the meat, it would have been a perfect dish.Does Deville Dinerbar live up to its promise of being ""The Next Evolutionary Step in Classic Diners?"" Probably not, considering that although the food is of higher quality as stated before, it's not high enough to completely justify the high prices that are more like $$$ rather than $$. I would rate this time about 3.5/5 overall, although my previous experiences were more like 4/5. If you want to impress your date or have a stylish night out on the town with your group of friends with good food included, then I recommend this place.*Also shoutout to the waiter who accepted my $100 bill and was able to get change for it after I have been trying to get rid of it forever! :)"

This salsa puts a twist on American Fried steak.the buttermilk cheesy potatoes were great. The biscuit was just okay, but the other two parts made it all worth it. As an American, I am used to choosing my own preference of how cooked I would like my steak, which is usually Medium Well. I learned in Montreal, you don't get to choose. They cook it just enough to be safe to eat. Cooking it just enough leaves it juicy, but still quite bloody. Visually it grossed me out, because I've never tried steak that was a little bloody inside, but it ended up tasting just fine.If I return to Montreal, I will be eating here again!"

This DUKE burger though. So big and good, especially being hungover from the night before. It was comprised of grilled flat iron steak, topped with cheddar & monterey jack, thick cut black forest bacon, fried onion strings, BBQ mayo and a fried egg on a brioche bun. If you think that doesn't sound good then you are stupid. The best burgers have a fried egg with yolk spilling out the sides, and this was no exception. The Chicken and waffles were pretty decent too, had a nice sweet syrup on it and the waffles were nice and fluffy. Chicken was aight, it's just deep fried chicken.This diner is also a bar and looked quite nice inside. Kind of a new school meets old school feel.

There's a reason this is their most popular dish.

But...My principal complaint which the Dinerbar could and should fix is that they have a large menu of mixed drinks...NONE of which cater to those men and whisky babes who like their drinks savory, spicy, and/or bitter. It is truly sad when the least sweet thing on the drink menu is the Margarita. And it wasn't as if there was a massive selection of stouts or porters or IPAs to lead me elsewhere.And since I was stuck with a Margarita and it was Cinco de Monday (so the tacos were 2 for $5) and the bartender recommended them I went for 2...and then 4. And they were passable...but not actually good in any real sense. Certainly no where near as good as the burgers, poutine, and other dishes I saw being feasted on to my left and right. So I ended up more than full with a drink for $20 after tax and tip - which must be a record for the Dinerbar. But I would never order that way again."

""It's a diner.....but hip""Now that I say it out loud, that's something your parents would say to describe a ""cool"" restaurant. But really, Deville Dinerbar manages to pull off a contemporary twist on the 80's retro diner with great service, sassy drinks, and damn-good food. The menu is beyond diverse and the drinks remind me of a neon-themed Hawaii 5-0.If I could visualize desribe the decor at Deville, it'd be a 1980's Animotion music video meets 2014 South Beach (well I guess it's now 2015 as I write this review). It's in a long, narrow space along Rue Stanley, split into two levels. We had made a reservation and we ended up with a perfect table on the edge of the upper level. Our mini-booth overlooked the neon excitement of the lower floor. Our server was an adorable young girl who we ended up chatting with for some time throughout our meal.We started off with a few cocktails for our evening of celebration. It was my 30th birthday and I knew right from the start that this was a great spot for a birthday celebration. We were in Hawaii several months back and I was reminiscent for a Mai Tai. They serve the Mai Tai in a coconut shell which was kinda cliche but cool. The Mai Tai was nice and slushy with good flavor. You would think there wasn't a drop of liquor in there it went down so easily. Dangerous! For my next drink I kept it simple with a glass of prosecco. For the appetizer, we opted for the Disco Poutine which looks quite plain when it first came out but then we started stirring. The center and middle of the bowl was loaded with gravy and cheese curd goodness!On the entree front, I opted for the Tempura Lasagna which our server seemed unsure about. She was concerned that ""it's very fried"" but that I'd like it if I enjoy fried foods. Well I'm from Dallas, the home of the State Fair of Texas and the capitol of fried foods! The lasagna was a thick slab of meat, pasta, and cheesy goodness, battered and fried tempura-style. It actually wasn't over-the-top fried and while not the healthiest dish, it was not as heavy as it sounds. Loved every bite!We capped off our meal with the bread pudding which was excellent like everything else. We continued the evening chatting with our server and the manager even stopped by. We really wanted a great meal and a fun atmosphere that night and it's exactly what we got. I highly recommend Deville Dinerbar and every bit of neon that comes with it!"

As expected, the inside looks great, love the rose color theme, everything looks fancy and classy. Our waiter was super nice (and handsome). Since I had a eye on this place for super long, I just went full out and ordered one appetizer, two mains, and one dessert. I shared the whole thing with a friend. - ahi tuna tacos: seriously the highlight of our meal. Really got surprised by how good it tastes. Quite original as well, since I never had sashimi tacos before. The sauce in the taco was sweet and the extra mayo sauce on the side went super well with the taco. They were generous with the tuna (for $22, they better be lool) and the platting was just so instagramable.- lobster btl: i thought it was impossible to go wrong with lobster, avocado, bacon but the burger was quite disappointing. Despite all the good ingredients i just felt like they just don't go well together. I'll say it was my least favorite.- bad girl pasta: ordered it based on the reviews on yelp. Maybe I was expectecting too much, but I was not blown away by the taste. The seafood were really fresh, especially the clams super huge, soft and chewy. There was part of the pasta that was clearly undercooked. Probably won't order again.- donuts: they wrote on the menu that we had to order the donuts 30min ahead, but since it was not a busu day the waiter said that its gonna be ready in 10. Its my first time having a desert that costs 18$, but actually its a fair price since it was enough to share for 4. We still managed to finish it all (We skip supper that day). Suuuper good. The donuts were hot and the chocolate mousse and the caramel sauce on the side were cold, perfect combo. The donut itself is not sweetened, so you have to eat it with the side sauce. My second favorite after the tacos. Overall, it is quite pricey, but their menu is original and the quality you get is kinda worth it. Anyways, come if you don't mind paying more just to feel extra fancy, coz with all the deco and awesome presentation you will."

I think charging $21 for meatloaf, for instance is a little excessive.It has that cool, hip, downtown vibe but the look reminded me a lot of the whole 1980s Patrick Nagel aesthetic (think the cover of Duran Duran's ""Rio"" album) especially with the neon pink lighting.The food was pretty good. I started with the cream of tomato soup and it was excellent. The meatloaf, while very filling and the portion was very generous, was a little too salty for my taste, I found.I don't see myself becoming a regular here unless I'm in a fix given that decent dining options in the downtown core are pretty limited."

You are paying for the location too! First of all, the decor and staff are stellar. Very attentive waiter who I believe was training someone. They gave us excellent service! I started with a Mai Tai and I am craving another one today. I would ditch serving it in a coconut just because it takes up too much space on the table and it loses it's cuteness about 3 minutes after you get it. Started with apps of wonton wrapped Mac and cheese. Excellent! I would go again just for this.  My 4 year old didn't care for it but she only wants KD Mac n cheese!Also had the chicken tenders on a waffle. I was not a fan but my husband was. I hate sauce, syrup, relishes it whatever and was expecting the maple syrup sauce on the side. Nope, it was all over making my waffle and tenders soggy before my fork hit it.Hubby and I spilt an inside out burger since we were so full. It's a burger. Not much to say about it. Wasn't bad and wasn't epic. Almost everything they serve is on a brioche bun so you better like that...Where I had a problem was that there was no posted child's menu and when the waiter told us the pasta options (butter or tomato sauce) I asked if we could add a single meat ball to the pasta and he said no. I ended up ordering her a 19$ plate to get meatballs and she barely touched it. Options for kids should be better as they are crazy picky eaters. I didn't want a free meatball, I wanted to pay for it but was told no. Also, we asked for a side of purple mustard and we got charged $2 for that... It's a small portion for that price!

It was pretty decent- more like a gourmet Big Mac with the Russian sauce and double patties. The lobster rolls and calamari were terrific. My husband ordered the Bad Girl pasta which I loved and had a good portion of seafood. My husband found the pasta a bit bland.

Meatloaf and hanger steak both came with a gigantic mountain of mashed potatoes. Our server was extremely cheerful and attentive. The disappointing part was actually the drinks - I got the black cherry lemonade that was recommended to me (also on the Hollywood cocktails list that are $2 off one Wednesday's) - had the artificial cherry taste. Overall a good dining place!"

We ended up sharing the el sloppy Jose burger and the maple-glazed rotisserie chicken. The burger was okay - it was a bit too salty and heavy for me, and I wish there had been some kind of fresh or pickled element to cut through the flavors from the meat and cheese sauce. The fries were great. The chicken dish was a really generous portion, and the standout was the amazing rice that it came with. All in all, a fun spot to get some comfort food."

Just a really really cool place to go and enjoy a delicious dinner. The first thing you notice, besides the very friendly hostess, is the vibe. Just inviting, ""glad you're here"" kinda thing. The menu, while based upon American fare, always has a twist. The names are great, the portions sizes are definitely first world problems to attend to; Huge. I've been on business travel, so comfort food hits the spot. And on their menu, which is loaded with comfort food, was a big ole plate of spaghetti and meatballs. Let me tell you, those balls of meat nearly made me explode. Huge, tasty, filling.... Aaaannndddd that could be a review for someone else in a different part of town... I joke, but the spaghetti and meatballs was so comforting, I nearly needed to be rolled out; and when I got back to my room, nothing but a euphoric carb crash. As for the rest of the menu, it has a little bit of everything. You cannot possibly go wrong. The wait staff are exceptional. They put up with a table full of 8 very type A management consultants, who'd just put in a 12 hour day. Fortunately, we thought we were hysterical and fun. I'm happy to say, so did the staff. The only complaint I have, that keeps this from being a 5th star is that it was just so crowded. Not a fault of the establishment by any means. It is a good problem to have, because I will go back there every time I am back in Montreal. Which looks like at least once a week for the next 3 months. Even though the place was packed, the wait staff were on the ball. No one in my party waited or went wanting for anything for long at all. The crowd was a solid mix of millennial's to people in their late 40's, early 50's. All co-habitating peacefully without clashing. :-) Don't miss out."

This place was too cute and very swanky for a diner bar, even the bathroom was cute. It was a two level restaurant and my friends were already seated at the top so we joined them. I read that you have to get the milkshake here which I did along with the lobster BLTA without the B. I'd have to say the marshmallow shake with nutella was delish and so was the sandwich as well.

Not a fine dining experience but the plates are definitely well composed. Club music plays in the background and makes for a young exuberant atmosphere. Ive been here on two separate occasions. Once for a bachelor party and once on a date with my girlfriend. Both excellent experiences. Our server was patient and responsive and unfazed even with our large group of 11. She didn't miss a single beat. Every order was met perfectly. And she had no problems with our request to split the bill. There's something to be said about the level of phenomenal service and that you get at most places in Montreal and this place is an exemplary example of that. You just don't have the same knowledgeable and well trained wait-staff here in the states, even in New York City. I digress. If you've read this far you've been more than kind. Go here.

It was launched by the same brothers behind the landmark Reubens deli and Anton & James cafeteria right across the street. That gave me a positive idea of the quality of food and service.At first I thought it was just one of those new fancy burger joints in town, but I've heard good things and like the idea of an upscale diner bar serving comfort food and gourmet meals. Menu is assorted, some interesting food pairings like phili steak spring rolls or mac and cheese wontons as appetizers. The Asian influence extends onto salads topped off with General Tao chicken but you'll find plenty of classic American dishes from meatloaf to burgers and shakes.I came here on a Tuesday evening around 5:30, expecting it to be dead but as we walked in, half the tables were reserved. Only later I figured out the busy night was due to a hockey game. I wish we could have been seated at a banquette because the top floor had really small tables and we were squeezed in next to other couples.Waiter was professional and helpful, right away, specials of the day were introduced. He made some good recommendations, accommodated us with substitutions or special requests. I opted for the cajun salmon, since I don't do spicy, I was afraid it was going to have too much of a kick but it was nicely seasoned and flavorful. Only downside were my under cooked carrots. My partner opted for prime ribs and their ""disco poutine"" which has a blend of monterrey jack and aged cheddar cheese on shoestring fries. My friend, a self-proclaimed ""poutine expert"", first mentioned the cheese looked like Cheez Whiz and tasted like Kraft Dinner. (Honestly,  he strikes me as a picky eater) I assured him Deville wouldn't dare incorporate such ingredients! Although the gravy could have been more generous, I found this americanized version of the poutine very tasty. We also got strawberry milkshakes, a simple diner staple done well. I would have loved to try more things on the menu, the prices just aren't very conducive to frequent visits.Btw, free wifi is cool! I was able to check in right away ;)"

Unfortunately, everything else missed the mark. This place is an overpriced tourist trap. The poutine wasn't horrible, but clearly frozen French fries and gravy out of a packet. For the main course, I ordered the bacon wrapped meatloaf, which the server recommended. Boy was she wrong. Can you say SALT much?! I couldn't even finish half of it because it was so salty, which I mentioned to the server. The manager came over to rectify the situation, which I was grateful for, however he proceeded to send MORE crap out to us instead of taking the meatloaf off of the bill. When I got the check - meatloaf and ""free"" dessert were still on the bill. At that point I just wanted out. Don't waste your time or money. There is a great place down the road called Dominion Square Tavern, go there instead."

(I can get American food anytime at home.) my friend found Dinerbar through yelp and the reviews convinced me to give it a try. The restaurant is super convenient to the Peel metro station. We arrived early (around 5:30) because we had not eaten since breakfast. We did not have reservations and the guy at the front said we could get a table but had to be out by 7:30. Perhaps this is when the uber-trendy hipsters arrive. No worries! Our server Nicholas was incredibly friendly, attentive, and made solid recommendations. In fact all of the servers in our area were pleasant. The seating was a bit tight, but so what! The food was outstanding. We started with the Philly Cheese Steak Spring Rolls. They were great. Perfectly executed with a side of what appeared to be cheeze whiz and balsamic. My friend tried to order the Shepherd's Pie but they were out that evening. So instead she ordered the lobster roll BLT. She reported it to be fantastic. I had the tempura fried lasagna. This is exactly what it sounds like but tastier. The portion was also huge. But not so big that we declined to look at the dessert menu. Nicholas suggested the Pan Perdu. I just had french toast for breakfast, but I am willing to follow suggestion. I am so glad I did. This was the best thing I ate that night. Overall we were very impressed and would not hesitate to come back."

Walking into the place, it reminded me of a futuristic diner, or like a Virgin America plane turned into a diner with pink lighting.I'd recommend coming with more than 2 people so that you can share a bunch of the appetizers - 4-6 people would probably be ideal. Between my coworker and I, we ordered 5 different appetizers / starters so we could try a little bit of everything. The portions here are generous - American sized, if you will.Best / Favorite Dishes:Bacon Wrapped Dog Sliders - Normally, something you'd buy on the street at 2 am after drinking, these are made fancier by turning them into sliders and putting them into toasted brioche buttered buns. They are delicious - I ate 2 out of the 3 of them and wanted more.Southern Fried Buttermilk Chicken Crispers - As if a belgian waffle and deep fried chicken weren't sinful enough, this is smothered with a maple syrup butter gravy that is both sweet and savory. Perfectly crispy and flavorful, this is some of the best fried chicken & waffles I've had.Beignets - These were also very delicious, but too much for 2 people to share - there were probably 8 or 9 of them. They were fresh and hot, and not overly fluffy like a donut hole, but not terribly dense either. Just right, dusted with powdered sugar and served with a chocolate mousse and honey dipping sauce. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.Just Ok:Fried Pickles - Good, but too much for 2 people. They were not necessarily mind-blowing, but not bad either.Ahi Tuna Tacos - I wanted to like these more, but the size of them were a little too big and hard to eat. The pieces of tuna were decently sized, and good, but there was too much of the won-ton shell and coleslaw that you weren't really able to get everything proportionally in one bite.Pass:Mini Lobster Rolls - I normally love lobster rolls, but this had too much mayo, and not enough big chunks of lobster dipped in butter.All in all, very inventive dishes. Definitely not a place to go to if you're on a diet. Don't come here and order a salad - go big or go home, and pick a bunch of not-so-good-for -appetizers to share with a large group of friends. You will feel stuffed when you leave, and you may have eaten half a stick of butter and lots of deep fried food, but it will satisfy your ""comfort food"" tooth for a while. I'd come back here again."

They have a very pink and purple retro decor and very vintage drinks and food. The menu is mostly southern inspired cuisine, but with a twist. The must have here is their short-ribs. The portion of the meat is huge, tender and easily broken apart with a fork, served on parpadelles. Their seafood pasta is very good but I find it too heavy. You must also try their tuna tacos as an appetizer. My second time there we planned a surprise birthday party in the back. The staff was very coorporative and understanding."

It was appropriate and fun.Decor : I would describe it as a modern diner - if those two words can even be put together. Very clean and nicely decorated.CONS : I don't care so much for prices, but must mention that I was charged an extra 2$ for more spicy ketchup. I mean, we ordered two full meals + appetizers + alcohol. I mean really? I just thought it was a really petty thing to do and would suggest the owners to not do that if customers order meals and alcohol. Really petty."

They only have one dish of poutine - and that's disco poutine. Unless there are other ones that I totally overlooked. I ordered the black cherry lemonade for a drink ( this alcoholic drink )The store is modern and clean inside with tall ceilings and large windows. Black, pink, silver is the main color scheme. The hostess is a beautiful and tall young woman. And the waiter guys aren't bad to look at either. They are sweet enough to come up and introduce the new server if the other is ending his shift.I didn't realize that the disco poutine would be such a large dish till it came. I honestly didn't know if I was supposed to eat it with my hands, or a fork. In the end I didn't finish it and had to pack up more than half of it to go. I liked my drink - but I don't feel like I loved it - it's all that I can say about that. Although I went around 3 and there were not that many people in the restaurant, it took them a while to notice me as I stared at the waitress, bartender, server to get the bill to pay and leave. The server did apologize when he came over to give me the bill and quickly doggy bagged my food to go.Besides that I have nothing really bad to say about this place. The food is pricey but because it's good it makes up for that. I will go back, maybe with more people, just so I can eat more of the variety of dishes they have to offer. Delicious!"

Second the appetizers of many were larger than main meal. For Example my chicken waffle were almost bigger than my main plate which was tasty but a bit underwhelming after having the amazing Chicken Waffles. My Filet Mignon with a big Portebello top and some sauce and some greens and that was it. It felt like a big empty plates.

My French leaves me in the dark at many places.I came in off a flight at 4:30ish on a Monday. There were 8-10 other patrons which was a relief. Reading the descriptions I was curious about the decor, and still am a little curious. It was a cross between a Miami nightclub and a truck stop diner.My server was attentive and gave me many tips. I ended up going with the Poutine and the LobsterBLT. They were phenomenal. The sandwich was on a seaseme/poppy seed bun. As exactly as described it was a hybrid lobster roll and BLT. Well done chef. My beef is with the fact that I was not told that by ordering the poutine and sandwich I was getting double the fries and charged twice as much. No big deal. That is until I was asked why I didn't just upgrade the fries for a small up charge. I was never told it was an option.All in all great food, interesting decor, and really worth what I paid.

Good, but not 'WOW I LOVE THIS.'Lobster BLTA (lobster salad, bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado, purple mustard on a brioche bun).

The decor deserves 5 stars itself . It's gorgeous but it's really small. You cannot get in without reservations on the weekends. We waited over an hour because we didn't know this. They basically turned us away and as we were walking down the street, the hostess chased after us to let us know she found a seat. THAT was awesome of her. There's really no waiting area except a small front entrance so on a really cold day, it's not ideal to wait . The menu was very interesting. Had alot of new things I never seen but decided just to have a burger. It was decent. It was a little too much bigger if there's such a thing. It was just too dry . My boyfriend loves his chicken tho. It was little over priced for the food that you get. And if you are looking for a quiet atmosphere, this is NOT it. It's super loud and everyone is literally sitting right next to each other, you can barely hold a conversation. It's very tight and you will run into a fast moving waiter if you aren't careful.

So even though we wanted to order a bunch of apps and share everything, we had to order specific apps that would qualify as ""enough"" food for an entree. So strange. Being from NJ I have never heard of such a thing but we went with it and the experience was still really great. We had the Philly Cheesesteak spring rolls, mac and cheese won tons, soul lettuce wraps, calamari, and the pasta with pulled lamb. All tasted fresh and had a great amount of flavor. We also shared the fried french toast dessert which was awesome. Everyone also seemed to really enjoy the cocktails. I had the specialty mojito for $12.Overall I would definitely recommend this place for a laid back dinner with friends."

/user_details?userid=WA9fjdFYyWon5ecMRUrJRg,Robert K.,"Milford, CT",4 star rating,"This is a great stop in downtown. I have mixed feelings on the decor. It has a sort of futuristic-80's look to it. Lots of chrome and glowing overhangs. But it's certainly different. Service was great, some of the friendliest we've had in the area. Food-wise, all good. This is upscale diner food done really well. The ribs were fantastic, and sandwiches are MASSIVE. Overall, prices are on the high side - but portions are huge.  Special props to the Louis' Lunch menu item. Respect."
/user_details?userid=1XANyLruTMqMCYelC8qBig,Emilia S.,"San Mateo, CA",4 star rating,The name is deceiving because this restaurant is more diner themed than an actual diner. The food is far more upscale than you'd imagine. Any dish with the rotisserie chicken is fab but the macho salad is a perfect lunch pick; even the lunch size is massive and the flavors mix very well. Sizable menu for all meals of the day so you're sure to find something!

The Mac and cheese wontons were crunchy and cheesy with a perfect, kicking dipping sauce. The house made chips came with a three cheese dip that was to die for. The drinks were also a highlight. I had a Pop Rock Star that had pop rocks in it that exploded in the drink. It was such a cool experience. I had the Duke which was a great sandwich but I especially loved the bacon on it. Not a single item at our table was just ""okay"". The service was fast and friendly especially during a busy time and a big party such as ours!"

/user_details?userid=-_2h2cJlBOWAYrfplMU-Cg,Billy K.,"Philadelphia, PA",3 star rating,"Interesting concept - half bar & half old school diner. The decor / atmosphere is very much bar / club but the menu is 100% diner (but with some interesting twists). Service was very good. We walked in on a Saturday night at 10pm and seated immediately, without a reservation. The restaurant was probably 90% full at that time. They have an interesting range of cocktails & martinis. Beer selection was a major disappointment - only Coors, Molson and Rickards on tap. They have a custom house beer served in a bottle called ""Deville Blonde Ale"" which was OK. Given the range awesome Quebec craft beers, the selection needs to be expanded. Also a decent wine selection.Food portions were humungous, probably too big (and I have a big appetite). Prices were above average but ultimately fair given the portion size and setting. These dishes can be split into 2-3 meals.          We started with the deep fried dill pickles - a total disappointment. They were clearly over fried or refried a way too many times. Yuck! The table next to us ordered the Ahi sashimi taco app which looked amazing.I ordered the Meat Loaf plate. They used a combo of Veal, Beef and Pork with aged cheddar cheese in the middle. The loaf was wrapped in bacon. It was probably the best meatloaf I ever had in a restaurant (but not as good as my mom's). It was served with mashed potatoes, carrots and asparagus. Also included a mushroom & truffle ragu which was a little too salty. A good dish overall.My companion ordered the Fat Cat burger which again was ridiculously large. There was no way to eat the burger ""as is"". It's served on a large brioche bun with two burgers, ribs, cheddar and a root beer house mayo sauce. Ribs were a little fatty but the burger was A-OK. A large order of fries were served on the side.Not sure I would return very often as the food is very unhealthy and the portions super sized... but if you have a craving for comfort food in a night club setting, give it a try.BK"

The atmosphere is energetic, but not so much as to be a distraction.  Service was excellent throughout, from the moment we arrived until we bid a good night. Penny was our primary server and she met our every need, even anticipating a few. The staff works well as a team and contribute a great deal to the successful operation of Deville.The front room has the main bar and some tables. The back of the restaurant is up a half flight of stairs.  The kitchen is half a flight down and you can get a good view of the action as you go to your table.The decor is delightful - modern diner elements are tastefully merged into a comfortable and vibrant atmosphere. The menu is based on traditional diner comfort food, but often with a modern touch.  Being in Montreal, we had to try the Disco Poutine. The fries were hot, thin, and crispy and the Disco gravy paired very well for this variation. I had a burger with cheese and bacon. The sandwich was of considerable size and I had to resort to fork and knife halfway through. My friend had the hanger steak special and it was majestically presented on a wood butcher block with an impressive mashed potato side.  He was quite impressed with the taste and quality of the steak.As a treat, I ordered a strawberry shake (or frappe as we call it in New England). Very well-made and flavorful. It was presented in a traditional style ice cream fountain glass complete with a metal frame handle. Thank you, Penny & staff, for a delightful evening."

Sign me up!This place is cool & funky inside, somewhat like an old fashioned diner, but more dark like a bar. So, yeah, it's a dinerbar.I came here with a fellow out-of-town co-worker, who actually picked this place, for dinner on a week night. Even though we got there relatively early, the place was pretty busy. We were able to get a table without waiting though. In the section we were in they do pack in the tables a little more tightly than I like, so don't come here planning to have a private, intimate convo.The waitress was very nice and helpful and our service was generally great. I started with a cocktail, specifically a martini which was $2 off that night (Wednesday). It was big and delicious, just the way I like them. (Confession: I like girly martinis, not ""real"" martinis...don't judge me!) The crowd here trended toward a younger, more attractive set, but they still let me in.The food was also excellent. I started with their tomato soup, which was (as the waitress warned me) a tad spicy but very tasty. The Dinerbar Club sandwich was HUGE and delicious. The chicken had a wonderful smoked flavor, and it was piled with bacon and avocado, which are two of my favorite things things on sandwiches. The parmesan grilled corn on the cob ($2 upcharge to sub for fries) was also great. Really, not a single complaint in the quantity or taste of my food. My co-worker had the meatloaf, which he described as ""amazing"", I believe.My one complaint would be that it's a little pricey for what you get, for which I deduct 1/2 star.

My sister did the ordering, we had the Tuna taco's and the philly cheese steak spring rolls.  When the plates came everything looked delicious. We decided to start with the fresh, melt in your mouth but messy taco's. I could have eaten all three myself and been satisfied! The sauce complimented the dish perfectly. My only complaint is how expensive it was. Man, an 18$ appetizer is just madness.The philly cheese steak spring rolls were the decadent opposite of the Tuna. The meat was tender and tasty, the rolls are crispy, and the cheese sauce was ok. All in all it was a great lunch, it also helped that is was my sister's treat!

Overall we were happy with the food, wish we had the appetite to try more stuff. Cons - it is a little bit on the pricey side, however, I would say it is mostly worth it. Also, we had called and made a reservation and repeatedly said what time we wanted, although upon arrival they could not find our name on the reservation list. We were then told basically how we were wrong and missed the reservation, even though we said like 8 times which time slot we wanted and someone put it in the computer wrong. Not a big deal just a bit surprising, maybe their customer service is slightly lacking or it was an off night. We were seated right away no problem though. Lastly, it is also very loud during peak hours so maybe consider going when it is less busy."

The HUGH coconut onion rings, and the cocktails in fish bowl are amazing. We ordered the lamb pasta and the bad girl pasta( seafood pasta). It's unusual to see the lamb pasta, so we decided to give to try, the bad girl pasta is little bit spice and come with Large prawns and collapses. Always good for NEW people to try."
/user_details?userid=cqgjW23FJyu5kFlRDN1CpQ,Rawan K.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"This place amazes me (as well as my palate) more and more. I honestly think I could eat here on a regular basis and never get bored. I had the same waiter as I did last time and he remembered me. What an awesome guy, Deville certainly has exceptional service! He even hooked me up with a mouthgasm milkshake, officially known as a chocolate-nutella milkshake topped with roasted marshmellows. Seriously, a piece of heaven in your mouth. I'm in love!Today's orders consisted of: 1) Ahi Tuna Tacos, made from fried wonton shells and an Asian slaw stuffing, topped with seared tuna slices and a fantastic wasabi lime aioli on the side.- Seared just right this time around, and words can't describe how perfect it was. It's technically an appetizer, but they fill you up just right so you don't feel overly full and heavy.2) Blackened Cajun Salmon, served over fire roasted pablano rice, ratatouille, and topped with a roasted corn salsa.- Juicy, well seared, and spiced marvelously. Even the fire roasted pablano rice and roasted corn salsa added an extra special touch, giving all your senses quite the joyride. 3) Fat Cat Burger, made up of a beef patty, as well as pulled BBQ beef ribs, aged white cheddar, shredded iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, grilled red onions, and a root beer BBQ mayo on a toasted brioche bun, with delicious matchstick fries on the side.- Large and fully loaded, definitely difficult to finish, but more delicious with every bite. The only issue here was that the beef patty was tasteless on its own and required seasoning, but at least now there was one less meat to worry about eating. The rest of the burger was great and the root beer BBQ mayo made it that much greater.4) Southern Fried Chicken Salad, a large bowl of mixed greens, topped with fried buttermilk chicken crispers, bacon, red onions, bell peppers, corn kernels, julienned carrots, grape tomatoes, shredded monterey jack and cheddar cheese, and sweet waffle croutons, tossed in a bourbon pear dressing. - Very tasty and enjoyable 'til the last bite. The buttermilk added more flavour and moisture to the chicken, making it more rich and juicy. The veggies came fresh, and the variety of toppings kept your taste buds hungry for more.Each and every one of us enjoyed every single bite of our meals. Not only do they taste so good, but they look so good, it almost feels sinful having to tear it all apart. But you easily get over that! :PUntil we meet again, my new found love."

Service was attentive and friendly as well, which was a plus.  Previously we came in the winter and sat downstairs, which was a little nicer and less jam packed.  Obviously more busy in the summer, we got sat upstairs, and it definitely was a little on the toasty side with all the people and too few BTUs from the AC, but the water was quickly refilled and we survived fine.  After this latest visit, Deville Dinerbar has officially earned the highest distinction of being a place we will regularly visit on each of our yearly trips to Montreal.  Bring on the hot pink!"

To top off this great burger, the place had a great fun drink menu. Now the best goes for last - one guest got the tuna salad and it was incredible! I hate salads and I have no idea what craftsmanship went into it, but it was perfect! You have to try it if you go. The greens went perfect with the tuna and it was perfectly seared. Nice spot!

It's a diner except every dish has a unique twist to it. The hostess was super sweet and allowed us to choose our table. This place has really cool drinks and places their cocktails in cool cups that look amazing pictures. We ordered a Mojito, a Maithai, a chicken salad, and a cobb salad. The drinks were too sweet so we couldn't finish it. I thought the chicken salad was delicious with the perfect mix of ingredients (avocado, spinach, rotisserie chicken, etc.) The house dressing was delicious too.

/user_details?userid=1ViT_LzrNbbrheWgIvT5Tw,Wes N.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Atmosphere, Service, Food - the essentialsAtmosphere: DeVille Dinerbar is a new edition to the flock of trendy cafes / dinners on Stanley street.  Unfortunately however, DeVille as a late comer - gives off the air of trying too hard, and borders on the pretentious.  It is themed to look like a trendy 60's dinner - but goes overboard with the usage of cliche and tried props like pink neon, semi-circular booths, and the menu printed on the walls (look for spelling mistakes!).  It could be a good place to have a business dinner though. Service:  For a place that aspires to attract the young and hip as well as the old and established - DeVille does not do a very good job at grooming their waiters and waitresses very well in the art of service.  The staff, it seems, has been plundered from various other places, perhaps with the lure of a higher pay-cheque, and as such do not have any connection to the place.  Although the service is polite and pleasant, mistakes are not out of the question.Food:  Perhaps, DeVille's fatal flaw.  The food is nothing to write home about, and at the prices listed, they are in no way shape or form enticing enough to come back to.  Since the menu, contains lots (lots) of items, in many categories, choosing the right meal frustratingly difficult. The fact that every dish has a pretentious (there's that word again) name, is also a drag.Wants to be cool - but ends up trying too hard."

Our bartender was super sweet and suggested things for us to do for the rest of our time in town.

It didn't bother me though and I thought the restaurant had a fun vibe because of it.My family of 6 ordered a variety of food for dinner. I think between the table we tried the lamb, salmon, meatloaf, shepherd's pie, the mac and cheese wontons and the mini bacon-wrapped hot dog sliders. I personally ordered the shepherd's pie, it was different than your average shepherd's pie as it had a light croissant crust on top, but it was nice comfort food. I think everyone else liked their food as well besides the mac and cheese wontons, which my sister said could have used a sharper cheese and weren't very flavorful.Prices are on the higher end I thought but the portions are large.

The food is even more.The restaurant features some of the foods we like best, and especially comfort foods, in a more upscale and innovative way that did not just tantalize the eyes or impress me with the inventiveness but in a way that was wholly satisfying. After a lot of deliberation over the menu, where everything from fried chicken to grilled salmon sounded perfect, I chose the General Tso salad. The salad came in a very large bowl of spinach or greens and with toppings typical of a Chinese chicken salad at most any restaurant -- expect it was topped with ginormous chunks of freshly breaded General Tso chicken. The chicken was moist and served in large portions, but not overly glazed in sugary sauce or grease. My friend also enjoyed another salad that was loaded with healthy fruits, nuts and vegetables. My mint cocktail also was excellent.What a great place with a fun vibe and good food. A must in Montreal."

The Ahi Tuna Tacos were out of this world, just enough dressing, nice crispy shells, and plenty of fresh ahi tuna. The Mac & Cheese however left something to be desired, to me it was just too much cheese for the amount of mac, and a weird mix of cheeses. Our waiter suggested a great beer, my husband had a special of rib eye with dungeness crab over polenta, which he really enjoyed. We finished our meal with an order of Pain Perdu, which was just delicious!  I would definitely come here again if I'm back in town."

Short walk from our hotel, and with a very eclectic menu. My kids each had the mushroom veggie burger, which was fantastic. Also had egg and Parmesan cheese, what a treat. Matchstick french fries were fresh and very good. My wife had the fish and chips sandwich or just excellent. Both the buns on the burger and the fish sandwich were wonderful. Very fresh with poppy seeds. I had the tuna with a popcorn across. Sounds crazy, but it works, adding just a little bit of sweetness. The kale Waldorf salad was excellent, A great accompaniment to the tuna. Combined with very good service, a great experience.  The only thing that disappointed me was that they would not let me substitute the risotto with a vegetable without an additional charge. But other than that very good place and I will definitely come back too."

The lovely ladies behind the bar were very attentive and helpful.  They really made the experience special.  The food was always excellent and the drinks were delicious.  The atmosphere was really lively and fun.  They also have a roof top patio when the weather permits.
/user_details?userid=FVofQsn1dhdFx1ELlve1Kw,Cecilia H.,"Laval, Canada",3 star rating,"I'm disappointed that my very first review on yelp had to be a bad one...was saving it for something special. I went to get a takeout since I was craving Mac and Cheese and I've heard good things about this place... and mostly because midterms made me too tired and lazy to whip out a box of kraft diner. The interior design of this place is great, very dynamic and looked like a perfect place to throw a birthday party. Staffs were friendly and the place had a good vibe. Since I went there around noon I was given the lunch menu.  I mainly went there for the Mac and cheese but I also wanted to know what the hype was all about. I ordered the Maple glazed rotisserie chicken which came with poblano rice an aji Amarillo sauce. The chicken (1/2 of a whole chicken) didn't taste very special, it was meh and more importantly was very dry... I expected the breast to be dry but for the thigh to be dry as well... didn't see that coming at all considering that the meal was 21$ I've had grocery store made roast chicken more tender than this and for only half the price. The rice was ok, nothing special about it. I think what I enjoyed the most was the sauce. Yup, just the sauce (was good sauce by the way). Atleast the Mac and cheese was good, not as good as the one from Robin Square but good. Final say:Food is okay, nothing special but for the price you could go elsewhere. My review is only based on what I had but maybe their other meals are far better?1 star for good interior design and ambiance.1 star for friendly and dynamic staff.1 star for yummy sauce and Mac and cheese."
/user_details?userid=uHmvLnQ2YDZFi7gMljZ7aw,Ver C.,"Portland, ME",4 star rating,"Checked out this restaurant during our stay in Montreal which is the sister to Reuben's, also in the same vicinity. This new place must have just gone in recently because it was not here when we visited over a year ago. Overall the vibe of this place is definitely a bit hipster meets 1950's diner (chrome and all). There was a little bit of a wait when we got there but we didn't mind at all. We were seated in probably 10 minutes or so which was quicker than we expected. Our waiter was awesome and when asked, even informed us of the ""best"" choices on the menu. From what I could see, much of the menu consisted of sandwiches, expensive steaks, a few fish choices, burgers, and salads. First my fiance and I ordered the ""wontons filled with macaroni"" which were awesome. Very cheesy and came with a marinara dip on the side which I didn't use much. I ended up ordering the ""hot pulled chicken sandwich"" which personally, I thought was blegh. For being a ""hot"" sandwich, it wasn't hot at all. There was also a good portion of dark meat in the sandwich that I didn't eat (not a dark meat fan). My fiance ordered the ""brisket sandwich"" which he said was amazing and ate completely. Besides our food, we both got mixed drinks that I thought were a bit overpriced ($11+ a piece). Mine in particular tasted very syrupy and left a coating of sugar on my teeth. This is mainly why I don't drink mixed drinks that often anymore.So overall I would say this place is neat and has a vibe all on it's own. I'm mainly giving this place 4 stars for the service, wonton appetizers, and decor. My food wasn't really the best and I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Maybe if we visit this place again in the future, I might have a different experience with the main course."

/user_details?userid=E68ZPVpcuWhxvnjq8vTqAA,Tom Y.,"Pittsburgh, PA",4 star rating,"Retro-American Diner with attitude and class.  This place has all the classics like burgers, meatloaf, and pot pie, but I was really hungry so I went straight for the prime rib, the big boy cut.  Let's back up a bit, this place looks really classy, we are in downtown YUL by the way.  The decor is super modern with a retro flair and this attitude falls into the food as well.  When you first walk in there is a bar to your left that shows off the drinks available and the bartenders that are ready to deal out some drinks.Now back to the food, the prime rib entree was large, like really big.  Normal humans should split this meal if you are getting the larger cut or you have your next meal waiting for you.  The prime rib was prepared, pink and slightly red in the middle, the outside had a slight crust/bark on it and it was heavenly.  The drinks expertly prepared by the awesome bartenders were on point as well.The only downside of this place is walking out of there a little poorer than I walked in."
/user_details?userid=fhNSa1szPhXYvtcGzPXLiw,Dennis N.,"Markham, Canada",5 star rating,"If you have never been to Montreal before and were looking for a place to eat, then you could look no further than going to Deville Dinerbar.  Although many people will say that some of the best restaurants are located in old Montreal, this restaurant is actually located in the heart of downtown Montreal and is steps away from many of the hotels that are located nearby.  Deville Dinerbar provides a mix combination of classic dinners and contemporary food in a fusion type manner.We went with a variety of dishes that evening so that we could eat and share amongst all of us.  For starters we went with the Steak and Gaufrettes, Salade Neptune au Thon Ahi, Le Jarret D'Agneau, Poisson Frais Du jour, Lettuce Tacos, and Le Burger Deville.  For the non speaking French people, I will translate the choices as I go along. The Steak and Gaufrettes is quite simply steak and fries.  Now truthfully I have eaten many, many steaks before but this steak here was quite amazing.  It was a little fattening in the centre and along the edges but it was juicy fattening and although on the picture the steak looked like it was burnt, the steak was just seared perfectly.  I really couldn't tell what made this steak so good but often at times, even at medium rare, we find the steak to be a little chewy.  This one was very tender, very soft and very juicy despite, quite frankly, a lack of noticeable sauces or juices on the plate.  Sprinkled with some black pepper and some cherry tomatoes on the side and I have to say this steak was one of the best steaks I have had in quite some time.  Even their fries felt different as they were sliced very thin yet they were still nice and hard on the outside and nice and soft on the inside.  It was an excellent dish and one that I would highly, highly recommend. The Burger Deville or their signature burger was huge.  It was like a double decker burger with a couple of patties mixed with some cheese, lettuce and tomatoes in the middle.  I took a side shot of the burger and the mountain of fries beside a drink just to give you an idea as to how big this burger was.  For an extremely hungry person, this burger is definitely for you.  The person who ordered it was quite satisfied with the burger and needless to say quite full afterwards. One of my other friends ordered the Korean style lettuce wrap.  This wrap was quite amazing in taste, texture and style.  The only draw back was that there was only like 4 pieces of lettuce to go with the meat mixture.  Honestly I could not tell you exactly what was in this meat sauce mixture but whatever it was it was pretty damn good.  The mixture of pork, kimchi and green onions was a smashing hit and something everyone should give it a try. The Salade Neptune au Thon Ahi or Ahi Tuna salad was personally my favorite.  The amount of salad that one gets from this order though was ridiculously astronomical.  I know this sounds weird but there must have been a month's worth of salad hidden underneath the dozen pieces of ahi tuna.  The fish was amazing but the salad itself was just incredible.  The problem was that there was just way too much of this stuff.  One large bowl of salad was hidden underneath the fish and for one single person to eat all of that I think would be just too much.  If you do choose to order this salad, you will almost most definitely end up sharing amongst all of your friends who are there. The Poisson Frais Du jour or the fish of the day arrived with what looked like cranberry sauce and mash potatoes sandwiching the fish.  The fish appeared to be halibut in nature although I am not able to confirm if that was the case or not.  The fish was very good according to the person who ordered it.  I did not taste this particular dish but from all accounts purpose, it appeared to be above average, tasty and filling. Le Jarret D'Agneau or the braised lamb shank was the last thing on our table and it too was quite amazing.  There was a definite strong after taste of the lamb but what really impressed me the most was just how juicy the meat was and how the meat literally fell right off the bone.  The gravy sauce was just perfect and the meat was a tad bit fattening but overall it was still an amazing piece of meat.  There were also some vegetables and a large wad of mash potatoes that came with the lamb.  This is a must try dish for any lamb lovers out there. Overall, I found this place to be a very cool place to eat.  They had live television going on and two floors of tables to get all of their patrons in.  The staff was great and the food was amazing all around.  I couldn't tell you the costs of each item as I didn't cover the bill that evening but it was quite reasonable if I recall. If you are ever in the Montreal area, definitely drop in and have a go at it.  I don't think you will be disappointed."

Oddly enough it was the bacon that left me most unenthused in the meal. The meatloaf was tasty, the mashed potatoes were great and plentiful, the root vegetables accompanying were perfectly cooked yet crispy, and the gravy was rich and tasty. But the bacon, just seemed thin and less notable of the flavours.Still, washed down with a pint of Creemore beer while listening to the sweet sounds of funk and soul in the background, I couldn't help but enjoy my dining experience.

Actually I don't haveany negatives except that it can be very busy and hectic. However, I'm sure their awesome managers will be able to satisfy any of your inconvenient or arisen problem.They also have a terrace, which is definitely a major plus!Honestly, one of the few spots which I can allow myself to give 5 stars. Moreover, in terms of price, Deville is not as expensive as one ought to believe. For around, 25$ you will most likely enjoy their grandiose meal and experience in this hip restaurant.One can also choose to download their app and choose their own music from a selected playlist? How amazing is that ... Although , the lineup for songs can be pretty intense especially during the summer.As for the food, fair warning , PORTIONS ARE GIGANTESQUE. I've tried both their lunches and dinners, both are excellent!!During lunch hours , you can choose a meal from a selected country of the week. This allows you to discover other meals from deville that is inside their regular menu , I definitely recommend to try it. As for the selections inside their menu, I can't talk for everyone of them, but for the ones I've taken , I've never been disappointed. Their burger is excellent, just dry and seasoned enough to give you a melting burger taste inside your mouth within 5 seconds. Their general Tao salad is an excellent low carb choice that will fill anybody's tummy. Lastly, my favourite, the dinner bar club is HUGEEE and it's taste and unique and will probably prompt you to book another date with this restaurant, I, myself cannot describe how amazing it was ... Thus , I highly recommend for Yelpers to try it :) A vast selection of their meals come with fries. Personally, fries are one of my favourite food, and I can say that deville does not disappoint in that area-- miniature but extremely tasty.Any who, if you are still reading this, I can argue that deville is a special amazing restaurant that Montreal has to offer and usually one will be delighted to be part of such an amazing experience."

This time around though, my girlfriend and I only came here to eat, we ordered the philly cheesesteak spring rolls to start, which were pretty good. We both ordered burgers because their menu boasted how ""Good and natural"" their burger are, in my opinion they need to season their patties. The burgers tasted bland kind of like those cheap frozen burgers you buy at the supermarket, with no seasoning. The mashed potatoes were mediocre at best, tasted like they came from those powdered boxes, the french fries though were better than average, but nothing out of this world. My girlfriend had the black label burger and I had the Fat Cat burger, i just feel that with all the burger hype on their menu, they didn't hit the mark for me.

Without a doubt, this restaurant was catered towards 20-40 something females, with neon pink lighting mixed in with chrome details. The drinks come in a variety of ""fun"" containers, such as a carved coconut or intricate glasses. The whole place looks like retro, but not real retro; more like an Andy-Warhol-esque interior designer's definition of it. The food was pricy but came in abundant quantities. The matchstick fries are the item that stood out, as it is rare to see them house-made.I had the lunch special, the fish, which came elegantly plated with some vegetables. They seem to have a special theme for the lunch, and the day I went was Swedish. The menu items description oddly sounded like an Ikea menu and so I abstained from that option.Overall, good food but you are definitely paying for their central downtown location. It's on the pricy side for a student budget, without the wow-factor that would make me comeback for more."

I would definitely return to try out many more offerings from the menu though."

Great atmosphere. Excellent and friendly service. And the food was awesome! We started with the crispy mac and cheese stuffed wontons with a side of Diablo marinara sauce. They were perfect. The sauce has just enough of a kick to make it stand out from your average marinara. And the mac and cheese in the wontons was as close as you can get to Southern Comfort Food in Canada. I had the Bacon Weaved Meat Loaf which is a combination of Veal, Pork and Beef in a Bacon Weaved Wrap Stuffed with Quebec Aged Cheddar and Oven Roasted. With Mashed Potatoes and Truffled Mushroom Ragu. Probably the best meatloaf I've ever had and that mushroom ragu is killer. My friend had the Bad Girl Pasta which is fresh Mussels, Diver Scallops, Baby Clams & Black Tiger Shrimp, Sautéed in a Chiptole Lobster Bisque with Linguini Egg Pasta. Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Plate went back clean. We sat on the outside terrace but we would've been fine inside too. The décor is funky and pink. Not a cheap break but will worth the cost. I highly recommend a stop if you live there or if your visiting. Enjoy."

I ordered the vegan lentil burger, which consisted of fresh, grilled eggplant, red bell peppers and asparagus. I was pleasantly surprised that it was served on a portobello mushroom ""bun."" It was served with shoestring fries, which didn't have any special seasoning, but their simplicity is what made them so enjoyable.I really enjoy trendy restaurants that serve upbeat, healthier takes on classic foods.

/user_details?userid=FuW1EwnbQoHyDMeOGrljsg,Khanh L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The place looks like a fifties diner,For a diner, it is quite pricey. The cocktails range from 12-16$!!! my you'd have to be drunk already to order that... we ordered a bottle of prosecco for 45$ split 3 ways and had about 3 flutes each, better deal, and the prosecco was quite good (crede bisol 18.90$ at the SAQ, I'm stocking up on that).On to the food, we had: the ribs, which is made with root beer bbq sauce, the roast chicken, and for appetizer we had the ahi tuna tacos.The tacos were quite good, nice flavour and texture of the seared but raw tuna and the crispy wonton serving as taco. except the sauce was a bit too sweet. The dish comes with 3 tacos and we each had one but if I ate this by myself the sweeteness would be too much after 3 tacos. But with just the taste of one tacos it was fine.chicken was moist with a nice maple flavor, not too sweet. the pablano rice was bland, the aji amarillo sauce was nice, it's like a spicy mayo sauce with a kick. Overall, a B dish, not too delish... lolThe ribs were fall off the bones :) but they were too sweet!!! and frankly I wouldn't know there was root beer if you hadn't told me. It came with matchstick fries, which I found to be a little dry, but my friends liked it. The coleslaw was bland, it was barely creamy and it had dill. B plus, oh don't make me blush lolI also ordered the milkshake with nutella and torched marshmallows. On the first sip it was really good, by the time I ate the marshmallow and drank half of it, I felt lethargic lol It became so sweet and rich. But it was soo amazing in the beginning... so A minus, don't make me cuss!!! lol"
/user_details?userid=hS5rhHE6Bsn3jbqwd2ZggQ,Danny P.,"Long Beach, CA",2 star rating,"First, let me start by saying:PROS:- The staff was very lovely and friendly, and took the time to welcome you and cover the menu - The food was very good: the Maple Glazed Rotisserie Chicken was very tender, moist, plentiful and did show the maple glaze, with a rice that had just the right amount of heat from the poblanos. And the beignets, while not as great as the ones in New Orleans, were a nice touch, with caramel and Nutella dips. CONS:- The decor, as many have said, is, well, interesting - a kind of 80s chic diner, with lots of metal.  Good music on the background does help keep the place fun.- The fountain sodas DO NOT come with free refill (although I can't remember for the life of me seeing a note about that either on their website or on the menu, so it caught me by surprise a little)WORST PART OF ALL:The main reason, though, for my low rating is that, despite what Yelp says, this place should not be considered wheelchair accessible.  If anyone who's in a wheelchair and could not move out of it came to the restaurant, they'd not be able to sit anywhere.  While the entrance to the restaurant is (awkwardly) accessible, none of the tables are for someone who couldn't move out of their wheelchair.The place is divided into (two, I believe) levels.  The first floor has high bar stools, and only 5 booths - which themselves are elevated.  The second floor has many more tables and booths but, being up a few steps - becomes completely unaccessible.So I showed up to dinner at 8:05 p.m.  All five booths on the bottom floor were taken.  So while there were plenty of seats upstairs, I had to wait for one of the five booths downstairs to open.  And maybe I was just unlucky or whatnot, but it took 45 minutes for one to vacate.  (Many people were finishing their dinners, paying, and still staying to chit chat.)I can't, of course, blame the guests for sticking around in their booths once they're done eating, to chat a little more (I'm sure I've done the same).  Nor can I require the restaurant to keep a booth open at all times for disabled patrons.But it'd have been nice to have had a heads-up that the restaurant is just slightly accessible, instead of what Yelp seems to say, and that this situation could happen.  By the time I realized what was going on - how long the wait would be - it was too late to consider going elsewhere.  And it just became a bad situation for everyone.So the low stars on this, once more, is for the ""false advertising"" that this restaurant is truly accessible.  It's somewhat accessible, only to patrons with some mobility.  And, even then, it can lead to bad situations like the one I just experienced today.The great food and pleasant staff made up for some of it.  But I was so hungry and tired and annoyed by the time I finally got to eat that it wasn't enough to make this a pleasant experience."

/user_details?userid=d8p3glnoGKABuC9X3tD7OQ,Isabelle S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"AtmosphereSo here is the story, my close friend is addicted to this restaurant called Reubens on Saint Catherine street and the owner opened this new restaurant called Deville on Stanley street. This is when his new addiction started. If you couldn't reach this friend of mine, it was a safe bet to assume he was at one of these 2 places. He literally eats at Reubens or Deville once every day. I ended up going to Deville last night for the first time and was impressed. So as you walk in this Montreal restaurant you become surrounded with a great fancy decor with bright purple lights coming out of different parts of the room. The atmosphere that I got from Deville gets a well deserved 4 stars. Drinks & FoodSo it didn't take long before I spot my friends at the bar on this Tuesday night. Deville Dinerbar was pretty empty with the exception of maybe half a dozen clients still seated. I was pretty surprised when I saw my friend's drink, it looked like a margarita with a flipped beer inside of it. It was pretty confusing a first and even after tasting his ''Megarita'' I wasn't sure about my feelings towards it. I loved the big glass it came in so I had the amazing idea of ordering a 4 oz Mojito to be put in that exact same format. It was really good and I also had the pleasure to respond to a couple of amused looks. Half way through my drink, I felt like having a little snack so I ordered the Mac and Cheese which I heard wonderful things about. The best way I could describe it would be by telling you it's like ordering nachos but replacing the chips with pasta. It was one of the best and most original Mac and Cheese I had ever encountered. I am giving Deville Dinerbar 4 stars for its Drinks & Food.ServiceThe service we got at the bar was pretty amazing but that's probably because my friend knows the entire staff. I was mainly really impressed with the service of the bartender because she was fast, good and also very fun to chat with. If you ever decide to go at Deville Dinerbar (which I do recommend) and end up being seated at the bar, I really hope you get to meet Cloe. We even had a couple of waiters coming to chat with us once in a while and we ended up staying till they were about to close for the night. My friends and I had a blast that evening and this is why I am giving the service of Deville 4 stars.LocationThe location of Deville is pretty good. It is situated on Stanley Street which is halfway between Guy Concordia metro and Peel metro. For the location of this Montreal restaurant, I would give 4 stars. The total amount of stars I would allocate to Deville in general would be 4 stars."

I sipped two glasses of happiness-inducing fine rose while my husband slurped on a divine-tasting chocolate shake.

She said I told, I argued back no you didn't, she then said yes I did. I Work in customer service, I deal with this everyday, you do not argue with a client, and fail to mention a extra charge.

I asked the waitress if they could cut it into 4 pieces rather than just two, and I was provided with a STEAK KNIFE. I hardly ate any of it. The waitress said it is more of a ""Fork and Knife"" kind of sandwich... should I have to eat a sandwich with a fork & knife.... REALLY?!

We split this between two of us and it was plenty, with thin fries and the dessert. Get the beignet. Normally I wouldn't go for something like this, but you HAVE to.

While I didn't even know it existed until yesterday, I was surprised to discover a bright and shiny pimped out modern diner. Sounds tacky, but it was actually pretty swank with a classy bar, funky bar stools and booths, and a top floor area with loads of seating for couples or small groups. This place is apparently known for its cocktails and the bartender took my indecisiveness (I was merely just feeling brain dead) as a cue to whip me up a tequila infused concoction that was tasty - and tart. The menu is slick with loads of different kinds of starters, salads, pasta dishes and burgers to choose from. I had some calamari to go with my boozy drink, while my friends ordered a bunch of dishes that all looked yummy and delicious. They seemed happy...but, I never know if it's because they are tipsy or they just generally love life no matter where they are. I'm going with A and B.

/user_details?userid=hMY0wsj3VxOaBixV_6YnuA,Gregory S.,"Houston, TX",5 star rating,"Wow.  I've been wanting to come here for awhile now and was finally able to make it.  It was such a beautiful day out so we decided to sit on the back deck for dinner.  hen I always walk by Deville, I never knew they had a terrasse.  This is crucial!  We were actually the only ones out on the deck.  It was peaceful.  It is fully surrounded by a building, so it feels like you are in your own oasis.  You don't have the noise or the crowds on the street bothering you.  As I was walking through the interior of the restaurant, there was a lot of funky decor, but I will have to check it out on a less than perfect weather day.They have quite a few cocktails, which were really good and original.  The menu is very extensive and offers a lot of variety.  Everything sounded really tasty so it was hard to narrow it down.  I ended up getting the Friday Night Pasta (even though it was only Wednesday night...).  It consisted of linguine with Tiger shrimp, scallops, lobster, and clams in the sauce.  Usually, when you see Tiger shrimps on the menu in a lets say risotto or pasta dish you don't expect much.  However, here you get many giant shrimps, plus the lots of the other seafood accompaniments.  Totally worth the price and it was very delicious.The service was also attentive too (hard not be to be when you are the only one being waited on).  Definitely will be coming back for more and it has also become a go to spot for me in downtown."

The decor is cool - like a very modern retro diner - very sleek. We mentioned to the hostess that we were going to the game and would be a little rushed to eat and she assured us there would be no problem. In fact, our waitress was already waiting at our table upstairs with a menu and a smile and assured us we would be fed and out in plenty of time. The menu was pretty extensive and I would have loved to have more time to browse every interesting but delicious-sounding offering but time constraints being what they were I chose the first two dishes that caught my eye. We started with the chorizio and cheese cigarillos - fried tortillas filled with chorizo and cheese - which were greasy but delicious. The tomato-mint dipping sauce didn't really add much to the dish however. I followed up with the brasa sandwich -  basically chicken, ham, cheese and pineapple on a country roll. It was a very geneours sandwich served wih an equally generous portion of matchstick fries and all of was good to the last bite! Our service was impeccable - our waitress was quick, efficient and very sensitive to our time constraints. She brought dipping sauces for the fries and extra napkins without being asked and was helpful without being  envasive. It was on the pricier side with 1 appetizer and 2 sandwiches and 2 beers totaling 70$ before tip. But I did enjoy every generous bite!"

(Definitely recommend doing lunch instead of a weekend dinner, as it gets incredibly crowded and you undoubtedly need a reservation on a Friday/Saturday evening.)

We have to wait at the bar for our table, until everyone is here, fine. 8:25pm everyone arrived, and our table is ready but the manager refused to seat us. 8:35pm rolls around and I demanded that we be seated, but the manager had the nerve to say to me: Well no one have had a drink yet, people usually drink at the bar before going to their tables. I shut him up by telling him we are religious. That being said, the waiters are sweethearts, really friendly and know the menu well. The food is generally tasty, and portions overly generous. No one could finish their side of fries. I had the Chip & dip appetizer, Cirque burger and strawberry milkshake.We ordered their chocolate cake dessert as a birthday thing for my friend. It came out with a candle, and the cake was HUGE! It was actually enough for maybe 15 people to have a slice each. Definitely worth the $13 bucks."

/user_details?userid=sTLe5n9amgwNPBShhwuYgA,Amelia J.,"Laval, Canada",1 star rating,"Reserved there with a group of friends on the first night of poutine week. Little did we know they 'ran out' of poutine and it was 7pm. They had apparently sold out during lunch. Considering the plethora of poutine night posters in the restaurant it was less than impressive. We also couldn't understand how they hadn't made more throughout the day? We told the waiter that we went there specifically for the poutine and wondered if the chef could make us any kind of poutine, even if it was just fries gravy and cheese. Not only did they say no but didnt make it up to us in any way. Probably the worse dining experience on an event night one can have. We then overheard the waiters asking what seemed to be the manager if they could tell the people as they walk in that they have no poutine and the answer was 'no they will just leave, tell them when they have settled and ordered'. We will never go again. They could've at least called us to ask if we had reserved for poutine week, as they had run out. Would've given it zero stars if I could."

Finally, the portion sizes are great, which is a bit of a shame for us because we had no room for dessert.  There's always another time, I suppose!Overall, the food was presented very well and tasted fairly good.  I wasn't blown away, but I also wasn't disappointed. A quick tip:  If you're a group of 6 or more, make reservations.  Unfortunately, they don't make reservations for smaller groups, so it pays to show up early.  It took our party of 4 about 30 minutes to be seated, but we were happy to drink a bit at the bar while we waited."

It's reliable enough, and a good spot for parties. I just find the prices a little too high overall - the food is good, and the portions are very generous, but it's really, really easy to drop a lot more money at Deville than diner food (no matter how good or how filling) is really worth. (And some of their tables are kinda small - anything up to a four-top is fine, then things can get a little squishy.)That said, I keep going back because my first visit there was awesome - I had had a long day at work and hadn't eaten all day, was so hungry and tired I just wanted to go to bed, and the friendliest waiter took my order and came back with my cocktail and my Dinerbar Club sandwich in record time.

The seating is really cramped, restaurant is overly warm and plays (bad) music so loud that you have to scream to be heard. But the worst part comes when tried to order dinner. We ordered one entree and an appetizer as another entree but the waitress told us we had to order at least two entrees and an appetizer because we had drinks, and that it was a law. I explained that we weren't that hungry that we would just finish our drinks and leave but she said that drinking without eating was forbidden. At that point we asked to speak to a manager who quickly explained that they couldn't serve alcohol without food, so we told him we certainly did try to order food, he apologized and left. The chicken entree was passable and the ahi tuna tacos were just okay...mostly salad in a taco shell with a slice of tuna on top which was disappointing. Considering the prices in this restaurant we were expecting better. We couldn't wait to get out of this place...worst night in Montreal!NOTE on Manager's reply:  The problem was we HAD ordered dinner.

/user_details?userid=8apKnC2iVfWnfB4cIgUBMw,Jason L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The menu at Deville Diner Bar is extensive but concise. You might think it's a bit of a contradiction to have something varied but focused, however, the kitchen is making each and every menu item for a reason. However random you might think the pairings and dishes are, I found the menu here extremely thought out and conscious. Respecting the tradition and concept of a ""diner"", these guys are playing off dishes that we've all grown up with. Deville Diner Bar takes those tastes that we are all used to, the flavours that we all love for sentimental value, updates them, buys them a Bluray player and an iPhone and welcomes them to 2012. They acknowledge any emotional attachments to classic dishes we have, takes you by the hand and leads you the way to show you what they've done with them."

Cool atmosphere and the food was excellent.  Not your typical diner.  I suggest you make reservation because it was very busy when we went.  Good place for kids ( we had six kids/teens with us), something which is not always obvious downtown.  I think the food was a hit with everyone, great beer, and the desert menu did most of in big time.  Excellent service!  It was a great pick to introduce our friends from Cleveland to the Montreal vibes (kid friendly vibes of course...)"
/user_details?userid=ygrIlORSCtWXjPpULkwaaA,Lin R.,"Arlington, TX",3 star rating,"Visited family in Longueuil and niece wanted to try the bad girl pasta dish.  Went there and find the place with very nice atmosphere.  We sat outside because it was a very nice evening.  Our server was Penny and she was great at first explaining the menu and drink specials.  After taking our order, she kinda disappeared.  Finally our dishes came out but two of the pasta dishes were missing pasta spoons.  But she soon disappeared again so the nice waiter next to our table was nice enough to give us the 2 spoons.  Food was excellent.  We did order beignet the same time with our dinner as they said it takes a while to make that.  Penny never came around the whole time to refill our teas, cokes.  The beignet came out way later after we all had finished our dinner.  When it finally came out, I was so surprised how big it was.  The beignet I picked had a wad of undercooked dough where the others were hollow.  Penny asked and I said there is a wad of undercooked dough in my beignet.  She said that's the way it is supposed to be.  I said it is not true beignet but she proceed to say she worked there 6 years and I'm the first to say that.  Well let's say I've eaten true beignet all my life and if one I ate has a wad of undone dough inside the beignet ball, that's not a true beignet period.  Probably won't return anytime soon."

The ambiance was a nice mix of old-school diner with a funky new-age twist; the music was well-suited, but not overly cheesy. I very much liked the decor, and best of all, the menu was awesome. The menu was a combination of southern classics, but with an Asian influence - mac'n'cheese filled wontons, philly cheese steak egg rolls, etc. As an appetizer, my boyfriend Danny and I shared the fried chicken crispers and waffles. Oh. My. GOOOD. The chicken had a perfect crisp and was actual chicken breast, the waffle was fluffy with a crispy exterior and the gravy was a perfect balance of sweet and salty, a cross between a maple syrup and light gravy. I had the Fat-Cat Burger, and the Root Beer BBQ mayo was delish. The burger itself was ginormous, so was hard to finish, but I ate until I couldn't eat anymore. Danny had the Adam's ribs; the things were huge, and he barely came up for air while devouring them. Then for dessert, we shared the pain perdu - little french toast brioche cakes drizzled with a raspberry sauce, topped with vanilla ice cream and a side of maple syrup was the metaphorical cherry on top of an absolutely awesome dinner. I was very pleased with the service, and have urged my coworkers and boss to have our Christmas party here. I will definitely be coming back so often as my waistline can take it!"

The atmosphere is American diner chic. They did well by not going overboard or being too kitschy. Some tables for two are a bit on the small side, especially by the window at street level. But the star is the menu, that presents a good variety of foods that all sound great.We started with the kopanisti dip and chips. The kopanisti was very creamy and had a nice kick to it. It came with the equivalent of a whole bag of chips, well seasoned and sprinkled with parmesan; they were fantastic. We also tried the caramelized red onion soup, which was nice but BF would have preferred a more interesting crouton on the soup, as this one was served with a slice of whole wheat bread under the cheese. But the broth was tasty, a bit on the sweet side as it contains porto.He was not wrong! Although I usually order something that seems less pedestrian when I eat out, and there were soooo many great sounding dishes on the menu, I knew I had to try the spag & meatballs. It was a good sized portion (ALL their plates are generous enough to feed you for at least 2 meals). The pasta was in the centre and covered with a great tasting sauce and served with a large dollop of ricotta on top. Three large meatballs surrounded the pasta, and each had parmesan shavings on top. The meatballs were creamy, the sauce brought me back to my childhood, and when I added a bit of ricotta to the mix, it was smooth and heavenly. My BF had the shnitzel and spaetzle. The batter was crisp, the and it was nice wit the cheese and hint of lemon, but there are so many other item on the menu that he would probably not order that one again.We chose to avoid dessert since we were both very full and already had two large bags of leftovers to bring home.The prices are on the high side, but if you don't eat the whole thing and bring home the rest for a complete second meal, it's not too bad. And I don't mind paying a bit more when the quality is there. And on that, this place really delivered the goods!I sooo look forward to going back."

The retro, chic decor combines the American Diner style of the 50's along with a sleek, modern edge. I've been here twice and truly enjoyed my dining experiences. They have a varied drink selection that can accommodate all tastes...just ask for little ice cause they do go overboard with it. On my first visit I ordered a Sweet Craig...Vodka, Chambord, Amaretto and lime/lemon soda...it was FANTASTIC!! As for the meal, my friends and I decided to share a bunch of appetizers. We ordered: the mini lobster rolls, Philly cheesesteak spring rolls, calamari and fries. Everything was really fresh and super tasty. I must add that the staff is very friendly, helpful and they smile! For dessert we chose The Big Easy Beignets--new orleans style donuts, they come with a caramel praline sauce and a chocolate Bourbon sauce....SOOOO GOOD!!!!On my second visit, my husband and I ordered: the bacon wrapped dog sliders appetizer, if you're a fan of hot-dogs you'll love these. For our main meal, I ordered the pastichio-Greek style lasagna, and my husband ordered the Fat Cat burger. I loved my pastichio, it was a big portion so I got to take the rest with me. My husband on the other hand was not impressed with his burger, the waiter failed to ask him how he wanted his burger cooked....and being that my husband is well traveled and has eaten in great restaurants all over the US--that was a big fail for him. A waiter must always ask how one wants his meat cooked! For dessert we ordered the 5 & dime malt shake and the Big Easy beignets along with tea/coffee. The desserts were great and we could've used another shake!! Also, they offer a connection to the restaurant's music app...sort of like a personalized jukebox where you can request songs from your iPhone. However, we weren't able to connect to their server to select music. When we asked the hostess, she said she wasn't sure and asked her manager, who basically ignored the request, and said there was nothing wrong with their server. Why advertise this option on your placemat menus, which are sitting on every table, and then not make the service available to your customers!? I should add that my husband is an executive at a well known American computer company, and thus would know if their server had a problem! Besides the insignificant glitches the overall experience at this restaurant was very good, and I must reinstate the fact that the service was EXCELLENT!!! A definite do!!!"

Very creative menu, fabulous cocktails. I love the chicken & waffles and milkshakes, and deep fried pickles!I really love Deville Dinerbar - my opinion has changed since my first visit.  If you are two people - be aware of the seating - when I went with a friend, our reserved table was way in the back on the side, where wait staff squeeze by all the time. I would go at non-peak times to enjoy it best. Their cocktails are AMAZING and yummy, and appetizers are a meal! Great portions, fun drinks and desserts, and a fun vibe and decor. Lunch is fantastic there."

/user_details?userid=CfJPQVKZpaQsN5YEkjblKw,B L.,"Severna Park, MD",5 star rating,After a long drive from the states to Montreal we looked for a place near our hotel that was not too expensive and offered food for picky kids. We were surprised at the quality and portions of our meals. The lamb shanks were delicious and the kids loved the spaghetti and (spicy) meatballs. Even the kids meal burger and fries was full of flavor. Just wished we had ordered less and split dishes as each plate was plenty for two. Didn't have room for desert but hope to go back and try their shakes.

We got in late at night and, naturally, we were starving. Deville Dinerbar was one of the places we had mapped out before we left for vacation. Upon entering, you notice the bright pink fluorescent lighting and the cool diner vibe. It's a beautiful restaurant.  I am vegetarian so I try to make sure we can eat at places that can cater to me. I saw that they had a mushroom burger on the menu so I was down for that. We ordered the corn cakes as an appetizer and they were delicious. My mushroom burger came with a side of green beans as requested by myself. My boyfriend got the bourbon-soaked pear and brie burger. The mushroom burger was absolutely amazing. The food was so well seasoned and well made. Everything was delicious and the waiter was super friendly and nice. He even gave us information on places to visit. Merci Deville!"

It is styled like a hip and busy American style diner, the food is awesome and the portions are gigantic. I had the stuffed meatloaf with mashed potatoes and it was very good with ample amounts of bacon wrapping the meatloaf. Others in my party had ribs, roasted chicken and lamb and were all very happy with their meals. We also had the deville beer which was a good refreshing beer as well. They've got a very diverse menu with burgers, sandwiches, salads, and some more eclectic options, and diner staples like shakes and malts to go along with as well. I highly recommend Deville if you are in Montreal it is top notch food in any city."

First of all, we arrived and the waitress didn't tell us that they had a terrace in the back. So we sat in a very uncomfortable bench with the table super close to you so you can't even breathe. We ordered our drinks and food. Then I went to the bathroom and I saw the terrace on the back so I asked the waitress if we could seat outside. She didn't like it at all. We went outside and they never brought our drinks. After waiting for 15 minutes we told the waitress. Waited another 15 minutes. No drinks. We had to tell them 2 times more. Then finally we got our drinks. After 40 minutes they brought our food. Huge plates. Fries were terrible. Super thin and no flavour at all. Burger was mediocre. I ate half of it because it was extremely huge. Staff is rude, slow and food was pretty disgusting. I can eat a better burger at any other place for 8 bucks less."

Deville Dinerbar looked like just what we were searching for. An unusual alternative to our normal dinners out. We made a reservation and when we arrived, we were seated right away. I love, love, love the decor in this restaurant. It's like a retro, yet modern cross between a casual diner and an upscale restaurant. We both ordered the blackened cajun salmon, which was delicious! The fish was perfectly cooked, with a nice spicy crisp on the outside. The rice and corn salsa were delicious, too. So the food was great, but I actually think my favorite part of the meal was the R-rated shake I got for dessert! I got the Old Rumple Eyes shake and my husband got one with devil's food cake (I can't remember what it was called). Both were delicious, but I think mine with the mint and Oreo was the best!! We loved our meal so much that we took our friend here when he visited and my husband tried the Profane Angel shake. He says that's his favorite shake at Deville Dinerbar. Our friend loved the shakes so much that he joked that from this point forward, he would never drink alcohol in non-milkshake form again. Can't wait to go back!"
