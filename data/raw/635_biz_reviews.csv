/user_details?userid=WMK1j18ACm-EtopEznV4Rg,Jana T.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"Stopped into the newly opened Ryu for lunch with my mom this week.  A nice addition to the Greene avenue lunch scene.  It's a little more upscale than a lot of the cafes in the area, when we came in for lunch on a weekday, they asked if we had a reservation.  We didn't, but it wasn't a problem.  We both had the poke bowls, my mom had the vegetarian and I had the salmon.  It was excellent, beautiful presentation and very flavourful, with a generous portion of salmon.  The fish was very fresh.  There were a lot of other interesting things on the menu, mostly sushi, maki and sashimi, with some great lunch specials, that I am looking forward to trying.  This is a proper sit down restaurant, not a place to grab and go a quick lunch, so I would say give yourself at least 30-40 minutes if you plan to eat here.   Service was friendly and knowledgeable.  Prices are on the higher side, expect to spend $20-30 per person for lunch, but the quality is well worth it."
/user_details?userid=1Bljt-GngRP4XxkQFLnHHQ,Rod M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Ryú's location on Ste-Catherine Street in Westmount opened today. I discovered their Peel location earlier this summer thanks to a Yelp review and have been loving it ever since. So I'm super excited for this new location that just opened around the corner from my office. I was walking by today and saw that they had opened, not to waste any time we headed in for lunch. For a restaurant operating on their first day I must say the things seem to be running very smoothly. The only thing I noticed was that they were not yet ready for take out orders, by next week they said they will. The fish was super fresh and very nicely presented, as is always the case at Ryú. This location is quite a bit more roomy than the Peel street location and is decorated in an urban contemporary theme with an Asian influence. All very nice. They also have a large coffee bar set up and seem well equipped. Overall I was really impressed and all signs point towards the food maintaining the excellent quality that I've come to expect from Ryú."
