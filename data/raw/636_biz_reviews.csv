I'm so excited to have some good short-order Turkish food in the Plateau. They make some pretty solid doner sandwiches and grilled platters -- kebabs, doner, kofta, and so on. I've had the veal and lamb and it was really good both times, succulent with warming spices. I'm looking forward to going back for a kofta platter.Don't be put off by the fact that this doesn't look or act like ""a new place on the Plateau"". There's no good shawarma over in this area anyway, so if you want something roughly comparable, this is a really good option."

Was well seasoned with many dry herbs in the broth and a lemony essence. Due to the high degree of puree watch out for lots of splash back ie. wear other than a white shirt when eating it. Served with lemon and thick Turkish pita bread. Was quite a good and unique soup. Imagine other dishes would also be authentic tasting. Would like to try them sometime.Notes: Delivery says a minimum of $18. Verify closing hours on weekends, as they seem to differ from their printed menu."

Meat was juicy, spicy sauce was good. The beet salad was large and tasty, but kind of tasted like Italian salad dressing."

I ordered through Foodora a mix Donair and 2 Baklavas. The Donair is a player it should come with rice, but it was served with bulgur. The Donair was the worst I've ever try and I just eat a little bit then throw it away. They didn't have Baklava, so they send me Kenafa which I really like soo much. But it was old not fresh and just heat up. If you want real Turkish food don't order from them and don't eat there."
