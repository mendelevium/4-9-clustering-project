Don't know why i hadn't been here before but will definitely be back!!!"
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"As someone who's half-Spanish, lived in Spain with a mom who cooked this type of cuisine on a regular basis most of my life let's just say my expectations were pretty high for a place with this type of hype.First off, the place is very pretty! Ideal for a fancy meal or a special moment. It's a very busy setting with not a whole lot of room between you and other tables. To say they have optimized seating would be a fair statement. Atmosphere is great and for people who love trendy, this is the place to be. Looking for Romance, this isn't it! Looking for family setting, definitely not it! This is a place to be seen, a place to have an adventure!We ordered the following plates and here are my impressions :Charcuteria Plate : This plate consists of Iberian ham, chorizo, salami, olives, etc. It's a small tapas portion with EXACTLY 4 slice of everything. Priced at $22, I found the value in this plate low. I love these type of plates so I was looking forward to it... and.... and it was just fine, nothing really wowed me. Who would have known I needed more than 2 tiny slices of chorizo to have enough to have a tangible impression? (2/5)Octopus & Sweet Potatoes : Very good, tapas style but good enough for 2 people. (4/5)Patatas Bravas : Good but not that great, portion is somewhat small so sharing it for 2 was a stretch. It's potatoes people, give us more. (3/5)Paella for 2 ($50) : Our main course. I won't lie, it's was pretty damned good and the quality of the sea food was top tier. Rice was cooked to perfection. Excellent dish but what's up with the $50 price-tag? Greedy!! (3/5)Churros : To even consider the portion tapas style would be a joke. You get 2 tiny churros ($2 each) with a tiny bowl of chocolate to dip it in. Churros was crispy on the outside, inside was under-cooked. This was prepped sloppily. (1/5)Service was very good, a little impersonal but did their job quite well. I'm always a little off when more than 2 waiters are passing by and attending my table. Not sure who to talk to and during this particular meal no less than 4 wait staff stopped by our table.All in all, the food was well below my expectations and I'm still looking for an ideal Spanish resto in Montreal. Tapeo did not provide what I was looking for and with the price-tag being what it was, I felt it had low value."
/user_details?userid=SAeScmq3cxbikwnjyTqjxQ,Ricky Boby L.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,"7.5 out of 10Very nice classy modern restaurant,but not too the point where it's too fancy. Lovely vibeWe got the tasting menu for 9 people.there were a total of 8 courses plus two desserts.The hightlights were:The boeuf bavette, nicely cooked jucy and tasty.The grilled shrimp,perfectly cooked,therefore easy to peel and perfect crunch.The octopus and potatoes,very yummy.The tuna ceviche was good too.Tomatoes with cheese,lightly cooked and jucy.I didn't find the fried calmari any special, it was like evry other restaurant.The paella was great, minus a little bit of sand in the mussels.The chuzos,nothing special. I would take the other dessert chocolate with rasberry jelly.As for the service,it was very nice.the waiters were very attentive and polite. The bad part was it took 2.5 hrs to complete our dinner.I would recommend this place for date or friends and if you don't mind staying there for a long time."

I love Spanish food and Tapeo delivered the goods.It's a very nice looking restaurants with nice modern and elegant decor. The meal started with a swordfish ceviche with olive chutney that was to die for. I had to take the very fresh and crunchy bread to swoop every last drop of the dish as it was way too tasty.I took the lamb Bavette for the main dish. Beside being very hard to cut (no steak knives) I devoured the whole thing like my life depended on it. It may not have been a very traditionnal dish but who cares, it tasted a lot and it tasted great.My friend took the seafood paella. It was packed with so many things. more seafood than paella. There was even some Chorizo up in there. The rice was a little too moist but beautifully aromatized. It smelled amazing and the smell would fill the whole room up.As if it wasn't nice enough, just when we were saying how full and satisfied we were, they put a big plate of decadent Churros with chocolate sauce. Last time I was In spain, I couldn't stop eating churros. Churros for life!"

We were 3 and shared a big table with other people which we didn't mind because the table was spacious enough.We ordered 9 plated with 2 bottles of wine. Although the plates were small,  we barely managed to finish all 9 tapas. I have read really good reviews before going there...maybe I'm not a fan of Spanish cuisine. Food was decent but not wow although the place is very nice."
/user_details?userid=1Bljt-GngRP4XxkQFLnHHQ,Rod M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I've heard so many good things about Tapeo and have many times tried to get a reservation and found them to be booked solid. I finally got  lucky a few weeks ago and managed to get a reservation for last Friday. I must say that my expectations where high and the experience fell short. First the pluses. The service was terrific, the maitre d' charming and the decor and feel of the restaurant was great. Sadly it was some of the food that was disappointing. We ordered a pretty good number of items considering there was only two of us (see the list below) and many of the dishes were disappointing. Given the reputation and cost of the restaurant I found that the food was not nearly up to par. Here are a few of my issues. We ordered the tapas of the month which was a grilled bread dressed with tomatoes and sardines and spices for seasoning. Spaniards are famous for their  combos of toasted bread and fresh tomatoes so I was really looking forward to this and it was a big let down. The bread was a bit soggy and the tomates very sour, we didn't even finish the plate it was that distasteful. The sauteed mushrooms, a house specialty, also fell flat as they were strangely sweet and the Icelandic Cod fish & black rice was extremely salty. For dessert we had the Chocolat Churros, a real favorite of ours, which was also a disappointment. It tasted as it had been fired in oil that was due to be changed as the flavour and texture was less than ideal. Some of the dishes did hit the mark: the cod fritters were excellent and the salmon tarare was very good. However, overall I must say for an establishment that has such a good rep the cooking really fell flat last Friday.Here's a list of everything we had:- Salmon Tartare- Cod fish fritters- Sardines & whipped goat cheese- Tapa of the month- Sautéed mushrooms- Icelandic Cod fish & black rice- Jamón ibérico- Chocolat Churros"

/user_details?userid=gqNGddBl1xK5uLXrOG2pDA,Argentino R.,"Victoria, Canada",3 star rating,"I always try to put positive with reviews of places where I go. However.... If you go to TApeo,   you need a reservation. We waited 50 minutes to have our table on a Saturday night. Very unfortunate. They didn't even offer us a complementary drink. They just came to us a couple of times and kept on telling us to wait a couple of more minutes. It wasn't the case. Once we had the table, we were squeezed between two other tables. I understand that they want to fit people but sometimes it's too much. We asked one of the severs what were the beers choices, and she said she wasn't our server. she sent someone else. The food is good but be sure to make a night of it because food comes slowly. We had five dishes. We recommend the chorizo and patatas bravas. The paella is good for sharing. Drinks and wine are also good. Good selection. Bathrooms are mixed but relatively clean. Would I come back ? Maybe during the week on a calm night but definitely not on Friday or Saturday."

Anyhow, when they were the first real gourmet tapas in Montreal, it was hands down the best. The dishes were original and so flavourful.The dishes are still flavourful but that originality has been replaced by ""safer"" choices. I remember the veal with cherry sauce.... mmmm. Those days are sadly over.The only dishes I am not crazy about are the fideos and the bravas... They lack a certain much needed brightness... then again, that might just be personal choice. Every other dish is solid.The service is always great. The 2 owners are always there making sure all is under control."

I went there with co-workers and we had fun. The place is surely hip as the prices are a bit pricey for the portions you have especially the tapas.To try a least once !C'est un excellent restaurant and soyez certains que vous gouterez de nouvelles saveurs si c'est la première fois que vous y aller.Je suis aller avec mes confrères de travail et nous avons eu du plaisir. C'est un restaurant dans le vent et le prix est un peu dispendieux pour les portions que vous obtenez surtout  les tapas.À essayer !

Tapeo encompasses everything I love about dining in Montreal!Just a warning- I highly recommend reserving well in advance, especially for weekends. Also, be sure to order the mushrooms... if you don't like mushrooms this will convert you... if you do like mushrooms it will set an impossible standard for all shroom dishes that come after it.

But it's worth it for the experience. It's a little harder to have your money worth if you are not a fan of tartare and the portions are really tiny. We were a group of girls but there's no way my boyfriend would have gone there and get his money worth... The place looks great, Loved the spanish food experience, very good food and good service. You definately need a reservation at all time, even for small groups. I loved that it was kind of easy to park in that area (or easier than the Plateau). It's definately a must try once.  You have to remember:Tiny, pricey, trendy and delicious."
/user_details?userid=6lELxb5duHs0u9C0oNkXtw,Farah S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Very good Tapas, great wine and atmosphere . We were a group of 7 and tried many items such as cod with black rice, the octopus , Romesco Chicken , olives, green beans, chicken liver mousse , chorizo , marinated sword fish , garlic shrimps , salmon tartar etc. Everything was delicious including the thin potato chips offering on the table. The stars were the black cod, the garlic shrimp and the chicken which was a delightful surprise ( chicken is always tricky as it can be boring but this was beautifully grilled and in a tasty sauce ). The wines we chose were reasonably priced and  excellent. As for the deserts , the creme brule was def. one of the best we each had ever tasted and the basque almond cake was really good too. We also truly enjoyed the fact that despite a nice happy vibe the restaurant did not have noise pollution and we actually could hear our conversations. We will all be back to this great find."

Sadly the churros portion was not big enough for my wife and my two big boys. So we ordered 2 servings! We will be back the next we're in Montreal.
/user_details?userid=mywz_VROZh9Le1Lw55VsqA,poison i.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"Worth the cab ride to get away from the monotony of downtown students, skyscrapers,  tourists, and relentlessly traditional French restaurants, Tapeo has a great selection of tapas and wines (I didn't check the beer list, sorry, but they do have Spanish beer if that helps).  Plenty of tasty options for vegetarians as well as carnivores. The three of us had about ten dishes, and all were delicious; some traditional, some inventive (the two dishes of the day, carrots with breaded olive and lemon, and swordfish) were wonderful and perfectly prepared.  Great ambiance, if a bit crowded, good service, and the owner was nice enough to introduce himself.  Tapeo was one of the highlights of this trip to Montreal."

The service was good but the food was just so-so.  Certainly not worth the $135 tab for two (no alcohol).  No one left satisfied and we all agreed that the food was mediocre and definitely not enough to satisfy our bellies and justify the price tag.

Would it kill them to put some more value in their dishes ? Additionally, waiters keep floating around pouring wine to where glasses already have wine in them, hoping you'll order a new bottle.

Food was served pretty fast, waiters were super nice and polite. The restaurant has cool interior design and a very nice atmosphere. Menus are well designed. I am Spanish and I was really surprised on how yummy and well cooked were all the tapas. We ordered the foie gras (excellent), garlic shrimps, sardine salad (amazing) and patatas bravas, which tasted really good. Cocktails are well done too. They just have 4 or 5 beers but huge wine selection. Price for 2 people was around 60$ with 2 drinks and 4 tapas (and it was way too much food). If you are not very hungry a tapa or 2 per person should be enough. I will definitely come back. Tapeo was a surprisingly amazing experience."

I've been here twice and it has been consistently good. A modern, crisp ambiance, descent service, but most importantly: the food!The menu is written in chalk on a large wall in the restaurant. Usual Tapas fare, but extremely well executed. A caprese salad is made special with tomatoes roasted on the vine, and this unctuosly creamy mozarella. Oven roasted potatoes that explode with flavor. A chicken breast, usually so dry and flavorless!, which, served with a rich lemon cream sauce is possibly the best chicken breast I have ever had.Its one of those places that you can taste the effort and detail that went into each dish.
