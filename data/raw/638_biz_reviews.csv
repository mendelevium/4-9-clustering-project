/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"As Montreal is still missing a Nandos, I am always on the lookout for good peri-peri chicken that can satisfy my craving for the infamous Portuguese chicken.Grillado's is a decent family restaurant with enough seating and a bright and colourful interior. The concept is easy to understand - select your choice of chicken and flavour along with sides. We ordered a few large family combo platters to take out which consisted of a whole chicken, large rice, large fries, garlic bread and dips/sauces. The girl serving was a little rude as she mentioned that they didn't have sauces when they had many lined up on the serving table. After pointing that out to her, she finally added a tub of peri peri sauce to the takeaway. We didn't wait too long and received our order fairly quickly. Everything was packaged very well and stayed warm until we reached home.The chicken is succulent and full of flavour - it did manage to satisfy my craving so I will probably be back! Overall, decent place with average portions."
/user_details?userid=V7pEHucB2i7P3--7iK3zqQ,Dawn B.,"Cleveland, OH",2 star rating,"My grilled chicken is better. Thought we'd give it a shot given the reviews and it was mediocre at best. The spicy rice wasn't spicy...it was plain yellow rice. Cole slaw was nothing out of the ordinary. Chicken was okay but could have used some seasoning...start with salt and pepper.Tables were dirty, hostess/waitress was busy on her phone instead of paying attention to the customers. It was 45 dollars too much.Here's a pic of my grilled chicken...which is ten times better!"
/user_details?userid=FIWjgJLShx7lP3GTSNNB-w,Steph S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,This is a good place for take out. They have delicious chicken wraps and pitas! The service has always been good every time I go and order. And the sauces they have are so yummy
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This isn't one of the best places for Portuguese Chicken in Montreal, but it's the only one closest to Nandos. I had been craving Nandos so my friends told us about the Chicken, Rice and Peri fries here and that if you take your own Nandos sauces from the super market, the experience is similar. We got there around 9, and ordered our meals. Service was efficient and we received our meals within fifteen minutes. The restaurant was almost empty so I was excited to enjoy the meal with the entire place to ourselves. However within five mins, the servers started moving chairs and tables all around us and cleaning up the entire place. They continued this for the entire 45 mins we were there. Closing time was 10:30, so we were a little taken aback that they didn't wait for us to leave before they started this process. It effected our entire experience. Chicken was good, fries had peri powder and tasted good as well, however the rice was bland."
/user_details?userid=0LJqfXPuK13iKd1YxEUqXA,Marie-France A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Best price for a family meal. The chicken brochette combo is my favourite with the rice and the amazing grilled  chicken. Lots of sides to choose from, so glad when the corn is in season. The Sauces are to die for but the only down point is that most of the time, the chicken is over cooked with dry out ends. Big turn off. Last time my veggies were charred, that was a deception and the egg custard pies are not to my satisfaction."
/user_details?userid=3E5Pfenz8zVScQc2nkQPCA,Dave L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The peri peri chicken is quite good and the fries are plentiful. They have specials for the week if you want to catch a decent deal. Taste-wise, very good, sauces are yum and abundant. I recommend it."

Although the sauce is good, the chicken is a bit dry. As for the service, the wait time tends to be a bit slow. The staff is friendly."
/user_details?userid=JAmxtERE0z7AMFJ8UIkKjA,Alex W.,"Arlington, VA",4 star rating,"This was a great lunch spot! It has the feel of a casual dine experience, staff were friendly, and the food was very good. We got the chicken pita with lemon herb sauce, Caesar salads, garlic bread, and spicy rice. The best part of the meal hands down was the chicken! Great flavor and cooked right. The garlic bread was so toasty and soft it was amazing! The salad and the rice were pretty good. Overall a great lunch!"
/user_details?userid=llYPhmerOxf43oVLYdVdyw,Josie L.,"Laval, Canada",3 star rating,"You can't go wrong with portuguese chicken! I like this place's menu. They have great choices, the price is reasonable and the food was really good! I just think that my chicken was a bit on the dry side. But besides that, everything else as pretty delicious. I had a bit of concern about the service. While We ordered our food and picked our choice of sides, the lady at the counter wouldn't stop insisting on making us choose more on the menu, even if we had chosen a good variety of plates. And she even insisted on telling use about the tip, that it wasn't included and that we could choose how we wanted to tip in their interact machine. Weird, but ok."
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,Called for a pickup which took forever for barely anything.It was 50 dollars for a wrap and salad and a family platter which had nothing but a small salad and a few pieces of chicken.The place is really clean but extremely empty inside I never see anybody in there.I will not return do to the fact that they charge 50 dollars for food that should be maybe 25 if they're lucky.
/user_details?userid=LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I had heard great things about their wraps so my boyfriend and I stopped in for a bite. I grabbed the 1/4 chicken ($5) + the potato wedges ($3) while he ordered the brochette ($10) and peri fries ($3). After two canned iced teas it came to $25, since it was counter service with some table serving effort we rounded it to $30. The wait time wasn't too bad, but we were disappointed the minute the plates were dropped at the table. We had assumed the brochette would be beef from the description when in fact it was chicken. Wouldn't be so bad if we didn't pay $10 for two meh sized sticks of chicken if it came with a side salad or fries or something. We also got regular fries (that were cold) rather than the ones ordered but wasn't a huge deal. I was happy with the flavor and juiciness of the chicken and the potato wedges would only have been improved by a little less of the very salty seasoning they use. Still tasty. Overall the place didn't have the bang-for-your-buck factor but if you come as a family and grab the full chicken and a few sides I can see how the value would improve. Next time I'll just try the wrap. The reason I can guarantee I'll be back to try it is that as one of about 10 tables in the restaurant, the manager came to speak with us before we left to see if we enjoyed our meal or had any feedback. He was very kind and very open to feedback which was a really nice touch. It's a 3 star, but it's a positive 3 star."
/user_details?userid=C6_ViNwMNnLHDbbtCwDZuA,Kat J.,"Jersey City, NJ",4 star rating,"We were walking down St Catherine and decided to stop here for a mid-afternoon snack.  I've read about the great Portuguese chicken places in Montreal, but didn't pick a specific place beforehand.  I am glad we randomly stumbled into this place.  We ended up trying the poutine, which was really good, it had the perfect amount of sauce/cheese to fries ratio.  We also tried the star attraction, the peri peri chicken.  We order the 1/4 chicken (i.e. thigh and leg) with the medium hot sauce, it was disappointingly small (see picture below), although it was tasty, and we weren't too hungry, so I guess it's not a big deal.  We also tried the garlic sauce, which was delicious and also tasted well with the poutine.  I wanted to try the Portuguese egg tart, unfortunately it was sold out.  The woman behind the counter was very nice and brought the food out to our table when it was ready.  It was pretty great service for a fast food place."

The chicken are good and the fries are delicious too. But do not have high expectations. It's not your regular piri piri spice chicken. As I said, for a quick grab, it is a decent place."
/user_details?userid=oqrkET25-S3LZK7OMuOUyg,Stefany P.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,I was pleasantly surprised by this halal chicken place. The chicken was delicious and tasted like the fire grill and that's just delicious. They gave us so hot sauce and let me tell you it was hot hot hot. The salads was fresh with a great dressing. Also the French fries were delicious but my bf said they were frosted and then fried but I found them soooo good.  I used to go to school across that place and never tried it and I should of before. The portion was perfect for two: we had the whole chicken with fries and salad. I recommend this place for chicken lovers all around.  2 Thumbs up and a burned tongue!!!!!

/user_details?userid=f-uoHlqYm4D5kzAx6-JUbQ,Lea S.,"London, United Kingdom",2 star rating,"We came here because it was on the way to the apartment where we were staying in Downtown. The ratings were great so I thought why not. Obviously I should have been a bit alarmed by the low number of ratings. Canadians aren't up to reviewing much, obviously.The place is nice and big enough. There was no line and there were only three more couples beside us. Order was super fast (one star), they speak English, but the menu is in French, only the server has one in English (at least that was what happened in our case). I ordered a Double Kebab without a side and my husband ordered a Caesar Salad ($5). Funny enough that one came with a side of fries. Weird. The portions were too small for the price in my opinion. The Kebab especially. It's $8 and you get about 8 pieces of meat with nothing else, unless you pay another $3 for a side dish (rice, fries,...).The food was tasty though (second star), no complaints there, but we won't be returning, that's for sure."
/user_details?userid=51MmfPNbOSZ9obbfJ366mA,Bilal N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,The food is really good. Chicken is tender and the fries are soft and crunchy. The piri was great and added more flavour to the food. The spicy piri sauce is very spicy so I would suggest to try a small portion before jumping in.

/user_details?userid=f8Bd1gr7glnnonDzWiyw1A,Zhao C.,"Laval, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here for lunch with 2 friends and decided to share 2 half chicken meals. We ordered one with their signature spicy sauce (medium heat) and one with their herb and lemon sauce. Things started off a bit on the bad side as we were missing one set of utensils and never got any water, both of which we had to go ask at the counter.All was forgiven after biting into a piece of their spicy Portuguese chicken. The meat was juicy, moist and packed with an amazing amount of flavour. The herb and lemon half was also pretty good, but definitely a bit lackluster compared to the first half with their trademark sauce.   An option of 2 sides for 5$ was also available and we chose fries and rice in both combos. The rice was decent but the fries were a a little disappointing. Overall still a great experience. The prices were ok, maybe a bit expensive compared to other chicken joints. Will definitely visit this restaurant again if I pass by downtown Montreal."

Had a sample of the chicken walking by with their garlic sauce and couldn't resist coming back for a meal. The chicken is super tasty and is of great quality. Their peri fries are also delicious. My new go to chicken spot ! Great food and the prices are very reasonable as well.The staff is also very friendly. The manager made sure to come see us to make sure everything was to out liking which I think is an important touch when you have a new business.

/user_details?userid=9DRiWsAzhbi5-Iu4By3ovA,Katy P.,"Lancaster, PA",5 star rating,"Wow. Snowy white chicken, just the right amount of sauce, spice level is  perfect . I got the quarter chicken breast (medium spiciness) and spicy rice. I think it's more ""spiced"" than ""spicy rice"" since I didn't find it spicy at all, but that isn't to say it wasn't awesome.But the chicken. Oh the chicken. I couldn't even get a picture because when I came back to my senses, I had devoured it all. Insanely tasty! The medium spiciness is spicy enough to give you a kick but you can still taste everything else on the plate.On a more serious note, we didn't realize the waitresses actually do some waiting, so we didn't tip when we paid, but left some in their jar. And the manager is very friendly and helpful!"

/user_details?userid=hxqU0Hz5AoXoy_lajz1UWA,Mike H.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"We came here after a tiring day of on the slopes of Mt. Tremblant, hoping to replenish the great deal of energy that was burnt earlier that day.  For dinner, we ordered the most popular dish on the menu - the Peri Peri chicken. As a second entree, we picked the BBQ spareribs since it was recommended to us by the greeter/owner. On the taste side, the Peri Peri chicken definitely did not disappoint: it was hard to find a piece of meat that is more tender, moist, and most of all, flavorful. Ours also came with a kick, adding to the flavor was a generous rub of hot sauce and spice. The sides that accompanied the entree were more than enough for a starving party of two. But speaking of the BBQ spareribs, I do have my reservations: I did not like the fact that the meat lacked taste, which I found to be mildly flavorful ,and that the meat-to-bone ratio was rather disappointing given it is priced at that of a full-on entree. Nevertheless, I couldn't find a flaw in the star of the day, Peri Peri chicken, and this is why I would come to Grillado's again after a day of skiing."
/user_details?userid=CFB9glegliFCT7dJxdLNsA,Jawad K.,"Saint-Hubert, Canada",3 star rating,"Halal Peri Peri long time awaited ! The menu is very diversified and they offer multiple choices of marination for the chicken ! For those who do not like anything spicy i recommend the lemon/herb seasoning ! The food is good, great place for a group as the offer family platters ! They also do catering and ive personally experienced it ! In restaurant i believe they can do a little better in the presentation of the food ! Dont get me wrong the skewer on your plate is very unique and original but when it come to the chicken something is missing, for example the chiken can be served on a bed of fries instead of just having chicken on one plate and the fries on the other (just feels boring and overcrowds the table) imagine the juice from the seasoning of the chicken over your fries ! How much tastier those chips will be :)!!!"
