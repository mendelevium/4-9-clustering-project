I don't usually enjoy sweet food, but when I do, I DO. The macaroons are the best traditional macaroons I have ever tried here in Montreal. The panna cota gives me 2 AM cravings."
/user_details?userid=PiwaD-WO0u4LFYFv3dX0Qg,Lena C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,The almond chocolatine is to die for!!!Definitely worth a visit if you are in Montreal.
/user_details?userid=Mat6MWQw5VJSINFGXCBukg,Natasha G.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,The macaroons here are better than Laudrée and Pierre Hermé and I'm huge fans of both locations in Paris. I probably went to Christian Faure 5 times while  vacationing in Montréal. Don't skip on the black currant because it's amazing!
/user_details?userid=8BWfRKelDjo-7P_QbQ-Kmg,Helen W.,"Sierraville, CA",5 star rating,"Croissants were an airy delight. Come earlier in the day to ensure a healthy supply of pastry   FOOD:Croissants: Cross section photo says more than words ever could. I did find myself wishing they had infused a tad more butter--while the first bite was divine (compressing the dozens of layers with a bite and watching it all spring back!), subsequent chews revealed the innermost layers to have almost a bready consistency and sheen. Pain au chocolat: the chocolate filling may not be high in volume, but given the richness and darkness, it's sufficient. Almond croissant: lovely filling and flavor. As expected, the almond topping and filling does weigh down the pastry quite a bit, so it looks quite flat compared to its airier plain brethren. Chocolate almond croissant: thankfully not swimming in filling. One of the few successful ones I've tasted in the world in that you can finish one without feeling like you've set a record for sugar consumption. The real hit, however, was the passion fruit, lemon, and raspberry tart, and I wish we had more time in Montreal so we could try more of the desserts here. The filling was the perfect balance of sweet, tropical, and tart and among the smoothest (without being gelatinous) I've ever had. The crust was supportive but did not eclipse the tart flavor (with excessive butter). SERVICE: very polite and nonjudgmental given that it's chic inside and I showed up sweaty in running gear haha. AMBIANCE: Cute cafe space just off the main drag (near Notre Dame) with separate seating line from to go orders. Would love to have brunch or pastry & coffee here with mroe time!"
/user_details?userid=azZdNaUfeb8J9H1k_aoWJQ,Agnes W.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,"Mamie Clafoutis offers a wide range of pastries and desserts. We didn't try much of their bakery items, but opted to try their cakes instead. The first we got as a flan, and the second was a passion fruit and raspberry tart.The flan was pretty basic. Nothing really exceptional about it, but it tasted as it should've.The passion fruit and raspberry tart, however, was very delicious. I really enjoyed the combination of the two fruits and the tart/crust itself was a really nice balance to the filling, not that it was incredibly sweet either."
/user_details?userid=c4lTZbA8NeZBgB1YYB6Izg,Julie C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I absolutely adore their passion fruit raspberry tart! It's not too sweet and it's the perfect summer dessert. I keep coming back for this again and again for many occasions. They write a lovely personalized message on the tart too if you request it. Not a huge fan of everything they make as I find other things a bit too sweet but the tart is to die for. A bit on the pricier side (Approximately $40 before tax for the tart in the photos) but it's simply delicious!
/user_details?userid=VHx_sO7IxZvY3Hnf3-xq9Q,Nina Z.,"East Bay, CA",4 star rating,"Cute and chic patisserie located in Old Montreal. Upon entering, prepare to be amazed by the presentation of the desserts on display. You have two options: wait in line for to go items or sit down and prepare to be served. The professional and efficient wait staff will come around with trays laden with mini-French pastries to choose from.  Unfortunately, we didn't get to spend much time inside since we had to catch a tour, but we did get to try the tarte meringue citron and the strawberry tart with custard. Highly recommend, especially the tarte meringue citron. I can't say how it compares to other Montreal patisseries, but if you're going to be in Montreal, this one is conveniently located and is worth checking out."
/user_details?userid=97YdD8tkMkUSvGUw6_u4GQ,Rebecca C.,"Oakland, CA",5 star rating,"I love this pastry place gem found in one of the most tourist areas in Montreal. Everything was so delicious. And at fantastic value.I had the Coconut gelato with a decaf espresso. The coconut gelato was creamy and decadent. The decaf expresso was perfectly done - just like in Paris or Milan. This was a perfect little stop right before dinner. I also got the super buttery brioche and a chocolate croissants to go. Both pastries are fluffy, light, and airy. My sister, my nieces, and I devoured it within minutes. We will definitely be back!"
/user_details?userid=NNL1zLTP2J_SOputgoPYeQ,Alex L.,"Buffalo, NY",3 star rating,"Decent place for breakfast, but felt that the ""brunch plate"" was a bit overpriced.  It came with a coffee, puffed pastry and a small little baked pastry over smoked salmon + a hollandaise sauce and the whole thing was relatively expensive. While the croissants were airy and the pastries were delicious, I felt the value here was lacking, especially on the sit down side of things. I'd probably come back here for a pastry or two and a coffee, but would avoid coming here hangry for breakfast and seeking a main meal."
/user_details?userid=zV3PESBiRxRHODli1ZlHww,Aline T.,"CA, CA",5 star rating,"Everything here from lunch to dessert was amazing. It was our first food stop in Montreal, so boy did we have high expectations. And this place did not disappoint. The tuna salad was absolutely amazing. It was wonderfully fresh and the dressing was perfect. My husband's dish was also very good. Then when we were ready for dessert, the server simply brings the tray with every single dessert they have to youe table. That may have been one of the hardest decisions of the trip  The tartlete was amazing.....but the mille feuille was my favorite (we went back a second time just for dessert).For amazing French desserts, do not leave this place off your list. You won't regret it."
/user_details?userid=HNrz6Xe7PoLjUp8kBUDykQ,Nick B.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Amazing pastries and amazing coffee. I could eat their croissants by the dozen, I don't think I've been to a patisserie this good in a while."
/user_details?userid=SGnqMkPh2OmOXJV59tzKZg,Steve G.,"Alameda, CA",4 star rating,Popped into Maison Christian Faure while wandering Old Montreal.  It's a little hard to find but worth it.  We were a little tired from walking around so decided to dine in.  Wait staff was very friendly and brought water right away.   Even though we ha just eyed all the desserts we asked for the dessert tray.  Waitress brought over so we could pick.She also answered our questions on what was what so we ordered away.  Everything was so good.  Full of flavor and not overly sweet.  Place isn't cheap but most good bakeries aren't.  I'd recommend a stop if you're in Old Montreal.
/user_details?userid=NZDMASF4sj1jkuvW1lTEbw,Vincent P.,"Great Neck, NY",4 star rating,"From Quebec to New York, my friends and I needed a break. Montreal was on the way so we stopped by here for lunch around 2pm.It was a snowy day. When we walked in, it was almost empty. By the time we left, it was three fourths packed. One friend told me that he tried to come here during the summer but couldn't because it was too packed. I sensed that we lucked out today.I got an espresso and the royal lunch. The espresso was standard I guess. I liked the daily lunch special because it was this croissant stuffed with cheese, some italian style spread, and mozzarella on top with an easy egg on the side and salad. The croissant added a crunch that complemented the cheese and egg. The spread had texture like ground up capers, and its saltiness really brought the whole thing together. I liked that.My friend ordered the kale salad. He was upset that it came with 3 slabs of raw salmon because it wasnt listed on the menu. I didnt care because he gave me that lax.The royal lunch comes with a tray of pastry and you only get to choose one. I saw a waiter describing each pastry to other parties and he was serving us since the beginning so I expected him to do the same for us.But then a French Canadian woman just stepped in and gave the breakdown. My friends loved it but I didn't like the descriptions. They weren't that detailed.This wasn't an issue because I knew what I wanted beforehand - the rasberry passion fruit tart. The tart was really good. Jelly like on top, crumbly berry paste in the inside, encased in a hard shell. Lots of texture. Delightful. If I could, I would come back and order this again.When we were done, we went to the bathroom on 4th floor. It was cool to understand how the patisserie is vertically integrated with its own culinary school, office space, and common area to hold birthday parties. I got to sit on the couch in front of the elevator, and it felt good after filling meal.If I could, I would stick to the pastries and try most of them. If I'm ever in Montreal, I want to come back. I only spent a few hours in Montreal anyway so I'll find a reason to come back, nah mean."
/user_details?userid=AOuRea8Ay7QEJiKbYto_rw,Susan H.,"Oklahoma City, OK",5 star rating,"Absolutely the best croissant and palmier I've ever had. (I've done my share of taste testing throughout Paris and across the US). It was not very busy but I could see it getting that way, they had a line for staying and ""to-go"" They also have packaged goods and the ice cream cake looked incredible too. I also came back and tried a praline macaron, very good!"
/user_details?userid=lGBvmBDeIooqcrMwp1a1yg,Eugene W.,"Boston, MA",3 star rating,"Disappointed given the high reviews for this place...The waitstaff were pretty unfriendly with us (is it because we're Americans??), and neglected to bring water to our table even after we asked them. We tried a chocolate and a passionfruit tart. They were both a little too sweet. The crunchy outer shell and the cream within were pretty good, but the steep price of around $9 CAD for each small tart was rather ridiculous."
/user_details?userid=gRTJX1byUA31E0OBqfYPIw,Veronica C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"An aesthetically pleasing dessert spot in Old Montreal! They have a variety of French pastries and desserts to choose from. I got the Savarin agrume chantilly tart, Milles feuilles, Lemon tart, Éclairs, Mont blanc & Raspberry passion fruit tart!

/user_details?userid=JpqpWvBQnJREquIQKvLfHQ,Kimmy U.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"Wasn't a huge fan of this place! It's in a great location in Old Montreal near the water, but didn't have quite the cozy cafe feel I was hoping for.We came in to escape the cold for a bit. There's a lovely display of their pastries and desserts when you walk in and you can either stand in line for take out or sit down. They also serve brunch and have a separate menu for that. If you're sitting for pastries, they bring you a huge tray of what is available that day so you can look for yourself instead of walking back and forth to the display case at the front. But they didn't have all the options like the croissants and macarons :( We ended up getting two drinks and desserts- Americano: standard- Hot chocolate: really good! but gets sweet after a while. I definitely cannot finish this on my own- Vanilla layered pastry: The pastry puff layers were not crunchy.. it seemed like it was sitting in the refrigerator for too long. But the vanilla cream tasted nice and wasn't too sweet, which we appreciated- Pistachio macaron: again, not fresh.. it was too chewy! texture was as if I kept them in the refrigerator and ate them the next day or two... very disappointed!Wouldn't recommend or come back here.. There's so many other bakeries in Montreal to try!"
/user_details?userid=CxDOIDnH8gp9KXzpBHJYXw,Jennifer K.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"Dessert Pastries for Breakfast? Why not? I am on vacation in Montreal after all!This is the second Maison Christian Faure location we visited. The first time at Downtown location where we got a cold shoulder as the lone staff was busy on the phone after we stood there looking at the pastries for a few minutes, so we just left.Luckily we decided to give this Old Port location a try and was pleasantly surprised by the hospitality even when the salon was busy.For Breakfast, we ordered:Passion Fruit and Raspberry Tart: Crispy sweet tart shell with raspberry coulis and mousseline cream with passion fruit- Pretty to look at and if you looking for a more refreshing taste, this is a perfect choice!Chocolate and Almond Croissant: Traditional French pastries with almonds and almond cream, made in soft butter and organic flour, with TWO chocolate bars.- so flaky and buttery and every bite was a satisfying as the whole pastry was filled with tons of almond and chocolate! I am sad since I could not able to enjoy this high quality pastry in Toronto on a daily bases but I am happy that I could enjoy them whenever I visit Montreal."
/user_details?userid=II_EorS1cIKuGSY_YR6-2g,Kevin F.,"Irvine, CA",5 star rating,Excellent pastry shop.  I had a rasperry macaron as well as a caneles de Bordeaux.  The macaron had a perfect texture and was delicious and the canceles de Bordeaux I have never had.  It tasted similar to a cooked pancake with hints of rum and vanilla.  Very good.  Wish I would have tried more pastries but it was my last day in Montreal and I had to make sure that I at least stopped and tried something.  This is a definite must to try if in Montreal!

As it is just steps away from my hotel, I decided to give it a try. I am not a fan of sandwich, so this review is not bias at all. We ordered a smoke salmon sandwich and Millie feuille tradition (cake) for our lunch. The portion of the sandwich is kinda small, but comes with lots of chips to fill you up. As a person who don't like sandwich, my first impression was ""meh"". However, after the first bite, it turns my impression to ""wow"". The sandwich is so good. Also the cake is impressive, love the overall texture of the cake.  I would probably be back for the cake for dessert, the sandwich is great, but small portion."
/user_details?userid=KQSRUu4Aapl0hG6eu2v8iw,Lizzie S.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"Very cute place to dine-in or take food and drink to-go with warm service.I loved the atmosphere and the decor of Maison Christian Faure. They have a wide variety of baked goods that they bake there on-site, and I loved seeing the trays being brought out. You can also peek into the kitchen and see them being made. Yelp said there'd be a wait but when I went in mid-afternoon, there was a slight line but it was really not much of a wait. I tried the lemon tarte and got other goods to-go for others like chocolate croissants, caramel pot, and chocolate pot. The lemon tarte was just the right mix of tart and sweet. Would definitely recommend as a fun afternoon tea break if you're near Old Montreal."
/user_details?userid=dKKvpFh7QrplB3e0EEh8Rg,Rebecca T.,"San Marcos, CA",4 star rating,"Most of the desserts that we tried were amazing, but I don't think it's worth waiting for more than an hour for. If the wait is 30 mins, maybe OK.Given the wait was long and the place was packed, the service was still pretty friendly. Funny thing was how a dude behind the pastries window kept asking people in line a party of how many, like he asked me probably 5 times and I had to keep saying trois trois trois monsieur! He wasn't impolite in any way though. I think he just wanted everyone to be seated ASAP.Once they cleared the table for us, we were seated about 30 mins later. There was a menu for drinks and actual food, but the desserts were shown in a sample tray where you got to look at the real thing (which were sitting out for the entire day so don't grab it and put it on your plate lol). After a detailed description and some recommendation from our friendly waiter, we got some chocolate stuff and the classic lemon meringue. Everything was delightful, especially the chocolate mousse with almond flavor! The lemon meringue was just what you would expect for a good lemon meringue. Some people are crazy about their macarons, so I gotta try some too - the cassis (blackcurrant) and pistachio flavors for me. I gotta say they're good but nothing spectacular so it's not like I would order 10 dozens to go...Overall the desserts were delicious but they weren't anything spectacular, and the crowded space made us hard to relax. If we pass by (who knows when) and if there isn't a long line, I'd go in and get a chocolate mousse again!"

My favorite salad is the Niçoise and they did it perfectly to my taste. Thick slabs of tuna, fresh crisp butter lettuce, not too much dressing, so refreshing!! Then I had to do a dessert (they will bring a tray out). Decided on almond tart and it did not disappoint. It wasn't too sweet and all the flavors and textures worked so well together. Will get a few others to bring home to Toronto ."

/user_details?userid=EiOpKhajB06Z-GF4iyquUw,Kevin N.,"Chula Vista, CA",3 star rating,"Definitely on the pricier side, obviously it's in downtown Old Montreal (go figure). When we went, they were 10 min til closing. We didn't have the opportunity to eat inside. Though, the staff was friendly to take our orders, but you could tell they were ready to jet. Traffic sucks, so I understand why they were dreading with their facial expressions. We bought three desserts, adds up to $24 CAD. We ordered a strawberry cream in a glass jar, a vanilla berry log (almost like an eclair), and a passion fruit mini tart. Petite, beautifully made and crafted, and creative. The vanilla berry eclair was my least favorite but it was the most eloquent looking one. Passion fruit had a strong passion fruit taste. The cream jar one was very delicate yet satisfying."
/user_details?userid=RxL3KOklOuN-j10w-nrWpw,Shirley B.,"Austin, TX",4 star rating,"If you're wandering around the Vieux Montreal neighborhood and you've got a hankering for desserts, Maison Christian Faure is a great pit stop. Food: We opted for dessert. If you eat in, you'll walk past several cases filled with delectable delights. Don't fret. Your waitress will bring over a tray of goodies right to your table so you'll have up close and personal viewing to help you make a selection, or two, or three! We went for the flan, a strawberry mousse and chocolate cake, a mango and passion fruit mouse tart with a chocolate coin topper. They were all unique and equally delicious. Mousses were soft, light, fluffy. Tart shells were crumbly when you cut into it. Flan was the perfect consistency. Service: You'll walk up into the seating area and you'll be seated by waitstaff. We were waited on pretty quickly and dessert was out not long after our lattes hit the table. Cost: Two lattes and three dessert items ran us about CAD$42 after tax. Overall: The space can be a bit tight as there's a line for take out and a line for eat in, but for those getting in and out, you'll have to squeeze into one of those lines. It can get loud inside when it's busy due to acoustics, and it can feel a bit claustrophobic at some tables. But the desserts are great so if you can manage the above, give it a try. Cash and cards accepted."

I also had their iced tea, but I didn't like since it tasted like passion fruit flavor (Note: The drink menu didn't specify the tea flavor or anything).I thought service was fine when we dined in. The server brought out the dessert tray and explained the dessert choices. BTW, they will give you a drink menu once seated, but there's no dessert menu to look at. We stayed here for an hour since we were taking cover from the rain and researching for things to do in Montreal (Note: They have free WiFi here).I'll return again one day. It was a lovely dessert cafe."

We were seated immediately at 5PM on a Monday evening.Ordered a house made ice tea and hot chocolate with whipped cream (both delicious - especially loved the iced tea, which had a perfect hint of sweetness to it), and the waitress brought over an enormous plate of pastries for us to choose from in lieu of a menu.We picked out the raspberry passion fruit tart (thanks Yelp) and mille feuille (my weakness) to share. Both were shockingly good, as I wasn't expecting that much given that most bakeries don't have many fresh goods by the afternoon. The tart was just the right combination of acidity from the passion fruit and raspberry, cut by sweetness from the mousseline cream and richness from the crust. Mille feuille layers were super crispy, which has to be a rare feat given that there's no way it was freshly made, and the filling had a fantastic subtle sweetness. Simple and perfect.Luckily for our cholesterol we came here on the last day, or we would've been tempted to eat our way through the menu.Greatness is not cheap, as the two drinks and two desserts came to around $35 CAD, but definitely well worth it in my books."

My boyfriend and I came by to have some coffee and try some of their beautiful pastries which did not disappoint. We ended up getting three macrons, a passionfruit tart and a mille feuille to accompany our lattes. The macrons (passionfruit, pistachio + praline) had perfect texture however, we felt as though the flavors were a little too subtle for our liking. The passionfruit tart was bright and had louder flavors that were pleasant but we both agreed that our favorite dessert of the day was the mille feuille. It had just the right amount of cream and was light, which we appreciated. While the pastries are a little more expensive than your usual desserts, I think the experience itself is worth a try."
/user_details?userid=ooHF-vRzlkyN9UEVMKocAQ,Mercedes C.,"Bronx, NY",5 star rating,"I noticed these folks immediately before heading to an early dinner and set myself up for having Dessert here instead.This spot is a totally different bag of chips from their sister Boulevard de Maisonneuve location: there's a pastry school here on one of the floors and Café on another. Just the vibe alone, this location actually seems more ""formal"" with a café flair, small tables, a delicious Dessert Menu and wonderful table service. While the other location over at Maisonneuve, you order from the counter and has a lounge-y type feel. Entrance here though, leads you right upstairs- giving you a sneak peak to their kitchen at the same time. And then- just then....you smell Butter, Vanilla and Chocolate in the air. There's a short wait- but don't give up, pastries here are worth the time and money. Heads up guys and double check.....(unless it's changed from the last several months I was here)- this location offers a quick nosh menu up to a certain time of the day. After that, it's strictly a Dessert Menu...so I was all in!!!Decided on a Chestnut Mousse pastry with the most sinful amount of butter in that shortbread crust. My Hot Chocolate or Hot Cocoa (not sure which), had strength and thickness in every sip.Service was excellent the short time we were there. Again- it's the pleasantries that I love about Montréal! I'd come back for Dessert again in a heartbeat."
/user_details?userid=HkKyQY5bh57z7vhmFAZj5w,Amanda L.,"Scarborough, Canada",4 star rating,Stopped by here when visiting Montreal for a mid- day snack before heading home.We came the night before at around 6pm but the dining area was already closed for the night (the dining area closes one hour before the store closes)We opted for a pastry tray of desserts ($8.50) this is where they bring you the whole tray to pick from. It was def hard to choose as they all looked tasty.I opted for a mango tart that was filled with white chocolate and creme brule. The tart was to die for! The tart was nice and light (not too buttery) and blended together with the soft fluffy mango chocolate creme brule cake on top. There was also some bits of chocolate crunch on the side to give the cake more texture. I also purchased some croissants to-go. Which were delicious as well. My favs were def the chocolate croissant ($3.20) and the almond chocolate croissant ($3.20). The plain butter ones ($3) were good as well. The place is suuper cute and a great place for a mid-day treat in the area!
/user_details?userid=vCUeFAY774VtmpszX9hyGA,Nataly N.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"I probably would have had a better experience picking up some pastries to-go, as opposed to dining in. Service was a mixed bag from various staff members, and ended up being a bit slow and sloppy throughout our brunch experience. I was also initially told they were out of a pastry I really wanted, even though there were a few sitting in the window... not sure what happened there. While the latte I ordered was sub-par and pricey, the quality of the pastries was generally good. My sister and I ended up with a Pâté Croute to share, as well as 4 pastries: Mont-blanc, Mango Mousse Tart, Framboisette, and Harlequin. Flavor-wise, I loved the Mont-blanc, with its chestnut cream and gelée de cassis. It tasted a bit booze-y, which was awesome. The other pastries were also good - but some had tart shells that were a bit too solid such that I accidentally sent a piece flying when trying to break off a piece of the mango tart with my spoon. We got there in the early afternoon, so the pastry selection was probably reduced by that point. I would probably recommend checking this place out earlier in the day, and would recommend taking out rather than dining in."

I stopped by at 8AM right after opening and it seemed like they weren't really prepared yet to start. The glass cases were mostly empty & they didn't have all the selection that I've seen in other pictures. Things I enjoyed: - Almond Chocolate croissant: I really enjoyed this! It wasn't too sweet at all and it just tasted so decadent. - Lemon tart: really nice lemon flavor & the meringue on top was good too. Things that were just okay: - Coffee eclair: I felt like the cream didn't taste that much like coffee. - Macarons: Like another reviewer said, it wasn't as fresh as it could have been. I feel like Maison Christian Faure is just outshined by other, more innovative patisseries in Montreal."

I prefered some to others but that is definitely according to personal taste and not to the quality of the pastires themselves. Wow!!!!!My fav were the Montblanc, the passionfruit tart and the chocolate mousse cake, I tried a lot of different ones and those stood out the most in term of balance between sweet, tangy and bitterThis is such a great place for a lunch/dessert/coffee date or just-bring-your-mom-on-a-sunday-and-talk-about-aunt-Daisy's-new-beau kind of thing.

/user_details?userid=wABHp4fGUC-0acRKhmQO2A,Diana X.,"Seattle, WA",2 star rating,"It's probably okay for being in a touristy area, and the desserts are beautiful to look at. However, if you're willing to venture beyond the tourist spots/Old Montreal there are definitely plenty of better patisseries.First, the food. At first sight, I was excited and plagued by decision anxiety. Everything looked so beautiful and delicious. Eventually I settled on the ""eclair Paris brest"", which came recommended by some article I was browsing when trying to find some bakeries in Montreal. This was not great - I've actually had better in nice bakeries found in NYC and Philadelphia. The pastry tasted slightly freezer burnt and moist, as if it had been frozen and defrosted. The cream lacked flavor, even though it had a nice whipped texture. The candied hazelnuts were probably the highlight.Second, the seating. The place was small, but largely empty - save for a single table occupied by a parent and her child. I was actually not planning to sit and eat, but I had a backpack and placed it on a table while I was grabbing a glass of water after making my purchase. One of the employees began eyeing me, and I felt like I was doing something inappropriate. She said something along the lines of  ""The sit-down prices are different from the to-go items"" - I'm not exactly sure what she was trying to convey, but I took that to mean I wasn't allowed to sit down unless I planned on ordering from the sit-down menu. A slightly more apologetic tone or something to break the ice of this awkward policy could have helped - instead, it was Neiman Marcus meets tourist trap. I wasn't dressed shabbily, nor was I unfriendly. One of the few restaurant experiences I've had where upon trekking over and giving them some business, I was immediately made to feel taken for granted.So pass. I second the opinions of Yelpers about the lackluster pastry, on top of the misplaced attitude. It's not for me, although they've certainly streamlined the business to serve large crowds. They even sell their baked goods on their website and in other locations. It's efficient and brisk business, but I'm interested in another kind. After sampling multiple patisseries around Montreal, there's a multitude of friendlier, better options, where the baked goods are probably less frenetically produced on a large scale and you can taste the artistry."
/user_details?userid=KE4aIUuvl8p2BABubh0cdw,Daisy Y.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Let's be honest about this right off the bat: this place is expensive.  Half a dozen macarons is $18. The millefeuille is over $8, the lemon tart almost $7. That being said,  once you have eaten the pastries here,  you will agree that it is worth every darn penny. The macarons are amazing.  Light.  Fluffy. Generously filled with smooth filljng with a dollop of fruit in the centre if you order a fruity macaron (mango-passion was my favorite,  followed by the raspberry). The millefeuille? OMG. I cannot sing enough praises for the millefeuille. Flaky,  buttery layers  bursting with a creamy custard middle. My tastebuds died and went to heaven.  Then the  lemon tart. Tart, yet with a subtle sweetness.  The meringue was perfection, sweet, light,  it was like eating a cloud. However,  the chocolates I bought ($16 for a small bag of truffles,  yeesh) was pretty disappointing. Loved how creamy it was,  but it didn't taste like $16 chocolate and expected more than it to be rolled in passionfruit sprinkles.So now you're wondering how I can declare this the best bakery ever,  yet give it 4 stars? Well,  I guess price is a big factor.  The service was ok; the girl working that day did not make me feel very welcomed. If you don't order a drink,  they have infused water for you to quench your thirst."

The overall experience was amazing. We were seated by the window each time and ordered a drink as well. The pastries were all surprisingly original in their own ways and totally worth the price for the taste and the experience!

I was just about to ask them where they got them when I looked a little past them and saw the sign for Maison Christian Faure. I made an IMMEDIATE bee-line for the door. When I walked in I knew I was gonna love the place. Beautiful, intricate sugar sculptures were showcased around cases of the most magical looking tarts, pastries, croissants, etc. I was overwhelmed. I wanted it all! I picked up a few packaged sugar cookies to take home to my husband and mom (they also love a good bakery) and made a line for the case. I will agree with a few reviewers that stated that it was a bit confusing at first but the staff was helpful and let me roll with the change in venue (I was originally going to take it to go but realized it would be easier to eat in). Typically one sits down at a table and they bring you a menu as well as a tray of the day's cakes and such. I kind of wish I had gone this route, so they could have told me what each treat was, but I just picked one from the case and they delivered it to me at the table, along with my cookies nicely packaged in a bag to go.The tart I selected was the passion fruit, mango tart with caramel. I sent my mom a pictured with the caption ""It's so good I almost cried."" She responded, ""so emotional."" I said, ""I get very emotional over baked goods."" Which is true! I can't get enough of a delicious treat. It's like, next level happiness to me. So here I was. Enjoying an incredible french sweet and living my Parisian bakery dream. Regrets? I have many. That I didn't come back every day I was here? That I didn't' get more to go? That I didn't get a blasted croissant? Don't make my mistakes. Get everything. You won't regret it!"

Salade niçoise is delicious here, so make sure you try it at least once. The real star, however was their quiche. Yes - real men DO eat quiche, thank you very, very much... This was way different than any two-bit quiche I had ever tried before. This was a velvety smooth quiche snuggled into a rich, buttery, and flaky pastry. Worth every cent and worth every bite. The side salad that came with the quiche was also high quality, not some wilted mess coated in bland dressing - this salad was vibrant, flavorful, and fresh.

Even though I'm not a huge fan of chocolate cakes, I couldn't help but scarf this down. I also got a mango tart. The mousse was delicious. The cross section was gorgeous - between the mango flavours and the mousses and creams. The tart was firm but also not too hard to cut with a fork. I came here for the macarons!

I am usually not a dessert over a meal kind of person - but this pastry shop could change that notion - right quick or ""toute de suite"".""Par excellence"" and a bunch of other high end ""haute de gamme"" French expressions come to mind when describing this boutique in Old Montreal (they also have a Downtown location - for more central access to their decadences).I read Chef Christian Faure's bio (numerous awards and accolades) and was more than impressed. It's sweetly obvious this gentleman knows pastry. They even have a school teaching others to create the ultimate in goodies. I mean who wouldn't want to have a means to prepare tasty treats like they offer - in your own home or Chez vous.Let's just say in most cases I stick up for value above highly priced items, but we'll give the 3 bucks-a-piece Macarons a ""price pass"" this time. The exquisite factor more than makes up for it. It's like a magic taste wand.The box even comes with a neat printed paper belt which distinguishes their Macarons from any run-of-the-mill-wannabe-delicious-treats.They were a huge hit as a thank you gift, and disappeared as fast as you could say ... not-your-average-everyday-run-of-the-mill-wannabe-delicious-treats.Side note: The staff where in no way pretentious, as I thought - hmm, this is definitely the kind of place where you may expect to find pinky fingers pointing upwards.

/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Mon dieu that was delicious pastry!As someone who loves sweets I have been dying to try Maison Christian Faure, a pastry shop in Old Montreal.  Christian Faure is a meilleur ouvrier de France so how could his pastries not be wonderful?  Well the opportunity to visit this fine establishment finally presented itself so I jumped at it.The shop is pretty large and it feels kind of sparse.  That being said there was some soft music in the background which helped give it some ambiance. It also helps that it is filled with aromas of fresh-baked pastries.  You have the option to sit down and order food or take something to go.  In addition to pastries they also serve main meals and sandwiches.  There is also a variety of sweets like marshmallows available for purchase.  Now I was in need of lunch so I ordered a quinoa salad which I enjoyed very much.  It was very refreshing and I still had plenty of room for dessert, because coming here and not getting one would be sacrilege.  All the pastries look so tempting but I finally decided on a chocolate mousse with raspberry topping.  It was so elegantly prepared that I was almost scared to eat it.  Doing that though would have denied me a wonderful experience.  The mousse was airy and the flavours were very well balanced.  I was very happy with my choice.The price tag is a little steep.  A pastry runs for $8.50 and my lunch came to about $32 before tip.  Once in a while it's fun to treat yourself to an experience like this but I couldn't see myself coming here all the time because it would add up pretty quickly.For the most part service is attentive and friendly.  I was seated very quickly and the waitress knew the menu very well and was able to describe all the dessert items in detail.  My food came quickly.  The only minor hiccup I had was that it was difficult to get refills on my water.If you're a sweet tooth then you must come here.  While the main dishes are pretty good the main attraction is the pastries which are some of the best in the city.  Their creations are bound to satisfy even the most discerning palate."

The quiche had ham and bacon and was one of the best I had. Fluffy egg, flaky crust (not at all burnt), and well seasoned.  Got the Cappuccino which was very small for $4.50. That said, with the addition of sugar it was very tasty. I opted for a dessert which was a almond cake with an apricot mousse on top, really good. My bill was $26.90...$3.90 more than the special (no biggie). Anyway, the lunch menu isn't large, but this place is well worth the visit. I'm sure you'll find an entree, and guarantee you'll find a tasty pastry. You'll even find retail items for purchase (spreads, marshmallows, ice cream). FYI- the bathroom is on the 4th floor."

Picked this place based on high Yelp ratings. Staff bordered on rudeness at entrance and did not bother to greet even. Took a while before we were seated and given menus and even longer for someone to take orders. Eventually after we got our drinks and waitress came around with a pastry tray. We ordered and then watched as our pastries sat at a nearby table for 10 minutes before we had to ask someone to bring them over. This would have all been overlooked if the pastries were good but they were awful. We had the madeleines which were dry and hard and had to be dipped into drinks to make them edible. The rum baba (I think it was called), a round cake soaked in a syrup that was excessively sweet and tasted of uncooked rum was totally inedible, we were not even asked why this was not eaten. Will not be back. Much better on offer at chain bakeries on same street"

Breakfast here looked light but was quite heavy! I got the goat cheese zucchini quiche. Came with a great little salad at brunch. We also enjoyed espressos and ended the meal with some great little desserts. The only thing keeping this from a 5 was the rather confused waitstaff - everyone was helping everyone which was cool until no one was helping anyone and multiple tables were waiting on their checks. And the almost-too-hard crust on my tart.. it was really rough to eat. But delicious. So I would still go back.

It has a distinctive French appeal, a fresh and lively ambiance and the food and pastries are scrumptious!  It is a true French patisserie as well as a school. Yes, apparently Christian Faure is a master pastry chef and the building houses the cafe, the school as well as a charming event space upstairs. We shared a club sandwich that literally melted in your mouth, followed by a mango tiramisu which was delicious. The Americana coffee was strong just the way we like it. The kitchen closes at 3:00pm so get there before then. We just made it and were the last to be served lunch. Pastries however are still available.

We came here for an afternoon snack after hitting a couple tourist spots in Ville Marie. Upon entering, we were motioned to take a seat anywhere (it was pretty packed with may be 3 open tables, so we took one). Someone will come around with a plate of pastries and will answer any questions you have about each. This is super informative and professional.I got the yuzu eclair, which I've been missing since Paris, and my cousin strawberry cake. The cream on and inside the eclair was pretty solid, though can get overwhelming (3.5 stars?), but the eclair itself.. so, so, dry and disappointing. Sure, the cream somewhat compensates? but the texture was just off. The strawberry cake, however, was even more of a let down - the cream was way too overwhelmingly sweet that it almost tasted artificial, though the airy texture was there, and the cake was also so dry that it tasted like it came from an overbaked box mix.Each pastry I believe was ~$6, unacceptable for the quality. We also waited ~45min from when we asked for the check to when we received our change (we gave a 20). We had to ask our waiter for the change, and it turned out that he had completely forgotten about/lost our change. Sure they were busy, so let's keep the 2 stars.Needless to say, we won't be back."

I won't lie, I was really excited about this place from shots of the sweets they have, but unfortunately it did not live up to the hype. When we went there they almost ran out of everything, so I had very little options I could try. I ordered some kind of tart with jam and cream on top. It tasted below average and 100% not worth the price asked. Tried other stuff my family ordered and wasn't impressed as well. How to put it...I was more impressed with the tea they served than their own goods. On the plus side service was good. Maybe they have better things to try on a good day when it's not so crowded, but I won't be there to try and I won't even bother next time I visit Montreal."
/user_details?userid=J7MKUNS_xFDdbQQilI9v1g,Marco M.,"Irvine, CA",3 star rating,"We live in California and my wife and I are fluent in both French (French ""French educated"") and English - having lived in the US for 45 years. This was our first visit together to Montreal with our two teenage daughters. We read a lot how wonderful this bakery is before our trip and decided to head for it on our first breakfast in town.  We ordered 3 pastries, a croissant, and a ""pain au chocolat"". My wife being gluten intolerant ordered nothing.  These are our observations:1. Wait time: there was not much traffic at the store and we were seated within a couple of minutes. The waitress (a young African American, I am not being a racist here, just giving a description to assist the manager in providing proper training to the right person) was cold and not very welcoming. Score: 3 Stars2. Order: it took at least 15 minutes for the waitress to come to our table to take our order. We first requested water (they bring you these half-full glasses (about 4 oz of water) that they never refill; we discovered that in Canada, ice water is a very rare commodity. When it was time to take our order, the waitress (a young, short and ""grosse"" woman who thinks she is bilingual (with very strong accents in French and English) and a very condescending and rude attitude tried to describe to us how to place an order. She brought to the table a tray of pastries and with her strong accent, tried to describe what each pastry is made of! She was so sure of herself and we were trying to make sense of the words she was pronouncing! Most of the customers were English speakers, and a menu with pictures would have been much better. In any case we just tried to place the order as quickly as we could so we cannot see her face anymore!  Score 2 Stars. 3. Food selection: we went there for breakfast after we have had coffee; so my observation is only for breakfast ""viennoiseries"". Their selection is extremely limited compared to what you expect to find in a French bakery. We are very familiar with French bakeries in Europe, and this bakery is no match in this area. The selection is extremely limited, albeit the taste and texture of the items we ordered were great. In summary: selection=3 Stars, taste=5 Stars; Price=4 Stars. 4. Checking out: a young man with a great smile and engaging personality approached us at the end to see if we needed anything. We asked for the bill which he brought few minutes later. At that time I told him that he saved the moment with his contagious smile. He was thankful and appreciative about my comment and he spoke great French without any accent (at the end, we discovered he was originally from Algeria). Score=5 Stars5. Summary: we understand our experience could have been much better if the staff was properly trained and cared about customer satisfaction. When you have a poorly mannered waitress dealing with you, it is enough to cut your appetite! As such, we have decided this is our first and will be our last experience at this place. Later in the day, we tried a gluten-free bakery ""Le Marquis"" and both the selection and the service were 5 Stars.  One more reason to never go back to the Maison Christian Faure located at 355 Royale Place!"

It was one of the few times I have felt tempted to try the desserts just because they looked so good.

Light but highly flavored and enough for both of us to share for a light lunchMy wife really loved the dessert pastry because it was very light and was not very sweet . The pastries were all so colorful and variety of tastes as it contained different fruit, custard, cream chocolate combinations. We actually came the next day and bought about a dozen croissants, pastries and cakes to bring home to US for the kids .... kids did not get to sample couple as ate them in the car on the journeyService - staff was friendly as they were willing to explain what was in each item and the relative sweetness.

Even though every dessert looked exquisite, I decided on a chocolate mousse cake topped with raspberry mousse with a  raspberry jelly center, and a latte. My latte was delicious and creamy with nice, thick foam. The cake was fantastic. It had a hard coconut(?) crumbly base  which was the perfect compliment to the rich creamy mousse. It was the perfect size too. Service was very friendly and helpful.I think this is a nice little ""treat yo self"" experience. Must try!"

When we finished our meal, she took our  dishes away, and didn't come back with the bill and no one came around our table for us to flag. We waited probably 20 minutes and didn't see her again. We got up to pay at the counter instead and another server asked us if WE had asked for the bill. Well, we tried but no one came by!

Is it his title: Meilleur Ouvrier de France (MOF)? The swanky décor? The Old Montreal location? The price points? Because, there is no reason related to artistry and craftsmanship that this patisserie isn't rated even higher than it is... on yelp, google, all the democratic rating sites...You'll find all kinds of elegant classic French pastries along with seasonal desserts at Maison Christian Faure (MCF) - classic in the sense that they are viewed through the master patissier's interpretation. Two that I'll bring up: Millefeuille and Paris Brest. So, Jacques Genin in Paris is reputed to have the best version of millefeuille around, benefiting texturally from the fact that it's made-to-order. MCF's version is pretty fantastic, and stayed in my memory after many months. But, I don't think I've had better Paris-Brest in my life. I must confess, I've never been a fan of Paris-Brest thinking it to be sickeningly sweet and way too rich for my liking, but the Paris-Brest éclair at MCF with hazelnut praline filling is definitively the best version I've had. There's tremendous attention to detail on each element and how they work together, including the candied hazelnuts.I also have to thank Maison Christian Faure for reviving my love for French pastry. Hard that it may be to imagine, I went through a 1.5-2 year period not enthused by desserts, or indeed any French style bakery in the U.S. But, the first bite I had of Le Miami at MCF, it all came back. What better pastry to remind one of the magic of French patisseries! Lightly sweet cookie crust, almond cream, lime cream, raspberry jelly, and fresh raspberries. I normally don't stop eating dessert to take multiple pictures of it while I progress further, but every few bites or so I had to remind myself to store memories of a new pleasurable sensation!The other pastry I enjoyed thoroughly was Le Venitien (hazelnut cake, crunchy hazelnut praline, lemon mousse, and confit). While a few months later, the winter collection featured an excellent Croustillant de Pralin (a crunchy dark chocolate pastry with praline and hazelnuts) reminding me of the pastry chef's facility with all the featured ingredients.As you can sense the artistry, I was determined to read more about Faure and his philosophy, and really liked something he'd said: ""No one walks into a patisserie starving. They simply want a treat. You eat pastry for pleasure and happiness... each pastry should be an experience"". I couldn't agree more. I also love his discipline in staying away from becoming a factory like operation, for not carrying cupcakes just because they are ubiquitous or following a food fashion trend like the cronut. Faure is an absolute master of his craft: I tried six different things and there wasn't anything I didn't like - including chocolate sable cookies that are rolled in sugar to give the effect of sparkling diamonds!"

We could have just finished waiting in line at that point.Aside from the chaos on the way in, everything else was amazing. I had an amazing chocolate pot de creme and an americano. I would have stuck around for some macaroons, but everything was just taking too long and we needed to get moving. Pro Tip: The bathroom is up the elevator on the 4th floor."
/user_details?userid=RsIjAqN88VE_uRmDE1PBnQ,Nauman B.,"Atlanta, GA",5 star rating,I actually wanna give them 1 star for being so unbelievably good yet not being in my hometown atlanta. I guess that isn't fair so a 5 star is due for their out of this world culinary dessert marvels.I'm not a dessert fanatic but this place can give a diabetic reason to forgo their sugar intake check. I can hardly recommend anything. We literally tried 6 items and each was just unique and great in its own. The building houses two floors of pastry school right on top of this beautiful restaurant.To make it even sweeter the staff is just very humble. It's better to go in between meal times as it can get super busy. We went in accidentally after lunch and were seated right away. Of course deciding which dessert to order was probably more difficult than learning to fly a plane. But just to throw out some recommendations the chocolate almond croissant is probably the best I've ever had. Of course don't even think about leaving without trying their raspberry tart. Don't know how they made it but it's cold like sorbet in the center yet the tart shell and cream on top blends the whole dessert so beautifully. They have a wide variety of food items too but unfortunately we could only savor their desserts and coffees. So which ever restaurant you dine at just remember to skip dessert and rush to this sweet heaven.

We had the most delightful lunch here! The salmon sandwich is the best thing here -- comes with a poached egg and perfect smoked salmon with dill on a buttered (or mayoed?) bun. Their lobster & crab sandwich was good too, but I felt like the salmon was more satisfying. They show you a dessert tray for you to choose -- I chose a passion fruit & raspberry tart which was delicious. Also got a box of macarons to go! LOVED the lighting in this cafe and the simple decor. Huge ceiling-to-floor windows. Perfect for instagramming. Note: - Bathroom is on the 4th floor. - You pay at the front (even if you are dining in). - Macarons come in box of 6 or 12"

And let me tell you that I was very much looking forward to the day that I would be in a patisserie of a MOF (Meilleur Ouvrier de France). Quiet day in Old Montreal and this place was one of the few open shops when we came. Sneak a peek downstairs and you can see croissants proofing. The entrance just smells wonderful. The displays are perfect and organized. All staff are bilingual. You can choose a table to sit at, and the staff comes with a tray of pastries and desserts with a description of each. This seemed like a nice service...however after placing our order, we requested water as our drink and the female staff rolled her eyes! While waiting for our order, a male staff comes with the same tray and asked what we wanted. I clearly said, ""We already ordered."" and he proceeds to question what I want and I was quite confused at this point. He wasn't nice about it either and kept pressing. Then the female staff notices what is happening and tells her co-worker in French that we have already ordered. Desserts are fairly priced and what you would typically expect for a higher end bakery/patisserie. Croissants were crispy on the outside, soft and had a nice distribultion of air bubbles on the inside. Flan was very smooth and not too sweet or eggy. The eclair Paris-Brest was absolutely amazing. The hazelnut cream, with the hazelnuts and choux pastry was heavenly. Treat yourself! The pastries get 6 stars. All in all, terrible service for such a nice establishment in a touristic area and it wasn't even busy that day. Such a shame because the pastries are amazing."

Also for pastries, got a crunchy hazelnut lemon rectangular thing, and raspberry tart with rose whipped cream. Got the cappuccino for drink, the almond slice for danish, and smoked salmon for the eggs benedict. The almond slice danish was so delightful. Flaky and buttery, and not overly sweet. The eggs benedict was well done, I want to try the ham version another time. Loved the sweet brioche french toast with caramel. For pastries, I really enjoyed the raspberry tart and was less into the hazelnut lemon one. But that's just personal preference. Everything here was very well executed!! I would certainly come back."

The server was so impatient with us, didn't pay any attention at all to our table, and took forever to flag down. It seemed as if every time she interacted with us, she was in a hurry to get away instead of focusing on helping us. For example, when we decided to order some cakes, she brought the tray to us and said nothing about what was on it. We had to point at specific cakes and ask for a description to which she gave us a curt and impatient response. I was even more disappointed to find out that they sold the last almond croissants of the day (when I spotted 2 of them when we came in) which was due to the extremely slow service. Even when we received our food, their body language was screaming ""Eat and get out.""

I was a tad thrown off when I walked in because I was expecting a small café-type shop, but it was a weird mix of a shop on the left, a kitchen/pastry school underneath, a patisserie in the middle and restaurant seating on the right where they serve you actual lunch and breakfast foods, not just dessert. It was designed really well though, I liked it.Anyway, we sat in the restaurant area and ordered chocolat chaud (best I've had in Canada to date), regular coffee (didn't try, but was told it was very good) and shared a croustillant de pralin. The little chocolate pastry was mouth-watering and I couldn't get enough. (I didn't really want to share, but I kind of had to...) There was no one at the café when we got there, so it was very quiet and warm, and the people working there were kind and attentive. It was exactly what we needed after walking around a cold, snowy Vieux-Montréal all morning.So that great dessert experience then prompted us to buy macarons (cassis, mangue-passion, pistache, praliné, chocolat and noix de coco - all perfectly made and very flavorful), canalé (just as it should be) and meringue café et amandes and this awesome-looking chocolate/hazelnut dessert spread thing we have yet to try.Long story short, this place is awesome and if I'm ever in Montréal again, I will mostly be sleeping and eating here for the duration of my visit."
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Located by the waterfront in Old Port, Maison Christian Faure is naturally bound to have a large touristy population swarm in to get their fix of French pastries. While I begrudgingly want to tell most of them that Montréal's food culture is distinct from France/Paris' and that business owners use French food's ""fanciness"" as an excuse to jack up the prices, it's actually not so bad here. Would I say that some of the items are overpriced? Definitely. But there is some sort of quality assurance to be found.The first time I was here, I ordered a club sandwich and a raspberry passion fruit tart. Although it cost $16 and came with a ton of kettle-cooked potato chips (not complaining), it tasted really good, and the chefs did a great job at making normally-dry chicken breast retain some moisture??? The tart was absolutely divine and fruity - although I would have liked a less hard crust for me to cut through in order to avoid potential messes. I got a cappuccino to finish the meal, and it was made with illy coffee and tasted nice and strong, just how I like it.I bought a cake here the second time, and it was a lovingly adorned fruit cake with the toppings arranged pretty meticulously. The ladyfingers surrounding the base was probably one of my favorite parts, and overall it tasted moist and fresh, despite me thinking that $36 for a six-serving cake is quite expensive.My French friends have mentioned that you can get better-quality pastries for half the price back in their home country, which I do believe based off of my own excursions there. This will have to do as a substitute in the meantime until I can find a more authentic alternative, I guess."

I need to update my review as I went here recently with friends and my 1 year-old who was undoubtedly over-tired started crying incessantly just as we were seated to eat in the crowded lunch room. After I was unsuccessful in trying to pacify her, the owner of the bakery came over. I tensed up thinking that he was coming over to unceremoniously shoo me out of his posh restaurant or worse yet to ask me to make my child stop screaming (for everyone out there who believes that parents enjoy hearing our children screaming, please know that while it is annoying to you, it is 100% worse for us to hear our children cry. But I digress!). Much to my surprise, instead of admonishing me for bringing a crying baby into his restaurant, he greeted me with a huge and understanding smile and invited us up the 2nd floor where Maison Christian Faure has a cooking school (which was not in session at that moment) where there was a large, quiet and warm space where my daughter could nap or run around until she was ready to come back to the table. It turned out to be the perfect solution. It was really such a nice touch! When I apologized for my baby's crying and for disturbing everyone trying to enjoy their lunches, he said, ''don't be silly, we parents need to stick together; kids are so challenging!"" He was really so very sweet! Just when I thought I could not love this bakery anymore, I fell deeper in love with it.N.B. - It is worth coming here during the winter months as I did not realize until recently that they do not make their fabulous ""Mont Blanc"" during the summer and fall months.

As I was eating I noticed all customers around me were enjoying their pastries with jam but my wife and I didn't get jam. I requested from the waitress to see the menu, and it in fact it stated that jam comes with breakfast. At this point it was too late, we were nearly finished. I mentioned to the cashier that no jam came with our meal, the gentleman informed me that regardless of what the menu said, no jam is offered because viennoise and Madeleine patries are traditionally not eaten with jam. After a short exchange of words, I could not convince him of the need to deliver what the menu states, he refused to agree and kept on telling me that no jam is eaten with viennoise and Madeleine patries.As the one consuming food in a restaurant, I expect to receive what the menu states, regardless of custom or tradition.

MCF completely meet my expectation of French food/patisserie at Montreal, everything looked and tasted great! I remembered getting seated at the cafe (it wasn't very crowded somehow on that weekend and got seated right away) and my eyes completely drawn over to the wide array of dessert on display and completely mesmerized by them. And to top it off, when the waitress came by to present some of the pastries, I wanted to try all of them! Anyhow, after mulling and being indecisive for several minutes - and making heart cringing decisions - feels comparable like you are you are a manager of job about to forcibly laying off some of your awesone direct reports due to company's financial reason (in this case - due to my budgetary limitation) --- I managed to decide over what I ordered for the table. We stuck with chicken pot pie, Almost croissant, Canelle, and  bunch of cute mini deserts (see pics). I recalled the dessert being way too pretty to eat - everything details of appearance seemed to be thought out and felt like slicing something open by knife felt like a violation, and it tasted even better. The croissant and canelle was crispy and sweet but not overpowering. The chicken pot pies was comforting, and had a flaky texture, perfectly buttery taste - and did not taste cheap at all.

Its the cutest little cafe tucked on a side street between Old Montreal and Old Port. We walked in around 11 am and were seated by the window. We ordered:1. brunch special = smoked salmon puff pastry (choux) which came with the BEST french toast I've ever had, plus a fruit salad, pastry of your choice, and coffee/juice (we went with the chocolate croissant: THIS IS THE BEST CHOCOLATE CROISSANT EVER. This is really how it should be. Going back to a normal chocolate croissant would now be a crime.) 2. lobster puff pastry = heaven. Quite frankly, I now believe that everything should be on a puff pastry and we should do away with bread. Everything is beautifully presented and completely melts in your mouth like butter.

I had wanted to try their creations for a long time, yet never made it to that corner of Old Montreal. We took the opportunity to do so after visiting La Grande Braderie at Marché Bonsecours in October.It was around lunchtime, and the shop was packed. The decor was modern and the smell of warm pastries was amazing. No tables were available for lunch, so we bought a few items to go. It was a difficult choice: every single item looked beautiful and delicious (I would have gladly tried all of them, to be honest). We settled for a I-forgot-the-name tart, a piece of flan, a croissant and a cannelé. It was pricey, but not surprisingly so. We sat outside to try the pastries. Everything was very refined and well crafted, yet somehow the resulting experience was not as exciting and new as expected. Chef Christian Fauré had promised to revitalize the Montreal pastry scene, but he probably meant the ""haute-couture"" scene, specifically. Outside of that highly technical and select circle are actually many younger, adventurous businesses that are pushing boundaries, albeit in other directions. The pastries at Maison Christian Fauré are certainly world-class, but mostly French in spirit. Great shop, great location - overall pleasant despite a rushed service."

Tables are a bit too close together, can get uncomfortable. *Don't come here and expect excellent service. -Lobster and Royal Crab served in a choux pastry - $18The choux pastry was so dry and chewy that I didn't finish it, thus I was quite disappointed to see that a French bakery would fail to make a choux pastry.. With that said, there were good chunks of lobster and crab meat, and the light mayonnaise didn't overpower the delicate seafood and still let their natural sweetness come through.-Brunch on the plank  - $20 it was such a small portion for $20. I didn't try the egg benedict since it was tiny - but friend said it was good, and the brioche was delicious and decadent. However I thought I could have gotten something more substantial with that price point.-Traditional mille-feuille - $6The name of mille-feuille translates into a ""thousand sheets"" - which refer to the layers of the puff pastry. All I have to say is that this mille-feuille was heavenly! Crisp, crunchy buttery layers of puff pastry that crackle when you bite into them. The slight glaze on the first layer of the pastry gave that hint of sweetness. Alternated with a velvety smooth pastry cream. The perfect combination and contrast between crunch and silky smooth. Buttery and sweet.-Chocolate eclair - $6The pastry was light and airy, filled with a rich and luscious chocolate cream. Seriously, is there anything better than the mildly sweet, rich, and chocolaty goodness of an eclair? If you are a dark chocolate lover, you will definitely enjoy this pastry. However for myself, I wished there was another flavor in the pastry cream to complement the rich chocolate."

We arrived a little after 12 and were lucky enough to snag a table for two by the window. Our server was a young man who thankfully was bilingual so we didn't have to use much French. Our waiter served us water right away which I was very thankful for because I was parched from the Montreal heat and humidity. However the water or glass had an strange smell to it which was a bit off-putting but I was so thirsty that I drank my entire glass anyway. I ordered the beef sandwich and a glass of the passion fruit tea while my mom went with the lobster and crab on choux pastry with a glass of rose lemonade. I enjoyed the sandwich as a whole, especially with the addition of onions, grainy mustard, and cornichons. However there were a few tendons in the most that made biting into the sandwich difficult, and the meat seemed to lack enough seasoning. The side salad was super good though; I really liked the vinaigrette. I also had a taste of the lobster and crab which was light and tasty. My mom said the raspberry sauce on the plate really elevated the seafood flavor which was definitely unexpected! Passionfruit tea was excellent but it's definitely sweet so be aware. My mom LOVED the rose lemonade; you can really taste the rose water, but for me it was too tart. As for the pastries, we tried the rose cream on pistachio with raspberries, and the chocolate one with raspberry jam. The chocolate one was extremely rich but definitely tasty. It would be difficult to eat alone though because it's super dense and rich. The rose cream one was much lighter and tasted so perfect with the pistachio tart and raspberries. I wasn't a fan of the white chocolate discs but everything else worked together perfectly. Just a heads up, the pace here is pretty slow so you have to be assertive if you want the check or need to get your waiter's attention. I asked our server for the check and at least 5 minutes passed with no action on his part. I understood that he had other tables but we ended up having to go to the register in order to close our tab. The lady at the register was super cranky with us that we were trying to pay there, but we would have sat at our table waiting for another 15 minutes if we hadn't gone up there. In the end just be aware of this; and they don't take American Express."

Seems as though from the other reviews that they come to your table w/ a tray to explain them to you? Food: Best almond croissant ever. Ever. Also solid butter croissant. Tried 2 of their pastries and thought they were pretty good. There was one that was rectangular in shape and strawberry flavored and the topping tasted like Marshmallow fluff (bleh). I had a pastry that had the word ""soliel"" in it which had vanilla creme on top and pears as the filling. Awesome shortbread crust. The mochaccino and latte were also ok. Macarons were also some of the best I've ever had. Fillings were super strong except the pistachio. Overall the pastries were good but next time I'd probably take it to go and sit outside in the nearby park by the water. I have no idea how to rate this overall. 3.5 but bumped to a 4 for the food."

He holds the title Meilleur Ouvrier de France Glacier (M.O.F.), the highest title a pastry chef can hold, and is the President of the M.O.F. Society of North America.Montreal has very few places to enjoy authentic French desserts, and I'm glad I tried Maison Christian Faure before I left. The pastry shop also has savoury options, including a small weekend brunch menu for those that love sweet desserts like me.Because Maison Christian Faure was known for their sweet pastries, we decided to skip their savoury selection and enjoy the sugary things. The waiter brought over a huge tray of all of their desserts for us to choose from, and patiently waited for me to take a picture :D. He said everyone asks for a picture anyway, so now he just waits even before people ask. Anyway, hubby and I both had a difficult time trying to pick out one...actually no, my husband knew what he wanted - the flan cake. I on the other hand, really took a long time choosing because I'm horrible at making decisions in front of dessert like that.Nevertheless, I ordered the lemon meringue tart and peppermint tea while my husband also ordered an Americano.I didn't get my own teapot, which was a little disappointing, however the waiter did come over and prepare my tea (teabag, pouring the hot water, etc). Little things like this made me very happy, because I felt like I was getting good service.Our desserts came out pretty quickly, and my lemon meringue tart was too pretty to eat. It had just the right amount of sweetness and overall it was kept very light because of the fresh lemons. The tart shell was a tad bit too hard for my taste, as it was quite difficult to break into pieces, but it was still well done. Halfway through my tart, my husband and I realized that the meringue was probably made from uncooked egg whites so we didn't finish the tart. I was really sad at this point, but hubby cheered me up by letting me order another dessert.Hubby's flan cake was very delicious as well, and it was one of the least sweet options they had. It was quite moist and both of us really enjoyed it as it wasn't as sweet as the other desserts we had ordered. We would recommend this to you if you don't have as big of a sweet tooth like I do.My second choice of dessert was their hazelnut eclair, which was one of the best hubby and I had ever tasted! I was so glad I made this choice because this ended up being better than the lemon meringue tart even though I enjoyed that very much. As you can see from the picture above, the eclair had whole hazelnuts in it within the filling, and it really made a huge difference in terms of the dessert's texture and flavour. The cream filling was also really delicious... it was very much like having a real ferrero rocher in your mouth! Hubby enjoyed this eclair very much as well - and I think we'd both agree that this was our top dessert of the three we had ordered. Very much recommended!Aside from all the pretty pastries, Maison Christian Faure also had an assortment of cakes and macarons to enjoy. We didn't get a chance to try them (#sugaroverdose) but I would imagine they be high quality and delicious.I wish I had taken a picture of their brunch menu :(, because it is not available online. Overall, though our dessert date was a tad expensive, we thoroughly enjoyed it very much! The service we received was great - our server was very attentive, and it felt like I was in a much luxurious dessert cafe in France. As its location is in Old Montreal, it's perfect to drop by for some sugar while enjoying your day out in the sun now that the weather is nice!

/user_details?userid=Kj9cFO70zZOQorN0mgeLWA,Faiza K.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This place was recommended to me by several Yelpers and I'm glad I had the chance to go.  Located in Old Montreal it is a pastry shop plus it has a small section for brunch/lunch.  Unfortunately as I took a tad too long at the spa in the morning I missed the cutoff for lunch (3pm on weekdays - not sure about the weekends).  So I settled for drooling over the beautiful cakes, pastries and of course the macarons.  Oh those macarons!   You can get 6 or 12 boxed set (your choice of which macarons) or just buy single ones.  I chose the 6 pack plus a passion fruit and raspberry tarte and the total came up to $22 with tax (I can't remember how much each pastry item cost).  There is also a small fridge that houses larger cakes and some deliciously looking sorbets.  I really wanted to try the sorbets but I remember looking at the price and the small amount of sorbet and just couldn't justify it.  Maybe next time.The shop itself is pretty tiny so I can only imagine how crowded it must get during the weekends.  I did peek around to see the sitting area and it did also look a little crammed together with the tables so maybe try a weekday if you really want to try brunch here. Now I'm going to be honest - I've had the macarons in Paris (Laduree) and those are the absolute best - sorry but nothing can compare to those for me.  But these are a good option if you don't want to fly to Paris!The tarte was just so beautiful I almost didn't want to eat it...but I did!  Such an explosion of flavours - the passion fruit mixed with the tartness of the raspberry was just heaven.  I prefer desserts with a more bite tarte, sour) than super sweet so this was perfect for me."

The cannelés don't feature visible pricing. The main manager eavesdrops on your conversation with the waitress.

While we were sitting, saw the same thing happen to multiple other parties- they either need sign or more attentive staff. The coffee was good and rich, though no one offered milk and we didn't see our server again for a long while after it was delivered. Pastries were phenomenal- they actually bring you a tray of everything they have available to your table, so you can pick from there, which is great.

If take out, you stay in line. If eating in, the server will clear a table for you and bring you menus with the sandwich/salad options (not sure if you can order those items for take out, or only the pastries/bakery items). Our food:Brunch on the Plank: orange juice, croissant, eggs benedict on a choux pastry with smoked salmon, brioche ""nanterre"" with caramel sauce, mini fruit cup. The OJ was wonderful, definitely freshly squeezed. I didn't try the eggs benedict since the portion was so small - he said it was good, though the hollandaise sauce was different than the norm. The caramel sauce for the brioche was delicious and decadent. Fruit cup was mostly pineapple and melon.Crab/lobster salad on a choux pastry: amazing presentation and decent chunks of lobster meat evident, but the choux pastry itself didn't taste fresh. The croissant from the brunch on the plank was delicious enough that we ordered another - note that they are more soft/flaky than crispy.Lemonade: too tart for meTotal was $42 with taxes, before tip."

Very nice shop that gives you that clean&fresh feeling; the decor and the pastries together sets you up for a pleasant visit. Everything behind glass is usually good and this was no exception. The service is kind and attentive but also relax in a sense where they don't annoy you constantly while you're stuffing your face. For pastries and drinks prices range from 3-13$. For real food it would be more (but why would you even?). -Food- Pot de Fleur de Sel Caramel : Salted caramel mousse on top of a chocolate brownie/cake? inside a cute glass pot. For me it was a different taste than what I was used to: more authentic than previous salted caramel treats that I've tried. It was not very sweet and the brownie added texture and more flavours to the whole dessert.  It ended up being one of my favourites. Strawberry Cake: The tartness of the strawberry balanced out the sweetness of the other components creating a solid, delicious piece of cake. Pistachio cake with fruits: For me it was like a pistachio cake with fruit cake on top that worked WELL together. It was light and pleasant. Lemon Meringue : It was  too sweet for my tastes as there was a layer of white chocolate under the filling. Good surprise for some but not for me, as I am adamant about my dislike for white chocolate. In this case, I dealt with it because I had tea and it did cut the acidity of the lemon filing.  The pastry was a bit hard for spoon handling, but we all have fingers- suck it up. -Overall- A nice place to stop and relax in the Old Port to enjoy a coffee or tea accompanied by pretty&tasty desserts. Not mind-blowing but a must go!"

The salmon and beef baked in puff pastry were both divine, so was the potato gratin on the side and the green beans. The normal lunch menu... the lobster and crab puff pastry thing was beautiful, although I am not a big fan of their puff pastry itself, it seems dried and hard to eat, but the dish was pretty and still would order it just so I can take another picture :)  The club sandwich was the best I've ever had.  The execution from the perfectly toasted bread to everything inside was amazing.  They ran out of turkey that day, so I was lucky enough to substitute to the roast beef. It's not your regular deli roast beef thin slices...it's like prime rib slices and to die for.  Best sandwich I've ever had, even the potato chips on the side.  The execution of all the dishes were carefully thought of and they've done it beautifully.  The place is small, can be overwhelming at times if you're waiting for a table, not a lot of space to stand around while you have a bunch of people coming in to buy pastries/desserts to go.  But all the staff are friendly and even though it's a big tourist trap...

/user_details?userid=WEAKuClK0BjhjHWGunMXQA,Ann W.,"Northville, MI",4 star rating,"If you are ever lost, make sure it is in Old Montreal, on a warm winter's day on the way to this pastry shop. As we walked past beautiful shops and unique restaurants, we definitely built up an appetite for the tasty, well-baked offerings at this wonderful shop. Mid-afternoon, the elegant shop was full of friends catching up with each other, couples having a leisurely lunch, and tourists taking a well-deserved pause in their wanderings. I loved the large window overlooking the area, the fairly large tables, and transparent acrylic chairs. On each table, a colorful bird perched on a small silver tree - cute! While we waited for the pastry tray, I scoped out a beautiful smoked salmon salad and a delicious-looking lobster salad sandwich (on a brioche bun). We will need to better plan our meals next time around - both of us were just in the mood for dessert today. Given that we burned off a ton of calories while we were lost, we both got two desserts! At least that's the story that we're sticking to.There were several interesting offerings: a Paris-Brest éclair with hazelnut cream; a wedge of flan, and a passion fruit/raspberry tarte. I went with both the mille-feuille and the canelé. The latter was okay: the crust was leathery as opposed to crusty while the interior was much better - a cross between custard and cake with a holely crumb. There was also definitely the heavenly fragrance of vanilla and rum.The mille-feuille was outstanding. The pastry was buttery and flaky, as it should be but rarely is, almost as if the pastry chef piped the pastry cream just upon ordering. I enjoyed every forkful of this wonderful dessert. I also got to sample the caramel fleur de sel pudding. It was subtly sweet and flavorful.The shop also sells quiches from their refrigerated case, as well as terrines and glacés. Shoppers can also find a selection of French macarons, jams, biscuits, marshmallows, and organic teas available for sale."

I went to Tommy St-Paul and spotted Maison Christian Faure just around the corner, so I thought that fate brought me here and I really need to try. The pastry chef Christian Faure is very well known for his delicate desserts that look as good as they taste, that's why people simply love this place. Since it was 26 degrees outside yesterday, me and my friend decided to take two pieces of cake to go so that we can picnic on the lawn of old port. We both chose fruity flavours: my friend took passion fruit tart while I took the mango crème brûlée, they were soooo pretty! We couldn't take our eyes off them. If you want to enjoy the pastry indoor, the dining space inside the shop is nice and chic, a bit too simplistic compared to some elaborate restaurants around the area but good enough. When we left the shop and went next to the fountain of old port, we opened the box and took a bite: and it was heaven! The ingredients were fresh and the taste so well-balanced! The freshness of tropical fruit took away partially our heat and made our hearts flourish. I really liked it but found it a bit overpriced and the service was a bit slow, but I would definitely recommend this place!"

Usually, in restaurants, they bring the check to you but here, we had to get up to pay. We waited maybe 20 minutes for the check only to find out we had to go to the counter.

So I like to say I have some experience when knowing which macaron place has the best. So far, Toute de Sweet near me in Bethesda and Laduree have been on the top for me. I like to compare this place a bit like Laduree but on a smaller scale. When walking in, it definitely had that Parisian cutesy decor and all the patisseries were too cute. However, the macaron selections did look a bit lacking and we only had a few to choose from. I grabbed a box of 15 and hit the road for our long drive back to MD. I didn't try these until later that night and although they were good, it lacked that chewy factor.  But, the next day, I tried them again and the chewy factor came into play, which reminded me of Laduree a bit. Macarons done right should be eaten within few days in the fridge because the shell will crack when bitten into. You can also let it thaw a bit from the cold before eating, but really, who has time for that. This place was pretty pricey considering the lack of selections so I definitely would prefer Laduree over this place. But hey, if you're in old Montreal, feel free to stop by and give it a try. Had we known that this place served food as well, we would've loved to try it for brunch."

Which is sad, since this place is a beautiful spot in Old Montreal where you can sit back and enjoy the neighbourhood with a nice cup of tea and a pastry. Unfortunately, service (or lack of it) was terrible for us.We walked in and marvelled at how chic and pretty the space was - it's a beautiful cafe. We informed the server at the front that we wanted to sit in, and we were told to seat ourselves, so we did... and so began the most awkward table service experience ever! Is it because we look young? We were wearing jeans? Hair out of place? Who knows. But for our ENTIRE meal, every guest around us was approached by a server, served with water, offered a variety of pastries to order from a tray... except us. Imagine being in a restaurant and not being acknowledged throughout your entire time there - this was it. NOT ONCE were we ever approached by a server, offered water, offered pastries to order (they bring them around in a tray), etc. We ended up going to the takeout display to find pastries, carry the pastries to our table using the server's own trays (like peasants), walk around trying to find water... let me tell you, being a pseudo-server for your own table is super awkward. No eye contact, no one even came to clean up our table, even when we tried to wave them down (multiple times). Did we swallow an invisible pill, or what?When it came time to pay, we went up to the takeout counter since no one brought us a bill, and the same servers who ignored us questioned, ""Did you want to pay? What exactly did you order?"" They had no idea what we ordered at all - we could have lied (we didn't) and they wouldn't have known the difference. And then proceeded to indicate the tip option on the credit machine. For what service? What a terrible experience, in such a beautiful cafe. The pastries themselves were fine, but were totally tainted by the experience. Probably won't be back - in a city like Montreal, there are many other places for pastries with probably infinitely better service."

No excuse for this. The croissants were also not as good as I remembered. Not worth it. I recommended this place to everyone who said they were visiting Montreal but I'll now be doing the opposite.

Wait stuff needs to improve in efficiency, attention to detail, and sense of responsibility. Weekly customer at this place. Last time I ordered a birthday cake 1 week before the pick up date. Everything was written on their note. And the waiter somehow was confused about the date. He called me and I said 3 times the exact same date,loud and clear. He seems skeptical for some unknown reason and finally said ok. On my delivery date, I picked it up and went home without checking the cake. BIg mistake. For the first time in my life I witnessed a cake melted into saggy,runny water, on my leather roadster's seat. Why would I put a cake on my car seat? Because they always stays firm and never was any water coming out of the box. This means the cake is not made fresh. It was either mistakenly put in room temperature for too long, or they made it days in advance it collapsed. After I arrived home, cleaned up the mess, then opened the box. The ""happy b day""card was nowhere to be found, which I specified during ordering. Great. So I called, and the guy said he forgot. Just like that. Forgot. And he asked me to go to the boutique myself to pick it up. I live in south shore and they are downtown. I said I can't it's far. and he said ""that's too bad. Nothing else I can do."" Really?! Nothing else you can do huh..Why am I the one that needs to go there when it's his mistake? People only has one birthday per year. The card was meant to be special and personal, now it's just a saggy cake. The cake turned out only lasted a day. The 2nd day it was sour. (I did put it in the fridge when not consuming) Another proof it's not fresh. What I can say. Next time I'd open the box and check everything there. Can't be trusted."

/user_details?userid=hEgP-NdQWc-wD9xEbDtWhQ,Kyra M.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"We were told if you do anything in Montreal, you have to have French pastries. After some careful research, we ended up at Maison Christian Faure. We were staying at the Governour's Hotel in Quartier Latin, and despite frigid temperatures, we decided to walk over to Old Port (about fifteen minutes or so). As noted by other reviews, MCF is tucked away on a side street and could be easily missed if you're not looking out for it.  When you enter, there are stairs leading up, and down. Down, I'm assuming, is the pastry school, whereas the dining area and pastry shop is upstairs. The pastry counter is the first thing you see when you walk up the stairs (macarons to be exact), and I'm pretty sure I began salivating right away, while planning my to-go pastry strategy.The space is very sleek with a bit of rustic charm, and bright and airy. We were seated by the window, and the angle of the sunlight made it hard for me to take pictures of my food. C'est la vie. We both got the brunch plank, which was the perfect amount of food. It started with a chocolate croissant each, layers of flakiness and bits of chocolate galore. Sadly, the croissants arrived before our espresso, and I could barely wait. Then, the plank came, with a cup of fresh fruit, a slice of brioche, a side of caramel sauce, and a delightful spin on eggs benedict (I got the salmon, my partner the ham). It was just enough to leave room for dessert. I got macarons to try later, and found them less than stellar but not detracting from my overall impression of MCF. I'll make this place a must-stop on subsequent trips to Montreal!"

When you walk in, you'll notice a beautiful mural depicting the days of Montreal past. Similarly, there is another mural located inside the shop. Yes, the place is mostly white and may come across as sterile to some, however, all that white is contrasted with beautiful pops of color that peek out from behind the displays... Displays that are filled with lovely, perfectly crafted pastries and sweets that you would be a fool not to try. Not to mention the awesome stone wall (that may or may not be original) and hardwood floors. The space is incredible - I'm thinking they should let me live there. In terms of seating, there are only a handful of tables, but these are well spaced out so you don't need to share your dessert with your neighbors. You all know how I feel about personal space! Stuff: You saw my pictures. If you didn't, then go look at them and you'll immediately understand why I fell in love with this place. The Maison C-F offers fresh pastries that are so pretty, you'll feel bad cutting into them with that fancy spork they give you. They also make macarons, cakes, baked goods, and they have a refrigerated section where you can purchase pre-made cakes. I'm not sure if they're ice cream cakes so you can go check that out for yourself.  I ordered an Americano and it was served just the way I like it, using Illy coffee. My dessert of choice was the chocolate eclair. It was positively divine - delectable - deliriously delicious. I have never been served an eclair that was so.... stuffed - and the filling was chocolate! YUM! They're not cheap, that's for sure. The eclair was amazing and I could tell the patissier uses quality ingredients simply by its taste and texture. That said, it WAS a bit rich, which is why I begrudgingly left a little piece behind. I just couldn't eat anymore despite my best efforts. My date had the pot au caramel and loved it. Service: This is why I rated this 4 stars instead of 5. No one greeted us when we walked in. We stood at the counter for a minute because we weren't sure if we should be waiting for someone to seat us or if it was OK to pick our own table. Even then, no one greeted us. We then sat at our table for a few minutes while boy-waiters walked by and looked at us, but still offered no greeting. HELLO are you BLIND? For a minute, I thought we'd entered into a new restaurant trend - where the wait staff is both blind mute. When we finally did get service, our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable, so that made up for the initial failure to launch.  BUT you should still greet your clients when they walk through the door.  On a related note, M. Faure was out and about on the floor chitchatting with clients as well as greeting those that walked through the door. We ran into him in the elevator and he was very friendly. It's great to see a business owner taking the time to interact with their clientele - it definitely encourages repeat visits!So.... you have to go. Get off your couch, brave this crazy-ass Montreal polar vortex and go feast on Christian Faure's pastries. Don't worry - you'll leave there a little plumper so you won't feel the cold as much =-D"

There was a long wait because it was late on a Sunday morning and it was obviously prime brunch time, but I'm so glad that we waited. The wait gave us an opportunity to view the incredible selection of pastries and beautiful desserts and made us all that much more, when we sat down, that we wanted to order the brunch sur la planche, which may just be the greatest deal ever. $20 includes a fancy drink (think iced cappuccino, house-made lemonade, or the richest hot chocolate), a croissant/brioche/other danish of your choice, a completely phenomenal egg benedict on choux pastry with salmon or ham (get the salmon - it's better!), a fresh fruit salad, and a piece of brioche bread (think French toast) with caramel sauce.

The following week, he introduced me to Maison Christian Faure.Good : The place bright, clean and you can tell that it has quality pastries. They had a variety of macaroon flavors, and lots of delicious viennoiseries and confiseries ! It is a great place to stop for desserts and tea or to catch up with friends or even on a date since it's not to loud inside. And best believe it, the macaroons are amazing and has since raised the bar. It's a interesting mix of cafe and pastry school and shop all in oneBad : The prices are a bit steep, but what can you expect from a renown pastry chef? Bottom Line: I will definitely be returning to this lovely spot if I am in the mood to spoil myself."

Every time I'm in the area I have to make a pit stop here! In the mornings, they carry a brunch menu which consists of eggs, a danish, cake and a drink (if I remember correctly?) This time we decided to opt in for their cakes. I tried their strawberry shortcake and it was delish!!! Each layer was filled with their strawberry creme and mounted with full strawberries. The bottom layer of the cake was also a thin crisp of white chocolate. One of my friends ordered their butter crossiant and I have to say.. all the calories in that crossiant is so worth it! Flaky and crispy and buttery... everything you need in an amazing crossiant! They also have a good selection of buttery pastries from butter crossiant to almont crossiant to chocolate crossiant to apple turnover and butterfly cookies. They also carry a wide range of macarons as well but I never had the opportunity to try.The cool thing about this shop is that they also have a pastry school on the 3rd floor of this unit! If you wanted to host a pastry shop or learn from their executive chef, you can have the opportunity to do so. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the old montreal area!"

The guy did not bother explaining any of their desserts (even after I asked what each one was), as they seem to be more concerned with closing the place on time than selling the rest of their desserts. We chose one of the pistachio cakes and a mango gelato from the fridge. I have no idea what was in the pistachio cake since the guy didn't bother to tell me at all... if that wasn't bad enough, they didn't have any plastic knifes or folks. It took asking 3 different staff members and 5 good minutes of waiting around for them to get a couple of folks. ** oh and there are seating areas but apparently they won't let you sit there an hour before they close since they close that area first. As for the actual desserts, they were alright. The cake was mediocre at best and the gelato was way too sweet. Maybe I didn't try the right desserts, but will not be returning."

This place was highly rated on Yelp and TripAdvisor, so had to give it try. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated which is average for a brunch place in Old Montreal. We ordered the brunch special which came with a beverage (tea or espresso-based). The meals were to die for. The brioche and the caramel sauce were the best part of the meal. The pineapple with mint and the ham on the puffed pastry with the cream sauce were both a close second. I have no doubt that Christian and his apprentices can bake delectable pastries, however one suggestion is to improve the service. The servers were very professional, however due to a lack of staff, we waited awhile to get our coffees and water refilled. All in all, a very good experience and would visit again when I am in old Montreal."

As for the other items we tried such as the macaroons, lemon meringue tart and the passion fruit tart they were all great! Definitely will go back because with the vast choice of pastries it will take a few visits to try all of them.

I got the brunch ""plank,"" which came with a drink, plain or chocolate croissant, ham or salmon benedict, french toast with caramel sauce, and fruit salad. The croissant was a bit overlooked, with a dry, firm texture. The toast was decent, but the caramel sauce was excellent. The benedict had a foam sauce that was on the bland side, the egg was nicely done with a gooey yolk, but the bread part was stale. The fruit salad was notably fresh, dressed with fruit juice. We also opted for an additional dessert from the display tray the waiter brought to the table, which was elaborately presented but seemed to suffer from refrigeration staleness- others at the table had a similar experience.It's unfortunate that this ideally located place with wonderful staff serves such beautiful but mediocre food. It would earn my recommendation if the food tasted as good as it looked."

All we wanted was for someone to bring the pastry tray to us and they never passed that on - gave us our bill even though we didn't ask for it then when we asked to see the tray they decided to play telephone tag across the 6 servers asking each other to bring it to our table so 10 min later still no tray and the answer oh I told him to do it and she told her to do it.  (are we in elementary school)Just take out and save yourself the headache of dealing with the untrained staff who can't coordinate taking a pastry out of the glass and a tray to the table...

As a huge fan of French pastries, I guess you could say I was more than thrilled to rest my weary feet and enjoy a nice cafe au lait.The atmosphere of the cafe is modern-day yet traditional: the entrance features a colorful mural and the interior with its exposed brick wall, was accented with white decor and metal tables. Our server brought us that afternoon's available treats on a large silver platter, of which we chose to sample the eclairs, a chocolate mousse cake, and a white chocolate and pistachio cake. I also decided to sample a cappuccino (though to be fair, I really just wanted to see what art they'd put on top, which ended up actually being a little disappointing).The cappuccino was the perfect balance of bitter and sweet; overall, it was a good balance of the robust coffee flavor and wasn't too cloying. All of our sweets, were, however, a bit sweeter than I traditionally prefer. However, they were all executed incredibly well and had great textures and flavors, nothing short of what I expected from a restaurant owned by the best pastry chef in the world.We picked up a number of croissants for road, which turned out to be incredibly flaky, buttery, and still were fantastic (not even soggy, yes!) a few days later. It was certainly one of this pastry shop's most redeeming treats.Overall, Maison Christian Faure certainly met my expectations. While I may not have the biggest sweet tooth, I hope to return someday to take one of its many cooking and baking classes to make my own renditions of their famous treats."

It came with french toast that was not even warm and the eggs benedict came on a dry flavourless puff pastry instead of the standard english muffin. The eggs were also served with some sort of bechemel foam - moving away from the traditional creamy sauce but probably not with good reason. The saving grace of the dish was the fresh fruit and caramel sauce that came with it. I had been here before and was quite happy with what I had ordered by the brunch the second time was really average. Maybe it was an off day with the kitchen the second time I went in. Maybe I'll give them a 3rd shot - the seating in charming and it's in a lovely part of the city. Not sure yet though!"

I did the plain croissant twice because it may be the best that I have ever had, anywhere!  The first lunch I had here I enjoyed a lobster and crab salad in choux pastry...delicious! We did brunch here on our last day in Montreal (Saturday) and had the ""benedict"" - they offered either ham or smoked salmon.  Both were in choux pastry with a light foam on top in lieu of the normal hollandaise sauce (I had the ham and my wife had the salmon).  They were both a wonderful, light riff on the traditional beloved benedict!The joint also serves Illy coffee, which is generally a plus...they did great with cappucinos and with longhe espressos.The only gripe I have with the place was the service was a bit haphazard.  They would be very attentive, but then would just forget about you once the food was brought out...no more water refills, no checking to see if you wanted anything else, etc.  So, go for the food and live with the service...it isn't bad service, just less attentive than I would really like.On the whole though, I whole-heartedly recommend Maison Christian Faure to anyone looking for a good breakfast / lunch place in Montreal...we spent two meals on our foodie honeymoon in Quebec there, so I promise you that it is legit!"

/user_details?userid=j0IAuc2qpvKws2T1xOuZcA,M J.,"Paramus, NJ",1 star rating,"Terrible experience, worst service in all of Montreal. Stopped at the bakery yesterday half hour before they close and we're told by the woman at the counter that they're closed. Today, stood in line for 20 minutes waiting for a table, even though there were plenty of empty tables and at least 4 waitresses servicing the tables. Finally got a table and ordered some tarts and croissants and 2 ICED lattes, and told the waitress we would look at the pastries and order them in a couple minutes. Waitress comes back with 2 hot lattes, and at first I was shy to say she brought the wrong lattes, but my husband said we should get what we ordered, especially since it was so hot outside and we had wanted iced lattes. When we said this to the waitress, her mood completely changed. Brought the iced lattes and bangs the glasses on the table and walks away without a word. No straws like all other customers have. Lattes were clearly just the hot lattes poured into another glass and tons of ice added to make them cold, causing them to be super diluted and tasting like water. Waitress never comes back to our table or even look at us as she services other tables quite politely. Have to look at her for 30 minutes to get her attention to get our check, which she puts on the table with a credit card machine and without a word, again walks away. Unbelievable that just because of asking for the correct drink she turns so rude. maybe you should listen to what the customer orders and understand that YOU are the one that made the mistake. Pastries are decent here, but because of service, I would say that if you want a pleasant experience, try out one of the many other classy patisseries in the area."

This is a small spot, but it's easy to find and there are a lot of options. I popped in there 30 minutes before it closed and it was pretty much empty. The young woman working there was very helpful whenever I asked her what some of the desserts were. I ended up choosing 3 different desserts and a couple of macarons, I paid around $25 for that. I got all of those to go, and they provided a nice to go box for me to carry my goods. Every single thing that I got was delicious! The macarons were heavenly, I regretted not getting more of them.

The tiramisu and coffee-cinnamon choux were very nice though not the best I ever had, I suppose I was expecting more from a MOF.

I felt like I didnt exist and should have left and trusted my gut feeling.- They served my husband's lunch within two minutes. It was a cold club sandwich from the fridge and dont tell me it is freshly made. Toasted bread is not supposed to be cold. There is no way a club sandwich should be done within 3 minutes. Subway sandwich even took longer. - They didnt even take my pastry order after my husband's sandwich came out. - Took my own tea bag out but not served hot water. - Why would you serve the food first before drinks?- Waiting for 8 minutes already and noone came to us for the machine for the check. We paid by cash at the end and left.I know I don't speak French or even look French, not sure if that is why they treated us this way. Felt quite discriminated in the whole experience.

It was small, there was practically no cream inside, it was dry.. really, seriously a waste of $6.If you want a decent eclair that doesn't look too fancy, go to Complexe Desjardins, find the O Gateries / La Belge Bakery there, and buy those eclairs for $4.05 They're worth it.Only the tarts are decent, but DO NOT take the lemon meringue tart. I paid a lot of money for it and it ended up being totally, utterly, disgusting. I am not a fan of cream to begin with, but then the lemon curd inside was.. just.. effing weird. Like eating dish soap. Sweet dish soap.I tossed it in the garbage. Took a few bites, regretted the money I spent and .. oof, into the garbage.I also tried the strawberry cake (fraisier) and found it OK, but the cream on top ruined it for me.

I was heading out when I decided to go to washroom. So asked the lady behind the counter and although it was their closing time she kindly told me to take the elevator to level 4 and i'll find washrooms on my right. I just figured out that the place is not just a french patisserie but also a pastry school, when I was in the elevator reading floors names. So I decided to grab a bite on my way back to the car and relax in the car as oppose to any place which is open and omg I had the nicest eclair in my life. A hazelnut eclair a taste of the heaven.

The chocolate croissant and almond chocolate croissants were the best we had in the city. The cappuccino was very good also. We went on a Sunday around 11:30 and there was a pretty big line to get a table. It was a little confusing to know whether the line was for a table or take-out. It appeared to be for both, which was odd if you just wanted to get something to go. We wanted to sit, so it didn't impact us, but for people just wanting take-out, it might have been frustrating to have to stand in line so long. The service was friendly, although a bit slow as they only had what appeared to be one waiter for the whole area, with one other helping him out.

We were there for a breakfast snack at around 10 am on a weekday and the case was full so we had the full selection available to choose from. We selected the blueberry tart and an almond croissant. Both were good. My favorite part of breakfast? My terrific cup of very hot, dark, boldly flavored coffee. It was the perfect foil for the richness of the croissant. On the way out, I purchased a few more items to try later including an apple pastry -- that was apparently a shocking $12! My other half ate the whole thing so I'm not sure why it cost 3x as much as my croissant but it was reportedly tasty. There are no prices on the pastries so I suppose you should ask if you don't want any surprises sprung on a stupid non-French speaking tourist like me.  :(One other tip: there's a menu of breakfast options posted English discretely on one of the walls.

Overall, everything was amazing and had just the right amount of sweetness, so it wasn't cloyingly sweet. I REALLY enjoyed the passion fruit....tart? I don't know if I can call it a tart, but it was fruity, had great flavor and had this oozy fruit filling that just covered the plate when you cut into it. There was a dessert with a little custard on top and a rum syrup in it which was a little strong and on the sweet side for me. The canele didn't have the best texture ever, but I didn't exactly have it fresh, so that was bad on my part. The flavor had a hint of orange/citrus, I think, that made it so much better than some other caneles I've had. Since canele is one of my favorite desserts, I really appreciated what they did. My second favorite dessert from there was a coffee crumble with lemon curd and what seemed like meringue sticks on top. Coffee and lemon curd was such an interesting combination. I would say that is a must-try. while I was in the elevator en route to the bathrom, the elevator doors opened on the third floor, and I got a small peek into what I was told was the baking school associated with the bakery.

When you enter they seat you down and asks if you've been there before and they take out a tray of their deserts and you get to choose at your seat. There's not too many seats also so plan ahead when you want to go. All in all a place to visit if you're in Montreal.

The apple tart and croissant was absolutely amazing. At one point, the server asked us if we could move our table slightly to make room for others, and then five min later...he came back with a whole dish of colorful beautiful macarons to make up for the ""inconvenience."" My family and I were floored...like this is amazing. I don't even usually like macarons, but they managed to change my mind about them here. Cutest tea bins ever.

If they lacked in any category at all, I'd say we didn't feel exceptionally welcome. Maybe that was because we came after the morning rush, and were sort of asking to be an afterthought.The royal breakfast was very tasty, though I think we'd been hoping for them to have something a bit more fortifying. If you're looking for sweet, though, this is it.I have to say, I was a bit rude. Though I'm usually more conscious of such things,  I murmured to my wife on the way out that $7 (USD) for a small bag of marshmallows seemed a bit much. I should have waited 10 more seconds until we were outside. Apparently, one of the staff overheard me, and (probably a bit offended) reminded us that they were homemade. I wasn't talking to you, but, you're right. They are homemade. And they were delicious. They barely made it back to Boston. Touche."

Our hotel concierge suggested we go there as I was interested in coffee and pastry that morning. Since I was searching for a delectable pastry I was full of anticipation as I entered this small restaurant. Our waitress took forever to notice us and our coffee never arrived. There turned out to be several tables waiting patiently for a cup of coffee!!  I asked for a pastry and received a glippy-gloppy tort of some kind. Still waiting for a cup of java I asked for a pastry typically served with coffee. I received something obnoxious vaguely called a bike ride (??). It was terrible and much too rich to accompany a morning coffee. While they apologized for everyone waiting for their coffee that kindness was cancelled out by both the tardy coffee and huge bill. Stay away from this place and have your bear claw elsewhere!

The almond croissant had a similarly alcoholic flavor to it which I did not want in the morning.  The lemon tart was a touch too lemon-y.  I still think this place is 5 stars for the lunch options.Overall:  I wanted to come back to this restaurant every morning but resisted the urge to try other places.  I think I would have enjoyed eating here every day we were in Montreal.  DO NOT pass up this place when in Montreal."

And someone walking out said, ""This is the place.""It was DEFINITELY THE PLACE!Lunch: Quinoa salad and the beef sandwich. The beef sandwich was very good, but there are probably better things. The quinoa was EXCELLENT! Dessert: We had an enclair, which was good, but not the best ever. Then we had some white chocolate, lemon, crunchy thing with two sticks on top -- that was EXCELLENT! We also took home croissants and an elephant ear for breakfast the next morning.Coffee: This was excellent as well, but I didn't realize it was $4 a cup. Over all our bill was $85 (including the tip), which is a little high for lunch, but we did have some take home goodies."

We were seated and were only given a drink menu. We waited for 10 mins with no service. We requested a menu and that was another 10 mins wait. Finally, a waiter approached us with a tray of cakes for us to choose from. We made our selections and it took another 10 mins before we got our food. Since the cakes were already made, I don't understand why it took so long for them to bring them to us. Finally, it was the time to pay and it meant more waiting. I asked for the check and 10 mins later still nothing. To avoid more waiting with no service, I went up to the register and tried to pay, no staff was there. Finally, a waiter showed up and he asked us what we ordered. There were only 3 tables that haven't paid yet and he had to ask us which table it was. I won't go back to this place again. I have tried better French bakeries elsewhere with way better service."

/user_details?userid=JugRgD12Mlc47zHAaqpQCw,Erika N.,"Binghamton, NY",1 star rating,"Very disappointed.  Maybe it's because we're American but we had no friendly greeting. Felt more like a burden.  No breakfast menu.  The waitress had to tell us the types of bread they had and added whatever else was in the glass case we could order and looked at us expecting like we memorized the menu.  The other waitress at least showed other guests a platter of desserts of what they served but ours snubbed at us.  We had to practically beg for our utensils that we're just at arms length from us.  I had a croissant with ham and cheese and the inside was super cold.  The only thing good was the hot chocolate.  All I can say is that breakfast is the worst and this is a tourist trap!! We paid a fancy price for subpar food and the worst service ever.  Our waitlist name according to the receipt says frederic, so advise, don't get stuck with her. Still confused as to why we even tipped her, since she didn't do anything but pass us by as she catered to non-Americans.  My mother inlaw had to drink her coffee black since they refused to give her cream/milk as she asked them twice with no avail.  Don't go here if you're American, they snub at you!!"

We had two pastries plus cappuccino and took two to go for dinner.  Extremely tasty and the staff was friendly.  Place was very clean and had good ambiance.  We HIGHLY recommend for anyone seeking delicious French pastries.   They also served regular food such as salads, soups and sandwiches, but we did not try.GREAT JOB guys, hope to visit next time we are in town."

Service not really -- though the younger servers were very pleasant the manager was apparently working on his PhD in Arrogant French Caricature. I was seriously looking for the camera, so perfect were the stereotypes.But whatever, don't let that dude ruin your day, make multiple elevator trips up to the toilet on the fourth floor and show him whose Maison this really is."

Slow and inefficient staff who take their own sweet (no pun intended) time with everything. It was a rainy day so the place was not busy. Despite this, the staff (yep, all of 'em) seemed to have trouble doing their jobs effectively. Ask for a menu, no menu till 10 minutes later. Ask for the bill, and he says ""Sure"" but never gets around to doing it. What are all of you getting paid to do?"

I explained I would rather try their almond croissant and pay any additional charge. However they were all out. I said I would return the next morning. When I did they were all out of almond croissants even though it was just a few minutes after 10:00. Three times I tried and three times they were sold out before 10:00. Why not make more? They offered to refund the mistaken charge (2.50) but I said I'd take a plain croissant instead. Three trips to the shop and I didn't get to try an almond croissant. I am grateful that they made up for their mistake at the cash register. My rating reflects my experience, not their food, which is better than the rating"
