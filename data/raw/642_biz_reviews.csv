They let us walk in with our little dogs no problem. They have great protections up for the staff and clear marking for guest to stand. Coffee was really good. We got each got a latte and honestly might be some of the better ones we've had in the city. The two girls behind the counter were very friendly and served us super quickly. They also have a nice selection of little breakfast Sandwiches, muffins, muffins and those fancy breakfast bread things.  Will definitely be our new coffee stop on our walks."
