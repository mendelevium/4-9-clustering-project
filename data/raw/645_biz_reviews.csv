Smash, crispy, perfectly saucy, little pickle, soft cosy bun. They've nailed it. The poutine is vegetarian. The shakes are thick and flavourful. The hot dog is all beef. Everything from the hot dogs to the buns is made fresh and homemade. This place is literally perfect and i will return time and time again. If you go with a friend, just get a second one to split. You'll be so sad when the first one is over."
/user_details?userid=7Ach25kvyxGn6G8m-oT5iQ,Matt M.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"One of the best poutine spots in Montreal for certain. Only thing they're missing is a gluten free bun for the burger and we are out here. Overall great experience. Staff was nice and accommodating. Atmosphere is very chill - cool modern day hip diner vibe. Branding is great too - next time I'm for sure copping a T shirt. The burger (double cheeseburger, of course) was very, very good even without a bun. The poutine was AMAZING, especially the beef in it. Probably best poutine I've ever had. My friend got the regular poutine, no ground beef, but in a large. Him and his girlfriend couldn't finish it because they are soft but I was happy to accommodate the leftovers :). Not much more to get into here. Absolutely worth the drop by. One love."

No joke i found the best place for poutine, and I have to say I have never ate such a DELICIOUS poutine, at a point I told my boyfriend i will never go to another place to eat a poutine but here.THE TASTE OF THE GRAVY WAS DECLICIOUS, they also have their own spice that is  crazy good which they sell for 5$ ONLY.I loved the retro vibe as well!"

The burgers were juicy, the hot dog super buttery (it was like eating a hot dog on a grilled cheese sandwich), and the poutine was a great mashup of their signature items. Everything was really flavourful and well made."

That being said, Chez Tousignant was a really great experience and I'm not disappointed I decided to check this place out.The restaurant has a 50's diner kind of feel to it. I don't know culturally what the country was like at that time, but this place made me think of Grease and Elvis Presley- which is awesome of course. The staff was super friendly, helpful, and really nice to us. They were patient with us, answered our questions, and delivered service with a smile.We ordered the Hot Chicken Sandwich, the Tousignant Hamburger, a Tousignant Hot Dog, and the Classic Poutine. Everything is made to order so there was a small wait. Everything was hot and delicious. The burger was huge and delicious, juicy and flavorful. The toasted bun on the sandwich was perfect, but it was kind of challenging to eat considering how thick it was. I've never had poutine before and I'm happy to say that it was well made here - very enjoyable if not kind of really rich.If you're a tourist and want to check out how the French Canadians do a mean hamburger, look no further than Chez Tousignant."

/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The owners of Impasto opened this gourmet fast food diner. They wanted to make a quality hotdog, burger and poutine. The hotdog and burger are made with high quality local meat and the buns are handmade. I love hotdogs so I was really excited to try a ""homemade"" hotdog! We ordered the tousignant hotdog, the double burger and a large poutine. The tousignant hotdog has melted cheese under the dog, a homemade sauce and pickles. It was really really good but too expensive ($7). The burger was great, it tasted like am In-and-out burger in my opinion! The real star was the poutine, which was absolutely delicious!! It was about the same price as a Belle province poutine. I'd definitely order this again.Take home message: delicious but pricey. Get the poutine!"

/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is what I call a dirty burger and a great one at that. Thin flat top caramelized patties (I got the double cheese burger), steamed melted cheese and a slightly sweet bun. Toppings and condiments are there as a supporting act and know not to steal the burger's thunder. It's a beautiful thing when it all comes together. This burger is in the ballpark of a Shake Shack or a Uniburger. I'm not prepared to say it's the best I've ever tasted anywhere (That would be a burger at the Hovey Manor in North Hatley at lunch about 3 years ago. Don't even bother trying, they don't make it anymore, they have since replaced it with a run of the mill burger), but it's beautifully crafted and an honest effort put forth by this establishment.The homemade hotdog and bun were extremely tasty and satisfying. Apparently they are all beef and made of choice cuts in house without any mystery meat. The fries were decidedly average. Next time I would try them in their ultimate form of poutine and maybe even the chicken and peas version. I'm now a fan of this place and wish they would open up a second branch a little more centralized in Montreal. If they opened one in NDG, they could put Notre -Boeuf -de -Overcooked -Gimmick -Burger out of business."

Staff is pretty friendly (guys mostly, girls ignored me completely and were kinda rude) but since I just wanted to try their burgers that's what I went for. This place is not fancy, or full of ****, it's pretty simple, good food, good burgers, well executed. That's what I'm asking for when I'm looking for a burger. It didn't make me feel bad afterwards, which means not too greasy and well-balanced. They make their own soft drinks which makes it fun and their branding is how this dinner is. Just spot on. I will recommend it if you want just a good burger in a dinner that plays random cartoons (which I think is neat). Enjoy people ;)"
/user_details?userid=ahDxPzmaQuSOQtQMvZryZw,Anthony B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great burgers, poutines, and hotdogs. I'm a huge fan of West coast burger joints like In n Out and this place nails that craving.Their burgers are big and meat is done perfectly, crispy edges and all. Their sauce is top notch too. The hot dogs all dressed are great. Top it off with a milkshake too!The place is a bit small and it can get crowded so beware. Don't come in a large group.I one time ordered via Uber Eats during poutine week, they were doing an Italian meat poutine, and I couldn't go in person and it wasn't listed in Uber Eats. I special requested it and they actually filled my request. I think that's awesome, nevermind the fact that the poutine was bomb!"

Certainly wasn't in the mood to eat a Big Mac that's for sure. I will admit though, the flavors tasted just like a Big Mac but the quality of the burger itself was better than a Big Mac, by a long shot. I didn't feel like I was eating a cheap burger at all. The meat was thick, cooked to medium, and the buns were fresh. If I ever go back, I'll try a different burger and revisit this review!"
/user_details?userid=2o_WkICnw_15jgwv03AMHQ,Annie A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This has been on my bookmarked list for quite some time now, so when my husband said he was craving a nice burger and hot dog, I jumped at the chance to cross this off my list. The interior is cute, it has a nice retro yet modern diner vibe to it with the silver stools. The bathroom was spotless which is always nice, and the fact that they had a change table and high chair is a plus when dining with my 1 year old. Once you are in the restaurant, it is stroller friendly with the wide and uncluttered space, but be warned, the entrance is far from stroller or disability friendly, thankfully we had some nice fellow diners help us navigate those stairs and the double doors.The menu itself is simple, which I appreciated! We tried the cheeseburger (omg, don't know how they do it but it melts in your mouth), the patty itself is just big enough, not one of those 1/2 lb burgers that's for sure and topped with your classic pickles, tomato, ketchup and mustard, onions and lettuce, it was flavorful, juicy but not greasy, something I'll come back for over and over again! The classic poutine was good, but not the best I've ever had. The hot dog was great, not overly salty mush but a good quality hot dog and the grilled cheese had a great amount of cheese with thick crusty bread, it was yummy . I also really enjoyed the root beer, so much better than the canned stuff you get."
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Chez Tousignant is tucked away a corner away from the Jean-Talon market, which means that if all those fresh veggies and fruits are not your type of happy food, you can always hop a street over and find comfort in hot, greasy and oh-so-good carbs and proteins. I think the heat that followed the opening has burned off a bit, because although it was a busy Saturday night, we all placed our orders within 10 mins. We got seats at the bar, and waited while watching sports. Habs were playing Rangers (and got eliminated booo).  The interior is super retro, with pastel colors, round diner stools and metal milkshake cups. All that was missing was a jukebox! The crew was wearing cool-looking Tousignant-branded caps and sweaters. Even the table mats looked good. In fact, I liked them so much I took a clean one home (and no I don't know what to do with it now). I got a double burger and my boyfriend a regular cheeseburger. We shared a Tousignant hot-dog. Our root beer float was actually Tousignant-brand, with the catchphrase ""Parce que vous l'meritez"" (Because you deserve it). We got our food after maybe 15 mins. The double burger and the hot-dogs were good, but I almost immediately regretted not getting the cheeseburger. What was I thinking?? A burger with no cheese is like a bed with no pillow! So I stepped back in line and ordered another cheeseburger. Then devoured it. We all left smiling in a state of beatitude, just like the small photograph of Frère André in the back of the kitchen. There's something about this little snack bar that's really, really special. Maybe it's the nostalgic vibe of it all, maybe it's the impeccable, yet simple comfort food it offers. What I'm sure of, however, is that I'll be back. Every day if I could afford it."

Nothing but love for this place.I got the burger and a milkshake. What people have said about the burger is true. It's the best. Really good patty, excellent bread and the cheese is perfectly melted and delicious. They also add a special sauce and it is delightful. The milkshake was also really good, a bit more milky than I prefer (I like it when there's more ice cream) but it didn't bother me. One of the best places in Montreal!"

We shared the cheeseburger, the Tousignant hot dog and the regular small poutine, We left feeling full. The burger was good but next time I want to try the Tousignant burger.As for the hot dog, I never had cheese and pickles on a hot dog before but it was so tasty! Both the burger and the hot dog were juicy and flavorful. The poutine however was just ok. Nothing special. I've had better poutine elsewhere. The fires were good and they put a lot of cheese which I liked. I think its the sauce I wasn't crazy about. The diner is cute. They played 80s music when we went. The food is fairly inexpensive and the service was quick. After reading all the reviews on yelp and hearing my friends talk about this diner, I think my expectations were just too high going in. It was good but it wasn't amazing. I felt like it was far to drive all the way from downtown for some fast food. However, if you are in the neighborhood and are craving fast food I definitely recommend it!"
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",5 star rating,"Holy bowl of cannelloni is this place ever amazing. I brought the family here after seeing photo after photo of burgers, hot dogs and fries being gobbled down here mostly by Yelper Khai. Also Yelper Jason's review intrigued me more to the point where I said to myself ""dammit I have to check this burger joint out"". How do I describe Tousignant? It's a local restaurant just on the edge of Marche Jean Talon. Burgers, roasted chicken, hot dogs and fries are the main focus of the menu. You enter the place climb up the stairs and have this delicious scent of flat top seared burgers. It's sensory overload. I ended up ordering the Tousignant burger w poutine. My mom would tell me to keep these meals to a minimum but it was crazy good. The burger had this delicious little crust and the rest of the ingredients were fresh and tasty. It kind of reminds me of In N Out or a local version of Shake Shack but different. You see the reason I say this is they have this Tousignant sauce which is similar to the sauce at those two mentioned restaurants. It's like a thousand islands salad dressing and adds that special zip to the burgers that pretty much delivers where it should. The poutine was on point as well. I ordered the small and it came out as a huge serving in generous large sized bowl. Brown sauce, potatoes that are hand cut and a bit sweet it's a great accompaignant to a burger meal. My wife ordered a burger not knowing the Tousignant sauce was mayo based and mentioned she couldn't eat it. They gladly did her another (no charge). Very kind of them and excellent customer service. My daughter had a hot dog which was served with coleslaw and pickles. Everyone was super content. They have a draft tap for hopefully when they get their liquor licence. That day will hopefully come sometime soon. I'd agree with Jason. This place is a classic in the making!"
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"In a few years I wouldn't be surprised to find Chez Tousignant one of Montreal's famous institutions.... known across ""la ville"" and tourist alike.... it's just a question of time. The location looks humble in Little Italy...small in size with deli-like sit-in counters/tables with limited seating. I'm anxious how the establishment will handle this seating issue when it gets truly popular but I guess it'll be a nice problem to have when it'll come. And it'll come soon! When I visited, they played 90ies music and videos and while that's real cool for me, it may not be for other patrons. I'm unsure if this plays all the time or if they mix it up?Anyways, how can I classify 'Chez Tous'? Well, I'd say it's a family oriented gourmet casse-croute with homemade solutions to your favorite types of comfort food such as burgers, hotdogs and poutines... but with a special touch that comes from true culinary experience and love. I've had my share of burgers and hotdogs but I never had them like I had them at Chez Tousignant. How many ""steamies"" have I stuffed down my pie hole in my lifetime? Too many to count but the single one I ate here left me craving for more to the point that when I see the picture of the Tousignant hotdog I ate on Yelp... I can feel my heart start to beat a little faster, I randomly check Yelp and Instagram for more pictures of this resto... and my mouth waters for no discernible reason. Folks... how can such food get such a hold of me??!And the burger? Good god, it was fresh, high quality ingredients and it simply melted in my mouth. It was so delightful but... so incredibly FILTHY good that I'd do unspeakable things for my next one..... preferably the Tousignant one with that same sauce I loved and MAPLE HAM? HELLLOOOOOOOOOOO.Ultimately, the food was a true 5 star experience, at least for me. The only reason I gave it 4 is quite simply the price-tag doesn't give value. Paying $15 for a burger and a hot dog with no sides or drinks to come with it doesn't sit well with me regardless how good the food is! No hot dog is worth $8. I'm sorry. After coming here 4 times.... fuck it.5 stars. .Nonetheless, if you're prepared to pay the price-tag, you're in for a good time. I'll be back."

The burgers are great too, especially the Tousignant burger with maple bacon. Their homemade donuts are pretty good too.The only downside are the fries. They're too starchy and not crispy enough. Not sure if it's an issue with frying temperature or the type of potato but the fries were the only thing keeping this from a 5 star review."

/user_details?userid=xnQ3ZT7XIh7NdzfWJTLsUQ,Vito C.,"Mont-Royal, Canada",5 star rating,"STOP THE PRESS!!! The burgers are unbelievably delicious! Nothing is frozen and bought. From their patties, hot-dogs, buns, fries everything is homemade. Even their sodas are homemade! The meat patty is thin but cooked on a flat-top so you get this crispy outer-layer and juicy on the inside...it's to die for! The buns are just the right size, the condiments are standard works (tomatoes, lettuce, onion, pickles), but it's the sauce that brings everything together. They actually replicated the ""Big Mac"" sauce. It tastes almost the same and looks the same. So you can just imagine a Big Mac made with wholesome, fresh, homemade ingredients- it's the Big Mac for grown ups...LOL! I'm not a big fan of hot-dogs, but I got to give them props. They give their dogs the same attention and care as the burgers so you know your going to eat a high-quality and tasty hot-dog.The only negative I have to say, and this is really a personal taste, the fries are a little too over-cooked for my liking. I like my fries lightly-golden and crispy. These are brown-crusted and a bit too soft. Although if you get the poutine, it's as traditional as you can get- everything just works!Finally, the service is great. Everyone is young, hip and always smiling. The place looks like a small 50's dinner with a eat-at-the-bar counter so you can drool while they are preparing your food. The music is cool 80's vibe, so perfect for a 47 year old like me reminiscing while eating a great burger."

I had the Tousignant hot dog, fries and a Maple Syrup cola. The idea of a homemade hotdog is delightful and glorious. I don't eat a lot of meat and hot dogs in particular are conflicting for me because I have always loved them since I was a kid getting them at street carts in Toronto or on the pier in LA or at the Jersey Shore, and I've tried to not think about what goes in them. The dogs at Tousignant taste like good memories without the preservatives-and-weird-parts panic. They are delicious and the topping are heaps of tastey and the bun is fresh and flavourful and good. The fries could have a been a little crispier maybe but they taste great.The young black guy working the front counter deserves 5 stars all on his own, super welcoming, super quick in both languages, efficient at working the line and getting people their food as it came out, even noticing that folks were slipping on the step on the way in and running out to salt the icy stair, wash his hands and not miss a beat with a grin for the next customer. Great staff and great vibes in general at this super sweet gourmet casse croute."

The biggest disappointment was the frozen custard. For $5 CAD, whereas soft serve is normally served with a large looping dollop at the top, this was served only level to the edge, resulting in a really small amount. I wouldn't recommend it, and the top gelato places in the city that people considered pricey give you much more for the money.It's a diner like atmosphere inside, faux retro, situated near the Marche Talon market."
/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,Julia D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"After hearing that Michele Forgione and Stefano Faita were opening up a casse-croute I was excited to see what a more upscale version of this Quebec symbol would be like.  For those of you who are scratching their heads when they see the word casse-croute it basically refers to a snack bar.  They tend to be small, local spots where you can grab a cheap and greasy meal.  I thought that since Chez Tousignant was generating so much buzz it was best to come on a weekday at lunch when it might be quieter but it must always be busy because when I showed up most of the seats were occupied and shortly after I placed my order a long line formed.  I can imagine that on weekends it would be a zoo.  Let me tell you that there is a good reason for these crowds.  Lunch for me was a cheeseburger and poutine.  Everything is made fresh to order here and you can see them in the kitchen working hard to make sure your food gets to you quickly.  I sat at the counter overlooking the kitchen and the staff were working constantly.  As a consequence I didn't have to wait long at all (maybe a little more than five minutes tops).That cheeseburger is just out of this world delicious.  They use 100 % local beef beef chuck and it was grilled to perfection.  The exterior of the patty was slightly charred and crispy while the inside was so juicy.  From my understanding they even make their own buns here so these potato buns are fresh and of very high calibre.  They are toasted to have just the right amount of crunch on the outside while still being soft and chewy on the inside.  The burger is garnished with their signature Tousignant sauce which I'm pretty sure is mayo-based and adds a nice touch to it.Now you can't bill yourself as a casse-croute and not serve a good poutine.  That would be sacrilege.  The poutine here is just the right balance of fries, curds and gravy.  That gravy was velvety and well-balanced in flavour.  If you're getting something like a burger or hot dog then play it safe and get a small poutine since it is more than enough.  I struggled to finish the small one after the cheeseburger.  The large would be good if that is all you plan to eat.The price tag might seem excessive to some people at first glance.  A cheeseburger, poutine and ginger ale set me back $20.  At the same time we're not talking your average burger joint here.  They are using such high quality ingredients and putting so much labour into the final product that it will be more expensive then your typical neighbourhood casse-croute.  But you know what?  It will also taste a lot better."

The layout and atmosphere is really classic yet un-ratchet. I also eyed two beer taps said to be used sometime in the future. That'd be pretty revolutionary.You can call it a chic 5-star câsse-croute. But ouch, almost $9 for a toasted hot dog, no sides or drinks. I'm not convinced by the value proposition here."
/user_details?userid=ZGiwU16rhGvWAYUzkWL0xw,Boz X.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"The staff is friendly and helpful so I obtained a brief description of each item on the menu before proceeding to order. I had the tousignant cheese burger, michigan hotdog, fries, and an evergreen soda.The TOUSIGNANT Cheeseburger is reaaal good (4.5/5)... especially for a burger cooked on a hot plate. The flavours of the ham, onion, cheese, sauce, and patty came together very well. They make their own ground chuck, wieners, and bread (wut). The only thing they don't make are the cheese curds and Heinz dressings (obviously). Front desk described the 'tousignant' sauce to be similar to the big mac sauce, but superior because of the high quality ingredients that go into it. The rest well... were underwhelming.Michigan hotdog (average tasting, terrible for 7$ before taxes) consists of a buttered and toasted hotdog bun with a homemade wiener that tastes like the ones sitting on the shelves of supermarkets, a homemade bland tomato meat sauce, and locally made cheese curds.The fries (3$, not a lot) are the type that native quebecers would enjoy: fluffy on the inside, greasy, and not crispy at all. The fries are brown and a bit black which suggests overcooking at low temperature.The soda that tastes like evergreen (3.50$) was particular. It's a good alternative to root beer sodas in my opinion, except I don't pay 3.50$ for a bottle of root beer, so why should I pay 3.50$ for an evergreen-flavoured soda?Overall, the experience has been pleasant in my mouth, but it's a whole other story for my credit card. That's the main reason I give this place an overall of 3/5 -- no hot dog of that size is worth 7$."

The detail and effort from Gema and Impasto but in our favorites - gourmet casse-croute. Now that is what I'm talking about. If you don't get it, stop and read Hoang-Khai review and hear the music. I was so excited to try this out when I first heard about it. Now I can't get it out of my head. The Chef Yann Turcotte is a great guy. He loves to cook and he loves making amazing simple but good quality casse-croute food.  And here they do everything from scratch, Yann took the time to tell us how the meat in the burgers is fresh, direct and good cuts of meat. Same meat from the burgers are used for their hand made hot dogs. Did you hear me? OMG Home made bread, dessert...everything except the ketchup. It is a must try and likely a try again and again."

I mean seriously, everything here is fresh and homemade, from the burgers, buns, pies, even the hotdogs! Although greasy food isn't typically my #1 pick, if I'm going to have it, this is where I want to eat it! Tousignant excels at the classics you'd expect from a diner, but done much better than you've ever had. Everything was fresh and made to order. I shared the small poutine, which was huge & delicious. I also had a regular burger. The meat was very fresh and tasty, and was perfectly balanced by the homemade bun. A bit too much mayo for my taste, but overall great burger. This place is backed by the Impasto and Gema guys, which definitely brings a lot of cred. We met the owner/chef who was such a nice and friendly guy. He showed us the pictures on the wall which are old black and whites of his family. The name ""Tousignant"" is actually his moms last name. We talked a lot about food, and told us he not only makes his own hamburger meat, he also makes his own hotdog sausages, all from beef shoulder! Can't wait to try the hotdogs now! My meal ended with a chocolate milkshake, made from their homemade chocolate custard ice cream."

That being a $5 one, and ate it while walking and talking in the cold. Needless to say I had to get it down before it became cold and lost the crispness of the toasted bun and warm to cool experience of the toppings to steamed larger than typical elongated meat roll. It's no all beef job, but then that wouldn't be considered classic. While waiting for my quick snack I took in the ambiance, and there is a lot of it. A very 50s black and white vibe. The pie under glass thing, the old school menu fonts and signage. Counter stools and friendly banter.I'll be back to try what I've been told by some pros is a heck of a burger and poutine. Looked good on the tables around, but then again I also saw a lot of wrapper balled up and empty pop bottles. More tasting and slurping needed, and I'm pretty sure they'll ramp up to 5 right quick, and I'll get more of a grasp why the prices are a fair bit more than the many corner casse-croûtes en ville (snack bars in town).

Why I keep returning, because of the hotdog, which is the the tastiest I have ever, ever had, the hotdog itself, the homemade bun, the coleslaw are perfect. It is so tasty that I haven't bothered yet to try their burgers. Their poutine competes with some of the best examples of this classical Quebec dish in Montreal, the paprika adds and extra flavour. Combined with the fact they have two beers on tap, there is no reason not to grab a hotdog and share poutine with a friend in Chez Tousignant while visiting Little Italy and surroundings. Enjoy!"

Stefano Faita should review its standards of quality vs prices vs. service.WOW! What a bad story it was. To read...- Their hotdog at $ 7.75 is just a vulgar hotdog sausage (which Tousignant claims to be made from 100% local beef and beef). Okay. But after having tasted it, I judge that the proportion is rather 30% of their 100% local meat ... mixed with 70% of bad fillings. But it's definitely a little better than the Hygrade sausage!- Their cheeseburger at $ 7.50 is a shame for the smallness of its meat and its small slice of Kraft cheese. If at least it was a fresh slice of thicker Cheddar. But tomatos and onions are cut into very thick slices ... with a lot of iceberg lettuce. Wow!- If you like fries dull and greasy, go Chez Tousignant!- If you order chicken to take-out, make sure your cup of BBQ sauce is not only half filled ... and that your chicken piece is full before you leave.Do not deign to complain about their incompetence, unless you accept to be humiliated to have done it by the Chef himself.

The hot dog takes the win here, with cheese, bacon, pickles and special sauce it gives the perfect flavours but didn't take away from the homemade dog itself was juicy, smoky and delicious. The fries were my favorite type (Lafleur style) and the homemade gravy had plenty of flavour but lacked salt. The burger was also good and juicy but nothing overly special. I topped it off with a mediocre vanilla milkshake. Everything was a little pricy, but perfect to fill that fast-food pang we all get from time to time."

I'm a foodie that embraces the grease and all the fat things possible so from the smell of it I liked it right when I stepped in. Small little place, a few tables and also high tables which I think are cool and you can't find much like that in restos anymore. The staff is friendly and I love the open kitchen concept. BUT sorry to disappoint all you readers. It was a disappointment. I got the small poutine and a tousignant cheese burger. The poutine sauce was decent but wasn't thick enough. Flavour could have been better. Fries got soggy super fast. They weren't crispy, wasn't potatoey enough for my liking. I do appreciate that the cheese was scattered everywhere and not just in the middle of the bowl. The sauce should have been so much hotter where it could melt the cheese curds because when I was eating it the cheese was still cold and hard. A good poutine has to be a balance of squeaky cheese and melty strings as well. The fries needs to be crispier, I suggest frying it twice so it keeps its crispiness longer. The burger was dry and nothing special. The burger meat was lacking seasoning and flattened too much where it lost all its juices. Burger was topped with cheese, purple onions, pickles, tomato, lettuce and their special Sauce (tasted like a spicy mayo). Overall, I will not be returning here and I really don't think it's worth the $17.55 I paid for a poutine and burger. I would NOT recommend."

Other Yelpers told us that they serve the best burgers here so why not?  I tried both the hot dog and the cheeseburger.  The hot dog was served with bacon, cheese and pickles and it was good.  However the portion was a bit small so I went for a second order and had the legendary cheeseburger and it blew my mind. It melted in my mouth and the beef patty was done just right (a little burnt on the grill which made it crunchy). A full burger would fill up one person for sure. I should've ordered the burger first. Next time I am going to go for the petit poutine which looked super good. During our Uber ride here, even the driver was aware of the popularity of this new location.  My friend discovered that this spot was only opened for two months and it's so popular already - ""Instant success!""  Note the seats here weren't the most comfy and the wait time can be long if it is during busy hours.  With the amount of visitors,  they can easily expand it into a full restaurant."

Having been to many burger restaurants that range from fancy and expensive to greasy and cheap, Chez Tousignant hit the spot beautifully! Every bite of the way. Upon entering I was a bit turned off by the large crowd and very compact space. I had a long wait ahead of me. Don't let that turn you off! Yes, the place is very small and often crowded, yet that is a good sign of success and doing things right. Which they do! I wanted to go simple when ordering. So I chose a regular burger with extra bacon. Do keep in mind the burger along with the buns everything is completely homemade. Along with fries, of course! Again homemade from freshly cut spuds! Upon ordering I noticed how kind and professional their staff was. Friendly and helpful as well. Which is a must! We waited about 10-15 mins for our meal. Again, every bite worth waiting for. Finally we were lucky enough to grab a table. While waiting, we enjoyed the great variety of 80's tunes.. Great choice! Now, time to eat! Our burgers arrived wrapped and served hot. Fries were golden and crispy. Not salty! Bacon was crisp with a great smokey touch. Tomato lettuce and onion, fresh and ripe. Their hot dogs are like no other. Long, perfectly cooked and homemade.. Nothing like those other greasy joints(You know who they are!) Overall the food was outstanding!! Great place and very reasonably priced as well. Anything negative? Yes!

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"In Quebec, the casse-croute is a tradition. That little neighbourhood joint where you get a nice simple breakfast, a greasy lunch, dinner or even just a coffee and a doughnut. Nowadays for most of us, we think of casse-croutes as those greasy spots by the highway or the Belle Province you go to grab a bit after a late night outing. Not exactly the highest of quality.As an unabashed fan of Michele Forgione and Stefano Faita - and their drive to make everything homemade within their restaurants GEMA and Impasto - All the ""test"" pictures of burgers, bread, hot dogs and doughnuts that Michele has been posting on Instagram for the past year or so have been killing me. When would we be getting this ideal old school casse-croute? Finally, just prior to the holidays, it finally arrived: Chez Tousignant run by Impasto's previous chef de cuisine (and originator of the idea) Yann Turcotte. I was away for 2 weeks but as soon as I came back, it was clear that I needed to finally satisfy the cravings from all those pictures.Located on Drolet near the Jean Talon market, Chez Tousignant has a great old school diner look - the neon sign in front, the ceramic tiled floor, the metal-topped tables and counters, the stools. Everything even down to the menu signs fits the old style.Foodwise, this is a casse-croute through and through. On my first visit, I went classic - a Michigan hot dog and some fries. The fries were great - as you need at a diner - but right now, we NEED to focus on that hot dog. Homemade all-beef dog. Homemade potato bun. Topped with homemade meat sauce and cheese curds. Good lord this thing was amazing. Officially the best hot dog I have ever had and it's not even close. The all-natural beef frank is such a change from the usual industrial variety. Cooked on the griddle, it had a nice crunch to it while still having a nice tender texture inside. And that bun..... oh that bun. Man, they nailed it. When you add the buttered grilling on the griddle, that dense yet soft bun gets a nice rich crunch to it. Rare is the time where one hot dog would fill me up but this one hit the spot. When you're doing hot dogs with ingredients with this quality, that's what you get apparently.The second time around, I went for some other classic casse-croute staples - cheeseburger and poutine. The cheeseburger - served with special sauce, lettuce, onion as well as tomato and pickle if you wish - was another hit for me. The potato bun was once again spectacular - god I need to learn to make these - with that same buttery goodness off the griddle. The meat was meaty with a nice crust, the cheese was nicely melted on-top and the sauce added a nice little creaminess. A classic yet spectacular burger.The poutine was a beauty as well. First off, curds at the bottom. Not just on-top. Big hit with me. A very nice touch. Anyway, we've got here a generous portion of fries with plenty of curds and some amazing gravy. This wasn't some off the shelf St-Hubert gravy mix. So dark and rich, the gravy ties the whole thing together. It's amazing how given all the ways that people feel the need to dress up a poutine now if you just use the best elements, the classic one is simply the best.On top of all this goodness, there is even more! Chez Tousignant also does a pie of the day and some doughnuts for dessert. I went with a doughnut because I couldn't resist the beautiful stack of doughnuts on-top of the counter. An old-fashion cake doughnut with a vanilla bean glaze. The doughnut itself was dense but nicely chewy - sweet with a touch of cinnamon. The glaze though was the impressive part to me. The vanilla bean came through nicely and the glaze was firm - no stickiness whatsoever - but cracked nicely once you bite into it.Lastly, I went with a milkshake because of course I did. Chez Tousignant does chocolate or vanilla. I tried one of each on my two visits. Rich and smooth in both cases with nice deep flavour. You actually got chocolate or vanilla flavour - not just milk with a hint of either one.Chez Tousignant was a blast in the past in the best way possible. A true casse-croute where care is taken to make everything homemade because that is how you provide the best to your clients. All through the process of testing, chef Forgione labeled all his pictures with #ParceQueVousLeMeritez - that's the essence of what Chef Turcotte and the Chez Tousignant team are about - it may be lots of work but as a client, you cannot help but appreciate the craftsmanship on display.Cheers!"

The fries were also mediocre. Not crispy, not hot and absolutely no seasoning. I had a bite of the poutine as well. There was not enough sauce, the sauce was under seasoned and the poutine got cold within a few minutes. All in all terrible experience."

Overpriced, and a little scrambled, the service was friendly but the food was a bit uninspired and too salty. The poutine gravy was disappointing but the cheese curds were delicious. Custom touches and garnishes (like included sides such as pickles or coleslaw) would have improved the value. A tidy bathroom and fixed stools were a nice touch, but overall the experience left me wanting more. With a few improvements, they will secure themselves as the hippest casse croûte du quartier."

The burger patty although juicy and delicious is quite small, maybe 1/4 lb. Given the steep price, I'd expect more beef! Also, your Kraft yellow cheese on your cheeseburger, needs to go."

French fry & gravy came with gravy, extra salt & cayenne pepper. The only thing that you could taste was salt. Do NOT recommend, disappointed!!!"
