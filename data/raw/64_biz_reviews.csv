The biscuit was super buttery, the sausage/corn bread/pecan stuffing tasty and sweet. The Mac and cheese was saucy with a nice cheesy taste. It's rare to find a place where everything is so good. We ordered for takeout, it was ready quickly and the girl was super nice at the window."
/user_details?userid=5HiO4RFBVtAc7EY6w2mmRg,Vanessa V.,"Côte Saint-Luc, Canada",3 star rating,this is too expensive and the service was weird as F***. the fried chicken isnt that good and the mashed potatoes are so bland and meh. and how in the world the dessert is 8.5 plus tx? at a high end restaurant its 10 LOL. i thought it was ridiculous..
/user_details?userid=xg_96kkO-lF9oCc1PzrQgA,Leo L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I am so glad I found this restaurant, and I loved their soul food cuisine here. What a finger-licking experience.I had the pulled pork, sided with a small Mac n' Cheese, one piece of fried chicken and hushpuppies. This combo satiated my crave. I loved their fun selection of sauces. I had to try them all, and I suggest you do too. My favorite was their Tabasco style sauce, followed by their (smoked?) BBQ sauce.For every big meal you need a convenient drink. I accompanied this delight with a Beau's beer, which smoothly joined the feast. Their cocktail and beer selection is tempting for a Dinoysian encounter.Staff was polite, thoughtful and quick. Loved it.Their music taste went well with their décor and the concept. Surely I will be coming back."
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I came to Dinette Triple Crown with a friend to experience their Kentucky influenced brunch menu. I am a huge fan of Southern cuisine, but I have never tried proper Kentucky styled cuisine. The location is quite convenient if you're driving in- with plenty of street parking. The venue itself is a bit run down- it does have a cabane a sucre kind of feel to it. I ordered the cheese sausage biscuit sandwich was approximately $15 (if I recall properly) 2/5 starts. This dish completely disappointed in presentation, it was served on a tea cup plate (literally not kidding) and there was no sides that came with the sandwich. The sandwich itself was enjoyable but not filling. I definitely would not pay over 10$ for this dish. When I spoke to the staff- I was told that the biscuits and sausage are handmade. They can still throw in a green salad, can't they. So I took the freedom to order more sides including: the mac n cheese- 4/5 (quite good), sweet potato wedges-4/5 (also quite good). The cocktails weren't bad. My friend had the infamous chicken and waffles (3/5) I have sampled better. It's disappointing as I feel the price of items should reflect what you are paying for. I was told the brunch menu is temporary. I am still open to trying out their picnic basket menu (it's seems like a really cool concept to be able to take a picnic basket out to the park that can be returned after dining), but brunch is definitely not on my list."
/user_details?userid=DD4KCmjAdJiJfv6yJcb4Uw,Virginia L.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,By far the best BBQ spot in Montreal peeps. I love coming here and seeing the same staff and having a Kentucky Mule cocktail while I wait for my meal. The ambiance reminds me of an old timey southern diner. The jars of pickled veggies lining the walls adds a special touch along with the owners family photos. I was informed that one of the owners is from Kentucky and he has brought along his love for Bourbon with him.

Yes, I'm a fried chicken kinda girl and don't ever ask me to eat finger foods with a fork and knife. Also, don't ask me to go to Bird Bar or Fabergé. No thanks. Tell me Popeyes or Mon Ami? Now we're talking. Still gotta checkout Howlin' Ray's in the west coast though. Dinette Triple Crown has been on my list for the longest time ever and how do you start your day on the right foot? By ordering The Big Nasty sandwich- A buttermilk chicken waffle sandwich drenched in a succulent gravy sauce. JUST LOOKATTHIS BEAUTY!As much as this picture is very mouth watering, here is my verdict: Brown meat? Check. Crispy regardless of the gravy? CHECK! But here is the deal breaker for me: The entire dish itself was way too salty. The biscuit was salty, the fried chicken was salty, the gravy was salty.  I'm salty, but this was hella salty. Overall The Big Nasty deserves a solid 6.8/10.Remember, just because it's picture worthy doesn't mean it's worth your money."
/user_details?userid=ii7yC1Md8oyW_a2YJ2bzlA,Michelle N.,"Scarborough, Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a beautiful take out spot in Montreal, where they offer you picnic baskets for you to enjoy your meal in the park next to the restaurant. We decided to dine in and were seated relatively quickly. We decided to go with the Meat & Threes, which came with fried chicken, mac & cheese and hush puppies. The food was hearty and delicious. My favourite was the hush puppies!! They were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and the sauce that was drizzled on it was extremely flavourful. I definitely will come back the next time I am in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=akCG-uYnMqaRR0fr1zpyig,David G.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Went here with coworkers and our experience was pretty average. We all ordered slightly different combos but most of us got the fried chicken. It was quite dry, and overcooked, though I liked the seasoning. The Mac and cheese was probably the best part of the meal, though it is a dish that rarely fails. I ordered the fried sweet potatoes as my third side but I guess they forgot to include it into the takeout. I tried my friend's portion and I wasn't missing out on much. Even the moist towelette that came with takeout was dry. For $20 I thought this was really not worthwhile."
/user_details?userid=3FrXYUTywEhmO8rTMq18XA,John J.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The food here quite literally arouses me. The only thing I don't like is the cornbread because it legitimately tastes like eating a spoonful of sand. Get the fried chicken, hush puppies, sweet potatoes, and mac and cheese :) Desert is awesome too and seems fully made in house (even the whipped cream)You may need an ambulance to take you out of the restaurant though after you suffer from congestive heart failure."
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"Picnic dinner + southern comfort food = Dinette Triple Crown. We came for an early Monday dinner. I wasn't expecting the inside to be so small but there's something like 8 seats. Turns out that was the takeout area. Oops. The main dining area is around the corner. The menu is pretty straightforward. Meats (fried chicken, pulled pork and smoked brisket), sandwiches, salad and sides. Their picnic idea is genius! Only unfortunate thing is they're not allowed to pack any open alcoholic drinks. But the park across the street is perfect for enjoying the sun and good eats. - M Jodoin cider ($9.00) - pretty standard cider. Not much to write home about. - Ginger beer ($4.00) - I'm on a ginger beer binge. Pretty good but hands down my fav  was from Agrikol. - Meat & threes ($19.00) - we picked pulled pork, mac & cheese (which counts as two sides) and hush puppies. Pulled pork had a tangy mustard sauce. Good but a bit more tender would have been ideal. Mac & cheese was a good portion to share and liked how it wasn't too heavy. Winners was the hush puppies! You get 6 scrumptious bites of heaven. Make sure to dip into the sauce for extra flavour. Definitely need to come back to try the fried chicken. Love the originality of their picnic idea. Matches well with the food they're putting out."
/user_details?userid=iKL3S5TBIZ8RtNOQG599pg,Brittany L.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"OKAY THIS IS THE BEST BBQ PLACE EVER! I literally was inlove with everything I ate ESPECIALLY the Brussels sprouts that they are currently selling at a seasonal dish. Man you need to order that if it's still on the menu, it's definitely a MUST! I'll start off with my experience. My friend brought me here while I was on vacation we walked into the main room for breakfast/brunch time and it was full of people family style eating, the waiter told us to go next door which as their other side to the resturant & we did and it was a more of intimate feel as if we were at someone's house and small. Our waiter knew her stuff and answered all the questions and recommend some great  things and was honest about others. She's actually the one who recommended the Brussels sprouts but I wanted to get something else but I trusted her and man am I ever happy I did! ... we got our food and drinks and me and my friend felt like we were in heaven! You have to order the Mac n cheese, fried chicken, Brussels, hush puppies AND biscuit. We literally licked our fingers it was so good! Every time I go back to visit Montreal I will DEFINITELY Becoming here I just wish my own city had one! But then again maybe not becuase I'd gain like 50lbs from eating there every week hahaha!"

/user_details?userid=_K9sKlA4fVkWI4hyGSpoPA,Robert G.,"Clackamas County, OR",3 star rating,"Dinette Triple Crown is getting 3 stars from me and that might be generous.  I see the overwhelming number of 5 stars and, after eating there, it causes me to shake my head.I expected this place to be on the Plateau or up in Ahuntsic or over in Villeray.  Instead, it is pretty much on the southwestern fringe of Little Italy, on Rue Clark.  I took a look at the place and got the feel once inside, based on the physical plant, the clientele, and the employees, and knew it was all about concept.  In this case, the concept is to bring Southern (comfort) food up to Montreal and make it hip and cool.Once inside, it isn't all that nice (picnic type tables) and the employees were sort of aloof.  They were on point as far as you getting your order in and answering your questions.  The food also arrived in a timely manner.I ordered a brisket type platter, with accompaniments such as beans and coleslaw.  Dressings and sauces to make what I had niftier were also added to the platter and its presentation.  However, the brisket wasn't cooked to my liking, I didn't exactly like its coloring, and there wasn't enough of it.  The other items, save the sauces on them, were also sort of unremarkable and I felt the prices were too high for what you got.I've gotten better food of this genre in Houston for less money (after the currency conversion) and more of it.  So, for being sort of bland, not offering much in the way of a comfortable eatery, and for the uniform sullenness, I should give Dinette Triple Crown 2 stars, as a few others have been brave enough to go against groupthink and do.  However, giving them the benefit of the doubt, largely based on seeing dishes being delivered that seemed to have more food on them and keeping some folks happy, I'm going to say that Dinette Triple Crown could eke out 3 stars.  I doubt I'll be going back to find out."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been wanting to try this place out for so long. Southern comfort food is my JAM. Fried chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, MAC AND CHEESE, biscuits, the menu is sublime, packed with so much goodness. Service is really fast. I called for a pickup of five meals and the lady told me it would be ready in 15 minutes! That's hella quick! They're so nice and hospitable when they welcome you (oh that southern charm).The food is AMAZING. Honestly, could not get any better. I loved everything I tried, and it was a lot! (mac and cheese, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, biscuit, hushpuppy)I would order the mac and cheese without the green onions, but otherwise a very solid candidate for best mac and cheese in town."
/user_details?userid=laal7qQcqdnRx8jzxmx16A,Candy R.,"Nashville, TN",4 star rating,"We came here during our vacation looking for a good restaurant where we could bring the kids. The space is small and many opt to do takeout or use a picnic basket and eat at the park across the street. We got lucky and were seated at one of the communal tables. We had to wait a bit before our order was taken, but our server was very nice. I am a Southerner, and have to say the food was pretty close to the mark. The pulled pork (and sauces), biscuit, beans, kimchee salad  (an exception to the Southern theme), and iced tea were all very good. I tried the fried chicken and it was less true to what I am accustomed to, but not bad.Worth our metro ride and an enjoyable way to end our trip to Montreal."

Killer cocktail's, I'd name them but no point, they're all good pick what you like and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. We had all the meats on the menu and they were great, the stand out was the pulled pork. Not that stringy drowned in bbq garbage, nice chunks of meat well seasoned and spiced, we were a group of 4 and we loved it!! All the sides were super tasty as well. I was stuffed but had the sweet potato pie for dessert and was glad I did, not like that supermarket stuff all, light and not to sweet. Great food and excellent service for a truly great experience, keep up the good work!!"
/user_details?userid=_iXst4txxHr1Q1pJMLV_CA,Courtney W.,"Houston, TX",5 star rating,"Once again my Yelp family came through. Each city I travel I always like to try their soul food to see how it varies from at home and luckily, DTC was a winner. I came on a Saturday afternoon and seen there was a line out the door. Not knowing this was for to-go orders only,  I waited and listened to what other people were ordering  (Lol). There is another door to the L for dine-in customers. Most people placing to-go orders were doing what's called a Picnic package where you order the foos, all the items are placed in to-go containers to include silverware, etc. and placed in a picnic basket. You can then walk across the street to find an open picnic table and enjoy your meal and drink outside at the park. I LOVED this idea. And actually more people were doing this than dining inside.  On the other side is the small-spaced dining area of picnic type tables that seats about 30-35 people. The waitress brought a food and cocktail menu. To drink I tried the Briar Patch which consisted of bourbon,  chile and some other ingredients. It had a spicy kick to it but surprisingly was pretty good. The food choices is one meat and 3 sides.  My mind was set on the brisket but the waitress recommended the fried chicken so I went with that instead. The sides I chose were braised greens and maac n cheese. FYI, mac n cheese counts as 2 sides. The food was brought out about 10 minutes later and looked delicious. They have on each table 6 different sauces which consisted of a tomato-based, South Carolina mustard (tangy), Habanero, Jalapeno, Memphis BBQ and a yellow-ish one that was the hottest of them all. I tried all 6 and my favs were the SC mustard mixed with the jalapeno. So good. The food was one of the best meals I'd had in Montreal. I'm glad I went with the fried chicken because it was juicy,  flavorful and the outer part was very crisp. I literally ate down to the bone! The greens and mac were good as well but the chicken stole the show. The dessert options were blueberry pie and s chocolate walnut rum something. Both sounded good but I was too stuffed to eat another bite of anything. This is one place I will definitely come back to when I visit again. The staff were all nice and very attentive and the food again was really good!  Kudos"

It's a cool vibe to this place kinda old school kinda not , overall we enjoyed our meal & drinks! It's nice to go there in the summer & do the picnic at the park if you're into eating outside but the food idea reminds me of your typical bbq food and that's great!"
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Pros:- Easy to find street parking - Restaurant side was cosy & well heated- Menu is simple to order from - Plate sharing- Friendly wait staffCons: - Tables quite high so a small kid would have his plate probably at the level of his mouth...which is not a bad thing given how good the food is, he could just shovel the food right in!  :pWe ordered the amers & soda, brisket, mac'n cheese, hushpuppies, fried sweet potatoes as a side and a custard pie and that was quite good for 2 people.  I think the fried sweet potatoes were the most wondrous thing that I've had in a while!   Sweet potato cubes fried on the outside with a crispy caramelized outer layer with a soft and sweet inside. Covered in a delightful savory sauce and sprinkled with green onions. Then there's the hushpuppies, which is fried cornbread dough with onions inside and a nice fried dry exterior. It's prefect because is not loaded with grease. Served with a chive ranch sauce. It's slightly sweet flavor is balanced with the ranch.  These two sides are a MUST HAVE!! TIP: If you get the brisket you have to eat it first because it dries out fast! When it's hot, it is juicy and tender. Mac'n cheese was with Scooby Doos and cooked to al dente smothered with a thick cheese & beer sauce and gratiné. It's a little heavy so best to share. OkThe pie had a very crispy crust, a lemony flavor in the custard and two slices of preserved peaches. It was yummy :)"
/user_details?userid=eG1Tur78lGPRLPysNSzadQ,Donald S.,"Boca Raton, FL",5 star rating,"So I think I kinda possibly maybe love this place. Yes I know it's a southern diner in Canada of all places. And not just Canada, but Montreal, The North American answer to France; but something just feels right. Dinette triple crown transports you to a different place and time. If the menu wasn't in French, you would have thought you fell asleep and woke up in Tennessee circa 1956. The diner theme is perfectly executed. And how would I rate our friends from the north's interpretation of southern fare? Pretty damn good! -Fried chicken: Very respectable fried chicken, well seasoned and juicy. Plenty of sauces to accompany (i recommend the peach habanero and the Memphis BBQ). -Mac and cheese: huge serving of piping hot Mac, with extra cheese sauce all topped off with bread crumbs. Maybe a tad bit of salt would have put it over the top but it is Quite satisfying, and better than most. -buttermilk biscuit: save the best for last. I like to think of myself as a biscuit connoisseur . As much as I love them, id say most are mediocre at best. This is easily inserted into the top 3 I have ever consumed. Warm, Flaky, buttery, soft, moist. There is absolutely nothing that can make this biscuit any better. This is how it should be done. It is worth mentioning that you of course get to hospitality that the Canadians are known for, as that only adds to the overall experience.This southern American has been won over......"
/user_details?userid=3QnoTcrxuafMCoTzW_AH7A,Sari Marissa G.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"Some pretty incredible southern food! It's kind of ironic that it's located up north! Go figure! It's really perhaps the best we've had anywhere, even in the south! The owners who are super sweet and friendly are from Kentucky however. One of the owners sister actually lives not too far from where I'm from which was kind of neat! Really such a small world, isn't it? Everything is made from scratch including those sinful hush puppies drenched in creamy dill drizzle. O. M. G. Hubs said the double fried chicken was total perfection. Perfectly creamy mashed potatoes, baked mac and cheese, down home flavored cornbread, big, flaky homemade buttery biscuits and a variety of house made sauces to taste and play with. Wow. Don't come thinking about your waistline and you'll thoroughly enjoy yourself! The drinks were fantastic as well. The ""Dark & Stormy"" was one of the best I've ever had. It was made with their house ginger beer and bitters which I think made all the difference. Delish! I loved the partially open kitchen and bar! Our bartender was also a gem of guy! The immediate space isn't too large. Counter seating, but oh so cozy. Perfect southern notes such as burlap covered walls, chalkboard signage and Mason jars. There's also a big front window which we were able to catch a lovely, romantic pink sunset from! Bonus! There is another large dining room next door actually, with communal farmhouse style table. (See my photo) The spot next door, just to the left of the main entrance is also where the restrooms are located, is candle lit and dark. Perfect really. Loved the vibes as well as the vintage racing horse photos. Probably a nod to their Kentucky (Derby) roots. Love it! You can see the care and thought that went into, and continues to go into the menu, space and ingredients. For instance, the restaurant flew up candy roaster seeds which are indigenous to the south and grew the variety of squash here in Quebec just for their seasonal pies! That's speaks volumes to me. After you've had your fill of poutine and other traditional Montreal  nosh, COME HERE!! I know it seems like kind of an odd place to eat while in this region, but seriously, don't miss it! Hubs does not give out 5 stars generously and this was without question, an absolute 5 star experience! Fantastic service, taste, quality and all around feel. Oh, and they pack their food in baskets for you to picnic across the street in the park! So sweet!"
/user_details?userid=FxBGQ-jHWM0Th5YD2zNPXg,Adrienne P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Triple Crown is my weakness. I'm so glad it isn't closer to my house. I eat there more often than I should as it is!In the summer, I love to get a picnic basket with family and/or friends to enjoy a meal in the park. I'm one of those people who sticks to what she loves, so I always order the fried chicken, vinegar slaw, fried sweet potatoes and a buttermilk biscuit. I am never disappointed. The food is authentic southern comfort. My niece and my partner love the mac 'n cheese, so we usually order a big one of those. And no southern picnic would be complete without some pink lemonade in a mason jar. I love that the whole thing comes in a real wicker basket with real utensils, plates, tablecloth, etc. I don't know if anyone ever steals the the basket, but it would feel like stealing from my grandma's kitchen. There is something so warm and welcoming about the place. Pretty much everything I've had there is fantastic. The only thing I didn't love was the cornbread, but that's just because we make it sweet where I'm from. If you have never been, you should go. If you have been, you should go back. Just know that you will probably have to wait in line unless you called ahead. Also, the dining room is quite small, so if you plan to eat on-site, don't show up with 50 of your best friends, or you'll have to eat in shifts."
/user_details?userid=g6lAGkVpCxP4UldT5FwgOw,Dickson Y.,"Milliken, Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"Restaurant is fairly humble looking from the outside.  No flashy signs or decors.  This place has a private dining area adjacent to the small take-out front.  The restaurant is packed on a Friday night.  We waited 45mins before being seated (we had no prior reservation).  Each of us chose the ""Meat and Threes"" which is choose one meat and three sides OR choose one meat, one Mac and cheese and one side.  My order was pulled pork, Mac and cheese, creamy coleslaw with a side order of fried chicken.  Our orders came promptly, served in large plates.We were starving and began devouring each others food immediately.  On meats, the pulled pork is definitely more juicy compared to the smoked brisket and fried chicken.  Breading on the chicken is crisp but inside is a little dry.  Smoked brisket is average in texture/taste.  Side dish of mac and cheese provided a huge kick of creamy cheese.  Moving to the sides, the coleslaw is a creamy balance to the meats.  The hush puppies are also good too.  I would avoid braised greens for the mushy leafy texture.  Overall, it was a good dining experience.  Food was pleasing to the palette.  Service was attentive with empty water jugs refreshed with new ones.  I would come back here for group dining or to grab a quick take-out."

Great food and great company always win.This place is small little resto, a street beside Little Italy. I didn't think their fried chicken would be anything special (because my friend hyped it up) and was a little shook when I saw the price of them. WORTH EVERY CENT. I really don't know what it is but their chicken is probably the most delicious fried chicken I've ever tasted. Their Mac-n-Cheese is also freaking delicious. I wouldn't think it would be, just because I feel so many places just don't put effort into the mac-n-cheese. Their mash potatoes and gravy as well is just heavenly! Just writing this review a few days after having it, makes me want to go back and get some.  I love that they provide a picnic concept since they're just across from a park. It really allows you to enjoy the company of your friends, the food and just the outdoors. The one thing that worries me about this place is, during the winter! This place is just so small I can't imagine when everyone wants to sit and eat inside."

Finally had the chance to try their brunch this past weekend. I knew I was getting the chicken and waffles before I came. I was looking forward to trying it here for a while...and it did not disappoint! First the chicken: 2 pieces of their perfect fried chicken. No one does it better. And the waffles: cheddar and chives waffles. At first that sounded unusual to me ( and I'm not a big fan of chives), but I absolutely loved them! Worked great with the chicken too!Should point out the staff was super friendly too! Note: the brunch menu will be ending soon. So don't miss out!"
/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,Dessi V.,"Verdun, Canada",5 star rating,"Finally, finally we managed to organize ourselves and enjoy the amazing food of Dinette Triple Crown in the Little Italy park. It is actually pretty easy and the idea is outstanding. You go in the little bar section, order your food and come to pick up your basket. They will give you a number and shout it out when the basket is filled with goodies in approximately 30 minutes on a relatively busy day. Ideally you have to attack one of the picnic tables in the park, otherwise make sure to have a blanket with you. BYOB is ok in the park, but you can buy beer in the restaurant or the near by deppaneur. Unfortunately the Dinette cocktails are available only in the dining room and you can't have them in the basket. The basket has everything about quality picnic: table cloth, plastic dishes, cutlery, water and little jars to poor your drink, which is handy if you have forgotten to bring plastic cups. The most important part of course is the food. I got lucky to taste the Dinette food more then a year ago during an Yelp event and I knew how essential is to come back. Delicious comfort food, fried chicken to die for, love the hush puppies, the corn bread, sweet potato fries, the pulled pork is amazing. The concept is so simple and succesfull, you order chicken or pulled pork with two or three sides. The list of sides is pretty good and they always have few seasonal specials. People who don't live in this city should know that Montreal has a park culture, the same way the Irish have a pub culture etc. That night at the little stage of the park we enjoyed the rhythms of the Brazilian samba and people were dancing to it. To summarize we had a typical Montreal experience: Southern American food in a park called Little Italy in the background of Brazilian music (citation NLM) and I'm so excited about it that need to share this review imeediately. Of course most of my excitement is because of the delicious food of Dinette Triple Crown."

/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"Just an update because my old review had out of date info - Dinette has now extended into the room next door which gives them a bunch more tables, and they've got there liquor license and are serving up incredibly delicious cocktails. You can and should order a picnic to go and if you do this, don't be ridiculous, please call in your order in advance. Then you can walk up like a rocker to hear them calling your name and serving up your picnic right on time and you will be the hero of dinner, which is a brief and fleeting glory but an easily attainable bit of awesome for you and your pals."

The food here is pretty good, but what makes this place out is the dining concept.  The store is a little small, but when the weather's nice outside, you can get your food to go in a picnic basket.  There's a park diagonally across the street, and so this restaurant takes advantage of that by packing their customers' orders to go in an actual picnic basket, with a blanket, mason jars filled with water, hot sauces in tiny squeeze bottles rubber-banded together, and full dining sets.  My wife heard about this place online and since we had our dog with us, we made sure to plan a trip here.  It did not disappoint.  We went for lunch and I placed the order as my wife found a spot in the park.  The picnic basket was more than I expected we would get and the food was really good too.  As far as the food, we got the meats and sides combo, with 3 pc fried chicken, a mashed potato, cucumber salad, and hush puppies.  The chicken was especially delicious and had that crispy skin.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Montreal in the summer.  The ""inside"" of the place itself has very limited seating (~4 high-top seats), so you definitely want to check this out in the summer."

/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",4 star rating,3.5 stars for me on this. Had the opportunity of sampling some of their Crispy fried chicken at an Elite event along with collard greens and hush puppies. The fried chicken was moist n crispy but as far as flavour goes it was nothing wow amazing! Collard greens were good not too salty nor over powered with butter. Hush puppies were okay just like fried cornbread.  What really topped the cake for me was the sauce offering on the table that ranged from a mustard to a spicy one to a vinegar based not that helped awaken the flavours of the chicken. You can slather as much of that stuff on till your Heart is content. The inside of the restaurant is somewhat small so they came up with the Ingenious idea to offer a picnic basket so you can take your souther food into the park. Very  clever to offer this up to give a great experience. Decor is old fashioned music is that old southern music to help support the dining experience. I thought the food was good but not knock your socks off wow! I will come back after another visit to update the review from testing other items.

The prices came out to $30 a head just for the main meal, drinks and dessert were extra. For that price we really looked forward to some authentic southern bbq.The chicken and pulled pork were just ""alright"", the mash potatoes and coleslaw was sub par. Only the biscuits and salad were above average. The drinks were pretty good but $8 each. The pecan pie was great, but lemon mirangue was the worst I ever had. Oh and they have no coffee.In conclusion this place is overhyped and overpriced. It doesn't compete with BBQ in the southern US and for $120 for 2 people we could have gorged on the best sushi in town. So don't believe the hype."

It was as fun as it sounds!So we came here on a Saturday night, grabbed our prepared basket and crossed the street. Seems like other people had the same idea but we had a nice bench to share the southern feast. We ordered a little bit of everything and the things that stood out for me what of course, the excellent chicken, the lemonade and the dessert. Everything else was solid but I'd come back just for the chicken. On a special note, I didn't like the Mac n' Cheese, it felt off but then again never been a huge fan of the dish.Price-tag is pretty expensive. Service was fine. Picnic idea is pretty awesome. :)"

Topped with delicious homemade lemonade and chili-blackberry soda, the whole thing handed to us in a cute picnic basket for casual eating in the nearby park, the experience was memorable.The place is small but charming, and allows visitors to see the staff working in the kitchen. The service was perfect and amicable, and the menu is tempting. As a vegetarian, I will admit I cannot speak for the quality of their fried chicken, the but mac n' cheese is something; fresh, chewy, cheesy. Adding to the hundred-plus existing reviews, I confirm that this place is worth visiting. My Texan husband, who sometimes misses the food from home, loves this place."

/user_details?userid=Tdp-vTDHrfR2rQk2emDKiA,Alice B.,"Brooklyn, NY",3 star rating,"Is it just me that doesn't have an undying appreciation of Dinette Triple Crown?  While their food is pretty good I just don't think their business model works all that well in the climate they're in. When you head into Dinette you order for you and who you're with. You might be waiting a while to order, though.   Having the option to have three sides of your choice is a nice option but the sides are pretty scant.  Their chicken is decent but I've had much better elsewhere, and for more reasonable prices. The food you order comes in a nice basket to eat in the park unless you're taking it to go.  There is a tiny bit of seating inside but I wouldn't recommend it. It doesn't look particularly comfortable.  This is sort of where I run into some issues -- the weather in Montreal isn't always the greatest.  What do these folks do in the off season?  The gimmick extends beyond the comfort of its patrons.TL;DR? Make sure the weather is nice before you wait in the line up."

/user_details?userid=EaBKe-8LB-NHuH7Us-QhGw,Vincent V.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"things fried in oil can never be bad, but this place is pretty amazing. Me and my friends ordered 20 pieces of fried chicken, with a large mac and cheese, biscuits, green beans, cornbread and, fried sweet potatoes. The Mac and cheese was quite cheesy, and had a good blend of cheese. It had an amazing umami flavour, and had an interesting profile, a delicious stink. The biscuit was crumbly, buttery goodness. The cornbread had a delicious crisp, and was packed with flavour. The fried potatoes was crunchy on the outside, soft and pack with sweetness in the inside. It was topped with a gravy.The fried chicken was crispy, packed with flavor, and moist on the inside. Brown meat is always better than brown meat, albeit the white meat was also delicious. The gravy was a bit on the warmer side of things, but it was tasty nonetheless. Good delivery vehicle for cornbread and the biscuit.Shoutout to the peach-Habanero hot sauce, best homemade hot sauce I've had in a while. It is quite spicy tho.Beer's selection is short but great. They have a great cocktail selection too. I ordered a Beau's and my dining companions a bunch of Farnham's, both Canadian microbreweries."

Each spoonful has cheese that hangs for a meter in length before it detaches from the rest of the Mac and Cheese. This is some seriously gooey fresh cheese! And their sides are also delicious and so is their brisket. Not only that the rum and coke was actually really well done too! The whole place is excellent and feels like you are eating a home cooked meal. Get in maaaa belly!"

I grew up in the south, and this soul food is 100% legit - truly some of the best I've ever had. I'd list off the highlights, but I wouldn't even know where to begin because everything was amazing. I ordered the 3 pc fried chicken (because I knew my bf would want a piece), which comes with 3 sides - I got collard greens, creamy cole slaw, and mashed potatoes w/ gravy. The hot sauce collection is on point. My cousin let me try a bite of her mac & cheese, and my bf let me try a bite of his brisket...all of it was pure heaven. Bloody Caesars are good and spicy, too. We stayed at an Airbnb about a block away, and I don't know how our hosts stay so skinny with this place so close. I'll be dreaming of Dinette for a long time!"
/user_details?userid=JwWYSaemJJR1-Sba-a8_7A,Miles C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been coming here several years, and just want to say that DTC knows what they're doing! They make delicious comfort food that in my opinion is the best Southern american style food Montreal has yet dared to emulate (there are many 'BBQ' places cropping up, but many aren't all that great), and they do such a good job and it sort of belongs in its own category of comfort food. Their pulled pork and brisket is ace, tender, well seasoned and not too sweet, and their chicken and side choices are all very good too. I like that you can order a reasonably healthy meal here or go the full hog and end up in a totally worthwhile food coma. Desserts are also delicious and homemade, and not just an afterthought. All of this to say that I haven't had such delicious southern food outside of the south, so I would definitely recommend this place, especially for a chilly evening indoors or nice afternoon picnic when you can take out and eat next door at the park."

It was perfectly hot and stayed hot throughout my first couple of pieces. Also you get a lot of chicken...10 pieces for $25.00. The gravy is good too, and I enjoyed the cole slaw.The service is extremely friendly. We ate at the second, take-out counter location they have just past the first full sized restaurant on the corner. It's a more casual dining environment.They have a good beer and bourbon selection as well. We also shared a piece of green tomato pie which tasted like apple pie. Recommended."
/user_details?userid=wio2PT99Eth_4Kf0MynIDw,Aron G.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I didn't understand what comfort food meant until I ate here on a cold winter's eve around closing time.  If you eat here, prepare to require assistance to walk out the door again.  You may need to be wheeled out.The Triple Crown Dinette formerly consisted of a kitchen and a small antechamber with a few swivel seats and a wraparound counter.  Thankfully they've expanded into a larger dining room, however the two are only connected by the kitchen. While staff can flit between the curtains, regular patrons must exit the front door and reenter through another door.I ordered the small Mac and Cheese, with deep fried sweet potatoes and ancho pepper mayo, and a buttermilk biscuit.  Of course, I also had the strawberry milkshake :D.I've had several Mac and Cheese dishes in my lifetime, and this is undoubtedly the best one.  Sorry to my friends at Kraft, Le Cheese, Fortune, Deville, and EVOO, but the richness of flavour here is unbeatable.  The noodles are cooked just right, the creamy sauce is tasty, not just generically creamy, not too fatty.  The cheese on top is baked to just the right degree, not burnt to a crisp, leaving a beautiful caramel brown colour in just the right places (thank you to the Maillard reaction!).  This is no one-trick pony either, I've been back on a few other occasions, and they've consistently impressed me with this dish.Those who know me know I don't like potatoes, but I love sweet potatoes, so when I heard ""deep-fried sweet po..."" I don't think I even let the server finish the sentence before shouting ""Yes!"".  Ancho mayo was a new one for me, though, so I looked it up.  ""Ancho"" is another name for the Poblano pepper, a mild chili pepper from Puebla, Mexico.  The sweet potatoes were delicious on their own, but the mayo's spiciness provided a nice balance to the sweetness.I've never had a buttermilk biscuit before either, and I was in for a treat!  The outside was slightly crunchy, the texture reminiscent of a fresh scone, and the inside was a wonderful blend of salty-sour butter and milk flavour.  I was barely able to finish the biscuit, I had to take half of the rest to go, except for the fact that I couldn't move for a good 10 minutes.The only negative is that the strawberry milkshake was uninspiring, perhaps my expectations were too high given the level of the salted caramel variant here.I probably spent 20 minutes trying to finish the meal (and failing), and another 20 minutes endeavouring to move again.  It was worth it!"

Having recently been in the US, my companions had their fill of biscuits and fried chicken and were hungry for more, but it's not a popular cuisine in Montreal.A quick Yelp search brought me to Triple Crown. We were not disappointed. Awesome service, great ambiance. Small dining room, tasty margaritas.The menu was simple, pick your meat, pick your sides. Generous portions. The chicken was crispy and delish. The mash creamy, the mac and cheese cheesy, gravy thick, and the biscuits... oh the biscuits. ""A cat's head"" she told us, in response to the ""how big are they"" question. The chef, an expert, makes hundreds and hundreds a week, by hand. Buttery to the smell and to the taste. So good one of my group put one in her purse to take home. Will definitely be visiting again!"

What a great idea!During summer time, you can order your food to go in a picnic basket and eat in the park across the street. The basket is complete with picnic table cloth, sauces, mason jar water cups and utensils. Just return everything to the restaurant when you're finished. My personal favorite is the brisket. But their fried chicken and pulled pork are amazing as well! The cider goes great with southern comfort food. :)"

/user_details?userid=LPDOx50zUR-rEovzOhADbA,Rachel C.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,"After my third visit to Dinette Triple Crown, I can say with confidence that the food has gotten worse every time I've visited. I got the three piece chicken meal with hushpuppies and macaroni and cheese. The chicken breasts were extremely small, the hushpuppies (perhaps the best item on the menu) have gotten SIGNIFICANTLY smaller since the first time I visited in 2016. The worst item I received hands down was the macaroni and cheese - its funky aftertaste and soupy consistency may appeal to some, but does not qualify in my books as proper mac 'n' cheese. I did have a taste of my partner's brussels sprouts (a special that day), and they were EXCELLENT. I also found the pricing to be on the more expensive side. The decor of the restaurant was homey if not a bit plantation-y. I noticed with bemusement that most of the female staff were clad in colonial attire - long skirts with braided hair. I don't know if this was intentional but it came across as stereotypical at best and insensitive at worst. In addition, the restaurant featured period-style family photos of white familes, ignoring the African American roots of soul food. Overall, the food was mediocre and overpriced. That being said, Montreal does not have a lot of soul food options, so if you are desperate for some, this is the place to go. The best of a limited lot."
/user_details?userid=aUhcscNphAJQlZe1R_WRow,Vincci L.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"For some comfort southern food, I made the trek to Dinette Triple Crown for a satisfying dinner. The place is an old school diner, with around 10 bar stools that look onto the quiet street outside. There's black and white images of horses, perhaps a homage to their name. On a chilly night, this was a warm haven. The menu had fried chicken, pulled pork, brisket, and lots of sides. Of course, I wanted everything. Sometimes though, what one wants and what the reality should be are quite different. So I settled on a 2 piece fried chicken plate, which gives me the options of 3 sides.After some anticipation, my plate arrived. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside, without being overly oily, and the meat, although a bit dry, had lots of flavour. Now, the sides. It came with possibly one of the best biscuits I've ever had. Flaky and buttery, and warm. The other sides- a choice of vinegar or creamy coleslaw (I chose the vinegar), and sweet potatoes. The coleslaw was light, and the sweet potatoes were oven roasted to perfection. As I savoured this delicious meal, I also got a sparkling lemonade to complement my meal. It wasn't overly sweet, and just a right amount of fizz. Surely, I had to end my meal with a southern dessert. A pecan sugar pie with fresh whipped cream? I was sold. The pie crust was flaky and crispy, and it was filled with pecans.There were lots of take out orders while I was there, and they also have a full dining room right next door. In the summer, this would make the perfect picnic to enjoy in the little pack across the street!"

Meat and threes with any of their side dishes is just delicious. Standouts are the hush puppies, buttermilk biscuits, Mac and cheese. The mains are all good but my favorite is the fried chicken.

/user_details?userid=O9rbVxtEnxnjKIdeuBjPOw,Jenny G.,"Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Canada",2 star rating,"So this place has gotten rave reviews on Yelp and I've heard about it here and there. I was excited to try it because being from the south I love to try any southern resto in my area. We walk in and see a tiny counter top, we are informed that we can walk outside and into the dining room. So we decide on that. The menu is a simple piece of paper with their limited options. They have smoked brisket, pulled pork, or fried chicken and a plethora of sides.This is what we ordered: brisket with hush puppies and Mac n cheese. 3 piece fried chicken with pinto beans and bacon, mashed potatoes and gravy, and cornbread.At first glance I can tell you a few things about the brisket. What I can tell you is that it isn't smoked and it doesn't taste good. Brisket when smoked should have a nice brown color with a dark outer bark. This looks like steamed flesh. Guess what? It's dry and very lack luster. I decide to add some of their homemade sauces to spice it up. Their vinegar based sauce is basically just vinegar and it wasn't good. The ketchup based was just that. Ketchup. The Mac and cheese was delicious, warm, and creamy for the first few bites. Once we got deeper into the mac and got to the sauce it got kind of disgusting. Have you ever eaten anything that you hate more and more with each bite? It left a sour after taste in my mouth. I've never had this happen before with food. The hush puppies were unremarkable at best. I didn't like or hate them.The fried chicken had a nice spice coat. The skin was very good because that is where all the flavor lived. Once we got past the skin the chicken was dry. Thank God for the gravy because that was amazing! The pinto beans were good, the mashed potatoes were amazing (again, that gravy!), and the corn bread was bad, like really bad. One side was cooked well and the bottom side was practically raw. What impressed me? I loved their sparkling homemade lemonade. I liked how knowledgable their wait staff was on the menu and the sauces. I also really loved their ""Derby Pie"" which is made with chocolate chips, bourbon, and walnuts. It was so sweet I hated myself for eating it. What didn't impress me: in general their food. The fact that after eating I had to walk out of the dining room, outside to the street, and come back in the ""counter top"" part to pay.I might try again in the summer with their picnic baskets but right now I'm still wondering how they have 119 positive reviews when I was less than not even impressed."

During summer, you can get your food to go in a picnic basket and eat it in the park across the street and the basket, let me tell you, is absolutely adorable. It comes with a tablecloth, mason jars for water, napkins, squeeze bottles full of their homemade sauces (their BBQ sauce is out of this world, the richest BBQ sauce i've ever had). We had two of the one meat three sides and therefore tried the fried chicken and the brisket as well as the greens, the hush puppies (they were my favourite, so flavourful and crispy), the mashed potato with gravy (so rich), the baked sweet potatoes, the corn bread and the biscuit (so flaky). We both preferred the fried chicken over the brisket, although that may be more due to personal preferences. The chicken was so crisp and very well seasoned with a nice pepper/paprika (i think) kick. We must have eaten well over 1000 calories each but it was definitely worth it!"

I am as shamelessly hopeful as they come. And though I am seriously working on jading up, I don't think I was the only one in the mid-day line-up for a picnic-basket-lunch feeling the power and camaraderie of Friday, of sun, of tree greenery spring, of warmth, and satiating healthy appetites with good food, drink, and lovingly crafted Bourbon!  It started with me not writing down the exact address for the Eastern Bloc on Clark, not easily spotting it while in the vicinity, realizing I was really hungry, winding up locking the bike aside the Parc du la Petite Italie, wholly focused on the quest for the 'right' nourishments, spotting several picnickers with baskets of food and drink on red & white checkered table cloths, asking about, then being pointed toward, the source. And discreet it is. No indication, outwardly, that something really special is going on. Until you get closer. No signage on the building nor in the window. But the height-of-lunch lineup and the buzz in DTC's small lunch takeout kitchen-side section was furious for the next 30 mins(?).By the time I'd gotten to the counter, ordered, waited outside. waited inside, chatted with Nicole about the circa 1970's race horse photos (spent many a summers eve and weekend at Assiniboin Downs in the late 60's), about Victoria BC, MTL transplanting, and my chicken was cooked, (whew...still with me, it was a good wait! =D) the lunch frenzy had subsided and I had to get back to work. So I didn't eat in the park, and took my brown bagged (fried spicy chicken, roasted sweet potato, with a very interesting side of sauce) lunch home. Half way through our conversation I learn Nicole is an owner of this biz. Jeez, she had the biggest smile the whole while she was co working it!  This is a sincere labour of big big love. So beautiful. Lunch was excellent. I will go back. Plan the time. This is not fast food fare. Next time I will include both park time, and a beautiful bourbon elixir, or two. And, perhaps, a friend. Pretty special. Do the DTC park picnic lunch in Little Italy thing and let yourself -eyes wide open- have this extraordinary robust moment of Montreal romance. =DCheers,Tammy M"

I love southern food and have been trying to find places here that serve it as good as I've had from Florida. This place does come close, but it still doesn't compare to what I've had in the states. So to start, the fried sweet potatoes were pretty bad... soggy and oily as hell. I couldnt even finish them. The mac and cheese and corn bread were fine, not anything to write home about. However, the fried chicken and biscuits were incredible! The pieces of chicken were on the smaller size however which was a bummer cause I wanted more! I would definitley go back just for the chicken and biscuits, thats about it though. Very expensive for the portion size as well."

It was the best southern food I ever had.The place a bit hard to find because the sign is small and the front of the restaurant does not scream restaurant but it is worth the trouble I swear. The second I walked in I wanted to try everything they had. I was not too sure how the menu worked but the waitress explained everything to us. She was amazingly friendly and super helpful.It was windy so didn't pick the picnic basket option so to walked one door down to sit in their new dinning room. They have fried chicken and pork and tonnes of amazing and tasty side. I had the chicken but I will be going soon to try the pork. The chicken was moist but I would of like it to have a little bit more flavor but turned out ok with the homestyle gravy and the different hot sauce on the table.For the sides we tried the hush puppies and they are to die for. The deep fried sweet potatoes are a must try, the mac & cheese was the best so warm and tasty the only thing I was not crazy about was greens it was a bit watery. They have a few fresh dessert of the day so never the same thing. That day they had an amazing blueberry pie with i cream and I had a chocolate pecan pie with bourbon whip cream and it was divine but extremely sweet.They also have so many drinks with or without alcohol and to be able to try everything you need to go many times so for sure I will be going back."

I've had just about every single combination possible and tasted every main meat dish and side dish.My solid go to is the Brisket + hush puppies + Sweet potatoes + biscuit (although if I had a god damn spine and didn't care about being judged I would go 3x hush puppies, YES THEY ARE THAT GOOD)The Big Nasty is also dear to my heart (but not my arteries) couple it with some hush puppies and you're golden.Lastly, pay attention to the specials, if the meat loaf is available, DO NOT HESITATE AND TAKE IT!"
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Despite my disdain for the South's more ""yikes""-ish tendencies when it comes to basic socioeconomic issues (especially in light of recent events), the region's food always makes me able to at least halfway forgive them for a finite period of time (and that says a lot). Unlike most white American traditional home cooking, which I find to be quite bland for my tastes more often than not, Southern food delivers up some stick-to-your-ribs comfort that will always leave you longing for more. Given Montréal's track record of not being the best in American joies-de-vivre such as pizza, macaroni and cheese, barbecue, and bagels (fight me on this one); I was quite surprised and hopeful in stumbling upon this place. I'm pleased to say it wildly exceeded my expectations.Immediately after walking in, I was surrounded by a cozy and rustic interior that made me feel warm and fuzzy on the inside, especially coupled with the friendly and inviting waiters. After deciding to sit at the bar, I ordered a meat and three with pulled pork, mac and cheese (you can sub mac and cheese for two sides), and candied yams. I can honestly say that it was one of the most food-gasmic meals I've ever had. The pulled pork was fall-apart-in-your-mouth tender and a far cry from most of my experiences with Westerners cooking pork in a rather dry manner; plus it went well with the (actually decently spicy!) peach chile-something spicy sauce that I drizzled on every bite. It brought a somewhat tart and slightly citrus-y dimension to the meat. The candied yams could have been delightful just on their own as I am a huge fan of sweet potatoes, but the sweet sauce that carries notes of brown sugar made sweet and savory a dream made in heaven. And the mac and cheese was the most cheesy, naughty, and melty dish that I've had in a long time, with the pasta cooked to a perfect al dente. It harbored a mix of different cheeses including cheddar and bleu, if I'm correct, and the breadcrumb crust on top that signalled the fact that it was baked sealed the deal for me. Although I was full by the time I was done, I couldn't resist trying one of their desserts because of how well Southerners make them. The creamy Atlantic Beach Pie was on the menu for the day, and according to NPR, it originated on the North Carolina coast. Made with a combination of lemon and lime flavors with a sweet and salty crust and a whipped cream topping, it further justified my affinity for fruit-based desserts and how I could eat them for eternity. Overall, the entire meal was luscious but unpretentious, and I would 10/10 recommend this place to anyone who wants homey comfort food or even for a cozy date night. I can't wait to come back and try some of their drinks and especially their famous fried chicken to see how it stacks up against my favorite international variant (Korean)!"

My friend had the Big Nasty and loved it. I had the brisket. It was moist and tasty. The sides were fresh and original. Hush puppies were crunchy. The sweet potato fries had a great gravy. We also had the slaw and the bean salad. Everything was good, the chicken was awesome. The only hitch are the limited hours during week days and a little pricey. We'll go back for the mac n cheese."

I scored at Dinette Triple Crown. The service is above level but still down to earth. The macaroni and cheese was a bit more 'tart' tasting than what I'm used to but a nice surprise. I won't be trading my traditional recipe though. The chicken was flavorful but was upstaged by the homemade sauces (go for the peach habanero) for that much needed kick. In fact, it was the small things like the lemonade which makes this place a must. The hot water cornbread was ambitious and didn't miss the mark. I agree with other reviewers, the price for our lunch for 2 adults and 2 kids was crazy but I hear the area is very expensive, so you gotta pay rent ‍"

The reviews looked great and even my boyfriend recommended Dinette Triple Crown. I did find their food delicious but the entire combo might have been too salty for my taste. The Macaroni tasted perfect but I would recommend not taking it with Hushpuppies. The fried chicken itself was mice but I wish they were crispier. I had better fried chicken in Montreal (re: Prohibition at NDG). I was not satisified with staff service as well, for some reason but maybe they were just having a bad day. Perhaps, I'll have to revisit again to sew if my experience is any different."

(When I'm visiting from the States) But oh man i was wrong. This place is the bomb. I can't be completely sure how authentic this is, but damn, it's delicious. So this place is a bit small. It can only hold like maybe 6-10 people sitting inside the actual restaurant. BUT you have an option for a picnic! Which I did read about on other yelps or have imagined it would be an actual picnic. Since there weren't many open seats for a group of four, we did a picnic. Dinette Triple Crown gives you the picnic basket, the blanket, utensils, mason jars for cups, water, napkins, sanitary wipes, etc. All the things you need for a picnic at the park that is across the street from the restaurant. (Oh and you have the option to take out as well if you're a local)So I had no idea that they actual did that! I was super surprised. The ladies at the counter are super nice and down to earth. They answered our questions and was really accommodating when we didn't want a picnic cause we thought it was gonna rain, but we did the picnic anyway because they had the basket ready. The lady said it was really nice to have a picnic under the gazebo at the park. And that's exactly what we did. It was so nice! Now for the actual food, it is delicious~! I had some mac & cheese with a side of fried sweet potatoes. This mac & cheese is definitely different than the norm. You can real taste the cheese because it was slightly bitter or tangy? I'm not sure, but it was different. It was also pretty heavy. I love sweet potatoes and it came with sauce. It tasted so good! I had a piece of my friend's chicken, and it was juicy and moist in the inside. When I thought fried chicken, I thought they bread it and deep fried the chicken. That was not the case. I'm not sure what they did but it goes well the sauces they gave us. It may be a little expensive but it is portion is right for the price. They also had some alcoholic drinks that I look good too. I see some reviews about the wait time, we came off peak (in the summer), so we didn't wait too long. Maybe 30 minutes. It wasn't too bad. I would love to come back and try something else!! Get the chicken! You won't regret it! :)"

Perhaps the people who rave about this place have never had southern style food before and are simply experiencing something new. For anyone who is already accustomed to this type of food, the food just doesn't stack up to what true southern comfort food should be.

Luckily today, I had the chance to go. At first, my friend and I couldn't find the place for there was no sign outside. We walked right by it. When I walked in I wasn't expecting the place to be so small. However, this made me happy. It gave it a real intimate feel. The place's decor has a 1960's diner vibe, really cool. The menus are made out of printer paper and cut out by hand. I loved it, it was simple and added authenticity to the place, along with the pickled goods and family photos on the wall. Malt shop music played in the background. It gave me such a cozy nostalgic feeling. This place is a hole in the wall and I wouldn't want it any other way. It's just a simple diner where you could grab exceptional food at a low price.Our waitress was great and very knowledgeable regarding the menu. She explained everything in great detail, including all the sauces we had on our table; and gave us recommendations. It wasn't long before she served us their signature homemade iced tea, which was terrific.The food is without a doubt, extraordinary. They serve original southern dishes and create flavour combinations that you will not find anywhere else in Montreal. My friend and I were getting full but were determined to finish everything on our plate, for we didn't want to waste such delicious food.I can't wait to return and bring my boyfriend to this restaurant.

(The only place I've possibly had better was down in North Carolina where they used Corn Flakes crumbs and deep fried the chicken in pure butter!). But it's not *just* fried chicken. The sides are amazing as well, the gravy, the mashed potatoes, roasted sweet potatoes, hushpuppies, mac'n cheese, braised Collard greens - all of it is stellar - then there are the daily specials which change all the time. Desserts change all the time as well. Today it was Lemon Meringue Pie and Bread Pudding with Bourbon sauce to give you an idea.You will have no choice but to arrange to make multiple trips here so that you can eventually eat your way through the menu and that's saying something!It's a tiny space, with only 8 sitting spots, they do most of their business with take-out and particularly during the summer months when picnic baskets are arranged and everyone eats at the park. From what I understand, they will be expanding soon and will also have a proper sit-down restaurant which serves the same awesome food.Triple Crown Dinette people: Seriously, just expand all over the city already and put KFC out of business.  Come to Verdun, cheap rents abound and then there's the park beside the riverside as well!"

What is especially unique about this place, though, is that these guys strive to use locally-available ingredients to creatively reinvent Southern-style food in a way that still feels authentic. For instance, in all my Southern dealings, I've never encountered a pumpkin-seed-based hot sauce, but the Triple Crown's in-house recipe has got the right combination of flavor and kick. Basically, they just nailed it."

That pretty much sums up the DTC experience.The restaurant is barely visible from the street. You could miss it even walking by slowly. The place is tiny. It can't sit more than 8 or 9 people and sometimes you have to eat standing up. But there are plans to expand in the empty store next door. The lack of seating is the only ""negative"" to the Dinette Triple Crown. And compared to the rest of the experience, it doesn't even make a blip on the radar.DTC serves up Southern Comfort Food on EPIC AWESOMNESS level never before registered. Our metric EPIC AWESOMNESS gathering instruments overloaded and exploded in a huge foodgasmic mushroom cloud...DTC is owned by a couple, one being a Canadian girl from BC (who speaks excellent French by the way) an her husband, a God-Like Chef from the Great State of Kentucky - and yes he even has the twirley 'stash.Where to start? Seriously! Eating at DTC is like waking up next to 10 naked ladies and you have an hour left to live...that's the kind of pressure you're facing when looking at the menu. Let's start with what brought me to DTC. Fried Chicken. Since travelling to the southern states in the US and partaking of Brown Paper Bag Fried Chicken, I've been chasing the fried chicken dragon for years. The chase is over. This is without a doubt the best fried chicken I've ever had...EVER. They have 5 or 6 different sauces on the counters for their delicious grub, but this chicken needs nothing. It's juicy, piping hot and I dunno what kind of magic he puts in the dredge, but the crispy fried skin is a gustatory explosion of flavour.But wait, that's not all... they have this pulled-pork sammich which defies reason. Some of the best pulled pork I've ever had, served on one of their homemade buns - yes they make ALL their own breads, including biscuits but more on that later - served with cheese and some crazy delicious creamy slaw. I'm at a loss for words. They have an equally impressive brisket sammich. Each meat can be served with sides, the classic southern Meat & Threes. Hushpuppies - deep-fried corn bread - topped with ranch sauce can be eaten by the bucket full. Smoked and roasted sweet potatoes will ruin every other sweet potato side dish experience you've ever had. Even the mash is crazy insane. It's probably half potato, half butter top with their maddening gravy. They also have other southern sides like kale, black-eyed peas, and of course cornbread.  Then there's something that shouldn't be talked about out loud, their total hit-it-out-of-the-park batshit crazy take on Mac n' Cheese. You've never had Mac n' Cheese until you've had THIS Mac n' Cheese. Sharp cheeses melted into a creamy goodness, baked with more cheese and should probably be registered as some sort of weapon. And they always have specials for both starters and entrées, the most memorable being Buffalo Pig Tails. Yup, pig tails, deep fried and served like Buffalo Chicken Wings... I'll give you a moment to wrap your mind around that one. But trust me they were beyond any expectations you might have.Their attention to the little things is masterful. Sure you can get some cola with your grub but why would you, when you can get made-to-order lemonade - from freshly squeezed lemons and limes. They also have a great selection of Kentucky bourbons. Making things even better, there's a park across the street and they've capitalized on this by offering you a picnic basket with a picnic blanket and all the goodies you need to have your picnic in the park with their mindblowing grub.Wait there's also deserts... not just any deserts. Deserts you want... well I had a lot of sexual innuendo in mind but you get the idea right? They don't make apple pie, they make deep fried apple dumplings topped with bourbon caramel and fresh whipped cream. They don't have strawberry shortcakes, they have Cranberry & Biscuit topped with again bourbon caramel and whipped cream. They desert biscuits are sweeter the regular biscuit and make any desert they make sublime... you could eat pounds of them biscuit. They have classics like chess pie, pecan pie, coconut pie and other concoctions of Level 80 Wizarsds. You cannot resist eating their deserts. You just hear what they prepared; you know you will break like a 40 year sober alcoholic when offered a glass of 16 year old single malt Islay Scotch.Whatever you do, don't go there without a wolf's appetite. You're gonna eat till you guts burst and you'll want to go on. The greatest southern food experience you'll have in Montreal and pretty much anywhere else. Not to forget the extremely welcoming demeanour of the owners and the staff. Great food, booze and atmosphere. I can't say it enough, just go there and eat. Everyone I bring there is turned into a total addict before they're done chewing on their first bite."

Especially given the lovely parks that montreal has during summer. This time we ate at the actual restaurant which was nice and rustic feeling. I found that the food was good, very clean, very good quality seeming ingredients, the fried chicken was tasty and not greasy at all- I didn't feel the way I do after eating KFC (even though I like the taste of KFC more flavour-wise) but this chicken was something that you could imagine being served in a country BnB.. I did find that the food was a bit dry, however we went in a huge group (20 people) and I would bet that it was likely only slightly dry because of the wait/prep time for handing the huge group. I would definitely be down for trying out one of their adorable picnic basket lunches to take to a park one day."

While not the best I've ever had, it was still up there. I got the three piece fried chicken, which comes with a choice of three sides. I got the mac and cheese, which counts as two, and mashed potatoes. Mashed potatoes were very good! So buttery. Mac and cheese was different! Not your typical blander type of dish. It had a nice blend of spices. And the fried chicken was delish as well. I usually like a crispier crunchier batter, whereas this was more of a thinner batter, but it was still delicious. I got extra gravy to put on top. Yum! I will admit I loved my boy friend's pulled pork even more than the chicken, and his coleslaw was amazing! So next time I'd probably opt for the coleslaw over the mashed potatoes, and the pulled pork over the chicken. Otherwise, this meal was amazing, and I definitely recommend! Wear some stretchy pants"

I went twice, and had to get the ""Le Big Nasty"" both times.  I'll let you find out about that yourself, I'll just say that I'm ordering it when I'm there again next month.I have to say that I've never had bad food in Montreal, but this adds such a hip twist to a dining experience as well! super fun.  While you're eating, take a look around the park while you sip and eat and take in the happy hipsters and buskers around you."

We were very disappointed; Everything looks better than it actually tastes. They definitely tried to make it their own by adding their own twist, but on this day, they failed. The chicken tasted plain and was full of nerves. They mentioned making their own lemonade, onsite, yet they went and ruined it by adding carbonation, which they don't mention. Natural lemonade sure sounded great, too. Bummer. The service was on point and the atmosphere was authentic enough. The prices were reasonable. And of course, we understand that every restaurant has their off days, however, in order to be honest we have to rate it on the one visit we prepared to give it, and this is it. We won't be coming back to try it again. Maybe you'll have better luck, but I would recommend avoiding unless you're really in the mood for so so chicken, good service, and a letdown on all other fronts."

Not clumpy enough and not smooth enough, the gravy served with it was also bland, needs a lot more seasoning. The hush puppies came in 6, but that was 6 balls of meh. It was not good.

The salt was ok but it didn't taste anything other than that. I'd suggest adding more spices in the batter.Hushpuppies well... it's fried cornbread. But that would have been fine if they didn't add sour cream all over them. That tasted grease over grease.Same with fried sweet potatoes, the sauce was overwhelmingly greasy and tasteless in general.The pinto beans... tasted the best in my meal., but nothing out of this world.I'm still rating this a 3 star though, mainly because it's one of the only places in Montreal that serves southern comfort food."

My partner and I decided to see what Canadian soul food was like and what a pleasure it was discovering this place. We arrived and was greeted by an employee behind the counter who asked if we wanted to dine in or take out. Wanting to dine in she told us that there would be a short wait, she offered for us to hangout in the takeout area (which was pretty crowded) or to leave a number and they would call when the table was available, we went with the latter. Less then ten minutes later we got a call telling us the table was ready. The ambiance was warm, there are wooden tables for family style dining and bronze light fixtures which give the room a rustic country feel. The service was amazing! Every single employee we had the pleasure of interacting with was so pleasant and extremely knowledgeable about the menu giving great descriptions of the food. My partner and I both went with the three piece chicken meal with macaroni and cheese, hush puppies, fried sweet potatoes, braised greens and mashed potatoes and gravy. It was all so good. Definitely recommend trying the Mac and cheese, the noodles were cooked to perfection, the perfect amount of firmness and the cheese blend was on point. There are several sauces on the table, the original bbq sauce was great and the hot sauce with the yellow top was great as well. I had the Kentucky mule to drink; you must try this! It was very tasty. I had the bread pudding with salted vanilla ice cream for dessert, delicious! Over all a great experience all the way around. Highly recommend.

We were four, so we tried several dishes: The chicken, the pulled pork, and the mac and cheese. The chicken was already cold and hard when I opened the basket (3 minutes after receiving the basket). At 14$ (+tax +tip) the Mac and Cheese contained some really cheap cheese that I found didn't smell right. The pulled pork was just fine.Now, maybe this is all just one instance of bad experience and/or maybe I don't like the southern food.

Let me not forget to mention the bacon/caramel milkshake...I was really skeptical about what it would taste like but as soon as that liquid candy touched my lips I was a believer.  The two little things were it was really cramped (not a big issue just make sure you call in advance or just take your food to go) and the cornbread was a little on the white said (lacked that distinctive yellow color).

/user_details?userid=wazWs5WpW2lSzvYkkmP9yA,Rebecca C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Mmm-mm! Southern comfort food and soul food!I'm gonna start off with a pretty unpopular opinion: the fried chicken here isn't that great. I find it over-spiced and not that crispy, and the gravy does nothing for me, either. So while I love fried chicken and I certainly wouldn't turn this stuff down if it was offered, it's not what I'll spend money on here.The quality of the rest of the food, however, more than makes up for it. The mac & cheese changed my life (a ""large"" serving is pretty large, too). The collard greens made me think I'd died and gone to heaven. The cornbread brought tears to my eyes and the hushpuppies (and the sauce they're served in) were positively orgasmic. The desserts and cocktails are amazing. Next on my ""to-try"" list is the pulled pork.The size of the ""dining room"" is both a big pro and a big con at Triple Crown. There's only seating for about 3.5 people inside, and this space disappears when it gets crowded, which is every nice evening in the summer. Triple Crown offers an amazing take-away package of a wicker picnic basket, cutlery, checked table cloth, sauces, and your drinks sealed up in mason jars so that you can take it all to the lovely little park across the street, which is as awesome as it is picturesque in nice weather. However, there is a finite supply of these and if you come after 7pm on a nice summer's eve, you will not only be waiting in line for a long time, you will be forced to take your meal to-go, sans picnic basket or sauces. That being said, the line is probably worth it and you can always order for delivery."

This was a seriously thick shake, even on the 35c day I had it. It's actually a salted caramel shake, which is awesome. Get it.Secondly, The Big Nasty: This bad boy is a fried chicken sandwich on home-made bread, covered in gravy. I don't know how they did it, but they managed to make gravy-covered chicken still be crispy - that defies food physics! The fried chicken from this place is amazing (just check all the other reviews for confirmation).I didn't get a chance to try anything from their impressive boozy drinks menu (I ain't even mad - try the salted caramel milkshake and you'll understand why), but I will be going back to do so.There isn't much space in the place itself (it's little more than a counter and a couple of chairs), but they offer to give you a picnic basket to take to the park across the road (with cutlery, etc) which is really cool."
/user_details?userid=RKuxL3EHWkiEDeQo8Qcvbg,April L.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,I'll recommend this place to anyone who's in town. Really good Southern comfort food. the Fried Chicken is good and they provide 5+ different sauces (made from scratch in their kitchen). The BBQ mustard sauce is my favourite. it's not in the middle of a busy tourist area so it's nice to see a different area of town.

Although they were super friendly and nice it's not very kid friendly since the seating is tall swivel chairs at a counter. But my kids love this place and fought over the last piece of fried chicken as well as the mashed potato and sweet potatoes. They liked the hush puppies too but loved the the other too. The fries chicken was perfectly fries so tender and well spiced without being greasy! Hubby got the pulled pork which he refused to share it was so good.

The decor definitely puts you in a southern mood. The employees are so wonderful. A crowd started to gather after we placed our order and I watched them manage taking orders, making drinks, and getting orders out the order in a calm fashion. We didn't wait long for our food, but I would have been okay with a bit of a longer wait as everything is freshly prepared and is very delicious. My family comes from Georgia so I grew up eating soul food. This was such a wonderful interpretation of southern cuisine. So much attention to flavor and quality. I had the 2 piece fried chicken meal with braised greens mac and cheese, and a side of gravy. The chicken was cooked perfectly. Crispy and not greasy. The greens were seasoned well and the mac and cheese was such a treat. My nephew ordered the Big Nasty. Fried chicken on a biscuit served in a pool of gravy. Yum! My brother got the catfish special which came with vegetables and was served in a broth. Such a unique way of serving catfish and the combination was really tasty. They offer picnic baskets you can take the park which is such a clever idea. We got there around 1:00 right before a line started forming to order. People waited patiently for about 30 minutes just to order which shows their dedication in wanting to eat there. I plan on returning many times in the future and highly recommend this place."

I had a sip of my friend's ginger beer and it's mind-blowing. The menu is on the pricier side, but the portions are VERY generous, and more often than not it's more than enough food for one meal. I usually go for the classic Meats-and-3's, which means you get to choose 3 sides, on top of your choice of meat (fried chicken, pulled pork, beef brisket,etc.). I've only tried the fried chicken, and while it's decent it tends to be on the drier side, not so juicy. Definitely not the best fried chicken I've had. I can't complain about the mashed potatoes and the gravy though - it's so deliciously creamy and buttery! Same for the biscuits. The creamy slaw, hushpuppies, red beans and rice are also some great choices for the sides. My only gripe is that if you live downtown, this place is a bit far out and hard to reach by walk. The location and price is definitely what's stopping me from visiting more often. Other than that, it's a great place to bring a big group of friends and families."

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"On my regular Saturday bike ride to and from Jean Talon Market, I occasionally use the opportunity to stop and try some desired location located on my route through Mile End and Little Italy. Last week, I was in the mood for some BBQ so I headed off to a pretty new addition to the scene in Little Italy, Dinette Triple Crown.As a fan of BBQ, I was instantly intrigued and boy... was I not disappointed. The restaurant is in a small space at the corner of St-Zotique and Clark across from Martel park. There is a small counter area to sit inside but the place is really set up to pick up and enjoy elsewhere. In fact, they offer an option to provide a picnic basket filled with your order to bring across the street to enjoy outside. Had I not been alone, the option would have been a perfect one but inside was just as enjoyable. The restaurant has a cool look with amazing music playing throughout. Any place that plays jazz, crooner and soul music the whole time is a winner in my books!The menu options run the gamut of classic southern style food: brisket, fried chicken, pulled pork, biscuits, sweet potato, greens, etc... I went for a large wide swatch of their options for my lunch: Pulled pork sandwich, one piece of fried chicken, a buttermilk biscuit, sweet potatoes and a lemonade. There wasn't a single bad option on this plate. The sweet potatoes were perfectly cooked with a nice crisp exterior without the interior becoming complete mush. The biscuit was a perfect combination of rich, soft, flaky goodness. It was the kind of thing where you can just tell that lots of butter and buttermilk was used in its making but you don't care in the least. The fried chicken was simply perfect - the skin was crispy, seasoned perfectly and not overbearing. The chicken was probably the moistest I've ever experienced with fried chicken. That classic feeling of needing to drink loads of water to offset the dryness of fried chicken was nowhere to be found. The chicken definitely deserved to be enjoyed in a larger quantity but that had to wait because I needed to try the pulled pork.When I want to judge a BBQ place, the pulled pork or the ribs are, to me, the to go options. The pulled pork here is just amazing. Perfectly done with the right level of tenderness &amp; amazing flavor and that is without sauce because at Dinette, the pulled pork sandwich comes un-sauced. On the table, you have numerous options of sauces from which to choose from. You have a more classic Memphis BBQ sauce, a South Carolina mustard sauce and a vinegar based East Carolina sauce. Dinette Triple Crown also experiment with other sauce options from time to time. When I was there, the chef came over to provide me with a sample of his current concoction, a peach jalapeño sauce. Let me repeat that because I believe it deserves to be repeated: peach jalapeño sauce. Now, I really don't enjoy jalapeño spice but I definitely needed to try this one. I tried both it and the Memphis BBQ sauce. The BBQ sauce was spot-on and hit the notes you expect from a top notch BBQ place. The Peach jalapeño sauce was just out of bounds. Spicy to start with a nice sweetness midway to cool the pallet before the heat kicks up again at the finish, this sauce was ridiculous. Just ridiculous. Not sure how much I use it given my lack of hot sauce enjoyment but for those who do, Dinette does sell the sauces they make periodically so check it out with that's your style.All in all, Dinette Triple Crown is the best southern BBQ experience I've ever had. Period. Anyone who loves BBQ needs to stop over and give this place a shot. I will definitely be heading back very soon to try the rest of the menu.Cheers!"

/user_details?userid=QftemErhOQPdYClSpb924w,Jessa C.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",5 star rating,"YES YES AND YES! Amazing restaurant. Love everything about it-- the food, the vibe, the employees. My one major complaint is that they need to open their large dining room more often because they have such a high volume of clients, especially during the summertime when they do their whole picnic basket thing. The average wait time is likeeeeee an hour to an hour and a half. I've had to forego satisfying my pulled pork craving numerous times because I couldn't deal with it. During the winter, it's not so bad. The longest I ever waited was 15-20 mins at around 7:30pm on a Friday. Anyway, as for the food... the meat and 3's is my favourite. I usually get the pork or chicken with hushpuppies, sweet potato and creamy coleslaw. Real comfort food made with fresh ingredients. The Big Nasty is also a must-have. It's insanely rich, but your tastebuds will go nuts. If you like iced tea and lemonade, they make a good homemade Arnold Palmer (I get it spiked with some bourbon). A bit too sweet for my liking, but I still order it anyway."

Both very tasteful (not magical though). Lemonade was not the best. I do suggest this place for take-out as they will pack your order on a picnic ready basket with everything you need. I did not try the bar but it looks good. Next time I will call ahead for my order and enjoy it in the park across the street on a perfect picnic set."

/user_details?userid=9DIAN5dNWfXy1gLFj7I2Tw,Chris V.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,"In the years before I moved to Montreal, I lived mostly in Kansas and Texas. One thing that drives me crazy about Montreal is that I can never find any decent Tex-Mex or southern dives (no, 3 Amigos doesn't count, nor does serving a melted block of cheese in a bowl and calling it ""chile con queso"").This place exceeded expectations. I've had my fair share of Louisiana and South-east fare when I was in Texas, and this place encompasses both culinary traditions.Food: Triple Crown Dinette gives you the tapas option of ordering a bunch of sides and chowing down. My favorite option is the ""meat and three"" option - choose a meat (smoked brisket, pulled pork, fried chicken), and choose 3 sides (this includes a vast array of mouthwatering options, including buttermilk biscuits, cornbread, hushpuppies, collard greens, black eyed peas, cole slaw, and the most succulent fried sweet potatoes you've ever tasted). They also have quite a compelling beverage list - I chose a Bloody Caesar and was not disappointed. My friend ordered the brownie for dessert, and according to her, it was decadent.Sauce (yes, it needs its own category): I think the best thing about this place is the plate of jars and bottles that line the small dining area. I think there are 7 different sauces that you can use for your food - chile vinegar hot sauces, some sort of delicious BBQ sauce, and of course, the peach habañero salsa. The food is already delicious on its own, but this additional step to dressing the food really brings the dish to a whole new level.Atmosphere: With pickling vegetables in jars lining the wall cabinets of this cozy space, the restaurant is a casual yet warm and intimate setting. The kitchen is open to the dining area and you can smell the scents of foodstuffs wafting out while the chefs prepare your food. A word to the wise: this place is quite small, and the only tables are bar-style and lined along the walls. Make a reservation or get there early to get some good seats. As an alternative, I believe they also do carry-out orders.All in all, great place. I've been back a couple times with my friends (one who is from both Georgia and Alabama) and we are never disappointed. If you're a from the South and are feeling slightly jaded in this Northern city that offers little in the sense of Southern cuisine, give this place a visit."

This place easily ranks in my top five Montreal restaurants. Their chicken is so good, their sauce, even better. Everything here is a hit. Their mac and cheese is the best in Montreal. Simply delicious. I will be dining here whenever I am in the area."

We had the fried chicken with gravy and brisket which were very tasty.  We also tried the sweet potato fries, hushpuppies and coleslaw and they were delectable. Intrigued to try other items next time. Friendly and helpful customer service. Couldn't ask for more."
/user_details?userid=1WkBN4Wifbf5hoOzbT-jrQ,Mike C.,"Long Beach, CA",5 star rating,"We tried the Triple Crown on the recommendation of a local we were subletting an apartment from while visiting Montreal from California. The whole picnic and bring your own wine concept sounded great for my wife's birthday dinner, but to be honest, I wasn't expecting to find great southern fare in Quebec.  What a surprise. Everything was perfect from the food, the service and the well thought out picnic basket. We liked it so much we had to come back for our final dinner in the city before heading home.Their fried chicken is among the best or possibly the best I have ever have had and I've had plenty from Louisiana, Tennessee, and south Los Angeles.  It had a delicious, not overwhelmingly heavy, seasoned batter with thoroughly cooked and still moist meat.  The sides were amazing too. Golden mashed potatoes with perfect gravy, again seasoned nicely. Mac n Cheese that looked like maybe they finish off in a broiler and tasted as good as it looked. The greens were perfect too.  The hush puppies also were the best I've had, perfect, not rock hard or gritty like they are often served elsewhere.  On our second visit I wanted to try something different, so I ordered the brisket, (but had to have more of that fried chicken too). The brisket was just as great as the chicken, a generous serving that was tender and flavorful with a great BBQ sauce.  The only desert we tried was their perfectly baked lemon meringue pie that was far above the standard. There was nothing in our two visits that we did not like or had us saying to ourselves ""this would be better if..."" So as good as the food was it was nice that everything else about this place was just as great. The hip young owners were extremely helpful and friendly in describing the menu as well as special sides and desserts they had for that day.  And when our food came up everything was efficiently packed in a basket for us to carry over to Little Italy Park across the street. Though they have some limited counter space inside to eat, with the weather so nice the park was the place to have our meal.  The picnic basket had everything we could need; a real table cloth, towel, large mason jar of drinking water, real glasses for the water and another set for our wine, corkscrew, candle & lighter, real plates and utensils (not paper or plastic), napkins and a trio of squeeze bottles containing their great sauces. The tables in the park did fill up on each evening we were there, so get there early."

But it took nearly 25 minutes to be served, and there is no space to eat inside the restaurant. It is basically just a large space to order at the counter. But, it looks like most people who ordered there were heading out to the park across the street with the picnic baskets they give away. Pretty awesome"
/user_details?userid=cqagyVkvbBB32agnJsIhVA,Ephraim D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Second time visiting and it's even better than last time. The hush puppies get two thumbs up, really great and spiced so well. The chicken pieces are a bit small, if you ask me, but still delicious. I love southern fried chicken and this is delicious. Service with a smile."
/user_details?userid=-KduD3wwydWDq2GrODh2tw,Richard H.,"Indianapolis, IN",4 star rating,"When visiting Montreal from the US mid-west, why not visit a place specializing in American southern cooking? The chef is from Kentucky, the menu is representative of great regional American cuisine. The staff is super super friendly and knowledgeable. The fried chicken is delicious, as is the macaroni and cheese. Greens and beans are both flavored excellently. Stray misfires: the oddly gray mashed potatoes and gravy, the lackluster cornbread and the bread pudding which doesn't resemble any bread pudding I have ever encountered. The dinette itself is tiny, but they do often open the larger dining room two doors down (but connected to the restaurant behind the stairway between the two shops)."
/user_details?userid=mYQmaTeWp87sGnE-rHvIOw,Evelyn G.,"Golden Square Mile, Canada",2 star rating,"On my way to another eatery, I was intrigued by the reviews and decided to override my initial choice. I ordered the 10 piece chicken, Mac and cheese, and the coleslaw. Because it was take out only, I was told it was about a 20 minute wait. I asked for the picnic basket so I could take it across the street and eat with my 3 children. 45 minutes later (!!!!) I ditched the picnic basket idea and went straight home. I now had big expectations for this much talked about fried chicken.  The big chunky pieces of chicken were fatty and undercooked. Unbelievable! The Mac and cheese lacked pep, and the coleslaw was actually the only saving grace of the whole meal and that's not great given my kids didn't get past the fatty chicken. Neither did I. It was frankly just gross. I really really really wanted to like this place as the people were friendly and the atmosphere lively.  Will keep looking for the best fried chicken because it's definitely not at this place."

Kentucky Mule's and Old Fasioned's are out of this world from there.  The deep fried sweet potatoes are a must have for sweet potato enthusiasts like me.  The hushpuppies are deep fried cornbread and taste great too.  I was also a big fan of the collard greens... delish.  Very eclectic place inside... really feels like it is straight out of Kentucky or Tennessee.  The proprietor/chef is from Kentucky so you know this spot is legit.  I'm adding this place to my must hit spots in Montreal."

We shared the creamy coleslaw and the sweet potato side. The brisket was really fatty and hard to bite through. The sauce and the bun were good though. The fried chicken was not crispy, pretty soggy. The creamy coleslaw was delicious. There were 4 sweet potato pieces, and the 2 smaller ones were good. However, the 2 larger pieces were pretty undercooked and not really edible. Sauce that went with them was good. Had the lemonade, that was good too. It was nice having a picnic, but for 41$, it wasn't worth it and I don't plan on going back. Blackstrap BBQ in Verdun, imo, is much better."

There is no question that what they serve is heavy soul food, but they are able to do it without making the food feel greasy. The taste is clean, and the ingredients are of exceptional quality. Most importantly, though, is that the food is absolutely delicious. Their sauces are incredible, the fried chicken is juicy, and they serve the best mashed potatoes I've ever had, hands down."

We once came in 6 of us, and we're all big eaters, so we were able to order one of everything off the menu. We were completely satisfied with every single dish! The standout dishes were definitely the hush puppies, mac and cheese and pulled pork! And for the first time in my life, I had bread pudding. This is something I have never been interested in, cause the idea of bread in a pudding sounds gross. Well I happily eat my words, their bread pudding has turned me. I can never not order every time I walk in those doors. It's unfortunate how hard it is to find, and how tiny the place is considering how huge many people want to be eating there. everyone behind the counter was awesome, and the chef even lived in the south, which explains why everything tasted so authentic. definitely recommend!"
