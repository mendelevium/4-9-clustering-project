/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,First time ordering this spot!I enjoyed it but I wasn't a fan of the pork at all found it bland but the rest was good. If I were to try it again I would get the chicken as that's my preference for protein.
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Good burrito! We ordered the pulled pork and chorizo burrito and chicken tinga burrito. Both were good but I preferred the flavor and texture of the pulled pork. The burritos were loaded and sizeable. I think it's worth the $12. We also ordered a side of chips and salsa for just $2.99. The salsa was so good! I wish I had a jar to dip my burrito in. The chips were ok, they were a bit stale."

I tried it for the first time today, they are very good and the most important is you get to choose what you want inside. Their portion is very generous. I took a Jarrito as well for drink"
/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"As an American, I'm on a constant quest to find something that feels like Chipotle in Montreal. This isn't really it, but it's close to my work and super tasty. The meat is well done (I've gotten beef and pork) and I like that they have the option to add queso fresco (although it costs extra) and pickled onions which isn't common for American tex-mex places. I always get the bowl and the portion is good. A tad bit smaller than chipotle's. I'm generally pretty full after eating here. The location itself doesn't have a lot of seating inside, just a few chairs along a tall bar that you can eat at. Generally we pick up our food and take it to go. Docking a star because it's pretty pricey for being a tex-mex place (I think my bowl is normally around $15.) I know it's trying to be fancy and more local-feeling, but since I eat here for work lunch it's generally competing with other places that are around $10 for lunch."

It's being able to make them yourself!!!   The only problem is that the stuffing is so good that the wraps are never big enough. The chicken and pulled pork are 100% yum.  You absolutely MUST top with the pickled onions!!! It really adds an extra dimension to your taco. Their chips are very crispy, thick cut and pretty addictive with the guacamole. Tostitos got nothing on them!"
/user_details?userid=CtBx4yk_QM8ClITgw94TPQ,Simon P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I had been meaning to try Tejano for a while because of my love for its older brother, Blackstrap BBQ, and because I do enjoy the Chipotle-style burritos.I have to say, Tejano delivered a solid burrito, and much to my delight, their options are more creative than Chipotle and it's local copycat, M4. The meat is better, the ingredients fresh, and they are not just your standard grilled veggies. I had the beef and chipotle salsa - it was nicely spicy.I really enjoyed the queso fresco and the south-west slaw, it adds a very nice touch.It's a shame that it's not in a super convenient location because I would go more regularly. I would say that it is definitely a better option that comparable restaurants in the region."
/user_details?userid=e30nkqMd2leReeIllmQdfw,Ella C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Their portions and services change every time i go.... Sometimes the burrito is big... sometimes its super small... Also workers can be friendly and rude... it really depends on when you go. also their ingredient quality varies too. few times.... i wanted to leave the store bc the ingredients look horrible. but then other days its fresh. so I pray every time I go it is fresh and hope the worker is nice and give me nice portion. or I just look thru the window and if the worker looks mean.... I dont go... plenty of other good places to eat.
/user_details?userid=OIAFoJ_qs8XS_MeIDDjt0A,Jean-Sebastien B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Best burrito in Montreal, plain and simple. You can either hit chicken, beef or port. It may sound simple but trust me, all you need is right in there!Service can be a bit slow during lunch time but it's worth the wait!"
/user_details?userid=TmlkyseQw8gojp1a9Ttd0g,David B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My life has changed since I've tried this burrito joint, mostly because it is so far the best price vs quality spot in Montreal as far as a rapid Mexican snack goes.For under 20$ you can get a burrito the size of a newborn baby, filled with a great portion of meat (chicken, pulled pork, beef) and toppings (pretty much all you could desire in a burrito). The meat is quality as well, cooked on site, non of that pre-cooked or frozen food BS.Definitely a must if you are into Mexican food."
/user_details?userid=rCGtTxHOWlTEVUuVUDd03A,David K.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",4 star rating,We were looking for something like burritos and saw this place was nearby so we went in. Great staff. Friendly and helpful. Fun toppings to make it your own. Kind of like chipotle but a little more local feeling. The burritos were good. The quest fresco was tasty. I'd go back.
/user_details?userid=Ao1fWpdW5DhGBIIcu7nVKg,Matt H.,"Lexington, MA",5 star rating,We were in town to pick up my son who was finishing up his first year of university. No one felt like going out and we decided to order from Tejano (Uber Eats). It was excellent. A very interesting take on burritos; loved the Texas infusion without being a gloppy Tex Mex mess.Definitely worth it.
