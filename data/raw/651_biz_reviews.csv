When we got there, it was empty, but as we ate, the place became packed! The service was great! The waiter was very prompt and explained the menu items to us quite clearly. We all ordered from the lunch menu and it came to about 14$ after tax. I was full, but I wasn't bursting! We were all able to finish our plates without trouble. It was the perfect quantity! I got the red curry item on the lunch menu. It came with lots of veggies and some rice. Personally, I could've used a bit more rice, but again, I was satisfied. All in all, good price for good food. I would definitely come back!"
/user_details?userid=Mt-_SvJyDirR9fpZx9dbEw,Tommy S.,"Bellevue, WA",5 star rating,"Tucked away under a run-of-the-mill hair salon on Cote-des-Neiges road, Tuk Tuk is an unpretentious BYOB restaurant where you can tuck into hearty Thai & Cambodian grub. By a fluke, in the depths of winter, this restaurant's signage caught my eye. I specifically took notice of the logo: a cute three-weeled taxi, also known as a ""tuk tuk"" in Asia, likely the source of inspiration for the restaurant's name. This auto-rickshaw epitomizes Thailand, Cambodia, and other southern Asian nations: the hustle and bustle of urban life, the chaos of traffic, the aroma of curry, the ubiquity of cheap massages, etc. The sensual imagery evoked by this mere emblem was a compelling reason for me to give this place a shot.Whilst Tuk Tuk was desolate when I entered, I was received with pomp and circumstance. The sole waiter rolled out the red carpet for me, and ushered me to an intimate table. I sank into a snug chair, and leaned forward to peruse the structured menu. Boy was I spoiled for choice: they had everything, from soup to nuts! Although variety is indeed the spice of life, I opted for green curry beef. In two shakes of a lamb's tail, my dish was severed with good manners. I was all smiles as I gobbled down my supper. The beef was tender and full of flavour. The medley of vegetables produced a tang that was out of this world. Before you can say Jack Robinson, I was blissfully sated.All things considered, this informal setting is ideal for an indolent night with your consort when you don't feel like cooking. The prices are easy on the pocket, and the decor is easy on the eyes. Most importantly, the food is succulent and will leave you lost for words."

/user_details?userid=voFxNdzhG-cDrW_9NzFGbw,Denzil D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is a 3.5 stars but Yelp has no halfsies. Overall I was really happy with my experience. The place was clean and with nice simple decor. The staff, one guy only, was very good. Bilingual and fast even though he was alone to serve a whole restaurant. The meal was good, the green curry was good but the best part was by far their EXCELLENT VERSION OF FRIED RICE. THIS IS HOW FRIED RICE SHOULD BE, light and fluffy without being fried or over cooked. I will go back and try more because if they make any other dish as good as the fried rice I would make this a true 4 star rating. Enjoy."
/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,D'Arcy L.,"Terrebonne, Canada",3 star rating,I'm no expert in Thai food. I've never been to Thailand (but it's on my bucket list). Sure I've seen Anthony Bourdain's No reservations - Thailand and I enjoy North American aromatic-fragrant- spicy Thai food. However I'm only an amateur.  So when checking out Tuk Tuk's reviews I was thoroughly intrigued. I was happy to see it was advertised as Cambodian-Thai. The owners are Cambodian and cook Thai food in their own special twist. I went ahead and ordered four dishes plus a Thai ice tea. The Thai iced tea was very good and similar in taste to many other places however much stronger and sweeter. I went and asked the guy working the counter if he could put some more ice in it to mellow out the strong flavour a bit. He did and it was good to go! Here's a run down of the dishes ordered for takeout:1) Chicken Pad Thai - did not taste anywhere near Pad Thai I know and have experienced. The ones I prefer are in a sweet tamarind base sauce that are tangy/spicy as well. Flavour was okay a bit bland and not so much flavour with smaller pieces of chicken. Not exactly as we prefer. 2.75/52) Beef Pad Sew- From what I have experienced Pad Sew is typically in a soy sauce base. This pad sew was more like stir fry. It wasn't horrible but I would not consider the flavour and taste as memorable. 3/53) Cha Kneiy Chicken (Ginger Stir Fry)- similar to other Ginger based stir fry's I've had at other Cambodian restaurants. Both my wife and I found very bland. 2/54) Chicken Amok- creamy curry in coconut milk.  - this was the best dish out of all of the ones ordered. Very fragrant creamy and lots of flavour. 5/5I appreciate that these people do try to serve Thai food but For me it's slightly above average. If I return I'd look to enjoy some more traditional Cambodian dishes. This I'm certain they would excel at.I've still yet to find a Thai place better than my go to Bangkok Thai.  The search continues.
/user_details?userid=aNoufJaj5B5HeegjuqAdnw,Jeba B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Seriously good! It actually took a lot for me to say yes to going here. This superb spot was recommended to me by a friend. All they said was that it was a small Thai spot located in cote de neige. Not the closest spot to my home and I really didn't want to run the risk of getting bad Thai food... But I went and I was amazingly surprised. Tuk Tuk is a small spot seating about 32. Nothing about it visually really stands out and there are few indicators as to what the meals will be other than the menus. Our server was super nice and attentive and happy to answer our questions.... Anyways about the food. The menu has a number of Cambodian dishes and I think these are where the restaurant shines. The Ali's du Tuk Tuk was a great way to start. Fresh citrus, tender... Tennnnder chicken and yummy spicy peppers opened us up to what was coming next. The  talapia amok was so flavourful and cooked to perfection. The blades lemongrass in this dish brought it to another level. The fresh springrolls ...were actually fresh. Celery in soup is not my thing but this Tom yum killllled it!the pad Thai was also really delicious but we found ourselves asking for extra fish sauce. Lastly borbor tnaot is my new favourite dessert. If you like fresh coconut cream, soft tapioca and a perfectly sweetens pudding I would recommend.I would check it out! One downside was that not everything on the menus was available."
/user_details?userid=WmIqb6uCqJbxWp9k7ZU-hw,Jennifer T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I came to Tuk Tuk with my friends after Hearing them say how delicious their pad thai was! I've always loved pad thai so since day one hearing them say that, I knew I have to come to Tuk Tuk and try their pad thai!We came for dinner (didn't make reservation but we got seated right after we arrived). It took us a little bit of time before deciding what we wanted (they have a big variety of Thai and Cambodian dishes on their menu). The waiter was extremely friendly and answered my friend's question patiently.We finally decided to share all the dishes and ordered the fried calamari as appetizer, the tofu  pad thai, the beef pad si'eve and the chicken cha chou em. Their fried calamari didn't look or taste like what I've expected. I thought it would be the greek style calamari... But then I remember we were in a Thai and Cambodian restaurant! Their fried calamari tasted more ""Chinese"" because of the salt and pepper (you can find a lot of salt and pepper dishes in Chinese cuisine). The dish wasn't bad at all but it wasn't the kind of fried calamari I wanted to eat haha! The tofu pad thai was pretty good (I ordered it non-spicy), the portion was big enough to be split. Their so-called tofu was more like dried bean curd cake/dried tofu (豆乾), which I liked a lot. The dried tofu was stir-fried first, which made it tastier. I prefer this texture since it is harder and chewier than the soft and easy-to-break tofu texture. I would enjoyed this dish more if they have given more lemon, they only gave me one slice of lemon and it wasn't enough to bring the whole pad thai flavour to the max...The beef pad si'eve, which was pad sew (thick rice noodle stir-fried in soy sauce) tasted good but very ""Chinese"". This flavour was something you could easier get at any Asian restaurants. There wasn't any Thai or Cambodian touch to it...The chicken cha chou em was like a general tao but not quite it. Besides the sweet and sour sauce, there was a South-East asian taste because of the coconut milk and Thai basil. My friends didn't quite like it because there were too much vegetables they didn't like (celery, peppers, etc.) However, I enjoyed the vegetables because they were really fresh and crunchy, especially the celery! The only remark I have was, the rice they gave was definitely not enough for the amount of sauce there! Tuk Tuk is a bring your own wine restaurant and it gets busier at night (around 7-8 pm). It is a small restaurant so the seats fill up quickly. I recommend making reservations! The restaurant gets very very noisy/loud as well (it wouldn't be suitable for a romantic dinner or a date since you can hardly hear what the person seating in front of you is saying..)"
/user_details?userid=mLmgtTwuryDjJAQrSZ_w5w,Karina W.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"A truly awesome Thai restaurant is Montreal is really hard to come by, so I was really keen on giving Tuk Tuk a try. Came here on a Saturday evening around 6.30 and was seated right away. The place was rather chic, cosy and clean. White table cloths without an air of pretentiousness. We were two and ordered the chili thai basil chicken with rice and fish Amok with rice. We got the amok because the waiter told us it was very popular and a lot of Yelpers also said good things about it. I chose the chili thai chicken basil because it's one of my favorite thai dishes so I have a pretty good idea of what it should taste like.The service was quite quick and we got our food not long after ordering. The first thing I noticed was the heap of vegetables on my plate with a tiny ball of rice in the corner. The amount of vegetables was rather overwhelming, to be honest, and I was scared to find out how much (or little) chicken/fish was hiding beneath them. My fear was right for the chili thai basil dish. I would say the veg/protein ratio was 4 to 1 and that was disappointing. Thankfully, the sauce was good. The fish amok was more reasonable. The size of the fish filet - though still really small in comparison with the vegies - was decent. The fish amok sauce was excellent and we were wishing there was more rice so we could enjoy every last drop of the leftover sauce. We were still hungry after the meal.Though the quality of food was great, I'm not sure I'd go back simply because the veg/protein/rice balance was extremely off."
/user_details?userid=P0J2H0XoJmcPzdwtJUHLcQ,Sadia H.,"Laval, Canada",3 star rating,"This cute little restaurant is tucked away in a quiet corner of CDN - a blink-and-you'll-miss-it sort of location. However, this is def a go-to place if you're in the area. The conventional flavors of SE-Asian cuisine that us, non-SE-Asians are used to (from other restaurants) are all there but with some added kicks of flavor. We ordered the beef salad which was an interesting dish to say the least. The beef strips were flavorful and succulent but as a salad, it didn't really fit that name-tag. We also ordered the 'chicken and shrimp fried rice' which was very delicious. The best fried rice I've had in Montreal till now. The rice they use here is smaller and lighter so the flavors in the fried rice come through stronger. We also ordered the Amok (a chicken curry dish) but I was more impressed with the fried rice because I was expecting more heat and flavor in the Amok. Hence because two out of the three dishes didn't impress me too much, I'll give this place three stars for now but I'll go back and try more dishes there. The restaurant was a refreshing find and even the Ikea catalog-esque decor was charming. It was simple and served the purpose yet it was elegant. I loved the jazz music backdrop and the staff were friendly."

Staffs are super friendly and nice! I usually always order their pad thai, spring roll and thai tea. But recently I've tried a new plate called ""Amok"" and I've fallen in love with it. It's a Kroeung with coconut milk and cream, it basically tastes like curry but with some lime in it so it doesn't make you feel too heavy when eating it. It comes with rice and vegetables with a choice of chicken, tofu, shrimp or fish. This plate is one of their specialty and so I would recommend it :)"

Came here wanting my monthly pad thai fix (trust me, you don't want to see me on a pad thai withdrawal day!)The staff is super friendly. They made a mistake on my order (ordered the beef pad thai and got the tofu pad thai) but offered to change it right away. Lunch comes with salad or soup and my soup was good (though Uber spicy!)Not the best pad thai I've had (lack a little bit of zest) but it relieved my fix and it goes for a quick lunch."
/user_details?userid=FuW1EwnbQoHyDMeOGrljsg,Khanh L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"One of very few cambodian restaurants in town.There may be others but in most you have one or two cambodian dishes and that's pretty much it.A lot of the dishes here are similar to thai dishes. The one pearl I found here is the mango salad. It is amazing. The mango is julienned and served with shrimp in a vinegary salad dressing, it is very light and fresh. there are bits of fried garlic as garnish and that really adds some nice flavor. It is a perfect dish.I've had other dishes her, but this is the only one I remember. They also have larb here which is a minced meat salad, although larb is also traditional in Laos and thai cuisine so don't know if this version is strictly cambodian style or not.I definitely recommend this place, it's not pricey and interesting if you are looking to find something new you haven't had before."
/user_details?userid=TCf3Qt9yyaU6kYERVTcBWw,Imran K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"My wife and I ordered the spicy papaya salad, peanut shrimp, basil chicken, and Vietnamese iced coffee. The first two, we order often from different restaurants so we are picky. The salad and the Vietnamese iced coffee were really good. Unfortunately our two mains (shrimp and chicken dishes) didn't compare to other south East Asian restaurants we've eaten from. Too much vegetable with little meat and insufficient flavour. Expensive for what you get. The basil chicken was supposed to be spicy by wasn't. I'd recommend other South East Asian restaurants nearby. Pick up was efficient and the gentleman was polite."

The traditional spices allow each dish to vary from being spicy, savoury, tangy, rich, refreshing to sweet (desserts). Dishes can be made spicier or less spicy upon request. Dishes can also be modified in case of allergies. Drop by during the afternoon to take advantage of the lunch menu or arrive in the evening to enjoy an unrushed meal served by a loving family."

My son had a tom yum soup and it looked nothing like the pic nor did it taste like it. It tasted more like a pho. Pad Thai was decent. The currys had good flavour though, but again, if your hungry order more. unfortunately wouldn't come again due to price value comparison. Especially for eating in a basement restaurant. Due to the BYOB option, his may be why prices are higher than normal for the plate size."

I do not think it is authentic cuisine because i felt that it was seasoned with spices that was very exotic. Maybe some kind of white washed asian food? But i cant lie and tell that the food was bad. Tasted pretty good. The people were nice but the food was just like other asian fast food places (ex.thai express). It wasnt like family oriented kind of asian food? I could be wrong. But i wont be going there again i think, ill just try to find more autenthic culture challenging places."

Minced chicken mixed with a very aromatic sauce of chili, lime, Thai basil, mint, with shallots and garlic mixed together with toasted rice. My first reaction to this was it would make such a kickass dumpling filling, unfortunately, these countries don't really share a boarder with a dumpling wrapping nation to have ever berth this culinary epiphany.
