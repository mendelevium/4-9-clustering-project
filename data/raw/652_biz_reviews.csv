I should be giving 5* just based on that but truth is the food is also decent.Went there for the oyster fest $10 for a dozen oysters and an alcoholic drink. That's a pretty sweet deal!Once there, we also tried their duo of beef and salmon tartare. Presentation was really nice but the tartare lacked a bit of seasoning. They bring you their variety of hot sauces so you can adjust to your liking. We also ordered their chocolate chip cookie with ice cream and it was warm and cheewy.The decor of the place is also pretty nice. I would go back to try other items on their menu."

They run around looking busy but they don't do anything ?They have no beer on tap ? Only red stripe and a Japanese's beer ( not cool ) drinks aren't anything special but they are $10 which is not crazy.Food took so long we almost had to cancel our one plate that we were sharing which was beef rib. We got it after an hour but was very disappointed, they put so much sauce that it was drowning I thought it was a poutine due to that much sauce. The meat was fatty but I enjoyed the taste. They menu said fries and beef not a pool of sweet sauce all over ur fries with meat in the middle. Ask for your sauce on the side you will be much more happier.Calamari was great but the caca cocktail sauce they serve with it needs to be changed to an aioli.Oysters were okay but had a few bad ones.Would I return ? No"

Took over an hour to get our food from when we sat down to getting our main dish( and it wasnt even that busy). Bit pricey , and food was meh, with portions on the smaller side. Great ambience , but all in all, rather spend a hefty bill somewhere else."

The level of service I had last night at this resto was beyond compare ! I really have to give a lot of kuddos to the entire staff! They were so quick and responsive to everything I requested. Food came out so fast one after the other.The drinks are amazing just wish they had more options for cocktails such as frozen cocktail drinksFood: ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! We came on a Thursday night when they had their 1$ oyster special we ended up ordering 36 oysters! Ahhh they were so big and succulent ! They were shucked with great finesse ! Overall, i.came here with low expectations and they definitely changed my entire experience!! They're awesome i recommend this amazing resto to any oyster fanatic hehe Yummy !!! Writing this is so difficult as it forces me to crave more of their amazing food !!100% recommend and will definitely be back."
/user_details?userid=AdWHssUZ1UAQogNys7uweA,Glenn S.,"Peterborough, Canada",1 star rating,Avoid unless you want a bad experience. The restaurant was not crowded. Yet it took over 45 minutes from order to when our hamburgers were delivered to the table.  The waitress did not give us a heads up or an apology for the unexplained delay.  The fries were cold and soggy by the time they arrived. All this for a $19 cheeseburger.  Waste of money.

/user_details?userid=RxPndFw7sdSX4hWMbIJBGQ,Philippe G.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,"Working in the mile end, I usually don't like to stay in the mile end for supper. But there was a Groupon for this place so we decided to try it.Or after reading some of the reviews here I was not expecting some great things but I was pleasantly suprised. First thing is the service is great. There's plenty of staff that you never have to look far if you need something. Second, their terrasse is really good. I usually hate terrasses in montreal because they are taking over the sidewalk, you smell the gasoline of cars the whole time and everybody that passed by looks at what you eat. Not an issue here. Their terrasse is on a street corner, not on the sidewalks and they have some small plants between the terrasse so you don't have people staring at your food when they pass by.For the food... the menu is not big and is not complicated but the choice we did were good. My girlfriend had the salmon tartare and the lamb. Both were good. I tasted some of her lamb skewers and the meat was tender and good. Considering that I don't like lamb, theirs is really good. I had the chili cheese fries and the salmon. I find there are 2 ways to cook salmon: 1 way is t softly that it melts in your mouth. The second way is to eat it hard so it forms that crust that adds to the taste. They do the second way here and they to it well. It's not a melt in your mouth salmon but it's one that is really good. For the chili, my only downside is that I should have asked for more sour cream.I might make it sound like all was good but there were a couple of downside, which is why they get a 4 star. First thing is that they don't have a huge selection of beer and they were out of almost all of them. On a Thursday evening that's suprising. Second, my girlfriend ordered a cocktail and they gave her the wrong one. The one they gave her was actually really good so she kept it but it's the principle. And the last thing is that the music was too loud. We were trying to enjoy a nice conversation which was possible at the beginning  but at one point they increased the volume and it was hard to hear ourselves after."

Came on a Thursday and they had a nice crowd!The experience was actually pretty good! The service, food and the ambiance was excellent! We started with the Steak tartar & Calamari which we both enjoyed! Followed with the Cod (delicious) and the baby back ribs (falling off the bone)! Desert we had the soft cookie & ice cream (clear winner) and the cannoli (pass)! We expected ""bar style"" food but found Greasy Spoon delivers far more than that!Staff and servers were on top of there game, water and drinks flowing and our meals were timed perfectly with a full house (terrace).

I guess there menu has a variety of American classics, we took a couple of drinks which were over priced, but they were very boozy so I guess that's okay.I took there burger and truffle fries, the burger had the classic toppings with a version  of there house made Big Mac sauce. Nothing special about the burger but the fries were very good. Nicely seasoned and an earthy note with the truffle oil. My gf took the bavette with fries, the bavette had a green salsa over it, didn't add much to the dish. We also tried there pulled pork Mac and cheese. We found it too sweet.Overall I would give it another chance even though I wasn't that impressed."

Food is good; ambiance is good; staff are good; prices are good. All sounds a little mediocre, right? But no.

/user_details?userid=7RcgjZLzBqEfTLAH6rQtRQ,Emmalee C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The food was delicious! It was a combination of Asian fusion slash sophisticated steakhouse style in a rustic type of restaurant. The decor was pretty cool, but I must warn my fellow PETA peeps that there are a few animal trophy heads around, so be warned! The staff was super cool and amazing so major props to them  For appetizers, we got the salmon tartar that was mixed with some siracha and Balsamic reduction, and ""Ruben Imperial Rolls"" which has smoked meat, sauerkraut & Swiss cheese in it. The latter sounded kinda iffy to me but my bf wanted to give it a try and it was pretty good! For mains we got the bavette and lamb, both were perfectly cooked at medium rare. And for desserts we got the baked cookie with ice cream and the Nutella bread pudding. I've never had bread pudding before and I chose that one because I just love Nutella, and it was so mouth-watering good! I find that the portions for each section of the meal was perfect, we didn't feel overly stuffed at the end. The only down side for me would be the price, a tad bit too much for me. However, considering the fact that the menu changes every so often I would definitely consider coming back and giving the new items a try"

/user_details?userid=58IYRjxtf_E4XNUXysecdw,Marc M.,"Keller, TX",4 star rating,"Is it me or do restaurants in Montreal seem more expensive than even cities like New York or LA?The food here was very good.  I had gazspacho (thick tomato with a bit of zesty spice from the peppers - it needed more tortilla strips for the size of the bowl) and a the panzanella salad.  I drank one cocktail (L'Outremont - friends don't let other male friend's order this drink.  I read the ingredients - vodka, chambord, prosceco - and thought it would be a refreshing summer drink  It WAS, but it was served in a champagne flute and was more prosecco than vodka) and one glass of red wine.  My tab was $60 before tip!My dining companion enjoyed his dishes as well - tuna tartare starter and grilled salmon over rice, but again we felt wanting something more;.  They only have three desserts so we walked down the street to Juliet & Chocolat.This is a good place - especially in better weather.  They have a new patio and even the interior has a good vibe.  Service was excellent and I swear our server was related to Katie Holmes."

Consistently slow service was accompanied by a nonchalant staff who neglected to inform us that the only accepted form of payment was cash due to a machine issue until they brought out the check. Not to mention, the lack of sufficient soup and a broken beer tap. Most nights, I am a reasonable woman, but I simply cannot wrap my head around the halt in the information train from server to customer."
/user_details?userid=XTyyscBj9LEtRsuOz7D5Nw,Danielle K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Food was great. Service, not so much.Went with a living social deal and had the Beef Tartare (amazing), Tuna Tataki (also good, but preferred the Beef) for appetizers. Mains were the lobster roll and pork ribs; the prices are a bit high for what you get, but since we had the deal we weren't too fussed. I wouldn't pay full price for those items. The dessert was called ""After Eight Cheesecake"" but it's banana cheese cake with Scor bar on top...a bit deceiving.Overall our waiter was VERY slow. Took almost 15 minutes before anyone even brought us water. Half an hour before we had drinks on the table and didn't get our appetizers until over an hour after we sat down. Everyone was running around like chickens with their heads cut off, but it wasn't event that busy, and there were tons of staff.Overall I wouldn't go back, the price vs. the portions and service just don't cut it."
/user_details?userid=m86Xo6qwW1ckOtYvbFnncA,Anthony M.,"San Francisco, CA",2 star rating,"First time going to this restaurant and sadly will not come back. I was there with a group of friends. We went on a Wednesday. The restaurant was not too busy; only a couple other tables than ours. We had reserved 2 weeks in advance so the restaurant could prepare for a large group. We also picked a day where the meals would be easy and quick (Wednesday is burger day). Result: 1 waitress for the whole group, kitchen took 2 hours to serve all of us. Served 2-3 burgers at a time in 15 minute patches. Orders were confused, missing ingredients, drinks ordered took forever to be served. We were told the issue was in the kitchen, but it was the waitress that had to come out and tell us. Manager did not show his face to explain the delay.. basically let the waitress hang high and dry. The manager tried to make-up for the lack by giving us free desert and some shots on the house, which was appreciated. The food, when it got there, was tasty but extremely salty; at least it was the best part.All in all, we were all very dissatisfied. Even though the food was good, the experience was not what we expected at all. And I believe management poorly handled the situation by only coming out at the end when some of us actually complained. And I am extremely displeased with how the waitress was treated. Obviously by us because she was the only coming out to see us. SHE DID NOT DESERVE IT. If anything, she should be compensated and management should rethink how they treat their employees. It's not up to her to face the client if the kitchen is slow."

This was an extremely over priced, confused place. I ordered a lobster roll ($26) and a Paloma ($10) to drink. The lobster roll was good. Not $26 good, but good enough. The drink tasted really watered down, so I told the waitress (something that took a lot of guts for me- I very rarely return food for not liking it) - I was as polite as I could be, but the waitress gave me a bit more attitude than I expected! She ended up taking it off of my bill, but only gave eye contact to my husband for the remainder of the evening. And stopped refilling our tiny water glasses.

/user_details?userid=ysHgcTWBeI7h3ymHeHRhIw,Erin K.,"Westmount, Canada",1 star rating,"Let's start off by saying that the name of this restaurant is very befitting of the owner...he is quite greasy looking. If you expect to sit at a normal table on a normal chair, this place is NOT for you. They only have oversized bar tables and 100 pound oversized stools to sit on. These tables and stools are so crammed into this tiny hole of a restaurant (honestly, I think the terrace is bigger than the restaurant), that you will probably have to get up every single time the low-class asshole of a person at the table next to you goes out to smoke, (which in my experience was about 4 times in the course of an hour). If you object (as well you should), and don't get up, as was the case, the greasy owner will stare you down for the rest of your meal and talk shit about you in French to the other patrons and waiters. I'm sorry sir, but this is no way to run a restaurant. The food here is actually pretty good, but the atmosphere and owner explain why this place is constantly offering half price deals on Living Social.  They probably wont be around much longer. It's almost impossible to hear the person/people you are there with, because you're practically sitting at the same table as the people next to you."

Too sweet, under seasoned and fall apart...but not in the good way.  My girlfriend had the duck confit club sandwich, which missed the mark and was a bit of a gong show, even compared to the pulled pork sandwich. I'm sure she would have settled for a standard club sandwich that maintained it's structural integrity. You know what I'm sayin'??? (fart noise)Waka Waka"

I'm not a writer nor a food critic but I do enjoy eating out and especially eating good food! I had my reservations about this place (w/ numerous of bad reviews everywhere) but we had a Teambuy/Groupon deal for this meal. The coupon was about to expire therefore we had to use it. Food is not everything nor is service unless you're a staple of the city. Part I: - Walked into the restaurant, no one greeted us while I see staff behind the bar whom are available.- Reserved  for 8:30 got there at 9 and the table WASN'T READY- In order to save time, we ordered as the waitress gave us the menuPart II: The food finally came after 35-40min wait. The kitchen is slow for such a small restaurant. (The runner was the one who delivered our food not our waitress) We DIDN'T even have the CHANCE to take a bite and the waitress was breathing down our neck and asked ""How's your meal??"". Can you at least give us the chance to try the food first!? Numerous times we tried to flag down a staff, they totally ignored us. It's not as if they were busy because I see people behind the bar chit-chatting, etc. Part III:It's time to pay the bill, the waitress had horrible etiquette. She was standing right next to us the whole time while we were punching our credit card information. Normally, you give the CC terminal and you walk away. You let the customer do his/her duties then come back and you don't STALK the customer!!!The sad part about everything...the food was actually good. These reviews totally make sense...AVOID IT!"

(Lawrence was closed...sadly) The way the oysters was presented to us was a bit cheap, which I didn't like. The lemon was not cut in nicer wedges (it was half a lemon, I had to cut it myself), the sauce was watery, there was no rock salt etc. I hate to compare, but Lawrence definitely gets more points for presentation. But nonetheless we still enjoyed our oysters. My friend and I ordered starters. Both delicious. She had a salmon tartare, while I had the chorizo with tomato confit onion tartlette. We didn't order mains because the downside of this place is, it gets quite expensive.Service was generally quite pleasant. I would not go here for oysters though. It was 12 for 24$ So 2$/oyster.

They were very good, but the accompanying Tarragon cole slaw was not to my taste, oh well, the chips were delicious!I was looking forward to my one bite of After 8 cheesecake, but I found the mint overpowering.  The half-baked cookie with ice cream, on the other hand, was sinfully delicious, but NO WAY could you possibly finish it.We will definitely go back, there are lots of interesting-sounding dishes on the menu!Service was excellent!"

I've been there a dozen times and have been treated like royalty at some times, and like a leper others. Very bizarre. Anyways.The decor is awesome - super casual but intriguing - think Aspen chic with a bit of hipster influence, but not too much. In the dead of winter, especially during a snowstorm, this place is like an oasis in the desert. So warm and inviting. The food is generally excellent. The menu rotates, but in general everything is casual and tasty, albeit at slightly increased prices compared to what a normal bistro should be. I usually spend upwards of $150 for two including some cheap wine, which is on the higher end of the scale for the casual resto. The usual fare is there - upscale macaroni and cheese, burgers, etc. but sometimes they do some off-the-wall things, like schnitzel with a sunnyside egg cracked over it, or lobster sandwiches, etc. Overall, worth a try.

For dessert I had the half baked chocolate cookie with ice cream. It was good but lacked in the chocolate chip department. My dining partner is vegetarian and they have a lot of dishes that they will offer a vegetarian option for by replacing the meat with their house made falafel. She started with the tater tot poutine and it was excellent. The mac and cheese with falafel replacing the sausage was less excellent, but acceptable.

It was an extremely underwhelming meal, and I left thinking 'Pft, not comin' back here...'. Alas, a girlfriend of mine celebrated her birthday this weekend and wanted to dine at the high-end (read: overpriced) diner. So, I walked into the joint with a smile and hopeful expectations. Unfortunately, mediocrity literally greeted me at the door.  I was the first to arrive, and was seated by a bored gentleman who felt no need to show me the drinks list or menu while I waited. Once the other girls arrived, we were taken care of by a rushed waitress who immediately offered the disclaimer 'I don't speak English.' Good thing we weren't tourists from Connecticut. While I am relatively bilingual, I do expect that wait staff and other service professionals should be able to address me in English. However this is a tired Quebec argument that I don't have the patience to discuss further. Our service was very slow, and our food was a 6.5 at most. While I understand that Greasy Spoon offers small portions, the resto should at least offer good food to compensate for its pricing. I ordered the salmon tartar and octopus salad, and both left me cold (and hungry). My overly spicy tartar was gone after two bites, and I was then left with a mound of tasteless potato chips- certainly not worth $14. My next course consisted of heavily oiled and mushy potatoes, topped with a few nibbles of rubbery octopus. Our dirty dishes (though not entirely empty- we left behind the revolting tater tots) sat at the table for quite a while before our waitress cleared them. She didn't offer us a second round of drinks or dessert, so we decided it was time to cut our losses and bounce. Much to our dismay, we were held hostage for another 20 minutes waiting for her to return with card machines. I was seriously contemplating a dine and dash, but a random staff member swooped in at the last second. What had become of our waitress? Frankly, we didn't care..."

Female bartender told me that wasn't enough food and I quickly got the impression I wasn't welcome here. Still can't figure out why? I'm a polite, well dressed, experienced diner who tips quite well. Rudeness is usually the result of two parties participation, but this experience still baffles me as to where this bartender's poor attitude came from. I came here expecting to spend a large amount of money on dinner, but was never given the chance. Very negative experience, only giving 1 star because it's required."

This said, every other element of the dinner was sheer horror. From the slimy Malpeque oysters on, the dinner lacked nuance, and failed to deliver vis-a-vis balanced flavors. The tater-tot based smoked meat poutine starter was soggy mess, with soggy old curds and smoked meat that simply tasted off. The sea-bass was overcooked, and drowning in a spice mixture that was appalling in its brunt. While the burger could have been great, the soggy lower bun mentioned by someone else was a deal-breaker. To add insult to injury, the place refused to make the half-baked cookie as they were too busy. Finally, and really cementing the fact that this place is caught in the suck, a gentleman who appears to be either the owner or manager spent the entire evening behind the bar, death-staring one table after the other. Very unwelcoming addition to a mediocre and over-priced meal. Avoid at all costs."

Only two beers on tap, but lots of cocktails. The salad I got was surprisingly fresh and modern (arugula, pickled zuchinni, fennel, poached egg), the burger looked decent but definitely overpriced at $19, and the poutine was better than most, albeit nontraditional."
/user_details?userid=NpIeOP9jaw6i7lqX8jg7YA,Derek L.,"Châteauguay, Canada",2 star rating,The food was ok but nothing special for the price. The ambiance was ok. The biggest beef (no pun intended) was the overpriced wine list. I mean $55 for Liberty School is just price gouging.

Then requested we vacate our table while were still finishing up our drinks, then they physically kicked us out because my friend who had been served foods he was allergic to was ""rude and had a bad attitude"". Last I checked this place was a restaurant not a bar, the manager and his partner were both physically and verbally threatening to us AND our wives. They should be ashamed and embarrassed."
