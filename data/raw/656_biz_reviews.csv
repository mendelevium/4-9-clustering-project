The festive / Christmas vibes were lovely and better yet was their offering. The cool thing about it is the imported pastas from Italy. I tried the cheese stuffed tortellinis and the spinach ricotta raviolis. Amazing! And not expensive at $5.99 each.I also picked up lunch while I was there. There weren't a lot of vegetarian options so I opted for the grilled vegetable, pesto and fior de latte mozzarella baguette. It's $9 and excellent! The fennel and celery salad was also refreshing.I will be back!"

The menu is good but note that it's not very vegetarian/vegan friendly. The space is big, there's a little market inside with lots of ready-to-eat stuff from their own kitchen and lots of import product, definitely worth a look before u head out. A little pricey but some items are worth it.The staff was friendly & quick. Service was great even though it was crowded and there was lots of groups.A lot of people ordered pizza and pasta. I went for the salmon & roasted veggies as it was the only gluten free friendly thing on the menu. Everything was good EXCEPT the tomato spaghetti that my vegetarian colleagues took were too small (pictured) They were still hungry afterwards, the poor souls."

We were able to make an online reservation the day before and the brunch menu has a nice variety of dishes. We ordered the smoked salmon eggs Benedict, the market breakfast and the French toast. Each dish was delicious and the portions were generous! The quality of the ingredients was what I liked most. They smoke and cure their own salmon (which can be purchased in their store), the salad had seasonal ingredients and was garnished with a very good quality olive oil. The French toast had fresh fruit and a generous portion of mascarpone. They also serve a great quality coffee with some beautiful foam art.Overall, a great brunch just a 10 minute walk from downtown with a calm atmosphere and easily reserved online."

Visually this Marché is vibrant and alluring. It was pretty late so we were able to sit anywhere. I loved everything about it. The little boutique within the Marché, one can seriously spend some money on condiments for the kitchen to decor for your condo. Yup, full of beautiful decorations and food. I ordered a Cappuccino with a lemon torte meringue topping. It was scrumptious. After we were done we did what friends do shopped within. I will definite come back to enjoy a meal. Also prepared meals for takeout."
/user_details?userid=a41IoxVZ05aGm8i1RtdTAA,Richard B.,"Grand Rapids, MI",5 star rating,I came in n because it was across the street from where I was staying. I couldn't order wine without food( license thing). Fois gras with pickled Jerusalem artichokes and cranberry preserves. Probably one of the best I've ever had. My palate is dancing!!!!
/user_details?userid=NDhDMKqSiBc0L06jKlFnmg,Nancy H.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"So, as a native Monrtealer, I've only recently begun to explore Griffintown which is a fairly new (and hip and trendy) area bordering St. Henri. This area used to be gritty and quasi-seedy, and industrial in various pockets, and it is SO interesting to see all these new, chic restaurants and clubs and bistros and eclectic shops pop up here on Rue Notre Dame and its cross-streets. I was blown away by Le Richmond when I visited. It's a large, cavernous space, beautifully apportioned, half devoted to a dine-in restaurant, and half devoted to a gourmet Italian market shop. I didn't dine in the restaurant (although I wanted to, it looked so amazing! Next time, for sure), but I browsed about the market area. It reminded me of Eataly in New York (although much smaller, but just as authentic and gourmet), with every kind of imported Italian food product you can imagine. I visited with my Italian cousin (who also happens to work in the food biz) and for him to say this place is legit, you know it must be. The pastas, the meats, the desserts, the sauces, the condiments, the antipasto, and oh so much more (check out the olive oils and vinegars! My favorites!). You can even browse this pretty market area (which is really more akin to a boutique), as you carry around your glass of wine (nothing like grocery shopping while drinking!). It really feels special here - because it is. I'm glad I don't live near here as I'd blow all my money on groceries here. It has an enticing allure, all these gourmet, specialty foods. I highly recommend shopping here if you need to make a special meal for a special somebody, or if you're having folks over for dinner or appetizers."
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Location: In Griffintown, a little off the beaten path. Street parking is available but I didn't check to see if it was metered since I walked from Lionel Groulx.The place: Great decor - very casual but classy, with big windows and wood floors. The goods: I went for a friend's baby shower so several entrées had already been ordered before everyone arrived. Everything was delicious, especially the flat bread! I went right before I went on vacation so can't remember what was on the menu besides the bread and those delicious rice balls. Service: Good. The restaurant let my friend decorate the space we were using, wait staff made sure we always had something to drink, and getting them to take the cake and cut pieces for everyone wasn't a problem at all. Price point: I can't speak to this since the hostess paid for everything."

/user_details?userid=yVSRXbYyl8O850AxEnEEGA,Earl D.,"Châteauguay, Canada",5 star rating,Great little spot attached to the Richmond it's a mix between a restaurant and a Marche quiet enough to sit and talk and enjoy an evening with friends . The food was excellent and the service was good although with only one waiter he had a hard time keeping up but it was a Tuesday night and perhaps a little busier then they expectedOur apéritifs  were excellent wine by the glass with supper was also very nice and the food will not disappoint you overall very good and reasonably priced
/user_details?userid=eses52EL9PM3Zr98zMpihA,Jad B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It is the best place to go for a coffee or grab a quick bit or even sit for a meal. They also have a wide variety of sandwiches, salades and yummy pastry.The industrial design gives an air of elegance to that Italian grocery store. Actually, when you enter the place, you do not get the feeling of entering a grocery store. It is a combination of restaurant, cafe trottoir italien and grocery. I went there on a Sunday afternoon for a coffee. The place is very nice and cozy. They have a wide variety of food products in their grocery section. Big variety of cheese, sausages, ham & meat. They also have a wine cellar. You can also find olive oil and tea. Most of their products are high end.I look forward to going again to Marche Italien le Richmond."
/user_details?userid=R4LMOs3T3IS-ceTQ-yOiRg,Maria A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"A very nice place where you can have an italian coffee, grab a bite and enjoy some design items. I went there today for an afternoon coffee and desert. End up buying some italian specialities like their famous italian sausage, pasta and their amazing pomodoro sauce. A nice variety of desert made by their chef pastry. At 5pm you can enjoy their 5 a 7. They also have a nice bar. I can recommend this place to take your mother, best friend and even your chum."

They have the best brunch, lunch and supper menu. The food is amazing and so tasty, they never disappoint. Service is good, staff is really friendly . Very reasonably priced. The best place for a quick bite with delicious italian food!!"
/user_details?userid=fmd85Ui7PgJ0naVgtyXyEw,Cubby R.,"Phoenix, AZ",1 star rating,"Arrived at 7:45 from my reservation I was seated promptly I was served water immediately and over 15 minutes nobody came over to ask me for a drink or if I was ready to order. I went up to the bar asked if he was the manager he said no I will be right with you and I said I've been waiting for over 15 minutes nobody has come by he says I am busy and I said well I can't keep waiting, any more that's ridiculous so I left, he did not seem to care. Ungrateful server!"

/user_details?userid=Ex-QoUxevVpBPsovXWb8cw,Naoufel T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I am not sure about this place. it Half market, half restaurant. The market got some cute items, not sure who would go there shopping though. The restaurant is nice, the decor has a trendy and modern look to it but they failed at insulating their windows. Bring a sweater or you are going to be wearing your coat if you sit next to the window. The service was very slow but the waitress was super nice. The food is overpriced and underwhelming. I think I just talked myself into never going back there."
/user_details?userid=bY3FFAvI-ZK03PtGEJghwQ,Karen Y.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"food arrived cold. was either cooked too early or reheated. Service has a lot to improve. Ladies: if you decide to wear heels when going to this place, I suggest you DON'T. Steel floor between the entrance to the second door in both the restaurant and the marche has small undetectable, movable holes and unless you've been to the place before your heel will most likely get stuck in it. My $1200 Louboutin did. Both feet. Such a deadly trap. One should always do some research before trying new restaurant nowadays. If the restaurant is often busy, no need to participate in the Mtl A Table."
/user_details?userid=w8SrcCOJ6gKzYPG708EG2A,Barbara C.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"You would expect a restaurant to maybe give a damn about what people think.  I sent an email to them, right after posting my review.  If you are interested in getting/keeping customers, you might consider replying to an email, with an explanation, and apology... anything.  Shows me you think a lot of yourselves, that you don't need to worry about an individual client.  Considering the restaurant was empty on a saturday night, I might reconsider that position."
/user_details?userid=mLmgtTwuryDjJAQrSZ_w5w,Karina W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The three of us came here for dinner on a Friday evening recently. It was quiet, unlike their sister restaurant Le Richmond which is just next door. Perhaps not many people know that in that fancy European delicatessen looking place sits a lovely, industrial chic Italian bistro with to-die-for lighting fixtures. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and honest. And then came the food. Oh how it was good and generous! My mushroom pizza was exquisite, while my friends' osso bucco was darn pretty to look at (in addition to being delicious). We also tried their gnocchi, which tasted nothing like supermarket gnocchi - a very good sign. Lastly, the cannoli tasted like it was individually made with love. All these at very reasonable prices. Definitely a keeper!"
/user_details?userid=sTLe5n9amgwNPBShhwuYgA,Amelia J.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"Lovely place, the lady at the cash helped me pick from the take out counter and gave me a tour of their terroir products. Hands down the best honey I've had (raw honey from Montreal). I frequently go grab takeout salads and lasagnas when I don't feel like cooking, tastes home made and always fresh."
/user_details?userid=YItDcd3bEJAKTnb-pTwduA,Neha T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I love it! Food is fresh and delicious- I've been several times and had an amazing lasagna, delicious salads and soup. The deserts are also great. And you can grab some gourmet groceries while at it!"
