Can't go wrong with that ""poulet braisé + attiéké + alloco"" combo. Chicken is savoury and never dry, plantain soft and sweet, hot pepper on the side. Everything tastes fresh and the portions are generous. They also have bissap and ginger juice which is great to sip on while you wait for your order. Definitely call in advance to shorten your wait time.  On the flip side, the service here is terrible. Waitress barely speaks, looks annoyed to be taking your order, owner comes out of the kitchen to side-eye you and tell you that you're not allowed to dine in, etc. Sadly, this is what I've grown used to when it comes to African-run businesses. Let's just say ""the customer is #1"" doesn't exactly apply back home. I think business owners should adapt to the culture and standards of the country in which they've settled. However this is a conversation beyond the scope of this yelp review.At the end of the day, that chicken is good enough for me to keep coming back despite the neglect!"

The menu is kinda small. No desserts or alcoholic drinks. It's really just the main meal and a side dish. Everything is cheap, nothing is more than 25$ a plate. I decided to get the 1/4 chicken with fries and my grandmother got the chicken skewer with fries. We also added a side order of banana plantain for 5$. My chicken was seasoned in a way that I didn't feel the burn coming until after I was done eating. It snuck up on me and my eyes wouldn't stop watering even after I had finished eating. It was still very good. I was really impressed with their fries surprisingly! They were really crisp and fresh. The banana plantain was also delicious. I wish I had had more room to eat them. Portions are a bit big so if you're a light eater get a plate to share. The food took a long time to arrive so make sure to plan accordingly. Don't show up ravenous expecting your meal to get there in 10 minutes. It took about 35-40 minutes to arrive. At the end of the meal the waitress told us that next time we should order in advance and they will call us when it's ready and we can show up. Not a horrible solution. Service is nonexistent though. The waitress only came by twice. To take our order and then to serve us our order. When you're done you ring the bell at the cash register and they make you pay. At least she was nice. The restaurant itself is small but not crowded. They are all medium high chairs which isn't the most comfortable but manageable. Next time we plan on picking a table with chairs that aren't high (there's only one). They don't play any music so it can get quite quiet. We were there with 3 other parties but halfway through the meal we were done to one party and us. You could really feel the emptiness. No one else came to eat so it was just us till the end. It's worth a try if you're in the neighbourhood and feel like a little something different."
