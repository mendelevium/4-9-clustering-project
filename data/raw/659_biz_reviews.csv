The food was awesome and delicious. We had a table d'hôte with 5 services. The appetizer consisted of small bites of different meat such as deer tartare. It was very fresh. As a meal, the salmon and the octopus were great and very tender. For the dessert, I had a chocolate mousse/pudding? Wasn't very impressed as it wasn't something extraordinary but it was still delicious. As for the service, it was quick to get our food even though we were a group of 10 and the staff is very friendly. Maybe next time I would prefer to sit outside in the dining room as it can be very noisy inside the kitchen. Overall, the food is excellent and the experience was awesome. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone."

Their menu changes from time to time, but I heard that it's always delish. When I went every dish was exceptional in terms of taste. Yes, it's quite pricey. But if you're looking for fantastic tapas and a good selection of interesting wines and willing to splurge, this is the place to go. Oh and great staff!! They know their menu very well and are friendly."

Nice space, good 1st impression :) the staff is super nice and helpful. The waiter was very god with the wine list. We chose a nice natural wine from the South of France and it was great!The food was over all quite good. We had the:-oysters, -garlic bourgot snail with a velouté,-chopped liver, -grilled octopus, -poached cod, -pan-seared foie gras with maple, -deer steak -yogurt panna cotta. I liked everything except for the poached cod that was very bland and the parsnip slices in the dish were too crunchy compared to the cod's texture so they didn't compliment each other very well. Recommended! Try some of the natural wine from their private imports, very good!"
/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Pastaga has been on my list of restaurants to try for years now so I was excited to finally go. My boyfriend and I went Saturday night to try the MTL a Table menu ($31). Just so you know. they only had the MTL a table menu and you couldn't order stuff from the regular menu.For starters my boyfriend had the squash creamy soup with smoked ricotta, squash seeds and hazelnut butter. The soup was thick and delicious. It was a bit sweet but in a good way and I liked that there was cheese in it. I, on the other hand, had the roasted cauliflower with vadouvan yogourt, cajun almonds and mint. This dish was better than I expected. It tasted a bit like curry and there was a lot of cauliflower. Out of the two starters, I preferred the cauliflower. For mains, my boyfriend and I shared the mushrooms risotto and the pork belly. It was better that way because the risotto dish was huge and the pork belly was small. The pork belly was an extra $3. The pickled eggplant really added to the dish. Out of the two mains, the pork belly was my favorite however, the starters were better than the mains. Some bites of the risotto felt a little bit undercooked for our liking.  It lacked consistency. The desserts were very good! My boyfriend had the pistachio ice cream with nuts and chocolate syrup. Can't go wrong with pistachio ice cream. I had the chocolate mousse with sponge toffee and caramel foam. The latter tasted like a crunchie chocolate bar which happens to be my favorite chocolate bar. The service was very good. We ordered a bottle of wine that the waiter recommended for us. I liked the wine but my boyfriend didn't like it right away but it did grow on him as the meal went on and the wine aerated. The waiter felt bad and thought we really didn't like the wine so he brought us over two black Russians. That was really thoughtful. We ended up buying a round of tequila shots and did them with our waiter."

We had a large table set up (for 20) in the front of the room, and were extremely excited to dine here.Went downhill from there. It seemed as though they were unprepared to serve a group that large. It took about an hour for them to take our orders (3 course meal) after I repeatedly asked the waitstaff to begin taking orders. They were too busy trying to up sell our group. At one point, what looked like the manager, placed four random wine bottles on our tables to ""look at."" This wasAfter drinks were already ordered, but still no food order in. Dinner took about three and a half hours and the courses were very small, so you can imagine after three hours we were still hungry. No way we were ordering more though because might've taken additional two hours. I've been at seven to eleven course restaurants that have taken less time. Food was solid but not good enough to make me forget how awful the service was. If I was going back to Montreal with a group, I would definitely not go back to Pastaga."

We had a private table set up in the kitchen, which was very cool.We had a seven course tasting menu and the food itself was good.But the service at the restaurant was disastrous. It took the kitchen 1 hour and 45 minutes to serve the first two courses, which consisted of nothing more than a single oyster and a cracker with caviar. Almost two hours for a single oyster!When I complained to the manager, he tried to blame us for not having allocated enough time to complete the menu. Never mind the pace we were on would have had it taking over 7 hours to complete.Absolutely ridiculous. Montreal is a great city for food, so I recommend skipping this place and going somewhere where the service is friendly and professional."

/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Location: On the main, close to the Little Italy 'border.' I don't think there's a subway stop close enough to walk from, but street parking is available. On weekends, the meters stop running at 6pm and if you arrive before 6, you should be able to find decent parking. I think the 55 bus runs all the way up as well. The place: Though the space is not huge by any means, it offers up a great layout with minimal decor and great lighting. It has a very 'clean' feel to it and is what I would consider very urban. I really like the space, as well as the great art work that adorns its walls. The food: This was my first stop on my MTL à Table extravaganza, and I was really eager to eat my way through Pastaga's menu! I started with the cream of butternut squash velouté with brown butter and ricotta ravioli. Considering I'd been out and about in the cold all day, soup was exactly what I needed to warm me up. It was delicious and you could really taste the nuttiness of the squash. The roasted pumpkin seeds added wonderful flavour to the soup, and the ravioli were both fresh and delicious. I couldn't really taste the ricotta, but truth be told, ricotta isn't bursting with flavour to begin with. In any case, I love this soup and would like to ask Martin Juneau to bottle it for me!My main was the gorgeous grilled white tuna on a fried tortilla, accompanied by herb mayonnaise and a bouquet of veggies. I *think* the veggies included fennel but I'm not 100% certain. Either way, this dish was fantastic. The tuna was perfect, the tortilla wasn't oil or greasy at all, and the vegetables were fresh and crisp. After overindulging at Bremner on Friday, this was exactly what I needed to balance out the gluttony. I really loved this dish. My friend ordered the maple-lacquered pork belly with carrot pancake, which is Postage's signature dish, and she loved it. There was total silence while we ate our main dishes - I mean hello, there can be no interruptions when food is this good!For dessert, we both ordered the chocolate and sponge toffee pot de crème. I honestly don't know which is better Chuck Hughe's pot or Martin Juneau's. I shed a few more tears as I enjoyed Pastaga's pot - it was divine!Service: Very good. The wait staff was friendly even though they were very busy, our water was constantly refilled, our table was cleared after every dish, and our regular waiter took the time to explain the menu to us in detail. Price point: $29 for three courses during MTL à Table. You can't ask for better than that! I will definitely go back!The only thing I found odd was that they only had French menus. Now, on my end, it's fine because I'm French. However, my American friend doesn't read French so she had to rely on me and the waiter to explain each dish to her. No big deal, but strange nonetheless. That said, I haven't seen their regular menu so can't say if it's bilingual or not. I would imagine that it probably is."

As one cannot have foie gras every meal.Service was pleasant and accommodating. Menu is in French only but our waiter was really patient and answered all my questions with a smile. The menu is seasonal and changes frequently, but all you need to know is everything here is fresh, well prepared and delicious. Quiche au chorizo et fenouil caramélisés, fromage frais et salade verte ($14.50)Croquettes de Porcelet ($14.50)Gaufres natures, crème chantilly et sirop d'érable ($7)I just love the casual and unpretentious vibe of Pastaga.

In place, you'll discover an inspired selection of dishes with a distinctly Quebecois flavour. With original and tasty food, a warm relaxed vibe and impeccable service, Pastaga raised the bar on all fronts and left me with a great impression.We had a selection of tapas including Salmon & potato salad, Shrimp ceviche, Lacquered pork belly, chopped liver, black inked squid, and deer tartare, as well as 2 delicious deserts.

Sort of overrated food, not sure what all the hype is about.We ordered:Shrimp salad on a baguette: great texture but lacked flavor, needed a lemon zest and some sea salt of some sort, a garnish would've been nice.Fried cauliflower with watercress ( I think), crushed almonds and various Indian spices. Best dish of the four ordered, really enjoyed how all the ingredients complimented one another especially the mint.Pork Belly, carrots and pancake: most disappointing dish, pork belly was well prepared but the carrot purée pancake was just awkward. I think I would've just preferred it being purée versus pancake form.Venison, beets, crushed pistachios and apple infused sauce:The venison was delicious so were the beets, the crushed pistachios were a nice touch. However, the apples made the dish too sweet.Can't say I'd come back for dinner...maybe just for wine."

We were seated close to another couple which gave us an opportunity to eye our neighbors tasty plates. Portion size looked small but let me tell you it fit just right in my tummy. I started of with oysters and we a shared grilled  octopus. Appetizers were outstanding! Oysters fresh and tasted like from the sea and octopus had that nice char... And really tender! My main meal was the porcelet and pancake - flavors were amazying, I can see why it's their classic dish. Lastly desert was the tarte au pomme -   Omg I was in food heaven. The buttery dough paired with the icecream, nuts and Carmel sauce just made my mouth water. Give this place a try guys, it's a great place to eat well and for me it's worth to spend money on great food & service. Reasonably priced also."

/user_details?userid=2T7IWnZjZcifxS305CprUQ,Sophie G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Pastaga! It's been on my to-go list forever, and I'm very glad I finally got to try it out. I went for lunch, which is offered only once a week on Fridays.TriedAppetizerChopped liver à la mousse d'onion, chips de bagel + onions marinés (+3)""Tataki"" de saumon de l'Atlantique, rattes crémeuses + salmon jerky râpé (+4)MainPieuvre grillée à l'encre de seiche, gâteau de pdt + rouille safranée (17)Tortellini de ris de veau (18)Onward to each dish, which were beautifully plated.The chopped liver was the best part of the meal for me, as the different tastes came together oh-so-perfectly onto one bite of the bagel. The liver, served in a mousse, came in a generous portion surrounded with a selection of greens mixed in with the marinated onions. Simply divine.The salmon came in big sashimi slices, covered with a creamy potato salad. I was looking forward to the salmon jerky bits, but they were sprinkled very thinly, used more as seasoning than actual part of the dish. This was very good, without much new.The mains were disappointing in comparison to the appetizers. The grilled octopus dish lacked cohesion; the octopus didn't go particularly well with the potato cake or the rouille. The ink-like sauce was a dark black like I've never seen before, but it lacked flavour to complement the dish.The tortellini filling is one of their in-house special (ris de veau seems to pop-up now and then on their menu) and was very good. Too much pasta to filling ratio to my liking. The little mushrooms didn't do much for me in terms of sides.Overall, as they change their menu frequently, I would definitely see myself coming back to sample other items. One downside of the meal was the pervasive use of potatoes, which I am not a big fan of."

Certainly not the best we've had.The staff was great, but seating was a bit awkward.We've been looking forward to trying out Pastaga for a long time, but it was hard to enjoy the whole experience after those shrimps."
/user_details?userid=-KpEgEen1tj-jdjIS7uVOw,Isabelle R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I went to Pastaga for their weekend brunch. It was all quite good. The waiter brought us delicious butter/white chocolate cookies as an appetizer bite. They were fantastic. The drinks were very average. The baked beans in my ""ham and beans"" dish were good but the ham was very dry and bland and this is where I remove a star. My dining partners had the pulled pork benny which was very tasty, and the mushrooms on toast which was also quite good. The presentations were all very pretty. I asked the waiter how big the side of chopped liver (6$) was and he said small so we ordered 2, turns out they were pretty big and could've easily shared it since it was only a side. It was served on toast, covered in pickled onions and was quite good. The service was ok. I will come again and give it a shot for dinner. Oh- and decor and atmosphere is fantastic."

Pastaga sits alongside 3 contemporary art galleries and the newly renovated Vices et Versa in the formerly wasteland stretch of the Main above the underpass and before Little Italy. Two pages of all natural wines are just the beginning, I love the staff, the sweet and savoury menus, the big chef's table in the back for eating exceptional food while watching the Habs - the whole spirit of the place is chaleureux, classy but friendly, and I can't wait to go back."
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Over a year ago now, I visited Pastaga for a Sunday brunch and left with the strong feeling of needing to return for dinner. It took way too long but through Taste MTL, I finally did. For the uninitiated, Pastaga is the brainchild of chef Martin Juneau who, since opening this restaurant in 2012, has opened up Pub St-Joseph as well as the Mr. Crémieux food truck. Pastaga is a ode of nature wines as well as great food to pair with those wines. The food definitely has French influences at its core but branches out extensively in other food genres.  Located on the relatively barren strip of St-Laurent just before little Italy but after Mile End, the restaurant is a small, simple space with mirror walls, misshapen wooden tables and ample lighting via power bars on the ceiling. The real beautiful touch is the bright red tilted kitchen that is visible in the back of the space. A glass wall blocks out the sound from the dining room but we can see everything going on. There is also a large table located in the kitchen for larger groups to enjoy if you can get it. Overall, it is a very cozy and comfortable environment to enjoy a meal in.I visited during Taste MTL where they were offering a 39$ menu of items off their current seasonal menu. Me and my dining companions ordered all of the options to try. First up, there was grilled Albacore tuna with braised fennel and citrus gel. The tuna was grilled to perfection. The braised fennel and the citrus were perfect compliments to the fish. A very nice start to the meal. Next up was marinated salmon with salmon jerky and a creamy potato salad. The salmon was, like the tuna, cooked perfectly. The potato salad was, as indicated, quite creamy with a strong hint of dill which paired very nicely with the salmon - bringing to mind a classic smoked salmon dish in terms of taste.The third main was a play on Jewish chopped liver with bagel chips, capers and hard boiled eggs. Now, I have never been a big fan of chopped liver. Despite my enjoyment of foie gras, the texture of Jewish-style chopped liver always created a roadblock for me. I went in with some apprehension but came out loving it. The texture of the liver was not an issue and had that great fatty flavour. The pickled onions brought some sweetness to that dish. The hard boiled egg was perfect and the bagel chips added that little bit of crunch and saltiness. A very well executed dish.The final main was, to me, the best thing we had all night - maple lacquered pork on a pancake with a parsnip salad. The pork and pancake combination was brillant - the right mix of sweetness, fattiness and starch. The pork, in particular, just fell apart without any effort. Great texture achieved by the kitchen staff there. The salad of parsnip added a little crispness and freshness so you felt a little better health-wise about eating pork, maple syrup and pancakes for dinner!For dessert, there were 2 options plus a cheese plate. The cheese plate was a goat cheese with candied nuts, apple butter and a mini cake loaf. The goat cheese (I forgot the name of it sadly) was quite good - soft but still firm enough to handle properly. The other 3 elements of the plate allowed you to add different levels of sweetness to pair with the cheese - the apple butter was a particularly wonderful surprise in terms of its strong flavour and consistency. In terms of desserts proper, we had the choice of a Mr. Crémeux Sundae with milk crumble and sous-vide Prunes or a raspberry cheesecake. The sundae was delicious. Anyone who visited the Mr. Crémeux food truck over the summer knows that Chef Juneau and company know how to make a great soft serve vanilla ice cream. The addition of sous-vide prunes provided some tartness and the crumble was nice and crunchy. The cheesecake was good as well - the texture was spot-on and the coulis was nice as well. Dinner at Pastaga met all of my expectations and more. Our waiter provided great service especially in terms of the wine pairings for each dish. You could tell he knew his wine list well. The food was wonderful across the board and the dining room itself relaxed and quiet enough to allow good conversation. This meal reinforced the notion that I waited way too long to stop by for dinner. I will definitely not make that mistake again... and I hope you don't either.Cheers!"

The atmosphere was laid-back and nice, with a relatively comfortable distance between tables. The salmon appetizer was super fresh and interesting, but everything else we had was just a tad disappointing. It's been my personal mission to try risotto everywhere that I can, and am sad to say that it wasn't great here. It was overcooked, and did not taste tongue-burningly-hot as it should if it was made fresh just for me. We also had the dessert (chocolate mousse), which was almost great except the ""sponge taffy"" was essentially chunks of brown sugar and unappealing after the initial sugar rush wore off. Unfortunately, while the price point was just right for restaurant week, I don't think most of the things we ordered would feel ""worth"" their prices on the regular menu and we're unlikely to go back."

We went just after Xmas in 2012 and it's now August 2013. I know I had espresso and then another espresso, so the espresso muct have at least been passable. It was brutally cold out so I can say the heat works. And I went to the bathroom, so they have bathrooms. Oh we got breakfast there. I didn't even realize it was primarily an evening kinda place. How about that. Anyway, I don't remember what I got but I seem to remember it being good. D got some sort of eggs benedict concoction and it was good. I think it may have had salmon in it. I know it was tasty and at the end, there was no food left. The guy we met there also ate all his food. There's something to be said about that. So...heat, working bathrooms, good espresso, and food which will cause you to clean your plate. Sounds good to me. I say give it a shot and see what you think."

I love it. I do believe that the city's nightlife scene could use the same kind of facelift...Today, I'm raving about Pastaga - a new restaurant that opened just a couple months ago on St-Laurent Boulevard below Little Italy. Don't be fooled - it's not Italian. ""Pastaga"" is actually another name for Pastis, the French anise-flavored alcohol enjoyed as an apéritif. Accordingly, restaurant puts a modern twist on French-bistro cuisine and décor. What's the deal? Small plates (2-3/person for a full meal) and a focus on biodynamic wine (without headache-prompting tannins). A chill, unpretentious atmosphere. Delicious food delivered by fun waiters. A table in the kitchen that invites diners to watch ""the game"", all while keeping the dinner crowd happy and unaware of the TV. And Twin Shadow as background music? Pastaga definitely wins when it comes to first impressions.First, my friend and I tried the crispy yellow pike with pumpkin purée and rapini salad. Delightful. The fish was delicate, flaky, and cooked to the perfect point. The pumpkin purée and the rapini added some sweet-smooth and bitter-crunchy flavour and texture.Next, we had the waffle with sautéed wild mushrooms, greens, and slivers of Parmesan. Again, yum! It's nouveau - mother country gone new world, shall we say - and it works.Our third dish was the bison - a mini steak atop pulled meat, shredded parsnips and a slightly BBQ'd-style sauce. Another hit. Especially the pulled bison. For me it was a first, and certainly not a last.Finally, have you heard of their piglet belly lacquered with brown sugar placed atop a parsnip pancake? If not, be forewarned. This won't stay a secret for long. It was insane! Divine. It melted in my mouth. And with that pancake? Whoa boy. Whoaaaaa boy.Just in case Pastaga hadn't wowed us enough already, the restaurant seriously ""brought it"" with dessert. Per the waiter's suggestion, we ordered the little begnets (mini donut ""balls"") filled with apple sauce accompanied by two oval ""scoops"" of vanilla ice-cream, little dollops of caramel cream, baked apple ""chips"", pieces of sautéed apple and apple butter. Again, amazing. And a portion big enough for two.Pastaga has been getting some well-deserved buzz lately, and you definitely want in on the action. Book ahead and don't tell your friends.

They were both to die for. My partner had the salmon dish as a starter and I wanted to steal it from him. I can't remember what he ordered for the main (check Tripadvisor as he does not Yelp - sorry!).  The service was impeccable and the snow outside glittered as if it was lit by tiny little fiber-optic lights (or diamonds if you want to go that direction). That being said, I cannot promise you will be there when everyone else cancels their reservations and the snow sparkles as if lit from within. What I can say is that the food is worth the reservation, even without the delightful company I enjoyed.If this is what Quebec is to food, then Quebec deserves to be on the food map as much as New York and Paris do.Surprisingly, the prices weren't even as steep as one would expect in the U.S. for food of this quality. Amazing."

/user_details?userid=NJRkUXSwfC9Fp86Fu4wFpA,Will T.,"Northampton, MA",5 star rating,One of the best hidden gems of Montreal. A little off the beaten path but only a short cab ride from the plateau. One of the best food experiences in years.

We each ordered 2 tasting dishes: pan-seared scallops, melt in your mouth pork belly, sturgeon,salmon, vennison & Bavarois with goat cheese.  I list them because each was a superb blend of delicate flavours, beautifully presented. Our Server was fantastic in guiding our choices and in pairing the perfect wine. Totally delectable! Fantastic service in a warm yet modern and lively, (but not too noisy)  environment. Superb! Can't wait to try their brunch!! Pastaga is a must."

Excellent service, great wine, and some of the most delicious food I've ever eaten!! A lot of attention to detail. Seriously, it made me understand why so many of my friends are obsessed with dating chefs. We ordered oysters, salmon, duck, & pork. The portions are small so you get a good variety (they recommend ordering two each). Great music was playing, too."
/user_details?userid=uIB8qFzG5E3PUGfiCiUmqg,Steve K.,"Flower Mound, TX",5 star rating,"Pastaga is a great place for top-notch chef-quality food. The space is small-ish, but comfortable and bright, with an open kitchen for watching the magic happen. The staff on my recent visit were helpful, knowledgeable, and efficient, but never intrusive. They have a nice wine selection and fantastic cheeses, but the food is the star here, and it shines brightlyHighly recommended"

It's hard to even pick the highlights of our meal at Pastaga, because each dish was so interesting and enjoyable.... And the wine - we asked for a recommendation of a medium-bodied red on the lower half of the price range. The sommelier brought us a wine that fit the bill but was so much more as well, and presented it to us in a friendly and unpretentious manner. The whole staff was friendly and unpretentious, for that matter, switching effortlessly to English since some in our party were less than comfortable in French. The dining areas were intimate and convivial, but spacious enough that you felt that your table had its own space. I suppose that the only advice I'd include for those with larger appetites is that the plates are all delectable, small plates - even light eaters should plan to order 2 per person. But enjoy... since the carte is fairly small, I am sure that the chef must change it fairly regularly, which in my opinion means that there will be new delights in store!"

We were 8 adults and 5 kids.  Pretty quiet morning, only two other small groups in the restaurant. So when we walked in we asked for a high chair, which totally confused the waitress. She said she would check but never came back with a response so we asked again and this time she turned to her colleague who nodded his head in acknowledgement but also never came back. Nothing wrong if the don't have a high chair, but at least come back to paying customer to tell them. We went on to order, and chef was not willing to go slightly off menu to accommodate kids. We asked for eggs and bacon an they didn't want to do it. Fine , we thought maybe they were not serving bacon that day. We were pretty insulted when they brought the sandwich de flanc de porc fumee avec ouef frit, that my brother ordered and its turned out to be bacon and eggs in a bun. My sister inlaw suffers from celiac which is a severe intolerance to glutin. So she asked if she could order the eggs Benedict but just the eggs and no English muffin. Waitress went to ask chef and we could see because its an open kitchen the chef furious and did not want to accommodate. So another waiter comes out to make a recommendation, a fish dish on the menu that he said would be good for her. When they deliver the meal, my sister in law realizes that there is fried potatoes. So she asked if the potatoes were cooked in a separate pan from the rest of the fried food that contains glutin and the waitress said no. Even the smallest amount of glutin can hospitalize my sister inlaw. Btw, most chefs know that. So needless to say she did not eat, only I have waitress then say ok we can make you whatever you want. We went to this place because of the good reviews but we have never have been treated like beggars off the street like this. Good was ok, but these foodie chefs have to remember that a restaurant is a business and dining is an experience. Felt shitty leaving them $300 for that."
