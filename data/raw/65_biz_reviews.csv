If you love lamb, you'll definitely want to visit. Our host, Lorenzo, was exceptionally welcoming and friendly. Our server, Enzo, provided excellent service and was very pleasant. Not only did we have a great meal, but the live music was the icing on the cake. A memorable evening for sure  in Old Montreal. Thank you Lorenzo and staff!Tammy & Chris"

Compared to weird pesudo-modern french restaurants in the surrounding venues, this place has a more traditional taste.I do hope that it was slightly brighter in the interior.My star rating is for balance between the taste and the price. It is high end, but it is more then I thought would fit."
/user_details?userid=U95wccXN_J8JwA5Ktlu8tw,Amber H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Happening gourmand After having a great experience at Maggie oakes with this event we decided to invite our friends out to let them join in on the experience. Booked a table for 6 on Friday night at 6:30. Location is right on the corner you can't miss it you will hear the jazz from outside and see all the amber coloured tea lights on the tables through the window.Southern mule was one drink they had for the event gave it a go it was good just sweet. Same for the old fashion because of the honey they put in it. The olives in the martini were good and the cosmos were nice. Unfortunately they had no Jamieson maybe next time.I started with the foie gras which was delicious but the plating looked like nothing pretty awful to be honest. They could of added some fleur de sel or more chutney or something. The gravlax was good very flavourful but since 3 people ordered it at my table everyone's looked different and  that's not acceptable.Got the salmon which in my mind I pictured it another way but got something different. It was delicious I enjoyed every bite but again the way the described it was not what I got.Onion soup was good but it was +9The osso bucco tasted nice with the Risotto but one was cooked perfectly and than another plate had it not cooked properly. The plates didn't match again which is weird one had one big pieced and than someone had 3 little pieces.The crusted lamb was very good it came was potato's and veggies and a whole circle of goat cheese. This was +18Desserts were the lemon tart and brownie with caramel.Both were good but I prefered the lemon as it was refreshing after my meal.Service was good waiter was nice.

This is a popular staple in Old Montreal.The atmosphere was great and this place hadn't changed that much since I used to come here once in awhile during my university days.The service was great and punctual which was not as obvious on a heavily crowded night. Definately you will need to reserve  for dinners during the weekends.Unlike some of the restaurants in the area, their bilingual  menu was simple, a one page notice.One thing though which I forgot when you have live music it's a little difficult to talk to each other.Like all things though street parking is difficult. On this night rue St Paul was being repaired however there are two public parking nearby $$$."

/user_details?userid=c2Sv-_IJn8mK-f0QGZdReg,Todd C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Let me preface this review by saying Modavie is a 4.5 star in my book, I rounded down to differentiate with the true 5 star places I frequent.This was my third visit and was probably my best experience to date. We sat upstairs at a fantastic table for two by the windows as a heavy snowfall blanketed the port. The holiday lights on St. Paul were still on and the view was like something out of a Christmas movie. The live jazz set the mood for a nice dinner to follow.The wine list is packed with budget friendly and wisely chosen selections. We opted for an interesting sparkling wine from the Loire Valley made from Chenin  Blanc. I tried the French Onion soup that was well executed with a rich broth while my wife tried the Tomato Soup. Both were excellent. Mains included Cassolettes and Salmon. Both dishes were good although my Cassolettes was a little soupy by my standards. Total tab with tax and tip was $225..Service was excellent and friendly!"
/user_details?userid=Wl1dBsP9cShaPQOMwGhM_Q,Jesse M.,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",4 star rating,"This place is a gem. We where looking for a place with great atmosphere, romantic, with music and great food. This is it. First of all in old Montreal so the mood is set already. The service was amazing, they make you feel welcome from the start, when you make a reservation it's only a 5 min wait for them to get you to your table. Make sure you put in your notes of reservation that you want to be near the music if that's what you want. The waiters are very attentive and don't bother youI once read a review complaining about their calamari. I'm a huge calamari advocate so I challenged that review and ordered it myself. The person who said they didn't like it because it wasn't very crispy obviously doesn't know food. It's calamari , not greasy fried onion rings. The calamari was Devine. Absolutely wonderful, perfect texture, taste, and crisp. They also provide free bread and butter.We ordered wine from their extensive wine list, very good selection, my ordered a Pinot noir to park with her dish , and so did I. We ordered lamb rack, and lamb chops. They specialize in lamb. They did not disappoint, lamb usually is pungent, but they made it so good, it did not over power at all, excellent cooking. Overall a great experience. Doesn't break that bank, and competes or beats other romantic places that break the bank. Overall score: 8.8 out of 10Vibes: 9Food: 8Service: 9.2"

It was a great companion for the then chilly weather.I savored that dish similarly as one reads a good book: I did not want it to end. Later that night, surrounded by the jazziest voices and bass solos, a lamb rack landed on my table with a limelight. Of course, I shared that masterpiece with the other ravenous people at the table who could not stop gazing at me and the dish. If I could, I would share it with every reader because that rack was prepared with love and virtue. I understand why its smell could make any person morph into a hungry tiger. The gentleman who was our server and sommelier made the experience sweeter and so comfortable. I really do not remember what wine we ordered but it was good. Top choice for hospitality.This is one of the places I am longing to return. A bit pricey, but it is totally worth it."
/user_details?userid=Y5ILp4yzjuQBcijChEksgw,Michelle M.,"North York, Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"My choice in main dish was disappointing, which is the only reason behind the star deduction. Other than that, it was a nice and pleasant experience and would visit again (to try something different).I personally had the French onion soup (starter size) which is probably the best I've ever had. Between the group, we shared the calamari and charcuterie board. I thought the cheese and meat were oddly cut.The Mediterranean penne was appealing for that few seconds when the server showed someone at our table what it looked like. I'll admit I didn't read the ingredients on the menu and was expecting some pesto type of dish. I was wrong. It was on the bland side but I got some flavours from the tomatoes and cheese. It was a good portion and the penne was cooked to my liking but I will not order this for myself in the future."
/user_details?userid=c_ppawQYg_bXodROGWQlyQ,Kimberly N.,"Reno, NV",5 star rating,"When I asked our walking tour guide where we should go for live jazz, she didn't hesitate when naming Modavie as the place to go. We are really glad we went - it was the perfect place for our last night of our Montreal anniversary trip!I was pleased when we were seated fairly close to the musicians who happened to be on break when we arrived. Our waiter was super charming - he came here from Paris because he likes the cold weather and to drive a dog sled team. He gets extra points for the very generous wine pour! My husband is a creature of habit and ordered the Mediterranean Penne for his main. He is not one to praise food (""food is fuel"") so when he openly liked his dish, I knew it had to be good! From what I tasted, it had just the right amount of seasoning and was delicious. When I saw Niçoise Salad on the menu (yellowfin tataki tuna encrusted in sesame seeds, tomatoes, green beans, olives, potatoes, anchovies and hard-boiled egg), I knew that was what I wanted. It was gorgeous when it arrived, so fresh and delicious. In a word, perfect. The music started about 1/2 way through our meal and provided a beautiful and light ambiance. The trio that performed sounded very much as though they were influenced by Vince Guaraldi. We enjoyed them very much.If I am lucky enough to go to Montreal again in the future, I know I will stop by here again!"
/user_details?userid=DahNPktmkpkS8sP8c4Pohw,Nathan D.,"Evanston, IL",5 star rating,"VIBES | Versatile | JazzVIBES: The Resturant has three vibes. An open area in front of the live music, a private back area, and back bar vibe. The place is in the heart of old town the interior shows that. Exposed brick and wood, give the place a warm feel. Versatile: they have a massive menu with a good combination of hearty American meals, French classics, and semi-soul food which was pretty impressive. Everything was really good. We were in a group of 6 people and we spanned their whole range of food and everyone was impressed. Jazz: so I'm the evenings they have a live soul/jazz music. We a trio (drums, lead guitar, and bass guitar) where the lead singer was also the drummer. Which was So intriguing and have the band a unique feel. They played Stevie, MichaelJackson, Clapton, and Earth Wind and Fire. What was impressive though was that it wasn't too loud. We were literally 2 tables away from the band and we could still hold a conversation. Pro tip: be ready to offer request. The band we had took request from the audience and played somePretty amazing jazz/soul versions of covers from the 70s, 80s, and 90s. Pro tip: I had the chicken, it was tender, juicy, and the combination with the vegetables was really good. I would definitely recommend it."

/user_details?userid=LA4DxijAdk04kf24k0_7fg,Glenn Elise P.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"Had a great experience catching a seat at the bar recently. I came here for mussels and fries (moules frites) and maybe a small glass of wine to end my night in Montreal but stayed for the amazingly welcoming bartender Vincent. He made my night with his humor and recommendations making me feel comfortable and at home eating and drinking in the early evening. He also anticipated needs, refilling my water before being asked, worrying that maybe I was in a hurry to go somewhere when I checked my watch and even checking up on my entree before I really cared about it (i had been happily enjoying my rosé and the surroundings). The musician was nice that night (Friday night) too and had a great personality and singing voice.The moules frites were super tasty, I had the option to have ketchup or mayo as a side (with a recommendation from the bartender to go with mayo as I know the belgians do) and fries or salad or fries and salad and I went with the fries and salad option. It was wayy too much food (maybe shouldn't have eaten the bread that Vincent put in front of me as I waited for food) but honestly the whole experience was perfect. The bread was great with the white wine cream sauce that came with the mussels although I'm not sure you will always get it so make sure to ask for it if possible!Also if you get Vincent at the bar ask for a recommendation, I ended up with this wonderful lavender lemonade as a result."

It's elegant without being pretentious. The lights are dim, giving it a romantic feel. There was also a live band playing when we were there (Saturday night). Absolutely great atmosphere but difficult to talk after the band starts up.FOOD: 3/5French Onion Soup: I didn't like the soup but I really think it's personal taste.Foie Gras: This foie gras was different than the ones I've tried previously. I really don't have enough experience or knowledge to comment but this one was too heavy for me. The cranberries on the side cut through the heaviness.Lamb Chops: MUST TRY. The lamb here was great quality with no gamey taste. The vegetables accompanying were a nice touch - so you're not just chewing on meat the entire meal.SERVICE: 3/5Service was okay. The staff who seated us was wonderful but the server who waited on us was a little grumpy like he didn't want to be at work. Food and bill came out quick."

/user_details?userid=ooHF-vRzlkyN9UEVMKocAQ,Mercedes C.,"Bronx, NY",3 star rating,"You could hear some sort of thump even from a couple doors down as you're parking. Then Jazz hits you! From where we sat for dinner on their main floor you can hear the Music. But if you want to soak up Jazz- front and center, request upstairs seating. Modavie is an excellent combination of atmosphere, setting and music- surrounded by 'Moulin Rougesque' posters, Brick, wood galore and copper ceiling pipes. Friendly service from our server Caroline and juggled orders like you don't even know! Our cocktails were inventive but were o......k.  Our Escargots In Puff Pastry was a winner and could've eaten 3 of those by myself! Hubby's Seafood Risotto was disappointingly mushy and tasted more like the incorrect rice-to-water ratio was used and ended up being sticky (°_°).Salmon with a Tapenade was excellent with Veggies and Couscous in my dish had awesome Curry, Herbs and Cranberry ingredients but it was scooped in a glob and was mushy too. (Maybe Grains aren't their strongest suit). In all honesty, hubby and I had a nice time. Modavie isn't probably near at the top of my list for Food in Montréal- but not ruling it out so fast either (for the live Jazz)."

The restaurant was completely full when we arrived during peak dinner hours. The environment was comfortable and there was live music when we came. It is nice place for a relaxing meal. Service:The food took a while to come but that was fine since we were enjoying the music while waiting. Our server was friendly and welcoming. However, he didn't check up on us often and we had to wave him down several times whenever we needed something.Food:We ordered a variety of items to share and the food was good overall. I liked the appetizers more than the mains. The foie gras was rich and creamy. It was absolutely amazing and it was my favorite item. The beef tartare was nice as well. Our least favorite item was probably the steak. We thought the steak was a bit bland and underwhelming. Overall:We enjoyed our meal here although the service could have been better.

I really want to give it a better score because the experience was really good however, the taste of the food was a bit disappointing. From start to finish, the service and ambience was fantastic. Our server was very friendly and efficient. We loved the live music and got a great table right in front of the band.  As for food, I ordered the beet salad, French onion soup and shrimp risotto.  Loved the salad and soup, it's one of the better French onion soup I had.  It was a great start to my meal but I guess all good things do come to an end because the risotto was a complete miss.  For $29, I can barely find the shrimps and worst of all, there were some really grainy uncooked rice.  I'm not a risotto expert but the risottos I've enjoyed in the past was a lot softer and saucier. This dish was just dry and undercooked. After a couple of bites, I had to send it back.  I appreciate our server took it back without any fuss. I felt bad for sending the dish back so I ordered another entree to compensate even though I was quit full already.  The Mediterranean penne came fairy quickly however it was also mediocre.  It's too bad the the food is a hit and miss otherwise this could easily be a 5 star review."

The hostess immediately sat me at my own table after I requested to not be at the bar. I also like that she told me when the next reservation was so I would be able to time myself. The waiter was totally patient with me and recommended the duck. Which was cooked to perfection! I ended with the pistachio crème brûlée. Totally delicious.

After taking another look at the seating chart. she informed us that they magically had a cancellation and would be able to seat us early.. hmm sounds suspect. but whatever. we got to eat dinner early! it was a lovely place, and we were seated by the window. there was live music and the place reminded me of those parisian bistros you see in movies. our waiter was very nice and took our order. for drinks i got a glass of riesling and boyfriend got a glass of prosecco. and then we got the french onion soup, salmon tartar appetizer and for our mains i got the steak frites and the boyfriend got the seafood risotto. the french onion soup was AMAZING. i typically don't eat onions but i figured why not try the soup! especially after reading all the reviews about it! definitely did not disappoint! boyfriend had the salmon tartar which he very much enjoyed as well! for our mains, i got my steak frites cooked medium well. and although i've noticed some photos on yelp had a slab of butter on top of their steak i didn't get one on mine. not sure if they changed up their plating or what. but nonetheless it didn't make much of a difference cause i still enjoyed my meal. boyfriend also liked his seafood risotto. everything was flavorful and the scallops that came with it were also very good!it was a wonderful evening and i highly recommend reserving a table ahead of time as it seems like this place gets very busy!"

The salmon gravlax was also pretty good, but seemed just like a simple smoked salmon with a side salad. For our mains, we ordered the duck confit with risotto and seafood linguine - both of which were extremely delicious. My duck confit was so tender and juicy and slid right off the bone. My partner also seemed to really enjoy the seafood linguine as well; I had a bite and it was full of flavour. The ambience was so romantic and the live jazz music was a nice cherry on top. It is on the higher scale side, so expect for dinner to be around $30-$80 per person (depending on what you order and how many courses)! The only downside was the service, which was decent. I definitely recommend going to Modavie for excellent French food and a romantic night out!Tip: If you're going in the winter, you can hang up your jacket in a coat room at the front of the restaurant."

Was very nice but pretty small portion for $12ea. The apple desert was nice also but not very big either. Had a really good dark local brew.

We didn't really have much food to write about but what we had was good but not anything overly special and I was surprised at what the bill was for it. I'd give it a try again for a nice dinner next time I'm in Montreal but I'll be sure that my wallet is full first!"

Told him place was a little warm and saw him checking the thermostat. Service throughout dinner was spot on. He came by to check on us. 5 stars for service!Now, to the zero star!!The manager/host, older and shorter gentleman, was very rude. If he's the owner than great for him, as that's the way he wants to run his business. It took our table a while to get our food and rather than coming by to check on us, he instantly reacted and said what do you expect! He didn't even asked his wait staff or us how long it took. It could have been 1 minute or 5 or 20 minutes. He just said it will take a long time to bring the food out because of your group and said what do you expect? I told him that we expected the food to come out at the same time or close to it. Just rude. Our waiter came by and took over as the runner. Again, the waiter was excellent. We had a party of 7. One runner was bringing out 2 plates at a time and there was a long wait in between the runs. I guess this is normal according to the manager? Host? Or owner? Whoever he was. Food was good. Onion soup could use more onions. But the cheese and way it was baked was awesome. Sea bass was a little over cooked. And, it was cold. My plate was the first one that was served; therefore, it was cold. Ambience - five stars. Great romantic place with live piano and performer on Sunday night."

Unfortunately, their menu for happening gourmand weren't as appealing compared to other restaurants who are participating in that event. So we went outside of the Happening Gourmand menu. The 1st service was good and quick then our waiter finished his shift, and the next waitress took over, sadly, the service was lacking speed and help. Food wise, I started with onion soup; it was delicious. For my main meal, I had salmon tartare with fries. The flavor was little bland for me, and fries were over cooked. Then I got the cappuccino and tiramisu. It was the best tiramisu I ever had. Super light and delicious.The place is beautiful and rustic. The ambiance was fun and energetic. I hope next year, their menu for Happening Gourmand would be slightly better."

We came for lunch on the weekend and they had music playing. There was a brunch menu in addition to the usual offerings as well as a lunch menu that included a soup or a salad. The lamb poutine was pretty darn good as was the tartare. My wife got a huge mound of risotto, which I gladly dig into. Well seasoned, albeit maybe over salted. Nevertheless, we cleaned our plates. It was a busy day but the place was big enough to handle the crowds. Good for a group because the music adds a nice atmosphere and there is enough selection to satisfy everyone's palate."

We weren't here for long but figured at least one of the dinners we eat should be one fancy one. I made a reservation for 530 and we ended up being late but it didn't matter I think because it didn't get that busy till a lot later. It's very dark in the restaurant but has nice vibes. We sat near the door and it got a little chilly because well. It's winter. Seating area can be a little squishy but it's not too bad. Services was great. Food was good. The french onion soup was packed with flavour and the cheese was just amazing. It's the best when the cheese keep stretching. My pasta was interesting. It looked like a salad because it was all green. There wasn't any meat in it (wish there was, not sure if there's an additional add-on). It wasn't bad, tad plain. Tasted very healthy for sure.Desserts: cheesecake was probably my favourite. Not too sweet either. I don't really remember much as it was a while ago but I had a great time here.

We enjoyed all the food we had except for the lamb poutine. When it arrived, it wasn't hot and had way too much sauce. The sauce was a bit too salty and was watery. I don't recommend it at all, and it certainly wasn't worth the 5$ surcharge. All the orders of poutine except for one came out right after we ordered. I think it must have been the last portions of a big batch because we could tell it wasn't fresh. The last poutine that came out was about twice the size and was steaming hot. My partner, the lucky one who got the fresh poutine actually really enjoyed it.For mains, most of us had steak-frites and one ordered the Duck Confit. We were all impressed with our meals. Dessert was a choice between cheesecake and tiramisu. Both were delicious.If it weren't for the poutine, I would give this place a 5 star review. The atmosphere is cozy and the live jazz music is a serious plus. I'd recommend asking to be sat in the room next to where the music is being played.

We had an adorable table in the corner by the window, on the main floor and it was perfectly charming.My only complaint is that they told us we had to give up our table at 9pm for another party but when that time came, our waitress was no where to be found.. so we were a little bit stressed that we had to rush but no one was really being attentive to us.

The first trip I tried to eat there, I showed up without a reservation and they were fully booked through the Monday night. Next trip we made a reservation and it was available for all time slots, so just reserve to be safe.The atmosphere is very cute with 3 large rooms (bar area, jazz room, and anither cozy room in the back) and live jazz every night which was part of the draw for us! It was a lively crowd and nice to have the music as we were dining, setting the stage for a lovely dinner.I went with a group of 3 so we did all our plates to share. I'm sad to say we either ordered poorly or the food was just not as spectacular as I had hoped. Once we ordered we asked the server if there was anything great missing from our selections and he said we were covered so...The poutine was our starter, and were all v hungry so we kept eating it although it did not stand as one of the better poutines we've had in Montreal. Mains we ordered the Mussels and frites, Steak frites, the Chicken Supreme and a side of Carrot risotto.The only thing in our entire order that I would go for again was the Mussels- which were served in a big bowl with a delicious white wine sauce and a heaping pile of fries. The steak was fine, and the chicken that sounded so good on the menu was not good - however the truffle mashed potatoes that were served with the chicken were worth eating (I love truffle anything so that's an easy one for me). We didn't stick around for dessert but we noticed that pretty much every person in the restaurant was going for a slice of tiramisu and I'm curious to know if that would have saved dinner.."

This was one of those times.We arrived 5 minutes early for a 6:30 dinner reservation and the maitre d', Lorenzo, quickly showed us to our table -- as requested away from the live music in the bar area.Our waiter, Patrice, was clearly quite experienced and offered to help select a bottle of wine. I knew that I wanted a Bordeaux and asked him about a Haut Medoc in the $75 CDN range, which he agreed that the 2005 vintage would be exceptional. He quickly returned with a lovely decanter which he took great pains in filling to avoid sediment and accelerate opening. The wine was truly lovely and we enjoyed a glass with still-warm French bread and butter before ordering.Lorenzo, the maitre d' and long-time restaurant manager, stopped by several times to ensure that we were being properly taken care of, although I am sure that he knew his staff were performing well.I splurged on the house specialty sesame-encrusted rack of lamb, while my lovely bride-to-be went with a perfectly seared Atlantic salmon with olive tapenade (which I'm sure she chose because she knew I wouldn't like the tapenade). The seasonal vegetable side (carrots, parsnips, mini sweet peppers, zucchini) and gremot potatoes (salted small roasted potatoes) were a wonderful accompaniment. Yes, the wine was a tad ""big"" for these foods, but I like my red wine and this was a night to splurge.We normally do not order dessert, but I still had a glass of wine to finish so I asked about the Poudding Chomeur (French words that I hadn't picked up way back in high school). Poudding Chomeur literally translates to Unemployment Cake, and uses ingredients commonly available during the Depression (flour and maple syrup) to create a wonderful -- albeit sweet -- concoction that I had to cross spoons with my fiance to get enough of. I simply loooove real maple syrup (although Vermont gets the nod for best Grade A IMO).We really enjoyed Modavie...the decor, layout, staff, food and service were all exceptional. We simply love it when the staff are attentive and engaging, and Lorenzo and Patrice were certainly engaging and played the perfect hosts. We will be back in town at the end of our vacation in a few weeks and will likely stop by for our last meal before returning home!"

The $29 table d'hôte was a great deal and for the options of dishes offered, it was a good value. Being a French bistro in the old port of Montreal gave the restaurant a rustic vibe. However, what differentiates it from other restaurants in that area is that there are live musicians, and I believe this is a great addition for the restaurant. The service was good and music wasn't too loud. For happening gourmand, there was 3 options for an entrée (I had the panko fried brie which was good), 3 options for a main course (I had the tagliatelle with mushrooms which again, was good) and 2 options for a dessert (I had the Black Forest tulip which was my least favourite dish). They also offer a lot of sides at a decent cost, so I got carrot risotto which was my favourite! My group and I had a good time overall, but the food met our expectations, but for the price we paid, it was worth it!"

We weren't looking to eat anything too heavy, so we decided to just order a couple of appetizers:Fried Calamari: This has to be one of the better variations of this venerable classic I've ever eaten. The calamari was perfectly breaded and fried, and didn't contain any of the chewiness you sometimes get with bad calamari. And they were accompanied by two addictive sauces that proved a perfect complement (a creamy one and a tomato one that was surprisingly spicy).Duck Rillette: I'm not sure what separates a rillettes from a pate, but at any rate, this was delicious. It comes presented on a plate with crunchy toast and an assortment of nuts and berries and honestly I was blown away by how flavorful and melt-in-your-mouth succulent it was.I rarely mention alcohol in these reviews, but I have to single out the chardonnay we both drank. It was a brand called Oakbank and it was a perfect accompaniment to what turned out to be an incredibly laid-back, delicious lunch."

After all, live jazz, great reviews, within stumbling distance of our hotel... it had everything going for it. We were seated upstairs in a very crowded space, but right in front of the stage. The music was fantastic, and surprisingly not too loud given that we were literally face to face with the performers. The atmosphere is everything you'd hope for in a Montreal jazz institution - dark, old, full of character and story. The fact that people were tripping over us to get to their tables and that the buzz of conversation and clinking glasses seemed almost as loud as the music wassomehow just right.The food at Modavie, however... well, that wasn't quite as ""just right"". We started  with a small charcuterie board which was fantastic, by far the best part of the meal. I ordered the Steak Frites and Troy had the Pork Cheeks.The fries with my steak were by far the best part of the plate - thin and crispy and plentiful. The steak, on the other hand, was a pounded piece of cheap meat, so thin that there's no way they could have cooked it to my ""rare"" specification. The sauce that topped it was bland and brown. It looked like it was designed to cover up sins instead of enhancing the meat.Troy's Pork Cheeks tasted like pork and nothing more. They were served atop a bed of rice, which did have sone flavour, and topped with microgreens, which were admittedly a nice touch. We really enjoyed Modavie for the atmosphere and the music. That said, if I have the opportunity to go back, it will be for appys and drinks.- definitely not dinner. The meal just wasn't worth the price."

We agreed that it is one of the best meals we have ever had! As I am a vegetarian, it was especially wonderful to have a meal (the butternut squash cavatelli) that was not an afterthought for the menu but an intentionally delicious, savory meal. The wine, cheese plate, and creme brûlée kept pace with our delicious entrees. And to top it off, our server (Radouan) was a welcoming, informative, warm, and utmost professional server. Could not recommend enough!"

/user_details?userid=MqhhHaIcNwDCTblkCOf1Ug,Jean JD Audouin D.,"Lake Clear, NY",4 star rating,"Strolling through the old town of Montreal this weekend, we walked into Modavie for the second time. Old world charm with a few great rooms that are each unique onto themselves. The front room is livelier and has live music typically jazz at night. We were seated in the back room that is larger and more spacious between tables. Our waitress was attentive, polite, and very knowledgeable. We started with a homemade cognac foie gras torchon with a pineapple, onion and ginger chutney with rye brioche. I was a little surprised that it was not allowed a proper rest period right out of the walk-in. After allowing it to loosen up a bit, it became spreadable and we enjoyed the chutney combination. This was followed up by a Caesar salad with lardons. The perfection of the dressing with the anchovies, the silkiness of the yolks, cheese and perfect croutons pairing with the lardons was so good I could've stopped right there and been very happy! But when I saw the wild boar Osso Bucco with Milanese sauce, saffron risotto with sage, parmesan and hazelnut, well, I just couldn't pass that up. Good Lord I hate a mushy risotto! This risotto was perfection. I especially enjoyed the textural crunch of the hazelnuts!! Now for the wild bore, I had hoped it had a similar braised texture that falls apart upon diving in with the expected gaminess of the bore. It was a bit tough, but it could've simply been the cut not the length of braising? It was a good tasting dish and seasoned just right, with the potential miss step. The Somm recommended a Côtes du Rhône Villages, Le Ponnant, La Ferme du Mont 2017, France which we enjoyed throughout our meal. We ended the night with a pecan tart. The foie being way to cold and the bore being a bit too tough, brought me down to a 4 from a 5, which I was prepared to give them. I will return to try other dishes because I love the space and the staff. Phone battery died sorry no pictures."

There are many places to eat in Old Montreal, but Modavie being directly on the corner of all the action of Saint Paul spoke to me. We decided on having a seat at the high seats next to the window, with a view of all the people going by. It's a very elegant French restaurant without the need for getting dressed up all fancy. We checked out the wine menu and we both went with a glass of Riesling.  We decided we'll pick a few things to start and share with each other. We ordered the poutine which I was informed by our server is their version of junk food. It's basically fries with cheese curds, gravy and braised lamb. It was a large portion, tasted really good. We both enjoyed it very much and would come back for it again. We also ordered the Beet Salad along with a side of fries.This place was great for a late lunch not sure how dinner is but our food and service was great.

I had originally ordered the market fish which I was so excited about (Marlin) which is one of my favs but she came back to tell me they ran out I had to settle for salmon, which was a generous portion but lacked flavour especially when paired with the risotto.

The service was not bad but could be faster and more efficient. A friend ordered medium rare steak and got overcooked one which they accepted their mistake and brought her a another dish.

I ordered the poutine with braised lamb.  This tasted more like the traditional, however, that first one in Vancouver will forever be my favorite!  Two of us ordered the lamb chops since that is the house specialty.  The others had the steak frites.  The chops were grilled perfectly!  They came with some assorted vegetables and a rosemary marinade.  The others said the steak was ok, nothing spectacular.  I'm of the opinion that the lamb is the way to go!Our bottle of Malbec didn't last very long, so we though another was in order.  It was fun sitting at the bar and watching all the guests coming and going.  We started making up stories as we watched, like the couple on the first date and her thinking, ""How do I get out of this?"" and him thinking, ""She's the one!""...things like that.  They also have live jazz playing which is nice, especially if you are in the main dining room.Again, Lorenzo and Kim made the visit so much fun and enjoyable.  I would definitely come back if ever in the area!"

When I expressed my dissatisfaction with the soul he said it was my fault for ordering it. When my entree came, it was nothing like the description. I was expecting French toast with eggs and ham but got a cold French toast sandwich with cold cut ham and mayonnaise. When I told our server he blamed me again before taking it away. After waiting over 2.5 hours and not eating anything I was ready to leave. The waiter refused to take my items off the bill and was rude while my boyfriend was paying the bill.

I really wanted to be head over heels in love with this restaurant, and I had high expectations. It was so cute walking in, with the dark colors, low lighting, and bar backed by a staircase. Picturesque. We were seated promptly near the musician and he was fantastic. Our server was affable. We were really set up for success. But then the food. Just okay for the most part. My salad, missing something. The soup? Came out so cold that we thought it was actually supposed to be served chilled! We inquired with the nearest employee who promptly whisked away our cold soup and a few minutes later replaced it with hot soup. The hot soup was much better than the cold soup, but it was only okay. Needed a lot of salt and pepper. The entrees were good enough, I would certainly order mine again if I were there - but for the price it didn't quite meet expectations. It was the rib with mashed potatoes and veggies. There was definitely something missing - maybe just a little more au jus would have done it. I didn't enjoy the dessert at all. My husband ordered a goat cheese tart and absolutely loved it. He also said his penne with mushrooms was perfect. So maybe I had just ordered the wrong dishes.

On the positive side the steak was well cooked if a little swamped by the mountain of frites.  The osso bucco was well cooked and falling of the bone as it should. However, it was tasteless and under seasoned. The sauce had no flavour what so ever for such a long slow cooked dish. The accompanying risotto was over cooked and flavourless. Such a disappointment for slow cooked potentially very flavoursome joint of meat. They need to step up the food game quickly before the season escapes them."

I pointed it out to the server and she immediately took it back. She didn't say too much when she took it away and when she brought me back a new dish. Oh well the second one was much better as it was medium rare and tender. Flavours were ok but I've had better. My friends loved the seafood pasta and the steak frites.

They have two seatings, with the second starting at 9pm (at least on a Thursday night).Since we came as a business group hoping to talk, the live music was a bit of a distraction.

The space was a larger than we initially though so there was plenty of room for us at about 9:30pm on a Tuesday night. There was a live guitarist finishing up when we got there.We started with the braised lamb poutine and the French onion soup which the waiter told us they were known for (I think maybe all French restaurants say this.) The soup was great and cheesy. The onions had definitely been caramelized well. The poutine was also good, but the fries were a little skinny for poutine so the gravy:fries ratio ended up being a little to high for me.My mom and I both got the sesame crusted lamb with the goat cheese potatoes. Lamb was cooked perfectly medium rare and the sesame crust was crunchy. Could have used a touch more salt. I LOVED the potatoes, they give you a huge slice of goat cheese - as much or maybe more than the amount of potatoes they give you. That's what I always hope for in cheesy potatoes. For dessert we split the apple pie, which our waitress told us was their best dessert. Coming from the US (specifically the southern part of the US) it was not apple pie as I know it because it was deconstructed. There was a pie crust surrounding a very artistic looking mound of cinnamon apple slices. That being said, it was tasty and much less dense/filling/intense than a typical slice of apple pie. It's served with maple syrup (of course) and ice cream. Our waitress was super friendly and smiley which I always appreciate. She also kept our water glasses full which generally equates to an A+ in my book. A bit pricey, but a nice special occasion place in the scenic old Montreal area."

We ordered the charcuterie as a starter (which is actually more expensive as a whole than if you were to order the individual portions), and there was nothing special about it; it seemed as if each piece came straight from the package. We ordered the saffron risotto and the duck confit cassoulet as main dishes, and both were barely warm and cooked badly. We opted not to stay for dessert, but still ended up spending $125 on a meal that was disappointing at best.  I was surprised at our experience because many reviews were so positive, but I can only guess that is because the restaurant is in a busy tourist area.

Furthermore，he lights up all the candles except for my table.Come on, Montreal, now it is the 21st century，this shit makes me sick.

After several hours of walking in the blustery Montreal evening, we made our way to the restaurant. Much to our pleasant surprise, we were seated in front of the fireplace with no reservations!We ordered our standard favorite appetizer - French onion soup - and it was very good.  The steak Tartar was one of the best I've ever had. The atmosphere was very warm and cozy. As we were finishing our dinner a live band began to play which we did not stay for.One drawback was that they did not serve mulled wine which I thought was more commonly served in Montreal. Overall, Modavie was a very nice dining experience."

He was so good he almost outshone the food but not quite!  And the setting in Old Montréal was absolutely magical. I wish we could go back once a week!

Ok it's not rocket science -  haute cuisine - to make some mussels with a good sauce, but they were really good. We've been there on a Saturday night in April - not high season yet. We got a table right away. Service was really friendly and also the chef passed by to ask about our well being. In one of the Yelp reviews I read that this place is a tourist trap - from my visit experience I can not confirm that - but as I said it was slow season so possibly in high season it's different because it's located in a very popular area in the old town.

We ordered two glasses of wine, the catch of the day (walleye with vegetables), and the lamb chop (per the recommendation of the waitress). The fish and lamb courses were brought before the wine and bread even arrived. The lamb was average, but the root vegetables were badly undercooked. Everything was dry and flavorless. The walleye special was much worse. The fish filet was scrawny, mushy, and flavorless. The vegetables were likewise overcooked, and the only flavor I could taste was the pepper I added. According to Yelp, Modavie is the best restaurant in the Old Town, but after my experience, I would take the metro to a less touristy part of town if you want to get a decent meal."

It was a large group of 7 people, but we were refused to be seated at a table because of our size. All 7 of us had to cram into the bar. This may be reasonable if the restaurant was busy, however, the place was practically empty. There were tables everywhere and the place emptied out further as out dinner progressed. We were crammed in this tiny bar amidst a sea of empty tables, which ruined our dining experience, it was quite ridiculous.Even though we came for happy hour, we spent good money.

The others also didn't seem to love their dishes, which made me wish we had dined elsewhere since we were only visiting Montreal for 3 nights.

We started the night off with drinks, but were sadly disappointed by their use of premade mix and not egg whites for their sour drinks. Although, they did serve us with a giant glass goblet, which was much appreciated. We then had the lamb poutine, which really did not do justice to the classic Canadian dish. We had to hunt for cheese curds, and the sauce was practically absent. It was literally a spoonful of lamb on top of, surprisingly, crispy fries. We also thought the lamb was oversalted.The entrees were average at best. We had the sesame-crusted lamb chops, which were okay but nothing to write home to your mama about. The brie mashed potatoes, however, were definitely interesting and stood out in this dish. We also had the catch of the day, which was, again, average. Not what I expected from a French fine dining restaurant. If you're looking for drinks, go somewhere else. If you're looking for poutine, go somewhere else. If you're looking for haute-cuisine, go somewhere else. If you're looking for an average restaurant to hide from the snow and rain from, come here.

We all opted to get that, with different combinations of the beet salad or poutine to start, lamb and risotto or steak frites as the main, and cheesecake and tiramisu for dessert. All of the flavors were absolutely perfect and you can tell the chef puts a lot of work into each and every meal.We also shared a bottle of red wine. The wine list is a bit daunting, but there's certainly something for everyone, taste- and price-wise.The atmosphere was so lovely and our server was beyond amazing.

I assumed they were pepper from them recently filling all the shakers, as they were all filled to the brim.  Other than these small hiccups the service overall was great.The food, oh the food.  The part that everyone looks forward to in a restaurant.  We got a complimentary basket of bread.  The bread its self was quite good, soft and chewy in the center with a delicious crunch crust.  The butter on the other hand was rock hard and completely non spreadable. We ordered an appetizer of fried calamari. When it came to the table we were shocked to learn that it came with a side salad, which was very good.  The calamari on the other hand, was dark in color and rubbery in texture.  Clearly overcooked and at the same time lacked seasoning. The paprika mayo dipping sauce was the saving grace of the appetizer for sure.  For me I ordered the steak frites.  This is one of my favorite dishes, I particular enjoy the contrast in textures between the soft tender steak and the crispy fires.  The fries were perfect, salty and crispy just as one would hope they would be.  The steak, which I order medium rare, was close to medium.  It looked as though it had been cut several times, maybe to check the temperature that they missed the mark on.  Overall the steak was tender and moist, however, it too lacked seasoning.  Overall, Modavie is a nice restaurant for atmosphere and service.  The food on the other hand is not as good as the price would lead you to assume."

It brought back memories of living in France - excellent execution!  The smoked salmon and fresh cream with capers blinis were good, although the blinis themselves were a bit hard.  I would have preferred a bit of a softer pancake as this was a bit hard to cut through.  I didn't get the feeling that they were fresh (maybe frozen and then microwaved?)  However, the balance between the salmon and tasty fresh cream was just right!  A rich meal that made you feel like you were dining in style! :) Finally, the salade frisee avec lardons was also a success - the frisee had a light dressing, the bacon/lardon balanced out the lightness of the salad and it came with a hardboiled egg.  Again, reminder of a life of leisure in Paris :)Try Modavie if you're on a budget, but still want to eat well.  We stuck with smaller plates and felt very satisfied with the quality and portions!  We'll be back the next time we return to Montreal!"

We ordered too much food and couldn't order any dessert but the server just took the menu away and left without saying anything. Then when my boyfriend was still enjoying his half left glass of wine, our server already gave us the bill. I'm like can't we just sit down and chat and enjoy the wine? That is rude and just felt like they're trying to kick us out. Service wise it's not the best for sure, the food is one of the best that I've tried. However, will never come again. Sorry to say that.

The ambiance is great with live jazz music, the decor is rustic and intimate, service is good but the food is nothing incredible. My steak, although tender, did not have much flavor. I'd say you're coming here more for the concept rather than the execution. Still though, a very nice place to enjoy  dinner in Old Montreal."

We ordered a beef tartare appetizer, lamb poutine and Nicosia salad. Wish I had taken some photos!! Tartare was a very dark color and had a livery strange flavor, we didn't finish it as we felt the quality and freshness of the meat was off. The poutine came next, the lamb on top was good, but was served on a. Bed of cold and undercooked fries. Finally, the nicoise arrived and tasted like everything had been prepped and referigerated- the boiled egg and seared tuna were freezing cold. Disappointing experience in a city full of excellent French bistros. Props to the server who was kind enough to remove the two appetizers from the tab when we showed her the quality of the food we received."

We made reservations in advance and had a very kind manager email us confirming our reservation and group menu. I was impressed with how good the service was as we were a large group and the resto was packed. The food arrived fairly quickly. I had the salmon which was perfect. The tiramisu was out of this world. I think our entire table was going crazy over the tiramisu. The live jazz was just a cherry on top of a great evening. The next day I got an email from the manager asking if we enjoyed our night at Modavie. Excellent service and experience. I definitely recommend this restaurant for a party.

I had the tagliatelle with chicken in a light creme sauce. We both liked our dishes.

The place is nice and a lot bigger then I expected. My partner and I both ordered drinks, he had a martini and I had the cucumber tonic. both dinks were very good. We did not order and appetizer but they do give you bread which is always nice! The waitress we had was very attentive and nice.I ordered the stake frites and was less then impressed. The fries were okay but the stake was eh. It was cooked well but covered in steak sauce or something which I was not really a fan of. The dish was kind of boring, literally just steak with a bunch of fries on the side. Partner had a dish I believe was called chicken supreme which turned out to be pretty good! its nothing I would rave about. Its a 1/2 chicken, baked crispy, served with some potatoes. The place feels nice. The service was good, but I just don't feel the food was anything to rave about. There are so many good places to eat in Montréal, I probably would not return. Maybe I would try it for brunch!"

Modavie is a very nice restaurant with a full service bar. It effectively has 2 dinning rooms and you can hear the music throughout the place but if you want to see the musicians you need to sit in the main one facing the side street. My wife and I both had different fish plates and they were both excellent. Service was friendly, efficient and atmosphere overall very nice. My only disappointment was we were told by the hotel that music played until midnight but it doesn't, it ends around 10 pm. Otherwise I would highly recommend Modavie if you are in old Montreal."

Nice scene, attractive space and great live music. However, our waiter, while polite, was inattentive and seemingly absent minded. We needed to waive him over each and every time we wanted something. The cheese plate needed some honey or jam as it was otherwise unremarkable. The kitchen was very slow in producing plates for us and those around us. Between the delays caused by the waiter and kitchen we elected to pass on having dessert. We had the rack of lamb crusted in sesame and the chicken supreme. Both were cooked nicely but required a little more flavor. We would recommend the earlier seating -- at least then they will serve you in a timely fashion to get you out before the second seating."

I had the lamb and it literally fell off the bone when I touched it with my fork. Get the limon cake if you're into dessert, its a little creamy but the crust is totally worth it. Waiter was great and even taught me a few french words.

Made reservations 3 days before to ensure we would have a table on a Saturday night!  One word of caution, parking in Old Montreal is not always easy.  We had to park a little walk away!  As we entered the restaurant we noticed it had a nice cosy dark feel to it with an open kitchen and a bar tucked just under the staircase to the second floor.  We had a smaller sized table against the wall(2nd floor) but had a good view of the small stage where music would soon commence.  I started with a glass of the Carnivor Cab Sav ($9 a glass) and my wife had the Cosmo pastis $9.  nice light Cab Sav.  We both ordered soup, mine the french onion ($8) and she had the soup of the day cream of broccoli!($5).  Onion soup au gratin was okay 3/5 missing some onion filling but definitely had a nice taste to it just it could have been better.  My wife's however was much better (she gave me a taste).  For main's I had the steak frites ($23) and she had the Salmon tournedos with lentils ($21).  The SF was fantastic.  The cut was a hanger steak (bavette de boeuf) a bit chewy but had a very nice shallot sauce and was just as I had in mind.  Ordered it rare!  My wife was very happy with the Salmon tornedo.  She said freshness and flavour was great!  The portion size was perfect for her.  Not too large not too small!  I was watching the servers bring food to different tables and it looked like 60% of the people ordering were selecting the rack of lamb with oregano or the one with goat cheese.   As we were eating a nice blues band started to play and the place started to fill up quickly shortly between 7 - 7:15 PM.  The band was quite good and added to a nice ambiance that fit the mood of the place.  The only negative I would mention is I believe there to be too many tables upstairs.  I told my wife ""I would not want to be upstairs if there was a fire as you felt that there would be a mad stampede""!  Heading to the washroom you had to skinny through tables to the restrooms.    For dessert I had the Kahlua tiramisu and she had the Apple tart with Ice Cream.  My tiramisu was really good.  Nice and light and as a Tiramisu should taste.  My wife was disappointed with her apple tart.  It was basically a cored apple in a shell with cinnamon and a scoop of ice cream!  All in all this is a fabulous restaurant and we really enjoyed the experience and would definitely come back even though there were a few missteps!  Thanks Risa and Katherine!  Happening Gourmand GC greatly appreciated!  Rock on!"

Modavie is likely the restaurant you'll be directed to in Old Port if you're looking for a dining setting with some live jazz music. For me, it all comes down to service. Each time I've visited Modavie, I've experienced some kind of issue with rude and/or visibly overworked staff members. Last night's experience started with a very out ""of sorts hostess"" who guaranteed us we would not get a table and, after we asked for a second opinion, changed her tune and found us a decent spot upstairs. I'm not saying people need to be perfect but a positive attitude is foundational in any service job. Food wise, it's hit and miss. My go to is typically the pork cheek risotto. You can't go wrong with the charcuterie boards. Most of their cheeses and pates are home made. And lastly, the reason you end up at Modavie, the live music. Totally makes coming here worth it. Will I be back? Most likely. Will I enjoy it? It's different every time."

We started with the foie gras, French onion soup, and lamb poutine --- all of which were very good. My favorite out of our appetizers was surprisingly the lamb poutine. The fries were crisp and the lamb was delicious. It was our favorite poutine out of the ones that we tried during our visit. Even though our waiter touted that their French onion was the best in the city, I thought it was just decent and not really worthy of the $10 price tag. For my entree, I ordered the duck confit which was executed very well. The duck was nice and moist throughout and the skin was delicious. My sister's lamb was cooked to a medium rather than the medium rare that we had requested, but it was still very tender and flavorful so we didn't make a fuss. As our dessert, we tried their vanilla panna cotta which was just the right amount of sweetness to end the meal with.

We were competing with the volume of 30+ very boisterous diners, perhaps all co-workers? Their volume, coupled with the high ceilings, made for an almost deafening experience.

/user_details?userid=Uv5v7r1eN4XFsKZ2jwn1sg,Brian C.,"New Orleans, LA",2 star rating,"This was definitely the mistake in a recent visit to Montreal during the Jazz Festival.  Not sure how this place has 4 stars on Yelp given that everything was average at best.  Music? It was okay.  Atmosphere?  The front bar section was beautifully done but you couldn't hear the music and the main dining room was fairly tightly spaced and not exciting.  Cocktails were okay, wine list was okay, and the food was just okay.  The lamb burger was actually better than average and cooked nicely plus it was served with a side of decent fries which appeared to be completely unsalted and we didn't get any condiments delivered to the table until halfway through the meal.  The lamb cavatelli pasta was completely under-seasoned, not great even after adding salt, and had 3 tiny little scraps of braised lamb in the entire large plate.If you're looking for a tourist trap in Old Montreal, you've found it.  We didn't mean to end up here but we did for one night and it was by far my worst decision on a 4 day visit to Montreal.  If I weren't from New Orleans I might have lower expectations and may have potentially enjoyed this place more, but I easily could have done a whole lot better at home and will long be disappointed by wasting a meal at Modavie while at the Jazz Festival in Montreal.  Oh well, lesson learned."

Under normal circumstances, I would have mentioned this to the waiter, but I didn't bother reminding them since I was busy enjoying her company & the live music. At the end of the night, as I was about to pay the bill. I couldn't bring myself to just ignore the poor service that we received, so I called to speak with the manager. We spent the next 15 mins talking... unfortunately i don't feel it changed anything.We dine often in Montreal, and much smaller incidents are treated very seriously. I prefer to spend my time in a place that knows how to provide an excellent ambiance and service, and unfortunately Modavie does not meet our standards."

Great group of ladies.Unfortunately same cannot be said for server or food here necessarily. I was feeling a tender steak and made a point to ask the server which of their Bavette or strip loin is most tender. He told me the strip loin...so I trusted him. The person next to me was having steak frites...his looked perfectly cooked medium rare. I got my steak. Well done to hell. I told my server and he looked at my well done cross section and said ""yes you mentioned medium rare..."" Mind blowing stupidity. I said its over cooked and not medium rare....he says in Canada it's medium rare...I said if this is medium rare...what the hell is well done? Charred to shit?Anyways he claimed I should have ordered it blue and brought me a newer steak. It was better but not medium rare. More like medium. Steak was delicious but the vegetables were so/so.I'd recommend the place for live music and OK food. Not great for perfect steaks. Prices reasonable but the food I would sort of say is below par."

I ordered the carrot risotto and it was DELICIOUS! The portion seemed small at first but once I ate it all I was stuffed and couldn't eat it anymore.

We requested a table with live music & got to sit upstairs in front of the performers for the night. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and has an excellent ambience. Great for groups or special events. For starters, we got the lamb poutine which we both loved! For our mains, I got the rack of lamb, as per the server's recommendation, and my boyfriend got the seafood risotto. My lamb was amazing! By far, the best lamb I've ever had. My boyfriend was also very happy with his seafood risotto. For dessert, I ordered a creme brulee and he ordered the pouding chomeur. Overall, with the quality of the food, service, and fun atmosphere, this was our favourite dining experience we've ever had together!

/user_details?userid=yzzhTpIH5-PIAC1EeePjfw,James E.,"New Haven, CT",2 star rating,"I will start this review by saying that halfway through the dinner my partner and I shared here, we had relatively high hopes. My cocktail (Fitzgerald) and her rosé were both lovely. The foie gras torchon was good, and the very friendly and accommodating waiter suggested a wine pairing with the appetizer that ended up complimenting the dish very appropriately. However after this it went somewhat downhill. The wait time grew long, and we saw the waiter less and less. Finally, our entrees came out. The wild boar osso bucco was entirely lacking any seasoning. The risotto was dull and flavorless. The steak was rare as requested but clearly had not been rested properly and also lacked seasoning. The fries were okay, but there were far too many of them. The truffle mayo was also good. If given the choice, I'd probably stop in for a drink but pass on dinner. Cheers."

If it's a weekend or holiday and you don't have a reservation, the only choice is sitting at the bar for an overly priced meal. They say that they are known for thier lamb but I think it's only because it's the highest priced item on the menu. We started out with the French onion soup which was probably the best French onion soup that I have ever had. Also ordered the octopus salad which was over dressed with oil and had about 5 small pieces of octopus ($15!!). My bf had the rack of lamb which was maybe at best a solid 2. I had the mussels and fries which was pretty decent but not for the price of $30. Would come back for the soup but that's it. Not worth the $30-$40 entrees. If it wasn't for the soup, I would give a rating of 1.5."

They told us we needed to be out by 8, so they could use the table which was weird. but we weren't rushed by our waitress and seated immediately. So many thanks there to the great staff.Ordered beet salad for an appetizer and it was tremendous. All the ingredients were very fresh. For an entree, i ordered the duck confit and mushroom risotto. Where the risotto lacked in salt and flavor, the duck made up for. Cooked perfectly. The beau ordered lamb chops, which she said lacked any kind of flavor, so that along with my risotto is the reason for the 4 stars. I'd visit again, perhaps try something else."

/user_details?userid=-pG4fm6eWoGLP6fIsFBvzw,Teri Y.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,"Wasn't exactly impressed with Modavie. I'm not sure if it was because we came for lunch but then again, it shouldn't matter if it was lunch or dinner. The food was just really average and it felt like one of those moments where, oh well, we needed a place for lunch anyway so at least we had something to fill our stomachs from Modavie.Lunch order came with a choice of daily starter or soup. I chose the daily starter which was a small plate of salad. The salad didn't look exactly very compelling or attractive presentation wise--- light green chopped lettuce, sliced almonds and pieces of mandarin oranges. Sounds pretty good in writing, right? The pieces of mandarin still had the white pith hanging from all the pieces. It looked like if I was peeling the orange myself at home for a quick snack while standing over the kitchen sink.My lamb sandwich sounded great on the menu though there was nothing that stood out from it. The lamb was tossed with brown gravy and the meat was tender, but that was it. It didn't do anything else for me, taste wise. I asked my husband how was his smoked salmon and said ""It was good but not great."""

We enjoyed the rustic feel of the bar area, felt much more Christmas'ee.We ordered the charcuterie and cheese boards, both were very standard and nothing to rave about. The mains were however,  delicious. Our table had ordered the steak frites, the rack of lamb, the duck confit, and the risotto. The steak frites was probably the most standard/boring main - a bit dry in my opinion. The lamb was juicy and tender, done to perfection. The risotto was very creamy and flavourful - served in a very large portion considering how heavy this is.

Mushroom Risotto with duck confit was well-seasoned and in generous portion. The dessert was great. Not much comment on my appetizer but my friend who ordered salmon tartare looked delicious (she did say that the calamari is not her best). The highlight of this place is the live music and impeccable service if you want more than just good food.

If you love lamb as much as I do. The lamb is the buzz at this restaurant. Too bad I could only afford the lamb poutine. The rack of lamb is 39 dollars I wish I could've tried it.

When making reservations, we asked to sit in the live music section. I was pleasantly surprised that we had a table right by the stage. I wanted to love this place really badly. However, it just didn't work for me. I decided to go with the ""Table D'hôte"" menu. For appetizer, I got the pork rilletes. Unfortunately, it tasted like bland chicken salad. I was extremely excited about the brook char, but became extremely disappointed once it came out. My entree had no flavor profile. Everything on the plate clashed. The char barely had any salt or pepper. The beets tasted like they came straight out of a can, and the ""corn chowder"" was comprised of corn, potatoes and peas. Oh, and some cucumber was thrown on top. Everything on that plate disagreed with each other. For dessert, I had the pudding chameux - a fluffy cake with a maple syrup soft crust and vanilla ice cream. It was delicious! I learned it was a typical dessert in Montréal, passed down by generations. Our server was amazing and extremely attentive. She was kind and made sure that we felt important.

There are two levels and we made reservations to be seated upstairs by the music. I recommend making reservations as it is busy in the evening. Our waitress was sweet but with the level of noisy patrons and music it was hard to hear her with her lovely French accent. We were brought a loaf of good crusty French bread and soft butter.  We started our meal with a cheese plate and a bottle of French wine. The cheese was plentiful but was really nothing outstanding which was surprising. We have better cheese plates in the U.S. I was expecting lovely French cheeses but had hunks of just middle of the road cheeses. The wine, however, was outstanding!  This place specializes in lamb so my husband ordered the rack of lamb, which was perfectly cooked rare and was encrusted in sesame seeds and served with warm goat cheese over roasted potatoes and grilled baby carrots. It was amazing...I had a taste. I had the cavatelli with lamb, fennel and sun dried tomatoes and our server grated Parmesan cheese on top.  I started eating the dish and it tasted very good, but after a few bites, I noticed I had no lamb in my dish.  I flagged down our server and pointed that out, and she said she needed to take the dish into a better light because the dining area was very dark. She brought my plate back and apologized that the chef forgot to put lamb in the dish. Unbelievable! The dish with the lamb was delicious. I would expect for their error that they would have provided better customer service and maybe offer a complimentary dessert for their mess up. Being a server in my past life, that's what I would have done for my customer's inconvenience.  The musician was so good and added to the dining experience.  I would recommend dining here, making reservations...and double-checking your entrée to make sure that they have all ingredients!"

The food was just really average and it felt like one of those moments where, oh well, we needed a place for dinner anyway so at least we had something to fill our stomachs from Modavie.We went on a wednesday night and the live music was good. That's about all that was good about this establishment. We were ordering drinks and my friend asked for a Aperol Spritz, and the waiter said they were out of it. Then my friend asks for basic sparkling wine, and they were out of that too... I'm not sure how a restaurant can be sold out of sparkling wine, but Modavie was. She ended up ordering an Old Fashioned and I had a Twist Canadien. The waiter comes back with our drinks and we notice that they look a bit light in color. We taste our drinks and it is nothing but water and a tiny drop of alcohol.  We shake it off and order appetizers since we are really hungry.We order the lamb poutine, beet salad, fried calamari, and mussels. Everything came out relatively fast, but everything was luke warm. The fried calamari comes with a huge salad, but the calamari looks like it came out of the freezer and thrown in the deep fryer. The lamb poutine was okay, but the gravy was cold and just ruined the dish. The mussels came in a huge pot, but tasted very bland and once again it was not very warmOverall, we were not satisfied and we left after the appetizers. The waiter did not even bother us after we ordered appetizers, but that was a good thing since we did not want to continue our dining experience."

When we arrived at the charming bistro, we were whisked away to the upper level right past where the live singer was playing. Upstairs we could faintly hear the music, and shortly after they seated a large party not far from us and we could not hear the music at all. Their warm herb filled rolls dinner started with were lovely and warm and delicious. My friend ordered onion soup and while she thought it was tasty, she described it as ""nothing to write home about"" my friend raved about both his foie gras appetizer and his duck confeit, while I ordered the lamb with goat cheese and potatoes. The goat cheese was incredible! Creamy and earthy and fragrant. The lamb was perfectly cooked, but lacked any real flavor, still I enjoyed it.

There were few people but we were still waiting for our dessert at 9.The food was mostly good, as I'd heard. I started with fried calamari, which were nicely cooked, though the sauces could have been a little more adventurous. The birthday boy had foie gras, which came with a pear compote (nice complement), and a piece of olive-oiled herbed toast, which actually detracted from the foie gras, but never mind.Our mains were the catch of the day - a fillet of dory, served with a super creamy, delicious risotto; the lamb rack with sesame seed crust and goat's cheese (the meat was beautifully cooked); and my 11yo had the guinea fowl in honey and lemon (the flavours complemented the texture and taste of the meat very nicely). The portion for my child was actually perfect, but I'm sure I would have felt a tad cheated as an adult...We had crème brûlée (perfect texture with the merest hint of lemon, just as it should be, and the correct, tepid temperature under the sugar), tiramisu with kahlua (light, creamy, very coffee-flavoured but not that authentic), and tarte tatin with ice cream (lovely caramelised apples that were cooked separately from the pastry apparently, but delicious anyhow) for dessert.We drank an Italian Sangiovese with our meal, which was excellent, and had started with cocktails: a French mojito (yum) and a Cosmo with ricard, which had a slightly medicinal taste... We finished with great espressos that were strong and smooth.But the service left much to be desired:- We got our cocktails quickly, but weren't informed of the soup of the day or the catch of the day before we asked. This meant we weren't ready to order when the server came over. So we had to wait again.- We didn't get bread though I saw every other table did.- We ordered the wine with the meal but, instead of getting it immediately so it had time to breathe, we had to ask for it once we'd received our hors d'oeuvres. The wait between dishes was long. We noticed this despite having gift-giving to occupy some of the time.- We did not receive any apology at any time.In retrospect, it seems our server had a greater number of tables to wait than the other two servers. This tells me it's the restaurant's organization that is to blame.I'd really like to have given this place a better review. I loved the live jazz that adds ambiance but at no time interferes with talk, as well as the absence of the ubiquitous Montreal TVs. The food was good. The wine selection was wonderful, and the wine we chose was excellent. But going out is a total experience. If it's just for good food, I can eat that at home..."

The mussels were amazing. I wish I had ordered it for myself instead of sharing with my husband. The mussels we're cooked perfectly and had the best flavor, sweet and light and it went well with the fries. I got the lamb chops over the rack as recommended because the waiter said the rosemary was fantastic. The flavor was good but I wasn't a fan of the way my lamb was cut or cooked.

We only had one night in Montreal this trip, and were incredibly disappointed we made such a poor restaurant choice.  The weather was fantastic, so we sat outside on a Monday evening. It was not super busy and the waitstaff to customer ratio was sufficient. Our appetizer was brought to us before we even saw a drink, including water. We eventually received water, but the cocktails we ordered when we were handed our menus, did not arrive until our main course was served. My coworker ordered a medium rare steak and received a well done, almost burned piece of meat. I ordered the seafood special, which happened to be sea bass and it too, was extremely over cooked.

The food was just delicious.  I had the BEST lamb chops, perfectly done and so tender.   Well seasoned, with potatoes and grilled-just-right veggies.  Hubby had the fish, which was excellent as well.  Well paired with an excellent bottle of red recommended by the waiter who didn't try to upsell us.  Topped off by a very yummy piece of tiramisu.We had an excellent romantic night out, well chosen.  Great start to the rest of the trip."

We were underwhelmed.After being positively wowed at our previous Montreal spots, our four person team was expecting another great meal. We had made reservations for the jazz area and were greeted by nice soft jazz. The man, who seemed to be the owner, joked that I had written on my reservation that if I didn't enjoy the food, I wouldn't pay. If only.We sat down, ordered drinks and apps: a cheese board, calamari, a soup and salad. Came out just fine, calamari was crispy, cheese plate was good, big strips of bacon on the salad. We also put our  entrees in before the apps arrived.And then we waited. Watched the tables that were sat after us get their food. Watched them finish their food. Watched their waters get refilled while ours sat empty. Watched our drinks whittle away to nothing... And then watched as waiters rushed by without a word to us.Finally our food came. One pasta dish was incorrect and had to be sent back. The mussels were lukewarm and the fries cold. The confit duck was hot, but the skin was flabby like over cooked pasta and the roasted carrots were well under. It was not impressive. The correct pasta came later, and was relatively flavors AND we had to ask to get drinks refilled.We picked at our food a bit, politely declined dessert and any takeout boxes. We received the check and were dismayed to find none of our concerns were acknowledged on the bill.I wouldn't recommend wasting your money or time here. Go elsewhere."

Ambiance is a kind of classy casual, but also reasonably priced and unpretentious - a seemingly hard balance to find in the area. The live jazz was great, volume level was just right, and it was very easy to feel comfortable there.The waitress struggled a bit with English, which is absolutely fine, as I don't expect fluent English in a primarily French speaking area. The reason I bring it up at all is because despite her not being fully fluent, she was still very friendly and not at all impatient with our mixed English and poor attempts at French. It was nice to be able to try the bit of French my girlfriend and I know without feeling judged at all for it, which isn't something I can say for some of the other places I dined and visited.Food and mixed drinks were quite good. Not outstanding, but certainly a satisfying and enjoyable meal.

The starters were good but nothing too special. They were generous with their goat cheese portions though.Main course wise is where the restaurant blew us away. The boys had lamb chops, a friend had grilled salmon, and I had cavatelli with lamb, fennel, and tomatoes. Everyone was thoroughly impressed with their food. I can say that the pasta I had is one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had- the mix of flavours was spectacular. The portion was also very very generous- enough so that I took it home and had it for lunch at work the next day.My table ordered the chocolate fondant which was also good, according to those eating it.I will DEFINITELY be back here again.

The fried calamari was great. Also not greasy. And you don't need any of the dipping sauces. I thought it was fine without it. Don't get the smoked salmon crostini- it was kind of sad with hard bread and a tiny piece of salmon, two capers and a pea size cream. The linguini with scallop and shrimp was meh. Bland, boring. The scallops were tough but the shrimps were perfectly cooked."

The place is in a great location and the idea of live music is what made us chose it. Well....... the decor is old and just cheap looking. The prices were extremely high which is fine if the food and service are good. The salmon was almost non eatable and the drinks were shameful. $16 for a vodka on the rocks which was literally one sip. Not joking ONE SIP! Not once but twice. As far as the live jazz. The singer was on break for 40 min after playing for about 15 min. She had an amazing voice but she definitely did not want to be there. All around terrible experience!

Upon arriving, hostess did not say a word... seating us in a table where we could hear the music but not what we asked for. Server was ok, but seemed like he was running around as the place was understaffed. The food itself was very good. Main complaint came with dessert. Ordered a spiked coffee and tiramisu. The tiramisu came immediately and the waiter claimed at that moment that he would be right back with the drink. 15 min go by, he's nowhere to be seen. We finish the dessert and now don't want the coffee. I get up to tell the waiter to cancel, he now has the drink.  He gets to the table and tells us that it's not French custom to serve coffee with dessert - turns out this is 100% true. Ok, cool, but 3 factors here: 1.) we're clearly not from here and got confused by his statement that the drink was coming right up 2.) he was missing in action for so long we couldn't even ask about it. 3.) maybe it's us, but we felt like he was speaking down to us... given the cost of the food, we expected more of an ""I'm sorry"" and that would have been enough.He comped the dessert, which was nice, and even brought another one, but by that point the meal was done, and the offense was taken. Call us stupid Americans if you will, but this area is all tourists, so you need to at least consider who's paying your tab.This was our second time here, the last time with friends 2 years ago, and due to the service, will also be our last."

Food I ordered the braised lamb which came on this flaky pastry with meat in each layer. So moist I dreamt about it later. My friend had the steak which was juicy, tender, flavorful.

Our plan was to have a nice meal with drinks that would hopefully last a couple hours, but instead we were out within an hour of ordering. We initially laughed it off that our appetizers came before our cocktails and when our server came around as we were finishing, I asked him for the wine list and stated we would like to have some wine with our mains. Once we had the menu, he said to let him know if we had questions. I knew immediately that I did because we already knew what our mains would be, but he walked away he saying he would be back in a minute to answer our questions... and we never saw him again until after we finished our mains. He then brought us the dessert menu and took the wine menu saying ""you must be finished with this"". We declined dessert, opting to go elsewhere. As for the food, it was decent, but a little lacklustre. Our mains came with fries, but they tasted just like unsalted McDonald's fries."

The ambiance was great and the jazz music was just the vibe we were going for. However, the best tasting food of the meal was the bread. Womp. We ordered the soup special and tried it and the same time and gave each other looks like, ""that's it?"". The steak frites lacked flavor and I found myself heavily salting and peppering to compensate, which I do not think should be necessary when you are eating at a restaurant where everything should be perfectly seasoned. The butternut squash and lamb pasta dish was nothing to write home about; I barely noticed the butternut squash and the lamb did not taste good at all (I usually love lamb). The drinks were also very expensive, which is to be expected at an upscale restaurant, but the wine selection did not reflect this. This is one of the pricier restaurants in the city, so we were hoping that the food would be worth it, but it was not. Everything on the menu sounded like it'd be delicious but the flavor was just not there. The great music, bread, and our kind server were the highlights of our meal, which is why I'm giving a second star."

Everything was very good and enjoyable. My issue however is with the other patrons. I can't believe how many people (men) thought it would be fine to go to a nice restaurant wearing shorts and flip flops. Ladies what are you doing with these guys? My partner would castrate me if I told her I wanted to go out to a nice place for dinner and came out with a golf shirt and cargo pants. Is it no wonder locals hate tourists? I know you're on vacation but put on your big boy pants and don't pout. Maybe she'll appreciate you more. You're not going to Hooters with the boys to pound back some brews and tackle the suicide wings. The owner should take some of the blame and that's the reason I rated this 3/5.

My friend and I asked to taste a different wine that was listed but it took another 30 minutes for the ""taste"" to arrive. We both agreed to the wine that was satisfactory proceeded to order our meals. I ordered the salmon tartar appetizer and my friend had the prix fixe menu starting with the escargot. Another thirty minutes later our wine arrived followed by our appetizers fifteen minutes later. The salmon in the salmon tartar was tasteless as it was overpowered by the herbs and spices that was mixed in. I suspect it wasn't the freshest salmon. My friend described his escargot as tasteless lumps swimming in a mediocre sauce. I made a mistake when I ordered a salad nicoise for an entrée. I asked the waitress to make sure the tuna was cooked rare. I was informed that the fish was pre-cooked but that it was indeed rare. What was I thinking fish pre-cooked!!!! I think my mind was numbed as we had been sitting at that point for an extended period of time. Of course when my dish arrived the tuna was inedible. The one bright spot for the restaurant was my friend's octopus. He claimed that the dish was cooked well.When the waitress asked how our meal was after the appetizer I expressed my displeasure at the tasteless salmon and the extended amount of time we had to wait. She offered to send the manager to our table but of course he never showed. Obviously this restaurant no longer cares about providing good food or service."

The restaurant achieves a great balance, so much that it is difficult to categorize. Modavie is where French brasserie meets contemporary lounge. You don't have to search hard to find that Modavie is known for its Jazz. While enjoying the live entertainment, diners enjoy a relaxed atmosphere that is pleasing to the eyes as well. The detailed woodwork, exposed stone/brick and dim lighting gave Modavie a very romantic feel.The food was outstanding. The cuisine can be considered French Canadian at heart, but don't be afraid to step outside of contemporary Québéc towards classic Americana dishes a la steak and potatoes. My rare filet mignon was on par with a Ruth's Chris, with a superior selection of vins au verre. The experience was good enough to keep me around for the rare dessert course that was enjoyed with a hard to find J&B Jet 12 year blended scotch.I left Modavie with a full stomach and a great buzz."

We had a nice bottle of wine and port to finish off our meal. Service was nice and easily transitioned between English or French. Excellent place and I'll definitely be back. Enjoy!"

Since he loves jazz music and i love good food, i knew modavie was a must.   Upon arriving, we were guided by the hostess upstairs towards the jazz bar, the atmosphere was amaaazing. Although i'm not usually a huge fan of jazz, i still really enjoyed every min of the show. The service was also A+, given how busy it was the waitress was relatively fast on refilling our water and bread basket. Let me just say, out of all the restaurant I've been to, Modavie hands down has the best kaizer buns ever. It was warm and crispy on the outside and perfectly soft and tender on the inside. We even had to get a refill because it was that good. The food took about 30 mins, but between the wine and music, it really wasnt so bad.   I ordered the pasta while my boyfriend order the duck confit. The pasta was alright but the duck was DELICIOUS. it was so tender that it literally just fell off the bone. The sauce was also perfectly done.   Overall, we had an amazing experience and i would definitely go back."

/user_details?userid=1YRJl5FC24VdwcL5EVophw,Barbora S.,"Bickford Park, Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Poor, at times rude, service combined with un-imaginative plates made this a disappointing dining experience. We will never return. Modavie left an impression of a one trick pony, able to technically cook a proper meal yet lacking any creativity to make it a culinary destination worthy of returning patronage. A real disappointment considering the quality of restaurants like Garde Manger just around the corner.Our Experience::We made New Years Eve reservations after reading the positive reviews online of the restaurant. When we mentioned we had reservations upon arrival, the front of house manager looked at us and gruffly asked, ""You know it's a $95/plate meal tonight right?"" Both dressed well, (me in a dress and designer boots and my partner in a suit,) I'm not sure if he asked this because we looked younger (we're in our mid twenties) or because we are a same sex couple. Our waitress was polite and seemed like a nice person but showed little to no knowledge of the menu. When we asked what she would recommend off the prix-fixe menu she said, ""Umm one of the first two?"" She also questioned me when I ordered a cocktail off the menu because she admired she didn't know the restaurant made the drink.Being more cocktail drinkers than wine drinkers, we were disappointed with the lack of quality and selection of cocktails. The bar couldn't even make a standard ""old fashioned"" because they lacked the ingredients.Being New Years the chef was serving a prix-fixe menu.The starter was a large prawn with a salad finished with caviar. The prawn was tasty and well prepared, however the salad consisted of leaves and globs of dressing that wasn't even tossed to coat the leaves and some caviar tossed carelessly on top. The flavor of the salad was lackluster and showed a real apathy on part of the kitchen in my opinion.During our starter the front of house manager came to greet all the tables except for ours, yet another indication of rudeness. Our mains were technically well prepared in that the sear on the beef was a perfect medium rare and the fish was juicy and flaky. The accompanying vegetables were also soundly technically prepared however lacked any imagination. The most interesting part of the dish was a beet root mash. Otherwise, the filet mignon had a rather boring flavorless sauce, and was presented with salted roasted potatoes and steamed bok choy with two asparagus springs. My partners fish had much of the same except for rice rather than potatoes.Each dish tasted good but would never stand out as interesting, creative and exceptionally prepared. Instead I had the impression that this is a restaurant that seems to have fallen asleep and is riding off the ability to cook consistently to clientelle that isn't looking to be wowed and intrigued by their meals.Our desert was possibly the best part of our meal. The chocolate mousse was beautifully flavored, not too sweet with a deep chocolate flavor that was never bitter. The only complaint was that the accompanying orange sorbet did little to elevate and add to the dish. Considering the bill came to over $300 we left feeling our money could have been better spent at another restaurant more engaged in providing a stand out experience. Conclusion:: this is a good place to take a boring aunt interested in stuck up service and run of the mill dishes but for a true dining experience that will leave you impressed skip Modavie and head to Garde Manger down the street."

I made a reservation so we were promptly seated in the upstairs section. They play live jazz between 7-10pm on the upstairs level so it was a lovely setting for our dinner. We ordered a couple cocktails to start, one French Mojito and a Cosmopolitan, which Modavie makes slightly different adding Cointreau-which for me left a strange taste almost like black licoroce. I wasn't a fan of that cocktail.I started with the bean and octopus salad which was large enough for toe people to share. The octopus had a lemon zest marinade and was delicious. I do have to mention it was served cold I would have preferred a grilled version. The salad was overall a good starter with the accompaniment of warm bread and butter.My boyfriend had the pasta with chicken and pancetta and I ordered the catch of the day- sea bass with risotto and vegetables. I didn't enjoy either entree. The pasta was a generous portion but to me felt very slimey and I didn't like the roasted peppers- but I think this is my preference.  The catch of the day was very bland with too much salt which overpowered the dish. I also didn't enjoy the side of cucumber tomato with some kind of vinegar dressing. I just don't think the whole fish dish came together very well.Overall I give Modavie a 3, I did like the ambience and live jazz. I would not return for the food-although apparently their lamb is a big hit. Overall I think there are better places for dinner in Old Montreal."

We had asked for plates to eat our appetizers since when they set the table, only three of us had any table settings. The plates never came. By the time we could locate the server, we were done with the apps. Next came the waiting game for the entrees. We were falling asleep waiting for the food while the server kept giving us empty promises that the food would be out shortly. I didn't realize shortly meant an hour and fifteen minutes. The worst part of this all was the food came out lukewarm and dry. As if they had been sitting there for an hour and fifteen minutes... There was nothing special about the food. Mediocre at best. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless they wanted to waste money on an underwhelming meal, kill 3 hours for no reason and end their night in disappointment."

/user_details?userid=FZ5hWV7id7jc2fKjXnMHOg,Kelly B.,"Knoxville, TN",5 star rating,Valentine's dinner was extra special here!  The atmosphere is wonderful--beautiful building with exceptional music.  We started with cocktails and the meat and cheese platters as starters. They were both excellent--the cheeses especially stood out.  The lamb chops and duck confit were our choices for the main and they did not disappoint.  Dessert was tiramisu and creme brûlée with lovely coffees and port. The service was extraordinary and we had a wonderful conversation with Lorenzo.  He exemplifies what restaurant ownership should be.  It is very rare to see this type of hands-on customer service in this day and age.  Try this restaurant if you get a chance--you won't regret it!
/user_details?userid=MurRkRS5aYaa1IfaRY20_Q,Denis S.,"Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"I absolutely loved this place! Easily my favorite restaurant in my trip so far.  And since is my last dinner in Canada, the best dinner of the Unfortunetaly we came too early for the live jazz (which starts at 7:30) but they were still playing recorded jazz over there speakers, and that definitely set a great mood. First the service.  I've noticed that in Quebec there is a certain snootiness.  Maybe they are trying too hard to imitate the French, even in their negative traits, but it definitely exists. But not here.  The waiter was super friendly, very fast and really helped the night flow smoothly. As an appetizer we go the brie baked in something, then with some nuts, some sauce and some pears.  Ok, i'm not describing it well at all, but it was awesome!For the main course I got the Greek-style lamb. It came with some vegetables, including this beat puree, and freshly made potato chips.  The lamb was absolutely delicious.  I tried a different lamb dish, that also was delicious.  If you come here, get the lamb.  For dessert we tried the creme brulee.  I completely agree with Leighann F. This was not the best creme brulee I've had.  Not even in the top twenty.  The sugar was too thick and the creme was too clumpy.  I'm told that means they cooked it for too long.  The taste was fine, but the texture was just off. However, I also got the blueberry tea, which it turns out doesn't have any blueberries in it, but is made of Grand Marnier, Amaretto and hot Orange pekoe tea.  It gets its name because it smells and even tastes amazingly like blueberries.  Definitely something I'm going to ask for in the future! Overall, amazing experience.  Good for a date or a nice evening out."

/user_details?userid=JMP9JY5JV2HfWn8ClTBb6A,Matthew T.,"Bradenton, FL",3 star rating,"Maybe it is because I had higher expectations for Modavie based on other yelp reviews, but this place is a solid 3 star and I was a little disappointed as my expectations weren't met.  Good but not great.  Reviews says it isn't really a touristy place even though it is right on the edge of the highest concentration of touristy shops in old town.  On the plus side, the waiter was great.  Made a good suggestion for a bottle of wine based on what I told him I like and didn't try to go crazy on the price.  Points there.  He was attentive without being obtrusive and just seemed like a nice guy not only to us but the tables around us.  The arugala salad was great as well as the brie.  The problem was my lamb shank.  And it really isn't a problem, but on the menu they say lamb is their specialty.  And the lamb shank was pretty boring.  No real flavor or soul.  And I think it really hadn't been braised long enough. It was kind of like meat pellets in fat.  Now I've had braised lamb shank many other places where it is tender and lovely and flavorful.  This was not, this seemed like a poor rendition of the most basic version of a braise.  Maybe I should have had the chops or the rack of lamb, but done right I think the shank is better than those cuts.  So maybe just a bad night.  But for something that is supposed to the ""speciality""  they got to lose a star for that.  If you are going to claim to be in the big leagues you better put it out there and do it consistently.  The jazz band that was playing was good, not too load, but boy was it hot upstairs, some fans or open a window would have helped a lot.  Should have sat downstairs and watch people walk buy."

The decor and atmosphere is certainly inviting and I can see how this place can be a tourist trap, ourselves included.The steak I had was tasty and so was the salmon dish I tasted, but beyond that the general consensus at our table was that the food wasn't anything exceptional.Service was a tad slow at times, but it was friendly and patient especially when we all tried to figure out how much to throw down for the tab."

The ambiance is warm and relaxed, with smooth jazz playing in the background.  Apparently every night they have two live jazz shows however my friend and I ate before the shows started.   As Denis S mentioned regarding the snootiness in some Quebec restaurants, that is completely absent in Modavie.  The maitre d' and waitress were friendly and very attentive throughout our dining experience. The French onion soup was good but nothing to write home about.  The lamb is their specialty - I opted for the rack of lamb with sesame, goat cheese, and Dijon mustard served with crispy chips and vegetables.  The lamb was cooked just right ( I go for medium) and seasoned well and the large piece of goat cheese was lightly singed for a nice partially melted taste to compliment the lamb.  When I come back to Montreal I will definitely revisit Modavie and hopefully have room for dessert the second time around."

Yes the jazz music is a nice touch but the food by Montreal standards was just ok. We have the calamari which was good but same as anywhere else and I had the chicken drumette which was decent but not great by any means. My friend even commented that the place is just like a british pub and what we had tastes like pub food. Sorry but this place is not worth the prices they charge. There are much better places in the city.

A quick check with the hotel's concierge resulted in more personal recommendation. It was very easy to find and we didn't regret it at all. The service was delightful and very professional. The food was very satisfying with decent sized portions and very nice setting. They claim they have the best french onion soup in all of Montreal - not sure if that's exactly true, but that was definitely on par with the best one we tried before. Restaurant is very trendy decorated and is very intimate and cozy. Music itself somewhat disappointed - musician didn't sound exactly professional - but they have different musicians each day - you might get more lucky. Nevertheless, we didn't regret it a bit.Make sure you get a reservation in advance - they do get booked.They are on more expensive side than most other places around. Still, relatively inexpensive by US standards."

It was New Year's Day so being one of the few restaurants that was open it was really busy. Our waitress was great I only wish that the food was too. We had the mushroom risotto which lacked flavor and the shrimp and scallop linguine. Neither of which we finished or wanted to bring home. The linguini had what I think was tuna mixed into it and completely overpowered the dish. I wish that that was also listed in the description because I probably would not have ordered it. The scallops were also very overcooked. The salads were good the bread was good and the service was good just wish that maybe we would have ordered other items. Maybe it was an off night for us but if we return we will try something else.
/user_details?userid=yl9maAbNWhG7VqK5MxmCYA,Samik S.,"Pennington, NJ",2 star rating,"My first Yelp review:The two-star ""Meh. I've experienced better."" describes this place perfectly.The place certainly has a nice decor. We were placed at a cozy, yet slightly cramped corner, facing a nice Ray Charles poster. We were sitting slightly behind the jazz music but could still appreciate it. Not at all a jazz connoisseur, I still enjoyed the music, especially the singer's voice.At first, the waitress approached our table every ~2 minutes asking if we were ready to order. And no, we were not. After a long day of drinking and being tourists, we appreciate a moment of peace. We were by no means taking a while, but she felt that were slow at everything. At least that's what it seemed like because she then began to take much too long between appearances.I ordered the filet mignon appetizer. If I'm correct, it was literally greens, olive oil, a little shaved parmesan, and thinly sliced filet mignon. My only way to describe this was average. Slightly bland but a little fatty. Parmesan and greens stole the dish, not the filet mignon, which was disappointing.I got the braised lamb millefeuille and a glass of the cab-sauv as my main dish. It tasted like a dish from Applebee's or some other American chain, in my opinion. The lamb was moist but just not very good, to be frank. The vegetables were mediocre too. The millefeuille was the best part, as it was slightly soaked in the lamb's juices, making it melt in your mouth.Slow service, mediocre dishes, slightly balanced by a nice decor and enjoyable live music make this restaurant miss-able on your trip to Motreal."

We actually decided to go here last minute since it was like right next to the Marriott we stayed in. What a pleasant surprise! We shared  the octopus salad with white beans for appetizer and that was very refreshing and plenty of octopus in the salad. Then, I had the duck confit and my husband had their signature rack of lamb with goat cheese. Now, the duck confit was amazing; super juicy dark meat, crispy skin and just enough duck fat, yum yum yum. As for the rack of lamb, it's their signature dish for a reason; medium rare was cooked to perfection, beautifully seasoned and super tender and delicious even for me who's not crazy about lamb to begin with. And for dessert, I ordered their pana cotta and cappuccino. When they brought the pana cotta out, it wasn't pretty with red raspberry or brown caramel, so I was a bit disappointed. But that initial disappointment disappeared in a flash as soon as I had my first bite. OMG, their pana cotta was sooooo creamy and just perfect with my cappuccino. I'm so glad I went for dessert even though I was already pretty full. But then again, I always have another stomach for dessert. Anyway, good service, amazing food, definitely give it a shot if you're in the area."

There was nothing wrong with either of the dishes, but there was also nothing special about them. My lamb was served with some sautéed green beans and a stack of potatoes with goat cheese.

Seeing the multitude of positive reviews we gave it a shot and all I can say is WOW. The live Jazz that greeted us as we walked into the restaurant was an intimate and warm touch. Our waitress Caroline was quite pleasant and offered her honest and candid suggestions. Every aspect of the meal was delicious. For starters we had the salmon crostini and fried calamari which was quite flavorful. I ordered the soup du jour which happened to be a tomato soup (I loved it). The bread and butter combo was perfect. For our main course my wife ordered the lamb burger which was perfectly cooked. I ordered the lamb chops (apparently a restaurant specialty). At the suggestion of Caroline I got them cooked medium rare and they were quite tasty. One of my friend's happened to order the Duck Confit (another specialty) which he enjoyed as well. To finish it off, for dessert I ordered the creme brulee and my wife ordered the chocolate fondant with vanilla ice cream. It was the perfect cap to a wonderful dining experience. I'm sure Montreal has a slew of fine dining options, but if you're looking for excellent food in an intimate setting, you can't go wrong with Modavie."

The host (Lorenzo?) was very welcoming and friendly giving us a lovely table on the second floor. The reason I have it less stars was because my salad and entree came out at the same time, after our calamari that was very well prepared. In addition,my risotto was not the right consistency (very dry) nor was it fully cooked. Husband requested medium for his lamb that came highly recommended but was well done. He did not mind it one bit because it was well prepared. It was I. A great spot and the service was good and the ambiance lively, but the food did not quite meet a 4 or 5 star rating."

/user_details?userid=ioxWgw3mizEQzArOWgNixg,Sloan B.,"Winnipeg, Canada",3 star rating,"This restaurant has a lot going for it! The ambiance was very nice, great decor, and the food was fantastic. Unfortunately, the live jazz is only upstairs, and despite the speakers throughout playing the live tunes, (which were fantastic) it wasn't the romantic jazz experience I had hoped for. The service is the main reason I did not give 5 stars. When we were seated, we were not greeted from a waiter/waitress for 15 minutes. This means no water on the table, not even a look of acknowledgment. There were 2 waiters surrounding us and that were frequently tending to others which made it awkward and left us confused. After finally getting some service  we  ordered everything at once as we had such a long time to mull over the menu. From then, we waited another 45 minutes until we were tended to again. At this point, our charcuterie board arrived and only one onion soup, even though we ordered two. Our drinks had been empty for 20 minutes and no one cared to notice, offer us another, or another look at the drink menu. Eventually, we had to attract a different waitress to help us, as the service seemed impossible. Our onion soup dishes sat there for around ten minuets before being taken away. Perhaps they started to realize things were not up to snuff and started to be more attentive. This made us feel much better but the dinner took over 2 hours. Yes we were vacationing here and were not in a hurry but such horrible service for an upscale restaurant it not acceptable. Our meals and dessert were delicious so our experience got better and better throughout the evening. I am sad to write this review as I had such high hopes for this place."

I personally had the brie puff pastry (which was good, but perhaps a bit too sweet as an appetizer) and the Mediterranean seabass (which was good, but not great). Others ordered the mesclun goat cheese salad (which was really amazing!) and the braised lamb millefeuille (which was ok, but the portion was quite generous!).

/user_details?userid=5Vq8IKr0glGCRGjNPeoc6A,Kevin M.,"Oakland, CA",2 star rating,"Popped in for the Old Port Dinner Specials during the month of January while I was visiting my hometown for 2 weeks. We arrived 30 minutes early before our reservation at 1830 - most tables had reserved signs but since we got in before the big rush we had first choice (and sat right next to where the jazz duo would later perform). They were the highlight of the night.As a young couple in our mid-20's we received the service we normally get - sub-par. We needed afew extra minutes to order as my girlfriend went to the washroom soon after arriving. Afew extra minutes turned into about 10 minutes. When he did pop by, he seemed annoyed to answer questions about the menu. Not the first time I've experienced a waiter give lousy service because he believes that because we're young people that we're going to not tip appropriately for good service. Carrying on...We ordered the three courses right away: 2x Mesclun salad with goat cheese on croutons topped with apple cider dressing, 1x Tiger shrimp with a cajun style sauce, 1x Rack of lamb with goat cheese, Dijon mustard and sesame and 2x Tiramisu. 1/2 litre of the Cab-Merlot and a glass of the house wine.The salad was tasty, she felt the tiger shrimp had too much sauce and the rack of lamb was tasty though difficult to eat (shank may have been the better bet). The waiter dropped off the Tiramisu's and then promptly disappeared. No coffee or espresso offered. He returned when we both finished and asked how it was: I told him flat out that I would have enjoyed a coffee with the dessert but he neglected to ask. He had offered then but I refused as the moment had passed.It was after that when we waited far too long to pay for the meal. I've learned through the years that paying more doesn't necessarily yield a better meal. This is definitely the case with Modavie as a young couple. The live music was brilliant, food was mediocre (as compared to Lola Rosa where we can eat for a fraction of the price) and the service was disrespectful.We filled out a commentary card which the waiter glanced at when we left the table though I doubt this will break the view waiters have of Gen-Y. Chicken or the egg? Young people don't tip or young people get bad service so they don't tip?Young couples/foodies beware!"

The escargot, an easy texture lacking the chewy quality you often get with the dish, sat atop a puff pastry in a light cream sauce. The lamb shank was buttery soft, bursting with flavor and coated in a light peppery spice. The creme brulee, though admittedly hard to mess up, was not one of the better versions I've had. The crispy top was extra thick and the creamy portion below was lumpy.The wine list was excellent...great buys in various varietals, alongside some pricey-pricey bottles. Since dinner preceded a night out, we chose a light white, which went with both of our meals and was even more enjoyable as it warmed up a bit.The service at Modavie was a little slow, but very polite. Our waitress even helped us pick out a few places to go dancing after dinner and didn't seem to mind that we were one of the last couples in there. The owner (manager?) kindly thanked us as we left, which we did full, happy and satisfied with our meal and experience at this charming French restaurant."

Modavie is romantic and cozy with white lights strung up (for the holiday season)?I had read that tourists go to Modavie and not locals and that's the vibe I got from the patrons around us. Our waitress was adorable with a thick, French accent. We started with a bowl of French onion soup and  1/2 a Mediterranean salad (feta, olives, artichokes, smoked salmon on mescaline). Both were really good. For entrees I had the roasted shank of lamb and my husband had a cut of beef he had never tried before. Husband's beef was stringy and not that good but my lamb was excellent. We ended with chocolate molten cake with vanilla ice cream. The word ""orgasmic"" best sums up the dessert.I really enjoyed Modavie.

It was at the request of my associate (whom has been a previous patron) that we sit upstairs as the live jazz singer was a little loud while sitting downstairs.  But, the stage is upstairs... he assured me he knew what he was doing.  As we sat in the power table in the corner with two beautiful windows overlooking Rue St Paul, we talked about the day's meetings and discussed the future.I started off my meal with a goat cheese and arugula salad with a citrus vinigrette.  While the goat cheese was not in the salad per se, (came melted atop small pieces of baguette) their flavor carried into each bite.  The vinigrette cut right through the tanginess of the goat cheese with tastes of pepper from the arugula.    Upon next fillet Mignon.  Cooked to a perfect rare, this steak was succulent. With a small portion of risotto and sauted veggies to go along with it, I was a happy camper.  The name of the wine we had escapes me but I remember it went well with the steak.  Modavie being a wine/ jazz bar there will be no shortage of choices when looking for that perfect bottle."

The place looked nice from the outside and the reviews were good so we decided to try it out. The place was about 1/3 empty at that time (around 10pm), so we were sure we won't have a problem getting a table. The Asian hostess asked if we have a reservation, and when I said no she said that we can't come in, and that ""the kitchen is closing in 20 minutes"". Really?!? There were plenty of seats, no line, and yet she didn't even bother asking if we are going to eat or just drink, but it was clear she just wanted us out of the door under any excuse. Not sure why, as we looked just like typical tourists that visit that place. Maybe she was a Red Sox fan and didn't like my Yankees hat, lol. But that would have been ok with us if it wasn't for an Asian family of 5 that walked in about a minute after us, and the hostess asked them to wait a minute while she went to get them a table without a reservation (I asked them while she walked away and they said they didn't need a reservation). That's where I draw the line. Its one thing to have certain rules but completely another reason to discriminate and lie to your customers. But its ok, we ended up going to another place in the area which was just as well rated and spent our money there. Thought of complaining to management at first, but in the end realized that they're punishing themselves with this attitude. There are plenty of nice restaurant and bars in the area who don't treat their customers like this."

And the chops.Between walls of wine, a warm atmosphere and swirls of jazz in the air tie the experience together perfectly. Take your pick between the downstairs wine bar and the upstairs dining room with live band. The music is lively but not distracting from intimate conversation. No yelling over the table necessary. I will continue to return when in town."

We split a bottle of wine, reasonably priced, ordered some really good pasta and listened to the beautiful live music that was at the restaurant. My only caveat is that the service was a bit slow, albeit it is understandable because it  was really busy and we had to make a reservation that morning to get a table. The couple next to us kept giving judgy looks, given that the tables were a bit close, but the food/wine/music combo all made up for it. Highly recommend this!"

/user_details?userid=rTS_h49Q1Sofn-zUZdf_Sw,Ryan L.,"Seattle, WA",4 star rating,"Some reviews have said this place is nothing more than tourist trap. Well, this section of town does draw tourists, so expect a lot of tourists here. Is it a cookie-cutter place that serves overcooked food to throngs of tour bus crowds that are disembarked at its front door? No. This is a quality establishment serving great food.I'm not easily impressed with food and am a bit of a ""foodie"" if you want to label. I'm even more difficult to impress when it comes to service. Modavie impressed me all-around.We were seated at a window, which was nice, but the whole atmosphere in the place was charming and fit the ambience of the surroundings of Old Montreal. Our server was right over to take drink orders but was sure to not rush us, which was greatly appreciated as we could see them turning people away at the door who did not have reservations.My meal came from the Table d'Hote section of the menu, so it included a salad, soup, and an entree. The mushroom soup I enjoyed was absolutely one of the best I've had. Perfectly seasoned with a nice woodsy-earthy taste - perhaps some chantrelle mushrooms in there. Loved it. My entree was the filet mignon with a king crab leg. I've not had any kind of land meat for nearly four years, but for some reason I was drawn to it on this menu. It was amazing, albeit a little more done than the ""medium"" temperature I had requested. It was a very flavorful cut of beef served atop a spot of risotto alongside a sweet potato puree. Our server was patient with our somewhat rusty French and was jovial, polite, and professional throughout the evening. He clearly knew about the dishes on the menu and could effectively answer all of our questions. If you're looking for an out-of-the-way restaurant, this is not it, so don't expect a place that isn't full of tourists. You're in the wrong neighborhood for that. Duh! But this isn't The Keg or some other chain restaurant that you can visit back home. That's down the street. Enjoy the atmosphere at this gem and I think you'll enjoy the meal as well."

However, we weren't looking for foie gras, but a menu with a wide selection of pastas, meats, and seafood from a restaurant with good reviews.  Modavie, it turns out, was all that and more. We were able to make a reservation for 8:30 p.m. even though we didn't call until 2:30 that afternoon.  Even without the reservation, I think the wait would have been minimal.  Tables were turned over fast, but at no point did we ever feel rushed.Upon arrival, we were sat at an amazing table in the corner of the second floor, overlooking Rue St.-Paul and all of Old Montreal.  We had jazz on one side of us, the beauty of Vieux Port on the other, and a lively but not overly loud atmosphere all around.  Our waiter was personable and friendly, with a thick French-Canadian accent.  He was helpful and attentive throughout the service, even going so far as to tell me NOT to get the Osso Bucco because he thinks it is too tough and can't recommend it.   I ended up getting lamb, a house specialty, but more on that later. We began with cocktails paired appetizers of French Onion Soup Gratinee and fried calamari.  Both were very solid starts to the meal, with the soup being very beefy tasting with satisfying layers of cheese and toasted bread.  The calamari were fried to a dark golden brown, but stayed tender and were served with a spicy marinara and coconut milk-lime sauce.  Though both were good, they ended up being ""only"" average compared to the rest of the meal. Among the three of us, we were able to try three different proteins prepared in three very different ways.  Tagliatelle with chicken and pancetta in a truffle oil sauce was as savory, rich and umami-filled as it sounds.   The ""AAA+ Angus hangar steak with a cabernet sauvignon wine butter sauce"" was nearly as equally decadent, with the wine and butter sharing equal billing on the sauce complimenting a perfectly grilled and sliced hanger steak.  The highlight for me was my own meal, as I went with the specialty of the house, lamb.  After sorting through the five selections, I went with the rack of lamb with goat cheese, Dijon mustard and sesame seeds.  The waiter informed me that it was the best one on the menu, and he wasn't kidding - it was the best lamb I've ever had anywhere.   The meat was perfectly cooked and the flavors blended wonderfully.  The small round of toasted goat cheese served over fresh vegetables paired with it perfectly. We partnered the meal with a Mission Hill 2007 Cab-Merlot blend  which was pleasantly spicy.  The fantastic meal ended on a high note, as we were able to watch the fireworks competition display right from our table as we enjoyed apertifs and three lovely desserts: creme brulee, tiramisu, and chocolate fondant (warm chocolate cake).  From the service to the location, to the food, this is a meal that we will be talking about for a long time, recalling very fond memories."

As a result, I ate a few that were full of sandy thick grey mud. Sadly that wasn't the only problem, they weren't cooked properly, half of them were unopened, a few of the ones I ate, tasted like uncooked oysters.

I choose the same options as the first time - beet salad and steak-fries, but had completely different meal quality and experience. The steak was too thin, I would say 5mm, and fries were almost cold. The beet salad (goat cheese, candied walnuts) came with two small pieces of cheese and very few nuts, but with a lot of tasteless beet. I was very disappointed and apologized to my guests for this bad experience.  We also ordered duck confit that was OK.  Catch of the day (red snapper) and quinoa salad were just mediocre, nothing special. The presentation was terrible. It appeared to be prepared in a hurry. Overall, the meal quality was comparable to fast-food"

The red wine that we splurged on was brought over from the fridge (seemed a bit odd) to the point of us having to ask for it to be decanted. I ended up holding it in my lap to warm it up a bit more. We'd decided on an onion soup and salad to start. Basic, to the point.  Lamb was their specialty, so we thought the chops looked good. They did, but they weren't particularly flavourful, nor warm. I wanted to really enjoy the meal, the ambiance, but it was a miss."

The food was good and the service was excellent. When we were leaving it started to downpour which forced us to take up a seat at the bar and have another glass of wine.  The bartender was very nice and helped us with directions. It's a bit off the beaten down tourist trap path which makes it extra nice.  We saved the best stop for last in Montreal.

It is located near the port where all the main shops and lively streets are. We were greeted at the door by Lorenzo. Lorenzo was the kindest person and made sure our service was nothing but perfection from the moment we walked in until the moment we left! The waitress we had too was very excited about the food, answered our many questions about the different meals and was always attentive. We had French onion soup to start which was delicious. Our main meals were the rack of lamb, duck confit, and mushroom risotto. It was all so beautifully presented and very tasty! They also have Jazz nights every night of the week, sometimes on their second floor and other times on the main floor. Even though we didn't sit where the jazz was that night, we could still hear the performance and it added to the experience. Overall the place is beautiful, the food was excellent, and best of all, the service was perfect. This is a MUST in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=JLdxmsngE7cjrwNT7zqgyQ,Clare L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This place is great for live jazz, some good eats, and decent selection of wines. In terms of highlights, I do love their calamari, as well as their goat cheese salad.  On different occasions, the bands or singers have been awesome! The interior is gorgeous, and the staff has been wonderful. The cuisine, I wouldn't consider really french, it's kind of like a contemporary fusion of Mediterranean and a selection of pastas.  They offer lamb, bison, and seafood for a range of types of dishes. Their choices for vegetarians could stand to be improved upon but in general the food is okay.During the summertime it is busy and bustling, and during peak dinner rushes can be pretty loud. As for the tourist factor, it seems like a fair amount of tourists do dine there, but if you like Jazz like I do, locals do dine here too."

Both the maitre d' and server were friendly, cordial, and bilingual.  I would recommend and return on a future trip."

Love the atmosphere, somehow dim but well lit, very warm feeling and interesting to look around the room without being chaotic. Fits the street perfectly too, St Paul is a great place to walk through small galleries and shops in the Old Port of Montreal. The music is great too. Jazz bands typically led by beautiful and talented francophone women. I definitely recommend sitting upstairs so you can enjoy the live music. The food is excellent as well. No bad choices from my experience, but I think the lamb is the best I've had. There's a full page of lamb on the menu and it's their specialty. That being said I'd have a lot of things there that aren't lamb, and I've never been disappointed.Another great thing is that they work to get you in. I showed up with my wife for New Years without a reservation and though they were jammed they made it work. They had to speed up our service a bit, but let us know before hand what to expect, and didn't push us at all during the meal. i really have nothing but great things to say, and i recommend this place to everyone I know who's going to Montreal."

I asked if we could sit at the bar and wait for a table, she repeated again very rudely that the bar was reservation only as well and if we chose to sit at the bar it would be up to an hour wait for our food to come. I was appalled. The manager needs to be made aware of this immediately. I felt she was discriminating against us as Americans and she treated me so badly we left immediately. Had she been nice and accommodating we would have sat at the bar and bought a bottle of expensive wine and enjoyed a nice meal.
