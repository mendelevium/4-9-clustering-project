/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Got the jerk sandwhich and it was delicious. The chicken was tender and the sandwhich was juicy and full of flavor. The staff was nice and friendly. The wait wasn't too long. Would definitely come again.
/user_details?userid=Wmh9vK9LX-sxeuTb6vzM2A,Christine U.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love this place. I don't come here enough for how close it is to my apartment. A friend brought me here the first time because he is friends with the owner and I immediately loved the layout and ambiance. A lot of mix between sitting/standing/couch-ing areas makes it a good place to hang out for any time of the evening. I've come for dinner because the food is really tasty. They do naan pizzas well. The butter chicken one is always on the menu but they also have a special on the board normally. Crispy potatoes, eggplant curry, ribs and jerk chicken are also all good. I think they serve food until 11ish, so it's a good place for a later bite. There's some fun cocktail options and a solid beer list. One of the few places that keeps decent sours on the menu (although it would be cool if they rotated them a bit more, as much as I love sour french kiss.) It can get really busy here on the weekends, particularly when there's something happening in Place des Arts, but *normally* if you're not a huge group you can get in eventually."
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Super fun place to go and have a few drinks and a couple of bites. Sit at the bar where the bartenders are. They are really cool! We had a busy week both my husband and I and wanted an evening enjoying ourselves. We opted for this bar and were really impressed by the food! To start, shared an Indian eggplant appetizer that came with naan bread. It was bomb y'all! Just the perfect amount of spice and texture. Then we ordered creole pork ribs griot style that had pikliz and fried plantains on the side. Delicious and fun to eat! We took our time, we laughed and two hours later, we were really happy and ready to move onto another Friday project lol! Our total order considered of 3 beers, 1 spritz, 2 glasses of wine, 1 gin tonic along with our snacks that summed up to about 120$ with taxes and tips included. Not too bad if you ask. A treat well deserved in my opinion:)"
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Have you ever been in a relationship where you are constantly trying to get your interest's attention and finally when you do it's worth the wait? I went on a date with Bar Pamplemousse and it felt like that-totally worth the wait! This place books up fast - I got lucky for an 8 pm reservation on a weekday as there were two spots available at the bar. The ambiance is great- I was thankful that I got seating even though I was up near the bar. I had little knowledge that they had great selection of beers and food! Not your traditional food menu either- but a twist on Indian classics like butter chicken pizza (16$) served on naan bread sprinkled with feta (so good), or egg plant curry (aubergine bharta-8$) this was delicious but you will understand why if you shine light on your dish- hello OIL! We also had a side of seasoned potatoes but they're no longer on the menu. For dessert-ready? goat cheese cheese cake (6$)! I am a sucker for goat cheese so I was a bit apprehensive to try this unique dish at first. It was an interesting flavor with a bite of cheesecake with a tangy/sour aftertaste typical of goat cheese.Check this place out! Just don't use opentable to collect points here because the staff is clueless of confirming you in."
/user_details?userid=jpF5VxuG9moPTZzDfAPuSA,Tram L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I heard this place was opening, with names like ""dude from Joe Beef"" and ""dude from Mal Neccesaire"" it sounded promising :PWe stopped by on a Wednesday evening after an art show at the SAT. The place is cute, simply decorated and feels laid backThe cocktail list isn't as diverse as I thought it would be, with the reputation of Le Mal Neccesaire but if you have a drink in mind, the bartender will gladly make it for u. I don't drink beers so I can't speak for that but the beer menu looked pretty interesting! I ordered the Donde Mis Zapatos (lol!!!) and it was alright, not bad but nothing to write home about either.We ordered the jerk cauliflower, the tandoori wings and roasted asparagus. I think the food was my prefered part, everything was very well seasoned and balanced in flavor. Deliciousness!!!!! I'd come back for some more food ya!"
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I really like the vibe at Bar Pamplemousse!  This place is great for a 5@7 or a small bite or a late night drink! They have a special price for 5@7, there is a dj and a large selection of drinks including cocktails, bottles of bubbly, wines and beers. I heard that they have a vast selection of local beers but I alot of them were from Dieu du Ciel which I can buy at the supermarket. Although there are beers from several microbreweries, I thought their would be even more. They have a small food menu of sharing plates. We ordered the roasted cauliflower and the butter chicken deep dish pizza,which paired well with our beers! The food was very good, it's worth getting a dish with your drinks.I really liked this place and  will definitely be back!"
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Their shrimp cerviche with grapefruit, sliced Jalapenos, finely diced tomatoes, and a citrus ponzu-style marinade was the good part.It was on a bed of mashed sweet potato and carrots - which did not match the flavor profile at all. The tostada got soggy from sitting in the juice (as this was a take out order). They may want to consider another way of packaging it to go, and surely serve the sweet potato carrot dish as a side option - lacked any specific seasoning and even salt, but could be worked into a better stand alone  'side' dish. Perhaps it already is... PS Can't seem to find it while glance through the menu.  PPS Their menu alone gets a thumbs-up, for uniqueness"
/user_details?userid=LRKmxCcf6ZkxyujPdmp5zQ,Hannah B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I was hard-pressed between reviewing these guys with a three or four stars- could have easily been a three and a half. First of all, I love the space. The host was sweet enough to talk about the creative process for the interior design: they wanted to challenge the standard overly masculine design that accompanies pretty much every beer bar ever. Needless to say, they nailed it. The modernist pastels accompanied by comfy open spaces is a strong point here.Where things fell flat for me was the product. On both visits to Pamplemousse I've found the alcohol selection just ok. Nothing surprising, nothing mind-blowing- which is a bit of a bummer if it's not happy hour. The food really relies on the naan pizzas and dessert (and even then we were hard pressed to finish our salty pizza)- the main dishes were otherwise poorly executed. I'm thinking here particularly to the griot ribs- because the dish is done with ribs instead of a larger cut of pork it's hard to detect any of the merits of (what should be) a committed marinating. The dish instead relies on an overbearing sauce, defeating the purpose of griot being a well developed piece of meat in of itself.Gripes aside about the food, it's a lovely place with decent service. The crowd on a Friday night was rather young and packed in for my tastes (I'm in my late twenties) but maybe I just wasn't ready for the full pamplemousse experience."
/user_details?userid=yACLb6lUDPjw0g5JrNwXMg,Kyle S.,"Atlanta, GA",5 star rating,"Went to Montreal for a weekend getaway with a coworkers birthday and this place hit the spot. They have an extensive cocktail menu, and the food there is amazing. We went a bit later, around 830pm, and though we made a reservation, they didn't seat us until 930, which was kind of annoying. But they comped a round of drinks and one of our food items, so they redeemed themselves. We had about 5 or 6 items on the menu to share, and those that I'd recommend would be the following:Roasted Jerk CauliflowerButter Chicken Naan PizzaNaan with truffle butter (not on the menu)The others were good, but I think these 3 were the best and not something you can get anywhere else."
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I was seated in the patio; I was super happy about it. Our main waiter was sweet and friendly. You can see he is doing his work with his heart. The host who assigned my seat was a bit of grouch. My table was dirty; so I asked him if someone can wiped it. His initial response was very nonchalant. He did come to clean it afterwards. I also requested him to take a picture of my friend and I from a certain spot. He wasn't that nice about and he decided how he would take the pic and from where. Needless to say, I didn't like my picture. When I opened the menu, I was really stunned how expensive is everything for a tapas type of food. Therefore I didn't dare to order more than one dish. I got a cocktail called Much need vacation with Cachca, grapefruit, verde syrup....in a very very small glass compared to the picture that was in the menu. The drink was delicious despite the size and price. I also got cod fritters, which was not that really good. It was over cooked, the sauce beside was not a good blend with the cod, and there were four pieces. The overall dish was lacking flavor and soul. My two items cost me about 45$. Sadly, Bar Pamplemousse was a let down."

/user_details?userid=za-_E0w58gRS2_9mHicmkQ,Li S.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,We were having a great tonight. The waitress Nadia was amazing with us. The manager shows up at our table to tell us to leave. Told him nobody told us that we had to leave....told him we were eating supper and still drinking. Said too bad had to clear the table for 6:30... forced us to take our bills... while I'm trying to negotiate staying he walked away from me...great service guys. Never again ....hope I can spread the word
/user_details?userid=vvJH48TP3zCKj7YZ0u36pw,Julia P.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Came here on a freezing, raining Friday night and I am so pleased we did! I warmed up right away and was feeling the discotheque vibes. The food menu was quite eclectic and a fusion of Indian and Caribbean flavors. The jerk chicken with Mac and Cheese was ridiculously flavorful and juicy. The Butter Chicken Na'an pizza was a Yelp highlight and didn't disappoint. Our waiter, Matthieu, said it was his first shift yet the menu through and through and made some thoughtful recommendations for local beers."
/user_details?userid=Mm89zLyIl0BxAP3-9sqPow,Philip P.,"Memphis, TN",5 star rating,I had the excellent jerk chicken and two glasses of really good Northeast IPA. it was kind of noisy but I can't blame them for that they sell good stuff.
/user_details?userid=-20V6B4gfxBcHw1g-ZSQ5Q,Pamela F.,"Long Beach, CA",5 star rating,"Wow. I knew this restaurant would be good every seeing posts on Instagram and taking to people who have been. What I wasn't prepared for was... well, everything! The moment you walk in, the vibe is cool, sexy, inviting. You're drawn in by the smiling staff, on a Monday night the beats of an unreal DJ (made me feel like I was gone in Long Beach CA) and the good times being enjoyed by the clientele. The service was attentive and the employees were obviously enjoy working here. There was even an impromptu dance party next to my table when one of the chefs couldn't resist busting a groove for his favorite jam.The star of this restaurant, as it should be, is the food. It was inspired, honest, sexy, thoughtful, and moving. I've never thought that way about a beet before, and I love beets! Every bite was more incredible than the last. Lucy (my wonderful server), I apologize for the moaning! I also had the cauliflower, which was the perfect mix of savory, sweet and spicy. With the eggplant you get the homey taste of slow cooking with the well balanced combination of flavors and textures that elevates the dish. The halibut gravlax were salty refreshing and bright. I was 2 cocktails in at this point (one of which was made by the chef and blew my mind) , and feeling satisfied and quite full. How can you refuse the offer of dessert when it's goat cheese cheesecake? The answer is you don't, and I didn't! It was nothing short of revelatory. The funky creamy goodness of the filling, the sweet nuttiness of the almond crust, and topped with grated goat cheddar? Who could dream such a thing? The talented chef behind it, Montréal chef Pélo Tsavoussis. My only regret is I forgot my boxed up eggplant that I was going to eat for breakfast.Thank you, bar pamplemousse, for an amazing experience. Montréal, you can add this place to the top of restaurant experiences in an already great food town."
/user_details?userid=G5qQ5B9IPsOjaC9ED3lrjQ,Jacqueline G.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,Really cool and laid back bar/lounge. We went on a Saturday night in August around 11 pm. It was on the empty side but the DJ was spinning some good sets we enjoyed. The bar tender was friendly and made us good cocktails from the menu. The hubby and I enjoyed our time. It's a nice spot for 30 somethings away from the college kid crowd.Would defintely return here when in Montreal again for a night cap.
/user_details?userid=Z9HuJXXZw3Cc7d--29Yzng,Bonnie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The food and the sevice was good! They would tell you the ingredient of the food which is nice! The beer I ordered had pamplemousse taste which goes well with the food. We were 5 and should've doubled the plates we ordered because one plate was enough for 2-3 to taste but not enough for 5 people! They should change their playlist there because songs were jazzy, the next one was slow, then hip hop which was weird. Place is neat (right next to metro saint-laurent) and you can hang your bags at some tables, but the one I sat on (round) didn't have any place to put my bag, so I had to put it on the floor and my friend held her bag during the whole time (i don't know how she did). You should definitely give it a try if you pass by there!"
/user_details?userid=omSG16AeMvabwK98cFymOA,Nicholas N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow! Delicious food, fantastic drinks, and amazing value. Great for a 5à7, even better for an intimate date.Food: The flavour speaks for itself. The Caribbean-inspired dishes carry an incredible taste, are fun to eat and share, and compliment the vibrant restaurant atmosphere.Drink: Wide selection of amazing beers from local microbrews, great cocktails, and even awesome light-weight/non-alcoholic options (e.g., kombucha and cider)."
/user_details?userid=eHpF3kub-Haksw3WMbKmbg,John A.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"I was just walking around and decided to try it out. The atmosphere right away was very friendly. I was greeted right away and sat near the window. Shortly after reviewing the eclectic menu, I was drawn right away. However what did me over was the service. I believe the waiters name was Malcom, whom gave us such a great experience, it felt like we were being served by a friend, all while being professional. Definitely will be back again thanks to him and the great drinks, bar and price. If you're in the area, check it out!"

/user_details?userid=XILA-PtHX99FNHuMIT6C2g,Sam H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"So this place has a nice, well curated beer list. I wish I could say much more than that. The food our group ordered (to be fair, mostly off-menu specials) was bland across the board. We had a flat-bread that was ostensibly with lobster mushrooms, but they were difficult to find. There's also a fine line between ""wood-fired"" and burnt that was crossed. Croquettes were buried in so much sweet aioli that the frisée and radish salad on top did nothing to lighten the dish, and everyone was a little shocked at the minuscule portion size of the Nordic Shrimp dish. We walked to Boustan after leaving for something more satisfying.The service was friendly at least, and we'd consider coming back just for drinks. The atmosphere definitely skewed to an older crowd - I think we were the only table of people younger than 50."
/user_details?userid=JLQooNvgcN_uk7yuqp_C5g,Luc S.,"Capilano, Edmonton, Canada",5 star rating,"I came in to meet a friend, he ended up working late. I was at the bar alone until I went to meet him. A gentle mean from nyc who works there was friendly and amazing sat me with another gentleman with the same name as me from Vancouver, then a wonderful woman with curly hair who works there sat with us. She was pleasant bought me a shot and gave me some advice in the city. Such a random pleasant experience. 10/10 service I will definitely be back. Being new to Montreal it was an amazing experience. The management and owners should know they have an amazing competent staff. Having previously managed bars I am very impressed."
/user_details?userid=LD0JKpsZQYjJzafeZu_9mw,Nadia C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Popped in because the place looked cute, and now I'm enchanted. What a cozy spot, and so conveniently located. The ambiance is soft but with plenty of panache - gorgeous lamps and mood lighting in the corners. I've tried 2 of the cocktails and both were scrumptious. It is a beer bar though, so prime your palate accordingly. What blew me away was the food. Very flavorful small plates, cooked to perfection. A surprising spice factor that I give 2 thumbs up (after licking them clean of course). The staff was accommodating and friendly, adding to the overall magical vibe. Did I mention the music? An eclectic mix of hip hop and Cuban rhythms. I enjoyed it immensely. If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd be a regular."
/user_details?userid=BzMzriOMTnAQJzTctVEkgA,Erin M.,"Calgary, Canada",4 star rating,"Great little bar with delicious and creative shared plates. The food was excellent. The service was excellent - prompt and friendly. The beers were creative - we really liked the OPA and hibiscus infused beer was inventive albeit didn't meet our personal tastes. We would be interested in returning to try the other creative beers and would recommend this place to a friend. The standout, however, was the food. It was such a pleasant surprise, knowing nothing about the place when we walked by and decided to give it a try. We're glad we did!"
