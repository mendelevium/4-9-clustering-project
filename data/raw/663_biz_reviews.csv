/user_details?userid=bUPeHBFEINhqiKj9-k4-zA,Charles N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Asado, is Latin American inspired restaurant and bar that brings the essence of delicious flavours and the warmth you'd expect from a truly soulful part of the world.Typically, Latin America is home to a wide variety of culinary delights, each with distinctive mixes of spices and fresh ingredients, each with its own unique dishes and specialties to sample, as well as each with its own popular regional condiments.During a local Griffintown gourmet festival, I had the opportunity to try a set menu of tasty Latin-influenced dishes that transcend national borders and regions, where traditional meets modern experiences!The dark and warm decor, makes place for light that gently showcases the beautifully arranged dishes, glows on silent smiles and also shines on the joyful faces of guests engaged in passionate discussions.Although for the festival there were only three choices or apps & mains, the regular menu is filled with different twists on classics, inspired by several methods of cooking on embers where most of the some cocktails and most of the dishes, including desserts will have touch of love from the embers and flames. What did I try?Smoked pineapple with a beer reduction set on a chimichurri purée and and carefully placed pine nuts. Tasty, but slightly heavy on the acidity.Red snapper ceviche ""cooked"" on the spot by the acidity of the like juice, bell peppers, lightly touched by cherry bomb peppers. Amazingly flesh and bright! Charred picanha, a prized cut of meat called sirloin cap that holds amble amounts of flavour and a texture similar to sirloin. Since it has very little fat, it must be cooked to perfection. Amazingly soft but with some chewy spots. Crémeux de bananes with a touch of smoke, financier cake, rosemary and banana chips. I can taste coconuts too?Many thanks to Asado's new chef who dares to experiment, Christina the hawk eye Manager, Tamara who help liven the evening in so many ways, but most importantly one of the owners, Andres, who shared his generous time by joining us at the bar and introducing us to many of his close friends.Definitely need to return and see how the experience will evolve!"

I am including 2 photos in my review... what Asado has advertised on their site and another photo of what was served to me and my boyfriend on my birthday. Paella for 2 for $100 !! The rice was swimming in water and was white (for a $100 I imagined saffron would be included). I could go on regarding one of the worst restaurant experience of my life, but will leave it as I highly do not recommend this place to anyone!"

How can you possibly charge those prices when your chefs have absolutely no idea what they are doing. And this is coming from the only person from the party of 10 who kept giving you the benefit of the doubt. The first omen came with the oysters. How can you strip them from their shell, place them on wooden spoons, and serve them WITHOUT ICE at room temperature. Disgusting. Not fresh. At least 3 people got sick and I'm sure it was because of that. The sangria was a screwdriver. Nothing special. The salmon tartar was not fresh and it was served on old sweet potato chips (not even crunchy) and it smelled so so bad. The paella... wow... that upset the birthday girl, which hit the top of such miserable meal. You charge $100 for this plate and you serve a watery smelly risotto with 0 saffron!? What!? Do you know what paella is?Serving time was slow and followed by ""I hope the wait was worth it"", which was so so ridiculous. Excuses of ""oh our chefs are trying something new"" and ""that's what the sea smells like"" were sad. I am disgusted by this place."

I had high hopes for both the food and drinks after looking through their menu, but was let down by both. Portions were incredibly small and given the lack of flavor in all plates I ordered, not quite worth it. Service was good, but slow at times."

This is a really nice looking restaurant...great modern décor with a great vibe. There were some great latin American choices on the menu. I shared a carrot-ricotta salad with a friend, which was pretty good. For the main course, I tried the brisket. It was absolutely delicious and melts in your mouth. At $35 though, I was hoping for a little more meat. Loved it nonetheless. The service is fantastic as well. The waiter, who was really friendly, took the time to explain the menu and answered all of our questions."

Service was also great. Great experience, too bad it's a bit remote from the busy streets of Montréal."
