The service, the food...everything was amazing! We all ordered the table d'hôte for 49$. Money very well spent if you as me. The food was cooked to perfection! There was a minor hiccup: Cher gave me someone else's lamb chops. I asked for medium rare and it came well done. Told our waiter and without hesitation, he apologize, took my plate and came back within minutes with the right order PLUS the well done lamb chops that I could do whatever I wanted with it! I mean... this is a detail that is very appreciated. You gotta try escargot appetizer. So delicious! This place is small and loud. BUT in a good way! We had a great dinner with our friends. Definitely a BYOB gem. We will be returning even if it's such a hassle drive around and to find parking in the Plateau lol!"

I was there with friends for lunch and we were all impressed with the choice of menu, the polite and friendly service and the delicious food. The table settings are elegant. The decor is modern and minimalist. Everything seems to be at the right place despite the relatively small space. I noticed hooks in the entrance as well as hooks at the back to hang up coats and jackets. The only thing that bothered us was the noise level. All the patrons were in lively conversation. All the tables were occupied. So it's a busy place. If you want to eat here, you will have to reserve fairly early because this place is quite popular. Enjoy this bistro situated in a really interesting neighbourhood of Montreal."

We went for lunch and the table d'hôte was excellent including a starter, main and dessert. I would say the menu was typical bistro fare with a delightful modern twist. The cervelle were excellent as was my confit. I will be back soon."

We were a group of 15 so there was a group menu and it cost $45 per person. For the entree I had the apple stuffed with snails and Calvados, which is an apple brandy from the Normandy region in France. It tastes a lot better than it sounds lol. The waiter recommended it so I wanted to try it and I'm glad I did, My boyfriend had the crab cake with mayo. I preferred the apple stuffed snails. For main I had the flank steak. My boyfriend had the confit de canard with mashed potato. Both mains were very good. If I had to pick one over the other I would have to say that the duck was better. We had duck confit on saturday and my boyfriend said the one at Margaux is better.  Both dishes came with a spoon of creme brulee. For dessert we had the verrine with chocolate hazelnut.This is a great french BYOB. I definitely recommend it and I would come back! Make sure you bring wine because the closest SAQ is a ten min walk. :)"

The food is spectacular, with lots of original dishes, the ambiance is very nice, and the servers are all friendly. They humoured our not-perfect French all evening. But there was one thing that drove my wife and me crazy. All of the dishes and specials are on the printed menu or the ardoise. Yet the servers twice went over the offerings with us dish-by-dish. And then when they serve the dish they feel they have to explain every detail. It's more than a little insulting. We can read and if we have questions we can ask. Why should we have to listen to hear about what we already know. We were disappointed to find this American style intrusive service in Montréal."

While it sure is easy to blow expense account on dining in Montreal, I find Le Margaux, along wiht many other more local establishments, offering a more relaxed and authentic experience. Parking can be a pain though, as it's immensely popular in the night."
