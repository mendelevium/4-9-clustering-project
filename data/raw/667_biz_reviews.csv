/user_details?userid=orwIbBjp2_ITiscvV6nwEQ,Roger F.,"Cambridge, MA",5 star rating,"Simply the best hummus I have ever eaten. Birona offers a wide variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian Middle Eastern dishes. I got ""Le Ashkelon"", a hummus plate with grilled chicken and vegetables. The hummus texture was amazing; clearly made fresh, and the flavors came together wonderfully.If you're not a Francophone, be advised that the staff did not speak great English. Don't worry, because whatever you get will be excellent."
/user_details?userid=NZMcnwHhSNqDjUdABIeUcg,Nicole L.,"Gatineau, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is excellent!I love the decor, we opted to sit on the couch under the family portraits.  They were playing really good music and most important of all is - the food was fantastic!Pretty much everything on the menu is healthy and they have a lot of vegetarian and vegan options including deserts.My husband had a hummus dish that had sausage in it that he devoured and I had a chicken Shawarma which was delicious.It was different, definitely not the usual kind of chicken Shawarma you get at all.  It was a different bread and it was stuffed with chicken and cooked vegetables.  Did I mention it was huge?  Both meals came with salad or fries and my husband got this really fantastic pita breadTheir prices are excellent and service was A-One."

/user_details?userid=NMAZmTggdQFA5ty7wFeCRA,Alyssa A.,"Torrance, Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"This is my new favorite spot in Montreal, seriously! Wow, textures, flavors, warmths, cools. I forgery the name of the chickpea dish but it was beyond delicious and fresh. The hummus and pita is to die for. My friend got the red pepper and olive hummus that was even better. Definitely will come back!"
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"The concept of this place is simple. When you order a plate of hummus, it comes with a coleslaw salad and a small pita plate.They also have salads (make your own or choose from the menu), and sandwiches.The interior is gorgeous, it's a nice open restaurant with plants hanging and light streaming in. Very clean. Service was fast, we were given a number and were able to sit down anywhere we wanted. It took about 5 minutes to get our food after we ordered at the bar.The hummus was delicious. I got the traditional which is just hummus, tahini, and chick peas. The presentation was beautiful and the portion was more than I could handle. If you try it out, just know it's enough food for two. The staff was a bit shy, which is normal since they just opened. But I wish there was a bit more guidance. Since it was my first time I wanted them to give me recommendations. They also kept trying to hurry our visit. They passed by often to ask if we were done. For example: when the pita plate was empty they took it away even though we were still eating the hummus and salad. It was a bit annoying. I wanted to enjoy my time with my boyfriend but it didn't feel very relaxing.Overall, good food and good portions. I will come back and try the rest of the menu for sure."
/user_details?userid=N4TRARMXNYsrVLIDnJQgtg,Austin S.,"Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Canada",5 star rating,"Very cozy in there. The owner/chef is a great guy, we got an appetizer on the house because it was our first time there. The food is very fresh and authentic. Highly recommend, but it is a small place so do not go more than 4 people."
/user_details?userid=Bo8yNJ-0gJH18jPpz0wXJQ,Tamara M.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It's a cozy little restaurant in the mile end with a vary homey feeling to it. The decor is on point and accentuates de style perfectly. Staff very friendly and efficient (there was a large group sitting next to us and the service was still prompt). Every dish from the menu seemed so good, I ordered the Mediterranean hummus which came with a small salad and pita bread and my boyfriend ordered the couscous; delicious!Portions were decent. I suggest you order their gun cocktail (i forgot the name but its the only one with gin) served in a mason jar, simply refreshing!Highly recommend"

/user_details?userid=4TenUuWdhO7-bVNXRMVBpQ,Martin G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Something called a Hummus Bar definitely caught my attention. And at a walking distance from the office, I had the perfect excuse to try it out for lunch.The décor is cute, albeit somewhat cold, but it may have been due to the fact the restaurant was almost empty of customers. I guess most customers order take-out for lunch, which I did. Service was pretty slow, considering most (all?) of the order is precooked. It took a good 15 minutes to get my order.I took Le Marocain, which is traditional hummus topped with minced beef, almonds, a sweet & spicy touch and some harissa. The hummus was decent, not as creamy as I normally like it. The topping was great, flavourful and what I believe to be homemade harissa was at the right level of heat.It came with a side of grilled pita, which was thick and dense. Very good. It also came with a side of vinegar slaw which, unfortunately, was pretty bland and uninteresting.In terms of price, I thought it was, overall, pretty expensive at $14. Not that the portion was too small, it was more than sufficient for lunch, but hummus is not exactly the most expensive thing to cook, neither is vinegar slaw and the very small amount of minced meat does not justify this price. I know rent on Saint-Laurent can be expensive, but I still feel this is too expensive for what it is, compared to what's available in the area for the same price level. At $10-11, I might have gone back. At $14, I'm not sure I will, which is unfortunate because overall, the food was good."
/user_details?userid=nqkSWxeteYkMKtSSFJr2pg,Sam E.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Full disclosure​: I love hummus.Went here for a weekend brunch and despite being a group of Middle Eastern food afficionados, we were not disappointed.We split a bourekas plate, which was essentially a sabich sandwich in a boureka. It doesn't get much better than that for comfort food.We then shared the brunch plate which included eggs cooked to our preference (shakshuka!), hummus, eggplant with feta, fu'ul (which was surprisingly light), and cabbage. There was probably more food, but the list was too long to remember. It also came with a glass of not overly sweet lemon pomegranate juice.The chef and owner came out to talk to us and he couldn't have been nicer. He saw that there was a baby toddler at the table and offered to make some scrambled eggs and veggies, free of charge. He then brought us tahini-chocolate bars for dessert.Looking forward to many more visits to Birona!"
/user_details?userid=hHWxBQUquz4wUwY5ck9JXw,Neil D.,"Saint-Sauveur, Canada",5 star rating,"I have had the chance to eat here on three separate occasions and each time the food was great and very consistent. The hummus was very good and fresh but the real stand out is the Shakshuka, unbelievably good, there are two versions and I recommend them both. I also tried the falafel which is by far the best I've ever had. The place is very trendy and maybe a little artsy, not very comfortable for a long dinning experience. There are two very large ""community"" tables, one small round table for four people and two bar style tables with extremely uncomfortable stools. I've always had the same server and she is extremely friendly and the food is served quite quickly which is good because you really don't want to be stuck sitting on those stools for to long. The food is fresh, homemade and you can tell that they care about what is served. The only downfall about the menu is that you can not get a traditional Coke or Pepsi, all of their drinks are artisanal and not really my taste."
/user_details?userid=-feD63_6IPspoSBsUnS0-w,Mark B.,"Ann Arbor, MI",5 star rating,Great friendly service and excellent food. Highly recommend for dinner or a small group looking for tapas like dining.
/user_details?userid=UPhaKjNjfpen434IIIzwNQ,Debbie V.,"Miami, FL",4 star rating,This place was great. A friend of mine picked it out because we had some vegans in our group... I likely wouldn't have picked a hummus bar for dinner but boy was I wrong. The place was quant and from what I understood was only recently opened. The food was all delicious.... and they had tequila! A hummus bar and tequila? Sold! Service was good. Everyone was very friendly. Definitely check this place out. You will not be disappointed. Thank you!!
/user_details?userid=HS-FPyunRI2uZKpWkLyZZQ,Bosco T.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Amazing hummus, so fresh, tastes nothing like the store bought ones. Got the Le Geneva (?) Hummus with beef, red peppers and mushrooms. Got the Gia's salad that when mixed up is a solid salad."
/user_details?userid=BHG53kaAyPVAwm5hel2gUw,Steph F.,"Somerville, MA",4 star rating,Enjoyed the ambiance and tasty hummus in this bright lunch spot. My ashkara hummus and my husband's shakshuka hummus were both a hit. Walking around Mile End is a treat too. Would return!
/user_details?userid=XOgqs74hkbXT54mSp7JMRA,Natalie G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Even though Birona is delicious spot to grab a sandwich, it's a great hummus bar for lunch. You'll find all kind of hummus, tahina, sabih, falafel with great salade. The atmosphere is modern and cool. Fresh ingredient.We were four and each ordered a difference dish. We got schnitzel sandwiches, Abeille Salad and a Jerusalem hummus to share. It's a must"
/user_details?userid=x8DD07PHJ1CHO8qic4QOgA,Ita S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I liked the Moroccan Hummus. Good option for a quick lunch. Fresh,  healthy,  satisfying. Nice big communal tables. Go for something you never tried. I liked the original dishes rather than the traditional ones. If you go with a friend take one Hummus plate and one pita sandwich and share."
/user_details?userid=UcZt9XOzxdIquC99-9RgTg,Steph P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great food, amazing service, the server sat down with us and gave us an in-depth description of the menu and served us complimentary energy balls!"
/user_details?userid=hfzIucnKdAXemPUL3wfNxg,Jonathan B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Great hummus with lots of yummy varieties. Highly recommended for a healthy and filling lunch.
/user_details?userid=G75z89dj9RJuxkM1wBZgbA,Rishi D.,"San Diego, CA",2 star rating,Very underwhelming. The sign outside the restaurant per claim that I had the best hummus in Montreal. I found it to be one more bladder hummus is I've had in a long long time. The Decour of the restaurant was very sterile and there is only one employee working. The presentation is very nice but I do not think I shall be returning.
/user_details?userid=7klV_tmcBEntrHbMLAx83w,Ted R.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"If you like simple food like falafel, but want to pay way more than other places and wait extra long to receive it, you will love this place. Seriously, $9 falafel? Expensive pints of bad local beer like Cheval Blanc?"
