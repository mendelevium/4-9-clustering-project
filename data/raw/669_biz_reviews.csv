I got the guava cheese one which was so warm and gooey. My friend got the chorizo and cheese one which he loved as well. Because of corona, they are only taking orders at the window, so you can't walk in and see everything, but it works and seems like a good idea!"
/user_details?userid=1zxXP-HfI3Ycsv7xuZanaQ,Michael K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Hello I was in the neighborhood and decided to go back and get some goodies to take home.I was introduced to this place from the last Yelp event.This time the person who served me was not in a good mood and was arguing with me. I wanted to get six pieces to take home but she said if I give you all six pieces I will have no more to give to customers. I told her to make more it's only 11:30  and I'm sure you will sell more.She said that should could not give me the six and I have to wait 20 to 25 minutes so that she make more.I took 6 and left after waited for them to be made.3 chorizo and 3 beef and cheeseThe chorizo was over cooked and extremely dryThe beef and cheese was very good and cooked perfectly
/user_details?userid=ZGiwU16rhGvWAYUzkWL0xw,Boz X.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Small sweetish bread rolled like a croissant and baked golden brown, called Cachitos, is a staple of a Venezuelan breakfast.Traditionally, they are filled with ham OR cheese, but in 21st century Canada, Cachitos (the shop, not the bread) serves cachitos (the pastry) with many modern flavours. My favorite flavours are:Beef and Cheddar: gooey, yellow cheddar cheese half melted on a generous portion of minced beef. 5/5Ham AND Cheese: reminds me of the better version of my childhood lunches: fluffy bread baked golden brown instead of mushy white bread. 4.5/5Guava and Cheese: are originally cuban, but the flavour combination apparently also works well in the form of a croissant. 4.5/5Honorable mention: salmon (4/5)There's an accompanying herbal mayo with every cachito. It tastes almost like a tartar sauce.The owners are welcoming and take the time to explain every pastry if you ask. The desserts look very appetizing, but I haven't had the chance tot ry every one of them."
/user_details?userid=BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,Jennifer P.,"Ottawa, Canada",3 star rating,"I've had Cachitos on my bookmarks list for a while now, from back when they were at their old location.  I'm glad I got to try them finally.  I liked it, but I didn't LOVE it.I went there with my mom.  Our goal on our trip was to try as many places as possible, so we mostly would get an item or 2 and share.  Our waistbands were pretty stretched by the time we were at Cachitos, lol, so we decided we were only going to get 1 cachito and share, but we were having a hard time deciding which one to get.  The ladies working there were really nice and one asked us if it was our first time there.  When we told it that it was, she gave us some samples of the Cheese Cachito.  It was good, the cheese was a little bit stringy and it was mild, not pungent at all (I know that it's probably déclassé to admit this, but I hate strong cheeses.  I'm a brie and mild cheddar kind of girl.  Feta is about as strong as I'll go, lol).  We finally decided on the chicken cachito ($3.95).  The chicken cachito had shredded chicken in it with some spices.  The bun was soft and the chicken was flavourful.  It was good, but didn't wow me.  I think that if I was in the area and wanted a snack that I could easily eat on the go, I would come back for one, but I doubt that I would make a special trip across the city for one.The place is cute with some bar seating along the wall."
/user_details?userid=bJ9JnroYXtpbIbJBp2zFTw,Jeff S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"By chance my friend and I walked by on their opening day (think they moved/re-opened) October 11th, 2016. It's a very small yet bright space (so much so that turning around can be a challenge), but it packs in a nice little selection of Venezuelan/Latin inspired baked food and dessert treats.No arepas we were told, but we did share the spinach and Parmesan filled Cachitos (a Venezuelan hot pocket of sorts). It was wrapped in a delicate, though quite munch-able, dough with a not too salty filling. You can get a small creamy dipping sauce (not sure what the spice was, and hard to dip while walking) with it at no charge.They have about a dozen fillings on display (not in stock at all times) from what I could see. Ranging from cheese only, to cheese and meat combinations, to some with fruit or chocolate. Most are about $3.95-4.25 plus taxes.The second visit we tried the most popular we were told - ham and cheese, with its semi-melty, semi-firm, mild tasting Latin style queso. This one was  slightly better with the dipping sauce.Noted and took out a set of dulce de leche filled soft crumbly butter cookies ($3+taxes). They also have very neat looking cupcakes, tartlets and tres leches cake. Lots of yum in that area.A little pricey, but for the freshness, cleanliness and deliciousness...well you decide. Gracias."

We had the Ham & Cheese, Spinach, and white Cheese Cachitos. The service was good, and the little shop clean organized and cute. Will be back !"
/user_details?userid=0KJgci3tc5BoLxC5_Ggt7Q,Daniel F.,"Kissimmee, FL",5 star rating,A true Taste of Venezuela.  Great service. The Jambon e Fromage Cachito is superb and the cheese melts in your mouth.  Totally worth it
/user_details?userid=911McK9pRgcXtd4HAC2UFw,Chris M.,"Boisbriand, Canada",3 star rating,"Very nice staff, but nothing special going on food wise. Essentially they have sausages with bread baked around them. There's a few different flavors, and it's adequate. There is nothing going on that most artisinale bakeries don't already do better. If you are in the area, hungry and want to eat a sausage wit the bun built around it while walking around sure why not. Outside that it's not a destination spot."

/user_details?userid=kBFb2l1OmfQ-zLOR1d112Q,Chris H.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,I had never heard of cachitos but decided to stop in when looking for something new. They're basically a simple baked bread with some sort of filling but that doesn't mean they aren't tasty! I tried the gruyere with jelly (guava? I don't speak French so hard to say) and the shredded chicken (served with an herb mayo) and both were real good. This is a great place to pick up a snack when on the go.
/user_details?userid=kB2D-z4sHyRsxtim3Qb0mA,Marco P.,"Vernon, CT",5 star rating,"Cachitos is a great establishment. The owners are super friendly and willing to chat with you.  it really feels like the old Venezuelan times when people will go out to panaderias to eat breakfast.The cachitos are even better than what you find in Venezuela. Flavors are good but not overpowering.  Favorite flavors are ham & cheese, cheese and salmon. Never really tried the sweet versions so I can speak of them.Getting there about 20 minutes after opening will most likely guarantee a warm, fluffy cachitos.A must stop for my family when visiting Montreal."
/user_details?userid=V3MobZ-Bvg-hnp7Y-QPcOg,Aarani P.,"Markham, Canada",3 star rating,"We went here early on a Saturday morning while we were in town for the weekend. We were walking by prior to attending yoga, decided we were hungry and walked in. The girl behind the counter was very friendly, we got to talking and she told us all about the Venezuelan food, and her experience in Montreal. I liked the cachitos but wouldn't say I LOVED them. My friends did though so if they were reviewing this could easily shoot up to a 5. It was a cute little spot with about 5 bar stools so I'd recommend it for a quick bite with a small group or take out."
/user_details?userid=9pdg23s7QRZR_V9eimDJ0w,"A, B.","Mississauga, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a great place to grab breakfast. It's fairly inexpensive, the Cachitos taste fresh and are so soft, and the employees are very friendly. We tried the cheese, the cheese and guava, and the spinach. I would highly recommend the cheese and guava- the flavour combo is great, and it's something that isn't generally available everywhere. The cheese and the spinach were good too, but didn't blow me away. If you're looking for a cheap, quick, delicious breakfast this is a great option."

/user_details?userid=XEqApY2jtSPdGptPsJHumg,Lucy F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I didn't know what cachitos were before finding this place. So happy to have found it. These slightly sweet brioches with savoury fillings are outstanding. My favourite is the classic ham and cheese. Perfection.
/user_details?userid=wcaOAza28t04prTRUkSWhA,Maria Z.,"Surrey, Canada",5 star rating,"So good. We stopped here for a quick breakfast while exploring downtown and were blown away by how good these cachitos are. We tried the cheese, ham and cheese, as well as the cheese and guava. Such a great savoury/slightly sweet flavour -- try them! The service was friendly, the food very reasonably priced, and everything was ready fast. We also had two of their signature coffees, with sweetened condensed milk at the bottom. Go try cachitos!!"

I am impressed with quality ingredients. These are like filled Croissants but less buttery.  Will be ordering more in future."
