/user_details?userid=1MDc4mt9p1vWt3_T3Ty5xw,David S.,"Ellicott City, MD",5 star rating,"amazing food that is incredibly authentic.  We came early so it was empty. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. We walked over, but I can imagine the parking being an issue since it's all street parking. We ordered the nan khanegi , manto, kadoo borani, and qabuli polow. Everything was incredibly delicious and well seasoned. I could've licked the plate. I definitely recommend this place if you like authentic Afghan cuisine."
/user_details?userid=5CS5CMDuEjAFKbCJ-GRTKQ,Louisa B.,"Klamath Falls, OR",5 star rating,"We liked this place so much we ate there twice in one weekend!  The food is great, and the atmosphere is understated but elegant. We strongly recommend the eggplant appetizer and the lamb shank. We also recommend everything else, but those were our favorites. We found the staff incredibly helpful and accommodating. One of has a hearing issue, and they kindly gave us a table in a quiet corner both nights. This is now our favorite Afghan restaurant in Montréal."
/user_details?userid=pV5yh55j12SWmipNv53qsQ,Thea M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I have had this on my list of places to try for the longest time, and I'm so happy I finally came! The family that owns the restaurant was so nice, and the food was amazing. There aren't many vegetarian main course options on the menu, so I opted to just eat a bunch of appetizers so I could try a bit of everything.  They were very accommodating and replaced the meat sauce on the Ashak with a lentil sauce to make it vegetarian. The Ashak was nice and light, and the Ash Reshteh soup was super soothing. The Qurooti was also really tasty but after the first few bites, it got to be way too salty, which is probably why it's meant to be shared as an appetizer and not as a main. My favorite part of the meal, though, was probably the free bread. It came with tangy dipping sauces, and had the most divine texture to it.All in all, beautiful décor, great service, authentic food, and BYOW - what's not to like?"
/user_details?userid=BjeyTXxk61rAdWyHiLHg9w,Sehrish N.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Went there for a birthday dinner in December. It's a small restaurant, beautifully decorated on the pricey side. The host was very polite and explained the menu several times. We had the 5 course meal which I ended up sharing with someone because it was too much for one person to finish. The food was great. The soup was warm and hearty, so many flavours that I wasn't used to but it was delicious. The two main meals were just as good. I've had mantoo at other restaurants but really enjoyed it here. I didn't like the lentils over the dumplings so ate it alone. Green tea and dessert were included. The tea just helped down just a heavy meal, you could have about 2 small cups. Finding parking was the biggest headache in that area."
/user_details?userid=P0J2H0XoJmcPzdwtJUHLcQ,Sadia H.,"Laval, Canada",4 star rating,"On a frenzied Friday night, we were a group of 4 desperate to find a restaurant that was firstly open and secondly willing to seat us without reservations. The hunt took longer than we hoped and the impending winter storm, rapidly dropping temperatures and our grumbling stomachs were making us desperate for a hearty meal. Then Kaboul did come to our rescue as the lineup outside Ma Poule Mouillee was more than atrocious that night, and we were grateful. Not so grateful were we to be seated at a very cramped corner of the restaurant when there were plenty of other tables and a whole other empty room on the other side. Now, I understand that it's easier for the staff to clean up if the mess is constrained to one area but I knew we were going to get ignored the whole night. And sadly we were ignored as our waiter came 30 mins later than usual to take our order and then after our appetizers did come out, he forgot to bring the bread that went with them. That was all after maybe an hour wait for our food (which again I can blame on the dinner rush) but all this simply added to our exasperation that night. The mighty saving grace: my Quboli Pulow - the rice and lamb shank dish! I wasn't too impressed with the appetizers - I had had high hopes for my favourite Persian dish, the eggplant dip dish but I bit into many pieces of raw garlic when tasting it sans the bread that never came. But, that quboli pulow - with the tender meat and fragrant, flavourful rice - earned major redeeming points for this place. I like supporting restaurants that are under the radar but have good food so yeah, I would recommend this place! PS: the other dishes we had ordered were the meat dumpling - okay - and the chapali kebab and the chicken kebab - both good - maybe a bit pricey but not too bad."
/user_details?userid=wQLqTg9_f9KxV4yr_I0JYA,Brian C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,The second visit was even better than the first.On the weekends the place gets packed so the service can back up a bit. All the plates were just excellent and they have added some nice desserts including homemade ice cream and a very competitive baklava. The staff are as nice and as friendly as ever and you will most likely have a Memorable  meal.
/user_details?userid=moenrsOQO5cOa8bmlrvnsw,Naïka E.,"Charlemagne, Canada",4 star rating,"Everything was pretty average in my opinion, except for the food. First time eating afghan meals and it was sooo flavorful and healthy! The meat was tender and well seasoned, the rice went perfectly with it and their entry are super good discoveries!"
/user_details?userid=Et6YLMrlyX2PCkqtwSVAug,Sabeena S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I feel like food maybe tastes better when you don't have to pay for it? Just a thought. I changed my review from 3 to 4 stars perhaps for that very reason. I came here with colleagues and visiting scholars after a workshop that I was hosting at the University. It was a group of about 10-12 people, students, professors, and librarians. The group was lively and the conversation flowed very easily, so the food naturally was consumed in a jolly environment. I can't remember what I ordered. Maybe the Qabuli pulow, but being a Pakistani, I naturally found it very meaty and bland. Afghani food usually seems that way to me and perhaps I should stick to the kebabs. However, the service was very nice and the ambiance of the restaurant was pleasant. It is definitely pricey but a decent place to take an older group of people for a relaxing night out."
/user_details?userid=LoLExZhMwS1dW6bE0rg9lw,Tchu P.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"The place is nice, tables comfortable.The first thing each of them asked us was : is it a reservation or not ? At first ok, I could understand thought there were many tables unprepared and few people. But when sit, why would you ask us once again if it is a reservation or not? I asked the difference for them to the waiter : he said no difference and try to avoid the real answer actually... saying quickly in his mouth for the feedback etc...?!?!?!Well, actually the service was not there : service was long waiting to take the order, waiting for the meal, asking twice or thrice the same thing because it was taking to long. Waiter was not very welcoming neither. Conclusion, the service experience was bad, really bad knowing we were with hungry kids too, and for parents they DO understand what I mean.Regarding the meal, well, we may say that the service didn't help to appreciate the meal. But thinking about it, the plates were very simple and light flavor : we ordered sabzi, kofta and the qubilu lamb. Really light in flavor, just few bites and mostly simple green salad and rice...I love Oriental cuisine ! But here...very disappointed.I really don't recommend, and I'll definitely compare with another afghan restaurant."
/user_details?userid=CdYcO_6ZenGPU0v45zceNQ,Ashley P.,"Spartanburg, SC",5 star rating,"This was my first time trying Afghan food. The restaurant was impeccably clean and the ambience is relaxed. We went with a few chef recommendations and each was wonderful. We had the Ash Maison, an earthy, homemade soup. Next the sambossa tikari, this reminded me of a samosa. We tried the Manta. Everything tasted very fresh. We also had the Qulobi Palow, which was very good. Cardamom ice cream and pink Afghan Thé was the perfect finish. It was all wonderful and the owner/chef couldn't have been nicer. This is a must try place to eat!"
/user_details?userid=Br9bkJqjKms9BjvKWZsgwA,Ali K.,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",5 star rating,I have tried a couple of different Afghan restaurants in Montreal and some other cities and but last night was my first dinner at this restaurant and I am happy that I tried somewhere new... the food is absolutely delicious (I am Pescatarian but friends were super happy with their Kebabs and with Qabuli Polov). The portion of food on each plate is reasonable. Their rice with cumin was tasty and you must try it. You can bring your own wine. The staff are friendly and welcoming. The only negative point was that we were a big group and for some of our friends their dishes came later than others.
/user_details?userid=Bveyuu-GqeQMf8ereY2I2g,Sabrina N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Absolutely Delicious. Fresh ingredients, BYOW, handmade and extremely flavorful. This place is a must try!I walked in on a Thursday evening and wasn't expecting much since there was barely anyone in the restaurant however I very quickly changed my mind when I received the plate of their fresh bread with dipping sauces. Amazing!I was also advised by the waited that some items on the menu were not available seeing as how the woman who makes the Asha (by hand... every day) called in sick. WOW! You had me handmade... Every single bite was better than the last! I look forward to the next time I go back! Give this place a try and let me know what you think ;)"
/user_details?userid=ZiA5K4JI6UWMXuXzAaG2fQ,Syed M.,"Côte-Des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-De-Grâce, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"From where should I start? I made a reservation for two but they didn't find my name. Finally the receptionist is kind enough to manage a place for two. Food is delicious but the service is extremely slow. We'd to wait 20 minutes to have our wine bottle opened! Most of the time I was waving my hands to draw attention of our waitress for water, wine glass, pepper and spoon! Anyway, we've selected Table d'hôte from the menu which includes an appetizer and a dessert. But not all the desserts are  included in their table d'hôte menu. The waitress suggested us a dessert without mentioning the fact that dessert is not included in our table d'hôte menu. When we're paying the bill and mentioned it at the cash, the waitress came up and said ""Yes I did tell you that the dessert I recommended costs additional charges"". Finally we did not create any fuss, paid our bills and left the place with a very unpleasant feeling. I will never go back to that place in my life where people have no shame to lie on your face."

I'm happy I did because their food was pretty good and service was outstanding. My favorite part was the tea lounge and their Shir Yakh was just amazing!!

/user_details?userid=OKifFM94dV_b0hLJMj7vzg,Steeve F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"As someone who loves to explore new flavours, this Afghani restaurant was a great experience. First, the food. Presentation was nice, taste was amazing. It's one of those restaurants where you really feel that the chef cooks has a purpose and a love for what she is doing. So heartwarming. Our entrees where Samosa and some Afgan Ravioli. To die for. The main dishes where a plate of different meat. Chicken, veal and beef. I didn't care that much for the beef but the veal and chicken were tender and well seasoned, exactly what you would expect from that kind of restaurant. As for the staff, our waiter gave us an excellent service. Worthy of a 4 star restaurant. Koodos!BTW, I went on a week day, but I heard that, in the weekend, it's better to call and reserve."
/user_details?userid=E5nRF4bClGRgpo9JeCHfqg,Suganya H.,"Toronto, Canada",3 star rating,I had their ashak - vegetarian - leak and coriander filled ravioli topped with yogurt and lentil sauce. It was good and different for a vegetarian.
/user_details?userid=emrIitrYmQejSzVgDs_Vtw,Gamze K.,"Sunnyvale, CA",1 star rating,"Despite being very empty and almost closing, they did not allow us to sit to the seat we wanted. They said we can only sit on seats that were for 2 people and we had to choose a seat in a bad location. The glasses were not clean and we could see lip marks on it. And the most ridiculous thing was, if you did spend less than $19 per person they dont accept you as a customer. So even though we were not very hungry, we had to buy extra food that we did not want."
/user_details?userid=zl54VWliCB_5IXNZfAQy-g,Naweed M.,"San Jose, CA",5 star rating,I have been to several Afghan restaurants all over USA and Canada and have never been to one that serves such a big variety of authentic dishes! I would recommend the quruti as an appetizer. The kabobs were very tender and tasteful and the qabuli palow was amazing. The service was great and the staff were friendly and welcoming. I will definitely return soon :)
/user_details?userid=32fOLLXWbRrC1HS1yltlAg,Patrick L.,"Kent, OH",5 star rating,"Very nice food and very attentive service. Four of us had lamb, vegetable, chicken, and beef patties. All were happy with their food. We tried the Afghan teas as well, which were flavorful and a welcome warm up before heading out into a cold night. But the highlight was the house specialty ice cream, with cardamom, pistachios, and other secret ingredients."

/user_details?userid=UYW6ODwBCi059RtsSCtU_A,Peter F.,"Victoria, Canada",3 star rating,"This is a pretty new restaurant with some amazing dishes and a great family behind it. The eggplant appetizer Borani Badenjan is amazing, as is the lamb 'jarret' Qubuli Palow. I predict this restaurant will only get better as they learn to handle the dinner rush and speed up service."

We wanted a special celebratory meal and we definitely got it.The food was absolutely delicious. We had Ashak, Manto and the Qubuli Palow which was one of the best lamb dishes I've had in my life -  tender and full of flavours.The service was also excellent with a pleasant and patient waiter who was happy to explain and recommend us what to order. Oh, we ended up with a lovely light desert, rice pudding with rose water and pistachio.No doubt it's a 5 star place. For sure we will go there again next time we are in Montreal."

/user_details?userid=VVKPN_N3M3DKA-2an10HSA,Nadia R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Great resto for authentic afghan food. Nice mixture of flavours and spices. The rice dishes and grilled meats were delectable. My fave has to be the eggplant! Afghan tea is a must to finish off the meal. Byow too.
/user_details?userid=qCBtl-VTEuGjP3B0XKrYcg,Fred A.,"Poulsbo, WA",5 star rating,"Absolutely top-notch food and service! The owner and staff were helpful, friendly but definitely not hovercraft. The lamb and veal dishes were superb, and their home-made pickled vegetables (of which they sent us off with a to-go container for later enjoyment) a special treat.There is a tea room to which diners can go after dinner for a relaxing ambience - or I suppose one could just have the green Afghan tea - but we chose to finish our dinner with the Afghani-style ice cream and cream rolls.The only drawback to this restaurant is that the street is currently under construction, and no doubt parking is tough to find at peak times, but the staff have a special way to enable parking, which you'll need to ask them about (smile.)"
/user_details?userid=lH23tQCVUCAjIHfGRFXlLQ,Sana J.,"Austin, TX",5 star rating,Definitely recommend this amazing place! The food was phenomenal and service was great. We got the chabli kabob and the tarkari chalow both of which were great but the kabob was the winner for sure. We also got the baklava and the jalebi for dessert and enjoyed them both. Only thing though is to come early or make a reservation because it gets busy quickly!

It's a must visit if you like good afghani food.Highly recommend the eggplant appetizer, minced meat stuffed ravioli, the veal main course & beef kebabs."
/user_details?userid=HdBMfLZR_oJOgkhNT6eh5g,Ait Driss B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,First time at this restaurant and the experience was excellent. Subtle spicy touches that let the flavours explode in mouth. The ravioli as entree was perfect. The soup was also delicate and extremly tasty. Recommend chiken kabob chose the leg instead as it is juicy and tender in mouth. The waiter was very friendly and offered good suggestions. I highly recommend this place and hope they will sustain the quality over time.
/user_details?userid=FU9guzGElCiaK8ZtG7W5AA,Chloe L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great service and great food! I went with my mother and we both loved it! It was our first time in an Afghan restaurant so we asked the waiters innumerable questions and tips, and he basically ended up picking our food for us (only because we wanted to). However, you should do the same as his recommendations were top-notch! You definitely have to try the eggplant appetizer, but if you don't like rose water, be careful of the cheese balls for dessert. The rest were exquisite. I am definitely coming back here:)"
