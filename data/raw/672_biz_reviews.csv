Lol WOW.Hot-dog, sausage, burger, fries, poutine, you name it.So I wanted to try this place for a very long time... I have a thing for sausage, hotdog... And also home cut French fries... This place has it all.My wife and I wasn't very hungry, so we ordered something to share. Well a lot more than something Hahaha.It's a foie gras (fancy!) hotdog, with popcorn chicken Mac and cheese poutine. Oh my! That sounds dirty lol!It tasted outstanding! Foie gras hotdog it's a combination of fancy and cheap fast food but it worked! It elevated a regular sausage bun to another level. Smoky flavor from the beef sausage combine with juicy fat of fois gras, an explosif watery taste in your mouth.They use home cut French fries in their poutine and I think it's the best fries for any poutine adding a Mac & Cheese with popcorn chicken on top... I know I need to hit the Gym after this dirty plate and IT WAS WORTH IT!"
/user_details?userid=936r8HQQtwpu8FTmVX-9rA,Aaron T.,"Mississauga, Canada",3 star rating,"It was an awesome day for the patio this past Saturday and what better way to spend it than to sit on a patio and sip on 2 for 1 Dirty Caesar's. We were out and about in Montreal for a bachelor party and I knew there are some wicked patio's and bars along Crescent street so we hit the ground running. Dirty Dogs is situated right on the corner of Crescent street and Blvd de Maisonneuve. Their restaurant is on the second floor and patio is on the ground floor. For the people that need stroller or wheelchair access I don't recall seeing anywhere with access which is bad. They also have a half patio on the restaurant level that opens up like a garage door. We didn't really have food here so not much to say about their food except for a boss dog which is basically like a chilli cheese dog. It was good had nice flavour which I found a little expensive for what you get $13.50 for just a dog is a little steep for me. The range for the food here is roughly $13 to $25. \Now drinks on the other hand if you are there during happy hour you're in luck. All day everyday from 4:00PM to 8:00PM if I'm not mistaken. Most of their cocktails are 2 for 1 special, most beers are 2 for 1 as well, and half price sangria pitchers. Their happy hour is a great deal if you ask me as that was what dragged us in to take a look.I think this is a great hangout for drinks hands down."

I was super hungry on my way back home, it was open late, went inside for a burger, can't say anything bad about it. On the screen, they were showing ironical footage like aerobics from the 80's 90's, that was oddly hilarious."
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Originally, intrigued by the St. Laurent location- I was suprised to see that Dirty Dogs had replaced Dundee's at the corner of Crescent and Maisonneuve. I was drawn in by the terrace moreso the menu. The decor was basic. The unique feature of this business: burgers (beef, beyond meat), hotdogs (beef, porc, veggie) and poutines can be purchased with the same toppings. Hotdogs start at 13.50$ and burgers 14$ accompanied by a side of fries or salad. (A bit steep for the quality of food you're getting). I ordered the Kpop burger on a beyond meat patty (topped with bbq sauce, kimchi and black sesame sauce) 3/5. The toppings were good, kimchi wasn't too spicy. The beyond meat patty was 1$ extra and taste like a salmon burger to me. I also ordered the mac attack hotdog that was served with cold mac n cheese. The bread for both dishes was untoasted which caused it to get soggy quickly. We got our utensils with brown paper (the kind you see in bathrooms to dry your hands). It was kind of unappealing to tell you the truth. They did have a good happy hour special-2 for 1 cocktails, starting at 11$ for mixed cocktails-7$ for beers. The cocktails were good. I had a nice mojito. One of the bucket list, but a disappointing ending."

/user_details?userid=2YWHVzV9QGuaTA527kQUIw,Agunik M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Used to be Dundees Bar & Grill but oh boy am I happy this opened instead! The facility is designed for a good old fashioned party with a classy edge to it. Prices are great, have a bar permit so you can also come in just for a drink. Additionally, nothing beats a polite and on point staff--hopefully it'll continue! About the hotdog: loved it! I don't know if the actual sausage was something to write home about, but the general combination of bruschetta, bacon, mozzarella and pesto made for a refreshing meal on a hot day. About time we have a classy hotdog place downtown. Would recommend 10/10."
/user_details?userid=JDUKmC223wYPLsmem-ItrQ,Miles B.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place was great. the decor inside was really cool, great place for a party, but also a nice spot for a decent bite to eat.Lots of terrace space in the summer which is really great, and the food was surprisingly inexpensive!I had the ""Eastwood"" with the house pork sausage, and it was exactly what I wanted! Flavourful house bbq sauce, melty cheese, nice sweet caramelized onions, and crispy bacon. The bun was soft and fluffy, to tie it all together. The fries were good and salty, as well as slightly addictive. The staff was super friendly, and good at checking up on us to ensure that everything was good, and our time was going well.Overall 5/5, would definitely recommend and go again. Perfect place to go have a casual but good bite with friends, and enjoy some sun and drinks on their terrace."

/user_details?userid=grJrvtuZXxVp-K9n0W6qIw,Zach G.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",2 star rating,"My girlfriend and I walked in and no one greeted us or seated us. Finally a waitress told us to sit wherever we wanted. We sat down and no one came over to us for over 10 minutes. Finally we went over to the bar and asked if we could have menus and water. The lady behind the bar gave us attitude and asked how long we've been there and if we sat ourselves. Finally she came over to us and spoke to us in French, despite the fact that we just spoke to her in English when we talked to her at the bar.We ordered drinks because the happy hour deals were really good (2 for 1 cocktails). However, we ordered them at about 7:40 and happy hour ends at 8. She brought us our drinks, took our drink menus, didn't take our food order, and then walked away so fast that we couldn't even tell her we were ready to order. Then, she didn't come back for 20 more minutes! Our guess is that she didn't want us to take advantage of the happy hour deals because she came back at 8:01 to finally take our food order. The poutine that we ordered was really tasty which is why this place gets 2 stars. A different waiter brought us out our food and finally brought us some water. He was really nice. To end off the night, the girl from behind the bar came back to the table and took away my cocktail before I was done drinking it. She was TERRIBLE."

We were a party of 5 and showed up a little before 4 on a Sunday afternoon and were quickly rated at a booth. The menu was overwhelming at first. Patrick, our waiter, was pleasingly patient in explaining the menu to us and answering our many questions. My brother-in-law ordered one of their signature ""big ass cocktails"" and DD wasn't fooling. I would probably have to use two hands to pick up the drink. The food came and one-bite in sold us. Regardless of the initial confusion with the men, the plates were all incredibly tasty as our table ordered a variety of dogs, burgers, poutine and mac 'n cheese. We all went home with happy tummies and I'll be back again."
/user_details?userid=c6S01oH5avfwijdVPqeTVg,Sherry S.,"Manhattan, New York, NY",1 star rating,"We came in and got seats immediately. And ordered in 5 minutes. Not a weekend, not Friday, we came in at Thursday, no line up at all. But we spent at least 40 minutes waiting after we placed an ordered. Waiters kept saying 5 minutes, after 10 minutes, we asked we would be the next one. Bad service."
