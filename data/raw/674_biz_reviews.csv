/user_details?userid=mrru6hbeQLvagU4vkfuqmw,Jenny T.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This place is such a hidden gem.  The owners are so sweet and the pricing is very reasonable.  I saw that they had yucca fries and I just had to have it.  I ordered the yucca fries with the pork and the hard taco with avocadoes as well as the tamale with chicken.  Yeah, I just had a field day here.  Everything was served with a jug of tomato sauce and another huge jug of pickled vegetables, which are both unlimited condiments.  I also ordered the horchata, but they forgot it and I didn't bother to ask for it because I realize how over my head I was when the food came out.The yucca fries were okay, but I was really surprised by the pork, which is like a chicharron type hard feel, but extremely delicious.  I had this with the side of the tomato sauce.  The avocado on the taco is amazeballs, and I did not expect it.  The avocado had a really sweet taste to it, and it tasted light and not as buttery as the usual that I'm used to.  The tamale was a bit odd with chicken, potato and olives right in there.  The chicken was really tender, but I wasn't digging the potatoes and olives because it wasn't expected.Everything came out too $22!  They don't do credit or debit tips, just cash so make sure to have some money for the cash tips.  Lovely place."
/user_details?userid=kf1R97OMSqcZLqvH1wr5Ew,Camila S.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,Do NOT go here! Go instead to Iris or El amigo! The staff here is superrrr rude. They force you to pay the tip cash and they don't give receipts. One of the waiter even told my mom when we weren't even finished: Hmmm excuse but based on what you ordered you have to give me minimum 10$ of tip! It's not the first time they are rude and A LOT of people find them very rude and disrespectful. I wouldn't encourage that kind of behaviour. Go somewhere else. There are so many better latin places

We came back here many many times and each time I loved the pupusas! It's soo soo good! DELICIOSOO!! Also, did know what yuca frita before, but after I tried it...omg...I LOVED IT! The service is pretty good also, the waitress is very kind.Pro: PUPUSAS! YUCA FRITAS!Cons: Gotta walk a little bit from metro."
/user_details?userid=4Tn7FjgPgCt-uPluEw1ynA,Emilie I.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Price is fine many option for the food. I know this place since 28 years now and the taste the same since then. Good to try for those who dont know the salvadorian food in villeray area. Nice neighbor hood with a lot of place to eat.
/user_details?userid=wio2PT99Eth_4Kf0MynIDw,Aron G.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I am pleased to report that on my second visit to La Carreta, the experience was much improved!I visited with another friend, and this time we tried some of the combos on the menu.  I went for the Combo Vegetariano which comes with fried plantains, yuca fries, and a choice of pupusas - I took the queso y frijol (cheese and black bean) pupusa.The pupusa was miles ahead of the previous ones I ate here - the cheese was salty, flavourful, cheesy :), the beans were savoury and exciting!  I tried the curtido and the salsa, and they definitely had a distinct flavour, none of the blandness from the last visit.  Normally I like to eat my pupusas plain, it allows me to analyze the specific flavour, without the condiments overpowering or masking the taste.At my companion's suggestion, and after having tried the curtido and salsa on their own, I finally tried combining all the components together, and was pleased with the result.  I still plan on eating these pupusas plain, because at least I now know they have a good flavour on their own.  I am glad to know that I can always augment this with the extra condiments!My friend tried the Combo Enchilada which is an enchilada with a choice of meat, avocado, or black beans, a choice of pupusas, and yuca fries.  My friend took the avocado enchilada option, and chose the pollo con queso (chicken and cheese) pupusa.She really enjoyed the chicken and cheese pupusa, and the yuca fries.  She was very happy with the meal, and especially enjoyed the combination of curtido, salsa, and pupusa.La Carreta only accepts cash and Interac (debit) cards, but be advised that you can't tip on the debit card machine, so tips have to be in cash.In my previous review I singled out the horchata as the one redeeming feature of the meal, I just want to acknowledge that it is still delicious as ever!  I'm glad I gave La Carreta a second chance, I'm happy to be proven wrong!"
/user_details?userid=l04QmkEARudoSgHCXcJtuA,Jeremiah C.,"White Plains, NY",4 star rating,Pretty good Salvadoreño food for a good price! The place is nicely tucked in a suburban area just out of the reach of the more touristy areas. They have a good selection of massive $3 pupusas and provide a pretty stacked menu of Salvadorian goodies! It's cheap. It's affordable and it's really good! Their chocolate horchata... freaking beast. Could drink like 10 of them but then I'd need to rent two chairs on my bus ride home!

/user_details?userid=5XwoDsrADIKtQ90mayLjmg,Jason G.,"Bend, OR",5 star rating,"Stopped into La Carreta for a late afternoon snack.  Never had pupusas before. Followed the advice of other reviewers and tried a few. They are quite excellent and at 3$ a pop they are cery affordable. Whatever flavor you get make sure to try the spicy salsa. It's jalapeños and carrots. Sounded strange to me, but it was fantastic. All in all a great spot to eat in the Plateau/Little Italy area of Montreal."
/user_details?userid=4JqLmXe-uFAlhMnquhLl1w,Adriana T.,"Green Valley, Canada",5 star rating,"This El Salvadorian restaurant is amazing, the service is great, there is outdoor seating. It is very cozy and we come here often, I recommend trying the drink Horchata."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"Sweet cozy sunken sunlit window-wrapped spot on St Zotique with some of the best smiles and pupusas in a highly pupusa-populated area. Incredibly tasty, fresh and super affordable, I would highly recommend this spot, especially on cold winter days when a little heat is what's needed. The burritos, plantains, sangria are all delicious but the standout for me are the pupusas - not greasy at all, and the homemade pickled cabbage and peppers with hot sauce piled on top take me to my happy place."
/user_details?userid=XcHa7v-xLqAa-IXmMOkcwQ,Jamie H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Very good Pupusas and good Horchata. Compares to quality in El Salvador. Will definitely be coming back.
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"First time trying out pupusas and it was very good! We ordered 6 different kinds to take out. It came with a very, VERY sour cabbage salad which i didn't particularly enjoy and a tomato coulis. Very cheap eats if you ask me. I can't wait to come back and try what's on their menu!"
/user_details?userid=tuTOS6G6d3VjjVjnnMkuug,Niki S.,"Marlboro Township, NJ",4 star rating,Cute restaurant with a street side terrace. Friendly staff. Great Horchata and Papusas.
/user_details?userid=1E_psaptRT9kFVEEBj05vw,David M.,"Newtonville, MA",5 star rating,"Kind and friendly service,  had vegetarian papusa platters and everything was perfectly cooked and made to order,  including beautifully textured yucca fries, delicious plantains,  and nicely prepared papusas.  The cabbage slaw was unexpectedly good. I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=4jzFjqv4fxSotqpThpYeyw,Beto Botija M.,"Candiac, Canada",5 star rating,"My favorite place for Pupusas, try the Yuca con chicharrón.  I'm from El Salvador and the Pupusas here are just like if you where there."
/user_details?userid=bCC9m7vuNKISQ-ckJ98fJQ,She H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We stumbled upon this restaurant and we really enjoyed  the pupusa and yuca fries. The horchata was also nice. The service is extremely friendly and the price is reasonable. On a cold day, if the patrons come in and out, it could very get cold, so dress warmly!"
/user_details?userid=EM0IL8Rz8GZS7Iab-AZxkw,M J.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,Great service and price.You can share many of the meals between friends.Home made salvadorien food and delicious puposas
/user_details?userid=H0gVSvuL8iUGIAqNfHhl9w,Erin H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"So inexpensive!  A new food experience for me as I had never previously tried the traditional El Salvadorian dish `papusa` - A maize flour-dough disk filled with a selection of ingredients such as black beans and chicken. Topped off with a lot of tomato sauce and some spicy garlic sauce. Super yummy!It was a nice, filling and satisfying sit down meal on the mega cheap. Yay!"
/user_details?userid=w_cqB6SgMd7aQw4031EbbQ,Dawn B.,"Ottawa, Canada",5 star rating,"Pupusa heaven. Whenever I go to Montreal, I usually try to eat here. Super cheap food, yet so delicious. My favourite is the cheese pupusas and always the homemade slaw in the jar. You can't go wrong with this place and how little you pay for a filled up belly. Highly recommend."
/user_details?userid=vMZb3I2V_RvtdnbOPPDAuA,Marc H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Ever staggered into a town square in San Salvador at 2am, half-cut and on the hunt for a savoury hit? Abuelas flipping corn tortillas over charcoal, the enormous pots of pickled cabbage, tomato sauce, pupusas frying and chicharron ... Ok, ok, so it's freezing outside, and the action is all happening in the kitchen, but simply put, of the several Salvadorian eateries in and around Beaubien/St Zotique/Bélanger, you need no other than this one. The flavours are all here: fresh and crunchy cabbage to offset the greasy pupusas and wholesome tamales, hard shell tacos, salty as hell chicharron, and one of the most amazingly pungent hot sauces I've ever eaten (be sure to request it). Order:-Chicharron-Pupusas (2)-Chicken Tamale-Hard shell beef taco-Yuca fries"
/user_details?userid=HitBeoSnehT8bvq-PGRG2g,Courtney H.,"West End, Halifax, Canada",3 star rating,"Cheap cheap yummy pupusas! Don't order more than two, unless you're starving - they definitely aren't as tasty reheated. Not a super special experience but not bad at all. The churros are filled with caramel but cold and doughy! Tasty sweet Horchata though."
/user_details?userid=ikHTdbcQrKNVvnyetPvTIg,Monica N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I'm not an expert in El Salvadorian food but La Carreta definitely rules the cheap eats in our city. Their pupusas are cheap and delicious. They also have a variety of meat and veggie options. Not interested in pupusas? They also have guacamole salad, plantains, tacos, burritos and tasty homemade horchata that apparently is really delicious with rum if you are a daredevil and your alcoholic tendencies forces you to sneak a flask in (I don't know anything about this). Either way, I recommend this place for anyone and everyone because there is something on the menu for all and you don't have to break the bank doing it."
/user_details?userid=Yn-ODU13uFNO_p0HZWZuXg,Nance M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love this place! It's my go to spot since its in my  neighbourhood. The pupusa's are fantastic! Fresh, authentic and the flavours are amazing. I love that they bring you a giant mason jar of spicy  coleslaw with your meal."
/user_details?userid=KIBnDrvylvrvhr4Ow6OIAw,Edgar M.,"Villeray-Saint-Michel-Parc-Extension, Canada",5 star rating,"La Carreta has been in business since 1991 and has recently changed administration. In my opinion the change has improved the restaurants image. The pupusas (corn patty stuffed with pork, cheese and fried black beans) are a little greasy but still very tasty. They lack a little bit of cheese as well. The service is okay. They seated myself and the group I was with fairly quickly but when it came to order it took our waitress(which i think is the new owner of the place) forever to bring it to our table. But what they lacked in service they made up in taste. It was cooked to perfection. Even though the service is not the best, I'd come back for the food and drinks. Their menu selection is pretty big so you can be sure I'll write about La Carreta a lot more. Enjoy!!"

The quiet restaurant serves pretty good food, but overall I had a bad experience with the service and wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends."
/user_details?userid=fzCFYwjrTyvCKoecPuq3Bg,Shauna F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Decent enough food and just acceptable service. Prices too high to justify this level of insufficiency. I have a feeling that this place is letting itself slide...
/user_details?userid=BxMnttiad63-aWEpSTaftQ,Ais C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Fantastic el salvadorian restaurant. The papusas are fantastic, the service is warm and friendly and laid back. The burritos, meatball special, and yuca fries are great too - and I haven't tried their soups, but I've seen them come out of the kitchen and they look pretty amazing. Wash it down with a bottle of cheap/mediocre wine, OR their awesome sweet rice drink orceata (spelling probably off). A great place for a comfort  meal."
/user_details?userid=bsY_GQqKzgYdf9JPCiT8oA,Malea R.,"Northampton, MA",5 star rating,"Ended up at this little spot by chance. Was in the neighborhood and looked on Yelp for a recommendation. What a treat! Freshly made papusas with house made pickled slaw and tomato sauce in every combination we tried were wonderful. We got a pitcher of the tamarind water and split a chicken and cheese papusa while deciding on two combination platters that contained a papusa, crispy yucca fries and enchiladas and tacos. Yucca was crispy outside and tender inside. And once covered in that pickled slaw and sauce made a meal all its own. The enchilada platter was more like a traditional tostada. Flat, crisp, covered in perfectly seasoned meat and sprinkled with cheese. The pork, bean and cheese papusa was simply the best. Papusas are a steal at around $ each with heaping platters starting at $8. Fill your belly for cheap and leave so happy. Don't let the looks fool you. This place is a diamond in the rough."
/user_details?userid=lGhtC6yJlzfDUe4wjZ6ArA,Kristine B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A friend brought me here for lunch once. She insisted I try the bean/pork/cheese puposas and have a big glass of horchata with it. She didn't steer me wrong! The puposas could have been a touch warmer, but came with delicious slaw and probably the best hot sauce I have ever come across. Tangy, spicy and soo flavourful! Get the horchata, it's the perfect pairing for this meal, just sweet enough and just cinnamonny enough to offset the richness of the food."
/user_details?userid=L08GfhVNFsRQ4fdthnzNpA,Tee J.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,This is one of my favourite places to eat.  I love their pupusas.  They also have great breakfasts. Delicious!
