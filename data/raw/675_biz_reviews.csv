/user_details?userid=jv71Iloh-cvbLQkFfBKOYA,James F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We wandered into this place and ended up being pretty happy with it. The atmosphere was elegant. Waitress was friendly. We started out with margaritas @ $8. We were given frozen with salt and realized we hadn't specified and the waitress hadn't asked. Oh well. There was a table d'hôte menu and an a la carte menu. We went a la carte. My son had 4 carnitas tacos with black refried beans, guacamole and pico de gallo. My girlfriend had cochinita pibil. I had mole con pollo. The cochinita pibil was very good. That's what I'll get next time. My mole was fine, but not the sublime mole I keep looking for an not finding in restaurants. The tacos seemed good. Total damage was $95 plus tip for three of us, after the 15% grand opening discount. It's not your California tex-mex restaurant. It's not as authentic as el rey del taco in marché jean-talon. But it's a nice up-scale Mexican restaurant that I would return to for a romantic dinner."

/user_details?userid=ahDxPzmaQuSOQtQMvZryZw,Anthony B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I've been here twice and the food is pretty good. It's always empty though and despite this the service is kind of slow. The waitress we had both times was young and really nice though. The prices are a bit high too. The first time I got enchiladas and they were good. I started with their tortilla soup and that's was actually the best part. My partner got the steak fajita and its pretty big, but they don't give you enough tortillas.The second time I came and I really wanted to try a chicken dish and they said they were out of the sauce. Which is a shame, since I remember it being a really common sauce. I went with the enchiladas again, it was the same. I'll probably come back a third time since it's so close and hope it gets better."

/user_details?userid=VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw,WhiteFeather H.,"Ottawa, Canada",4 star rating,"I'm definitely a fan. The ambiance alone is a win: nice lantern lighting hung as tin stars all throughout the restaurant from high ceilings. It's a family affair, so you've got the adorable old guy sitting at the bar counter, with maybe an auntie. The cook really enjoys dinging that ready bell on the kitchen counter to let the daughter know the dishes are ready. I'm assuming it's the daughter. Really sweet people. The music makes you feel like you're in some 1970s resort, or the on the set of a latin soap opera and hearts are bleeding somewhere. The food is good - especially the pulled pork tacos (recommend those over the chorizo sausage ones). The refried beans are a dream. Definitely go for the spicy sauce. My date and I split two entrees and a main dish and were totally satisfied. My tortilla soup could have been served a little warmer but that would be my only suggestion for improvement. If you're looking to be transported out of a cold, dark night into a comfortable and enjoyable family vibe with tasty foods, this place will do the trick!"

Rice had a different flavor.  , I had the enchilada roja it was good. My sig other had the enchilada mole sauce too sweet. Mostly just ok including margaritas. Need fresh lime juice."
/user_details?userid=ISv-8tCc1WuQ6iJu6hqX0g,Carlos A M.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"They charged me twice, the food was dry, they also avoid to print my bill to not pay taxes.... We also ordered some cocktails, nothing special.... Just soda and a bit of tequila (supposed to use fresh juice). There are many good Mexican restos in Montreal. AGAVE is not in the list. Sad because is well located and it has a nice decoration..."
/user_details?userid=6IK22xr0GItLt8bdkOdEhw,Anna P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Food was good and the drinks big. The chocolate sauce for the churro was amazing! Service was a little slow but good. No kids menu which was a bummer but split the 6 taco platter whith my 3 & 4 year old and that was plentiful. WouldGo back.
/user_details?userid=0KZNZKVCTpURutG_qbMKzg,Alejandro A.,"Vancouver, Canada",1 star rating,"Well it is rare I have such a bad experience in a restaurant as I did here. The taquitos were a bit bland and the chicken inside had a soft texture which I hate but I was so hungry I finished them with my friend. We ordered palomas to go with them. I love palomas but these tasted metallic...like a diet soda. The worst of the meal was when my friend was going to pay. He paid with his credit card and did not get a receipt (probably because they want to avoid taxes) and we left. As soon as we were outside the server came out. Supposedly the payment did not go through. My friend went back in and showed her his credit card transactions. Nevertheless, the server did not believe him and made him pay again. His credit card now shows 2 transactions with the same amount. We are never going back!"
/user_details?userid=w01hd3eejoOkE6kQ9Q4g9A,Sofiane A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Ok food. Paid about 35$ per person, without alcohol and tip on top. Cheese on top was cold. Coffee was bad. Nice atmosphere Waitress was friendly. Great location."
/user_details?userid=KPcplc4qseYkatxN24k3Kg,Cecilia L.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"We went for dinner with some friends, it took a good hour or more to get some poorly prepared tacos and not even an apology for the delay, I guess that's the way they operate. Drinks were far from other Mexican Restaurants. I really hope they close soon because they are in a prime location, it's really nice in the summer and I would like to go to that place again, but the awful service and food is really not worth it..."
/user_details?userid=giedJnthMXJXCkGrEvsH6g,Urban C.,"San Francisco, CA",2 star rating,"Stopped by for dinner. Tamarind aqua fresca was watered down; chicken mole was average, kind of bland. Would've given the place 3 stars but the service was slow. Had to wait close to 45 min. for our food because the kitchen was backed up - they couldn't handle a full house."
/user_details?userid=H8n9aOF9dcBRD6wd-hw1zQ,Jeff K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Excellent Mexican cuisine and welcome addition to the neighbourhood. Lots of typical plates that you can't find in most other Mexican restaurants such as as ceviche, mole, soupa de tortilla, etc. Great cocktails as well including hand made margaritas from fresh limes. Good decor, but it could use some more lighting on the outside of the building.."
/user_details?userid=e0MOT2LI9_sMN5VdAFnbKA,L S.,"Brooklyn, NY",2 star rating,"I live in this neighborhood so I knew I couldn't avoid this place forever. It does look appealing from the street, with its wide-open garage door windows. But the food is mostly lousy, and so are the drinks. It was my first Mexican food in Montreal, and probably my last."
