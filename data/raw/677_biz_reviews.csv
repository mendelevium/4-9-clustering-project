/user_details?userid=JGjtkOtTs8oFg0AhAeyPVA,Rannie B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Yessss ! Found a new favorite sushi place. This sushi counter has everything I like. Simple, traditional sushis made with good quality ingredients. They don't skimp on the fish either.  They also have original offerings like a ''deconstructed sushis'' complete with rice, fish (4 kinds), spicy tempura, gourd, wakame and other salads.  The very best part is their prices.  The quality is similar and often higher then what one would get at the more trendy sushi restaurants for about half the price.A fancy sit down restaurant it is not. It's more of a take out place.  It's in the Wilderton shopping center, close to the Metro store. There are 4 or 5 small tables and a few seats at the counter if you want to eat there.They also offer ''party platters'' for about 8-10$ per person. You can't beat that.  They are always busy but the 5 or 6 people behind the counter keep it rolling at a good pace.They have been there for 6 or 7 years.  I'm sad I only learnt about their existence now."

/user_details?userid=N_57AnTT9-_hGMeB16iBvg,Mei D.,"La Puente, CA",4 star rating,"I come here all the time since it's in the same shopping center as the market! The sushi is always fresh and tasty at a very reasonable price. They offer a pretty good selections of rolls and sushis but the hot/cooked options seems limited. I always get the pre made sushi boxes since it has a great combo of rolls, fresh and fast! The ladies that work there are always super nice and accommodating to my picky kids and their special orders!Overall it's a great place to get take out or grab a quick lunch not really a place to have a nice date night dinner. Since it's in the middle of the shopping center and there are people walking by."

The chef platters are a great deal if you're having a casual get together. I love their sashimi lunch special.
/user_details?userid=hFt0TaGArFRZBJlBoXymEQ,Canary 2.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,Love to get the 37 pc platter for 3 that sells for $30. Have to get my wakame salad as a side. Like their version of sushi pizza too. Very good quality for a great price!
