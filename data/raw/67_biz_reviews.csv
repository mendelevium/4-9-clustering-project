/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,I tried out this popular Mile End Resto for Sunday brunch with 8 of my foodie group friends and loved loved the whole experience - hence the 5 star rating! The ambiance and decor is truly lovely with it's tall windows overlooking Laurier Ave. Very elegant and classy!  They also have a wonderful covered terrasse which is heated in the winter.The resto does take reservations for Sunday brunches which is awesome. Also lots of street parking in the AM which is free until 1pm on Sundays! The service was great!  Very friendly and quick! Lemeac is a french cuisine resto and the food was delicious. Lots of variety to choose from! I ordered the poached egg on a crepe with smoked salmon which was AMAZINGLY Delicious!  So fresh and tasty!  Most dishes are served with their delicious buttered crispy baquette and freshly made jam purees!  We also ordered  a side of their home made beignets(donuts) -  melt in your mouth perfect for sharing!!! Small bowl of 2 donuts and 3 donut holes! Trying eating them with their jams!  Delicious!  I will definately go back and recommend to try at least once!  You do get your money's worth!  Great place for all occassions! Check out my pics!

I cannot say this is my favourite place for French food in Montréal but it is a staple for the French cuisine and you should check it out if you have a chance and have not yet been.We had the truffle salmon tartare, crab cakes, braised short ribs and the foie gras. Portions were on the smaller size for the appetizer but all quite delicious. The short ribs were amazing! Price is as expected. A bit on the higher side; 7/10 for value and price.8/10 for atmosphere9/10 for food quality 7/10 for portion size 9/10 for service"

And the service is always impeccable. If you eaten here before, you understand. If you haven't, why haven't you? For those of you like me who can't afford eating here regularly (not that it isn't reasonable) they have an amazing late night super affordable menu. Done and done. Enjoy!"

We got lucky and had terrasse seating, it was spacious yet cozy. Service was excellent. Ordered the salmon blinis, texture and flavours were all so perfect. French baguette that came one the side was crispy and buttery. Iced latte was refreshing and very good too. For dessert, we gave in and shared a plate of beignets and fruits. Overall super happy and will definitely come back!! Ps. They take reservations for brunch!!"
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Read my first review for my overall take on this restaurant. The purpose of this update is simply to extol the virtues of some new dishes I tried recently.-The scallops on mashed potatoes was one of the greatest dishes I have had in a very long time. My wife ordered it, but I ate at least a third of her plate. The description of the dish seems boring, I know. Nevertheless, the execution and technique on display here is at an expert level. The scallops have a bright lemony flavouring that is bursting with flavour without any hint of sourness whatsoever. You take one bite and keep asking yourself how could something taste this good!? The peppery mashed potatoes are only partially broken down lending a hearty texture to the dish. Flavoured similarly to the scallops, it pairs perfectly with the seafood along with some tasty strands of broccolini. -The boudin noir appetizer was absolutely delicious. I was a bit tentative to order blood sausage as I had only tried it once years ago at Burgundy Lion and thought it was awful. This version however tastes like a delicious onion flavoured meatloaf with the consistency of moist chocolate cake. Topped with small cubes of sweet cooked apples and served aside celery root, this is the perfect example of how stepping out of your comfort zone can be rewarding.-The rib steak with pepper sauce was a big miss. I'm not taking off stars because every restaurant is entitled to something they don't prepare well. Nevertheless, the cut of meat had almost no fat marbling whatsoever. Ordered medium rare, it was served a solid medium on the verge of medium well. Even with that mistake, a good ribeye steak should still be tender and dripping with juices. What was served was too tough and lacked seasoning and flavour. I'm so surprised because Lemeac usually excels at everything they do. It looks like I found their Achilles' heel. Of course, the pepper sauce served alongside the steak went a long way towards masking the poor quality of the meat, but given how well they prepare a hangar steak, it's shocking how bad they are at the ribsteak. The french toast dessert is beyond gigantic. The slice of bread used is essentially the size of 4 normal slices of bread stacked atop each other. It's tasty, but a little too sweet and unidimensional. I think the warm bread pudding I had once tried is the better dessert.Anyways...... everybody is friendly here, the fries and bread are stellar as always, and it's nearly impossible to have a bad overall experience. Of course, free flowing wine doesn't hurt, but the food and atmosphere speak for themselves."

Trust me, you can't really go wrong with any selection on their menu!!"
/user_details?userid=MqhhHaIcNwDCTblkCOf1Ug,Jean JD Audouin D.,"Lake Clear, NY",4 star rating,"arrived early to a queue at the front door awaiting the morning service to begin. Thought that was a good sign. Upon entering my excitement was building as i have heard great things about Leméac. I was not disappointed. Our table was in the front room ( of multiple rooms ) next to the window. I could of used a shade from the morning sun and peering eyes from the street but it was a minor inconvenience. The crisp linens and the polished silverware was a great canvas to my upcoming meal. Our waitress was attentive, knowledgeable, and very pleasant. Our coffees arrive and we dove into the menu. I was drawn to their signature dish of homemade blood pudding, celery root puree and cider sauce while my guest choose the fresh herb raw milk cheddar omelette. Each plate came with the obligatory baguettes along with a few confitures. My boudin was textually similar to a soufflé which was amazing and the earthy flavor profile was on point. This dish was well balanced with its accompaniments, a total pleasure to eat. The omelette was perfectly cooked. The silkiness and tang from the cheese danced on your tongue and was not your normal omelette, I will be duplicating this at home for sure. We wrapped up the meal with a 30gr cheese platter which was delicious, but some cheeses were taken out of the walk-in a bit too late and not given enough time to come up to room temperature which lent itself to a little disappointment not allowing them to come up to their true potential. I appreciate all the 5 star reviews out there for Leméac. I would've given it a 4.5 if I could, in my humble opinion and believe is more in-line with the level of cuisine. I'd go back in a heart beat and would try the mid week menu options, which would not surprise me to push it to a 5."
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Exceptional brunch at Leméac, one of my favourite brunches in Montreal! The ambiance and service was wonderful. We were seated on the terrace and we're not rushed at all. Their coffee was so good I ended up ordering a second cappuccino. I ordered the gravlax plate and my friend had the omelette with fries. Everything was delicious. I ordered a side beignets, they were fluffy and not overly sweet. Our meals also came with  toasted baguette served with fresh passion fruit and raspberry jams. Just an overall nice experience. I'd suggest Leméac brunch for a nice occasion since it's pricier than other places."

/user_details?userid=KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg,Gabrielle L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I came for the late night menu. We went to the spa beforehand and left there late so we were able to get a table at 11 pm. It was pretty packed! This was my second time going for the late night menu and my third time overall. Honestly I would only go for the late night menu because it is so worth it!! Why pay full price when you can get an appetizer, an entree (i.e. main) and a coffee/tea for $28!?! We each got a glass of wine. I got a white wine and my boyfriend got a red. Both wines were excellent.I got the snails, with pasta (looks like macaroni), portabella mushroom and tomato ragout with basil sauce appetizer. I highly recommend it! I really enjoyed the foamy basil sauce. So much so that I used the bread to clean up the remaining sauce on the place. My boyfriend got the grilled calamari and zucchini appetizer. It was very good but if you don't like balsamic vinegar you will not like this dish. For the entree I had the duck confit with potatoes and salad. The duck was good but it was a little bit more cooked than I would have liked. Same with the potatoes. I didn't finish my potatoes because I was full. I also had some of my boyfriend's fries. The fries are really good here. Crunchy and salty goodness! The salad takes up half of the plate but OMG this simple salad was awesome! I ate the whole thing! The greens were so crunchy and there was so much dressing but not too much. Even my boyfriend was impressed. My boyfriend had the steak and fries entree. I had to finish his plate because he was so full. He really enjoyed it, as did I. He really wanted the creme brulee but sadly the last one was taken 3 min before we ordered. I felt so satisfied after that meal. My boyfriend really enjoyed his first time here! We shall be back! If you love french food it is a must! I would like to go back to try their brunch. I heard good things!"
/user_details?userid=PYbjreZpONNMp25uRSPB-A,Ken S.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"KenScale: 8.0/10The last night of our trip in Montreal was especially brutal with a snowstorm that made it impossible for my wife Jun and I, along with our couple friends, to walk on the street for five minutes without finding a shelter soon after. Perhaps that's why the dinner reservation that our friend from Montreal made was suddenly canceled. Scrambling for a back-up option, she was able to direct us to a classic French bistro named Leméac. In retrospect, it turned out to be not a bad Plan B at all. Jun and I had eaten plenty of French bistro food in New York City, and during our meal it was not easy to come up with a place we had been to that was as consistent as the dishes coming from the kitchen.After a full afternoon of spa date, everyone in the group was starving, which made it easier for us to order as many dishes as we had would have liked for sharing. The goat cheese was a great complement to the apple and walnut salad which quickly disappeared in minutes. I didn't have much expectation for the cold foie gras torchon, but it actually wasn't bad at all. If you feel for something a little more hearty in the appetizer department, I highly recommend mushroom ravioli with pine nuts and arugula and/or the asparagus and wild mushroom risotto, each of which was rich without overpowering the palate and worked as a great antidote to a cold winter night. The mussels and French fries were unfortunately disappointing (the mussels should've come out much warmer in temperature), and the angus beef filet mignon, accompanied by braised king mushroom and red wine sauce, was also pedestrian. On the other hand, the duck breast with dumplings, shiitake mushrooms and bok choy was quite capably roasted to give the type of texture Jun and I usually look for in a duck dish. Don't skip the desserts at Leméac. My sweet tooth wife gave a thumps up to the decadent chocolate profiteroles that wasn't shy in the generous use of chocolate, and the banana and dates sticky toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream on top was also a standout dessert that everyone in the group gladly enjoyed.The restaurant was not fully packed during our meal, perhaps in part because of the weather that made it difficult to venture outside. The charming neighborhood feel of the restaurant is a big plus to the dining experience at Leméac, as is the inviting staff showing full of Montreal hospitality to outsiders like us. There is an extensive French-centric wine list, with some great value options from the Rhone Valley, that you should not skip for complementing the meal. Leméac is not the sexist restaurant in the vibrant Montreal dining scene but it is not a restaurant you will walk out disappointed."

/user_details?userid=h_afCgW-XZ8FjwGbhHxgRw,Lily C.,"Boston, MA",2 star rating,"Asparagus and wild mushroom risotto; Grilled beef hanger steak, French fries, and Maitre d'Hòtel; Aged rib steak (21 oz.), French fries, pepper sauceYou know the saying, ""you get what you paid for""? Well, we certainly did not. This is why the old adage (from Shaz and my sophomore year) was ""4 stars, 2 dollar signs."" It worked and we were never disappointed. The place itself felt stuffy, as it should to college students. But the service was slow -- we were waiting for so long, left staring at the doorway for our dishes.Let's start on the risotto. I've never made one, but I know how they taste. This one was salty. On top of that, it was undercooked. And that, you can't fix with downing water. The hanger steak was not bad -- by far the best of what we got.Now, to the star of the show. A friend and I split the 21 oz. aged rib steak. He prefers medium rare and I prefer closer to medium well, so we 'compromised' on a medium (sorry, Kyle LOL). When it came out, it looked so nicely seared. But when we cut into it, it was rare. English isn't my first language, but I'm pretty sure 'rare' isn't 'medium' in any country. The last photo shows an edge piece, but it got more red the closer to the bone it got. 'Blue' is a color; not how I want my steak cooked. The last kicker was how much of the steak was just fat. So much fat. In total, I'd say a good third of it wasn't edible (not taking into account the bone)."

Applause to the chef! And staff! Always the best ambience and atmosphere. Good service. Smiles all around. But the food! Wow! Today we tried their brunch and it was perfect. The best bacon and sausages. I'm not a fan of over salted foods and these were perfect. I want to know where they get their bacon and sausages. Happy to have found this amazing place. It's not easy to always maintain the high standard but Leméac has done it! Bravo!
/user_details?userid=3x-kbXQUhrsWOcp8mUimbw,Jenn C.,"Whitchurch-Stouffville, Canada",4 star rating,"I was showing friends around town and wanted to bring them for a classic Montreal experience (don't worry, we hit up Schwartz's and Fairmount Bagel too), and Leméac was recommended to us by other hometown friends. For some reason they told us it was kid-friendly (we would be out with two infants) and when I read up on the reviews, I didn't really get the sense that it was. However, we ended up moving our Saturday early dinner reservation to brunch the next day, and I would say that no one batted an eye about the children, even on Saturday when we already had the babies in town and were trying to move the reso to a later time. In fact, the staff were very accommodating in trying to arrange for a spot that would fit a car seat and high chair. There is a beautiful terrace on the side of the restaurant too.The brunch menu is served until 3pm on weekends but you can absolutely still order off of their regular menu. There are lots of classic dishes such as frites moules (fries and mussels), steak frites (steak and fries, which I've heard is excellent), and calf liver with onions. They have offer a $27 table d'hote available after 10pm with a decent selection of items. Noteworthy choices from our brunch included the French toast - a super thick slab drizzled with chocolate - my friend (who loves French toast) declared it one of the best he's ever eaten; duck leg confit - crispy and melt-in-your-mouth; and my salmon pot au feu. The salmon fillet ever-so-gently poached in a delicate sea salt (buttery-tasting and savoury) broth was still rare in the middle, and the assortment of root vegetables were tender-crisp and flavourful. I would say that the one downside is the service. They were extremely busy, even for my 1:15pm reservation, and it took a while for the hostess to even appear - there were four groups ahead of us and none of them had been helped when I arrived just after 1pm. The waiter, while friendly, also took a while to appear, and when he did, it was to order everything (drinks and food) at once - I would have loved to be able to finish my cava before my food arrived. In any case, I still enjoyed the meal, and would come back.Oh! There is valet parking offered for the area and conveniently, the car drop off is right in front of the restaurant (heading west but I think you get there heading east as well, since the drop off is on the median). $5 for 3 hours, and $2 every hour afterwards."

Walking in, you know this place has class, thanks to the welcoming staff in uniform, the dark chairs and white tablecloth tables, and prominent chandeliers. We opted for a seat on their covered terrace seeing it was a beautiful sunny day. The place was already busy so I would understand why reservations are needed; we were lucky to snag two spots as we were there quite early.The menu offers refined brunch options from fruit and cheese to boudin, and classic brunch cocktails like mimosas and bellini. We ordered one of each and both opted for the poached eggs, blinis, smoked salmon and caviar. The cocktails were great and the food, which came with toasted bread, rhubarb and mango spreads, was outstanding! The drinks sh was both sweet and savoury, and those blinis were just perfection! The prices are higher than your typical brunch spot but this 19$ dish was well worth it!Service was prompt and very friendly even though the place was real busy; food and drinks arrived quickly once we ordered, and the staff were quick in picking up empty glasses and even refilling our water.  We lingered for a bit, people watching and sipping on an iced coffee, which was the perfect way to end our visit!"

The specials included morels and fresh petit pois, but the hit was the halibut with asparagus and fiddlehead ferns. My French is non existent, so I did not understand what the sauces were, but they were amazing. A foam that provided acidity and a light creme that added umami and fat. Yum!  The sautéed calamari with zucchini and balsamic was terrific. The Balsamic vinegar glazed the zucchini and got slightly charred giving the fish an unexpected smokiness."

/user_details?userid=1kNsEAhGU8d8xugMuXJGFA,Calvin S.,"Winnipeg, Canada",4 star rating,"3.5/5, +.5 for serviceLemeac was my dinner stop in Montreal during my stopover before heading down to the states. I've personally had French food a few times, but my parents wanted to try what real, authentic French food tastes (and experiences) like.I reserved for 7:45pm, and there was immediately a table for us. The employees initially greeted to us in French, and while I do understand French, I had to politely ask them to speak English as my parents don't, and I wasn't in a translation mood that night. The French menu was in red and the English menu was in black, so it was easy for waiters/waitresses to identify which tables need an English translation.For starters, we had the escargots and house smoked salmon. Both these dishes were unique and delicious in their own ways; the escargots in particular came with pasta and an interesting basil sauce. For entrees, we ordered the braised beef short rib, grilled veal chop, and fresh Icelandic wild cod. The veal chop was probably the best of the entrees due to its presentation and the mozzarella cheese addition on the top, while the short ribs were not the best due to the fact the short ribs fell off way too easily from the bone.We also ordered two desserts, which were the chocolate mousse and the banana cake. The banana cake, in my opinion, is a must try; it's not something you'd expect especially with the term ""pop corn"" in the description. The chocolate mousse was good as well, though nothing eye-popping special. Sometimes simplicity works too.Service was excellent, and all servers in the restaurant were perfectly bilingual. Do request for an English menu before you sit down though."

Service is pretty good, professional staff.Apetizer: Snail - it's pretty flavorful, the sauce and tomato light up the dish.Smoked herring salad - we were expecting more variety of veggie. But the fish is well seasoned.Entree:  beef tartar - not a big surprise, was expecting an egg on the top and more spice.Mussels in tomato sauce and white wine - sauce is delicious. Mussels are fresh.  Portion is surprisingly big!Duck leg confit - the duck is average, no surprise. Too much salad on the side. It's like the duck is the side dish instead."

The meal includes one choice of appetizer and one entree, along with tea or coffee. We were not disappointed. As a snazzy French restaurant, the service was very polite and pleasant. For appetizers, we ordered the Snail, Calamari, Arugala salad and Crabcake. All very delicious and appetizing but I enjoyed the Arugala salad and Snail the most. Fresh ingredients all around.For the Entrees, we ordered the famous Duck Confit, Short Rib and the Mussels. The pot of mussels is enough to share for 2-3 people. It was massive! The Duck was very tasty and came with a huge portion of lettuce salad. Finally, the Short Rib was ""fall off the bone"" and ingrained with flavour.Definitely recommend this place, especially for the late night menu which was a great deal."

Service was fantastic; quick and efficient. We ate 3 courses and made it out in about an 1.5 hours which is pretty good.  Rib eye steak was described as tender and flavourful. My warm salad was light but still satisfying.  Of course all of this was followed by the pain perdu which really is just a piece of really thick bread but man...it is divine. That dessert alone made my whole trip!

There is no coat service, so please hang up your own coats.AMBIANCE: Probably the most, luxurious, priciest, restaurant I've ever been to. And I LOVED IT.

A leisure walk from Laurier Station or you can catch a bus over. The neighbourhood is nice and plushy, fun even for window shopping since all of them were closed.We shared:House Smoked Salmon- ""fresh"" with a good biteEscargots, Portabello Mushroom and Tomato Ragout, Basil Butter Sauce- Love the presentation, nice contrast of colours and textureDuck leg confit, roasted fingerling potatoes and salad - The confit itself is A-OK, surprisingly moist, The only thing it the plate is loaded with cheap package salad that was not too freshBraised beef short rib, barley stew, Swiss chard and mint pesto - off the bone tenderness and good mix of lean and fat. The most interesting part though is the barley stew which was prepared perfectly with such interesting texture and complexity in tasteWashed down with Côtes du Rhône Villages Sinargues, Pierre Henri Morel 2010 ($11) - light and but peppery with a sharp finishRestaurant Lemeac can be quite noisy at time so you might not hear what your date said but just nod and smile and all will be good.I think I will be bring my date again next time when I am in town!"

Their beer list sucks in my opinion.  Just some ordinary beers but that's OK.We went for the late night menu, which if I'm not mistaken starts after 10.  You get an appy and entre for 25 and they have some amazing choices which would usually set you back 2-3 times as much.  Steak is great, and not cooked by an amateur.  It is done as requested and for a man with a blood lust like me ;) they make it as ordered!Anyways just go try it and if your el-cheapo like myself, try it after 10!"

This has been one of my favourite go-to spots in the city for years. It honestly exudes all the qualities I look for in a restaurant, from the quality of the ingredients, the excellent wine list to the impeccable service, Lemeac is ""un incontournable"". Whether you're looking to impress a client, or have an intimate date night, Lemeac caters to both. The menu offers classic French delicacies from escargot to beef tartare and foie gras, which are all equally excellent. Lemeac also distinguishes itself with its late night menu, where you can order from their classic table d'hôte including an entree and a meal for $22 after 10pm. This is the best value in the city! My personal favs are the vegetable tian followed by the salmon tartare with truffle oil, salad and pommes allumettes. And for ""la piece de résistance, try their desserts!

The $30 dinner special after 10 pm is a nice idea, however, the quality of of my meal and service was horrific. From the rude blonde manager greeting me poorly, and providing a horrible seat, in which I politely refused. To the lack of service by her and the waiter. I watched the blonde manager serve water to  tables around me, and ask people how they were, and purposely ignore me. The waiter never asked me how the meal was going either or if I needed anything else, but both he and the female manager continue to ask all the white patrons around me. The meal itself, the duck was dry and the potatoes burnt. I finally asked for the check and left. I regret tipping, especially after noting these concerns to the evening manager, and no apologies came my way. Disgusting experience, and honestly felt like a racist one too.! Wtf"

/user_details?userid=Gj-xAqmWwQKVqbC8h2vMoA,Michael S.,"Woodstock, VT",5 star rating,"My rating of Lemeac is based on six visits: dinners (solo and with my wife) and brunch. So why, with so many good restaurants to choose from in Montreal, do we return to Lemeac? It's an exceptional restaurant and we've never been disappointed.The menu offers French bistro standards, including offal dishes; at least six fish choices; steak and frites and mussels and frites; and many others. All our food was expertly prepared: my omelet at brunch, cooked in the French style, was perfect -- one of the best omelets I've had anywhere. An order of seared mackerel, served with white beans and thin slices of chorizo, was exceptional. Steak (ordered rare) was perfectly seared on the outside and properly rare. And the pommel frites are great.The place has a great vibe: there's nothing trendy about it, but it's a vibrant place. We like the fact that there's a real mix of people in the dining room: couples out for the night; groups of friends; families with children. Lemeac is a real neighborhood place and it's buzzing. One night we were there and it was snowing heavily; inside Lemeac, we and everyone else was having a good time despite the weather. Though the restaurant is energetic, the noise level isn't overwhelming.We've had very good service, though on a recent Saturday night our server wasn't quite as attentive as we've come to expect (then again, the restaurant was very busy). Some of the staff speaks English quite well if your French isn't up to snuff, and there's an Enlgish-language menu.The wine list has some good choices on it -- there good selections from among French, Italian, and other vintages and we found that our servers knew the wines and could talk about them knowledgably. A small, but very good, selection of wines by the glass, including some sparklers. Great cocktails.On one visit, we were staying at the Ritz. I was chatting to the concierge and he asked if we needed any dinner reservations. I told him we were fine and that we were going to Lemeac. He was surprised that, as Americans, we knew about it and nodded and said, ""Wow: that's a place that I'd go!""This is one of our favorite restaurants in Montreal. You can find places that are trendier and more well-known, but Lemeac seems like one of those place that's been around forever (though it opened in 2001). You can see why it continues to be so popular, though, once you go there. And, like us, you're likely to come back again and again."

All of the items we had here were fantastic and relied on the integrity of the item to make it good. There was no masking of flavors with insubordinate amounts of oil, butter or seasoning. The food tasted like it should and showcased the chefs ability to enhance natural food flavors. Our beef tartare was perfectly balanced and the pot au feu I had was nourishing and good to the last drop. It was simple but didn't feel lacking in absolutely anything.  In fact, I've been scouring recipes for the perfect pot au feu since I've had it here.

My friend liked the rillette, I've never had it before but I think it's pretty good.For the entree we ordered the duck leg confit and the roasted beef short rib with barley. The duck leg was cooked perfectly, the skin was so delicious crispy and fat . Roast rib was also really nice, falls apart easily and tasty. Will definitely come back. Good place for a date!"

This place is the perfect mix of any great French establishment but without the pretention that comes with it. I had almost the whole menu from the salmon and beef tartar to the hen chicken, ravioli and short ribs. I had brunch here too but I didn't enjoy it as much as dinner. My favorite item on the menu is the pain perdu which is an orgasmic desert. Everything is stellar. Great wine selection and also great service. It is a good idea to reserve if you're a big group especially after 22h. Le meac is a staple in Montreal and there's a reason they attained so much longevity!"
/user_details?userid=PVOtG_2eJOnJLoLmT_rQig,Shelvin S.,"Berkeley, CA",2 star rating,"Not too bad! The food definitely needs some improvement - some of the paired items didn't 'mesh' well together, making for a slightly interesting (negative) experience. Major food negatives: the steak was burnt (when ordered at medium), too much salt in every dish served (except the bread). The creme brûlée wasn't too shabby either, but it's presentation seems to have been an afterthought.Lastly, the service is both superbly slow, and probably one of the worse times I've had in Montreal. Decent place to check out, but expect to be delayed (45 mins for appetizer, 30 mins for main dish, 15 mins for dessert - delivered after order placed, definitely much slower than what a restaurant at this standard should be). The servers were quite impersonal as well, so in all, a quite strange and somewhat 'meh' experience at this place."

I felt lucky in securing a NYE dinner reservation, since many businesses closed around the holidays.  The restaurant decorations looked simple yet elegant, hanging silver balloons across the ceilings.Unlike many upscale restaurants that only offer limited-selection prix fixe menus at ridiculous prices on NYE, Leméac offered its regular menu at no additional cost.  The mushroom ravioli and arugula tasted so delightful, as was the smoked herring.  The duck leg confit was extremely tender and flavorful - excellent with the roasted potatoes.  I do wish the salad consisted of more than green beans with garlic, because it looked plain and lacked essence.While I'm not usually a fan of dates or pudding, the banana and dates sticky pudding was moist, sweet, and enjoyable with vanilla ice cream.The restaurant is located somewhat outside of city centre, but that is easily solved with a quick taxi ride.  Use Opentable to schedule a simple and quick reservation for your visit here."

I doubt we would have found this lovely brasserie on our own. The establishment is a bit outside of central Montreal, so, taking a taxi is essential in cold weather.I was thoroughly impressed with Lemeac. The place had a nice vibe to it, and like most hit restaurants in Montreal, it was packed with all sorts of characters enjoying themselves. When we arrived, we were seated at their cozy dining bar, with very comfortable chairs, even though there wasn't a lot of elbow room. Oh well, the cuisine, service, wine, and ambience made up for it!The modern Quebec cuisine is served with little fuss, in large portions. Pork rillettes were excellent, a must try; my main dish was equally delicious and satisfying. Had no room for dessert.Service was really great, even though the two ladies behind the bar were extremely busy mixing drinks, pouring wines, making coffee, and so on. They did their best to make us feel welcomed. The wine list is impressive, with many lovely French bottles to choose from, at wonderfully affordable prices, such as Mercurey rouge, for $65 or so a bottle. Yep, order me another bottle, merci!Can't go wrong dining here."

/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"Dear, dear Leméac, oh how you did not live up to the expectations I had for you.  Never having been when I lived in the city, I figured it would be worthwhile to give Leméac a try so I went with two friends (who have gone several times before) on a late Thursday evening to try their after 10pm special ($27 for an appetizer and entree and tea/coffee at the end).Place was bustling and busy. We were all hungry so we took a quick look at the menu and ordered a few drinks.  The appetizers were great:- Pankoe crusted goat cheese with apple and walnut salad - had a bite of my friend's dish and it was good, very rich tasting.- Grilled calamari with zucchini - you get lots of calamari. My friend couldn't eat hers which meant more for me to try!- Escargots in a basil butter sauce - the escargot sauce was green and frothy. Very cool. The mains were a different story:- I was not very impressed with my main (duck leg confit with salad and roasted potato fingerlings). The duck was dry, slightly shriveled and same thing with the potatoes. - Sea salt salmon pot au feu - AMAZING. Definitely order this if your going to go.- Toulouse sausage with a salad and side of mustard - the mustard was TANGY. Wow, consider yourself warned.  However, we were more impressed with the knife that they give you with the sausage meal (don't ask - it's a long story).Another issue we had was with our waiter, who was dreadful to put it nicely. He even managed to put down their coffee supplier (Moi Toi Café) when we were asked about tea/coffee at the end of the night. He was also incredible slow at getting our bill/then getting the machine, etc. I don't usually complain about service but you would expect better service, especially here.With so many good restaurants in the city, especially french, I can't really recommend going after my first time trying it."

/user_details?userid=U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,Michael U.,"Las Vegas, NV",4 star rating,"Full review blogged:The Space: A large space with stone floors, a long wooden bar, and white tablecloths the team who designed LeMeac did an excellent job of recreating the French Bistro experience and with a coat check up front, old movie posters in the back, and large windows flooding the room with light while fresh flowers softened the dark woods ever so slightly the room was effortlessly comfortable; the sort of place where both a business lunch and a romantic dinner would fit equally well.The Service: Seemingly an all-female staff save for the bartender LeMeac ran like a well-oiled machine despite the lunch time bustle and being the only primarily English table in the room we were gifted both English menus and a server whose command of the language was not only excellent, but lovely with her thick French accent and the occasional ""eh?"" enchanting enough that she could have sold me some beachfront property just outside the front door...or, if not that, at least $50 worth of Bistro fare plus a glass of wine.Cream of Mushroom Soup, Truffle oil, Creme Fraiche, Raw Mushrooms: A daily special, ordered by both my mother and my aunt, this aromatic potage was a highlight in a meal that frequently wowed as the rich soup was not overly pureed and thus maintained a bit of texture that played nicely against the tang of the crème.  Kissed with a top note of truffle and with slices of raw criminis tossed in for more texture this was where the bread really shined and both bowls returned to the kitchen spotless.Duck Foie Gras Au Torchon, Grilled Brioche, Peppered Pineapple: As much as I like dressed up foie gras preparations there is nothing quite like a nice naked torchon from a high quality bird and at LeMeac the Quebecoise product shined with a slight mineral undertone coursing through the smooth liver and beautifully cut by sea salt and fruit.  Served with only one brioche roll, split and grilled, my request for two more was granted without question, the smooth liver melting on the heated bread before melting on my tongue.Crab Cake, gribiche sauce and cucumbers with peppers: While I cannot explain my aunt's obsession with ordering crab cakes in even the most unlikely places this was actually a very good preparation from the restaurant's appetizer section and certainly large enough to suffice as a main course considering our day's agenda.  Dense yet fluffy and sweet with just a bit of spice the cake was low on both filler and frying oil while the salad of thinly sliced cucumbers was a great counterpoint.Panko crusted goat cheese, apple and walnut salad: Another appetizer for main course selection, my mother too went with a lightly fried option and as good as the crabcake was, this creamy puck of chevre was even better as it was warm but not gooey throughout and equally good spread on bread or taken with the salad and nuts.Duck leg confit, roasted fingerling potatoes and salad: Rustic as can be with perfect crunchy skin overlying supple flesh from just down the road at Mariposa Farm there really is not much more to be said about this confit; it was textbook and every bit as good as the oft raved version at Chez Dumonet in Paris...and as a matter of fact, my appetizer/main sequence at both restaurants were identical and all things being equal I'd be hard pressed to decide which I preferred.Lemon Curd Tartlette with lime coulis: Moving on to dessert, this was clearly my mother's choice and with the citrus nicely smoothed out by the sugar and egg yolks this creamy tart was quite nice, the sort of thing served at any number of Parisian bistros and nicely encircled by a rich butter crust.Banana and Date Sticky Toffee Pudding, Vanilla Ice Cream:  The next dessert, my own selection, would prove to be the richest of the trio and with a dense cake of steamed pudding centered in a puddle of caramel sauce it was also one of the sweetest desserts I have ever tasted with the fructose notes of both the dates and the banana coming through with aplomb and only partially tempered by the rich ice cream; definitely a dessert to order with coffee and a few other people to share.French Toast, Milk Jam Ice Cream, Maple Caramel: They say a picture is worth a thousand words and in this case it is probably also worth a thousand or more calories - simply stated, if you go to LeMeac you must order this.  Impossibly light despite the enormous portion, piping hot only to be cooled and saturated by an ice cream harkening the flavors of condensed milk, and more than enough to satisfy a group...a signature dessert to be sure.The Verdict:  A French bistro hitting the same highs as many of the best in Paris there really is not much else to be said about LeMeac; from the menu to the service to the execution of the food everything was on point and although perhaps not the most unique meal of the trip certainly one of the most enjoyable, particularly for someone who measures the quality of French cuisine by foie, duck, and pastry."
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Special occasions call for certain restaurants. Restaurants where not only is the food delicious but the overall experience is from top to bottom impeccable and without fault. There are not too many of said places but for my family in particular, Leméac continues to be one of these and as such, it was the perfect place to go celebrate my sister's 2nd university degree (tied with yours truly and soon to be passed me).For the uninitiated, Leméac is a classic French bistro on Laurier that has one of the best dinner terrasses in the city. Sadly, for this evening, we did not have a table there so we would have to make due inside. The interior has a modern bistro feel - stone tile floor, white walls, wooden chairs, white tablecloths and a gorgeous modern bar with leather bound high chairs. A very clean look that screams professional and upscale but still feels welcoming.As a a starter, I went with the house made blood pudding with celery root purée and cider sauce. Now... I know that blood pudding is not for everyone and a complete non-starter for some, however if you are tempted to try it, this would be the place to do so. Great texture to the pudding itself, the root purée nice and creamy and the richness of the sauce... dear god that cider sauce. So good. An excellent start all around.The other start I got to try was the escargots with portabella mushroom tomato ragout and basil sauce. Very different compared to the richness of the previous dish. Outside of the delicious escargots, the rest of the dish was all about freshness. Particular recognition must go to the sauce, a foamy basil sauce that paired everything together here so well. Amazing depth of flavour despite its consistency. The level of sauce work at Leméac has always blown my mind... and makes me feel wholly inadequate to attempt to make my own at home.We move on to the mains now. First up, a grilled shrimp salad and sesame oïl vinaigrette. Very asian-inspired dish in terms of flavours mostly because of the vinaigrette. The very large shrimps were grilled perfectly well and the mixed veggie salad underneath was nice.We also ordered a side of french fries because when one is at Leméac, you must order some whether it makes sense with your meal or not! Pretty much perfection in terms of fries - just the right cut and just the right mix of crunch and tenderness. Add a side of mayo for dipping and you are set to finish the entire bowl and order some more.My own main was the braised beef short rib with barley stew, swiss chard and mint pesto. The level of execution on the rib short blew my mind. I was able to pull the bone out without any effort and not a single strain of meat came with it. Just needed a fork to break it apart and enjoy the meaty goodness. The barley stew with the pesto and the chard were excellent as well but quite honestly, it didn't matter what else was in that plate because of that glorious cut of beef.Lastly, I just needed to order their classic pain perdu with maple caramel and ice cream. This thing is massive. Pictures don't do it justice... unless you have skipped a course, you will need help to finish this. Beautifully fresh bread crisped up nicely with a truly decadent caramel and silky ice cream. Perfect execution once again.Leméac was, as it always is, a excellent experience. Every course screams technique and execution. Great depth of flavours across the board. Great food, excellent wine list and very solid service means that you can never really go wrong here. If you are looking for a great French bistro experience, there is nowhere in Montreal that I can recommend more highly than Leméac. Just try to sit outside if you can... it will make it even better.Cheers!"

The meat literally fell off the bone, no knife needed! The skin was crispy and the flavor was so full but simple, at the same time. The salad and fingerlings that came with it were simple and excellent. My boyfriend got the mussels and fries. Best mussels I have ever had (and we eat them a lot). The broth had a strong dill flavor that was so perfect with the chewy mussels. To finish, we got the creme brûlée. Delicious! They also had an extensive wine list, we had a bottle of cote du rhone, which was fantastic.The whole staff was very attentive and also very sweet to us. We do not speak French, so we were nervous that we would have trouble going out-but they made it so easy and enjoyable!They also have $25 entrees after 10 pm, which I thought was a great idea and an amazing deal!The restaurant was very Parisian-esque with their small, closely packed tables and open-air seating.We will 100% go back if we are ever in Montreal again!!"

/user_details?userid=JgeoVFTqogho9VGJ1v4hpQ,Whitney G.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Amazing classic French bistro, Leméac is definitely worth a visit. Beautiful restaurant, incredible food. We got the arugula salad, gazpacho and ratatouille to start. Salad was light and fresh, gazpacho flavor was incredible, but the highlight of the apps was the ratatouille. Vegetables covered in cheddar and wrapped in a disc- really good. For the entree, we got sea bass and scallops. Sea bass was one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had. Perfectly light and flaky, offset by potato purée. For dessert, definitely get the French toast! SO GOOD."

/user_details?userid=tmqAnKBcKcVrAi2RxAD91A,Natasha F.,"Menlo Park, CA",2 star rating,"I found this restaurant overpriced and just trying to be something that it is not. My boyfriend and I decided to try a new place and wanted to go for a semi-formal nice dinner. We went at 8:30 on a Saturday night and the place was packed- at first a good sign. They sat us in this little alcove area and the chairs were very uncomfortable patio furniture. The menu offered a nice selection and we started with appetizers and cocktails. My cocktail, the cucumber Tom Collins, was quite watered down and I don't think my boyfriend enjoyed his Manhattan either. I ordered a mushroom ravioli starter with pine nuts and arugula- the best dish of the night. It was extremely fresh and delicious despite the fact that the dish was covered in oil. For my main course, I ordered the scallops. The dish was swimming in a few cm of butter. The portion was a nice size, but the quality was not great and everything was washed in the butter. My boyfriend ordered a nice bottle of French wine but it was extremely overpriced and not very good. We ended with dessert- I got the fruit with basil and coconut sorbet. The fruit wasn't as ripe as I would have liked but the sorbet was good.While the food overall was ok, the place seemed overpriced. It was trying to be a classy, chic French restaurant when in fact it was just a mediocre meal in a quite loud environment. In the future, I think we'll stick to the old port for nice French meals. We definitely will not be coming back here."

Service was good but probably not enough waiters/waitresses for the crowd as we went on a Monday night. Food was very good and well presented. Light portions. Wine list on the pricy side with bottles starting at 50 bucks and most being over $80. Overall 4 stars. My only complaint was that our coffees came out well after our desert.

This is the kind of restaurant where you walk in and everything smells amazing. We had a tough time deciding what to order because everything sounded delicious. The highlight of the night for me was my appetizer, the mushroom ravioli. They were so fresh and flavorful, served with more mushrooms and arugula. They have an entree portion too, which I'd probably order next time and try a different appetizer. The short ribs entree was very good, but I was not a fan of the mint pesto mixed with the barley. I felt the mint flavor competed with the other flavors in the dish and tried to overpower it. I chose to just eat the meat, which was perfect. My husband had the lamb chops and loved every last bite on his plate. For a side dish, order the fries. They were so, so good. The only disappointment of the night was dessert. The chocolate banana cake was good, but nothing special. The ""coffee flavored creme caramel"" was flan. My mistake for not asking for a description of the dessert and for assuming it would be mousse-like. In any event, it wasn't the best tasting flan. On our way back to the car, we saw that there was a cute dessert restaurant a few doors down - wish we had tried that instead!"

The short rib portion contained a trace amount of seasoning and stirred up feelings of emptiness and resentment.  Lamb meat definitely cooked to my liking but its lackluster marinade lead to its demise.  The creme brulee was ""loose"" and not thick enough. The server provided very little service and we had to ask multiple times for water and bread.  To add insult to injury, the total bill exceeded $100 with no measurable deliverables.  One pro: ambiance.  If you want to try food here, go after 10 pm when they have their $22 special where you get an app, an entree and coffee or tea."

The broth was addicting. I kept dipping the fresh french bread in it to soak it all up. My brother had the calamari which was nice a tender. For the main course I ate the angus steak. Hmmmm it was so good. It was a long piece of steak cooked medium rare topped with garlic butter which I rubbed it on the steak as it melted away. It came with fries which was perfectly cooked an seasoned, crunchy and soft. There was fresh whipped mayonnaise which was fantastic with the fries. My brother had the duck confit. That was some incredible to eat. It came with a large salad. The duck was buttery and it seemed to melt in your mouth.This a great spot for find dining with a great dinner deal. It has a mellow atmosphere. It just seemed that time stood still and you can get away from the world when you sat down. Our waiter held conversations with us which was nice.

The wine list is great, excellent by the glass selection. Food is impeccable.  I had lapin moutard, a standard.  Everything in the dish was good and it all worked together. Attention to detail went down to cooking each individual veg to al dente perfection, seasoning pefectly. I never wanted it to end. In Montreal generally, the farther North you go, the better the restos. Lemeac is a shining example. If you are yelping around for a brasserie, go to this place."

The sausage was flavorful and meaty, as opposed to the salty and fatty ones that I've had elsewhere and the potatoes were perfectly cooked, light and tasty, not starchy. In our group of 4, this meal rated as the best meal out of the 4 days we were in Montreal and our meals included stops at Liverpool House, L' Avenue and Brasserie T among others.

The food is gorgeous, generous, and tasty, especially the Panko Crusted Goat Cheese. I tried to make this salad at home and gotta tell you it's nowhere as good as what's served here: a nice wedge of fried panko crusted goat cheese served on top of julienned Granny Smith apple and salad, sprinkled with walnuts and tossed in the lightest citrus sauce. Try it, a bite of warm goat cheese and sweet and tangy salad with crunchy walnuts...heaven! The Grilled Calamari and Zucchini is also good. Their popular Homemade Blood Pudding is smooth, so smooth that it melts in your mouth. Don't forget to sprinkle some salt on it. On to the entrees that I've had and enjoyed in this order: Tuna tartare (chef's menu), Beef Tartare, Herb Crusted Calf Liver, and Braised Beef Short Rib. They have the best selection of wines by the glass, many of which you can't buy at the SAQ.The secret here? Come after 10pm, where you get an appetizer and an entre for just $25!

/user_details?userid=LubR-V3Lj0E5UQzP20U8nw,Heather S.,"Blainville, Canada",4 star rating,"Located on Laurier about a ten minute walk east of the Laurier metro and right next to the Juliette and Chocolat, Lemeac is a great find for the foodie on a budget.After 10pm, they offer a menu at $22 of fine offerings so reasonably priced i was outright astounded. We didn't let ourselves go wild with the wine list, which looked formidable, but we did relish a bottle of San Pellegrino. I am always happy when Perrier is not the ONLY choice of sparkling water at a restaurant.All three of us order the pankoe-encrusted hot goat cheese with shaved apples and walnuts as an entree. I cannot imagine a better entree - honestly.It was such a hit, we bought pankoe instead of breadcrumbs for lamb meatballs the next day - but that's another story. Our main courses were as follows: blood pudding (which i declined tasting but which supposedly was very nice), cornish hen (which i regretted ordering not because it wasn't great, because it was, but because, well, poultry is poultry) and a short rib. The short rib was deemed the WINNER of the evening.A great find over the course of the meal was what LOOKED like mashed potatoes, but was really pureed celery root. I must try recreating this at home. If you like blood pudding, order it just to try the accompanying vegetable.There is no dessert offered on the $22 menu - but their dessert menu is fantastic AND the french toast comes in huge portions. Possibly half the size of a loaf of bread, slathered in maple syrup and with an appropriate amount of ice cream, it easily satisfies three people already well-fed. I have been having dreams about this french toast ever since.People watching at a nicer restaurant is always a blast and we lived it up. At 1am we stumbled out onto the street having missed the last metro, which provides an indication of how much we were enjoying ourselves.Call ahead for reservations."

Don't get me wrong, the smoked salmon was also fantastic, definitely one of the best even to new york standard.

Wound up here after last night's debacle at Au Pied De Cochon and all I can say is thank you PDC for screwing up, because if you hadn't, I never would have gone here and missed one of the great meals of my life. PDC can't come close to what Lemeac can do, it is simply amazing. My wife and I are already planning to come back to Montreal all the way from St. Louis, MO to get a chance to eat here again - it's that good.Excellent from start to finish, with a wonderful waitress who explained everything with the best of humor in somewhat broken but charming English, so non-French speakers should not be afraid of this place. Started with an excellent version of a Tom Collins with a cucumber addition, my wife had a perfect Perfect Manhattan, complete with house marinated cherry, and daughter had their great version of a Cosmo, which she thoroughly enjoyed under Quebec drinking laws that allow 18 year-olds to drink. Appetizers were escargot, quail, the famous frites, and a house salad, all shared around the table.Then we get to the entrees - son had the duck, which was excellent, daughter had the smoked salmon dinner salad, which may be the prettiest salad presentation I have ever seen, and was outstanding, and my wife and I both had the special of the night, which we both agreed may be the best single entrée we have ever had, the veal sweetbreads. Only tasting menus at some of the best restaurants in the world like Alinea, Meadowood, and Blackbird can top it. Perfectly prepared, creamy, topped with a fois gras sauce, chanterelle mushrooms, cipolline onions and a carrot puree to die for, plus roasted purple carrots. Words fail to describe how good this was - and I'm not a big sweetbread fan until this. Just wow. Plus, we had them select an excellent wine to match by the glass and it was perfect, if unconventional. Didn't catch the name, but when a French bistro is willing to go to an Italian wine with a dish like this, they have my vote.Totally full by this point, still had to do dessert, which was just as good. Absolutely perfect crème brule, plus a sticky toffee pudding and a chocolate and banana cake, I think. Too food drunk to remember.Excellent value as well, considering the world class food. I've paid more for two than we paid for four and got far more quality. It's a bistro, so it's not quiet and intimate, but it's certainly quiet enough and highly recommended for your next trip to Montreal."

We arrived at 8pm on a Sunday and the place was packed) but were lucky enough to have a table on their covered patio. Our server was extremely professional yet friendly, knew the menu well and was able to recommend a good wine alternative (they ran out of our first choice). The food was extremely pleasing: we shared the foie gras and the tuna tartare (special of the day) appetizers and then had the filet mignon and scallops. Although everything was delicious, the tartare was to die for (perfect balance of flavours and textures!) - I would go back just to taste that tartare again!!So far, so good... but our experience was tinted when at the end of the meal (the restaurant was now almost empty) a small group of 6 people sat right next to us and were extremely unpleasant and loud... while this is not the staff's fault per se (although they could have been seated elsewhere), we were very unpleased with the way the situation was handled. My partner commented to a waiter (ours was busy with other tables) that we were dissappointed that the recently seated table next to us was being so loud and that we were hoping to have a coffee/desert (I.e. ready to spend more money in the establishment); instead of simply kindly offer us to be moved further away or inside the restaurant (now empty as mentionned earlier) the server replied that we were being difficult and that 6 people doesn't make for a loud group; making us feel bad for the situation... after a $200+ meal for 2 people, it wasn't quite the costumer service I was hoping for.

The omelette was rather basic, especially, for C$19. Likewise, the gravlax platter was good but the quantity was very limited. The French toast was a big hit though, ""worth a detour"" as Michelin would say. The iced coffees were very good as well. The chocolate mousse at C$13 was not to my taste- it was too light and fluffy and lacked body and taste. I did not feel it  was worth the price.

/user_details?userid=R9VN48r5gWHUQQ_gr_iMDw,Emily Y.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"My first night in Montreal, I went to Lemeac with my boyfriend. As usual, we read reviews on yelp and decided to go because of the $27 appetizer + entree after 10pm.After comparing with a few other restaurants, we booked through yelp right away because of the price of course, and due to late lunch that day.Since it was after 10pm, it was pretty hard to find and a little bit scary to walk around the area (we took public transportation). There were many English-speaking customers inside the restaurant and it was very very loud. So we decided to sit in the patio. It was romantic and pretty but a little bit dark. My boyfriend ordered crab cake for appetizer and I ordered fried goat cheese salad.The crab cake and the tartar sauce was delicious but nothing really special.Goat cheese salad was good but it was too heavy to finish it before a main dish so I didn't finish it. The apple and walnut salad part was very fresh and tangy.Now the main entree! We ordered steak and fries, and the braised short ribs. The steak was AMAZING. The shape was unique (long horizontally shaped), perfectly cooked, melted in my mouth. It was the best steak I ever had in my life. There was herbed butter and salt on top which pushed the taste to the next notch. Fries were not soggy and fried just right  but again, nothing really special about it. I did not really like the braised short ribs but my boyfriend loved it. It had a lot of flavours going on.. like lots of herbs. There was barley stew at the bottom... which wasn't my thing.. to much herbs.. and minty flavours. BUT my boyfriend loved it so I guess it all depends on if you like herbs or not. He also loved the steak and we wanted to come back the next night !!!We didn't order any extra stuff.. just had our appetizer and the entree and it came to around 60 dollars for both of our meals. Service was good, nothing to bad, servers could speak English finely.I recommend it strongly !!! Great price + Excellent food!"

Service was impeccable and the bread, salad, and our main courses (cod and braised short rib) were fresh and delicious.  We topped off the delicious meal with light and fresh blancmange with citrus and passion fruit. We wished we had more time in Montreal to come back and try more items on the menu. Bon appetit!"
/user_details?userid=UXcOSMHZM2RPWTgjQbKDJg,Daniel T.,"Philadelphia, PA",4 star rating,"A quick check on the Internets revealed an enticing 25$ after 22hr special that brought us to the door.  The idea of a fixed priced menu at a late night hour along with being in close proximity to a college, where a money pinched student can take a date, sounds effective.  All the while having a clean cut and somewhat intimate setting, it certainly can be.As we seat ourselves, the expected rush of college-aged patrons appears, standing out in black pea coats with white shell top sneakers and the like.  Table service is typical of any French bistro; we sampled a mid-ranged Syrah blend that suited us.  There was a crab cake that was much different than any variant found around the Chesapeake, a patty consisting of pulverized crabmeat and bits of vegetables, decent but incomparable and thus forgetful.  The escargot and tube pasta ragoût, that came lukewarm, had a mild combination of snail and portabella flavor.  A dish that still feels light even with a butter-basil sauce.I noticed that there is a porch outside, for those reading during warmer months.  Hanger steak is noticeably tougher than the more darling cuts from the loin; however, the temperature was spot on for what was asked.  Flanked by perfect fries and topped with garlic butter, the steak was properly lubed, nearly as supple as those fancy cuts.  A leg of duck, with skin so crispy, was tender and robust.For dessert, a simple crème brûlée was shared; cracking through the sugar crust like applauds for the simple yet well cooked entrees.  You won't lose any brownie points here, that's for sure."

Recently I had brunch here with my husband, toddler and baby and it was just lovely. I had the organic meats plate with poached egg, my husband had the potato leek tartlet with egg and side of sausage and my toddler had the fruit, donut and cheese plate. Absolute quality in all the produce used which is what really sets it apart for me from other brunch places, beautiful presentation and delicious execution. Service was great, they gave my toddler crayons and got a bigger chair for my babies car seat to sit snugly on. I expected some snottiness since this place is pretty posh and we came in hauling a car seat, a big ol tote full of baby-kid gear and two kids but was so pleasantly surprised!  This was my first brunch experience here. The previous times, I came here for dinner- same rave reviews. I highly recommend the salmon pot au feu, the cornish hen and their mushroom ravioli. The only reason I'm rating this place a 4 and not a 5 is because I wasn't as impressed with their hangar steak. It wasn't bad, I just wasn't wowed."

I also tried the panko crusted goat cheese which was delicious and the beef tartare which was one of the best I've had in the city.The main I ordered was the hanger steak as I haven't had a good steak in a while. The butter that is served on top of the steak adds so much depth and highlights a perfectly cooked medium. I had a slice of the herb crusted calf liver and it was so delicious that it would definitely be what I order the next time I visit.For dessert I couldn't look past the french toast especially as I'm an addict for anything caramel.

Good job, good effort Leméac waiter!  Way to earn that .39 tip I gave you!  Really appreciated you thinking there was nothing wrong with that maneuver.

In a city as eclectic as Montreal where French roots are evident and serve a predominant role in the culinary landscape, it's hard to avoid getting muddled and folded into the rest of the group, however, this is exactly how the better joints will stand out. When you have many places doing the same thing, it's the chef's responsibility to ensure that his or her cuisine and menu choices stand out - only on an even playing field where everyone is doing the same thing, will you find who is truly doing it better.

This made the list of the top ten French restaurants in Montreal, and was sort of a compromise as we could not get into our restaurant of choice. Based on our experience, it should be higher on the list.First, note that the menu is marginally French, and I would describe most of the entree choices as continental, rather than exclusively French. That said, the duck breast (not the duck leg served traditionally crispy which you can basically get on the sidewalk in Montreal) was outstanding. Recommended served rare by our waiter, it was perfectly done with just a thin layer of fat and skin on the surface for flavor and texture. While I debated about ordering something as mundane as Cornish game hen, the waiter urged me to get it and I was not disappointed. One of the best preparations (grilled) I have had and presented with garnishes that enhanced the flavor.Our waiter was extremely helpful and not afraid to offer opinions, which I prefer. His choice of wine was spot on, and there was little wait for drinks or food. The dessert menu here is quite extensive. However, after we told the waiter that we were really looking for chocolate soufflé (which they do not have), he suggested a store a block down, Juliet and Chocolate. I would also highly recommend it as a perfect end to the evening for all you chocolate lovers."

If Lemeac were in another town, like in the prairies or midwest USA, it would be 4 or 5 stars.The food was good. It wasn't bad. I didn't have complaints. The atmosphere was fine, although I found it to be slightly boring.It didn't impress me much, but if you feel like going somewhere with a solid selection of food that is decent, go here."
/user_details?userid=0tf14Cq5NU3PBINpEDXZdQ,Sara R.,"Dallas, TX",4 star rating,"Three words:  22 at 22.Well now it's 25 at 22, but the point is, you get a great deal after 22h/10pm.  One appetizer, an entree, and a coffee or tea to round it out.  The selections are plenty, and they also allowed me to select one of their daily specials.  So, I ordered the short rib appetizer, duck confit entree, and a chamomile tea.The short rib appetizer.  Hm.  At first I thought they had mistakenly brought me the entree portion.  A thick, rectangular piece of short ribs that are falling off in tenderness (they are not on the bone when presented to you), and surrounded by a melange of cubed watermelon and cilantro.  Interesting combination, but does it work well?  Heck yes!  I loved getting a piece of beef, watermelon, and cilantro all on my fork and in one bite.  Tasty with bursts of slightly sweet and juicy, to green and lively, and the richness of the meat settling in.  Frankly, I was quite full at this point.  But here came the duck confit, with a side of roasted fingerling potatoes and a giant spinach/green salad topped with a soft vinaigrette.  The duck confit was my first taste ever, and it was good.  I wouldn't say I loved it, but I'm just not used to that flavor.  It's also quite rich, but also has a distinct poultry scent and flavor.  Sort of like a stronger Thanksgiving turkey.  But the skin was so crisp and yummy, and the meat was moist, and its own fat had melted into it, creating quite a nice texture and depth of flavor.  The chamomile tea at the end was just the right ending.The service is A+!  My waitress was so sweet, and so helpful, and accommodated my silly questions and that I didn't speak any French.  I don't know why I've heard stories about the Quebecois not caring for Americans, because I never got that impression on this trip.  Great town, great people!  The restaurant itself is sort of a ""crisp"" bistro.  It's not too cozy, but it does have a slight romantic/fine dining touch to it.  There's a nice bar along one side, and then tables within.  I don't recall any booths.  Nice, large windows with a pleasant view of Avenue Laurier Ouest... and the shops that line it.  Nothing is really open around there that late, but it's still quite safe as I walked around a bit afterward.I'd love to come here for brunch someday, when I'm back in Montreal.  Oh, I saw someone order the French toast dessert, and holy moly.  It's like two thick (4""?) slices of brioche French toast, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream (or was it creme fraiche?)..   it looked incredible, but probably could feed a table of 4.  Or even 6.  Get here at 10pm (they close at midnight, I believe), and you're in for a treat with a decent pricetag.  I was here on a Sunday night at 10pm, and let me tell you, there was a good-sized crowd.  Pretty neat, because I don't ever see this in LA!  Only dreadful diners and fast food are open that late  around here. :-D"

/user_details?userid=W74GQTFKjLjQPtFc6m-N5g,Kathy R. D.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,If you are visiting Montreal this is a place to go. The food is really tasty. I have been a few times and the service was slow only once (I am guessing they were having an off day). They have a special price if you reserve after 10PM. Its $25 and if you are ok with eating late I would recommend going than. I have never had a bad meal at lemeac. The Frois Gras is delicious and my personal favorite. The truffle oil salmon tartare is very fresh tasting and the stake is always cooked to perfection. The desserts are the best part. Try the french toast and milk jam ice cream with maple caramel.
/user_details?userid=ORTpbuUmG44UU7oG4QBciA,Citizen J.,"Jersey City, NJ",5 star rating,"This is one of my favorite restaurants anywhere.  I've probably been there 4-5 times now and try and get there for 1 night whenever I'm in Montreal (2x this year).  The latest visit was a few weeks ago with a buddy of mine.The boudin maison is a star.  It's not like sausage that you'd have with, say, boudin aux pommes....it's more like a mousse it's so light in texture.  Not too big a serving or too heavy either.Trying to remember what I had this last time.  My buddy had the magret de canard which he enjoyed.  I believe I had the confit.  Their salmon tartare is also a standout appetizer.We started out with a red Bandol, which was pretty good.  But then took a gamble on a high-end Vins de Pays from the Languedoc.  We had the 2005 Flacon de Marie from Domaine Pech Redon.  It's always interesting to sample a wine that's made outside of the AOC straightjacket system.  This wine was excellent and I need to find a source in NYC area.  It's mostly Syrah (50%) with some Cab (40%) and a third cepage I've never heard of.  I'm partial to Syrahs and mostly drink northern Rhone but there's good value in the Languedoc.  Christophe Bousquet produced a winner and thanks to Lemeac for putting this on the carte de vin.  It would match well with most of their dishes.If you are dining alone or with just one other person the bar/counter is also a great spot."
/user_details?userid=leS3NDw6qct3KUZL5Cr95Q,Alexandra S.,"Watertown, MA",4 star rating,"After eating at several great places in Montreal (including my gold standard of Europea), I was a little disappointed in Lemeac.  After a few Montreal residents told me that it's one of the best- if not the best- in Montreal, I was expecting a lot.  Unfortunately, the menu is basic and really has no frills and there are no amuse bouche to make you feel special.  Admittedly, we didn't take full advantage of the Sommelier's expertise which is apparently another reason to go here.  The food was wonderful, but it didn't leave me with that ""I just had a unique, fabulous meal"" feeling.  The pommes frites are, however, the best you'll ever have.  The service is outstanding.  All in all, this place is quality but not a special experience."

It was our first night in Montreal and the reviews were so positive and the menu looked so delicious. In a nutshell, it was an ok brasserie meal for two that cost us $170! We each had one entree, shared a bottle of wine and shared a dessert. I ordered the steak frites and the steak was very good: cooked perfectly and smothered in butter. The fries were no better than Mc Donalds fries. My husband had short ribs which were very good but nothing spectacular. WeShared the assorted ice cream and sorbet plate which consisted of one amazing ice cream (basil) and 3 mediocre sorbets (strawberry, mango and pineapple). The service was wonderful and our server extremely helpful but this is by no means one of the best restaurants in Montreal and certainly not worth the high end price tag."

/user_details?userid=pTvR_xN-sWY5-jakTKw1ag,Lisa Q.,"West Chester, PA",3 star rating,"After 10 pm, as others have alluded to here, there is a Late Night Menu, which my boyfriend and I sampled from last Friday night. The food (vegetable tian & escargot apps, cornish hen & steak tartare entrees) was good enough, although the escargots were a little overcooked...but the problem was that everything was rather uninspired in my opinion. Certainly I would never go to pay full price for these items. However, the most disappointing aspect of our dinner was the service. Our waitress (who was nice, it must be said) did not bring me the glass of wine I asked for, which I let go as I probably didn't need it anyway...but when we got the check (finally! it took a very long time to get it) we were charged for a whole bottle! When we noted it though, she was extremely apologetic and we did get our coffees comp'd. Still, the night was underwhelming flavor-wise and irritating service-wise. I suppose the ambiance was nice. If you want to try Lemeac, please be prudent and only go after 10 pm. There are tons of better restos in Montreal for you to spend beaucoup bucks on."
/user_details?userid=ADYrDX_GK_pVMOoAXXHP4w,Brian Y.,"Singapore, Singapore",3 star rating,Traditional bistro food done well.  A bit pricey for what you get though.  Had the beef tartar entree which was a bit too much for one person.  Recommend the appetizer portion.

/user_details?userid=F60ITKwADqxKYaJMXPLkkQ,Ed H.,"LAFAYETTE HL, PA",2 star rating,"We were disappointed here. The food was excellent, but service disappointing for these prices.  Excellent gazpacho, scallops and profiteroles. But we waited almost an hour between appetizers and main course, during which time our server, who had otherwise been friendly, helpful and attentive, ignored us, probably embarrassed by what was a snafu somewhere.  When we first mentioned to the manager that many others who arrived after us were served long ago, he gave a nonsensical response about kitchen teams.  When one of our party complained after the meal, the manager somewhat grudgingly comped our dessert selections.  I know everyone makes mistakes, but a sincere apology would have gone a long way to make these diners feel like their patronage was appreciated.  We all thought the food was outstanding, but the way we were treated marred what could have been a wonderful dining experience."
/user_details?userid=sFJjEc7ytSUV28Y7PpdMjQ,Mathieu B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Version Française à la fin:Second time was successful. I was a bit worry about it because my friend was disapointed of his second time there. Usually second time feels confortable and not as suprising. I think that's the only reason I didn't put a 5 stars on that one. I went with my friend and orderd a 2 courses only. I knew my friend was really hungry and I was just a little. My first time there I had some Rillette Maison which was fabulous but  not a real apetizers. It was more a communal size side-course. The only thing that gave you it was a 1 person apetizer was the 3 small wheat biscotte. So my friend also took the Onglet with homemade fries. Onglet is part of the bib, it's slightly - even - more tasteful than bib. He was really happy with that and told me it was great! I had some Boudin maison with a small reduction of apple cider vinegar with as a main course ris de veau and loin steak with celeriac purée and seared wild mushrooms . The Celeriac purée was one of the best I had tasted in my life. Not that I tend to go for it but It's nice when it well done. The cooking was great and the size as well. The taste and seasoning were great but the textures for my main course was lacking a crunchy texture. I don't know if mixing Ris de veau and Loin Steak was the best idea in the world but it was certainly interesting. Maybe if the Ris de veau was presented in a donut or a baluchon. It's French Bistro so if you don't know what a French bistro is, well it's french cuisine classic. Little downside for me, there's definetly a Bourgeois feeling to the place, like at Moishe. C'était ma deuxième fois au Leméac. Les premières fois sont toujours les plus surprenantes et les secondes fois ont un côté confortable qui se distingue principalement par un goût de revenez-y.  Je crois que j'ai p-e diminué mon score sur Leméac mais c'était encore très bon. Mon ami a prit ce que j'avais pris la première fois que je n'y étais rendu. Il avait pas mal faim et moi pas trop. Il a prit l'Onglet de boeuf avec pomme-frite maison (qui sont vraiment bonne! (mince julienne, blanchies avant!) Moi j'ai pris le Boudin maison avec une purée de pomme de terre, garniture de pommes servit avec une réduction de vinaigre de cidre. Avec comme met principale le ris de veau avec un contre-filet de bœuf avec champignons poêlés et purée de céleri-rave. Hmm une des meilleures purées de Céleri-rave que j'ai mangé a vie.  Le Céleri-rave est trop peu connu et pas assez utilisé dans la cuisine québécoise! C'est délicieux quand c'est bien apprêté et ça se prête bien à des réductions . Petit bémol sur la texture qui était vraiment un hommage au «mou» . Pas de croquant dans mon assiette et je crois que c'est ce qui manquait au plat pour le rendre bon. Y se donne le nom de restaurant et oui, c'est une coche ou deux au dessus d'un bistro mais c'est au bout du compte, de son décor jusqu'aux plats présenté un bistro qui nous présente des classiques de la cuisine française avec une petite touche plus poussé.  On y retrouve définitivement un petit feeling bourgeois qui me rappelle un peu le Moishe pas nécessairement mon choix de «foule» .Je suis un peu déçu qu'on ne trouve pas une Table d'hôte avant le fameux 24$ - ridicule de le garder a 22$ quand a 24$ c'est toujours le meilleur deal en ville - après 22h! Quelle bonne façon de poussée une prep qui pourrait être moins fraiche en fin de journée . Belle façon de terminé la soirée aussi.  Fin positive: de l'onglet sur le menu! Quelle belle façon de faire découvrir une partie génialissime du boeuf!"

From the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed by the staff. Our servers were friendly and accommodating to us with our extremely limited French. Menus were delivered in English and French, and we did not at all feel out of place by using English. The food. Oh my goodness, amazing! We sampled and shared from both the Appatizer selection & Entree's : Grilled calamari and zucchini, lemon and balsamic vinaigrette flavorful and fresh, Escargots, portabella mushroom and tomato ragout, basil butter sauce, my first time with escargots and I was pleasantly surprised; and  Panko crusted goat cheese, apple and walnut salad, maybe the best of three starters. What we noticed was that the items were all very good independently, however, the chef is tremendously skilled, and the food danced with the items it was paired with. The Beef tartare & matchstick potatoe, may be the best tartare I've ever eaten Dinner consisted of: Shrimp salad, grilled sesame oil vinaigrette, Mushroom ravioli, demi-glace, pine nuts and aragula, Roasted duck breast, ravioli, shiitakes, bok choy and sweet and sour sauce and Asparagus and wild mushroom risotto. Each dish burst with flavor and excitement. The only thing we noticed, was that the risotto, while an entree, would have been an excellent side. We shared all of our meals and it was perfect. The risotto on it's own might be too much, or not quite enough! Over all, SUPURB and highly recommended :-)."

I had to scream to be able to talk to the person right in front of me, because of all the people talking so loud and not the music, because there isn't any at all. But hey, it's a French bistro so that's what it's about i guess.. but this was too loud for my liking. Not a sexy vibe, not romantic. But more if you're looking for a typical French upscale casual business vibe. Food was god but not memorable."

I've tried every item on the menu (it doesn't change much) and will have the salmon tartar as appetizer and the beef tartar as my main course during half my visits. The wine list is extensive and has many private imports. As you may have read in other reviews, the $22 menu after 10PM is probably one of the best deals in town for a restaurant like Lemeac. A reservation is strongly recommended, as the place is most often full."

Not too much fluff, and had a lot of crab meat in it.  For our dinner we had the braised short ribs served over pearl barley.  Unfortunately, the short ribs were slightly overcooked.  We also had the beef tartare with fries, the beef was amazing.  We could not get enough!  Even though the pain perdu for dessert came highly recommended, we had to pass since we were so stuffed!"
