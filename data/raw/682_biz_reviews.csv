It's no surprise that their specialty is Hawaiian poke bowls. I have had my share of amazing poke bowls over the last few years and can say that what they offer is pretty solid. I went for the Classico ( one can never go wrong with classic) and it was full a variety of flavours and textures that meshed perfectly. I would give a 5 * had the portion been more generous as 1/3 of my bowl was empty. Did they really need to skimp on the ingredients? Otherwise will order again from them as they are not far from me :-)
