The DIY decorations and hand written wall menus will truly make you feel like you woke up in a Bangkok back-alley joint and you already know this is how ur suppose to enjoy South East Asian food. The banh-mi was nice and soft but the biggest surprise was the pad Thai. Noodles have a very smoky flavour, they serve it with both chicken & shrimp and they use fresh lemongrass which brings this simple dish to a whole new level ! The  Asian lady at the cash is simply amazing,juggling both the cash, kitchen and service, she will hustle you to get the 1$ imperial roll; totally go for it"
