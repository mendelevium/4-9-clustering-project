/user_details?userid=_C8d5idf7yFq9DDRS9LZ2A,Coco C.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,Love this place....This is a hidden gem a few streets down from the hustle bustle of downtown Montreal.So we spent the entire day trying to find parking downtown.Omg never again! Next time no coming to downtown my mom said:(This place had authentic Persian/ Irani food that I have been craving for a while now:)The sugar pouches are so cute.We got soup with our dinner. Reminded me of Mercimak soup with butter and mint.The fact that I could check my car right outside gave me some peace of mind.They're open untill 11 PM which was amazing as we are night owls.
/user_details?userid=aJPO0e5KeWdxoFuBZhzJjw,Debbie G.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Small Persian restaurant near Atwater market. Staff is very friendly and quick to serve meals. I was there on a quieter night pre-COVID but it got busier as the night went on. When you walk in, you are greeted with pita, onions, butter and green herbs. For appetizers: I had the delicious asheh reshteh which is a classic Persian soup with all kinds of herbs and beans. One of my favourites :-) I also had the mirze ghasemi which is an eggplant spread made with eggs & tomato sauce. Both of these appetizers are great for vegetarians & meat lovers. For the main dish, my ULTIMATE  favorite of all Persian stews, ghormeh sabzi. This is a stew that takes hours to prepare with many herbs, kidney beans and meat. Not the prettiest dish, I will admit, but do not judge by it's looks! This is the ultimate favourite of all Persians & there's a reason for it ;-)Overall, a good experience. They get bonus points for not rushing to get rid of us when we finished our meal, which I appreciate. If you're looking for Persian restaurant in that area, check them out. If you've never had Persian food in your life, you're missing out ;-)"
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I love good cheap eats and MdK is one of them!  But please bring cash! I was recommended by my Iranian colleague to try as this was his family's go to place. Decor is very humble with two TVs playing music videos.  It's a small place.IMO there are 2 failsafe dishes to order--the Kubideh and the Crazy Chicken (choice of legs or breast).  Each dish comes with a choice of soup or salad.  Note, the soup is made with lentils so it's verrry filling.  I prefer the salad though they're maybe too generous on the salad dressing!  The soup for me, is an acquired taste, so I don't particularly enjoy it. You're also served toasted pita with raw onions, parsley and butter.  I'm having difficulty eating the raw onion, parsley pita sandwiches but it's there if you like it!When your side of rice enough to feed three people arrives, first things first is slather some butter on it, then sprinkle lots of sumac, then cut up the roasted tomato in little bits and drizzle a bit of lemon juice.  According to my Iranian friend, that, is the way to eat the rice :)Drizzle the remaining lemon juice on the rest of the meat.  I love kubideh cause it's so juicy and got such a nice meaty flavor.  I also really enjoy the Crazy Chicken, very generous 5 portions of chicken thigh and with a delicious grilled flavor."
/user_details?userid=9DsdXJcwrrRBFw1pl0yosQ,John F.,"Arvada, CO",3 star rating,"This is a Cash Only (in local currency) establishment. In the days of Apple Pay, perhaps one of the only ones in North America. The atmosphere is nice and the food is pretty darn good! The chef knows what he's is doing. I would recommend any of the kebabs. We tried the bone-in chicken (joojeh), the filet-mignon (barg), and the ground-beef (koobideh) skewers with rice, garlic yogurt, and saffron tea to top it off. The prices are reasonable and the small place can get packed pretty easily. It would get more stars from me if the service was better and more payment options were available."
/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Having toured over Iran some years ago, I have always been on the lookout for authentic Persian cuisine. I was recommended Maison Kebab by a friend and after reading the reviews on Yelp, I can honestly say that this place truly is the real deal! We entered the restaurant to the sounds of traditional melancholic Persian music filling the rather small space; from its simple interior and modest décor, to the eye catching plates of customers and the delightful aromas filling the air, I knew that I had finally found a gem. As there are only about 10 tables, we were fortunate to not having to wait too long. The lovely lady serving us was super friendly and brought us over some Iranian naan with butter and herbs to munch on whilst we browsed the menu. I had the Ash Reshte soup for starters which was warm and comforting, perfect for the winter, filled with herbs and good stuff! I have to second Bobby's review below, if you are an eggplant lover then the Mirza Ghasemi is an absolute MUST! It truly was addictive, so much so that we had two helpings! Of course, my carnivore husband had to order the huge mixed meat platter - and boy, am I glad that he did! The meats were grilled to perfection, super succulent and if you want to enhance the flavours further, sprinkle some sumac all over for an extra tangy kick (you will thank me later). My favourite was the Kabab Barg, tender pieces of melt-in-the-mouth filet mignon. The crazy chicken and Koobideh were also equally delicious! All this alongside lavishly presented, jeweled basmati rice that has been tossed in butter and saffron and crowned with Zereshk (sour barberries) which together truly was a match made in heaven! The portion sizes are very generous and having had so much for starters, we were unable to finish. Prices are reasonable and the service is exceptional - the woman in charge frequently came to check if the food was OK and offered us some strong Iranian tea at the end of our meal which was a real treat. Highly recommend Maison Kebab, it is definitely worth the trip from the South Shore! Just remember to bring cash."

The meat was wonderfully cooked and seasoned and the portions were huge. My only downvotes would be on the cleanliness of the tablecloths, which turned me off a little bit, and the fact that it is CASH ONLY and there wasn't clear signage stating this before I went in."
/user_details?userid=PQPyDFgKP_h51iBIXSdVvw,Baida A.,"Arvada, CO",3 star rating,"The food was great! We had the combination plate which had one skewer of barg, koobideh, and crazy chicken.  We also had the mast o museer, everything was delicious! The service was lacking, however. The server was distracted after a while when her friend came to visit her. This is also also a cash only establishment and does not take any foreign money."
/user_details?userid=iqQBsjqOF9xgIAbsZ2sAZA,David M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My my my, truly one of the best in Montreal for an amazing kebab.The prices have gone up but the koobideh is always a bargain for $11.50 for 2 skewers.Always order the Ash soup, you will not regret it ( although you only get half the quantity when it's Here's how I do it each and every time, grab some raw onions and parsley, wrap in in the buttered and toasted pita and open up the appetite.They do pile on the rice but it is truly wonderful with the saffron and lindenberries and you can load it up with butter and sumac.The broiled and charred tomato also oozes juices into the rice.The meat selection is small but they do it so well. The appetizers are also great, eggplant and the yoghurt dip, at that point it's better to get the hunter's platter.I do have to mention how cold it gets near the Windows in the winter so best to eat away. The place is also pretty small so they can't really handle large groups"

Never been disappointed and will keep eating their food :)If you are hungry and love or want to discover Persian food. It is one of the best place to go in Montréal without breaking the bank.Enjoy!

It is a little place but full of treasure. The service is great and so fast. I was skeptical to try the pita, onion piece and better that is served while you wait for your meal but once I did I was surprise how good it was.Since then I have been there so many time and the food...especially the meat is unbelievably amazing and so addictive. So please don't let the outside decor fool you because if you don't go you will miss out on the best persian food I ever had but bring cash or a credit card because they don't take debit"

/user_details?userid=zX0v7edWnSAo-8hEly-_1w,Niem X.,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"To be honest, I was pretty disappointed. I got one of the beef dishes. The beef was good. Not spectacular, not terrible. It was just good. Great texture, average flavor. The rice was ok too, but the sheer volume of it was completely unnecessary. The main dishes all come with soup or salad, and deciding to go the light route, I took the green salad. It was just some iceberg lettuce, a tiny bit of purple cabbage, and this tangy dressing that I wasn't too fond of. And then I got this basket of crispy, half burnt pita. That was a bummer. I came here because I saw the good reviews, I live close by, and I just wasn't feeling like cooking dinner. But honestly, I left wishing I had saved my $15 and just made a PB&J or something. I guess if you really want persian food, it's there, it's not terrible, but I wouldn't make a point to go back. On the plus side, service is fairly fast (though, a little cold)."
/user_details?userid=wtgLrMEWR8S1s9tFVSdeYw,Clifford P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Been meaning to try this place since I moved into the neighbourhood but kept putting it off. Finally took the plunge and it was absolutely incredible. If you're a couple or on a date, get the Hunter's Platter and you won't regret it. Think of it as an intro to Iranian Food. The variety of dishes that are included are a true education in flavour. And best of all, this doesn't break the bank! Prices are reasonable, but do bring actual cash."
/user_details?userid=32IL3VJSJbPLc8N4glznuA,Moe B.,"Northampton, MA",4 star rating,About as good a $12 meal as you can have. Start off with delicious soup and then receive plate of FIVE chicken thighs with herbed rice and those little red Persian berries sprinkles in top plus the obligatory grilled tomato. Mmmm so good. Quiet family atmosphere and friendly service.
/user_details?userid=YTdNcIWAt2nEzZ7NY-fniw,Jeff K.,"Orlando, FL",5 star rating,"When I travel, I feel compelled to eat at as many different restaurants as I can.  I figure if you're only going to be there temporarily you should try as many different things as you possibly can!  On my recent 3-week business trip to Montréal, there were only two restaurants that I visited more than once.  One of them was La Maison De Kebab.Of course, as others have previously said in one way or another, the meat here is delicious.  Well seasoned and cooked beautifully, the large slab of fillet was plated alongside white and yellow rice and a side salad with a creamy, flavorful dressing.  A random grilled tomato comes along for the ride, although I don't care for tomatoes so that stayed put.  The meal was massive, but fantastic. Photo: yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m…Now as much as I love that meal, I know that I've also experienced other excellent meals in the city.  So why was La Maison De Kebab worthy of that second visit?Oddly enough, lentil soup.Before the meal came out on my first visit, I was given a bowl of lentil soup.  I didn't know it was lentil soup at the time, even getting it was a surprise because it wasn't mentioned on the menu as a part of the meal.  There's something special about it though, warming with a great thickness and texture. This tasty soup was topped with a drizzle of yogurt, and in the middle was what seemed to be some sort of mixture of blackened mint and maybe olive oil.  I'm not sure, but it was fragrant and delicious, and it really elevated the soup to something spectacular.  Photo: yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m…I went back to the loft and didn't stop thinking about that soup for the rest of my visit.  I posted about it on Facebook, attempting to enlist the help of others in determining what type of soup it was so I could try to find it locally when I got home.  I HAD to go back for a second visit, if only to find out what that soup was!Much to my dismay, it was ""just"" lentil soup -- there was no special name that I could refer to in a restaurant back home where they'd reply, ""Oh yes!  We have that exact soup that you are craving!""  It's the best lentil soup I've ever had, but so much more than lentil soup, and in all likelihood I'll never see another like it until the next time I visit this beautiful city."

/user_details?userid=FTsYsxk0-vsSk4uil1VD5g,Feifei L.,"Chicago, IL",3 star rating,"Tried this place with my dad a while back. The portions were generous but their chicken kababs aren't charbroiled entirely. It's more like semi cooked chicken finished off on charcoal, so that charcoal flavour doesn't penetrate in. Not impressed as there are much better options for chicken around town."

I am from Beverly Hills and by far their soltani was mouth water fresh and very tasty. I ate the whole plate. The food is top notch amazing here!!!! I highly recommend. The staff is very warm and nice too. Thank you so much. I can't wait to return and bring back my family to try this hidden gem!!!  I can say that their food is one of the best i have had in the USA and Canada!!! Very very very yummy!!!
/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,Bobby A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Make sure you do not say ""I'm craving meat"" out loud in the presence of unknown men. Be specific and say ""I am craving Maison de Kebab"" because this is hands down, the best, THE BEST, kebab joint in Montreal!Don't be fooled by the humble exterior of this little Persian resto that could. With it's 8 or 9 tables, usually filled with Iranian patrons, and Iranian satellite TV on,  plain tables and chairs, Spartan surroundings, these people make meat addictive!First off, the one dish you absolutely have to start with is the Mirza Ghasemi, a puréed eggplant dish that must have crack cocaine in it, you cannot stop eating it, it's *that* good. In fact when you've scooped up the last shred of it, you'll start to wonder if you should order another helping. By all means do.Then there is the rice, a long, delicate, fragrant variety reminiscent of Indian basmati , but it isn't basmati rice, infused with saffron, a clodd of rice with melted butter and topped with a generous helping of dried, tart red barberries ( Zereshk Berries), giving each mouthful a jolt of sweet, tart yumminess. For a $4 charge, you can ask for extra berries and they will give it to you.Then there is the meat.Dear Reader, you have truly not lived until you have the grilled meat done like the way they do it here. Moist, savoury and done just right, you will develop an addiction. You will crave it  like no other. The days where you suddenly develop a craving, you will wonder if you can jam in a quick visit to La Maison de Kebab. This is one of the things I love about Montreal, that small, hidden, dives, with no fanfare, no marketing, no following, still serves better food than some of these more pricier, popular joints where you are paying more for the attitude than the food itself. Who needs that? Go to La Maison de Kebab instead."

/user_details?userid=I-PsFvYzyM6Mgc-IOe6WsA,Sameer D.,"Markham, Canada",1 star rating,"My wife and I came here upon recommendation from a friend, so I didn't bother checking Yelp reviews. I should have because this is a cash only place, which I was not expecting. Ok so before I write the rest of this I will say that the food is good if you enjoy Iranian food. Also the waitress was fairly nice. That's all the good points I have in this review.The bathroom was pretty filthy and if you're of the female gender, all I can say is good luck. You might have to hold it till you get home (or back to the hotel in our case).My big beef with this place is (no pun intended) that nowhere do they display a sign (believe me, I checked) or even mention to patrons that this is a cash only place. IMHO if you're going to operate a cash only restaurant then you MUST inform people. So we ordered, and ate and got the rest of our meal packed up.Then when it came time to pay, I was told to pay up at the front so I made my way over. I asked if debit is okay and I find out they do not accept debit or credit and ""cash only"" is the norm. The total came to about $38 bucks.So I had $40 in my pocket which actually was Extremely lucky, with a capital E, as I am one of those people that never carries more than a few bucks cash around. I paid the manager and yes I felt bad about not leaving more than change as a tip, but honestly what am I gonna do.. Walk for God knows how long and find a bank so I can leave a tip? Some of you may argue with this but sorry I wasn't about to do that.Then I get back to my table and sit down. I take a last sip of my drink and get up to put my jacket on. I turn around and the manager is a foot away from me telling me that the ""service charge"" aka tip, is not included in the price (well, no kidding!). She proceeds to tell me in her most snarky voice, that she pays tax on my meal (note: I witnessed her not ring anything in the register and she gave me a verbal total), and it's customary to leave something.I was thinking ""seriously lady I can't believe you just said that"" but I said, in my nicest and calmest indoor voice ""Honestly I always leave a tip but I was intending to pay with my card and didn't know you only accept cash. Luckily I had $40 and I would've left more of a tip but that's all I had on me.""I then put on my jacket and left. One minute prior she would have got a raving review but that kind of rudeness is unacceptable. I would have come back to this place every time I came to Montreal but now I will not even recommend it as an option.Though the food is good, find another place that treats their customers with some respect."

We settled on the 2 people dinner platter which came with 3 types of meat, 3 appetizers and soup and salad. Everything was exceptionally well done and tasty. We thought the price is fair for all the food we got 33$ for the dinner for two. The rest of the menu was between 10-20$ which isn't bad for a great tasting Persian restaurant. Ps.

/user_details?userid=oSkz7bxTAoFJxgDGP5wJHg,John H.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Some of the best value for your money I've found in Montreal at a sit-down restaurant, with great food and warm service. Persian restos in Montreal tend to come in two varieties: kebab houses like this place and fuller-service restaurants with a variety of stews in addition to kebabs (e.g. Quartier Perse). MK does a great job of the three kebab standards: koobideh (buttery, melt-in-your-mouth minced meat), joojeh (chicken) and barg (filet mignon). They have the usual range of appetizers, and all were great; we had mast-o-musir and mast-o-khiar (garlic and mint yogurt-based dips) as well as a particularly smoky, toothsome mirza ghassemi (eggplant and tomato dip). The Hunter's Platter for two gives you all three kebab varieties, three appetizers from their list, lots of pita bread, a plate of onion, radishes and parsley, a big dish of saffron-tinged rice with plentiful, tangy barberries on the side, AND a choice of soup (Persian-style noodle with beans) or salad, all for under $40. We left stuffed, satisfied and vowing to return more often. I've eaten here just three times in ten years (Atwater & Saint-Antoine is far from my Mile End comfort zone), but each meal has been consistently great. Cash only, which is par for the course for independent Montreal restos in this price range."

/user_details?userid=4ZSXBbCzYFS_lvC1hvJDXQ,Diana D.,"San Antonio, TX",1 star rating,"We visited this restaurant on our last night in Montreal, based on the previous reviews.  To be honest, it was a huge letdown.  The place is kind of a dive, but that doesn't always correlate with the food.  However, it never bodes well when a guy comes through the tiny, cramped restaurant with a bucket of dirty water and spills it all over the place.  The waitress got our order wrong the first time, and when we corrected her, she argued with us (just fix it, woman!).  When she got it totally wrong the second time (it's not that hard, they have a simple, limited menu), we just ate what they brought us because by then, we were starving.  The salads had bits of brown lettuce, and the pita bread was slightly burned.  The chicken was dry and the rice was tasteless.  We truly could not see what warranted such rave reviews from previous diners.  Maybe they had an ""off night"", but with EVERYTHING that went wrong, we doubt it.  To sum it up, don't go out of your way for this place -- you'll probably be disappointed."
