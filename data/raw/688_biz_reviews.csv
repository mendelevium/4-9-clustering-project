/user_details?userid=5QrlMMzUq_RoUlEyH2zcig,Judy K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Service is always exceptionally friendly and warm; food is delicious. Might possibly be one of the best turkey schnitzel in town. The perogies have a made by nonna feel. They've got a large selection of fillings with daily specials. They offer soups and desserts. I've yet to try something on the menu that wasn't good. It's very reasonably priced as well.The decor is very cute and clean. It kind of gives me the feeling of your nonnas kitchen but modernize. They offer take out or eat in and out conveniently  placed right in front of the Lionel Groulx metro.Worth the stop in!

The decor is so, so cute, and the menu is quite interesting! A friend and I ordered a brunch platter (which involved latkes, kielbasa, pierogis, and a fried egg) to split, and everything was delicious. The portion size was generous, and it was quite affordable as well!"

Been dying to check this place out since they opened a few weeks ago and I started following them on Instagram. They did not disappoint! We ordered the braised beef pierogies, Turkey schnitzel sandwich and latkes with apple sauce and sour cream. WOW! Hands down the best Polish food I have ever had! The pierogies were plump, soft, with the perfect sear, topped with thick sour cream, sauerkraut and fresh chives. The turkey schnitzel was piping hot, juicy, with a gorgeous crispy coating and served on a fresh challah. BE STILL MY HEART! We finished with the latkes which were expertly cooked...soft and delicious on the inside with the perfect exterior crunch. I'm always impressed when a restaurant just gets it and this place did exactly that! 5 stars all around from service to pricing to atmosphere to quality of food. I'll definitely be a returning customer whenever my boots land in Montreal. BRAVO!"

They have a variety of lunch options (salad, sandwiches etc ) as well as coffee and baked goods.  I have tried their various lunch sandwiches (Turkey, chicken, veggie) and they are always fresh and made with care. Their salads are very good as well, I have tried their potato salad which is nice and creamy and well seasoned, their cucumber salad which is refreshing and tasty and their beet salad which is equally good. Their coffee is also very well prepared and you can taste the quality of the beans , their doughnuts are polish style and always fresh and delicious. They are about quality not quantity and are very customer service oriented which is always a plus as you always feel welcome when you are there. They also offer catering options. Definitely a place I will continue going back to,"

My only complaint is that the open hours have reduced significantly since it opened, and it's closed so early during the week that I can't even grab dinner there anymore."
