/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"Excellent food. Excellent service. Excellent plating. Excellent ambiance. What more could we want? L'Auberge Saint-Gabriel is a fancy restaurant in the heart of Old Montreal where people tend to dress up and enjoy some delicious food with wine pairings $$$.We dined here in a fully-booked dining room for my first #MtlaTable experience of 2017. The menu sounded drool-worthy and at $41 a person, I had high expectations. Let's just say none of us left hungry and we were all impressed!They had cauliflower slow-roasting in front of us. That was a beautiful sight - and the cover photo for this post! It also kept the dining room warm, especially since we were seated at the closest table to the fire.To start, we enjoyed the complimentary olive bread and cheese sticks. The waitress was a little pushy when asking if we wanted to start with a bottle of wine or some of their specialities like mussels, oysters or foie gras. I'm sure it's part of her job and I have noticed that at other Mtl a Table restaurants, they tend to push alcohol as a way to make up for their special menu pricing so it's fine.For our appetizers, we ordered the salmon confit, as well as the slow-roasted cauliflower - which ended up being delicious! I don't like cauliflower but apparently slow-cooking it is the way to go. Though it was a little too filling for an appetizer. The salmon was better portion-wise.For our mains, we tried the Quebec wild mushroom risotto and the hanger steak. The portion of the risotto was very generous, more so than the steak but everything tasted amazing. Already pretty full, we were excited for dessert. The presentation was fantastic. The lemon millefeuille, the chocolate tarte, and the tarte tartin were amazing but were our favourites in that order. Very creative and delicious. What a great end to the meal!"

Fast forward to 2019 and I was planning a return trip to Montreal with my boyfriend. The first thing I did was make dinner reservations here.The building itself is beautiful and has such an amazing rich history. We were seated promptly when we arrived.I ordered a glass of orange wine and my boyfriend ordered a mojito. The mojito was well made! The orange wine was cold and crisp. Really different taste.I chose the spit roasted Cornish hen. It was good, but missing something I can't quite put my finger on. However, the meat was tender and juicy! My boyfriend got a piece of beef. Unfortunately, I can't remember what cut it was. He really enjoyed it!We ordered the hazelnut sponge cake for dessert. It was amazing. With the bill, we received some complimentary small jelly-like candies. It was a nice touch to end the meal. We will absolutely return the next time we are in Montreal!"
/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,Aimee H.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It's a warm summer Saturday in July and we got a table for supper but it looks like no reservations are needed because the resto was fairly quiet. There were only a few occupied tables inside and outside on the terrace.Since it was quiet, after ordering, we asked our waiter if we could tour the building. They gladly obliged and sent us one of the staff members to take us on a tour all the way up to the attic piano room and then down to the basement where there's the speakeasy. The building was built in 1688 and was at one point a hotel but today is a resto, bar and reception space. The decor and artwork is definitely eclectic! Foodwise, they serve cheese puffs/sticks as a free appetizers. These are good and I'll have these over Cheetos any day!! They're light and flakey, dusted with Parmesan. Appetizers. I was hesitant to try the roasted cauliflower but since we were having the bone marrow, our waiter recommended it be paired with the cauliflower.It didn't disappoint! It's roasted cauliflower with a vinaigrette of capers, lemon, parsley, anchovies, olive oil on a cauliflower puree (cannibalistic, I know). Humble yet satisfying. It's creamy due to the puree but not too heavy because of the vinaigrette and got that umami kick from the anchovies. It's a great spread for the bread!The bone marrow is nice to try. It's very fatty and flavorwise tastes like ramen soup base (cause that's how ramen broth is made--pork bone). The volume of marrow is about 1-2 tablespoons and goes well with the bread. The parsley salad with vinaigrette is perfect to balance the richness of the marrow. For the mains, we were recommended the sea bream over the steak as it was accompanied by a fresh house-grown salad of radishes, kale, dill weed, mint, shredded purple cabbage in a lemony, capered vinaigrette. The sea bream is a delicate white meat fish grilled whole with lemon and capers. My two complaints are that along the spine it was undercooked and they didn't descale the whole fish so parts of the grilled fish skin couldn't be eaten even though it was a very tasty. Also warning, this dish is fairly involved as you'll have a whole fish with bones on your plate. You'll have to filet it with your fork and knife as you go!! Overall decent dish for the adventurous. The rigate pasta was underwhelming as it was rather dry and lacked flavor, not sure the fava beans helped the cause. The portion was huge but it would've been better to have smaller quantity of pasta but have more trimmings of fried artichoke, pesto and mushrooms. It tastes predominately of dill. For dessert, as we were in a hurry to go to another event, we ordered the vanilla lemon mille-feuille and devoured it.  It's good but nothing overly spectacular, especially for the price. The staff was very nice. Our waiter took the time to describe the dishes, which I appreciate. Our meal flavor theme was centered around lemon/capers which made for a light tasting meal."

Your weekends are jam-packed, your 5@7 are all booked, there are overlapped festivals everywhere you can hardly chose where to go! Terraces in Montreal are one of those things where you want to take advantage of and there are many great ones. This place is one of the older ones in my mind. I have been here for weddings, for drinks, for dancing and this time was my first time on the terrace for sit-down dinner.It's very cute! You kinda feel like you are in the yard of your rich distant cousin's place for his daughter's 4 year old's birthday party. The staff is very curteous and nice. One of them seemed a bit lost but perked right up and snapped out of it pretty quick when things got busy, which was great. Everyone was helpful and accomodating.The food was good. I mean, I have had better but I have also had much worse at other terraces. It's the kind of food that I would go back to for dinner but not for anything in particular. It s also hard as Montreal has so many amazing restaurants and the price here isnt exactly cheap. I would say you get what you pay for, this is including the ambience, the view, the space itself and the neighborhood.We ordered cocktails to start and followed with a bottle of wine. Then had the burrata, the scallops, the grilled sea bream and topped off with a strange millefeuille (strange because it was waffled and jad lemon curd dots which isnt something ud get in millefeuille - it wasnt bad at all, just not a millefeuille lol!)If u do go, definitely stay a little longer to go down to the club which is an old cave. Enjoy!"

The inside of the resto is totally spectacular and super romantic.

The food was good overall and they have great Sangria's so perfect spot for drinks as well.  I would definitely recommend trying this place at least once as it will historically transport you to another era!

/user_details?userid=-pG4fm6eWoGLP6fIsFBvzw,Teri Y.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"Such a pleasant surprise and this was a wonderful cap to our final night at Montreal. Our server was friendly and did a great in explaining the menu while recommending some of his favorite items (that's important in order to reflect the server's enthusiasm about the menu!).My husband and I started off with a dozen of refreshing East Coast oysters. Following that, the salmon tartare was light enough that it prepared us for the next items. Truly a fan of the creamy and smooth foie gras that I ate it just like that without the crackers in order not to ruin the pure taste of it. The halibut was of generous portion and the entire fillet was carefully and sliced and grilled. I really loved that the skin was still in tact when they grilled and presented the fish. We haven't gone the dessert route for a long time as we usually prefer to get another cocktail to end our night. We made an exception during this night since we enjoyed all the items that came out from the kitchen. No regrets at all and the pistachio olive oil cake was perfectly moist and not dense so we didn't leave filling like gluttons.The space here is gorgeous and it's located in a historic building."
/user_details?userid=sZpdRuqdpeb2pcUxnuAeMw,Stephen G.,"Boston, MA",1 star rating,"I went to this restaurant with high expectations due to the reviews and their online menu. Unfortunately, everything about this restaurant was truly, unforgivably terrible. First, we had a reservation for 8:30 made two weeks before. We showed up at 8:30. We were seated at 9:10. I understand, things happen, they were catering a wedding that night so I kept my hopes up that dinner would be good and they were just overwhelmed by the wedding party.Then we got our menus and discovered that the menu on their website is a total lie. As of November 3rd when we went, their website lists a delightful looking compilation of reasonably priced appetizers and entrees. When we arrived, however, we discovered they only offered a fairly expensive prix fixe menu. This was a shock, but not the end of the world as I generally like prix fixe menus. Not the most professional thing in the world, but I was willing to roll with it.But then the food arrived. And my God. The best options were simply forgettable. The worst options will haunt my nightmares for months to come. The cod dish was truly disgusting. I never knew cod could taste so fishy, as it had previously been a completely innocuous option at literally every restaurant. Two members of my party left untouched plates of cod for the waiter. He said nothing.While we waited for our bland desserts, we discovered that the wedding party had begun vomiting in the woman's restroom. Having had the cuisine, we were unsure of whether this was due to the food or the open bar. It took us an additional thirty or forty minutes to finally escape this terrible, terrible establishment.My only consolation about how horrible this expensive meal was is that I will be telling the story of this nightmare meal for years to come."

This is one of the worst meals I've had in a restaurant ever. I had the cod dish and it was absolutely terrible. We were never asked how our food was even though we barely ate it. We waited 40 minutes for a table even though we had a reservation. The whole experience was so bad that it became funny. We're all so confused at how this place has good reviews! Also there was vomit on the bathroom floor that wasn't cleaned up for over an hour. Waste of a lot of money and of 3 hours of my life."

/user_details?userid=WA9fjdFYyWon5ecMRUrJRg,Robert K.,"Milford, CT",3 star rating,"This restaurant is easy to miss along the main drag of Old Montreal. Nestled in North America's oldest Inn, the space does not lack character. The old stone walls and candle-lit fireplace harken back, while lighting, art and fixtures offer a bit more modern of a treatment. There's a dinosaur spine and other ultra-modern gothic fixtures. It's definitely trendy, and a little disjointed - but a cool space nonetheless.Service was great. Our waitress made a mistake with our order and offered up some pro bono treats in exchange. She was excellent otherwise. The food was more of a mixed bag. At one angle, the presentation was excellent. Everything was done artfully and with care, as one would expect at such a premium price point. The flavors themselves were mixed. The rabbit gaspacho was amazing. The foie gras appetizer was beautiful, but mixed sweet strawberry flavors with the bitter/salty foie gras. It was one of the most intensely flavored dishes I've ever had, but not in a good way. Perhaps my pedestrian palate is not up to the challenge, but neither of us could finish it. Shame. Onto the main course, the lamb was perfectly prepared and tender, and the accompaniments were an interesting mix of distinct and strong flavors. This worked better as a flavor profile, but I felt the texture was wrong. Everything seemed a bit mushy. It needed some other texture to offset the tender lamb. I might not be this picky normally, but at this price level I expect more. She had a homemade pasta dish, that was very good - but overly simplistic ingredient-wise for the price level, and scant with the pasta. Overall, there were some flashes of brilliance, a great space, good service - but an ultimately underwhelming overall food experience for the amount paid."

With that being said, I was skeptical at first since it was so elegant and chic inside (and also attached to a Marriott) but this place was hands down fantastic. Great service (Gale was knowledgeable and provided a top notch experience) and the food was on point. The atmosphere is also second to none. Expensive? Yes. Worth it?

The cornish hen stuff with sausages was also unbelievable.  I love the oysters came in a wooden trough.  Desserts were light and delicious.  My husband enjoyed the bison tartare, but I think they could've shopped them up slightly finer than what it was.  Some of the pieces were a big too big for me to eat raw meat, although you could taste how fresh and lean the meat itself it.Definitely recommend this place even though it may seem like a tourist trap with the location!  Food and service is worth it!"

The young men were also well coiffed. The service was a straight D. From moving our group to a better location, to an ability to relate to the anglos in our group, and even to the ability to bring food in a timely manner....well pretty sad!                 As for the food, the halibut was a small oily smothered portion of boredom. The pasta dishes, a creamy mess. Overall for an engorged tourist ripoff price, we could have done better in many other locations within a mile of this golden location.My advice..stop in view the old beauty and move on to one of Quebec's many many excellent eating establishments, a place with a well equipped, mature staff able to give the international tourist a worthwhile experience."

They have decorated well without destroying or hiding the original structure. The staff is friendly speaking both French and English fluently. Our dessert arrived while we were walking around and the hostess tracked us down, so that it wouldn't get cold. The Cornish hen was delicious and filling with mashed potatoes and salad. The steak was properly prepared and scrumptious but really needed more of a side, perhaps a salad. The desserts were rhubarb soufflé which took fifteen minutes and was worth it. The chocolate salted caramel was moist with a hard crust. Delicious fare, fabulous location and good service with interesting history. What more can you ask for?"

There is a large open fire in the dining room that is also used for some food prep, and there is an open rotisserie that was filled with Cornish hens. As it was the day after a major holiday, the menu may have been pared down but I couldn't say for sure. It was different than what was listed online. Regardless, we all found something. There was nothing our child would like on the regular menu and the bar menu wasn't available (it looked very good) but the server brought him a large portion of noodles with cheese that was appreciated. I had the Cornish hen and I liked it a lot. It's not something I would typically order but since it's a house specialty it seemed the better choice over scallops. My husband had the duck and it was very good. There is an assortment of fresh baked breads for the table that were delicious. I liked the sesame and the olive the best.Our server didn't explain that the price of an entree includes a starter and dessert so we were a little confused at first when ordering. We didn't find it noisy at all and there were people seated all around us but no one was on the couches directly behind us which could possibly have made a difference. This is a great place for a special occasion or if you are visiting from out of town. We'd definitely return."

The soup? Expensive prison gruel."
/user_details?userid=Qvzq9Ufc8gcraiesYjt0eg,Julia T.,"Calgary, Canada",5 star rating,"If Buffy the Vampire Slayer made the underworld sexy then L'Auberge is a fast follow. Decorated in modern gothic decor, the restaurant is adorned with heavy wood pieces, bare brick/stone walls lined with candles and dressed in Hirst inspired pieces of art including a whale spine and two stuffed horses with necks sewn together. If the decor wasn't cool enough, the bar with it's large selection of scotches and brandies alongside dripping pillars of candle is something I could sit and stare at all day. Arriving late, we were unable to order much food besides fries, burgers and a cheese platter but from what we had, everything was delicious. I'm sure the amount I had to drink contributed to the overall vibe of this place but it is seriously a cool venue. Besides the restaurant and bar, we happened to hit L'Auberge on a night when their downstairs opens as an after hours type of bar. Since we were already in the restaurant, we weren't charged cover which was apparently $20 per person. In any case, knowing now that the downstairs looks even cooler than upstairs I would definitely have paid it. After descending a flight of stone stairs, you go through a dark stone tunnel to a nightclub of sorts. There is only one bar, but multiple areas to sit or dance in. Following suit with the decor upstairs, the downstairs was similarly adorned with heavy wooden and leather furniture, wrought iron grates in some areas and walls filled with pillars of candles. For the adventurous, there was even a stripper pole to take things up a notch (women only, no men allowed on the pole according to the bouncer)! The music like the rest of the venue was a more transcendental kind of electronic which totally suited the space but may change depending on the evening. Overall, I would revisit L'Auberge if not to repeat the great time then to see in a sober state of mind whether it was scotch goggles or a truly cool place. Regardless, before the drinks started pouring, the venue was still beautiful so I would rate it 5 stars based on pre-drink experience."

L'Auberge Saint-Gabriel is tucked up a side street at the old port in Montreal, thick stone and wood make for a beautiful facade to reputedly the oldest inn in North America.  It has the warmth of an old cottage coupled with quirky decor and creative menu items, both in flavour and presentation.  I rank L'Auberge Saint-Gabriel high amongst the dining experiences I've experienced... and not just for the food!We were graciously greeted and seated at a lovely table in the dining room where we experienced impeccable service.  Our waitress was attentive and pleasant and out meal was accompanied with plenty of unexpected, amuse bouches along the way.  Our meals were well portioned and delightfully delicious, while appearing like art as they we placed at the table.  The fun at L'Auberge Saint-Gabriel continued after dinner as we explored the decor and played on the playground like carousel in the restaurant lobby.  We were lured in the bar area for after dinner cocktails.  The bar area displays a large sculpture of two large moose that are joined at the neck and each are adorned with a light bulb.  The most fun of the evening was when we learned how to turn the lights on/off... this happens via the button in the tail end of the moose!   tinyurl.com/bl3v6on We had a grand time with regular patrons at the bar who helped us to continue the amazing experience.  We we toured through a dark and narrow tunnel from the bar to an underground area of L'Auberge Saint-Gabriel which is known as Velvet, a posh locale high roller club that is open Thursday, Friday and Saturdays.  To our advantage, we had the club to ourselves and were entertained by a staff member with a few songs via an iPod to but a few moves while enjoying the unique environment.

When we got there, they were not quite ready yet, and they served food quite slowly. We waited for 30 minutes between appetizer and main dish. HOWEVER, I was very impressed by the taste of the food, so impressed that I could ignore the service inadequacy. I chose the mushroom soup, the risotto and the Black Forest cake. The cake was less good than the pineapple split cake. I'm not saying it was not good, but just not as good as the other one. The soup and the risotto were spot on....not mentioned the whole atmosphere, sitting on the river and looking at the city lights. It was a very good experience.

/user_details?userid=nDamS747QuFos0xn8ODARg,Seth R.,"New Haven, CT",5 star rating,"This is truly a must dine locale.  The ambiance is simply stunning.  The ancient timbers that support the roof and the stonework on the walls are a stark contrast to the suspended metal fireplaces and glass wine room.  There are some interesting art pieces as well such as a giant whale spine at the entrance and two large moose that are joined at the neck which adds a very eclectic spin to the traditional, yet stunning, architecture.   As for the food?  The Châteaubriand was, without question, the best steak I've ever had.  The fillet was fork tender, perfectly seasoned and sliced right at the table.  They dry age each steak on the premises and they can be seen in a glass storage room at the entrance.  A friend of mine had the rabbit paella which was both a visual treat and extremely tasty.  The wait staff was friendly, prompt, responsive, and spoke fluent English.For those interested in wine, the list is extensive (although very French dominant) and the prices are varied.  The restaurant has TWO trained sommeliers on staff and the one that assisted our party was extremely knowledgeable.  She was very patient with our questions and pared three excellent wines for our dinner (no easy task because the meals varied from light fish to heavy meats and everything in between.)  The underground club was not for us.  Cramped, hot, low ceilings and extremely minimal lighting made for an unpleasant club experience but I would not deduct any stars from the restaurant food/ambiance/service."

We went to the bar of the auberge saint gabriel while waiting for the club to open its doors. I ordered two drinks but shortly after ( i had maybe two sips and my sister's glass was full), i spilled my drinks on my clothes and it made a mess. The barmaid saw me and was literally watching for a minute before handing me a napkin. I reached behind the bar to grab some more because i was wet and the chair also. After watching me clean myself she approached and asked me if i wanted another drink. I said yes of course give me the same. She served me and quickly took the bill , made a new one and put it in front of me. I said excuse me I thought you were offering the drink to me... she said dont you know how it works? When you order a drink you have to pay for it.... I was insulted. As if she was telling me i was cheap or that i dropped my drink on purpose .i barely took a sip paid and left for another bar. There is no way i will pay money in a place where i feel disrespected. This barmaid needs a lesson in customer service."

But the bar and wait staff were friendly pros, very quick, always smiling. They remembered the beer I was drinking even in a crush of 200 people and took a second to have a laugh with everyone. The space is so essentially Old Montreal, a nearly 300 year old stone building with twisting wooden staircases, pianos, comfy chairs and epic modern art on a tiny ancient alley in this most romantic part of town."

I give credit to our waitress Pauline who wasted no time taking our orders, serving including a free but small appetizer, dessert and no problem receiving individual bills. But the food for the price was not good value. I had the barley rosotto which was good, lots of crunchy French bread and chateaubriand for $43 was overpriced for the quality. My wife could not eat her lemon crumble as just too much lemon. I agreed after tasting. All desserts included diary and I asked for a fruit serving which I received. A nice touch.

I haven't been that satisfied after a corporate event in ages - the fact that the staff kept surprising us with more and more canapés didn't hurt either. They were also really cool about letting us overstay our welcome. Even after they had started taking down the setup, the staff were super gracious about us lingering and drinking some more.

After checking out the dinner prices, we decided our three-hour drive through the rain had taken away our desire for a fine dining experience, so we ventured out into the pouring rain in search of a more ordinary dinner.The second night, however, the door was closed, the menu gone, and our curiosity just got the better of us. So at about 11 PM, we ventured through the portal into what turned out to be the coatroom, and an easy way around the $10 cover charge they were asking at the door! Score.Once we were settled with drinks, I said to my husband, ""I think this place is too cool for us."" I'm not sure whether it was the huge, uplit dinosaur backbone, or the animal-hoof coat hooks on the wall, or the group of guys on rolling stools that kept buying the bartender shots, but I felt much older and less hip than I normally do. It was fun to see the beautiful people arrive in grandeur and depart with a little more affection, though.Cocktails were fine, prepared to order and priced normally for a large city. On our way out we perused the cured meats on display and peeked into the stylishly rustic dining room. Someday I'd like to return for the food everyone's raving about here!"

While the food we ordered met our expectations, we found ourselves quite limited by the selection on the menu. I am certainly not alone in my dislike of mushrooms, so when we noticed that all four mains contained them, it was rather disappointing. My partner and I ended up settling on two soups and a large charcuterie plate, but had to struggle with the waiter to place this order. We were informed that this is not the proper French way to enjoy a dinner, and that we should in fact order more than would actually satisfy us. For the record, we understand what an appetizer is. Despite this, our server did succeed in pairing a suitable wine for our meal and was helpful in our dessert selection."

His sweet potato gratin was delicious as well. I had the stuffed cabbage and it was delicious as well. The mushroom cream sauce really tied it all together.

It's located within a refurbished inn from the late 1600s and inside there is a great deal of modern art (not shown on their website). All the art, chandeliers and drapery mixed with the brick walls and wooden columns creates a really interesting dichotomy and ambiance. I ended up dining at the bar on my visit to L'Auberge Saint-Gabriel because the bartender, Adrian, was so attentive and helpful even though he was probably exhausted from the massive NYE celebration the evening before. All the servers were obviously knowledgeable and friendly and the highlights were the foie gras and the bison tartare. They give you baked snacks and complimentary desserts (not sure if it was just because of New Years but they were amazing). Adrian also made me a hot toddy upon request which perked me right up after walking in the winter snow for an hour. Great restaurant and I highly recommend!"

We made reservations for a Wednesday night and good thing we did as it was pretty full by 7pm. The food is delicious and definitely not overpriced. The waiters were present without hovering. We shared the charcuterie plate, which, with all the bread they continuously brought out, could easily do one person for lunch, but was perfect for a shared app. My husband devoured his Cornish hen and my bouillabaisse was so flavourful. They substituted something in it for mini shrimps which sounded great to me! If you can, save room for dessert! We got the maple soufflé & poached pear which were both light but extremely tasty. I was so full by this point but then they brought out little petit fours with your bill, which of course were so good.

Have tried several different dishes and it is consistently great. The charcuterie plate is highly recommended.At the bar there is a really great group of people in front of and behind the bar. The staff is incredibly friendly, inviting and have a decent amount of regulars coming in to see them. There is also a party room (or 2?) for events so if that is of interest.... check it out.

I´m sure, based on other reviews, that our case was exceptional and that usually this restaurant is awesome (they seated guests late, so my guess is that there was a problem in the kitchen).

/user_details?userid=YsD8bQt0IWCCGZeHXQiIuQ,Max K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I visited the Auberge St. Gabriel for the first time on a blustery September night.  We were a party of four: my husband, two out-of-town guests, and me.  We knew that the physical premises are impressive (see the many other reviews that talk about this), but we wanted to try the food because we need to select a restaurant for a group event that is being planned for later.  To dispense with the ambiance immediately, I have to say that it is indeed impressively ""old Montreal"", but I also found it too dark (I had trouble seeing the menu) and a little noisy.  When I called to make the reservation, I asked if there would be choices on the menu for vegetarians, and I was told there would be, and I should ask the server.  There was exactly ONE vegetarian choice on the menu, so I assumed that the server would tell me what else the chef might do for me.  The answer was that the dish on the menu was my only choice.  When will restaurants learn to provide more vegetarian choices?!!  Among the options in the main courses there was one choice for me and I think at least six for the omnivores.  Also among the little extra perks that are offered -- there was a plate of twisted bread with chorizo, and afterwards a very pretty plate with some vegetable content but also containing salmon -- there was nothing suitable for a vegetarian.  In some restaurants I have been given a meatless tidbit when these little extras are offered, but I had the impression that at the Auberge St Gabriel the server never did process the fact that I do not eat meat.  It is a small thing, but it does reflect on the degree to which a restaurant caters to customers.But we were there to learn whether the food is really good or not.  The bread was wonderful.  We were given a serving platter with bread and a bread knife, and this was left on the table throughout the meal, allowing people to cut bread if they wanted more.  We all started with the ""fresh mixed baby greens"", which was a very refreshing and copious salad.  My three companions all chose the same main course -- the lamb shoulder -- and pronounced it delicious.  My main course was the only thing offered to vegetarians -- Pasta Acini -- but I have to admit that it was delicious.  It consisted of tiny rice-shaped pasta, well coated with a green sauce that I think was made from zucchini, and in it were also tempura zucchini flowers, figs and almonds.  Creative and yummy.Between the main course and dessert the Auberge offered us a macaroon and a small glass of cold cider.  Very nice!  One of my companions chose the ""Abracadabra"" for dessert.  It was a chocolate-y confection with amaretto ice cream.  The other two both opted for the ""Pie aux pouces"", which included strawberries and mascarpone, with the novel feature that the server cuts it at the table in either one, two or three inch servings (hence the ""aux pouces"", which means by the inch).  I chose the simple ""chocolate pie"", which was anything but simple.  It was a rich chocolate construction and came with a spoonful of ice cream served on a square of what must have been chocolate shavings that adhered to the plate.  The ice cream was melted, but otherwise the dessert was delicious, like everything else.There was a surprise for me at the end, when we received the bill and were ready to leave.  The server gave me a big brownie, wrapped in cellophane, and told me that it was for my breakfast.  I wonder whether they give a brownie to all women customers (I was the only woman in our party), or whether it was an offering to make up for having so few vegetarian options.  In any case, they made points (shall I say ""brownie points""?) with that.  I ate the brownie today and it was scrumptious.My overall assessment of the Auberge Saint Gabriel is positive.  Everything we ate was excellent, without exception.  The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the lack of vegetarian choices."

Our main course was a tinny piece of beaf tenderloin half of which was over cooked, with a tinny piece of foie and a broken sauce.

All of the wines served were mediocre and we had to flag the sommelier down 3 times so he could poor the wines they were paired with, as the food sat there and got cold, or in some cases melted. The cheese course was nothing but 3 small pieces of cheese on a plate put in the middle of the 3 of us to share, that's not a dish! Nor a course!When we spoke to the sommelier about these concerns at the end of the meal he argued with us about it, and told of the champagne he gave us with desert ( a mistake in itself ) was a gift, as he was already over his budget on us.

Something summery and drinkable, but not a fab wine.  After all that, we really expected something great.  Additionally, the sommelier never told us the price, nor showed it to us on the menu.  In all of my previous experiences with sommeliers, they will point in the menu at least one option (sometimes more than one option), and you order, knowing the price (whether it's $40 or $400).  So, not only did the sommelier have in his list wines that a regular customer would not ""enjoy,"" but he brought us an opened bottle, suggested a wine that was not along the wine that we wanted that evening, didn't even ask us what we were eating, and didn't even show the price of the wine brought to the table.   Very amateurish.Fortunately, we just looked at each other, ordered mojitos, and the rest of the evening went off without a hitch.  The food was solid and interesting.  The main dishes were particularly good (duck and fish).  It was a little gimmicky - the waiter pours the sauces at the table (this could have easily been poured in the kitchen!).  I couldn't help but feel they were trying oh so hard to make an impression of being so sophisticated.  But, both the duck and the fish were well executed and the flavors were solid., so I know there is talent somewhere in that kitchen behind all that fanfare.  I just wish they would have the confidence that the food is good enough.  Because, right now the restaurant ""experience"" is an epic fail."

The old brick building and ""table d'hote"" menu out front both attracted our attention.Basically one picks a main course, and the appetizer and dessert come included (small supplement for a handful of items).We were more in the mood for a sandwich or panini, but looking at the menu, we decided to give it a shot, and go for something lighter for dinner instead.We walked into a wonderful old building, beautifully decorated (there is a majestic whale spine at the entrance), and were seated in the clear and reasonably  quiet restaurant room (it was probably half full)For appetizer, we had the charcuterie (it was ""fromage de tete"" that day) and the salmon (almost like a sashimi, really). Both excellent, and wonderfully presented. For mains, we had the cod, with beans and a meat sauce (surprising at first, but really delicious and goes wonderfully with the flavorful cod), and the salmon, perfectly cooked medium-rare, with a few little fixings on the side (more for flavor).For dessert, we had a chocolate panna cotta with raspberries and a St Honore cake with some apples (and again a ton of various flavors on the plate). The latter was the best and one of the most amazing desserts I've had in a long time.The chef is really a master at presentation, and at elegantly mixing flavors that one wouldn't naturally imagine to put together.I will also say that it is not all that common to find a restaurnant that excels at both savory food and desserts, so extra props for that.This seems underrated today at 3.5, but again it's possible that the prices are much higher for dinner, setting expectations much higher... this review focuses on lunch, which costs CAD ~30 per person (+ tax + tip).Service was excellent, friendly and attentive."

The more impressive aspect is the beautiful old stone walls, now somewhat combined with a well-done modern bar area. The owners have changed in the last few years, but only for the better. The chef does seasonal menus using quebec style food. A great value in Old Montreal to show off the loacal cuisine. Gaetane is great to work with for planning large events on a budget in the Truteau room."

As they say they are the oldest inn in  North America and one of the oldest bars, it was quite cool to see how they decorated mixing old and new. We visited for lunch as the prices are a bit steep, but lunch was great. The service was great, too. They do allow you to taste the wine you order before pouring you a drink, in case you would like something different."

There was lovely al fresco seating, but no place large enough for our group of six, so we went indoors. What a cool spot. Interesting art on the walls (and if you head into the bar, there's some really funky art!), comfortable and elegant seating. We ordered from the 3-course prix fixe lunch menu (from 19$-28$ cdn), and were presented with lovely -- and delicious offerings. In our group, we started with a martini glass filled with Shrimp from Gaspasia with a corn and tomato coulis that tasted like summer, a delicious fennel gazpacho, and a tuna tatake to die for. Entrees included taglitelle with summer veg and bison meatballs, fried liver with a frisee salad and salmon tartare. Desserts were appropriately small and extremely lovely. Their by the glass wine list included a couple of tasty Quebec wines. This place is a gem. Check it out!"
