I ordered a chicken salad, Vietnamese egg rolls and a nice bowl of hot noodle soup, it was soooo good and tasty. You can tell they don't put MSG. I also love their Vietnamese ice coffee and 3 colour coconuts drink. The service is ok. The owner is friendly. Recommended!!"
/user_details?userid=6btMczuTVuoJnmarbkWP_A,Lo C.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"For my last meal in Montreal I had to try a viet restaurant.I researched places that were on our way out of the city and Pho Tay Ho was conveniently on the way.The restaurant is a little run down with only street parking but still giving off some good homey feelings.We were seated quickly and offered menus.We ordered:- Special pho (small): The soup itself pretty good and new in flavoring for me. It was savoury and tasted great with sriracha. There were lots of beef slices in the bowl but most of them were really chewy. The downside is the amount of noodles I got lol, literally next to nothing. This was really disappointing as I basically left hungry.- Chicken pho (small): They used thick slices of chicken in this dish. The flavour of the soup itself was realy enjoy. My boyfriend actually told me he thinks there were more onions in the bowl than noodles.- Vietnamese Coffee Iced: my boyfriend really enjoyed this. I think it helped keep him away for most of the drive back home.I paid $30 for 2 small bowls of pho and a viet coffee. This was disappointing as I left hungry."
/user_details?userid=ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,Jando S.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,"In general, I'm always happy to eat pho. Whenever I'm in a place like Montreal, I'm especially down to rock pho knowing it'll be better than my most of what is offered in my neck of the woods. (#1) Pho Tay Ho, a famous name in its own right, pays homage to the Tay Ho region of Hanoi, more specifically the West Lake (Ho Tay Lake).I can't say this is the best pho in Montreal or even that it's semi-reminiscent of the Tay Ho massive. What I have enjoyed over the years is a halfway decent broth in a nice big bowl (xe lua) in a fairly serene setting (it's never too rowdy here), and a solid execution across a variety of classic Vietnamese dishes.For folks not feeling the pho, I would recommend any of their bun (noodle) dishes and their rice (com). If one orders a bun thit nuong (pork chop), the portions are substantially enough to keep even the hungriest eaters at bay. Of course, I would recommend their appetizers of spring rolls (cha gio) and summer rolls (goi cuon).The prices have always been right, the place is spacious to handle all sorts of groups, they always have a sparkling clean bathroom, and the customer service is friendly. If I haven't been thrilled about one thing it's the fact they close at 8:30pm, which I find to be prime dinner hours. I was always told that it's because pho typically runs out long before then. _____________(#1) That would be NYC."

The sauté beef and veggie pho was better than the shrimp and veggie pho. The service was fast and the options on the menu were plentiful! I especially liked that we had complementary tea with our meal. Hats off to this place!"

Husband and I ordered one bowl of XL Pho Ga (Chicken Tonkinese Soup) to share. The quality of ingredients and quantity was excellent, however the taste was nothing out of the ordinary. We have tried many Pho places in Montreal and this one was definitely average in comparison. Our total was $13 after tax. Service was excellent."

I've been meaning to give Pho Tay Ho a try so I met up with E on an early Wednesday evening and we were able to snag a seat on the terrasse right out front. Service is spotty as once we ordered and got our food, they never came back to check on us. I like that they have a sheet for you to mark your order. Keep it because you'll need it to pay after. Note: you can pay with debit.- Bo tai chanh (#3) ($10.00) - interestingly, this rare beef salad comes with shrimp chips. Not the best that I've had; I would have liked a little more acidity and brightness to it. - Pho ga, long ga, tai (#15) ($10.00 large) - mix of gizzard, liver, heart of chicken and rare beef. Rarely order chicken pho but the broth was very clean tasting and lemongrass was at the forefront. - Pho tom voi rau (#20) ($10.00 large) - shrimp and vegetables. Broth was a little more sweeter but the shrimp was tasty (you only get four though). Cheap, tasty and filling; can't really ask for anything else."

A bowl of comforting Pho is the best remedies for hangover after bar hopping.Bo Thai Chanh ($10) Rare Beef Salad was a huge serving which I enjoyed. House Special Pho ($10) was decent.So nothing really stand out for a special visit but worth coming if you are in the neighbourhood and craving some solid Vietnamese food!Pho Tay Ho can be super busy even on a week nights. But at least on a warm summer evening, the back patio is open for business."
/user_details?userid=nGvLkjB8QxFuhDMP1-IIDA,Dash H.,"Peoria, IL",3 star rating,"This is an average pho place, there was nothing special about the flavors here. I liked the mural outside of the establishment, it was beautiful. We sat in the back area kinda half inside the building and half outside. My gf ordered Bo tai chanh (which was actually good) it had a good portion of it, shared amongst 3 ppl. Which was plenty. The flavors reminded me of thai style. I loved the peanuts adding the nutty sweet flavor onto the beef. There was also an herb that made the rare beef tasted wonderful. The sauce it came with was sweet. So we added a bit more salty fish sauce along with 2 hot chilli peppers to add a kick into the dish. It was like exploding with flavors after all that. Remember to squeeze on the lime though.Next we ordered the Pho dac biet and Pho tai chin.They were small bowls... I remember ordering Beef... but the broth came out smelling like hardcore chicken noodle soup. It smelt like chicken, which reminds me of a gamey smell, i was not pleased with it. It smelled nothing like pho... felt like they catered to a diff crowd here. The Cooked beef was also off, tasted exactly like what it is, and there was no masking that flavor. The rare beef was normal. The pho overall was a disappointment. I would never go here again for pho .As for my gf, she ordered a bun thit bo nuong. ThAt dish came out HUGE, big enuff to feed 3 ppl. It was good, the bun was well cooked (still moist and not stale)  and beef tasted well seasoned. The only complaint here is the damn sweet fish sauce. Its like they dumped the entire box of sugar in it. Calm down on the sugar sweethearts.The cafe sua da , i usually like my coffee bitter (like more of an espresso) but this coffee had an awful taste. The condensed milk couldnt even help it taste any better. Yuck. The soy milk on the other hand was good, i liked the soy milk.Overall im giving this place a 3/5"

Came here after hearing so many vietnamese friends talk about this place: wasn't disappointed at all. The portions are huge. The grilled chicken was perfectly marinated and was delicious. I couldn't finish the plate. The spring roll was normal and the 3 colors dessert was good, but I've had better. The service is very quick and the food is relatively cheap. Will I come back? Oh yes I will, especially for that delicious grilled meat."

I ordered the number 8 which was the rare beef and dry flank which super delicious. My friend had the veggie and let's just say I was just a bit jealous of the flavor of her dish. Super recommend this place, and don't let the those other reviews that claim that this place has bad service, always understand that you're going into a restaurant that has a different culture than your own. They are busy, but don't let those reviews keep you from enjoying some good food."

The soup wasn't hot enough.

It's so good. The dish I pretty much always get here is number twenty something, it comes with these homemade ground pork rolls and noodles and broth and veggies and it's just an insane mountain of incredibly flavourful delicate wonderful food. I take home the leftovers and eat it for like 3 days, and I cheat on my vegetarian-ness here when I crave it and I ain't even sorry about it. You have to follow your heart, man, you know? I find the service here totally great, and very Vietnamese. They aren't all fake smily with you but they are super professional, and will crack you up and slide you a sweet grin if you're paying attention. This is one of the best and beloved Vietnamese places in the city so if you come at peak times you'll find a line. I recommend mid-afternoon on a weekday. Relax and enjoy."
/user_details?userid=EjZdTc6D7au3MYTYfVGPHw,Michelle C.,"Oxnard, CA",1 star rating,Their service was terrible. Walked in without any acknowledgement from the staff and finally we were seated. Had to continuously flag down a waiter to make our order and ask questions. Food wasn't that impressive either really. There's a ton of noodle choices around the city. I'd skip this one
/user_details?userid=voFxNdzhG-cDrW_9NzFGbw,Denzil D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is our go to local Pho place, but don't let the word ""local"" fool you into thinking it is only good for this area. There a few great things about this place. The staff is fast, friendly and good. The location is packed but well run and cozy (unless you get stuck at the tables near the door and line-up is all around you). The food is very good. The quality is good and the price is very good for the quantity. We regularly go with the whole family because it is affordable and children friendly. We have tried many things on the menu and all are good, but the favorites are the Pho, the bowls of noodles or rice and the meat platters. Check out the pictures. Enjoy!"

Very flavourful broth yet, very simple and clear.It's not the best pho I had. However, the location and the cleanliness of the place truly make up for it.I would say, it's the pho place I would take somebody who is unsure about Asian food. It's delicious, clean and simple enough to make anyone a fan.The terrace is really great."

/user_details?userid=_PvyIrD0Mp-NswjUKv1URA,Deborah K.,"Mississauga, Canada",3 star rating,"This was our first visit to Pho Tay Ho. We were impressed that the waitstaff spoke both English and French.There is a large dining area and a patio for al fresco dining.We ordered two bowl of pho and one vermicelli dish. The pho was tasty, filled with plenty of beef and noodles and came with a healthy bunch of basil and plenty of bean sprouts.The vermicelli was served on a huge platter with lots of grilled pork, 2 skewers of grilled shrimp and 2 spring rolls. There was soooo much fresh basil, mint, lettuce and bean sprouts on the side. Although we thought $15 seemed a lot for a vermicelli dish, they certainly didn't skimp on anything so we could see why it cost more than usual.We also had an iced coffee with condensed milk. It tasted good, but there was very little condensed milk so it was quite strong and not really sweet enough (and we don't like it too sweet). Our son ordered a fresh lime juice with sugar and soda but they were out of soda, so they gave him 7up instead. The problem was that they still added the sugar to the lime juice, so the whole thing was way too sweet.All in all, the meal was pretty good and we'd probably return."

A lot of good options to choose from. Since the weather was already pretty warm (compared to the recent winter ) I decided not to go with the pho even though it looked really good. Instead I went for the daily special. I took the grilled chicken one.It comes with a soup. The soup is good but the issue is that the service is too fast that before the soup is done the main meal is already there.The food is really good and the service is quick making it perfect for lunch."

But, having just arrived in Montreal...what a buzzzzzz kill.I am not usually a person to slam a restaurant unless it's really warrented. This was warrented. Food is more a 3 star, the spring rolls and the fresh rolls were very good. They offer Med-Xlarge pho size. Good flavor, harty and good price.Now, let's talk about service because that is a huge part of the experience. To be fair, I will admit, my friend is a bit demanding, but whether it's culturally acceptable or not, we tip generously and are not rude about our needs. I also need to understand maybe it's just a Canadian ""thing"" to be not very personable. I don't know, but to me, customer service is customer service! With that being said, our waiter was RUDE and his rude sarcasm was not appreciated and I LOVE sarcasm. He was quick to judge us as Americans. After ordering additional spring rolls, he ignored us and we never received them. He snubbed us the whole time and avoided eye contact. We asked for tea and he said there was none and then brought us a pot. WTF, that was not confusing at all. He could not get us out fast enough. Don't worry dude, we ate fast and left as fast as we could."

Their broth is fragrant -- it is not watery or overly salty.  Delicate bits of fat sit on the surface of their soup, decorated with fresh herbs and a decent helping of round eye.   Their noodles are neither overcooked or undercooked.  Basil, lime, and bean sprout sit on a separate plate in generous portions and are very fresh.  I haven't encountered a dried out lime here yet, which is one of my pho grudges. Seating is abundant -- there is atrium seating as well as patio seating in both the front and the back for sunnier days and their service is wonderful.  Come, eat here.   This is a good bowl of soup.  I often come here when it is swelteringly hot outside and that's only because it's too hard to say no."

The soup was extremely tasty, I think they also added chicken broth along with beef soup. It was soooo good! We also got the beef salad, it was quite special. Kind of like beef tartar but got a Vietnamese spin to it with loads of peanuts and fresh herbs. Great!They also give you a small bowl along with your soup, it's for you to miss the sauces and dip your pho in there for some added flavour.It was such a satisfying lunch!"

Checked my Yelp app and noticed this place saved in my Bookmark selection. Walked in and about 30 patrons were inside. I was the only non-Asian in the place. Excellent. I'm at the right place for some quality Vietnamese.Walking in, the place looks somewhat simplistic with a terrace on both sides available if it weren't fall or winter. The ambiance was nice.I went with the Tay Ho 'Special BBQ' dish (Bun Cha Tay Ho) and it came back 10 minutes later. It was excellent. The soup was amazing, the meats hit the spot and the side order was mighty tasty. And the price tag was ridiculous for this kind of quality. I immediately felt jealous for people able to walk/order from this place on a daily basis.On my way out, I took some Vegetarian Pho home for the wife and even with the winter tip home, she has never had Pho this good.Would come back again... and again."
/user_details?userid=LN4ajhAiIshKkXJQhuh6uA,Kali E.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Not one of my favourite Pho places. I do appreciate their other menu items. However, I am always disappointed in their Pho as it tastes too oily. Staff is friendly and very fast paced."
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I think it's safe to say that I've found, in my opinion, the best place for pho in Montréal. It seems to be a general trend with Asian food that the best places are often not in the downtown area, but in the less-populated and not as touristy districts. With Pho Tay Ho, I finally had a bowl that was not only deeply satisfying, but had a broth that was flavorful all on its own without needing additional seasoning.Even though I went at an earlier time, the restaurant was already packed with an even distribution of Asians and other people, so I decided that it must be worth the ten minute wait. Once I sat down, I was given a check-off menu which made for extremely efficient service by Montréal standards. I ordered the Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk, a shrimp spring roll, and a medium bowl of pho with beef balls, tripe, and raw and cooked slices of beef. Overall, everything arrived fairly quickly, so I was able to dig in - nothing disappointed me. The iced coffee had a perfect balance between the strong brew and the sweetness of the condensed milk, and the spring roll actually had a decent amount of shrimp and, when paired with the accompanying sauce, made everything combine into an interesting salty/slightly-sweet fusion. The pho was undoubtedly the star of the meal here, as it should be. The tangy and savory broth, which is crucial to a good pho, was fantastic, as it really made everything better. All of the meats tasted outstanding, and even my usually least-favorite cut, the tripe, was tender and really soaked up all of the delectable broth. I could sink my teeth right into the beef balls, and they do not hold back on the beef flavor here. Also, as a huge fan of the raw beef used in pho, it cooked quite nicely and, once again, took in the flavors of the broth and elevated it to a new level. Of course, the rice noodles had a bounciness to them that made them a delight to chew on, and by the time I was done, I really wished that I had ordered a larger bowl because I didn't want to be done with it.The next time my friends and I decide to go out for pho, I think I know which new place to bring them to. Pho Tay Ho is as good as it gets and lives up to the hype and so much more."

Especially on those colder fall/winter nights, nothing beats a good bowl of Pho. That's why Pho Tay Ho, has become a trusted neighbourhood spot for the fam and me. This place tends to get very busy, so I personally prefer coming on slower week nights. As opposed to some of the other Pho restaurants in town, the staff here is great and quite accommodating when we come, even with the newborn. From Pho to rice noodle bowls and tremendous rice plates, we are never disappointed when we come. If you're new to Vietnamese, go for a spring roll, the raw beef Pho or grilled porc plate. And don't forget the Vietnamese coffee. Bonne appétit!"

The menu has a nice variety of Vietnamese dishes, and you order yourself with the paper and pencil provided. The food came out quickly although service could have been a bit more attentive. Ca Phe Phin Sua Da was a little too bitter even though we asked for extra condensed milk. The Sau Dau Nanh tasted perfectly sweet. It was my first time having Bo Tai Chanh and wow was it good. Great flavors and there was a good amount of rare steak.  The Bun Hoac com bo nuong was okay. The noodles were abundant and cooked well; while the beef tasted delicious, it was a bit too chewy at times.  Now, I thought the pho was delicious. However, it did not remind me of pho. It reminded me of chicken noodle soup, like Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup. This is good but it is not what I'm expecting when I order beef pho. It tasted like they used a chicken broth and added beef. Their rare steak, well done beef flanks, and meatballs were also good. There was only 1-2 quarter slices of meatballs though, but the flank was abundant and had fatty ends to it that were cooked perfectly. It's not an extraordinary place but it's definitely worth a stop if you are in the area."

The onions and peanuts really highlighted the taste. The pho was also really great - awesome meat quality and broth. The bf ordered the grilled shrimp, pork and imperial rolls over vermicelli and LOVED it - he went in not even being super hungry but basically finished eating the entire thing.

I was pleasantly surprised when I waited outside in line to get a seat to find out that this was the amazing place that I had pho a year ago. This place is always packed; this pho cannot compare to the pho in Chinatown. The broth is so delicious and fresh that there is no need to put in sriracha or hoisin (unless you need it) to make the broth taste better.

Came here on an extremely cold night, looking for a nice bowl of pho, I was not disappointed. The restaurant was packed at 7pm, the two of us got lucky got seated within 5 min here. Ordered two pho Dac biet and shrimp rolls. Nothing fancy but always comforting. Food came pretty fast too. Big portion, the broth do taste different from the ones in toronto, doesn't have as much flavoring, not as complex?? but still good. The tendons are very chewy, as if they were undercooked air dried tendon, we could not bite through them at all. The beef were very fatty, they weren't sliced very thinly, somehow I enjoyed the fat lol. The meal was very good overall, we were too cold and tired, we felt great afterward.The service here was great, fast and attentive staff. One other thing I was very impressed was how clean their utensil were. The steel tea pot was shiny and spot less, not even any water mark on it. I thought it was only that single one we got. When we were paying at the front, I saw a whole stack of teapot and cups just as clean and shiny as they ones we got. They deserve an award for that!Not the best pho I've ever had, but I was highly impressed with my meal and experience. Will recommend."

We noticed many local Viet's frequented this restaurant.We ordered both the Chicken pho and Raw beef/tripe pho. The soup base was made with chicken instead of the traditional beef, but I really liked how comparatively refreshing it was. The noodles were thicker then the usual and not as chewy as I would like.The ice coffee was very traditional, using the Viet drip, then pouring it over ice. Not very fragrant but  strong and tasty coffee.The four stars is for a unique Viet experience but not especially for the food."

You get a menu and also a sheet to order on. Write the quantity down and someone will pick it up and put in the order. We also got the bo thai Chanh (beef salad - raw) and it is phenomenal.

There are 3 sizes you can get; medium for $9, large for $10, and XL for $11. I got the large & my boyfriend got the XL, and we both agreed the portions were big enough. I consider it cheap pho cause in the states it costs about $9 for a bowl but in American dollars, so it is cheaper here. 4 stars because it was kind of hectic, granted we went during dinner rush on a Friday night. Also, their fried spring rolls (or as they're called on the menu, imperial rolls) were not that good compared to what I'm used to. Still good overall and worth a shot."

Went there at 3pm on a monday to get drinks and desserts. Restaurant was mostly empty. We were told to sit at the back with a flick of a wrist by the waitress. We tried to sit twice at two different tables, but we were redirected until we got to one specific table (they should've taken us to the table if that was such a problem). Then, we looked at the menu and made our choices. Several waiters passed by our table without noticing we were ready to order, even though we had our order sheet on the edge of the table and we were trying to make eye contact with them. Eventually, one waiter came, took the order sheet, glanced at it, looked at us with contempt, and just said ""we don't do only drinks and desserts, you need to order a meal"". Told him we had already eaten somewhere else, but he didn't care and just left with the menus. It didn't make any sense since the restaurant was empty. They also seemed impatient when we took a minute to leave. The whole experience left a pretty sour taste. Fortunately, there are plenty of other excellent viet restaurants in montreal."

It was packed full but we were seated (party of four) i about 5 minutes. Unfortunately I was disappointed by almost everything: the beef pho broth really lacked in flavour, there were barely any noodles and way too much beef. My boyfriend got a chicken and beef pho (with chicken broth) which lacked even more in flavour and tasted as though it had been watered down. The grilled chicken dish was HUGE, so that was cool, but the chicken didn't taste that great. As well, the service wasn't the best, not very attentive and not super chaleureux. I did, however, really like the imperial rolls, those were delicious. Will not come back to this place again."

He talked me into sharing a first course dish of raw beef with lemon, onions and peanuts that was served with a fish sauce on the side. Fan-frigging-tastic! scooping it with shrimp crispies kinda reminded me of really fresh mexican nachos (with an Asian twist to it). It was a big dish, and we didn't even finish it before our mains arrived.  By my friend recommendation I took the L size soup.  It turned out to be way too much, together with the first course... but I  loved it. I got the beef pho with everything (raw beef, flank beef, beef balls with a weird condensed texture, some sort of intestines that were too chowie for by taste). Of course there were noodles and green onions in the broth (which was good), as well as extra sprouts and holly basil on the side. Very satisfying dish. I'm glad I had it and that I got to try different types of beef additions to my soup - to find out what I like a lot and what's not really for me. My friend had a good beef, noodles, and veggies dish which was also a success. I loved this place!It's by far the best Vietnamese restaurant place I have been to."

Furthermore, the pho noodles are so fresh and they feel like silk when you slurp your soup.If you like to sunbath a little I'd recommend getting a table towards the back of the restaurant as there are huge windows there.I almost forgot to mention that although the service is not the best, the orders come out quicker than a blink of an eye.

Back in the day, a bowl of Pho was around 5$, prices have gone up quite a bit since, but you can still get a good meal here with a drink for less than 20$ taxes and tips included, which is still a huge deal!!!The Pho really shine here, both the Chicken and Tai Nam variety. My tip for you is: ASK THEM TO PUT KAFIR LIME LEAVES IN YOUR PHO, no matter which option you pick. The lime leaves will bring out a new dimension to all the flavors... trust me just try it :) (I'm vietnamese and grew up eating this stuff). For me, this is the best Pho in town, it is consistently good. Pho is a very fussy thing to make well consistently, if you ever go to a pho place regularly you will notice sometimes the taste is off. For this place though when it's off it's still good, and when it's on, there's just no better.This place is famous for the Tay Ho special bbq dish,  (Bun cha Tay Ho), it comes with different types of grilled meats soaked in fish sauce, vermicelli and a heap of herbs, mix everything in a bowl and eat, the fun part is to mix different herbs each time, add some fish sauce and voila!!!Another signature dish is the ""Cha ca"" dish, it's grilled tumeric spiced fish on a hot plate, served with vermicelli and a heap of fried onions and dill. This one you eat with a shrimp paste sauce. The flavors in this dish is very pungent, definitely an acquired taste, be mindful if you want to try.

The service is good and one thing I should mention is the portion size of the food is quite unbelievably large for a Vietnamese place, especially the bun cha gio. My friend goes there often and she told me the portion sizes here are large, and boy she was not lying. The salad was good a chunk of the plate, the imperial rolls and vermicelli took up half of the plate and so on. I ordered a modest medium pho ga,..they gave me so much meat...I was very happy. The highlight of this restaurant, is that they have bo tai chanh which is Vietnamese beef carpaccio. This is rare because most Vietnamese restaurants do not offer this dish. Portion size, again, quite large and came with many shrimp chips and underneath big pieces of lettuce.This place is really quite something, maybe I'm overhyping it but anyways,  eat there. The end."

I've been to Vietnam so obviously I'm a bit of a snob, but this isn't even the best restaurant in the city. Worst of all I had a terrible experience with this old waiter there. He was super rude and condescending. Asked him for suggestions he just shrugged and pouted for some strange reason. My girlfriend, Amanda (hot piece of Ace) called him out on his antics and he smiled. HE KNEW THE WHOLE TIME."

/user_details?userid=Iz199TFtx8Gc7SEuW0mzDg,Soo H.,"Gainesville, FL",5 star rating,Amazing place. Came there in late lunch times but still packed. Ordered a pho and two menus starting with Ban. The flavor of the soup was very deep and had a lot of meat inside. The soup wasn't the taste that I had when I stayed in Vietnam tbh but still very good. Ban's I ordered 27 and 31. BBQ was the best dish that  I had in the past whole month. All reasonable price.

/user_details?userid=8apKnC2iVfWnfB4cIgUBMw,Jason L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Ordered the special chicken noodle. What makes it special? The fact that the cow rolled over the chicken that crossed the road that ended up in my bowl of noodle soup. Slices of raw beef flank topped the bowl that featured pieces of chicken both large and small. To make this order of Pho Ga double special, was the fact that I got the one chicken gizzard, liver and heart. I know what you're thinking, ""how can one bowl of noodle soup contain so much awesome without exploding singing hot soup all over your tshirt"". Subsequent soup spatter did however end up on my shirt - that's only because I'm clumsy. The added offal added a rich and deeper flavour to the soup - it's not for everyone, just the ridiculously good-looking.Pho Tay Ho has been at this location for as long as I can remember, and as long as I can remember, the food has always tasted the same. Consistency doesn't seem to an issue for them as their formula for deliciousness cannot go wrong. Not only do they specialize in chicken pho, but subsequently all things chicken, various chicken dishes on the menu can be found. You can disagree, but like I said before, Pho is the ultimate blitz, there are so many variations that each place will surely be different from another and that's something I can guarantee. That's why you'd got to try them all before you find the one you like... like dating."

Florida my expectations were pretty much subterranean.The specialty of the house is the Chicken Pho (Pho Ga) and it actually is pretty darn special here.  I had all but given up ordering the chicken variety in most places as I end up with bowls of bullion buffeted by blanched bleached bundles of chicken meat formerly known as dark. The broth here is, for lack of a more colorful descriptor - real.  The Goi Ga is also not to be missed - a cool salad that is superb for a summer day.  Or sometime in the endless winter when your just in denial.  Surprisingly, yet highly recommended.DEAR MONTREAL YELP FRIENDS -  There IS excellent Vietnamese in Toronto - you just need to Yelp a few to avoid the many, many, many potential pitfalls."

By far the beef is the most popular, and has a lot of variations. But if you like Chicken noodle soup (who doesn't, especially with a cold?) then Pho Tay Ho is known in Montreal for the best Pho Ga (chicken). They don't use free range chicken like Pho Ga An Nam in San Jose, CA, but they make a good Pho Ga."

/user_details?userid=EJewKsWcWmGMxenz_q6DNg,J R.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"I don't know much about Vietnamese food, but I do know that we really enjoyed what we got here: a huge dish of grilled skewers of shrimp, chicken and beef over vermicelli with an abundance of bean sprouts, herbs, and lettuce (for wrap-making, we determined, after we'd all but demolished it), another huge dish of sauteed veggies over crispy fried noodles in a sweet, light sauce, and a bowl of juicy BBQ'ed pork. Between two reasonably hungry adults (and one not-so-hungry toddler), we still had a serving of leftovers to take home with us. Friendly service, if a bit cursory (mainly involving rushing by to grab your order sheet and confirm that you've chosen what you think you've chosen).

/user_details?userid=6IaRbGkX8GpdCamWKAJTTg,Alice Y.,"Scarborough, Canada",5 star rating,"When we read the adverts in the vietnamese montreal newspapers to seek out pho in montreal, it was a foreboding sign when we saw that restaurants were using ""chef from toronto"" as a marketing strategy....  we already had low expections since the realization that we might not find pho worthy of our acclimatized toronto-pho tastebuds. We initially wanted to try some of the famous pho restaurants in the chinatown area but were referred to pho tay ho by a banh mi shop owner. it's a little pho shop out of downtown but it was well worth the drive.The pho ga (chicken) broth is excellent. It rivals the best pho in toronto and albeit pricey compared to toronto pho, the bowl is steaming hot, generous portions of onions and cilantro, the meat is fresh, and the portions mighty.  It leaves such a lasting impression that sometimes I think another bowl would be worth the 8-hour trek to montreal."

/user_details?userid=Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,Brandon L.,"Las Vegas, NV",4 star rating,"Base on what other customers ordered while I was there, it seems that Tay Ho is specialized in Pho Ga` (chicken noodle soup) and it was pretty darn good. The broth was flavorful and the chicken meat was pretty good, almost tasted like free range chicken.The good surprise for me was the Goi Ga` ( chicken salad). Unlike many places that mixed their Goi Ga with too much sugar and cabbage, Tay Ho mixed their Goi Ga just like the way people in VietNam normally do. A little onion, a little salt and peper, little sugar, a little lemon juice, peanut, and a decent amount of rau ram (which has a lemon and coriander-cilantro aroma). Their Goi Ga is something you gotta try if you visit this restaurant.Highly recommend this place for Pho Ga and Goi Ga.On the side note, this place does not have parking at all and it's a pain to find parking on the street."
