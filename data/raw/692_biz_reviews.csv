I had anticipated the Bulgogi Kimbap to not be enough for a filling lunch, which explained why I got the two Entrees.The dumplings and edamame were decent, nothing out of the ordinary but satisfied my hunger as my lunchmates were waiting for their mains.The Bulgogi Kimbap on the other hand definitely stood out as they were surprisingly large! The serving was 9 pieces out of the roll and I would characterize them to be as large as sumomakis that you would get at any sushi chain. For $9 this was an outstanding surprise. Had I known this I might had skipped on either the dumplings of the edamame.Overall, a nice offering in what is becoming a crowded and competitive area of the Mile End especially when it comes to Korean restaurants. I'll be back to try the Bibimbap."

You should be ashamed of yourself. Seriously, wtf. We arrived an hour before closing and you proceeded to be rude and condescending. Word of advice: don't eat food prepared by people seeping negative energy."
