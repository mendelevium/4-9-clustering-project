There is space inside but I would definitely recommend the terrasse outside. Bernard street was closed when we went so the tables are able to be well spaced out. My only issue was if it were the rain the tables were not covered. Thankfully the clouds cleared up for us and we were able to enjoy our dinner outside.I love a restaurant that specializes in one thing. Some people were upset there was no pizza on the menu but there were enough options to please everyone (seafood lovers, meat lovers, vegetarians). They offer some cocktails and wine but the list was not very long. I ordered the sausage and rapini pasta and was very pleased and stuffed. Dessert looked great and I would have loved to taste the tiramisu but was way too full."
/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",3 star rating,Basic pasta honestly. I ordered spaghetti bolognese and it's nothing you couldn't make at home. It was still good and I was having dinner with my friend so it was a good time.Service was kind of slow but we weren't that many customers so the staff was low. I will definitely be back to try other things on their menu.

So tonight I came to try it.  Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations, maybe my expectations were to high. Let's start with the pros:*Very nice and attentive staff*Romana Salad was very good*Veal parmesan (not including the pasta that accompanied it) was very good, one of the best I have had.*Portions size is very generous*Price is reasonableCons:*The restaurant is very outdated, my first impression was it looked cheap.*Pomodoro sauce was too thick  (more like a paste rather than a sauce) and a bit sweet*A lot of fruit flies everywhere*The fruit de mare linguini dish with white wine sauce was tasteless.*The seafood was kinda dryOverall it was very average, I definitely had better."

Last night, we enjoyed a great meal with really excellent service - I had a delicious wild mushroom tagliatelle dish and my husband had an outstanding crab and bacon risotto. For dessert, we split a delectable tiramisu with coffee iced cream - YUM! We are very luck to live only a few blocks from Le Petit Italian and look forward to many more visits - especially once the temperatures warm up and the patio opens!"
/user_details?userid=ahDxPzmaQuSOQtQMvZryZw,Anthony B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This Italian restaurant is pretty good. I love their bolognese pasta. They give you a huuuuge bowl of it even if you get the petite size. They also have a mushroom pasta that's pretty good. But otherwise, I personally can't find much on the menu that appeals to me. They don't even have anything like Alfredo or classic Italian choices. It's all very 'fine italian' and a limited menu. The prices aren't bad though. I'll come in here for a super quick bowl of that bolognese sauce every time though. 2 minutes after ordering it lands on my table sometimes before the bread ever gets there. Service is therefore pretty good. For desert I've tried their pancotta with pepper. That was really strong pepper. That's like a really Italian fish that I'm not sure most people will like. The huge pepper kernels threw me off at the end of that dinner."

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"There is a certain timeless quality to Outremont. The nice residential townhouses, the mature tree lined streets, the old theatre, the many cafes with beautiful terraces to enjoy - this is a neighbourhood that, if I could afford, would love to live it. I don't really spend enough time on Bernard street as I love it so much. A few weeks ago, at my sister's recommendation, we went to Le Petit Italien, a restaurant I had gone by numerous times but never actually tried yet. As the name implies, Le Petit Italien is a old school Italian restaurant - here was hoping however that it would rise above the base level Italian and show me something more - because there is nothing quite as sad food-wise as an Italian restaurant that seems not to try. The food just seems lifeless in those cases.As this is an Outremont restaurant, the space is rather compressed and longer than it is wide. As such, Le Petit Italien needs to utilize the space efficiently and they do. A moon-shaped bar divides the interior dining area in two. The overall look is one of modern elements within a old space. I particularly loved their use of the exposed brick walls and tomato sauce cans as decor accents. Sadly the weather was not up to par for sitting outside so the beautiful terrasse was not available. Too bad.We started with 2 appetizers. First up, whipped ricotta with black pepper, thyme and grilled bread. Whipping the ricotta added a light and fluffy texture to the inherently creamy and rich cheese. The addition of pepper, thyme and olive oil brought some extra elements but nothing that took away from the ricotta itself. Spread on the grilled bread and enjoyed thoroughly.The other appetizer was the insalata prosciutto - prosciutto, arugula, red onions, parmesan and white balsamic vinegar. The first thing that hits you when you see this dish is that amount of prosciutto draped over the salad. As a lover of prosciutto, automatic winner for me already! The prosciutto was perfect, cut nice and thinly. The salad itself was nicely balanced but nothing special - the peppery arugula, the sweetness of the red onions, the rich parmesan and the acidic dressing all worked well together. Another solid dish.I got to try three different mains after that. First up, the risotto fruit di mare - shellfish stock, mussels, clams, scallops, shrimp, red pepper puree and fennel. I am not a huge risotto guy - I enjoy it but it is rarely something I will order myself. This one was pretty good - the seafood was plentiful and the addition of the shellfish stock brought a deeper seafood flavour to the dish. The risotto itself was creamy and the rice was perfectly cooked - always a concern when one deals with risotto.The second dish was the classic veal parmigiana served with pappardelle and pomodoro sauce. A large breaded veal cutlet covered in melted mozzarella, the veal was cooked well and still moist. The pasta choice of pappardelle and pomodoro was excellent and complimented the veal well. Another solid dish.The final main was the penne con anatra - duck confit ragu with bell peppers and green onions. The real star here was the duck ragu - deliciously rich and meaty. Everything else here was simply a platform on which the duck was presented. I honestly barely remember any hint of pepper or green onion but frankly the ragu was so good, I didn't even care whether the pasta was penne or a simple macaroni. Loved this plate - thankfully since it was what I ordered myself.For dessert, they had cannolis on the menu, so of course I had to have one - my addiction to them is too strong. Something about the combination of ricotta, orange zest and that crunchy shell gets me every time and thankfully I wasn't disappointed here. Not necessarily as fluffy as I expected but the cream was nice and rich - the orange zest brought a little acidic and chew that was noticeable. The outer shell itself was good as well. After i finished it, I wanted another one.... usually a good sign and further proof of my cannoli problem.Lastly, we had a trio of profiteroles with chocolate ganache. Excellent cool gelato, fluffy buns and a rich decadent chocolate ganache. I was happy I had the cannoli first because it ensured that I wouldn't eat most of this myself. A excellent way to finish the meal.Le Petit Italien was Italian cuisine done right which made me happy. It is not doing anything revolutionary menu-wise but everything we had was honest and well executed. A nice little evening in Outremont. The only true downside of the meal was not being able to sit on the terrasse but that just means I need to re-visit them again eventually.Cheers!"

/user_details?userid=2ZfhOYE8NKSxv8bXG5lDnQ,Oguz Cem C.,Turkey,3 star rating,"The food was average. I mean not too bad. However,  the staff is too rude  to people. With their little or no English, they cannot communicate with people. Also, the tipping is always a problem in this city. What if I did not like the service? Finally,  I wouldn't go to this restaurant again just because of the waitress' weird attitudes."
/user_details?userid=ivCy3H0uIAGGa4DFMG3Cyg,Nina S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"What can I say about this place.... It will remain in my memories forever. I got married there few months ago. The owner opened the place just for us on a Saturday morning... Everything was so personal and perfect that I still get compliments on the food and venue. Do not get me wrong: IT IS NOT A WEDDINGS VENUE. But for 35 invitees and a civil ceremony wth a minister it was PERFECT. I tell you this experience because they really care and get involved, even when the requests are atypical. I have been there many times for business meals, Christmas dinners, or just for a treat  with my husband or friends and it never disappoints me. The food is really good and certainly unexpensive (the most expensive meal is around $25). My favourites are the Penne con Anatra (pasta with duck) and Risotto with Porc and Scallops. They also serve half portions in case you are not too hungry or want to try different things fron the menu. These dishes are always available but they innovate everyday with the Table D Hote. They also sell gift certificates and host events for groups if you arrange them in advance with the manager. They serve wine and licours from many places around the world as well.The atmosphere is cute. It has the perfect balance between classy and familiar. I love the tomato sauce pots on the walls. Give it a shot, you will certainly enjoy it."

The atmosphere is always nice and cozy, and the food is always great. The caesar salad is a must, and the pasta dishes are offered in smaller portions, which girls usually really like... I have been there many times and have never been disappointed :)"

/user_details?userid=x-DJDSf5pRnP2q9pLm4iyQ,Agile R.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Cozy, nicely fitted out Italian restaurant in Outremont.  The menu features a long list of pasta options, and has a good selection of other Italian staples like risotto and antipasti.  The antipasto misto was especially noteable for a very tasty type of home-prepared paté.  The cannelloni was straightforward, and quite good.  The night I visited, the restaurant space was noisy, even though it was only half-full.  However, service was friendly and unobtrusive.  It is worth noting that many dishes are available in half-sized portions, and that the kitchen stays open until late.  A good option for Italian food in the neighbourhood."
/user_details?userid=8apKnC2iVfWnfB4cIgUBMw,Jason L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I had the linguine in cream sauce with spinach, pine nuts and green apples. Like in the movies where an exotic Italian man swoops in and woos a lady from her relatively mundane and boring boyfriend, this dish emasculated me and my manlihood as I wasn't able to finish it like a real man should. However, in my defense, I was given a whole cannelloni and I finished that, so, volume-wise, I did manage to eat the same amount... self-esteem crisis AVERTED. In other news, the apples added a nice crunch to the noodles with a hint of sweet and tart flavor."
/user_details?userid=BdBzXtp1yWntU_VqmG_XkQ,Mahsa Y.,"Brighton, United Kingdom",4 star rating,"This is a great restaurant near me, and I am sure it will be a part of the heavy rotation.  House-made pasta at reasonable prices.  The seafood pasta was excellent, the cannelloni was simple but good.  I can't say I loved the dessert options, but the figue tarte tatin was very creative.  Good atmosphere, excellent service and reasonably priced -- came out to $80 for two including drinks."
