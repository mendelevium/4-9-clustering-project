I guess it doesn't hurt that they already have several other locations. Nice big generous portions.Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm."
/user_details?userid=JwWYSaemJJR1-Sba-a8_7A,Miles C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Very good pho, especially for plateau. I have only tried the pho, not other things on the menu, but it is a tasty, balanced broth, which has nice little oil jewels from its well made stock. Compared to some over-salty, more processed-tasting broths nearby, I would say this is probably the best pho in Plateau area. The place is a bit cold / impersonal inside, and the service is lacking.. But the pho is what I like and what I will come back for."
/user_details?userid=lyY3aOmISGFcfXQhPusyGA,Maude C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Tried this place on a rainy day and it did the trick. We tried the spring rolls, specialty beef soup and the beef and veggie pho. All were very good and packed with flavour. Soups come with a side of bean sprouts and basil (no cilantro however). The service was prompt and polite and the food came out pretty quickly. Overall great experience."

We had the Pho and Bun Bo Hue, both had amazing depth in the broth. Possibly the best bun no hue in town. Authentic and no fuss. I would come back every week, seriously."
