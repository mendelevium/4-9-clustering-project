At the moment there is a limit of purchase of 2 per customers but trust me, that is enough. I went on their second day of being open and for the ramen hot dog and the Gamsung hotdog (mozzarella cheese deep fried with pieces of French fried potatoes on top). Both were delicious but my favourite was definitely the ramen, it was so crunchy. You order on the right hand side of the restaurant and then wait in the line on the left hand side to receive your food (pay attention to your number as they will call it out to let you in the restaurant to pick up). Once you pick up your order you have a choice of 8 sauces. My server put a bit too much so I say less is more when it comes to sauces. They have a menu on the side with their recommendations of sauce to put on which Kogo. You also don't want to overwhelm the Kogo with too much sauce because there's so much to taste already. I put spicy mayo, mayo, and honey mustard on both of my Kogos and it was too much. The sauces were good but it just got too much. If you want to put more than one sauce, ask the server to only put a little.My friend got the volcano with chill sauce and recommends that one. He also got the ramen hot dog with spicy mayo and he said it was a bad pairing, he thought the spicy mayo would've been good on another hot dog. I also got the pineapple juice and it was pretty good! A bit ordinary but good to pair with your meal. Prices are around 4.99-6.99 per Kogo so not cheap but they are loaded so it's worth it.Lines seem long but it goes by quickly."

They add glutinous rice into the batter which makes the dough so soft and chewy~ Yesterday, I finally got to try it out!Korean Rice Dog Rubric:- Crispiness - Chewy Dough - Cheese Pull These hotdogs were not only crispy on the outside but also chewy on the inside!!Everyone has been asking me if it was worth the wait and YES it was worth the wait!! The approximate waiting time is 40 minutes to 2 hours.Gamsung (Potato) Hotdog (R) ($4.99)Mozzarella Cheese Hotdog (L) ($4.99)"

You can chose so many toppings, from teriyaki sauce to spicy mayo, sugar, garlic butter and so many more! Only downside is the time you need to wait. Because it's a restaurant in high demand, there is a line outside than can go up to 2 hours!! I got lucky and only had to wait for 15 minutes."

Chung Chun Rice Dog is a brand that first started in North York, Ontario and it brings you the excitement of korean flavours with the nostalgia of pogos, now called korean pogos or ""kogos"" (how the trendy people call them). The crust is softer and chewier than your usual pogo since they use rice flour to make them instead of whole wheat flour. You start by choosing your filling (sausage, mozzarella stick, tteokbokki, potato crust, etc.) and then you have a variety of sauces to choose from to complete your order. It's pretty well managed, but since we're in a pandemic, only 1-2 customers are allowed at a time inside the store. Expect to wait at least 45 minutes from lining up to leaving with your food. I've read that some people waited 2h to get their order...  It's good and the exterior is crunchy. If you recently watched the hit korean drama ""Start-Up"" on Netflix, it's exactly what they ate on screen. It's still a street food, so if you don't want to wait outside in the cold for a hot dog on a stick, I suggest you come back in the spring when the hype has died down a bit. Nonetheless, if you happen to be in the area and you see no line, you should definitely check it out and try it at least once! I recommend the mozzarella, try to do the longest cheese pull."

They were huge and were crispy on the outside. You can mix and match your sauce on them. They price range is from 4-7$ but they're definitely worth the price considering how filling they are. The wait time is super long. There weren't that many people before us but we waited almost 2h before being able to order."

It was on my to try list since SGV days. This place is wild!! We arrived on a Tuesday late morning for an appointment to the dentist, and I thought heck, why not make it a boba and Korean pogo day. I swung by shuyi, then timed it so I could get to Chung chun before their opening time at 11:30. Well... guess what..? By 11:22 there was already a line (!!) and I was fifth. When I first parked around 11:00 I saw other ppl tentatively park and casually walk up to figure out whether or not to start lining up then. It's nuts!! The line grew like crazy by the time opening finally came and another line for pick up rapidly formed on the other side. Basically, wait in line, order, pay, go wait outside again (on the other side), and then go back inside to choose your sauces and pick up your dogs. It's a whole experience. Meanwhile, I loved that there was a random barber shop in between Chung chun ans uncle tetsu and occasionally a grumpy old guy would come out of the shop and stare curiously at this whole exhibition. All together took me about 30-35 mins from lining up to victoriously brandishing 2 korean pogos in my grasp. On to the food!! It was ok in my opinion. But maybe it was because they were cold by the time we ate them so that might have been our fault. Sauces were great and somehow the crunch was still there (esp for ramen one). The texture of the batter is more cakey than usual pogos, and lighter. It's a tad sweeter as well. The potatoes were soooo good!! It really was like a pogo combo with fries in a bite! Two was pleeenty for us two and it's a bit tedious to eat since the thing is humongous. I don't know if it's supposed to be like that but the middle is a bit too raw for the dough for my liking. And the potato hot dog is significantly worse quality than the one they used for their ramen one. Like thin and rubbery and little flavor. It's a bit on the pricey side, about $11 for two, but mostly it's that I had to keep feeding the parking meter to wait in line (which brought up the total to about $18). Was it good food? Sure! But maybe we'll come back once the frenzy of waiting in line is over."

/user_details?userid=iLIGDMatmuGPGELLFlPXdw,Jess M.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Always wanted to try this Korean street food staple! This is the only place to get these in Montreal. I highly recommend trying this place, if you're patient it's worth it. They were well organized which made the process enjoyable. They have a line to wait and place your order. And another line to wait for your order number to be called and pick up your Kogos! About a 20-30 minute wait. So be prepared to at least wait in line a while before you get your order. Ordered 4 different kinds; the volcano, original, potato and ramen.  Our favourites were the spicy volcano as it was juicy and crispy, also the ramen for its extra crunch! I didn't know that when you pick up your order there are many sauces and spices you can top your kogos with. So keep that in mind! They had ketchup, spicy mayo, bbq, teriyaki, mustard, Parmesan cheese etc..."
