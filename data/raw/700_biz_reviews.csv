The bun is always soft and fresh, the chicken is tender and not overcooked, and the sauce is what makes it sooo good. I could dip everything in their sauce! I enjoyed their poutine as well, the gravy was pretty good with a good ratio of cheese curds. The custard donuts were alright, but I would get the natas instead.I'm rating them 4 out of 5 because I find the amount of meat in the sandwich tends to vary. We sometimes get one packed with meat and the most recent delivery was a bit lacking unfortunately."
/user_details?userid=t5x15lo8kicUKnyUeQkaCA,François L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"It took me until now to finally try this place out, although I live just around the corner. The M&M-topped natas on display always put me off. One does not top natas with junk, ok? That's heresy. But today, in one of those oh-why-not moments, I decided to try their sandwich (chicken, chorizo and são jorge cheese). It was OK, but nothing special. The ""spicy"" sauce, which is only spicy if you want to believe it, was kind of bland. the chicken was rather dry, the chorizo was conceptual, and the cheese is basically fromage en grain with a funny accent. The salad that comes with it for an extra $1.50 (otherwise you can have fries for free, but there's no sandwich-only option) was fresh and good, but even grandpa can wash lettuce and put it in a box. I didn't feel full, but my wallet felt empty (yes, all that could be yours for only $17.75 after tax). In the area, Monteiro offers a much better deal, with a more generous, more delicious sandwich for nearly half the price."

Lots of people picking up take out orders. Great for families with young kids, the picnic style tables are fun. I went with my buddy, and we ordered 2 mains and 2 sides...way too much food. I had the Grill Cheese  chicken, and my friend had on of the bafana sandwiches that had everything in it. For sides I ordered the chorizo meatball poutine. It sounded really good, but the chorizo meatballs were a little tough. The winner plate had to be the chicken, chorizo Poutine. This plate could feed 2, don't miss it."
/user_details?userid=bj2_KPCKpQdNlN8hlHSxdg,Cat D.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Absolutely no for me. Went here about a month ago and I'm still smarting from the experience! I had this place on my radar since I read of its opening and that it's from tbe owner of Poule Mouillée, which is my favorite Portuguese chicken spot by far. I saw the menu online and noticed that they had several items that were not on offer at Poule (more sandwich options, crazy nata flavor combos etc). I did also notice that the prices were higher than that of Poule and also that there was no mention on the menu of the taxes being included in the price (as is the case at Poule Mouillée). I still figured I'd make it up there one day, even if it was further out than I usually venture. Well, the day came this January when we were hankering for that salty, juicy, smokey chicken and Poule was down and out due to a fire. So we made the trek near to Jarry park. First observation was that the location seems odd to me. It's one or two streets in off the main road, and is in a totally residential area. That makes parking easy, but it's definitely not a destination spot in terms of dining or things to do. The resto seems a bit out of place with its bright white and blue theme in a sea of brown brick, rather dull buildings. Place is basically self-serve (so yeah, don't ask me for a tip on your Interac machine) and self cleanup with those carts a la Ikea for you to slide your tray into once finished. So the more spiffy interior (which, I admit, is super cute and nice) is a bit lost on me, since the  service is super casual and kinda non-existent. Cashier was not very helpful in recommending items from the menu.The shockers: the prices and subpar food! First, the prices don't include taxes and are significantly higher than the mother ship, Poule. For example, their half chicken plate with fries and salad (called Le Maria du Ciel) is $15.95 plus tax. That same plate (with much better chicken) is now (albeit, after several price increases from the original $10) $13, tax included. Why, oh why, are they asking approx $5.50 more for the ""same"" item in the middle of bumF*** nowhere (no offense to anyone living there, but it's not an area I would consider a destination of its own like the neighborhood where Poule is located). I'm upset about this because, clearly, the owner picked this area to put his Cantine due to lower rental prices, yet he's charging approx 40% more for his food?? It's an insult to the people who live there, who, IMO, generally don't have the same financial means as the overall population in the Plateau, and who now have to deal with foodies and hipsters (myself included here as a foodie) taking up the free parking spots. Portuguese chicken, while amazing, is not gourmet chichi poupou food, so Emilia's price points seem a bit removed from reality IMO.I can only assume the owner kept his prices lower in the Plateau at Poule due to the competition from the original source of Portuguese chicken, Romados, which is in close proximity.Now to the last and most egregious point: the chicken sucked! On both my chicken sandwich and on the chicken poutine, the chicken was COLD and not fresh. I couldn't believe I was actually eating in a place related to Poule and paying significantly more for it lol. I should have realized something was off when I first entered and didn't smell even a whiff of chicken from the semi-open kitchen. I'm almost under the assumption the chicken is grilled elsewhere and simply reheated. As well, for the poutine, the gravy was different and just not as tasty as that of Poule Mouillée. The poutine, which is usually a big hit, was really just not good. My dining companion didn't even bother to finish it, which is unheard of generally lol.And ok, another mention here of the price to quantity and quality ratio: Since I wasn't very hungry, I ordered the chicken sandwich, which automatically comes with fries OR salad (no chance of just getting the sandwich alone like at Poule Mouillée, which is $7). This sandwich combo is $12.95 plus tax. I figured, ok, must be a big sandwich. Well, yeah, no. It's the same $7 sandwich as Poule, the round palm-sized one, and to add insult, cold chicken inside this one, with an uninspired, small cup of salad on the side. So $15 for that. Those are Old Montreal prices people. In fact, this place gives me exactly that vibe. A tourist trap perfectly suited to Old Montreal, which otherwise wouldn't survive elsewhere in the city. I have never predicted the demise of an establishment before this, but I'll do so now: once the novelty of this place wears off (I mean, do we really need to mess with a nata and add Oreos to it people??), I don't see how this place will stay in business. Even if I had never tasted the chicken from Poule (and the less perfect but still very good, Romados) and didn't know any better, I would not return to Cantine Emilia, due to the blah chicken and ridiculous price point for such basic food. As you can see, I take my chicken to heart :)"

Given that it was our first time there, the girl at the counter made some suggestions (we didn't ask for the help but she was friendly and looking out for us!). We ordered the Tio Antonio which includes two sides and two quarter chicken legs. The chicken was amazing; it was flavourful and moist and just a bit spicy. The house piri piri was so tasty I was dipping everything in it! I love Portuguese chicken and am excited to have this new addition in the area."

The menu was only in French. I asked the girl at the counter if she had an English menu I could look at but she said ""no."" So, I walked away and ordered from one of the other restaurants that had a bilingual menu. I don't know how Emilia's hopes to stay in business in downtown Montreal without a bilingual menu. I literally have no idea what kind of food it sells. (All I saw behind the counter were tarts.)"

They were all pretty great portions and everything from the chorizo to the fries was amazing. The inside of the place was very modern and pretty empty, since people just take it to go. Definitely will come back to try other things!"
