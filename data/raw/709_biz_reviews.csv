But as soon as we stepped in the door we were warmly greeted by the owner himself who explained to us the concept and showed us more detailed pictures of the menu.As a vegetarian I highly recommend this place since most of the items are meat free, which you have the option to add on for a small fee to your pizza, pasta ... etcAfter trying many 5$ restos ( Warehouse, Cinko, Mezcal, Pot Masson) one thing me and my bf were expecting was small portions. Therefore we decided to order 4 plates to share, a pizza followed by the blue cheese dressing iceberg salad, then the gouda spinach dip, finally to end with their poutine (w homemade sauce). The portions were surprisingly generous so much that by the time the spinach dip arrived I was already so full! Nevertheless we managed to finish all the plates while sipping on a pitcher of raspberry mojito (which was very good & fair priced).Everything was so good no doubts about it, this 5$ resto has definitely stepped the game up. The only thing i would say is that the fries on the poutine were a bit bland however the sauce was on point.The service was friendly yet professional and the music was great! ( Dj on a Thursday night? Hell yeah!) I definitely recommend this place & forsure will come back to try their extensive choices of pizza and pasta!P.s. The music can get quite loud since it is a resto/bar therefore don't sit too close to the speakers if you want to hear yourself talk."

My waitress seemed kind of annoyed that i didn't speak French, which is unfortunate. I also ordered a pizza that came out wrong and she literally never came back until it was time to pay after i sent it back to be fixed. A little annoying. Ask for an English menu, otherwise it'll be hard to order if you you don't speak French. It was cool to be able to order food for less than $6 each! The French onion soup? 10/10. I loved it. Could order again and again. The veggie pizza (not pictured) 7/10. Le pimp drink? 8/10. Seltzer water? Also 10/10. Idk why i enjoyed that so much but i thought i should mention it. Also! If you have the opportunity to go on your birthday? Do it. It's a fun little surprise. I went when there was at least 10 birthday celebrations, which killed the excitement a bit, but still cute."

The concept to this restaurant is super cool because most things on the menu are 5.95 wIth a couple of exceptions for extras. This means I hat you can get a by bunch of different items without breaking your wallets. The restaurant itself has a really cool interior with a swing that you take a picture I front of and lots of seating with log tables and high chairs. When it came to food theRe were so many options it was hard to choose so I'm sure you can come here multiple times and find something new to try every time. We decided to go with fried pickles, spinach dip, pulled pork tacos and a white mushroom pizza all to share . The plate sizes are perfect for two people so we really got to have a good taste of everything. The star dish was definitely the spinach dip and the fried pickles the other two dishes fell a little flatt  because  when we revived them they were cold or to oily. We finished off with a piece red velvet cake Wicca was silky and creamy and really hot the spot. Do yourselves a favour and recover from spending money on holidays and come here and have a great night for a great price !"
/user_details?userid=X-_KbWOstBeSLw6rm9S56Q,Narendgie M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Cozy and charming. Have you ever experienced the warehouse? Where everything on the menu is $5? Well Grozépa is a restaurant with the same concept. The difference is that that food there is more tasty and with a lot of flavour. I didn't have time to take pictures because we were hungry (lol) however I didn't regret the trip there. It was worth it.
/user_details?userid=zbpP28M6g0YHaaIJ6ZP2Xg,Elise B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"It doesn't get better than a $5 menu am I right?Grozépa is a new resto/bar in Rosemont, offering a vast selection of dishes for just $5, with a few items for just a few more dollars. They also have a very extensive cocktails and drinks list, which is sure to please everyone.Tried it out last night (Friday night) and as the evening progressed, the place got more and more packed and the ambiance became more club-like with the DJ. The highlights of what I ordered were: the ravioli à la gigi (rosé sauce with mushrooms and pancetta) and the Grozépa poutine (loved the recipe for their homemade poutine sauce). I also really liked the Cesar salad, the gratinée onion soup, the warm spinach and smoked gouda dip and the cinnamon doughnuts with Nutella sauce. I highly recommend Grozépa for a date night or a night out with friends!For my full review and more photos, check out my blog: Turquoise Blog (link in bio!)"

/user_details?userid=4qHIyHG9Mr0TcCdfXHqalg,Karina A.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,We were a group of 4 on Wednesday night and the service was really good even with the place being so packed. We loved the live cuban music and the food (everything is 5$ and the portions are generous) for sure we will be coming back again.

I want there a few times with my girlfriends and we always have a blast! Their food is quite good considering the low prices. And oh lord, their Gouda spinach dip. Just order it. Trust me, a complete stranger from the internet, and you won't regret it!"
