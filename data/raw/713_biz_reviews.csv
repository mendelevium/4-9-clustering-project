/user_details?userid=IMXFa0HpnEgekZTCeUlRGA,Amy C.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"I was pleasantly surprised by this place! First, I had no idea what Peruvian food was so I took a shot in the dark when making a reservation. This is a tapas restaurant so all the dishes are tasting size to share. We were 4 people and ordered 11 plates altogether and walked out pretty full. Each dish is between $10-15 ish so it didn't break the bank. The menu is one page only (which I love) and every single one of the dishes we tried was SO delicious! Peruvian turns out to be South American with a flare of Japanese influence. The Bao buns were my favourite. But the ceviche, calamari, and yucca fries were also really great. Plate presentations were very nice as well.The restaurant is pretty small with about 12 or so tables so reservation suggested. Since it was Friday night, it was pretty full and music was louder than I would have liked, but didn't stop us from enjoying the dinner, each other's company and good conversation. The cocktails that we tried were a little sweet but nice beer selection. We didn't look at the wine list. The decor is nice and the service was pleasant. I will 100% be coming back here to try the rest of the menu! Highly recommend!!"
/user_details?userid=xSb2qnoa2BxPZZFS9XR3qg,Valérie P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,*I debated between a 3 and 4 for this one. Consider this a 3.5*Decided to try this spot as it's close to home. I would call this a Peruvian tapas fusion cuisine restaurant. The place is about 35 seats plus de bar so make sure you get a reservation. The owner told me they have been in business for a year and half. We shared the following:PHANtastic cocktailWhite wine from SpainPortobellos and potatoes empanadasPancetta BaoOctopusTuna tatakiPork shoulderThe cocktail was good and refreshing but a bit pricy (we chose an extra to switch gin from Beefeater to Hendrix).Our favourite dishes were the Bao buns (I have never seen some this big! ) and the tuna tataki. Our least favourite were the octopus because it was unfortunately a bit overcooked and the pork because the sauce reminded me of cheap viet skewers. The biggest downside is their wine list. Nothing amazing.Overall I would recommend and will return to this place :)

/user_details?userid=MjqfukTWimz3D0w-cp5fDg,Kathy P.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This should be read as a 2.5 stars in my opinion.Was curious about what Peruvian fusion would be like... Honestly, a bit disappointed.Made it on time for the 5 à 7 special. With the purchase of a cocktail/wine, some tapas are 5$ instead of their original price. First, the cocktails description seemed really appealing. We were four and only one drink was good. The Phantastic tasted like water + gin. The Pikeos kola's rhum covered everything else in the cocktail. However, the Senor Steve was pretty amazing!Food wise. It was ok. We had the fried chicken, duck heart, Peruvian sausage, peruvian fries, scallops, calamari, the slider and ceviche. Most of the dish come with the same spices and sauce, so at the end, you feel overwhelmed with the same taste. Also, I feel like the same ingredients are used in all dishes...more precisely sweet potatoes. I can tell you that after the meal, you won't want sweet potatoes anymore.The ceviche is probably the best dish out of all. It was very refreshing and tasted different from the others. The gratin scallops were good, but nothing really special about it. The rest were were okay. The portions are not big, so 3 to 4 dishes were suggested per person by the waitress. We ordered 2 dishes per person and it was plenty enough. The food was really heavy and it was hard for us to even finish what we ordered.We might have ordered the wrong dishes, but I would not go back."
/user_details?userid=eIFR6CeI7amzlqtzzUR8JQ,Sara A.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Pikeos offers the best ceviche we've tried so far. The flavours are well balanced. We had a crush on the maple syrup and mustard sauce served on the fresh red tuna Best Peruvian food experience. We strongly recommend this place. Thanks to the team for the great food and service The price for ceviche (16$)The price for Tuna Tiradito (18$)
/user_details?userid=wJF-NdtxYCk_SrwG4UUL9Q,Stephanie L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I was brought here by a Peruvian person, so that was the first good sign that the food was probably good! And it was true, the food was very good and authentic Peruvian, according to my Peruvian friend. I, of course, had to try the ceviche, it was made with white fish and large pieces of corn, tasted very fresh and healthy. It was perfect for the hot day. They also offered other fusion dishes, such as the chorizo mac and cheese. I wasn't inclined to order this, despite being curious, because I was feeling something more authentic. Someone ordered it anyways and we shared it and it was really really amazing. You could really taste the exotic flavours. They also had a great selection of drinks, including Peruvian alcohol and beers. I had a mango cocktail, which wasn't too strong, but very refreshing. I recommend this place to anyone looking for something new!"

Their food was great too, don't expect heavy meal since this is basically bar and tapas. We had a seafood platter which only contain calamari, four prawns, couple mussels and spinach all deep fried (expect the spinach) and they tasted great! The only downside was it took almost an hour to prepare our meal. Try their signature drink, totally worth it! If I ever visit Montréal, will definitely come again. PS: they need to fix the entrance door"
