They keep their food in a refrigerated shelf and you can grab whatever you want. There's a good variety of seafood, vegetables, and other assorted hot pot ingredients. If you want meat, you'll have to ask the waiter/waitress but it's no problem and is included in your all you can eat meal. They have juice (from powder I believe) and a small selection of desserts as well. Overall the best price and quality for all you can eat hot pot in Montreal in my opinion! Just a little inconvenient in terms of location, but it's worth the trek out!"
/user_details?userid=d9HEG7j_BBpyONGMaHsAJg,Vana C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I absolutely love this place! My sister and I are practically here ever week. Food: great varieties, lotsa of vegetables and protein option. I love there lamb! Perfectly sliced and not gamey tasting. I wish they had more fish options. Shrimps, muscles etc., they also have drinks, refills included, minimal dessert options, but they have ice-cream:) Broth: Mongolian spicy  broth, Tum yum, satay or regular. I've had them all but the tum yum really hit the spot for me! Lots of flavours and just perfect amount of hit.Dipping sauce: your typical, hot chilli oil, sesame oil, chopped herbs, chopped garlics, sliced chillies, peanut sauce etc., I'm sure you can come up with a sauce you'll like! Sooo tastyService: Meh, nothing spectacular. They tend to forget you. You'll be waiting if you don't speak up to get more meats or refill your pot. The lady is very nice though. Price: ~$29.99 pp for dinners. However, they have great deals. Tuesday(dinner), sat&sun(lunch) its always 2 for 1 days. I'm always happy  leaving eating well on those days.."

They have different pots for you to choose. I went to this place with my parents and my friends several times. All good. Except beer is sold separately. But they have cold drink for unlimited refill. Compare to the little mongols sheep at chinatown. I prefer this one. You can take whatever you want by yourself. Unlike chinatown you can to fill up a paper every time.The place is very cool and fresh cold. It helps you to eat hot pot. Overall, really nice."

Mongolian hotpot has landed north of Montreal!Don't be fooled by the location the decore is much nicer inside. A dozen tables makes the main dining area with some larger to accomodate 8-12 patrons and private room in the back. This is the classic hotpot with individual cooktops and 2 refrigerated counters to indulge from. The all-you-can-eat is $20 with good condiments, meat, fish and veggies to choose from. On any given day the soup base may vary but expect regular, spicy, satay and tom yum on hand.Bring an appetite or two."
/user_details?userid=CKyP9R4haM5ANO-dwBwkbw,Ruby D.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"This is a Vietnamese hotpot place. You can tell by the type of broth they offer (none of the crazy Sichuan style spicy flavor).  I got the tom-yum broth and it was close to sweet and sour soup, so yummy. Veggies, seafood, water, dessert, and dipping sauce (unlimited) are DYI.  Table service is for ordering meat (also unlimited) but they only offer beef and lamb. The lamb was a lot more tender and fatter than the beef. I was very pleased with the range and freshness of the veggies that were offered: water spinach, enoki mushroom, tofu sheet, etc.  $21 for all of these is a fantastic value!"

But beware, you get what you pay for. It's hard to re-order beef and lamb. When i went, there were only 2 kinds of drink, water or lime juice, 1 kind of ice cream, lots of veggies, pork heart and pork liver, fish and noodles. There was 1 waiter/busboy for the whole restaurant. The AC was great, got no complaints on that."

/user_details?userid=As5VkzdDmGQzQTVWhw4t5Q,Kimberly M.,"Port Coquitlam, Canada",3 star rating,"This is pretty good but not the best hot pot in the city. Hot pots are all about the broth and flavors. Most times the broths here are very basic and not full of flavor like others Ive had. They also dont have much variety with food. I like the idea of going to pick out your own food, but there isnt much to choose from and what's there isnt labelled so you have no idea what you may or may not want. Ive been here twice and left satisfied, but Id recommend little sheep in chinatown over this any day."
