Enough to give a straight up 5 for them; good flavor, good quality, not skimpy and though the wrappers were a bit too al dente it worked with the large size and weren't too chewy.I was recommended the ones I got by the nice girl taking care of takeout and serving. The filling choice that is.They also have a focused menu of appetizers and noodle dishes (which looked legit), to go along with dumping.The decor is simple black tables and chairs, a bathroom and little counter with the chef behind a mini wall. No frills, but clean and neat enough. Great location too and the corner of two main city streets.Seems you can get the spicy dipping sauce in jars to go as well. Must go back alone or with a guest to try more dishes."

OK, being a lemming and following the  crowd isn't really my thing so I stopped in for lunch today. Sure I was the only one there, but I have no idea why after eating there. The decor is simple, black walls, some red accents, maybe a dozen tables. New age Chinese tunes playing in the back ground set a cool vibe.I chose the fried chicken app and the  beef noodle soup. The chicken was delicious, maybe a little greasy, but worth checking out. The soup was the best example of fresh noodle soup that I've tried to date. The noodles were soft and smooth, the broth rich and flavourful, and the chunks of beef were brisket without the usual tendons and fat normally used in this dish. I added a little chilli sauce to spice it up. I also had a cup of the black tea which was prepared fresh and still steeping at the table. This place will find a regular spot in my lunch rotation!"

I don't know about their dumplings ( as I have not tried it yet), but they do a very good Beef noodle soup. It is definitely worth trying as the broth is somewhat sweet rich flavour. But the best discovery for me was their fried chicken, I can say that it was one of the best piece of fried chicken I have ever tried in Montreal. It's juicy, perfectly cooked and oh so full of flavour! Go ahead and try this little gem, highly recommend!"
