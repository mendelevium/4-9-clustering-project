I'm from the US and accustomed to eating authentic Phö from my Vietnamese friends and also Vietnamese restaurants.  I was delighted to find a place in Montreal!I was greeted by kind and warm customer service and I chose where I sat upon walking in. I received a cold glass of water and ordered the Imperial Rolls as my appetizer. they were beyond delicious! they were perfectly crisp , in addition to the sweet and savory dipping sauce that made each and every bite taste supreme!For my main course, I ordered Phö with well done flank steak! I ordered the size large. When it came out I could see the steam rising! and I received my condiments and essential eating utensils (spoon, chopsticks) I fell in love the moment I tasted it!!! The broth was cooked perfectly and the beef was as well! I ate the entire bowl of soup and noodles down to the last drop. I was beyond satisfied! Let's just say that you cannot go wrong here! the food is delicious and the service is immaculate! Tip: You pay the register! Check it out and enjoy! cheers!"
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"After a long and late night out with the boys, we were in desperate need of food, any food. Someone came up with the brilliant idea to get pho so we decided to try Pho Do Thi. It's located in between Soupesoup and Restaurant Le Tpe Food.We dropped in on a Saturday (around 12:45pm). Lucky, there's tons of room so we had no trouble grabbing three seperate tables for our group. Service is slow and oddly, they don't have chopsticks or spoons on the table. You have to ask for them.The menu is a concise two pages: appetizers, pho and lunch express options.- Pho dac biet (S1) ($11.50 large) - rare beef, well done flank, soft tendon, beef balls and tripe. Broth had good flavour and depth. I must have been starving because I devoured the noodles and could have ate another bundle. - Bun bo hue (S7) ($12.00 large) - spicy beef noodle soup. One buddy at our table decided to try their BBH. I didn't have a taste but it looked good.Solid Vietnamese spot. Stick to the pho options."
/user_details?userid=vCUeFAY774VtmpszX9hyGA,Nataly N.,"San Francisco, CA",4 star rating,"This is a great place for reasonably-priced Vietnamese/Asian fusion food near the UQAM campus, and probably one of the better options overall for Vietnamese food in this neighborhood. The service was friendly, and we did not have to wait long for a table without a reservation. The wonton soup was a great starter. It came with light broth, scallions, and wontons filled with a good amount of pork. The crispy spring rolls (Imperial rolls) were not wrapped with typical rice shells. (I believe they used thin egg roll shells) They were a bit oily, but they were very neatly wrapped, crispy, and overall pretty tasty. As my entrée, I got a mixed grill plate, which came with a good amount of grilled chicken, shrimp, and beef over rice, along with another spring roll. It was very flavorful and well cooked. While I haven't tried the pho and none of the items were absolutely mind-blowing, everything was solid and it's definitely a place I would keep in mind for future visits to Montréal."

Both dishes were good but I've had better. Recommend trying..I also saw their general tao chicken dish, looked good but not sure how it tasted. Also a little pricier than what I am used to for Vietnamese food. Inside was very nice and clean."
/user_details?userid=CAgLPOjaWka_DSU2U6k8SA,Shuang W.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"We were walking on st denis and we were freezin cuz of the weather, then we saw this and we decided to just give it a try! Omg wisest choice ever! It is extremely busy we had to wait for around 25 minutes to get seated, it is really romantic and intimate in the restaurant, which is super different from other pho places. We got large pho and I added grilled chicken on the top too, it is a huge bowl we both couldn't finish it, but the beef was so fresh, the beef ball was amazing and chewy and the soup is just insanely good. It easily beats any pho places I have tried in Ontario and I will miss this place for sure."
/user_details?userid=6yTV_iirY6r21EeTRGPGqA,Jolie C.V. H.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"So I've been on a Vietnamese food kick for the last three days. I was weary about this place as soon as I sat down and saw that there was not a pair of chopsticks in sight. Even the people eating pho were using forks.  WTH?Service was quick and no nonsense. When you're done with your meal, go to the counter to pay.  I forgot I was in the French side of town so my not understanding what the waitress was saying in English seemed to annoy her. I know, I know...I should be learning French. One day, people!  I enjoyed the people watching very much today. My favorite was the man with a red bamboo fan, fanning himself at the table. It WAS a fairly warm day.  Or was it the combination of the heat and eating pho?  Does he always carry a fan with him or was it for pho?  Regardless, it matched his outfit so bravo to him for accessorizing well. Despite my suspicion, I was very happy with what I ordered. Bun with chicken, shrimp skewers and egg roll. Everyone 's food looked amazing though. Definitely returning so I can try the bird's nest noodles. Maybe bring my own chopsticks?"

The spring rolls were huge and had whole shrimp and then chicken on top!The pho and the wonton soup were excellent as well!I usually don't like the peanut sauce, but we were eating it (mixed with hot sauce) with our forks and not even waiting for the food!The staff is quiet but extremely friendly. If you are in the area, I definitely recommend!Also...bring your own alcohol(not just wine...anything!). We are from Alberta so we never heard of this before, but the table beside is sitting with an open case of beer on their table! Excellent!"
/user_details?userid=SisbjmC3RGETDw4dzLDCYw,Diana K.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I came here with a friend for lunch. At first I was skeptical because their menu seemed limited from what I'm normally used to at Vietnamese Restaurants. I ordered the lunch special, beef and shrimp skewers with imperial roll on top of vermicelli. The presentation was okay, and I thought that the portion size was smaller than usual.Every aspect of the dish was very well seasoned and marinated. Even with different flavours, all the elements mixed together fit perfectly. I was also wrong about their portion size, it's the perfect amount for lunch.I definitely will be back and try other stuff on the menu!"

It was perfect for me. My boyfriend had chicken curry. He finished it all. The food was cooked right and also it was quick service. The vegetables were very fresh and you could taste this.
/user_details?userid=HVGfPIZ-w4f0_CfejUGhxg,Joyce N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Always down for some viet cuisine during my break! I had the vermicelli + grilled chicken + spring roll. The vegetable soup as an appetizer was quite delicious, and the prices are very decent. Will definitely go back."
/user_details?userid=UGcHijKtjL1RigTgNjD8GA,Dave P.,"Amsterdam-Centrum, Amsterdam, The Netherlands",5 star rating,"Very nice, clean restaurant with a good menu.  The sign on the building doesn't do justice to the comfortable interior.  Service was very quick and efficient.  We had a couple of bowls of soup, which arrived quickly and steaming and were reasonably priced.  Definitely worth the half block walk from St Catherine St."
/user_details?userid=0Dla1E8mxre8BJzJJYo8BA,Gerson R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Each ingredient in their Tonkinese soup is very rich in flavor.Especially the broth.The recipe itself is, in my opinion, the best one compared to their competition. The staff are super friendly and accommodating, always in a good mood.I recommend this establishment for any occasion!"
/user_details?userid=oZj_7BdzlDipvDPMDqBHng,Danielle N.,"Regina, Canada",5 star rating,Excellent pho!  Had the rare beef and added some hot sauce.  Such great flavours!  Service was very speedy and friendly.  My mom had the chicken with mushroom peanut sauce and also enjoyed her meal.  Very good prices for what you get as well.

/user_details?userid=XmD-cek-O0iO6_RnktNiIw,C H.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"This placed was packed on a Thursday night with a combination of tourists, students, and a few locals. They were able to accommodate a large party without issues. We ordered a combination of pho (noodle soups) as well as their grilled meats. The pho was very good, easily able to hold its own compared to those in Los Angeles and New York. The grilled pork and beef were a tad too sweet for my taste.  Service was friendly but a little slow, perhaps due to the large dinner crowd. All in all, a fine choice."
