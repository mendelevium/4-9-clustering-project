This is a Door Dash, Covid-19 delivery review of this restaurant. They offer a simple menu on Door Dash, but usually that means they're specialized in a group of dishes. I was not disappointed when I ordered the 2-meat barbecue plate. At $13.99, it was a bit expensive but is reasonable (considering these third party delivery apps charge extra on restaurants). It was full of delicious, perfectly cooked roast pork and barbecue duck. The meats were super tender and flavourful, and honestly it's enough to feed at least two people for lunch. We also ordered a side of pickled veggies (Daikon radish and carrot), to add a bit of freshness to our meal. The delivery arrived fairly quickly and the food was also pretty warm when it arrived. Overall, I can't wait to go into the actual restaurant to pick up a meal there! I also noticed on their menu, but you can order whole roasted pigs which is awesome for large parties!"
/user_details?userid=bUPeHBFEINhqiKj9-k4-zA,Charles N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Siu mei (烧味) is a Cantonese term for roasted meats on spits over an open wood fire or large burning oven that can usually be found a Montreal Chinatown restaurant window, made to take-out as is or offered as a complete meal in a box, with the meats and laid on top of white rice with some veggies. Traditional dishes such as roast duck, roast pork, crispy pork belly tend to be coated with a marinade, usually honey or maltose sugar, before being fully cooked, that provides different flavor profiles and diversity of textures make it exciting to eat!A friend of mine @shutupandeat recommended another spot @dakhingbbq located in Côte-des-Neiges, where the excellent roast master takes pride to prepare food in a way they would serve to their own children, parents and family... well let me tell you, the following glistening dishes quickly found their way to our home and then promptly into our bellies!Char siu (叉烧): fundamentally pork pork loin, belly, or shoulder, distinguished by its signature dark red hue, is marinated in a mixture of honey, five-spice powder, red fermented bean curd, dark soy sauce, hoisin sauce, and sometimes rice wine. The name refers to the cooking method where char means fork in Cantonese, and siu means to burn or roast.Siu yuk (烧肉) or crispy roasted pork, after being seasoned, the entire pig is roasted in a furnace at high temperature, which leaves a crispy skin with a gorgeous golden hue and a juicy, tender meat. The key to this dish is the skin, which is poked with tiny holes, to allow the crackling to happen, and covered with coarse salt before the meat is roasted.Siu ngaap (烧鸭) or roasted duck is first soaked in marinade of star anise, peppercorns, green shallots, ginger, cassia buds, cloves, and salt. The exterior is rubbed with a vinegar and maltose sugar coating, to gives its signature sweet taste. The bird is then pumped with air, poached, and then finally roasted at high temperature to allow the skin to be slightly crispy, while the meat remains tender and juicy.There are many more items on the menu to try and well 'tis the season to give, so I will drop some off to our friends and family - hope you do to!"
/user_details?userid=fbRdDZciw4Y8pgujgbwEMg,Karen L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Amazing, authentic HK style barbecued meats.And affordable too! Two meals off Uber came to $23.28. The weird thing is that you are required to do a $1 add-on for a soft drink? So factor in an additional $1 for their rice combos. We tried the duck and the siu yuk. The crispy siu yuk skin was perfect! And the duck was very flavourful. I particularly loved the duck sauce that came with the duck combo and drenched my rice with it! Excited to order more from this place in the future!"
/user_details?userid=4nQ7MOkbc5u-DYUOgjiDsg,Anh N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"So... after reading so many good reviews on this place, I have decided that for my first 2021 meals, this is the place I needed to get my food from. Today, January 1st 2021, I hoped in my car, drove 45 minutes and ordered way too much food for my husband and I. It was for lunchtime. They were barely into their first out of opening that they sold nearly all the roasted pork. Not to worry, another one was on the way. They had a long table full of orders waiting to be picked up. It was non stop! Ok ordered a whole bbq duck, a 2 meats (char siu and Chinese sausage) lunch combo, some roasted pork and two sticky rice. EVERYTHING was very good! The pork crackling was crunchy and the duck is so juicy!  The only con that I would put out is that I had a lot of solid pieces of fat with the roasted pork order. Service is great! They are super nice! So 4.75 stars is what I am giving this place."
/user_details?userid=KdL6xS4ewQ0-6kr_mapgLg,V. H.,"Seattle, WA",5 star rating,"Eating here will basically ruin you from eating any form of BBQ duck or pork anywhere else in the world. This is a real compliment considering having eaten Chinese food on 4 continents and being raised on Cantonese food for decades. Dak Hing's bbq is so good, their previous landlord (a Chinese supermarket that shall remain unnamed) refused to let them establish their own brand for fear of losing their rep for takeout food.This boss here is a smart lady with amazing roasting skills. Support her and keep this little place alive!"
/user_details?userid=8Y0IKfcFe9MHMTlppzbIUQ,Michael B.,"Sunnyvale, CA",5 star rating,"Without a doubt, the BEST Cantonese-style BBQ this side of Hong Kong!Located near the Montreal Jewish General Hospitals, this is one tiny joint that serves up all your favorite comfort yummies, from BBQ pork, roast pork, roast ducks, roast chickens hanging in those traditional glass showcase windows. The best deal is: 2 or 3-combinations of ANY of the above-mentioned BBQ items for $10 -12, & the portion is absolutely H-U-G-E!!!! & yummy, too!!! I make sure I make Dak Hing my must-go each time I come back to Montreal from California, in California, the amount for the price is unbelievable, they can easily charge double or triple the price!The lady owner is also super nice, go and get your fix, you will love it, your wallet too!!!"
