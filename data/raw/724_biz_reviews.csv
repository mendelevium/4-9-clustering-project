I popped in last week for a quick lunch, the space is beautiful and I'm so happy to see something beautiful on this lovely corner of Little Italy by the park. I had friendly quick service at the bar where I got to watch the kitchen in steady happy flow, and the microgreens growing under the light, and the happy vegans indulging in a rare super hearty lunch. I ordered the agedashi tofu, the spicy kimchi ramen with coconut cream broth, and a glass of orange wine. The tofu came very lightly battered and floating in a dreamy light broth. The ramen was stellar, I really recommend this dish. My husband makes a killer vegan ramen and we've been disappointed by versions at restaurants around town so I'm always hesitant, but this was definitely worth my time and money and I was taking flavour notes to bring home. The coconut spicy broth packed with fresh noodles and pickled things and crispy tofu was heaven. Can't wait to go back and eat this exact order again! And then maybe I'll try some other things =)"
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,"Unfortunately, I didn't like this restaurant's food. I would've rated it 2* but the ambiance and service were good so I'll leave it at 3*. Also it was packed so clearly people are excited about a vegan ramen place near (in?) Little Italy.I was there for a foodie event where we got to try a bunch of appetizers (we paid for our food). Most of the food was similar to one another, reutilizing the same ingredients and flavour profiles over and over again - so there was barely any distinction in terms of flavours and textures. For example, okra is not a popular ingredient due to its slimy consistency yet to have it be in 3 or 4 of the dishes we tried was way too much. The gyozas were good but that's it out of 10 appetizers. I even got to try their kimchi ramen and I did not like it. The in-house kombucha was good though. Presentation was great, flavours were bland/lacking. There are SO many good vegan restaurants in Montreal that I would not recommend this one to my vegan friends."
/user_details?userid=yERJfPKhhU49aJAJ6DvqEg,Sian D.,"Kirkland, Canada",4 star rating,"Umami Ramen is a Japanese vegan ramen restaurant located in Little Italy. The spot is super cute, with cozy couches, dim lighting and modern accents. I went for an event so I had the chance to try many of their dishes. Here's what I thought:Disclaimer: My opinions are influenced by the fact that I've never tried this type of food before (vegan Japanese). Edamame: I've never had them before, but these were delicious! A great way to start the meal when you are waiting for your other dishes. Agebitashi Eggplant: This was one of my favorite dishes from this restaurant. It had a great sauce on it (like soy sauce), which made it super tasty. For someone who is a huge meat lover and had never tried vegan food, this dish made me super excited to try the rest! Potato Salad: Who doesn't like potato salad?? Agedashi Tofu: The tofu was fried, which was a tasty new take on this ingredient for me. But overall this dish was a bit iffy. I didn't like how mushy the cubes of tofu were. Daikon Furofuki: Another dish I was iffy about. It was also mushy. Karaage: Delicious!! I probably liked this one so much because it tasted kind of like meat. But, regardless, it was so good!! Definitely recommend for those trying vegan food for the first time. Wakame Salad: Another delicious dish! The salad was fresh and the sauce was delicious. Tasted like the seaweed salad I get on my poke bowls!!  Homemade Gyozas: Also great! Perfect dish to share with someone. Another favorite!! Kushikatsu: Basically fried vegetables. Good!Okonomiyaki: Sooo good! Seasoned really well. Tonkatsu: Also good, but pair it with the sauce!! Wafu Salad: Pretty ordinary. Ohitashi Yuzu-Kocho: Pretty good. Dessert: Had the donut with ice cream. It was delicious. An amazing way to end the meal. Get it! Get it! Get it!Overall, I had a good experience at this place. Maybe not the place for a meat lover, but for my first vegan experience, I enjoyed it. You can also pay using the chkplz app, an up-and-coming application that lets customers split the bill at their table, tip, and pay without having to wait for the waiter. We used it and it was super quick and convenient. I recommend downloading it!"

The ambiance was great with modern decor and a lot of sitting space for such a small space. It was a rainy day and we needed something to warm us up and nothing warms you up like a good bowl of ramen. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the food. My friend ordered a Miso Ramen and I ordered a Shoyu Tsukemen and a beer. The broth was so salty we could barely drink it. I had two pieces of tofu skin which were also heavily salty. The rest of the ingredients were bland without much complexity to the taste.With a bill that totalled around 30$ each.. I was expecting a bit more from a place that specializes in ramen and Japanese food. I will go back perhaps to try their Izakaya menu but my expectations won't be as high."
/user_details?userid=MWCPUFk-fnNXehPosCtwHA,Geneviève F.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I really enjoyed the appetizers. I tried the dumplings as well as the pancake. Both were very good. The other appetizers also seemed promising.However, I took the spicy creamy ramen, which was kind of bland and not creamy. The noodles also had a weird texture. I also felt like it would have been better with more veggies and some tofu, for some added variety/texture. I would go back for the appetizers but would actually skip the ramen... at a ramen place. Good looking place and atmosphere. Good service.I love the idea of vegan ramen, but somehow it was underwhelming to me."
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Umami Ramen is a new vegan ramen joint that is directly located in front of Dinette Triple Crown. With a centrally located bar with tables around it - the decor was very inviting with dim lights. I came here for a foodie event to try out the whole menu (I paid for my food.) The tasting menu compromised mostly of apps, but none of the dishes really stood out for me. In terms of flavour, originality. I would say the dumplings were very good. Given all the items I tried, I was still curious to try their signature item -Ramen! So I ordered a bowl of Kim chi ramen . Price for ramen bowls start at 15$. The ramen was good-fancy chef boy r d but it was more enjoyable than the starters. I also ordered their house made kombucha that was sooo good. I'm not vegan but I have my share of favourite vegan restaurants that I prefer over this place. So, take this review at face value - as a vegan you're take may be different. I still applaud plant base businesses carving out more unique choices for the Montreal community."
/user_details?userid=rkPrz6uwJIefZdH2Oqv4Tg,Christian C.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The restaurant was quite busy keeping up with customers that kept coming. We waited a while but it was worth it. We tried the miso and shoyu ramens, both had powerful umami coming from kelp and tomato, garnished with tofu and yuba and made with in-house ramen noodles. I personally liked the entrees more than the ramen, especially the karaage which was also made with yuba. The okonomiyaki was nice but I wish it had a little more texture to it. Lastly, the beers paired perfectly with the dishes and I recommend the yuzu lemonade."
/user_details?userid=WwAca-juCGomA6OOxEwgEw,Ved N.,"Langley, Canada",5 star rating,"We came here on a rare parent date night and enjoyed every second. The drinks were fantastic, service knowledgeable and friendly, and food just amazing. We learnt a thing or two about ramen and Japanese food as well from our server. Highly recommend it as a more upscale dine in ramen experience or just grab a bowl and run out. We loved the Umami Sour cocktail followed by some great appies that included shishito peppers (great flavour with some sneaking in some heat). Then we had Okonomiyaki which was just packed with flavour and Tofu Agedashi which was in a fantastic broth that went amazingly well with the prune ""jam"" on top. For our main we ordered the Miso Épicé Tsukemen style which comes with thicker noodles and the broth on the side. It was a pleasure to dip the noodles and vary the broth amount. Noodles were al dente and delicious and we loved the marinated mushrooms as well. The Tonkatsu Tempeh that came with the curry ramen was also amazing and curry flavour was unique and delicious but Miso Épicé was the favourite. Go get some!"
/user_details?userid=nzR3EzZDaKwSIqgpbU7PWw,Dustin B.,"Miami Beach, FL",5 star rating,Excellent plant based restaurant! Probably one of the best ramen we've had in a long time! The place is not very big and it gets busy on weekends so make sure to call ahead to reserve a table. Everything on the menu is very good with lots to choose from. The mushroom crepes are delicious!!
/user_details?userid=1svmnh1EeEj1BppasJsToQ,Dino B.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I don't write many yelp reviews, but it's been tough trying to find a good ramen joint, until I found this place.  The appetizers, small plates, & ramen are all amazing.  I've been there 3 times since my first visit last week, & I crave this on the daily.  It's extremely FRESH.  As a chef, it's important to see a certain level of quality, & this place doesn't fail.  It's clean, it's sanitary, beautiful decor, GREAT BEER SELECTION.  Highly recommend!"
/user_details?userid=NiZK2S0SOfSRR4P50KN98A,Meaghan P.,"Beaconsfield, Canada",4 star rating,"I am a new fan! Always searching for new places to hit up with my brother and his girlfriend as they eat a primarily vegan diet. They recommended the place and we went as a family including my parents. 6 people definitely needed a reservation (even on a Sunday @ 7 pm) to get seated comfortably. Place is not very big but menu packs a nice punch. Between us we tried the Karaage made with froulet, the tonkatsu and the gyoza as appetizers and have to say they were all a hit, particularly the gyozas! For mains we had the spicy miso ramen, the creamy kimchi ramen, the tantanmen spicy ramen (my boyfriend), the curry tsukemen (this was mine) and the miso tsukemen. Everyone had picked just the right amount of flavour and spice for their pallets. I do wish there had been a bit more vegetable in each bowl but overall the depth of flavour is amazing and the confit tomato was such a tasty surprise! Never had one before. A word of warning, the tantanmen is VERY SPICY, but also incredibly delicious if you like spice like my boyfriend and I do. For dessert we each had the homemade doughnuts with the soy based icecream and were in heaven! My dad is lactose intolerant so this was a wonderful tasty treat for him. Save room for it!In terms of drinks, there is something for everyone and the bar has a wonderful variety of specialty cocktails for you to experience. Overall you really can't go wrong. To our wonderful waitress, thank you for being patient and explaining the whole menu to us in English as best you could! Much appreciated!So if you're a small group and looking for a good vegan resto in montreal, give this place a shot! If you're a bigger group, make a reservation so you won't have to wait too long :) but still go."
