I think their menu is a little reduced but there is certainly something for all tastes. The restaurant is very small but social distancing between tables is well respected. We went with a three year old. Although I wouldn't qualify this place as an ideal family restaurant for young children, the staff was still super nice with my daughter and made us feel welcome. It was very appreciated. Service was great with the waiter being friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu.And the best part... the food!Stuffed zucchini blossoms: Amazing, tasty, delicate and crunchy without being too oily... seriously one of the best I've had.Panzanella salad with heirloom tomatoes: I normally wouldn't order such a simple dish off a menu... but it was so good!!! I'm actually looking forward to going back soon just to have it again!Gnocchi: very flavourful with a good texture.Pizza: Neapolitan type of crust is not my favourite as I usually like a little more crunch/texture. However the pizza dough at Antonietta however was quite good, tasty with the perfect amount of char. We tried many types, Cacio e pepe and Margherita were my personal favorites. You can definitely taste the quality of the ingredients that they use.Tiramisu: entirely homemade and not too sweet... pretty perfect actually.I really have only positive comments to make about this little gem. Enjoy!"
