/user_details?userid=c4lTZbA8NeZBgB1YYB6Izg,Julie C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I recently went to Monkland Taverne for a dinner. This was my second time visiting. I remember how much I loved my first visit here and the second time definitely did not disappoint either. We arrived just in time to catch the 5à7 oyster special so we got 18 oysters to start and let me tell you, these were the best 5à7 oysters I've ever had! They were Sand d'une oysters from PEI. I remember getting a side order of Brussels sprouts last time I was here and it was really great so I tried another Brussels sprouts (this time they were fried) and it was great. For the main I had the chicken Milanese and my partner had the fresh cavatelli (with wild mushrooms, Tuscan kale, oven-dried cherry tomatoes, Parmesan, braised shallots, porcini stock).The service and the food were both impeccable, my only complaint is that it does get a bit loud."
/user_details?userid=pByaCBjdy8Ydj0vQKpdcRA,Daniel B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Earlier this year, I gave a less than stellar rating to their sister restaurant located in Westmount Square. I'm really pleased to say that our dinner experience at the Monkland branch last Saturday night was a marked improvement.The Monkland Taverne has a vastly different vibe from the Westmount version. The room is smaller, cozier, and teeming with energy on a Saturday night. Part of the appeal here is that reservations are not accepted. If you arrive before 7pm, you should be fine. We walked right in and were seated immediately. Service started out very strong as we ordered some wine and appetizers.  They gave us a perfectly tailored wine recommendation which we enjoyed with the warm mozzarella appetizer which was nothing short of epic. It's essentially a large ball of fresh cheese on an oversized slice of grilled bread topped with sautéed greens, nuts, and other assorted goodies.The only misstep of the night was the broccoli and blue cheese with candied pecan appetizer which was drenched in an extremely acidic and tart dressing. I didn't see much blue cheese. More importantly, the dressing on the broccoli was so bright and over-salted that each bite was painful and unpleasant. Usually, I won't say anything, but when the waiter came by to ask if we were enjoying everything, we sheepishly told him that the broccoli was inedible. He didn't hesitate in offering to replace the dish with something else and not charge us for the broccoli which was a nice touch.As a replacement, we chose the salmon tartare which was served in a nice large portion (as it should be for 24$) on a bed of avocado. I had been disappointed earlier in the year when we ordered this in Westmount and they decided to replace the avocado with cucumber. Unless you're making pickles, cucumber is a lesser vegetable as compared to the avocado. There exists a vegetable hierarchy. If you don't agree, just ask Mandy's about their latest specials. (Spoiler alert: it's a 23 dollar salad) For mains, my wife had some sort of mushroom pasta which she reported to be amazing. I'll take her word for it as I don't eat mushrooms. I had the burger with extra cheddar for 22$. This is one epic burger, I tell you! Gigantic, meaty, layered with sweet pickles, juicy......I cannot come up with enough apt adjectives. It is a crime that this burger is absent in every well known list of Montreal's best burgers. Mind you, for 22$, it should include some fries, which it does not. Those will run you another 7$ bringing the cheeseburger and fries combo to an impressive 29$ before tax and tip. I suppose this is better than the Westmount chapter where they won't even serve you the burger at all after lunch time. Even at a ""fancy"" restaurant, a burger and fries shouldn't cost a penny more than 25$ at the upper limit. As the night wore on, the restaurant quickly reached capacity with a line forming at the door. This coincided with the service and attention from the waiter slowing down. It's wasn't a big deal as we were having a good time. As a whole, you really get a nice neighbourhood vibe at this establishment. The prices are a bit too high, but they aren't suffering one bit for it...at least not on a Saturday night."

We sampled cocktails, wine, appetizers and entrees. To start, we tried the ceviche, Chinese eggplant and Thai shrimp. I strongly disliked the smell of the fish sauce in the shrimp BUT it tasted delicious. The eggplant was spicy and interesting but the ceviche and shrimp stole the show for me.I ordered the mushroom cavatelli as my main and it was deliciousssss. So worth it and I would order that again!Great night, delicious food and a great neighbourhood spot."

/user_details?userid=GTPbXMMhj0XEhVqD24i5RA,Norhan M.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I've been here a couple of times and enjoyed my meal before but this time I was slightly disappointed. It is a little bit overpriced for what you're getting.The salmon tartare entree was delicious and fresh. Oysters are typically fresh here. Priced decently if you go during their happy hour (5 to 7pm). German mashed potatoes were good. The fries however, while inexpensive, were greasy, short, and lacking flavour. The worst part was definitely the cheese platter. Overpriced for some small slices of mediocre cheese. The bread it's served with was also unpleasantly cold (not room temperature, not somewhat warm,  but cold). According to the waitress this is how things are done there and the bread can be cold if you're not getting a fresh batch right out of the oven. It seems unclear whether this restaurant is trying to cater to finer tastes or to the masses. The prices are high and the menu specials are usually good, but the portions are very small and the main menu seems to be hit or miss."

We had some mixed drinks and they weren't amazing - this is the only reason I'm not giving the tavern 5 stars. I will definitely be going back for some more of that broccoli though! Well worth a visit! Oh and it has a really beautiful patio to enjoy summer evenings!
/user_details?userid=M8I5tWwzV_HkCPmt85xHBw,Jennifer B.,"Lachine, Canada",2 star rating,I was very excited to go to this restaurant after hearing about it being a staple in Monkland village. The staff are very nice and the service was great. overall ambiance in the place is awesome.The only problem... Very over priced for the menu items that are offered...$$ wouldn't be accurate.
/user_details?userid=K_dM0CZKjMi5SM9P8q5C8w,Reixa C.,"Coconut Creek, FL",5 star rating,"3/15/15- Recommended by a local Montreal chef. Best food during this trip hands down. We had the chef of Taverne pick a few items for us. AMAZING! Korean Beef Tartar, Pok Pok Crispy Shrimp, Albacore Tuna on Tostada, Mac n' Cheese, Butcher's Choice Steak, is some of the dishes I remember. After the meal, we ordered shots and had them with the Chef. An evening to remember."
/user_details?userid=akdTvwDGQMBq9LfF7_gHxw,Carol E.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,I don't know what is happening lately with this place but the service is slow and the waiters are not nice; the food is mediocre.It's too bad because it used to be my favorite neighbourhood place.
/user_details?userid=pjyiGFo8GNQ4YvcukxbOug,Max N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Tavern is one of my mom's regular neighborhood  spots and I have to agree that it is always consistent in terms of food and service.There is often a wait and it gets very loud but we arrived around 6:15 on a rainy, Saturday night so there were only a few people seated when we arrived.They have a seasonal daily menu along with their regular menu, so there are plenty of options and something is sure to tempt your palate.We started off with the crunchy, coconut shrimp. They are a nice size, plump and juicy with a sweet honey sauce. Their salmon tartare and calamari are also  solid choice as starters.The Mac and cheese is usually my go to dish when eating here because it is truly one of the best macaroni and cheese's I have ever tasted. A mix of cheese, garlic , a little tomato and truffle oil perfectly merge together for a melt in your mouth, decadent experience. It is a hearty portion that is great for sharing but it is definitely worth indulging in if you love macaroni and cheese.But on this visit, I wasn't starving nor did I want to leave feeling stuffed so I chose the hanger steak which came with a fennel salad.The steak was beyond tender, deliciously flavored and perfectly cooked to medium as I had requested. It was served with a red wine sauce and I enjoyed every mouthful.The salad was on the salty side and did nothing for me but I didn't order this for salad, so no biggie.My mom had the pork chop, a huge monster sized portion served with bocconcini salad. I'm not a fan of pork chops but it's aroma appealed to my senses and I had a bite, which I enjoyed thoroughly.  It was lightly breaded and nicely spiced and I definitely recommend it.We were both in the mood for something sweet and chose the bread pudding with caramel sauce. It was moist and custardy with chocolate chips nestled in between a caramel sauce. Overall it was good but the caramel was sparse in quantity and could have been thicker.All and all a top food choice in NDG."

Specialscare definitely worth listening to and ordering. Had a wonderful pasta as well as the salmon tartare to start. Good cafe latte to finish. Great people watching as well. Cozy upscale casual place."
/user_details?userid=jVYzrVblDFSuL3GHtt8ZSA,Crystal H.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"For a leisurely casual business lunch (read, somewhat slow service), this Taverne fits the bill eloquently. Surrounded by lots of business people both inside, dressed in suits, and outside on the terrace enjoying vino at lunch, I could have spend hours here. Who knew that warm goat cheese with roasted tomatoes and spinach salad could be so beautifully perched as a terrine next to a bed of dressed greens and taste so divine. It's the most delicate and tasty salad. And perfect if your lunch includes lots of chatting, as mine tend to.I will most certainly be back!"
/user_details?userid=6eYecZI0cGbSdVP33PawDA,Frédéric L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I have been several times to Monkland tavern there is always good comfort food and quick service. If you a good tartare, a burger or beef bavette you can't go wrong. The only draw back is it can be loud and crowded."

Its even better in the summer to sit outside enjoy a nice drink along with their excellent food. Its not a cheap place but not overly priced very reasonable for the type of place that it is.

/user_details?userid=ILe3tzgnbGSaZfpArtJdjA,Mike S.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Overrated and overpriced! I could probably stop my review right here. The place is very nice, the location is great, the service was very pleasant as well! But everything we ordered was quite boring. We ordered one entrée, a $32 bottle of wine, a pasta dish, and a hanger steak. This came to $130 with tip. You can do waaaaaay better for $130 than what I got the other night in at least 50 other montreal restaurants. Bottom line... The food was okay, but it was overpriced for what it is."
/user_details?userid=UlwXE74HFHPhw5hx9jPO6g,Kay I.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"I was tramping around Montreal by foot when a big snow storm hit.  My husband and I kept looking for an open restaurant or pub so we could get out of the weather.  Because of the holidays, not much was open (or friendly, oddly enough) and our faces were frozen.  Without nearby options, I said, let's get on the metro and go to the Tavern.  I was not disappointed with our choice.The staff was friendly and welcoming as usual.  As we sat at the bar, we watched the restaurant quickly fill up with neighborhood locals.  We started with the ginger shrimp.  My husband was amazed to see me devour the shrimp as I don't particularly like seafood.  I said, I don't like shrimp, but I eat them here.  They're that good.For mains, we split the salmon tartare.  The crostini was perfectly toasted and the salmon was married perfectly with its bed of cool, creamy avocado.  We also split the mac and cheese and the meatball sliders.  The sliders were perfect.  Just the right amount of spice and sauce over juicy meatballs.  I have never ordered the mac and cheese here because I always refused to spend over twenty dollars on something that I can make well at home.  Big mistake.  This is not your grandmother's mac and cheese.  It is worth every penny and I would be tempted to move to Montreal in order to eat this on a regular basis.  Bite the bullet and find out what you're missing.I can't wait to come back the next time I'm in town!"

It quickly became so crowded people were waiting for an hour or so. They do not take reservations. There was lots of energy and it is LOUD. But the service was impeccable. Great consults and recommendations on drinks. And the food was spectacular. In spite of the crowds waiting we never felt hurried and were welcomed and pampered. It was not inexpensive but well worth a special, fun night out."

,,"Munich, Germany",4 star rating,"An institution on Monkland Ave. Get there early on weekends because it's always full and they don't take reservations. The food is always excellent, and after countless visits I have yet to be disappointed. The only downside is they tend to overprice their wine. The crowd is mixed in age but mostly anglophone"
