The restaurant probably has 35 seats.They offer what looks like a full bar and a short list of homemade cocktails. I had the Island Tonic (gin, campari, triple sec and tonic) and i recommend it. Couldn't confirm if they offer wine. We shared plantain and spicy sauce as an appetizer. They offer sweet or savory, we got savory. Very good choice! I chose the jerk chicken breast plate with half rice half fries. Chicken is flavorful and tender, fries are thin and crispy and rice it traditional riz pois coller. They also have an option for Portuguese chicken. Both are cooked on fire. My partner had the oxtail Mac and cheese and omg what a fusion cuisine plate. Creamy, spicy, tender meat. The small portion is more than enough.They also offer poutine with choice or jerk chicken or pork, griot, shrimp or oxtail.I will be back for sure."

I first discovered this place at the annual poutine fest in 2017. I was thrilled by the amazing flavours popping in my mouth. I followed them since then. Communication isn't great with them but I don't care because the food is great and generous. They went from the location on Anger Ave to Laurendeau and now the have that amazing location on St Laurent. Great atmosphere, good jam mostly from the 90's and early 00's fun people/ waiters. I highly recommend this place, great time guaranteed. On top of that it's affordable"

The three dishes were a must. I believe that their mac and cheese is the best in Montreal. Jerk chicken is spicy enough and juicy, and the plantains are to die for."

Excellent service, food was ready quickly for takeout, and it was freaking delicious. I did not like the coleslaw, no big deal. Half chicken and Mac n Cheese, amazing flavours and fresh chicken. Great sized portions. Really hope it comes to Vancouver."

The cardiac arrest combines both plus your choice of meat which I chose chicken.  We went back the following day for more, it's that good.  Nothing I've ever had in the states."
