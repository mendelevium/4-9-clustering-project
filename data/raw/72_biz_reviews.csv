They had a potato thing with the burger and it wasn't great. Hopefully that gets better soon!What can I say that hasn't been already said about Lola Rosa? To start, this is where I bring all of my visitors to Montreal. Food: so flavourful that you'll hardly miss meat if you're a meat eater. My recommendations and to to is always the quesadilla with the sweet potato filling. So good. I also enjoy their burgers, though it does tend to fall apart. In all honesty, you could order anything and it'd be perfect. Nachos are also towering. A Service: Not only is the food perfect for people of all diets, but the servers even go out of their way to ask if anyone has any dietary restrictions - something I feel that is super important since many folks have restrictions. Your water is always full, the servers are always so friendly. Ambience and space: it's a little space but you can reserve your table in advance (highly recommended as it gets REALLY busy). There are tables that you can pull the drawers out from and read peoples letters and random thoughts. It's a bit loud so you'll find you'll need to talk louder in order to hear conversations."
/user_details?userid=l9fGOqjEQDEN10Pog3cMng,Xena W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Lola Rosa is a FANTASTIC place for cozy and satisfying plant-based meals in the McGill ghetto. It's a vegetarian restaurant but there are tons of (clearly-labelled) vegan options that I want to try. Their dishes are all colorful, vibrant, and simply but beautifully plated. The portions sizes are generous but not excessive. I also love the reasonable prices (expect to spend around 18$ including tax and tip). The interior is small but the decor is cute and homey. Honestly, this just may be my new favorite restaurant in Montreal!I had the vegan burrito stuffed with sweet potato puree, black beans, corn, and red pepper, and topped with salsa and creamy avocado-lime sauce + rice & salad. Many people recommended the Lola Rosa burrito to me, and they weren't wrong! This is probably the best vegan burrito I've ever had."
/user_details?userid=Zd3zd6qztBvRvr0bbdpTdg,Zahra V.,"Vancouver, Canada",2 star rating,I've been here three times and the food is mediocre at best. The only thing that may be fine to eat here is the nachos with the sour cream. The Portobello and dragon fruit slow-cooked stew is pretty much not edible. It's a dark brown mix of veggies and for some reason it tastes bitter.

I revisited this place with a friend and it was a good experience. This isn't a bad restaurant, it just wasn't spectacular for me. It's a fairly small and compact restaurant, very clean, very rustic and cozy, even the washrooms were very clean. The service was great, the servers were very vigilant, they changed our water jug many times for fresh water. They asked several time if we were happy with our meal. I ordered the soup of the day which was good. Then I followed with chipotle chilly which I didn't find spicy. It was black beans based, with a rice layer at the bottom and a few tortilla chips to go along. It was very filling, I really enjoyed it. My only disappointment, my friend ordered a drink which had a dead fly. They gave her a new drink, but I expected them to either give a discount or offer it for free. Eventhough they didn't, we still enjoyed the overall experience."

That was AMAZING!! Then we tried their different world plates - Indian curry, Mexican burrito and Tunisian ragout. The burrito was our favorite, but all the food was delicious."
/user_details?userid=WMK1j18ACm-EtopEznV4Rg,Jana T.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"Stopped in here for lunch after a morning workshop at McGill new residence hall before heading back to work.  It was fun to wander around the student ghetto and relive vague memories of being drunk a lot in the early 1990's.  Not too much has changed since then... but Lola Rosa is definitely a great new addition.  Wish it had been there in my day.  Great vegetarian menu with lots of vegan options.  I had the Tunisian ragout, very tasty and filling with just a little bit of heat.  It's a cute little spot, with quick friendly service.  I'd definitely come back or try one of its other two locations when in the neighbourhood.  I do kinda think that they totally stole their logo from Depeche Mode's Violator album cover."
/user_details?userid=wWHeaOS28fnCnFN1Pmo3xg,Shaan A.,"Thornhill, Vaughan, Canada",4 star rating,"Definitely a solid 4 stars. Ordered takeout on a weekday and it was only a 10 minute wait. They have many locations for your convenience all over the city. When I arrived to pick up my food, the place was packed. I would assume at least a 20 min wait (not sure if they accept reservations). It had a very authentic and lively vibe. The servers were friendly and helped me get my takeout fast and efficiently. I decided on a burrito made with avocado and beans. I was craving some comfort food and this definitely hit the spot. The burrito was prepared perfectly - stuffed to the makes with vegetable goodness. Oh btw this place is entirely vegetarian. The meal came with some sides too salad and rice....the rice was perfectly fluffy and so delicious. Extremely flavourful and very authentic.In all a solid takeout spot!"

Luckily for me, the Milton location is conveniently located about 30 seconds from work (McGill) so I get to pop in often.Usually, I get the Spinach Lasagna and Caesar Salad or the Nachos, but on my last visit, I tried the Jalapeño Mac and Cheese. It was okay - I thought it lacked flavour and could have used a bit more salt. Despite this, I've given the restaurant 4 stars because this was the first of many visits that I would have altered the dish.The Lasagna and nachos on the other-hand is a must-try!"

Most of my friends are vegetarians, one is even vegan and gluten free, so Lola Rosa is always a safe bet. I've been to Lola Rosa at this location at least 20x and have yet to be disappointed. I've tried most of the dishes on the menu and I have always been pleased. The ambiance is lively but not overwhelming. Try to make a reservation ahead of time and a line generally builds around dinner time. I would recommend the red sangria over the white/cider one!"

None of us are vegetarians, however we do have dietary restrictions and this menu didn't fail to impress. The food is so flavorful and the portions are generous so we all left satisfied and full. I had the quesadilla with the sweet potato and it was excellent. It had a little kick to it which was nice. The service was good and the atmosphere was really cute too. The only drawback is that the restaurant is on the smaller side, which makes it cute and quaint, but it does feel a little crowded and we did have to wait for a table to be available. However, it is absolutely worth the wait. You won't be disappointed!"
/user_details?userid=jXdnU8ONRIHVzhmDBvlmOQ,Ali A.,"Downtown, Canada",4 star rating,Place cozy and warm. Menu is filled with various but not many items. We had to change our order for the main meal and also for desert twice because they had gone out of ingredients. We tried the burger and the burritos  both were yummy especially the burger.Prices feel ok. Service could be faster but I understand that the restaurant was full and many were waiting for empty tables.Staff are friendly and could try to be even friendlier :)

Most of the menu is based on local and sustainably sourced ingredients, and they also had seasonal/daily specials written on the chalkboards around the restaurant. It just so happened that the special drink on my birthday was Rose Sangria using organic wine, so naturally, it was my beverage of choice. My entree lasagna was SO GOOD. Honestly, if I could I would love to eat here more often, but I definitely will come back next time I go to Montreal!Lastly, a cute characteristic of the restaurant is the guests can leave little notes in the drawers of the tables for others to read, and some of them even get hanged on the wall.Come here even if you are not vegetarian, it is so delicious that you will not regret it!"

My friend and I were in the neighborhood, and we went in for a late lunch. It's a cute rustically decorated restaurant. Their specialty is Mexican and vegetarian food. It's a small place, and it's cozy. I asked for a tequila with orange juice (want with grapefruit but they didn't have); when my drink arrived I found a fruit fly in my drink, I notified the waitress, she apologized and took way my glass, and made me a new glass, and she apologized again and again. The drink was perfect not too much of tequila and not too much of orange juice. I ordered spicy spinach Mac n Cheese, and it came with side salad. The salad was simply ordinary. The Mac n Cheese was spicy but super delicious. The spice was great zing to the dish. After we finished, we were told not to rush, whenever we want we can pay at the cash. As I mentioned, it's a nice cozy spot, after lunch, we continue to chitchat, the service still continued with filling our water jugs."

Wonderful atmosphere, friendly staff, amazing food! I ordered the Samosas and even though it said spicy (which I'm not a fan of usually) it was the perfect amount for flavor. Tried a local Quebec beer and couldn't ask for anything better. I also found a little surprise at my seat which made my trip off to the perfect start - maybe you'll be lucky to find it too...I enjoyed this place so much I have contemplated going back again before I leave."

Regardless, we're glad we were able to try the food here. For lunch, I ordered the burger au chanvre (hemp burger). The bbq sauce on the burger was too sweet for my taste, and the patty was on the mushier side but the side salad with chickpeas was solid. While we waited for our food to arrive, we noticed that the tables have little drawers where people kept funny notes.Overall, my meal was reasonable priced, and I liked that there were both healthy, as well as decadent veggie options available. I saw some nearby tables order some nachos which looked and smelled enticing so I'd like to come back someday to try those. Would come back with vegetarian and non vegetarian pals alike!"

/user_details?userid=OCizBSsT7V0TceW2pSbzYg,Philip M.,"Greater Carrollwood, FL",4 star rating,"Brunch Review:Pros: Homemade Nutella, Bagel BLTCons: Potatoes could be betterOverviewWe came here for brunch because my friend was vegan! Brunch is only on Saturdays and Sundays! I've been to Lola Rosa 2 times before for dinner, but this was the first time for a brunch! They're rolling out a few more brunch menu items- specifically at the Milton location- throughout the summer. I hope to get a chance to try them out after this experience! Each brunch item came with a side of potatoes and a small mason jar filled with fruit.Mains: Bagel BLT- this was a super light and satisfying menu item. I added avocado on mine! The lettuce was fresh and crisp, the tomato was nice and not too juicy. There was a crunch from that mock bacon which turned out to be a fried rice paper! It resembled the texture of crispy bacon quite well! Pancakes- these pancakes were nice and moist but weren't really fluffy. I think they were made of banana- I didn't ask though! I will tell you though, these were served with an unbelievable delicious homemade Nutella (as well as a side of maple syrup). This Homemade Nutella spread was so good that we drove to the Williams Location to buy a jar of it right after.Sides:Fruit Jar- Damn! I hate melons...melons are nauseating to me! However, these were the best melons I ever had! They had mint and basil incorporated into it and they brought out a freshness I never knew possible. There were cantaloupe, honeydew and grape pieces in it. Potatoes- these were lightly fried and sprinkled with a bit of paprika to add colour! They reminded me of ones you'd get frozen at the grocery store, then refry it at home! They were crisp but nothing special. I ate it all so I guess that says something ‍Drinks:Mimosa- orange juice mixed with cider, how can you go wrong? It was refreshing! Neither sweet nor strong.Service:Our waitress was very friendly and allowed us to sit-down at 11:15am when the location opened at 11:30am. She was very honest with the menu and was knowledgeable on how everything was prepared! There was one other waiter, who we felt was pressuring us to leave quickly by asking us 3 times if we were done and if we were ready for the bill- as if people were waiting for our table. There weren't, and it wasn't busy. Maybe he was just pointing out to us that bills had to be printed and paid at the cash...could be a miscommunication so I won't hold that against him! Overall I was very happy with my meal! I did not feel sleepy after brunch and felt relatively energized! Would definitely come back!"

I had no idea this place was vegan until my wife pointed it out. I got worried because im not a big vegan fan.

I got the hemp burger and I need to stress that this burger is legit one of my top five bites of all time.

I had the hemp burger which was yummy but a little mushy. I'm not sure I'd order that again.The service was fast and friendly. Tip: Don't drive there, you won't find parking easily."

Always a rapid service.Staff isn't always the most sympathetic, but -- oh well! This is Montreal, I guess, or 'cities'; some people seem to think that because they gather they're awesome or something. Nah; seriously, service industry? Be nice. I'm am NOT saying you have to endure shitty costumers and d***s, but when clients are nice, why give them the attitudes? ;).All right; it's not like it's like that 'every time' I got there, but there is definitely a particular staff situation at the Park location.

/user_details?userid=LPDOx50zUR-rEovzOhADbA,Rachel C.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"Located on the outskirts of McGill's campus, Lola Rosa is the perfect destination for someone looking for a quality vegetarian meal. I got the burrito which was delicious! As someone who eats meat at every single meal, I have always been skeptical about vegetarian food; however I always leave satisfied when I order the burrito. The portion size is hefty and the presentation of the food is phenomenal. My only critique is that the food could be a bit more flavorful, however that issue is fixed when you put the hot sauce on the burrito. While the food I received was excellent, the service was not up to par. My friend and I were seated at the same table as a boisterous party of four, and when we asked our waitress to be seated at a separate table they claimed that the table was ""reserved"", however no one showed up to take the table the whole time we were there. In addition, when I asked for hot sauce for my burrito, I was told that it costs 50 cents, even though the previous four times I've been to this restaurant it's been free of charge."

/user_details?userid=-MERKiI7sX6s9_ovlUxIXg,Matt R.,"Irvine, CA",3 star rating,I was visiting the area and happened to pop up on Lola Rosa. I liked the vibe and the food choices were good. I've been a vegetarian for over two years so when I saw they made vegetarian nachos and burritos I thought I'd give it a try.We got the nachos and the Mac and cheese.The nachos weren't bad. Overall they had a good taste but being Mexican and coming from California I want this review to be more constructive than anything else. The salsa on the nachos was too much of just a tomato blend. My recommendation would be to add some cilantro and Serrano chili peppers. This will help to add some spice and flavor to the salsa. I was actually quite surprised at the chips beans etc though. Not bad. You could even try to sprinkle some lime in there as well over the top. Not too generous.Mac n cheese. I love Mac n cheese. It was very good. Unfortunately the jalapeños that were in it had no flavor. I would recommend using pickled jalapeños as those tend to keep flavor very well. I'm not sure if you have these in canada but the favorite brand over here in the Los Angeles area is Embasa Jalapeños. Service was great and very friendly. I wouldn't mind stopping by again if I am visiting.

I was traveling with my bff who is vegetarian, so the trip had to consist of some tasty and interesting vegetarian options. Lola Rosa's did not disappoint.I dunno why we thought this, but we winged it and just walked there without a reservation. It was quite the wait for dinner and I'm glad we stuck through it for almost an hour. The place is in a neighborhood and is a revamped garage (kinda). Hipster, trendy, or what have you, this place is packed with young to middle-aged trendsetters.Tonight we indulged in sangria, the heaping Lola's nachos, and quesadillas. The nachos were the highlight. Beautifully constructed mound of fresh ingredients, you'd be a fool not to get this. Very filling to share for two. As for the quesadilla, it wasn't the most memorable, but it helped make the meal along with the nachos. My bff and I left the restaurant stuffed and happy.Final verdict:If you're a vegetarian in Montreal, this is one of the best spots. A little different from what you normally get as 'vegetarian,' there's a reason why this place is so crowded and busy."
/user_details?userid=GxdCcMYn13DSzwEPqs8Kag,Kiran S.,"Milpitas, CA",5 star rating,"This is a small restaurant that is near McGill University. Apparently, the owners are french and they have experimented with food having taken inspiration from different cuisines. You will see this first hand when you go through the menu. A lot of the dishes seem to be from cuisines like Mexican, Indian and so on, but when you actually get them, they will taste very different to the original dish.As soon as we got in there, we saw that it was crammed. We had to wait a few minutes for a seat. We ordered wine, chilli and a few more other dishes. All of them were based on other cuisines with verious customizations. We enjoyed every bit of them.  Also, each of the tables have desks with notes crammed in them. Had a great time reading them. Overall, it was a great evening."

It was quiet in there with only a very few people eating there.  We got the back corner table, and it was perfect for our 1 year old since she likes to people watch.  And, this is the perfect place/location for that.We ordered the Rosa salad for me, quesadilla for my husband and a side of rice, beans and avocado for our daughter.  My salad was really good, but the dressing was the best part!

The service was quick from our one waiter who served the entire restaurant. They are hiring if you're looking. Anyways we ended up ordering the burrito, the quesadilla, and the curry. I specifically got the curry and wow, it was seasoned really well and the amount of spice was enough to get a really nice cook, and the bread was cooked really well. I really enjoyed the sweet mango chutney that came with it. It helped ease the spice and that bite with the curry, the bread and the chutney was out of this world.

Lola Rosa is an exception. The food is delicious and interesting, even for committed carnivores, and the small and quaint interior is charming. The servers are always cheerful and friendly - all in all a great informal dining experience. We returned tonight on a whim, after calling to see whether there was a line (a Wednesday at 8 pm). There was not so we went straight there. The burrito, the nachos and the black bean burger were excellent. They have a limited but interesting beer selection and good sangria. Highly recommend!"

In Montreal for work and needed to grab a bite to eat, so I slap ""vegan"" into the ol' Yelp search and just picked the closest place. When they asked me if I was ready to order I just gave two easy instructions. Bring me the darkest beer you have on tap and your favorite dish on the menu. I wound up with an amber-ish Christmas beer and the tunisian stew. First I was super surprised that both hit the table within like 5 minutes. The stew was amazing, great sweet savory pairing brought home by raisins and cinnamon balanced out with feta and tumeric. It was home-y it was warming, the perfect dish for a chilly night with a dusting of snow. The beer really went nicely with the dish with a little bit of spice of it's own. A great dish like that gave me enough confidence to try their dessert and I went with the Twix Tarte. It was awesome, rich and fudge-y filling with an awesome chocolate sauce. It definitely was reminiscent of Twix but in a much more grown up, much more indulgent sort of way. The service was fast and friendly. I really lucked out stumbling into a gem here. Check it out yourself!"

I tried both Lola locations and much prefer the location on Avenue du Parc because I prefer the ambiance. The space is larger and it's not quite as loud. The menu differs from location to location (more vegan options at Lola Rosa Parc). That said, both restaurants employ lovely staff who are accommodating and attentive. They are doing something right!If you come on in the evening, do make reservations at this location. I arrived at 9pm and the entire place was packed, save for one table, the one we had reserved. Not only was it packed, but as I mentioned before, extremely loud, to the point where we pretty much were shouting at each other (and, unfortunately, the waitress. I hate being rude). I much preferred the place an hour later when the crowd had left. On to the menu... it's well-edited. Nothing too creative or out of this world about it, which isn't always a bad thing. I ordered the soup of the day, which was a curried chickpea soup. I didn't love it, didn't hate it. I'm not a fan of completely pureed soups in general and this also needed salt. Next up, the tacos. What is really outstanding about them is the seitan, which is perfectly chewy without being rubbery and bursting with flavor. Seitan is often so bland and boring. This is the great kind! I just wish there was more of it in the tacos. Lola Rosa Parc has out-of-this-world phenomenal chickpea fries. I mean... the kind of fries that you're compelled to burn your mouth on. This location does not have them. I love those fries so much that I'm mentioning them in a review for Lola Rosa Milton, so there ya go!But what that other location doesn't have that this one does have is the Twix bar vegan dessert... a dessert in a league (or paragraph) of its own! Normally I'm too full from dinner to order dessert, but to be honest, I wasn't really in love with anything I ordered so room, I had aplenty and that's kind of serendipitous because this dessert is that insanely good."

We went with a rather large group (8 hungry guys between 21-25), and somehow managed to get a table without a reservation. In a city full of of smoked meat sandwiches and bbq pulled pork poutine, this is a haven for vegetarians, This restaurant fit the bill and left everyone happy, and most importantly, full on a quality vegetarian meal. Food: impeccable. Most people ordered a burrito (debatable contest for best burrito they've ever had), quesadillas (which made a few appearances on Instagram), or the curry (I forgot it was spicy, but still just as delicious).Desserts: what really put the meal over the top was the sangria. Rather inexpensive (I'm used to NYC prices) and delicious. We got a sangria made with cinnamon and whiskey, which I've never seen before but all I want to do is steal the recipe and make it at home. Cons of the restaurant: the wait. Like I mentioned, we didn't have much of a wait, but I walked by the restaurant during peak hours and saw a line out the door more than once. But, you can make a reservation AND THEY DELIVER!!Next time I'm in Montreal, I'm definitely going back, and if the owner is reading this, please message me your whiskey and cinnamon sangria recipe so I can spread the goodness with some deprived and overcharged New Yorkers."

Lola Rosa is quite a cozy restaurant, so we were a bit squeezed into our table, but once the food came out, everyone was happy. The Tunisian Ragout I ordered was out of sight delicious: chickpeas, cabbage and raisins on a bed of bulgur wheat, veganized without feta for me. Everything is vegetarian but the items that can be made vegan are noted with triangles on the menu. Quite a few others had the lasagna and ordered beer.

But I am a sucker for Mac & Cheese so when I saw it on the recently added portion of their menu, I had to indulge. The Mac & Cheese had spinach and jalapeno in it--giving it the perfect amount of kick. We also had the infamous nachos to share as an app--the half portion was plenty for three!Pro tip: This place is small and almost always packed--go a bit earlier or later than peak meal hours and avoid going here with a big group.

I came to Lola Rosa for a lunch date with my boyfriend, as it was recommended to him by a friend. The restaurant is quite cute, and in a nice area near McGill. We couldn't decide what to get, as everything looked and sounded amazing, and finally settled on a half portion of nachos and a mac & cheese. The nachos were AMAZING. covered in mozzarella, black beans, tomatoes, green onions, and some avocado and sour cream (I would have preferred more avo and sour cream, but that's a personal preference maybe). The mac & cheese was good, but not the best. We chose it because it was kind of cold outside, and we wanted some comfort food, and what better comfort food is there than mac and cheese? It just didn't have the richness or cheesiness that we were looking for, although the more I ate of it, the more I liked it, however I don't think I'd order it again. A word to the wise: portions here are HUGE. We were really hungry going in, and left completely stuffed (and this is for two people who love to eat). Either come very hungry, or share with a friend. We saw someone order nachos, which were what we thought was the full portion, so were proud of ourselves for choosing the half portion. Turns out what we thought was the full was the half, and the full portion is MASSIVE. I'd definitely come back here next time I'm in Montreal to try more things, and get the nachos again.

On one hand, it serves up high-quality vegetarian eats at reasonable prices; however, it's also quite possibly the only good restaurant in the Ghetto (hence one of the reasons why I chose to live deeper in the Plateau). Therefore, long wait times and crowded, loud conversation-making are bound to happen, unless you make a reservation like I did (life hacks everyone).I came here with a friend for a food date and we were promptly seated and utterly famished since we hadn't eaten at all that day. We ordered two chai lattes (an épicé for me and a regular one for her), a half order of nachos to share, and a mac and cheese for her and a lasagna for me. The chai was perfectly gingery for my taste (although my friend thought it was way too much), and I must have forgotten about how big even the half portion of nachos is but we attacked it anyway. The textures of the salsa, beans, avocado, tomato, and cheese melded together in a colorful flavor explosion, although the soggy chips at the bottom weren't exactly a plus. Afterwards, we received our main dishes. I thought the lasagna was divine and thought that the spinach pasta made an ordinary dish more unique, and the fact that they included mushrooms in the cheese and tomato sauce filling made it even better. Basically, it contained almost all of my favorites in one dish, something that I loved. The side salad was also surprisingly really good even with the dressing and croutons, and normally I hate salad dressing and think croutons are unnecessary. I tried my friend's mac and cheese, and to be honest, I thought it could have been creamier, although it was still satisfying.Afterwards, even though we were completely stuffed, we decided to say f*ck it and order dessert anyway. I got the matcha cake with a chia whipped topping and raspberry coulis, and my friend got the pineapple and raspberry cheesecake. The matcha cake actually had the green tea flavor coming through, and I thought the chia topping and raspberry coulis were amazing (you could definitely tell they used real raspberries). I wish that the cake itself was more moist and spongy, however, since it came off as a bit dry to me. I tried the cheesecake as well; in my opinion, they used way too much cream cheese and didn't use enough pineapple flavoring as I could barely taste it. It had a very cute and neat presentation in a little jar, but for $6.50 I still thought that it was kind of expensive.I will definitely come back to Lola Rosa for their main dishes and perhaps sample some more of their desserts, as their food is very satisfying and will leave you stuffed to the brim. What I've found is that even those with carnivorous tendencies give it their seal of approval, so it's sure to be a crowd-pleaser no matter who you're catering to."

The menu is extensive and very reasonably priced...everything in the menu SOUNDS really good...I've given this place a few tries! The hemp burger was recommended to me, but i found it rather stodgy and dry, although it came with a nice side-salad. The black bean sauce on the Poutine made an already heavy dish (!) extra heavy, although it had sweet potato fries which was nice. I got the nachos to take away, and there was hardly any toppings/cheese on them, it was almost just a plate of dry tortilla chips!!  The best thing I've had there is the curry which is nice and chunky but still lacked flavour.Good portion sizes for the price and its always busy so they must be doing something right, but there is definitely better veg/vegan food to be had in this city!"

I would personally come back even though I am not a vegan but it opened my eyes on those vegan meals. I learned that you don't need meat to make a dish delicious!!!"
/user_details?userid=bhLMo_nNvtASjL08S6HYxg,Venetia A.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"We were looking for an interesting meal after walking around Montreal all day. My partner being vegetarian, we thought we'd check out Lola Rosa which seemed to offer a non run of the mill menu. Food: we ordered a tomato tart and a lasagna. The lasagna was as good as a vegetarian lasagna can get. The tomato tart was in a well made pastry, but the filling could have been made slightly more interesting. It had finely chopped tomato and onions, so gave one the feeling of the main ingredient missing. Both dishes came with a lettuce salad with some shredded beet and carrot.  Filling and tasty enough. The most unique of the order and the star was the soup du jour - kale, white wine and coconut milk. Small portion but very tasty. Food gets 3.5 (4 for the soup though!)Ambience: the place is small, and feels warm and cozy, filling the room with a warm yellow light. There's a big window that opens out to the road and is kept open in the summer time - brings in light and adds character. Ambience gets a 3.5.Service: There were 2 women serving that evening. Ours was a very efficient, friendly and pleasant lady (we asked when we got seated if we could have another table instead, she was very nice about it) service gets a 4.Overall: I definitely recommended this restaurant - good food, warm ambience, great service. Note: we came here on a Saturday evening and we waited about 20 minutes for a table of 2 - there was a decent sized line the whole time we were there, testament to a deserved popularity."

Based on personal preference, I usually get the Three Cheese & Spinach Lasagne or the Burrito or the Quesadilla. You will either be surprised that vegetarian food can taste this good or forget that this was even a vegetarian restaurant. On top of the food, the restaurant as a home like atmosphere. It is really relaxing and a cozy little place to have dinner. The staff here are also extremely welcoming and exceptional. All portions are generous, fairly priced and extremely tasty.

My chai tea latte was great, the daily soup was tasty, and the half order of nachos I shared was great but it feel like it wasn't as good as the last time I was here. But still good nonetheless! Cool: I found in my table (there all old school desks it seems) and the drawer in my table had all these handwritten notes in it and so did my persons across from me. The notes had random stories, peoples thoughts experiences, and even random love notes etc haha it was great and made me smile ! Hopefully it I come here again in the future if I'm in Montreal again. I can update this to 5 stars! If your in the area and are young I recommend checking this place out. For the older crowd, not sure if it's so great for you. Noisy and full of young people.

I had one of those rare ""omigod is this meat"" moments because it looked like a ""real"" burger patty and tasted far too good to be made of humble ingredients like hemp, lentils and tofu. Next to the burger sat a generous side salad with chickpeas. Call me a happy camper! Before the aforementioned amazing burger arrived, I forgot that I had to wait 40 mins to get a table for dinner on a Saturday night (word to the wise: it is busy!!) by whiling away the time reading the curious, cute and downright deep notes tucked away in the drawers at each table. I was enamoured enough to write my own. (Sorry I had to hijack the back of somebody else's!)Lola Rosa has a pretty cool atmosphere, is perfect for veggie comfort, and has charm to spare."

Since we were only two people and had a reservation, we were seated right away. The ambience of this place is really cool, they have drawers at every table that are filled with notes from past customers. It's definitely a form of entertainment, waiting for your food and reading whatever random thoughts people wanted to write down. I'm not a huge fan of vegetables, so I wasn't sure what to expect.

My party of three was able to relax and enjoy our food in a timely manner, which is all we could ask for.I had a baked mac and cheese with a side of house salad. The Mac and cheese was great. They threw some spinach and sour cream in and used havarti cheese, which was creamy and rich. The potion size was not especially big, but it was a nice lunch size. The house salad added a bit of summer to the gloomy November afternoon, with sweet dressing and an orange garnish. My friends both got bean burritos with avacodo and loved them. My friend Jesse said it was in the top five burritos he'd ever had.The table we sat at had little drawers full of notes from past customers.

I'm a huge fan of ultra-tasty vegetarian food, and this ain't it. Bland, bland, bland.The ambiance is warm and inviting. I've always had competent, polite service. Noise level is reasonable. It's right in the heart of the McGill Ghetto, so it's often crowded with student groups--not a good place to try to seat any party larger than 4.The problem is the food. I've had something different each time I've gone, and I've sampled bites from my companions' plates, and all of the food is unimpressive. Everything has always been cooked properly and served promptly, but that just makes it all the more apparent that this food has no flavor. It's precisely dishes like these that give vegetarian fare a bad name. It's filling enough, but it's just no fun to eat. Go to Aux Vivres instead, where they understand how to draw bold flavor out of vegetables."

I had the spinach lasagna and it was pretty good. It had lots of cheese and it was very satisfying. My server warned me that it would be about 20 minutes for this, which was fine.The service was great. Beer list was just okay. I probably wouldn't come back to this location and would go to their Parc location next time to avoid a bunch of students.Prices were higher than at most of the places I ate in Montreal. I would come here again but not regularly."

I had heard nothing but good things about this place but there was nothing I could do to convince them otherwise. I finally got the chance to go and boy are they missing out! We started with a demi portion of nachos - the best nacho dish in Montreal. This is not an exaggeration. This demi portion puts all other full portion sizes to shame as it is a heaping pile of crispy nachos covered with beets, avocado, chilli, cheese, black beans, and other goods. For two people this is a meal on its own, but I ordered the seitan and black bean burger and really did enjoy it. I was not too crazy about the side of chick peas it came with but I really liked the salad dressing (whatever it was). My girlfriend ordered the seitan tacos dressed with coriander and spicy mayo. The one bite she let me have was tasty, though I found the seitan to be overpowering. Lola Rosa is a very affordable restaurant with top quality menu items that fill you up. Their dishes are packed with fresh flavours that stand out. Will definitely be going again!"

The nachos were really good and the portion was enormous but the mac and cheese was very dry and bland. The second time I had the tacos, they were so bad I couldn't finish them. The tortillas were dry and the marinated seitan just not to my taste. Both times it felt like the food was put together very quickly. Definitely not worth waiting outside in the cold for."

The chili had a mild sauciness.  The quesadilla had an excess of chunky avocado, but it didn't stop my wife from eating every morsel.  Rating based on genre--  if you want quiet, refined dining go elsewhere.

I've also ordered in vegetarian curry (with sweet potato, chickpeas, and tempeh) & poutine (sweet potato & potato mixed) from the other Lola Rosa location that does delivery. The menu selection here is super creative and unlike any other place I've been. It's a vegetarian place and have dishes ranging from burrito to curry. I live in San Francisco, where there are many ethnic and creative food options, but I still crave food from Lola Rosa Cafe. Many nice restaurants in the bay area serve foods that are too complex in flavor. The place isn't very big, but as others have said tables have enough distance between tables for privacy. Both the food and the restaurant is very cozy and intimate, and place felt woody (if I'm remembering correctly). I didn't see it but my friend was wowed by their serving of coffee (not sure which kind) somebody else was having because of it's foamy top.I wish there were more restaurants like Lola Rosa; unpretentious, serving homely, healthy food that's creative but cohesive and simple in overall taste/flavor. It's a place I'd feel comfortable trying different dishes on the menu, because every dish is uniquely Lola Rosa. It's a place you feel comfortable visiting often."

It's right next to McGill University and is very comfortable. They have quaint tables with little drawers in them filled with notes from people who have visited them over the years. It is fun to read the notes. The entire place has a warm and inviting ambiance. The owner's sister served us and was incredibly friendly and thoughtful. She gave us great recommendations, shared recipes and was very cheerful and positive. We were there for a good two hours and had a great time. We were very hungry and ordered a lot of food. We were three people and ordered the samosas, two chilis and one burrito. We also ordered the craft beer. They were gigantic portion sizes, we could have ordered just two items and been extremely satisfied. We had a huge to-go box filled with delicious food when we left. Craft Beer (L'alchemiste): A very balanced and fruity amber beer, we really enjoyed it. It almost had a mango tinge to it, which was surprising. Samosa: Absolutely delicious.It wasn't a traditional samosa by any means but a modern version filled with vegetables. The accompanying salad was the highlight of the evening. It had greens, carrots and beets. The dressing was tart, sweet and unbelievably tasty. I am not a big salad fan but I could eat that salad and dressing all day. So so good. Chili: The chili was flavorful, satisfying and delightful. We tried our best to finish them but we couldn't and packed almost 3/4th of the portion. Burrito: Another fantastic entree. The burrito was filled with lovely, unexpected flavors. It paired very well with the beer too. We were enveloped in an aura of contentment at the end of this meal. If we are in Montreal again, we will make sure to make a pilgrimage to this place and try the other things on their menu."

The service is friendly for the most part, but was slow. A soup and salad should not really take 20 minutes or so. Much of this delay, I think, was because the person whom I placed the order with was eating his lunch and did not bother to move quickly to place or make the order. Overall, my experience was really worth 3.5 stars, but I am bumping it up because I may have misinterpreted the slowness. I would go back and try something other than salad."

/user_details?userid=88BonK9xhT25r3TO6KxmeA,Jyoti A.,"Solon, OH",1 star rating,"For the 3 days that we spent in Montreal, we made good memories over this holiday weekend until our last night here when we chose this so called ""Mexican place"". It came highly recommended and we had loved the restaurants that we had chosen so far. After a long walk, we finally came to this place and loved the decor. But we were surprised to read the menu which had nothing ""Mexican"" about it. It is a vegan place that has twisted Indian and Mexican dishes. The place did not have AC on that day but had their window shutters open. We still Accepted it since we did not care about AC that much until little bugs started flying all around us. After taking our order, the arrogant waitress came to us after about 15 minutes and informed us that they were out of Tacos. We did not care that much yet and some of us changed our order to burrito. We got 2 nacho plates for 2 tables but were surprised that the bugs were falling on those nachos and no one really had a problem with it. We then saw the waitress closing the shutter doors after which it became too hot in that room and still there were many bugs trapped in that so called restaurant which was almost as big as a ""one car garage"". While we were looking at this with disgust, the waitress came and announced that they ran out of chili and again asked us to change the order. We had so far been very impressed with Montreal hospitality and it was sad to end our good time with this (where bugs were being served with food that we were required to change our order three times). We had enough in the name of this vegan crap in addition to having this crap in the humidity of this dungeon!!!! I then asked the waitress to bill me for what we all had been served so far and cancel our remaining order because it was hard to have a nice dining experience in a humid place with bugs flying all around and kids getting scared of then. But instead of being apologetic for our horrible experience, she told me, "" you will have to pay for it"". Again it was not about money but the experience of eating bugs that was bothering me. She then called her team and they all argued with me and told me repeatedly that they have already closed the shutters and We should be ok. She also told me that she has cancelled my order but I reminded her that my order was not cancelled but instead they did not have what many of us had ordered and we were being forced to eat what we did not want. I was also amazed to see that some servers were actually eating in the kitchen while they were also cooking and serving food in the dishes. In the end, I paid for everything and walked out because there was no point in trying to get them to see the meaning in all this . They still did not get what I was trying to convey. I am sure that there are many locals who feel that being vegan is being stylish but supporting this business where people are arrogant and unhygienic and where they treat tourists like ""one time customers"" is not cool."

When I go there to dine in, I am always satisfied and am especially a fan of the Salad Rosa. Sometimes, when I'm at work and didn't have time to bring lunch, I will get a salad to go. This is the only situation where I have kindof a grip with this place- you never know how much salad you're actually going to get! I usually order the full portion to go and sometimes it is filled with lettuce and other times (like today) it was more like a small scattering of mesclun at the bottom. I really do like Lola Rosa (esp nachos-yum!) but this inconsistency for a salad that is almost $14 after tax is pretty annoying. If I ordered a large salad, I want a large salad!"
/user_details?userid=wGBJgY50smoMRCwgeiLFxA,Debbie Z.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",5 star rating,My family and I were in Montreal for 2 nights. The host of our Air BNB had this restaurant in her list of recommendations. After a little break from our drive we set out for a short walk to the restaurant. We were shocked to see how full the restaurant was and were told there was a 30 minute wait. This was pretty rough given there is hardly a wait area and it was 15 degrees outside. Within 15 excruciating minutes we were about ready to call it quits but then in walked a patron with a reservation and encouraged us to wait as it would be well worth it. We stayed and boy am I glad we did. My 4 kids can be about the finickiest bunch as they come. They all enjoyed their food. I had the yellow curry dish which was outstanding and my husband ate (and loved) the chili. I ended my meal with a delicious ginger basil creme brûlée. The two girls working the floor were swift and service was impecable given the mad rush they were experiencing. Overall we had a phenomenal experience here and would definitely visit again when in town. Highly recommended but if it's a Friday or Saturday make a reservation for sure!

We all know though that quality weighs more heavily in the ranking. Luckily for me that wasn't a concern here either. I was excited to try out this popular establishment when I read about it recently on a ""places to eat in Montreal"" blog. I love vegetarian food; I love Mexican and I love good value for my money. This place hit on all fronts. I arrived at 7 and had to wait 30 minutes for a table as it was jam packed with what appeared to be all university students. When I was finally seated I received prompt friendly service. I ordered a glass of red wine ($6 per glass! Bonus!), chips and salsa to start and the quesadilla with sweet potato. The chips were warm and substantially thick and served with hot (as in steam rising from the bowl) salsa. That was kind of odd and it reminded me of chili without beans but after a few tries they grew on me. I really liked my quesadilla and nice little salad on the side. I didn't bother eating the accompanying rice as the carb heavy main course was already very filling. Overall I thought it was great value for the money and I would recommend it as a place to go if you are in that neighborhood."

I am not exactly a go forward for vegetarian food, but hands down for this place. Very tasty and hearty food. We started with the soup of the day which was a blend of cauliflower, carrots and some extra veggies, all blended together with the right amount of heat. Following that, my wife had the Chilli and I had the three cheese lasagna (not considered vegetarian for some due to the cheese) and both were exceptional. Service was very good, staff was friendly and prompt. All in all, it definitely worth a visit if you are in the area."
/user_details?userid=NLJT8SQ1f0YpxO4hFUPdrw,Emilie B.,"Washington, DC",4 star rating,"This was my first time eating in a vegetarian restaurant. I didn't really know what to expect because I love meat, chicken, pork and fish and I would never ever consider becoming vegetarian. This place is in the heart of the McGill ghetto. So, you must expect to have a lot of students around. The restaurant itself is very small and it can get very loud. Thus I would not recommend this restaurant for a first/second/third date, because you pretty much have to yell at each other to have a conversation. From the lunch menu, I ordered the burrito and my friend chose the half plate of nachos. I'll admit it: I expected vegetarian food to be dry. Yet, the burrito (filled with black beans) was surprisingly juicy and full of flavours. There also was a side of rice and a small salad, but I barely touched both because I just loved the burrito and it was quite big. My friend's half plate of nachos was HUGE. She's a varsity athlete and she didn't even finish it. She said she and her mother once ordered the full plate of nachos and there were leftovers.  I heard their desserts are very good (I saw someone eating their brownie and it looked delicious). However, I was too full after my meal to try it. Price: $12.50 before taxes, which is very reasonable.  One last comment, the service was a little slow. However, the place was full and there was a birthday lunch at the same time. Conclusion: I will probably go back to try the plate of nachos and their brownie."

After being away for several years I went back this weekend and ordered the nachos and hemp burger. The hemp burger was very different from what I had remembered - no longer on a bagel but served on two very thin slices of white toast. Needless to say I wasn't impressed, but the person I was with really liked it so I'm torn on this! The nachos were exactly the same, piled high with beans and veggies (maybe not as much avocado as before) and still very tasty. The server told us that the chef had changed 6 months ago and kept the nachos the same but changed some other items! So that makes sense for the hemp burger. Ohh just wish they had kept it the same. Still amazing though, just not 5 stars."

With a 3 year old. There was room inside and our daughter was being well behaved. Beyond being inconsiderate, it made no sense. So we left.I'm not someone who thinks we can take a toddler everywhere - but this place was listed as ""kid friendly"" and our daughter has eaten without incident in a lot of places MUCH nicer than this.I encourage families to avoid and Yelp to reconsider the ""Kid Friendly"" label."

I got there a bit before noon, so I managed to avoid waiting outside and got a good seat.I ordered the quiche of the day, but without the rice that comes with it. Even then the portion was adequate and filling, but the food itself was pretty average. The quiche crust was made of puff pastry that was somewhat dry and burnt, while the filling was tasteless and I could barely find the vegetables in it. The accompanying salad was not extraordinary either, just a mountain of shredded lettuce leaves and some dressing. I don't think it was worth the $15 I spent on food that day.I was not impressed with the service, since the person who took our orders seemed to be in a hurry and rushed us through, despite the fact that the restaurant was not even full by then. Ironically, the food then took some 25 minutes to arrive.I'm not sure if I'll check out their new location and try some other item on their menu, because I've been to better vegetarian restaurants in Montreal where the food was delicious and well-worth the price.I'm really giving a 3 out of 5 because I think Lola Rosa Milton is a bit overrated and overpriced."
