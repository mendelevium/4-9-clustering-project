Both, the inside and outside decor were nice. We shared three appetizers: fried calamari, beef carpaccio and cheese carpaccio. All were equally good! We also had one drink each. It's a nice place for a grub and drink. Also, staff was friendly and welcoming."
/user_details?userid=hG0FxhGxIz5mv1ezaKcQiw,Sam P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I came here with 13 other people for a birthday last night. It was a Saturday night but the restaurant wasn't so busy. This might have something to do with the fact that there was a huge storm out or maybe just due to the poor reviews.We were in the VIP room and it was super nice, with a spacious table and a big tv. The highlight of the evening was the service. Our waitress was very friendly and handled our large group very well. All the meals came out around the same time and they came around frequently to ask us how we were doing and if they could get us anything. They did take a while to fill up waters but I'll be forgiving.On first glance, I found the menu to be odd. It seemed to be Italian mostly but there are a handful of asian-inspired dishes and a section of more american, burger and fry dishes. It was confusing and it made me hesitant to order the Italian food because I don't love americanized Italian cuisine. I ended up going with the California Chicken Burger which was chicken, swiss cheese, pancetta, guacamole, mango, tomato and lettuce. I took it with fries which ended up being the best part of the meal. The chicken itself was flavourless and kind of artificial-tasting. I thought mango was a really good idea in this type of sandwich but they put a few tiny shredded pieces so you couldn't really taste it. The bun was huge (too big) but tasty. Overall, for 16.50$, I don't think it was worth it and found it to be expensive for what it was. MehEveryone seemed pretty happy with their meals and there were no major complaints. Nothing was authentic but that doesn't mean that it wasn't tasty. For example, my boyfriend ordered the Teriyaki sauté with chicken and while it was less authentic than what you'd get at a legit Japanese restaurant, he seemed to enjoy it.I wouldn't come back to the restaurant but I think it could be a good choice for corporate events/dinners or for big groups who can't decide on a type of food (Italian, Asian, American..etc)."
/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"(3.5 - value-to-price ratio was not great)The service, food and atmosphere are good. However, the value for money isn't quite great. I ordered the Asian bowl with chicken. It was surprisingly really good. It wasn't such a heavy sauce which was nice and there were tons of vegetables and chicken. The portion is more than enough to order on its own. Comparing the prices of some dishes to this one, I would recommend this Asian bowl as it is the closest you'll get for value for money (~18$). I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for dates or for small groups. However, for birthdays (the occasion that I was here for), it's a great atmosphere. There are many different types of options to suit most tastes. They also threw in a slice of cheesecake for the birthday which was nice."
/user_details?userid=jXdnU8ONRIHVzhmDBvlmOQ,Ali A.,"Downtown, Canada",4 star rating,Good for big gatherings say 20-30 guests. The grills menu is overpriced and I ordered burgers. Delicious! Pizzas are good too. Parking is like hell in this area need to search a while to find a spot. Cocktails are good but beer comes in limited choices. Staff are polite and efficient.
/user_details?userid=9nj5lry5KkSal22Oo9VGvQ,Cayla L.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,I came here a couple of times from last summer to September and had their 5 - 7. I loved their 1$ oyster promotion. The promotion was available as long as you bought a drink with or without alcohol. The service was great and the environment is amazing for girlfriend dates. I would recommend people to come here to enjoy their promos and definitely sit by their window. They also occasionally have a DJ for certain days during 5-7!
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Unlike other people's reviews, I really loved this place. The wait time wasn't that long and the service was excellent. Their food was also delicious. We shared the appetizer platter at 5 people. It was 60$ for 6 different appetizers. The salmon tartare tasted great and came in a generous portion. You can also ask for more croutrons. The dessert was awesome and well made. The nutella moelleux was extremely soft and chewy. The drinks during 5-7 are cheap. The place itself was clean. Would definitely come back."
/user_details?userid=rd6nf8BVytmAhC09LvCsWQ,Melissa P.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The food is good. My favourites are The Smoked prosciutto with arugula pizza and penne with creamy mushroom sauce & smoked prosciutto. You can tell I like prosciutto lol. They have a nice lunch special that includes salad or soup. Today I ordered the pasta & the soup of the day. The creme of broccoli soup was delicious! I personally don't order cocktails in this Zibo because I didn't like the ones I tried in the past. Maybe the ones I try were too watery, not sure. But aside the cocktails, the food is pretty good!"
/user_details?userid=6yTV_iirY6r21EeTRGPGqA,Jolie C.V. H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Really like this place. It has a great sophisticated vibe without being too stuffy. Very family friendly even though it seems to have a great bar area. Discovered this place several months ago while staying at the Alt Hotel.  The penne mushroom pasta is great. The pizzas are good, too.  They also have different specials like $1 oyster, ladies happy hour, Sunday family pasta nights etc., so check out their website for the location you will be going to as they vary. What I particularly love is that they have grilled salmon and vegetables on the CHILDREN's MENU!!!  It's so hard to find healthy options for kids. Thank you, thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart!"
/user_details?userid=ujOwZo999jM6bhkSXOX61w,Uyen D.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,I went there to celebrate my birthday with a few friends actually it was a pre-celebration.First of all it took about an hour to order food and when we asked the waitress if we could have bread it took her about 15 minutes to give it to us.At some point I did think that maybe she was really busy but in retrospect if she only had two tables to serve including ours.I cannot complain about the food that we all enjoyed our meals that I would give it a four-star (3.5) if it was only for the food.Once we finish ordering coma the waitress came back to ask us if you wanted to order their special oysters which were one dollar each.We ordered a dozen and we were given 11 oysters.Then my friend ordered a second glass of wine  red wine and it was very cold??We asked the waitress upon it because usually white wine is served cold... And she said that all their red wine was at that temperature.Not to mention it took forever to have to bill.I have tried other succursales of this restaurant before: i will never come back nor recommand this restaurant.This is the first 1/5 I have ever given...
/user_details?userid=eYp08DJGZflc5by6jT4saA,Stephanie M.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,"Great restaurant! We stayed at the Alt Hotel which is attached to the restaurant so it was perfect for a lazy evening! Staff was amazing! They were understaffed so a bit slow, but wasnt a bother to us in the slightest! They apologized ahead of time so it was completely understandable!"
/user_details?userid=rowGjtju6UO1g4GwrssH8Q,Michelle L.,"East Longmeadow, MA",5 star rating,Poutine and sangria-both red and white were delicious. Bar staff was friendly and offered great recommendations.
/user_details?userid=tlf2UekwKcDDgkuCZNg-bg,Ian C.,"Richmond, CA",1 star rating,"Zibo calls itself a ""Restaurant/Bar""--as a bar, it's fine. As a restaurant, it's a mess. The ambience: blasting EDM music that made conversation (and ordering) near-impossible. We also weren't told until we were half done with our cocktails and ready to order that they were out of about half the items on the menu (this was about 90 mins before closing time). A large chalkboard near the entrance listed what we thought were specials until we tried to order from it and were told it was the lunch menu (not indicated anywhere). The food we ended up getting (salad, onion soup, burger with too much BBQ sauce, pasta) was OK but nothing special for the price. The main positive was that it's in the same building as our hotel, so at least we had an easy walk home."

Been waiting 25 minutes now for someone to check up on us so we could order dessert . When we came in 3 different people tried to take our order and now ... no one"
/user_details?userid=sSFXp6HO0-eckiyP2-0m9w,Justin L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Celebrating a birthday as a large group, service was amazing.  Was worried about poor service from the previous reviews.  But they took care of us, cleared the table, explained the dishes well.   I started with the Chicken Spring rolls, decent but not something to write home about.   The braised beef ravioli was much better, extremely flavorful and a good portion.  Prices are very reasonable for Griffon town.Top grades for caring about kids and having a separate bathroom with a changing table.Street parking is tough, you may have to pay at the over priced ALT Hotel parking lot, try finding on Peel further north."

/user_details?userid=fmd85Ui7PgJ0naVgtyXyEw,Cubby R.,"Phoenix, AZ",4 star rating,"with only 2 tables in the place at 430, food was ok , service should have been 100 outstanding. should have been on us like white on rice, 2 things good, she kept water filled, she came back to check on us after meal delivered, but when we asked for ketchup, by the time she brought it out, i had finished my fries, and we also had to ask for the check, rather than her returning to finalize us or offer dessert perhaps, which we did not need today. but we did need our check.  T.I.P.S.= to insure prompt service. 3 stars seem harsh but i cant give it a 5 star.  also 530pm  the only diners in the place. that is good clue"
/user_details?userid=BpHrVG_nZ0s-tXg3lx56zA,Be P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,Food are not very relevant of this resto. It seems to be overpriced for the quality. Service is a little bit long for only a few customers.
/user_details?userid=SSkUSahuc1nf1eYF3gQAow,Kirk F.,"Lake Worth, FL",4 star rating,"Very good food, after several visits they were able to prepare and deliver consistent meals, drinks and service.I liked the Bloody Ceasar, Thai Salad, Zibo Salad and the gourmet Poutine."
/user_details?userid=Z7xuJ9P_rMtBvi4aFmP7zw,Fouad B.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I had a very bad experience, during my last visit. And since I didn't come back to this place. At the beginning all looked good; I was with my family, sitting indoors, behind the bar. We were enjoying our time. We ordered food, and once it came, a sudden black flies infestation came along! This was a clear sign of serious hygiene risk. We could do nothing to get rid of them, they were everywhere, all over our food... when I pointed it out to the waitress , she replied that she could do nothing about it and that's a normal situation. She advised me to contact the manager by email, which I did. When, I suggested they contact pest control services; she never replied back."
/user_details?userid=GyEJ8fjx3J5HbgdwlbQJ0A,Ramona S.,"Wethersfield, CT",3 star rating,"Had a quick dinner here with a friend last Friday night while staying at the Hotel Alt. It's A sleek, trendy spot with great indoor and outdoor seating, and super convenient location for hotel guests. During our visit, we split an appetizer of wings (on the smaller side, but tasty) and a pasta dish that sounded great on paper, but unfortunately, didn't end up liking.Our waiter was extremely understanding and quickly put in another order for a chicken burger  (which was delicious) without any trouble. Aside from that, he was very friendly, funny, and conversational. He gave us advice on places to visit while in town and even got rid of a huge spider that showed up near our table.(Our hero!) Only wish we got his name so I could shout him out personally. :)"

/user_details?userid=DfeWkDeU8jXvZ0LMOGiCHQ,Christine K.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Was there for dinner last night, service and food were both terrible. I have been to their brossard location many times and have never been disappointed however last night was truly terrible. I will definitely not be going back to this location."
/user_details?userid=ptlSqnNPiYQLGJMrn7iR8Q,H D.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,We were staying in the hotel in the same complex as the restaurant and didn't feel like going out for dinner. So we ordered takeout from ZIBO and it was surprisingly good.  The linguine with artichokes and feta was fresh and flavourful and the penne with creamy mushroom sauce was delicious.  The order was prepared promptly too.
/user_details?userid=vuqHrPneAYZzcTHRoQIavg,paul a.,"Prospect Heights, IL",2 star rating,Had their fully dressed pizza. This was not good pizza. Plenty of toppings but the crust had no body. I rolled it up like a tortilla to eat it. Pass...unless you like pizza tortillas.
/user_details?userid=nrBjN2j6G54UPU8N8O43wg,Igor K.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,Went to Zibo for lunch - ordered salmon. Specifically warned the waiter to ask the chef to make sure the salmon is not dry.However the salmon was dry and bland and came with grilled peppers and rice that tasted too strong for the fish.My second visit there and both times disappointing.
/user_details?userid=1TIDqlO1Q0bmJrni8EJXSQ,Corey M.,"Wells, ME",1 star rating,"Had lunch here on Sunday and it was the worst service of any restaurant that I have ever been to. Ever. After 90 minutes, the server came over with some bread, with no comment on the food. After another 20 minutes, he came by to check if we had gotten our appetizer. We had not.They proceeded to re-enter the order for the appetizer and entrees at the same time, and delivered them all at once.It was so slow that it was almost comical. Thankfully, it was a warm summer weekend and we were able to enjoy the weather with an outdoor table. And we were not in a rush.Unfortunately for Zibo, their service had been poor the first couple visits, and this ensured that I will never dine here again.Do not go here unless you have a couple hours to kill, and you are looking to find amusement in the slowest service ever."
/user_details?userid=OP7nO0dIaYW0O6DYX8-azQ,Charles H.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"It's pricey for the quality of the food, located on the first floor of the Alt Hotel, in an industrial and still under development neighbourhood... I had the Portobello Burger, nothing spectacular, my companion had the penne, she was not impressed, neither was I. Decent customer service..out of my list"
/user_details?userid=jrV3hEXXYstsjyrYDB2eWg,Ptra S.,"Mono, Canada",2 star rating,"Apparently being the correct demographic for this place, I recd a coupon for a free drink in the mail. Coupons are always challenging for staff to treat graciously. So a fair test for trying a new place. They failed miserably though the Rickard's white I had was nice."
