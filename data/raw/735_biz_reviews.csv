/user_details?userid=NDhDMKqSiBc0L06jKlFnmg,Nancy H.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"My family and friends dined here the other night and, man, it was good! I was instantly attracted to the cool blue and white decor, and the blue mosaics inside. Very clean and crisp and ""Grecian"" in its aesthetics. And open and airy, too, with an open concept and a kick-ass outdoor patio, too. (Despite the nice weather, we opted to dine inside. As nice as the patio is, it's still located on the corner of some busy streets, and we didn't want to see and hear the cars going by as we dined. This is a personal bias, of course; many folks prefer the patio and it is a popular place to eat one's meal here. It's often pretty packed here). Our server was super nice, and all our dishes were fresh and good: my kid and I shared the chicken souvlaki platter (grilled chicken with broccoli ad potatoes. Plain but delicious and very healthy, too), as well as the Petro salad (it was huge! and very good). Others in our party had the moussaka (I tried it and it was delicious. Huge portion, and 2/3 was taken home), a Greek salad (also huge and delicious with a substantial block of feta cheese on top), and some kind of sausages that were to die for. We were all too full for dessert.I see other reviewers commented on the high prices here. Our meals were decently priced but I did note that their fish offerings - of which there are MANY - are quite expensive. However, one of our friends who dined with us said she's eaten here often before and had various fish here and it's always been super fresh and good and definitely a large enough portion for two people, FYI. As others have mentioned, it is great that this place is BYOB. Note that the SAQ store is but a few steps away, just west on Sherbrooke. Can't get more convenient that that!"
/user_details?userid=hwjdmZMyaVcvHZY9IK-VEQ,Stephen S.,"West Bloomfield Township, MI",4 star rating,Very good food and service. Had the snapper with delicious veggies  and roast potatoes. My wife has the mussels and fries. Mussels on the small side but fries were excellent. Bonus is the BYOB with negligible $2 corkage. Will return again.
/user_details?userid=HFnQXWNqYyX_mURHoRhsOw,Wendy H.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,Loved loved loved. Great staff great food.  I wish they had one in the states. If you arrive before prime time the noise level is perfect. Once the large tables fill up the volume understandably picks up.  Brest Greek food I've had anywhere.
/user_details?userid=raqTx1Tj-wTMs25mcDPMxQ,Monica M.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",4 star rating,Pretty good place... nice ambiance & decor. Plates are flavourful but not very big. On the pricey side. Service is good. Cool location in Westmount. Most importantly: its bring your own wine!!!    Enjoy!
/user_details?userid=in66KTIli5TiIAw99ewd5w,Peter P.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I really had high hopes for Petros, mostly because my name in greek is Petros. The location and decor are both amazing and I really like the entrance area before walking into the main restaurant. It is a bit crowded depending where you are seated and since it is just one long seating area noise travels a lot. The service was great for us. I read that it was a problem for others but our waiter was superb. *Full disclosure* as a Greek I expect a lot from Greek restaurants, especially when the prices are on the higher end side. We started off with fried zucchini and some tzatziki. The zucchini was okay not overly oily like some other restaurants I've tried. The tzatziki however wasn't thick like it should be. Traditional Tzatziki is made with only greek yogurt so it should have a thick consistency, many restaurants substitute part of the greek yogurt for sour cream because it is cheaper. I expect it from Marathons and cheap greek fast food places but I for more upscale greek restaurant they should have 100% greek yogurt tzatziki. For the main course I ordered Moussaka and a side order of fries. Moussaka is a traditional Greek dish kind of like a lasagna but substitute the pasta for eggplant and potatoes. And then the cheese for béchamel sauce. It's my favourite Greek dish hands down. The portion was massive and honestly it was pretty good. They used lamb meat instead of beef which gives it an interesting taste and the potatoes eggplant and zucchini weren't over cooked and mushy, something that often happens. It was a bit on the salty side but all in all best part of the meal. As for the fries, they were good but came cold which was disappointing. For desert we had a few loukoumades which were on the doughy side, rather than being light and fluffy. To sum it up, there are a lot of better Greek restaurants at half the price, so it will be difficult to justify a return visit to Petros."

I was against it. I've visited many restaurants both in Montreal and abroad...but family decided so I capitulated.There is no decent or fair or acceptable reason to serve microwave moussaka and change what? $25 -$27 dollars a for it?  How do I know? Ask your waiter who felt horrible doing so. Boiling hot outside, frozen meat inside...yup. Then what ? Yes $18 for oily soft, cold fried zucchini.Maybe this was a rare imported zucchini from the rain forest or simply a sad way of getting extra $ from trusting customersSeriously- whomever may respond, location is great, concept is great, decor is fun. Be honest and turn this to a proper place to eat..."
/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",3 star rating,"I heard good things about this restaurant and when I finally tried it , I was a little disappointed that it didn't live up to what I had heard. However, this is not to say it was a bad experience overall , it is just not my favourite , especially with such great greek food options in montreal that are alot less expensive. So first off, the decor inside is actually very nice and has a nice atmosphere , with lots of seating without feeling like you are crowded in, even though the restaurant was full to capacity, so that was nice. (Great for large groups , but even if you are just two, definitely make a reservation). Another positive point was that service was outstanding , they didnt miss a beat and were so friendly and attentive to all the tables and really make you feel welcome. The food itself tasted fresh and wasnt bad but It was definitely overpriced.  We started with the assortment of greek dips (which was way overpriced for what you get and does not come with Pita to dip into it , which was odd to me), the dips were not bad , their Tzatziki was solid though (very good job on the Tzatziki!). We also had the spanakopita to share and that was absolutely delicious ! The main meals were less impressive. My boyfriend had the lamb chops with veggies but he said they really lacked alot in flavour and really didnt stand out. I had the Moussaka , which was not too bad , it had more going in the way of flavour but was definitely not he best I have had. Both main dishes tasted like the ingredients were fresh and prepared with care but the problem was more in terms of not enough flavour and that the prices were kind of high for what you are getting. However, what does help to make up for the prices is that this place is a bring your own wine so thats nice to be able to do that. I would encourage anyone to go and try this out for themselves though as it may just be a matter if opinion."

/user_details?userid=Gc3iwri5IIl4RDYsjGyGjw,Ralph L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,The atmosphere and service and food are great but the prices are way too high. A small order of calamari is way too much.
/user_details?userid=rwcT60z8fuOgbqtYOS0RLQ,Mitchell P.,"Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Canada",4 star rating,BYOW. This is a nice restaurant with table on the main floor and a lower level. Ambiance is nicer on main level but is still ok below. The food was good and so was the service. Prices were highish for what they offer. I would go back but nothing spectacular. The best part is that because it's a bring your own wine it brings the whole experience up.

/user_details?userid=FPPXD00gg_exGRCt3xwxdg,Sandy P.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,"It is ok. Nice ambience and very good service. Food ok, a bit bland. Don't think I would go back because  expensive. Value not quite there. There are better Greek fish restaurants at this price point."
/user_details?userid=kzXh1wIcCekofvPH5PGBgw,Gene K.,"Westmount, Canada",2 star rating,"Been here twice.Nice location,lovely terrace. Staff are friendly but a bit inefficient.  Food..as per other reviews, its ok but uninspired. Starters tried...taramasalata is excellent, grilled mushrooms are quite good but a bit bland, hit them with some oil and fresh lemon. Fried zucchini is ok...first time they were totally limp,most recently they were crispy but totally bland like the mushrooms, no seasoning at all.Main courses...the fish, grilled Porgy is consistently very good, grilled to perfection and nicely seasoned.The grilled lambchops were pretty awful, stay away from them, it appears the chef really has no ability to cook lamb well.I asked for them to be cooked rose but they came blue, even the waiter said they were blue not rose,completely raw and zero seasoning, absolutely no flavour. What was kind of shocking was Chesterman in her Gazette  review of the place a few days earlier had the exact same problem with her lamb...obviously they didn't bother to use her review as a learning experience. Lastly, even though the lamb was totally improperly cooked and inedible, no offer was made for any kind of discount or complimentary dessert etc. I would eat here again but I can only recommend the taramasalata, porgy  and maybe the greek salad. Btw...I noticed that another table had to send their grilled shrimp plate ( 4 shrimp for $36) back for further grilling."
/user_details?userid=JLSFLs1vn4dVURgikptvRQ,Arnie S.,"Hampstead, Canada",4 star rating,"Good experience at Retros.  We are fans of Greek fish restaurants and frequently visit three different ones in the city.  Retros ranks well amongst them.  The place is awesome, although not suitable for a romantic dinner as it is a friendly, active place.  The waiter and service were excellent.  Bread service with three types of toasted breads - nice.  Good salad with great feta cheese - better than most.  The waiter suggested only half portions of salad and zucchini chips which we appreciated.  The chips were crispy and not oily.  Plate of beans we ordered were excellent.  Sea Bass topped it all of and was perfectly grilled and seasoned.  Can't ask for much better!  Passed on dessert as the food was more than ample."
/user_details?userid=YrjkSaxkPIRFCRKWOunwXQ,Casey K.,"Scottsdale, AZ",2 star rating,"I tried this place with hesitation, due to the below average reviews online, but because I liked their other location when I was last in town.  Unfortunately, it was a mistake.  I should've trusted the reviews.  First off, my friend called and spoke to the owner to make the reservation.  When we arrived, we were not in the books.  This is the second time this has happened to her, and I was there for both of them.  No excuse.  The service was extremely slow and the food arrived cold.  Really cold.  It's a shame because it really has potential.  It's a great location, lovely little place and decent prices.  The taste of the food wasn't bad, but being extremely slow and ice cold will not keep them in business here for long.  Many restaurants have come and gone in this location.  They better get it together soon, or they will be gone too."
