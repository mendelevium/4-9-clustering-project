It was ready for pickup the pickup time with just a few minutes delay for final prep and package, during which we settled our bill. Not that we mined this, as it ensured that our food was hot and not laying around getting cold. On to the food, our order consisted of a sampling of an entree of a Brik, a crisp thin triangle fried dough wrapping an egg with a runny yolk inside it. Sumptuous is the word that describes it best. Second course, a trio of salads: Tunisian, Houria and Chicken. All were tasty, refreshing and seasoned well, making the refreshing with a bit of a floral note. Our main course was a Lamb Tanjine. The lamb was cooked down to tender perfection. Its juices flavored by the red peppers and onions that cooked along with it. It was accompanied by a vegetable couscous, which also had red peppers and carrots in it, giving it hint of sweetness to it that countered the meatiness of the lamb. We chose to pair our meal with a lovely medium body red wine from the Landguedoc-Roussillon region of France, Domaine d'Aupilhac Languedoc Montpeyroux Les Cocalières, 2018. This wine, had just the right amount of fruit to it, without being jammy and finish with a slight acidity that refreshes your palate with out being eye opening. Pleasant to drink on its own, it paired well with the delicate flavours of our dishes. We ended our meal with a traditional mint tea and fine bit sized baklava. A fitting end to a fine meal that was comforting on a winter night."

The service was slow, it took more than 1h30 to get our main dish. There was a baladi show (we even participated!) on this Saturday evening, that was clearly the highlight of the night."
