/user_details?userid=ahDxPzmaQuSOQtQMvZryZw,Anthony B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here on a Saturday evening and it was very empty, I found it surprising. The host was super nice and friendly.There were a lot of different kinds of Mac and cheese to choose from. I liked the variety. I'd also be interested in trying their Mac poutine out of curiosity.I ordered a steak and onion Mac and cheese with fries on the side. The Mac came out piping hot in a reasonable amount of time and was larger portion than I expected. The pictures online makes it look small but it's deceiving. It was just enough for me and I'm a big eater. The Mac was gooey and cooked great. I loved the cheese and there was a good amount of meat in there. The fries were ok, they weren't anything special and I didn't really come here for them anyway.For the price it's not bad. I would like to come here during the week and see how popular it is. I feel like this is maybe a hidden gem around these parts."
/user_details?userid=KcFMI-hsr2Em7whfI4OM5g,Katya P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time since I love anything to do with cheese and pasta!We came on a Saturday around 2pm and the place was totally empty. I actually thought it was closed but there was a sign on the door to come through another entrance. This restaurant seems to share the same kitchen and space as a Greek restaurant.The space is modern and clean, mix of high table chairs, bar stools and banquets. The menu offerings are perfect for what you would expect from a restaurant that specializes in mac and cheese. There are many choices along with burgers and sandwiches as well.We got to try a philly mac and cheese, the 4 cheese macaroni and a burger- Everything was delicious and fairly priced.The regular mac and cheese is very creamy and mild, I would have liked something with slightly sharper cheddar but it was still a treat and very decadent.I would recommend this place for a quiet lunch if you happen to be in the neigborhood. If you are driving before of limited parking, and it is metered.Next time we will try Poutineville which is by the same owners and right next door:)"

/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",5 star rating,"AFSGDFHBJC.This is my favourite restaurant in Montreal. I love Mac and Cheese and it was so good here. So cheesy and warm. I am still dreaming about it. This is the mac and cheese that was missing from my life.I came here for my anniversary with my boyfriend. He got the Brie Wild burger and he said it was 10/10. Flavourful and filling. Plus great value since he gets fries and mac and cheese as sides with the burger. The staff was very nice and the restaurant is very pretty. It has a nice cozy feel with the dimmed lights and the wood walls. They do have a tv in the middle of the room which I don't really understand because it doesn't seem to fit in if there is no sports game on.They were playing the cooking channel and the cook was making jello dessert for the holidays  and it looked weird.Aside from all that, you need to try this mac and cheese!!"
/user_details?userid=DlJtYNaO_kZycxChjPx6ug,Mardiros B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Wow now this place knows how to make a real MAC & CHEESE. You have to try the fried Mac balls, amazing. I ordered sausages and I got so much more, grilled peppers, mushrooms, caramelized  onions, Kalamata olives and mix green lettuce."
/user_details?userid=kO5fm0mI2WOzUYn1WCxmjw,Ronney R.,"San Antonio, TX",4 star rating,"This place is Good but not great. I didn't try the Mac n cheese rather, i tried two gyros & this is NOT the place for a good gyro. The salad & fries were really good. Lesson: Stick to the burgers & mac n cheese! But this place is really nice & very clean. And those are some of the cleanest bathrooms I've ever seen! Cheers!"
/user_details?userid=hRdl9qivZonhHrI7umhifQ,Hennie Rose D.,"Queens, NY",4 star rating,Yummy mac and cheese! Mac and Cheese may be my favorite entree of all time. Macbar was delicious and gave a variety of different twist to their mac and cheese. It was a generous portion and the price was great too.
/user_details?userid=wipLfdbfvPIGZ3N94Bpqzg,Elena M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,The place is really chic and has amazing mac and cheese. I had their grilled cheese plate that comes with fries or salad and a mac and cheese. It was amazing !  The bar owner came to greet us and made jokes and was very nice. Definitely a place to go !
/user_details?userid=RIM6BfaP7ex_AYzd6UemqA,Khalil P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Great spot to eat! Wanted to go here for a while and finally did. Decided to get the fromage fromage fromage Mac and cheese. It tasted really good, hot, cheesy and filling. I also tried the Phillymac Mac and cheese and that was good too. The host/waitress was really nice and helpful. The owner was also nice and they both gave an excellent service. Overall this is a great spot and I have to come back to try more things."
/user_details?userid=nPXVprOV3ioobtAc_s7-CA,Brian T.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"VERY good experience and food! The place was not crowded at all, but that may be due to construction outside that made the place hard to see from the street. The menu is  mostly mac and cheese, with some sandwiches. I had the mac and cheese with smoked meat, which was AWESOME! Giant portions for around $10. Wifey had the classic mac and cheese which she also enjoyed. The service was good, and prices perfect. If you're into macaroni and cheese, definitely check this place out!"
/user_details?userid=5JkrkzDxJ9U19dqY4_LQSg,Mike D.,"St-Leonard, Canada",3 star rating,"I finally got to try this place tonight, there wasn't a wait so that was a big plus on a Saturday night in Montreal. It had a nice laid back feel with high tables and a nice bar in the center. Judging from the name these guys specialized in Mac and cheese, so we took a few.We took the smoked meat mac and cheese, with a honey bacon mac and cheese and a all meat lover mac and cheese with BBQ sauce drizzle. I also had he pleasure of trying there chèvre burger, a burger stuffed with goat cheese, and there beer batter fries.... these were very good!! Out of all the Mac and cheese my personal favourite was the BBQ drizzle meat lover, the mix of meat and sauce was delicious a perfect fit. The other Mac and cheese lacked a little salt in my opinion. The food was tasty but the problem here was they screwed up our order a few times brining plates back and fourth. Someone came to apologize but the wait for the food was way to long. I'm glad I finally go to try this joint."
/user_details?userid=90fyHymYCrcnfsAn7CDGXw,Stefanie R.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Disappointed after the place got 4 stars. Had the 3 cheese Mac & Cheese. Was too bland. It needed a kick, like a strong cheese. I added Tabasco and it made the dish.  My friend had the Phili Mac & Cheese and there was more onions and mushrooms than there was meat. She was not satisfied."
/user_details?userid=ezm-p3aTTKnhvArH8zHS3A,Skye T.,"Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Canada",5 star rating,"When I googled Mac n' Cheese near me this was the restaurant I got! Have to say I'm thrilled with the experience. My friend and I went around 12pm, we were seated right away and the service was great! The different varieties of Mac were unique and delicious! Portion was great and with the purchase of a Mac dish, you get 3$ off the cocktail menu ;) the restaurant itself has really nice decor, would definitely go back again!"
/user_details?userid=TaGiJNqFXPJmNGL5SamJUQ,Kip G.,"Greenville, SC",5 star rating,"Great place just a few minute walk from my hotel! I visited on a Monday afternoon and was the only guest there at first. (Missed the lunch rush and the supper rush!!) The server was awesome. He made me a Mojito (with love, as he said ), and gave me time to figure out the menu. Which is all in French...fyi. But, I figured it out mostly and then used Google translate for the words I didn't know. The dish I ordered was fabulous! It had macaroni, cheese, and steak and bacon.  A great, large portion that made up for a missed lunch and held me over for the rest of the day. I finished it off with a cup of coffee to warm me up for the freezing walk back to my hotel. This was a nice place to find, and I'll try to come back on my next trip to this city!"
/user_details?userid=jhTtZbkU9f_L1EgsoTV1zw,Maxine L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The pesto mac and cheese was a bit to creamy and the taste of pesto was barely there. The regular mac and cheese was also lacking of taste, but was still good."
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,Deliciously cheesy and filling. Got take out once and legit died and went to heaven. Their portions are generous and the variety of the mac n cheeses is impressive (few options for vegetarians).
/user_details?userid=UymJXlnYm_0Nq7v6kk8vgg,Lesley D.,"Pasadena, CA",5 star rating,Amazing food and great service. A huge variety of Mac and cheese dishes and grilled cheese sandwiches. Total comfort food spot!
/user_details?userid=I9-wA_vOFZTFSj4fAnia9g,Chelsea A.,"Napa, CA",5 star rating,"This is exactly what we all need: a restaurant dedicated entirely to Mac and cheese. It's located in a fairly nondescript part of town, and by the time we got there (after 8:00) it was one of the only open places on the block. We really felt like VIPs. Our server was very attentive and kind, letting us sample a generous amount of wines to ensure we had our perfect pairing. I highly recommend the Lisboa Mac and cheese. The chorizo is more like kielbasa, but it's great nonetheless and adds the flavor missing from so many macaroni and cheeses. Try it with the Mexican Petite Sirah. Definitely a hidden gem in YUL!"

/user_details?userid=crJjv-3S3pXkYdL8qQQhpQ,Ken S.,"Eldridge, IA",5 star rating,"We saw Costa on the morning news talking about his restaurant. We love mac and cheese, so decided to eat lunch there. When we arrived much to our delight there was Costa.  He treated us like family. We ordered the cheese burger mac and cheese, it was great and portions were large. Costa treated us to a special treat he had as a child. It was made with watermelon and was wonderful.The restaurant was very clean and well kept. Stop by, you won't be sorry!"
/user_details?userid=lyGit7jmiPXz3CQMeoIx1A,Andrew K.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,This is a lowkey gem in Montreal and I'm so glad that I found it. I got their Macburger with double beef for only $13 which included a Mac and cheesed stuff burger with a delicious side plate of  Mac and cheese and fries. Value is outstanding and the servers were amazing. This is a must try if you're ever in the area!
/user_details?userid=tejVQo9pK9kLfxtKkR5bzQ,Carolyn B.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"My two friends and I traveled to Montreal for the weekend and were absolutely starving after we arrived in the city later in the evening.  Our airbnb was close to Rue Ontario so we decided to look for a restaurant to eat in.  We happened to come across Le Macbar et Fromage by chance.We were greeted promptly and with a welcome smile.  Our server was pleasant as were all the other staff in the restaurant.I ordered the Bacon fumé au miel, my other friends ordered the sandwich végétarien andthe sandwich au steak respectively.  Our meals arrived pretty fast.  My dish was excellent!  Loved the taste and I especially liked that the meal was hot right until the last bite.  Both of my friends were very happy with the bread their sandwiches were served on.  My friend that ordered the steak said she probably wouldn't order the steak again but she was very happy with the rest of the meal including the bread the steak was served on as I mentioned above.I would recommend this restaurant and would gladly return here if I had the opportunity."
/user_details?userid=kBeO-K9HtRAGDVKkzGCEzg,Greg A.,"Dallas, TX",5 star rating,"Tried Macbar et Fromage one evening for a quick bite. their signature Mac & Cheese was excellent as well as their Le Boss and Sloppy Joe Grilled Cheese sandwiches and side salads. More food than we could eat and we were not disappointed in our choices. Staff were very helpful, especially Trisha who answered not only our questions about the menu but also helped us with figuring out getting about and around Montreal. We'll make another stop here or maybe try out the same owner Greek cafe next door before we leave Montreal."

/user_details?userid=MNx6SgG8JnfsWRQKSpyBZw,Christian M.,"South Windsor, CT",5 star rating,"The Macbar was a big surprise. My fiancé and I went on a weekend at 3 expecting it to be very crowded but we walked right in and got a table which was very appreciated. Our waiter was extremely kind and courteous, he asked us where we were from and how we liked Montreal and we chatted with him about his Sicilian roots. My fiancé got the classic Mac and cheese and I got the volcano Mac and cheese. Both were incredible. Some of the best Mac and cheese I've ever eaten. It has a very rustic and hip atmosphere. I would highly recommend it."

So annoyed that it is so far from me and that Montreal traffic and construction make getting here a nightmare! The mac & cheese was so good and I loved the presentation in the cast iron pan! The staff was very friendly and took care of us. the prices are great. The cocktails were fun and tasty! The room has tons of windows for nice light during the day, and I am sure there is great people watching when it is not -30Celcius! Cannot wait to return!"
/user_details?userid=3UkchN-yItw6w-31hX3PGA,Derek W.,"Chicago, IL",1 star rating,"Patently the worst meal I have had in Montreal, except for that one time at St Hubert... The mac and cheese was passable at first, but as the grease accumulated in my mouth it got worse and worse. The chorizo starter was greasy, my Montrealais mac and cheese greasy, and my partner's sloppy joe was essentially flavourless, but for the overwhelming taste of grease. He couldn't pick it up with his hands, it was too greasy... He had a side of regular mac and cheese that was sitting in grease. Nice people though and a very cute barman..."

I said thank you very much for letting me know, I will come by tomorrow. When I arrived there it was closed with a piece of paper on the door, saying they were not open for business for Thanksgiving. Great service."
