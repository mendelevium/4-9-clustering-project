/user_details?userid=7PTwhPEM7VWclYIS_1dSiw,Jéssica C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Me and my boyfriend always  come here  for lunch! It's a great alternative from the other Warehouse restaurants because its never crowded and the music isn't that loud. The Mont Royal one is almost a nightclub, you can't talk to people, but the St Laurent one is great! The playlists are awesome they aways play good music and the ambiance is very fun. The decoration is also really cool with the Jack  Daniels bottles as lamps and the christmas lights all over the  place! The food is not  AMAZING but some things  in the menu are really good! I'd recommend the hamburger  (Le Constructeur)  which is a great choice  because its tasty, filling and one of those ""can't go wrong"" options! Or the braised beef sandwich, also a good option.The donuts are actually REALLY GOOD too! I'd get them as dessert if I were you :"
/user_details?userid=kjpmHZuRhq6ywBtNpJUFaQ,Joey C.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",4 star rating,"In Toronto, Warehouse is notorious for having huge lines all day everyday, because everything on their food menu is only $5.95 per dish!LOCATION & DECOR: 5/5Located right in the centre of St Laurent Blvd, this place is so convenient! We were staying right across the street so it was our first stop after a long trip here.Very hip decor (as all the Warehouse restaurants) & played indie-rock music.FOOD & DRINKS: 3/5 (but +1 for low price)Big variety of dishes for $5.95.Crispy chicken wings: Not the meatiest wings &  light on the sauce. Comes with ~10 wingsFish tacos: Pretty good but definitely needed more sauce.Crispy chicken burger: Really thick piece of chicken! The bun could've been toasted though.The standout here are the drinks! If you're bar hopping on St Laurent you should definitely stop here. The drinks are super cheap compared to the other bars in the area.$3.95 for shooters, cocktails starting at $6.50. Pints for around $4.95.SERVICE: 4/5Came at a weird time on a Monday so they only had two servers working. The service at most warehouse restaurants are often poor but the two servers we had were lovely! TRY THIS PLACE!"

Meals are an AMAZING price and I throughly enjoyed mine. I got a meal and a drink and I only costed me $12.59. It has a really good atmosphere with the music being a good volume.

/user_details?userid=UFa4OjrdeVo5gYaoL24vxA,Julia L.,"Great Neck, NY",2 star rating,The food is good for the money but I have to say THE SERVICE IS AWFUL!!! The hostess was extremely rude and the servers spend more time chatting at the bar then remembering your orders. It takes forever for the food to come and to get the waiters attention to order. Every time it's like pulling teeth to get fed and leave. Never been anywhere with worse service in my life.
/user_details?userid=bemY1DWj0rOLIPUBRnfkjg,John C.,"Wyckoff, NJ",5 star rating,The drinks are disturbingly cheap. I am absolutely shook. Great place to start the evening and watch music videos with the lads. Watch out for the kitty litter on that ground!
/user_details?userid=BMZNFLx1ZYrxljNwPAtiCw,Shannon H.,"Mechanicsburg, PA",5 star rating,"Great vibe, food and drinks! Definitely recommend! The staff was friendly and we will be back next time we're in the area."
/user_details?userid=L3n36ywcgzgdAK8a81yXDQ,Brittany L.,"Worcester, MA",5 star rating,"Down home bar with cool atmosphere and decorations. Very friendly and cool waitstaff. PB&J drink specialty (Pabst and a shot of Jameson) hit the spot. Interesting drink menu, did not even look at the food to be honest."
/user_details?userid=wJxp8Gmrgi8E_QA4ZeRxcQ,Brad H.,"Toronto, Canada",1 star rating,"Visited El Furniture Warehouse on New Year's day.  The bar was at about 20% capacity and we were seated right next to the door where there was a substantial draft from outside.  We moved to the back but there were no clean tables available so we asked the server to clear a larger one for us.  She assured us that she would serve us as soon as possible, which turned into an extended wait.  Once seated, she had cleared all the menus so we waited patiently to receive a menu.  The menus did not come.  Over 45 minutes waiting and still no drink order, no menus, debris still on the table.  The final straw came when the server exited the kitchen with a Caesar salad and came to our table asking if it was ours.  At that point, it was clear that we weren't getting served.  We left shaking our heads.  I've been in service for more than 10 years and can honestly say that this experience stands out as the WORST example of service ever!"

/user_details?userid=23Id6rdeBzXf0wUFXhzSOQ,T C.,Hong Kong,2 star rating,"Awful service, they didn't even ask for a drink and was reminded again before getting us the water we asked for. The server seemed pissed for us not tipping enough but tbf if you wanted us to tip generously at least give us a decent service. Food and drinks are definitely cheaper than other restaurants in the area but honestly there are a lot of options in MTL I would've rather pay a little extra for another restaurant with better service."
/user_details?userid=Fm7MuJN9vc4RajG7H8_COg,Sam C.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"Came here on a busy Saturday night on St.Laurent as it was the only place without a crazy line. This was obviously because of the terrible service. We were seated right away and then proceeded to wait for 20 minutes without a waiter so much as coming to our section. The surrounding tables were equally confused by the lack of attention by the server as we were all ready to order. Finally 30 minutes later as we all stood up to leave a server came and checked on us. We expressed that we were upset as we had not been checked on within the 30 minutes we had been there, to which the server responded ""oh perfect, goodbye."" So not only did we receive terrible service, but also terrible attitude when we expressed our frustration. We have been to the warehouse on rue Crescent without issue so clearly this new establishment has a lot of work to do to catch up with the rest of the franchise. Not impressed."
