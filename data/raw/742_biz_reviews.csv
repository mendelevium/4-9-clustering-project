They haven't quite come around to decor or how often you need to clean in general, nor that cleaning the toilet is cleaning the whole surface. Hopefully these dudes will get there.The food echoed a similar vibe of bros in their twenties: it was affordable and designed for the person who's enjoyed a couple libations. The menu was abundant and straightforward. I appreciate that they have four clearly labeled veggie burgers (albeit they're all beyond meat). I had the protein burger (spicy with an egg on top) and had a hard time polishing it off: it was huge and it kept falling apart. The quality of the patty was nothing to write home about but the toppings were fun. My companions all found their burgers kinda meh but did the trick. With the fries I'm not sure my body could handle the greasiness of this endeavour but I'll qualify that as a personal problem. I think if you're looking for a good drunk burger this is a great option (they're also open late and deliver!) but I would avoid it if you're looking for a burger of serious quality."

Imagine being seized by this feeling one weekend and finding a spot conveniently near your place called Burgers 'N' Shakes. Sounds perfect, right? Very wrong. First, the food is ludicrously overpriced for the kind of casual joint it presents itself as. Second, this is one of the worst burgers and fries I've ever had in my life. I couldn't finish eating it after two bites. The fries were soggy, and looked and tasted like they had been left out for a week. The burger tasted like perhaps it was an old, frozen patty. Honestly, I'd rather have a burger from A&W or even maybe McDonalds than the burger I was served here."

What I really liked was the diversity of the menu - chicken and beef burgers, poutines, salads, shakes, etc., etc - the menu keeps going and going. I'm sure if you stop by, you will definitely find something to eat that you'd like. We got several different burgers, and liked all of them. They have very creative combinations of toppings for all tastes, including spicy peppers and sauces, fried eggs, bacon, etc. Even though our burgers were tasty and fresh-made, I would really like the patties to be a bit less salty. I admire that they season their ground beef, but they should go a little easier on salt... still very tasty though."

Portion are generous, you can't go wrong with their fried Chicken burgers. Fries are homemade and they are closing very late."
