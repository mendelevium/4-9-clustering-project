/user_details?userid=7PTwhPEM7VWclYIS_1dSiw,Jéssica C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I love this Brazilian bakery! As a Brazilian myself I go there every now and then to meet with friends over some  classic Brazilian snacks. My recommendations for the ones who haven't ever tried anything is the pão de queijo (cheese bread), pastel (kind of like empanadas but thiner and fried), coxinha (shredded chicken wrapped in a fried dough) and the carrot cake!If you're going for a full meal, I definitely recommend the Picanha sandwich! IT'S TO DIE FOR. The meat melts in your mouth, and it's just so tasty you will keep coming back for it. It's also kind of big so you might consider sharing.The staff is always super sweet and will speak to you in any language you like! Prices range from 4 - 10$ on average, but if I end up spending around  20$ total when I go!They have a special  of a soup, a savory snack and a dessert for 13$ too if I'm not mistaken! Definitely worth stopping by :)"

The staff is very nice and helpful.I also enjoy the fact that there are quite a few gluten-free friendly options. The cheese bread, the tapioca crepe, etc. Everything is delicious and flavorful. The desserts are sweet and copious. This time we took the savory meat pie with salad, tapioca crepe, meat & cheese pastels, cheese bread and some cakes. On other occasions I've had the passionfruit mousse and flan, which are also delicious. Definitely really enjoy this place and will keep coming back :) and you should too!"
/user_details?userid=05AH2UJKDAxTcJVOy3XPIg,Mohamed A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Authentic and upscale Brazilian street food and desserts. Relaxed atmosphere, Brazilian chef and clientele! They also have (meat) sandwiches and breakfast dishes and apparently they also serve set menu lunch. Found most of Brazilian street food essentials like Pao de Queijo, Coxinha, pastel and Mortadella in addition to a good selection of desserts. They were all tasty and authentic(only wish they were more generous with the portion of cheese in my pastel!)Prices of course are inflated. It's an upscale cafe in Montreal....Canada!One last point to note, call them before you go because sometimes the place is reserved for private parties. It may also get busy(with queuing) during week ends."
/user_details?userid=hw9y6fIOANlMFNrAHNFC8g,Shawn C.,"East Hampton, NY",4 star rating,"Cute small Brasilian eatery. Just had a yummy steak panini-like sandwich. Had soda from Brasil, and a delicious ducle de leche cake with vanille creme glacé. I am sitting out back at a quiet picnic table. A cute place with homemade sandwiches & desserts. I hope it survives, so many empty storefronts in the Village these days. I hope the landlords keep the rents reasonable for these Mom & Pop places. Everything can't be Starbucks, or can it ?"

/user_details?userid=z3bHy4MykD9bgmuzgGsNDg,Jenny P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I am really happy that i found another awesome cafe in MTL. I love the friendly and restful ambience of the cafe and they also have a mini terrace that you can enjoy the nice weather with great breads. Every bread is great and especially the ""Brazillian cheese-ball"" is my favorite one. You should know that MONDAY IS AN OFF DAY. And if you want to try diverse breads, you should go early, at least before 3pm. After that, there might be a few left. They also have a brunch set with reasonable price."
/user_details?userid=Zv_rMzv_8-c2-g0WtEXlTg,Bruno P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Perfect for getting together with tour friends and on top of that having an amazing Brazilian experience. All the pastries and sweets are  homemade and it makes me feel at home.
/user_details?userid=Gdyzk0Bq4CMsp8onOsdsdA,Serge N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Yes it's Brazilian cuisine, but more importantly it truly feels and tastes like comforting food you'd have in a family kitchen. Super laid back, yet clean and jolly atmosphere. Ask for the savoury menu, they frequently add new meat based dishes. Padoca offers a plethora of flavours you won't find anywhere else in town"
