It's still quite crowded even later at night.  I got the bring on the bacon crepe with extra veggies. This savory crepe was delicious! The fillings were lovely and the size was pretty massive too. The price is a bit higher than most places, but I feel like the portions are decently reflective of it. The crepe itself was very delicious as well! The salad paired well with everything overall. It really felt like a full but healthy meal!I'll definitely be back again!"
/user_details?userid=fbRdDZciw4Y8pgujgbwEMg,Karen L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Been to Cacao 70 before in person of course, but ordering it for delivery is a whole different experience. The banana for the chocolate fondue was a little too unripe, the pineapple was a bit too sour. And there wasn't enough chocolate to go around. I tried to reheat the chocolate as well since by the time it arrived, it was pretty cold and hard. I think I'll wait for restaurants to open back up for physical sit down visits before I come back."
/user_details?userid=WEAKuClK0BjhjHWGunMXQA,Ann W.,"Northville, MI",2 star rating,"Instead of an afternoon shopping, we decided to stop by for dessert instead. To avoid the crowds, we selected a restaurant slightly away from the downtown core. As the name suggests, Cacao 70 specializes in chocolate-based desserts. In addition to a variety of hot chocolate drinks and shakes, the restaurant also offers dessert pizzas, waffles and crepes, ice creams, and fondues. Everything on the menu (and Yelp! photos) looked fantastic. Should I have the dessert pizza with a variety of chocolate and candied hazelnuts or the combination of chocolate and marshmallows? Would I be happier with the dark chocolate shake? Or should I get the fruit and chocolate-filled crepe, since I was in Montreal, after all?In the end, the triple chocolate fondue (dark, milk and white chocolates swirled together) beckoned. It was served with sliced bananas, pineapple chunks, strawberries, and waffle and brownie bits. I liked the fondue, although there was not enough chocolate for dipping. As well, the waffle bits were a bit cold and stale - sad.Service was okay. Instead of serving everyone at the same time, the plates were delivered when they were ready."

It was my first meal at a restaurant in Montreal. It was right downtown, not too far from the University. There weren't a lot of folks there. The waitress took orders and served. She spoke both English and French and helped us with making our orders. I told her that I wanted something that was both savory and sweet and she recommended whatever it was that I ordered. If I wasn't so full, I would have ordered it again. There's also free WiFi."

For a restaurant that is not busy AT ALL this Friday afternoon, it certainly is taking a long time for the waitress to return to my table. I guess my grumbling tummy can wait until she's done snapchatting. FINALLY received my cocoa/strawberry crepe... except... where's the ""filled with fruit""?! There was a small scoop in here. (See the flat bottom of my crepe!) cost cutting I guess. Truly unimpressed."
/user_details?userid=xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg,Jonny M.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"After checking out some live music, we were looking for a late night dessert spot. I've never been to Cacao 70 even though it's blown up recently and expanded all over Canada (Vancouver and Edmonton). This branch is located beside Mon Ami.We dropped in on a Friday (around 10:30pm) to find it reasonably busy. Love how late it's open till. The perfect place to cap off your night or to bring a date. The exposed brick and chic decor fits the ambiance perfectly.There's a food menu but really, you should be focusing all your attention on the desserts. There's an abundance of options (mostly chocolate oriented) including cakes, fondue, drinks, crepes, ice cream, sweet pizzas and dessert platters. The platters are meant to be shared ($12.50 to $31.95)!- Chocolate envy ($15.50) - quarter of a 12"" pizza with chocolate marshmallow, chocolate brownie bites, chocolate wafer, whipped cream and chocolate fondue. My favourite was the pizza. Cut a piece, add some ice cream and dip into the fondue. Yum!Will need to come back to try their dipped soft serve ice cream. 3.5 stars."

/user_details?userid=RwQUv7Cn61gTkPXcytSrSQ,Amy Yu T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I always come to this location for the sweets (NOT brunch). It has been over 5 years and I have yet to be dissatisfied. I come here quite often for date nights and the bf and I consistently order the same thing. There's just something about their waffles, the way they make it or the ingredients, that make their waffle taste a bit sweet and creamy, but crunchy and the same time. Paired with the ice cream and chocolate is just a delight. Because it's one of my classic go-to's for dessert for almost 5 years now, I'm giving it a full five stars. Just to clarify to avoid future deception, they drizzle chocolate on the waffles and not Nutella. And the whipped cream is very light. It fits my palette right because I do not like EXTREMELY sweet desserts. I find that it hides the flavour profile of other ingredients besides the sugar.And in restaurants like these, I do not give a rats ass (pardon my french) about the service. As long as I have the food and the water, you don't even need to smile to me."

It was a great spot for whatever chocolate dessert you wanted. You also had the choice of what intensity. However this place has completely changed. It's a fairly small menu on plasticized paper where half the words are erased. We actually had to compare our menus in English and french to read the descriptions, and all the English menus were like that. You also don't have the variety of chocolate they once offered. The service was pretty bad. We were 7 people, and the server refused to adjoin 2 tables right next to each other, so we can all sit together. It would difficult for her to pass and we understood so decided to wait a bit. One couple had a baby who was becoming fussy so they decided to order for take out. We ended up sitting separately. The half pizza was great with a generous amount of nuts, the volcano brownie was pretty good, loved the cheesecake (best from all). I did not like the milk hot chocolate. The glass is dipped in chocolate but there was so much chocolate that it became messy. The milk cooled down too quickly so the drink was chunky and not a smooth hot chocolate. Our hostess wasn't welcoming. Our server was polite. On a Saturday, it was full and busy. They should have more waiters. We weren't checked up, water wasn't refilled. I don't know if I'd go back here for desserts when they're are so many other places."
/user_details?userid=4ayVX0YKY3GSP2IICpLJXQ,Priscilla Y.,"Vancouver, Canada",4 star rating,"This was my family's choice for a final brunch in Montreal and although the sweet dessert items were delicious, improvements can be made on their savoury dishes. We ordered a meat lovers omelette, fire up the veggies crepe and a plain waffle. Both brunch dishes were served with fresh fruit and chocolate dip which was a nice mini appetizer before breakfast! The plain waffle is what stood out in this meal. It was fluffy, lightly sweet and buttery. It tasted great even without any toppings and was a great add on! The crepe was a quite flavourless but the eggs were done well and the omlette was huge for a good price. Dishes came very slowly even though it was not very busy that morning.Overall, I would love to try some more of their sweet options but their brunch is nothing to visit for."

It was not busy and the service was great! I had this delicious breakfast sandwich with egg, chorizo, cheese and tomato on a toasted seasame bagel. It came with some mixed green on the side and this really yummy sauce that was a little sweet so the flavor paired perfectly with the sausage and egg. To drink I got a Mexicocoa hot chocolate with a shot of brandy or rum (it was a darker liquor).The overall food presentation was really good, especially the hot chocolate which had cocoa sprinkled on it and came with a cinnamon sick. I wish we stayed in Montreal longer so I could have tried more food on the menu!"
/user_details?userid=3zdB0SSrXIDIgsrOmhdUtQ,Fatema Z.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I hate to be the first (I think) to write a bad review about this Montreal favourite - but unfortunately, my last visit there left me extremely disappointed.I have been to this location a couple of times in the past but from last Friday evening's experience, I feel the quality and standards have fallen tremendously.It didn't take us long to get a seat and were pleased when we were offered a lovely banquet. We ordered the 'Choco-Nut Waffle,' 'After Party Waffle' and a Banana Split to share. Immediately, just from the appearance of the waffle, we could see a difference.The waffle was extremely soggy and as if it had been made the previous day. The strawberries were tasteless, the banana's still a little frozen. On the menu, the toppings were described to have 'fresh strawberries, toffee banana, hazelnuts etc' - we weren't given a choice of ice cream flavour and the fruits were definitely not fresh! All the space was just filled by tasteless whipped cream. The melted chocolate too was not good -  not Nutella or comparable to that of its competitors. For the price and what was presented, we were all extremely disappointed and didn't even end up finishing, despite sharing. For a sweet-tooth like myself, that is saying something.I will not be back any time soon"
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This location is perfect for a cold winter evening located centrally downtown (right  by the atwater metro-walking distance). I came here on a Monday afternoon around 4:30 pm- I didn't need reservations-as the place was pretty empty. I was served right away with menus/water- which was nice. When we were actually ready to order- nobody came by to check up on us- so I literally had to flag down someone behind the counter to tell them we were ready to order.We ordered the : the savoury waffle (4/5) that came with ham, 2 sunny side up eggs, roasted mushroom, onions, white cheddar, bechamel sauce and maple syrup. This was plenty for a 2 people or a very hungry person (like me). The egg was a nice touch balancing out the maple syrup - sweet and savoury; the strawberry goat cheese salad (3/5) presentation was beautiful, but the portion size compared to the price of the meal was too small-salads are suppose to be filling! This would work as a side, not as a main course.For drinks: I had the champurrado (3/5)- a spicy dark hot choclate with a kick of cinammon topped with whip cream. It was a very nice drink, but since I am not a fan of dark chocolate- I couldn't finish the drink.; my friend had the tea- which was generic tea.The prices were reasonable with service tip.I am looking forward to trying out there dessert pizzas during my next visit!!"

It tends to get very crowded in the weekend evenings, so its preferable that you get there around 9pm to avoid the line up!Everything on their menu is good... I mean how can we go wrong with chocolate!One thing I suggest, avoid trying this limited time hot chocolate-earl grey drink, it wasn't that great.... see picture for reference.

I've been coming here since I was 15 (when I read a buzzfeed article about them having amazing hot chocolate so I convinced some friends to join) and I'm never disappointed in their food :) It's always well done and their waffles are the best I've ever eaten; they are super soft but in the edges they are crispy and I think that's how every waffle should be made. I've tried a lot of things in their menu but the one food that always out beats the others is the black and chocolate waffle! It has everything I love: ice cream and whipped cream and WAFFLES. It's served with little chocolate covered cereal which I never know how to eat them but I guess they're cute little additions. Another personal favourite is their fondue plate. It has a little bit of everything (fruits, brownies, waffles) and I think its worth the money. The service varies in all the locations but for the most part its pretty good. Although my family and I were once very disappointed at the service at this cacao 70 because it was just terrible; we didn't get water, utensils, the waiter barely came by to check on us, he took our order very late even though it wasn't busy at all, and when we asked to change for white chocolate he didn't mention that it was extra so we were surprised when we got the bill (we assumed it was free because it wasn't written anywhere). But the next time we went back we got the same waiter and it was way better service so I guess it wasn't his day. Anyways I highly recommend this place to come and chill with friends or family. It's a lovely dessert place and it will fill you up !"

There was only one cashier/server and one chef (who was making both the food and drinks). Several people just got up and left before their food arrived. We would have left too if not for half of our group already getting their food.Likewise, they got one of our orders wrong and we had to return one of the other plates because an ingredient was making her feel sick (one of the ingredients tasted like it had gone bad). They fixed the wrong order and asked to remake the other dish, but we didn't want to wait any longer and left it be."

I think I've been here 10 times!After checking out their new menu, my sister and friend ordered American-style hot chocolates, and the matcha chocolate fondue for 2. I ordered the choco-nut waffle, and immediately regretted not getting a hot chocolate when theirs arrived. (Though I was happy about this later on since it meant I wasn't in too much of a chocolate-induced food coma!)The service was friendly and quick, probably because it was a Monday night. It was half full compared to on weekends, when the line snakes out the door. Our water was constantly replenished, and also note that they like to keep this place warm, perfect for winter. The best part is that when I asked our waitress if we could switch one of the matcha fondue pots for a milk chocolate one, she happily obliged. Two thumbs up for that!"

And the mix batter was still leaking out so we advised the waitress she said they will make another order. Few minutes after, the waitress brought it back, yes they did make another waffle but everything else were from the previous plate, you can see the vanilla iced cream already half melted. The worst part is, they really did made sure the waffle is fully cooked... It turns out to be over cooked. You can see the burnt area on the waffle AND the banana. Instead of a sweet desert it turns out to be a bitter desert due to the burnt area. See picture below.So my advice to you, eat the raw waffle.. Don't complaint..."

The ambience of the place is nice; they have diner-style seats, a rustic feel with mood lighting, and an open kitchen where you can see the staff make the food. The service was good, and they had free Wi-Fi. There was also a collection of great art on the walls that you could purchase. We had the:1. Fruit and chocolate - a collection of fruit with dipping chocolate that comes with the meal. A great way to start off the meal, and the chocolate was really delicious, silky, and not too sweet, which complements the fruit well. 2. Croque Madame - delicious, creamy bechemel sauce, savory with a sweet hint from the drizzle of maple syrup. 3. Savoury waffle - basically the croque madame but on a waffle instead of bread. Good combination of sweet and savory with the ham and the maple syrup.Overall a great stop during our trip. I would be interested in coming back to try the dessert options as per their namesake. --Rating Rubric--5* - As good as it gets; goes above and beyond. I would come here again and again!4* - Worth checking out; a good value. No major complaints or only minor flaws that set this place back. I'm glad I tried it, but I might not come back here in lieu of trying somewhere new.3* - A few setbacks that soured the experience. Not the worst, but I wouldn't recommend it to friends.2* - Multiple setbacks that made me dislike the place.1* - I was personally offended by the people or services. Steer clear!"

It comes with bread, a fruit plate, and chocolate sauce to dip in. I would have been happy with just those three things but of course you have to order one of their fabulous entrees. I appreciated that they brought a small bucket of ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise. The first day we ordered the Spanish frittata and the Hangover Omelette. I substituted the white cheddar for goat cheese. This omelette was so good that I ordered it the next time we came in. My boyfriend ordered the Apple and Bacon Waffle which was a sight in itself.

We were super full from our dinner so we only shared something for the 3 of us. The menu is definitely for chocolate lovers! They have crepes, waffles, Sunday's, milkshakes, fondue, and everything else that your chocolate heart can desire! The best thing about this place is the first aroma of cacao or chocolate once you walk in the door. It's a small place, but you'll definitely get seated eventually if it's not a busy day. We got something called the strawberry volcano?!?! It was super rich and awesome to share with your friends. Filled with brownies, coconut, strawberries and a scoop of vanilla ice cream, drizzled with chocolate syrup, this is not for being who are looking to eat a lite snack. I'll definitely come again to try more desserts here! I highly recommend coming here for dessert."

Paradise!((Just a tid bit - when I rate a place 5 stars it means that not only was the service, food, and prices excellent, but the place instills the meanest of mean cravings in me. It means that after I'm done eating I already want to go back and order something else.))That is what Cacao 70 did to me.I am a chocoholic - a cocoa Fiend. My phone is protected by a chocolate bar phone case - Just to give you an idea of my love for cocoa. I acquainted our waitress with my addiction. I ordered Mexican Hot Chocolate (rich chocolate with cayenne pepper to add to the kick; absolutely divine), Nutella crepe with bananas (very large portion, can be shared between two people - simply yes!), and a chocolate cake (the weakest link, but still delicious) - the waitress looked shocked and asked if all of that was for me to which I ecstatically replied ""Yes!"". She said she had to forewarn me that it's a lot of food, but I told her I still wanted everything I ordered. She was right about the portion sizes - I had my work cut out for me, but I demolished everything. I was in Cocoa heaven. She came back later to pick up my empty plates and saw my chocolate covered phone and said ""Now it makes sense"". She also apologized in case she offended me, but she hadn't.It's probably a good I don't have a Cacao 70 nearby, I'd honestly go broke and possibly gain 10 lbs a week. Great for groups - especially like a ladies night or a date night. Just order dessert - it's Cacao 70 - it says it in the name - stick with something chocolatey and I doubt you can go wrong!"

There weren't starbucks and timmies all over Montreal back then. We had these lesser known local joints you would meet up  at with your girl and that was the only place in town like it. Cacao 70 is an old school style local business. They still write their specials on a chalk board on the wall. The wifi password is up there now too, but when you look around, there's folks having conversations, friendly staff that aren't up in your face.They still make a decent cup of espresso here.To my knowledge they don't have one in Toronto yet. Cacao 70 still belongs to Montrealers in that sense.The customer experience is legit. Cozy woody decor, lending the place an ""urban cabin"" vibe, the seating is comfortable,  background music isn't intrusive or too loud. You'll be comfortable here. You'll fit in just as well in your hoodie, jeans and joggers as you would after work in your business casual.As world city culture and urban nomadism spreads, I believe spots like this will become fewer and far between.The rate Cacao 70 is going, the shop always has patrons, they've already opened up a 2nd location on Parc, but make no mistake, it all started right here near Atwater, in this still slightly dingy part of town.What's the difference between C70 and Juliette? Everybody goes to Juliette, Juliette is where you're supposed to go.C70 is where you go if you know it. If you prefer, the slightly quieter, chill place to the  number one famous place.One day it might be a big chain with Cacao 70's in any city.Come try it.

Be sure to ask for the hot chocolate menu which includes dozens of different hot chocolates. This restaurant is a bit pricy, but definitely worth trying-especially if you have a major sweet tooth!"

My bf got the orange grand marnier crepe, which was good, but drenched in too much sugar. It was too heavy and I think I would have gotten sick from eating the entire thing (good thing he's a piggy and ate it all). The way they make the food here was like artwork. We sat by the open kitchen and watched the chefs skillfully drizzle chocolate on each crepe and decorate each dish to perfection. I think it was a fun experience to try it out, however, balancing a sweet dish with a salty one would have been smart."

I'm waiting for more out of town family members to come so I can take them here.

I honestly over did it on the chocolate here but every bit of it was worth it.My meal consisted of a waffle (very sweet, though i wish it wasn't candyish flavored) topped with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and chocolate fudge drizzle and white chocolate drizzle.  This included a side of warm milk and white chocolate to dip my ice cream of waffle in, if the drizzle was not enough, with an additional few grams of  milk chocolate ball toppings (I'm sure that there's some much more eloquent name for them).  The meal was very rich to say the least.  I OD'd on sugar and chocolate.  I only wish that the waffle wasn't ridiculously sweet and that one of the female waitresses wasn't  so non-attentive and nonchalant.  Overall good experience for a busy late evening snack though."

Yes it does serve everything you can think of covered with chocolate and in whipped cream but nothing is of great quality. Cacao 70 is a great example of a place that puts quantity over quality. Everything is overly sweet, they use already processed materials (think store bought marshmallow, whipped cream, store bought wafer cookies, pre-made pizza crust, etc). The quantity of whipped cream they put on everything is alarming - I've once had a bowl of whipped cream as a component of my tasting plate... If you want good chocolate, I would definitely suggest suite88 or Juliette et Chocolat where the the ingredients are of better quality and the portion size more reasonable."

Whether you enjoy sweet or savory this place has it all (made exceptionally well at that) The waiters and waitresses are super friendly and make sure everything is perfect.

/user_details?userid=JstDKWmAZsL026ADFxf7fw,Tony Kangrui L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I ordered one of the favorite menu items, dark melted chocolate with a side hot chocolate ($10 + tax/tip). The melted dark chocolate was small in quantity but exactly what you'd expect it to taste like. I was expecting the hot chocolate to be bland in comparison but it was surprisingly quite rich, and very sweet... Definitely satisfied my sweet craving, but I wouldn't call it good value.Food: 3/10Service: minus 1 starI typically do not penalize for service, however the attitude here is exactly what's wrong with many Montreal establishments. I had a bad feeling before even ordering. The waitress was obviously more concerned with flirting her male colleague than serving customers. I had to wait quite a long time before being seated, wait quite a long time before getting the menu, make multiple fiery eye contacts before being approached. Menu placed on the table with her back turned away. Same with water. After finishing my chocolate, I put my credit card on the table and fired several rounds of eye contacts to no avail, only seeing her pass by multiple times while looking away. I finally flagged her down and said ""can i have the bill?"" before she came back and grabbed my card while continuing to look at the guy behind the counter. I once again shot fiery glances at the girl when going out, obviously without any sort of greeting. I get that the typical clientele is distracted couples or large groups who don't care about fast personable service, but that's not an excuse to abuse customers. I kinda wish she didn't give me a receipt so that I can report their ass to Revenu Quebec.Not impressed. Neither by the food quality nor service. The execution is just inferior to Juliette & Chocolat on so many levels. Avoid."

My son decided on a waffle drizzled with chocolate. My daughter had a chocolate banana crepe. I had the Spanish frittata. It came with toast and few pieces of fruit to dip in chocolate. The only down fall was no refills on coffee and the mugs are tiny. For 2.95$ just a bigger mug would do. The service was good and we were seated immediately. I can honestly say we all left stuffed and satisfied. Well needed more coffee but stopped at Starbucks for a quick fix.

In addition to chocolate and sweets, they also have a selection of savory menu items, such as crepes and paninis. I ordered the breakfast crepe with spinach, feta, and egg. The spinach they used was fresh baby spinach and I was surprise to see the egg did not come inside my crepe but in the format of two perfect sunny side up eggs next to my crepe. As it turned out, I loved it that way! I got to dip my crepe into the runny egg yokes as one would points of toast. My only complaint was that Cacao 70 does not offer be channel sauce with their crepes, and so, the crepe was a bit dry.All in all, a great place to go as long as you don't mind leaving with a bit of a sweets induced tummy ache!"

Compared to the other location on Parc that is within closer proximity to the McGill campus and where I live in the Plateau, this Cacao 70 outdoes it on all fronts. The ambience in particular is much more classy and feels like it had more effort put into it - polished tables, wooden chairs, and a nice, airy layout - whereas Parc's feels much more clunky (plastic colored chairs?) and is only famous because it sponsored McGill Arts frosh last year, if I remember correctly.Since I hadn't eaten a savory meal at all that day, I went ahead and ordered the spinach, tomato, and feta sandwich; it actually tasted quite nice despite the spinach being slightly watery, but perhaps it was because I was utterly famished at the moment haha. Then, I went ahead and ordered the dark chocolate fondue, which came with an assortment of fruits (pineapple, banana, and strawberries) as well as a brownie and waffle. The fondue complimented the fruits and waffle PERFECTLY without it being overly sweet; however, the brownie with the fondue itself was too saccharine for my liking, but it tasted divine on its own.Although I still prefer Juliette & Chocolat over Cacao 70 overall, this location hits the spot for those chocolate cravings. Definitely go to both locations to compare and see which one fits your liking the best!"

The brunch omelettes have a side fruit dish with chocolate to dip in. Both omelettes and crepes are so well sized, by the time your cacao arrives you are already full. If you are cacao lover just focus on it as it is so good and is a meal by itself. BTW you can take your cacao home if you can't finish it. One thing for sure, chocolate beer, import from UK doesn't help either, but tasting a version of chocolate Guinness with your crepe seems to be appropriate although strange combination.  Service in this place is nice, on a crowded Sunday afternoon we were taken care of promptly.

There's a very cozy feel to the place, it's warm and a great setting for a date or groups to share good times over a huge fondue.I tried the tutti fruiti waffles served with a drizzle of milk chocolate, strawberries, caramelized bananas and vanilla ice cream on the side. For 13.50$, it is worth the size of the portion and could be filling as a meal itself. I also got their american style hot chocolate milk, which was extremely rich - I'm pretty sure there was more chocolate than milk in it and if let to cool down, it would solidify! Unfortunately it just gets too sweet and sickening, I was not able to finish everything I ordered despite having a light dinner beforehand.There should be a warning to consume in moderation. I will be going back as I'm eager to try some of their lighter desserts like crepes or cakes or perhaps just for a drink, they have smoothies and milkshakes too."

Both were solid choices, especially the fondue. Something about the tea flavor infusing into chocolate...An extra 2 cents, if you are sensitive to sweets or have cavities, it's probably best to share something or find another spot.

Fickle as ever we opted for the 70 salad, the Italian sausage frittata and the illegal chocolate waffle. The salad is a mixed green salad with feta and tomatoes topped off with a poppyseed dressing. It was quite good though I wished I had ordered the dressing on the side.The frittata was hot, came in a cast iron skillet. It was savory and filling. I was barely able to put a dent into it. The crown jewel of the meal was the illegal waffle. I will admit I like my waffle crispier than that but besides that it was a piece of heaven. The bananas were transformed into a ""banana brûlée"" with caramelized sugar. The order of operations was to then dip the banana or waffle in a chocolate sauce or whipped topping then top it off with these mini whopper balls. Unbelievable!They also have a dessert menu.

Just upon entering the sweet chocolate scent hits you in the face. Come early in the afternoon or morning, since it can get pretty busy in the evenings (the place is rather small and craving a sugar hit, you won't want to wait).The menu is long, actually a bit too long if you ask me. It's very difficult to decide, unless you wanna come every day and try something different. Well, that was not the case here since we were in town only for a little while. If you are a party of at least two or three people, it's worth ordering an assortment of several things - Sweet Chocolate Experience or Sharing for Two or More, that way you get to try more and share instead of getting too stuffed by yourself.We ordered a Triple Chocolate Cake (kinda resembles Tiramisu), something we should have shared, cause it's too much for one person - too much chocolate in one go (if there is such a thing, you'll say... and there is!). Black and White Waffle - a huge portion of waffles, chocolate, ice cream and whipped cream (also a lot for one person), Hot Chocolate and a Strawberry White Chocolate Shake (a small one). A lot (too much) for one evening if you ask me. Everything was tasty, but tolling on our stomachs.Next evening we tried Strawberry and Cheesecake Crepe (the best decision I've made here), Tuna Sandwich with a side salad, Chicken Sandwich without sides and a Brazilian Coffee. Sandwiches were nothing special - too much bread and too little contents (in the end it's a chocolate place, not a sandwich place, sometimes I forget about these things). The crepe was a proper one and I would have ordered it again if ever in town. All in all a good dessert place, but try to hold yourself back a bit when ordering. Even if you're super hungry, you might get stuffed all too fast, so rather share and order twice, if needed. :)Staff is super helpful and they speak English - also the menu comes in English as well."

/user_details?userid=gtPxrVoz2tKlZ61Y__QDmg,Zainab B.,"Elmwood Park, NJ",4 star rating,"This place is super cute and includes something for everyone. I ordered a breakfast omelette and it was fluffy and delicious but the real star of the show is their hot chocolate! It's creamy and smooth without being too bitter or sweet. It's a perfect balance and I highly recommend trying it. This place is a nice stop for a bite but it's definitely a causal place that can get loud. If you're looking for a more quiet place to eat, this isn't it. However, if you're just looking to come in, have good food, and don't mind noise, this place is great!"

The hostess was very unwelcoming and it seemed like she didn't want to work there. There were tables with leftovers from previous visitors, and no one bothered to clean up after them. The desserts were also very mediocre. We had ordered crepes and a cheesecake. The cheesecake was good, but the crepes were cold. I wouldn't go back when visiting Montreal."

They are serious about their use of sugar.I got the after party waffle, A waffle covered in whipped cream, strawberries, white and milk chocolate drizzle served with white chocolate sauce and chocolate covered rice puff sprinkles.The flavor was amazing and the strawberries were super fresh.I also ordered the C-70 which is a mix between hot chocolate and a latte. This surprisingly wasn't too sweet and had a great flavor.I would suggest getting something savory to balance out the sugar here and/or sharing one of these dishes with  a friend."

Lots of ice cream!!!!So badly craved the Black and White after seeing the pictures and I was NOT disappointed. Super good! Two scoops of ice cream with hardened chocolate drizzle on top, plus crispy chocolate dots for dipping. The waffle was great but thick! I like.Anyways it's 3 stars because they refused to refund my friend's $100 tip (this happened a while ago). Clearly a mistake! How dare they argue? It took 30 minutes to finally have them refund it.

/user_details?userid=zE49S2Em3l7vgIlvFzZFOw,Jenny H.,"Pembroke, Canada",4 star rating,"I still love going to Cacao70, but I think one thing I forgot to mention is the wait time. I was lucky that I only waited 20 minutes to get a seat. However, I was only with my partner. So  if you have a bigger group - it's definitely going to take a little longer. You want to take that into account. I believe the other locations (e.g. around Berri-Uqam) isn't as packed. But if you intend to meet here with a group of friends for, say 9pm, I recommend coming at least 15 minutes earlier.This time I went, my partner got a marshmallow and chocolate pizza, while I got the choco-nut waffle with ice cream. We always see people ordering the pizza, but I guess the idea never really sunk in to order one before. Definitely an interesting experience. Dough is basically pizza dough (I was expecting pastry) - with roasted marshmallows and drizzled chocolate. Mmm so good, but so filling. I don't know how he finished it. Especially since it comes paired with fruits and another mini-fondue of dark chocolate. As for my order - I loved the waffles as always. I also love the nuts on top - crunchy and sweet. The cream and ice cream melted really fast, and I'm not exactly the fastest eater - so my partner was taking bites here and there from my dish. I am definitely loyal to the Banana Split waffle - something about the caramelized sugar that seriously makes me drool. I do love how they also gave me fruit and mini-fondue though."

We had the one with pineapple, strawberries, bananas, brownie bits (dense and moist!), and waffle bits (fluffy!). I also had a chocolate crepe with banana (too ripe for my taste) which was ok, would be better with some icecream."

The particular hostess/also server (forgot her name) made us feel welcome and helped us order some of the more underrated menu items since there were so much to choose from! Got the vintage hot chocolate to start, husband got the champurado. Both were so creamy and chocolatey! Split a ham sandwich which was the perfect size to split since we were saving room for dessert. The sandwich did it's job. It was a regular sandwich but the mustard used was pretty good!!For ""dessert"" we got the Nutella ricotta pizza. It was amazing!!! Our server recommended it and we loved every bite. The bread was soft, the Nutella was still warm, and I'm not a fan of ricotta but it went so well with the Nutella. The dessert wasn't overly sweet either. Totally recommend this."

Every dish looks amazing as the servers walk by with them.  It's always busy which is a testament to the food.......almost every menu item has chocolate on it, in  it, under it, over it, through it, etc. etc. They did a great job with the ambiance and the location nice and central.

They have a broad menu with an interesting variety of chocolate drinks, food (waffles, crepes, baked goods, ice cream, etc.) as well as smoothies and, for the ones who would prefer eating a proper meal, sandwiches and salads. Their brownies are moist, fresh and warm, and their hot chocolates are rich and tasty, yet not overbearing. As for the waffles they are good as well but, in my experience, a bit hard to digest. I would definitely recommend this place for chocolate lovers and I am looking forward to visit Cacao 70 again to try something new!"
/user_details?userid=p6vHor1IUkSZVA1psy9tew,Mychele E.,"Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Clearly overwhelmed by the crowd - the restaurant was full when I arrived but they could not get caught up even as it emptied. I was on the patio and two tables left because of how long it was taking to order. Once people ordered it took more than 20 -30 minutes to get coffee. The table of 2 next to me got their coffee after the meal came and no cutlery.There is clearly a lack of a system in place because when drinks/food finally came out, they didn't know what table to bring it to. Isn't numbering tables on tickets restaurant 101? The table of 8 near me got there food staggered and some people were done eating before other food came out.I ordered the hangover omelette which comes with toast and potatoes and a side of fruit with chocolate fondue. The food came without the side and when I asked, the guy had no idea what I was saying. I don't think he understood French and didn't have much English. The potatoes were cold and the omelette lukewarm. I got up and brought it back to the kitchen because there was no way I was waiting for someone to check on me. I had already been there an hour. My food came again about 15 minutes later. The omelette was pretty good but could have used more cheese. I wasn't a big fan of the potato wedges. The fruit was fresh and chocolate was yummy. No one came to check on me. I would have liked a glass of water and more hot water for my tea.I didn't want to have to wait for the bill so I went to the cash to pay and there was a lineup. Apparently they only have to credit/debit machines and 1 was not functional and the waitress had taken the other one.While in line I noticed food sitting at the pass getting cold. Dirty dishes piled everywhere, most of the restaurant with empty uncleared tables with lots of unfinished food - I'd say that the food didn't meet other people's expectations either.And the worst is I didn't even get an apology from anyone"

We got to try a popular chocolate dessert cafe/restaurant called Cacao 70. They offered a limited selection of coffee drinks but I wasn't there for the coffee. Since it was brunch time, I was desperate to have some content into my stomach. I didn't want to order dessert because I had nothing in the morning and didn't want to be filled up on sugar. So I ordered one of their savoury crepes, The House Special (I think, I'm basing it off their online menu since I forgot to record it). It came with fruit appetizers that you could dip in chocolate before the main entree came. I definitely enjoyed the food! It was not crazily mind-blowing and unique, but it definitely gave me a fill and I was definitely content.I really liked the atmosphere and their chocolate-themed restaurant. You could also buy chocolate to take back with you if you wish. I didn't buy any only because they were a bit pricey for a bag.If I was to come back to Montreal (which I obviously am), I would definitely try their dessert crepes. Even if you hate chocolate (like my boyfriend), there is definitely something there for everyone."

The place was pretty packed but we were able to find a seat right away as we were a small group. Friend got the waffle and i went for the fondue. Both were good with really nice presentation, however unless you've got a serious sweet tooth this wouldn't be something i recommend. Both our totals came around under $20 tips included. Our server was super nice, helpful, and attentive. Reasons this place isn't 5 stars. 1. We asked one of the other servers for assistance since ours was halfway across the room, and we were kinda blown off. 2. It's pricey. I know i know pretty much all trendy places are pricey and this place was no exception, but still $14 for a waffle?! (Price is an estimation. I don't recall specifically) Anyways if you're fond of sweet things (and i mean SERIOUSLY fond, i couldn't even finish my fondue and i have 7 fillings from my sweet eating habits), this is a cute place to stop for a nibble."

I must say it does not disappoint! I went for the nutty waffle which consist of nuts with vanilla ice cream, nuts, whip cream, chocolate, nutty drizzles (i think hazelnut), bananas and strawberries. You can substitute your waffles for a crunchier type call cacao 70 for about 2 CAD more i think. I went with that and boy i devour that whole thing down in just a few. So goood!!! it' a bit sweet and quite a big portion for one to finish so i would suggest going with a friend if you can unless you are like me who is traveling on her own. so foodies if you are into nuts and chocolate i highly recommend this one! i was debating between this an the one on the special section ""feel like chocolate"" or the marshmallow and chocolate pizza.

My personal favorite was the brownie cube, it was super soft and chewy and would go great alone or dipped in some MORE chocolate. Also, give any one of their waffles a try - it's just more chocolate-y goodness.

The line to get in will be long (out the door even!) no matter when you go but don't get stressed if the host hasn't even looked at you, the time will be made up while (barely) waiting for your food after you order it! However, I would suggest asking them to bring you your bill at the same time as your food. I've waited for my bill for a long time before and having your bill with your meal allows you to leave when you want to and not have to wait all that extra time.For the atmosphere, it smells lovely in there (chocolate, of course!) and the decor is very chic. The tables for two are just the right size unless you each order a chocolate pizza, that's when it get's squishy. The last thing is that it's pretty hot in there so waiting in line with a jacket on could be brutal if you're someone who gets hot easily!When it comes to food, their chocolate fondues are the way to go! The chocolate is so rich that even a little bit is enough and having the fruit, peices of crêpe and brownies to dip in it only make it better! Their desserts are very decadent, leaving you with a chocolate high. Very nice presentation; very picture-worthy! Almost so nice you won't want to dig in- except for the fact that it looks so delicious!I would recommend having a healthy snack a couple hours before going here and not going on an empty stomach because it's just so much sugar! But don't have a huge meal either because these dishes, even when shared, are quite filling!It's always fun to try something new at Cacao 70 and free wifi is pretty great! I go at least once a month, definite recomendation unless you're impatient."

The portions were bigger than I expected. Ex: I ordered a cheesecake crepe and I couldn't even finish it(I'm the type of person to eat a lot). At least they have bigger portions than many other chocolate restaurants. Some stuffs are a little pricy but it's worth the try.Their menu is super organised and understandable.

It's a cute little place with a MASSIVE list of chocolate options ranging from drinks to crepes to ice creams to cakes and even to chocolate pizzas! I've been a handful of times, and each time I push myself to try something new. Happily, I'm never disappointed! It's a little on the pricey side (at ~9 for a hot chocolate), but totally worth it!

I ordered the quadruple chocolate parfait which consists of chocolate ice cream, chocolate brownie bites, melted chocolate, chocolate whipped cream and chocolate sauce. It looked small compared to my companion's chocolate waffle topped with ice cream, but it packed a major punch. Every bite was just amazing. The restaurant it self was a nice size with a cafe vibe.  There's a display of different types of chocolates that you can buy by weight. They also have chocolate artisan candies on sale.

Huge selection of sweets and wide range of chocolate based drinks on the menu. My friends and I ordered American style/vintage hot chocolate, triple fondue, and a cacao fruit crepe. The chocolate fondue was really rich and smooth. An interesting part is that you have an option to choose what type of chocolate is used in the hot chocolate. Either milk/semi-sweet/dark. I have to say the service was quick and server was friendly. Utensils were squeaky clean which is a major plus on my list. It sure was a chocolate paradise, a cafe devoted entirely to cacao. I was fascinated at the credit card machine they brought over to the table versus having to wait for the bill and then sign it. It was quick, easy and efficient.

Some were definitely bigger hits (marshmallow chocolate pizza) than others (vanilla ice cream -- but mainly because you're just not interesting enough when your neighbours on the dessert plate are chocolate brownie bites, chocolate wafers, and chocolate sauce) but I liked the variety. Contrary to Juliette's (where service is a bit inconsistent -- some days I feel like that place is oozing snootiness), our server here was super helpful, friendly, and what I appreciated the most -- she didn't try to talk us into ordering more food than what we could finish. (We were considering getting the sampler AND a waffle, but she advised us to start with one and to see how we feel because she said it was common that people's eyes were bigger than their stomachs when it came to the restaurant). We took her advice and boy was she right!! We needed to be rolled out the door after that dessert sampler and would never have been able to take a few bites of anything else. I feel like 4-stars might be more appropriate for this place but the prices feel a smidge too high. I've only been here once, so I will dutifully go again to see if the service is as awesome as the first time to see about bumping this up to 4!"

( I only ordered 1 waffle) Was he thinking that take out customers should take each piece separately?! His reason was the bag doesn't fit the waffle boxes. The take out items should be hold separately or horizontally in the bag with two hands. I only ordered one Item and the take out was pack in a weird way. He said he can not do any thing.3. I mentioned I can't take it like this. At this time the manager came and fixed the problem easily. All the boxes were fit in the same bag easily. So far so good. However when I tried to mention him what just happened with that waiter.

Nice complementary touch to help you decide what you want to drink and eat.I had the lactee superieure hot chocolate with the milk cocoa base. It comes in two parts.... 1) you have a high ball glass with the bottom filled with your choice of chocolate 2) a cute metal measuring cup with the base of your choosing. You have a spoon to mix it and voila!!!! heaven in a glass.  My choice of chocolate was really good..... it smooth and velvety. Drank it with no problem :)My friend had the Milk frozen hot cocoa. She drank it all and really liked it. I didn't have a taste so i can't explain it in great detail. But she seemed to enjoy it considering it was gone within 5 min. :)Prices are on the steeper side..... 10.50$ with tax for my drink, not including tip.

The fondues come with fruits, marshmallows, brownie pieces and cookies so you can basically make your own smoore.

All smiles. I wasn't seated for even 5 minutes and she asked me what I'd like to drink while waiting for my friend. Just water was fine. And what was super great was that they gave a water jug and 2 glasses with the menus! Not many places do that apart from some Korean restaurants. Yay! I ordered the banana split waffles and my friend took the choco-nut waffles. They were similar except that she had strawberries with her bananas and I had choco wafer balls with bananas, which were, in addition, caramelized. Oh! And hers had whipped cream (I was slightly jealous about that). All in all, a good meal at a good price ($14.5 + tax). I walked out thinking this place is a tad better than Juliette et Chocolat.

That being said, I don't particularly care for J&C as there's nothing extraordinary about them and I've found their desserts to be somewhat lacking in chocolatey goodness. Anyway, the first thing to note about C-70 is that there always seem to be a line-up so be prepared to wait. I stopped in on a Saturday night around 10pm and waited about 30 minutes for a table.   As I looked around, I realized that everyone had gigantic portions of whatever it was they were eating (C-70 is definitely not cheap on portion size!) so when the waitress came over, I told her I wanted something relatively light and you know, not the size of a soccer ball. I ended up ordering the Raspberry Brownie Parfait.... which was huge! It was made up of real raspberries, whipped cream, chocolate brownie, melted chocolate AND chocolate sauce. AND ice cream. Holy Jesus, that's a heart attack in a glass, just waiting to happen. I did opt out of the ice cream part of the show but regardless, this dessert was VERY rich, although be it delicious. I was only able to eat half because my body just couldn't handle so much chocolate overload in one sitting.   I had also ordered a latté.... not realizing that they were going to make it with chocolate milk (using real melted chocolate). SO, I got a double dose of chocolate insanity and I didn't sleep all night. Definitely worth a trip, though I suggest sharing something or going on an empty stomach. Mmmm.... choc'late."

This was the perfect establishment to get my crepe fix when I was in Montreal on vacation.Firstly, let's start with the decor. It was chic and trendy with a touch of hipster, so I was immediately obsessed with everything they were about. Though the extensive line was a bit discouraging, my friend and I decided to stick it out. The wait wasn't too bad, but it definitely helped that there were only two of us. We seated right by the open windows, which was appreciated on a beautiful summer night, and we were given our menus that were a small example of what you could be served if you were in heaven. I chose the chocolate raspberry crepe, and oh my goodness gracious, it was sweet, tart, and absolutely delicious. What I experienced is what I like to call a ""food-gasm."" It's exactly what it sounds like. I couldn't have asked for a better crepe to make my stay in Montreal perfect.Though the place was terribly crowded, I did lose myself in the food and found myself ignoring everyone around me. For an establishment to do that was quite blissful."

The hot dark chocolate is yummy and who wouldn't like a chocolate dessert style pizza?!? That said, I also find the open industrial unfinished rustic look too cold and uninviting for the warmth and coziness that chocolate represents. The menu, which is a tad predictable and unoriginal, could benefit from more creative dishes and I was disappointed by some of dishes on more than one occasion. If ever you have a hankering for a chocolate & oatmeal breakfast, I'd avoid it here. Rather lacks in any taste and the use of milk chocolate instead of dark only adds to the blandness. That said, do try one of the sweet creamy cocoa oozy dessert pizzas. You'll feel like Miss Piggy, but it'll satisfy that sweet tooth for a while!"

Fondue: gives you the option of one, two or three chocolates for the same price. The fondues are served with seasonal fruits, brownie and waffle bites. The portioni s large enough to share with two.the sharing sharing is a large portion that in my opinion can be shared with three people. Same at the fondue but is served with more stuff like a half nutella pizza. The pizzas are not good. The dough to topping ratio is not proportional and the dough is very dry making it hard to swallow. The caramelized banana waffle is very good. It's simple. waffle, with caramelized bananas and chocolate drizzled on top. The surgar on top of the bananas are torched making it chewy and adding a different texture to the plate. Satisfies a waffle craving for sure.The hot chocolate is not good, its too thick for it to be a hot chocolate and too watery for it to be a ganache and flavor is off. A very good date place and dessert for friends and lovers. I would recommend it"

When you walk in you will inevitably draw a comparison with Juliette and chocolat...Decor wise, this place seems more cosy and inviting. But menu and dessert wise it's on par with Juliette and chocolat.The menu is extensive, and it gave me a case of I don't know what I want-itis...What we ended up having was a banana split, NYC chocolate shake, and volcano, which is a brownie with a scoop of ice cream.The NYC shake, is not creamy, made with mostly ice, so good for those who are lactose intolerant, but then again a shake without cream or ice cream is in my opinion, a tragedy!!! but it was very chocolaty and less sweet.The banana split was the best thing we had. But ice cream, banana and chocolate sauce is hard to miss. The volcano was too sweet, the brownie was too sweet even though it had a lot of chocolate flavor. It was topped with a scoop of ice cream and drizzled with chocolate sauce, caramel, and strawberry sauce... too many sauces, and sugar over kill. Again, another nice concept in theory, but things didn't pan out as we had hoped. I do want to go back as there were some things I wanted to try out but could not since we were full coming here...My wish is to have something made with chocolate incorporated in it, some cake or something, not some dessert with chocolate sauce on it... it seems unimaginative, plus we have plenty of that at Juliette and chocolat, why can't we get something different?"

We had dinner and then gave ourselves a couple of hours of museum time before heading here for our lovely chocolate experience for 2. I am a chocolate fiend so I was very excited to come here in general and the atmosphere didn't disappoint. We were brought a bucket of marshmallow roasting supplies and waited for our plate. I took issue with a couple of things right off the bat. First, I know it comes with one milkshake, which as an experience for two is kind of lame, but this isn't a beautiful tall shake. It comes in a short tumbler and it's basically a tasting portion. That being said, it's one of the best milkshakes I've ever had.The other thing was that we were supposed to get strawberries and bananas, as per the menu, but we got pineapple in lieu of strawberries. It was fine because I love pineapples but it would have been nice to have been warned about the substitution.The waffle tasted a little weird and my friend pointed out that it was a little undercooked in the middle. We didn't really touch it. The grill for the marshmallows runs out so after that, play time is over. The dipping sauce was great and the crunchy wafer balls were as well. I saw a couple of other delicious chocolatey concoctions at other tables so I'd return to try those. But it's a lot of dessert even for two people."

I was so eager to go, I took a good 30 minutes at home to check out the online menu beforehand. After much deliberation, I picked a chocolate pizza, and decided then and there, that that would be it. If you don't make your mind up pretty quick, be warned, you might fall into a stupor! Will you have a...waffle? a...brownie?a...sundae? The options are mind-blowing, but if you happen to be with friends, a sure bet would be their plates for two, so you can sample everything. We were seated very quickly, and as so many other reviewers have mentioned, the space is lovely, if a little cramped. I guess what they lack in space, they make up in portion size! My chocolate-ricotta pizza arrived on some sort of marble counter-top, which was odd, and incredibly heavy. Sorta tough to maneuver when eating. The pizza was good, and had a nice balance of salty and sweet. The waffles are beautiful, but I'm not sure the spongy texture is my thing. The mini-brownies on the other hand are great! The highlight of the meal was the raspberry-chocolate sundae. That thing is pure decadence. It's massive, it has brownie chunks in it. Gah! Would totally recommend!I wasn't crazy about the service though. My biggest gripe about the place is actually the chocolate. Sad face. It's very sweet and I wonder if they don't prefer the use of candy-level chocolate as opposed to the purer stuff.."

His waffle was not too soft, not too hard....just the right texture. The semisweet chocolate tasted great, it melted in your mouth.

Thankfully we weren't too full from dinner, but even so a single parfait worked perfectly for two. We got one with chocolate-mint ice cream. I was a little worried when it arrived -- oftentimes green chocolate-mint ice cream is lower quality than white -- but it was great. It's two generous scoops of ice cream (and they happily gave us another bowl so it was easier to split) plus a whole slew of toppings. We really got a kick out of the options this provided. We dipped the fresh strawberries and the chocolate wafers in the hot fudge to create a mini fondue, as well as experimented with the various toppings in different combinations with the ice cream. The hazelnut ""crunchy bits"" were wonderful, and the brownie -- a very generous portion -- was excellent both plain and with the ice cream.  The missing star is for the price. This place ain't cheap. But it's definitely worth it as a special occasion place. And I suppose it's good for our waistlines that most of us can't afford to eat here regularly! Sadly we didn't get the hot chocolate samples other people got, but there are numerous varieties, including several types of cinnamon and/or chili hot chocolates that I can't wait to try.

No complaints about the food. I liked the fresh fruit and melted chocolate that comes with the brunch platters. Nice balance to the savoury sandwich I had. I had the open faced chicken and egg sandwich which was quite good. Chocolate pizza was pretty good as far as the chocolate goes but the dough was a bit thick and overwhelmed the chocolate.We were seated at a tiny table which would have been fine if we were drinking two mugs of hot chocolate. However, the plates for brunch platters and the chocolate pizza are enormous. You can really only fit 1 plate comfortably and 2 if you really squeeze. Our server brought out the fresh fruit and melted chocolate part of the brunch platter first. Within 5 minutes, before I had finished the fruit, they brought out NOT the rest of the brunch (i.e. sandwich and omelette) but the chocolate pizza. We thought it odd to serve the sweet stuff first before brunch but ok, whatever. We worked on the chocolate pizza. AGAIN, in less than 5 minutes, the server showed up to announce that the brunch entrees were out but that they would wait until the table gets cleared up a bit more after we finish the pizza. Clearly our food was getting cold at the pass while we tried to eat the pizza as fast as we can. Before we could finish the pizza, the server just came out with the brunch plates and put them down on the table anyway despite just announcing earlier that he would wait. At this point, the plates were spilling over the edges of our tiny table and we are literally contorting ourselves trying to eat. The napkins had nowhere to go and our server just tossed them on top of the FOOD and rushed away. Needless to say we were completely flabbergasted by this terrible treatment that was completely non-sensical. Even when we had finished the pizza, our server ignored our table and did not take away the stone so that we could have more room with our plates.Would never go back."

My chicken salad was so full of mustard flavour that I could barely finish it though I was famished and too much of the mesclun was rusted. Yet, when my friend asked for mustard for her supposed beef crepe she was told they had none. To boot the crepe had a super thin single layer of beef and almost none of the advertised mushrooms or cheese besides being too sweet to be called savoury. Our mugs of hot chocolate were so huge that we could not have finished them in a million years and the orange flavour advertised was no where to be seen. Service was impossibly slow but they appear to be understaffed and what staff there is appeared under-trained. Verdict: The bad outweighed the good too much for me to go back. There's better elsewhere."

I could feel my blood sugar levels rising when i walk thru that entrance door! I could no believe all the chocolate i could try.  Its wonderful, good quality chocolate.

The portions are big and it's a bit on the expensive side, but totally worth it. But here's why I am only giving them 3 stars. Last time we went there in October 2013, we had terrible service:When we came in, (which was out 5th time probably), the place was rather empty, about 2-3 tables were occupied. We sat down, already knowing what to order. We ordered, and then we wait. After 15-20 minutes of waiting, I noticed how it took so long since it was only one plate and we would always order it previously. Our table was facing the checking counter, where the waiters would usually punch in the orders. I saw our waiter going to the counter, and said loudly ""Oh Sh*t!!"" with another waitress beside him. She looked at us with a ""shocking"" look on her face, and walked away. Immediately after I saw that, our waiter came to us and said ""Sorry guys, your plate will be there in like 10 minutes, there's a problem with the waffle machine"" and he proceeded to give us the knives and forks, which they usually do right after we tell our order.  Obviously, I didn't believe him, I just knew it was pure BS and he simply forgot to put in our order. Also, I saw another waiter giving a plate of waffles to another table that came AFTER us, we waited 10 more minutes and left unsatisfied. Since then, we haven't returned to this place, since the waiter lied to us straight up and nobody else seemed to care of what happened. Service has never been the best there, and that day proved it. We understand it was a mistake and that these things happen, but we are a big fan of this place and we are going to the one in the village, which has better service. I would recommend Cacao 70 to anybody who loves chocolate, waffles and ice cream, this place is exceptional for what they do, despite of what happened! :)"

/user_details?userid=YYyQ7qPPU_TXmaQ7Q4u6nA,Greg M.,"Norfolk, VA",4 star rating,"Friendly prompt  service. Clean restrooms. She had the 'lazy breakfast', a hot skillet of scrambled eggs, baked beans, bacon, sausage (tasty), ham (sugar cured and not to my taste), potatoes, and toast. I had the 'blue mushroom omelette', mushrooms, spinach, onions and Swiss cheese. It was very good and accompanied by seasoned, roasted potatoes and toast. The meal came with a surprise appetizer of fresh strawberries, pineapple, banana and delicious warm melted chocolate for dipping. We had planned to try one of the desserts for which they are known but were pleasantly full after our breakfast and will have to go back again to try the desserts and crepes. She had a hot Americano she said was ""strong enough to bounce a bull"". I was disappointed with a weak nearly flavorless iced coffee. In all a satisfying way to break the night's fast and after a brisk walk back to the Sheraton, a pleasant morning."
/user_details?userid=ddUsCHQmQr-N4cHMl3S3fg,Jodie C.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"To preface, I must admit that the reason why I'm about to give Cacao 70 such a blah review is because I built my expectations up so high from reading all the wonderful reviews on urbanspoon and yelp. So I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by how warm the ambiance was. I liked the large open kitchen and the wooden counters. I liked the fairy lights and the spacious seating area. My friend and I were lethargically greeted and seated by a guy who looked like he wanted to just get out of there. My friend got the Cioccolata Calda (Italian-style Hot Chocolate) and I got the %70 Fleur de Cao which was different than her's which was hot chocolate where as mine was cocoa based. We also ordered the Cacao 70's Cheesecake. The drinks came and they were actually really delicious. I have to say that I've never had hot chocolate/cocoa this good. They were rich and thick and creamy. If anyone has seen that scene in the film Chocolat when Vianne is pouring cocoa into the cup for Armande and it's perfectly dense and rich... well that's how our hot cocoa/chocolate was. I liked her's more, it did have quite a thicker consistency, allowing her to drink with a spoon. I wish mine also came in a cup instead of a  fishbowl-like glass which made it hard to drink from since it was quite hot after pouring in the cocoa. It also detracted from the warmness that you should feel from drinking cocoa, I feel. But what I didn't like...well a lot actually. First the price. I'm sorry but $8-10 for hot chocolate? Really? Sure it was really good, but I'm not used to paying so much for hot chocolate. Secondly, the cheesecake. Presentation wise, I'd give it a 1.  It gets 1 point for drizzling red raspberry sauce on the plate, ok fine another point for nice cut strawberries. Otherwise, it really seemed like they scooped (yes scooped) the rest of the cheesecake that was left and plopped in on our plate, smothered it with whipped cream and called it a night. It must have been some excellent quality whipped cream that we were paying for then because that's mostly what we ate. The little bit of cheesecake I guess was okay.We couldn't finish our drinks because we were too full. I don't think there will be a next time for me but I'd recommend just getting either a dessert or drink. The drink would've been satisfactory for me. Whatever you do, just don't get the cheesecake."
/user_details?userid=LknZlzFAS6Fkbe69g5J1Zw,Kat C.,"Saint-Laurent, Canada",2 star rating,"Quite expensive. Although, that doesn't seem to stop the long waits and lineups. Dessert pizza is very tasty but again, the price doesn't seem justified. The service can be very poor. For example, on one visit, I literally gave the waitress the last bit of money I had in my wallet... 5$. She had brought us 2 dishes and had returned once to ask if everything was to our liking. That's it. That's the extent of her work. 5$ was a very decent tip, just under 18%. I like to tip well when service is good. Which it was up until then. As I handed her the 5$ I said ""this is all I have...""   She took it , her grin changing to irritation and she turned around and walked away without so much as a thank you. I left knowing I would never return. I can eat some Nutella at home, thank you very much. I don't need some waitress with entitlement issues giving me attitude. If someone gave me all the cash they had in their wallet, which was by no means a bad tip, I would thank them kindly. Not be a miserable b to them. Unfortunately this was enough to make me never return. And honestly had I known she would react that way, I'd have kept my money. I work hard too."

So being put at the,table that gets the blast of of arctic air whenever the next lot of customers feel the need to,keep both doors open as they try to get in.  Not a pleasant way to eat chocolate..

/user_details?userid=6RVbmq6q5TbhCvr9-4onHQ,Randy H.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",4 star rating,"Updated with our second Visit (4 days later - Read First Visit below if you haven't done so already)Second VisitThis visit we ordered a whole bunch of things:- Raspberry Brownie Parfait (again, but the first time was better as it came with chocolate cream)- Quadruple Chocolate Parfait- Triple Chocolate Pizza- Chocolate Nutella Ricotta Pizza- Chocolate Peanut Butter Pizza- Waffle with Ice Cream, Fruits and Chocolate- Raspberry Crepes with ChocolateYes, it was insane. The Pizzas were good but we ordered way too many and after a while you can only take so much. One slice per person is enough and I suggest getting something that isn't ONLY chocolate otherwise you go crazy (i.e. Quadruple Chocolate Parfait was good but near the end...). The waffle didn't taste like a waffle, it tasted like a sponge cake that was put into a waffle machine and I actually liked it better this way. As for crepes, it was good but a bit too soggy (too much jam on whatever the liquid was) for my taste. There are pics on my blog!First VisitAfter our visit to Kazu, which if you read about can tell that I was still super hungry (Satya actually cooked up a supper when we came back right after going to Kazu and Cacao 70!) we decided to try out the now chocolate place, Cacao70. I think it was a Presse Café before and the transformation into a chocolate bar was a good one. The place is aesthetically pleasing, well lit and makes you crave chocolate in every way. I am a huge chocolate lover and used to pound down tons of chocolate as a kid.We started off with some samples of hot chocolate. Despite the varying degrees of sweetness, I must say that the texture and taste of all the types were amazing.The Raspberry brownie parfait was great. The whipped cream was chocolatey and the ice cream went down really well with the brownies and raspberries. The triple chocolate cake was ok but the cake seemed to be more of a marble pound cake than a chocolate one. I haven't tried the chocolate pizza yet but it seems to look yummy. Maybe the next time I go."

/user_details?userid=pbYTgMQhU_dw4CI53YBhfA,Jordan C.,"Montreal, Canada",1 star rating,"I've been to Cacao 70 multiple times as it is close to my apartment but haven't felt the need to review this establishment until very recently due to probably the worst experience at a restaurant yet. I went here with two girlfriends Friday night around 10:30 pm and was not surprised to see a line up almost out the door. We waited for around 30 minutes in line, drooling due to the smells and seeing other people eating. We were very excited to be having dessert here as one of my friends had never been. We chatted while we waited watching as some people left, starting to get a bit impatient. A waitress came by to take our party number saying it would be 15-20 minutes of wait time. After 30 minutes, maybe more of waiting we were seated by the same waitress who apologized due to being understaffed. That's when I realized that there were only two people on the floor waiting the entire restaurant on a Friday night. By this point we were very hungry and thirsty from waiting, but no water was brought to our table. This is where things went down hill fast....1. We had to wait 20+ minutes for water to be brought to our table and it was only after I had to bark down the waiter who would not look at our table as he passed it multiple times. 2. After finally getting our water, our order was taken and food arrived shortly after (~10-15 minutes) but one of my friends had ordered a cafe au lait which we had to ask for THREE times before finally receiving a lukewarm coffee. No one came by to check how we were and we were very unhappy with the service.The waiters knew they were understaffed and it took us an hour and a half to be seated, eat, and pay because of terrible service. They didn't even offer to give us anything to make the wait more enjoyable nor did they make us feel like they cared at all. At one point, there was no one on the floor and that's when I wanted to get up and leave. This is the first time I have ever left no tip at a restaurant and it was well deserved.I can definitely say I will not be going back after such a horrible evening at Cacao. It is unbelievable to think that they were 'understaffed' on a Friday evening, probably their busiest time yet there were 4+ people in the kitchen. Beware of their terrible and rude service."

Being a chocoholic, I found it very hard to decide on what to order because everything sounded appealing. The server was so helpful and strongly recommended the chocolate cake. I am SO glad he did. (Do NOT be deceived, this is not your average chocolate cake!) It came in a cup (maybe bc we ordered it to-go), and it took all our strength to wait till we got to our hotel to eat it. It was HEAVENLY! Layers of mousse, cake, dark chocolate syrup (that was CREAMY), and other things I couldn't quite identify. The texture came together and just melted in your mouth, though the distinct flavors truly spoke for itself. How can something taste so light and yet so rich?! I couldn't stop thinking about that dessert for the rest of the day. A bit steep on the wallet for a cup of cake ($11ish after tax), but boy, it was definitely worth it! Would not recommend sharing! Preserve your relationship and buy your own! ;)"
