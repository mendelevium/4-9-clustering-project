The staff are very polite, quite knowledgeable, and very friendly. I have come here a fair number of times now, and my service is always very fast.Drinks: good selection and you can of course order off menu as they have proper mixologists. Food: excellent. I love their Peruvian-Chinese fusion style. If you enjoy any of the above stated cuisines, you can't really go wrong; the lomo saltado is excellent and you should experience it at least once. I don't agree with the prior review that gave this place one star as I have not had a similar experience whatsoever in over 5+ visits. Decor: great mix of booths, bar seating, and window seating. The decor is excellent, and the candles / lights over the bar make for a great atmosphere. If you're looking for a new date spot, check out Chifa!"
/user_details?userid=g-y4Me4bqDz8jwFzX_e17w,Norine A.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Chifa (Peruvian-Chinese fusion) is a new addition as a sister site to Tiradito (Peruvian-Japanese-Nikkei). Minutes away from Pelicano and Tiradito, the interiors of this place are warm and inviting- yet intimate. With booths available and bar seats. The staff is very friendly and engaging which is something that stood out about this place.  I made reservations through OpenTable that seated us at the bar. I recommend calling the resto and requesting a booth because things get crowded on bar counters when you order 4 + dishes to share. The turnover from ordering time to getting the dish is quick- with 0 wait time pretty much.The menu has a lot of options starting at 12-15$ range but adds up quickly. I ordered the ho lee fried fish (a battered boneless fried fish with a sweet and sour sauce as the bed and a mayo styled sauce served on top of the fish)-this was my favourite. We also tried the calamari with snow peas in a soy sauce concoction (2nd fave). Both of these dishes came with a bowl of white rice. The Asian salad was very refreshing and filling with citrus notes, nectarine, cashews and rice noodles. The last dish: tamarind eggplant was heavy on the Tamarind- took away from the dish. We also ordered a bottle of red wine for around 50$. So we paid 62$ pp minus tip for 2 people. As much as I enjoyed the ambience, none of the dishes I had stood out as really original to me (comparing to Tiradito - I enjoyed the items a lot more in the same price bracket). Maybe another visit will change my thoughts? Peking duck dish for 2 ppl for 45$ still spikes my curiosity"

We ordered a few dishes to share including their oriental salad, the fried 5 spice chicken, the duck ceviche, and the fried ravioli. The ceviche and ravioli were exceptionally memorable, with great flavour and texture; the black bean sauce on the fried  5 spice chicken was finger looking good too! The mains impressed us so much we ordered dessert; friend sweet potato donuts in a sugar cane syrup with Mochi ice cream. Definitely an interesting combination but also a great light dessert to wrap up our meal. My only complaint would be the size of the plates; although the sharing portions were great, our individual plates, although looked stilish, weren't very practical as they could only hold a bite at a time. They also ran out the seafood ceviche but was glad since the duck ceviche was outstanding! The service was a little on the slow side when we first got seated seeing it took a while before someone came to see us to take our order; at this point we were well into our wine bottle. However, once the food started coming, the wait staff took care of ensuring our glasses and bellies were always full. I especially enjoyed the fact that we didn't feel rushed and had the time to enjoy our meal. The resto was busy with a cool interior and great atmosphere; this resto will surely be a nice new addition to the food scene once it irons out a few kinks!"
