/user_details?userid=Xv72yrPK5yacJrts2bQK6A,Elizabeth Y.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"Noodle Factory was delicious; I went there with family on the first day of our stay at Montreal and it was a hit!We ordered two types of dumplings--Har Kao steamed shrimp dumplings, which were soft and delicious, and pan fried pork dumplings, which had a tasty tender meat filling. (They also came with a great sauce!)We also had two noodle dishes--the first, stir-fried handmade noodles with vegetables, was delicious! They were very soft, and the vegetables were also great. There was a perfect amount of sauce in the dish, which we noted as restaurant noodle dishes often have too much sauce.The stir-fried rice noodles with beef were also good; my mom said they reminded her of noodles from Malaysia. The onions were a bit raw, but the dish was still quite good. If you're only getting one noodle dish, though, I would recommend the handmade noodles.While they don't accept card payments, they did accept USD (although at a 1.1 USD to CAD exchange rate rather than the going 1.3). Even with this higher rate, the prices were very reasonable, and we walked away feeling like we had had a filling, tasty meal at a good price. We all thought it was nice that each of the dishes had a unique flavor.tl;dr: great place for handmade noodles & dumplings; they don't accept cards but take USD (and even with the exchange rate premium + tip, it's a bargain)"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This used to be a place specialised in noodles and dumplings back then but they seem to have changed. It now serves general tao, chow mein and all the other usual chinese fast food dishes. They still kept some of the old items on the menu. We tried the zhajiang noodles, the wonton noodles, the onion pancake and the dumplings. Their zhajiang was bland, the noodles were sloppy with no chewiness and the other 2 tasted like frozen food. As for the service, it was very quick. The place is very small but with a service that fast, customers come and go pretty quickly."

I just took the 5% tip back and left."

Luckily it was a real win,win.The service was great, food was tasty and It all came out quickly. Not the mention large portions and an affordable price. I had the Shanghai noodles and pork dumplings and this fat boy couldn't finish It all. So when in the mood for noodles this place is worth checking out."

We were seating immediately and placed our orders within 5 minutes. Our food came out roughly 10 minutes after. Fast service is definitely one of selling points here.

Their noodles are cooked to perfection, however the accommodating sides or meat atop is what provides the flavor- either from the sauce or meat itself.

The noodles were similar to those of cho mein, not what I was expecting, but the portion was large for the price! The buns were good and simple but again underwhelming. Everything did seem very healthy which was nice! With 4/5 on Yelp I was expecting more. It's okay but there are some amazing places for noodles and soup on st Laurent in Chinatown. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend it to my friends. Maybe the meat dishes are amazing, I wouldn't know! The staff is very nice and the dishes came quickly!"

/user_details?userid=dD5vTDPzv_79m8_zZhc9hA,Steven B.,"Beachwood, OH",4 star rating,"Stopped in for lunch after wandering around Montreal for a while.  Located in the center of Chinatown and near the convention center, Noodle Factory is a small restaurant with only a few tables and a small menu.   While they may make their own noodles, they do not hand throw the noodles like some places I have seen.  I had the Shrimp stir fried noodles and an order of the the shrimp dumplings.   The shrimp noodles were good, soft noodles stirred with a good portion of shrimp and baby bok choy; the noodles were a bit soft and the dish could have been seasoned a bit more.   The dumplings were very good, with great flavor and an excellent texture to the dumpling wrapper.Service was good and the food came up extremely fast; Noodle Factory provides good food in big portions at a reasonable price.  The decor is nothing special; be aware that they do not take charge cards, so have cash."
/user_details?userid=5r7xBmL5DIypt7mTL-UE_Q,Gandalf1 G.,"Houston, TX",5 star rating,"We came here for a quick bite, ordered the usual Chinese-American dishes for my SO of shrimp fried rice and sweet and sour fish, and the Shanghai noodles with beef for me (this is the Noodle Factory after all, no point in coming here if you don't try their noodles).  They were all pretty good.  The fish had a really fine and slightly crunchy fried coating, different from what we usually get back home, and the fried rice had the usual  slight smoky taste of hundred thousand BTU restaurant fried rice, and interestingly the green peas had a freshly harvested taste, which is something I've never tasted before in fried rice.  I attribute the fresh green peas to Montreal's French foodie culture making this sort of produce readily available. (And yes, I have become a connoisseur of shrimp fried rice and sweet and sour fish)The place has lots more interesting and more real Chinese food like dumplings and dim sum which I would have liked to tryThe service was amazingly fast, they have to be, being such a small restaurant.  Turn around of the tables is key fo this place, so don't cone here if you want to linger and socialize"

Even if you're getting something to go, they give you a table and water while you wait. The restaurant is small but I've never had a problem getting a table. The menu is varied and fun.The food is delicious, I love it so much. I want to eat everything but I can't. The first time I came here I ordered 10 extra spring rolls for myself, that's how good they were. I highly recommend this place, it is my number one for Chinese food."

/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This is a good inexpensive place for lunch. It's a solid 3 stars which is not the A list but more of a strong C+ or B-. The Shanghai noodles were little bit too overcooked, but the fact that you can order dim sum is a plus. The service was quick which was another positive note. This restaurant does Not accept credit or debit, so don't forget to take out some cash before you go. Overall, it's not a bad place if you're craving some noodles quick."

Noodle Factory had an excellent authentic feel and the service was quick and very friendly. We got the fried pork dumplings, the steamed pork dumplings, and the General Tsao's chicken. The dumplings had a thicker dough but were fresh and delicious. The chicken had a fantastic sauce and good chunks of chicken."
/user_details?userid=ITSnuLOu81doC5GGT5NMSQ,Randy T.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"[Montreal Food Tour Stop #7] A small, hole-in-the-wall restaurant with Cantonese noodles.  The restaurant has an open kitchen and serves a variety of stir fry and tasty noodle dishes.  Not a lot of tables so probably not great for a huge group, but a decent sized place to bring your family. Portion size is good for the price.  No credit cards are accepted, but taxes are included in the price.Highlights: I ordered the beef chow ho fun, which is one of my favorite noodle dishes ($9.95 CAD, tax included).  The dish has beef, green onions, flat rice noodles cut into bite size pieces, and bean sprouts.  This dish tends to be greasy, but I was happy that my order from here was not too greasy.  There was a decent amount of beef.  The server politely served me water, even though I was ordering takeout.  Flavor profile was very good.Critiques: None really.  Beef rice noodles aren't a fancy dish, so what I ate pretty much met my expectations.Overall: Noodle Factory satisfied my noodle craving.  The dish I ordered was flavorful, not excessively greasy, and had a decent mix of ingredients that weren't noodles.  Plus, you get good value for the price."

/user_details?userid=ORYJbyEvaVSkZo_nheLjAw,Ira K.,"Bedford, VA",5 star rating,Great Yelp review drew us to the Noodle factory. homemade noodles were first class had it mixed with vegetables and tofu. The Chinese broccoli sautee was absolutely first-class and the steamed vegetable dumplings were a little bit on the  doughy side but tasty. For Montreal food prices it was a steal.. good quality fast service. I would definitely return
/user_details?userid=l9fGOqjEQDEN10Pog3cMng,Xena W.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place doesn't look like much on the outside - an old building with a little red sign - nor when you go inside, as it is a small and cramped place that seems kind of disorganized and messy at first glance. However, the food and service here will astound you. I went here with my father for lunch today and we were in a rush. We were led to a table and the menus were given right away. I quickly ordered spring onion pancakes as an appetizer and their stir fried handmade noodles with vegetables. The food was ready in five minutes, tops, but was still fresh and delicious. Their handmade noodles (that's why it's called the Noodle Factory!) are very tender and soft. They have rather low prices for generous portions of authentic Chinese food. I definitely recommend this cozy restaurant for a quick, cheap, and delicious meal!"

We had no service whatsoever and nobody seemed to talk english nor french. They were obviously annoyed by our lack of mandarin. I speak three languages lady, i'm doing the best I can!we ordered a selection of different dumplings and she kept showing us other things on the menu like she wanted us to change our order. No, i want dumplings, DUMPLINGS.When we finally got them, they were very good, all of them. Well steamed and very tasty by themselves. I didn't try the sauce they brought as there was suspicious looking crumbs or disgusting bits in it."
/user_details?userid=hBADi4exXG7eTd90WKwQjw,Eric L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Very good price for quantity, my table ordered #21 hand pulled pork and veggie noodles and it was 8.50$ after tax! However, the noodles were overcooked and soggy which took a way a lot of the quality. Furthermore, it wasn't so much a bowl of noodles or ramen like I was expecting, but more like a dish with lots of veggies and pork with some broth poured in as an afterthought. It definitely had a more Chinese food vibe/taste than I would've liked, as opposed to other noodle places (like pho or Lan zhou noodles), and was kind of sloppy overall.The service was great though! Very nice man who was waiting on us, attentive with water and tea. The place is pretty small, the biggest tables seat four and there's maybe space for twenty people total in there.I did only try the number 21 noodles so it's possible the rest of the menu was better."

Lots of vegetarian options!!! The menu has accurate pictures of the food so you can see what you're ordering. I got the shanghai noodles and they were perfect. Will definitely be coming back! Cash only though so come prepared.

There are a number of fresh Asian greens that can be ordered as well to accompany your meal but the stars of the show are the hand pulled noodles or the Shanghai noodles served dry with vegetables or souped if you prefer. Whatever you like, you will like the Noodle Factory and this little resto deserves a place near the top of your list when visiting Montreal."
/user_details?userid=AdYDenR1oXNCwnQr-17zwg,Lanni C.,"Jersey City, NJ",1 star rating,"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED... I myself is part Chinese & my bf is full Chinese. I love sharing my culture & our food. My boyfriend & I travel a lot and we love to check out the Chinatowns at all the places we go to, especially him. We saw the good reviews this place got so we decided to check it out. Noodle soup after a long day of walking & exploring Montreal on a cold winter day sounds like a great ideas right?! I regret it. But let me give some pros & cons. Pros: We got seated right away & it was a busy Friday night. The service was so so. Nothing to brag about. The food came out quick and hot. The prices are very cheap. Cons: Cash only. For a place called ""Noodle factory"" one would think there will be a LARGE selection of different noodle entrees to choose from. NOT. They have a handful but it's more of like corner Chinese store selections. I couldn't decide what I wanted because the menu didn't really intrigue me so I went with the classic wonton noodle soup. You can't mess up with that right? WRONG. Typically, wonton noodle soup contains egg noodles, a thin yellow noodle. The menu didn't specify so I asked the waiter can I have it with egg noddles. He quickly gave me an attitude as if he was upset or something and pointed to the menu and told me to pick one of their other noddles. I didn't want to make a scene so I told them I'll take it as it, however they make them. My bf order their spicy pork & vegetable handmade noodles. As soon as they brought out my wonton noodle soup, I was already disappointed. The bowel did not look appeasing at all. First, there were shredded cabbage in the soup. NEVER have I had it with that. Traditionally there's bok choy & green scallions & this bowl didn't have neither of that. The noodles was probably their hand noodles which was a thicker white noddle. Both the noodle & shredded cabbage was over cooked. The broth was flavorless, actually tasted like shredded cabbage. The wontons looked liked tiny amount of pork was quickly shoved into the wonton sheets & they didn't care if the meat fell out or not. There was already barely meat to begin with. Same goes for my bf's bowel. The noddle soup was so bland, we had to force ourselves to even try to eat half of it because we didn't want to waste food. I'm pretty sure they can tell we didn't really enjoy our food because after we paid, they felt the need to come to our table & remind us to leave tip on the table. We literally just got up to put our coats on, not even a full minute took place yet. As nasty as I may review a place, I ALWAYS LEAVE TIP. Heck, I work for tips myself at a nail salon. So for a place to be like that, it made my experience even worse. So after this terrible experience, we actually went to go eat Ramen noodle at another location outside of Chinatown & it was AMAZING!"

Was directed here by the good reviews so was expecting too much I guess. Really wasn't impressed by the food. Might try other dishes one day but didn't stand up to our expectations. The noodles in the soup were soggy and overcooked, even before the broth cooked them more. The dumplings were too sweet-- tasted like peanut butter and honey on wontons.. very strange. The beef chow fun tasted more like a pad sew that you'd get at thai express. Disappointed."

Excellent flavor with a thick fried skin. Pair that with a sweet dumpling sauce and it's such a cheap dish for a meal.Onion Pancake - I think the menu had called it a crepe and it's not your typical scallion pancake you're used to. They almost look like crepes stacked and fried on top of each other so you get a nice thick crunch biting into them.Pork Soup Dumplings #13 - aka Xiao Long Bao (not formally called that on their menu). Unfortunately I have to compare coming from NY where there's places that out perform this quality. You get 9 pieces but they're small and not filled with enough soup as I'm used to. They stick together in the steam container and the skin is thin. When you try to peel a piece it ends up ripping the skin and spilling the soup out. Overall it's very picky of me, but the flavor of the pork is still there at least.Service is super friendly too. Well worth a visit and don't forget, CASH ONLY!"

The 3 restaurants we randomly dropped into while walking down Chinatown: Restaurant Noodle Factory, Restaurant Pain Farci, and Qing Hua. We only ordered their juicy pork dumplings at each place.Restaurant Noodle Factory -  4 stars. The 6 dumplings weren't very juicy but they were tasty and I really enjoyed their sweet dipping sauce. Worth the $10 price tag. Restaurant Pain Farci -  4 stars. The dumplings here were super soupy, flavorful, and ginormous, hence the $13/$14 price tag for 10 pieces.Qing Hua =  1 star. The worst dumplings we've ever tasted...unless you like tons of extra hard dough with your dry dumplings. I would caution anyone from going there. Boo! Thumbs down NOTE: We've been to a few Din Tai Fung restaurants in Singapore, Japan and southern California so we have something to compare the dumplings to."

It's very dirty but no surprise since it's in China town. Food is great and portions are big. It's very cheap too. However, the workers kept asking me questions so it was annoying. Since it's dirty it makes me wonder how clean the foods are... I found a piece of something in our noodle. Also, the server touched the end of our food when serving. so I'm done with this place. the seat and chairs.. I had to clean with my own sanitizer wipes. Overall, food was big and good but I don't want to risk my health. I don't recommend this place."

Went with a group of friends and ordered a bunch of things from the menu, all 'meh'. The shrimp and pork dumplings were tiny and not fresh at all. The soup dumplings were shrunken and also not fresh. Hot and sour soup was bland. We ordered a bowl of noodles with meat sauce that was okish. All in all, the food looked like it was all pre made and stuck in a freezer for months.

This place was fast, relatively inexpensive, and pretty good.I got the Shrimp Dumplings (#3) and the Xiao Long Bao (Pork Dumplings #13) for lunch which was $11 and change. My food was ready in a little over 5 minutes. Both dumplings were good, my only complaint was that the skin was a little bit on the thicker side on both of them. The filling in both of them were flavorful. On the pork dumplings, there was not much soup inside them (I'm used to more broth / soup inside).All in all, a good lunch place if you're around the Palais de Congres - it's only 1.5 blocks away. Cash only, and a very small space - it gets crowded for lunch but the food comes quickly."

A solid lunch spot with big portions and yummy classics like the peanut dumplings, imperial rolls, but I'd say avoid the noodle soups. For me at least on a recent trip the noodles were a bit soggy and the noodle to soup ratio was out of control. Noodle overload at the noodle factory. I'll be back though, it's one of those places."

I noticed the restaurant was filled with Caucasian customers which I unfortunately didn't notice until I was already seated - made me feel like the place was not popular with Asian people who have tougher standards with this type of cuisine. Come on, you all know it's true.*Steamed Chinese dumplings: Much to my joy the waiter confirmed that these are ""Xiao long bao"" (soup dumplings). There isn't much broth in it but they're loaded with very flavourful meat. Not the best soup dumplings I've had but they're loaded with meat which made me happy.*Wonton (pork) noodle soup: Decent effort at this classic Cantonese dish. I only tried a spoonful of broth and it was light yet savory at the same time, and didn't taste too much like canned broth. Another member of my table had this and I didn't try any but he said it was good.*Noodles with spicy vegetables & pork: The least impressive dish of the bunch - nothing ""spicy"" about this and the sauce was not salty enough for my liking.*Pork & spicy vegetables noodle soup (with handmade noodle): Nice chewy texture of the  handmade noodles. Broth is nicely flavored with less spice than I would have liked.Friendly service otherwise, and it looks like they charged no tax (but are cash only - you get what you pay for). Keep in mind, not only am I Asian, I grew up on Toronto - so with that experience in mind I feel this place is not amazing but it is okay."

The noodles are very tasty. There is a wide variety, either fried or in hot soup. I especially recommend the ""zhajiang"" noodle. They are infused with a certain home-cooked goodness. Apart from the noodles, you can choose stir fried dishes and a selection of dumplings. Perhaps what is most pleasant is the excellent service we got. The two servers we had were polite, cheery and prompt. Food was served up very fast. Just one word of caution: During lunch time, because of the queue at the door, you will feel compelled to finish up quickly and move off.

We ordered everything to have less salt, and all the dishes that came out still had lots of flavour, without the super saltiness. Beef rice noodle was my favourite, followed my Singapore style fried noodle, then the handmade stir fry noodles with beef. Caution about the Singapore style fried noodle though - when you order it less salt, there is also significantly less curry and spices added to it. We also ordered the steamed soup dumplings but they were only so-so. The staff were friendly and food literally flew out of the kitchen.

I was starving so I would have eaten anything, but the food here is great!  Very small- only about 6-8 tables with an open kitchen.  The location on the edge of Chinatown is convenient- near the Place de Armes metro stop.  This place is cash only so make sure you have some on hand to pay the bill!"

/user_details?userid=j5WXrXjM-VDWJpmdR2fiRg,Yu-Hao L.,"Gainesville, FL",1 star rating,"Short version: there was sand in my dumplings and the server tried to use their hands to pick them out. When I complained about it they lied and said the sand was ""part of the vegetable."" DISGUSTING! and Dishonest.The whole story:My wife and I were craving some dumpling and authentic northern Chinese noodle when we saw this place. They had a bunch of news clips on  their window showing that their owner was a master noodle maker. I don't know if the owner changed or something, the current owner is obviously not that noodle master in the news clips. He was speaking Cantonese. I ordered some steamed dumplings and a bowl of sour-and-hot soup. The soup was good but very small, the portion was not worth $2.75.While drinking my soup I noticed one of the female servers in the kitchen trying to pick something out of a plate with her fingers. This was disgusting to see, but I had no idea what they were picking. When my dumplings arrived, there were strange black spots on more than half of them, but not the other half. So I asked the male server (yes, the one other reviewers mentioned who is touchy with girls) what the black spots were. He said ""vegetables"" and walked away. So I took a bite into one of the dumplings. There was no black spots in the dumplings, just pork and cabbage. So I asked the female server what the spots were, she said they came from the bottom of the pot. I told her they are hard grainy sand and picked one up to show her, she did not even want to see what the spots were, I think she obviously knew, that's why they were trying to pick it out with their fingers. I don't care if they want to put sand in their pots. This is a dishonest restaurant because:1. The noodle master is not there any more, but they still use his name2. Disgusting finger picking in the kitchen3. The male server tried to lie by saying the spots are vegetable.Avoid this restaurant unless you don't care what you are eating.BTW, they use a lot of MSG"

That made me surprised and impressed. I tried to get cold water by myself bcoz it was close to the table (we got tea already) I didnt want to bother them. The older waiter saw me, he stopped me!! and told me to let him fill up ice for us first. Nice! They kept checking us and smiled all the time though with other customers. After done, I asked for a container to pack the left over bcoz the dishes were large. I thought they would give a container same as usual when we ask in most of chinese restaurants...but he said he would do it for me.All aboved, if you dont mind about decoration much, here is another place to fill your energy, reasonable price, nice service and good for take-out!

Instead of getting shrimp with noodles, I ordered chicken for the first time here and it was so strange! I set that aside and only ate the noodles. Texture of chicken did not feel real and was questionable  Not only was their food mediocre, the cashier/manager kept my money until I agreed to give a very generous tip to the 2 waiters that served us in a 5x10 foot restaurant! I was ready to give 15% as I am also in hospitality but this guy kept bragging about their reputation and how hard his staff works that I felt ashamed and gave in. Feeling super violated!"

The prices are super and portions were big, I split my meal in two! Oh and service!

It's not huge inside either, which lends itself to spontaneous takeaway enthusiasts such as myself today. The staff were very friendly and spoke Cantonese with me. They knew what they were doing and had good knowledge of the small but generous menu. I ordered spring onion pancakes, Shanghai noodles, and sweet and sour pork to go. These guys are professionals--I had my food ready to take away with me within 7-8 minutes and everything tasted pretty good. The quality of meat they used for the sweet and sour pork could be better but that's not what you go to a place like this for!

You have to push this door mightily - there's even a sign that says ""push hard"". Across the top of the open kitchen, where photos of about a dozen dishes. One of them was General Tao for $9.95 (including taxes - cash only). The server was kind enough to seat me and serve a cup of Chinese tea while waiting for my order, which came out steaming hot in a short time. Of course I had to try a piece fresh and almost burnt my lips. I had to blow on it to get it down safely. Had excellent taste and spice. Forgot to ask for no MSG, but didn't seem to be much if any?

I thought they cooked everything there (the kitchen right next to the dining room, behind the glass), but they actually have 3-4 more people cooking downstairs in a sort of secret kitchen (no wonder meals are ready so quickly!), so the only thing they do in the upstairs kitchen is mix stuff in the wok. I only came to realize this once the window was open during a ""canicule"" this summer (yeap, poor people who work downstairs). 3. I have been there at leat 30 times in the last 5 years and quality is consistently declining.On the bright side I can say that I really like the owner and one of the waiters.
