/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Food is canteen style with some additional plate options on the board. We showed up on a Thursday night around 6 PM and the cupboards were nearly empty. No other clients were in sight during my stay and didn't see any as I passed by to go back to the car an hour later. Not really a great sign. The other location we tried after had non-stop clients coming in and out.I did try out their beef and pork stews (literally everything else I wanted was ""out"") and they were decent. Beef was my preference. Pricing was quite affordable.Service is helpful. I'd see this place more of a quick lunch option if you live/work in the area. I'd pass by again if it's around that time as I don't understand why they stay open with more than half of the canteen being empty."

Some items were more recently cooked while others looked like they had sat there for a while. I ended up going with the beef stew, pancit bihon and tried their palabok pancit as well. The real hit was the beef stew. Rich and fall apart tender. The noodles were just average and nothing to tender wanting to come back to hit up. The food here is good I just believe there are other options in the neighbourhood which are far superior!"

Since my copain is Filipino I let him pick which dishes we would have. He chose the cripsy pata, which is a whole pig's foot deliciously fried so that the skin was still juicy but crispy. I'm sure you can't eat this all too often, but it was absolutely fantastic....it reminded me a lot of the Chinese roast suckling pig. Then we also had adobong sitaw (adobo long beans) which was our vegetable choice and I found it to be the perfect compliment to cut through the fattiness of the pork. I didn't have much of the beef dish we got but it had a stew like consistency and was also very good. Overall, I felt like someone's family cooked a special meal for me and it's obvious that they take great care in everything they make."

Been dragged here for the second time and only confirms that this is not my standard Filipino food. Arrived at 10am this place opens at 9, they have a cafeteria style arrangement for the food, already some food looks freshly made yet the others look more than half empty as if they were yesterday's food. Ordered their breakfast, typical fried rice, eggs (oily) and side of meat which they had only 2 options available. Had tapa which was super hard to bite and was just unpleased with the overall experience."

/user_details?userid=JKAKAyrsTLGVUag43Hh0yQ,Todd R.,"Raleigh, NC",1 star rating,"I'm new to Montreal and, being Filipino, I'm touring the town for good Filipino restaurants. I had a pakbet and ginisang mongo combo. The mongo had such a funny taste I think it was going bad in a matter of one hour. While still edible, it shouldn't have been served. This place is just like most Filipino restaurants: they serve tiny portions measured in cups or bowls. No Filipino consumes that tiny amount. So you finish your meal and you're left wanting. I think the combo is worth closer to $8, not the $10 they charge.My search continues."
/user_details?userid=fsavy60lSVeqwW09VsUEbQ,Deanna N.,"Wilmington, DE",5 star rating,I really wish I knew the specifics (names). However what I can comment on is the tenderness of the pork I ate.  There was a savory gravy that was put on the rice.  Soooo good!! This food reminded me soul food! Bitter veggies are rarely sold in a lot of Western restaurants so it was nice to have a balanced meal.  Savery meat and rice coupled with bitter veggies everything tasted fresh!

Sisig, lechon kawali, crispy pata, and lumpiang shanghai are what I usually order. The food is affordable and leaves you satisfied. I've taken non-filipino friends here to introduce them to Filipino cuisine, and they have only shared positive comments."
/user_details?userid=2ve6A6wvhr1rBk0zNlDGfw,Steph S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Best Filipino food. Lovely staff. All the little things I was hoping for, from sizzling Sisig to Ube cookies, warm and soft in the middle. So good. I'm dreaming of my next visit."
