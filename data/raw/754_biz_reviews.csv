I could have given it 5 stars if the service was faster and more reliable and the food is not a hit-and-miss. The Fetah hummus and scrambled eggs and cheese are my recommendations. The Manaiche(pies/flatbread) are hit-and-miss. Their falafel is not bad, but I find it a bit too dry for my taste.In general, it all depends on on who is in the kitchen and who is serving you. Chances for good food are higher if it is the Syrian folks shift!"

So good and fresh.  We had the foul the labneh and the fatteh as well as the hummus with the meat and the eggs with vegetables. As for the pizzas both were delicious. We had the kecheck and the cheese with muhamara. Would definitely go back. For 4 people the bill came out to 80$ with tax and tip. Well worth it.

Everything is amazing. From A to Z , I am always satisfied with the food. Although I only tried their breakfast , i can still assure you that everything else is amazing. The balila is so tasty , the dough of the manouches is to die for. As for the service , the girl who works there isn't a good waitress. I have asked her many times for pickles and she replied to me many times that they didn't have but clearly they did. I had to get up from my seat to go see the owner and to have him hand them to me. I had to get up to go get myself our own glasses of water. Anyways , this is not a deal breaker , because although she is not a good waitress I wouldGo back in a heartbeat."

We inquired why and the manager explained that it was impossible to fulfill the demands of the customers having one oven that needs a certain temperature for the manaaesh and another for the bread. People were getting frustrated as we were that we were not getting bread fast enough. Now it makes sense why. So owner had to remove the fresh bread option. Which is a bit disappointing but it was either that or having unhappy unpatient customers. So I agree with him. And honestly their food is delicious. Especially the fatteh. So we'd go back for that alone!

The food is good, the staff is very friendly, the place is clean, decoration is really nice for a breakfast place (that's my impression as a Lebanese guy for a place that serves platters like Man'ousheh, foul etc.., even though the place serves lunch dishes as well)"
