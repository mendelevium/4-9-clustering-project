/user_details?userid=xg_96kkO-lF9oCc1PzrQgA,Leo L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"What can I say about this spot?First. It offers what a taco should taste like. There is a special circle in heaven for those who add fries in a taco. Yes, this is legit Mexico City street tasting. I may be around the rest of Mexico, but this is my reference.2. Quantity. Not many taco restaurants in Montreal make a taco so large that with only 3 you're done for the day. This is also a nice trait. 3. Campechano and Lengua tacos. Best tacos there is. No discussion. Your argument is invalid. Many places stopped selling the campechano (beef stake and chorizo mix) without reason. This place stays strong and puts the Mexican cuisine where it is suppoosed to be. No wonder why this place skyrocketed so quickly. I still have to try their veggie options, so I am a bit biased on that side.This is one of the spots that will make you forget about 2020 and take you to another dimension of taste and delight. 5/5#NoEraPenal"

/user_details?userid=CtBx4yk_QM8ClITgw94TPQ,Simon P.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Dear Victor,You make really good tacos. Why do you have to spoil them by putting fries on top?My extensive knowledge of tacos (based on years of eating them + watching Taco Chronicles on Netflix) says that's not very authentic.I had been to Tacos Victor years ago and remember thinking they were a bit dry. But I went back today and it wasn't the case - they were really good! I had Bavette and Shrimp and they were both great. The shrimp was particularly tasty, not overcooked.I pushed aside the fries and enjoyed the tacos. The tortilla is quite good, the sauces excellent, there is a lot to love here!"
/user_details?userid=RrvBEf3Dwk57-6s0fJZwFw,Jiro K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Really wonderful place. Great people and service and the food is SO tasty! Several of their tacos come with french fries on top. I didn't think that would work but - to my surprise - it's really wonderful. They recently added an Al Pastor taco too (that one doesn't come with fries and is also very good). I actually try to drop by at Tacos Victor on the walk back home every time that I get a haircut (at Notorious Barbershop - a bit west on Notre Dame from there).I highly recommend this place.
/user_details?userid=hjHrV1WzO8RDRYJ-ep2OZA,Daniel G.,"Saint-Jérôme, Canada",4 star rating,Really great service! Nice place. Ordered some tacos and they came with a lot of fries. So not really authentic if that's what you're looking for. Taste good but I think next time I will ask to not put fries in my dish. It's just a question of personal preference.
/user_details?userid=rkPrz6uwJIefZdH2Oqv4Tg,Christian C.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I had the taco vege without the cheese and cactus and it was a delicious vegan taco. Great tacos are not easy to find in Montreal and I was really impressed. Also, the taco is quite huge, one might be enough but leftover taco is a good taco too."
/user_details?userid=yphnJ8zYbJF7Y3QbtMj91g,Shahanaz B.,"Southwest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"It is hard to find authentic and delicious tacos in Montreal. Taco Victor is near my place. I always passed by; and it is almost always packed. Today, the day came for me to render a visit there with my sister(my food buddy). It's is tiny place; with high stools and tables, plus mini spot outside. We decided to sit outside. I placed my order, we got ceviche with pita, and three different tacos (bavette, chorizo and shrimp). Beside the cash counter, there are three large mortars with three types of sauces(mild, hot and very hot) for you to take in tiny little containers with your food plus with wedges of limes. The hot sauce was the best. Plus, we got non alcoholic sangria soda, Jarritos orange soda. Finally, our orders were presented to us. What a delightful surprise, our tacos were sprinkled with French fries. We bought our food outside. We devoured the food like animals. It was so good that I don't have words to describe. For my sister, it was the best tacos ever... and she is already asking me when are we coming back again."
/user_details?userid=Q6f-wmLKk6kPIq648ybmbw,Shiran B.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,This can be good .. I just dont understand why cant they put a sauce that doesnt require the hot sauces you need to put yourself.. like they can be a little more creative..I found the taco to be extremely dry. Not my jam
/user_details?userid=olXCtcirQvdJ8yLCAK7FJQ,Maggy V.,"Laval, Canada",3 star rating,"The taste of the dishes for each taco is good, the only bad thing is that the tortillas are always riping apart and a little soggy if you dont eat fast. The service is too slow. Went on a busy day; after wanting just one more taco, we waited for 25 min, yes just for one more!"
/user_details?userid=LrsX8ioOG6GEIHfsXI_9GA,Sarah M.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"For $6.50 you get an overstuffed soft shell taco with some fries. The ingredients are of great quality, the service is quick, and there are like 6 menu options total.That being said, the fries should come on the side, the staff need to be more outgoing and ready to take customer orders, and the way they have their sauces displayed is (sadly) very unhygienic.Would definitely stop by on a weekly basis for lunch if I worked nearby."
/user_details?userid=ZYKRctX9-FbmfNqC606rsQ,Roberto C.,"Cote Saint-Luc, Canada",5 star rating,Excellent tacos.  My kids and I order the chorizo and we really enjoyed them.  My wife ordered the bavette and she also really enjoyed it.
/user_details?userid=3vGiPNH4yCAj88-kfdvbjw,Noha G.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"After hearing a few rave reviews about this place from various friends, I finally tried these famous tacos and all I can really say is meh..The fries are yummy but the tacos kinda taste like nothing. Had a beef and a veggie one and neither had much flavour. Not sure if the flavour is supposed to come from added hot sauce but I was hoping that the contents of the tacos would be marinated or flavoured somehow.Anyways, not much to say. I see awesome reviews so maybe I came on an off day but I won't be returning unfortunately!"
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"Yummy and filling taco for $6.50. Not bad! The flavors were really good, the bavette and shrimp were cooked perfectly and I loved the 3 choice of sauces. It's a small place with counters where you can stand and eat, or 4 chairs to eat at inside. There are benches you can sit at outside the resto too. Cute & basic decor. Loving all of the Mexican options around the Sud-Ouest area!"
/user_details?userid=5pvqFOVS2wb_y81t7iE0Bw,Denise K.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This was perhaps my most disappointing experience with a taqueria ever, and boy am I ever a taco fan, never mind a Mexican food aficionado!I ordered 3 tacos at the hefty price of $6.50 each from Uber eats. I had been in a taco mood for days!!! Ladies and gentlemen, who wants to eat tacos filled with French Fries? All of the tacos except the ceviche taco was filled with greasy French Fries! They were inedible! The only one I was able to eat was the ceviche taco! I had to fish out the beef and eat it separately from the taco. I think they were trying to make their own tortillas, but that didn't work out too well either as their tortillas were undercooked and stuck together. Overall it was a real waste of time, money and I shall never attempt to eat there or order from there again. Seriously, tacos slathered with French Fries? A real crime and an insult to real Mexican food. Just take a look at the pics!"
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Location: On Notre-Dame West. Street parking is available - I don't recall seeing meters, but I wasn't paying attention. The closest subway is probably St. Henri and you'd have to walk from there.The place: It's tiny and meant to be more of a take-out joint then a sit-down place. They do have bar-type seating at the front with about 4 chairs. The two other counters don't have any seating so you'd have to stand. There's one tall chair and I was lucky enough to snag it because I'm quick like that.The goods: I stopped in for a quick lunch and went with the shrimp taco. The shrimp were perfectly grilled and flavourful, served on two soft taco shells with fries on top (!). Cucumber, radish and cilantro were served on the side. I enjoyed the taco, and one was enough for me. The fries were great too! Now, pay attention when you go or you'll do like I did - totally miss the salsa and guacamole that's located right next to you when you pick up your order. Literally. It was RIGHT there. Service: Friendly.Price point: To me, $6 for a taco is expensive. Back in Vancouver, you'll pay about $3 for the same size but there's more variety in terms filling. That said, this place is a great place to stop in for a snack."
/user_details?userid=veFSHTJ9O3GoP0KhqXyfCA,Claudio S.,"Laval, Canada",2 star rating,"Feel my review is not fair, this used to be one of my favourite taquerias in Montreal, back then would have given 5 stars, but my last visit was very disappointing. Upon stepping in perceived a funky smell, like a heavy B. O., tried to pick up the source, but cannot assure what it was. Then the actual tacos, the tortillas were not fully cooked, so besides the taste they did not hold the meat, got saggy and broke. Hope Victor Tacos re-evaluate and come back strong."
/user_details?userid=_nUZIhzfoGUYLwCfcl9d8g,Anna Jane M.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Soooo delicious!! I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. Warm cheery welcoming vibe! Amazing food and lovely people! After your taco I recommend getting the slightly spiced coffee and melt-in-your-mouth cookies to top it all off. Yummmm I would happily eat here every day!!!
/user_details?userid=6CJHRh9scp9DGpUARqdrXQ,Andrew G.,"Rochester, NY",3 star rating,"Tacos Victor, in concept, is a really great idea, and for all intents and purposes should be a really great place.  They keep it simple, focusing just on tacos with a few drinks, with awesome choices for cuts of meat (e.g. beef tongue, sirloin, and flap steak) and other proteins, but in the execution of everything together, the taco at the end of the day fell a little bit flat for me, especially for $6 CAD/portion.Ironically though, I have no complaints about the meat!  I had the beef tongue taco when I stopped by and they gave me a decent-sized portion that was soft, tender, and still juicy as if it just came out of a long-braise or pressure cooker. If I'm remembering it correctly, they also sprinkled some coarse sea salt on the top of it as well which really made the flavor of the meat come alive.  The problem unfortunately was on the bottom AND the top of the taco.  For some reason completely unknown to me, they put thinly-cut soggy fries on top of the meat, and then below, they layered it with TWO not-at-all-toasted corn tortillas.  Now two corn tortillas is not totally uncommon based on a few encounters I've had here and there, but for me it almost completely ruined the dining experience.There's nothing worse than biting into far too much bread when trying to enjoy a protein.  Whether you're having a burger, a lobster roll, or even a taco, too many carbs surrounding the goodness within will downpour rain all over your day anyday.  As much as I was trying to enjoy the lime, salsa, and salted tongue, all of the flavors kept on being torn away by this awful chewy double-tortilla with soggy potatoes on top.  I eventually just removed the awful breadiness myself to try and enjoy the meat more, but at that point it was already too late.If they just served the meat on a crisp tortilla with your standard taco accompaniments, I feel like they would be far more successful.  Unfortunately as it stands today, the entire dining experience is weighed down by an egregious amount of dough.  If you do happen to stop by, please keep this in mind and maybe ask them to add more ""customization"" to your order to get a really fine product, because at the very minimum, the meat they cook is very good."
/user_details?userid=5QrlMMzUq_RoUlEyH2zcig,Judy K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Good location; and nice decor.Little menu is very simple and doesn't explain much. We ordered three tacos, shrimp, Bavette and carnitas. All very basic. They are served with soggy fries on top of them and cilantro, Not great but not horrible. The shrimp one was good but i chalk that up to the really good hot sauce/salsa you can choose from. Hot and very hot were delicious. Probably wouldn't go back. Just didn't do it for me."
/user_details?userid=jMHlwDq5b2zqhV5TyyFKPA,Yojna J.,"Victoria, Canada",5 star rating,"This is probably my new fav taco place as the tacos are freshly made and so delicious. I had the shrimp and vegetarian ones and they were both full with flavours and tasted so good. The sauces on the side were my favourite. I also love the fact that they had fries on the tacos, add fries to any meal and you'd be a happy camper but on tacos; totally rocked this idea whoever had it :)"
/user_details?userid=qFX1s6XuipkQ54k6wcXjmA,Janet R.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,I really liked this place. Great tacos. My only complaint is that $6.50 is a bit pricey for one taco. Even though they do add fries on top and it's pretty filling.
/user_details?userid=FTsYsxk0-vsSk4uil1VD5g,Feifei L.,"Chicago, IL",4 star rating,"I was very hesitant to come here because of the pictures that others posted: fries in tacos?? How can the taco taste any good?? I was wrong because the tacos are delicious here. Every Mexican knows that sauce is the key to a good taco - it brings out the soul of a taco and they have three authentic and delicious sauces for you to serve on your tacos.Something that I would like to be able to do, is to separate the two tortillas and make two separate tacos with each serving. Kinda difficult to do if they're stuck together."
/user_details?userid=c2voPbeHUhTmpcfX0rpooQ,Esther H.,"Flushing, NY",5 star rating,"I'm originally from NYC and I've never had tacos like this before. My friends and I visited Montreal for 3 days. We originally planned to go to Arthur's Nosh, but unfortunately it was closed. Our hunger forced us to walk around near our Airbnb place and we came across Tacos Victor. It was the best decision. We got the Campechanos and the Shrimp Tacos. A-mazing. Each bite had a burst of flavor, especially with the choice of 3 hot sauces. We actually ended our trip with Tacos Victor LOL. I'll miss this place.."
/user_details?userid=ro1Wabvc7q1oM0PapbOWDQ,Gabriela S.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The tacos at this place are flavourful and the service is friendly. I can see that there are a few people here who are criticizing the price point and portion size but it worked well for me (and trust me when it comes to tacos I start to really identify with the ""bet you can't have just one"" mentality). I walked by and got 1 taco for 6 dollars with fries piled on top and it filled me right up on a hot summer day. The salsa is delicious and the menu is sparse because NEWSFLASH it's much easier and better to concentrate on making small delicious menu than to have a lot of choice but sacrifice quality.I've brought several of my friends since and they have all exclaimed that it is the best taco they've ever had in the city. I don't know if I can say that (because of childhood allegiances - I think I may have a blood oath with another place), but it's the best one that I've had in St Henri and very high on the list!"

They've got a dearth of vegetarian selection. The French fry/bland Métro market Saputo plastic mozzarella/mushroom taco is unpleasantly stodgy. People of the world ! hear me with your heart of hearts when I say to you that, I, your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man doth love and respect the French fry as well as the taco ... but never, ever, should the twain meet. French fry is French fry and taco is taco and never shall the twain meet again in my mouth ever; fo' 'eva'eva. The horchata was also meh. It was rather sweet and tasteless. I want more rice and more true cinnamon in my horchata. Anyway I'm going to hightail it on over to Taco Tijuana on Ouest Sherbs and Royal where the tacos are double the size and half the price!

This is my first one star rating for a mom and pops shop. It was my first time at victors and I asked the cashier for two of the best tacos. She ordered us the steak and pork, then the steak... First off why did you suggest TWO steaks!?! When I checked the bill and found out it was two steaks I asked for shrimp and instead of accommodating to a first time customer. The cook said no because he put the meats on the grill already and made it so difficult when I asked to pay to replace the steak. Why would you not make a new customer happy?? Their turnover is so quick that even if they didn't give the steak to me, someone right after me would order it. Overall I will never return and the tacos f***ing sucked !"

Whereas the pricing is very reasonable, the tacos are 50% soggy french fry which is both odd and deceptive when you think you're getting a full taco. The tacos took a long time to prepare and in such a small place with alot of people waiting it gets a bit uncomfortable pretty quickly. They also double up on the tortillas also so between that and the mound of fries it lacks the flavor of the other ingredients."
