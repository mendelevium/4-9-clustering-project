You can play it safe and get the pad thai with shrimp if you must, but if you need some real HEAT you've got some great options here. Pak boong is stir fried morning glory greens with a lot of chilis and garlic and it's so satisfyingly hot but if you want to step into the irresistible fire of the bird's eye choose the item with 'kaprao' in its name. You will momentarily die in the fire--but then awaken with knowledge of the afterlife. Not everything on the menu is this intense so don't be frightened. If you enjoy Thai cuisine you're probably not a mild & wimpy type anyway. Overall their takeout is a safe bet and I'm a regular."
/user_details?userid=oTXacfmCLz9mev6KORIfEQ,Anna C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is one of the best meals I've had all year!! Flavors of each dish were extraordinary. They offer many vegan dishes and my order was ready in just 10 min! My favorite dish was Gaeng Kari, which is a Thai curry soup and it had seasonal vegetables (tomatoes, potatoes and eggplant). I also have to say that their fried chicken was some of the best I've had and it stayed perfectly crispy even after a 30 min drive home.We ordered:1. Gaeng Kari vegan2. Pad thai3. Pad kaprao porc (spicy ground porc with rjce and egg)4. Fried chicken5. Gaeng Kiow wan (green curry soup)6. yum galamplee vegan (salad)Cannot recommend pumpui enough, support local #28days!"
/user_details?userid=khRG2oMmAOXA7C1U7P1j4w,Michael L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Yes the flavours are pretty authentic, but that doesn't mean you can serve lukewarm food, with barely any pieces of added meats (extra to the meal) at such a price. I came here on a Friday night and it was pretty packed. I was with my girlfriend and had to wait around 10 minutes after ordering at the counter to be seated. Since it was so busy, we ended up sharing our booth with another couple. I didn't mind this too much because the booths were long enough to not be disturbed. When we received our meals, we noticed at first bite that the food was not as hot as what you'd expect at restaurants. It tasted like it was removed from its heat source a while before and had cooled down quite a lot. Nonetheless, we continued to eat because the flavours took us back to our trip to Thailand. The dishes were quite authentic. However, the fried Chinese broccoli and crispy pork dish somewhat disappointed. The flavours were great, but there was a total of 4 small pieces of the pork, even though it was charged extra by roughly $4. Yes, $4 is not much, but I was still expecting there to be more than just a bite for a dish costing roughly $12 (without the added fee for crispy pork). Overall, if I go back, I'd try the pad Thai even though it's not the most genuine Thai dish. It seemed like it was freshly made as there was steam coming from the dish. Also, I did not enjoy the interactions with the woman at the counter taking our orders. She did not seem friendly at all and did not bother to speak up a little bit louder as the restaurant was quite loud."
/user_details?userid=wJF-NdtxYCk_SrwG4UUL9Q,Stephanie L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I was really craving Thai food, so we came to this place. I liked the interior, really gave me the vibe of being in Thailand. Their menu was with authentic Thai names and a small description. I would like to preface this review saying that my boyfriend and I love spicy food and very often eat it. We've got an extensive hot sauce collection and use it for almost every meal at home. So we can eat spicy food. I ordered the curry vert and he ordered some pork stir fry that I don't remember the name of. The food was made to order and brought to us at the table outside. It looked great! Then we took some bites, it was ridiculously spicy. I am Asian and have eaten many curries, but never had a spectacularly spicy green curry, it's usually mild. Both of our dishes were so spicy, that we couldn't finish them. We drank so much water while eating, and water doesn't help spice attacks. After, we had the mango sticky rice, which wasn't bad. It's one of my favourite desserts, but I've had better. This wasn't the end... as we are walking home, I start hearing my stomach rumble and then begin experiencing significant pain. Let's just say it was a very rough evening. My boyfriend was spared, until the middle of the night, when he had terrible pains as well. Both of us continued to feel sick until the morning. This morning. In future, there should be a warning of exactly how spicy the items are. Given how much we like spicy food, I didn't think it would be such a problem, but it felt like we were swallowing molten lava."
/user_details?userid=DD4KCmjAdJiJfv6yJcb4Uw,Virginia L.,"Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Just WOW! This place is worth the wait. It gets pretty busy. The story about the chef is that he is Canadian and spent a good period of his life in Thailand and brought the cuisine back to Montreal. Aren't we lucky!? We ordered the green curry (spicy), the pad Thai (of course), by the way, this is the best pad Thai I have had in Montreal, and the crispy chicken wings. So good! I fully appreciated the dinner style ambiance of the place. Very chill and non-pretentious. Although, be careful when you grab a seat. There is a tendency of people not respecting your staked out spot and then sliding in to your seats. No joke, this happened to us. People be ruthless out in these streets.Enjoy peeps! This place is a gem."
/user_details?userid=akCG-uYnMqaRR0fr1zpyig,David G.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow! My favorite Thai place in Montreal so far. I was quite impressed with this cute little resteraunt/mini marketplace in little italy. Pad Thai was amazing, the right amount of flavor and a generous amount of noodles that lasted me two meals. I also really enjoyed the red curry which had such a great blend of veggies, spices, and a really generous amount of chicken that was perfectly cooked and tender. I really need to try the fried chicken as well as I've seen so many great reviews for it. Expect to pay 14-15+, but it's so worth it! Especially because it is so filling that you wi be able to save some for later. So glad I found this place!"
/user_details?userid=MWCPUFk-fnNXehPosCtwHA,Geneviève F.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Love this little semi-hidden gem. Fast service, tasty food. Options for meat lovers and vegans as well. The curries vary quite a bit so it keeps me interested in coming back. Quick tip - It is quite spicy. I enjoy a good amount of spice  and feel level 1 and 2 are spicy enough for me. 3+ gets quite intense! Get level 0 if you cannot handle heat :)Why not 5 stars is because it's a bit pricey and on some days, some of the curries may not be  as  filling / tasty... Lacks a tad of consistency / predictability.I recommend trying the mango sticky rice and splitting it with a friend. It's yummy!"
/user_details?userid=Se4lEciWLvXdghD4J7bRqA,Alegria M.,"Pomona, CA",5 star rating,Ok I don't know why I hadn't posted this review sooner but wow can I just say this is the best Thai food I've ever had EVER!! It's super shocking that the best Thai food I ever had was here in Canada when I came to visit colleges in Montreal for the weekend. I'm from Southern California and I've had tons of Thai food and for some reason Pumpui is just magical!!! I had the beef panache. I would have to say my favorite food is probably anything that's served with a fried egg on top--But seriously this beef panang was KILLER!! It was the best I've ever had and I've had it many times in the USA. The meal is made from ground beef mixed with tons of spicy hot chili peppers and basil and mint. The staff warned me this was the HOTTEST dish they made. But between you and me it could be hotter. I even added chili oil on it after a few bites. It was still amazing though and I wish I could have more of it right now !! My friends also got the basic pad Thai and a chicken curry dish but we were all blown away at how spectacular the food was for being so simple and again for being made in this small place in the middle of Montreal. Amazing! Truly the best!! Congrats to the chefs--you're awesome!
/user_details?userid=FCoOfa1Xp2GGSopTOz_vWQ,Connor F.,"Owen Sound, Canada",3 star rating,"Good. Not great. Pad Thai was very fishy and the green curry doesn't even compare at all to Restaurant Thailand just a 10 minute walk away. It's also very crowded and while the service is good it's so crowded that the server had to reach over me (I had to duck while eating) so he could get water for other guests. Also there isn't a single Thai person there. It was a very hipster kind of a vibe and staff, and it was crowded, loud, and not super comfortable, but the food was solid. Not exceptional, but solid. Not going back personally but worth trying if you are curious! The fried chicken was the highlight!"
/user_details?userid=pQHI4jeu4gKEV4lK5tsmQg,Spencer J.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"Excellent, reasonably priced, authentic Thai food with cool outdoor seating and now beer. We had the fried chicken, pork curry special, corn salad, and mango sticky rice. All were superb-the pork was super fatty and delicious, the mango sticky en fuego, and the fried chicken is the best I've had in Montreal so do be sure to try. My only minor complaint would be the food is not very spicy but they have some great spices that you can add on your own so this is really more advice for customers than any sort of critique. This place rules."
/user_details?userid=jpF5VxuG9moPTZzDfAPuSA,Tram L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I finaly went to have lunch here with a couple of friends after a while of hearing so many good things and was not disappointed!The place is small, nice and clean, everyone is friendly and helpful, makes you want to overstay your welcome XDThe menu is quite straightforward, you can also just look at the food right behind the glass pane and you'd probably end up doing what I did by ordering almost everything... My friends were late and I didn't even wait for them to order... :PWe took quite a few things: -the papaya salad (wasn't my fav as I'm not a fan of the raw green beans and I think the dried shrimps could have used a bit of smashing)-Pad Thai-fried chicken hmmmmm...-a few curries: pork belly, fish and the jungle one which were all very yummy!Be prepare and brace yourself for some spicy stuff. Bring friends so you can try more stuff LOL!!!!! I wish I could have eaten more, for real so I'm definitely coming back."
/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"One wouldn't exactly expect to head up to Little Italy for some good Thai food but that is exactly where I found myself over the last few weekends - being drawn to St-Zotique street by the call of curry and chicken wings. Épicerie Pumpui is a 'lan khao gangs' - a combination curry shop and grocery store that is common in Thailand but mostly nonexistent in North America and certainly here in Montreal. Chef Jesse Mulder - who had run Thai delivery service Chak Wow prior to opening this brick and mortar spot - and his partners opened up Pumpui a little less than 2 years ago.The space is very casual in style - with about 12 seats in-house and ordering at the counter. The small grocery section sells a variety of Thai ingredients and items. The menu is relatively small - 5 ready to serve options and then another 5 or 6 a la carte items. The menu consists mostly of curries and more obscure dishes for a North American audience as well as a few other 'classic' dishes like Pad Thai and green curry.First off, I went with the fried chicken wings with sweet chili sauce. Pumpui has developed a reputation for these and yeah I can see why. These were amazing - super crunchy skin, very tender inside and a nice sweet heat coating them. I just needed more!After the wings, I decided to try the Curry Hunglay - a Burmese pork belly, shallot and ginger curry. Had never heard of this dish until I saw it on the menu and enjoyed it tremendously. Very generous portion overall. The curry was mildly spiced which suited my relatively weak spice palette. A nice combination of richness, sweetness and spice. The pork belly was super tender as were the shallots which was a different way for me to enjoy them. An excellent discovery for me.On my second visit, I started with a Hibiscus mint iced tea which was very bright and refreshing.I then decided on the Asii Pian - a dry curry of chicken, thai eggplant, tomatoes, lemongrass and galangal from the Shan region. I had never heard of galangal which is more citrus and piney version of ginger. Very different flavour which came through strongly with the sharp lemongrass notes. Again, like the previous curry, tons of flavour and a very hardy portion. Another hit for me. Given how the majority of true Thai restaurant in the city are more formal affairs, it is great to have such a great Thai counter service to get great flavourful and more unique curry for a quick lunch, takeout or dinner. I know it seems weird to head to Little Italy for Thai cuisine but believe me, it is well worth it.Cheers!"
/user_details?userid=Ux-Fhky1dGHRhBwxmcG-Aw,Lisa T.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"More likely 3,5/5 stars based on the price after tax and tips. Green curry was soso, very mild in taste at ~15$ (comes with a side of white rice), papaya salad was fresh and slightly spicy at ~5$ for a small (while it was good, there are other places that make better papaya salads), and the curry panang was spicy and creamy but the meat wasnt tender at ~20$ (comes with white rice). A good try but likely wont come back, the meal was worth ~30$ than the ~50$ we spent considering all the food is preprepared in a cafeteria style (we also got a hibiscus mint iced tea that sounded a lot better than it tasted; barely any mint taste and very tart from the hibiscus)"
/user_details?userid=cF1oFZ2cl1xpQIsq-yA4mQ,Aretha C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place serves truly authentic and delicious Thai food! I was super excited to try Pumpui after hearing raving reviews from multiple foodie friends. It's a small epicerie counter service type spot, where they have some pre made curries as well as items made to order. They sell some specialty grocery products, as well as a variety of novelty drinks. I got myself a grapefruit la croix! The restaurant itself cozy but seats are super limited. I got the fried chicken, catfish in red curry, and the pork with morning glory. The fried chicken was absolutely amazing. Loved the marinade and the sauce, delightfully crispy! Sweet, tangy and spicy. Haven't had fried chicken this good tbh. It was $8 for 3 pieces. The catfish was a bit tough in my opinion, and quite spicy. Still an excellent dish though! The pork flank was extremely tender and the morning glory went perfectly with the sauce. Both curry dishes are served with rice and everything had a unique and complex flavour profile. The food was still a bit pricey despite the no-frills eatery vibe, but in terms of quality, it was worth the price."

/user_details?userid=LpPATZ4Gai2OyNKULwg7zw,John H.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"Unbelievable spot! Attended university in Montreal and know the city & its offerings very well. I was SO pleased to find such an incredible gem during my last visit. Brought my brother and a group of his friends to Pumpuii for dinner and found the staff (and owners) to be incredibly friendly and helpful. The food?  Unbelievable! Authentic yet also inventive, this crew has filled a long-standing gap in Montreal's restaurant scene. Plus, many visitors don't properly explore the city and miss out on both Little Italy & the Mile End, so a visit to Pumpuii puts you right in the center of some of Montreal's most vibrant neighborhoods. Their instagram account keeps beckoning me, so I doubt it'll be long before my next visit. Thanks, guys!"

It's like there's way too much fish sauce in the recipe! The meals are way too spicy for me, even the ones with the lowest spiciness level."

There is so much good stuff happening up here, and Pumpui puts me over he moon. There was no wait when I got here today just before noon, and although they are definitely having some opening-week anxiety and mix ups and some menu items weren't available, I was totally delighted with my vegetarian option - a thick and creamy red curry with big chunks of lovely tofu and squash and crispy tart black tomatoes, served with a plate of rice. Service was warm and thoughtful, and the decor is lovely and relaxing and does feel like a loving ode to Thailand. I worry about the cultural appropriation piece, it all feels so full of love for authentic food and culture that I think Pumpui's heart is in the right place, but it will be for Thai people to judge. Meanwhile I'm thankful to be introduced to more authentic tasting and complex Thai dishes and happy to see diversity coming to Little Italy."

/user_details?userid=GbDfPbqp7gKRwbn116KDSA,Ben K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The long awaited harbinger of Thai cuisine has landed. I came a day after opening where apparently they pulled in excess of 300 customers which is impressive for such a small place.The menu is scrawled on sheets above the kitchen counter, prices are attached beside in Sharpie. Prices generally range from $12-16. There's no offer of a menu either on their Facebook or their webpage, and I think you can expect the menu to change regularly.I ordered a fish curry noodle soup (the name escapes me) for takeout; unfortunately, I couldn't get to it until two hours later by which time the noodles had overcooked, but no fault of theirs. According to interviews, they're making a point of offering Thai fare aside from the usual standards of pad thai and green curries that you'll find in most Thai establishments. Even after tasting some mind blowing Thai food in San Francisco earlier this year, there were savory, herbaceous flavors in the curry I couldn't even identify (Thai turmeric?). This, friends, is the Thai food you never knew you wanted."
/user_details?userid=eNORuY4cjyQStMygVSSYZQ,Meimei Z.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"The owner/head chef spent years in Thailand learning recipes from local cooks, this is easily reflected in their homemade curry sauce and meat dishes. The green curry special is my favourite, and we will definitely come back for more soon. The friend chicken is sweet and crunchy, a mice twist to traditional fried chicken. All the dishes are very authentic, definitely worth a try :)"
/user_details?userid=03p4lQyQ3iISeY_BQrP9ww,Sean R.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"These folks nail quite a lot that many establishments don't. First off, they know the scope of what they are going for and play well to it, both in type of service, decor, and keeping a menu small enough that their kitchen can handle it without compromise. Nothing tried to outdo their limitations and I liked that a lot. Their menu is small but covers items that less adventurous can enjoy, while offering a few select items for someone picky (like me) will go for. Most importantly, even though nothing was overly 'exotic' or particularly spicy, their flavours are good. And I mean VERY good. I know Thai food very well, and make it all from scratch, so when I think a somewhat mild curry is deep and complex with a wide range of flavours that says a lot about the prep they do. Their curries were actually 3 dimensional, something so few places know how to do. My kid, who doesn't love much other than Pad Thai LOVED their version, and it was so nice to see them make every dish of it individually, as one needs to.Something else I really appreciated is their design/decor; while going for the low key corner cafe/street food vibe they did it with something that matched the setting. Sure, plastic stools and dirty Thai movie posters are what you'd expect in most eating experiences in Thailand, but in Montreal it would feel a bit put on, and I appreciated that they didn't over do this and simply do what works best for them. It makes it more true, and in fact felt MORE like an authentic Bangkok / SE Asia experience as a result, if that makes sense. Finally, what I noticed most was that everyone, and I mean everyone, was friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be working there. It's like they get it, this is a cool place, doing cool things, get treated as respected employees, and everyone just enjoys themselves. This is a bit of conjecture of course, but that's the vibe I got.So yeah, 4+ stars for doing so many things right, and with ease. I'll only take half a star off because yes, they COULD have at least one or two dishes that blows the lid off and challenges people, especially since I went there on the suggestion that they were doing Southern Thai recipes, which on the night I was there they weren't. That said, the menu rotates and in that sense it's a local experience and if I had opportunity go weekly (or daily) I might feel different. I'll def be back next time in town and who knows maybe add another 1/2 star. In the meantime, this place is near the top of my Thai go to's anywhere, highly recommended."
/user_details?userid=5ca2MkCJFAMafDrRxLMlXQ,Ash L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Although the space is a bit small and the service is a bit slow the time I was there (no offence, but we are in hipsterland :p). I give it 5 stars because I am almost in tears when my tongue detects the authentic Thai flavours with the RIGHT amount of fresh herb in their dishes. The portion is generous and the price is quite a bit lower than other good south East Asian restaurants (Red Tiger, Satay brothers, etc). Of course it's cheaper because it's cafeteria style, but for those days that you just don't want to cook, it's perfect. The vegetarian options are substantial, making it a perfect lunch date option with your vegan friend (I love their fish special tho). It's a true honour for the Thai food theme in Montreal when our streets are saturated with fake business-style Thai restaurants with bland material + 5000% of your recommended daily sodium intake."

It never disappoints. The only mild item in the menu is pad thai so when I recently went there with a friend who cant take heat, i got a chance to try it too. Made to order and delicious; but still prefer the curies. Nice folks, clean space. I wish this place was closer to my home so that I could come more often."
/user_details?userid=Et6YLMrlyX2PCkqtwSVAug,Sabeena S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"You have NOT tried Thai food until you've tried Pumpui! This small epicerie and counter-service restaurant has authentic drinks and groceries from Thailand amidst a small seating area. They have 3 countertops which can each seat 4 people and then about 4 booths that seat 4-6 people comfortably. The bathroom is small and clean. Okay so now about the delicious food. My partner and I ordered the papaya salad to start, which was fresh and a bit spicy with small dried shrimps stirred together (never tried that); it provided a crunchy and flavorful texture but a slightly fishy taste. For our mains, we shared a pad thai and a curry, both with tofu and one with shrimp. They were divine! So extremely flavorful, piping hot, and absolutely delightful for the senses. The aromas were fantastic and after a long day of fasting, their food did not disappoint. They had some Thai style bottled and canned drinks that we decided to try but they definitely did not live up to the quality of the food. I would recommend that they offer some more variety or simply another option for beverages. Overall, an amazing experience and simply a delicious rendition of Thai cuisine."
/user_details?userid=CWnLkmOV9drVdLfn514Q1w,Cheryl Y.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"I went to Pumpui at the recommendation of Eater Montreal, and I wasn't really that impressed. As someone who has spent a lot of time in Thailand, I don't believe that a Pad Thai is supposed to be cold and clumped up together into a heaping pile of noodles. Aside from that, there was not enough flavour and was not at all indicative of cuisine in Thailand. We also got something like an eggplant and pumpkin curry. Flavour was good, but either the eggplant skin or the pumpkin rind wasn't cooked for long enough and left an unfavourable texture, and a chew that was not at all pleasurable. On a good side, the Papaya Salad was lovely - crunchy, good texture and good balance of salty, sweet, sour and spicy. The fried chicken was also great. The restaurant itself is cute. It's half a grocery store, so it doesn't seat very many people. But the booths are clean and comfortable."

Given that their eating area is small (only about 3 booths), I decided to take my food to go. I opted for the papaya salad and pad Thai. The pad Thai was a generous portion and the flavours were amazing. I don't generally like tofu but I have to admit it was delicious in this dish. The papaya salad unfortunately, I had to throw out. The flavours were making me uneasy and the dehydrated shrimp that topped the salad left a lingering taste I just couldn't shake.
