This place is one of the best vegan restaurants you will find. The food is spectacular. The sushi is so creative and unique. You just want to sit and savor every bite. We have never had anything here that wasn't just extraordinarily special. The prices aren't cheap, but they are worth it. Oh-- and the sushi pizza? SO GOOD. Really, not a bad thing on their menu. I'm sitting here wishing I could go there right now. So, if you are lucky enough to be nearby, go get some takeout."
/user_details?userid=9P8-9EUP-aEnuisqUYt5jQ,Kathy S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"They have a streamlined Covid takeout process. The only confusing thing is you have to pick up the takeout next door at a place called Komomo. 1- Go to their website and click ""order"" and then ""order online"". You pay here including tip. They will tell you how long the wait is (usually 20 mins)2- Pickup at their pickup counter which is next door and called ""Komomo"". Komomo actually has a separate review page so I will complete my review there."

We found it slightly overpriced and the wait time for pick up was ridiculous for a weeknight.I would urge anyone who hasn't tried vegan sushi to give it a shot! You won't be disappointed."

Everything we tried- the mango/sweet potato, the momo, the tempura veg , dumplings and one of the fancier sushis (cant remember the name), was delicious!Would recommend."

/user_details?userid=QaM_SfwIY6fZbSYycBBQFg,Deborah K.,"Johnson City, NY",5 star rating,"This place was up and down fantastic.  As someone who tries to eat plant-based as much as possible, and vegetarian always, it's been awhile since I went into a restaurant and I could eat everything they served.  It was wonderful.  The food is delicious and beautifully presented.  Even my meat-eating husband loved it.  What I liked best is that they don't try to make mock-fish for the sushi, they just take really delicious, fresh vegetables, and prepare them beautifully.  We had the omakase for 2, and everything was wonderful.  Service was great.  We had a really friendly waiter who was very helpful with sake selections.  When we're next in Montreal we will be back!"

Well, by making some delicious sushi; that's how.Honestly, everything on their menu is delicious. I'm not gonna tell you what to get or what I had; I'm leaving it all up to your tastebud to decide. Every flavour is elevated in a way to surprise your senses. If you're not adventurous then they have their special ""best seller combos"" for you to try. The presentation of the plates are splendid. The waiters and waitress are friendly; very knowledgeable of their menu. The decor is antic and refreshing.Overall; a gem in the big city of Montreal. A must for sushi lovers, vegan friends, and pregnant woman ;)"
/user_details?userid=LP-8DbFrARGiEavU4BcI6Q,Sha Y.,"Brossard, Canada",4 star rating,"We went on a Sunday night, and it was packed.Cute little restaurant.We are ordered the Omakase for 2: miso soup or salad, beet tatare and taro chips or Papaya salad, 25 sushis and dessert.Looking around at the other tables, there were some groups but mostly two people together, and by the looks of it, most opted for the omakase set menus rather than à la carte. I would too, especially if it was my first time there. Their menu being vegan, is quite unique from what we are used to see and your regular plain avocado or tempura sushis. I've heard from friends and reading other reviews,  prior to going, that they loved their experience and even if you are not vegetarian, wouldn't miss the fish. I had very high hopes and my expectations were met (well mostly!)The miso soup was great for a miso soup. I liked the mushroom as an added touch. It was not overly salty or just salty like you might get sometimes. We chose the Beet Tartare with Taro Chips and it was amazing! It might be one of my favourite thing that night. A good mixture of different textures, with some crunch and it was very palatable. The portion was generous too.We then had the 25 pieces of sushi and honestly cannot remember the names of the 5 rolls, but they were all quite tasty, different, and very original! It was also great fun to try to figure out all the ingredients in each. You can definitely tell that each item of the menu was very well thought of and they must've tested quite a bit what would work, all were complexed, intricate and an explosion of flavour. My least favorite might be the roll that had tomato in it. We were full but of course had space for dessert! The table next to us also ordered the Omakase for 2, and got to the dessert before us. I was excited to see the nicely presented what looked like a royal - chocolate mousse and actually looked forward to ours. When the waiter gave us ours...honestly I was quite disappointed...we were presented with a matcha cake/cupcake placed on a sauce that really looked and tasted like a grocery store bought cupcake cut in half and placed on a fruity diluted compote for the sake of presentation..and the matcha taste did not come through..Oh and it was only when we finished our sushis that it dawned on me that we didn't get edamame like all the tables around got to start with. We were full at this point and would be weird to have them after the main meal, but we asked the waiter if we were supposed to get some and he did not looked surprise and said that yes we should but they didn't have any available to serve for a sec tonite so that was why. Although I did notice all the tables around us had some..even the couple next to us who ordered the exact same thing. It is not a big deal but I did read in other reviews that their flavoured edamame were great! So overall, very tasty and great experience but the dessert was really disappointing so I would actually kinda deduct half a star."
/user_details?userid=8tjx6xsOigLJC07y7yA2BA,JiaYin C.,"Le Sud-Ouest, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"We tried their tasting menu which included: miso soup, edame and a choice between papaya salad or beet tartare and a variety of vegetarian sushis.As someone who isn't really into vegetarian food, I didn't know what to expect from sushis that consist only of vegetables.  To my surprise, there were 5 type of sushis and had a variety of veggies: sweet potatoes, mushrooms(enoki, oyster, portobello), avocado, tofu, etc.. Although each bite were flavourful, they were very salty and I had to drink a lot of water. Nonetheless, each one tasted different  and had a nice texture!The presentation was also adorable and the sushis were brought on wooden plates.I wouldn't classify this as a casual hangout place as the space is pretty small. For people who aren't fond of vegetarian food, you should go at least once! It's worth a try and might even change your opinion on vegetarian food. Their service was fast and the staff are all so friendly!The pricing is on the expensive side, so if you want to try a bit of everything: go for their tasting menu. Definitely need to reserve in advance to eat there, even on a week day! Many people who just show up got turned away."
/user_details?userid=wJF-NdtxYCk_SrwG4UUL9Q,Stephanie L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is an excellent vegan sushi restaurant. I am a sushi fanatic, so I thought I'd be missing the fish, but I didn't! The way in which they crafted the vegetables really replicated the classic sushi feel, and it was extremely filling too! I came here with 3 of my friends, so we opted for the 4 person menu. If you're coming with a group, this is the best way to maximize both cost and variety. The set menu included a choice of 2 appetizers from mango salad, beet tartar and gyozas. We got the tartar and the gyozas, the tartar was excellent very tasty. Next came the rolls, I honestly don't remember what each one was, but what I can say is they were really delicious and each had a unique flavour. Two of the rolls were freshly fried so the waiter told us to eat them first, YUM! If you're looking for a place to bring some vegan or vegetarian friends, look no further!"
/user_details?userid=WMK1j18ACm-EtopEznV4Rg,Jana T.,"Westmount, Canada",4 star rating,"Heard great things about this place and was looking forward to trying it.  Came with the family on a stormy Saturday night.  The place was full, and reservations are definitely needed especially for the weekend.  We were seated quickly and decided to take the tasting menu for 4 people.  We were 2 adults, 2 teenagers, and a 2 year old and it was more than enough food.  We started with very good miso soup, then 2 appetizers, the dumplings and beet tartare.  Then we had an assortment of rolls, about 7-8 different ones to try.  The food is all vegan, and the flavours and textures were really fantastic, very creative and flavourful.  I found a few of the rolls a little too salty but otherwise loved the meal.  The presentation was also visually very attractive.  This would have been a 5 star review except for a few things, the wooden bench we were seated on was really uncomfortable.  Also, service was friendly and attentive at the beginning, but vanished after the main course was served.  Dessert was included in our meal but we waited 45 minutes with dirty plates in front of us before we got it.  Dessert was four small slices of cake, which were very good but not sure they were worth the wait. Amazing vegan food, with some service issues...  would certainly come back and give it another try."
/user_details?userid=4EDFNz5FcbHywqCtcMAmaw,Rose T.,"London, United Kingdom",5 star rating,"Everything about Sushi Momo is spectacular! After reading reviews, my friend and I made sure we got there right before it opened so we could secure a table. We decided to have ourselves a feast and ordered a ton of food- way more than we could handle, but the sushi was still amazing as leftovers. Everything was amazing, but one item that was incredibly unique and I still dream about it til this day is their poutine. They totally nailed the Japanese fusion take on a Canadian delicacy. Love love love and can't wait to visit again just to get sushi here!"
/user_details?userid=qFqo9lQK8btWER-SF5YDrA,Pooja G.,"Schaumburg, IL",5 star rating,"If you're in Montreal, this place should not be missed! A vegan sushi place, can you imagine!! :)This place is always packed so make sure you have a reservation. Its a beautiful place, cozy atmosphere with lovely servers and their vegan sushi is to die for! Everything that we ordered there was freakn amazing! Usually, vegetarians have to stick to avocado and cucumber rolls at most sushi restaurants but this restaurant proves that vegans/vegetarians can also enjoy a wide variety of sushi. I would totally recommend trying this place out."
/user_details?userid=8HafK5cS8pWCWNQTIG8iJw,Uyen D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Disclaimer: this review is written through the lens of an omnivore. I've known about Sushi Momo for a few years now but have never tried it because honestly- how good can vegetarian sushi be?! In my skeptical mind I was picturing plain cucumber or tempura sweet potato rolls, in no way as tasty as a fresh, spicy salmon roll. I'm happy to say I was proven wrong. First off, thanks to Yelp I knew reservations were a must. In the span of 10 minutes I saw 2 walk-ins get turned away on a regular Wednesday evening. The restaurant has a serene, earthy feel to it- wood panels adorn the walls and potted plants hang from the ceiling. Most of the chairs are funky refurbished boat seats, which matched the portholes in the room. The layout is a bit odd- the place doesn't feel spacious because of the large enclosed sushi bar in the middle of the room. Our table was next to the sushi bar, in a narrow path near the back of the room. I admit I felt a bit claustrophobic, but the good food made up for it. The menu is ballsy, with tons of veggie/fruit combos I'd never heard of. The textures and sauces are the true stars here. Surprisingly, I never once missed the taste of fish, as I was so engulfed in Sushi Momo's innovative and complex flavours. I highly recommend this restaurant to adventurous eaters, vegan or not."
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",4 star rating,"I had friends coming into town for an indulgent Montreal weekend and wanted to book one night that would be fun and delish but still veggie and healthy. I hadn't been to the new location yet but I'd really enjoyed the original and loved the friendly joyful service and felt like I could trust them to pull off a fun group dinner. I was not wrong! For $30 each plus drinks we had a crazy epic feast. Started with salads and crispy rolls and fried wonton style dumplings, super flavourful and fun bites. The showstopper though was the massive sushi boat. Why is it on a boat? Why isn't all my food served in a boat? The group top favourite was the spicy jackfruit roll, and our least favourite were the ones with a pesto inside - the flavour combo freaked us out. There were so many to try from though, and so many left over, you couldn't be mad at having a few you didn't enjoy as much. Dessert was delicious as well and our bottles of wine were affordable and tasty. The big group table we were seated at in the back was great for getting a view of the whole spot, and still feeling kind of intimate with the group. It's a bit weirdly shaped though, I imagine the person sitting in the furtherest corner could feel a little left out. Not a big problem in our case as that guy in our group has a megaphone voice. Everyone I'd invited seemed happy, even though they'd started dubious, and the service was as warm and welcoming as I'd hoped. For vegetarians or pregnant people this place is a gift. We'll be back soon no doubt."

You should definitely make reservations!If you want fish, don't come to this place, but if you have an open mind, you should go!I didn't think vegetarian food could be so flavourful and have so much texture, but it did! I especially loved the beet tartare with the taro chips.Staff was lovely and friendly. The restaurant was warm and cozy, a very comfortable atmosphere."

Aaah well, ""vegan/vegetarians"" sushi experience. But it did! All credit goes to Sushi Momo vegetalien. I went there on a weekday lunch time. To my surprise it was pretty busy. It is a fancy fine dine. But every penny is worth it. The sushi's are so innovative, delicious and gorgeously plated! The server said "" They are made with love""  They have a platter , if you are in a group its worth trying. There are around 25 pieces in the platter with 5-6 varieties of shushi's. They offer Eddamme as welcome snacks. Equally yummy! They sushi's are sooo fresh, flavourful and full of beauty ( lol, can't remember any synonym with F).Simply 'F'antastic!"
/user_details?userid=EO49noCE6deJZXcf1Zrd0A,Chanhong L.,"Alexandria, VA",5 star rating,"The best vegan sushi in North America indeed-my boyfriend and I split the Ichiban for 1, and it was so worth it! We opted for the wakame (seaweed) salad as the appetizer, and it came with complimentary edamame, which quite frankly kind of confused me because I was pretty sure wakame meant seaweed, but then I was pleasantly surprised when a dish of five different kinds of seaweeds was subsequently presented. I was totally expecting the typical green seaweed served at sushi restaurants, but the four other seaweeds were all new to me and delicious with the presented garnishes and dipping sauce. Our main entree was five pieces of three different rolls chosen by the chef. At first I thought 15 pieces of sushi wouldn't be enough between the two of us, but it was the perfect amount of deliciousness and fullness. Because it's been so long and because the sushi menu is so extensive, I don't remember the exact rolls we got, but they were all delectable. I wish I could've tried them all and almost asked our neighboring table for leftovers of their huge order. Dessert was chocolate ice cream, which was actually my least favorite portion of the meal, but it was nice that it was included with the cost. We each ended up spending only around 17 USD for a high quality three-course meal. I'm so glad disappointment at another restaurant led me to making a reservation here, a must-stop for any visiting vegan."

I had reservations for 8:30pm on Thursday night and it was packed! Also I was surprised to see how many things there were on the menu! I would not expect a vegetarian sushi restaurant to have so many options. I read really good reviews for this place and two friends recommended it so I was excited to try it out even though I am not vegetarian. This restaurant totally met my expectations and I will definitely be back!My friend and I each had the omakase for 1($32). It came with free edamame . I enjoyed the spices that they put on the edamame. We each had a miso soup. We also added gyozas as an extra. The omakase came with 25 sushi pieces (chef's choice) and 1 dessert to share. The waiter brought us fried gyoza without asking us if we wanted fried or pan friend and was nice enough to change it for us. We had 5 sushi rolls. Each were so flavorful and I totally did not miss the seafood! My favorites were the following:3 champions: Three mushrooms (enoki, oyster, portobello), marinated Japanese radish, avocado, bubu arare, truffle oil & miso emuslsionJacque épicé - Pan-fried jackfruit, avocado, green onion, tempura, kimchi emulsion.Mangue patate (5)  - Soy paper, sweet potato, mango, cucumber, avocado, maple syrup, tempura flakes, green onion, yuzu emulsion.The dessert was a passion fruit tarte with walnuts. The crust was very hard to cut but the dessert was delicious!This restaurants closes at 10pm on Thursdays and we left at 11:30pm! They were putting the chairs up on the tables and didn't rush us out. Very nice! I can't wait to try other stuff on the menu!"

I have to say at first i was a bit skeptical especially since there was no way of seeing the menu anywhere. I am currently on a vegan based diet and wow am i grateful for that journey. Because of it i have discovered the best sushi i have ever had...would i have tried it if i wasn't eating vegan?!  not likely. To top it off i am celiac which further complicates things so my boyfriend took one for the team when we took the gf sharing menu but he didn't feel deprived at all. Everything was awesome, amazingly different and flavorful. Cannot wait to go back, actually i would have gone back today...A month later i had to get my fix and went back... again it was an amazing experience, will definitely be back again and drag my non vegan friends cause it's just that good!!!"

/user_details?userid=F7vcrApf-w_L4XquDBkDOQ,Jessica E.,"Albany, NY",5 star rating,"Second time dining at Sushi Momo and at this point I can't imagine visiting Montreal without stopping in. Apparently, everyone else agrees as the place was packed at 10 PM on a Thursday. Wait staff are all in good spirits notwithstanding and are happy to help you navigate the menu if you're not into gluten. They have a couple beers on tap an a nice selection of Sakis.On to the food: There are already so many pictures on yelp that you know their vegan sushi is edible art. For an appetizer this time my partner and I got the vegetable tempura, which was served like a bird's nest, with individually fried thin strips of vegetables amassed into a loosely packed ball the size of a softball. Totally wild and delicious. Red bell pepper was a nice addition to the mix of veggies that many japanese restaurants I've been too in NY don't usually include.For our entrees we ordered 4 rolls which arrived atop and below delicate swirls of sauces and carefully placed mircogreen leaves and edible flower petals. One with tempura shishitos and a spicy mayo, one with mango and sweet potato, another with a soy beef substitute seasoned like bulgogi, tomato, pear and a basil sauce, and the last with vegan shrimp, avocado, potato and a curry mayo. Everything was delicious and so creative and inspired. Still so many things to try, such as rolls featuring different kinds of mushrooms and marinated tofu, that I am already looking forward to returning!"

I was admittedly a bit skeptical of a vegan sushi place, but Sushi Momo really exceeded my expectations both in terms of food and in terms of service. We had made a reservation the day before though our table was a bit delayed so we weren't seated until some time after. The staff were super nice about it, though, and even provided us a complimentary sake drink while we waited! After we got seated, we ordered about six different rolls. All of the rolls were unique and very tasty. My favorites were the Geisha, Jacque Epice, and the 3 Champions. We also tried some dessert after; the dessert dish itself rotates day to day. We tried the strawberry and passionfruit variants of the dessert and both flavors were very flavorful but not overly sweet.Overall, we had a fantastic experience! I would definitely come back if visit Montreal again."

Not too heavy, not too light, plenty of food to go around with a large group. Those boats are ginormous and can accommodate 8-10 people easy. White wine by the bottle on a warm evening compliments the meal in the best way possible, too! Even if you can't have all the vices, one is still OK. Would I go back? Actually, yes I would.

My bf and I got: Mumbai, Geisha, Jacque Epice, 3 Champions, Sakura which came to about $56. 25 rolls for two people are enough. Although with $8 more you can order Omakase which comes with popular 25 rolls, miso soup, and papaya salad/Beet tartar and a dessert. Highly recommend this place!"
/user_details?userid=zND6dC2q-5-GxqK-Yl-wsw,Molly L.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"The portions and prices were horrible - $7 for two rolls was a particularly unfortunate point. The veggie tempura sushi (which I would never order at a non-vegan joint) was abysmal - spongy tempura, dry rice, completely lacking in  flavour. The other rolls tried to draw their inspiration from a variety of sources - Indian, Western, Mexican - but it was a classic case of being spread too thin; maple syrup and hibiscus in sushi is interesting, but the core components like the rice were neglected in the process. Overall, this definitely lived up (or down) to what I imagine happening when white hipsters try to make sushi. 1 extra star, though, for giving me the best poop I had in months."

We had the Omakase for 2.We told the waitress that I was allergic so several fruits, so if I'm writing this, it's because I'm still alive!They gave us edamame and miso soup to start off the night. Shortly after enjoying a nice hot soup with some nice edamame, we had a beet tartare - yes, BEET tartare. It was so good, I wish I had more! The main course consists of 25 pieces of maki's. I have to tell you guys: if you want to use soy sauce, use a tiny bit because the rolls are good as is!We finished the night with a nice jasmine ice cream.I can't believe this was all vegan, it was so good!The pictures will tell you everything."

Now that that's out of the way, you will need to believe me when I say this restaurant is exceptional. For one, the presentation of the dishes is beautiful. Luckily, it's also crazy delicious. The beet tartare made it to my top ten favourite dishes of all times... yes, it's that good. A must try. The papaya salad was also good, maybe not as zesty as others I have tried but that might be because I am used to the fish sauce kick. The sushi was amazing. Really nothing to envy to traditional sushi. The homemade ice creams were also surprisingly perfect.The chef that created these recipes is a talented artist. I have found that many vegan and vegetarian restaurants rely on sauces and ""mayo"" for flavour, which often ends up being good but very heavy. Not this chef. His sauces are wonderful but really he relies on the combination of ingredients to create those perfect bites. Make sure to reserve. The establishment is very busy and rightfully so."

I'm not a huge fan of sushi but my friends forced me to come with them and I seriously don't regret it AT ALL TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THIS PLACE HAS AMAZING FOOD  (even the edamames were good ???) we started off with the sweet potato pizza and Ohmygod I still remember the taste of it it was a perfect combo of sweet and spicy it was really good I wish I ordered it again. Next we ordered the L'Enfer 2.0 which is a spicy maki it tasted a bit like the pizza hence why I enjoyed it and then we got the GYU and Roru-rouge which are fried Maki and in my opinion they tasted the same but it was still good trust me. Then we went on to the sushi's and we shared the Surf and Turf, Patate-Jalapeño, Mumbai and spider which were all super tasty and my personal favourite was the jalapeño one (as you can tell I like the spicy ones ahah) my least favourite was the La Vie en Rose which my friends loved and it had a beautiful display but unfortunately it wasn't up to my taste. But overall my experience here was great the service was good the waitress was super friendly and she helped us with the ordering since it was our first time there I recommend anyone to visit this place if they're looking for a good sushi place :)"

We were seated a little towards the back at the perfect table tucked into a corner for a group of boisterous girls ;-)We were well taken care of by the charming Jonathan, who started us off with warm saki and then suggested the perfect wine and the Saiko Ko for Four from ""Les Deals"".  This four-course menu included a sumptuous miso soup to start, which the girls loved.  I subbed for a small salad instead and feel like I went to heaven when I tasted the ambrosia that was the dressing.  Then we had a yummy papaya salad & beetroot tartare and we also ordered some dumplings (Gyoza) all of which disappeared in a flash.  The portions were perfect for sharing and everything tasted even better than it looked.  When the sushi platter arrived with a selection of favorites from the chefs, Jonathan took the time to explain what each item was and then left us to dive in.  At this point I have to say that I'm a VERY picky eater and am not usually adventurous when it comes to food. I threw caution to the wind and tried almost everything - including the jackfruit. I can't even remember the names of anything, but suffice to say that I was more than satisfied as were the girls. The portion was just right, even leaving us with a little box of leftovers to take home.As a vegan, it can be difficult to find a restaurant that appeals to my non-vegan friends... so discovering Sushi Momo was the best birthday present ever!  Now that I've popped my sushi cherry, I will definitely be back and would highly recommend this oasis of deliciousness to vegans & non-vegans alike."

We went in around 4:30 without a reservation, and they seated us without a question (this place usually needs a reservation because it's so busy). Our waitress was a sweetheart and she made sure that everything was to our tastes and checked in with us periodically. One of the people in my group has a mushroom allergy, and our waitress made sure she was accommodated and gave her alternative dishesFOODThe food was absolutely delicious. We ordered the saiko ko for four, which included miso soup, two appetizers, 50 pieces of sushi, and dessert for about $30/person. It doesn't sound like that much, but when it all came on the table, it was So Much food (There was even more sushi than the pictures I've attached). We had a beet tartare for one of the appetizers, and it was absolutely delicious. The sushi was also amazing and every different roll had a unique taste that I've never had before.10/10 would recommend and a restaurant you should definitely try if you are in Montreal!!"

If you're more than 2 and just want to walk-in, you are likely going to be waiting a while. Not recommended.The atmosphere at this restaurant is wonderfully cozy/casual. The cooks are in the middle so you can watch your sushi rolls being made while you wait. It does, however, get extremely busy and somewhat loud. I went with 2 girlfriends on a reservation we made way in advance and had gotten there more or less on time. We ordered the tasting menu (miso soup each + edamame to share, 2 choices of apps, 36 pieces of sushi and dessert to share for $32/ea) and LOVED our food experience - Definitely worth the cost. The appetizers we had were the miso soup (so wonderfully earthy), the edamame, the papaya salad (fresh and tangy) and the gyozas (seriously satisfying). I truly wish I remembered the names of the rolls we had but sadly, I'm not that good... I do remember some favourite flavours were the mushroom, the incredible one with faux shrimp, a super earthy and mouth savory beet one and I believe was the faux beef fried roll (Koby Roll). Lastly the dessert, OMG the dessert! Creamy delicious pieces of cake to share: Matcha, Lemon and Chocolate on a crunchy gram cracker like crust. Make sure there is a little room for dessert for sure! What killed all this goodness to me was our waiter. We walked in, sat down and he more or less told us order the tasting menu or else we don't have time to wait for you to decide on your order. We felt rushed and pressured by him within seconds of sitting down to a nice girls night out. It just set the night on a negative start.  We then proceeded to have a wonderful dinner and which ended by us being more or less rushed to pay our bills and leave our table ASAP as according to him we were holding up the table. I understand they are busy but rudeness isn't acceptable. I'm hoping if I go back, I never run into him again. I'm usually a generous tipper but he made is VERY difficult for me to feel he deserved anything."

The assortment of sushi is really incredible, every piece is like a flavor explosion. Not only great food, but a fun place to go with friends. It's an experience for sure. We make sure to stop by each time we're in town."
/user_details?userid=VZtaiqj40IF36qs2JnQaeg,Marisa K.,"Kansas City, MO",5 star rating,"This place is OUTSTANDING. Montreal is such a vegan-friendly city. I was so happy to hear about Sushi Momo, and I knew I'd have to try it on vacation. I brought my omnivore boyfriend and he loved it all too! Seriously, this place is a must-try. We got six different types of sushi total. I can't remember which ones, but honestly they were all delicious. I wish they had a restaurant like this where I live!"
/user_details?userid=Yj6gAP6HTKaFks9EyDLm2Q,Mark B.,"Oakland, CA",5 star rating,"***MAKE A RESERVATION WELL IN ADVANCE***This place is extremely popular, we got turned away on our first attempt because we didn't have a reservation, but made one there on the spot for the following evening. Asked out of curiosity how the rest of the week looked, they were booked solid, so we got lucky that we were able to get in during out Montreal visit.Okay, enough with the cautionary tale...Two words, GOD DAMN. I kept saying those words, again and again after each bite. Their rolls are SO delicious.Go with the ""Omakasé For Two"" (or any of the other ""deals"" where they pick the sushi for you). Suggesting this because they pick drastically different rolls, so you get a chance to really taste their creative spectrum in its entirety.Kind of wild, but I was really impressed with the miso soup. Normally this is a boring preliminary dish that I enjoy, but there's nothing special. Not the case at Sushi Momo, their miso was so damn good.For anyone wondering how this place stacks up against other well known vegan sushi restaurants, I'd be willing to go as far as saying Sushi Momo is better and more creative than our local gem, and vegan sushi tourist destination, Shizen."
/user_details?userid=fu9kPR6VmQDwTh0f3i_OFQ,Sylvie L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Extremely tasty non-Japanese makis !!! Don't think you are going to eat Japanese, because you are at the wrong place. Japanese sushis/makis aims for simplicity and the tasting of a almost-single fresh ingredient. Sushi Momo is using makis as a blank canvas to compose surprising associations of many flavors, textures and colors, all fresh and vegan ! Every bite was an experience ! Bravo to the chef ! Nice thing is that they have a set menu to share for 2-4-5 people for 30$/person; you will get to taste a variety of things, they change the menu quite often. Very good food at a very good price. I recommend to everyone : vegan, vegetarian, carnivores, omnivores, etc !"

The staff is nice and they also speak English for those who don't speak French. My hostess carefully explained everything on the menu and recommend some great rolls. I had the Mumbai Roll and the Surf & Turf. The later was my favorite out of the two as it had vegan bacon and was very delicious! I can't wait to come back and try more rolls. I've got my eye on a Jackfruit roll next!

/user_details?userid=PK3EmRHbtPxxuJuEyHnI5A,Nica D.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"My first time visiting a vegan sushi place and we ordered the Omakase. Started off with edamame which seemed complimentary, a delicious and creamy miso soup, and then papaya salad which was so tasty (and not spicy like traditional Thai ones) and had the chef's selection of 25 rolls. I also ordered the kobe roll as people recommended it, so far I would say that was my least favourite as it was more of a salad roll and quite expensive at $14. I think we had 5 rolls each of the Mangue Patate, Three Champions, Mumbai, another one with mushrooms and another with asparagus. For some reason we shared a creme bruele for dessert instead of icecream but that was fine. We left totally stuffed. I liked that the menu had enough that you could visit a few times before trying everything. I would like to try the blow torched sushi next time."
/user_details?userid=jn6THmhWapW7OiCJWOlNGw,Caitlin A.,"Los Angeles, CA",3 star rating,"The food is spicy. it's not the traditional sushi you get in Japan of course. It's a fun fatter junkier version which is great for a craving. The male server kept pushing us to order more even though we told him we were full- so that's a bit inappropriate and awkward. He also said we cannot order later as reservations are for a limited time. Secondly, be careful if you are allergic to something in the menu. The kitchen may still forget to remove it even if you request. This has happened many times before."

What a great presentation for ever meal that was brought out! (Even if you aren't vegan, you certainly won't be disappointed! I found that it was a very convenient location, easy parking and short walk. I recommend a making reservation! Very easy, you can do so by going right on their website.
