/user_details?userid=U1vl4SQzO3wTAWlYVnSjnw,Justine S.,"Outremont, Canada",4 star rating,"Came here for brunch with some friends for the first time and wasn't disappointed. Surprisingly not too crowded on a saturday morning, even though we had to wait for a 4 people table. But if you're 2, seating is super quick. I did remove one star because the meals don't include mini breakfast potatoes and that's what makes a brunch for me. Also their hash browns are good but they aren't traditional. I ordered the egg and sausage sandwich and it was devine. I would absolutely recommend. Also the scones, they are so buttery!"

I had been here for drinks and dessert, but now I tried their brunch. My friend and I shared the egg, tuna and corn salsa plate as well as the egg and corn bread plate. Both tasted good, but nothing exceptional. Staff was very friendly and the decor was definitely Instagram worthy. However, what I look for is flavour in food!"

/user_details?userid=Pm4mT5MZAbDOMxgLD8JW3w,Wei L.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"First time to explore brunch in mile end area. The store is not big so probably it would be better if you can reservation in advance. We started with scone with jam and cream...I have to say this is the best scone I've had in Montreal. It even beats the one in the afternoon tea. Besides, I ordered the delicious English breakfast. The only part I don't like is the sausage. It lack the tenderness for some reasons. My frd got the delivered liver with salads. You will like it if you don't mind eating liver. That's not my dish while my frd likes it. In one word, it is a good place for friends gathering."
/user_details?userid=sGJvx1MTsetDzsnrHfJHLg,Aaron E.,"Orange County, CA",5 star rating,"Looking for a Newport Beach, California kind of casual featuring a decidedly upscale and contemporary​ menu while in Montreal? Lawrence puts it all together effortlessly​. Just walking into Lawrence's tragically​ cool interior makes one excited about their next meal. The focal point​ is a dazzling​ round bar in the middle of a wide-open​ square glass room on the corner of St-Laurent and Fairmount in the Mile End District of Montreal. British-native Marc Cohen is producing​ a form​ of cuisine based directly​ on one thing here: Food he is interested in eating. The service is as sharp as a tactical knife and as freindly as a well-worn​ lounge chair after a long day of business. You will want for nothing. Start with the Beef Tartare; It is perhaps the best you will find anywhere thanks to the fact that this restaurant is backed by their own butcher (you will see the meat coming and going from outside throughout your meal at lunchtime). As if the supreme quality of Beef wasn't enough they throw a farm fresh Egg over it - just because. Crack the yolk and swirl it around on the surface a bit and then load it onto the supplied fresh toasted Bread and tell me this isn't absolutely sublime. Another total triumph​ is the Culatello et Cantaloupe which is as decadent as it sounds. What is Culatello? Glad you asked. Culatello is one of the most prized salumi in Italy and Lawrence dresses it simply with Rock Salt and gently drapes it over the ripest Cantaloupe I have had in recent memory. It is a magical little number I simply must learn to recreate at home. How to follow all of this up? Naturally, with a Burger. Right?Stop laughing, Lawrence puts on an explosive Burger. I already told you they butcher their own meat and the kitchen doesn't let the Beef down by not knowing what medium rare is. The patty tastes like liquid Burger in solid form if that makes any sense. Hell, just try it. The usual suspects come stock (Tomato & Lettuce) and its delivery mechanism is a Poppy Seed Roll which is marvelous but at the same time a bit ""bread-y"". Oh, don't worry about adding Cheese because​ it will already be on there. Lawrence hit all the right buttons at the prescribed intervals for me and is unquestionably a must stop if you find yourself in Mile End Montreal. I bet you will feel the same."

Sensational food that surprises and delights without being overcomplicated or pretentious, friendly and knowledgeable service, and a calm atmosphere that makes it comfortable to sit back and appreciate the flavour and company. We've eaten at hundreds of restaurants and Lawrence still stands out."
/user_details?userid=KRGbR3MMNj1GTkd6SN_PwQ,Kendra F.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"When you walk in you are drawn to the semi circle bar that awaits your taste buds with a well knowledgeable bartender/waitstaff who will likely have to shift a few things around to squeeze you in (I recommend a reservation) And you can tell there are some important people who come here.  The food is delicate delicious and decidedly decadent without being too much.  This is a classic French style dining establishment. The wine.....  even the ones by the glass offer the quality that you seek without an obscenely high price tag.  Over all, it isn't cheap but this spot is an excellent place for both a celebration and night cap."
/user_details?userid=oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,Rod U.,"Pearl City, HI",4 star rating,"Creamy, buttery, soft scrambled eggs, Canadian cold smoked salmon, stewed kidneys, house cured cullatello, freshly baked scones, we're talking brunch in Montreal!Incredibly warm, bright, welcoming interior dominated by an semi circular open bar.  Casual vibe.It's French with a nod to Quebec's ingredients, and it's good.To begin, one heck of a great scone.  Freshly baked, loaded with blueberries.  Not bready rather a plethora of flakey, gently sweetened layers.   Smear some clotted cream on a bite for good measure.  Done.Saumon fumé et oeufs brouillés (smoked salmon and scrambled eggs),  excellent.  Cold smoked, lightly salty, fatty salmon; silky smooth mouth feel, meltingly tender, with the hint of sweet, not astringent smoke with European style scrambled eggs.  Rich, loaded with butter, interspersed with chives; creamy and runny atop grilled, crusty bread.  Simple and hearty.Rognons à la diable sur pain grillé (deviled kidneys on toast), equally good.  Well braised.  Soft and tender with the texture of sweetbreads.  Hint of metallic organ flavor tempered by butter, pork fat and onions.  What's not to love?Finally, do not pass on the culatello or any other salumi.  All made at the restaurant's butcher shop.  Obvious use of heritage breeds of pig, the end result is outstanding texture and well integrated fat with excellent ""porky"" flavor and gentle umami.  Cocktail centric with a small selection of wine (mostly French) and locally produced beer.Very friendly, welcoming, and casual service.I don't take brunch often, but when I do, I expect exactly this.  Worth waking up for."
/user_details?userid=U28XN1IGtjsQL2DUxr7FKg,Be F.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"Magnificent baked eggs and French-style scrambled with smoked salmon, and the coffee is good. But the scone is not to be missed - perfect scone dough baked croissant-style and served with clotted cream and jam. Absolutely worth the calories. They deserve so much respect for serving ingredients that respect both animals and the environment! Plus their fish and shellfish is caught or farmed sustainably. We had an incredible meal. Superb service, nice decor, and though it was busy it wasn't overrun with a long and annoying lineup, even on a holiday Sunday afternoon."
/user_details?userid=HhRcq4INJlID3helYAcLug,Melissa H.,"Fremont, CA",5 star rating,"I came to Lawrence for lunch towards the beginning of my trip & spent the remainder of it wanting to go back! The menu is pretty sparse & definitely focuses on quality of ingredients, especially since they have a butchery just down the street. We ended up ordering 2 types of tartare, raw oysters, and a pasta to round it out. Highlights: - Raw lamb tartare: we got this on the recommendation of our server & it was incredible! I feel like it's pretty rare to see raw lamb (as opposed to raw beef/seafood) but it really wasn't gamey at all and was incredibly fresh. - Blue cheese & mushroom bucatini pasta: you can definitely tell that they use fresh pasta b/c the texture was so nice! It was so chewy & absorbed so much of the delicious blue cheese flavor. There weren't too many mushrooms in it though. Decor inside is also super nice: kind of like a modernized diner. B/c it's springtime, there were some amazing spring bouquets of flowers inside! I'll definitely be back for brunch or dinner next time!"
/user_details?userid=EG5RpUIxj7PmBvJyK2dElA,John J.,"San Antonio, TX",4 star rating,Came here for brunch on a cold morning. There was a bit of a wait but they have a texting service to let you know when your table is ready which is nice. We went and got some coffee up the street until our table was ready. The inside is nicely decorated. The tables are relatively close together which can be tight for large groups. The service was prompt and friendly. Their signature drinks are mixed well and very tasty. I ordered the English breakfast. It was delicious and is delivered as advertised. The food was cooked perfectly. One of my friends ordered the French toast and it looked delicious as well.

/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Very good brunch place with a menu different from the other places. We had the fish and the sausage and they were both accompanied with a nice sauce and some side veggies. The wait time during the weekend is a bit long so make sure you arrive early.

There are 3 of them per plate (custard, chocolate or lemon). You can choose to have 3 of the same flavour too. Too bad, they dont let me take other combinations of flavours :(It gets crowded very early, so if you want yo avoid the line up, get there by 10h30! Parking around that area could be difficult, unless you don't mind paying...Honestly, everything on their brunch menu is amazing! And not to forget their excellent latte!"
/user_details?userid=-pG4fm6eWoGLP6fIsFBvzw,Teri Y.,"Chicago, IL",5 star rating,"I woke up this morning and still could not stop thinking about dinner last night at Lawrence. It was outstanding through and through.The complimentary amuse bouche (cured mackerel) was such a great teaser on what was to come. It was just pure thinly sliced delicate pieces of cured mackerel and baby green tomatoes drizzled with olive oil. Nothing else needed to distract from the natural and pure flavors of the mackerel. The sea urchin macaroni was fantastic without a hint heaviness. The sautéed kale with andouille sausage, oh my. The raw albacore was fresh and a nice balance to round out the ""starters"" part of the meal.The tagliatelle was perfectly al dente and well flavored with the clams and bits of sausages. Halibut texture was perfect---I'm usually not a fan of dense textured fish like cod and halibut, and prefer flaky textured fish like branzino and whitefish. However, Lawrence changed my mind about halibut. The texture was very tender. And what an ingenious way to prepare the artichokes! We were told by our server that the skin is removed and deep fried, while the inner part of the artichoke is cooked separately. After that, the fried skin is then used to wrap around the cooked inner part.We made reservations to sit at the counter-- the best to dine!"

The location itself is so pretty, cozy and inviting and the staff is so friendly and attentive which is always a plus.  The brunch menu isnt huge but both dishes we tried were outstanding and the pricing was very reasonable (I thought it would be more expensive than it was). Their coffee was really a standout , I had their cappucino which was so delicous and silky smooth , you can taste the quality of the coffee.  We had the smoked salmon and scrambled eggs on toast which was very well prepared , the smoked salmon portion was  generous and tasted very fresh, the bread was excellent and the scrambled eggs were creamy and well seasoned. I highly recommend this dish. We also had the english breakfast, which has sausage that I believe is house made, thick cut tasty bacon , eggs , hearty slice of toast, potato and roasted mushroom and tomato , all of which was so full of flavour and cooked to perfection, this dish will not leave you hungry ! Great place for a brunch date or to hangout with friends. I absolutely loved this place and plan to go back again and again for brunch - Great choice for it in the plateau !"

I got the beef tartare and the sourdough to share. Now let me tell you a story about a girl who really enjoyed her steak tartare. It was mouthwatering good. It was a pretty good portioned size of tartare as well. Make sure to eat up the bread quickly cause eating cold bread isn't that great. I'll be back for actual brunch since I only came for lunch."
/user_details?userid=4xyYBC5MIe-GfDj6kAdAFw,Ivan H.,"Markham, Canada",4 star rating,"Location/ServiceAnother recommended restaurant in Montreal. The restaurant is located on a corner lot - the name/sign is at the bottom, so you gotta look carefully. Parking is available on the street and around.Inside decor is very plain and simple, but gives off a very nice groove and ambiance - especially for lunch. Service is also nice, staff were friendly and quick with our orders.FoodCame here for brunch, so ordered a few items to share.Appetizer - donuts! Chocolate, custard and lemon. Outside is fried and inside is soft filled with each individual flavor. I really liked the custard, lemon is sour as expected and chocolate is chocolate. This was a nice starter to open the palette.Mains - English breakfast - featuring a sausage, sunny side egg, beans, bacon and toast. Can't go wrong with this dish. Everything was done to the right level, very comforting - and I like the toast and potatoes on the side.Smoked salmon and scrambled eggs - eggs were nicely done, very fluffy, a little bit creamy to taste. Salmon was also great, complimenting well with the egg - and combining it together with a toast gives a really healthy and light meal to it.Buckwheat pancake - with cretons, fried eggs and apples. Apples were caramelized, giving off a very sweet savory flavor, substituting it well with butter/maple syrup. The pancake is different from the usual ones, not fluffy and soft cause of the buckwheat, but it's very light to taste and it mixed very well with the cretons, which was like a pork spread with onions and spices.Overall it was very nice place to come here for lunch, price wise is a little high for me - since the menu items does not seem too overly astonishing for me. But really liked the vibe and the environment."

/user_details?userid=xJpvRrk04rb4rgWtMXaPUQ,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"I know Lawrence is known for their brunch, but we came here for dinner and couldn't be happier. It was our first group meal in Montreal, and we really went all out.Lawrence does not play around when it comes to their menu. They had just about everything you could ever want. We got oysters from Massachusetts, a fish and pickled vegetable plate, charcuterie, and two of the greatest entrees I've ever had.Let's back up for a moment. Lawrence also has a butcher down the block, where they can get super fresh produce and meat. That alone should inform you of the quality of food here.For our mains, we shared beef neck and lamb shoulder. This was for 7 people, and we still couldn't finish. It was THAT much food. Just look at the photos I uploaded.The beef neck fell off the bone and has this wonderful meaty sauce. It also came with a side of roasted/fried cauliflower, which was amazing. Seriously the best cauliflower I've ever had. We saw our waitress actually leave the restaurant to go pick up a fresh head of cauliflower. Joked about it with her.The lamb shoulder was a gigantic hunk of meat served in a Dutch oven. SO MUCH FOOD. Served in a broth with a ton of vegetables. So incredibly tender.Also had a few cocktails, while others had wine or whiskey. Lots of options here. It was super laid back, and all of the waitresses were super friendly and put up with our manly hijinks.The bathroom also has the coolest wallpaper ever.Can't recommend Lawrence enough!"

I love curry, so I ordered the kedgeree - it is a decent-portioned, richly flavoured curry rice with chunks of soft boiled egg, fish, and cherry tomatoes. This thoughtful combination worked like a charm.My friend who started off with their infamous scone swore it was the best she ever had. Others at my table ordered the French toast, and scrambled eggs with charred salmon. We all enjoyed our food, will definitely visit again!"

We did not have a reservation, but were able to get a table in about 20 minutes. (In the meantime, you can walk around the Mile End area while you wait for your table, and there is an amazing boulangerie named Guillaume where we bought amazing bread.)After reading the blogs, this place did not disappoint. It has a very adventurous vibe to some of the food, though the menu is not very large. It's heavy on odd foods, such as lumpfish caviar, pig's head, pickled herring. Literally everyone seemed to be getting the cheeseburger, so I just had to join the bandwagon order one as well. It was delicious, though the potato wedge fries look better than they tasted. The beef tartare was also delicious, though I have had better. My partner opted for one of the specials, a pasta that was pretty good.Overall, we enjoyed Lawrence.  It was very quaint, and was packed with locals, which is always a good sign."

I brought the fam here on a nice saturday so we could hang out in town and wander round. We started off with eggs, toast and other brunch like items. My daughter had a hot chocolate. My wife mentioned it was one of the tastiest she had tried. I had ordered a cappuccino. Again on point strength wise and coffe art. My brunch consisted of the full English. Local sausage, bacon, potatoes, fried egg over potatoes. Solid, filling and better than expected. Come early as it's a popular place. Food fantastic. Vibe just as good."

This restaurant definitely exceeded my expectations. The place has a very rustic cozy feel and my group of 6 was seated in the back corner by the window.Our waiter was really helpful, attentive, and nice. Apps were in the CA$10 range and entrees in the CA$18 range. I ordered the beef tartare to share with my friend and the pork confit. The beef was a little under-seasoned for my taste. But it was very good and didn't have that raw meat taste. And as someone who loves to order pork confit whenever I see it on the menu, meaning that I have probably had a version of this in a hundred different ways, this pork was cooked really really well. Not sure if I loved the salty pickles and lentils taste with it, but the pork was amazing. The table shared the butter cake and it was an amazing dessert.Definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Montreal! I wish I could have been in town for the brunch menu."
/user_details?userid=2eN4NRcL3b3mTqGktCpysg,J. Karim A.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,Having read good things online about Lawrence's brunch we came by. Unfortunately it was raining and packed. We were told 30mins. So we decided to walk around while we waited and check out nearby stores. Our wait ended up being about an hour. Staff was friendly but the food wasn't good enough to warrant such a wait. The beignets were good though. I had a egg dish with chanterelles over soda bread. Nothing special and the soda bread wasn't a good match. I'd say find a place that will take a reservation and not wait. Not worth it here.

/user_details?userid=sbWWWi3JRE7s-OPUzGmCYA,C S.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"This may have been my favorite restaurant on this trip to Montreal. And we ate a LOT in our four days. I bookmarked this pretty late when I was looking for breakfast options towards the end of our stay. Lawrence comes up as one of the best Breakfast/Brunch places. In total vacation mode, I forgot it wasn't a weekend, and ended up at Lawrence for a late lunch on a Wednesday. Honestly... wow. Their lunch was SO good. We had the raw beef (enter mind blown emoji) and their schnitzel (crying face, so good). I mean... did I already say wow? The raw beef was... so nice. How do I explain - it was light, and bright, and just lovely. The schnitzel was done perfectly. It's not easy to do a good schnitzel. You have to pound the meat right to get the right tenderness, the breading needs to be done right, and you have to get the pan to that perfect temperature to sear it to get that perfect crunch and texture. They did a great job.Our waitress was sweet - informative, gave great opinions, but did not push anything on us. The first two dishes were so good we decided to go for a third, but she sweetly suggested we go for dessert (speaking my language), so we went with the rice pudding upon her recommendation. Another wonderful choice.I learned a few things sitting at the bar - they are popular for the breakfast/brunch, but the owners also own a meat shop a couple doors down, which explains why the raw beef and schnitzel were out of this world. I was so in love with the food I asked to see the dinner menu -  and I definitely want to go back for dinner. The menu looks bomb. Their bar is also stacked with great selections of beer and spirits -- the reasons to come back are endless."

Food was a little hit or miss, and I think if I went back I may be a bit more adventurous with the protein options. Scone was fantastic. English Breakfast was very good, especially the sausage and bacon. The Kedgeree was the least impressive, it seemed like it had some potential with some interesting flavors (though subtle), but was too dry. Would definitely come back to try some other dishes."
/user_details?userid=V0NyT2fKIs7pwFDSGqyCKQ,H L.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"This place is a tight squeeze from the moment you walk in the door. For weekend brunch, there is always, always a wait (on a recent visit, it was 40 mins), and the tables are packed in closely together. Be prepared to hear your neighbours' conversations and vice versa. Decor-wise, it's a nice, bright, well-maintained room. The host and wait staff are friendly. Dishes come out a bit randomly from the kitchen and they sorta plop things down in the middle of the table, making assumptions about what is going to be shared. It can be a bit awkward. The person who takes the order is not necessarily the person who brings your food, and so the experience can end up being disjointed. The people are nice though, so no complaints about the attitude or vibe of the service. And the food arrives promptly. The food itself is usually tasty (the doughnuts especially, and the sausage roll). I tried the soft scrambled eggs and smoked salmon...I dig a soft scramble but this was borderline liquid. Dunno, the texture was off-putting, but the flavours were good.  No one changed the cutlery after the doughnuts, so I was eating these oddly textured eggs with a chocolate-covered fork and the experience was icking me out a bit. A minor deal, but still, all the details add up to an overall experience that is a bit lacking. I'm not sure that any of it matters, however--they have lineups out the door. It's the type of place where most people probably need to order two dishes to leave satisfied, so, with a coffee, tip, etc, it's a $30 breakfast. Is that a good deal these days? Maybe for some. All in all, I'd say that Lawrence is good. But it's definitely not great."

The day we went they had a corn soup with clams and other lovely bits that was rich and yummy.  Highly recommended.  We followed that up with the pork tongue, which everyone should try.  Actually I suggest that they not tell anyone what it is so that people not familiar with tongue can enjoy it first and then find out that this forgotten part of the animal is so good.  Tender, flavorful and served with wilted sorrel.  A true delight and something I want to have again.  And finally we ended up with the mackerel.  Which was nicely cooked and had a great flavor.  It was served with Kolrahbi, which I've usually had as a puree, so nice pieces that were cooked properly was something new which I enjoyed.  All in all dinner was yummy, satisfying and fun.  But of course by the time you go, the menu will probably be different but if you have only come from Brunch, please come for dinner.  You'll be happy."
/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"If Lawrence were to be described in one word, it would be nostalgic. The simple layout that lodges itself right on the border of chic and homey creates a vibe that just makes you want to slow down and enjoy your surroundings and the company of people around you. Coupled with food that is light and carefree but with substance at the same time, Lawrence is a winning combination.Upon entering the packed place, I was actually seated at the bar quite quickly to my surprise. After scanning the menu, I opted to order a scrambled eggs with smoked salmon and a cappuccino for my drink. The cappuccino was divine and possibly one of the best I've ever had; it was so smooth and warm and went down my throat with utmost ease. The scrambled eggs came served on a bed of toast with the smoked salmon on the side. Although I was a bit skeptical of how runny they were, being used to having my eggs at least somewhat cooked, they were perfectly seasoned and soaked the bread with their peppery goodness, and the melange of flavors I experienced when pairing everything with the salmon was unbelievably good.Still having room in my stomach, I then ordered the mini donuts, which came with one of each filling - chocolate, lemon curd, and custard. They arrived in their simplistic beauty, just dusted in powdered sugar like it's no big deal, and trust me, they do not skimp on the filling. My favorite one was probably the lemon curd - it was not too sweet and was just right in terms of tartness and citrus flavor. The custard donut was pure in every way possible, and the chocolate one was chock-full of runny, liquid-y cacao - it did burst and cause a mess on one of my hands though.Overall, I would say that Lawrence is a wonderful place to go to for brunch, and I also checked out their lunch and dinner menus; they both looked amazing and innovative as well. I'll be sure to come back during those times to check out their other menu items!"

Coffee is served with beautiful raw sugar cubes and latte art; water is served from hip, reused milk jugs.We got the donuts to start followed by the pig head and curried rice dish. All three items were too die for: the three donut holes each had a decadent filling and were surprisingly satiating, the pig head came on top of collard greens with a side of hearty bread, and the curried rice came with sweet cherry tomatoes and poached eggs on top.In short, if you're in Montreal, you have to come here."

It's situated on the corner, a cozy space with large windows, letting in lots of natural light. The place is simplistic in decor, using neutrals, white and black chairs, and a grey and white plaid pattern for their banquette seats. Arriving around 1pm on a Tuesday afternoon, there was a short wait for a table. While waiting, I observed the attention to details as the servers were setting up the other tables. Even when rearranging smaller tables to create a larger one, they made sure that white chairs were on one side, and black chairs on the other. As I sat down, I was then immediately greeted by my server. The menu had a good selection of small plates, as well as some larger ones. I decided on a steak tartare and an arctic char and brussel sprouts with almonds. The tartare was delicious, freshly chopped, and a perfect amount of salt and seasoning. One of the best I've had. The arctic char plate was a light salad, with cut brussel sprouts and slivers of almonds adding some texture to the plate.I like Lawrence for its simplicity of their food. The service is excellent; I never felt rushed to finish my meal. The space is a great spot to relax and enjoy a meal."

/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Location: On the main, corner Maguire. Street parking is available [metered] and the closest subway is likely Laurier. It'll be a 10-minute walk from there. The place: Not huge, but very cozy and bright. It kind of feels like walking into someone's loft apartment - if I lived close by, I'd probably want to hang out here all the time. The goods: I ordered the baked eggs with mushrooms and celeriac, along with a side of bacon. First of all, BACON. Crispy. Yum. Need more. Secondly, the celeriac/egg/mushroom combo was served piping hot with the egg yolks on top - so you get to mash that sh*t up all by yourself just like when you were five, all the while attempting not to drool in your plate. Personally, I loved this dish but be warned - it does fill you up. It was incredibly flavourful and the mushroom chunks were quite large. The home-made bread is to die for, especially with that melted butter. God help me. Side note: if you like your bacon crispy, let them know. Also, they make the bacon themselves, as well as their sausages. My two lady friends both ordered the English breakfast and I'm going to assume they enjoyed it because there was nothing left on their plates, when everything was said and done. I think I saw one of my friends licking her plate when she thought no one was looking. So busted. Service: Great! Our waitress was super friendly and patiently answered all of our questions (OK, she patiently answered one person's questions and that person wasn't me). Price point: I would say it's on par with most breakfast places. For the portion size and quality of the ingredients, I think you get your money's worth. Note: I don't think they take reservations for weekend brunch unless you're six or more. When you show up, they'll take your name and number, and call you when a table opens up. It's a very efficient system!"

Talk about excellent service!The decor is very casual but very inviting with wooden tables, art-deco chairs and staff in jeans and black t-shirts. The menu is simple yet varied in their choices of more unfamiliar cuts of meat (think pigs ear, oxtail, pigs feet). So many original dishes I wanted to try but with the help of the waitress, we finally settled on the seaweed ravioli, octopus with merguez sausages and braised oxtail. All dishes were delicious, however the oxtail really stood out for us and made us utterly speechless as we devoured the oh-so tender meat and the heaven sent buttery polenta. It was such a mouth watering dish that I'm still drooling as I write this!Dessert was also very good, we had the caramel and fleur-de-sel tarte. I could really taste both flavors and they we're balanced to perfection!The bill was also a nice surprise as it came out to under 150 after tax with 4 glasses of wine.We will definitely return as this place has become a new favorite of ours!"

When my parents came to town for a visit, I decided that it would be the perfect opportunity to try Sunday brunch at Lawrence. My initial excitement was dampened a little when we arrived and the hostess said we would have to wait for 45 minutes. We decided to tough it out and walk around the area until we got our table. In the end, we only had to wait 15 minutes. As per former Yelp reviews, we started off with scones and donuts. The scones had blackcurrants with cream, jam and butter on the side. It was quite good but I do agree with another reviewer who said the scone should have been served warm. The donuts were quite tasty - Lemon, vanilla and chocolate. To eat we ordered three different dishes: 1. Pig's trotter with soft boiled eggs, anchovy and root veggies (parsnips, carrots, potatoes) - Amazing flavours in this one. The pig's trotter was tender, fatty and flavourful with a good mix of root veggies. I can also really appreciate a properly cooked soft-boiled egg. 2. Scrapple with eggs and bacon - From the waitress' description, we expected the scrapple to have a little but more meat. It seemed more like a fried square of cornmeal and aside from the desirable crispiness, the inside wasn't that great. The sunnyside eggs were perfect and the bacon was well-cooked. 3. Kedgeree - The curry rice was mixed with flaked haddock and soft-boiled eggs. The dish was incredibly complex in flavour - Fragrant, a little spicy with an unexpected sour taste at the end. All in all, the flavour combinations for brunch are very unique and worth a shot for sure. I'd recommend going right at 10 to avoid waiting for a table. Next time I'd probably go for the apple cinnamon french toast (looked unreal at the next table) and the deviled kidneys. Enjoy!"

Sometimes going to a restaurant alone can feel daunting, but, the atmosphere was easy going/not pretentious, the staff had a welcoming and genuine nature, and the food was delicious. The entire experience felt welcoming, and I loved that I could enjoy a -perfect- latte while I waited, which made the experience all the better. Because I didn't see veg-friendly breakfast options other than a scone or French Toast, I ordered the French toast and it was delightful! It was topped with fresh tangy-sweet cranberries/sauce, crisp apples, and perfectly textured whipped cream. On ordering, I was wondering if it might be too sweet, but, it was perfectly balanced. While I didn't ask if any of the dishes could be made vegetarian, I do think it would be great to see more veg-friendly options or substitutions on the menu beyond french toast or a scone.Would love to return, again, and plan to exactly that before going back to SF!"

Four of us got the English breakfast which is their most popular option I believe. Great sausage, bread, and potatoes and cabbage. The kedgeree was great. Not exactly something I would want for breakfast in the future, it felt more like a lunch or dinner meal, but I really enjoyed it and am glad i had it. The sausage sandwich was top notch as well.

First, I love a place that can do a good brunch cocktail beyond the standard mimosa and bloody mary (or rather, the related Caesar if you're in Canada). Their aperol spritz was simple, refreshing, and just what I was looking for. DONUTS! Get the donuts!! We got an assortment of three (lemon was my favorite) and they were just amazing. Then.... THE EGG BAKE. Celery root, oyster mushrooms, cheese, and eggs. Dear. God. It was such a stellar combination, and quite different from any brunch dish I've had. I would go back in a heartbeat for this. Oh, and the incredible (sourdough?) bread that it came with.And I almost forgot about the scones! Moist. With delicious jam and clotted cream.The only almost-downside of the day was a bit of 'tude from the guy who seated us. ""How many?""""Three? Or maybe four.""""Hrmf. We have no space for maybes."" ....though the only table open was a 4-seater anyway, so it all worked out fine."

Not only is the food delicious, inventive and conceptually interesting (there's something I never thought I'd say until I was served pig's ear), on two separate instances, I've had unforgettably phenomenal service here.(Rest assured the service was still good the other times)Lawrence clearly take their food seriously, and their devotion to using fresh produce, sourcing ethically and sustainably, and not wasting offal, are evident. Thankfully, they are not in the least preachy about any of these things, and you won't be subjected to a side order of self-congratulation if all you care about is a good meal. Their ever evolving menu is posted daily to their Twitter account.As far as brunch goes, expect variety, freshness, and a few things you may not have heard of before. Everything will be explained in as much detail as you would like. The space (literally) shines in the earlier hours, with large windows, a well thought out interior and vintage china giving your eyes as much to feast on as your tastebuds.Dinner is a similar affair, but based around a selection of heavier mains. Of course, you could skip the main and opt for small plates, but you would be depriving yourself of some incredible dishes that border on comfort food.Despite no ambitions of ""being a bar"", the drinks here are made extremely well. If you're partial to a cocktail with your meal, you won't be disappointed.I still haven't been to many of Montreal's ""top tier"" restaurants (Joe Beef, Au Pied... etc), but I'd be comfortable placing Lawrence in that category. Definitely worth it."

My cocktail was great, and the appetizer was A+++++. I'd order the pea toast over and over again. My main plate was meh. Ordered the lamb, and it came with zucchini on top. It had huge chunks where all of the pieces were mushy (no texture). The lamb also overcooked (no red), but had good flavor. I rarely mention dissatisfaction, but I didn't eat the veg after trying three different pieces. I didn't complain, just told the server in case the kitchen might want to know. I had no expectation, and in fact, was about to order dessert. Then I saw the chef go through the garbage to look at my zucchini. The server was friendly, but now had to deliver the news that is how chef wanted the plate. Wait, did I just hear an excuse? I didn't order dessert after that fail. Note: it was just an FYI said out of a courtesy. Maybe I'm wrong in wanting vegetables to have texture and a bit of a bite, but telling me I'm wrong...?"

The creme beigne was also really good. But the toast was what really stood out. Not sure but something is slightly sweet in the thick cut bread and it was really nice with butter. So I would go back if I wanted a very simple breakfast with high quality components, just don't expect a long list of assembled breakfasts."

We got in just before 2pm, it was packed & the hostess told us there was about a 20 minute wait. Luckily a table by the entrance opened up & after it was turned down by the people in front of us- we were seated. Note to all of you table snobs, this place is the size of my living room. It really doesn't matter where you sit.I ordered the English breakfast, while my boyfriend opted for the kidney & eggs dish. Both were spectacular. My meal came with eggs, bacon, sausage, beans, toast & hash. The serving size was generous, but after a long drive we had quite the appetite.  My boyfriend really enjoyed the kidney, saying it was a first for him but definitely not the last. I deducted a star because of the service. Was not the worst but definitely could be better.

I once had this amazing cauliflower dish, I can practically still taste it because I remember telling myself 'don't ever forget this'.  Phenomenal Wine Selection.  You won't be without the perfect choice.  A lot of small producers and unique choices and of course always something to pair with your meal.  They always have something that has some skin contact available and also more traditional styles.  I am pretty adventurous when it comes to wine and I have always been impressed with the offerings.Truth is the food is the main reason I go to LAWRENCE, it is absolutely a well rounded complete experience that I would encourage anyone to enjoy.  Having an off time with your bank account?  Pop in to the Boucherie a couple of doors down and get one of their sandwiches, it's just as much of a treat sans the bells and whistles.  Or just want a quick snack and a cocktail, dip around back to Larry's and they'll take good care of you.  I can tell you right now, even if the service went to shit and the wine list dove off I would still come.  The food is just that good.  Brunch, lunch, dinner, any of it and all of it."

To prevent me from getting a heart attack before dinner, my wife ordered a tomato, cucumber salad which was the first to arrive. Red & green tomatoes and thinly sliced cucumbers were sprinkled with a light vinaigrette. I'm not a salad person but this tasted bright, crisp and fresh. Next, the highlight  of the meal, eggs w/ pied de cuchon and spinach. What I loved about the way they served pig feet is that they took out all the bones and cooked the meat, fat and tendons to perfection. As it is, pork and eggs are a great combination - but the softness and flavor of this pig's feet combined with fluffy eggs blew me away. I seriously contemplated getting another one.Last, and I think this is where this brunch became a meal Caligula would have in one of his orgies, came the pork chops. They were pan fried in butter and had fried sage leaves on top that added an extra layer of flavor to the meat.  Absolutely delicious. Perhaps just a tad overcooked but took nothing away from the dish.I read some of the reviews regarding wait times but luckily we didn't have to wait. As with our general experience with most places in Montreal, the service was good and  the place had it's own charm. Highly recommended for a sinful brunch."

It took an hour of waiting time before we were finally seated. Nice thing is that they took your number so you are free to walk around and come back when your table is ready. However if you don't feel like walking around, there's only a tiny area by the entrance that you can stay and wait, full of people of course.Being popular shouldn't be their fault so I wouldn't down grade them based on that. Staff was all nice and friendly.Food:- Bloody Mary - didn't find it any special and in fact quite plain and light. However the guy next to us was saying it's the best he's ever had..- Scone and stuffed doughnut - both are indeed quite good, as others said.- Baked eggs - nothing like the picture someone else uploaded. They seem to change the menu and recipe from time to time. Mine came in lasagne style with tomato sauce almost taking up the entire plate. Quite greasy. Couldn't eat more after 1/3..- Kidney - my husband's order which I switched mine with since I couldn't eat much of mine.. It's..okay, kidney was tender and the flavor was mild. But still greasy. The toast was completely soaked up in oil :(- Pancake (like biscuit) - this one is fine. Blueberries are fresh and biscuits taste similar to the sconeI only gave 2 stars for the overall experience.

/user_details?userid=XTiFy2-DlUrNuUO1wwKI3g,Carole Lisa R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"By far one of my favorite St.Lau eateries. The menu changes seasonally, so you can always count on a very fresh and fun dish. I finally made it for the brunch, and we loved it. The scone & clotted cream is a must. The clotted cream and homemade jam are impeccable.  Served on real china, this dish is authentic and exquisite. For our main meal, we shared baked eggs with celery root and oyster mushrooms, plus smoked trout with scrambled eggs. Be forewarned--they do not skimp on serving size. Bring your appetite! Both plates are accompanied by a huge, country-style toast. The home-smoked trout is always a favorite, available with the lunch menu as well. This little gem is one of the best spots Montreal has to offer!"

First of all the delightful barista makes me one of the best lattes I've had in the Northern Hemisphere, made from amazing Intelligensia beans - their 'Black Cat Espresso', roasted the perfect one week prior. Then I am served my meal - Ham, Tomme and fried egg on toast with rocket and light dressing. Stunning!!!! The barista informs me that it's all grass fed pig, the ham flakes away when you cut it like only the best does. All the meat comes from the amazing butcher next door. The cheese had a rich and delicious flavour and the perfect texture. Incredible perfect bread, just as your palette asks, 'could this be better?' the mustard kicks in. Best food in Canada?!!!!"

You clearly have a good thing going. The reviews below show that people are into your food and vibe. Sometimes they're even into the service. But not always. CONSISTENCY is key, my friend.I have been to Lawrence a handful of times in the few years that they've been open. The brunch is kinda weird but super yummy, with limited options. The dinner is totally awesome and so good you don't want to stop eating it. But the service is lame.There is NO excuse, when you're charging upscale prices, for crappy service. I'm going to tip a percentage of my meal cost, so if you're going to put out great plates and charge $45 for a starter and main before I even order a drink, you best be doing the following five things which you did not do tonight (and have inconsistently done on previous visits):1) Offer me a drink2) Tell me what's great about your menu, and explain some of the lesser known items on the menu instead of forcing me to ask3) Be present for me to actually ask4) Be timely with the check5) Have a baseline pleasant demeanor.You don't HAVE to fake-laugh at my joke, but the sourpuss look was really uncalled for. If you don't like your job, quit. I'm a server myself, so I get it that the chef/manager/owner's wife can be a jerk sometimes... but you know what? I wasn't a jerk. Sometimes the best part of your day is a nice customer. I wish I'd had the opportunity to show you... but you weren't really around."

Lawrence menu and selection is original and different from the usual and common eggs Benedict's, omelettes and french toast plates that you get in almost every restaurant that serves brunch in Montreal. Lawrence will revisit the brunch classics by adding their personal touch and sublimate them with original and savory accompaniments. Lawrence is also very affordable and has a nice and trendy ambiance."

It got a great texture. The only thing I don't like about this place is it is really crowed. People are standing next you your table waiting to be seated. But overall, nice restaurant."

Unfortunately we were not able to catch it for brunch, but lunch instead on a Tuesday.  The restaurant is cute and small but good thing we made a ressie. Our service was prompt and polite. The menu isn't extensive; we started off with a delicious but simple green salad (well dressed with salt, olive oil), and super yummy octopus toast, perfectly seated on a bed of spinach and roasted red pepper aioli (yummy).  Best dish we had. We shared the delicious sausage dish, spicy and crispy in a bed of onions and legumes and some kind of mayo. It was a bit salty though.  We also shared the burger which was fluffy and fatty. Came with really good potato wedge fries and mayo. Come back for brunch to get your hands on the donuts, that's our biggest regret!   Lawrence was a nice change for something more culinary driven, and a break from the brown sauce nature of Montreal food."

The wait for us on a Saturday was about 45 minutes and not too painful of a wait since there are shops all along the street that you can pop in and out of. When it was our turn, we were greeted by a super friendly staff that took our order and came back with our juices and coffee immediately. For noshie, we got the chocolate custard and lemon doughnuts to start. Great starter! Perfect way to start your day! I got the smoked salmon and scrambled eggs and hubster got the French toast with apples and rhubarb. Smoked salmon paired with perfectly scrambled eggs is such a joy. It's something that really isn't that hard but for some reason a lot of restos eff up by overcooking the scramble. Over here, the runny to scramble consistency was perfect! And when paired with smoke salmon, it is pure joie de vivre! Hubs French toast was a nice compliment to my savory dish. If anybody says Lawrence when I'm in Montreal I will always say MAIS OUI!"

OK, nothing particularly great, the bread they served was very good though, but the meal itself was forgettable. I had the lamb the first time and the octopus the second time, my friend got the porc. The meat we both found was overcooked and ended up being dry and tough.  The second time I was there the service was abnormally slow, we arrived at around 7:30 and was seated immediately, but we didn't actually get our meal until 9:30, partly because they had messed up the order and brought the wrong main course.The staff were very nice though, approachable, friendly, and offered a free dessert for the mix up of the main course. I've never been here for brunch... I would be willing to go back and try the brunch, but I probably won't come back for dinner if there are other choices."

But there was a lot of it. The fried lamb lung was delicious and came with spinach, potatoes and mustard, which was okay too. The lung, oddly enough, was the better dish. I also had an orange wine for the first time. It was good, light, semi dry. More of a yellow but maybe I'm bad with colors."

When I got it, I was surprised at the portion a little bit and the taste. The food itself was very good, but I guess I expected a WOW factor, which I didn't get. It also was quite expensive for lunch ($50/2 people with 2 small dishes each). I might return for brunch since they're so highly praised for it, but not for lunch or dinner."

We ordered the pasta plate, the hake fish and the octopus appetizer. The bill came out to 60$ tax & tip included. The food was good but my husband was still hungry and was it 60$ worth? I have no doubt that the ingredients was of the highest quality as they market but gosh darn, I wish that pasta plate had a bit more pasta. Normally, I expect pasta plates, especially priced at 16$ to leave me full. It was the smallest bowl of pasta I have yet to see. The hake fish was small but I expect this when the fish is fresh, this is why we ordered the pasta, expecting the fish to be small but tasty and fresh and the pasta to be filling. Unfortunately, it was not. However, service was great, attentive, informative. And I went next door to the butcher shop to get some granola which I love. They also sell delicious honey that actually has that floral fragrance. I heard from a friend that the butcher shop sandwiches are really good, I think I will come back to the butcher shop to try that."
/user_details?userid=H98PhdzsBo1uVkjur3jReg,Jacqueline Y.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,"SERIOUS SERIOUS brunch. The sausage egg roll, listed on thrillist's 12 best dishes in montreal, isn't for anyone that's looking to be healthy. I was really hesitant to order it by the way it's described and it looks just like a hamburger with an egg on top of it. But i trusted that if its one of the 12 best dishes... it's probably worth a try and a 5 mile run afterwards. It doesn't look like anything special, but that giant sausage patty is fresh (if you can even call sausage patties fresh), flavorful and juicy. It's like a quarter pounder on a brioche but better. I tried to avoid the brioche to cut the carbs, but you needed the brioche (and crisp cucumbers) to balance the flavorful sausage.  I wouldn't order this on a date because it's messy, but I would definitely share with a partner. Great coffee too!"

My brunch was delicious: smoked trout and scrambled eggs, nom nom nom. Everyone else in my group looked like they also had some tasty food.It's a tad on the expensive side of the scale brunch-wise, but the portion sizes are fair and they make a mean cappuccino."

I was well received by the waitstaff upon arrival (it was still very quiet). My meeting was running late so I ended up waiting for 15 minutes. I had spent a few minutes looking at the wine list when I got there. 10 minutes later, the waitress had not look led at me once or come to offer me a drink. Had to signal her (there were 2 waitresses and a busboy for approximately 12 customers at this point) to come take my drink order. I didn't feel too adventurous and most menu items did not speak to me so I ordered the burger. I asked for it medium (waitress said they typically serve it mid-rare) as I expected a high quality meat. It was really nothing special at all, and tasted and had the texture of very basic, lean ground beef. Definitely not ground filet and the seasoning was lacking for a restaurant of this quality. I don't even know if they put salt and pepper in their mix. It is served with a sliced tomato, lettuce, mayo and Dijon (how original)...Lawrence needs to up their burger game. My friend had a bass dish that was very well presented and he enjoyed. I have to give this place another shot but for a $70 lunch for two (main and glass of wine each), I expect better service and some differentiation in a common dish such as a burger."

Ah well we put our name down and decided to walk around the area as we were told there would be an hour or so wait.The menu is simple with a few dishes. We decided to stick with french toast, pancakes and ordered a scone for good measures. We ordered some fresh apple juice and a cappuccino.The scone was quite good with decent sides of clotted cream, butter and fruit compote. Then the wait began for the mains and it went on and on and it was good 45 min before we got out stuff (unacceptable at any place as the server wouldn't even say sorry for the delay or give an explanation)French Toasts looked visually appealing with a good quantity of maple syrup and rhubab compote. Decent but not earth shattering in anyway.The pancake were weird and unlike something I have had before. The batter was hard to explain and had layers and had a weird dry finish. The maple syrup helped as otherwise they would be inedible.3 stars due to poor service and average food."
/user_details?userid=O004e8vRsmmFsZi5_RVuJA,David P.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"By far the best meal you could enjoy in Mile End area of Montreal without dropping a C-note. Started off with a surprisingly packed green salad since my partner and I were feeling guilty after gorging ourselves on poutine the night before. Can you tell we are tourists??? Normally something like a green salad is a forgettable item on the menu, bot not at Lawrence! Theirs is well-balanced, packed with radishes and tomatoes, and full of flavor, testament to the effort they put into every part of the meal. Continued with the medley of beef liver, carrots, honey, and goat cheese. Mindblowingly good! My favorite thing about the restaurant scene in Montreal is how chefs take unusual or less attractive ingredients like liver and transform them into outstanding dishes. I'm now a big fan of liver - who knew?The lead singer of this meal, however, was the Sockeye salmon tartare. Generally I am hesitant to order raw foods outside of a sushi restaurant, because I imagine the cooks have less experience preparing them. But I'm so glad I went for it - the salmon tartare danced between savory/salty notes of the oil and fleshy, succulent textures of the fish. It was divine! My partner had the equally satisfying liver sausage with lentils. Again, I'm a liver convert now thanks to Lawrence. Service was impeccable, the owner and host were very friendly. If you're visiting Montreal, Lawrence should be your first stop for food!"

Okay no problem, I wanted to try a new place anyways.Good : the top part of the baked eggs with celery root and oyster mushrooms. That was tasty, the portion looked small at first glance, but its actually really filling. Bad : We had to wait about 15 minutes to get a glass of water. When I asked the waitress what was a popular dish here or what she'd recommended, she said ""everything."" Great, might as well have played eeny, meeny, miny, moe. Bottom line : I'll be honest, I was a bit disappointed. It wasn't anything special, might not return, especially since there is always a line up."

At lunch, it was a vibe mixed with new moms and bebes, power lunchers, ladies lunching and refined men enjoying a beer. The lunch menu is brief and beautiful. Grilled cheese sandwiches, salads, charcuterie plates on the small half of the sheet; pastas, stews, hash on the larger side. My $15 corned beef hash was perfectly topped with a runny sunnyside up egg. Hat tip to the chef - seems to be the toughest egg to master. The corned beef was juicy, yet flaky and melt in your mouth. Overall it looked slight for the price, but with so many rich flavours, it was the right size afterall. As is the trend right now, it was topped with an arugula salad. The spice of it was quite the accompaniment. My dining pal had a salad + fries, which our server described as her lunch of choice, nicknamed the ""angel and the devil."" The fries, which are served with mayo, are more like pillowy wedges. I was privy to a bite, and then I must admit, I couldn't stop myself, and ate nearly half (gasp!)."

The dishes we had were both quite good and we even brought our twin boys (3 years old) with us and they were just well behaved enough and the room loud enough that we managed to pull off a nice meal even with them. I am taking off one star for service. At this price point (our bill inched close to $200 with drinks and gratuity for essentially two people plus two kids who shared one appetizer), we would expect very good service but the service was slow and not terribly attentive. At the end of our meal, we asked about dessert and then didn't see a server for at least 10 minutes so we gave up and then had to ask someone else passing by to flag down our server and request the check. It was time lost for us (with two restless kids) and money lost for them since we otherwise would've stayed for dessert. All that said, we'd probably come back.

It is a holiday here today but the menu was only the lunch menu and no brunch/breakfast items were available. The coffee we ordered while waiting was extremely bitter and not drinkable probably because the hostess (the bitchy one) told us that it was the end of the pot.

The restaurant is cozy, so it is better for groups of four or less. The french toast with rhubarb and strawberries was not overly sweet, and three people at our table loved it! The ham and eggs on toast also received good reviews from everyone, the only criticism being that it was a little difficult to cut with a  butter knife.

We got donuts, the scone, some apple mimosas, and I got the scrapple dish. Everything was delicious, and this was the best brunch we had in Montreal - well worth the 45 minute wait (I'm from NY, so I'm used to waiting for brunch anyway...).The neighborhood (Mile End) is full of cool shops and fun little boulangeries and coffee houses, so make use of your wait by walking around and checking things out."

I found Lawrence here on Yelp and we headed to Mile End. The neighborhood looked deserted when we arrived, but we quickly realized that everyone was at Lawrence already. We waited patiently in a café across the street, and a quick 45 minutes later we had the option of a seat at the bar, or a cozy 4-seater in the corner next to two girls fervently gossiping in French. We're no strangers to close dining quarters, and chose the table.We quickly ordered some Bloody Marys (hair of the dog), and I insisted that we start by sharing a scone with jam and clotted cream. YUM.After putting the order in, our eyes simultaneously wandered over to the bar (probably impatiently awaiting our drinks), and landed on...Spiderman! I was SO close to being seated right next to Tobey Maguire. There's something so much more exciting about seeing a celebrity outside of NYC, and I was instantly annoyed at our seating choice. The Bloody Marys and scone made up for it though, two good decisions outweighing the bad one.For mains I ordered kedgeree, a fried rice dish with ham, plum tomatoes, hard boiled eggs and other goodies all mixed together. It was savory and comforting. Boyfriend ordered something similar that had shredded meat (pulled pork maybe?), potatoes, hard boiled eggs, and a delicious sardine sauce. This might have been better than New York brunch. Just maybe."

I was very very pleased. Been hearing the folklore about this place for a while and what they say is true! The things I adored:i) Tea cups! Really china cups!ii) Little donuts! Wee little donuts!iii) Pretty, smiley, and very friendly staff... at least our lovely waitress was.iv) The brunch itself. I had the scramble with creme fraiche on their rustic bread with a side of smoked salmon. I fell in love with those eggs. Ladies and gentlemen, this is how eggs should taste I tells ya...

You show up, your number is taken down and you get a call when your table is ready. It helps that there are tons of shops up and down St. Laurent while you wait. As for the food, they offer a good variety of interesting brunch options. The portion sizes were good. When the food arrived, it was good but not great. The coffee is bottomless which is nice p. In addition I found the space that they occupy less than ideal, it is crowded, loud, and too open. Not having double doors on the winter really doesn't work. My date and I were both rather cold from the constant draft from the door, taking away from the dining experience. Overall, I found Lawrence to be slightly overrated. I went once and would think twice before going again because of the price."

I don't love a sweet drink, but I love blackberries and the blackberry martini was sweetsour, strong, perfection. The risotto was light, comforting, friendly.

A nice place to have a comfortable dining experience,interact with the bartender i.e. first time there, and from out of town.The cocktails were very, very good. Well balanced, well executed.Out of habit, I ordered ""my"" aperitif of choice, which is only two liquors mixed evenly over ice,It's simple, flavourful and strong. And it came out great. Based on that I ordered something more adventurous andit was one of the best cocktails I've had in awhile.The person tending the bar, also served as our ""foodcierge"", we asked a lot of questions before ordering, after all, the menu does present a lot of items you don't often see, and based on the the reccommendatiion I was given - a trusted friend and ex-big deal chef - I wanted to be fully informed to avoid any remorse.After getting the seafood sampler to share, we were both fuler than we anticipated.Maybe it was all the buttered bread/delivery system for the herring, roe, mackerel, welks, etc. So we decided to split the steak - plus we were going out for a night on the town.It was cooked perfectly, and the mashed potatoes were great.Yes, I didn't get oxtail anything, but, we're both suckers for steak.Plus it's a tad more shareable.Sitting at the bar was a great way to get experience Lawrence for the first time.Hopefully next time I can take a run at their wine list."

This isn't what I was expecting from Lawrence at all, which shows don't judge a book by its cover. Or in Lawrence's case, don't judge a brunch place by the daintiness of its decor. I went with a friend early enough (around 10.30) in the morning on Saturday, advised by the restaurant when I called the night before trying to make a reservation. They only take reservations for groups of 6 or more. We got seated right away and our server did all the right things in terms of serving us water, getting us coffee and the menu in a timely fashion. I was split between ordering the french toasts (which according to a few Yelp reviews, are amazing) and the full English breakfast, since I was rather in the mood for a savoury meal. The server recommended the English breakfast, so I took her advice. It was a lovely looking platter consisting of a huge sausage, two thick slices of bacon, sauteed little whole mushrooms, beans, a thick slab of mashed potatoes with a crispy top, a sunny side up egg on top, and a toast. The way they arranged these items made it look like it wasn't a big meal. But once again, looks deceive and as I worked through it, I realized I would probably have a hell of a time finishing it. So the verdict: it was a very good, satisfying brunch. The mushrooms and the potato slab were fantastic. The bacon was a little particular, seeing that it was a thick cut, so if you like your bacon crispy, you probably won't like it. It was still delicious nevertheless. The one thing I wish they'd given me was jam or something a bit sweet that I could put on my toast. After that very salty meal, it would be a very nice touch in the end. I would certainly go back, but earlier. The restaurant is small and the seats very close to one another so as it filled up, the noise level was quite deafening."

The service is flawless. The bread is amazing. A simple dinner menu that changes with the season will have you coming back for more. I have eaten several fantastic appetizers, but my husband's main course was always better than mine. His duck confit and wild mushroom pasta dishes were both outstanding. My arctic char with dill, potatoes and horseradish had pickles as a secret ingredient, and pickles for me are a lunchtime thing.  Watch out for the cocktails - unabashedly strong and delicious.

As I looked around, I noticed the deco is quite simple.. White walls and different styles of lamps. Imperfection at it's best. The place is small, loud, yet very comfortable chairs and benches. We decided to order two things, knowing already I would want to come back. We began with a large ramekin of one egg, caramelized onions, chili peppers and stewed tomatoes. Each bite was a bite of perfection and a spicy kick. Those that do not like spicy food, this is not for you.  We also tried their french toast, which by far was the best I had. This dish was as warm and comforting as your typical Christmas cookies. The French toast consisted of two slices of delicious & buttery brioche. Which is how a good French toast should be done! It was dipped in a delicious sweet mixture, so it would be soft on the outside, and still moist without being soggy on the inside. It was served with a fresh canberry compote and a perfect small amount of fresh house made whipped cream. Decorated with small chunks of juicy apples, and cinnamon.  Again, the best I've had to this day. The Ritz Carlton couldn't match up to this breakfast.Oh, you may ask yourself. With this great review why only four stars? The one, and only down side to this charming restaurant, is it's noise level. Due to the fact that it gets crowded easily and it's small, it's a loud ambiance. My solution to this? Speak louder and focus on the food! :)"

It was unique and lovely, though it gets busy and is a bit on the pricier side.Very minimal decor, and big glass windows. There was about a 30min wait at 1pm for Sunday brunch. It passed quite quickly though. We were sat down by the owner who was our server. The tables are nice and big so there's space even though it's full. The menu is small, and features 10 or so various brunch creations. More unique ones, like pickled herring with bacon, eggs and rye. Or scrambled eggs with smoked trout. Which was a nice change than the regular eggs Benedict etc. I had the smoked trout with scrambled eggs which was excellent. The scrambled eggs was done in a very unique creamy and herby way. Also, the mimosas and bloody mary was also excellent and strong.People I was with had the baked eggs, and the English breakfast. It all looked great and feedback was positive. We also tried the donuts at the end which were excellent.It definitely leans on the pricier side, and service feels a little passive, but overall a really nice experience. Understated with quality food. The wait is a little off-putting, especially since you can't reserve for less than 6 people, but I'd definitely happily return if the opportunity came up.

The bloody mary was pretty darn good, but I wished it to be spicier! Personally, I really enjoyed the french toast - I've rarely had fresh cranberries on anything, and that added a nice touch to the overall dish, as simple as it is. The trout was fresh, though small in portions, but my friend was addicted to the scrambled eggs as they were sort of more liquid, like a scrambled egg sauce. We weren't huge fans of the toast that accompanied the eggs, though, as it was quite hard and we weren't a fan of the flavour.Service was good - water was frequently refilled and staff were friendly.  The decor is quite like the post-modern industrial feel with industrial wire lightbulbs, and darker blue colours with cool art hanging about. I also really dug the wallpaper in the washroom, as a side note.Glad I got to try Lawrence this time around!"

We called around 5 pm the night of and they only had a early (6:30) and late (9:30, not THAT late in our books) spot available.

I wanted something on the lighter side after having poutine very late the night before (4 AM so technically that morning) and the menu at Lawrence was just what I was looking for. I arrived just as they were opening and was quickly seated.  I asked my server for a recommendation and he suggested the steak tartare and a side of fries with lemon aioli.  I argued that I didn't want fries because of the poutine but my server insisted I get them.  When I questioned him further, he answered with a simple but firm ""Yes.""  I owe him big time.  They were just incredible.  They were cut so thick that you almost can't call them fries.  I was worried at first because I was convince they would be severly undercooked on the inside. That's how thick they were.  I was so wrong. They were cooked golden brown on the outside and soft as a pillow inside.  That kitchen knows what they are doing.  My beef tartare was also fantastic.  It was so simply prepared but the quality of the beef and freshness of the egg yolk were evident.  It had just enough of the other ingredients that anything else would have detracted from the dish.  A different, but deliciously satisfying take on steak and potatoes. Lawrence is no secret apparently because within 30 minutes, the place was bustling with a line forming outside.  Like I said, it wasn't loud but it was buzzing. Highly recommended!"

/user_details?userid=d1G6qV4v2RT2o8v27anr2w,John Paul T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Lawrence is undoubtedly one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal. Located in the heart of Mile End, Lawrence serves up Canadian bistro classics with a French flare. The food itself changes rather frequently and the menu features fresh (local, where possible) ingredients. Last night I had the pork chop with braised radicchio and mustard fruits. The pork was so succulent and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Pork can be so overcooked, dry and bland that I often avoid it at all costs when ordering at a restaurant. But a friend of mine recommended the fatty (in the best way possible) incarnation that they serve at Lawrence and I was not at all disappointed. My boyfriend had the braised octopus and he said it was also perfectly cooked. Octopus is a funny fish to cook and many many chefs have a hard time avoiding the 'rubber factor,' where octopus inevitably comes out chewy as all hell, reminiscent of jaw-breaker chewing gum. Such is not the case at Lawrence where the food artists in the kitchen are well versed on cooking seafood. Our party of 10 guests had most of the items of the menu and some of the other fan favourites included Striped bass (again, the seafood!) and bay scallops and potato cake on the appetizer menu.Lawrence is also a great place to drink; the wine menu--red, white, and rose--is extensive and the serving staff are more than happy to suggest some perfect pairings. In a departure from my usual ordering of a dry white or pinto grigio I opted for a beer on tap (en fut). The Blonde de Chambly was just the kind of beer I was looking for--not too bitter but rather a light beer with a citrusy flavour intermixed with an almost honey-like sweetness.  A really nice--and award winning--option for all those diners sick of the usual wine options. In terms of cocktails where were a number of satisfied drinkers in our party. The whiskey sour was probably one of the best I've here had--hands down. And I am connoisseur of whiskey sours! Ha! The decor--for all you foodies who also love indulging in fabulous decor--was really creative and on-point. The wallpaper in the washrooms and the industrial-chic touches paired with more traditional pieces creates a really pleasant space in which to dine. Just a note about the staff--the service was flawless. I had originally made reservations elsewhere but our party grew to an unwieldy 10 people and we needed to switch locations. I called on a Saturday afternoon for reservations and the crew at Lawrence made it work for us! While dined rather late--10pm--it was totally worth it and I will be forever grateful for their accommodating efforts. GO! You must! Its one of Montreal's finest."

Every time I eat here, I high-five the chefs and the wait staff. You must get a scone and/or the donuts. Other than that, throw a dart at the menu. You'll be happy no matter what. Not the cheapest place on Earth (average $15 a plate) but the food is fabulous and the menu changes pretty frequently to keep it fresh. Coffee is passable (it is no Café Sardine). Great bloody mary, although the $8 stings more than the tabasco. If you get there even shortly after opening on a weekend, expect to wait an hour or so. Worth it tho. Just have a cup of tea on the couch and enjoy your spot in the queue.   DINNER REVIEW:I've only been once for dinner in my year back in Montreal. I know I enjoyed myself and the food was quite good, but not mind-altering like brunch. For the price and the talent in the kitchen, I expected better. It was a while ago, so the details are a bit fuzzy. Given my love affair with their morning fare, I will definitely try it again and report.Rating Scale:1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."

They did a 6 course Prix-Fixe meal with complimentary bubbles at midnight for $80 per person. A bit expensive but totally worth it.Here is what they served: Grilled chicken hearts and remoulade - I've had duck hearts in the past served in a similar way & didn't like them. This dish was really good, hearts were cooked medium rare on a skewer. Not chewy at all. Remoulade was light & full of flavor.Preserved goose and mustard pears - another great dish, the goose was super rich and the preserved pears added a nice punch of sweet & salty.Roast Halibut with  zucchini & oysters - unfortunately I'm allergic to oysters but they were able to accommodate & omit them. Halibut was light and flakey with a dollop of lemon butter on top. Fish broth had a lot of depth.Braised Kid (baby goat) with Jerusalem artichokes & tomatoes - another great dish, the goat was super succulent.

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"A brief vacation abroad has gotten me behind on my postings so pardon the tardiness. For the event of Valentine's Day, one seeks a restaurant where you can have a relaxed and intimate atmosphere and where you can almost guarantee a certain level of quality... especially if the restaurant is not one already known to your significant other. Sadly many restaurants succumb to the ""special"" St-Valentine's day menu to accommodate the larger number of patrons they may expect. Personally that doesn't fly for me so I wanted a place that had their usual menu and that wouldn't be trying to push us out the door to get more people. In the end, I decided to take my girlfriend (such a strange word to write after all this time... haha) to my Mile End favourite, Lawrence. While I had never been for dinner as of yet, my brunch place of choice had been on my list for a while dinner-wise. I was pretty confident that this would be a good choice, so off we went for a hopefully lovely Saturday night.From an atmosphere point of view, Lawrence hit it perfectly for dinner. The low lighting, the sparse yet comfy surroundings, the good but not intrusive music and most importantly, the impeccable service from end-to-end. Good attention from the entire service team and without any sense of pushing us out. Wonderful job by co-owner Sefi Amir and her team - perfect on a night such as Valentine's day.First up, we were treating to some of Lawrence's wonderfully fresh bread (available at their butcher shop down the street) to go with some starting drinks. On this evening, I chose to go with the Bourdon Apple Cider. Loved the touch of rosemary to go with the combination of bourbon and apple.For starters, I went with the salted duck breast with lentils, radishes and parmesan because I can't say no to duck when it's on the menu. A consistent theme with Lawrence when you scan the menu is how the combinations in the dishes seem slightly strange when you read them aloud. Thankfully however, the combinations work beautifully. In this case, the salty and fatty duck breast mixed so well with the freshness of the radishes, the sharpness of the parmesan and the lentils. Such a wonderful dish. The first bite pretty much confirmed that I had made the right choice for the night.My girlfriend went with the octopus with chickpeas and coriander. Outside of the wonderfully tender octopus, the interesting part of this dish was the overall creaminess with the sauce which somehow didn't overshadow the coriander and the chickpeas. Just another wonderfully fresh dish from the kitchen.Main dish wise, Lawrence is strong on meats which I love... the fact that I greatly enjoy their butcher shop and understand the quality of meats they use made me very excited to see how they use their own products in the restaurant. My choice of the pork sirloin with sauerkraut, sage and leeks certainly lived up to my expectations. A beautiful piece of fatty pork, the acidic sauerkraut and the cooked down leeks all held together by a small sauce... just a great meaty dish. I loved this plate so much.... which makes the fact that my girlfriend's choice was even better just blow my mind.Pig's offal (in this case - heart, tongue and liver) with clams and salt lemon and white beans. Just ridiculous in all the right ways. Beautiful pieces of offal cooked perfectly, the fresh clams, the rich broth, the hardiness of the beans... this dish was a perfect balance of all the elements one seeks in a dish. This is a dish who people who say they will never like offal and those who love it. If you can't love this dish, you have a serious problem.We still had some room for dessert so we went for a piece of marshmallow, chocolate and spice cake. The one relative negative of the night - I enjoyed all the components individually but something didn't mesh properly together. Personally I think the texture of the marshmallow was the weak link for me.So a slight negative to finish the evening but it didn't matter frankly. Lawrence was the experience I had hoped for and the one I hoped my girlfriend would get to experience for her first time. It was great evening through and through. Props to Chef Cohen and the rest of the staff for the great meal. I was already a fan with brunch and their butcher shop. Dinner just confirmed how amazing Lawrence is and how I will continue to support the wonderful work they do. You should as well!Cheers!"

THERE ARE HIPSTERS IN MONTRÉAL!!! HOLY SHIT!!!!) and just cut to how spectacular this restaurant is.After making a reservation earlier in the day, I biked over in the freezing rain with my girlfriend for a nice little mid-december date night.  The server that took the reservation earlier in the afternoon was still there to seat us and get us started with the menu and some drinks.I had a nice little manhattan made by the classy barman and my girlfriend had a martini.  Both drinks were at least as good as any that could be found by my favorite watering hole down the street.  Afterwards, the server explained the menu and specials to us; it's nice to have a server that knows what they will be serving.We had an opener of deliciously-salted smoked mackerel with endives, bacon, and a poached egg (I hate eggs) which was very dificult to not inhale.  Well-balanced flavours and easily enough to start off two non-obese people.After mulling over the mains (the beef offal with mashed potatoes was given very serious consideration) I went ahead and go the pork chop served with braised radicchio, and mustard fruits (who even serves these!?!?).  It was perfectly succulent and went along swimmingly with its plate mate.  My date ordered the celery-root tortellini with parsley, walnuts, and sheep's cheese.  She seemed pleased enough and the morsels that I managed to steal away from her were mouthgasmic.Finally, we decided to close off the evening with a baked alaska which was (not surprisingly) quickly consumed and savoured joyfully with our wine (I forget which, but it was red and French and hit the spot).As for the décor and ambiance; it was perfect.  There were some curtains up at the door to a) keep out the draft (I mentioned freezing rain, right?) and b) provide entertainment to the diners as they watch the guests fumble about to find the entrance.I certainly hope to be back soon.  I hear that the brunch is phenomenal."

Friends and I were looking for a brunch place on our last day in Montreal, and we weren't disappointed with Lawrence. The wait was about an hour long, but we took the time to just explore the area. The beauty of eating with multiple friends is that you can share dishes. The four of us ordered: smoked trout and scrambled eggs, French toast with strawberries and rhubarb, the English breakfast, and the pork chop with fried eggs and sage.I cannot even begin to tell you how delicious the food was. Everything was cooked to perfection. The pork chops were mindblowingly juicy and scrumptious. The French Toast was the perfect fluffiness and coupled with the strawberries were prime. The English Breakfast was pretty standard, but the trout was definitely a gem as well.I find myself giving this place a 4.5 for the food, but a 5 for the excellent service. All the waiters were extremely kind and attentive. Honestly, I really can't find any reason not to dine here. I've been to a number of brunch places in my life, and I have to say that Lawrence definitely ranks in the top three--for the quality and variety of food, the ambience, and excellent service.tldr; a much come brunch place in Montreal"

It was a quiet evening, only one group of four people were dining in. We decided to try the fish platter, which is an arrangement of fish in different form and sizes. The platter is good for two and was really delicious, as there was a wide variety of fish. As for the starter, we shared the calamari salad with aioli and saffron. It was the best meal of the evening. Things went south after, when our main dishes arrived. The plates were extremely generous and too much salt in both plates. We couldn't eat it all and hard to taste other than the salt from the sauce. Sometimes, small plates with remarkable taste are more memorable than larger plates...even if they both cost the same price.  As for service, it was quick and easy-going since there was not a lot of people. The waitress was kind to suggest wine not from the menu. Overall, it was a good dinner, but not enough for us to return as there are so many good (and better) restaurants in Montreal for the same price (around 200$ for 2). Maybe we will try their brunch someday."

I wouldn't know because I can't stop ordering that Baked Eggs/Celeriac dish over and over and over again. It's like the Mona Lisa of breakfast recipes, absolutely perfect. The coffee is pretty good, too.The waitstaff is really friendly and give off that neighborly vibe, and the patrons are easygoing and patient, which is important because space is at a premium and the lineups can get heavy on weekends.

/user_details?userid=epc3A9SHHBfOwxIOCPW7eA,Lindsay W.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"The Spot: Remember when Sparrow opened and, even beyond being a hub for hip Mile Enders, it was Montreal's premier spot for quintessentially British brunches and lunches? That was London-born chef Marc Cohen's doing. He brought with him the most traditional meals from his homeland, and franco- and anglo-Montrealers alike were digging it. Only, Sparrow used sundown as an excuse to turn into a casual drinking spot and as a result did not have the resources to put together high-class dinner services. So, Cohen packed up his things, crossed the street, and opened Lawrence.It's a little brighter, more of an open space, and the large windows overlooking Saint-Laurent and Fairmount letting sunlight or city lights in. And yes, a dinner service is now offered, with meals fancier and slightly subtler. Otherwise, it's not too different; there's still a simple chic and effortless informality, and there are still decadent English breakfasts and lunches.What's Really Good?: Listen. It's January in Montreal, and I'm writing about the most comforting of all cuisines, so almost everything on that menu seems really good. Forced to choose, two brunch meals stand out: the ham, Tomme and fried egg on toast, and the Kedgeree.I know - what the heck is a Kedgeree. It is made of flaked fish, hard-boiled eggs, boiled rice and butter, often seasoned with parsley and curry powder. It is a hybrid of Indian and English cooking that originated in the UK after the colonization of India sometime in the nineteenth century. More importantly, when it's done right, it's delicious. And Lawrence does it right.If your ideal Sunday brunch does not typically involve creatures of the sea (or curry powder), then move away from the Kedgeree and move towards Lawrence's best classic breakfast item - the ham, Tomme and fried egg on toast. The slightly melted, soft-tasting Tomme cheese is a killer addition to an otherwise rudimentary meal (who does ham and fried eggs better than the English, though?), and, topped with a light green salad, it strikes the perfect balance between those binge-brunches you crave when you're hungover and fine lunch cuisine.If you're visiting the restaurant in the evening, let me make one suggestion: don't miss out on the pork chops. Oftentimes they are viewed as too plain to order, but believe me when I say that, at Lawrence, they're not. They're perfectly juicy and rosy and, paired with radicchio and apples, they don't taste anything like the dry pork chops your mother whipped up after picking you up from school.You'll Wanna Know: One of the major upgrades Cohen made when moving from Sparrow to Lawrence was finding a quality sommelier. Etheliya Hananova grew up working in her parents' restaurant from the age of eight onwards and developed her taste for wine and food through the years in Montreal and Brooklyn. Before joining Lawrence, she was one of the sommeliers at Le Club Chasse et Pêche, and she's just about as friendly and charming as they come.But fellow brunch fanatics, there is no need to feel left out. On weekends, Lawrence borrows one of Montreal's finest baristas, Keaton Ritchie, from one of Montreal's most adored cafés, Café Myriade (which has a new location on Saint-Viateur, FYI). I'm sure coffee lovers will agree that a good barista is just as important as a quality sommelier. And at weekend brunch, probably even more important."

And she sometimes turns to Montreal Brunch and Breakfast to get the intel on newer places (P.S. I, too, enjoy this site). A month before my visit, she told me about Lawrence.I wanted to try it for dinner but we were so slow to move this weekend and just couldn't get it together for a ""night out"". Or maybe it was just me. I was a bit of a mess this weekend. I think it started with the Pinot Grigio I pounded back on Friday night as soon as I got in. After that I was so sloppy - dropping things, lots of things, many times. *sheepish grin*We woke up late Sunday morning and Bixi-ed over to find a crowd. Luckily I was still half-asleep and could use the time to fully wake up. The host took our name and number and said he'd call when a table opened. It was about a 20 minute wait so we decided to get some bagels and enjoy the sun and spring breeze.Once inside, the place reminded me of Sunday lunch by the sea. Do you know what I mean? Picturesque and lively, kinda like a sweet song.  I don't know how else to explain it. The staff seemed to love their jobs which means flawless service. In fact, in keeping with comparisons that make no sense, our server was like daisies in a milk jug. I know, these metaphors are so left field...anyway...Something to take note of is the fact that Lawrence changes both its menus via twitter - so 21st century. I love it. Okay seriously, aren't you dying to take a fork and pop that benny ball???It's so plump.  I had the Eggs Benedict ($15) and my sister had the Fiddleheads, bacon, soda bread and fried eggs ($16); the only caveat being that they ran out of fiddleheads and substituted asparagus. Score! We don't like fiddleheads, but love asparagus.My sister's dish was delicious. Everything was seasoned well and put together made for yummy breakfast bites. My Benny was equally yummy - decadent hollandaise over perfectly poached eggs and lean, smoky ham - not like deli ham or bacon, but like porky pork.Lawrence's brunch was definitely Top 10 for me, but one particular menu item catapulted them to the top of the list.  The beigne au chocolat ou au citron aka homemade doughnuts. Yes, doughnuts. It's no secret I love doughnuts, but my sister who doesn't enjoy them as much as I do loved them. Something tells me I'll find her there next weekend eating a plate on her own. Ha.These little beignets are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside with a filling of either chocolate or lemon. The lemon curd-custard was tangy and sweet and oh so heavenly. At only three per order for $5, don't share. Sharing sucks, here's half of the third that I had to give my sister. You'd think she would have let me have it, considering I'm younger. It would have been the big sister thing to do, non? Vous vous engagez?"

/user_details?userid=U3ORHloeNfOD3XnGYc0gXA,Neal G.,"Manhattan, NY",5 star rating,"ave been here a number of times, and the food is consistantly excellent.  Today my wife had the scrambled eggs with smoked trout.  The scrambled eggs were fortified with cream, creme freche and egg yolk in order to create a smooth, creamy and delicious consistancy laced with chives and salted perfectly.  Served over a nice artisinal bread perfectly crisped, made it a very delightful dish.  THe smoked trout was the best I had ever had.  Perfectly smoked, and not too salty.  The chef does that himself, and I have had his salmon at other times.  5 out of 5. My daughter had a small fried egg with bacon.  Sounds simple, but the bacon was extremely smoky and delicious. One of the best bacons I have tasted. I had deviled kidneys.  The sauce of sherry, cider, cream and shallots was a perfect compliment, the watercress was great and added freshness to the dish.  The bread soaked up the delicious sauce nicely. Coffee-good quality coffee from 49th parallel in Vancouver. High acidity and nuanced-though I am not a real coffee drinker.  Tea-very good quality longjing (dragon well tea)  but some real preparation problems; about 1/2 gram for 300ML of water and the infuser was of the stiff metal type which doesn't let the water flow so nicely.  I think for that amount of water, you should use about 10 grams of tea. Better still use a small pot with only 120ML and use about 4 grams of tea.  Do about 3 infusions.  But at least they tried by using a high quality loose leaf tea.  Points for trying, but deductions for not listening when I said ""not enough tea"" and they said ""try it you'll like it-we can add more tea later"". The owner's wife is one of the servers, and all of the servers are attentive and knowlegeable (more or less).  One of hte servers who seated us, knew how the food was made which was fun.  In the past, the wine buyer has steered me to very nice reasonably priced wines.  Good foods in the evening too-gastropub style."

I give this resto 5 stars for their great oyster prices and quality. But i would give it 3 for its regular dinner menu. Their portions were too small, and I didn't find it that special to be honest. My boyfriend had some sort of pasta dish, my friend and I had a fish dish. Don't get me wrong, it was good...but a bit too overpriced for what it was worth. I would go there for oysters, and oysters only."

Predominantly local produce, the food is tasty, savoury, well proportioned and decadent. You can get anything from a delicious classic burger cooked to med rare perfection, to a skewer of duck livers and beef heart on toast. Its a fun environment, their wine list is dangerously delicious, and the service is warm and efficient. I'm drooling now thinking of those burgers..."

It's a small, cozy place so it was good we made a reservation in advance for 10 people. The menu looked very limited at first glance but we all ended up happy with our orders. I got the ""Baked egg, celery root and oyster mushrooms"". It was fantastic! I would recommend it. Some friends got the ""Kedgeree"" which is something out of the usual. They claim it was very tasty but a but spicy. This brunch place doesn't have the typical eggs and pancakes. But we gave it a shot and were all pleasantly surprised. Also the service was very good. And they gave us jugs of water on the table for refills."
/user_details?userid=fNOk8VuBDz-_7iq-OZpL4g,Louis B.,"Beaconsfield, Canada",1 star rating,Very good appetizer but for the rest very disapointing. I order a pork shop that I had to return. The meat was chewy and hard but also the dish was extremely salty.  My wife complain as well on the saltiness. In my book the chef need to go back to cooking school. Frankly I do not understand all the good review. I probably caught a bad night.

With a chef, sommelière and staff that are warm and welcoming, they also have a delicious british inspired menu that oozes comfort. Their weekday 5@7 1$ oysters is a bargain for the area and their weekend brunch menu is outstanding. Should you be craving a traditional butter and sausage filled british breakfast or a fine poached trout, Lawrence is the place."

The food was incredible. I personally had the pork head, and it reminded me of southern cooking with a twist. Also you have to try the butter if your American. It's hard to explain, but it's down right amazing. The get it for the Boucher next door and we made sure before we came back to the states we would stock up on it. Overall the experience was excellent."
/user_details?userid=5Ymfsf9fAYz-Ds_p0xawVQ,Anthony K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"""Chef Marc Cohen and a few of his colleagues from Sparrow have struck out on their own, just a block or two from their former home, and it means that this stretch of St-Laurent (between St-Joseph and Bernard) now has an even deeper roster.  It also means that Cohen has an opportunity to show off his chops a little more, and that's exactly what he's done. His menu is short and sweet, but it still manages to display scope and daring, and it's loaded with tempting options (especially if you're open to all things offal). Standouts include succulent morsels of squid with samphire, skewered duck hearts with a celeriac remoulade (my pick for best appetizer in the city, at the moment), a hefty pork chop au jus with wilted radicchio and sautéed apples, and an offal ""salad"" (including kidneys, tongue, and some lovely pickled walnuts). All that plus a top-notch service team, a charming, extremely knowledgeable sommelière, and a positively killer wine list.""Since I wrote the above, things just keep getting better.  A recent visit was absolutely note-perfect, from the oysters, to the delicate bay scallops and potato galette appetizer, to the mains, which included a heaven-sent (and wonderfully herbal) pork chop and a hearty, immensely satisfying marrow bone and beef pie, to the wine (Métras Fleurie!)."

The french toast was amazing and so was the English breakfast, but I would go back for the divine chocolate and lemon doughnuts. They were heaven in my mouth. The staff was so helpful and nice and I absolutely loved the simple, yet cool design of the restaurant. The bathroom wallpaper is cool and the lights above the bar are awesome.This is a must in Montreal. I would also be interested in going there for dinner."
