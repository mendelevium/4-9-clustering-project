It is a huge place, so all the tables are very distant from each others and the place has high ceilings so it kind of gives you this feeling of a Â big space that makes you be at ease in these times of the pandemic. The service is top notch, all the personnel was super kind and friendly. I ordered a special dish called Beyti Kebab, it's like these little buttered wraps containing minced meat, it comes with this delicious best ever bulgur, yogurt, grilled tomato and green pepper. Super tasty dish, you gotta try it."
