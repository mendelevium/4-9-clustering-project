Corner Mount-Royal and The Main   I like the  chicken shawarma wrap, with garlic, hummus and hot sauce, an order of there ridiculous roasted potatoes(smothered in garlic sauce) and of course, washed down with black cherry soda. They call it a 'trio"" in Canada   This place also has a butt load of windows along the wall so it is a great place to people watch...if you're into that.wakawaka"

/user_details?userid=dfgPj43FVRnKIfxjLclqTQ,Brendan C.,"Los Angeles, CA",4 star rating,Great late night spot if you are around the Mont Royal/Saint Laurent intersection. The owner is a really nice guy who goes the extra distance to make sure every customer is happy. Great variety of salads and good prices for shawarmas.  Spécial trio is a good deal. The fries are very good.
