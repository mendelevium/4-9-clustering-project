/user_details?userid=NiZK2S0SOfSRR4P50KN98A,Meaghan P.,"Beaconsfield, Canada",5 star rating,"If I could give this place 6 stars I would. This cute little bring your own wine bistro has never failed to impress me or anyone else I know who's been. Friends of ours found this little gem while dating and reserved the whole place for their 30 person rehearsal dinner (30 people completely filled the restaurant). Since then we've been back and have never once been disappointed. The menu changes every night to have fresh, seasonable and creative Mediterranean flavours. I would tell you what I ate but I'm not sure it'll ever even be back on the menu! I've stolen bites of my friends food when we've been and I don't think there's an appetizer or main that I didn't like. The 5 course menu is very well priced and the courses will leave you satisfied. I would recommend this place for a date night, friend's night out, family dinner or group event. Honestly, just go! it's worth the visit (or a few!) Just book in advance!"
/user_details?userid=h8xK7S1xXUBP2qXW0ZPxxA,Laura R.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"This charming French bistro packs a mighty punch. There are only 9 tables or so, and it used to be a house. It's located on a residential street, away from the boisterous Mont-Royal and St-Denis streets. The menu is only in French, but the servers will happily explain every item to you in English. We were here for a birthday, and my husband and I both tried the 5 course tasting menu. Depending on your main course, it is about $55-$60/per person. It's good value for your money, given the big portions and the BYOB with no corkage fee. I started off with the salad, followed by the Asian tuna tartare (a standout!), the sorbet infused with rum, the Bison (I was not the biggest fan of this dish, but I don't think I am a Bison lover after all), and the tiramisu (a big standout). My husband loved the doree fish dish, the soup and the foie gras (for an added $13 more than the regular tasting menu).Overall, this is a solid bet if you like French food, without pretense and a nice neighborhood choice."

/user_details?userid=Yu6KOXrMsxLk-SW9t6NiSg,Tori A.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"I'm going to preface this review by saying that EVERY OTHER PASTA IS A JOKE compared to the seafood fettucine I had tonight. When my husband and I decided to go to Montreal the first thing we did was research some restaurants. After careful consideration we made a reservation at Bistro L'Entrepont. All I can say this place is one the best places I have ever eaten at. Just a side note- I consider myself to have a great palate and well travelled so It's very difficult for me to love a restaurant as much I as love this one. Upon entering the restaurant we were welcomed very warmly by Shane and he gave us all the information regarding the menu. My hubby and I decided on the the foie gras, kangaroo tartare, bison steak and, my all time favourite, the seafood fettuccine. We were first served a soup and salad which were refreshing. Afterwards, we had the foie gras and kangaroo tartare. My husband was a big fan of the tartare as it was his first time having kangaroo. After the appetizers we were given a blueberry sorbet with vodka as a palate cleanser which I have to say was a nice touch. The bison steak came out and it was juicy and flavourful. However, like I've mentioned several times the pasta was the true star of the night. Definitely come try out this place- you won't forget it. Also Big thank you to Shane and Thomas for amazing service. We will be back!"
/user_details?userid=Mt-_SvJyDirR9fpZx9dbEw,Tommy S.,"Bellevue, WA",5 star rating,"I highly recommend this cozy restaurant for an intimate and memorable experience. The service is attentive and professional. The food looks as good as it tastes. There is no corkage fee to bring your own wine.I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday on a quiet weekday night. There is nothing special about the facade of the tiny restaurant. As you enter, you realize that there is only a few tables. We were seated comfortably next to the window and began reading the menu. Options include Bison flank steak, lamb cutlets, rabbit rillette, grilled venison, duck magret, etc. We ultimately ordered the 5-course table d'hote and it was an excellent decision.Each course came swiftly and the chef even came by to present himself. Every plate was pleasant to taste and to smell. The scrumptious vegetables and succulent meats were chowed down zealously.Overall, it was an extremely pleasant and enjoyable dining experience and I would come back again."
/user_details?userid=qtgr1_fvKoMJd4t-naoGqg,Meg A.,"Moretown, VT",5 star rating,"As my husband and I picked up our glasses of red wines, freshly poured by our kind and passionate hosts, Shane and Yogan, we made up a toast on the spot, vingt et un. 21 years. Our wedding anniversary - our godamn blackjack! We made it! And there wasn't a more perfect place to celebrate all our love and our good life than at this special, intimate, love affair of a restaurant - le Bistro L'Entrepont.In walking distance of the sweet studio we have rented off Park Avenue and Mont Royal in Le Plateau, I planned our whole evening around, what I hoped to be, a romantic and delicious meal with my betrothed. He is game for most, but not all, of my culinary excursions, and after 21 years of marriage, our restaurant absolutely had to be understated, unpretentious, and yet committed to high craftsmanship and delicious bites. We can well afford a special night out, but my husband recoils at anything he considers high brow or flashy. We disagree where that line is drawn, but in the interest of appeasing the gods of marital bliss, I put my bets on my research that Bistro L'entrepont would deliver. And deliver it did. We felt appreciated for who we were and welcomed as guests, despite my elementary attempts in speaking French and our Vermont citizenship. Regardless, the menu was explained to us in English and after opting for the 5 course menus, we found ourselves by the meal's ending with scarcely much room left to finish the last bites of our buttery creme brûlée and delectably dense frozen chocolate mousse. The entire five courses were a perfect journey in tastes, textures, and presentation from the pesto escargots, their carefully curated take on the iceberg wedge and bleu cheese salad course, to our main plates featuring braised duck with homemade fettuccine and a hanger steak with a Béarnaise sauce my husband lapped up rather primordially. Our five courses were executed thoughtfully and with an attention to seasonal ingredients, brought to our table in perfect succession. The entire dining room, fitting no more than 24, more or less, was conducted as if by a maestro. Indeed, it was dining as if being played in a beautiful piece of music. We were made to feel part of the music that made the whole joint come alive and sing. A small, intimate concerto on a quiet residential street in Le Plateau. I didn't want our night to end. If you want an intimate and delicious dinner in a city saturated with dining options, be sure to plan ahead and reserve a table, and then count yourself lucky for saving a place at a table at one of the hottest restaurants in Montréal. It's BYOB, so stop at the nearby SAQ on Mont Royal Avenue for a bottle, or two, ou vingt et un. Salut!"

/user_details?userid=x9p0RQsdWD-NZuhH4J1zHw,Lina M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I recently went to this charming hidden resto located on hotel de ville in the plateau and loved the experience!! The resto is hidden away from the main plateau area but just a seven minute walk from mont royal metro station and lots of parking if you are coming by car. The resto itself is small but is super cozy and charming!  In fact, it is located in an old house which was converted into a resto so you do get that cozy homey feeling.  The resto is good for groups of max 8 people. It is perfect for date night, night out with friends, birthay or anniversary celebrations!  The service is super welcoming and friendly which made the experience delightful.  Now for the food..absolutely delicious!! They have an a la carte menu or 5 course tasting menu. I truly recommend the 5 course tasting menu. It is worth it and the portions are perfect size..not too much. We started off with the delicious cucumber salad topped with pickled carrots and fennel with dill. Next we had the tuna tartare entree which was delicious!  It had so many wonderful flavors.  An interesting raspberry vodka infused sorbet followed. For the main dish I tried the seafood fettucine in a delicious lobster bisque sauce which was absolutely mouth watering delicious!  The sauce was super tasty. Lastly for dessert, I tried the chocolate ganache served on a graham crust coverted with vanilla marshmallow and field berry coulis!  Dessert was super amazing, very original!  The presentation of the food dishes was truly impressive as well. Oh and I can't forget to mention it's a BYOW resto to top it off!!  Truly enjoyed the experience and recommend to try this resto at least once!  I will go back!!"
/user_details?userid=szJpO1kLcNHMhinBmsKwug,Gavin H.,"Boise, ID",5 star rating,"At first glance this place might not look like much, I know I was surprised walking into this tiny restaurant with hardly any tables, but as the night went on I quickly saw this would be one to remember. The only menu was a big chalk board on the wall with everything written in French but this only made the night better. The owner Shayne went through all the appetizers and entrees for us along with the other three courses. Being one of only two groups in the restaurant we really got to know Shayne and talk to him a lot throughout the night. With Shaynes help I decided to order Octopus ceviche as my appetizer and Lamb cooked three ways for my entree. The ceviche was no doubt the best I'd ever had with the octopus surprising tender and delicious. And the lamb was just as good. And since it was my grandparents 50th anniversary at the end of the night they surprised us with some great dessert. In conclusion our dinner at Bistro L'Entrepont was not only great because of the amazing food, but because of the even better service from the owner Shayne and the waiter. From doing things like buying a filet just for my grandmother to spending most of the night talking to us they made this the best dinner I've been to. At Bistro L'Entrepont you will receive the personal connection and flexibility that most high end restaurants can't give you, along with a very adventurous meal with foods you've never tried before."

Food was great and staff/owner made the dinner truly enjoyable. Small setting made for side conversation with others. Met a nice local couple next to us, and spent the evening talking while eating. Made our first night in Montreal memorable. Definitely will come here again when we are back in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=U9Pxepysr0mzVRtEa8ZYhw,Heike S.,"Palo Alto, CA",5 star rating,"Easily one of the best dinners I have had, in my life! 5 courses, each one perfect little master pieces, a world class restaurant in this nondescript neighborhood location. And a most charming and funny Monsieur Le Patron I'll definitely come again the next time I am in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=_IEbZysAVlo_y0t7hcYv0A,Bryan P.,"Sussex, NJ",5 star rating,Wow. This was our first time in Montréal and we happened to be renting an AirBnB really close by. We wouldn't have called otherwise to learn that they do actually take credit cards and they weren't fully booked despite what yelp said. We ordered a 5-course meal plus an app. Everything was AMAZING. Plus it's BYOB. Highly recommended for an intimate dinner. You will not be disappointed.
/user_details?userid=gWuBX5qQlqMBUX20Fh9JCw,Pat A.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"Our experience here was great. Shane (who you should definitely chat with at some point during the night) does an amazing job of providing whatever the patron requires without sacrificing quality or experience.The food was wonderful --The fact that we could bring our own wine was great -- But Shane made the night by being thorough, detailed, friendly, and was always himself. By the end of the night we were full and felt like we were eating at an old friend's place.Also, normally when I think of a 5 course meal I think I will leave still hungry but having eaten great food. Here I left having eaten great food and I was full. It was great."
/user_details?userid=xz5-2fSiTyAzLybdB9tU7w,Nic Q.,"North Hatley, Canada",3 star rating,"We bought a coupon and visited the establishment one very cold evening, the place dead, us and one other couple.The waiter was super friendly we could tell he enjoys what he does.We ordered the 5-course meal and felt overall it was just ok. The soup was so hot it was hard to eat and wasn't too tasty. The ris de veau was good and we also liked the lamb but didn't think much of the escargots and one of the desserts.The place has been around for a long time but I feel there are better choices out there."
/user_details?userid=p2qsU49DvbMrcG_nlejnuA,Sylvia L.,"Brooklyn, NY",5 star rating,"Drove by this tiny bistro while we were circling around for parking. Boy was I glad we stopped in to try it! Not only is it BYOB (apportez votre Vin), they have a great prix fix menu at either $38 (3 course)or $54 (5 course). Of course hubster and i decided to go for the five course. Go big or go home right?!! You won't regret it! The foie was seared to perfection. The duck I had was on point.  We were chatting with the super friendly owner for a bit and he even shared some of his fave places to hit in Montreal. We will be back for you!!"
/user_details?userid=kV2utlagzpHraWMNdEXYXA,Lexi D.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"I came here with a larger group, and the service here was incredible; we were served by the owner himself. The experience was very personable, and the staff was willing to coordinate for two vegans that were in our large group (for a five course meal, no less). We even had a chance to meet with the sous chef as well, making the experience even better, in my opinion. I would highly recommended Bistro l'Entrepont for not only its amazing food, but its incredible atmosphere!!"
/user_details?userid=GMJIoTlJS9xMjWqYgmRXKw,Alexa G.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"if you're searching for the best meal in montreal, it's right here. though Bistro l'Entrepont doesn't look like much from the outside, that's far from the truth. the restaurant is intimate, only about 25-28 seats. our waiters, thomas and shane, we're attentive, polite, and very fun to dine around. they made sure everything was cooked to perfection and that you were also having a great experience. this place is perfect for a romantic dinner. you can either dress fairly casually or formally, either way, you don't feel out of place. the restaurant is romantic, but they don't try to force that feeling. it comes naturally. the food was absolutely amazing. I highly suggest the bison for your main course. after eating my meal, I never want to eat again because it will never live up to the food there. though it's somewhat costly, it's worth it for a fantastic dinner experience. I highly, highly suggest coming here"
/user_details?userid=JabFDo9mT6zY2j6gXMT9Kg,Eric V.,"St-Malo, France",3 star rating,"Food is delicious.But this place will fail and here is why:They are trying to provide sophisticated cuisine but this caused them to get quite pricy and the outside appearance of the restaurant do not match with the pricing. ""Bistro"" in your name, white walls, simple furniture, tasteless door frame, no curtains, super quiet street, a BYOB, no playlist. All the ambiance is screaming modesty and therefore you will find it too pricy.You don't invite your girlfriend here for a fancy night and you don't spend that kind of money for a night between buddies. Lower the price at quality cost or have it redecorate.Food was delicious though."
/user_details?userid=ynPznXy7RS_3_h-NfUy-kg,Markus F.,"Palo Alto, CA",5 star rating,"Easily one of the best dinners we've had, ever. Every course of the five-course meal was a little masterpiece. In addition, the host is super nice, and the atmosphere is friendly and relaxed."
/user_details?userid=LPOUJ-4EYvlJ-Qe8l-xAGw,G R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Highly recommended.  Amazing food, the waiter on staff that evening was an absolute joy.  I had the 5 course meal, which is a great value for the price.  Serving sizes are perfect, and the veal sweet breads served over a Cesar salad was the highlight of the meal. A wonderful experience and fully intend on returning to sample more of their menu."

/user_details?userid=7soq6ooEa0HHttEv-yCu5Q,Alex S.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"My fiance and I were in Montreal for 1 night and decided to get dinner here. The restaurant is on a quiet, residential street. At first we both thought we had the wrong address; however, when you get to the front of the restaurant it is a small but very nice. There are only 9 tables here so make sure you get a reservation! They were very accommodating with ours as we switched it a few times because we got last minute tickets to the Montreal Canadiens hockey game.  We had decided to both get the 5 course tasting menu and the food was amazing! The best part of our meals were the main courses - we had the bison and the duck. I highly recommend getting either. Lastly, the chef came out to our table at the end of the meal which was super nice of him. Please keep in mind this place is BYOW - there is an SAQ nearby (only a 7 minute walk)."

However, keep in mind, to keep the food prices down, drink prices are rather high...stick to drinking water and you'll have a tasty meal for almost nothing ;) nice and cosy   atmospere with different table sizes to accomodate intimate to group sizes :)"
/user_details?userid=3pq4gYpuqmJdB5ShXGItvQ,TJ M.,"Mississauga, Canada",3 star rating,Great ambience if you are looking for a cozy place tucked in a residential neighbourhood. The entrees are exotic and a little pricey but the corkage free BYOW makes up for it. I would have given it 5 stars but the veggies were soaked in too much oil.Wait staff are great!$200 for party of 4.
/user_details?userid=zA0XjKgyldStqotUc-9bFA,Martin R.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Let's start with the good points. This is an adorable spot, very cosy and the service was incredible. In fact they tried to address everything that went wrong with the food but in a town like Montreal I'm not sure that getting subpar food can be covered up by good service. The prices are very good and you can bring your own wine which is always nice for the budget conscious option. That being said the food was not exactly the best. We had the 5 course meal and some of it was good but not fantastic. The soup was super heated and it made it difficult to enjoy. It was also seriously lacking in seasoning. I never feel the need to add salt but i had to here. The appetizers were just ok, again lacking in seasoning. The main meal was pretty solid. The Duck leg confit was very very good as were the Ris de Veau. The sides on the main were boring and plain however. Some sort of undercooked potato dish that seem undercooked and underseasoned. The desserts were just plain awful. We actually sent it back. The creme brule was so burnt it was black (not sure how that left the kitchen actually) and the sorbet was freezer burned and tasting like it. As I said they tried to address the issue by offering us more desserts (which we turned down, not exactly inspired by their food at that point) and reducing the price on our bill. Still not sure we'll be back however."
/user_details?userid=Vp_C7oIxeztbd2PchNBOHw,D A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"I've eaten my way through this entire city, from top to bottom, and think this place is probably the best French restaurant in the city, bar none. It's really small but neat, clean, classy, and very intimate. White glove service where the waiters and staff treat you like ROYALTY, respectful of your choices and delicately making suggestions to improve your experience. No matter how ghetto the wine you bring is (BYOW) they always have something positive to say about it. The food is absolutely unbelievably amazing. I can't even begin to describe it. I used to HATE French food - until I went to L'Entrepont and it turned me around completely. Anyways, enough rambling. The best, go check it out."
/user_details?userid=RS2aDOAavP-zH1u2mYrjXg,D H.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"Found this place on the travelchannel website the first night we got to Montreal during a quick weekend trip.It isn't cheap, but this splurge was a fabulous way to start our trip.  Just a few blocks from the Mont-Royal metro station, it is actually a tiny place wedged in a residential neighborhood.  There weren't more than 10 tables, and the atmosphere was very homey and intimate.  We decided to all do the 5-course option, which ranged from 48-55 bucks depending on which main course you ordered.   The meal started with a cream of vegetable soup.  Simple and boring you might think, but it was very yummy and made us all excited for what was to come.  I then had the escargots as my appetizer, and it was absolutely heavenly.  I am a big fan of escargots, and this dish reminded me why.  The blue cheese sauce it was in was subtle but delicious, and I sopped up every last drop with my bread.  Next came a palate cleanser of sorts - a scoop of green apple sorbet dropped in some brandy.  Everyone in our group LOVED this - especially as the sorbet melted in the brandy.  I had never had anything like this during a meal, so it was a really pleasant surprise.  For my main dish, I had the roasted quail, which I found to be well-seasoned in a nice wine sauce.  All the main entrees came with the same sides - a mix of seasonal vegetables.  The other entrees ordered included the duck dish, the filet mignon, and even the kangaroo (I got a bite- it was surprisingly tender and tasted sorta like beef).  Dessert was a trio of sorbets.  Although not the highlight of the meal, it was a nice and light way to end the night.The service was great here, even though there seemed to be only one waiter running the place.Another great thing about this place?  You can bring your own wine!  No corkage fee, and they'll even chill your white wine for you.   Good thing we had stopped by the NH liquor store on our way there!Highly recommended, especially if you can't get a reservation at the famed ""au pied du cochon"" or ""l'express,""..."
