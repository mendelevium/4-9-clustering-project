I loved the experience at this restaurant. The warm bread offered as an appetizer, the fried calamari as an entree was delicious. This is the second time I've had calamari that tested so good. Not saggy, well fried. I ordered the lobster Mac and cheese yum! Everything about it was amazing. I definitely recommend this place."
/user_details?userid=b39IckHDyVLVSGYhy6Sszg,Jim P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Went to Wienstein & Gavino's for a work party a few months ago.We sat on the second floor. On the first floor, there is a bar with 5a7 pricing at the time that we went. The place was somewhat crowded. My boss ordered the calamari (I think it was in the appetizer menu) for our table which I found to be delicious. The restaurant provided warm bread in what I believe was some type of olive oil dipping sauce. The bread was very good but I didn't care much for the dipping sauce.I ordered a tomato sauce pasta dish. I found it to be like any other pasta dish that I've had in other establishments. If an establishment makes a mistake or can't make a simple tomato sauce pasta dish, there is a problem. Portion size was fair for the price and location."

Was pretty empty however around 630 the restaurant started to fill.There was a special table d'hôte going on. Appetizer, main meal and dessert + coffee or tea for 25$.  Both the Appetizers we took were pretty good.  Nothing extraordinary.   I had the pappardelle pasta with smoked salmon and petoncle.  Was pretty bland even with the parmesan.  The smoked salmon was kind of fishy. However there was a lot of mini petoncle. I say mini because they were tiny!My friend had the steak which i tasted and was pretty good. Note that it's an extra 2$ for this dish.Chocolate mousse was not a mousse but a cake and the tea is the Red rose black tea. Which is not the best.Beware, portions are pretty big, so you WILL be full It is a nice restaurant for a date or with co-workers. Nothing to say on the staff, they were great!"
/user_details?userid=gwmyGLz4eBm9QiBU_Ze2KQ,Katherine A.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Ambiance (4/5): Beautiful indoor decor, dimmed lights, rustic vibes, outdoor patio, large dining area. It was a very inviting restaurant overall! Only comment was the washrooms are only located on the lower level floor, so if you're sitting upstairs you have to go all the way downstairs to access the washrooms.Service (3/5): Wait time was long. Appetizers came out quite fast, however the pastas took longer. By the time I received my pasta dish, I was already quite full and was not able to finish my meal. Note, the pasta is homemade. Waiters/waitresses were all kind and attentive to our orders and questions.Food: - (4/5) Based on my dish alone (GiGi Pasta with Gnocchi for an extra $2) it was very delicious! Quality and quality of the pasta was superb. The Gnocchi has a great texture! One of the best I've had. It was worth the wait! - (2/5) Carbonara with Fettuccine pasta was bland. It was rather disappointing and not worth the wait. I do not recommend this one specifically. Only suggestion to management is to have a faster service with the pasta. Would still come back!"
/user_details?userid=DsRVytxsQl0bj1il7WsgAg,Michelle C.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"This restaurant was recommended to me by a Montreal friend and she told me if I wanted good pasta, I should try W&G. First impression, the decor was homey and also the restaurant is really large and can fit a lot of people. The waiters were a little bit rude though but they were quick on their feet and got our orders in and out quite fast. I had the carbonara pasta and it was amazing and the pasta was al dente. The sauce is so creamy and the portion is quite big as well. Overall, I would say if you are craving Italian food, they have a wide selection for it and they also have really great specials. Definitely will return if I am in Montreal again."
/user_details?userid=y-mwVNTsWOFxRsdcvdGVlA,Marc M.,"Sainte-Thérèse, Canada",3 star rating,"Large, loud and slow! I guess this sums it up quickly. We were a group of 7 on a Monday night. We made reservations but there was room without. We were seated on the second floor, ideal for groups. While seated we walked by their open kitchen. It looked appealing as the food left for the tables. The decor is mash of old bricks and iron work. A large mixed appetizer plate was ordered that had shrimp, baby scallops, calamari, prosciutto and green salad. It was hot and flavourful. A small baguette with pesto was brought as well. The long wait began for the mains. The kitchen didn't seem to keep up. There seemed to be plenty of staff to shuttle the food over. Enough with the whining, my seafood risotto was good. The chicken parmigiana looked good and satisfied my guest. Pizza margarita seemed a little dry and it didn't look like what I'm used to. We had a hard time understanding each other. I guess the sound funnels up to the second floor and echos down from the high ceilings. Be patient, sit close to hear each other and order the pasta."

Shredded hot red peppers on the side gave the twist we wanted and everything was delicious. Accompanied with coronan and alcoholic cider - we had great dinner!"

/user_details?userid=bBzOlCXZKcwhmdITySeAhw,Valerie R.,"Laval, Canada",5 star rating,"I went there the day before Montreal marathon to get my fill of carbs. At that time I did not live in Montreal so I looked for reviews and a place that would be safe for gluten free eaters.A few of my friends had mentioned that it is a big place and good for groups and that I could be disappointed because I like more intimate places. However I really enjoyed the place and the food and also our waiter was very aware of gluten sensitivity which made my experience a great one and ensured a safe meal. Even though there were many groups that night, the restaurant is laid out on several floors and our table was not in the middle of them. I took a simple pasta dish as I was running the next day but would go back for trying other italian fares, now that, 2 years later, I live in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=2Od6rQYNvPUXQC2Go7vIqg,Catherine W.,"Littleton, MA",4 star rating,"I would give this more 3.5 stars, and rounding up due to the family friendly nature of the restaurant - easy to get a table, spacious dining room, decent food. Very nice and friendly service, accommodating to our allergy questions. We had bolognese pasta (one option was dairy/egg free), seafood risotto, and pizza. Have a nice kids' menu. Would be very comfortable for a larger family group."

Never been disappointed.Excellent service from the host to the waiter. Got bread with pesto; the pesto left me a bitter aftertaste. I got Mac N Cheese with lobster. A heavy dish due to the creaminess. The taste was average. My sister got the 1/2 chicken with salad and fries. She devoured her whole dish. Overall, it's an excellent spot for big parties. It has always has great vibe. Great choice of music in the background."

/user_details?userid=cjO0V5LnmI_bs1H4x_S65Q,Tushar C.,"Ajax, Canada",3 star rating,"I went to Montreal for a bachelor party with a big group and went to W&G for dinner. If you have a big group, this is the place for you as they can accommodate almost any size with their extensive seating across 3 levels! The food is Italian for the most part and is quite reasonably priced, given this is in the heart of downtown Montreal and the entertainment district. For dinner, I ordered their famous lasagna and it was cheese galore! I really enjoyed it. Some of my friends who are vegetarian ordered the mushroom pizza and I had a chance to try it and I would highly recommend this to anyone as well. I also tried the funghi di bosco pasta but would avoid this as it was quite bland and disappointing. Given the size of this place, the service was not the greatest so temper your expectations if you're coming on an empty stomach! Atmosphere: 5/5Service: 3/5Food: 3/5"
/user_details?userid=2TQLW0lmBLk_jVVUQ5klGA,Ella D.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,Went here when we were visiting Montreal for the weekend. The location is great. I loved the bread and pesto we got to start; I thought that was a really nice touch. I got the gnocchi with rosé sauce and I always love a good gnocchi. The service was good as well but sometimes we needed our server and he was nowhere to be found
/user_details?userid=JSZAbVVcV6QaIq3IQ9_OEg,Sara S.,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",5 star rating,"I've come here almost every time I've visited Montreal- massive portions and absolutely worthwhile for the price. Last time I shared their funghi pizza with my boyfriend which was crazy good! Mushrooms, caramelized onions, truffle oil, and cheese: literally all the best things in the world."
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",3 star rating,"Listen, the food here is quite frankly below mediocre. But when you don't know where to eat and it's a Thursday night during summer weather and want a terrace, you work with what you get. Essentially, you're paying for the vibes and views of Crescent street, not the taste or quality of the food. The portions are large but the food is ridiculously bland. The best part was the complimentary baguette with pesto!! The red sangria was good and the service was fine.I got the mushroom truffle and white wine pappardelle pasta because silly me, I've had mind blowing similar dishes at Italian restos. It was SO BLAND. Also, I love mushrooms but I don't like the ones they use - they chop them so largely that they become too slimy and chewy. The gigi sauce is better but no one was impressed.The dessert was actually disgusting. WORST tiramisu everrrr - so gummy and nasty. Just don't put it on the menu if it's that bad!!!Would I go back? Only if I wanted some sangria on a terrace. *Tip: I've been before and their pizzas are way better than their pastas."
/user_details?userid=TVnW1E3XU1fAUq_1-K9x1A,Chris P.,"Bay Shore, NY",5 star rating,Wish I found this place sooner. After 10 PM they have a $10 dollar meal deal. Started me off with a toasted baguette with olive oil and pesto. Then a massive cheeseburger with all the fixings plus coated French fries. Insanely good every last bite.
/user_details?userid=QBe3oadPKot2mtuh8jB1UQ,Gurvinder K.,"Ville-Marie, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"My husband and I used to be regulars here many years back when we were dating. We went back during Grand Prix for old times and realized how much we used enjoy this place, be it summer or winter. During summers they have 2 terraces to be enjoyed with a pitcher of their sangria (sadly for me there's no sun late afternoon). I'm picky when it comes to sangria and these ones are one of my favourites on a hot summer afternoon!Their happy hour (at the bar only) lasts from 4-8pm, 2 for 1 rail drinks and most beers as well as their house wine. At their prices you can't go wrong! It's a 2 floor restaurant right in the heart of downtown with a great evening vibe for all ages. Service is always good, except when you run into a newbie. Then again I may be biased, we were such regulars there that we had our own waiter and bartender. My favourites there are the pizzas and the basil pesto cream gnocchi! Oh and if you still have some space... their tiramisu is definitely worth trying!"
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Huge italian resto located in downtown. Came here several times. They give fresh warm bread with pesto dip as a starter which is a big plus. The portions of their plates are huge. The best dishes ive had so far is the fried calamari and the mussels. The octopus is pretty good also. Their pasta and pizza come in many varieties. U can also choose the type of pasta u want. however, their fish is a bit dry and i wouldnt recommend that. The service is pretty good. The dishes come quickly and they always come refill our bread."
/user_details?userid=VUS9-ABMF37mbHG5aMaaZw,Gabriella F.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,This place is pretty over rated. I got the mushroom pizza and my boyfriend the prosciutto pizza. They were OKAY. But not worth the price. Our entree was very good. The fresh mozzarella ball with tomatoes. Literally the best thing there was the free hot bread with olive oil and pesto. Also way too dark and loud.

I had the GiGi penne pasta and I enjoyed it. My friend also enjoyed the penne Alfredo. Calamari was also quite good considering many places have really gross calamari's.

I wasn't into drinks but they have a big wine menu and most tables had a bottle served to them.Prices are ok and staff are friendly and fun to talk to."

/user_details?userid=xqiFxfywagamNEXhQ_3xfg,Victoria W.,"Grovetown, GA",4 star rating,This place was great! They make their own pasta and both pasta dishes we had were delicious. The pesto with bread was yummy and the sangria was good (and cheap!). The building was very cool and the patio was very large. Lots of people had kids there- so it's pretty family friendly as well!
/user_details?userid=HpzMECWPO4H1fJihiMG1Pg,Lanyi L.,"Markham, Canada",3 star rating,"Great for groups! I've been to two birthday parties here and there's always lots of space upstairs. I love the bread they serve with pesto and I usually don't like pesto! I've had the steak and pasta and enjoyed both. My friends have ordered the pizza and it also looks very good. Items are on the pricier side for students, but I think it's a great place for large gatherings and special occasions; I personally wouldn't come here otherwise though because nothing here blew me away."
/user_details?userid=DRAV8ljeo40E4nhGWsXVow,Vibhor S.,"Morrisville, NC",3 star rating,"The food was not bad but nothing to die for either. Menu wise its a regular Italian restaurant with marked up prices and nothing special. The location is great. If visiting as a tourist and want to experience Rue Crescent street, you can just be seated outside and spend time enjoying the crowded street view with Italian food and wine."

The drink menu at W&G is very impressive and offered a lot of great drinks. We weren't too hungry, but decided to split a margarita pizza. It was very good- crispy and light crust, good sauce, and very meaty cheese. It wasn't too greasy which was a plus. Very good experience!"

However, I personally find the food a bit boring and bland for Italian food. I've had their lamb, different pastas and salads and nothing really blew me away. It tasted like something I could just make at home. This place is more aesthetically pleasing than it is taste-wise."
/user_details?userid=5KRlhhwhLPkOOhlISsiHZw,Wally J.,"Solana Beach, CA",5 star rating,We've come to Montreal four years now for the F1 race.  This has been our 'go to' place for dinner on Sunday night. This year we came on Friday night .  The food and service are outstanding which given how busy they are being in the middle of the downtown festivities is pretty impressive.

/user_details?userid=a3gKHarQcY61pZ9B6Ob5fg,Tanya G.,"Nashville, TN",1 star rating,Why is it ok for 2 girls to be harassed and touched and accosted at 5pm in Montreal? Get your act together #wienstein&gavinos! After repeatedly told to LEAVE US ALONE these pervents continued to harass and touch but it was just fine because they're regulars and pay '$500 a night in tips'. Really? REALLY?! Get some class! I regret not making a huge scene and getting the Montreal police in there. 2 thumbs down! It just disgusts me! Do NOT dine here. You should be shut down for allowing this kind of behaviour to happen!And please read my previous reviews. This is an honest review.

It is a clean, massive restaurant and there were a few tables filled. Service was good. Good with allergies.We started with the complimentary baguette and pesto which was delicious.We shared the Salumi plate which was okay. It had some pickled vegetables, fior de latte, Asiago, salami and a whole lot of mortadella. Generous size.We also had:Kid's pepperoni pizza which was a good sizeSeafood risotto which was loaded with tiny scallops, not much lobster. It was good.The lasagna which was good but enormous with an obscene amount of cheeseWe brought home leftovers for all of the above."

The pasta are really good and the pizza also. Don't expect to be super impressed when you only pay 13 to 20$ for pasta and pizza; for the price I was really surprised of my plate. I recommend the gigi pasta with mushrooms, prosciutto, basil and cream so so yummy. They offered me a special lasagna with a lot of vegetables. Really nice of them :) They always offer you as a starter bread with oil and balsamic. The bread is warm and fresh, it's delightful!! For you information it can get really noisy during the week end (Thursday-Friday-Saturday). Perfect place to bring some friends, for groups and family when there is less noise. Enjoy the terrace during the summer with a fresh drink or a sangria."

It's vintage and classy and has 2 floors, so there's more than enough room. Plus, in between the two floors, it seems like there's a kitchen or bar, which is pretty cool too.FOOD: Overall, the food was pretty good! For appetizers, I had fried calamari which was pretty good. Their warm bread was pretty good as well, it comes with a homemade pesto sauce. For the main meal, I had the veal with mashed potatoes and veggies and the meat was tender and juicy. I'd only come here occasionally.PRICE: Prices were a bit overpriced for the food that you're getting. If anything, I feel like I paid more for the restaurant itself and less for the food.SERVICE: The staff was nice. They did what they had to do."

They have a gluten free penne and I believe there was a GF spaghetti as well. Also was told meatballs were GF as well (just make sure they don't bring it out wit the little crispy bread garnish on it!) - got GF penne with pesto.. so good! Super full after

We needed a place to get good food, beer and most importantly THE GAME! We were worried that finding a restaurant that not only had the SEC Network but would also be okay with us compromising a table for longer than a normal dining experience would be a challenge. We found W&G and all our problems were solved! The host, bartender and waitress were incredibly accommodating and have great recommendations on food. We even chatted with the owner for a bit who was also very welcoming. We hope to be back soon!"
/user_details?userid=aNfG4yqETNKXNQgc2qTToA,Doris Z.,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",3 star rating,"It was nothing above average but the bread with pesto oil. I ordered the Montreal Table menu for $31. The bread with pesto oil was soooo good! Definitely will try that at home too. The starter was bread with fig and vinaigrette sauce. The fig was tasty but it felt like it needed more seasoning. The main dish was beef ravioli. The cream sauce was way to thick and lacked seasoning. I had to put a lot of salt on there.The dessert was some pumpkin mousse. I have never been a big fan of pumpkin so I didn't really like it either. Overall, average restaurant, I would give it a 2 star if it didn't have the bread."

Great outdoor seating there are lower and upper levels and it's a great ambiance. Staff were all very friendly and overall it was a 5+ star experience.

When we arrived, they said we had to wait 30 minutes to get an outside table. My boyfriend pointed an empty table and they agreed to let us sit there if we stayed less than 1h30. Ok... the wine was good. The food was ok. Actually, the carbonara pasta I had was ok but the squid ink pasta my boyfriend got was pretty delicious. That's why I'm giving it 3 stars."

It was less than ten minutes after ordering that we received our food- it was honestly the fastest service I have ever experienced.  Although the service was unbelievably fast, the quality of the food did not suffer because of it.  It all tasted amazing.  I ordered the RISOTTO DEL PESCATORELobster tail, shrimp, scallops, calamari, saffron, bisque and butter and Gaudy ordered the pasta GIGITomato sauce, cream, prosciutto, mushrooms, basil  I had been waiting for Gordon Ramsay to make my Risotto for the first time I ever ate it but since I knew I would wait years for that, this was a great alternative.  It was just amazing.

The food however wasn't special, they played it very safe with the dish options and the taste was rather average.

The menu is larger than what I'm normally use too. However there few disappointments as its constantly being updated.The staff is warm and hospitable. Which makes the night a pleasure for anyone. Go to the bar and be treated by the barmaids who are very easy on the eyes. Or be seated at a table and view the hard working staff. I been going here for some time now with a dear friend. I don't see that changing anytime soon.

I've come here for everything between large birthday party dinners with 15 guests to small family dinners, and every time the seating is great. No problem there. The issue with this place is the food really. First thing they serve you is the usual bread with a pesto/oregano mix for you to dip, which tastes good because the bread is warm and who doesn't love pesto. But its all downhill from there... I've been here four times and every time I leave with a terrible stomach ache. The pastas are okay, the pizzas are dry, the appetizers are tasteless, the only thing that's acceptable to eat is the osso bucco pasta. There are so many better places to eat in MTL. Maybe go there for the bar, but definitely not for the food. The hype and popularity of the place is so not worth it"
/user_details?userid=M1Xr7clDvoUSM7zSdnZplA,Timothy D.,"Brookline, NH",4 star rating,"Came here in late september with my wife and two toddlers.  We'd been cruising up and down Crescent street trying to find a good place for lunch and found the unassuming entrance to W&G.  We entered and were surprised by how large it really is -- two big floors, a massive bar on the ground floor, plenty of seating on both. It was pretty empty on the second floor, which we were required to use because we had kids with us (not a problem at all but Montreal bar and restaurant kid regulations seem to be wildly disparate and confusing).  Totally dug the atmosphere in this place -- wood beams, tasteful decor, big windows.Now if you've been cruising up and down Crescent Street for an hour with hungry gremlins in tow, you don't want to have to wait long for service.  We didn't.  Drink orders were secured promptly, then bread arrived with olive oil -- meltdown averted! The kids and I ordered pizza, the wife ordered something with salmon or a soup or a salad or something made up of all three (as she is prone to do). Food didn't take long at all.  OK, so we ordered pizza -- super adventurous right?  There was a very comprehensive menu, but hungry as we were, we went simple.  All pizza is not created equal, and this was superb -- homemade crust, crispy and chewy, a tangy marinara sauce, flavorful and fresh toppings, and just the right blend of cheeses.  Loved it.After, in order to delay our trek back out onto Crescent street, we lingered over dirty martinis (wife and I), and chocolate desserts (gremlins).  Loved it.  Oh, I forgot to mention an excellent wine list!  So there's that as well.  We enjoyed this place and will be sure to return on our next Montreal adventure."

We were only staying in Montreal a few days and I wouldn't waste one main meal on this restaurant again.  The caprese salad, which is always one of my favorites to order other places, was horrible. Very little buffalo mozzarella and hot house bland tomatoes with little balsamic and olive oil. Also, way over priced for what you get. The best part of the meal was the pastas. I got a speak, a rabbit ragu with peas. The sauce was good, but the pasta tasted like box dried pasta."
/user_details?userid=h4cduDwCH8K9LJrowoJraA,John G.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Let's be honest - the patio is a major attraction here, putting you right into the street action. The menu is pretty good, too, offering a good selection of Italian fare. Our service was very good - professional and friendly. The wine list has a good selection of Italian wines so you should be able to find something you like on the list.We started with the soup of the day - mushroom - which was excellent. Their version contained herbs to add a garden flavour to the earthiness of the mushrooms. I had the special, which was risotto with prosciutto, peas, caramelized onions and chopped hazelnuts - terrific! The combination of flavours was excellent, but the one drawback was the risotto was a little too dry, it was almost a pilaf. My friend had the veal chop special which was also very good, nicely flavoured, but once again, cooked a little too long.For dessert, he had the almond and rum brownie with ice cream. While very tasty, the brownie was so hard he actually bent the spoon trying to cut it.Nice place, I would consider coming back again, especially for the patio."

/user_details?userid=nHjRBSbzPeqdq5_D3AirEg,Patricia C.,"Hampstead, Canada",3 star rating,"I have a very mixed review about this place. While this wasnt my favourite , I also didnt hate it. So first off, this location is huge, it has two floors and is perfect for large groups (just make sure you reserve in advance as it does get very busy). The decor inside is rustic but nice and comfortable/clean. The prices are very cheap as well , and you get very big portions for your money. They serve italian food like pizza, pasta , risotto as well as a variety of starters and they have a wide variety of alcohol and cocktails. My issue was with the quality of the food , while it wasnt horrible , there was really nothing about it that stood out, it was very bland/ordinary. I ordered a Lobster Mac & Cheese which is usually one of my all time favourite things , but this one just fell flat. There was barely , and i do mean BARELY any lobster inside and the mac&cheese was super creamy but the cheese inside really had no taste and the noodles were overdone. Another person at our table had the risotto and had the same thing to say about it , just very bland and overdone.  However, someone at the table did order pizza and they seemed to be happy with it , so im thinking pizza is the safer bet when coming here. Their cocktails were pretty good all around though , so that was a plus. However, Ive been here twice and the first time our server was great , she was friendly and handled our group very well , she didnt miss a beat and made sure we all had what we needed. However, the second time I came here the server we had couldnt even be bothered to smile and kind of seemed annoyed just to be there. So service seems to be hit or miss. One thing I did enjoy was that they start you off with free fresh warm . baguette that comes with a delicious pesto dip (and they keep it coming !)  All that being said , I wouldnt be opposed to coming back here again if I were invited but it wouldnt be my first pick for dinner. Maybe I would recommend it more for drinks and snacks."

The reason i gave it 4/5 was because i felt the seating was a bit odd -- they have two floors and we were seated upstairs when half the first floor was empty which made our waitress take a bit longer between trips. The grilled calamari and chicken parm were great generous portions as well as delicious. Highly recommend for brunch able to accommodate parties of all sizes."

I ordered pizza with sangria- both were delicious. Portion sizes are quite decent too. Overall great experience, -1 star because the dessert wasn't up to par with the main course.

When we first entered we were a little confused on where to sit.The bottom floor has a lounge vibe, the middle floor seems to be the loudest with the kitchen in view, and the top floor has a great amount of seating with a nice view of crescent street. We opted for the top floor.First and for most this is not a spot for an intimate date. It is quite loud and difficult to have a conversation even with the people at your table. We all enjoyed the complimentary bread with oil & pesto. It certainly came in handy because we did have to wait quite a bit for our food, which is most likely due to how large the restaurant is. I order the caprina pizza (I believe) and was impressed! I also liked their mojitos as I ended up having three! As for service it was mediocre. Not horrible but not great.I would recommend if you're going in a larger group looking for a good time and don't mind waiting longer then average for your food."
/user_details?userid=ol6v1oKA62i-eBrO2UbVZg,Maria V.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Weinstein & Gavinos was a true disappointment during our lunch. Which took me by surprise, considering I've been eating there for the last ten years. Our lunch was such a disappointment, that could easily been avoided. Did they change owners? Chefs? If they did. The poor quality showed in our meals. The hostess, was polite but little to no enthusiasm. Our waiter.. Poor service. He did not speak clear, was often in a rush(the restaurant had only  six tables with average of 2-3 people per table. This is at 12:30pm, while the restaurant has well over 20 tables. My steak salad was simply unacceptable! The steak was incredibly salty, over cooked, dried and tough! Did not taste fresh at all. I understand meat is not their specialty, but if you put it on your limited lunch menu. Learn how to properly cook it please! Due to my poorly lack of taste salad, I was offer to choose something else on the menu instead. Which I did. I choose a Caesar salad. Which I've been informed of being delicious. I guess not! It was a simple mix of lettuce, a few overly salty croutons with two Parmesan shavings. While all this was drenched in a store bought overpowering taste of garlic salad dressing. I chose to add mozzarella Fior di latte(Fresh mozzarella) $5.00 for just two slices?!  May I add that my meal included a vegetable and barley soup. Thank you for the generous amounts of vegetables. Yet I again did not appreciate how salty it was! Salty should be used to bring out the flavour of something, not to make it taste simply like salt. Again something as simple as soup, was disappointing! My friend's salad which was suppose to have mixed greens, oranges etc. It had very little of everything and freshness was not there at all either. Did they use a mix of greens that come in a bag already premix?! In every salad, freshness and taste is key! It simply was not there.Yes, the cost of my meal was taken care by the restaurant. Great! Thank you. Yet, where is the apology from the waiter? Who simply took the dish away. Disappointing yet again.Yes, the tip we left was low, when the bill was only $12.00. The waiter never said thank you or goodbye upon my friend and I leaving the restaurant. What happen to manners? Sad that our lunch was this disappointing. Next time, I will think twice of going back."

I had a risotto that had quite the deep dish and my companions had the mix_n_match pasta and sauce dishes. Everything was quite good. Server forgot my soup but I was really full and nearly forgot myself. It was only okay but the bread was excellent too. Will return.

The staff was very friendly, there was an excellent bar selection including wine list, and the pasta & pizza were excellent made with fresh ingredients. The atmosphere and clientele we're professional and sophisticated.There was one HUGE drawback in what would have been a perfect moderately priced casual bistro; the noise. We had to scream at one another in order to communicate. The noise was so intense the waitress got one of our orders wrong as she could barely hear the order. She profusely apologized. Furthermore, she stated that noise was a common complaint. Not since attending a One Republic concert in a domed stadium have I experienced such deafening noise. There is club music playing in the background that if it was turned 10db lower it would be appropriate. However, people have to yell over the beats which creates a building escalated volume with horrible acoustics. After having my ears ring and a horse throat from screaming, we cut the experience short. It's a shame as the restaurant has a great formula for success that is ruined by what I consider to be a serious risk to permanent hearing loss."

To frame it up, came here for a work dinner this evening, I didn't pick the place and actually showed up about 15 min late so by the time I arrived everyone had a drink and had ordered already. No worries, I take a min and order a drink and my food but from there everything starts to go downhill pretty quick. To sum up:- I immediately notice a coworker who ordered a Negroni get his drink and it wasn't even 3/4 full in a rocks glass, plenty of ice though, ok whatever.- I ordered the Osso Bucco when I showed up late, yet somehow was the very first one to get their food, yet someone who ordered a salad funny enough ended up getting his food halfway into my own meal...- Which I must say, was quite the chore. This was BY FAR the toughest tasting veal shank I've ever tasted. Nothing fell off the bone, not a single bite was what you'd consider tender. To put simply, it was dry as sand and was like chewing on leather. My jaw legit ached after eating it. If it wasn't for the fact that I was pretty hungry and the sauce was a tiny redeemer I would've given up after a few bites. This thing easily should've been in the slow cooker for at least another 4 hrs, terrible for something that's 28CAD and on the higher end of the menu.- My own drink (an old fashioned) came out only 3/4 full as well, yet was piled to the brim with ice, at least it was decently stiff. - My coworkers 2nd and 3rd orders of Negroni came out EVEN LESS that before, we're talking barely half a rocks glass full, with a ton of ice piled in.- I had to ask 2 different ppl 3 times to get a glass of water.- After we got our food and the waitress came around exactly once to ask if anyone wanted drinks (at which point completely ignoring I had no more water left), she never came around again other than to take dishes and run off. Never even had a chance to get another drink, which I guess in a way is a blessing in disguise based on what we'd witnessed.Incredibly disappointing and for a downtown area chock full of restaurants you can be damned sure I'm passing this one by in the future."

We ordered veal parmesan and rib eye steak as our main course. The veal was accompanied with a spaghetti pesto  topped with pine nuts. It melted in your mouth the only flaw  was it was a bit too salty for my taste. The steak was accomabied with a side salad and fries. It also raste amazing but again a bit salty for our taste.

After ordering our entrees, 5 minutes tops, I asked if I could change my pasta option for my entree and was told he would check, 10 minutes later he came back and said no can do. I'm very familiar with the restaurant business so this alone would not have been a count against the service but was still surprised how long it took him to check. Our entree came and my daughter asked for more bread, he nodded and we waited for bread for the entire time. No mention that there was a table limit or he couldn't do it. We waited with our finished entrees for a good 15 minutes (no sight of the waiter despite a now filled patio) had to wave him down and then waited another 5 minutes at least. When he came with the check he cleaned our table with a dirty rag left the rag there and tended to another table and then came back to us to take care of our bill, leaving the dirty rag the entire time. As we were walking out we saw the manager, who had come out multiples times seeing impatient tables and did nothing, and told him our service was poor. He said it must have been a mistake and our server was the best they had, no apology and basically shooed us out and told us he didn't care.Lastly, the food was mediocre at best.

It's decorated beautifully, the interior architecture is really nice, pretty exposed stone walls and nice dim lighting, and everyone who works here is sooo nice. Also (and I'm sure people will hate me for saying this but...) the place feels like you're in Toronto.For starters, the pesto oil that they bring out with the bread before you order food, is very tasty and fresh. We ordered the paesana pizza and the duck confit risotto, and the tiramisu. The pizza was really good, and for a bigger contemporary style restaurant like this, it's still impressively authentic (thin crust Napoli style stone oven pizza)... The duck confit risotto was incredible. There were big chunks of duck confit in it and it wasn't fatty at all but perfectly rich and delicious and the duck confit flavour was really infused into the perfectly cooked risotto - the best risotto I've had in this city yet. I will definitely be looking forward to the next visit here to order it again - and for duck confit risotto it was very reasonably priced, I want to say cheap even, but let's just say, you can't go wrong if you order this dish.The tiramisu was pretty good, but not authentic at all - but I'm very picky when it comes to tiramisu, and for me it was too thick/heavy.. It seems like the mascarpone cream was either mixed with a butter cream type of icing because it was very thick and very sweet but I still liked it - I wouldn't order it again though unless I was really craving it and didn't feel like making it myself. We will definitely return for the pizza and I can't wait to go back for the risotto. I highly recommend this place for date night or a huge birthday party. Just go!"

We all laughed and for him to come in the photo.)
/user_details?userid=hTZb1INhnCG8URaFywVoYQ,Alina M.,"Markham, Canada",3 star rating,"We visited on a Friday evening at around 7pm and this place looked filled - at least the terrace was. Inside though, there are 3 floors: not too many seats on the ground floor, but plenty on the 2nd and 3rd. The 2nd floor features a very good view of the kitchen, which is pretty cool, but can be pretty noisy and hot. The music seemed very loud on the ground floor, but on the 3rd floor, it was much quieter and easier to hold a conversation up there. They have an extensive drink list and a far smaller food menu. Their bread comes with pesto oil which is pretty neat. The soup of the day was a cream of asparagus and I do believe that in their stations, each one has bread, Parmesan cheese, pesto oil, salt and pepper, as well as the daily soup. Considering there are 3 floors to the establishment, I guess this is a way to speed things up. Our seat was wonderful, by the window, so that there was a breeze and some natural light streaming in. Service was okay, our server came by to check on us once and was fairly polite. Prices are relatively reasonable given that this area is slightly touristy. Even when we left at around 8:30pm, there were still plenty of tables, so I wouldn't say they get completely filled to capacity, given that they do have 3 floors of seating."

While their risotto is fantastic (not too creamy), their steak was gummy and the majority of it was inedible fat. Veggies and potatoes were very good but let's be real, that will never make up for a bad steak. Their desserts are overpriced and way too small (not the delicacy type tiny). The waiters/waitresses were extremely rude, water was not refilled and they didn't bother to come check up on their clients. Given the great downtown location & trendy look, I gave it two stars but...save your money."

We actually canceled our dinner reservations at a very high end restaurant and opted to come here instead for some down to earth food. The restaurant is gigantic and we didn't have to wait to be seated. We enjoyed the free hot bread and pesto/olive oil dip along with a Caesar salad, caprese salad, osso bucco, spaghetti carbonara, and fettuccine with vodka sauce.

I am so happy to have found this gem in the great city of Montreal--a city with more good restaurants per square foot than most cities in the US--mind you,I love explore and try new places very much--But I look forward to my next visit to W&G's.  It was a Friday evening and the music in the bar was extremely loud--The hostess seated us downstairs not far from the bar. We immediately said it was just too loud to eat, let alone talk at all. We got up to leave and told the water server why we were going. He said to wait, took us up front to the hostess and told her to give us Table 10--apparently a quieter spot. We were ushered upstairs and around a corner--The place is huge--and to a dining area from which the noise and music of the bar was distant and faint. Thank goodness--They almost lost us, and we wouldn't have had that wonderful meal!As soon as we sat down, the waiter brought warm Italian bread with pesto snd olive oil for dipping. So so so good!  We are vegetarians, and my husband and I shared a bruschetta, which was very good, presented in an unorthodox fashion--all piled up high on the toasted bread. It was delicious. For entrees, he had cheese tortellini in a wine and cream sauce, which he loved, and I had a pasta dish with pesto, pine nuts and goat cheese. The plates have very wide rims and a deep bowl which isn't all that wide -- at first glance you think it's one of those tiny portions that some restaurants serve.

He ignored me when I called to him and only raised his hand to acknowledge my call the second time around, without turning his head. When we were paying, he left the credit card machine with us, so we had to tear our own receipt, while he chatted with a larger group.There was not one smile. No introduction. No request for drinks. The food  left us desiring as well. Monotone tub of gnocchi. Pasta with meat sauce, fries and the calamari were good. Bruschetta was freshly made but just didn't have anything to it. Bread was cold but we were so hungry, bread dipped in evoo and pesto was good. The server experience really ruined our first night in montreal for that trip. I have been here many years ago and was hoping for the same fun night out but I guess things change."

(what a french baguette should be- crusty on the outside, but warm & soft on the inside).  We munched on that... I waited forever for my glass of wine... which wouldn't have been a big deal, except I'm normally gluten free, so this huge hunk of delicious bread sitting in front of me, taunting me... not a good thing.  Normally, I'm fine watching people around me eating delicious food that I don't.. but that's when I'm drinking.  So, yeah...My salad came- flavorless & oil-covered.  I would have loved some pepper... was never asked.  Food came, and it was pretty good.  Had one of the specials, risotto, and I definitely enjoyed it.  It was way more food than I could finish.  He had the chicken ripieno- instead of it being filled, the filling was just on top... but he enjoyed it.  Misleading name.Despite neither of us being able to finish our entrees, we did order the tiramisu for desert.  It was good, but not life changing (as described to one of the tables around us).  Overall, food was good, but definitely over-priced.Even though our actual waiter wasn't particularly attentive or nice, the girl who brought most of our food to us was quite friendly.  I hope he tips her well... she definitely makes up for his lack of service.The music here is WAAAAAY too loud for a restaurant... and it's too clubby.  This place was confusing... seemed conflicted.  Are we a nice restaurant or a club?One plus- There was a hilarious drunk woman in a super short dress who loved dancing... so even though we were just sitting there a lot, we were entertained."

Because of this, I was a bit hesitant to enter (as you can imagine this place was a big hot mess), however thanks to my ""seriously snotty about food"" friend we entered at our own risk. And let me just say, I had a pretty damn good time! We made an attempt to sit at the bar and moved several times because of the unbelievably loud sound system blasting dance music. For a second i thought the entire place was going to be lifted up on hydraulics! Once we settled we had a few ordinary drinks which were fine, but free shots were great! Once we had enough of the nightclub/bar/lounge, we decided to stay for al fresco dining. This was a dream to my ears as it was outside and away from the noise. We had the Osso Buco over buttery pasta (excellent, although I thought the pasta was a bit overcooked) and Mussels in curry broth (good, although not hot enough for me).

I have a wheat allergy - however any discomfort resulting in the following week from this pizza were well worth it.Our server was attentive without being annoying and socialized with us a bit, but not inappropriately he still tended to his other tables.

We arrived and was able to get a good spot at the bar and ordered our drinks (me a glass of wine and he a glass of Jack & Diet Coke) and the Jack was very jacked up - which many would consider a good thing if you wanted lots and lots of alcohol. We had pleasant company with a local who was there that night enjoying a drink and chatting up the bartender who also hooked us up with a free shots and we knew if we sat there, we'd get more free shots. There is a pasta factory in the back and you can see into the kitchen if you sat upstairs. The sound system was a bit loud and we ended up having dinner outside in the front. It was raining but they have a canopy set up so that you have the option of sitting outside without getting wet. It was a Friday evening between 10 - midnight that we were there. We ordered the Osso Bucco over buttered spaghetti and the Steamed Mussels in Curry broth as our starter. We felt the portions were big enough to share which we were right. They also bring you out a fresh warm baguette to dip in pesto and Olive Oil. Overall, our experience was surprisingly pleasant and our bill with 1 main, 1 appetizer and two drinks totalled $50. The only drawback is, that if you're not a smoker, understand that sitting outside will subject you to other people smoking."

He was very friendly and he helped me decide which wine to choose by giving us samples to try. He brought an unbelievably good pesto to the table for dipping with some bread. The pesto was so authentic and good that we ate it up, in what seemed like, a split second. Henry said, not to worry, he would keep it coming. All three of us enjoyed our entrees. They were large tasty servings. When we finished the meal and on our way out of the restaurant we were greeted Joel, the manager. He was very friendly and funny, and asked if we enjoyed our meals. We told him that the pesto and entrees were delicious. We chatted with him and had a few laughs. We would definitely return to this restaurant for the excellent service, food and atmosphere."

I got linguini with ragu sauce- no complaints but no surprises. The only positive I can say was they messed up our order of calamari and gave us a large when we asked for a small, so that made up for the other stuff a little bit.I couldn't tell what type of restuarant it was from the outside, but I decided it is ""wannabe upscale italian bistro"""

Out of all the restos we saw even still open (it was the first weekend of the year) Wienstein & Gavino's had the brightest lights and looked the most inviting. Although I did find the name bizarre. We got a table no problem, (duh, late Sunday night) and sat upstairs, but for a cold night, there were still plenty of people there, mostly couples on dates and a slightly older crowd (35-40+)The food was delicious! We started with the bruschetta, and there was plenty of warm carbs being placed on our table and a self-serve balsamic vinegar and olive oil to accompany it. My boss enjoyed her pasta dish, as well as I enjoyed my penne with garlic and veggies. The taste was very fresh, since I am not a huge pasta fan, but I really liked my dinner. The service was impeccable too. Afterwards, we enjoyed a glass of wine at the bar and the bartender was flirty, but nice and I could tell wanted to chit chat with us. It was an overall very pleasant environment, service and food!"

/user_details?userid=KYV3TpJiJB2LGN9umfmsHg,Shirley D.,"Toronto, Canada",2 star rating,"I'm not a huge fan of big restaurants because they tend to produce lower quality food since there are so much staff involved. That' s just my opinion. Wienstein and Gavino's is REALLY huge....two floors with a HUGE kitchen! I came here for a friend's birthday yesterday and I was not impressed. My pasta was overwhelmed with sauce...i ordered a prosciutto, mushroom linguini. And there was too much sauce! It was heavy, it made me sleepy and too full too fast. Pasta is not meant to be drenched in sauce, you are supposed to taste the sauce AND the pasta. I hardly tasted the pasta but more the sauce. My boyfriend's pizza was very generic. Just plain with cheese and tomatoes...nothing special. Don't get me wrong, service was very attentive and decent, but food just didn't impress me. I didn't like the atmosphere as well...it was too noisy and I had to yell so many times to talk to someone who was even next to me. It was more of a bar atmosphere. I dont mind that but I don't like to eat dinner in that kind of atmosphere. Don't think I would go again."

/user_details?userid=zgqi7Ryo7L5VTKonEVkRwQ,L C.,"Beverly Hills, CA",2 star rating,"The place could have changed but my memory of it was of flavorless food surrounded by tasteless people with flashy gold jewelry (I'm talking the guys here...the girls were a little too brassy blonde). Maybe the place has changed though...I'm only giving it two stars because maybe it has gotten better but Crescent St was always...well if you can't say anything nice. For good food and a great time, there are a gagillion better places than here like L'Academie on St.Denis."
