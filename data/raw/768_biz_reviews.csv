It is served with bok choy but you can also add some grilled chicken for extra. You get a decent amount of food. The sauce is a little bit spicy but I think it can be a bit spicier: good thing is they have sriracha sauce that you can add yourself. I also tried their papaya salad. To be honest it's a hit or miss depending of the day. Some days it's great and others it can be too vinaigrery or too watery. Their buns are delicious!Super friendly staffs, always smiling and helpful.Overall, great little place to eat if you don't like hospital food."

They are menu is fusion between Singaporean, Malaysian and Indian as they state. I have been to those countries, so I didn't find their food mimicked the way it should.Recently, they expanded their menu. They even have breakfast menu. I got some bao buns with tempeh; super delicious. On the side, I took the papaya salad; it is certainly zingy. The service is super friendly, but it is kind of slow to receive the food for a fast food type a place, but at the same time they are preparing our food on the spot with every right amount spices... so perfection takes extra minutes, therefore the patience is a must."

My review is for Satay Brothers:This was a quick pick-up stop for a non-fast food meal. This place is nothing like the original Satay Brothers site on Notre-Dame (that is magnificent).  The menu has a variety of simple selections, and a sampling menu you can have for a 15$ combo (including tax-comes with a beef, veg or pork curry with rice, a soup and a drink). The food was served warm- My main course was a pork curry that was really spicy- but balanced out with basmati rice. The soup was a little bland with dumplings, the lemonade was super refreshing.Not up to my original Satay brothers standards but no complaints for  food in a hospital cantine :D"

If you're looking for flavorful food at the RVH, this is for you! They offer many different options ranging from curries to poke bowls. I've tried different dishes and found them tasty but not too filling. The tapioca coconut pudding is perfect! Overall, great food but slightly overpriced for the portion size."

The cafeteria is right beside it, but honestly you wouldn't be able to stand the bland food all the time, albeit cheaper. Had both their chicken adobo and vermicelli on separate occasions. The peanut sauce on the vermicelli was amazing, but overpowering so the whole dish tasted all the same. The adobo also tasted pretty uniform throughout. Still delicious though. The owner let me try a variety of items before I chose what to get, he was super friendly! They also have interesting desserts like pandan cake and other snacks. It's much pricier than the meals at the cafeteria, so I guess I'd only come here as a treat."
