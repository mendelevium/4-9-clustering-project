/user_details?userid=FV8c92d1miafw4jLliNQOA,Margi V.,"Buffalo, NY",5 star rating,"Service was great, so friendly!! Accommodating to tweaks to their menu items, and when they realized we were ordering two crepes and splitting them our server offered to plate them half and half! Plating was beautiful and came with fresh fruit on the side.The crepes were very good we had the Verona and the Cinnaworks (but added chocolate sauce). The Verona was our favorite the mascarpone filling really makes it. It was also very good drizzled with maple syrup.We were even given a treat as a bonus to take home as we left! Had a lovely conversation on the way out, can easily tell they really take pride in and love what they do. Great place, great atmosphere, can't wait to go back."
/user_details?userid=DjK6d99XivQTyw-bFn1rkA,Katie S.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,"This is a must if you are staying in or near the Village! First, the service is excellent. I believe the owner is who helped us and he was fabulous. Second, the food is wonderful. In fact, I wish we would have found this place sooner into our stay. We came for breakfast and I had the chocochips crepe. It was absolutely divine."
/user_details?userid=iLjMdZi0Tm7DQxX1C1_2dg,Ruggy J.,"Manhattan, NY",4 star rating,"On a recent trip to Montreal and after encountering long line after long line for brunch, En Couleur was a welcome relief. Available seating, friendly service, and some some approachable fare that mostly revolves around crepes. You can certainly get other items--it's got a diner vibe going on--but crepes are what people crave here.I went with the salmon and cream cheese crepe, and while I've had that combo on several bagels over the years, never have I had one wrapped in crepe form. A large portion that was impossible eat in one sitting, and all of the great flavor of the New York classic with a Quebec twist. I'd certainly order this again if I were in town and looking for a quick bite. It's relatively low on frills and not by any stretch a scene. If that's what you're in the mood for, look no further."
/user_details?userid=ltFfQVHRXsxS_nf63wJU_w,Lyna L.,"Leesburg, VA",5 star rating,"THIS PLACE WAS HERE FOR US WHEN NO ONE ELSE WAS  My friends and I walked to three different places around midnight, and all of them had closed prior to their posted closing time! We walked a bit to get here, but it was entirely worth it. Juan was so patient and accommodating, and the crepes (Chocochip and Italiana) were absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. Juan was nice enough to even put mangos in our Italiana, per our request! It was a super chill environment with a homey feel; there's a sense of comfort even if you're unfamiliar to Montréal."
/user_details?userid=sVRHZ_6tDOQffgQ5ruYsVQ,H H.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"We ordered cinawork(see pictures, the one with lots of peaches) and Italian (??, not too sure if that the name on the menu). Cinawork crepe: pink crepe, lots of peaches (which I like). Not too heavy on the whip cream. Delicious and not too heavy.Italian: I ate 1/4 of the servings in the picture. Very chocolate tasting. Quite heavy for me at 10am."
/user_details?userid=m_gAkI2spr3uw0SG9-RliA,Gabriela S.,"San Antonio, TX",4 star rating,"Sunday morning. All the fruits. Paired with crepes, whipped cream, maple syrup, toasts, breakfast meats, eggs. It's a feast. An indulgent feast and our party adored it. I would definitely recommend for a filling Sunday morning meal. Crepes are a bit thicker than what I'm used to, but that didn't take away from the meal."
/user_details?userid=FK5NmWjFXJHP-xn4E4PU1w,Sydney J.,"North Olmsted, OH",5 star rating,"If you would like a crêpe in Montreal, this is the spot. We ordered sweet crêpes and the local berries and fruits were unlike anything we've tasted. Our crêpes were large, filling, and beautiful to look at. The man who runs the crêperie is a pleasure to talk to, also. When you go, write a message on the wall! We loved seeing the messages from previous diners while waiting for our delicious crêpes."

/user_details?userid=LNJGzUQhPH1uQlES09-QoQ,Garth H.,"San Jose, CA",5 star rating,It doesn't look like much from the outside but don't pass it by. I had the Village savory crape & my wife had a fruit laden sweet crape plus a spinich salad. Portion sizes are generous so consider splitting with your friends. This place is a gem. Just a block off St. Catherine but so worth the slight detour.
/user_details?userid=BLLoMLmRy7fhtB6TLZFW7Q,Katya O.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,Can't wait to come back to Montreal and have brunch at EnCouleur!!! The employees are super nice and the breakfast potatoes are to die for. I am quite a picky person and i've been disappointed many times before - but this place is very attentive to my requests and demands! Thumbs up! 5 stars
/user_details?userid=fyKE7nk3tBpiU1-HZ-IvCA,Norman N.,"Charlotte, NC",5 star rating,"After waiting in a nonmoving line at another restaurant, I walked around the corner and found an immediate seat here. Incredible Beef Wellington! The service was super- friendly and helpful. Loved the atmosphere. Being new to Montreal, I was unaware of BYOW (Bring Your Own Wine). It didn't hamper my experience, though."

It's  no longer  just a pancake  place it used  it be.  I was dry  after  partying  hard  on a Saturday  and  attacked  Pastries  and Oranges.  My friends  went  more into  meet.  For someone  like  me that  spend  most  of my time  in the  village,  the place  is well  situated  and now  offers  large  variety of food."
/user_details?userid=8Xpald6zq_Ttps83MiWcog,Madi B.,"Saint-Lambert, Canada",1 star rating,"Food was cold and didn't taste like much, my five dollar ""cherry smoothie"" ended up being a watered down mango slush, took over an hour to be delivered and the delivery man was incredibly rude and crassHave never been so disappointed by breakfast potatoes"
/user_details?userid=IS85ZoawxOBqFJRZWcsnog,Justin P.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,"The owner was super fun and nice. He was telling me how he started the place and trying to make it more popular. The crepes here are AMAZING. When I received mine, I was surprised at the portion and how beautiful the presentation was (even better then most fancy restaurants). The place itself is kinda a home in the wall rough place, but the owner and the food is what makes this homely. He's definitely a master chef bringing true French and European cuisine to Montreal. On top of that, they serve Illy coffee, which was the best coffee I had during my stay there.  Brewed to perfection. I will definitely come back next time I'm in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=jhGpIAQ4KbzCWl5X02_klw,Alyssa L.,"Reading, MA",5 star rating,Very good food. We left stuffed and happy. We got garlic fingers and a savory crepe with donair meat.
/user_details?userid=EoXL4yIwXFDFVkY65JXwoQ,Kathryn D.,"Newport, RI",5 star rating,"I LOVED this place. Nicolas was so attentive as the only server in the place (it's small so only one was necessary) but even with a few tables he was so great! Very helpful and understanding of our non french speaking. We came back a second time in our 4 day trip because the crepes were so excellent. Almost 60 different types of crepes both salty and sweet. Also, an entire page of about 15 types of eggs Benedict. Not to mention the whole place is covered in chalk boards which is so interesting to see where all the customers have come from! When paying the bill, Nicolas even gave us little chocolate marshmallow cookies to sample and they were AMAZING. I got the ""Mexico City"" crepe, and it was HUGE. Ate it for breakfast and then finished it for lunch. Outstanding. Thank you!!!"

Food was phenomenal and all the food was crazy fresh (literally went across the street once we got their to get us fresh strawberries) . Service was amazing, Jessica and John were so nice and went out of their way to make sure our meal was perfect. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND EN COULEUR!!"
/user_details?userid=504BIVMoR2AGjfyAu0LHOw,Erin T.,"Oakville, Canada",5 star rating,"We came here for breakfast and the look of the place looks beat up and dirty.The view we had was right next to the kitchen, which it is interesting because you can personally see what the chef/server is doing on the spot. What was also interesting was that the chef started chatting with us with what he put in the egg to give the color and the flavor. By this, you can tell that he knows what he's doing in the kitchen. He was very kind and the service was on point. The fruit I got tasted rotten, which if that didn't happen, my experience here would be 100%."
/user_details?userid=BzeorK2_gzpN0TjaelO1Vw,Greg T.,"Skanee, MI",5 star rating,Jessica and John are AWESOME!   We are from Texas and have really enjoyed Montreal's food seen.  But the service and food at En Couleur is the best of the trip!   Jessica's explanations and service was off the charts.  Best whip cream I've ever had.  Best breakfast/brunch me and Family have ever had.
/user_details?userid=d4R7bh6TJlIwP0BJ87SkdA,Mayuri B.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,One of the best little restos in Montreal and definitely has the best French Toast I have ever had. The owners and the chef of this place were really kind and the preparations are always unique and thoughtful.The grand serving of French toasts for 12 dollars or crepes for 7 are super cheap and yet would beat the best of the cafes.The chef is also a skydiving enthusiast if you are looking for exchanging stories.

Both very big portions and everything was so delicious! Also had a latte which was probably the best one I've ever had! Definitely a revisit!"
/user_details?userid=_OkEXLN_5T9cMc3UFrLT9A,Lily A.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Amazing experience in this little resto just a short walk from our home in the village!Service is super friendly and food is very reasonably priced for the portion. Not to mention that the food is great! I had the ""Boris"" crepe with spinach, egg and feta. It wasn't the best crepes I've had in Montreal but it was filling, satisfying, and delicious. The BF had an egg sandwich with home fries and loved it. Our meals came to about $20 altogether !The coffee there is great! And John, our server basically made our experience top notch. He says he has his German Shepard in some times so look out for her!We'll be back for lunch and dinner :)"

One of the best  crêpes in town.  On  negative  side,  the place  lacks  class  and the  air conditioning wasn't  working... So,  it was really  hot in there."

/user_details?userid=fRj7a9fGr8yaKrTy4Dwtyw,Mira B.,"Guelph, Canada",5 star rating,"All I wanted was an iced coffee and this place came up in a quick search. I am SO GLAD it did!The place was being fitted for a brand new air conditioner as we sat there so by the time you go, it will probably be up and running. The place is very friendly and modest, with one of the nicest servers I have ever met getting us settled and served.I asked for an iced coffee, but made with milk and sweet if possible. He smiled and said it would be the ""best I've ever had"". I kid you not, it was legitimately the BEST iced coffee I have ever had. I don't know what exactly he did to make it so, but it was clearly made with love.As other customers came in, he greeted them with equal amounts of warmth and we watched as he served up one of the nicest looking crepes I have ever seen.Very much worth a stop in, even if just for a magical iced coffee."

/user_details?userid=Tjoh84PHz6pK87jnkvYrtw,Cc X.,"Mississauga, Canada",5 star rating,The crepes are perfectly done! I can't decide between options because they look equally awesome. The owner was so nice to offer to do it half and half! Their saltiness popped out from the bacon pieces in your mouth brings up the taste to another level. I also love their potatoes that comes with the omelette. It was seared on one side and the crispy perfectly contracts the soft boiled potatoe which makes you feel every bite is complete.
/user_details?userid=KZbp-ZUbN2faaIqG7v5-mw,Joseph C.,"Arlington, MA",1 star rating,"Something must have changed here. This was one of the worst dining experiences ever. We should have been forewarned by the lack of a dinner menu. We should have been wary when we were the only patrons on a Friday night. A caution flag should have gone up when the tea list bore no relationship to the inventory and when we saw the badly spotted glassware and cutlery. But we plowed on, lulled by the offer of a free bowl of spinach soup, which I admit was fine and held me over for the 45 minutes (!!!) or so it took for our pizza and crepe to be prepared. (Did I mention we were the only ones?) We were warned that there was an order ahead of us... We really should have been ticked off when -- after all that time -- the wrong kind of crepe was served. The waiter did remove my burned ham and cheese crepe (along with the fork, that was never replaced). He replaced it with a spinach and cheese crepe that contained a few baby spinach leaves and about a block of cream cheese (!?!?). It was only possible to eat half without the arteries blocking up immediately. The piece de resistance was the pizza, though. The waiter -- who by this time was perspiring profusely, obviously working the stove with no hair net or gloves -- admitted to some ""technical difficulties.""  The pizza had shrimp, but he warned that he couldn't get all of the shell off. That was an unfair statement. He hadn't removed ANY of the shell. I think they were working with shrimp that weren't properly defrosted. What's more, the dough was half raw!!!  My companion and I made it through a slice each and gave up. We were never asked if there was a problem, because we were never checked on.   As a friend noted, ""It is very difficult to #%!¥ up a pizza!""Even when it was apparent that we had barely touched our meals, there was more attention paid to fumbling with the point of sale terminal. (It seems Amex is not accepted, but the two staff members assisting us didn't know that.)I had my cream cheese in a pancake boxed, but the waiter dropped the box on its side, so it's in pretty sad shape. There must have been a change of hands since the glowing reviews. A durable power of attorney posted prominently at the checkout counter and the terrible food and service indicate as much. I won't be visiting again, but the Board of Health might be advised to do so."

/user_details?userid=mFNaL32Gnnp2yn7lvL5Z0w,Sean S.,"Brighton, Brighton, MA",5 star rating,"Went to this little place for brunch based on reviews and was not disappointed. We went at a strange hour (around 10:30) so we were actually the only ones in the restaurant. The owner was the only one working in the restaurant at the time and she was soooo sweet!! She told us how she goes to the local market every morning to pick out fresh fruits and vegetables, which ones were in season and her top recommendations. She then took our order, cooked it herself and gave us extra portions of everything.Could not have been happier with our experience there, we got the eggs paysanne (an omelette with ham and potato with hollandaise sauce) and the italiana crepe (with nutella, berries and coconut flakes) since the berries happened to be in season at the time. Plating was beautiful, and everything was delicious. Really loved the eggs paysanne, and even the side of home fries with the was perfectly cooked and crispy. Left super stuffed, satisfied and ready for a nap."

I never write reviews, but felt it was my duty to let all you guys from down home know that I found our home away from home.  The taste brought me right back to my childhood days. I lived in Montreal for many years now, trying copy-cat donairs that just don't compare, so I'm glad I found the real deal. Took the fam this time in hopes they share in my enthusiasm, ordered us a few donairs and the donair pizza for the kids, and they absolutely loved it, and so did we! I can surely say they'll be seeing us again!"
