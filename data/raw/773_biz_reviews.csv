The beef short rib is amazing, the meet falls off the bone, and the mashed potatoes are to die for. I also tried the burger, the meet should always be cooked that way. Kudos to the chef! Also, our server Kevin is knowledgeable, entertaining, and really know how to take care of guests. Â My family and I had a blast!"

The restaurant bar is fully stocked and they offer a variety o traditional foods as well as local favorites such as poutine. The wait and bar staff were nice. Food prepared as promised in description. Worth the visit. Especially if you do not feel up to leaving the hotel. One thing to note, you can't order food to go. You have to order room service. Bon Apetit."

The service is what I want to highlight though - our servers were very friendly, attentive and really made our night. We ordered drinks with mint and the bar had run out, and without even asking if we'd change our order they sent someone out to the store to get some more and we had our drinks surprisingly quick (before our main course!) That is not something that would ever happen at a hotel bar in the states so I was very impressed. Very glad we ended up here!"
