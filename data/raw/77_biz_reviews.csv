/user_details?userid=APph4_qUbOWCeoS3dwX5Zw,Lauren D.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"I have eaten sushi countless times in my life and in many different cities, and I have to be honest when I say, I was NOT expecting to have arguably the best sushi I have ever had in Canada! Everyone speaks so highly of the Canadian delicacies so I was not thinking i would be so blown away by Saint Sushi Bar, an unsuspecting hole in the wall on a side street off of St Denis. But WOW. That is all I can say. If you are in the area, you just have to come here. The place is quaint, the service was phenomenal and the sushi was just so unbelievably fresh .. like melt in your mouth, almost falling apart fresh. You have to try the Christmas trees as an appetizer, no question and definitely one of the special rolls. But I also got a standard Spicy Salmon roll and it was just as mind-blowing. There's even something so tasty about their soy sauce. I don't know what it is but I have been thinking about this place a lot since I ate there! I am actually sad that I live in the states and can't return to Saint Sushi on the regular."
/user_details?userid=xRYvFaMGWsvKcLCFtRIzWQ,Katerina B.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"I like this place, their selection is fun and different to your regular sushi place. And it is not just the creative names, but also  their original sushi meal combinations.  Their Christmas tree on a cracker is a must try. I haven't been inside the restaurant yet and only had take outs, but I am looking forward to visiting the place when it reopens for dining in again."

/user_details?userid=EOajY1L3ole3gLTCZ2xw1g,Jack M.,"West Chester, PA",3 star rating,"This is an American-style sushi joint. Most of the dishes are made with fake crab and panko. That said, lots of it was tasty. We went for the tasting menu, which is a very good deal. The server, while friendly, snuck us into a sale of the tempura shrimp while not making it clear that it wasn't a gift from the kitchen. Be careful of that. The shrimp was good, so we weren't too upset. The tasting started with a well-executed salmon sashimi. The gingery dressing and smooth salmon mouthfeel made this a great starter. The tempura shrimp (extra) were nicely crisp in the tempura style with a juicy and plump interior. They are served on a stick. Most of the sushi maki rolls tasted the same to me. It mainly focuses on chopped spicy tuna/fake crab/panko/fried stuff etc. It's not bad, but it's primarily not a fish-forward tasting. Just be aware of that."

Like other comments mentioned, it's an American-style sushi shop but with the price, I expected something better and fresh. Having endless experiences with sushi, I would rate this restaurant a decent Montreal Japanese restaurant but not impressed -- Portionwise is quite big for a small size woman, so if you don't eat much and without a helper(s) -- hold yourself on that."
/user_details?userid=TPfCVh0OoXuckE3_k96Btg,Rahim K.,"Old Toronto, Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,"Don't really have much to say, to be honest.  A small little sushi spot with very friendly and very fast service. We ordered the tuna Christmas tree, which is kinda like a tuna Tartar on a rice crispy wafer. We also had the 'Madona' - it was fresh and tasty. For the price, it's a pretty okay spot. I should mention: the girlfriend has been coming here for 4 years, and mentioned the quality has deteriorated from what it used to be."
/user_details?userid=t2O6rs4fZeY9o6ZY52RyJA,Payam Z.,"Boston, MA",4 star rating,"Saint is a posh Sushi spot in Plateau. Though busy, the staff are kind and accommodating and we were lucky to score seats on a Saturday night without a reservation. The menu is relatively short and sweet so you don't have to spend 10 mins reading every permutation of spicy salmon! The prices are a little higher than average but the quality of the fish and service justify it. The best item we tried were the ""Christmas trees""; a bite sized pyramid of spicy salmon piled on a cracker. In tune with this non traditional approach, Saints also plays a steady stream of 90s hip hop which works with the vibe. Overall, despite the somewhat limited menu, this is the best sushi spot I've tried in Montreal."

This place is definitely intimate and usually with long wait times, but 2 seats were snagged at the bar about 30 minutes before closing. Food came quickly and no one rushed me out after closing time.My favorite thing I ate was the sashimi (6 pieces), #3 on the menu. The dressing used was so refreshing, along with thinly sliced apples on top. I want to go back to this restaurant just to have 2 plates for myself!You also can't go wrong with any of their ""maki."" All the names will give you a chuckle as many provides tribute to legendary music icons. Service is top notch here. Everyone has such good working chemistry. The chefs, servers, and even the dishwashers were all singing along to 90s jams. Turns out the chefs are childhood friends with one another. I thought some were brothers, but that they all grew up with each other. They're looking to open another location soon.#49/2018"

The green apple and sashimi salad was better than it looks in all of the pics and was 10/10 the best appetizer I could have imagined.The sushi was out of this world fresh, fun, and trendy.

Came on a double date with some friends and enjoyed the experience! We all had a tasting menu which was a great way to explore many of their yummies. Their apple/fish sashimi's are delliiccioousss and all the rolls we tried were good! Not the best sushi bar we have been to in the city but definitely fresh, generously portioned and yummy.

The options are also quite limited.We also had the unfortunate experience of one of the employees scoffing after we asked a question. Overall, the employees were nice enough and the sushi wasn't bad per se, but really did not live up to expectations."
/user_details?userid=ub7Ante8rFffJoxeE33Y3g,Nancy N.,"Atlanta, GA",5 star rating,"The sushi chefs were very kind and guided me in what to order as I sat at the bar. The restaurant itself has limited seating and gets pretty crowded. You have to walk up to the register to Pay. The sushi tower was delicious atop the crispy rice cracker and their naming convention was entertaining. I mean, who doesn't want a Michael Jackson roll? The guys might take their shirts off and dance if you tip them enough."

I recommend sharing 4 or more rolls with a lot of people so you don't get tired of the flavor.  Music choice is awful and loud."
/user_details?userid=mGpSdlT6XfHOtr-uHJgRzA,George S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"WOW! BEST Sushi in Montreal!!! Trust me - You MUST try it  So happy to have found ""SAINT sushi bar"" on Duluth (One of the top-rated sushi restaurants in Montreal). The excellent sushi & makis are so delicious, creative, fresh and prepared with lots of love and have some really whimsical names like Michael Jackson, Beatles, Bob Marley, Madonna. The tasting menu is perfect for a group. The salmon Christmas trees are AMAZING!  It's really out of this world in both appearance, taste and great quality/price ratio. THANK YOU to all the chef's & staff for being outstanding and super friendly. This place is a gem & unpretentious Wanna know why I believe Saint Sushi Bar is the best? They have their heart in the right place. They have a passion for food (make excellent sushi & maki's) and have fun while working together"

I took the tasting platter and the sensai rolls. It's amazing, it melts in your mouth and I can taste the fresh fish. I love their light sauce in the salmon with green apple from the tasting menu plate (Ask for it they'll give it to you) The sauce is very light and goes with makis, I prefer dipping it to this because you can taste the makis even more! The decoration is nice and the place is small. It's perfect for a place to date! I would definitely come back here. I was perfectly full and satisfied."
/user_details?userid=wffnrXJoLppOlvNOZKU70A,Tamara H.,"Westmount, Canada",5 star rating,"After hearing so many amazing things about Saint Sushi Bar, I finally went for dinner on a random Thursday in June. I reserved for two people at 5:30 - though there was really no need. You only need to reserve if you're going to eat after 7pm or if you're in a big group because it's a small restaurant. For $26.50 each, we ordered the tasting menu. While I don't eat just anything, and was a little worried about what I would be trying, I'm so glad that I was feeling more adventurous that day. The flavours are mind blowing, the combinations really work, and nothing was too far outside my comfort zone! Yummy.First up - salmon sashimi with green apple slaw (2 pieces each). Damn, I would love to eat that again. Though a little cilantro would have really taken it over the edge for us. Then we got the ""Christmas Tree"" (2 pieces each). Mmmmmmmm... basically amazingness (chopped up lobster and crab salad - I think) on a cracker.Last up, the amazing sushi platter, which included four rolls and about 10 pieces of sushi each. Every single piece was beautifully presented and delicious. While it doesn't sound like a lot of food, we left feeling full but more importantly, raving about our little foodie adventure.The ambiance was also fantastic! The employees prepping the sushi were fun and singing along to the awesome 90s playlist they had going. I will for sure return to this cool sushi spot on Duluth!"

/user_details?userid=qtgr1_fvKoMJd4t-naoGqg,Meg A.,"Moretown, VT",5 star rating,"This place is extraordinarily special. There's nothing else quite like it, and it encapsulates the incredible Montreal food scene to a tee. You will be delighted and surprised, but then again, there's a reason it is so highly rated. It's completely unexpected just how flavorful and fresh the food is, artfully arranged by emphasizing the purity and simplicity of the ingredients.  It is in such a funky, cozy spot in one of the liveliest areas of Montreal.  The decor is eclectic, I heard Drake's God's Plan on the speakers at one point, it's loud, cozy, with both an open kitchen and an open dishwashing station.  It's not for stuffed shirts, fussy eaters, or folks who like things prim and proper. It's the bad boy of the sushi scene; bad boys have always been a weakness for me. I've already made a second reservation for when I return to the city in a few weeks. I can't wait to try the sampler platter. If it's anywhere near as good as my Michael Jackson maki, I just may float. Service is friendly and efficient, especially when I asked for menus in English. It gives off the vibe of having a strong local following, but they certainly made this visitor feel welcomed and at home."
/user_details?userid=SisbjmC3RGETDw4dzLDCYw,Diana K.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"My favourite sushi place in the city! Not much to say other than that you need to go and have their tasting menu.P.S. If you love the apple vinegar sashimi as much as I do, you can ask the waiters/waitresses to pour the remaining sauce into a small dish so that you don't look ridiculous licking off the plate it comes in. :)"
/user_details?userid=kXCA-yjGBSDj9ObGLDOC0w,Kelly L.,"Boston, MA",5 star rating,"We weren't planning on coming here during our trip to Montreal but boy am I glad we ended up here. The host was very friendly, which really made our experience that much better. We got the tuna sashimi and apples, the salmon christmas tree and the Beatles Maki.The tuna sashimi and apples was very unique. I never thought that mixing fruit with fish was appealing but this changed my mind. It was basically a sweet and sour sauce. No need for soysauce!The salmon christmas tree. One of the main reasons I wanted to try this was because- CHRISTMAS TREE! I love the holidays and the name was appealing to me. The tartare was mixed with small rice crackers on top of a Rice cracker. It was full of flavor and the crunch was a plus. Note: While the other Maki comes in 5 pieces, the Beatles comes in 4- 1 for each Beatle, the waiter explained. Not complaining because it was so good!I look forward to visiting again to try the other rolls!"
/user_details?userid=KEBvAP-lG8oOUaX4coq0cg,Issan Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Dear Saint Sushi Bar,Our friend M recommend you so many times, we knew that when the time came for her to go back home, you would be the perfect host for our farewell dinner. We came early (~5 PM) on a cold winter evening, and stepped into your cozy, welcoming dining room. The place was empty, so we had the chance to sit at the bar. Have you ever felt like you wanted to be part of the team that was serving you dinner? Well that's how cool you were! It was like having dinner at a friend's place - only a friend with professional sushi skills. Music seems to be a connecting thread at Saint Sushi Bar, and we bonded over that topic, changing the playlist, recommending concerts and reminiscing 80's, 90's and 00's best hip hop/R&B gurus.Then there was the food itself. The tasting menu was in three parts, starting with a refreshing carpaccio-style sashimi that was full of flavours. This was followed by the very festive 'Christmas trees', little towers of salmon or lobster mixed with green onions and tobiko. Last came the gorgeous plate of sushi rolls. They were all named after famous musicians, and the most eye catching of them all (perhaps because I'm a fan) was The Beatles, a colourful creation shaped like a flower, with enoki mushrooms as pistils. We were allotted 10 rolls each, but portions are quite generous, so we were overwhelmingly full toward the end of the dinner.  What a great meal, and even greater people! Next time, we will make sure to come early again, as we can enjoy your company to the fullest. The food only makes it better :)Warm wishes for the cold months,I&J"
/user_details?userid=lyY3aOmISGFcfXQhPusyGA,Maude C.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This casual sushi place is unlike most sushi restaurants. A very casual ambiance with a mix of eclectic decor. It feels like a small local neighbourhood joint more than a asian-style traditional sushi place. The menu is straight forward with a selection of signature rolls and a few tasting combos. We sat at the bar and tried the tasting menu - salmon sashimi, followed by Christmas trees (salmon and tuna tartare on a rice cracker shaped like a pyramid), and a sampler of rolls. The sushi were creative and visually interesting. There was not as much whole fish pieces to my liking in the rolls, but overall the flavour was on point. The variety of sushi was good, no two rolls had the same wrapping. The place only sits a few so make sure you call ahead if you're heading during dinner time."
/user_details?userid=qxuJk8rRr2Fm7OphnzOkoQ,Gwen N.,"Vancouver, Canada",5 star rating,"We came here randomly after looking for sushi places in the area. Saint Sushi came up as one of the top choices that was also open on Sunday so off we went! Entering the tiny restaurant you're greeted with an eclectic collection of decor from all around the world from a Buddha statue to a bright diner-like light up Coke clock on the wall. We were seated quickly at the bar, a few of the last few seats! The owner (I found this out after) told us what they had special that day and also about their omakase menu that was a reasonable $25/person. We opted for the omakase. Similar to those below me, the omakase I got came with apple/salmon tataki with a ponzu sauce, imitation crab meat ""Christmas trees"" on a cracker, and an assortment of 3 rolls that came with a fish sauce and sweet thai dipping sauce. The roll that stood out to me was the one with the spicy salmon and mango wrapped in nori, I can't remember what it was called. A close second was the deep fried roll, I think it was called the Bob Marley?The food was an interesting concoction of japanese and other cultural influences that I was totally down with. Since we were seated at the bar we got to chat with the chefs who are all super cool guys who really love what they do. One of them was cutting mangoes and even gave us a dish of some to eat since he thought they were ""too good not to share"". The highlight of my entire time here was definitely the service, closely followed with the food. The guys who run this place are all very nice and friendly. I'll be back here on my next trip to Montreal, that's a fact!"

No alcohol unfortunately (at least the last time I went, which was a few months ago). I don't know how authentic the sushi is (considering their size), but it's absolutely delicious and refined - I would call it artisan. I was a bit worried at first when we did the tasting menu because I eat a lot and thought it wouldn't fill me up - but it did! The sushi rolls are very filling. Each piece is carefully thought out."

They are big on different tartars (tuna, salmon). Their Christmas trees are awesome. They have a wonderful tasting menu for $22. Definitely inexpensive but enough food to fill you up. Service is very attentive by the staff. They definitely take pride in the service they provide. Beware that this is a popular place for young adults (at 45 I was the oldest person by at least 10 yrs) and the music is very loud.

The only thing my girlfriend and I wanted was...bomb sushi. Found this place on Yelp and we were highly impressed!! A hip and modern sushi bar near downtown Montreal on a busy street filled with restaurants and shops. The interior was dimly lit and just set off a cool vibe. The music really brought me back. They were playing 90's hip hop like Bone Thugs and Harmony - loved the music. Such a throwback! Our waitress spoke great English and was overly nice to use and helped explain anything we had questions on the menu.My girlfriend and I love sushi rolls - and that's what this place had. Lots of delicious and unique sushi rolls! The names of the rolls were very unique. Most of the rolls were named after famous music artists. We ordered an array of sushi rolls! Unfortunately, I was so exhausted from traveling I forgot all the rolls we ordered. It didn't matter tho, they were all fantastic!If I'm ever in Montreal again, I will absolutely be back here for more sushi!"
/user_details?userid=8BswmQsehWlxnCFhVfRXNg,Heather L.,"South Burlington, VT",5 star rating,Delicious sushi in a small unassuming restaurant. And it is super affordable! Fixed menu was three courses and 26$ CAD per person. We sat at the bar and Raul entertained and spoiled us to some delicious sushi. It's not the typical fare -- more sweet than savory flavors. They asked for any allergies and preferences which was fantastic. Sashimi came with julienned green apple and a sweet oil. Christmas trees were interesting -- it was a shrimp/tuna mix with tempura flakes on a rice cracker. Then came the rolls. Four glorious rolls. The Beatles was my favorite (fresh and rolled in cucumber). Definitely check the place out for a great sushi dinner!

/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Although it might not be the most authentic sushi restaurant I've been to, Saint Sushi Bar definitely provides an inventive twist on fusion sushi that will leave you wanting more! I went in on a weeknight when it wasn't so busy (pro-tip: you'll most likely need a reservation to get in during the dinner shift on the weekends or you'll miss out), and I opted to sit at the bar so I could watch my food being prepared.The main chef who took care of me was very nice and seemed genuinely interested in making friendly conversation. It definitely enhanced the tasting menu that I got, which consisted of sashimi with shreds of apple, ""Christmas trees"" of seafood tartar on thin rice cakes, and Michael Jackson and Bob Marley maki for the last course. You can customize the first two courses with your choice of fish, so I ordered salmon for the sashimi and tuna for the trees! The slightly buttery salmon sashimi was perfectly enhanced by the somewhat tart apple and citrusy sauce on top, while the cut of the rice cake through the tuna tartar provided a nice contrast. Normally for sushi, I am strongly against the concept of mixing two or more ingredients in roll form unless it's traditional futomaki, but I loved how Saint Sushi Bar added some traditional ingredients from other Asian countries as an experimental element. I also appreciated the fact that they played with the textures of the usual westernized sushi combos instead of leaving the fillings in chunks like they normally are. The Michael Jackson roll was more like your average fusion roll (but with actually fresh ingredients), but the Bob Marley roll was my favorite simply because of its inventiveness with the rice paper roll on the outside and a little bit of creamy yogurt sauce on the inside. It actually worked well together to be greater than the sum of its parts.I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to experience western-style sushi that isn't your typical low-quality venture into dragon and spider rolls. That being said, you'll want to take a few trips to try everything on the menu because it's that impressive!"

/user_details?userid=bUPeHBFEINhqiKj9-k4-zA,Charles N.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Again, theory is confirmed, the best seat in any restaurant is at the bar. That's where the action is at!At Saint Sushi you will not be disappointed by owner Saeng who is always having a great time, pounding out his creation one after the next. My friend and I were enjoying his humming, singing and dancing along classic hits such as ""Kiss on my List"" by Hall & Oates and ""Hypnotize"" by the one and only Notorious B.I.G.Inside is a surreal restaurant, with a fantastic atmosphere and eclectically decorated with Laotian traditional paintings & statues, but you'll also find an Alice in Wonderland's Rabbit pendant clock, an elephant sporting a NY Yankees baseball hat, various shaped lamps and so many more items that don't quite fit together but somehow make sense here!The menu contains an assortment of options. We went for the tasting menu which was surprisingly affordable! My favorites so far was the Christmas Tree, a conifer-like mounted mixture of lobster, tobiko, masago, scallions and bits of tempura I believe. Close second is the Beatles which is a lobster maki encased in a cucumber sheet with enoki mushrooms topped with Tuna and Salmon sashimi. The joyfully named maki rolls were actually inspired from artists that owner Saeng grew up with: Bob Marley, Madonna, Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson, Tupac and many more - take the time to ask why and you'll chuckle.When asked about the restaurant name, Saeng mentioned that he used to love visiting many cities outside Montreal, that always seemed to the start with 'St-Something'... hence Saint Sushi was born (St-Montreal didn't quite sound right)!The only drawbacks of this place is that they do not have a liquor license, which is not a bad thing as you can focus on the food... and the wait time, even when you have a reservation; which is also kinda ok in case you arrive late. Otherwise, if your are in for an unconventional sushi stop, then you've found it!"

It was busy, the servers were in no way shy about telling you that you have a deadline to order and then promptly disappearing for 30 mins. We understood, we coped, we payed just under 10$ for 3 pieces of salmon sashimi. The miso soup had something that looked like soggy pieces of romaine lettuce in it (before you ask no it was not seaweed or watercress or any other thing you might be used to finding in a miso soup).The rolls were over complicated and filled with tempura and mayonnaise to the point where you couldn't really see where the fish began and the filler ended. Don't get me wrong, these were beautiful pieces of art made with food, but I don't think anyone who calls themselves a ""purist"" would call it sushi since it's my understanding that sushi is about the fish not all the ingredients you put around it for look and texture.As for the ""eclectic""/pan-Asian decor, well let's just say that though the Thai styled Buddha and the Ganesh statue were a bit of an odd choice, the European-looking war ship model in the corner fit right in with staff made entirely of white dudes."

We had no reservation so had to sit at the sushi bar which was fine with me because I like watching the chefs roll their sushi.My friend and I ordered 2 miso soup and the combo called Cycle which included 10 pieces of maki, 4 pièces of sushi, 2 pieces of the Christmas tree and sashimi.First came the miso soup...oh god it was salty!!!...barely took 2 sips. When we told the waiter, he said he would not charge us for them...ok.As for the sushi, definitely cannot be called authentic. There is a lot of fruits used in the roll...which kind of masked the taste of the fish in the sushi rolls. Sushi in Japan is all about the fish...keeping everything simple so thay you can taste the freshness of the fish. It was good sushi but not something I would call authentic. You know it is fusion sushi when you see non japanese/Asian making sushi :pAlthough not the best I have tried but for the price, it is a pretty good bang for your buck. The service was also pretty good. I would go back for some affordable sushi and the sushi chef was very funny and made this experience a lot more fun."

That said, the take on the sushi, nigiri, sashimi, etc. are quite creative and quite tasty! Boyfriend and I are from Vancouver so we know our sushi. Decided to give this place a try given the high ratings. We were able to make a reservation the day of. The staff told us on the phone that they will hold our reservations for 15 minutes, and they definitely respect that despite the many walk-ins that they have.We had the chef's tasting menu and were not disappointed. The sashimi is served with apples for acidity, which was refreshing and opens up one's appetite. I still prefer just plain sashimi but this was a new experience. The ""sapins"" were great. Nice mix of flavours and the crispiness of the rice cracker nicely balanced out the lobster mixture. The rice cracker was also easy to hold :) The sushi platter was thoroughly explained by the server. There was a roll which was wrapped in cucumber instead of nori, a roll wrapped with Vietnamese rice paper and another called the Michael Jackson. They were all great and also came with different dipping sauces to enlighten your palate. At the end, both of us were contently full.The decor inside has influence from all over Asia and the open counter where all the food is prepared is probably the most relaxed and chill environment I have ever witnessed. This is a fun spot to try if you're in Montreal. Remember, have an open mind!!! And make reservations!"

The staff was very friendly and the environment very chill, but right as I entered the location, the smell of mold was overwhelming. As someone with asthma, this was a big red flag and made me wonder about the cleanliness of the place. The miso soup was delicious, but I cannot say the same of the other items we got. The avocado on the hosomaki I ordered was all brown - all six pieces. The other two maki, the ""Marvin Gaye"" and ""Tupac"" tasted ok, but that's it - I've ordered delivered sushi that tasted better and fresher and from the amount of great reviews, I was assuming this sushi was awesome, so I can say that I already had some expectations.Another thing that was very bothering to see was that several people were arriving from the street and quickly started to help out on food preparation. Some using gloves, some weren't, only a few using a cooking apron despite dealing so closely with food. As a matter of fact we saw someone taking groceries (cucumber) out of the bag and slicing right away - but I'll give the benefit of doubt that it could have been pre-washed."

And when I say sushi fusion, it's not really sushi as you know it, it's basically crab mix 5 ways - in seaweed, in cucumber, on a rice chip, in a spring roll wrapper etc. Lovely presentation, and I must admit they have the crab mix down, very very tasty.  Think MSG tasty.  But the pounding music makes it impossible to have a conversation in the small cramped space.  So small the dishes are being washed next to the sushi bar, and water being filled up through the tap (with small filter) nonstop.  Food is a solid 3.5.  Overall experience is a 1 or 2 for date night, but a 4 or 5 for a pre-going out or party night spot.  There is no alcohol, at all.  Sake or wine would have enhanced the food.  Absent here.  The guys running the place are very cool and laid back, the guy who took our reservation was Uber cool.  Appreciate the service 5/5.  But overall, not at all what we expected from the number 1 sushi ranking on Yelp and TA."

What sweetens the deal is that this is legit a little hole-in-the-wall with likely the most eclectic decor I've seen in a while. The open kitchen allows you to watch this teams of young rag-tag dudes totally kill this sushi business, with exceptionally fun and fast service.I ordered the tasting plate, which ends up being a good deal, however if you're really hungry I'd maybe order something extra on the side.  Tip: don't be like me and not have a reservation.

/user_details?userid=Tdp-vTDHrfR2rQk2emDKiA,Alice B.,"Brooklyn, NY",4 star rating,"Have you been here?  No?  Well, I think you should because I'm jealous you get the opportunity.  This was one of my favourite haunts back when I lived in Montreal. I started going to Saint Sushi Bar right after it opened up on a narrow little street in my old neighborhood borough.  SSB is consistently delicious, fresh, with great service, wonderful ambiance, creative sushi and the loveliest staff. On my first ever trip in the staff greeted me with a smile and friendly conversation and greeted me with kindness and familiarity in every visit thereafter. You can expect the atmosphere in Saint to be lively, with lots of hip music.  The folks that run this place work hard and take sushi seriously, but they're certainly not afraid to dance and sing while churning out some sweet rolls.Two can dine here quite reasonably for $45 when you get the omakase, which is a wonderful sampling of the better menu items at Saint.  Just thinking about it makes my mouth water at the thought of their delicious 'christmas tree' shrimp tartare.  A lot of the rolls here have a very creamy texture that is cut with the crunchiness of cucumber but it's a taste and texture combination that is a true hit.I'd love to see their menu expand or change a little, but even if they don't change a thing I'll be happy to come back whenever I can. Unfortunately that's not enough these days.  Don't fault them for the lack of a liquor license either -- they've been trying for ages and this is a product of the horrible bylaw system in Montreal."

The location isn't huge and fills up fast, so definitely make a reservation if you're going at peak times. The staff were so friendly and on point and the atmosphere was a lot of fun (Casual but still a sit down place, great for a date!), especially being seated at the bar where you can watch the super talented chefs work their magic and ask them first hand for their recommendations ! The sushi was delicious , great presentation and prepared with care. The fish was so fresh and their flavor combos aren't your typical every day rolls but they were all well thought out and tasted great.  By far , the order to take is the chef's choice tasting menu, its so much food for such a great price and allows you to try things you may not have thought to on your own (Its 3 courses, starting with Sashimi, what they call a christmas tree which is comparable to a really great tartar, and then a mix of various Maki Rolls, all of which were outstanding). Just one thing to note , they don't serve alcohol and limited choice of beverages. Not gonna lie , I can eat alot of food and I can safely say the tasting menu left me full and satisfied, well worth the price. I am definitely planning to come back here again and again to curb that ever present sushi craving !"

I usually go there and have their Tasting Menu for 26$ taxes included, it's a 14 pieces menu which includes sashimi and maki, it's not very consistent if you're really hungry but fair for what you pay. The restaurant is pretty with a nice and cozy decor and atmosphere however the music there does not coincide with everything else, it's hip hop and it's loud, why? Also, no desserts.."
/user_details?userid=YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,Ann T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Location: Tucked away on Duluth, just off of St. Denis (head east). The closest subway is Mont-Royal or you can try your luck with street parking.The place: Teeny tiny, but it's got BIG energy. The space is nothing fancy but it offers up a chill, comfortable vibe. The guys who run this place also have excellent taste in music so you don't need to worry about having to listen to elevator music or that pop crap. The goods: Honestly, I could write a short novel about how goddamn good the sushi is here, but I won't. All you need to know is that SS serves up top notch cuisine using quality ingredients and everything is made upon order. I tried the tasting menu that included such goodies as the Bob Marley, the Beatles, the Madonna and the Michael Jackson, among others. The starter was salmon sashimi in a sake reduction. Jesus, it was good. Our second dish was the 'Christmas tree' - a lovely concoction of seafood served on a rice cracker. Our waiter Ali (hope I spelled that right!), told me the present wasn't on the bottom but rather, on the top - and he was right. It was so incredibly flavourful that I could feast on this alone. The grand finale was a beautiful sushi platter and every item on it rocked. Hello - can I move in?Service: Phenomenal. Ali, Saeng, Ralph and our host whose name I unfortunately didn't get, were amazing. You can't ask for friendlier people to accompany a wonderful meal. I had a great chat with the guys and they let me know that they were basically a group of childhood friends who decided to work together. They really seem to love what they do and it's obvious that they mesh well. A huge white gangsta shout-out to these fine gents.Price point: Super affordable - the tasting menu is $22 tax in, per person. So... What are you waiting for? Go! But be warned - you'll need a reservation on weekends. This place is too cool for school."

I always bring people here because it's good and fairly inexpensive. It's $25.50 for three courses. The only downside is that they don't serve alcohol!!  it's really too bad. My favorite thing on the menu is the Christmas tree. I've had the salmon and the lobster and both are delicious! It's super tasty and crunchy. The tasting menu also comes with salmon sashimi with apples cut julienne style and a vinaigrette. For two people they also give with four different maki rolls and two sauces. One is a spicy mayo and one is a vinaigrette. I will for sure be back.

We didn't realize it, but we arrived 5 minutes before they were closing. The place was packed and the owner quickly greeted us and said two seats would be opening up soon. He was right and we quickly got two seats at the bar. We were surprised to see the menu was in French only (oh no!), but one of the sushi chefs helped us immediately when he realized we spoke only English. He recommended doing the tasting menu so we did. All of the rolls are named after famous musicians which was really fun. Everything was fresh and absolutely delicious! Our favorite was the Beatles roll with mushrooms. It was fun to watch the chefs make the rolls and I was so impressed with the friendliness of the owner and other staff. They were extremely nice especially since it was so close to quitting time. I know people probably don't go to Montreal for sushi per se, but we really enjoyed this place!"

The restaurant is small, so reservations seem necessary for ""normal"" dining times.The server walked us through the menu and explained how the tasting menu worked. It is chef's choice, but the server told us what we would get, which helped with decision making. We decided to do one tasting menu and an extra roll for the two of us. Everything tasted amazing!

The real deal, however, is their fusion style sushi. Their sushi is definitely not authentic, but that doesn't mean it's not delicious. Their rolls are so creative and each one of them is so good you will want to try their whole menu. I always get the tasting menu here because it lets you try 5 of their rolls with 2 different appetizers. It starts off with salmon sashimi in sesame and pear dressing, which will give you the most unique taste of salmon. Then they serve their Christmas Trees; they are crispy lobster tartar on a rice cracker and this is my personal favourite from this place. I would highly recommend trying their Christmas trees. Then comes the big platter full of their rolls with 2 different sauces. I think this meal has a great value and taste!It does get a little busy at peak times and may take some time to serve you, but I think it's all worth it."

Love the deco - it's a very hippy modern sushi restaurant, not your typical traditional sushi place.I decided to go with the tasting menu ($25.50)First dish was a salmon carpaccio, with 2 pieces of salmon sashimi topped with shredded green apple. The green apple added a nice refreshing crunch to the dish.Second dish were the Christmas trees. Essentially they were mixed lobster meat with tempura bits and spicy mayo stacked into a tree shape topped on a rice cracker. They have different types of filling for the Christmas trees - my coworker ordered the salmon one. I actually think I liked that one more. They called it lobster meat but I think it was just diced up imitation crab meat.The Last dish were the 2 rolls - there were 5 pieces of the Madonna Maki roll, and 6 pieces of  the Salmon Sensi roll. The Madonna maki was stuffed with salmon, mango, cucumbers, and avocado. The Sensi roll was stuffed with salmon mixed in tempura bits, lettuce, cucumbers, and avocado wrapped in rice paper. Very interesting twist in sushi rolls and tasted really refreshing. I liked how both rolls weren't stuffed with rice, and instead with a lot of other vegetable ingredients. A decent amount of food for one person - well worth the value."

They put tempura in all of their makis which, let's be real, kinda sucks! Also, since there was tempura in everything it felt like we didn't have enough variety! The service was very very good !

I always have certain types of them I order, for instance like the California role. So once I went here, I saw the menu, and they dont have a lot of options from the usual ones, so I was sure I wouldnt like this place.But we decided to order the chef's choice and a few classic ones just in case. The food came and OMG it was so good! My favorite was the one called ""Christmas Tree"", its almost only samon but I loved it. I'd come back here again for sure.P.S. its better if you have a reservation there, as the place is small, and we had to wait a bit since we didn't have a reservation"
/user_details?userid=5lT1GxGTIArrYbZGazAm-A,Ida K.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Quite sadly, I'm yet to find a great SUSHI place in Montreal :(So I got the omakase and the highlight is the ""christmas trees"" which come toward the beginning of the meal. They are nice and tasty. In fact my first impression was that they are kinda creative as well. And then  the same tree mixture was used in the first maki, and, ok, it was still nice. Then a bit in the other maki and the next one... and half way through the meal it became totally uninspiring and boring :( what I like about having sushi is the mixing and explosion of different textures and flavours in my mouth as I try different sashimi, maki etc. So this place completely missed the mark for me. On a diff note: I find it kinda surprising why Tri Express chefs think it's a good idea to follow the same idea so closely - but that's material for another reviewyelp.ca/biz_photos/tri-e…"

/user_details?userid=sKVpHfhkG_Nvgf_Vfb91Cg,Janine T.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Was brought here by my trusted Yelp friend, Brian C and the place did not disappoint. We got the tasting menu and I still can't believe how tasty it was and reasonably priced, it felt like that Ikea commercial where the woman buys a bunch of stuff and starts running out and yelling at her husband to ""start the car!"" The warm Michael Jackson roll was my fave, but all of the fish tasted so good and the rolls were all different enough to make me think that I was back in Vancouver eating close to the ocean and not deep in the heart of the Plateau.The staff here are all so much fun and laughed with us, gave us thorough explanations of everything and made us feel welcome. Next time I go, I'll definitely sit at the bar because that looked like even more fun. This place draws people of all ages and the presentation of the food somehow is so gorgeous despite how quickly they were able to get it prepared and onto our table.The only sorta bummer here is that they don't have a liquor licence and you can't bring your own, but hey, it keeps people moving in and out quickly, so you'll never have to wait long for a table. Reservations are highly recommended as the space is fairly small."

I think the chef here used to work for Tri because the flavour profile is almost identical. That special flavour they put in very roll that you just can't wrap your taste buds around (unami maybe?) is found in all the sushi's here as well. They also have that yummy tartar topped on a cracker found at Tri that goes by the name 'Christmas tree'Super affordable and set in a larger space with tables of decent size, it's a very nice place to enjoy a weekday sushi outing.Get the chefs tasting menu (23.50$), you won't be disappointed. Only downside is that, like Tri, they don't have an alcohol permit so you can't pair a good sake with the delicious sushi."
/user_details?userid=5B5VU6-wA0ooGYJp1nNNEA,Richard B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"The decor of Saint Sushi Bar doesn't follow your typical Japanese restaurant. Really, I thought that I was in some sort of Indo-Thai restaurant. But just as unconventional as the decor was, the menu was amazing. Named after pop culture's famous icons, each sushi roll was as unique as the people it represented. No, you won't just taste a massive whiff of spicy mayo in each but you'll actually get to taste intriguing combinations of flavors. Which is why the tasting platter is an excellent choice. Don't worry, there are traditional sushi in the menu but the ""celebrity"" ones are must tries. On top of excellent creative sushi, the staffs were extremely down to earth. My jokes were replied with more jokes coming from the waitress, one of the chefs kept telling us across two tables to not hesitate if we had any questions, another member showed serious concerns about my friend's broken finger which was wrapped in a cast and wished for her well-being. It felt as if we were welcomed not as clients but as professional friends.Saint Sushi Bar really deserves a top spot on Yelp. Do yourself a favor and add this place to your food bucket list."

Both times we ordered the chefs tasting menu which seems to be the way to go. Everything was excellent, the stand outs were the Christmas Tree and the Michael Jackson Maki Roll. You really can't go wrong at this low key resto with friendly staff  and sushi rolls with names like Madonna and Bob Marley.

Finding something decent in the middle is a tricky act to follow. However, Saint Sushi delivers on all points.Not only is it moderately priced, you get lots of bang for your buck. The flavors are just simply amazing. With a  hip attitude and tasting menus named after gangsters like ""Bonnie"" or ""Clyde"" or maki rolls named after singers like James Brown or Madonna, if you like trying out unique sushi flavors, then come here.Their ""Sapins de Noel"" (Christmas tree) is a particular delight,. Lobster on a rice cracker, it's a wonderful, unique take. Then there's the ambiance and service. The guys running the place are really nice and friendly, they want to make your experience a positive one and it really shows. Plus there were all these great 80's tunes playing, with a mix which went from ""We are the World"" to ""Grease"" to ""Home Sweet Home"" from Motley Crue.  I felt like I was suddenly back in the fifth grade listening to the radio while noshing on great food.So with great tunes, great service, great food and great prices, please pray tell, why would I want to go anywhere else for sushi now?"

When I first clicked on Saint Sushi Bar's yelp page, the photos looked so good. When I actually clicked on the image, it shows that one of the pictures belonged to my cousin & fellow foodie, Kim T. After reading her review, I knew this is a place worth trying. Good : We showed up as walk ins and the place was already packed, and the friendly host suggested we come back in 30 mins, so we strolled around the charming Duluth street. Finally we got a seat by the sushi bar so we get to watch all the action. Our waiter was really attentive, taking the time to explain how the menu works and recommended the tasting menu for our first time. $20 per person for some of the best sushi ever? Sold. The food arrived quickly and waiter would enthusiastically explain the dish (which also gets me hyped up). The service was fantastic, my overall experience is very favourable.Bad : The wait will suck if you're a walk in. It's a very small space, but worth going for the food. Be smart, make reservations, don't be a walk in.Bottom Line: I am craving sushi as I write this. This place is the real deal. Now I know why there's a lot of 5 stars on their Yelp page."

Because for a flat $20 each, me and my two funny hungry honeypie friends had a 3 course tasting menu that filled us up and left us perfectly delighted. Rivals the best sushi we've had in this sushi-dangerous town that's far from the sea, and at a fraction of the cost. And the service was friendly, funny, interested in making sure we were enjoying ourselves, had no allergies, had everything quick since we (ok, I) was at the point of hangry. Honestly, it's kind of rare in this town to eat a meal that so nicely balances price with freshness, inventive flavours and thoughtful friendly service.

The downside? No alcohol. You can't even bring your own. The tasting menu starts off with sashimi in a sake reduction and julienned apple. Delicious. The apple adds a tangy twist that harmonizes well with the fish. We couldn't get enough of the ""Sapin de Noel"", like they call it. Tartare with spicy mayo, crispy panko and fish eggs, served on a rice cracker. The sushi plate itself was good, but not memorable. The rolls' names were though. Try the ""Michael Jackson"" (black nori on the inside but white rice on the outside) or the ""Madonna"" (with yellow mango). My favorite was the rice paper-wrapped spicy salmon roll. Just wow. Plus, you have a choice of sauces to dip your sushis in: spicy yogurt, soy sauce or fish/vinegar sauce. We were just hungry enough for the omakase. It was satisfying, but the food was so good that we still contemplated ordering another plate of sushi rolls. Just out of gluttony. Highly recommended!"

I wouldn't have objected staying longer though (another time) because the ambiance was super cool,  with casual yet kind staff,  interesting  and varied clientele, and awesome dub tunes in the background.  Now for the food: the menu is relatively small for a Montreal sushi place,  but I consider that to be an advantage - everything is fresh! My vegetarian partner got an avocado roll and the only veggie roll on the menu.  She loved both,  but the small veggie selection might limit our future visits. I had one of the dinner combos, the Bonnie.  It started with an original sashimi. Two fat salmon pieces with jullien style apple shreds,  olive oil, light chilli, and sliced scallions. Wow!  Juicy and full of flavours. The main dish was not as tantalizing, but was still very good.  It contained two different rolls and four pieces of nigiri (two salmon,  and two shrimp). They have cheaper lunch specials until 2:30 pm.  I was very happy with the food,  the service and the atmosphere of the place. It's not the cheapest sushi place in the neighborhood,  but I highly recommend it.  Definitely worth it!"

We came here three girls and got two of the large tasting menus to share. We've all been to Tri-express before and made the mistake of ordering a tasting menu each, which resulted in each of us not being able to finish half of it so we figured we'd order less this time. The portions at Saint Sushi were not as big as the ones at Tri-express and we came out of our meals hungry. If you have been to Tri-Express, the menu at Saint Sushi is not very different but I did find that the flavour wasn't as good as at Tri-Express. Every roll as well as the Christmas tree lacked flavour and seasoning (it was not bland but could use some extra seasoning).Overall, its not a bad sushi restaurant but I don't think it deserves its hype."

The moment I walked through the door, I was greeted by the gentleman who served me the previous time I was there, which was a month ago.As I was assigned my seat, he says ""Hey, ça va?"" as if we knew each other already. I was caught off guard. To my amazement, I realized that he remembered me. He pointed to the exact spot, to the left near the bar, which my date and I were seated last time. At that moment, it felt special for me. It made me feel valued as a customer.I finally realized what made this place amongst the top rated restaurants on Yelp. Of course, we can go on and on about the food and decor. In the end, there's one element that the staff adds to this place which makes it wonderful, the personal touch. It's a laid back environment with great service and even greater people. They're basically your friends who happen to serve you food!*Even if you have allergies, they will make the adjustments necessary to assure you have a great experience.As for the food, when you open the menu, you don't get overwhelmed with all the items.

Seating like some Quebec sugar shack.  I thought it was a great combo of influences.  Really knocked out every expectation I had, and then snuck in an amazing experience.  This resto is on the same street as the more obvious players - you'll be smelling the Italian and Green restaurants nearby - but you should not be swayed from your mission of eating at this unique and delectable place."

The sauce that it was soaked in saved the dish.Lobster bits on rice cracker (6/10): not sure what the actual name of this is (look at pics I posted) not bad but nothing special. Assorted rolls (Madonna, Michael Jackson, 2 other rolls) (6/10): you get 3 rolls of each kind per person. The best one was probably the Michael Jackson, but maybe because it was fried so had a bit of texture. Other rolls were okay. I can give brownie points for creativity (one roll was wrapped in Vietnamese rice paper instead of seaweed, the other was wrapped in cucumber). This restaurant is for those not into authentic sushi (ie. Fresh quality sashimi) this restaurant is for those who enjoy gimicky rolls with random stuff (like enoki mushrooms wrapped in cucumber).Meh."

In his opinion he didn't like it because he was hungry in the end and the only roll he truly enjoyed was the Michael Jackson. I loved the appetizers, we added on the shrimp tempura which was very tasty, the Christmas trees were sooooo great wow! The rolls are not traditional sushi rolls. I enjoyed one a lot that used rice paper instead of seaweed but the end pieces were incredibly chewy. The rest of the rolls were really light and refreshing! In my opinion it's something different and nice to try, $25 per person was great for what you got. I wouldn't put it on my top 10 but I would go for a change if you're a sushi lover !"

There are no California or Dragon rolls on the menu.  Instead expect the unexpected. The staff has put together a menu that combines tradition with modern flair to make a fusion of tastes and flavors.  The evening menu has two chef specials, the Bonnie et Clyde.  You will get a great mix of all the offerings, including my favorite a lobster mix served on a rice cracker.Another nice fusion is the Micheal Jackson - which is a mix of salmon, shirmp  and tuna rolled and then fried.The staff is super energetic and passionate about what they are doing. They treat each customer warmly and will answer any questions you may have about the menu. I love supporting places that love doing what they do!The times I've been, they have played a nice mix of 80's music and a volume that makes conversation enjoyable while still being able to groove to some old school classics.Check it out!"

Every roll and dish has new, interesting and diverse flavour combinations and everything tastes incredibly fresh. I ordered the tasting menu, which costs about $25.00 and included three courses: one small sashimi plate, two ""Christmas Trees"" (lobster on a cracker; it's delicious), and a final sushi/maki plate with a selection of whatever the chef decides to put on it that night. Every single item was tasty as hell. The service was excellent too, our waiter was friendly and explained all of the dishes to us nicely. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review of this place is that I was left a little hungry upon leaving. This isn't necessarily a problem, the food was amazing and I'm sure about 70% of people don't need anything more, but for $25.00, even two or three more rolls would've gone a long way to leaving me satisfied.Overall, brilliant place.

/user_details?userid=RxtaZlcS4vLgDAw1C3ZRAA,Leanna K.,"Raleigh, NC",5 star rating,"Oh man. tl;dr: IT'S AWESOME GO EAT THERE. (more detailed post below)Ok to preface, I'm from Vancouver and we have a TON of amazing sushi, so my standards are crazy high. I've been living in Montreal for a year now, and honestly this city has the worst sushi I've ever had, in regards to quality and price. Just isn't worth it.Unfortunately, I NEED to eat sushi in order to be truly happy, so we decided to check Yelp and see what Montrealers thought was best, and this place was on top. I was a cook for many years so I know to take Yelp reviews with a grain of salt, as sometimes peoples standards are low, or a number of factors, and I've been disappointed before. Anyway, apparently you should have reservations at this place which we were not aware, but the man who greeted us was super friendly and willing to accommodate and suggested we sit at the bar, no problem!We poked around the menu and my boyfriend asked what our server preferred to eat (boyfriend is sushi noob) and he suggested we try their tasting menu, $22 per person, sure why not!  We usually spend around $40 for enough for both of us on crap delivery sushi, so it couldn't hurt. First and foremost, the people that work there are awesome and it seems like they truly enjoy doing what they do. I love seeing that kind of passion in local small business. This is not traditional sushi, but the fun fusion type, but its done very well. They know what flavours and textures compliment what.The fish was fresh and expertly prepared, sliced properly and delicious. The rice was cooked appropriately and seasoned properly as well which is a huge deal with sushi. They offered a variety of dipping sauces with the final platter of sushi and suggested which roll goes with which. They were playing some fun music as well, I think the men in black theme came on during our second course, ha! All in all a GREAT experience and I left full and impressed. Best sushi I've had in the city, and I'll definitely be back."

/user_details?userid=vL9CLAy3yM6aTcCXuH2fNQ,Jennifer J.,"Edmonton, Canada",3 star rating,"I admit this place is quite unique, but way way overpriced. We ordered the tasting menu, and for something like $25/ person, we were extremely unsatisfied after finishing the meal. All three of us were hungry after finishing the three-course tasting menu. The first course was some salmon and tuna sashimi with green apple slices and a sake based sauce. These tiny thin cut slices were delicious, but only included a tiny taste of each (2 slices of super thin fish/ person). Then came the christmas trees. These were alright, but there seemed to be a trend from this dish onwards with an overuse of mayo that kinda dulled the natural flavours of the seafood. The presentation, however, was unique and well-crafted. Next, was the 6 ""rolls"" that came out. And I put the rolls in quotation marks because they really just give you parts of a roll and expect that to be enough. Two rolls were put into rice paper rather than nori, which gave it an interesting texture, and were probably the best ones on the plate. One roll was wrapped in cucumber and was fairly tasteless and underwhelming. The deep fried roll tasted like oil and wasn't very good at all. Again, in the rolls, mayo was overused and masked the natural flavours of fish. The restaurant had a really cool vibe and was really quite busy. Service was good. The food was interesting, but overpriced. I literally could have ordered a single roll at a different sushi restaurant and have been more full and paid less than I did with this tasting menu. I would not come here again. If it weren't for the nice little restaurant setting and the good service, I'd be giving this place a 2/5."

/user_details?userid=T90SZi0rgZYbHljrDsb3sA,Dimitri D.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"By far some of the best sushi I've tasted in Montreal, especially for the price.At first you may be taken aback by the prices but once you actually try the sushi you'll realize it is very reasonably priced.Their shrimp tempura is very good, lightly fried and not too heavy. All of their rolls are amazing. A particular favorite of mine is their cucumber wrapped roll. I forget what was inside, but the originality of using cucumber as an exterior shell for a maki roll is lovely. It makes for an incredibly fresh roll that is super satisfactory. Additionally, their fried rolls are also great because the batter is very light; you will as though you could eat an unlimited amount and go on and on. Or is that just me? My stomach is now throbbing with an ache to eat.But I digress... Their sashimi is good and fresh, served with a light vinaigrette that only accentuates the tender fish. The slices of julienne apples add a nice crunch to the dish, balancing the acidity as well as pulverizing your taste buds... in a good way, of course!A standout menu item is their tartare. Lobster, salmon, tuna... all remarkably delicious, made with some nice seasoning and served on a rice cracker. The best of the three, in my opinion, is the tuna tartare. When you leave, you will seriously regret not jumping over the bar and coercing the employees to sell you a container filled with this stupefying delight. No lies, no exaggerations.Unfortunately, the restaurant does not have a liquor license. I would have loved some warm sake to accompany the array of flavors that my palate succumbed to (this has saddened me the four times I have visited Saint). Luckily, you can order some green tea (Genmaicha, for those of you who do not know -- a Japanese green tea with popped rice), which is an acceptable pairing for the sushi. Still, I guess it makes sense for them to not have a liquor license, considering the limited seating capacity of the restaurant.That being said, be sure to make reservations at least a few days in advance! I have never been for lunch, but I'm sure that would be as awesome as supper. Also, I must mention that the staff is super nice and the decor is simple but homey. You immediately feel comfortable and right at home. I have never sat at the bar but it seems like it is a fun location.I love this place."

Then again the next night around the same time, but this time we could not get a seat and there was a 45 min wait for a to-go order due to how busy they were. So, we came back on Friday at 4:30 pm to make sure we could get a seat. The early Friday visit was the best since the place was not busy and we could talk with the staff.

On the other hand, if you want to have sushi and you're not the biggest fan of raw fish, this might be better for you. They have a tasting menu that's not on their menu, so make sure to ask your server about it if your'e interested - I had the tasting menu, and I think it's worth a try, because you get a lot more than ordering a la carte.

When we got there, we got seated fairly quickly and were served really well. As first-timers, we got recommended the tasting menu ($25 ea, tax in), which was a delicious 3-course assortment of 14 different pieces (2 sashimi, 2 christmas trees, and 10 rolls).Being able to see the chefs prepare the food in front of us, we saw the care that went into the sushi itself and the presentation of each plate. The chef was really friendly too, and made small talk with us as we were waiting for our food. The sushi wowed me as it came, and tasted as great as it looked. I'm not very good at describing food aside from saying that it's yummy, but I'd like to say that the variety in the rolls was really enjoyable, and each kind of roll had a distinct, flavourful taste to it.Overall, it was a great experience. The price is great (even cheaper than AYCE dinners) and the food is delicious and filling. Definitely recommended for anyone stopping by the area looking for some great food to eat."

They had very unique, fusion style dipping sauces.They managed to sit ~35 and fit 5-6 staffers with an open kitchen into a space that isn't much larger than most living rooms. But they did it with a cheerful and welcoming air. The cheerful ambiance manages to meld the eclectic decor of bull fights, Chinese tigers and Indian gods into a warm and welcoming space where the cooks and wait staff are dancing to the music and did't hesitate to interact with the patrons.

The rolls are just from heaven. Some are rice free (it's so rare to see rice free good rolls!! Not that I don't like rice, but too much is not good since it's high glycemic index). Will definitely make it a goto place when I am in Montreal."

Even the omokase (which means ""chef's choice menu"") is the same! It's not the chef choice, it's Tri's choice. Just go to the original one if you like this kind of sushi.In either places, after the tasting menu we were still hungry. Everything taste the same with the rice crispy mix which is good but after eating the same thing in every order, we kind of got sick of it.Also, if you are looking for an authentic japanese sushi place, this is not the place either.In the end, I'd rather either go to a cheaper sushi place or save my money for the authentic one."

In fact, it's pretty much a carbon copy of Tri Express. It turns out that the chef had previously worked for 6 years at Tri Express before opening his own restaurant. My wife and I went for the tasting menu, which is not listed on the menu. At 20$ per person, it's a great deal although I wasn't full at the end of my meal.I enjoyed my meal although I felt bad that the chef blatantly copied another restaurant. I tried to enjoy my meal for what it is: a playful interpretation of sushi. Japanese natives would probably not believe what happened to their beloved sushi. The focus is not on the freshness of the fish. In fact, I could sometimes barely tell what kind of fish I was eating. An extra star for the music soundtrack that was playing. 80s music is awesome!"

The experience started out wonderfully with a warm welcome from the two sushi saints...one behind the sushi bar, one serving. We went with the off-menu option of a 3-course tasting meal, which was DELICIOUS and beautifully presented and just the right size for lunch. The selections are music-inspired so be sure to ask about the story behind the names. They were happy to accommodate my dairy allergy.The fish was all really fresh and delicious, and the rice perfectly cooked. As other reviewers have mentioned, go with an open mind because it's not traditional sushi resto fare. I'm not usually a fan of ""fusion"" cuisine, which can so often cover up the delicate flavours of tasty tasty raw fish, but not so in this case. I'd be hard-pressed to choose a favourite. The Bob Marley roll (in a rice paper wrapper) was crunchy from cucumber and fish roe, soft from avocado and salmon, and oh so delicious. The enoki mushrooms in the Beatles roll were so cute! (Yes, I admit it's strange that I find mushrooms cute...but...there we are). Posted prices include taxes, mes ami(e)s, so if you look up the menu online, keep that in mind. It's 15% less expensive than you think.And yes, everybody on Yelp is right, the green tea with rice is really yummy."

I enjoy sushi and sashimi of all kinds, but this was some of the best I have ever eaten. PROS:  I enjoyed the owner and his business partner/also a chef... their story and passion was refreshing.  The food is excellent and the presentation is amazing artwork.  The green tea is divine! CONS:  It's not a traditional sushi bar, if that's what you're looking for (ordering pieces, etc.), but if you're wanting something different in the world of sushi you will enjoy this tremendously.

/user_details?userid=Ro00qQOG5fIrFCXMStjzrQ,Nicolas C.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place serves the best sushi I've ever had. The fish is always super fresh, and the rolls are brilliantly creative and incredibly tasty. Plus, the staff are some of the nicest, warmest and most genuinely welcoming folks I've ever encountered in a resto. They're super passionate and enthusiastic about what they do too, which really heightens both the food and the experience overall. My only complaint is that the place gets PACKED, and it necessarily takes a while to get food when it does, even if you're just getting takeout, and there isn't even room to stand around while you wait when it fills up like that (most evenings). Still, if you can sneak in when it's quieter, it's one of the best places to eat in the city, and for a fraction of the price of comparatively impressive sushi places."

I wanted to go back the next day and am so sad I don't live in Montreal to go regularly!!I'm from New Jersey and I am an avid sushi eater (when I can and when it isn't so expensive). I noticed a review from a New Yorker (some of the best sushi in America can be found there) so I had a hunch we would find something great. My boyfriend and I stopped in Montreal for one night on a road trip and, boy, did we choose the right place. (Thank you yelp and Mike D!!)Innovative, flavorful, meticulously crafted food. Friendly, passionate, happy, local chef and workers. Not really cheap, not really expensive - for example, the bf and I got the sampler so it was expensive but we got a massive amount of DELICIOUS, mouth-watering food. Side note: Got to talking to the chef and employees after we ate because we ended up eating until after closing. The chef has traveled a lot, including to Jamaica, using his travels and sort of, let's say, meditative, spiritual beliefs to influence and bring passion to his food. All the people that work there are family or long-time friends. AND they offered to show us a good local bar to go to afterwards for our one and only night in Montreal.All in all a great local establishment you really want to support, and when you do you get the benefits of incredible food."

This is not your usual sushi place. It was packed with a younger crowd, and there was a 5 to 10 min wait because we had no reservations. I have to say the sushi tasting ""secret menu"" was just great!  IT is a family run business, and the sushi makers are an international bunch, but there was at least one Japanese individual from what I could tell. I usually avoid sushi and sashimi bars if I see anybody but Japanese behind the bar. In my experience the Japanese sushi makers have a particular feel for the quality  and freshness of the fish, I guess it is because they grow with it. The sushi sample was outstanding. We also ordered sashimi, and it was good and fresh.The place is not expensive, but they need to explain the prices more clearly. We were charged 19.95 per person, which is fine, as our usual trips to sushi/sashimi bars is always over 50 dollars per person, but the waitress was talking about a $22 sampler. Maybe they need to talk to each other more, because we were served by three different people. This place is new and does not have an alcohol license, so we had to stop by another bar to have some sake, otherwise the experience is not complete ))))"

You get a little sample of what the menu has to offer. If not, then you should at least get the christmas trees. I could eat these for days. Everyone that works there is very pleasant and have great attitudes. By the way, the music they played this evening was on point and straight from the 90s! Such a great atmosphere here!"

That is when i realised why i love so much to eat at Saint sushi: not only the food is AMASING, but the staff there is what makes me come back again and again. Each and every one of the staff members are unic in thier own way. They make you feel as authentic as them.  They are the cherry on the sunday, they are the brand themselves.

I take it that the menu might change around somewhat frequently, but the ""tasting menu"" seems like a good option, if you want something of a surpise.

But I was really in the mood for sushi, and the 2 reviews Saint had were both very impressive, so I decided to give it a try. That was the best restaurant-related decision I've made in a long time. This place is a perfect sushi restaurant. It is quaint (only about 15-20 seats), and it has a cool atmosphere (good music at the right volume).  It is run by two long-time friends, one the chef, the other the server. They interact nicely with the small crowd; friendly, conversational, and attentive without being annoying. And the sushi is amazing (at a surprisingly low price). Very creative arrangements.  Everything I had was excellent.  I ordered ""The Clyde"", a mixture of sushi and rolls chosen by the chef that came with a salad and an appetizer, all for just $22. The rolls included various mixtures of tuna, salmon, tempura, mango, avocado, scallions, and more. And they came with a special yogurt sauce that was as tasty as the rest of the meal.  But the best of all was the ""Christmas trees"" appetizer. A stack of lobster mixed with tempura and scallions, served on a rice chip. I could have had a meal of just those and been very happy.

Attentive but not hovering staff, the right sized menu selection, and quality cuts of fish. When I hear about Montreal's cuisine, it's usually about French food, fatty cuts of pork, duck confit, foie gras, etc. I never thought to look up a sushi place, but the urge hit us so we went to the highest rated place around us. I didn't know what the expect with the Sapin de Noel (x-mas tree) but was surprised by how much flavor was tucked into these little things! They went perfectly with a tiny bit of the creamy sauce they provide on the side and a dab of soy sauce."

We ordered the tasting menu, which is a funny name since everything tasted the same. They gave us several different pieces, which they give pop-star names (since they can't name them the actual fish, like every other sushi place). They all had the same mayo-and-smashed-tuna taste. I think they only use 1 fish but to be honest you can't even taste that because it just tastes like mayo.This was the #1 rated sushi restaurant on Yelp in Montreal, and honestly, this is by far the most help has failed me."

That's indeed the perfect sushi for those who doesn't know what sushi is all about. It's an American and not a Japanese sushi place. it's the equivalent of going to pizza hat to eat pizza . those creations such as the Maki rolls with funny names and the Christmas tree are made of yesterday's or probably last 3 days fish leftovers with plenty of aroma and spices to mask the freshness of the fish or the lack of it in this case, I have spent enough time in Japan to know what I'm talking about. One other thing;the interior design  is awful , touristic peaces from Thailand mixed with an ugly painting of a Spanish Taurus fighter with golden frame !!. Now the worst of all is that the chefs are using bare hands to prepare food and one can see them touching their mouth or nose , one of them actually sneezed. however the service is good and the manager is friendly and that's why I added one more star .

After reading the reviews here, we decided to try Saint Sushi Bar on 8/30/2014. I'm a bonafide sushi-snob, but I can honestly say that this sushi is the best I've ever eaten. Hands down. The Tasting Menu was recommended to us and it's by far one of the best decisions of my life. The sushi was fresh, and the flavors were unbelievable. The chefs can accommodate most palates in the tasting menu. We decided to try raw and non-raw options. Included in the tasting menu was also a salad and another starter (can't remember the name, but they are pictured here on Yelp--the little thingys on crackers). The chefs were a lot of fun too (shout out to Ralph) and it's obvious that they put a lot of detail into the sushi and most of all enjoy what they do. I also enjoyed the music that was playing too. Ralph told me it was a collection of all the chefs playlist-so you will hear old-school, new school and everything in between. It really makes for fun experience. Will definitely go back when I return to Montreal."
/user_details?userid=epTZdURH3GUk6bY2mN2hdg,Kristen G.,"College Park, MD",5 star rating,"This is some of the best sushi I've ever had! It was so good, in fact, we came here twice during our three-day visit to Montreal (we had to bring our friends too!) The sushi maker definitely knows his stuff, and he bears the mark of a true creative chef - someone who is able to walk the line being doing what is classic/tried and true and incorporating his own distinctive flavors without veering into fusion disaster. In addition to being downright delicious, the sushi was beautiful; the rolls look like some kind of fantasy garden from Alice in Wonderland. We watched him assemble some of his rolls for a birthday party delivery, and he took as much care carving and sculpting as a visual artist in his studio. I live in a large urban area (Washington, DC) so I do have fairly good sushi often. But as further confirmation of its quality, when our friends arrived from L.A. to meet us, we insisted they try it. They were not convinced, as they have some of the best sushi in the U.S. out there. But when the food came, they were sufficiently impressed. They also agreed it was some of the best they'd ever had.And the prices are a steal - $46 for a tasting menu that included a starter, something like 8 or 10 rolls, and tea! In D.C. the same menu would cost at least $75. I don't remember which items we had, but all of it was good; I would order any one of the rolls again. The Sapin de Noel (""Christmas tree"") appetizer in particular is not to be missed. I had dreams about it afterwards. The staff is bilingual, so no language barriers at this restaurant for either French or English speakers. To top it off, the servers and the sushi chef were both really friendly and helpful.  We needed directions to the next place we were going, and they went to a lot of trouble to find it for us with their phones, and walked us through every turn, even drawing us a paper map to take with us. This will definitely be a regular stop for me when I come to Montreal, and that's saying a lot because Montreal has some great food!"

The food itself deserved at very most a 3-star review but the rudeness of the owner/chef just blew me away. I am an avid Montreal eater and have worked in the food industry for over 10 years and have never faced such defensive behaviour. I ordered the salad, which on the menu said contained julienned papayas, and when I inquired with the very polite waiter about it, the owner blew up at me from across the kitchen and said ""I decided not to put them in."" When I gently replied that they should perhaps warn their customers that the menu has changed, he snapped at me making all sorts of random excuses. I said ok, no problem and continued eating. He shouted, again from across the restaurant that he would remove 1$ off our 47$ bill. Ok. We said ok. After the bill was paid, he continued harassing me, questioning my knowledge of the restaurant industry and attacking me with snarky comments. This is not acceptable. I could not believe it. I will not condone this behaviour from a restaurant and I pity the staff who need to work with this overblown ego of a man. As for the food, the salad was sopping in sauce, she sushi was no better than anywhere else, and the bill was 47$ for two people, for lunch. Go if you like, but I would stand in solidarity against such a vicious place."

I ordered the sampler that was a three course sushi meal that covered a lot of different things on the menu. All 3 courses were phenomenal and the fish was incredibly fresh. People with previous experience with Japanese food would enjoy Saint Sushi, but a newcomer to sushi may have trouble with the specific menu. Overall a great experience and highly recommended."

We had little hope in finding a table, but the host/waiter was incredibly kind and accommodating and said he would have a free table in about ten minutes. My group and I headed out and walked around for a while before returning to the restaurant. The party whose table we would take was settling up so we just hung around outside and waited for a bit longer. We had not been waiting long at all and were not frustrated in the least but the same host/waiter that greeted us came outside and offered us a complimentary sample of their signature ""Christmas Tree"" appetizer. It's basically a seafood tartare with great flavor on top of a rice cracker. Not long after, we were invited in and sat next to the window. The menu was in French, which made things a bit complicated, so we decided to get the 3 person sampler which comes to about 20 bucks a person. HOLY CRAP WAS THIS AN AWESOME DEAL. It started was a round of sashimi, then more of the ""Christmas Trees"" describes before, and a massive plate of sushi to share. Everything was absolutely delicious and we left with full bellies, full wallets, and an urge to write a kick ass review.

Looking at the Yelp reviews ahead of time wasn't sure what $22 would get you, but the quality of the fare was on the level of a hundred dollars a head tasting menus and the friendly chefs and staff made it a superb experience. Dig the cool kung fu hip hop vibe they got going too. In passing praise to the owner he said that they wanted to make a place people love going to - mission accomplished, judging by how everyone else there seemed to be having the se quality experience. Particular stand outs were the rice cracker business they have and the chefs checking in to tweak things even closer to individual tastes. Highly recommended."

The furniture looks like something out of ""The Krusty Krab"" but it ends up just letting you know you are in on the joke. This is not some hi-tech, over conceptualized sushi bar. It's a bunch of people who are passionate in what they do and their love is reflected in every dish. They couldn't be more helpful, service was thoughtful and timely. Will defiantly go back and would highly recommend."

/user_details?userid=W74GQTFKjLjQPtFc6m-N5g,Kathy R. D.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,I was very pleasantly surprised by Saint Sushi Bar. This is not your typical sushi restaurant. It is like sushi and fusion food mixed together in the best possible way. I got the tasting menu and shrimp tempura. The shrimp tempura was incredible it came with a sweet sauce and wasn't to greasy tasting. The sashimi was not to my taste because i did not like the sauce it was smothered and the miso soup was kind of bland. Get the Christmas tree. It is some kind of seafood tower on a rice cracker and is delicious. The sushi is incredible ~ the best in the city. Try everything and enjoy!

/user_details?userid=zK3TsUvyfmjT2cg1-LourA,Benjamin H.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"Tasting menu at $22 per person was absolutely fantastic! Let the chef take control, it's the way to go. Fresh ingredients, well-presented, and the staff were super friendly and efficient. As mentioned in other reviews we loved the music, as well. The perfect summer treat in a really cool neighborhood. Can't praise this place enough!"
/user_details?userid=bBBEo6tgd4xqrwmLs2My7A,Julia S.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This restaurant we decided to try since last Friday(August  5th, 2016) and finally we tried today on a Wednesday for lunch is absolutely disappointing. Maybe our expectations were too high since it was so difficult for us to go there and try to eat- it was either full or closed and we tried 3 times before we could eat there today, it turned out was not worth at all. Why? We went there during lunch time and it was very quite, the place is petit and clean with a mix of oriental decorations(from my observation it was more leaning to Thai style than Japanese), which I thought it was a very high end Japanese sushi restaurant(from all the high rating and comments), the staff was nice, and their food was surprisingly ordinary-chef selected sushi special for lunch came out to be only 2 different kind sushi maki roll cut into 12 pieces and plus 2 shrimp sushi, in total of 14 pieces for 19.25$. I understand lunch menu can be slightly different on a week day but this is not how they should treat the customers-even in a regular sushi shop or sushi man a chain for take out sushi which is made very fast) they serve more than 2 different kind of sushi in a box has 14 pieces and cheaper than 19.25$. Overprice for ordinary food is unacceptable, seriously. There should be difference between food chain restaurants and actual restaurant-why should I come here and pay this much money if I can get better food in a food court for lower price?"

We all got the chef special which was a tasting and it was amazing. Also I have to commend them on the great service. I'll definitely be coming back here.

/user_details?userid=OsV8Lq50NEojwpOKrQtQXw,Elena S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This is a fantastic, intimate, new sushi restaurant in Montreal.  It will be on our regular rotation from now on.  It's a different twist on sushi, but with all of the familiar fish and flavors.  The owners really believe in quality over all-you-can-eat quantity, but you won't go away hungry.  The fish is fresh, expertly served, and so tasty you'll find yourself pushing away the usual soy sauce and wasabi accompaniments (says a wasabi fiend).  The rolls are inventive, and the chef has a lot up his sleeve. Among the pleasant surprises: The sashimi with apples plate is similar to a carpaccio (thin slices of fish in a dressing with julienned apples) and the 'christmas trees' are kind of a spicy lobster tartare. Also, the regular scallop sashimi slices were served between lime slices, giving it a slight citrus flavor, which was refreshing paired with the yogurt/coconut milk dipping sauce.  All this for about $25 pp.  We were hesitant to try the chef's choice prefix menu, but I will choose it without hesitation next time."
