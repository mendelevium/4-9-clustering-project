/user_details?userid=qcOBxbehz8U0BF6O9BfdVw,Wei W.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,What a cute date spot! I came in alone for dinner because I just got into town and was starving for pho. The atmosphere was very romantic and hip - as all things are at Miles End! The service was great (I sat at the bar) and the pho was delicious!
/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,Risa D.,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",5 star rating,"Had such an awesome meal here last night I had to update my review again. The fried wontons were light and crispy and meaty, and the spicy sauce they were in was mad delicious. We also shared the warm, shredded beef salad which had all kinds of crispy texture and great taste; and the curry which was creamy and comforting and amazing. We sat at the bar for hours laughing with the kind and interested staff, enjoying delicious cava with our meal, and loving the chill ease of the room. I've fallen back in love with Cafeden and I'm so pleased about it."

Great service, great food (the papaya salad was cap fresh and flavourful), reasonable prices and great vibes! I'd strongly suggest to check this place out. Pleasantly surprised!"
/user_details?userid=1JxVvMkDcFLQfupnsqWKKA,Jonathan L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This trendy little eatery blends a hip atmosphere with vietnamese fusion, small plate style. The food was quite good, though many of the dishes we ordered had a similar hoisin sauce taste--nevertheless quite good.The prices are on the higher end for what you receive: $13 Pho with a meagre amount of ingredients; $3 spring rolls; small appetizer-style plates for $10-$15 each. Definitely go as a group and share different foods. I had a sense while we dined that we could get this meal down the street at a family restaurant for half the price.I had some of the cocktails which were okay but nothing I would run back for. Considering there are myriad vietnamese restaurants in this neck of the woods, you're paying extra for the decor and experience at Cafeden. Not a terrible place though. I think I would go with a client or visiting family member who prefers a trendy spot to family-run kitchen."
/user_details?userid=Mt7q9U48KiAJKivYRB5vog,Corinne R.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We were sitting in Vices & Versa, peering across the street. Our tummies grumbled. We needed to eat. Cafeden? Cafeden. Done. Jay-walked our way over into an empty resto and quickly realized it was vietnamese. Pho on a -20c Feb day? Sign. Me. Up.This place is beautiful...definitely a step in the opposite direction from the florescent lighting and cold environs that your go-to pho spot entails. Super cute, really nice barman and bar-bros cooking the night's eats. We were advised that tonight (Mardi...and Mercredi aussi!) they have their speciale: Spicy Beef Pho. Let me tell you, in all my years of inter-provinical pho-eating, no pho holds a candle to this one. Spicy Beef. Oxtail. Shrimp paste. Diakon. These boys don't even let you near the Siracha or that mystery brown sauce, because they know that their spicy beef broth is perfection. They're right. Also - nearly forgot to mention - they use a teeny slender noodle (think vermicelli). A delightful surprise!We ate. We marvelled and sat in awe at the soup before us. It may be a touch pricey ($12) for pho, but it's a whole different jam and it deserves and demands your attention. Please go pho it up, tell all your friends, lovers, enemies. We all need this little resto in our lives."

Also can't resist the pho. It is damn good. A modern spin on the classic bowl of noodle goodness served up with fresh herbs, bean sprouts, chilis and beef.Design interior is ultra modern without trying hard. Staff are great and service is just the right amount of attentive."
/user_details?userid=lS_ikZYU_EJpbdVqYxP4mg,Cara M.,"Claremont, CA",5 star rating,"This was definitely the best pho I have ever had, and quite possible one of the best meals I have ever had - bordering on an orgasmic gastronomic experience! The papaya salad was also out of this world. What an amazing culinary experience they have created at Cafeden. Bravo!!!!"
/user_details?userid=KYV3TpJiJB2LGN9umfmsHg,Shirley D.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"A Vietnamese cafe?? Yes! Finally! A good place to go for drinks, coffee (especially their own version of Vietnamese coffee), and some pho. It's definitely got a trendy feel to it with open kitchen concept and awesome/friendly service. Definitely a must visit if you're in the Little Italy neighborhood. I highly recommend the Vietnamese iced coffee, it's not as bitter or strong as the typical VIet coffee, rather it has a more mild taste. But! Don't underestimate its caffeine content. Had that thing at 8 30 and could not sleep till later in the morning...yikes!I will definitely come back to try their Vietnamese panna cotta and other dishes!"

We went there for New Year's Eve, and despite being booked, the owner personally was able to accommodate us for a delicious dinner. Caitlin had the fried calamari and side salad which were both delicious and I had the pho with banh bao. The pho was 3.9/5 and the banh bao was so good!  The atmosphere of this place is also very cool and modern - great place for a date night!"
/user_details?userid=LGWjAnlyKq0cKiWGhF7K4w,Laila V.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Great place for a fun night out with friends, with great food. We shared the ceviche, beef tataki, papaya salad, chicken wings and the buns. Big winner: beef tataki! It's a touch choice however, papaya salad was delicious: fresh and just spicy enough. Buns were also a runner up. Every dish was filled will flavor. To make things even better, service is professional, friendly yet casual.Merci!"

/user_details?userid=tHzFnfwQQzW9TU2uJlgtNw,KJ L.,"Basel, Switzerland",3 star rating,I really have no idea why this place is rated so well. We went there on a weekday night because most other Vietnamese restaurants were closed and this one was rated well. Ordered summer roll and pho. The summer rolls were quite small and just OK. The pho was expensive and the portion was pathetic. There was very little meat in it and the soup was so plain. It was literally the worst pho I've ever had. I was still very hungry after eating there so we decided to go to a McDonald's nearby. The service was alright. The waiter was calling at the back of the restaurants and we waited for 5 minutes before he finally finished calling so that we could get the check. Will never come back.

/user_details?userid=SPDS8hAGK-bj9Fql1Tp3aw,Milena P.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Ahhh what a lovely evening I had in that small place. The food is very good, the stuff is friendly, the waiter was always there when I needed him. It's a very cozy place, perfect spot for a date night or girls get together. Good wine as well. It's at the beginning of little Italy so it's easy to find parking. And their soup is to die for, it's made by someone's Vietnamese grandma,mmmm I wish I lived closer to them, it's that good."
/user_details?userid=Y_8Z_GHldJE3PED2jroAUQ,Femmes F.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This place is a little Montreal gem that not enough people know about. It's Vietnamese food, but in a classy way. The space is stunning, beautifully designed. Fantastic service, the waiter is always there. And of course the food is spectacular. The beef and porc buns are among the best I ever had. I would have to strongly recommend as well the gyozas as an appetizer. And for dessert do yourself a favour and have the rose water cake it's unbelievable!"
