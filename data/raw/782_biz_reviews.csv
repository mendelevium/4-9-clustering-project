/user_details?userid=rWow8_IlnmSGlu9Ha2sA2g,Avichal C.,"Philadelphia, PA",5 star rating,"On the Monday afternoon of the Labor day weekend when most places were closed, this was one of then only open places so we made a days for it. It was packed and had a huge line but fortunately the queue was moving quickly and we probably got our table in less than 30 minutes.Even after being super busy, the servers served us water and complimentary coffee less than 60 seconds after us sitting. 5 points for that. The menu is extensive! Really extensive! So it took us some time to decide what we want which the servers anticipated, so they took their time as well. After placing the order, it did take a lot more than we expected (probably cause the kitchen was extremely busy), but when the food came it was definitely worth it. The poached eggs were perfect. The sausages and crepes also tasted pretty amazing. It wasn't even too expensive. We left feeling like we couldn't eat anything else for the rest of the day."
/user_details?userid=mZXyswhshLyttKGTkjqg4w,Esther C.,"Richmond Hill, Canada",5 star rating,This restaurant was close to where our hotel was so  my husband and I decided to give it a try! We came to Montreal from Toronto for a Valentine's Day mini trip! The food was delicious! Service was great too! There was a 10 minute wait for us and a waiter gave us a small cup of freshly squeezed orange juice to drink! That was definitely a plus! The portion was huge! There is also a nice selection of juices too. I'll come back here again next year when I return!
/user_details?userid=mWcS4rFDDJOVMVuER-Cqzw,Emily P.,"New York, NY",5 star rating,"While delirious and on no sleep, we were desperate for a place to refuel with coffee and food. L'Oeufrier was close enough from the bus station and had decent ratings. We sat down at the table closest to the kitchen. Our place mats were a menu for their shakes, smoothies, and mega shakes with toppings like a whole waffle. Their actual menu resembled kind of like a comic book on the cover. They had many pages because they serve everything for breakfast apparently! To drink, we had a cappuccino and regular cafe filtre. To eat, we had the Italian eggs Benedict and the Je Me Souviens. I took a bite of the Italian eggs Benedict and holy sh**, it was amazing! The Je Me Souviens literally was a giant plate of different breakfast foods. The French toast was AMAZING. The white toast with butter was amazing too surprisingly! I finished every last bit of food on my plate, including the fruit. I'll definitely return whenever I'm in Montréal."
/user_details?userid=ncAOj5Xz-XS6bpSnTWp3tQ,Austin G.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"Despite being a chain, L'Oeufrier is a darn good brunch. It's set up like a more fancy diner with the best service we had while dining in Montreal. The staff were friendly, attentive, and efficient! The menu is HUGE with all types of crepes, sandwiches, omelets, cocktails, coffee, etc. I ordered the grand breakfast and the portions came out HUGE! On my plate came two eggs, two pieces of toast, potatoes, sausage, bacon, and a MASSIVE crepe filled with Nutella, bananas, and strawberries. Everything was delicious!If you need a reliable quality brunch experience, this is your spot!"

We were lucky that we didn't have to wait in the line, because there was a line up afterwards. Service is so good, the servers were offering mini orange juice to customers while they wait. Our waitress was really good and efficient too. Coffee was served within the minutes, but It tasted dry , so it was average.Food was ordered, and they arrived promptly. My whole family enjoyed their dishes. Personally, I had vegetarian egg poutine breakfast; it was delicious... potatoes slightly overcooked though. Lovely restaurant, at at lovely spot, with good service... definitely recommended!"
/user_details?userid=9tIjFbmboV3ioyng_G2Pgg,Sirena W.,"Hatfield Township, PA",3 star rating,"I want to like this place more than I did. I honestly do but the food, the service, the ambience was mediocre. Duck Confit Benedict - kind of bland, duck was on the drier side, egg was more well done than I'd like. Patiti - no complaints; a good crispy but nothing special. On the plus side, the fruit was fresh and sweet!Generally, I find smaller restaurants cozy. The interior was cute but this place felt a bit cramped. The tables were so close together it was difficult to maneuver around without feeling like I was going to hit someone in the face with my bag. I came here a little after noon on Saturday and some how immediately managed to snag a two seat table. There was definitely a table wait for groups of four and more though. It was busy enough that the servers weren't able to attend to us in a timely manner and even forgot about us a few times. Personally, this place isn't worth a wait but is okay otherwise. By the time we finished, the restaurant had pretty much cleared out."
/user_details?userid=P0eTj4azE3vaMkI4mmDFrw,Curt T.,"San Diego, CA",5 star rating,Another excellent meal. The Mac and cheese with the egg on top was super delicious. Make sure you keep your spoon to scoop up the sauce at the bottom of your bowl. It's finger licking good!!!Best Mac and cheese I've had ever....the egg on top really added to the dish along with the ricotta cheese.HIGHLY recommend a stop here if you're ever in Montreal!!!

I came in on a weekday for brunch and even then it was pretty crowded, which says a lot about the food! I ordered the Le Gran Gourmand and was in heaven. Im usually conflicted as to whether i want savory or sweet and this meal became my favorite brunch experience because i didnt have to choose. My dish came with mouth watering sausage and bacon, perfectly cooked eggs, crispy potatoe slices and a beautiful crepe. Only thing is that service can be quite slow so if you're looking for a quick meal, this might not be the place."
/user_details?userid=9DfRpSUCek69v98bqkRs6w,Heather M.,"New York, NY",4 star rating,Food is really good. Highly recommend if you are looking for a good spot that serves great breakfast. I had the Bene Joe Biche which was great. The fact that they actually have FREEH SQUEEZED JUICES esp Fresh squeezed grapefruit juice is the best! I almost never see that anywhere anymore.
/user_details?userid=SGrcsnOv6NzaZA10S4Q6SA,Alexandra G.,"Quincy, MA",5 star rating,"My fiance, friends and I ventured up to Montreal for the week for my birthday. After a night of heavy drinking, this place was the absolute thing my soul needed.Upon arriving, there was a small line out the door with a few parties of 2-3 people. We waited around 35 minutes for a table, which wasn't the worst I've waited for some breakfast especially around 11 am. They specialize in egg dishes, in case you couldn't tell. Their eggs benedict dishes are awesome. We also ordered one of their giant Nutella crepes for the table to split, and were a bit put back when the guy was like 'ARE YOU SURE'? We thought it was going to be some small thing - NO. The crepe was like the size of a newborn! The portions at this place are insanely big and reasonable for the cost.For anyone going to Montreal, this place is a must."
/user_details?userid=JzP5uJjhZb0Vj8J_bn3mOg,Gwen W.,"Columbus, OH",5 star rating,"Holy hell, what a breakfast! This breakfast/lunch restaurant is quaint. White walls, two brick side walls, black accents, metal duct-work ceiling. Local artists' paintings adorning the walls - not to mention bold bright color palettes. Floor to ceiling windows make for great people watching!We got there after the main morning rush apparently, seeing as there was only one server gentleman and two other patrons. The gentleman was very polite. Gave us time to look over the menu, which is quite full seeing as they cover two meals of the day. The place mat houses pictures and descriptions of their fresh squeezed juices and smoothies. Prep yourself, friends. These entrees are quite large! And, talk about striving for your five food groups! I got the Salmon Benedict dish. Another solid, very tasty meal! The salmon was fresher than the usual Ohio fare. Montreal uses Yukon golden potatoes, so anything with spuds automatically has a wonderful, almost ""sweet"" taste. Much fuller flavor than the regular 'ol white plain janes. My dish was incredible. The flavors were spot on. Loved the sautéed onions and green pepper beneath the salmon. Yolk was over easy, sopped it up with the warm soft yet crunchy edged English muffin. The fresh fruit cup was a meal in itself. Cold, juicy and sweeeeeet!This establishment will remain bookmarked for my next return trip here, no doubt. The excellent quality, matched with a very reasonable price point. The only thing that bums me is I can't bring this place closer to home."
/user_details?userid=-9X63yvBKJyOaQzP-Clvkw,Frances C.,"San Francisco, CA",3 star rating,"Super cute interior, but food was just so-so for me. I came here with a few friends and waited for probably around half an hour to an hour on a Saturday afternoon. The staff was super friendly and offered orange juice samples while we were waiting.Once we were seated, I order the classic eggs benedict. I knew that this would be great because most places make this right so that's why I ordered it. I wasn't the fan of the eggs as they were practically over cooked. As well, the hollandaise sauce wasn't as flavourful as I'm used to other places. Lastly, the hashbrowns/ potatoes weren't my favourite. It was too dry for me. My favourite would be the drink that I ordered. It was a green juice that was so good! Super refreshing and yummy! Service was amazing tho! The staff was super friendly! I personally wouldn't come back because I didn't enjoy the food much."
/user_details?userid=q8zJlNacZ7IVGZMUSX5vcA,Simcha T.,"Newport News, VA",4 star rating,"I wanted to have breakfast that was within walking distance from my AirBnb, so L'Oeufrier it was. I had the Le Mini Gourmand, which was 2 eggs however you like, bacon OR sausage, and a little crepe with bananas and nutella. It is served with a slice of melon, and some homestyle potatoes.I thought the potatoes were a bit bland, but everything else was delightful and felt like a well portioned breakfast. The coffee was good too. Rating 4 stars because I think the service could have been a bit warmer and the ambiance was a little lacking. Good location and good food."
/user_details?userid=BCp4aBWrDd5pMTynN1S9Og,Arnold T.,"Point Loma, San Diego, CA",4 star rating,"Agreed on the previous review being a cozy place.  We got seated quickly but after a while we saw a line forming outside to get in. The place was very busy considering it was Pride weekend. The menu is in French so we had to do a little decrypting. I ended up with the Eggs Benedict with 2 types of sausages....surprise! I thought after being in Montreal for a few days I would know how to decipher the French menu...wrong. I thought I was getting chorizo...or maybe I did but looked and tasted different.  Despite this, the food was good considering I don't like Italian sausage. Definitely more edible than the American version. I only gave it 4 stars because I thought Allo Mon Coco was better."

/user_details?userid=YYB_BOY3oHV2yOwOWMcD4A,Kwame S.,"New York, NY",3 star rating,"""So sweet to eat"" (Actually, this  would be a 3.5 star review)I came here because I wanted a sugary breakfast, because you have to treat yourself and it was near my local Airbnb. Also, this was one of the few places that had a ""late"" brunch menu on a Monday morning (around 11:50am). The place itself was cute, but the food was kind of average. I mean, it was good but it was nothing that I have not had before. The menu is pretty extensive and the restaurant seems to have pretty much everything, so I  if you come with a group of people, then everyone will find something that they like. Also, the restaurant has a great selection of various fruit smoothies. I decided to sit outside, since it was a nice fall day (by NYC standards). If you are allergic to bees then you should definitely sit indoors, because of the chocolate and syrup there were quite a bit of bees outside. A couple landed in my smoothie. I ordered the Choco-gaufre - a half waffle with nutella and strawberries, two eggs, bacon or sausage, and toast (about 13.50 CAD) . . . I added a side of potatoes, like I said earlier, treat yourself. The food was kind of cold when it arrived; I don't know if the plate sat in the window, because the service was a little slow. The waitress was really nice and cheerful but the it took a while to order food and for the food to come out. Then, it seemed to take forever to pay for my meal. Since I was outside, I assumed that it was really busy inside. However, when I went in to pay my bill, there were only three tables with people. So, I really do not know what the hold up was. The food was slightly above average but the service was pretty average. I would recommend this place if you are really into nutella and are in the area. I would not come here if this place has a long wait or is out of the way.Oh, one cool this about this place is that they have every single condiment individual packages (ketchups, mayo, peanut butter, sugar, jelly, etc.) that one would need on the table."

It seemed pretty popping in there with a line out the door so I wanted to check it out.I'm giving it 3 stars because the food was not that good to me. Mum ordered the original Eggs Benedicts and I got the Salmon Eggs Benedict, but it didn't sit too well in the stomach for me sadly. The salmon smelled a little too fishy and the food just tasted mediocre. I have a feeling that I ordered the wrong dish at this place. The whole menu was in French and I'm a big fan of Eggs Benedict so that why I ordered that. But it seems to me that what they are known for is there waffles and milkshakes. The tap water tasted funny here too.The fruit that came with the eggs benedict dish though was the bomb! The produce is just in a whole different level in Montreal than it is here in NYC. Maybe I should have just gotten a bowl of fruit salad because that was the highlight of my stay here."

/user_details?userid=HXqLv-55bkbIPyDjdG7yOw,Kev P.,"Brooklyn, Brooklyn, NY",1 star rating,Came here for breakfast when we were in town for a wedding. I didn't get a name but a male with salt and pepper hair took our order. He got my girlfriend's order wrong. She asked for extra cheese on the omelet but it ended up on the side salad somehow. We were out of time for the kitchen to make another order so we asked for it to be removed from the bill. When the check came the order was not removed and he even had the audacity to charge me 20 percent tip when it came time to pay. I am currently disputing this with my credit card company.

They have a large menu filled with several great options. From bagels and benedicts to omelettes and everything in between. I went with the P'tit Gourmand breakfast platter. This platter came with eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, nutella crepe and fruit. Every single item on my plate was absolutely delicious. Everyone at my table was equally impressed with what they got.

This cute little resto offers a wide variety of breakfast options. My friend and I were overwhelmed with the delicious pictures of food but I finally chose the ""Patati: Sao par sur le party"". Two eggs mixed with potatoes, cheese, spinich, tomatoes, mushrooms etc... It was a generous portion served with a side of fruit and bread. My friend had one of their waffles with potatoes and fruit. Our food coma was evidence of a good experience. Everything was really good and despite it being packed the service was fast. Definitely returning to try more off their menu."

I got the waffles with bananas and strawberries and they were really good. Their bacon, potato, and toasts were like most other breakfast places, so no complains there either.

/user_details?userid=JGjtkOtTs8oFg0AhAeyPVA,Rannie B.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"This was my second visit there. The first one was for a quick lunch about a year ago.My lunch was ok, nothing special as their lunch menu is very limited. The service however was horrible. Yes, it was a busy lunch time but the serving staff was completely disorganised. They had forgotten part of my order and I only received it about 10 min. after I finished my plate. I figured, well shit happens and some restaurants have bad days.  I also noticed they had an extensive and very original breakfast menu.I went back there for breakfast today as I was in the area.I wasn't in the mood for anything original and only had the 2 egg, saussage special. My partner had a grill-cheese and the party of 4 at the table besides us tried some of the more original offerings.The food was good but nothing special according to all.The service was however exactly the same as when I went last year.  It took us 2 hours between the time we sat down and the moment we got up, bringing a piece of toast with us cause we just couldn't stand being there any longer.It didn't start well either. We saw a free table at the outside terrace but went inside to ask if we could just sit or they had to assign us a seat. After 5min. and being ignored by 2 waiters,  I asked a 3rd one, if we could go sit outside. He answered me me in a very aggressive and exasperated tone that the table (not the one we spotted) was dirty and to find a place inside.Realising he didn't know there was a clean table outside, we went anyways and sat there.  It took about 15 min. before he brought us menus and about 20 min. more before a second waiter, who saw us getting fidgety took pitty on us and took our order. It took another 20-25 minutes before we got our food. We asked our waiter for coffee at least 3 times before we got some.This same scenario was happening at every table around us. The party of 4, sitting next to us, told us they had been sitting there for close to an hour before they got their food. Two out of the four didn't receive their complete order. One got his side when his plate was almost finished and the other never got his toasts.I asked for a coffee refil twice and never received it.  By the end of our breakfast, no less than 4 waiters has come to our table. It was the same for the other ones. Hence, it seems like tables are not assigned to waiters in this restaurant.All in all, there are other breakfast restaurants within 5 min. walking distance of this place that are just as good and have exponentially better service.I won't go back and definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you are looking for a 2 hour breakfast experience."

The fresh OJ is delicious if not a little over priced; I can get two cartons of Tropicana for what they charge for one glass. But still, fresh comes with a price tag. Our omelettes (the Nature with Brie and the L'Oeufrier) were both delicious, perfectly cooked, with the most delicious toast I think I've ever had. So crunchy but chewy at the same time, yum! The breakfast potatoes were another standout. Everything was fresh, hot and delivered very quickly.Our first server was super nice, and we found his service to be great despite a slight language barrier. I also discovered that we had matching tattoos on the same wrist which made for a nice little bonding moment for us. The second server was fine, as well, just seemed a little more hurried. Prices were very fair for the quality of food and also their portions. We will definitely be returning the next time we are in Montreal.

Adding freshly cut bananas, tiny bits of kiwi, and paper thin strawberries to a small bowl of commercially processed pineapple and melons, doesn't make it ""Fresh Seasonal Variety of Fruits"" as it states in the menu.At $12.50, I think the so called platter, should be served in a dish bigger that something your'd serve escargot in.  I almost gave them a 3-star as service wasn't too bad but then noticed the lady next to me.  She also ordered the fruit platter which was nowhere near what I received.  Her plate had grapefruit, oranges, slices of watermelon and more.  The menu only had the one option when it came to the fruit platter, that I could see.  The server did not extend or made suggestion when I told him I only wanted fruit only for breakfast."

I particularly appreciated the creative flare in the decoration, the menus and the presentation of the food. The people are friendly and polite, the whole place has a joyful, lively atmosphere and the patio is a charming place to eat brunch on a sunny day.My main complaint is that we had to wait about 45 minutes for our food to arrive. I understand they are extremely busy, but we were already really hungry when we arrived, and didn't expect such a long wait. Also, it's a bit pricey for breakfast food, especially when converted to US dollars."

Oh hell no,at the last moments when we paying our bills separately,he talked and smiling to my bf but when comes to me,i said ""Merci"",and he even not looking at me,and without a response,without ask me if i need a copy of the receipt. If any manager of this restaurant can see my comment would be perfect,i dont know whats wrong with this waiter but you guys should have the right idea to treat clients no matter what are their backgrounds. And i found this is hilarious as L'Oeufrier is a restaurant in Gay Village in Montreal in Canada,one of the most open-minded area around the world.Beside this,i have to be honest that the other staffs were nice to me and the food are awesome,they worth more than 3 stars.But ask me if i will go back for second time?Haha,i think i am going to tell all the friends i know in Montreal about this interesting story at first"

Their menu is extensive, various choices and combos available, and all the plates had pretty funny names. Portions are big, you are sure to fill up your belly if you come in hungry. However, in my book, breakfast being a pretty easy meal to prepare, a good brunch restaurant really differentiates itself from the attention they pay to details. Some examples that I found disappointing might include : waffle was not crispy (more of a pancake texture), potatoes were not freshly made and had no seasoning on them, and service was lacking (no coffee refill, server kind of our meal), and the bread was definitively not freshly toasted as it was hard and cold like if it was left on the counter for a whole day. We waited outside for about 50 minutes on a Sunday morning so I definitively had higher expectations for this place. Price point reasonable, around what you would expect to pay elsewhere downtown, but definitively not cheap. Would go back to try other things on the menu, but perhaps not at this location."

This is my first review and as a seasoned waiter myself, I'm seriously appalled. L'oeufrier Amherst; so noisy that I had to repeat my order not once but 3 times the 3rd time practically yelling at the guy who then proceeded to ask me with major attitude if ""I"" was okay...? Are you kidding me... My eggs were over cooked, my potatoes were cold he offered mayo but no coffee refill when he clearly should have noticed that our cups were empty when offering the mayo!? And when the fuck did servers stop asking if everything is to our liking?! You can't event take 2 seconds?! I'm sick and tired of tipping assholes! Thank you to his colleague for the second cup of coffee.  Usually I don't say anything, leave my 15% and walk out. Well buddy, because you thought I was giving you attitude (when I clearly wasn't) and you decided right then and there that you weren't going to serve us anymore, today you're getting 10 fucking percent and if I was a real asshole I'd leave you nothing. I wasn't in a bad mood when I sat down but I'm annoyed as fuck now. It's because of people like you who continually get away with shitty service that more and more people are deciding to stay home instead of dinning out!!! *L'oeufrier on Mt-Royal has way better service, and better atmosphere even when it's packed to the brim!"

The menu at L'Oeufrier has something for everyone. From breakfast poutine to waffles and french toast. This is breakfast mecca. It was a Monday morning around 10am when we arrived, and we were seated right away. The host/server was attentive and brought us menus and coffee right away. At first he brought us menus in French; it is Montreal after all. I don't speak French, but I was actually having fun trying to figure out the dishes using pictures and my limited understanding of the language and language in general. The waiter saw this attempt, and realized we needed English menus. It made ordering easier, that's for sure. I ended up getting one of the breakfast poutines (since it was our last day and I hadn't had any poutine yet), the one with Emilia in the name. It had sausage, goat cheese, peppers, onions, and a bunch of tastiness, plus over easy eggs on top. My partner got a basic breakfast platter and we shared the chocolate banana brioche. Mmm mm mmm!  It was all really delicious. Very crisp and clean decor, friendly service, and worth a try if you're in the area looking for a casual bite to eat."

I was also very pleasantly surprised that it came with a side of fresh fruit, which I did not notice  written on the menu. Coffee was included, a refill was given without asking, and the service was was prompt and very courteous. I have to say though, this is a bit on the pricey side, but excellent, so it's well worth it. The only slightly, annoying factor, was one of the staff reaching past me several times to refill the sugar container. Overall, great place."
