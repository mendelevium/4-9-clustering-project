The coleslaw is tangy with a little bit of spice just perfect to add on top of the pupusas. The plantains are like soft warm pillows that just melt in your mouth and the fried yucas are perfectly crispy. The tamarind juice!! Definitely have to go back for more!!
/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,Jason M.,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Came here for my puposas and horchata fix and went with their combo meal that had a variety of puposas and drink.The puposas here are THICCC. They're pretty heavy eating so I found myself getting stuffed pretty quickly. They're also quite good since they're pretty generous on the filling. Not the best puposas I had but nonetheless good. The horchata unfortunately was a miss for me. I kept mixing and mixing for me and it felt off. Perhaps it was rushed either way we left it half full in our ""silent sign of protest"".Place is easy to miss as it's located on a busy street. It's relatively unassuming. Waitress was serviceable but couldn't be bothered to talk with us beyond getting our order. Perhaps it's a language barrier issue."

/user_details?userid=voFxNdzhG-cDrW_9NzFGbw,Denzil D.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,I had heard about this place from a friend and was excited to try it. When I saw the mama in the kitchen I knew it was going to be fresh and good. AND IT WAS! I really enjoyed the meal. I eat it before I could take any pictures. Sorry. Try it out if you are looking for Salvadoran food in Montréal.

The pork and cheese, shrimp, chicken and loroco are my favourite. The fried plantain is also incredible. All the food is unbelievably cheap and the service is wonderfully friendly. This is absolutely one of my favourite spots for cheap eats in the city."
