/user_details?userid=KwbctrkvJURp8r0H6X8DrQ,Rob R.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Satay Brothers is a South East Asian restaurant, located in the St. Henri neighborhood of Montreal, Quebec.On the menu:Laksa soup (Original and Chicken):* Shrimp* Quail egg* Soybean sprouts* Green onions* Coriander* Noodles* Cooked chicken (for the chicken version)I decided to go with a deliciously creamy, chili shrimp coconut milk soup. The soup is one of their core menu items, so it was definitely worth a try.It was very smooth, flavourful and heartwarming, which makes it perfect for the winter months.There's a 0-3 spiciness level available, so make sure you specify it if you'd like a bit more of a kick, or just want to settle for a bit of warmth. I went with the level of 0, and it was very mild... So if you can't handle spicy food, this is the perfect option for you.The main ingredients are separated from the broth, so the soup can be heated up separately if you decide to have it at a later time and to prevent the rest of the ingredients from becoming a mush.Their menu is quite extensive, so there are very many items to be explored.Takeout and delivery are available through CHK PLZ (@chkplzapp)Instagram: @sataybrothers"

Food is just as good as before :) if you order online, from their website they will link you to chk plz where you can complete your order and a pick up time. You'll get a confirmation number and you can line up in front of the restaurant at your chosen hour. They allow only one person in at a time but it flows very quickly. We ordered our favourites: meat satay, pork steam bun x2, papaya salad and the rendang. So flavourful!"

My friend and I ordered food to share and was not disappointed! I absolutely loved the papaya salad. It had a super tangy dressing with nuts on the side which was just perfect. It might seem like a small portion, but it's very packed and quite filling. We also ordered veggie noodles. Loveddddd all the veggies with nice noodles. This too was a generous portion. It was a spicy and flavorful fish. It went so well with the salad. My friend and I honestly enjoyed every bite and finished everything. Presentation for both plates were beautiful. Service was great, as the staff constantly checked up on us. The resto is quite large with many seating options. We were sharing a table with another group but it did not bother either parties. The decor can be overwhelming but its so different you seriously can't stop looking at the walls. You could easily pass it as there are no big signs except for 2 red shutter styled doors. Also good luck with parking in this area. We went during the week so we didn't struggle as much."

Walking in this dark lit place with colourful lanterns everywhere made me feel like I time travelled. The music added to the club/resto ambience. Singaporean street food is served at this trendy hangout.. Staff is friendly and they were all practicing the safety measures during these pandemic times which is important. Ordered the steam buns with pork belly. I woofed that down pretty quick because it's hard not to. Rendang! That would be braised beef in coconut milk with jasmine rice. On boy my mouth was having a party with all the spices that collided with each other. Everything was bang on! We did have dessert , I didn't love nor disliked it. I'll leave that up to you. I will be going back to try other dishes that caught my eye. Enjoy!!"
/user_details?userid=puMWOwZTa1A2B9oMRFl7KQ,Jason H.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"You like pork bun? Of course you do, now if you want the best ever pork bun to grace gods green earth you come to Satay Brothers.  Perfectly steamed buns with a generous slab of fatty pork belly, just the right amount of cucumber and cilantro in a very savoury house sauce; so simple yet so amazing I honestly could have had 10 of them with zero regrets.   I also tried the Laska soup which I've never had before, coconut milk, perfectly cooked noodles with chilli shrimp to give it a spicy zip and some other things I ate without question a very good soup.  I will dream about these pork buns and make sure that every time I'm in the area I get to Satay Brothers to eat them with my face and order 2 more to go as well."

Great selection of Malay /Singapore dishes. Brought me back to my trip in SE Asia. Tried the beef rendang which was good but not spicy. The grilled eggplant salad was amazing and so were the satay's with the chunky peanut sauce.  Vegetarian noodle dish was also A1. They said the dishes were spicy, but did not feel any level of spice. I'll ask for extra spicy next time.  Can't wait to go back!"

The pork buns are a personal favourite, and as a recent vegan I will miss them. But hey, that's cool, because they have really stellar vegveg options. Their Atwater Market setup is awesome, good place to stop for a snack. The restaurant though is the place to be. The decor and atmosphere contribute an overall awesome dining experience. Fun service, kind of like having your order taken by your cool older brother."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"Overpriced food, good service, corny asian decorations. I ordered 1 laksa, 4 skewers and 2 steamed buns and it cost me a total of 43$ which is super expensive for 1 meal made with cheap ingredients. The laksa's broth was spicy but was a bit bland. It came with perfectly cooked rice noodles. The portion was pretty small for 12$. It came with a piece of flavorless chicken as well as 2 tiny slices of what seemed to be like fish cake. The skewers were well marinated and came with a peanut sauce. However, the meat was too tough and chewy and had a lot of burnt parts. The steamed buns were soft and the pork belly was good, but it was a bit too salty and came with very few slices of cucumbers to balance the saltiness. The inside of the restaurant was decorated in a very stereotypical asian way (a little too much...) with red lanterns, red lights and a gloomy and dark atmosphere. It was noisy and didn't feel very clean and confortable. I can definitely see why this place is hyped, it has a nice ambience for drinks and chilling and looks ""exotic"". Overall, the service was great. However, the food was expensive and the quality definitely didn't match the price. Wouldn't come back."
/user_details?userid=pQ02Y1VCqcV7vZV_id2VsA,Sophie L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Wow. I am drooling just writing this review. Satay Brothers is an incredible example of Montreal restaurants differentiating themselves from different cities. This small establishment serves Singaporean food, which my personal favorites consist of steam pork belly bao buns (to die for), lamb skewers, fried rice, papaya salad, and much more. Unfortunately, they do not take any reservations but i've never ended up waiting more than 10 minutes for a table. Go! You will not regret it."
/user_details?userid=XbiKsujS_qxU3xsr0xUqmQ,Cin C.,"Toronto, Canada",5 star rating,"Amazing food in a fun rowdy atmosphere that transports you to a street festival vibe, especially on the weekends!  There is usually a wait out the door, but it is well worth the effort or making reservations ahead of time.We ordered about half the menu because everything looked amazing. Table favorites included the pork belly bao, otak otak, satay skewers and the meegoreng. The meegoreng was one of the best that I've had, and my partner (who is Singaporean) agreed. It had a good kick and the flavors were on point. I had my first otak otak here, and it is such a hard to find dish!!  Absolutely loved the flavors of ginger and lemongrass. The price is on the expensive side, but you can't get some of these dishes anywhere else. So it was worth the splurge for a great treat!"

/user_details?userid=Xgnkm6ryeHNtdIlpPJ5YqQ,Huyn N.,"Saint-Laurent, Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Nice place and decoration. Nice staff.For the kolo mee, it has good flavors and seasoning. The meat is tender. The soup on the side is a little bit salty and has lamb flavor ( I assumed it was lamb soup) and I don't personally really like it.For the laksa, it has rich coconut flavor and a little bit spicy. That's all the flavor it has.. kinda disappointed because this is the most recommended dish. The chicken skewers with the sauce are great! Really love it. It's tender and juicy.Steam bun is my favorite. The meat is tender and melts in your mouth. Great flavor.Papaya salad is pricy and super sour. Not really enjoyed it.Overall it's pretty good but some dishes are overrated.The cassonade lemonade is great! Super enjoy it"
/user_details?userid=pMpy37E7u8BYuyfnqkuGLw,Stefania M.,"Woodbridge, Vaughan, Canada",4 star rating,"Great vibe, dark lit, oriental style restaurant and bar. It gets rough so be prepared to sit very close and yell. It fills up fast so I recommend getting there for 6:30/7 if you want to have dinner. Most seating options are sharing tables or at the kitchen bar. The food was amazing. We ordered tofu and pork steamed buns, the green papaya salad, kolo mee and meegoreng. The staff are really nice. We did have an issue with the kolo mee getting lost in delivery and had to wait about 30 minutes for it. We had asked the server about it 10 mins after we got the first one and he said it just takes longer to make (didn't check with the kitchen for it). Then eventually he came to check if we wanted dessert and was shocked when we said we still hadn't gotten our entree. The kolo mee was great in the end, and we got a free dessert with it. Overall I definitely recommend this place. We will be back the next time we come to mtl!"

No need to travel that far as you will get all the best offerings right in these icy Montreal quarters. Start with the namesake chicken satay, but do not be conservative with your orders, for you will not be satisfied. In fact, you can't make a mistake by ordering from the myriad choices on this menu. Literally every dish is great, as I have tried them all. The succulent chicken legs, lightly peppered with the aroma of the orient; the Tom Yom (or some double syllabled name) soup with crunchy veggies bathed in milky fresh spices; that set of evenly distributed bun... It is astonishing that Montreal has such a world class Asian fix, when nearly every other Asian resto carter only to the uninitiated and easily satisfied.Granted, the decor reminds of an asian harem, but it does fuel the appetite nonetheless."

/user_details?userid=IoW5mayfZWleMWKRjF1l3A,Jasmine And Meko S.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Satay Brothers welcomes it patrons with a warm ambiance and Asian inspired decor. Though I can't say much about the accuracy of Singaporean decor, I can definitely say that there is a lot to look at! With communal seating and bar seating, Satay Brothers is the perfect picture of a trendy Asian eatery.We ordered three of their well known dishes: the laksa, the miegoreng and the papaya salad. The laksa was one of my favorites, I particularly liked the coconut flavors and the variety of vegetables. The miegoreng was the weaker dish of the three, I would have liked some stronger spices and seasoning. Finally the papaya salad was a nice acidic lemony touch to the whole meal! We also ordered two drinks: the Ippon ginger beer and their cassonade lemonade which were both delicious!Satay Brothers is located on Notre Dame street with plenty of parking and local eateries around it. Their service was courteous and quick and I definitely hope to return next time to try their skewers and buns!"
/user_details?userid=FWo1hSUugKWFQwr5IpCANw,Rabbiya A.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Decent place to grab a bite at if you are close to Atwater. We stopped here for an early dinner and ended up using Yelp to choose items that were recommended by other Yelpers. We ordered Satay Chicken Skewers & Tofu Buns. Food was average. Taste was slightly bland and could use more authentic spices. Service was quick. With so many options for food places in every area, wouldn't necessarily recommend this spot."
/user_details?userid=vd1Y29IUpfJa0uBylsQAxw,Jeremy M.,"Newton, MA",5 star rating,"Satay Brothers has some of the best Singaporean food my girlfriend and I have tried outside of Singapore -- and, since we're always on the lookout for food from her home country, we've tried quite a lot.While not everything on the menu is strictly Singaporean -- neither of us had ever seen or heard of a 'satay sandwich' in Singapore -- the westernizing influence was generally subtle, and the menu sports a wide array of truly authentic Singaporean dishes like Laksa, Mee Goreng, Char Kway Teow, Otak Otak, and Rendang. We went with the staples, ordering Laksa, Chicken Satay, Mee Goreng, and Char Kway Teow. The Laksa -- a sweet and spicy coconut soup with prawns, beansprouts, and an egg that's almost impossible to find outside of Singapore -- was the star of the meal. The soup was rich and flavorful, with noodles cooked to perfection, and tasted almost as good as the soups back home. The satays were also excellent -- the meat was tender and excellently seasoned, and arrived at the table piping hot from the grill and accompanied by a tangy peanut sauce and pieces of fresh cucumber.The Mee Goreng and Char Kway Teow, while still tasty, were the weaker dishes of the meal. Satay Brothers added squid into the Mee Goreng -- a spicy Malay fried noodle dish -- that, while perhaps not a bad idea in theory, in execution gave the dish a fishy quality that masked and undermined the more subtle traditional flavors. The Char Kway Teow -- a sweeter noodle dish that's stir fried with light and dark sweet soy sauce alongside chili, sausage, and egg -- was missing the signature yellow egg noodles and a beat off from what we expected in taste.Overall, Satay Brothers is well worth a visit!"
/user_details?userid=JM_JfYRtTIBc42zHSRgsrA,Young P.,"Los Angeles, CA",2 star rating,"This place is average at best. Not sure what the hype is all about to be honest....I mean food tasted okay, service was average, and the restaurant itself is super corny with random Asian decorations to make it more ""Asian"" haha....Pork buns - Eh. I've definitely had better pork buns. Buns were not that good and pork needs to be more meaty and fatty and less salty. Laksa - Flavor is there but the texture was too watery...real laksa needs to be more thick in terms of texture and flavor needs to be more deep which can only be created with the right amount of ingredients AND A LOT OF TIME BOILING.Pork fried rice - honestly I couldn't find anything else worth trying on the menu so I just opted for the fried rice. Tasted okay but it was too greasy...I can probably make better fried rice than they do here.Overall, I think we got caught up in the hype and had our expectations way too high. I mean if you are nearby I guess you can give it a try but if you are a little far out, don't go out of your way to eat here. Not worth it in my opinion."

My wife and I were really disappointed in the price, taste and portion ratio. We did do our research and noticed how small the portions were. The ribs entrée for $13 should really be an appetizer and lacked flavor.We ordered a lot food and had to wait for 2 of 5 items to come out. We were totally fatties. We shared a large table with 2 other couples. The first couple who sat down after we were seated finished and paid and we were waiting for our entrees. The second couple paid and finished their meal after we asked for our check. I'm glad I tried but I would search for a more authentic place for south Asian instead of this hipster place. The decor and atmosphere was cool but that never gets me full.Luckily, they accept American cc. or i would have to wash dishes and Boo Boo wax mustaches."

However, when I ordered the Laska avec Poulet I didn't receive it. Upon realizing, I asked the waitress if it was able to fix or if I could switch for another food item. She said swapping for the veggie noodles (which my dining partner had) would be fine.That was until it came time to pay the bill and in fact they still charged me for both meals.  Once talking to the manager he refused to take the uneaten item off the bill.The noodles I paid for in addition to the uneaten food were lovely and I would recommend the place on that alone.

The sauce inside isn't too sweet and the bun itself was so soft and well made.

We ordered the fried roll (shrimp, crab, calamari and pork), shrimp fried buns, meegoreng (shrimp and calamari sauté with noodles) and meat satays with peanut sauce. We also had a pitcher of Pimms cup. Everything was delicious. Especially the buns and fried roll. You should count about 2 plates per person.

Not saying the food is bad, but it didn't live up to the high expectations. I tried the chicken satay and pork buns, which were both pretty good and the service was nice too. Overall, I just hoped that the satay was a bit more spicy (idk what the authentic version tastes like, so don't come after me), but I loved the peanut sauce. The pork in the buns was extremely juicy too and tasted good. However, the portions were a bit small imo. Hence, the 3 instead of 4 for the 3.5* place."

Everything is essentially served like small family style plates so we all got to try a little of everything. Our food came out quickly and had GREAT flavor! If you like spice, this is definitely your place to go. The servers were also really helpful when my cousin's 10 month old baby had a little spit up accident. Even though we made sure to clean the floor and table, they came over and sanitized it also. We came around 6:30 PM I believe and there was about a half hour wait for our larger party of 7 adults and 2 kids. As we were leaving, it only got busier so be prepared to wait. It's also pretty loud with their music so expect to talk loudly but it's definitely a fun and hip place to come to and the food is definitely worth the wait."

Amazing vibes from a bunch of employees who seem to enjoy their job. It was loud, music was bumpin`, and the lighting was appropriate for a Saturday night.However, that's where the high praise ends. The food (which we ordered the Laksa, skewers, Ren Dang) were OK - They were not bad by any means, but nothing other similar establishments offered. However what makes this hard to digest is the pricing - it is a few dollars higher than your regular thai/malaysian/indonesian restobars.I would recommend this place if you were looking to have a few bites with your drinks without expecting AMAZING quality. Come with that mindset and you'll have a great time at Satay Brothers."

This is definitely a winner for me - I'll be back here for sure.  I believe there is another location - a small stall in one of the markets - Atwater market I believe).  But I don't think it can compete with the restaurant in terms of overall experience (décor, etc)."

The service is excellent, and choice of menu quite decent. The price is also good! In terms of vegetarian food we ordered, I think we were underwhelmed. We had the veg of the week with garlic-- which was bland and nothing special. Had the tofu fritters which were extremely salty despite the yogurt sauce. Ordered the vegetarian gado gado which was essentially cold tofu, with a cold half egg and a bland peanut sauce covering soy beans, and then had the tofu buns- which were the best thing we ordered, but still nothing mind blowing. We also shared a pitcher of the alcoholic lemonade- again underwhelming, and essentially just ice.Possibly the meat containing dishes are better considering the reviews on yelp. But I think as a vegetarian, I would not be going back."

The restaurant did not have any signage and is located across the street from one of my other Montreal favorites Sumac. It is reachable about a 5 minute walk from the nearest metro station (Lionel Groulx). Was a happening place. It was a warm May Thursday around 7pm and the restaurant was packed. After a short wait, I was seated at the back counter, right in front of all the action (coutner where pork buns were made and kitchen cooking) - which is a great view. The waiter (super nice) said the most popular dishes are Satay are: pork buns, the satay, laksa (coconut milk soup w/ shrimp), rendang (braised beef) and the meegoreng noodles. After much debate I went with the laksa and meegoreng noodles. Note there is a mini laksa you can get for c$5.99 which is not on the menu. I'm usually not a fan of coconut but the laksa was delicious - the chilli shrimp was perfect and soup had a lot of flavor. The meegoreng noodles with shrimp and cuttlefish was perfect as well with the cuttlefish pieces being soft and tender and noodles cooked with some sauce. Will definitely come back to Satay Brothers."

The interior is beautiful and the service was great but the food itself was just lacking for me. I tried out different items from the menu, The chicken satays were probably the best thing on the menu but the sauce that was served with it was just odd and too chunky.The fried chicken was extremely greasy (more than a usual fried chicken order) and quality wasn't great.The lamb soup was good, nothing extra ordinary.And the meegoreng seafood dish had a peculiar taste with whatever sauce being used on the noodles was too strong."

Perhaps it was because of my poor choice of plate and also the fact that I can't eat spicy. I saw the reviews on yelp and decided to give it a try. Took the noodles with pork and a side dish of pork bao. While the food was not mediocre, it was overpriced for what it is. My friends took the Laksa, which they told me it was kinda bland. While the food was not great, I could see the appeal of the restaurant with its hip and nice ambiance. It is a place where you go to chill and get food at the same time, but not a stop in itself for food according to me. Likely won't come back since it is too expensive for me."

The closest subway is Lionel-Groulx and you're looking at about a 10-minute walk from there. Street parking is available [metered and un-metered].The place: Dimly lit but super cozy. It's got a bar vibe going on and is pretty casual. There are communal tables so you can get to know your neighbours. I really liked the space.The goods: I went with the Laksa Lemac, which is a soup with noodles, fish cakes, shrimp, boiled egg and SPICE. I liked the spice - it cleared up my sinuses. If you're not a fan of the heat, then let them know. I'm sure they can tone it down for you. I also tried a steamed bun with marinated tofu. As far as the soup goes, I really liked it. The bun was OK but it didn't blow me away because it was a little bland. Also, I couldn't really taste the marinade. Maybe my expectations were too high because while I did enjoy the food, I didn't leave there feeling wowed. I plan to go back to try the green papaya salad that I've heard so much about. Service: Honestly, everyone was pretty blasé and indifferent. The only guy that was friendly toward us was the bus boy. Our wait staff was rather inattentive and couldn't seem to be bothered.

Walking in on a Sunday night, we could immediately see what the hype around this restaurant was about. It doesn't look like much from the outside - in fact, we had a bit of trouble looking for the sign since there was so much construction around - but the inside was trendy and thematic, really reminding me of Asia. The restaurant was packed full, but the line was short - we only waited 5-10 minutes before a waiter came and offered us either two seats at the bar or at a bigger table. We choose to share a table with other people; initially, I thought it might be a bit strange to eat with strangers, but we had a nice chat with the guys sitting across from us. The seating was similar to the round table style you see at dimsum, but that caused a bit of confusion with our orders. When two bowls of laksa came, our table-mate, who had a severe gluten allergy, almost didn't realise that his bowl wasn't the gluten-free one. As for food, I highly recommend the porn buns; they were some of the best I've ever had. I tried a bit of the laksa, and I enjoyed it, but I didn't Love love it. An overall fun experience! I may come back just for the pork buns - haven't stopped thinking about them since."

They even had some games that you could play like marble checkers etc that brought me back to my childhood. The food itself was okay but not amazing. I really liked have a cold beer with the spicy noodles however I felt like the flavours weren't strong enough.

This place was as close as I've come to Singapore-style specifically, but wasn't quite the same. It's the full Katong style in that the noodles are cut so you only need a spoon, though the bean sprouts make that a bit trickier than it should be. Broth flavor is delicious but is missing an intangible something relative to Singapore. Most importantly, noodles are overcooked.Service is friendly, food comes out scarily fast, and the laksa is about as good as it gets in North America, but still not perfect."

The buns were average, with pork belly, cucumber, cilantro, and hoisin sauce. For $5 a bun I wish there was a little more pizzazz for the price, but they were still definitely tasty. The papaya salad was very enjoyable, with a nice level of spice. acidity from the lime, and texture from the addition of peanuts and cilantro. The pork on top was seasoned quite well, too.  (Only personal gripe is that I felt red bell peppers an odd addition but it wasn't bad or anything). The rice noodle dish came with clams, shrimp, and chinese sausage. The clams were really nice, and I really like the addition of the chinese sausage. Overall everything was prepared well and the portion sizes were bigger as well.The trendy atmosphere was not really for me, but I can appreciate the care they put into making the decor colorful and vibrant.

The guy wasn't happy that we wanted to split the bill (there were 4of us). When he punched in the amount for the first person, he entered $1 more than what's on the bill.

This little place was recommended to us by a friend. She said that it was a ""MUST GO"" when in Montreal. We arrived on a dimly lit street and the restaurant had no business sign, so just look for a place that kinda emits red lights. We go there around 5:45pm on a Sunday and the place was already packed. We tried calling in advance for reservations, however, they said that they didn't do reservations on weekends. Yet, when we walked in, there was a 20 person table with a ""reserved"" sign on it. Oh well, moving on. We were offered the only table left in the restaurant in a very dim lighted area or be seated at communal tables. As a foodie, I enjoy my personal space and my lighted areas for savoury food pictures. Nonetheless, we chose the single table with dim lighting. Their menu was very simple, not a lot to choose from. So we ordered the following: - Chicken Skewers (3) $7.00- Laksa $10.50- Honey ribs $13.00- Meegoreng $13.00First off, the waiters were very helpful. They explained the dishes, told us whether we over ordered or whether it was too much food. They told us which of their dishes are the most popular and which ones are spicy or not. The Chicken Skewers came first and they were heavenly. You can tell that the peanut sauce was made in house and not from a bottle. The skewers were juicy and tender. The Laksa was delicious. However, it's supposed to come with noodles. The amount of noodles in that bowl was very disappointing. I'm pretty sure i could have counted the strands of noodles and not run out of breath. They substituted a majority of the noodles for bean sprouts which was unappetizing. The soup itself was delicious. Honey Ribs were disappointing. 6 or 7 pieces of small ribs for 13 dollars was NOT worth it. The ribs were also cooked very weird. They tasted like they were made with a mixture of soy sauce and honey/sugar. But, this was a dish I would not recommend. Meegoreng is a stir fry dish made with fat noodles, onions, peppers, bean sprouts and protein. Again, i was able to count the strands of fat noodles in this dish as well. There was probably three whole onions chopped up to substitute the noodles in this dish. Flavour? it wasn't that great. There was an overpowering spicy taste that took away from the rest of the dish. As we were eating the place got packed and due to a lack of restaurant lobby space, there were people waiting right beside us as we ate. Overall, Customer service was phenomenal. Food Quality was OK. Prices? over priced. You can definitely find some place with better quality + prices for Singaporean/Malaysian food."

I've called the restaurant to make reservations for 3 and was told that they only take reservations for groups of 10+. No problem, we just showed up at 8pm on Friday, and let me tell you, this place is packed. After eating here, I can understand why.Good: The tempeh sandwich was one of my favorite dishes. I don't know what's in that coleslaw, but it was delicious. This spot has a lot of hearty and well marinated grilled dishes. The interior is what Chinatown would look like if it was overrun by hipsters, which is not a bad thing. It has a trendy vibe and a really lively crowd. The prices are very reasonable, in the $5-$15 per dish price range. Bad: Okay, food first. I've had the papaya salad on two occasions, and both times it was too soggy. I had to drain my salad because the sauce made it unbearably salty. After that, it was actually pretty good. Another downside is how packed this place gets! We've waited about 25 mins to get a seat at a community table. Bottom line: I'll definitely be back, I'll tough it out for the wait. The food and service were pretty good, so that alone would motivate me to come back to Saint Henri (despite its awful roadside construction)."

I tried Satay Brothers looking for some authentic cuisine from back home and it did not disappoint. The menu features dishes like laksa, mee goreng, pork buns, beef rendeng, papaya salad, and you guessed it, satay.The pork buns here are simply delicious. While they may be a turn off, due to their high price, I think they are well worth trying. The meat is tender and full of flavor, which goes perfectly with the soft bun. This is one of the better pork buns that I've had! Similarly, the satay is delicious, yet expensive. They also come in small portions. It's served with a peanut sauce, which is amazing and tastes similar to what you could get in Singapore. Finally, the laksa is a MUST try. It tastes truly authentic and is very delicious. It's a rich coconut based soup, with shrimp, bean sprouts, noodles and chili paste. Again, small portions. I would recommend ordering a lot to share with the group.There are also some Asian beers available, a small selection of deserts and appetizers. The service is also really good. All the waiters are really friendly and knowledgeable about the various dishes!Overall, Satay Brothers is delicious, but the portions are small and each dish is quite expensive. I recommend it to anyone looking for a taste of authentic Southeast Asian food. Try to order a variety of things and share!"

This is how the new, permanent I hope, Satay Brothers location made me feel today, it brought me in the warm months. The new restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating options, including two bars. Atmosphere is laid back. Drinks menu has grown to unexpected heights, cocktails, wines etc. The guys working there seem to be the same cheerful folks from the market and they are doing nice job to satisfy the customers. The food is of the same quality as what you would find at the Atwater market stand, I like consistency. Chicken satay and spicy papaya salad are my favourite dishes, but suddenly I realized how perfect is to have the Laksa Lemak soup today, hot and spicy, warming up. The pork buns are still the same, puffy and delicious. Some of the dishes are available only during the evening, but this made my choice easier, just stick to what you love! I'll be back!"
/user_details?userid=1Bljt-GngRP4XxkQFLnHHQ,Rod M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Satay Brothers may well be the best Singaporean/Malaysian restaurant east of Vancouver. Ok I can't know this for a 100% fact, but I'm pretty sure. After frequenting their summer location at Atwater market I was thrilled to learn that Satay Brothers finally setup a more permanent location nearby. The restaurant is very cozy, seating about 20 people at a mix of small tables and long communal style tables. We had  proc and tofu buns, Laksa, Mee Goreng and Gado Gado salad. Everything was terrific, but the winner for me was the Gado Gado salad, perhaps that was because of the peanut sauce which I love. But, other contributing factors were the freshness of all the ingredients and the mix of terrific flavours and textures. The bill for the above came-out to $33. Based on the value, the extreme tastiness of the food and how difficult it is to find good Singaporean/Malaysian cuisine this is a five star review. On top of everything else, the guys who run the place are great!"

She painstakingly detailed all the delicious things available on the menu and after we had spent several minutes salivating over the options she offered to make us a menu for the evening- a quick exchange of hungry and smiling glances asserted that, yes, bring us all the delicious things.Needless to say, I'm not even sure what was brought out to our table but EVERYTHING was phenomenal.

However, if you have tried authentic southeast asian restaurants, you will notice that it lacked to deliver on the flavour side.This place is a luxury thai express."

/user_details?userid=NGLufCod1pP760aBucp3tw,Katie Z.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This was my first time eating at a Southeast Asian place that wasn't Vietnamese, so I was definitely excited to try it out! I had heard about Satay Brothers numerous times before coming, so I wanted to see whether or not it was worth the hype. The ambience was cozy and a lot bigger than what I expected when I initially walked by, and they had room to fit quite a few people. I ordered the pork buns, satay, and laksa after reading up on what to get beforehand, and all the food came out relatively quickly! The pork buns were the perfect combination of savory, rich, and fatty pork with the crispness of cucumber, bite of cilantro, and the softness of the bun. I can't remember the last time I had a bun like that; it's been so long since I've eaten homemade ones. The chicken satay skewer, although it was quite small, was juicy and went along really well with the peanut sauce that they served. The laksa came out in a bowl that was smaller than what I expected, but I thought the broth was absolutely divine and one of the few places in Montréal where something labeled as ""spicy"" is actually spicy! Unfortunately, I found the noodles to be cut quite small and there was not much seafood in the actual dish, which disappointed me. I probably counted 3 small shrimp, 2 thin slices of fish cake, and three small pieces of dried bean curd that was still crunchy in the bowl. I'm not sure if it was worth paying $9.99 for since I've had more for the same price at other places (hint hint: Nouilles de Lan Zhou), but it still tasted good! Overall, while I do think the food served at Satay Brothers is awesome, the portion sizes are quite small for what you pay. Perhaps it would be better to come in a group, but even then, it might burst your money bubble because getting full here certainly doesn't come cheap."

Bird cages, tea lanterns, Buddha statues, red walls, Chinese characters, etc. Where I'm from the youngins call it ""doing too much"" but apparently quite a few people find it charming. It also has less of a dining and more of a bar atmosphere when it gets really busy, for whatever that's worth.  Service was pretty spotty. Once we got our food, our server forgot we existed.

And it feels a lot like a little secret spot since the entryway doesn't really tell you that this is a restaurant.We all ordered at the same time. I had the gado gado salad for a light lunch. My plate came first, and then everyone else's in about 10,15, or 20 minute intervals. My meal was eaten long before the other half of the table got their meals. The dish itself was very bland.

Food: We split a papaya salad, 2 steamed buns with pork belly, marinated meat sticks and each got the shrimp laksa Overall everything hit the spot in terms of authentic Singaporean flavours. The steamed pork buns were the real highlight - Super fresh and that mix of super soft buns, salty pork and crisp coriander is just unbeatable. The meat sticks were tender and flavourful; The peanut sauce on the side is to die for. The laksa was really comforting and definitely a bit spicier than expected. The only slight disappointment was the papaya salad. The dressing was a bit heavy on the lime juice and the nuts were not as crunchy as they could have been. We didn't order their special that night (Fish cakes with rice) but it sounded delicious. Next time I'm planning on trying the beef rendang and the short ribs. Service: Very cool, trendy and friendly servers. They are quick and efficient, working well with the go-go-go vibes of the restaurant as a whole. Decor: Everything from the order chits, the china-patterned plates and bamboo steamers are very modern-traditional. The family style tables are not too crammed. I'd love to sit closer to the kitchen in the back next time! I'd make a serious effort to arrive before 6pm if you don't want to wait too long in line!"

/user_details?userid=qfkJG6lJPFtBxtN54tvieA,Kay T.,"Vancouver, Canada",3 star rating,"Came here for dinner because I was craving some authentic Asian food and Satay Brothers had high ratings on Yelp. As an Asian, I was very unimpressed with this place. The decor was cool, captured the Asian street food feel with the dingy wooden furniture, red lanterns, the feel and atmosphere was promising. Service was good (nothing bad, nothing good). Food was okay and the portions were small (in Asia street food is cheap and good and filling). Honestly, the cheap flowery plastic plates were probably the most 'authentic' part to this restaurant. Pretty disappointed in this place. Braised Pork Bun (2/5):This was what I was really looking forward to eating...and was sadly disappointed in the lack of flavours. It looks so good in pictures and has so much potential. In an authentic pork bun, the meat isn't drenched in Hoisin sauce and you can actually taste the braised meat. All I tasted in my buns was hoisin sauce and it ended up being gross and too salty so I couldn't enjoy the flavours or the actual meat and veggies. This is not authentic.Laksa (3/5):First of all this was like 10 bucks and there were barely any noodles. This isn't an entree. Noodles are the cheapest part so I don't understand why they didn't give me more noodles. This is also probably the cheapest dish to make so charging $10 for barely three spoonfuls of noodles is ridiculous. That being said, flavours were alright. It was nice and spicy, however, I would've liked more cocunut-y flavour in my soup. If you're looking to just get a taste of Malay cuisine (not make it a meal), this would be a good option for you.3 Satays (3.5/5):It was okay. Hard to fuck up on grilled meat. Beef Rendang (3.5/5)This was okay too. I wish it had more flavours and the beef was more tender. The portions were good for this dish"

Unfortunately my second visit was disappointing as the flavours of the food we ordered were very bland.We ordered the otak-otak, char kuay teow, as well as the satay. While the otak-otak itself was alright, the coconut rice that accompanied it lacked the flavour and fragrance of coconut. Sadly the char kuay teow also lacked some seasoning and spiciness. Additionally, it would have been nice to have some chilli paste and lime on the side. Lastly, the satay edges weren't as crispy or caramelized as I'd hoped for. I did enjoy the peanut sauce that came with the satay. I so badly want to love this place as it can be difficult to find easily accessible Singaporean/Malaysian food in Canada.

I like how they infuse the traditional Chinese environment with bar setting and how cool the waiters and waitresses are. However the food is too overpriced. The portion is a little bit too small. They are like snacks more than a regular meal. I guess that is not my original expectation. We ordered a papaya salad, two pork buns, one laksa and one fried noodles. Among all of those, the fried noodles and the pork buns are not too bad but the portion is a bit small. The papaya salad is a bit watery which is unexpected. Also the taste of laksa is way mild than what I had in the past and I know with such quality, it shouldnt cost $8-9, at most it should cost $6.To conclude, Satay Bro would be a great place to drink and to have fun, but not really recommending for regular meal."

You may end up sharing a table with other clients.... (Why not strike up a conversation!).The menu is a 1-page sheet.  We ordered 2 soups and 2 desserts.  It was oh so good!  We devoured everything!  We ordered the Laksa Lamak, and a beef and shrimp soup that was suggested to us (I don't remember seeing it on the menu, but the bill said ""Meerbus"").  The recepie was right on.  Just as creamy and spicy and tangy as it should be.  The food was served quickly and our waitress, Monica, was friendly and knowledgeable by offering suggestions.  Every sip and bite of the soup was a flavour party in my mouth - every scoop had the right amount of broth, noodles (and meat).  The bowl of soup was the perfect serving size for 1 person each.  If you were really hungry, add some pork buns or the satays to your meal - also highly recommended!We never had their desserts before so it was our first time trying the coconut wrapped in the green crepe, and the tapioca butter cake.  Perfect choices to end our meal...light, and not too sweet.This place is highly recommended for couples on dates, trying out a new place with friends, or just grabbing a bite to eat alone.  You will be happy to give this place a try!"

The restaurant on Notre Dame has a more extensive menu, which includes a wonderful seafood noodle dish, and the decor is super cool. It's low lit with many Chinese lanterns hanging from the wall. It's normally always packed so I would suggest going early."

Try the tofu steam buns and papaya salad. Vegetarian friendly. Cash only. Casual ambiance. Will be back again and again! That's all you need to know.

/user_details?userid=FuW1EwnbQoHyDMeOGrljsg,Khanh L.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Good food on a cold winter night, cash only please!Another indonesian joint to add to the list!!! I count 3 so far, Nonya, and Gado-Gado and now Satay Bros, let me know if you guys find another, better yet someone find me a Malaysian resto in Mtl!!!There's maybe 10 or 11 items on the menu, we ordered six of them, would have ordered 7  but the waiter said it was too much and talked us out of the extra dish. It was a good call cuz that extra dish would have been too much.The place is small bus cosy and it's open kitchen. The staff is friendly and laid back. The appetizers are 2-6$ and mains run about 7-10$. The dishes are not too large but are a good deal considering the price. I'd recommend two appetizers and 2-3 mains for two ppl who share food. We ordered 3 apps and 3 mains but we eat a lot :) yeah I'm fat and I like it lol.On to the food, we had: satay, pork buns, and papaya salad for appetizers, and laksa, mee goreng and beef rendang for mains.Satay is basically grilled skewered meat, this one was chicken. It was served with peanut dipping sauce and a side of cucumbers. This version however is marinated with lemongrass, which in all my satay eating experience is a first. Lemongrass is commonly used in vietnamese cuisine especially for grilled meat, so it is a flavor that I like and am familiar with. I do recommend this satay for it's lemongrass flavor.The pork buns are soft in texture, and the pork is tender. it is garnished with cucumber, coriander and hoi sin sauce. The sauce is a bit too sweet, but all together it is very good, at 3$ a pop, it's on the pricey side.The papaya salad was very good, it has a strong tangy taste but salted and sweetened just right to balance it out, this goes very well with the pork buns. Add some papaya to your pork buns to balance out the bun's sweetness, oh yeah that's right mix it up.Laksa, which a seafood noodle soup with coconut and curry. It was well salted, just enough that would balance out the blandness of the vermicelli, but not so salty that you were thirsty at the end of a bowl. It is mildy spicy and the spiciness accumulates as you eat. They also provide a bit of hot paste on your spoon at serving for those who wish to add more hotness. I opted to not add it because I don't like it too spicy.Mee goreng, Mtl we have a new best mee goreng!!! well by default anyways lol. I've always thought the mee goreng at Nonya was the best, but last time I was there ~2010 it was no longer on their menu :( so since the other one is no longer available, this is the new best! It is served with a wedge of lime and I strongly recommend you add the lime and mix before eating. The flavors are very strong in a mee goreng, and it can get overpowering quickly so the lime tempers it a bit, makes it milder. This one is a bit spicy too which is a nice touch.Beef rendang, this is perhaps the best rendang I've ever had in a restaurant. The sauce is not too greasy, it's balanced in terms of salt and sweet, and mildy spicy on the back end. As you eat the dish the spiciness increases and at the end you're like shit that was hot, wham there you go that's rendang! even though I know this, I always lather the sauce on my rice cuz it's so good, but only put it on half your rice, save the other half to temper the spiciness at the end :)Best meal I've had in a long while :) Now go!!!"

Later in the evening on a Sunday night in April when St. Henri is typically rather quiet, the restaurant was a great change of pace. The restaurant was busy but not packed and the communal tables don't feel atypically spacious (no elbow rubbing with strangers :) ). The food is the same as at the stand, high quality but a bit on the expensive side (3 steamed sandwiches, 6 satay, shrimp balls, and a pair of small deserts ran $50...  to food is in very small servings could be served from a truck so its a touch pricey).For desert the Kueh Salat, is a joy and a must have. A gelatinous custard on a bed of sticky coconut rice, it is a wonderful desert and should be had with every meal. Food was fast, servers were great, and the vibe was wonderful. We will definitely be back."

I was just visiting Montreal for the week, but read the reviews online and had to check it out.If you ask me, the soup is the star of the show, with pork buns a close second. I don't think the soup would be technically be considered pho, but the comparison is inevitable. They have couple different varieties of my meats and flavors, so you should be able to find something that works for you. I've only tried shrimp/chili variety and I was not disappointed. The soup even included a nice cheese (munster?) to give the dish a touch more ""fusion"". The pork buns are also great - nicely marinated and not too fatty. Finally, the sandwich and papaya salad are also worth a try.  Furthermore, the other patrons  I talked to were actually Montreal natives, and confirmed it was one of their favorite asian fusion spot in the city. If your in MTL and like southeast asian food, this place is worth the trip."

It was a complete an utter disappointment especially since the expectations were high and it all came crashing down starting by the seating itself!They seat you with strangers so we were like 7 people (I, my boyfriend and my mother - a couple presumably on a date - a pair of friends catching up chatting away non-stop).  I really don't like eavesdropping other's conversations or intrude on someone's date. All three of us had our heads down throughout.. Servers are not too attentive and based on the ambiance, it honestly felt like I was crashing someone's party and shoved to a side.. Then I had hoped that the food might compensate for this awkward discovery.. But it was the worst!!!!! Laksa was okay but became cold soon. Everything was served at the same time irrespective of it being an appetizer/main.. the chicken curry was full of bones and barely any meat.. We were essentially having the gravy with rice. The noodles with sausages and seafood smelt really really bad.. Reminded me (very unfortunately and I hate to have made this immediate comparison) of cow dungs... Very repulsive.. I had called earlier to check if they had some vegetarian options since my mom's one. They lady on the phone assured me with full confidence that they do have many.. So I was really excited but all my mom could eat was fried tofu. The broths of vegetable dishes contained fish sauce so our options were like 2 for her.. And one of those contained an egg with a runny yolk... I hope no body has this kind of experience, ever!! Really disappointed :'("

The service was great - I really like it when you ask your waiter for a recommendation and without hesitation and with a lot of confidence can give you a quick answer. The staff is really on the ball!I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the laksa was just OK (not the best, not the worst) and the ambiance was a bit crazy. Forget having a long dinner in this place. We were seated with a bunch of people we didn't know (which is fine) but we couldn't converse because it was quiet a loud bunch opposite us.

They're soft fluffy steamed buns with a melt in your mouth pork belly garnished with mini cucumber slices, coriander and hoisin sauce. I'm telling you, these trump hotdogs any day! I don't see them slowing down in popularity at all, I love their eclectic Asian inspired decor; it makes me think of a street dining experience in a narrow alleyway somewhere in Asia.  The SBs all have their themed t-shirts, one of the guys said his tee was printed from a painting that an artist did for SBs and they turned it into a graphic tee. So there's definitely a unique theme and vibe, they are the brothers after all.  Your best bet here is to show up early! Otherwise there will be wait time.  I think the hype does make up for a part of the experience as I found the papaya salad wayyyyy too tangy, and I've had it before but it shouldn't be enamel eroding. Their portions are good in the sense that you can order a couple entrées and eat it together because it's not very filling as a single dish. There's a couple round tables for large groups but most of the seating is bar style for eating side by side. Overall, I like the experience, the food, and the service."

Initially, I actually walked right passed this restaurant because there was no sign but you could tell you were at the right place because of the crowd inside. When I first walked in , I was immediately drawn to the decor. I loved the bright red walls and the endless collection of Asian decorations at every corner of the restaurant. It reminded me of my grandparents' home with the thrift finds and traditional artwork so be prepared for a strong embrace of nostalgia. I arrived around 7 on a Sunday night and the place was packed (it was a long weekend so probably equivalent to a Saturday). It does get quite loud so not a place for catching up and deep heart to heart conversations. It has that young and trendy vibe as most of the customers seemed to be in their 20s and 30s and most of their waiters were young guys-just an observation. Be prepared to share tables with strangers since they have a few big round tables and of course lots of customers. Now back to the food... I highly recommend the cerviche which is a raw fish salad on their special menu. It has the perfect blend of flavours and acidity. The fried rice and laksa were also pretty good. Don't be intimidated by the chili paste in the laska, it really isn't that spicy. Definitely order the pork buns and chicken skewers for appetizers. The dishes may look quite simple but the real skill lies in their ability to create unique flavours from different combinations of spices. If you're looking for a fun place to eat and something different for your palette then definitely check out Satay Brothers!"

Be warned.)The decor is warm, and suggestively Asian, but honest and simple - kinda like the Satay Brothers themselves ;-). The menu is also simple but varied, with the satay du jour providing extra variety. I was surprised and happy that they serve alcohol as well as their amazing array of exotic juices, which kept the kids and non-alcohol-drinkers very happy.The food was delicious, as usual. Most memorable were: the tiny pieces of hot chilis in the green papaya salad, which add extra zing to the refreshing taste and crunchy texture; the spiciness of the seafood mee goreng, and the tender firmness of its noodles; the otak otak (fish cake in a banana leaf), served with cucumber, egg and sauce on the side (I wish I knew what it was - made with tamarind maybe?), which was such a tangy ""sweet and sour"" combination. We also had beef rendang, tofu steamed buns, chicken satay skewers. It was all super tasty.The service was so friendly and warm, it made the whole experience even better. Finally, the music was eclectic and a real pleasure to listen to, without overwhelming the atmosphere.We left feeling completely satay-sfied!"

What you get here is more of the good stuff. The food is great, and the prices are cheap!The laksa is solid, the satay sandwiches are great (how could they not be?), and the pork buns - while not looking like what I'm used to - are great!I love that they have Creemore Springs by the pint - it goes so well with anything on the menu."

The hip people?  The bar-like ambiance?  The drinks?  Because the food was simply okay considering the price and the size of the portions (rather small).  I guess the friendliness of the staff helps.  Good spot for young people to chill, for whom eating is simply secondary to drinking and chatting.  For those who actually love eating, one visit may be enough."

Some of their best dishes include the green papaya salad, steam buns, satay, fried chicken legs and the beef rendang. Order as many things as you can! The decor is beautiful too---cool, casual, nice lighting, with a gorgeous carving on the back wall. The only thing that could make this place better is if they expanded the dessert menu a bit (although I guess that would mean having to save room for dessert---might be too much of a sacrifice!)."

/user_details?userid=zE49S2Em3l7vgIlvFzZFOw,Jenny H.,"Pembroke, Canada",3 star rating,"My friends recommended this place to me and my roommates. So we decided to drop by over the weekend. The place is pretty packed - be warned you will likely need to sit with other groups. The decor is pretty phenomenal. I love the environment - gives off a hipster vibe as well. My friends and I were seated on a high table and provided with the menu.  If you are like us, completely new to the place, you will realize you have no clue on what to order for food. The options are provided with no details. Thankfully, the waiters are extremely helpful - he described all the dishes in so much detail (and enthusiasm) that we could clap by the end. After the description we ordered: 3 satay, papaya salad with grilled pork, laksa lemac and the lamb soup with flat noodles. Starting with the 3 satay - nothing special. I did like the sauce - but pricey for what you receive. Papaya salad - my friends absolute favourite. This was a really refreshing dish - sour, spicy and sweet. Laksa lemac - I liked this one out of what we ordered. It has a good kick in flavor - but I don't know if you would say it's a meal..the size feels more like a snack. Lamb soup - big disappointment. Broth was decent, lamb meat was not strong in flavor (probably because it's stewed), but what drove it downhill was probably the noodles. While the noodles are edible - it was like a ball. Usually the starch forms a significant part of your base for dishes. So the fact that it wasn't made well was disappointing - especially with its price. I saw a lot of people have other foods - so I think if I were to come back, I would try other dishes. Customer service was good - like I mentioned above, the waiter was extremely helpful. So I definitely think the service was somewhat more impressive than half the food we tried."

It's a tiny little place with elbow-to-elbow seating, but it is definitely worth it.  The food is absolutely amazing.  At first we were a little unsure what to go with since we really hadn't had anything on the menu before, but the employees were so welcoming and happy to explain it all to us.  The service is really what made the experience that much better.  We split the Mee Goreng (I'm sorry about the spelling!) and the dish of the day which had all kinds of stuff in it... all you need to know is that it was all delicious.  We would have tried one of everything (and almost did!) if we had more room in our stomachs!I can't wait to head back to Montreal again just to come back here :)"
/user_details?userid=SkVuWUS5WOkTCTd88EnG3w,Anita L.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"Having lived in Asia, I must admit I was skeptical at first. The place is decked out in stereotypical and cliché traditional Chinese decor from the 1960s. It didn't help that one of the Caucasian waiter was dressed in Chinese clothes (albeit, I'm not totally sure if that was intentional). But the food was really good and authentic--we tried almost everything on the menu and I'd say you can't go wrong especially given that everything is reasonably priced (for Canada). For desserts, I liked the green crepe roll the most--the other cakes weren't as tasty. If you eat a lot, it might not be a good idea to get the tapas (the pork belly bao was just so-so). Also, there is always a lineup so you might not want to be starving before you leave your house, or you'll end up super hangry. Lastly, the service was also amazing (one of the waiter's gave us free wine for forgetting one of our orders) and the general vibe was hip, fun, and delicious!"

/user_details?userid=xO3EIJR0QNzM3CdajinWtw,Michael P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"A couple of years ago, while visiting Atwater Market with some friends, I tried a food stand called Satay Brothers. Don't exactly remember why I chose that particular food stand for food instead of the other ones present but I was quite happy with my choice that day. Fast forward to today and the Satay Brothers have opened up their prep kitchen on St-Jacques a few blocks over from the market to customers looking for their amazing asian fare during the winter time as well.The restaurant has a small sitting area of probably about 20 or so people. I arrived solo on a surprisingly busy mid afternoon Saturday. It was busy enough that I was set up at the bar counter since no tables were opening up anytime soon for a solo customer.To start with, I ordered the green papaya salad with grilled pork. This was a wonderfully fresh and light salad - a combination of what tasted like lemon, lime, mint and basil with the added crunch of peanuts to play with textures. Great start to the meal.Next up, there was the classic steamed pork buns. A nice piece of fatty pork with some coriander, cucumber and a hoisin-like sauce. I loved these the first time I had them at the market and I still loved them now. With the buns, I also added one chicken satay. Perfectly grilled and tender, when you added the amazing peanut sauce, the dish had a great kick to it. Believe me, I hate cucumber but you certainly needed them afterwards to help cleanse the palette.Finally, for dessert, I decide to try the Kueh Salat. A combination of coconut, stick rice and pandan, this was a perfectly light and sweet dessert that played very well after the rest of the meal.For all fans of the Satay Brothers from the Market, this is a must-visit to enjoy your usual summer favorites. For the rest of you, this is an extremely worthwhile visit - great food at a very reasonable cost. The Winnicki brothers and their mother have created a wonderfully homie restaurant experience. Alex, who was tending to the floor, was quite active - always interacting with his customers, starting up conversation while keeping service very snappy. The love shown to him and his family from all the patrons is a testament to the attention they put on everyone who comes through that door. I must also praise Alex from being quite understanding towards a situation with me that involved leaving money at a ATM prior to my arrival (unbeknownst to me when I came to pay) which is a problem at a cash only place. Quite the embarrassment for me but Alex was very trusting and was not concerned that I wouldn't come back later on to pay (which I did 20 minutes later). For the way he handle my situation, I thank him very much and, irregardless of the amazing food, he has certainly ensured that I return on a much more frequent basis in the future.Cheers!"

We tried the Beef Rendang, Laksa Lemak (with chicken), and the Papaya salad... Everything was tasty and of great quality.. the braised beef in the Rendang melted in our mouths, the server said it's braised for something like 16 hours (I don't remember the exact number, but in this ballpark range). I don't normally order salads when I go out, but the papaya salad was tasty, spicy and refreshing, and the laksa was very good - not as spicy as I was expecting but we asked for more chill paste, and they happily brought us a generous amount. Also the restaurant decor was really fun, and definitely worth noting - the bathroom was impeccably clean!

The place is very cosy and love the red lantern at the front door. Ordered a bunch of stuff-chicken skewers, gado gado salad, the laksma lemak soup, some beef patty sandwich with radishes. The issue is that while the food was tasty, my expectations were higher. The spice and zing that i remember from their outdoor Atwater location was lacking, and the beef sandwich, while the meat cooked just right, was dry and the advertised spicy mayo was barely to be found within. The salad was nothing special, just green beans, potatoes and not very tasty tofu with their peanut sauce. The best was the soup, and the peanut dipping sauce. I would go back to the Atwater location if i were shopping at the market, but i don't see myself going out of my way to go to the winter location as a destination itself. Prices are very reasonable though! I would give it 3.5 stars if i could"
