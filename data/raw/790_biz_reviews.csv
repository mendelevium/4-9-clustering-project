We enjoyed the street theater from the package store next door, and had a couple glasses of cava to celebrate our arrival and such.The proprieter was our server and gave us a friendly welcome to the city, as we worked out communications across our various language barriers, including the tableside card swiper and french instructions for tip etc on its display.  Throughout our visit we saw people walking around the neighborhood with takeout boxes, so that is a great option as well.  We sat below a poster of Lisa Leblanc and it kind of set the theme for our whole visit - an au naturel women kicking up up her heels and putting down the truth.  Tres Montreal.  A lovely neighborhood spot that is a true work of love - kudos to the chef and the front of house partner making it so!"

There are lots of tables, high stool with table and high stools by the bar. It is on the smaller side so it made it difficult to walk around. They do have an outdoor terrace which was closed obviously for winter. They have a stand to hang your coats. Dim lights, low hanging lights, and wood furniture. I had a great time with friends there. Now for the food.... I had a wonderful zucchini soup. It was a thick, creamy soup with a dollop of cream on top. It was filling but on the smaller end of portion. I then had the Mediterranean pizza (minus anchovies). It was really good, a bit on the tangy side but delicious. I felt they could have added more sauce because I found it on the drier side. The dough was very fluffy but I could taste a dust of flour on the crust. I couldn't finish the pizza so I had it packed to go and still enjoyed it the next day. For dessert I opted for cannoli! The plate came with 2 cannoli and almond ice cream. I lovedddd the ice cream but not so much the cannoli. The filling was just to thick. If you choose to bring a cake from outside they will charge you extra per person per serving. Service was great. The servers and waitresses were very helpful and made sure our glasses were full of water. They served us well. We all had a wonderful time. Definitely going back here!Parking might be an issue in the area because it's all zoning."
/user_details?userid=cntYY9TAsK8gLccAVmLK9Q,Joanie M.,"Granby, Canada",4 star rating,Pizza was goodIt's interesting to try the food from a true chef from Puglia. They uses great fresh ingredients on their pizza but unfortunately they were overcooked.
/user_details?userid=VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw,WhiteFeather H.,"Ottawa, Canada",2 star rating,"I gotta say - the anchovies were extremely overwhelming - not the way you want to experience anchovies, trust me. The whole pizza was ruined with dominating fishiness, which was buried under many other toppings so that you couldn't even pick them off. My advice: totally avoid anything anchovy in this restaurant. Also, the crust was burnt. And, we were rushed. I really don't think a restaurant should agree to serve a table if said table isn't going to have enough time to actually sit down and think about their order for five minutes without being pressured into making a choice. Totally unsatisfactory experience for me, and my son (who ended up with the anchovy pizza because he doesn't read French and didn't know what he was ordering). I felt like I wasted my money, unfortunately."

Coming from the United States, had to say that the Margarita Pizza was outstanding! No wait to get in, attentive waiters/waitresses. Loved the music they were playing! The house music with a beautiful disco beat made me feel good! Highly recommend!"

The only downfall is if you want to drink alcohol up cannot sit outside. I'm guessing this is a law in Montreal, but I'm not sure. I had the sangria and it was great. If you are not someone that speaks French like me, then you have nothing to worry about the staff speaks great English."
/user_details?userid=se6FhLaPSZXGePiDnJm-aw,Audrey K.,"Oakland, CA",4 star rating,"Solid neighborhood pizzeria. My husband had the tuna tartare appetizer which he thought was excellent. My son and I tried the Margarita and Mediterranean pizzas. The crusts were excellent and the toppings well prepared though the tomato sauce was thinner than we're used to. Very good service, nice decor and excellent wine selection by the glass. One star deducted for the grating techno music."
/user_details?userid=J7V85vbxajFdU1pHwd1jCQ,Louis-Philippe O.,"Beaconsfield, Canada",5 star rating,Great pizzeria with a warm atmosphere and very friendly staff. The cheese in the caprese salad was outstanding and the stella pizza was excellent. We definitely recommend to end the meal with the Nutella pizza! Will be coming back for sure!
/user_details?userid=npD-TYX5rE5XSmMpMx_Igg,Gabriel J.,"Richmond, VT",2 star rating,"Really not sure what all the hype is about. This place serves overpriced, flavorless, uninspired pizza in a pretentious environment. I had high hopes after reading the reviews but...ughh!!The crust is a disaster!!Over 6 days in Montreal, this was by far the worst meal I had.There are better choices throughout the neighborhood.."

After several active days and nights out, we were ready for a low key evening. We figured the neighborhood pizza place would be fine and easy. We were right about easy but it was so much better than fine. Really nice atmosphere, friendly staff, and great food. The tuna tartare was one of among my favorite dishes of the trip and the pizza was really tasty. This place was just as satisfying as the restaurants we specifically sought out based on excellent reviews, minus the lines and the crowds. We left very happy."
