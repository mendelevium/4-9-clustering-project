/user_details?userid=B7f5iHcyszjiHthLr5_6zA,TC N.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"We were introduced to this restaurant by a Peruvian couple, and came here to celebrate a family event. We had a great evening here! The service was warm, the food was amazing, and the restaurant had a lovely atmosphere - classy yet family-friendly. We particularly enjoyed the ceviche. Ceviche is something we've always craved for, and here the Peruvian ceviche is served in two different styles - one with cubed fish and the other in ""tiradito"" (finely sliced) style. The starters tasting menus for two offer a value-for-money way to try different things (including the alpaca tartare and veal heart). Between us we had different items for the main course: alpaca burger, duck with rice (so flavorful it could _almost_ outshine the duck!), Peru sea bass, and beef. Their sauces make the difference.The desserts had sauces / ice cream made with this fruit known as the lucuma, which hails from the faraway Andeans of Peru. It was explained to us that this amazing fruit is to Peru as the maple syrup is to Canadians. Well worth it!I mustn't forget the drinks menu. The Pisco  Sour is a must. There are different variations here... we were spoilt for choice! They also have Peru wine."
/user_details?userid=KBoIRjxSW7OWczv8OS9Bew,Xue L.,"Verdun, Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"Not so great food, delicious dessert and good service. We tried the scallop ceviche, alpaca, the fish, the braised alpaca and a chocolate pomegranate mousse for dessert. The appetizers tasted just ok. The main dishes were very bland and were lukewarm.  The dessert however was fantastic with the perfect amount of sweetness. The service was good. It was incredibly fast for a dine in restaurant and the staff was friendly. Not an expert in peruvian food but I can't say I was amazed by my experience. Don't think I would go back."

/user_details?userid=3Th437Wb8k1BXxanbYr6WQ,N B.,"San Francisco, CA",5 star rating,"I went quite a few times to Mochica when I was living in Montreal, essentially for everything they offer.The food is absolutely awesome, very good quality, and original. The service can explain every meal, what's special with every piece (for people who are interested in that, like I am) and where they source it from.From time to time, one gets to meet the chef wandering around and chatting with customers. Very humble and shy. But seriously, best profiteroles on Earth-- Ice cream lucuma and home made chocolate sauce, this is to die for!"
/user_details?userid=KTgYzSdXN42T_7Q5mOU8Cg,Danae Y.,"Lyon, France",2 star rating,"Very disappointed felt completely ripped-off my entrée and main course were with frozen seafood. Only the vegetables were fresh but had nothing peruvian about them (broccoli, bok choi, cauliflower). The cumin sweet potato mash has mostly cumin in it one cannot taste the sweet potato. My boyfriend's ceviche was extremely bland. I feel that the chef must think that his clients can be fooled by giving low-cost products and cooking at a gastronomical price. What should have warned us is the fact that their website presents a degustation menu at a reasonable price that in fact does not exist. Definitely not worth it- the food they serve should cost 1/2 of what they charge and calling themselves ""gastronomical"" is an insult to peruvian cuisine."

I was not disappointed.  Started with the ceviche, very good with just enough heat and authentic vegetables.  Could have used more pervian corn , choco I think, but otherwise great.  For main we both had the haddock which was delicious.  Also the wine recommended was good and not expensive. Service was great, ambiance authentic definitely a repeat!"

More than happy to answer all our questions and make recommendations. We had the 4 dish sampler, a goat curry, yuca fries and profiteroles for dessert. Everything was lick your plate clean delicious. The variety of the menu, authenticity to Peruvian food, and how well the food was prepared was astonishing. Highly highly recommended for an excellent experience & meal. 5 stars hands down."
/user_details?userid=AcOYkcZzyka5TqVUfz5npg,Alicia P.,"Montreal, Canada",4 star rating,"This is a late review. I took my mom to celebrate her birthday on July 28th and we were excited about this place based on the reviews we had read. Ill start with the positive: the drinks, my seco de cordero were good and the quality of the ingredients spoke volumen of the place. Unfortunately, my mom didnt have the same experience. Her papa a la huancaina was a bit on the garlicky side and her arroz con mariscos (her favorite dish) was way too salty. She only mentionned her disappointment after we left and I wonder wht she didnt finished her plate. To make matters worse, the restaurant was understaffed  and I had to ask for my bill 3 times which left us seated at the table for an extra 40 minutes. We liked to believe this was an odd night but as Peruvians we had a much bigger expectation of its cuisine."

I have to say I'm shocked this place didn't come more highly recommended! The food was really special, with such a wide array of flavors and perfect portion size. Our waiter was very friendly, very helpful with our questions about the menu. Also, the decor in the place makes you feel like you're in a museum or watching the history channel - it is so well designed! I recommend this place and will come back!"
/user_details?userid=dNIxs3_qcAuF8S9kS9iFCQ,Rafaella A.,"Montreal, Canada",2 star rating,"I've had Peruvian food in Montreal closer to the real deal and way cheaper than this place. The ambiance is too dark to eat, the waiter barely spoke Spanish, the lúcuma ice-cream tasted like D'Onofrio (which is a cheap generic and artificial local brand) and the tiradito was not really all that for its pricing. You're better off in some other Peruvian eatery near Jean Talon."
/user_details?userid=0rSY77NhhBi2ZCoJhwDMqw,Mo Riza ..,"New York, NY",2 star rating,"This Peruvian restaurant on St. Denise has a really nice going with their setting and ambiance. Neatly designed interior and very cozy service is memorable. Unfortunately there were a lot to be desired for it food. We were there for an early dinner in a beautiful Montreal's June. Ready for a break and good meal after a whole day of walking around. We started with a couple of appetizers, Papa ala Huancaina (potato balls and goatcheese in aji amrilo sauce) and Yuquita Rellena (Fried cassava stuffed with seavood) Both were really good with an absolutely stunning presentation. Such artistic arrangement of shapes and colors on minimalist plates, gorgeous and delicious. The highlight was the sauce for the potatoes. Terrific.For the entree we had Conchas ala guyanabana (Raw scallops with guyanabana lime sauce) and Cudado de mero (Steamed grouper in spicy rocoto sauce) Again these dishes came with impeccable presentation, but this time the taste did not measure up to the look, the scallop was stiff and much to chewy with slight aroma even defying the guyanabana sauce. My grouper seems to be steamed frozen, the spicy sauce couldn't not help. Sorry to say we had to abandon them half way and continue instead to nibble on the peripheral cassava and plantain chips."

/user_details?userid=9s_lDnpLMj7d9xr2FortAQ,Helder D.,"Columbus, OH",2 star rating,"Probably the best looking Peruvian restaurant I've been anywhere outside Peru. This includes Canada, U.S, Mexico and Colombia. I mean, these guys did a great job with decorations. The exotic ceramic works (Huacos) are awesome! . Like I said...excelente!Now, regarding the food, boy, the place fell short. After leaving the place, I was like ""meh"". Seasoning was needed everywhere. The ceviche was ok. No cancha (toasted corn) and the Lomo was also bland. The pisco drink was good however. My wife (american) who loves pervian food, got the corvina and was also disappointed.I've eaten much better Peruvian food in Miami and NY.Like I said, great place, but I do hope they get a better cook in there and get the sazon back in!!!"
/user_details?userid=-Sbsjlqdlmu_yax1Rs761g,Laura K.,"Detroit, MI",4 star rating,"I am a huge fan of Peruvian food so I was excited to eat here. Our server was great. He did a good job of steering us toward the best menu choices and he made a mean Pisco Sour. The table shared an order of ceviche served with corn nuts, of course. For my entree I had the duck and it was delicious, perfectly cooked and falling off the bone. I would certainly eat here again when in Montreal. It's a nice change of pace from the average fare you get at Mexican and other Latin restaurants. If you haven't had Peruvian food, give it a try."

And the drinks were also great. I got a pisco sour that I highly recommend.The owner was our waiter, and he was incredibly friendly and helpful. The ambiance was very relaxed and pleasant. I will definitely go back the next time I am in Montreal."
/user_details?userid=wa2IvwSuPgzIifdbaKYk5g,Holly E.,"Dallas, TX",4 star rating,I was excited to find this Peruvian treasure during a recent visit to Montreal. The Pisco Sours were potent. I had a couple varieties of ceviche. Everything was delicious and absolutely Peruvian. The restaurant itself was beautiful with an exposed wine cellar and gorgeous Peruvian art everywhere. I had a great time! A good Pisco Sour is difficult to find outside of South America!
/user_details?userid=eTjPXBJw7A2R-RsoVgcPUw,Claudia C.,"Montreal, Canada",3 star rating,"As peruvian myself I must say Mochica's like any other restaurant in Peru, the same flavor, the same ingredients (at least that's what I tasted). I felt like eating in my home country. However, we got our food one hour after we ordered, which was to much! The environment was charming, authentic but I really bothered me how slow the service was. Perhaps happened 'cause that day there was a big group of around 15 people ordering different stuff. But still you know... And there was just two waiters on a saturday!"
/user_details?userid=TTIN0J6AHu1DMKksq3fd7A,Matthew B.,"Toronto, Canada",4 star rating,I was treated to a delicious meal in this beautiful restaurant with a friend from Peru. I felt like I was in Miraflores or a museum there. Met the chef and owner. The washroom has a surprise.
/user_details?userid=nk4pr3GytIe9fy6MuF0kMg,Ian M.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"This restaurant was a delightful surprise.  A visiting friend and I had difficulty walking around the plateau finding a restaurant that could accommodate his gluten allergy.  Most items on Mochica's menu were sans gluten, happily.  I had the lamb leg and he the cubed steak.  Both of us were bowled over by just how delicious our meals were.  The service and presentation were top notch, the prices VERY reasonable and the taste was out-of-this-world.  I have had few culinary experiences like that where I am tasting flavors totally foreign to me and can't believe how good it is.  Highly recommended."
/user_details?userid=JGjtkOtTs8oFg0AhAeyPVA,Rannie B.,"Montreal, Canada",5 star rating,"Had an awesome dinner at this Peruvian restaurant recently. The decor and the ambiance are perfect for a relaxing or romantic dinner. Mochica has a nice selection of cocktails and non alcoholic beverages. Started off with a mixed appetizer plate for 2, piqueo crillo. All 4 entrees varied from good to excellent. My favourite being the tamalito verde. A parcel of mashed corn with cilantro steamed in a banana leaf stuffed with chicken, egg and Alphonso olives. This large appetizer plate was followed by the Lomo saltado which are tender beef morsels with red and green onions, tomatoes, in a tangy and very tasty sauce. It was accompanied by garlic rice, cassava fries and rocoto mayonnaise that were spectacular. My partner had a sea bass dish with a seafood sauce that was excellent. Portion for this dish was exceptionally large. Presentations were beautiful for all dishes and the service excellent and friendly. Oh yes, one should not miss a trip to the rest rooms (both men an women). The resident tenant may fire up your imagination as to how to finish your evening or, at the very least, make you smile. Overall this was an excellent dinner experience and I recommend this place highly."

I'm Peruvian and I must say this restaurant is pretty good. Good selection of dishes, including Llama which is not so frequently found in Lima restaurants given that is our national animal."
/user_details?userid=KGTTyUeHPZM3qYfkCRTTyw,Hugo B.,"Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Canada",4 star rating,"Being a regular traveller to Peru I've had the chance to sample the real thing.  Mochicas isn't perfect, but overall I love going.The cancha they sometimes serve before you get your food is great.  The papa Ala huancayna is excellent.  The llama dishes are certainly deserving of praise.But what really stands out is the decor.Definatly worth a visit, if only once out of curiosity.  But I'd recommend going twice to sample a few different things"
/user_details?userid=1nWxY0fXnjZ7cNGEZvFsjg,David G.,"Chapel Hill, NC",4 star rating,I had the Grilled red tuna in an ancestral sugar cane and red ají panca sauce Quinoa.  The tuna was seared to a nice medium rare.  Very nice interior.  There were many items on the menu that looked really good.  I might have to go back to try some of the other dishes.
/user_details?userid=Tp88QUOVSbw9-zOJ8tuUPA,Lisa M.,"Washington, DC",5 star rating,"Great ambience. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. We had the ceviche for an appetizer, and it was excellent. Great pisco sours too. For dinner, I had the kingfish and my boyfriend had the shrimp. Both were delicious, but the fish took the prize. Both were garnished with exquisitely prepared vegetables, including the best brussel sprouts I've ever eaten. Highly recommended."
